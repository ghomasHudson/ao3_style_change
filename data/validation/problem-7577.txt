"Oh sweetheart, we're just getting started."
"Good boy. Such a good boy, Steve." He tilted Steve's chin up so he could look at him. "Here's what we're going to do. Since you've been so good for me, I'm going to let you take care of me, then we're going to go to the bedroom and get your punishment out of the way. Alright?"
“Let me go, you son of a bitch! Let me go! How dare you!”
"Hey, you alright, baby?"
Steve nodded against his shoulder, struggling to calm himself. "Alright."
"What would have happened if you'd been able to take off your cage, Steve? Answer me!"
Tony pressed his finger to Steve’s mouth, stopping his words. “Hush. You’re fine, Steve. You don’t have to apologize for being hurt and scared. It sounds like no one from your world took the time to appreciate you, much less treat you the way you deserve. And that’s gonna change. Right now.”
Epilogue: Two Years Later
Tony teased his nipples enough to harden them before attaching lightly weighted clamps. A soft chime when Steve shifted his position, caused him to blush with the realization that there were bells on them. Any movement would cause them to sound.
“You’re welcome, honey.” He sighed, resting his forehead against Steve’s. “You know what I think?”
Steve lay there, pleasure throbbing through his body, aching for release and trembling. Feeling the wave of it slowly recede, replaced with the desire to please the other man. To give him anything and everything he asked for.
"Yeah... Just like that."
“Okay. Just a second.” Tony disappeared from the room, returning with the plug in his hand. Steve rolled onto his stomach, pushing up onto his hands and knees, a feeling of rightness rushing over him as he presented for his alpha. He moaned as the plug stretched him open before settling into place, keeping his alpha’s come safe inside of him.
"Aren't you supposed to just tell me what to do?"
"Thank you. Did you have a good time at the spa?"
Steve whined softly as his weight settled against the plug. “So… It’s not a punishment?”
He raised a hand, calming him, when Steve tried to scramble to his feet. “I mean you no harm.”
"Yeah." He nuzzled against Tony's palm, feeling the calluses against his skin. "Yeah, I'm good."
“Yeah, well. You did literally ask for it.”
Another chapter! This one’s a little shorter than the last one, but we’re finally starting to get somewhere! I’m really enjoying squishable Steve. He’s so adorable! Enjoy!
"Oh honey." He felt his heart squeeze in his chest. How much had this man been through, to be so afraid. "And I lost everyone and everything. I'm always afraid that everything is going to disappear. I guess that means we match."
A quick combination of buttons was punched in. Steve paused to see what would happen next. He didn’t have to wait long. The dildo began to press relentlessly deeper inside of him, past the length of Tony’s cock, past the length of anything Steve had ever felt inside him before. Deep enough to make him ache and throb in an entirely new way. He scrambled to push up higher on his toes, gain even a fraction of an inch back for himself as the cock cored deeper into him. Steve slipped, unable to catch himself with his bound arms, crashed back onto the still expanding cock. He screamed as a release tore through him, shuddering and shaking, pinned on the enormous thing buried inside of him.
Tony cleared his throat, drawing Steve’s attention back to him. For a second Steve thought he saw a flash of something blue from behind his sunglasses, but it must have been a trick of the light, because when he looked again it was gone. The waiter was standing beside the table, both of them staring at him. Someone must have asked him a question, but he had no idea what it might have been. “Whatever you want, Tony.” Seemed like the safest answer.
“There will never be a time when I don’t want you, Steve. Not possible.”
“Yes Tony. Always.”
At his words, Tony turned in his arms, tilting Steve’s chin up to study his face. “What are you sorry for, sweetheart?”
"Anything specific sound good?"
“Can I help?”
Steve woke up with a gasp, his body on fire. His cock was a high-pitched ache, straining against the metal of the cage, and Tony's fingers were buried inside of him rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. He moaned, rocking back against him, trying to force those clever fingers deeper into him.
“You belong to me now, Steve. You will find that I have the right to do a great many things. Not all of which you will like. Now, are you going to behave, or are you eating your first meal in our home strapped to a board?”
He swallowed around Tony, felt him twitch again, conversation never faltering. And then he did it again, before swirling his tongue around the head. He heard Tony break off in the middle of what he was saying, cover it with a cough and continue. Steve continued to lick and suck until the cock in his mouth was fully hard and leaking before letting it slip back into his throat. He could feel his own cock lengthen and thicken, for once able to get hard without the restriction of the cage.
“My pleasure, sweetheart.” He nuzzled at the torn flesh of Steve’s neck, couldn’t seem to help himself. They’d need to talk in the morning. Unsurprisingly, Tony now had even more questions about omega anatomy than he’d had before, and they’d need answers. Steve belonged to him now, and Tony would give him everything he needed. Steve snuggled back, the acidic tinge of distress was gone from his scent. It was warm and soft now. Soothing. Tony wrapped his arms around his omega and drifted to sleep.
"It is. He asked me to the gala this weekend. And I'm going."
"Yes I do. You ready sweet boy?"
“Just play?”
“And what happens afterwards? When you’re finally forgiven? Do you go back to your world? Leave all this behind?”
“What?”
"Hold it together, Hawkeye. We just have to try to get close to... What was this one calling himself?" Even Steve sounded exasperated.
“Alright, baby.” Tony’s voice was soft. Gentle. “Then that’s what we’ll do. You give yourself to me, be mine. And I’ll take care of you for the rest of our lives.” Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s, lingered for a moment as he sighed into the kiss. “Then why don’t we go down to the lab, and I’ll finish making you mine.”
“You will after I get done with you.” After one more rough squeeze to his pecs, Tony’s hands slid down his back, pressing him farther forward, balanced more precariously on his knees. Steve felt his cheeks roughly pulled and held apart, followed by pressure against his hole. He could feel the hairs of Tony’s goatee scratching at the sensitive skin around his rim, could hear the obscene slurping sounds he was making as he devoured Steve’s hole, tongue thrusting in and out, loosening the muscle. But he couldn’t feel any of it.
He claimed Steve’s mouth in a heated kiss, and all he could do was cling to the other man’s shoulders. The elevator doors opened and Tony dragged him into the penthouse, towards their bedroom. Steve managed a whine of Tony’s name as he was pushed back onto the bed, and he began fumbling with the straps, releasing them and sliding the dildo free. A rush of slick followed, soaking the sheets underneath him, and Steve’s face burned with embarrassment.
"Alright sweetheart. Lay back. I'll take care of you. No tricks this time. I promise."
"Yes, please..." Steve tried to arch up, but hard pressure against his hip held him firm against the bed. Tony took his time, opening him up slowly, making him wait for every stroke. By the time his fingers slid away Steve was a needy wreck beneath him wanting nothing more than to be filled, fucked hard and deep. "Tony, please!"
“This… This is for me?” His voice was quiet. Uncertain. Tony could almost feel the fear radiating off of this man. He was nothing like Captain America, and the lack of comforting touches seemed cruel. Like Tony was punishing him somehow.
“Good omega.” Steve shuddered visibly at the words, and Tony couldn’t resist cupping his face in his hands. Pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. “Things are going to be different now, Steve. I promise. Now get some rest, sweetheart. We’ll talk in the morning.”
“Yes. Yes, that’s what I want.”
“Morning, my sweet omega.”
"I know. You can do it. And then all will be forgiven. You want that, don't you?"
The other man's face lit up with a smile when he looked up. "Hey sweetheart, I didn't expect to see you until later."
“Yes, alpha.” He panted.
“Good. Shall we begin?” Tony settled back against the couch, one hand resting on the back of Steve’s neck. He could feel the tremors running through Steve’s body. Steve knew he was being set up.
Tony began digging through drawers and file cabinets, muttering to himself about overly helpful robots. The entire situation was so surreal that Steve couldn’t help laughing. Tony glanced back, smiling at him, and suddenly he felt light and free. Safe, in a way that he never had before. He was a claimed omega. By Tony Stark no less. The man he’d wanted since they’d met. And a kinder, gentler version. Who made Steve feel wanted and cherished.
Steve stood up and stalked downstairs to the lab. Bucky was right. He was always right. If Tony was going to throw away what they had, he could damn well do it to Steve’s face. “JARVIS, open the door.”
Without waiting for a response, Tony moved over him on the bed, one hand pinning his shoulder while the other fisted in his hair, jerking his neck to the side. He tried to struggle, but his body felt weak and unresponsive. He couldn’t even lift his arms to push the other man away. Sharp teeth positioned themselves over his bonding gland, tearing a cry from his lips as they sank in hard enough to rupture it. A wave of sensation washed over his body with the rush of hormones, pleasure and need so intense that he began to leak.
"I love you too, Tony. My evil sadist."
He nodded. Steve could feel a tightness in the pit of his stomach. He wasn't sure why he liked this so much, but he did.
"Tony..." The words made his skin burn and all he could do was lose himself in kissing the other man, desperately over and over again. He was right. Captain America might run straight into a fight, but Steve Rogers wanted to be used. Locked up tight and owned.
"Your punishment sweetheart." Tony picked up a small piece of metal and what appeared to be a clamp. He spent several moments attaching it to the cage around Steve's cock, fussing until it was positioned properly, before picking up a small remote control. He moved over to a chair in the corner, shifting it to give him an unobstructed view of Steve on the bed.
Tony was watching him, arms folded and brow arched. "Did you enjoy that, sweetheart?"
“Just making another part of you mine, Steve. Now hold still for a minute. Let me see what I’m working with.” Questing fingers pressed inside of him, slowly working deeper, rubbing firm circles against Steve’s passage until he reached his prostate. Steve gasped as a bolt of pleasure shot through him, trying to grind his caged cock down against the bench. “There we are. Nice and sensitive, though I think I can improve that a little bit as well.”
“I can’t do that. Those people out there need me.”
“Hey Spangles, you’re back!”
"Is it really that bad, sweetheart?"
Tony pressed him onto his back, fastening his wrists securely to the headboard. Steve writhed, hips rolling up into the air uncontrollably. The need to come was unbearable. He could feel it building, increasing, with every moment that passed. He tried to grind back against the bed and was rewarded with a flare of pain from his recently abused hole. Steve squeezed his thighs together, willing to try anything for pressure or sensation on his throbbing cock, but no matter what he tried there was nothing. Only smooth metal. No pressure or friction. Nothing to ease his torment. He couldn’t still his frantic movements, rocking back and forth on the bed.
Tony’s expression became stern. “Do you want to go back to feeling how you did before? Frustrated all the time? Unable to release, unable to come even if you do get hard? Hmm…?”
“That’s right. Good omega, letting your alpha take care of you. All you have to do is let me.” Tony’s mouth slid back to his, offering him more of the drugging kisses that Steve couldn’t get enough of. He barely noticed that one of Tony’s hands was working it’s way over his hip, rubbing circles over his ass, before sliding down further to rub behind his balls.
"Do you need to use it?"
Tony sucked in a breath, nostrils flaring and eyes going dark. When he spoke again his voice was deeper, a growl low in his throat. “Oh Steve… You have no idea, do you sweetheart?” He pushed Steve back onto the bed, prowling over his body, pressing him deeper into the mattress. “You smell absolutely divine, baby.” Tony dipped his head, flicking his tongue over Steve’s bond bite, drawing a moan from his lips. “You’re in heat, baby. And I’m gonna fucking wreck you…”
Steve never had a chance to answer. The plug buried inside of him roared to life, waking up the need that had been forgotten when he was pleasuring his Dom. He could see the blue glow of his eyes as the vibrator jumped levels, working him toward the edge before dropping back down. Teasing him as he writhed, clamps pulling harshly at sore nipples and caged cock throbbing in agony at being denied. Heat built inside of him antagonizing the lubricant Tony had used on him. His hips ground back desperately, the itch inside of him rising and falling in waves.
Steve’s gaze flicked between the message on his screen and Tony over and over again, as several things slotted into place. His eyes grew wide. “Your new sunglasses. The really dark ones. You used them to hide your eyes. You used them to hide your eyes so you could control sex toys you sent me without me knowing it! In public!”
It was Steve’s turn to cup his chin, force Tony’s gaze to his. His blue eyes burned with fury and indignation. “First of all, no one is ever going to say anything like that about you around me. You were hurt and taken advantage of. You don’t deserve to be made fun of for it. Second, I don’t care what the punishment is gonna be for it later, if I ever see either of them, I’ll fucking kill them myself. And third, you are not allowed to go to events without me anymore. If you don’t let me have clothes for them, then I guess it’ll make ‘em even more interesting. Because you are my alpha, and I will protect you.”
A dark chuckle greeted his words. “I don’t think so.” He laughed again at Steve’s helpless groan. “But I do have something else for you that I think you’ll enjoy.”
Steve nodded desperately. “Yes Sir. Thank you Sir.”
Title is from Something Just Like This by Coldplay and the Chainsmokers.
He grinned. "I am. I love a game that I always win."
Steve could feel wetness welling up in his eyes, blinked furiously to try to clear it away. “I’m damaged goods, Tony. I know it, SHEILD knows it, and now you do too.”
“You… Made me a room in your tower?”
There had to be a trick. Tony's voice sounded too sweet. But it had been almost two weeks since he'd been locked up, and he was getting desperate. "Yes. Please, yes."
Tony’s eyes were still bright blue as he unfastened the restraints, helping Steve off the table to stand on wobbly legs. He was confused when he was led back upstairs. The way Tony had been talking about it, Steve had expected something much worse. Especially if everyone else had refused to do it. And he hadn’t replaced the cage, which was also unexpected considering how possessive Tony seemed to be when it came to Steve. The uncertainty began to grow. Had he done something wrong? Had he failed at yet another thing Tony needed from him? “Sir…?”
"That's right. You heard me. I think I've been indulging my boy a little too much lately. Maybe I should find a way to lock that up too, right along with your sweet cock."
“Yes Tony.”
A piece of leather was slid beneath Steve’s body and wrapped around his waist, fastening above the cage. A second strap was drawn between his legs. A slim curved vibrator was slid inside of him before the strap was fastened, holding it securely in place, pressed firmly against his gland. Steve immediately started shaking his head rapidly, knowing what was coming next. “No. No, please Tony. I can’t. I can’t stand it. It hurts. Please.”
Steve stepped forward. "That depends on you."
After his next, much shorter, heat, he practically demanded Tony leave the plug in place for several days. It was soothing, in an odd way. Not only knowing that he held a piece of his alpha inside of him, but being filled in general. Tony seemed to enjoy seeing his omega plugged, so it became rare for Steve to go without.
“I’m okay.” Bucky sniffed softly, drawing back from Bruce’s neck. “Stevie’s an old friend. Nobody’s ever frustrated me as much as the punk does, but he’d never hurt me. Not really.”
"Something like that." Steve flashed her a wry smile.
He wouldn't say anything yet. Would wait. After all, Tony had said it when he was mostly asleep. He would wait until he was ready to say it when he was awake. Maybe when that day came, Steve would be ready to return his feelings. Would have gotten past the fear that everything he loved would always disappear.
“I am really fucking confused right now.”
“You can and you will. Because I’m telling you to. Now.” The first release ripped through Steve as soon as the order left the alpha’s mouth. He shook, sensation crashing over him, leaving him unable to resist. As soon as one ebbed, another crested, taking him again. His nipples and cock throbbed, burning with oversensitivity, Tony carelessly fucking him through it, his voice a low murmur against Steve’s ear.
"Just for you."
"Tony... Tony, I can't..."
Steve whimpered softly, writhing in the restraints, desperate to soothe the itch still burning through his caged cock and filled ass. “A few more touches, baby, and then we’re done.” A blindfold was bound in place over Steve’s eyes, plunging him into darkness, intensifying the sensations. Tony began pinching and rubbing his nipples, working them into tight points before a pair of sharp toothed clamps were snapped into place. Steve was beyond protesting, only able to whimper softly.
“I know, baby. I’m sorry.” Tony sighed as Steve slowly relaxed against him. “There’s my sweet little omega. It’s okay. I’ll take care of you.”
Steve whined again, his expression showing obvious confusion at his body’s reaction to the situation. Tony brushed his fingertips over the head of Steve’s cock, feeling it twitch beneath them. “It seems I was wrong. Obviously this isn’t much of a punishment if you’re enjoying it this much. Do you think you could come from this, pet? Maybe if you’re good, take it without fighting me, I’ll let you try.” Tony smiled as the color burned brighter in Steve’s cheeks. He was so much fun to play with. And so easy to embarrass.
"I want to take care of you."
"Remind me never to go to Asgard."
“Do you remember what I said earlier?”
Dark eyes rolled up to meet his. “Yeah? Is that hard for my good boy to handle.” He waited for Steve to nod before he flashed a wicked smile. “Good.” Tony wrapped his mouth around him and sucked hard, the length of him barely filling his mouth. The heat and pressure surrounding his cock was enough to make him scream, grinding his head back against the bench. Tony didn’t stop, not letting up for a second, until Steve released, slick gushing from his hole and a small trickle into his mouth. He held him between his lips, tongue flicking over the head, digging into his slit to chase the taste, before releasing him. “So sweet, baby doll. I love it.”
“Here, come sit with me.” Tony’s hands gripped his arm, guiding him down to the bed before his legs gave out.
“Good morning, alpha.”
Tony wrapped him in his arms, pulling Steve close and holding him. Rubbing his back as he cried helplessly against his alpha’s shoulder. “I know. I know, sweetheart. It’s hard. But it’s for the best. I know what you need.”
"Good. I want my boy taken care of when I'm not here. You should use it every time I'm gone."
Steve grinned unapologetically. “Since you told me what she did to you.”
Thank you so much to everyone who has taken the time to comment on this story. I really appreciate knowing that I’m not the only one who enjoys the twisted little adventures my brain goes on.
“Yeah, I do.”
He melted into Tony's touch, sinking into the kiss and chasing after the other man's lips when he pulled back. "I missed you, Tony."
"Alright." He could hear slick sounds from behind him, could imagine how Tony looked, rubbing lube over his thick hard cock. Getting himself ready to press into Steve, stroke inside of him, and make him scream. He felt the blunt head of Tony's cock press against his rim, and slowly sink inside, stretching and burning just enough to make him moan. He rocked his hips back, desperate to feel the other man as deep inside himself as possible.
Then there were warm breaths against his ear. "Keep your eyes closed for me, sweetheart."
Steve looked up, startled. Now he was stuck, and still didn’t know what to say. “I…”
"You... You did. So good. So good, Tony."
He threw his arms around Tony’s neck, clinging as he moved inside of him. Thrusting deep, cock dragging over his glands with each stroke until Steve thought he really would lose his mind from the onslaught of pleasure. His release crept over him slowly, tightening his muscles and stealing his breath. Leaving him shaking in Tony’s arms, desperate for the last little push he needed to fall over. Tony kept him there, hanging on the edge, for what felt like hours. All he could focus on was the desire built to a fevered pitch inside him.
Tony pressed a thicker plug of his own design into him, relishing Steve’s low moan.  As with everything else in the tower, it was technology designed by Tony that was easy for him to control. Steve needed the hormones he would receive from Tony, had been deprived for far too long. He would be lacking in his duty as an alpha if he left him in a plug that the other man could remove. Because Steve would try to remove it. He’d do anything and everything to fight against his situation, doing unacceptable amounts of damage to himself in the process. Which Tony couldn’t allow. Once he’d been settled, grew accustomed to his place, Steve would be grateful for the care Tony was taking of him now.
Steve jerked so hard he slid free of Bucky’s mouth. He let out a soft growl, gripping Steve’s hips hard, pinning them to the mattress. He sucked the little cock again, tongue circling the slick head. Steve struggled beneath him, but Bucky was stronger. Tony was right, he did taste sweet. Bucky chased the addictive taste, moaning around him when Tony breeched him with a slick finger, carefully flexing within him, stretching the tight rim. Without anywhere else to focus the intensity, Bucky turned it on Steve. He sucked and licked at him as though he’d never stop, delighting when Steve would shake and cry, spilling into his waiting mouth over and over again.
But also somehow wrong. Like he wasn't supposed to be doing this. Like he was going to get in trouble. Be punished again. Images of Tony punishing him flashed through his mind, caused his hips to jerk forward into his fist. His cock throbbed. He couldn't do it.
Tony grinned at him. "I don't think you want the answer to that."
“Tony…?”
When they stopped, Tony started the vibrations again. Steve groaned miserably as the cycle was repeated. All that existed were the maddening vibrations in his ass, the harsh slaps against his skin, the pain in his nipples. He felt his chin jerked up. Tony was standing in front of him again. "We're almost done, baby. You've been so good for me. Taken your punishment so well. There's just a little bit left, and then you'll be my good boy again. You want that, don't you?"
"Do you understand, sweetheart?"
As soon as Steve had earned the privilege of clothes, he demanded to accompany Tony to every gala and dinner. The first one was difficult, being surrounded by so many people, unsure of how to act or his place among them. But once he relaxed, it went surprisingly well. Steve had the natural talent of putting people at ease, something he put to good use to further his mate’s interests. He rarely saw Bucky at the events, but was guaranteed to have a good time when he did.
When Steve's eyes opened, he was stretched out on the bed, head resting in Tony's lap. Gentle fingers combed through his hair distractedly as the other man read through something on his tablet. As soon as he felt Steve stir, he set it aside, smiling down at him. "How do you feel?"
Tony rubbed his back, trying to soothe the distraught omega. He waited until the flood of tears had slowed before he spoke again. “Steve? Did something happen? C’mon, talk to me. Tell me what’s wrong.”
Had Tony's eyes always been that dark? His tone always had that predatory edge to it? Steve's hands shook as he went through his cabinets, finding a vase and putting the flowers in water. Tony rested a hand at the small of his back, guiding him out the door and into the elevator. They were silent as they got settled into the back of the car and Happy started driving.
With a loud groan against his ear, Tony thrust deep, knot swelling to lock them together. Steve could feel the heavy pulses of come filling him, the tight stretch as he struggled to accommodate a knot for the first time. His cock ached, and he struggled to free himself from Tony’s grip. “Alpha, please!”
“Yes alpha.” Steve trembled as Tony pulled him closer, hard cock grinding against Steve’s soft cocklet.
Instead of the longed for pleasure, Steve felt the slide of metal closing around him from all sides. He tried to struggle, but between the handcuffs and Tony sitting on his legs, he couldn’t get enough leverage to get away.
Another shorter chapter, mostly because I don't like breaking midscene. I also want to show that this is a loving and healthy relationship, as well as a kinky power exchange. I personally feel like the affection enhances the dominance and submission. Let me know what you think!
The answer was nothing. No teasing, no torturing, no games, and no sex. Just sleeping, held close against his chest. The next day was the same. And the day after that. After four days, not only was the anticipation of a punishment driving him crazy, but the need for release. He couldn't focus on work, on drawing, exercising, or reading. He tried to watch a movie with Natasha and Clint but ended up excusing himself halfway through before either spy noticed him squirming in his seat.
"Not quite, sweetheart. I'm sorry. But after watching you... I have to have you."
The fingers retracted, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief, but returned a moment later. Instead of a finger pushing through his cervix, it was something else. Not much thicker, but less pliable than flesh. High pitched cries were torn from him as the entrance to his womb was forced open and held that way by some form of torturous plug. He jerked in his restraints, hips working frantically to shake the horrible thing free, but it was too late. It was jammed securely inside of him, triggering another round of cramping as his body unsuccessfully tried to force it out. He shuddered uncontrollably, but nothing else happened. He tried to feel relief, but knew Tony wouldn’t make it that easy.
“Hey, Earth to Steve. Everything okay, Spangles?”
Instead there were spasms of pain, like a muscle cramp, from inside his passage. Steve’s rim tightened around Tony’s knot in a wave of discomfort, accompanied by a searing pain just beneath his balls. He sobbed as the same unfulfilling rush from earlier swept through his body, come leaking slowly from the tip of his soft cock.
"Thank you." Steve's breath hitched. It was too much. It was perfect. "Tony, please..."
When they’d fallen asleep together earlier, Steve had felt perfectly content for the first time in several days. Tony loved him. Wanted to keep him. Steve wasn’t sure what to do with all of that yet. The rush of emotions Tony triggered was frightening and new. He’d expected to sleep like the dead until morning. Instead he found himself waking up feeling restless in the middle of the night. Tony was still lying beside him, the penthouse was quiet around them. He couldn’t figure out what had disturbed him. Steve carefully slid from Tony’s arms and padded into the bathroom, getting a drink of cool water then splashing some on his face. It helped for a moment, but that hot unsettled feeling quickly returned.
Steve nodded against his skin, still struggling with the fear that Tony would decide he had made a mistake, that he wasn’t good enough. That he wanted someone else.
"Yes. God, please, yes."
Something was wrong. Something was off. About Steve. About his reaction. But he didn’t have time to figure out what it was before his arms were full. Steve had launched himself at Bucky, arms around his shoulders, legs around his waist, like he had a million time when they were kids. Bucky had caught him out of instinct, then stood there frozen with shock as Steve buried his face in the side of his neck and began to cry. He couldn’t remember the last time Steve had cried. Not during the war, or when he’d been beaten to a pulp. Maybe when his Ma had died, but even then he’d hidden it. Tried to be strong.
“Yeah, but you’re a super soldier, honey. A week should be nothing for you.” Tony lowered himself down over his body, thigh pressed firmly between Steve’s as his lips continued to tease at his sensitive nipples. He could feel the vibrations against his skin as Tony continued to speak. “Well, if you want it that bad, go ahead. Take what you need, sweetheart. See how far it gets you.”
Tony cut him off. "And what if I want to? What if I enjoy buying you whatever tiny little thing catches your fancy? Or knowing that every time you get dressed, every single thing you put on was chosen by me? Everything you eat, everything you use, everything that makes you smile. Me."
“Thanks.” Tony could see the tiny apartment from every angle, the heat signature moving inside. Two signatures on the roof of the building, one much cooler than a normal human, and another with a clear view from across the street.
“That’s right, pretty baby, just enjoy it.” Steve moaned when the plug slid free, leaving him clenching on nothing. Tony made no move to do anything else, simply standing there, watching Steve react for long minutes. Eventually he ran a single fingertip over Steve’s flushed cock and balls, tracing the satiny skin. “I’m going to figure out exactly how your body works, sweetheart. Every little thing that makes you crazy. And then I’m gonna make you lose your mind.”
"I said, try again. Not very good at listening to me today, are you?"
Tony let his new pet rest for the rest of the afternoon. He didn’t want to wear him out too soon. After dinner he turned to face him, taking in the eager gaze trained on his face. It really was too easy. If he hadn’t already killed Stephen Strange, he might say he owed him a thank you. “Would you like to work off one of your punishments for me, sweetheart?”
“Such a good boy. You’re a fucking gift, Steve.” Tony led him back down to the lab, over to the corner filled with benches and frames. This time he helped Steve up unto a table, urged him to lie back against it. Steve’s wrists were fastened beside his head, and a metal strap was secured across his waist. It should have made him feel claustrophobic and trapped. But because it was for Tony, the restraints had started to make him feel safe. Secure. It was another way the other man took care of him. Holding him down so he didn’t hurt himself.
“What is it you need, sweetheart? Tell me, and I swear I’ll give it to you.”
"Alright pretty boy, I'll take care of you. I always do. There's lube in the box, get it out. I want you to prep that pretty little hole of yours for me. Hands and knees. I want to see you do it." As he spoke, Tony casually reached down, tilting the phone so Steve could see him, stretched out in the hotel room, naked and stroking himself.
Tony rolled him onto his side, settling his arms in front of him and a thick pillow beneath his head. The plug was slid from his hole and he gasped softly as the alpha’s thick cock pressed inside of him. He moved slowly, giving Steve a chance to adjust, but he was already sensitive, unaccustomed to any type of penetration, that every touch was overwhelming. One of Tony’s hands wrapped loosely around Steve’s cock, providing delicious friction as each thrust rocked his hips forward. The other hand slid beneath his cock, stroking over the smooth stretch of skin where his balls used to be before pressing in and rubbing firm circles against the area.
"What's the matter, baby? Still need something?"
“Oh Stevie… You can’t listen to people like that. They ain’t any better than the gossips always talkin’ ‘bout who was runnin’ around with who back in Brooklyn. They ain’t got any idea what’s really goin on.”
Steve tried to answer but the words choked off when a quick succession of slaps landed over his ass and thighs, with careful attention payed to landing strikes on his plugged up hole. He writhed helplessly, never trying to get away. Tony must have been paying close attention, because the flurry of blows stopped, leaving him shuddering on the edge of release.
Steve sniffled, burrowing deeper into his alpha’s chest, voice small. “It hurt.”
Researching caging practices was horrifying. The options that Stark Industries produced had become wide spread, and were some of the kindest on the market. In some third world countries, if an omega’s genitals were deemed unacceptable, they were removed entirely. Pictures of cages that forced the cock entirely inside the body, or were lined with spikes that dug into the sensitive flesh when it began to harden, had Steve cupping his cage protectively. The SI model was constructed of nanobytes, designed for optimal suppression. It would keep a constant pressure on an omega’s cocklet, adjusting with it over time, but never constricting blood flow or causing damage to the tissue. There were also medical pictures of omega’s who were not caged. In some cases the penis continued to grow, developing malformed lumps and bulges, causing damage to the nerves and leading to chronic pain conditions.
Steve rolled over, burying his face in the blankets, hips churning frantically. “I-I can’t… I can’t… Please. Please, Tony. Make it stop. Please make it stop.”
They had spent the weekend quietly, enjoying the time together, laughing and talking like always. Then Monday came, and work along with it. Before he left for the day, Tony had bent him over the bed, opened him up, and slid a fairly large plug inside of him. Then he'd kissed him, told him to be good, and left.
“You- You won’t…”
Steve’s back arched higher in the restraints, body throbbing, building higher and higher, unable to fall over the edge and defy his alpha’s order. Not until Tony allowed it. Words were quickly beyond him. Soon he was unable to focus on a single sensation. Just the overwhelming combination of pleasure and pain coursing through his body. His alpha’s cock thrusting into him over and over again. His command denying Steve release, holding him there.
"Good boy." He moved away again, guiding Steve until he was lying sprawled out on top of the giant bed. "You stay right here, for just a moment. I'll be right back, gorgeous. I just want to pick out a few things."
The genius rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed. “Yeah… About that.” His eyes lit up, glowing bright arc reactor blue for a moment before fading. Steve’s phone chimed with a text.
“So do you. And isn’t it an alpha’s job to take care of an omega?”
Rogers had been willing to burn the world down and tear anyone who got in his way to pieces for Bucky Barnes. Had lied, stolen, and betrayed everyone he knew in the future. So why hadn’t he actually protected him? Why had James been allowed to wander New York alone? Or been given even the most basic of mental health care? Tony knew the Rogues were in Wakanda. There was nowhere else for them to go. And it was a well developed country, technologically superior to most of the world. Which meant the resources were there. Which meant that Rogers had prevented them from being used. Probably with some bullshit impassioned speech about them only needing each other, and how getting back to the good fight would cure James of everything that was bothering him. The type of shit that people ate up with a spoon, that usually made Tony want to vomit. He made a mental note to send Shuri a nice gift basket. A consolation prize for having to deal with Rogers’ conceit and self-aggrandizement.
“Doctor, actually. And yes.”
“I know.” Gentle fingers cupped his chin, stroked over his cheek. “And we got all of that unpleasantness out of the way yesterday, so today I can focus on giving you what you need. Which should be nice for both of us. Okay?”
"I don't understand."
“It turns out SHEILD only has access to one alpha high level enough to balance you out. Tony Stark.”
"Special? Different? Like you matter?" Tony slid off the edge of the couch and moved into Steve's space. He was a little taller than Tony, but it didn't seem to matter when he was this close. It made it hard to breathe. "Because you are. Because I take care of what's mine, and in my mind, that's what you are. Mine." Steve tried to swallow down a small whimper. It had been so long since anyone had wanted him for him. Not for his reputation, or his new body. Just him. Even longer since someone had wanted to take care of him. Not since he lived in Brooklyn with Bucky before the war. "Is- Is that a fact?"
He had thought about buying a cage before. After all, he enjoyed the play he did with a cock ring. But he was absolutely certain that he hadn’t done it. And even if he had, it wouldn’t have been something like this. The craftsmanship was perfect. The metal smooth and inviting him to run his fingertips over it. The locking mechanism was integrated somehow, because there was no sign of a padlock. If he put it on it would encase him completely, locking away his need until he was allowed to have it. And Steve wanted to put it on so badly…
That left him sitting at his desk, the same report in front of him that he'd been staring at for an hour, and the overwhelming urge to bang his head against the desk. At least it couldn't get any worse.
“Yeah? You want something, omega?” Tony gripped his hips, rolling up against the plug, buried where he desperately wanted to be.
He swallowed hard. "Are you going to put the cage back on...?"
Time lost all meaning. The only thing that existed was Tony's body under his hands, his cock throbbing in his mouth until he finally spilled down his throat. Steve swallowed around him, chasing the last drops with his tongue, lapping him clean as he pulled away.
A few minutes before seven, there was a sharp knock at his door. Steve opened it to see Tony leaning against the door frame holding a large bouquet of red roses. He slowly looked him over from top to bottom before meeting Steve's eyes with a grin. "You look good, Cap. Here, these are for you. Thought you might like 'em."
Steve felt sluggish, as though he was trying to move underwater, sinking deeper every moment. His limbs felt heavy and ungainly. He wasn’t sure if he could move if he tried. Somewhere far away he was still conscious of the hunger inside of him that never went away, but the call of omega-space was more insistent. So for once, Steve stopped fighting. He trust his alpha to keep him safe, and let the peaceful calm carry him away.
The websites Natasha sent him to were informative. They also had Steve turning ten different shades of red in the privacy of his bedroom. Apparently people were a lot more open about their sexuality than they had been in the forties. A lot more. And at least Steve had names for the things Tony had used on him and done to him.
He closed his eyes, let his head tilt back against the wall. "Yes..." Someone to let go with. To take care of him. To make him feel safe and special. "Yes, this is what I want."
Then nothing. The vibrator was still. He sobbed, tears running down his cheeks. His body ached, cock throbbing painfully. "No! Tony, please! No!"
I’m finally settling in somewhat at the new job. Or at least, training is mind numbingly dull, and I want to write fun stuff after. Same thing! Have some Tony feels to go along with last chapter’s Steve feels. Let me know what you think down in the comments, and if there’s anything you’d like to see either in this story or another one. Enjoy!
Steve gripped Tony's hip tightly with one hand, more to ground himself than to guide his movements, then slid the other up to wrap around him. He was already slick, leaking precum, and it was so easy to grip him tight, stroke him fast and desperate. Steve could feel him shudder, hear him moan. He felt the muscles gripping him even tighter before they began clenching around him over and over as Tony spilled over his fingers and chest. It was too much.
"I thought the point was it didn't get hard?"
Note: The slight DubCon warning only applies to Steve being observed without his knowledge while in privacy mode. This is not a rape or coercion fic.
“So polite, too. I love that in a sub.” Tony slid a hand beneath Steve’s body, cupping his dainty cock and squeezing hard. Pleasure shot up his spine from the sensation, causing him to arch and release against Tony’s fingers.
“That’s right, sweetheart. Feels good, doesn’t it? I bet you’re so tight and hot inside. Wrap around me so sweet I’d never want to leave. Is that what you want, Steve? Good boys do get rewarded, don’t they?”
“I’ll take care of you. I promise.”
Steve nodded miserably. "Yes..."
A pleased grin curved across Tony’s mouth. “Oh this is going to be fun. Roll over. On your back now, give me room to work.”
*           *           *
Sorry it’s been a little while since I posted! I was supposed to have a week vacation before starting my new job, but everything went crazy and I didn’t have time to write. I just started training, so I won’t have as much time to write as I did before, but I promise none of my fics are being dropped. It’ll just take a little longer for updates. Hang in there!
“Yes Sir. You seem distressed. Is there any way I can be of assistance?”
“Of course, Tony.”
He flushed even brighter as he obeyed, folding his arms behind his back and standing in front of Tony completely naked as the other man let his eyes roam over his body. He even stood and circled around Steve slowly, viewing him from every angle. "You're like a piece of art. So damned beautiful."
“Yes Sir.”
Something warm unfurled deep inside of him at the praise. Refusing to examine it too closely, Steve buried his face into Tony’s shirt instead. “Thank you.” He said quietly.
He raised up on his knees giving Steve some room. "Roll over for me."
"Good."
He also spent some time alone in the shower afterward. Tony hadn't told him not to touch himself after the last time or put him back in the cage. Which should mean that this was fine. Steve slowly relaxed under the hot spray, closed his eyes. He ran his hands over his pecs, brushed his nipples. Nice, but not as interesting as when Tony had played with them. Sucked and teased and put those metal clamps on them.
“Tony… Please, yes. You. Need you.”
“Don’t bother to pretend that you’re here for any reason other than being ordered to by SHIELD.”
Tony gripped his neck, letting the pressure calm him. “Such a good boy. Now, are you going to trust your alpha to know what you need from now on?”
“Fuck!” Tony crashed their mouths together, biting at his lips, hips grinding down against Steve’s thighs. “You asked for it, sweetheart. Remember that.” He levered himself off of Steve’s lap, dragging him up with the painful grip on his nipples before shoving him backwards towards the elevator. As soon as his back hit the wall, Tony was on him, hands running down his back over his ass, taking handfuls and gripping hard enough to bruise.
Tony nodded. "Alright. I'll try."
Steve woke up late the next morning, unsurprising after his struggle to fall asleep last night. He had tossed and turned for hours, body heating up every time he thought about how Tony had touched him, kissed him, casually ordered him around with every expectation that he would simply obey. And he had. Each time he had started to reach for himself, to put an end to his misery, he had remembered the way Tony's voice had sounded when he called him his good boy. He wanted to please Tony, so he waited.
He shook his head, clucking his tongue. “Not right now, Steve. I’m being nice to you. Taking care of you. Just let me.” Tony slowly finished washing Steve, letting the cloth stroke over his skin. Over and over until he was sensitive and squirming beneath the water, breath coming in soft pants. Finally Tony seemed satisfied. “Come on, stand up sweetheart. Have to get you dried off.”
"Thank you, Tony."
Steve groaned, burying his face in Tony's neck. "Tony..."
He stroked gentle fingertips over his cheek. "No. You should be thanking me. Now you don't have to struggle so hard to obey. It's not your choice anymore. Come on. Let’s get both of us cleaned up. I want you to stay here tonight."
Steve bowed his head obediently. This was exactly what he deserved. “Yes Tony. Thank you, Tony.”
"Okay, so I'm going to assume this is an aspect of the modern world that wasn't in the file SHEILD gave you. Look, some people still consider anything other than vanilla heterosexual lovemaking with the lights out taboo. But for the most part, the kink community is all about safety and consent. If you're both having a good time, there's nothing wrong with what you're doing."
Tony laughed again. “Alright, so you’ve taken your punishment. What would you like for your reward?”
“Director.”
A wicked chuckle rumbled against his throbbing flesh. “You think so, do you?”
"I..." He sighed. "I went to talk to him in his lab, after I found an entire art store up on my floor."
When they finally parted, Steve brushed a finger over his lower lip. It was swollen and tingling. He glanced up to see Tony watching him, possessiveness in his gaze, and immediately flushed a dark red. “Morning sweetheart. Did you sleep well?”
“Ouch!”
“Good.” Tony dived forward, sucking Steve’s soft cock into his mouth. He arched up with a cry from the firm, demanding pressure around him, hips starting to roll up in small movements. Tony slid a hand beneath him, fingers rubbing softly against Steve’s entrance. His body jerked back and forth between Tony’s hand and mouth, so overwhelmed with pleasure that it took him a while to figure out what was wrong. Despite how amazing it felt to have a warm, wet mouth wrapped around him, Steve’s cock was still soft and small. He could feel the pleasure building, his balls drawing closer to his body, his muscles trembling. Steve struggled desperately to hold back his release, wanting to be good for Tony. To follow the rules he had set. But the demanding touches proved to be too much for him to bear. He cried out as he fell over the edge, Tony swallowing the come that spilled into his mouth, fingers rubbing harder against Steve’s clenching entrance.
"Hmm..." Tony's gaze ran over him, and Steve could feel it, almost like a caress. "Well, I don't have anything I have to do today. You?"
“Yes alpha…” Tony felt dampness against his skin. Steve’s tears. “I’ll be good. I promise. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it. Anything you want.”
“Pretty baby. I know. It’s so hard. And I’m so mean.” He brushed his thumb across Steve’s cheek, wiping away a tear.
Tony’s arms wrapped around him securely, holding him close as he let the vibrators work on Steve’s helpless body. “Almost done, good boy. Now we just have to wait.”
Steve’s cock slowly softened over the course of the meal. By the time they were done eating, he was shifting uncomfortably in the restraints, hips moving back to gain pressure from the plug. When he realized what he was doing, his eyes flew to Tony. “What did you do to me? What did you give me?”
“Not surprised. The omega gland is here. It’s underdeveloped, it should be much bigger and softer, which explains why his biological urges aren’t functioning properly. That’ll take some work as well, but the good news is everything is fixable.”
“Of course, Dr. Stark.”
Steve rushed to comply, carelessly pulling off his t-shirt and sweatpants, tearing them a little in his impatience. Tony took them from him, carrying them across the workspace and locking them in a drawer. The act of dominance made him shiver, the first trickle of moisture sliding from his hole. They both knew that if Steve wanted he could simply go upstairs and get something else to wear. That wasn’t the point. His alpha wanted him naked, had taken his clothes away and locked them up. So he would stay naked.
And a mystery magician! Who only Bruce can contact. If you'd like to see this story spread out to include some of the other characters, or maybe a one shot in the same universe for Bruce, let me know!
"Thank you. Oh, Tony, please."
The bed shifted as he moved away, rustling sounds from inside the closet, then the sound of footsteps moving back towards the bed. A drawer opening and closing, more rustling. Then the bed was dipping under his weight again, the heat of his body close enough to feel without touching. "How about we try nice this morning? Want me to be sweet to you?"
Steve ground down harder against the machine Tony had been watching him ride for the last half hour. The vibrations against the plug he was filled with and the cage he was wearing were driving him crazy. Just as he thought he would finally fall over the edge, the machine stilled. He let his head fall forward, a frustrated whine leaving his throat. “Tony… Come on. Please?”
Tony rubbed firmly against the first gland, trying to break up the accumulated toxins. Steve howled, jerking against the restraints, tears quickly spilling down his face. Tony felt bad for him, but knew that it needed to be done. He tried to work quickly, forcing the gland to release. It took nearly half an hour before it spasmed beneath his fingertips and softened. A flood of slick dripped down his hand as he removed his fingers. “See honey, one done. We’ll take a little break now, okay?”
That being said, there is the possibility that if they keep going the route they’re on that this story will turn into Steve/Tony/Bucky. I do love me some Bucky Barnes, and he’s just so sad and broken at this point. Stupid Civil War.
“So why didn’t he just leave you alone?”
“My pleasure. Let me know if anything on your uniform needs worked on. Don’t want anything to happen to you.”
Steve smiled. For as possessive and demanding as he could be, Tony could also be amazingly tender. "Thanks."
He shook his head. "No. I'm fine. It's just a lot..."
“If I’m going to react that badly, maybe we should just skip it?” He tried to keep from panting as Tony began to toy with his sensitive nipples, pinching them to hardness.
Steve shudders, rocking up against Tony’s weight. He can feel his alpha’s cock start hardening against him. “Tony… Please…”
"Okay?"
“Y-yes Tony…”
“Supposed to be that way?” Tony finished, watching him nod miserably. “It’s okay, sweet omega. I’m going to take care of you.”
“You are most welcome, sweetheart.” Tony led him to the center of the room, buckled his wrists into sturdy leather cuffs attached to a long chain. Once they were secure, a spreader bar was fastened between his ankles, leaving his legs spread impossibly wide. A small hook on the floor was attached to the bar, anchoring it securely to the floor, before Tony moved to a control panel on the wall. The press of a button drew the chain up towards the ceiling, only stopping once Steve was spread out and helpless to move in any direction. When he realized how vulnerable the position left him, Steve began to whimper softly, tears already welling up in his eyes at what was to come.
Tony's arms slid around him, drawing him back into his body, and Steve happily snuggled into him. "Blindfold off, or on for a little longer?"
Long moments of silence stretched as Steve turned it over in his mind. Then James’ earlier words sank in. “Wait a minute! What do you mean, a couple?”
“And what’s dis experience, cher? Have ah seen it yet? Dere gonna be dancing girls and a light show?”
He could feel his cheeks heating up again. It was a ridiculous, over the top gesture. But at the same time, some dark secret corner of his heart was pleased by the attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright. Have at it.” Tony grinned. “I’ll tell you when to stop.”
“You’re not gonna take the cage off, are you…?”
“I-it’s evil…”
Instead Steve rolled out of bed and padded into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth, noticing that the toothbrush he’d used before was still sitting out. He dug through the drawers until he found a comb, and winced through taming the knots in his hair. When he finished, he could smell the tempting aroma of coffee, and followed it into the living room.
"Yes. Once."
"Good night, Tony." Eventually, Tony's breathing evened and slowed. It was a long time before Steve fell asleep.
“That was the plan.”
“Tony…?” Steve peered up at him from beneath his lashes, pleading with his eyes for relief.
Tony gently rubbed over his back, stroked his hair. “It’s alright, sweetheart. I’m going to take care of you. Give you what you need. I promise, you can trust me, Steve.”
Natasha limped back to the rest of the group as Tony landed the armor, uniform dripping ooze onto the ground. "Good call, Cap. Because if I don't get a shower right fucking now, I'm gonna kill someone."
Steve moaned, arching off the bed, hips rocking up into the air. Tony had thought about this. Fantasized about it. Built toys with his own hands in the hopes of being able to use them on him. "Tony... God, Tony... You... How long...?"
Steve flushed under the older man's intense gaze. "I know..."
Steve didn’t have a chance to do more than glance around the opulent bedroom he found himself in on the other side of the portal. As soon as the last of the orange light had disappeared, he was pinned against the wall by a force field. No matter how much he struggled against it, Steve was unable to move an inch. His position gave him a clear view of the door. As soon as it opened, his breath caught in his chest.
Steve glared up at him. “And what’s that?”
Steve pasted on a false smile, walked to the older Alpha’s side. Being that close to him was torture. Tony smelled woodsy, rich and decadent, and the scent would linger on Steve’s skin for hours, making him ache inside. Of course he never responded to Steve as an omega. Only a teammate, maybe a friend at best. Of course not. Tony Stark was known for only having the best. He’d never choose a broken omega who had the body of an alpha.
Tears slipped down Steve’s face as Tony worked him roughly, fueling the ache in his core that never truly went away. “You said… You said it would feel good!”
“Really now? I thought you would be grateful for a break after how long it’s been. You really love it, don’t you?”
Stay safe out there!
"Tony?"
Steve snarled, straining against the collar. “I wasn’t fucking abused!”
Steve had been put on black market suppressants from a young age, which probably influenced the developmental issues Tony had noted earlier. He’d been a part of a small group that had slowly been taken into custody one by one for rehabilitation. Steve was the last hold out. It was going to be a lot of work to correct the imbalances in his physiology and the mental strain he’d been operating under for so long. But once he was broken in… He’d be glorious.
Tony's lips curled up in an evil smirk. "Do you want to be, Steve?"
Steve nods, fighting down an unexpected lump in his throat. “I know. Or at least, I do now.”
“Tony!” Steve squeezed his eyes close, feeling his skin heat with embarrassment. They flew open again at a hard pinch and pinpricks of pain in his nipple, just in time to watch Tony fasten the other sharp toothed clamp to his chest. He panted, trying to get on top of the pain, feeling it almost like a warmth spreading out through his body, heating his blood and stoking his arousal. Each breath jostled the clamps, drawing his attention back, refusing to allow him to settle beneath the sensation. He writhed uncontrollably, rocking his hips against Tony’s body, searching for even a hint of friction where he needed it.
He couldn’t stop screaming as the machines continued working over him. Every breath seemed to center the burning on that single spot. His omega gland. It had to be. He could almost feel it swelling inside his passage, robbing him of the ability to focus on anything else. Each time he thought he’d gotten on top of the sensations, his alpha adjusted one of the dials, and he spiraled away again.
"Thank you, Tony."
“What?” He looked up in confusion. Tony’s expression was calm and implacable.
“If I have to tell you, you’re getting spanked before we’re done, omega.”
"And now, I have the time to figure out what it is I like. An amazing man in my life who is willing to help me figure it out. Who takes care of me in a way I never would have let someone before, when I was angry and had something to prove."
“Do you want me to take care of you? Make it go away?” Bucky nodded against Steve’s neck, comforting himself with the soft scent of vanilla and honey that seemed to cling to his skin. “Alright sweetheart. I know what to do. You just hold onto Steve right now. I’m going to give you what you need. But I want you to know that this isn’t a punishment. I’m not trying to hurt you, alright?”
Slick sounds caught his attention, and he glanced over his shoulder to see Tony thrusting into his own fist and coming, felt the wet heat splatter across his back. Steve groaned, burying his face in the blankets, hips still rocking futilely. Tony began soothing over his back, kneading the muscles. Rubbing his come into Steve's skin.
“They… They claim them.”
"Smart ass." He lightly slapped the cage, causing Steve to moan. "Was it difficult?"
“Why not?”
"Morning sweetheart. How do you feel?"
“Tony, Tony, no, please! I can’t. I need… I need more. I need you.”
Tony buried himself deep, knot stretching Steve wide, locking them together. He spilled over the alpha’s fingers with a cry, clenching around the cock inside of him. He felt the tingling burn as the alpha’s come flooded into him, absorbing into the delicate tissues of his passage, hormones filling him and bonding them even more closely together. Over time Steve would become dependent on his alpha for the chemicals his body produced. Most likely had already begun to, due to the years of deficiency and his reliance on suppressants to carry him through.
“Need you inside of me. Please.”
It felt so good to come back to the tower. To have a real home to come back to. One where people missed him and were glad to see him. And if he had happened to go downstairs to Tony’s workshop to see the other man before he even went up to his floor to shower, it was just because Tony was a friend, as well as benefactor, and he wanted to show that he was grateful for everything the team was provided with. Nothing else. Of course.
"Just what I like to hear. Come on." He slid his fingers through Steve's, gently tugging him along to the bedroom. Tony took his time, stripping off his clothes, examining every inch of smooth skin revealed to him. Once Steve was naked, Tony guided him over to the foot of the bed, bending him over it, leaving him exposed to the room. "Yeah, just like that. Such a good boy."
“Tony… God yes, please. Need it. Need you.”
“Tony! No, please. Don’t stop. Please don’t stop.”
“I can hear you two. See you. I know you know that.” He waited for Tony to nod before continuing. It was a mission report, nothing more. All he had to do was state the facts. Tony was in control, he would decide what happened after that. There was a freedom in the surrender. The situation being taken out of his hands. “My body… Responded. I didn’t… Remember that happening. I started to touch it… And I remembered. They trained me. An asset doesn’t have needs. It was like I could feel it all over again.” Bucky lowered his head, stared at his hands, flesh and metal, tangled up together. “I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.”
James’ voice was a dry croak. “Watch. Please.”
“And you’ll let me take care of you?”
Impossibly long lashes fluttered for a moment before he was pined by intense dark eyes. It felt almost like they could see into his soul. See the desperation and longing there. “Hi.”
“You are so fucking sweet, babydoll. You know that?” Tony scraped his teeth over the bond mark, smiling wickedly as Steve shuddered. “So pretty and helpless for me. You’d do just about anything I asked if I’d give you my cock. Wouldn’t you sweetheart?”
Having decided what he would be putting his pet through next, he ordered Steve to wait for him in the bedroom before returning to the lab to assemble the supplies he would need. When he returned to the bedroom, a pretty sight was waiting for him. Steve was on his knees in the center of the carpet, head bowed and arms folded behind his back. Tony took a moment to enjoy the sight before alerting him to his presence. “Such a pretty boy I have. Up on the bed now. On your hands and knees, facing the headboard. And I want those thighs wide. I won’t ask you again.”
"I'm not asking for much, sweetheart. It can't be that hard. Or is your greedy little hole too stretched out to keep it in?"
The phone slipped from Steve’s grip, sliding across the floor as his body writhed and jerked from the nearly painful pleasure, ratcheting higher and higher until with a scream he came soft, still locked inside of his cage. And it didn’t stop. The vibrations fluctuated, driving him through oversensitivity without allowing him to become numb to the sensations. Forcing his body over the edge again and again until there was nothing left to give and the torment finally stopped.
"Umm... Uhh... Yes?"
“I’m sorry. I…”
“I know, Steve. But you gotta understand. Bruce loves me. And I love him. I don’t wanna go anywhere. I’m happy where I am.”
“What? But I’m… You…”
“Well that doesn’t sound right. I can’t imagine any version of Steve Rogers that doesn’t run headlong into a fight and somehow come out on top.”
Tony’s knot slowly expanded within him, popping in and out, stretching his rim over the bulge, until it was large enough to lock them together. It grew wider, pressing relentlessly on his gland, the pressure maddening. He flailed, unable to hold still, felt Tony pin him to the mattress. Higher and higher until a spasm ran through his body and he was coming, harder and longer than he had in his entire life. The thick cock splitting him open, deeper than he imagined anything could be inside of him, finally satiating the need that had been driving him for so long. He felt it pulse, could feel the heat of Tony’s come filling him, soothing the last of the ache in his core.
“Such a good boy. That’s right, honey. Put on a show for me.”
He shrugged. “Well, I mean, it’s not like I couldn’t… And you didn’t specifically tell me not to…”
"If I wanted excuses, I'd ask for them. You know what to do if it's too much, or too far. You didn't safe word. You chose to ignore me. Didn't even try to ask, like a good boy."
“Tony…?”
Tony gripped Steve’s wrist, squeezing hard and jerking his hand away. “Enough.” Dark eyes flashed up at him, and Steve felt the pit of his stomach drop. “Trying to push me, omega? See what I’ll let you get away with?”
“Now that we have him taken care of for the moment, I think it’s your turn gorgeous. Can you hold position, or do you want me to tie you down?”
Tony kept him handcuffed, insisting that he needed to stay in bed and rest while he took care of breakfast. It wasn’t difficult to get Steve to agree. He felt fragile, a little breakable. Everything had changed so quickly, and all of that was overwhelming him as soon as he was left alone. Steve rolled over, burying his face in Tony’s pillow, inhaling the scent of his alpha, letting it calm him. By the time Tony came back with a breakfast tray, Steve no longer felt like he would burst into tears at any moment.
It was sentimental of him, but Bucky took the time to walk through Brooklyn before he went to Stark’s tower. Visit the places that used to mean something to him, try to remember his life before. His family. All the little things that had made him Bucky Barnes instead of the Asset. He knew there was a death sentence waiting for him, had avoided it for long enough. Hell, Steve had let the world burn to try to stop it. But he was done. Just didn’t have enough fight left in him anymore.
"Language, sweetheart."
Steve didn’t know what he had done wrong, but it was breaking his heart. It had been two weeks since Tony had appeared on his floor long enough to push a semi-recovered and still very much alive Bucky at him and disappeared. The first several days of that time were spent comforting his oldest friend and helping him acclimate to the new world around them. It was after that Steve realized something was wrong.
Remy turned into his shoulder, nipped at his jaw. “Show me what you got, big man.”
Steve buried his face deeper in the comforter, feeling his hips rocking back to meet each smack. Soft keening sounds escaped his throat. The gentle spanking went on and on, until Steve was on the edge of release. That’s when Tony stopped, fingers still against his entrance, feeling it pulse and squeeze against them.
Steve shook his head, wondering once again how he always knew exactly what Steve was doing and thinking.
“Alpha…”
“So pretty for me, honey. You stay right there. I want to get a few things that I think will drive you out of your mind.”
"Good morning, sweetheart."
Sorry it's been a few days since the last update, but I'm back! A whole chapter of smut, kink, and breadcrumbs of plot. Enjoy, and feel free to let me know what you think in the comments. Stay safe out there!
“It will. But we’ve got to get you there, honey. And that might take a while. Do I need to tie you down? Give you something to struggle against? Or do you need my cock in that sweet hole of yours?”
Steve's hands were shaking as he fumbled for the small device, taking a moment to slow his own breathing. When he pressed the power button, the sudden vibrations against his prostate almost made his knees give out. "Tony..."
“And you keep calling me alpha. Do you mean it? Do you see me like that?”
He shook his head. "Didn't need to. God you're fucking mean."
Steve closed his eyes, listening to the sounds of Tony preparing whatever treatment he would be inflicting. Straining to figure out what could be responsible for making each one. Icy metal slid into his passage, began to pry him open. Steve recognized the feel of a speculum at this point, however he’d never been forced quite so wide by one before. Even as the tool cranked him open further, Steve felt the vibrations wring another release from his spent body, passage trying to clench tight around the intruding object. Once he was spread out impossibly wide, he heard the click of the catch, holding it open.
“No… I’m sorry, alpha. I didn’t meant to. I…”
Steve was eager to answer. Wanting so much to please that he didn’t see how easily he was being manipulated into agreeing to his own torture. “I don’t need to rest. I can do this all day.”
“You’ve been neglected for a long time, sweetheart. It’s going to be hard for quite a while. But I’m here. I’m going to make it better, alright?”
Steve nodded obediently, allowing himself to be guided to a table. He couldn’t stay still, writhing against the hard wooden seat, even as he devoured the food that was set in front of him. Tony sat across from him, eating his own breakfast as he watched Steve struggle. He seemed pleased rather than annoyed. After they had both finished and Tony downed the last of his coffee, Steve was led down to Tony’s workshop.
They ate breakfast sitting on the overstuffed sofa, which provided Steve with a welcome respite from the plug and allowed him to focus enough to eat. "Thank you, Tony. This is very good."
“I know. Turn over, sweetheart. Flat on the bed, there’s a good boy.”
"Please, Tony?"
“Yeah.” He purred softly, pleased and content. “Thank you for my punishment, alpha.”
When Steve did wake, his first instinct was to ascertain his range of movement. For the first time since the exam that was performed when he was taken into custody, Steve was completely restrained. His eyes flew open, darting around the unfamiliar room. White walls and shining metal gleaming from every surface. Glancing down, he could see that his torso and every limb were held to an oddly shaped frame with thick steel manacles. He struggled against them with every bit of strength he possessed and was unable to even twitch. Even his head was held in place with a band just below his hairline. The only exception was his neck, which made him feel further exposed.
"Yeah..."
Tony motioned him over to the ratty couch in the corner, pushing him back to sit as soon as he reached it. Steve didn’t know what to expect, but Tony dropping to his knees in front of him wasn’t it. “FRIDAY, keep track. I’m going to see how many times my pretty little omega is capable of releasing in a day.” He had the audacity to wink up at Steve. “Give us a record to break.”
Tony had been expecting to be overwhelmed by the scent of multiple omegas. As opposed to other facilities he’d been in, the air was neutral. Most likely owing to an efficient filtration system. It was pleasant. He wouldn’t have to attempt to filter scents if he found an intriguing option. A slim man in a well tailored suit was waiting in the foyer. “Mr. Stark?”
When Tony spoke his voice was silky and cultured in a way Steve had never heard before. “Steven Grant Rogers. Captain America. You look good for a dead man.” He tilted his head, studying him. “And I know you died. I was there. As a matter of fact, I killed the man responsible. I don’t like it when other people touch my things. And I always intended for you to be mine. I just needed time to… Convince you. So tell me, who are you really?”
As soon as Steve was standing by the foot of the bed, Tony moved away. He could hear some rustling behind him, and then something was being slid down over his eyes. It was a blindfold, soft and silky, and leaving him defenseless in the darkness it created. "If you don't like it, we'll take it off." Tony's voice was a husky murmur right against his ear. "But a lot of people do. It makes it easier, if you're... Shy. And it makes the sensations more intense. Easier for me to wreck you tonight."
Please don’t hate me! It’ll get better!
Steve took a shaky breath, leaning up to capture Tony's lips with his own. "I can't believe you experimented on yourself." He said, pouting slightly.
“Want you. Just you, Tony.”
Tony moved back to where James was waiting, taking him by the hand and leading him to a comfortable chair near where Steve was restrained. Once he was seated, Tony grinned. He did love putting on a show. “Well, James? Are you ready to see what you’ve won?”
"Okay, big guy. No worries. I didn't exactly have plans of running back to the tower and sharing everything I saw here tonight." Tony snorted. "Not that Fury would likely believe it anyway."
What? Two whole chapters without smut? Who am I and what has happened to me?
Steve took a slow breath, almost afraid to read what his Sir had to say to him after that performance.
“And how does an alpha claim their omega?” His voice had dropped lower, almost to a growl, and Steve shivered at the sound, felt himself start getting wet.
Steve burrowed down into the pile of pillows, pulling the soft blanket even tighter around his body. No matter how hard he tried, sleep eluded him. Too much had happened that day, and he was still reeling from it. He tried again to get comfortable in the nest he had built from all of the things that Stark- no, Tony, he reminded himself- had left for him. Everything was far nicer than what he’d had access to in the past, and Steve should have felt safe and cherished. But he didn’t.
Brought to you by another night of the insomnia special. I really should stop writing quite so much when I'm tired and grumpy, I tend to take my frustrations out on poor Steve. I promise I'll be nice to him eventually. I hope you enjoy. Comments make me extremely happy and a more prolific writer.
"Yes, Sir."
"And did you like it?"
Tony smiled, holding him close. "I know. I'm a cruel sadist who loves to watch you suffer. Good thing you like it so much."
“But… I don’t have any clothes…”
It was late afternoon before Steve came back to himself enough to be aware of his surroundings. His body felt soft, still wrung out and tender from earlier, but the endless frustrating need that had haunted him since he presented was finally quiet. He stretched out his stiff muscles, pleased to realize that Tony had removed the restraints at some point. Steve rolled over, pressing his face against the other man’s thigh. Tony was still leaning back against the headboard, fiddling with various things on his tablet. He carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, smiling down at him.
Tony rolled to his side, stretching casually before propping himself up on an elbow to gaze down at Steve with a wicked smile. “I’m sorry, sweetheart, but you were naughty earlier. Your punishment for that was having your implant set to ruin for the day. If you’re a good boy, maybe I’ll let you have a real orgasm tomorrow.”
When he drew back, Steve felt a bit light and floaty, curling into Tony's warmth. Strong hands stroked over his sides, bringing him back to the present. "Such a good boy for me. So generous. Would you like to come, baby?"
He squeezed his eyes closed, could almost hear the sound of the trap swinging shut behind him. “What’s the price, Tony?”
Two fingers returned, wet but not slippery from lube, and began rubbing into his hole, barely dipping inside to cover him completely. It felt like a thick cream, he decided, as more and more was rubbed into him. His rim fluttered under the attention, squeezing around the fingers when they pressed in. The skin tingled a little at first, then grew increasingly more and more numb, until he could barely feel the touches against him. Steve shifted restlessly in his bonds as the fingers pressed deeper, rubbing firmly against his prostate, disappearing and returning with more and more cream, until that became numb as well.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony waited, watching him. When Steve didn’t move, he pressed another series of buttons. This time the dildo began to vibrate, sending Steve scrambling for a way to escape the overwhelming combination. He writhed, moaned, struggled, and sobbed. All to no avail. Tony watched him with the eyes of a predator, opening his pants and stroking over the length of his cock, as Steve fell apart before him. Steve wasn’t sure if he was working separate releases from him, or a single never ending climax. It didn’t matter. None of it would stop until his alpha was ready for it to. Steve had promised to do anything. And it had succeeded. Even now, Tony seemed more alive and engaged then he had in days.
“It was. Not a lot of people come through the enhanced branch, you know? Thought I was gonna be there forever. And I couldn’t get out on my own. Saw some alpha’s come through, but I guess I wasn’t what most of ‘em were looking for. Then Bruce came.” A sweet smile curled his lips, as though he were happy about the memory. It was disturbing.
Tony started massaging his chest, teasing and playing with his neglected nipples not wanting to completely overwhelm him until the end. He worked him up to an easy release using both fingers and mouth, pulling back to watch Steve shudder through the aftermath of his eighth ruined orgasm. Once he was hanging limp and spent in his bonds, Tony pulled a set of nipple clamps from his pocket, carefully placing one and allowing it to snap closed, cruelly pinching the flesh, before moving to the other side. As he finished, James began whimpering behind him.
Tony nodded. “I know him. He’s a good guy. Usually doesn’t have good luck with relationships, though.”
Steve moaned against his mouth, writhing against him. He could feel Tony pressing down harder against his lap. Could feel the hard shape of him through the suit pressing into him. He shuddered and moaned again, wanting more, wanting everything.
"Now. Kitchen. Think you can manage this time?"
“Yes Tony.”
"Oh fuck."
"You are so good to me. Come here, sit down. You look good. Did you get some rest after I left?"
I have no plans for that to occur in any of my other stories, or for that to be a common pairing that I write. I know it’s not listed in the tags, if the relationship takes a turn towards sexual or romantic, they will be updated. I hope you continue reading, and approach this fic with an open mind.
The elevator came to a smooth stop, the doors sliding open to reveal the penthouse, lights low and inviting. Tony stepped out onto the floor then came to an sudden halt. Standing in the center of the room was one Steven Grant Rogers.
"Yes, Sir." When the door opened, Steve obediently walked to the chair, neatly folding his clothes, and clasping his hands together when he finished. He heard a variety of strange noises from the room behind him, but resisted the urge to look. Tony would take care of him, give him exactly what he needed. And he would be good for him.
“You are most welcome, Captain.” Steve went to the elevator, confused. He didn’t remember ordering anything, but there was the package with his name typed neatly on the front. He pulled out a pocket knife and neatly sliced through the tape before opening the flaps. And immediately slapped them shut.
Sensing a possible weakness, Steve gave the alpha his full attention. Maybe it could help him get out of this place. “No, what were you going to say?”
A strong hand slid into his hair, firmly tugging his head down. His lips were on Steve's again, but this time they weren't gentle or patient. This was desire and need. Powerful enough to make his knees go weak. He clung to Tony and allowed him to ravage his mouth. Whimpered and chased after his lips when he pulled away. Another soft kiss, and Tony was pulling back. He brushed the backs of his fingers against Steve's cheek, similar to the way Steve had woken him earlier.
Steve pressed a gentle kiss to his alpha’s lips. “I love you too, Tony.”
"You're a smart boy. Figure it out."
Steve nodded, staring hard at his lap, afraid of the answer. Callused fingers slid beneath his chin, tilting his gaze up until their eyes could meet. “Growing up, I was never fond of Captain America. Everyone always had too much to say about him. Then I met you. And I can’t imagine a world where I wasn’t in love with Steve Rogers. I love you. Just you. Exactly as you are.”
Tony was setting out plates of yet another fancy breakfast dish that Steve didn’t recognize, but it smelled wonderful. His stomach gave an unhappy rumble, reminding him that he’d eaten very little yesterday. Two mugs of coffee were already on the table. One black, the other a light caramel color. He slowly picked up the cup with cream and sugar added, watching Tony for his reaction. All he received was a soft smile as he took his first sip.
It was like the vibrator Tony had put on his cage, less cruel but just as effective. His skin felt stretched too tight over his body, cock leaking profusely beneath him. The skin beneath Tony's tongue became oversensitive and swollen driving him crazy, building him higher, pushing him so close to the edge that he was sobbing from the pleasure. "Tony! Tony, please! Please! So close, I'm so close! Don't stop, please don't stop!"
“You’re welcome, sweetheart. Now, why don’t you just lay there and look pretty for me while I relax for a bit, hmm? I’ll even get you more comfortable.” Tony carefully shifted him over, releasing and refastening the shackles, fussing over the chains and adjusting the length until he was on his back, spread wide and helpless. “How’s that baby? Better?”
Tony leaned down, pressed a soft kiss to the top of Steve’s head. “You don’t know how to fix it, do you? Which is why I’m here. You weren’t taking care of my omega today. Which is why once you’ve healed, and had something to eat, I’m going to punish you. And I’m going to do it after each and every mission where you are reckless and careless with my sweet boy. Understand?”
“Then what’s all this? Why do you smell miserable?”
The bath done, he dried off and rubbed a sweet-smelling lotion that Pepper had brought him into every inch of skin he currently had access to. He took special care to make sure the cage was properly cleaned and dried. Tony wanted him to wear it, had made it with his own hands in the hopes that Steve would someday, it was important that he showed how much that meant to him by taking good care of it.
2016 – Somewhere in Wakanda
Tony had taken training his omega very seriously. After Steve had finally given in and adapted to the cage as well as regular tightening, Tony had made it his mission to ensure every gland was worked thoroughly several times a day. He wanted Steve to be in the best health, but also to release from the barest pressure. And it worked.
He shook his head. "No. I'm up now, I won't be able to get back to sleep. Besides... It's not the same if you're not there."
As soon as they stepped inside, Tony began digging soft fuzzy blankets and a mountain of pillows out of various closets before carrying them all to the guest room beside his. He tossed them onto the bed, disappearing only to return with a few pairs of oversized track pants and t-shirts that looked like they should fit the other man. This Steve seemed to be a little slimmer that the other one.
Needy whimpers slipped from his throat as Tony’s hands smoothed over his skin, trying to soothe. “Such a good boy for me.” Gentle kisses were placed against his skin as he was freed from the restraints and gathered into strong arms. He burrowed into Tony’s chest, clinging tightly to his skin, a confused mess of pain, agony, and want.
"Good... Did I win?"
"Don't worry. I'll take care of it. This is what's going to happen. We are going to finish breakfast, then you are going to go take a hot bath, for at least an hour. When you get out, you're going to relax, read or watch tv, until I come get you. And then I am going to make sure you don't have a single thought in your head for the rest of the day. How's that sound?"
“But… When? How?”
Steve watched him from beneath his lashes, still curled tightly in on himself and away from Tony’s touch. “What’d you say?”
He hummed happily as he was carried into the bathroom and lowered into the softly scented water. It was hot, penetrating his sore muscles and easing away the ache. Tony eased into the tub behind him, and he snuggled back against him. Steve gripped Tony’s wrists, pulling his arms forward and wrapping them tightly around him.
Steve nodded hesitantly, unsure of what was going to happen next. He watched Tony move back across the workshop, in direct view at all times, which made something inside of him relax. Tony wouldn’t hurt him. His alpha would keep him safe.
Steve finally allowed himself to relax, leaning against Tony's shoulder once everyone had settled inside the tower to wait for dinner. Loki was curled up against Bruce's side, in careful conversation with Thor, who didn't seem to care who Loki's lover was, only that he was being treated well. He closed his eyes, knowing that Tony would continue to keep an eye on the situation.
"That's right. You can do it. Again, baby. Come for me again."
Steve reached under the bed, pulling out a medium sized container, and set it on the blanket before stripping out of his sleep pants. He took his time, crawling onto the bed, making sure to give Tony the view he had requested, finally stretching out on his back so he could see the older man's face. "Yes, Tony?"
Steve groaned, letting his head fall back against the pillow. The bed shifted and settled as Tony reached for something on the nightstand. There was a click, followed by slick sounds. Tony’s fingers were suddenly between his cheeks, rubbing insistently against his rim, coating it in a thick gel before pressing inside. A gasp tore from his lips. Everywhere the gel touched immediately started to throb with need. Steve tried to grind down, force the fingers deeper, but Tony resisted. Instead his touches remained shallow, thoroughly working his entrance and the slick glands just inside.
Steve pressed closer to Tony, desire molten in his veins. He couldn’t imagine lying in bed beside the other man, waiting for his body to calm down and allow him some rest. Anything had to be better than that, right? “I want the second one.”
Just as he was about to explode, he managed to gasp out a warning. “Sir! I can’t- I’m going to-!”
“Great. Perfect. JARVIS, add it to the list.”
Steve buried his face in the blankets and groaned.
"Good. You've seemed kind of stressed lately. I'm glad you're feeling better."
“Hmm. I’ll remember that. Don’t worry. This part won’t take long. And then you’ll have other things to worry about.”
"Yes..." A trail of fire was moving down his stomach, over his thighs, close enough to for him to draw in a worried breath, but not touching the cage.
Instead of getting angry, Tony tilted his head to the side, studying Steve with curiosity. “Is that what this is about? Now you’re mad because you think I don’t want you?” Steve turned his head to the side, fighting back the sob that tried to break free at the words. “Oh honey. You should have come to me. Any time you need comfort or reassurance, that’s what you do. That’s what I’m here for. I could have taken care of you. Been nice and sweet.”
“You gonna be a good boy?”
“I’m sorry, Tony.” Tears were beginning to well up in the corners of his eyes.
"I tend to make snap decisions."
"Oh yes. By the time I'm done with you, you'll be begging to go back in the cage."
Steve shook his head. “No. Not if you don’t want to. I’ll… I’ll do anything you want. I just…”
The sound of Tony’s hand stroking himself increased in speed, his breathing becoming more labored. “Then I would have fucked you all night long. Let you come until you were spent, and locked you up nice and sweet before bed. That’s what you would have gotten if you’d been good.” Another groan, then Steve felt hot streaks of come striping his back, slowly sliding down his skin. “Fuck, that’s better. Now I can focus on you.”
"As many times as you want."
(See the end of the chapter for
Post-Endgame
Steve’s gaze drops, unable to look at the other man’s face as he answers. “No. Before the serum, I wasn’t even a beta. I was just a null.” He swallows the lump in his throat as Tony’s hands pet soothingly over his back. “I think… I was just too sick to develop right.”
“You are so welcome, Steve.”
Neither of them moved, content to linger, trading soft kisses. Tony eventually slipped out of him, moving to the side and pulling him into his arms. Gentle fingers stroked through his hair, and Steve sighed, relaxing into the touch.
Steve felt even more foolish several days later. Ever since he’d confronted Tony, the alpha had seemed to lose interest in him. Meals were quiet, without any attempt at conversation. The alpha usually disappeared into his workshop for a few hours in the afternoon, leaving Steve to his own devices. And he hadn’t taken his pleasure from Steve’s body for the last several days. Which should have been a relief, but between the plug and the cage, Steve was unable to find release on his own. By the fourth afternoon, Steve was beside himself with desperation.
“How nice is that, honey? You come on command. Tell me, does it work the other way? Can I stop you with a word?” Steve couldn’t breathe, couldn’t speak, just nodded, showing his alpha what kind of power he had over him. “Oh honey… You really shouldn’t have told me that.”
Tony was pressed against his side, he could smell his rich cologne, and his hand rested casually on Steve's thigh. As he watched, it began to slowly slide up and down, almost as though Tony was trying to soothe him. Put him at ease. If that was the goal, it was definitely not working. However, a glance at those dark amused eyes told him that was the point.
"Yes. Yes, I do. Anything Tony. Anything."
Tony tilted his head, concern written on his features. "It really scares you, doesn't it?"
She smiled. "I'm glad. Look, I first met Antoshka during a really bad time for him. He's been through a lot. And so have you. If you find something that makes you happy in this fucked up world, my advice is to grab it and hold on with both hands."
After Doom’s slow, painful, and extremely public death, few were willing to cross Tony. It made it so much easier for him to crush the last pockets of resistance and solidify his claim on the world. At this point, everything was running so smoothly it took little effort to keep it that way. Between the hold of Extremis 3.0 on the population and his Iron Sight program, no one could step out of line without him being instantly alerted. And if he didn’t feel like dealing with the problem personally… Well, that’s what his army was for.
“Please, Tony. It hurts. I can’t… I can’t wait that long. Please.” Tears prickled the corners of his eyes. This wasn’t fair. He was claimed. He had an alpha. He was supposed to be able to enjoy it.
When he leaned back slightly in Tony’s arms, he felt his regular plug shift inside of him. His gland was no longer numb, throbbing madly from the pressure of metal against it. He cried out, grip tightening on the other man’s shirt, pulling him closer.
“It’s an honor, Sir. I’m Phil Coulson, we spoke via the system last night. You mentioned you needed a more durable omega to fulfill your needs?”
When Tony finally spoke, his voice was low and gravelly. “Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep well?”
"Well... There is one thing... Extremis. It's made you a lot stronger, right?"
“Alpha, I…” He couldn’t finish the sentence, dropped to his knees instead, crawling to the side of the bed closest to Tony.
Tony grinned. "Oh, I will. I've been thinking about that for days. But I want us both to be clearheaded enough to enjoy it when it happens. Besides, half the fun is watching you squirm waiting for it."
"No... No, please, Tony. I'll be good. I promise. I need it. So much."
"Yeah, Steve. I was gonna unlock you tonight."
“Shh… It’s okay sweetheart. It’s over. It’s over now.”
Steve smiled. "I know. You take good care of me though."
Apparently his fascination with Captain America had survived their last encounter. And Tony was fairly certain that the new and improved Steve Rogers would probably be over the moon if he knew that Tony wanted him. Stupid meddling sorcerer.
"So beautiful..." Steve shifted beneath him, started to sit up. Tony's grip turned hard, pushing him back against the mattress and holding him there. "Not a chance, baby. You told me what you wanted, now it's my turn to give it to you. Now be a good boy and hand me that bottle of lube under the pillow."
“Okay. Then that’s what we’ll do.” Tony moved away and Steve’s skin instantly felt cold. He must have let out some sound of distress, because the other man immediately began to soothe and praise him. “Such a good boy for me, taking your punishment so well. Just a little bit more now.”
“T-Tony… Tony, please?”
“I…” He trembled in Tony’s arms, curling closer.
When Steve woke, fuzzy and disoriented, the first thing he felt was Tony’s body wrapped tightly around his own. He turned, curling tighter into his embrace. A bottle of water was pressed to his lips, and he drank greedily until his throat was no longer too dry for speech. “Tony?”
Natasha saw him when he got back to the tower and immediately dragged him up to her floor for vodka and gossip. The second she got him on her couch, she was dropping down next to him and demanding answers. "Okay, Steve. Spill."
Articles about the mistreatment of omega’s quickly lead him to information pertaining to suppressants. They were highly illegal and difficult to obtain. There were no companies that produced them, therefore those who bought them were reliant on whatever formula was available in their area. The side effects and long term consequences of use were well known in society. Damage to gland functionality. High blood toxin levels. Organ defects. Congenital heart failure. Development of necrotic tissue in the glands and passage. Death.
Tony’s pace quickened, chasing his own orgasm before burying deep and spilling inside of Steve. He could feel every hot pulse of it, each dirty grind of Tony’s cock against the very core of him. Soft whimpers reached his ears, and it took him a moment to realize that he was the one making them.
“There was something I wanted to ask you about, though.”
"Captain, per Dr. Banner's instruction, I am to ascertain the intentions of anyone trying to enter his floor."
Strong arms slid beneath him, lifting him off the floor and carrying him to the bed. He shook with the force of his sobs, gasping for breath behind the gag. Steve kept his eyes squeezed tightly shut, not wanting to watch Tony walk away. His chest ached. He could feel the jagged pain of his heart breaking. And he deserved it. Steve had been so certain he was right, that he fought every kindness that Tony offered. Pushed him away. Afraid of being weak. Of being wrong.
“JARVIS, you know what to do.”
Steve’s arms wrapped tightly around Tony’s neck as he was carried into the other room. Tony didn’t even try to pull away, sitting down and keeping Steve in his lap. He murmured soft words of praise. Keeping him pressed against his body. Encouraging Steve to eat with bites of food offered from his fingers. Once they’d finished, Tony carried him to the sofa, settling with Steve still in his lap. The omega didn’t try to pull away, instead burying his face in the side of Tony’s neck. “Please don’t go…” The request was soft, a slight quaver in the other man’s voice that broke Tony’s heart all over again.
“As I was saying, one of these key pieces is currently… In a type of peril. I believe that you could do much to rectify the situation, and it would have the added benefit of removing you from your currently hopeless and rather pathetic situation. So, do I have your agreement?”
“I’m sorry, Captain, but Sir is still in blackout mode.”
“Yes Captain?”
Steve nodded in relief, allowing himself to be dragged over to a high bench and unceremoniously shoved down over it. A sharp slap landed against his thigh, cautioning him to stay still, before callused fingers began rubbing against his entrance. He could feel himself immediately begin to get wet. It was a new sensation and still made him feel uncomfortable.
A shiver ran over Steve’s skin at the dark tone of voice, body still throbbing under him, his rim pulsing weakly around Tony’s spent cock. He felt it twitch, begin to stir and harden inside of him. “Sir…”
"I didn't... I didn't hurt you, did I?"
"Need to settle, sweetheart."
"I suppose that's acceptable. This way." He led the way into the kitchen, gesturing at the small table in the corner. "Would you like something to drink?"
Tony was walking down the hall from his bedroom when Steve stepped onto the floor. The time he had invested in getting ready was more than worth it when Tony's eyes lit up in pleasure at the sight of him. "Oh, Steve... You look... Oh honey, you take my breath away."
“And you lose even that. And how does that make you feel? Knowing that I control the very basest part of you?”
James gripped Steve’s hips, stilling his movements, earning himself a soft whine. “What’s the matter, doll? You want something?”
"Back with me now?"
“I guess so. But not everybody is submissive or dominant. It’s more separate. And definitely not mainstream. There isn’t a genetic component, it’s just based on desires. But yeah, it seems pretty close.”
"Do you want to tell me what's bothering you, or should I try to guess?"
"That's what I thought. I had been planning to tease my good little sub all day then make him come on my tongue tonight. But that's not going to happen now, is it?"
“I understand plenty. What I want to know is, where did that punk from Brooklyn who never took no for an answer go? Because that Stevie would have marched downstairs and demanded to be let in no matter how long it took. He’d have broken down the door if he needed to. But you? You sit around up here mopin’. I guess it’s just not worth the effort, huh?”
"Tony, please..." His voice sounded wrecked.
"That's just how Tony shows he cares. It's who he is. I mean, if something makes you uncomfortable, say something, but otherwise just let him do it. And as for the other thing, if you want I can send you some links to a few reputable websites, so you have a little more information."
Steve stretched languidly, reaching for Tony before he remembered the other man kissing him goodbye and urging him back to sleep earlier that morning. Instead he rolled over to bury his face in the older man's pillow, breathing in the scent of him. After their playtime the night before, he felt relaxed. Settled in a way he hadn't expected.
Steve obediently sat down on the edge of the bed, attention still on the confident movements of his alpha. Tony reappeared moments later with strips of sky blue silk. Without a word, he moved behind Steve on the bed and began winding the material firmly around his forearm. When the first side was suitably bound, the other arm was folded over it and secured behind his back. Once his arms were immobilized, Tony guided him into the center of the bed before using the silk to secure his calves to his thighs.
"Not even close. Do you want to eat with the team, or up here?"
As Steve's body arched off the bed a final time, Tony jerked on the chain, pulling the clamps free. Pain seared through his nipples, mixing with the pleasure, making him scream.
James shrugged, a wicked smile on his handsome face. “I figure Tony wouldn’t have set up somethin’ like this if it wasn’t the type of game he enjoyed. Which probably means we’ll do it again. And Stevie? If I have the choice of getting’ me off or lettin’ you get off? Nine times outta ten, I’m gonna pick me. ‘Sides, the Steve I grew up with was always sweeter when he was worked up and couldn’t do anythin’ about it. Like when he’d get sick and couldn’t get it up for a few weeks. I figure you’ll be the same. But I wanna find out all the same.”
He groaned, cock twitching at the words, before dropping to his knees in front of the stool. Tony gently slid the metal around his throat and eased it shut. It was lighter than Steve had expected it to be. Than the thick leather ones he’d heard people talking about in his world.
Steve studied his face, searching for any hint of a lie. He couldn’t find one. And he was so tired. “Alright.”
“For every one you execute perfectly, you will receive an orgasm after we’re done. For every one you fail in any way, Steve will receive a ruined orgasm.” Steve’s eyes widened in shock, even as his pupils dilated with arousal. “Do you know what a ruined orgasm is, James?”
Steve sobbed, clenched around the dildo again, body shaking from another painful orgasm. "Please... Please lock up my cock, Sir. I can't... I can't take anymore..."
Steve paced restlessly in the confines of his holding cell. He had to find a way out of there, before something worse happened. It was bad enough that they had discovered his secondary gender. Worse that they’d immediately taken him off the suppressants he’d used since he was a teenager, insisting they were detoxing him for his own good. He needed to get out before some uppity alpha decided to make Steve their property.
“Yes alpha.” Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s shoulder, quiet for a long while, before he finally spoke. “If… If it wasn’t me, if I didn’t do something wrong, then why…?”
“And that is my cue to leave. I’m gonna… Go find Tony. Yeah. You two have fun.” Steve turned on his heel and ran for the elevator, the sound of laughter following him. Bucky had found someone in this new world they had been dropped into. Steve was glad. And he was ashamed to admit, a little bit relieved.
"I know. That's part of why I love this." He wrapped loose fingers around him, stroked a few times, letting Steve grind up into his touch. "You've been so good for me. That's why I've got something special for you."
It felt like he was drowning in misery. His alpha didn’t want him. Couldn’t stand to be in the same room as him for long. Tony was still taking care of him, but it was the bare minimum, usually leaving everything to either JARVIS or his inventions. Steve didn’t know what to do. Tony had said he needed to earn back the privileges he’d lost, but he didn’t know how to even start when he never saw the man. Hadn’t realized that being held and called pet names were things he could lose. The apartment started to feel less comfortable and more anxiety inducing. Shadows in the corners felt ominous when the light began to fade leaving him alone. It grew later and later, and still there was no sign of Tony.
“No pal. He didn’t. He told me the truth. Sat me down after a whole lotta fightin’ to show me what everybody else knows.”
Tony let his gaze sweep over the unblemished expanse, looking for the swollen area beneath his ear that he’d felt earlier. That had made Steve whimper and squirm beneath his touch. He pressed his lips against the spot, felt the heat radiating from it. Smelled his scent. Vanilla and honey. It wrapped around Tony, building him into a frenzy. He wanted this man to be his. Only his.
Tony kept his eyes on Steve, watching for any indicators that the sedatives were wearing off. “When would you be available? I don’t think it would be safe to take him out of the penthouse, so I probably need you to make a house call.”
A hard shudder passed through him before he finally relaxed against Tony. “Thank you, Sir.”
“So that’s what happened?”
Once there was no longer any danger of him coming immediately, the torture began again. Over and over, he was driven to orgasm and denied with perfect timing. As if the device could monitor exactly how close he actually was. He thrashed uncontrollably on the bed, flipping over and rutting desperately against the mattress, as though it could somehow help his situation. Gain him even the slightest friction against his aching cock. Sobbing into the pillow.
Steve let out a miserable groan.
By the time he turned it off the water was running cold. Steve was waiting for him when he came out of the bathroom. There was no sign of Stark. He suddenly wasn’t sure how long he’d been in there. How much time he’d lost. Steve’s eyes were red rimmed. “You’re gonna to leave me now, aren’t you?”
Steve was placed onto a thick mat on the floor, the restraints on his ankles fastening to metal loops on the ground, his wrists releasing only to fasten together behind his back. His legs were spread wide, with no way to close his legs, but he was able to kneel up in a more comfortable position. He watched as Tony sifted through the contents of several cabinets before returning with an armful of items he placed outside of Steve’s line of sight. He rubbed his hands together almost eagerly. “Ready?”
Steve sobbed as his tired body wound tight again, ramping up easier then ever, before plummeting over the edge, releasing around the toy again. Breathless with the length of time the pleasure coursed through his body before he was finally allowed to collapse against the bed, his alpha turning off the vibrator and allowing him to rest.
Steve’s eyes were wide, still dilated from his heat. He looked adorably sweet. “H-how long are you gonna keep me like this, alpha…?”
“It took a while, not gonna lie. I was real angry with him after all the stuff he did to me. The cage made me real salty, lemme tell ya.” Steve could hear the smile as he spoke, then his voice became softer. Quieter. “It was after a lot of the early shit. He’d got my glands workin’ and suddenly I was feelin’ everything. It was overwhelming. Like being crushed to death by the weight of the world. He’d gone to work, and I was sittin’ in this window seat in his apartment, watchin’ the cars go by. I don’t know when it started to rain. Or when I started to cry. But when he finally came home, I was sittin’ in the dark and crying, in the same place I’d been for hours. After everything our parents said, I thought he was gonna be mad. Beat me or somethin’. But he didn’t.”
Tony slid in beside them, arms wrapping around both Bucky and Steve, holding them close. He pressed soft kisses to the side of Bucky’s face, murmuring against his ear. “That’s right, honey. You’re okay. So good for me. I’ve got you. I’ll take care of you. You’re all mine now. The only person who can open that cage is me. I promise.”
“Yes Tony. Thank you.”
Answering the unspoken request, Tony leaned down and kissed him softly, lingering until they needed to break away to breathe. “Feeling better, baby?”
“Can’t we do both?”
He lost himself in his explorations, tongue swirling around, stroking over the sensitive spot beneath the head that made Tony moan. Making him slick so he could slide down further, until he was pressed down Steve's throat, cutting off his breath. He held him there as long as he could, swallowing around the length until the need for air forced him to pull back. Reveling in each moan of pleasure that he caused.
“You don’t understand-“
"Tony... Please..."
"I know."
Tony stared at him with such wonder for a moment that Steve felt like he’d hung the sun, moon, and stars. His eyes were glassy with unshed tears, voice rough from emotion when he spoke. “It’s perfect. Thank you. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, Steve. I love you more than I ever thought possible.”
"You'll find out. But please, by all means, keep racking 'em up. I do love to see you squirm. Now hold still. You're distracting me."
Tony pressed deeper, finding his prostate and grinding into it painfully. Whimpers fell from Steve’s throat, but there was nowhere he could go to escape the touch. He shifted back and forth, pressing his caged cock and throbbing nipples into the mattress before jerking back into Tony’s fingers. He played him like an instrument, working him into a frenzy before abruptly pulling out of him.
"So very good for me." He reached down and unfastened the front of Steve's slacks, pushing them down just far enough to free his cock. It throbbed beneath his touch and Steve moaned again. Tony stroked over him, softly at first, then firmer, dark eyes taking in every whimper and shudder. "Is this what you want from me? To play with you? Control you? Own every inch of your body?"
"Looking for baggage that goes with mine..."
By the time he was finished and submitted the reports to SHEILD, it was almost lunchtime. "Jarvis? Does Tony have a break in his schedule long enough for lunch together?"
“And afterwards?”
I love reading all of the comments and hearing how much you’re enjoying my writing. Thank you so much!
"Yeah. Sounds great."
"That's right. And you want to be a good boy for me, don't you?"
"Of course, sweetheart." Soft kisses were placed down the side of his neck and over his shoulder. "I love you, Steve."
Steve bit his lip, nodded hesitantly. “Yes alpha. I… I want to be good for you.”
Even as he shuddered, trying to drag air into his burning chest, the liquid continued to pour into him. He whined pitifully, gaining Tony’s attention. He knelt down beside Steve, gently stroking his hair. The scent of motor oil and evergreen filled Steve’s lungs, calming him more than he cared to admit. “Almost there, sweetheart. You just need to take a little bit more for me. You can do that, can’t you?” Steve exhaled raggedly before nodding. “Such a good little omega. Keep this up, and you might even earn a reward soon.”
Deciding it was best to start as he intended to continue, Tony slowly withdrew the plug from the sleeping omega, sliding his cock home into the warm depths of his body. Steve woke when Tony had seated himself fully, going stiff in his arms and immediately trying to struggle free. Tony gripped his hips firmly holding him still as he set a hard, fast rhythm. It didn’t take long for him to reach release, his knot expanding quickly, locking them together. Unlike the night before, he didn’t touch Steve’s cock. When the omega reached down to stroke himself, Tony pulled his arms over his head, the restraints attaching themselves to the headboard. Steve growled low in his throat, squirming but unable to get anywhere.
“It’s a miracle you’re still functioning, Cap. We’re not even talking about having to bench you, we’re talking about survival. And unfortunately, you’re so far out on the spectrum, we had to find a similarly placed alpha as a match. Which left us with a lot fewer options. Do you understand what I am saying to you?”
Steve’s head fell back, his hips straining against the restraints, desperate to thrust up into Tony’s tight fist. After so much teasing, the straightforward pleasure felt even more intense. As he hardened completely, Steve felt a strange shifting at the injection site, almost as if it was moving, slowly crawling up the length of his cock. He was quickly distracted from the subtle sensation as Tony increased his movements, stroking faster, pushing him towards release. He fell over the edge with a cry, his orgasm drawn out by a squeezing pressure just beneath the surface of his cock. By the time he had recovered and Tony had released him, the feeling was gone, and Steve began to wonder if he’d imagined it.
He nodded. “Yes alpha.”
"You are most welcome, my beautiful boy. Come in, clothes on the chair in the corner while I finish setting up. Face the wall when you're done. No peeking."
"Yeah, well I bet you were the prettiest one there."
He smiled up into dark eyes. "So are you."
“Enough, Steve. We’re done talking. I’m going to claim you, then take you home and take care of you, like you need me to. This is getting us nowhere.”
Tony urged him back to his feet, supporting him in strong arms until he could stand unassisted, then gently pushing him towards the track. Tears slid down his face and his body ached. Even after several releases his body burned for more. Hours, Tony had said the cream could work for hours. Steve shook his head stubbornly. He might know what his alpha was planning, but he didn’t intend to make it easy for him.
"No. I... I ignored your order, on purpose, because I wanted to come. But it had been nine days! And you'd been teasing me so much!"
When Steve woke the next morning, he remembered the way he’d acted the day before, burning with shame. He’d been so weak! And pathetic! He couldn’t understand what had come over him. Tony had locked his cock in a cage, and he’d sniveled at his feet in gratitude. Even now he could feel himself throbbing in the tight confines.
He stared out the window, desperately hoping for Tony’s return. When he was prompted to get ready for bed by the AI, Steve burst into tears, then slowly prepared himself for another sleepless night. He hadn’t seen his alpha for the entire day. It was a clear rejection that weighed heavily on his aching heart. Steve obediently stretched out in his designated place on the bed, waiting for the restraints to fasten. When nothing happened, he curled into a ball sobbing as though his heart were breaking. Steve was a bad omega. He didn’t know how to obey, or please his alpha. He was too much work and the other man had obviously decided that he was no longer worth the effort.
Tony eased him back down to the bed, stroked his cheek, an odd look on his handsome face. “We’re both idiots you know. Wanting each other and trying so hard to hide it.”
“I… I guess so?”
“I know, sweetheart. But you don’t know what you need. I do. And I promise that I’ll give it to you. You’ll thank me one day.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes Tony.”
“That’s not fair!”
This was how the older men who hadn't been hurting for anything had treated pretty girls they took out on the town. Buying them flowers and gifts, taking them to fancy restaurants and ordering their meals for them. Sweet talking them back to their beds afterward. How Bucky had charmed girls by the dozen back to their apartment for a night.
“Alpha… You know I do. But, please. Please…” Tears glinted in his eyes.
“I… I don’t know. Whatever you want, I guess?”
“Then you’d better put on a good show for me.” Steve couldn’t look away from glowing blue eyes. The dildo picked up speed, thrusting faster, dragging over his prostate more often. He whimpered, tugging at Tony’s grip on his chest, rolling his hips as though trying to grind on the pistoning cock inside of him. “That’s right, baby. Just like that. Does it feel good? I’ll tell you what. If you can come from this, I’ll let you. Won’t ruin it or anything. But if you can’t, you’re not coming for a week. Got it?”
The painting mentioned in the story is an actual work. Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter in the 1940's. The painting is called The Wounded Table and disappeared when on loan to the Soviet Union in 1955. There are only three surviving photographs of the work. Unfortunately, our world doesn't have a Tony Stark to sweep in and save mistreated art. Frida is my favorite artist, and I couldn't resist the opportunity to include her work at the gala. If you haven't seen her work before, you should check it out. I can see where her life story would be an inspiration to a man like Tony Stark.
Steve snarled at him, baring his teeth. “Like you even fucking care!”
Steve was slowly pressed back again, forced to take the full length of the dildo inside of him. Tony watched him struggle with the depth of the penetration, then whimper as it worked the lubricant deeper inside of him. Tony fastened his thighs to the sides of the machine, holding him firmly in place, preventing him from rising. His arms were folded behind his back and bound together then attached to the framework surrounding the machine. A fur lined posture collar was secured around Steve’s neck, covering his daily one, forcing his chin high and preventing him from looking down. That too was secured to the framework, rendering him completely immobile.
It was too much, too intense. He wasn’t going to survive this. But Tony kept driving him forward as the tension coiled tighter and tighter until it finally broke. The pleasure crashed over him, pulling broken screams from his throat, sweeping him away into oblivion and darkness.
“Then make me understand! When I got here, I had nothing and no one. Now I have Tony and I have you. And that’s all I need to make my life complete. And when you run away, thinking you don’t belong here, or deserve to be here, or whatever you’ve convinced yourself of in that screwed up brain of yours, you’re going to take half of my world away with you. Do you want to hurt me? Hurt Tony?”
A shiver passed down Steve's spine. Tony's tone had become deeper, teasing. It made his stomach clench in a surprisingly pleasant way. "What do bad boys get?"
“When what, honey?”
"Amazing."
“Damn do I love hearing that. Okay, up you go. We’re going upstairs.” Tony helped him stand, supporting him to the elevator, as his legs were still weak and trembling. When they reached the penthouse, Tony settled him in the closest chair and disappeared into the bedroom. Steve ran an idle fingertip across the front of his collar, rubbing back and forth in a soothing gesture as he waited for what would happen next.
“His name is Steve Rogers. He was recently taken into custody. He’s spent years as an omega-rights activist, trying to recruit support to the cause.”
A wicked grin spread across Tony's lips. "Is that what you want, Steve? For me to prove it? Is that what you've been waiting for?"
“Good boy. Now, I think I worked up an appetite. How about breakfast?”
Steve shifted minutely on his chair, trying to find a more comfortable position, or at least one that didn’t actively press the plug into his prostate, as he listened to Tony tell a story about one of the experiments currently being run by his R&D department, and how the last one had set a SHEILD agent’s hair on fire. The other man talked and gestured animatedly, bringing a soft smile to Steve’s lips. He was enjoying having dinner with Tony. The restaurant was quiet, the food was good, and the company beyond compare. He’d missed spending time with him. Had been so busy running everywhere for SHEILD that they hadn’t spent much time together lately.
“I most certainly am. And all night, too. Longer, if you argue.” He laughed as Steve’s jaw snapped shut. “Come on, baby doll. Let’s get something to eat. And then I’ll be nice to you for a while.”
Steve heard the sound of Tony's belt behind him, rocked his hips faster, but he couldn't really feel it. The metal covered most of his cock, especially the sensitive head. He could only feel slight brushes of material through the small vent holes and it wasn't enough. He could feel his cock trying to harden, pressing against the metal, throbbing painfully.
Not knowing what was going to happen next, when Tony would release him, or what game he would decide to play after this was part of the excitement. All he had to do was what he was told. Not lead, just follow. The denial, the control that Tony had over him was thrilling. But damn it he wanted to come already.
Tony studied him warily. “Are you going to believe what I tell you? Or her sob story to the press?”
“Yes Tony.”
Tony could already imagine coming home to the stunning omega waiting on his knees, pliant and obedient. It would take time to get them there, but Tony Stark was nothing if not confident.
“Yeah. I knew about this. Come on over here, sweetheart. Let me tell you all about it.”
Steve let his forehead drop to the carpet. “Fuck.”
And another chapter up!
Steve nodded, even though he knew the other man couldn’t see it. “Yeah. That was the party line.” He stopped for a second, thought about it. “Why didn’t they ever think alpha’s needed to be better than their biology? Why was it just omegas? Us, who need to be different.”
"Put in the order for breakfast. Exactly what Steve wants, all the trimmings, for both of us. Add coffee."
And then there was James. He was so scared. So broken and wounded. But instead of turning all of that pain outward, he punished himself. For everything that had happened and everything he did while under the control of Hydra. What might have happened to him if Steve hadn’t intervened made Tony feel sick. The beautiful, somehow still trusting, man lying beside him would be dead somewhere. Probably ended in what he considered a suitably painful way. The thought filled him with rage. Not for James, but for Rogers.
"No, Tony."
“Captain. It seems we have a problem.”
He carefully eased the tube around Steve’s soft cocklet, until the end was pressed flush to the skin around it. As soon as he began twisting the knob, increasing the pressure and dragging the trapped flesh deeper into the tube, Steve’s attention flew back to him. Another turn and the vacuum began to pull and stretch the sensitive tissue, causing Steve to thrash and jerk his hips, trying to dislodge it. But it was too late. The grip was strong enough that it didn’t come off, despite the frantic movements.
Steve felt fuzzy and confused, too wrung out and overworked to process any hidden meaning behind Tony’s words. He was caught by the idea of proving himself to the other man, deserving the moments of kindness and praise that Tony offered him. Earning his forgiveness and affection. That was what he wanted more than anything. “Yes Tony. Thank you. You’re so good to me.”
He rubbed the back of his neck, looking away from her amused expression. "Yeah. That."
He straddled Steve’s hips, pulling a slim collar out of the box. “We’re going to start with this one. It’ll make you feel more secure for what’s coming next.” The cool metal slid around Steve’s throat, tight enough to notice but not to choke. Tony finished fastening it, leaning back to survey his work. “This one’s just temporary. I’ll make you a permanent one when I have a chance. One that locks.”
"You two have been staring at each other with heart eyes for weeks now. We're not blind. Yeah, we know."
“Oh, sweetheart. You have no idea the things I could do to you.” Tony pulled him against his chest, gripping his hips. Steve could feel his cock, hard and twitching, pressed against him as he spoke, voice low with a hint of growl against his ear. “I could plug you up with ginger, spank you and watch you cry from the burn. I could put you in full chastity. Nothing touching your skin except for smooth metal. Locked up tight except for when I decide to play with you. Or I could stretch you open, work the biggest plug I own into you, make you run laps for me until you’re legs won’t work, you’ve released so many times. I could numb you up and fuck you all night long, and you’d feel nothing at all, but you’d want it. Need it. Because that’s the secret. Whatever your alpha wants? You want too.”
This wasn't how a friend took care of another friend. Or at least it wasn't back in his day. This was how someone took care of his fella. Did Tony think of him that way? He'd never said anything, but in Steve's limited experience that wasn't unusual for Tony. He didn't talk about his feelings. He didn't even like having them. Well, Steve was not Tony. He did have feelings and talked about them when need be. And right now, he needed to talk to the resident genius to figure out what was going on. Since he spent most of his time in his workshop, that is where he assumed the older man would be. Steve took the elevator down to the workshop and walked inside. He had noticed that he had free access a while ago but had chalked it up to being team leader at the time.
“Sure, Buck. Just… Just missed you is all.”
He moved away for a moment, and Steve breathed a sigh of relief for the brief respite. He returned with a small box he placed on a table beside the bench. It was small and black, with three small plastic tubes coming out of the surface. “I’m going to give you a choice. You listening Steve?”
“No, it’s not. What a smart boy I have.” His lips curled in amusement.
The sobs came free as he felt the cage pull tighter around him. It almost felt looser around his soft cock until the mechanism was activated, tightening it until he was throbbing again. He knew what his alpha was doing now. Forcing releases until he softened enough to allow the extra room, then stealing it away.
Tony waved his apology away. “Don’t worry about it. I’ve finally learned the fine art of delegation. Besides, I have plenty of plans for my pretty little toy. As a matter of fact, there is something I’d enjoy. Something I’ve always wanted, but no one else has been willing…”
Steve paused in the doorway for a moment to watch Tony in his element, singing along to his music and arguing with Jarvis and the bots. When he finally stepped inside Tony greeted him with a smile and a kiss. "Hey babe! What brings you down? Not that I'm not glad you're here and all, but you kind of look like a man on a mission."
"Yeah. Thank you." He took the cup, carefully observing the other man, who seemed to be a lot more awake this early in the morning than usual. Tony looked good. Well rested. No sign of the normal dark shadows beneath his eyes. Steve sat up sharply, studying him closer. Improved sleep wasn't the only difference. The strands of silver at his temples were gone, along with some of the deeper wrinkles around Tony's eyes, and a large amount of the scarring on his chest. He didn't appear younger, only less worn. And last night, the way he had been able to manhandle Steve as if he weighed nothing. "Tony, what did you do?"
Before the serum, Steve hadn’t presented a secondary gender. Just another way that he was kept separate from the world around him. But at least he’d been able to come. The SSR scientists had been hopeful that after the serum he would be transformed into a perfect specimen of alpha masculinity. They had been beyond disappointed that their only super soldier had been an omega, immediately putting him on high doses of suppressants throughout the war.
"I... Suppose you do have a point. I never thought of it as such."
"Is it true you decided on the charities for the foundation by throwing darts at a list on the wall?"
After over a week of the torture, Tony urged him down onto the couch, carefully pressing against his abdomen. The alpha had examined him like this before, but this time he smiled softly. “You’re done, sweetheart.” The vibrator stilled, and Steve relaxed into the cushions with relief. Tony carried him to a table in the playroom, positioning him on it’s surface, feet held open in stirrups, but not restrained. Steve was nearly asleep by the time Tony opened him up, letting out a grateful moan when the cervical plug was finally removed. A wave of cramping followed, but eased quickly.
"Feeling better, sweetheart?"
The next time he was denied, a wail tore from his throat, followed by hysterical sobs. Steve felt like he was burning alive. In that moment he would do or agree to anything to gain the satisfaction he needed. The pause between rounds was getting shorter, building him up higher and leaving him clinging to the edge for longer. Every inch of him was sensitive and aching.
“I think that sounds perfect. Thank you, Tony.”
Steve began to regularly arrange time with the other man, both inside and outside of the tower. He began to enjoy their time together, appreciating the other man's sardonic sense of humor. He decided to introduce Loki to some of the aspects of the modern world he appreciated. The first was to introduce the other man to the wonders of the spa Tony enjoyed sending him to on a regular basis, museums, and coffee shops following soon after.
“There you go. You have permission, honey. You come whenever you want to.” Slick fingers rubbed over his entrance and thrust deep inside of him. Each stroke stretched his sore hole and rubbed against his prostate, quickly building him to the edge after the earlier teasing and his night of denial. Steve moaned, trying to rock back to meet each thrust, passage squeezing tight around him. When Tony spoke, his voice was fond. “Greedy little thing. Is this not enough for you, honey? Do you need another?”
Tony returned long minutes later with two cups and a large bowl of fruit. He sat beside Steve on the bed offering him pieces of fruit with his fingers and sips of coffee to wash it down. However Steve kept getting distracted by the increasing throb of his entrance. Tony scolded him several times for squirming, and even slapped his thigh to get his attention when he still couldn’t hold still.
Eight days after the bonding, SHEILD called them both in for a mission. Steve felt strange, walking into the conference room with the rest of the team. Tony sat beside him for the debrief, a hand resting on his thigh, which was nice. But before he knew what happened, they were in the middle of a fire fight.
"Good night, Steve."
“I see. And let me guess, those bonding glands are right here on your beautiful neck.” Tony’s fingers slid up to cup the back of Steve’s neck, fingers and thumb pressing hard against both of his sensitive glands. Steve cried out helplessly, back arching as he released without warning, the pleasure tearing through him, leaving him feeling weak and sluggish.
Steve sobbed. "Yes..."
"I..."
“No, it’s not fair at all. Poor boy. This is so hard for you, isn’t it? Alpha’s don’t take their time to play with pretty toys, do they? Just mount you and leave. I’m never gonna do that, Steve. I’m going to take my time. I want you to feel me in every fiber of your being. I want it all to belong to me. You gonna give me that?”
"And you've given me so much that I never thought I'd have. I'd give you the world, if you'd let me."
“Good to know.” Tony’s voice was low, nearly a growl. He stepped between Steve’s spread thighs, pressing his cock against his hole and sliding inside slowly. It felt so good that Steve could barely stand it, waiting desperately for him to move. Thrust. Nothing happened.
"You do not have my permission to come. If you are a good boy, and make it until I come back, you can have anything you want all day tomorrow. If you're a bad boy, I will tie you to the bed, spank your sweet little hole until you cry, and lock you back up in the cage again. Do you understand?"
Steve leaned forward, pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s cheek. “Please tell me, alpha?”
“Alright. Point made. Why don’t you sit down and eat your breakfast. I have some work I need to get done, and some meetings this afternoon. You have full access to the penthouse and there’s a tablet for you on the coffee table. If you need anything, ask JARVIS.” Tony let him slide off his lap and onto one of the chairs. He stood, straightening his suit and brushing a brief kiss over Steve’s cheek. “I’ll see you tonight.” It wasn’t until after he’d left, that Steve realized Tony’s breakfast was still sitting on the table, uneaten.
Then other things started to appear. Just in his rooms. Just on his floor. Slowly foods that he had discovered he liked, or Stark had recommended he should try appeared in his cabinets and refrigerator. The soft and squishy pillows had started to sneak into his bed, along with soft blankets and throws on every piece of furniture. Clothing tailored to his exact measurements had found its way into his closet, ensuring he would be prepared for any occasion from a black-tie gala to the end of the world. And who even wore leather pants that tight, anyway?
"Tony..."
And thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or kudos on the last chapter. It makes me feel really good that other people enjoy the porny little plot bunnies that run through my head all the time.
"Tony, please, can I come? Please?"
"Please what, baby?"
Tony nodded. “That… Actually explains a lot. I know who Strange is. This seems like the kind of thing he’d do. This isn’t 2012, Steve. This is 2016. It’s been three months since you tried to kill me in Siberia and ran away to go play house with the man who murdered my parents.”
"Don't worry sweetheart. You're going to get exactly what you wanted. Because you did want this, didn't you? You're always such a good boy for me, making sure I get what I want too. And I will always want this." Tony let his palms run over his straining thighs, pulled his cheeks roughly apart.
Steve pouted, glancing at James over his shoulder. “Please, Buck. Lemme come. I’ve been good. Please?”
He noticed an odd numb spot just below his prostate when the alpha’s cock rubbed over it. The sensation was unsettling especially when the knot swelled, relentlessly pressing on the area. His thoughts were interrupted by callused fingers stroking over his cock urging him towards his own release. It took him by surprise as it crashed over him, the feeling of his balls pulling tight to his body no longer there to signal impending orgasm. Those clever fingers slid below his cock, pressing in and rubbing the now bare skin, drawing an even more explosive climax from his spent body. He lay there, trembling, struggling to draw breath, clenching around the cock still held inside of him.
Steve howled as the length of the toy stroked over his prostate, the weight of it pulling at his hole with every thrust. His hips jerked and rolled, fucking up into the air in search of any kind of relief. He cried out when a hard hand buried in his hair, dragging his head forward, and then Tony’s cock was buried deep in his throat. He gagged around the length as Tony set a brutal pace. Steve could feel him throbbing, warm and alive, as he thrust into him. It was an intense contrast to the robotic dildo pounding into his ass and the tight metal wrapped around his cock. He moaned around him, feeling Tony spurting down his throat a moment later.
Afterwards Steve curled up against Tony's side, head on his shoulder and legs draped across his lap, a hand smoothing idly over his hip. "You know, I'm enjoying the time together, but this isn't exactly what I thought you'd want for today."
Steve grabbed a towel and wiped his face as he walked away from the punching bag he'd been testing. Tony had been getting a lot closer to materials he couldn't destroy after a bad day, which was appreciated. "Sure thing, Jarvis. Workshop?"
Steve woke the next morning warm and content, with Tony still curled against his back. He shifted away far enough to stretch out his stiff muscles, before turning to face the other man. He let his gaze run over Tony’s features, his heart tightening in his chest. This was everything he had ever wanted. Love. Affection. A place to belong. And he was still so afraid that he’d lose it. Screw up in some unforgivable way that would make Tony realize that he could do so much better. Shifting closer, Steve pressed against his chest, buried his face in Tony’s throat. Let his alpha’s scent surround and calm him, slowing his breathing to match his deep even breaths. Drifting on the closeness of their bond. His mate.
He flailed franticly, searching for anything to help him. His hands flew to his caged cock, pressed behind it, where he could feel the vibrations pulsing through his body. But the instrument of his torture was buried inside of him. Unreachable. There was nothing he could do to escape. He couldn’t crawl away or remove it. No way to direct the stimulation in any way. He could feel his passage pulsing and squeezing in response, a dull empty ache building inside of him.
"The fuck it won't!"
When Tony finally captured his lips, Steve moaned eagerly, legs falling open. He felt his alpha settle between them, and spread them further, needing to feel the heat of him thrusting into his spasming passage. The thick knot spreading him wide and easing the unrelenting need burning inside of him. He whimpered when the plug was pulled free, a gush of slick soaking the blankets beneath him, then screamed when Tony gripped his thighs, pulling him closer and sealing his mouth around Steve’s tender hole. Tony’s tongue thrust into him, swirling around his entrance then plunging deep. Rubbing over his sensitive glands until Steve thought he would lose his mind. Instead of easing his desire, every release Tony pulled from him only made it worse. Until Steve was writhing mindlessly on the sheets, struggling to free himself from the alpha’s grip. Make him stop tormenting him and give him what he needed.
“Nothing? Not even a little bit of pressure?”
"Oh, thank Tesla." Tony reached out, plucking the ring from the box and sliding it on Steve's finger. A perfect fit. Of course. He leaned forward, pressing his lips to Steve's knuckles. It was an oddly intimate gesture, especially considering everything they had already done together. But somehow perfect. "You make me so happy."
"I love you too."
“Oh sweetheart. I was just letting you dig your own grave. Just because I don’t say anything, doesn’t mean I don’t see everything.” He stalked closer to the couch, eyes dragging over Steve’s straining body. “I thought I’d give you a few days, see how you responded. Now I know.” Tony’s fingertips skimmed over Steve’s chest, pausing to tweak a nipple before moving on. “Apparently you need a firm hand.”
Steve ducked his head bashfully and smiled up at him. "Thank you. You look amazing. But, then again, you always do to me."
Tony knew he couldn’t hold back much longer, pressed Steve deeper into the rug, slamming into him hard and fast. “Now Steve! Now!” Steve screamed as he was finally allowed release, clenching so tightly around Tony’s cock that it almost hurt. He came buried as far inside Steve’s body as possible, passage rippling and squeezing around him, milking every drop from his spent cock. He stayed still, holding his trembling omega close, dropping soft kisses along his neck and shoulders. He’d learned that Steve needed him to stay inside as long as possible. Needed to be filled to know he was safe and wanted.
But he could. And he was going to. Steve had promised to do anything. And that clenching in his stomach increased at the idea of pleasing the older man. Of being played with. Of suffering and being tortured purely for his pleasure.
"Yeah."
Steve nodded, unsure if he was capable of anything else. The warmth of Tony’s body moved away, and a distressed sound caught in his throat. A moment later he could hear the sound of water running, cabinet doors opening and closing, followed by a triumphant cry. Tony walked back into the bedroom, and there was a sense of relief. He came back. He wasn’t gone. He didn’t leave him.
He took a few days to hide out in a safe house. Get something to eat, even if sleep were unfortunately elusive. To think about what he really wanted. Maybe it was the Catholic upbringing, but all Steve could think of was absolution. And there was really only one man he wanted it from.
There was a firm pressure along the entirety of his stretched rim, like suction but continuous. He tried to struggle, shake off whatever was putting pressure on the sensitive flesh, but nothing happened. He felt the metal dildo slide out of him, until only the very tip was buried in his body, before slamming all the way home again. And again. And again. A steady precise rhythm. Too precise for a human. This had to be another one of the toys Tony had designed for him.
"Anytime."
"Hmm?"
"I do. You know I do."
After Tony left, Steve followed his instructions to the letter. Spent an hour soaking in the bathtub, trying to relax his sore muscles, before curling up on the couch with his tablet to read a book Bruce had recommended. Unfortunately, the sci-fi didn't capture his imagination today. Instead it reminded him how much Bucky would have loved it, leaving him feeling miserable and depressed. Which was how Tony found him.
“Anything you want, alpha.”
Steve struggled to beg, the gag turning his please into a garbled mess. Tony set a hard pace, pounding into his prostate with every thrust. He took him in shifts, thrusting ruthlessly until he came buried deep inside him, enjoying the spasming passage around his soft cock before it brought him to hardness and he started again. Over and over, until Steve was dripping with his come. He finally slid from Steve’s body, slipping a short, thick plug inside him, just long enough to dig into his prostate.
James slowly rose to his feet, moaning as the toy shifted inside of him. He moved behind Steve’s bound body, sinking to his knees. He stayed there for a moment, gaze focused on Steve’s dripping entrance, watching the slick slowly trickle from his entrance and slide down his thighs. “So fuckin’ pretty, Stevie. My God…” Reverently James leaned forward, pressing his lips to the twitching hole.
The fingers finally retreated. Steve closed his eyes, hoping they were finished. That he had been deemed unworthy by the alpha who had selected him. But he knew he was lying to himself. The sounds of a belt and zipper seemed especially loud in the quiet of the room. He felt the head of the alpha’s cock press against his throbbing hole. “No! I told you, I don’t want this!”
The season opener was good, quickly drawing him in. Steve stretched out on the couch, so wrapped up in what was on the screen he stopped paying attention to the world around him. Mistake. The plug surged to life inside of him, vibrations at a higher setting then before. His cock was instantly and painfully alive, throbbing within its confines. He writhed on the couch, hips grinding back into the plug then rocking forward into the air. Arousal built higher, flushing his skin, pushing him towards the edge. Just as he was getting close, despite the cage, the vibrations stopped. His hips rocked a few more times, but it was too late. Steve collapsed back on the couch, resigned to his fate.
“What year is it, Steve?”
The air was already steamy, smelling faintly of citrus and woodsmoke. He smiled down at the younger man, running a gentle hand through his hair. "Good choice, sweetheart. Can I ask why you picked that one?"
"That's great, Tony!"
Steve buried his face against the smooth fabric of Tony's shirt, cheeks flushing. "I just want you. Always. All the time."
He released the hold when Steve finally raised his head, blinking up at him sleepily.
Tony had to admit, once the man was cleaned up and somewhat in charge of his faculties he was nice to look at. Steve would be so happy to see him again… That twist in his chest again. He rubbed a hand over the arc reactor and willed it away. He’d have plenty of time for that later, but today? Today he needed to make Steve happy.
Steve gave himself up to the steady stream of releases, until he was wrung out and spent. Tony gently eased him back to lie on the couch, curled securely in the alpha’s arms, as he struggled to breathe.
“Yes alpha.”
“Y-yes Tony…”
Tony laughed. "Because you're smart. Tell me Steve, have you been with a man before?"
He held Steve there until his cock softened and slipped out. Continued to hold him in position as his body was brutalized with ceaseless pleasure. Tony finally released his hair only to grab his pecs, kneading them hard enough to bruise, pinching and pulling at his nipples. “I’ve missed these perfect tits of yours, Steve. Maybe next time that’s where I’ll fuck you. Right here between your perfect tits.”
"Such a good boy. Would you like a reward for being so good for me?"
The cloth slid up Steve’s thigh, slowly approaching the cage that still held him securely. He swallowed hard before answering. “No. We’re… We’re good, Tony. I… Enjoyed myself.”
“I… I won’t let you down. I promise. You won’t see me, or hear me, or know that I’m here. Just like you wanted. I can do that. I promise.”
“Either we stop now, and you stay like this until bedtime. Or, I try this little baby out on you, and I give you my cock. What do you want, honey?”
Steve closed his eyes and moaned. The idea that Tony had taken the time to do that made him flush. "Th- Thank you, Sir. You're so good to me. I'm so sorry."
Steve set the tablet aside, deciding a break was in order. He wandered back into the small kitchen, looking around. The coffeemaker’s light was green, which likely meant it was still on. He poured himself another cup, adding cream and sugar the way Tony did, before carrying it back into the living room. Once he was ready, he turned back to the internet.
Tony gently deposited him into the water, kneeling beside the tub. He retrieved a soft washcloth from beneath the sudsy water and began slowly cleaning every inch of Steve’s skin with soft strokes. Strokes that were going to feel more than comforting very quickly.
Steve let his fingers brush over the bracelet on his wrist. "Of course, Tony. What would you like me to do?"
Tony slid into the bed behind him, curling against his back, his cock rubbing against Steve’s ass in slow movements. Steve arched his back, offering himself to the other man, wanting to feel him warm and alive inside of him. The head of Tony’s cock pressed against his hole, pausing for a moment. Steve held his breath, silently praying for what he needed most. As though he knew what Steve was thinking and had decided to grant his request, Tony slowly slid into Steve’s still open passage, drawing a soft gasp. It felt unbelievably good, better than the day before.
He reached back, grabbing a blanket and tucking it around Steve carefully. "Don't want you to get cold, sweetheart."
The next few weeks were busy, but fairly normal. Or at least what passed for normal for superheroes who were regularly called out to save the world from an unending stream of would-be villains. Tony spent a little more time in his workshop, but he was a genius. And even with the extra hours, he found time for Steve on a regular basis, either to take him out on extravagant dates, cuddle on the couch with a movie, or help him discover a laundry list of kinks that he hadn't actually known he had.
Steve felt his cheeks burn as he dropped to the floor, crawled over to kneel at the other man's feet. "Tony, Tony please! You're driving me crazy! Please!"
The tears are back, barely clinging to his lashes, threatening to spill down his cheeks. “Because I don’t deserve it. I deserve this. I deserve to be punished. For everything I’ve done. Everyone I’ve hurt or killed. I deserve to hurt. To suffer. To suffer and to die alone…”
A small twinge of guilt stopped him and he dropped into one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs lining the hallway. There was one other person who cared. Who he should be texting this very moment, to inform of him wellbeing. But Steve just couldn’t bring himself to do it.
Tony chuckled, pulling him closer. “Alright. Alright. Apparently you’ll take cuddles by force, won’t you, you greedy little thing?”
"Yes, Tony." Steve reached into the box again, pulling out a slim prostate vibrator, setting the remote to the side, lubing it up, then easing it inside himself. Immediately his cock tried to harden, sensitive and needy after so much longer than usual without release.
“Well, with an offer like that, who am I to refuse? Welcome to your new home, darling. Make yourself comfortable. And by comfortable, I mean I want you naked for me.”
Tony let out a sign of relief. He’d been worried after he’d read Steve’s file, afraid that a lot of the damage would be permanent. “Great. I’m assuming you came prepared?”
“Absolution. From you. My reality’s version of Tony died. I came here for you.”
With a shudder, he decided to move on. Wrapped a hand around himself and started to stroke his cock from root to tip, rubbing over the head before moving back down. It felt... good.
"Do you want to cuddle or be distracted?"
Steve moaned, arching his back further, offering himself up to Tony. He’d do anything for Tony, suffer through any torment to prove himself to him. “Is that what you want, sweetheart?”
Steve started to panic. This was wrong. Everything was wrong. He couldn’t breathe. Then the world went dark around him, and he was alone.
“Okay, sweetheart, I’ve got you.” Tony adjusted several dials before flipping a switch. Steve screamed as pulses of electricity ran through his body, centering on that numb area. Only it wasn’t quite so numb anymore. Instead it was aching, throbbing with each pulse from the machine. He thrust down against the frame, pulling at the cuffs holding him still. It was worse than anything that had already been done to him, an all consuming pain that somehow registered as pleasure to his stupid body.
As soon as his feet hit the carpet, he was gone, dashing for the penthouse door and desperately trying to force it open. Tony moved at a slower pace, allowing Steve to discover the futility of his actions. When the door didn’t open, he turned to the windows, fist banging against the glass, trying to shatter it. He whirled around, dropping into a crouch when Tony came closer, ready to attack. “Stay back! I mean it!”
"No."
Tony was there to catch him, unfastening his arms, removing the clamps, and easing him off the bench. He lifted Steve in his arms, carrying him to the bedroom and settling them both beneath the covers. Only then did he turn his attention away. “Where are we at now, FRIDAY?”
"Alright. Stand up for me." He felt Tony's hands guide him, turning him so his back was to the other man. Steve heard an odd sound, fabric brushing against fabric, and then felt something slick and cool wrapping around his wrists, binding them together behind his back. Tony turned him to face him once more, then guided Steve down to sit on top of his desk. The red silk tie he had been wearing earlier was gone.
“Stop it! Let me go!”
"You planned this!"
He took a deep breath and tried to snap the chain connecting the cuffs, tried pulling against the bedframe. The restraints held tight. They could contain a super soldier. Which meant... His eyes flew up to meet Tony's.
“Aww, Stevie. C’mere.” He pulled Steve into a tight hug again. “The hurt’s only temporary. I promise. And if you haven’t gone into heat, it’ll be better for you than it was for me. And once you stop fightin’ all the time, it’ll get better.”
Tony shot him an offended glare. “Of course I did! You don’t really think I’d put anyone else’s tech on your dick, do you?”
Steve lowered his head, eyes on the ground. He'd known from the start that this was a game he could never win, but somehow, he'd made it worse. His stomach clenched in nervous anticipation. Even Tony's anger made him ache with desire.
"Spread your legs for me. Wide." Steve spread his thighs apart as far as he could, feeling the strain in the muscles. He knew what was coming, or at least he thought he did. Tony moved away again, and Steve didn't have the energy to lift his head to see what he was doing. All of his concentration was taken by the burning in his ass, the throbbing in his cock, the ache of his balls trying to pull up against the loop of metal holding them in place. He felt metal wrapping around each ankle, holding him spread wide. Tried to close his legs and felt the bar between the cuffs holding him open and exposed for Tony to play with. "Built this one too. Thought you might like it. Do you, Steve?"
Steve shook his head, focusing on keeping his breathing slow, to hold back the onslaught of pleasure. He wasn't sure how long Tony stayed in the room watching him, or how much time had passed. The vibrations worked him up quickly, too close to the edge to hold back, causing him to jerk away from the plug. This resulted in pressing against the glass, electricity shocking his sensitive cock. The restraints held him securely, limiting his movement and his choices. He could endure the sharp pain to his cock, or the incessant throbbing against his prostate. Risk coming too soon or give in to the prickling pain.
The first bite of bread was soft and flaky. The vegetables were soft and flavorful. The meat rich and filling. Steve had never had food like this before. His Ma had always scraped together what she could for the both of them, but going to sleep at night with an achingly empty stomach had been the norm rather than an exception. This man wasn’t just well off. He was rich. Probably used to always getting his way. Heaven knew he already had with Steve. The gentle touch on his arm startled him from his thoughts, sending him flinching back into the chair.
Tony snorted. “Good luck with that.”
“No alpha.”
Tony moaned, threading a hand through soft blonde hair and gripping tightly, hips rolling up to meet each downward stroke of Steve's mouth, soon spilling down his throat. A soft tongue lapped over sensitive skin, cleaning every trace of Tony's release, intending to soothe. Instead, Steve felt the brunette's cock hardening again as he was guided away by the grip on his hair. "Tony...?"
He reached out, cupped Tony's cheek. "Thank you. For bringing me tonight. For putting all this on display so I could see it." Steve gently brushed his lips against his. "It's beautiful. And so are you."
"I... Worried, I guess. I wasn't too hard on you last night, was I? I mean, I know you're new to all of this, and I just... I don't want to hurt you, or... Or chase you away..."
Tony rolled off the bed, disappearing into his closet. Steve stayed on the bed, obedient even without a command. Once he returned, the first thing Tony did was shackle his wrists to the bed frame. They were left loose, providing some room for movement, but the point was that he wasn’t going anywhere without Tony’s permission. Just the thought of it was enough to have Steve hard and leaking against his belly.
Tony smirked slightly, knowing that he’d won. “Then it’s my job to take care of you. And if I tell you to come get me if you need me? Even if it’s the middle of the night?”
Steve rushed to obey, climbing up onto the high mattress as he was told, knees slightly apart for balance, arms folded behind his back. It was seductive and so easy. All he had to do was what Tony told him to. He didn’t have to think, didn’t have to fight. Only obey.
The orgasm crashed over him, tearing a scream from Steve’s throat as wave after wave of ecstasy ran through his body. Tony kept moving inside of him, drawing out every last bit of pleasure before allowing Steve to collapse into a spent heap. He barely noticed the restraints being released, only realizing he was free when Tony lifted him into his arms. Steve rested his head against Tony’s shoulder as the other man carried him back upstairs. Steve was deposited gently on the bed, covers drawn up over his shoulders. Suddenly he was unable to keep his eyes open. He felt the gentle press of lips against his forehead and a soft murmur that included the words “workshop” and “sleep”. This time it was easy to obey. To slide into the oblivion of dreamless sleep.
Tony kept him there, coming on his fingers again and again, until there was nothing left. Until Bucky was begging him desperately to take pity on him, to fuck him. He needed to feel that thick cock splitting him open, spilling inside of him, grounding him, as Steve continued to shake in his arms. There was a slick sound behind him, and then Tony was there, strong and safe, pressed against his back, the head of his cock barely resting against Bucky’s hole.
“Good. Now come sit. I have a few things I need to do, and I want my sweet boy close.” Steve settled at Tony’s feet, head resting against his knee. Tony carded his fingers through his hair as he worked. Most of it was silent, Steve wasn’t sure how Tony was controlling everything, but it was obvious that he was. Occasionally there were one sided phone calls. Steve could hear Tony speaking, but nothing else, even with his enhanced hearing. The tone of his voice was different from how he spoke to Steve, hard and commanding. Tony switched between multiple languages with ease, leaving Steve lost and confused. Just how much international business was Tony doing now? Obviously a lot more than in his reality. And there had been no mention of Pepper Potts, or anyone else that Steve knew. Tony seemed to be much more isolated than he’d expected.
“Shit. Sweetheart. I didn’t…” Tony shook his head miserably. “When I said privileges, I meant things like television and phone calls. Me comforting you? That isn’t supposed to be something you lose. That’s part of my responsibilities. It’s how I take care of you. I’m so sorry I made you feel like that. I’ll do my best to make sure you know how much you’re wanted and loved every day for the rest of my life. I promise…”
“Yes Sir?”
"Yes..."
“The alpha bites them, usually before or during sex. Hard enough to rupture the bonding gland. And then that’s it. Sometimes a really possessive alpha will take both glands, make sure the omega can never bond with anyone else.”
A shiver of revulsion ran down Steve’s spine, jostling the teeth still buried in his throat. The grip tightened, arms wrapping around his waist, keeping them close together until the alpha’s knot began to deflate. Any relief he might have felt was short lived when the alpha spoke again. “Get me a plug for the trip home, would you? I want to keep my come in him as long as possible. It’ll help.”
Tony walked to the couch, grabbed a cushion and dropped it on the floor beside his chair at the table before sitting down. He gestured towards it, watching Steve carefully. It had been years since Tony had the luxury of taking a submissive, but the wanting never went away. To have someone at his complete mercy, bound up with ropes and begging him to let them come. The desperation as he would tease them for an entire weekend, sometimes longer. He’d never been able to picture the Steve Rogers he’d known like that, but this one… Tony was willing to bet that he’d love it. Want more.
“Yes, alpha. Thank you.”
Steve nodded. “Thank you, Jarvis.” It took him a few minutes to figure out how to reply to the message, touch screens were so much easier, but he finally ended up with something he could send.
Steve cried out, banging his head against the arm of the couch, unable to stop himself from gripping the cage, pulling at it desperately, as though that would in any way lessen his torment. This had already happened a few times already, the cage contracting, forcing his cock into submission before adjusting to become more comfortable once more, having robbed him of a little more space. Shrinking his cock down to be more acceptable for the alpha who would one day toss him to the side like garbage. Bad luck that it was happening now.
"You know what I expect of you in here?"
"You're welcome sweetheart. Gotta take care of my sweet boy, now don't I?"
As soon as Steve’s cock was entirely soft, Tony picked up the cage, sliding it over him and tucking his balls inside. The latch clicked shut, and Tony grabbed the remote, adjusting the settings so it closed firmly around him, pressing hard against the head, forcing him down into a dainty package. It was almost painful, but a relief after the agony he’d experienced through the day. Once it was tightened into place, Tony stretched out beside him, pulling him close.
It continued to press forward, until Steve was a desperate wreck, uncertain of how he would stand any more. Tony pressed a button, halting the forward motion. Steve hung there, limp and exhausted, unable to ignore the new sensations for even a second. His passage clenched around the intrusion, trying to force it out or adjust around the length, sending shivers dancing up Steve’s spine. His alpha was relentless. Possessive. Would own every inch of him, inside and out, eventually.
A waiter filled their glasses with water and disappeared with a quiet assurance that he'd return quickly. Tony tilted his head to the side again, studying Steve like he had before. "Would you like me to order for you, sweetheart?"
"You gonna ask me to lock you up like a good little boy? Come on, baby. Let me hear you ask for it."
Steve curled tighter into his arms. “I want to keep it. To try… I want your baby, alpha. Please?”
Steve whimpered softly, still rocking back to meet his movements. Slowly he let his head fall to the other side, offering up the unmarked skin. Tony didn’t hesitate. “You’re mine Steve. Mine.” He knew what he was doing this time, knew what to expect. Tony sank his teeth into the swollen gland, tearing through flesh, until he felt the little spasm and gush of sweetness that meant he’d hit the right place.
"As long as I want. Better be good. Because if you're bad, I'll just have to leave you in lockup longer."
“What is it you need, sweet boy. If I can, I’ll give it to you.”
Callused fingertips trailed over his chest, began teasing over his nipples, soft at first, and then harder, pinching at them until Steve arched off the bed. Tony didn’t let up, teasing and toying with him until he was squirming and panting. “I want to make you crazy, Steve. I want you desperate and begging. And then I want to tell you no. Over and over until you aren’t thinking of anything but how to please me. Is that what you want?”
Steve turned glassy eyes up to look at him and heard Tony’s breath leave his chest is a soft rush. “Thought what, Tony?”
Tony held him close, stroking his hair and kissing him again and again until he finally calmed, was left dazed and drifting. "You were so good for me. So sweet and perfect. Do you feel better now, sweetheart?"
“Such a good boy for me.” Tony’s mouth sealed around one nipple, sucking demandingly, his fingers pinching and pulling at the other, working Steve relentlessly until he released with a cry, the pleasure taking him by surprise. It felt good, but after the pain and helplessness of the day before, it was especially welcome. He leaned into every touch as Tony played with his body.
“Thank you, sweetheart. You’re gonna be so good for me, aren’t you?”
Tony was grateful to escape to bed early that night, settling them in and restraining Steve’s wrist and ankle cuffs to the bed. He pretended to sleep, not in the mood to mount the pretty omega beside him. Memories of the past were too close for him to feel even the slightest hint of arousal. Tony listened to the soft frustrated sounds Steve made until they finally quieted. The night was still around them. Tony stared into the darkness, unable to sleep.
"Are you loyal to us or to Asgard?"
Also, I couldn’t resist the idea of playing with some of my favorite mutants! Hope you enjoyed the cameo.
“And you did say I could do anything I want. No limits. This is what I want. I promise it’ll only hurt for a minute.” Without any further warning, Steve felt the head of the device press against his newly sensitive prostate. There was a burst of agony as something implanted in the gland, lingering for a moment then slowly fading as his body healed. The metal stretching him wide was collapsed down and removed, Steve’s entrance twitching continuously from the abrupt change.
Some time later he was roused by the sound of Tony's voice. "Steve?"
“Tony! Tony, please. Please. I can’t… I need…”
A few days later when the tower inhabitants had gathered for movie night, Tony pulled Steve against him on the couch and kissed him breathless. He gave in, settling against the genius’ side and pretended he hadn’t seen the money exchange hands between their teammates.
Before he could step back, Tony was moving into his space. He reached out and smoothed Steve's collar into place. A casual gesture, but proprietary in some way. As though he had a right to touch Steve whenever he liked. However he liked. "Do I make you nervous, Steve?"
“What do you need, omega?”
"Okay. Sure thing. Shawarma it is. That good for everybody else? Okay. J, hook us up."
"Yes, Sir." The words uncoiled tension he hadn't been aware he was holding, allowing him to relax into the restraints. He didn't have to think. He was here for Tony.
"Yeah, I did."
Two chapters in two stories in one day! I feel productive! Hope you enjoy and have a good weekend.
On with the show.
"Tony, Tony please."
"Yeah." Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's waist, pulling him closer. "Have I mentioned lately how absolutely perfect you are?"
Steve shook his head.
He was distracted from his thoughts by the press of Tony’s cock to his clenching entrance, body clenching, trying to suck the thick cock deep inside. Steve moaned as Tony sank deeper, stretching him wide. He took his time, pausing to rub the head of his cock back and forth over Steve’s glands, dragging another release from his overworked body, before finally burying himself to the hilt. The first bulge of Tony’s knot rubbing against his rim drove Steve into a frenzy. The material in his hands tore. As soon as they were free, Steve’s arms were wrapped around Tony’s neck, nails dragging down the length of his back.
Tony heaped the pillows into a mound at the head of the bed, draped the various blankets over the middle and bottom, and sent a gigantic Chinese order to FRIDAY before he was finally satisfied. He forced himself to go back into the living room and pour himself a drink instead of lurking in Steve’s bedroom and listening to him shower like a creep. But he wanted to. And wasn’t that a kick to the ass.
Steve breathed into Bucky’s mouth, allowing him to swallow all of the soft sounds he made. The desperate little whimpers. He felt Tony’s hand slide between his thighs again, reaching for Steve this time. He wasn’t sure what he did, but Steve arched beneath him, choking out a loud cry, shuddering helplessly in Bucky’s arms. He heard a quiet humming sound begin beneath them, and Steve seemed to lose his mind, thrashing and crying out, body rocking up against Bucky’s, Steve’s still soft cock rubbing over Bucky’s stomach.
Steve nodded, eyes glued to the floor.
When Steve finally relaxed beneath him, Tony slid out slowly, ignoring the accompanying sounds of protest. “Stay right there, sweetheart. Clench up tight. You lose even a drop of what I gave you, you’re getting punished.” He watched the stretched out ring twitch, desperately trying to clench. It only took Tony a moment to retreat to his old playroom, retrieve what he needed, and return. The plug he’d chosen was metal. Solid, heavy, and much larger than the one he’d used on Steve before. He took his time running the surface over Steve’s skin, coating it in slick. The slim tip was pressed to Steve’s entrance, tracing soft circles around the madly fluttering hole before Tony began to slowly ease it inside.
Even to Bucky, who he’d trusted with his life, Steve hadn’t been willing to admit how much he wanted children. A male omega’s sperm was sterile. The only way he could reproduce would be if he carried the child himself. Which had not been an option before. But now… The possibilities stretching out before him were dazzling. Of course, he had to survive whatever horrific medical procedure was required first. And from his experience so far, Steve doubted it would be something he’d enjoy. He took a breath, eyes fluttering open, gaze resting on the alpha’s face, the kind expression he had turned on Steve. He could do this. He could do this all day.
Steve shook his head. “No… You told me. I was bad. I lost privileges. I… I didn’t realize what they meant. But I don’t want to be alone all the time. And I want you to hold me and say sweet things to me. It makes everything better. I don’t want to be bad and lose that again…”
"Yes. Please..." The room was spinning. The only stable thing was Tony. He slid his arms around his shoulders and held on tight.
"I've... Been working on a project."
Steve set down the plate and sat in the indicated chair. “Tony?”
"And if what I want is to work you up and then put you to bed?"
“No worries.” Tony slid his sunglasses up to rest on top of his head and flashed a bright, happy grin in Steve’s direction. “You didn’t miss much. We ordered pizza, don’t worry, I got you your favorite, and finally decided on a movie. Come on, come sit!”
“My pleasure, sweetheart. Trust me, holding you is not a hardship. But can you tell me what happened or do we need to talk about it later?”
Another command was sent to the nanobots implanted in Steve’s cock, allowing it to slowly harden. He wanted to train Steve to enjoy the variety of torments Tony would be introducing him to. The first step would be to only allow him an erection when Tony was hurting him. Steve, in his innocence, would believe that to mean he was enjoying it. And then would grow to do so in truth. The idea of corrupting the American symbol of good and righteousness was delicious.
Sobs made his chest ache as he struggled in his restraints, desperate to feel even a hint of pleasure or sensation from Tony’s mouth in such an intimate place. Fingers breached him, pressing past his numb ring to rub against his equally deadened prostate. Steve could see drips of come falling from the tip of the cage as he was ruthlessly milked empty, without any of the pleasure that could accompany the act. He sobbed harder as the torture continued, Tony moaning against him in utter abandon, taking what he wanted and leaving Steve empty. When there was no longer a drop left to be wrung out of his aching balls, Tony finally pulled away.
"Lock this pretty cock up tight again, so nothing can touch it for a while?"
“No. You’re not. You’re a naughty little omega who needs to be taught a lesson. If you’d been good, you would have been allowed to sit beside me and feed yourself. You weren’t. So now your only options are to accept food from your alpha, or go hungry.”
Tony rolled onto his side to face him, head propped on one arm, looking like something from a magazine. He reached out, roughly palmed the cage. “Tell me, sweetheart, can you feel anything when I do this?”
