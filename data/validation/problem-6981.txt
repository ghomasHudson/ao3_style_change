“I have a home”, the blonde said as he straightened his back. “Back in Brooklyn, it was a small apartment but I left it untouched before the war, it must be around..?”
Loving Steve Rogers was hard, but Tony loved it. He loved every second of it despite the level of difficulty. He simply adored the one man who he needed in his life. Nobody else could understand, but he was fine with it. Steve knew, he knew that Tony was there because he wanted to. Tony didn’t wait to hear those three words back, he knew that for Steve to do all this, there must have been a reason, a really good one as well. He wouldn’t go playing with his heart like others did, he was there because of something.. And despite everything, something kept him there. Even if it wasn’t love just like Tony’s case, it was something strong, and that was more than enough for Tony.
“What do you need him for anyway? Feel free to ramble away about how much you want this unlimited power, rule the world, get rich, whatever you have in mind”, Tony said as he kept his eyes fixed on him.
“Yes you are, Herr Rogers, this was a huge success for everyone here!”, Zola’s voice was heard as the door opened, a few scientists coming inside, looking excited. He could already hear celebratory cheering outside, but he was more eager to test his recovered skills, see what else those legs could do.
“You have wings, can’t you just...fly here and ring on my doorbell or something? Why were you so eager to see me anyway?”
His words were cut short as soon as he was pushed against the wall by Steve, a dark shadow tainting the soldier’s eyes.
Their first meeting didn’t exactly turn out to be good. Neither did their second one. Or the third. In general, it didn’t meet up anybody’s expectations.
Steve ran up to the window but Tony was gone. Placing his hand on his cheek, he stared outside for a bit before he decided that it really was time to get some sleep.
He loved how open Tony was, how strong of a warrior he was, too, and how determined he was to keep Steve there despite his attempts to leave. Those attempts would have been successful, if Steve hadn't been dealing with the son of Ares, a man with a natural fire in his blood. Not only that, but he was a demigod too, one that was as pure as he was himself, and they were both experimenting and learning their likes and dislikes it seemed.
Tony smiled at the compliment, moving around a little until he could sit in the water. “Why thank you, Athenian. That’s the nicest thing that anyone ever said to me,” he teased. “I was joking by the way”
The blonde’s mouth opened, letting out another small murmur as he felt the wetness along his neck, tilting his head to one side to give Tony more access to his porcelain skin, his hands gripping tighter ever so slightly.
“I don’t want to think that he did it because of me.”, Steve rushed to reply, voice slightly raised. “He shouldn't have done it because of me…!”
Steve was always comforted by the grip around him, that’s how Iron Man would hold him, that’s what he loved. Sure he couldn’t be the weaker one in their relationship, yet, but nothing stopped him from being submissive to Iron Man. He lifted his hips, his back tensed as he tried mimicking what Tony would do to him; he slowly lowered himself onto the hard, smooth object. His mouth opened again, letting a long drawn moan escape his lips, slowly pushing himself down on the hard cold metal that was now deep inside him. His body squirmed and his mind was trying to focus on his fantasy, even though this was surreal enough to be a fantasy.
Steve's muscles coiled and moved at each small movement and he leaned his head back, shutting his eyes though the lashes fluttered as Tony moved on.
Yet, this relationship didn’t seem anything like the one he shared with any woman before, but he actually liked it that way. Steve was holding back with his emotions and didn’t express his feelings openly, it was Tony that did the talking. But every time that the soldier would rest his head against him or when he offered to share his bed with him, that alone could keep Tony happy for days. The fact that he didn’t mind telling their friends in the beginning, and then people who asked that Tony was indeed his boyfriend, also helped Tony a lot. Nothing seemed biased and when Tony finally picked up the courage to say those three words to him, Steve responded with a kind smile. If someone else was involved, that would bring Tony down, but because it was Steve, it just didn’t.
“Your kind are bullies, I should have expected as much,” Steve said, letting his hair fall from behind his ears to cover his face as he turned away from Tony. “Your ideas of friendship are questionable.”
“D-Don’t touch me!”, he exclaimed as he pulled closer to the wall, falling down and looking at the shadowy figure with horror filled eyes. The possibilities were endless and his mind was already getting paranoid thoughts of a villain breaking into the Tower to get rid of him when he was vulnerable.
Steve gripped Tony’s hand tightly, leaning close to him, their armour clattering together as he lifted his helmet slightly to kiss Tony’s lips again, desperate to do so. “You’re all I have now, Tony.”
Tony slept soundly next to the man, drawing comfort from the warm body beside him. It was strange how right it felt, how the man seemed to fit right there, next to him, despite their first meeting.
“What, a tutu and a magic wand? I hear that a lot”, the fairy frowned as he fixed his tie; he was dressed in a black suit, complete with an ironed shirt and tie that matched his wings. “Yeah, we look nothing like the fairy tales you say tell to human kids. Some do, I’m sure, but not me”
Steve moved next to Tony and looked up, watching the gentle sparkling of the golden stars. “They look even clearer tonight.”
“Believe me,nobody did until we found you inside that cockpit, frozen. Well, I did, I spotted the shield first and.. it was without a doubt..well, you, Captain America”, Tony pointed out. “And just like I mentioned..we’re miles away from New York, but we’ll depart immediately, take you back and..”, he stopped.
Reed hesitated for a moment, but nodded and did as he was told; arguing with Cap after the intense talk with Kang wasn’t something that he wanted go through. Besides, Steve and Tony were the leaders of the Avengers, if they were to face Kang soon, they had to work together again, which seemed impossible now.
“I think luck has been on my side so far," Tony said. He smiled as he joined Steve, looking down at the beautiful view.
Tony Stark knew that the truth would come out. It was inevitable, from day one. The web of lies that the Illuminati threaded was starting to break down. That’s what was happening. The beginning of the end. And at that very moment, Steve staring at him, not sure how to even confront him, made his chest feel heavy. He knew that he lied to him, that he betrayed him, that he lost every single right in the world to call him his friend. The right that he earned back after the war. Having Steve as a friend was an honour, and right now, after so long, after realising that what he did was wrong, that it would only make things even worse, it hurt. Hell, he would rather have another round with his greatest foes rather than sit there with Steve looking at him like that.
His thoughts were interrupted by Tony’s voice, who seemed to be eager to point outside the window at something. Steve slowly turned his eyes on the glass window, his expression changing into a confused one. This couldn’t be his home..it looked nothing like it, from the sky high skyscrapers to the fuming factories that seemed to tower the streets.
Steve didn’t reply to that, instead he looked outside the helicopter and kept his eyes fixed on the icy land beneath them. He closed his eyes, to indicate that he wasn’t really in the mood to talk anymore, even though when he opened his right eye to take a peek, he could see that Tony was relaxing and just enjoying the trip.
“Yeah...”, Steve muttered. He didn’t realise how blue Tony’s eyes were, they really were pretty, and the carefully trimmed beard of the other almost rubbed his own chin when he got even closer.
“You should have thought this better, pal. Breaking into a cop’s apartment? A rookie mistake”, Steve growled, pressing harder the man between his shoulder blades.
Steve didn’t really know what he was doing. He was trying to do what he’d learned before, which in truth wasn’t very much. Kissing was pretty much all he knew about. And his mind was pretty creative, which was where the dream had come from, but he knew nothing specific. Even the dream had just been their bodies gliding together.
Steve shook his head, “Everything I do, I do for my people.” he said firmly, “We are demigods; we need to look after them.”
“No need to thank me, it’s the least I can do”, Tony said as he followed him outside. The way he felt when he touched Steve’s cold hand was so strange; their hands connected at once and they fitted perfectly in each other’s, almost like they were meant to do that. No, he had to shove those thoughts away and focus on helping Steve above all.
“You can use Mr Stark’s name, sir”, he pointed out, making sure that Steve was seated just fine before ordering the suit to start with the soft buzz, the length starting to vibrate itself, starting slowly before picking a faster pace, wanting to give Steve some sort of more control over him.
It felt strange to think that Steve and him shared a deeper understanding of each other, that some of their most painful experiences, that they weren’t aware of just yet, were connected. They could help each other, he was sure that he could, but until Steve asked him to take him to Brooklyn, just like he first requested, he was going to be silent about his new adjustment to that world.
Steve shook his head. “You should be filled with pride, Spartan. Count your blessings,” he said, picking up his things and getting to his feet. “Regardless, I will lead my people and we will fight until the last man stands.”
“Big man in a suit of armour, take that off, what are you?”, Steve asked, stopping in front of the other man, looking down at him, waiting for an answer.
“You know, I’m glad that we found your apartment in his condition.. you may not able to live here but.. you could at least visit once more”, Tony said to comfort him, to which Steve nodded.
“Why are you so stubborn?” he sighed. “You said that I’m a mule, but you’re acting like one right now. Teach and be taught, isn’t what we agreed? I was having a conversation with you, Steve, no need to get all sensitive about it.”
It was true, thinking straight seemed to be impossible at this point, he was furious, disappointed, lied to, and he didn’t know if he could honestly believe Tony anymore. Maybe he was right, he couldn’t understand why he would inform him of this if he was working with them - unless he was the biggest mastermind behind the whole operation, using Steve to get the scientists out of this and be the only one in charge. Part of him didn’t want to believe that the man before him was capable of something like this, not when they spent the entire last night talking about each other, about their traumatic experiences in the battlefield. No, this had to be entirely the work of someone who had lived their entire lives without setting foot on a dangerous mine field or held a gun in their hands.
He slowly turned around and met Steve’s lips with his own to kiss him deeply, desperately. Steve’s mouth widened to the kiss, closing his eyes to let their lips slide together, eager to taste Tony's tongue again. His hand trailed its way up from Tony’s waist to stroke his hair, and Tony moved his own hands behind Steve’s back. He stroked it gently as he carried on kissing Steve the way he knew that he liked from what he had seen so far, being careful and passionate with him, enjoying the feel of Steve's fingers in his hair.
Tony reached for his shield and held it over their heads straight away, to protect them from the falling stones. “Stop, you’re going to crush the roof down!”
Tony rolled his eyes; did anybody talk that politely anymore? Maybe they did, but not in Deadwood for sure, and this strange, polite yet intimidating Irish fella sure stuck out like a fish out of the water. “You do that, maybe I’ll get to sleep with my door open now”, he chuckled, looking around. “You still have to accept the offer for that drink”, he added casually. What he was doing? Tony Stark wasn’t pleading, he was offering Rogers a chance to join the big league, and after all, he was the Sheriff.
”, he thought, feeling like hitting the man on the floor hard on the chest, make him come back to them, make up for everything that happened between them, the whole misunderstanding. And there he was, ready to give up on all hope.
“Not really… Tony and the rest of the Avengers were the ones that found me in the ice. He took me in straight away, helped me get back on my feet, and offered me a home… I'm… forever grateful for that…”, Steve trailed of, remembering the day like it was yesterday.
Tony held on Steve’s face so desperately, bringing Steve's hand to touch his own cheek, Steve's words ringing in his ears. “No... No we’re going together, you hear me? Together, that’s what we agreed, didn’t we?” he cried out, the weak smile on Steve’s face only making his anger and frustration worse. His eyes caught sight of medallion hanging down around his neck. With a sharp pull, he ripped it off his neck, placing it on Steve’s wound.
“According to you, they are lost anyway. What I’m asking you is to trust me to try and offer my help,” Tony said, offering him his hand. “Can you do that?”
“I want to visit Athens, will you stop me?” Tony said, scoffing at the soft kiss on his head. “And be with you. I mean, enjoy your company."
Tony had to hold himself back from huffing, but the suit persona had to stay up, at least for a bit more.
The large blonde was however; only ready to listen to him after he was shot back when he attempted to hit Steve with his hammer. The friction between the shield and the hammer calmed down the heat.
“So what do you say?” he asked again, enjoying the Steve's warm body against his. “Do friends act like the way we do?”
Without saying anything more, Steve jolted over the air, getting higher and higher while he flew around the terrace, ending up hovering just above the swimming pool. Tony had no idea what urged him to get closer, mesmerised by the way the blond’s hair was moving against the wind, how brightly his azure eyes were glowing, how red his cherry lips were or how firm his grip on him was, but he moved towards those lips, and he could have sworn that for a split moment, Steve did the same-
Locking Kang out of their universe and timeline seemed to be the perfect solution to their problems at that very moment, and Steve didn’t hesitate to give direct orders to the rest of the Avengers to push Kang to his limits.
Steve could feel his cheeks somewhat warmer and he couldn’t really explain why, taking a gulp of water from the bottle nearby, trying a sushi piece with a fork this time around, grimacing a bit. “The Japanese don’t cook their fish?!”, he asked Tony with a hint of surprise.
“No, not at all, help yourself out”, Tony gestured, watching the soldier disappear behind the glass doors and sighing to himself. It was true, Stane was becoming more of a threat now, and he wanted to keep quiet about Steve being who he was, following his request. Stane somehow found out, and could potentially use it to his advantage in the slyest way that Tony couldn’t see from a mile apart, unlike his encounters with Justin Hammer. And then there was Steve, who strangely enough chose to defend him way more than he thought he would. Maybe in a way he thought that he was paying Tony back for what he did for him so far, and it did make sense to Tony, after all, Steve was a man with certain moral values, out of this age. And yes, part of Tony thought that Steve wouldn’t survive in this world, later having to curse at himself for forgetting who he was really dealing with, a man who fought a war and grew up when this country was at its worst. He wasn’t an innocent young man, he was a trained soldier capable of doing great things, of maybe killing even, he was able to survive and defend himself.
Meeting Captain America wasn’t exactly like Tony pictured it to be, and there was no way of admitting to him that he still had his toy figure and toy shield locked away in his house when all the two of them did was fight and bicker.
“So I’ve been told,” Tony said with a chuckle as he held his own hands to the fire, sighing in relief when he felt warmer again. “You need to learn how to survive, right?"
“We have word that another Athenian ambassador is at the main gate," the man told him, leaning against the door and watching Tony.
’ The words from Falcon echoed in Steve's ears with a haunting drone as he brushed his hand through his hair, pushing it back and out of his face. In truth he had come to try and talk Tony out of fighting, out of war but it seemed that the Spartans took so much pleasure in it, more pleasure than he would’ve ever thought. To him, death was death, floating souls in the river Styx. Having to suffer the same fate his soul had been nearing was something he could never wish on anyone else.
He didn’t pull away. He didn’t feel the need to do so. It felt right, it felt nice, it felt like it was supposed to feel.
“Who said that you are?” Tony asked in confusion, not really understanding why Steve seemed to have taken his kiss as a bad sign. “I’ve only asked to be your friend; I don’t remember asking you of anything else.”
“I enjoyed walking in your city so far, Athenian, you should know that,” Tony said as he met Steve's eyes, cheeks growing warm at Steve's touch. “And your company is what keeps me here the most.”
Steve shook his head. “We learn to be warriors but we also learn of culture,” he said. “Aspects to help our warriors live, to create doctors and great minds.” He slowly slipped out of bed, pulling up his tunic before reaching for Tony’s hand. “Come, I will explain. I have scrolls that have knowledge of our culture and art, writing and mathematics as you have asked for.”
“Steve Rogers, yes, Mr. Stark has been expecting you”, she nodded, offering her hand to shake. “Pepper Potts, Mr. Stark’s PA”
“Yeah...”, Bucky daydreamed. He was lucky to have his girl after all this, to have someone so close to him to help him with his struggles. In a way, Steve was sort of jealous, he wouldn’t mind not having to go through all that alone. Yet, he was happy that a friend was happy, it was simply how he was.
Steve had already opened the gate, and he tugged lightly on the reigns before the horses began galloping out of their holding area and through the streets of Athens.
Tony noticed how Steve pulled away, but he'd already been used to raising his voice every day during training, and that was before he started giving orders instead, which still required him to yell. It was a natural reflex; shouting to prove a point, or to make people fear him. It was what he had learned. But he forgot that Steve was different.
Steve walked up to him. “I had to leave very early to walk to Thebes,” he said. “I suppose I am tired.”
Steve gently pulled back from Tony’s lips and looked at him as he spoke. “My life is short now, Tony,” he said. “Perhaps our meeting was only meant to be fleeting.”
“It would take time, money, organization...” Tony said with a sigh. “I’ll have to talk to someone about this, see if they really want it." His opinion regarding war, and the will of his Father, was always heard. But when it came to the ruling of the city, his involvement wasn’t really appreciated.
Steve jumped straight up, turning up the volume, his heart racing at the possibility of Tony being captured and tortured again. He only heard what happened to him a couple of days ago, and he couldn’t help but take responsibility, clearly if he stayed in the tower, he could have stopped this.
“That’s funny! I’m bigger and stronger than you, Captain! You’re just a relic, you should make way for the new soldiers that this world needs! Go back into the pit where you belong!”, he growled in the same voice that made Tony shiver.
Over the course of the next couple of days, he managed to get some electricity running in his apartment, using wires and every thing else he could salvage from the empty flats, feeling bad doing so. He couldn’t help but apologise to the non existing residents as he powered up his TV and radio, even though they weren’t very helpful and trusty. The radio however seemed easier to catch on the frequencies of the city, and that was exactly how he heard the news.
Steve leaned closer, the rippling of the water making a sound as he moved. He brushing his lips against Tony’s first, barely skimming them together, before he moved forward and pressed them together, shutting his eyes as he felt his heart rate suddenly quicken. He didn’t part his lips just yet, but he was mesmerized by how magnetic the feeling was, how their lips felt so warm and soft together.
“The old man was hardly doing his job. Got kidnapped, had to pay a big ransom to get free. Would you have been able to do any better?” Tony asked him, scanning his face.
“But you do realise that your return could mean so much more to the public. To see their hero rising up again, giving those talks of yours that got everyone pumped would be for the best, trust me. They need a hero right now, and your timing is absolutely perfect, in fact, it wouldn’t be any better, we-”
“Perhaps your mother is giving you a permission to carry on and do what you want,” Tony said with an encouraging smile. “Not being limited to having just friends in your life."
Tony didn’t expect to be so star struck by the size and glory of the temple, staring at it with an open mouth. He had never seen such a beautiful and well-tended temple before in his life.
“She always does that, jumping straight into the point, no emotional welcome back words or even a hug”, Tony shook his head at Steve, who seemed to be trying to figure out what exactly the relationship between Pepper and Tony was. They were bantering and their talk wasn’t too formal, and the way Pepper treated him clearly indicated that they were close friends even.
He looked at Tony. “You threaten my people, son of Ares. You could have prevented all of this by listening rather than being quick to persecute, if you had been humble. Bury your pride for once!” he said, trying to hide a sad glint in his eyes at resorting to violence.
“Don’t play with me like this; I know this is some sort of trap,” Steve muttered, “I would be giving you my people's knowledge, and that is all we have.”
It was time to look a bit more presentable, changing his white workout vest for his white US Army shirt, completed with the golden eagle detailing at the front and on the sleeves. His dog tags hung out around his neck and he chose to wear his dark blue jeans instead of his usual beige ones. Since Tony wasn’t around he didn’t have to look completely polished, so jeans were his pant of choice that day. He slipped his red sneakers on and headed down to Tony’s lab, standing by the door and going through the regular iris check before the doors would open.
“His name is Nathaniel Richards. He caused us so much trouble in the past; being able to travel through time and taking anyone he wishes with him can be catastrophic. We ended up in so many different timelines trying to fight our way back to our own when he faced him before. He joined the Council of Kangs after a couple of times that we defeated him; they have more power when they’re together, and we can clearly witness this right now…”
Behind Whitney Frost, a handful of men were standing, all equipped with their own guns, not looking friendly in the slightest.
“There is no need to try, you resonate a natural determination,” Steve said as he stretched a little.
“Have a seat, Rogers, wasn’t it?”, Tony prompted him, gesturing at the seat by the desk, himself not sitting on the other end, but on the desk, watching the other man carefully.
“I don’t think that he did it because of you. He wanted to fix all this and he took responsibility for his actions.”
“Can people get on top of this?”, he asked with renewed interest, glad that being outside the States practically made them unrecognisable, even though Tony had a huge worldwide fame.
“First you are eager to kill us and now you aren’t?” Steve said. “You are right; I do not understand you in the slightest. Now move, I wish to spend as long with my people as I can, my time is limited.”
Steve couldn’t help but smile in relief, this time his smile being genuine and emotional. He really wished he could take all this back, Tony was nothing like the guy he judged him to be. He laughed, looking at him with a likeable face, laughing at his nervous jokes.
Steve looked down at Tony, smiling as Tony’s fingertips moved through his hair, and he cupped the side of Tony's face in return, stroking his jaw. “More time for us, for once.”
“It does. That was a requirement during my training, and I can assure you, the cold is not my weakness,” Tony replied steadily. “You can hide inside but I’ll be outside, braving it.”
When Steve seemed more relaxed, Tony pulled his lips away for a second to lick his own fingers, coating them with saliva before moving back again, his index finger pressing slightly inside Steve.
“Pride for what? Destroying you mercilessly? At what cost, Athenian? Until the next war? I thought you came here to prevent this, and well, I want to help you.” Tony let out a sigh. “Don’t leave, we can find a solution.”
“You? Captain America? You know how this feels?”, he asked in disbelief. It might sounded a bit childish, but he didn’t seem to care at that moment. He was still shaking and Steve was there, it should have been enough to calm him down.
“You too, Tony”, Steve said. He didn’t want him to leave, Tony had been there ever since he woke up, but the moment that the billionaire closed the door behind him, he was alone again.
Tony rolled his eye as he turned to Steve who tilted his head in curiosity, wanting to find out what that was about.
A sharp gasp, followed by a murmur. He had never once felt anything inside him like that before. He could feel his cheeks burning up, scalding, eyes fluttering shut.
Tony’s cocky smile from earlier was gone, behind his glass prison. Something was wrong, he could tell, but he couldn't hear anything, even though the change in Steve’s expression and posture left little to his imagination.
“What did I say? What’s my name?”, Steve said as he stepped behind a divider, getting rid of the soggy tights and putting on some cotton boxers and dark trousers that were passed to him, walking in Tony’s view again, kneeling down and starting to tie the rough boots that came with the rest of the outfit.
“I thought it was a pleasant dream?” Tony said, moving to sit opposite Steve as his curiosity grew. “What’s the matter?”
Tony stood still; he would recognise that voice anywhere. When he eventually turned around, she was standing there, a pistol aimed at his face; why was it always the face?!
Steve listened to him, although Athenian training was tough, it was nothing like Spartans. They had a reputation for being trained at such young ages. He gave Tony a pensive look and then continued with the caressing of his muscles again.
It took him days to reach his destination and, just as he thought, the ruler didn’t really seem fond of an alliance. But they talked everything through, and Tony decided to stay in the city, so big and busy and completely different from Sparta, for a while.
“I know what PTSD stands for, I know you keep thinking about them and how you.. that you’re not going to see them again”, he carried on, softening his voice.
“Is that a better confession?”, he asked the soldier, not wanting to rub his lips, still able to taste Steve on them.
Steve tried to meet Tony’s eyes, his mouth still slightly open, and his breaths were coming faster as he swallowed down the knot in his throat to move into Tony's touch.
No, he couldn’t do that, not when Steve was so kind to him, teaching him so much, giving him things that no other had ever given him.
Tony swallowed hard when Steve brought him closer, letting out a satisfied sound at the contact. “I told you that you should have listened to me. I wanted to help you as much as you wanted to help me," he said softly.
“I’m asking because if yes then, I’ll have to move, you know," he said, hoping that Steve would get the hint.
“Rogers…?”, he asked as he sat up. He felt so tensed up, like he had been exercising for a whole day and he just realised how tired he really was.
Steve stood with his spear in his hand, shield strapped on his arm, prepared for an ambush just in case. It never hurt to be too prepared, so he was taught.
In a way, he knew that Stane was right; they had to move on, but he needed go further, to try and make use of every available source while the government kept chipping in and helping them out. His company started to face problems that were beyond his capabilities, so a breakthrough discovery would surely place them on the top of the market, far ahead Hammer Industries or even Baintronics. The man sighed and poured some liquor into one of his fancy drinking glasses, shaking it, lost in his thoughts. The liquid felt so warm down his neck, which was exactly what he needed before yet another mission in the icy cold weather. He didn’t have to actively participate, but it was fascinating to see with his own eyes what the rest of the crew would normally inform to him later. It always paid off, and he wouldn’t regret taking that decision to leave the pure luxury of his penthouse back in New York for this tent, which was still superior to the rest, if he was being honest.
The man was dark skinned and wore a tunic so large that, when he would spread his arm, it would often appear as a wing. He had the spirit of his mother’s guardian, her owl, in him, however he was a fierce warrior and so Steve took it upon himself to name him Falcon. “I am, Falcon,” he said. “I intend to leave now, in fact.”
Tony lowered his gaze, nodding again with a heavy sigh, not really wanting to look at Steve in the eye, even if he knew that there was nothing wrong with that.
“Tony.. you know that I can’t do it.. there’s no point, the world obviously doesn’t need me, I don’t think that I can offer anything wearing the star spangled outfit anymore.. I’m just Steve.. just him, nothing else”, he said sternly.
“If you’re going to talk about Brooklyn, I suggest that we leave it to a later date, Steve..”, Tony started, interrupted by Steve.
Steve’s eyes widened with shock, feeling his whole face turn a bright red with a fusion of shock, embarrassment and a touch of anger. He’d been duped and it was Tony all along. The Captain gritted his teeth tightly, furrowing his eyebrows to show him how annoyed he was but he couldn’t stop with the moans, even as he bit down hard on his lip to prevent them. The vibrations in his body were too much for him to handle, his hands frantically sliding along the metal and making a squeaking sound as he tried to clutch to the large red shoulder plates.
“And are you telling me that all Athenians follow that rule?” Tony asked. “People are corrupted, but you’re not like them from what I’m seeing. You’re trying to lead them but they are not demigods like us, they are just mortals, and mortals are weak.” He stopped at the fish market and then caught up with Steve.
“And it takes skill to wield it, and knowledge,” Steve said, smacking away the spear with all of his strength before grabbing Tony by the golden chain that kept his medallion on his neck, tugging it forward. Tony let out a cry and quickly punched Steve away when he got a hold of his medallion, pulling back and holding on it tightly, before gritting his teeth and making a move on Steve yet again, this time holding his sword.
“Because you’re my friend" Tony repeated. “And I care about your well-being. I can’t kill you, nor do I want to. You showed me things and you and you kissed me, and now you’re in my bed. I don’t want to lose that.”
Steve tilted his head as he felt his lips part, Tony’s tongue pushing forward. The moment it did, Steve let out a small sound of surprise at the warmth of Tony’s tongue filling his mouth, the taste of wine that Tony had drunk. Steve’s hands reached up and brushed through Tony’s curls, Steve didn't know what to do with his hands so he reached up and brushed them through Tony's curls because he was being touched, his body was being appreciated in ways he’d never imagined, and he wanted to touch back.
After adjusting himself better, he put an arm around Steve’s head, touching him firmly yet softly. Steve got even closer, his head resting on top of Tony’s chest, the warm heat and buzzing sound emerging from his reactor acting like his personal lullaby. Before Tony could make sure that Steve was comfortable, he realised that his partner was fast asleep and smiled to himself.
He took a while, the journey long, but eventually he arrived in the beautiful city and walked to the citadel, going to local gatherings to tell others of what he had learned and about laws that Athens was thriving on. He sat down with children, trying to teach them about democracy and the concept of it, encouraging peace and discouraging fighting.
“That’s a great turn of events, isn’t it? You really have a way of making an impression on people, Rogers”
“Natasha. Close it”, he said, in a steady voice. The portal was getting smaller, the sky appearing clean again, but all of the sudden, a silhouette dropped from it, on the very last moment. “Son of a guy”, Steve muttered, smiling widely.
“I wasn’t ashamed, I could never be ashamed! I was lucky, so lucky to have you for myself, even for a night," he replied with a shake of his head, struggling with his next words. “I was...I was scared, all right? What if you laughed? If this wasn’t mutual at all?”
Tony ran towards Whitney who was on the ground, grabbing the Gauntlet which was laying next to her. Straight away, Whitney jumped on him, pinning him down, hands around his neck.
Steve was clenching up his fists up to his face to prevent himself from showing any further signs of emotion, eyes widening in shock as soon as he heard the words that came out of Reed’s mouth. Tony was alive. A different Tony, maybe, but he was alive.
The men were confused, looking around for the exit, the walls and ground shaking, rocks falling down and taking out a few of them.
“No, I don’t like to,” Tony answered, his eyes fixed on Steve's strong back. “But if doesn’t feel right for you then I won’t keep you here."
Steve walked in, nodding with approval. “Thank you,” he said, kneeling down and slipping off his sandals.
“So you’re keeping me here against my will? I knew that you were kidnapping me! Aren't you supposed to be Captain America or whatever? Where’s my right to be free? You’re keeping me here confined and away from my own world, my people!”, Tony replied, his own voice rising.
Tony’s eyes lit up; Steve was making progress, most likely due to the injection that he got, which would hopefully cure him.
The Avengers just finished putting away the Wrecking Crew for yet another time; some criminals just never learnt their lesson, Spider-Man was so kind to remind them.
Tony clenched his teeth, walking up to Steve to push him against the wall. “I’m trying to be honest, I’m trying to help you and yet you’re accusing me of lying, Athenian. Why don’t you see it? Why?” he cried as he held him in place.
Tony nodded at him with a smile. “If we fall today, we’ll fall together," he said as he helped Steve up. “We started this together; we’ll end it like that.”
Steve took a long time to recover, not hearing one word from his mother as a consequence for his actions. He was now impure, and would have to redeem himself.
“You know, the dead aren’t really talkative, they never really reply to your questions,” he said with a huff.  “Those bastards."
“That’s not it. There’s something else too, something that you won’t tell me.”, Steve said calmly for now, finally facing the corpse and sighing, placing his fingers over his eyes and shutting them. It wasn't just a way to pay his respects; he couldn't handle another moment of watching Tony in that state.
Tony but his lip, trying to think of what he actually wanted to say. “I don’t think that friends do what we’re doing right now.” Steve frowned but Tony shook his head. “No, misunderstand me, we are friends. But it seemed that right now we want something more? I don’t want to be just another friend of yours. I want to be someone to you.”
It was so amazing, how a simple embrace, a common hug, could be so unique and so soul touching. That was just the beginning. Tony’s nightmares didn’t exactly stop; but it didn’t matter, Steve was sleeping by his side, waking up when he would feel Tony even switching sides in his sleep, making sure that he knew that his guardian, his soldier, was there to protect him, to comfort him if he needed to. It worked both ways; Tony would do anything to ensure that Steve was feeling well, that he knew that he was doing what was best and encouraged him to try and find his lost friend. They were each other’s pillars, more than ever, and nothing would have happened if Tony didn’t finally let down those walls and let Steve in. They were together now, and nothing else mattered. They were unstoppable, they could anything. All that because they were finally together.
Steve’s gaze softened. “No need to thank you, I’m just stating the truth here”, he replied as he got a bit closer to Tony. “You know.. when I lost my balance earlier and we fell into the pool.. I was focused, it was just the fact that you were, um, so close to me-”
Steve opened his eyes; he wouldn’t exactly call it flying, more like hovering a few inches above ground, which was still amazing to begin with.
“I want a tour of the facilities first. And meet everyone involved. Then I can give you my final answer”, he decided, his arms crossed, his look stern and decisive.
“No, I would like to find out about the whereabouts of some people and then visit them. I’m sure you can locate them with your tech, I tried to access it last night but they asked for a password”
“I’m not a savage, I’m as cultivated as you, you know,” Tony insisted. “Trust me, you’ll be surprised.”
“Did they say who they are?”, Steve asked. He didn’t normally have visitors, besides the usual officials, but since he kept declining their offers, they stopped coming over.
“Where have you been? It doesn’t matter now, I had to keep Stane busy because he’s fuming up there”, Pepper replied, holding documents close to his chest. “Tony, be careful in there, will you?”, she said before Tony rushed into the elevator, Steve following him without really thinking.
Tony followed Steve, sitting down beside him. “Let me take care of this," he muttered, and he disappeared.
Tony rubbed his head for a bit, and then he splashed water in Steve’s direction. “I appreciate that you took your time to come into a conclusion concerning my physical appearance. That wasn’t sarcasm.”
Tony smiled to him in return. “No need to thank me, I said it again.. I want to help you in every way I can, and the fact alone that you acknowledge it is good enough for me”
He looked at Tony, a man of such power looking so powerless at that moment, looking so childlike and vulnerable. Steve nudged him lightly, “Come on, my pupil, the day breaks.”
The top floor of the Avengers Tower was occupied by Captain America, Bruce Banner, Thor, and even Black Widow and Hawkeye dropped in to help. Maria Hill offered her services just as much as everyone else, and Rhodey was spending all his time trying to locate his best friend.
“I mean, we’re doing just fine with you not talking, right? You can understand me so it’s all good”, Tony continued.
“Yeah, of course I will”, he snorted as he put more pressure on Steve’s hips, his fingernails digging into the skin and leaving his red marks on it. “Do it for me, moan like you did for Iron Man”, he commanded.
Tony was truly amazed by Steve’s ability to switch from the light bites to the deep, longing kisses, enjoying every moment of them as he pushed his head closer. “Steve. Can we..?” he asked with a soft gasp.
Steve looked at him carefully and then focused on the circle of light; in a strange way, the light felt inviting, comforting even. “It has the power to give you alive..”, he said as he scooted a bit closer to examine it. “I think that it’s beautiful, makes you one of a kind..”, he blurted out.
Tony had lost count of the weeks he spent in that strange, new universe. He was starting to fall apart, but tried his hardest not to let it show. He really did feel like a prisoner, like he was back in that cave, kept there against his will because others wanted to use him. This was no different, apparently he was needed for a reason that was beyond his understanding, or, safer to say, beyond on what they would let him know.
Steve smiled a little and shook his head. “I had come here to prove my own people wrong. That what I had heard about your ruling - that you lead your men to death, that you had no soul and spat fire with your words - I had come to prove them wrong. But it seems that I was the one that was mistaken. I cannot change a person, nor should I attempt to change a perception of one. I should have trusted in my people and their words; they are as knowledgeable as they are renowned to be, I am a fool to have thought otherwise,” he said, turning his back on Tony and heading toward the door.
“Yes… that’s how I've found the rest of them… They just… fell from the sky. If there is a rift there, it’s gone. It would appear then disappear in seconds after it spat out whoever passed through with it.”
The sound of sirens was heard in the back, and more noises were coming in from the main entrance. Steve turned towards Tony, asking for an explanation.
“Did you find anything?”, he asked the scientist who in his own turn, shook his head. “Where on Earth is he…”
“I thought I made myself clear. I didn’t want you to leave me...” He said softly, holding his shield up without even looking at the man who charged at him, protecting himself with his large weapon.
Steve’s body tightened as the suit pulled back, instead wrapping the red powerful gauntlets around his body and hoisting him to sit on its lap. He leaned forward for a while, trying to catch his breath from the sudden movement. His hair flopped forward; already beads of sweat trickled down his temples as his face remained tainted a rosy red. His eyes darted down as he saw the new extension, biting on his lower lip. He wanted to feel that slick cold metal inside him again; he needed to feel pleasured somehow, especially when his own body ached with lust. He had an idea as to what he should do but it was just a case of plucking up the courage and doing it. His hands sliding down the tri-beam plate down to the waist pleats, etching every detail of the suit into his mind. The twitch of the long fingers around his back made his muscles shift, “Do I--” He stuttered, looking into the glowing eyes of the suit for approval.
“Good evening, fellas”, he said loud enough to be heard, and Tony couldn’t help but shiver when he heard the accent that slipped from his words.
“Dimension travel, that’s a thing apparently. Earth 616, we might want to write that down. I've met… another you. He was a bit taller and more built…”
The rest of the hot chocolate was tasted but never finished; the winner was pretty clear at that point, and Tony rewarded him in the way he knew best.
“You are dealing with me! What the hell did you think that you do here? Ruining people’s live, you did this to me and everyone in that hospital! You are cowards, all of you, you- aaah!”
He really did, from back in the day when he was a child, when he would rarely have some time to relax, when he was walking back home with bloody, dirty knees, clinging on the paper bag in his arms, the medicine he managed to get for his mother in it. Walking up the road and staring back at the sunset was one of the few memories he still held dear to him. It was even the same during his Cap days, when exhausted he would look back at the people he would save, the terror himself and his commandos would prevent, smiling to himself and finally feeling that he was actually doing something good. But now? Seeing the sky of the city he truly loved like that, and to know that if he headed down to his old neighbourhood the sight would be nothing but devastating? No, he wasn’t even sure if he could take that sight, but he had to brace himself and do it.
“Those are not warriors, they are nothing like us! Where’s their training, their teachings? They aren’t allowed to even consider themselves Greeks," Tony kept insisting, his fellow Spartans agreeing with his words, eager to go to war as they polished their shields and helmets.
“You were going to be with me anyway,” Tony said, reaching out to push Steve's hair back out of his face. “I think you meant more time alone. Right?”
“Take it as a social experiment of some sort,” Tony said. “We’re going to set our own rules. I say that you let your desires speak first, Athenian, then judge your actions.”
Steve gazed, following Tony’s finger and piecing the constellations together. “I don’t see many but they are beautiful. One day I wish to touch one, just to capture their beauty,” he said. “You know, when you see something so beautiful you just need to hold it?”
“I wish not to stay with those who drink the blood of my people, son of Ares,” Steve said trying to walk to the door,   taking long strides to be faster than Tony.
“Spectacular,” Steve said, smiling as he lowered his lips to Tony's neck. “I haven’t slept so well in my life. You, Spartan, are truly gifted.”
They eventually started to get along, and much to Tony’s dismay, his father seemed to be a common subject to discuss. Steve was a clever man, he picked up how uncomfortable that topic seemed to make Tony, and Tony was grateful when Steve dropped his father as a conversation starter.
The billionaire in the black and golden suit stared at the man’s tensed figure as the doors shut behind him.
“I didn’t start this, but if you're going to be persistent and stubborn.. we started this, together”
Tony raised his shoulders. “So did your Tony. He needs to evolve constantly, to create something better, to make sure that he can face any threat that the universe will throw at him, he’s a futurist-“, he trailed off, realising that this was pointless; Tony was dead, he surely didn't see this coming, did he?
“What happened to our talk from earlier?” he asked. “I thought that I would see the proud day that I could march into Athens as a friend, but to you, the only way I can reach your city is bound in chains, a prisoner of war. I know very well what you preach to be, Athenian, and I seek far more than simple education from you. I want to learn the ways of the humans, I want to embrace the human side of me, maybe even find love, just as you said. I want to be respected, not feared, and you seem to know the way.”
After what it seemed endless hours of agony, Tony having to make sure that ice was untouched and that nobody did anything to get in the way of the Captain’s transfer to the main scientific headquarters of the camp, he was finally gazing upon the Sentinel of Liberty himself, lost amongst the different kinds of equipment, men with masks running around, making calculations, adjusting the temperature of the room as the ice was starting to melt around the frozen soldier.
“I'm… great…!”, Tony smiled, and he wondered why he even bothered reacting that way when his fear was so visible on the way he reacted to this shocking revelation.
“Entertain me?” He asked, narrowing his eyes even more, slightly biting on the inside of his lower lip as he shied away, a bashful look on his face with the heat rising to the tips of his ears and turning them a bright red.
“I am no mortal. I am the son of Athena,” he said in a firm voice, being blunt as always. “Do you not wish to stand to greet guests, or do you deem yourself higher than the culture of our elders?”
“Of course they are waterproof, do you think that I would make them into jet boots but let water destroy them?”, Tony shook his head as he got out as well, shivering lightly. “Let’s go change, it’s getting darker and colder. I bet you’re starving too”
“I’m doing it.. I’m walking...”, Steve muttered, mostly in disbelief. The steps felt light, despite the appearance of the sturdy prosthetic legs, which reminded him of armoured boots that knights used to wear, or rather, space suits featured in those movies that everyone seemed to love nowadays.
“I understand,” Steve said softly, keeping his arms tightly wrapped around himself. He walked on, keeping quiet for a while.
“I’m not him, sadly. You’ll have to deal with me and what I’m saying is that I ain’t moving from here until I make sure that all the resources have been accounted for. We can’t afford losing the slightest of them now, do we?”, Tony replied as he stepped into a tent, that looked nothing like a tent after all. It was huge, full of wires and computer screens, satellite disks just sitting outside; it was his temporary home, and he did his best to have his signature mark over everything, including the bed that was nothing like the rest of the bunk beds in all other tents. Everything screamed Tony Stark, the etiquettes on the clothes, the computer screens, the faint smell of good brandy in the air.
Preparing himself, he approached the punching bag, before landing a swift kick that sent it flying across the room.
Steve’s nod was all Tony could ask for, and with another slow movement, he tilted his chin forward, lips against Steve’s as he closed his eyes. Then he pulled back slightly, watching Steve. It wasn’t a passionate kiss, barely even a kiss at all. It had just been brief - he didn’t want to scare Steve off - but he wanted to show Steve affection in a more innocent way. Just like Steve was himself.
“Sheriff Rogers, reporting in”, the blonde man finally said, turning his gaze to Tony. He didn’t have a thick, strong accent, but Tony could still detect his Irish roots in it, especially when he pronounced his name. “And you are..?, he asked.
“You know..directing such a huge company can be dangerous..”, Tony shrugged, and Steve noticed that the man held on his chest protectively for a split second, like he was hiding something from him. “Either way, I’ll show you around now”, he said quickly, getting back inside the glass elevator and waiting for the other man to follow him.
“I’m sure that you do, but now’s not the time. Hand over the Gauntlet, Tony, we can catch up later.”
Tony narrowed his eyes; being ordered around by someone else, especially when it came to a newcomer, wasn’t something he was looking forward to. “Did Nick tell you to say that too?”, he asked between his teeth.
Steve nodded firmly, taking in a couple of sharp breaths as he tried to stop his body shaking. “Can we..?” he asked meekly.
He kissed Steve right away to ease him but Steve’s eyes widened and he inhaled, gasping sharply as he felt the finger, letting out a loud shocked sound with the breath. “Tony?” he asked, needing the reassurance as his body tensed.
“You think so? I was starting to doubt this, you know, after everything. You should take credit too, you were the first to undergo this procedure and make it out successfully, you started this”
Steve managed to sneak in the Tower and he silently took out a good number of guards, retrieving his shield from the room he had been using, but just like he expected, more guards were there to greet him as soon as he got into the main hall to step into the elevator.
“Now!”, Reed called over the intercom, and with Steve’s call, the combined, synchronised attack of the Avengers threw Kang deep into his own portal, disappearing with him.
Steve heard the automated voice again and he raised his head to look the suit in the eyes, thinking it was his dizzy state of lust making him hear such things as his body began to move up and down, catching a rhythm on the vibrating length inside him, his moans became more frequent as beads of sweat trickled down each bump, over his defined muscles that were tensing and relaxing to each movement. His blonde hair appearing dark as it was dampened by sweat, clinging to his skin.
Tony was holding back his own breath as Steve moved under him, the other arm moving to hold the soldier’s hands up, above his head as he moved closer, the distance between them shortening. He knew that Steve was aware of what he was going to do; after all, he was always doing those sorts of things on him, always preparing him before he would get inside him.
It felt nice to have casual conversations like that and for both of them to let go of their constant worries, relaxing for what it seemed ages. In fact, meeting each other seemed to be the highlight of their days lately.
Tony sighed contentedly as his fingers moved up to Steve’s hair, running through it as Steve carried on with the soft kisses. “If you liked it, we can do it again.”
“I don’t think that this has to do anything with Bucky, Tony..”, Steve said in an attempt to not make the conversation awkward, not sure where Tony was taking it, even though for a strange reason, his own heartbeat started to pick up.
“Don’t worry, I’m used to being up early for training and school," Tony reassured him, rubbing his eyes. “How was sleeping in a Spartan bed?”
He couldn’t stay behind; the prophecies spoke clearly when they said that Steve would die because of him, and Tony had to be there to ensure that the Athenian would survive the attack at least. It was his time to wear his armour, red and gold, in the colours of his city, his eyes filled with emptiness as the feeling of rage overtook him.
Turning his back to him, he headed outside the room, locking it behind him. He had to do this, Tony forced his hand, it was for his own good, he kept repeating to himself. He avoided looking at the anger in Tony’s eyes; it was better to be hated by him rather than seeing another corpse join the ones already in the morgue. It was time for him to pay a price; to be hated by someone who he loved… did he really think of that? That he loved Tony…? He shook his head again. This wasn’t the time to question his possible feelings for someone who wasn't even alive any more; he really had to stop doing that, it would hurt less more, but it seemed that he never, ever learnt.
“Of course not, Reed.”, Steve replied, shaking his head. His voice was eerie calm, haunting even. He was devastated, he had no idea why all this was happening and it shook him, finally realising how much Tony’s loss shook him. “How can I be… when all this is happening?”, he continued, gesturing at the numerous bodies around the room, not even looking at them now.
“If I said that I do, that I do need you here to help, will you consider that another one of my lies?” Tony said, clenching his fists as he watched Steve walk away. “Because there, I've said it. I mean it. Whenever you want to believe me or not, that’s entirely up to you.”
“Sorry about that. Yes, it has been hard. I’m skeptical about this project, Stark. Why me? Why now? If you had this technology under development, one would think that you would offer it to every soldier, no, not just the military, anyone who has to go through this, some of them since birth. It feels suspicious, selfish even.”
“I think he should come in, Tony, we’re not barbarians. If we don’t let him in we might as well join the Persians," Rhodey said carefully.
“You don’t know me,” Tony sighed in frustration. “You don’t know me at all. Do you want to risk it? What do you have to lose?”
“I’m more than just skilled, I can safely vouch for the safety of every citizen in this town, Mr. Stark”, Steve replied confidently. “I can reassure you that all of you will be safe under my watchful eye”, he nodded.
Steve soothed the marks over with kisses once more. All this time he’d been yearning to love someone and now he finally could. What was more; the man was a fellow demigod, who shared responsibilities just as he did. Tony was someone who he could pour all of his emotions out to and Steve kissed his skin over and over, enjoying the faint blush on Tony's cheeks.
The Captain didn’t really seem into it, and Tony wasn’t judging him either; it was hard to put himself into his shoes, but he was sure that he would react differently. On the other hand, he didn’t know the circumstances in which Steve found himself before he was waken up. Or rather, he did; the man sacrificed himself to save everyone, and now he woke up, well alive, decades afterwards to find the world he once thought he saved in that state. On second thought, if he thought about it more, he would be as devastated as Steve was, if his technology made this world worse instead of improve it, just like he expected.
“Being the son of the goddess of wisdom does have benefits,” Steve replied continuing with the gentle strokes.
Steve gave him a smile, but it wasn't happy in the slightest. A sad smile. That was exactly what Tony needed, but he didn't seem to get anything more these days. “You’ll see.”
Steve's hands rested on top of Tony’s head, fingers brushing through his curly hair as he felt the kisses, and he closed his eyes the moment he felt Tony’s hand along his front. His tunic slipped off his shoulders, down to his waist, and he gasped a little, opening his eyes to peer at Tony once again as he pursed his lips together, cheeks flushed.
Steve looked down again, saluting at the crowd, receiving yet another loud cheer. He sighed in relief as he stepped back inside, rubbing the back of his head.
“You better get used to staying here. You’re not going anywhere until we figure out what is happening.”, Steve finally replied. He would hate to keep someone under custody like that, like a common criminal, but Tony wasn't making this easy for him in the slightest, not cooperating. Not to mention that every time that he looked at him, he was reminded of his Tony, his death, his last argument with him.
“Now you’re just making me blush, Tony”, he teased him in return, looking at the rose coloured sky. The sunset was beautiful from up there, that was for sure, and he smiled widely when Tony sat back and stared at the sun.
And without a warning, he looped closer and kissed Steve’s cheek before waving at him and flying out of the window.
Steve moaned even louder as he felt Tony’s breath against his ear, tilting his head back to try and feel him on his cheek. “Tony!” he cried out, encouraged by the pleasure surging through his body, and by Tony’s words, trying his hardest to push back to feel him deeper. His eyes would roll back if he were in any more pleasure.
“Put that suit on, let’s go a few rounds”, Steve said coldly. “Let’s see what makes you special”, he hissed, his hand reaching for him.
“He’s dead.”, Steve cut Tony’s sentence. “Tony died… trying to save us… after I've told him what he did wrong.”
“Yeah, sure”, he replied without really thinking about it twice. He didn’t expect to like being around Tony Stark, but once he got to know him more, he seemed like a genuinely nice and fun person. He was glad that he took Happy’s advice and forgot anything that he ever read about him in the magazines.
They watched the rest of the film while Steve was doing his commentary, Tony asking him all kinds of questions. He seemed reserved at first, but the more Tony asked him, the more answers he was getting out of him. It was just like he expected, Steve was telling him the real deal, not what the pictures showed, how serious he had to be, but also what the films didn’t show, how close he was with the Commandos, Bucky, the rest of his friends, the ladies he developed feelings for even. Tony was listening to him very carefully, staying quiet and just letting the man take everything out of his chest, appreciating more than anything the fact that he was talking to him at that very moment. Before they could even realise, the film was over, but Tony didn’t really move away, besides disconnecting his reactor from the projecting device.
He'd spent so long painting him, copying every small detail and shade on Tony's skin, and it made Steve realise how magnificently sculpted Tony was, as if he hadn't realised enough the night before when his lips had been his guide. He felt even more drawn to him; he wanted to explore him more. So, instead of replying, Steve continued with the passionate kisses to Tony’s neck, his long blonde hair falling to glide along Tony’s skin. Steve hadn’t felt so inspired to draw anyone, and yet Tony had managed to catch his eye right away, a muse to Steve already.
Steve narrowed his eyes as he leaned closer, the presentation on the screen showing different blueprints, switching to different figures of people who were missing limbs with prosthetics attached to them. They didn’t look like simple prosthetics tho, they looked almost..robotic, equipped with weapons and all kinds of functions that could help them in the field.
“And what if I want to know you?” Tony rushed to ask. “You are an interesting person, that’s a fact.”
“I need to tell you something, we need to stop them before the press conference, all this is wrong-”
Tony gasped at how warm Steve was, slowly but steadily managing to move his finger deeper inside, feeling Steve's body draw him in. “Just listen to me, focus on me," he said again, giving Steve as soft kiss of encouragement before bringing a second finger close to his entrance, waiting until Steve stopped squirming to press it just below the first one to let Steve get used to the feeling.
Steve was used to being subject to experimentation so he wasn’t as nervous as he would’ve been if it were other people looming over him, but it was just an AI, it was a machine, it wasn’t human and Tony had reminded him again and again that they wouldn’t judge him - which is why the man sought solace within his machinery. The Captain did as he was told, nodding and sitting on the table, next to the suit, looking at him curiously. It was probably a new way of putting the armour on, he thought to himself.
“How can you know that?! Huh?! You never tried, you never gave me a chance to prove it!”, Tony yelled his grip on his hair tightening.
Stane groaned in agony as he let Steve fall down, knocking Tony away with his strong arm, sending him flying towards the glass door, shattering it to pieces.
There shouldn’t have been a moral dilemma for Steve, but of course, he wouldn’t help it but create one. The project was unique, one of a kind, and could give birth to so many more projects that could help not only soldiers, but everyone else, anyone in need. The possibilities were endless, and being the stepstone for something great really filled him with a sense of righteousness, of responsibility.
It was Steve’s turn to scratch the back of his head, looking away for a moment, hoping that his pink cheeks weren’t visible.
“You’ve showed me a certain kindness in Thebes, Steve. That’s how I show mine,” Tony replied, blinking a couple of times at Steve’s reserved reaction. “And I’m asking for you to forgive me earlier attitude.” But of course, it made sense. Tony remembered his title. Steve was the son of the virgin goddess and he'd said himself that he wanted to stay pure.
Steve walked back into the room, his hair neatly pushed back, allowing his chiselled facial features to be more the centre of focus.
“Like I said, you’re not experiencing any out of body experience or anything like that. I don’t know what you think it’s going on now, but you need to be seated inside about it. I know the serum prevents-”
Steve felt the cold overwhelm him, coughing up more blood as it began to pool in his throat, his body shaking. He looked up at Tony. “You... Always wanted to go...to Olympus together. M-maybe... I’ll... get there before you,” he said with a small, weak smile. He coughed a little more, trying to hold onto Tony’s hand. “I... I love you Tony... I fell... for you...” he stuttered, becoming weaker by the second.
“It’s really beautiful, I really think that," Tony continued, trailing his fingers across the image, admiring the detail that Steve put in his work as he tried to get used to the sweet weight on his shoulder.
With another loud cry, he grabbed the spear from the man and stabbed him with it, kicking the body away as he dropped to his knees, letting Steve hold on to him as he scanned the wound with his eyes. His hands trembling as he placed them over the wound, trying putting pressure on it, but his hands only grew bloody in a matter of seconds.
“I think the others might have figured something out. About your condition. Come on boy, let’s go”, he said, hitting his hip.
“That’s interesting,” Tony nodded, stretching as Steve took a sip from the large cup. “Well, I’m comfortable here, but I will feel even better after I’ve take a bath.”
Tony watched him turn, gently slipping the rest of his tunic off before reaching around Steve to place his hands on Steve’s stomach and help him up to his knees. He held onto Steve's body lovingly, unable to resist admiring his muscular build on full display. Tony took his time to trail his lips on Steve's bare back, still holding firmly onto him to feel him shivering and trembling slightly under him.
“It’s strange you calling you..um..Steve, you’re the Captain..but if that’s what you prefer now”, Tony said after getting another sharp look from Steve, huffing in content when Tony finally accepted to drop his alias.
“I’m sorry for not being there, Peggy.. I’m sorry..”. His eyes felt heavy, but he didn’t allow himself to cry, not when he was supposed to be strong and move on. He was allowed to mourn, but he couldn’t afford mourning the past and not moving on ahead. The real question was, if he wanted to do that, if he wanted to live in a new world where nothing was the same; he lacked something to live for, and that sure was a self destructing thought.
“You may continue I will just... Find elsewhere,” Steve said, trying not to look at Tony and his well-toned body.
Tony moved one of his hands to hold Steve’s chin, turning his head back and bringing him closer as he heard his name being called. It encouraged him to thrust in deeper, aiming for that sweet spot that he was aware that it would send Steve into pure pleasure. “Just a little more," Tony groaned, breathing heavily against Steve's ear.
Tony blinked a couple of times, waiting to see if he would say anything else, but he kept silent, not discouraged in the slightest when people starter to murmur around him. The new sheriff looked surprisingly young, and didn’t even greet him. Surely, he had no idea who he was dealing with. He coughed and raised an eyebrow when the man ignored him. Sighing out loud, he stood up and walked over, leaning his back against the wooden counter, inspecting the man’s profile.
After a while, he found himself picking his pace up and running back, his hair hiding his eyes as they filled with tears. He was hurt, his constant faith in humanity often let him down, and he just didn’t want to see any more of his friends suffer and die in battle. Being gifted with eternal youth was often a curse; he had seen so many of his friends die before his eyes that he begged the gods to protect them when going into battle, but still  they wouldn’t return. He was sick, tired of such pointless violence, and now his entire home was under threat yet again from one of the most feared armies known to man.
Tony decided to set off the next day, for the leader of Thebes had requested his presence. Once again, he wanted to negotiate Thebes’ allegiance in the upcoming war that had already started to break out. Tony didn’t really trust him, but he had to do it, and so set off.
“Really? What happened?” Tony asked again, and then he saw how shy Steve seemed to be. “You know, dreams are mostly signs sent from the gods.”
“That’s not what people want, though. Yeah, you might consider yourself a bit outdated, but that’s exactly what it’s needed right now. A blast from the past, back when things were different, well Brooklyn was still standing, for example”
He was lost in his thoughts for so long, that he almost didn’t hear the snarls and growls of the wolves that circled him, and he stood up to defend himself with his spear, launching forward for attacks. The rest of the pack ran away when he finished one of them and Tony growled right back.
He didn’t complain when Steve dragged him quickly to the car, he just smiled at him a bit tired as Steve started talking about how comfortable and fast the plane trip was, soon distracted by the loud noises of traffic. Tony chuckled as he scheduled their route in a way that Steve wouldn’t be able to see any of the monuments on their way to the hotel, wanting to show him everything on his own. Indeed, Tony planned this trip in every detail, hearing all about Paris being “the city of love” from Pepper, and even though he wasn’t really the romantic type of guy, Steve somehow managed to get that side of him to shine brightly.
Tony’s eyes widened; this was the first time that someone spoke so genuinely to him in response to his traumatic experience. It felt so soothing, to know that someone out there understood him and didn’t expect him to act like the society expected from him was such a huge relief.
“Not bad, Cap, glad you decided to grace us with your presence. And thanks for the ride”, Natasha smirked, jumping on the bike as soon as it was vacated, driving off despite Steve’s protests.
“Well, remind me to teach you a couple of things about American humour, Steve” Tony replied, waving and walking outside across the road.
“Very well.. I just came in to say that the first bunch if helicopters are leaving soon, the rest will stay behind to pack away, so if you could come out soon enough, that would be great”, he said as he left the tent, pulling his hood up again.
“I came to check out the shower, you told me to..”, he said, stuttering for the first time in that century. He was used to see people changing in front of him because of his army days, but Tony wasn’t a fellow soldier and this was his own bathroom, he was technically the intruder.
“You’re loyal to your cause and beliefs, Athenian, and whether you believe it or not, we Spartans do appreciate loyalty very much. You can’t change the way people think, especially if they are following the words of the Gods. However, you might suggest what you initially had in mind about your way of ‘helping’ us," Tony finally said. He could see how uncomfortable the man seemed to feel, especially after their short brawl. “You can have your weapons and we can discuss this in private if you wish," he suggested.
Steve kissed the top of Tony’s head. “My apologies for all of this, having to deal with the son of virgin goddess must be difficult for you.”
“Because I have a duty, a duty to live up to my name, do I not?” he asked, conflicted by the way that Steve argued. “Being the son of the god of war… I can’t bring peace, can I?”
“So, did these guys put you in the loop? I can give you a tour of the facilities and then we can start getting ready.”
“And what makes you think that we don’t possess that attribute? What makes you think that we need you, of all people, to teach us? We were taught a lot during our training, Athenian, and your teachings and words mean nothing to us. Do not speak like you understand any of us, you did not grow up here. Every Spartan that you see here, alive, is already a warrior from the moment of his birth. What makes you a warrior, huh? You fight with words full of promises and beauty. We can do that as well, but choose to fight with what really matters, our bodies and minds. We don’t want your teachings, Athenian, it means close to nothing to us," he finished, gritting his teeth the moment that Steve raised his chin, shaking him off.
This was over. He had to prepare an army, he had to be in top shape for the next assault, not mourning lost opportunities and pining after lost causes. He couldn’t understand the way Steve was thinking, but he'd offered to learn and been plainly rejected. And that was his reason for giving up in first place. It had really shaken his sense of pride.
“I can’t hate you, Tony. I love you, and I will forever. You’re stuck with me for a lifetime”, Steve replied softly, whispering in Tony’s ear.
And there he was now, looking outside the window of Tony’s private jet, asking him to point out the different monuments as they were left the quiet clouds and started their landing in the French capital. He was restless, talking way more than usual and Tony had to cover his ears with his headphones, blasting off music so he could get some hours of sleep. The meeting was going to last a day, but Tony had managed to get the approval from Pepper to relax and visit Paris with Steve on their own for a couple of days.
“I know. You can spot everything from here,” Tony said as he raised his hand, trying to point at the constellations. “The North Star, Orion’s Belt. I’m sure I can see more.”
“I don’t know, I don’t know what close friends do, or what is even acceptable. I just know that I want to carry on doing those things with you, it feels right to me, and that, that jolt I feel when you touch me, and it can’t only be me, right? You feel it too?”
“You want people to drop on their knees and pray, you want them to kiss your feet, how is that not abusing your power? Because I’m not going to give you that pleasure,” Tony replied as he shook his head. Steve was right, his pride was something that he valued too much to let go that easily.
Tony watched him as he left, the image of Captain America he heard so much about replaced by Steve Rogers, another human being, a lost soul just like his, waiting for something big to happen and reunite them all again. And for the first time in his life, Tony Stark was sure about this, he knew he found his true purpose, a place where he belonged, amongst people like him, who he intended to keep close, not push away like he always did.
“I think that the ability to walk again is a good enough offer”, Steve decided to reply before the two scientists had a chance to speak. “And to get out in the battlefield again, of course.”
Steve eventually stopped as he reached Tony’s hip bones, moving back up to kiss him again, starting to become accustomed to their tongues sliding together as they kissed. Then he pulled back to lie by Tony’s side instead, his hands continuing to smooth up and down his torso. “How was I?” he asked.
“I thought that you could understand me,” he replied softly, lowering his gaze even though he didn’t want Steve to go, not when he was holding onto him like that. “Clearly I was wrong all along. Go back to Athens if you want to, I’ll not bother you again.”
“That’s the Long IslandNationalCemetery”, Steve finished off, a heavy sigh coming out of his mouth as he sat back on the couch. “A graveyard..”
“I’m sure that you are. This job, however, requires a certain level of.. disclosure, Mr Rogers. I’m sure that you’re well aware of who I am?”
“See? You say all those things and my people know nothing about that. They focus so much on training and learning to kill, that reading and writing, and even art is left behind. They just focus on making us real warriors, and don’t get me wrong, that’s not a bad thing but... it’s not just that that matters, right? There’s more.”
That was good enough for Steve; he didn’t like Stane, the way he talked to Tony, even the way he looked at him raised his alarms, and now he was proven right. He knew what he needed to do; he was going to save Tony. Even if the world didn’t need Captain America, it was obvious that Tony needed him now more than anything else. His eyes fell on a small bag in the corner of the room that he didn’t notice before, peeking from behind the curtains. That didn’t belong to him, he was sure, Tony must have left it there when they first entered the apartment. With initial hesitation, he unzipped the bag, letting out a huff when he took out the contents of it.
The fall of SHIELD only meant one thing; that the Avengers were needed once again, and he didn’t hesitate to suggest that the Earth’s Mightiest Heroes stayed in his Tower. It was fun, trying to allocate everyone to rooms and floors; getting used to a full household was certainly something that Tony wasn’t used to and he quite secretly enjoyed the constant company. Working in the lab with Bruce, bumping into Clint and Thor in the kitchen, arguing about the quality of TV shows with Natasha and sparring with Steve.
Sure, words could add more to what he wanted to convey, but Steve Rogers was a man of actions above all. And it was then that a whistle was heard, a small giggle and a loud ‘finally’ coming out of the doorway, too late to pull back from a kiss that felt about right in terms of length and passion. Iron Man, or rather, Tony Stark didn’t pull back either, and it was the best thing he could ever ask for.
“See? He says it himself, he didn’t see me or feel me," the smaller man replied stubbornly, leaving the blonde to frown and turn his gaze to the men in the bed yet again.
“A few plays,” Steve said, walking over to the scrolls and tablets. “I did not come fully prepared to teach them to the people of Thebes, so you will have to rely upon my knowledge.” He placed a couple on the table, urging Tony to sit next to him as he began to go through them, starting with mathematics, which wasn’t his forte at all.
“I couldn’t agree more” Tony agreed, stroking Steve's cheek with the back of his hand. “I’m glad you came all the way to Sparta, despite everything that happened between us. I felt that we bonded, in a way.”
Steve nodded, following him back inside, both of them dripping and giggling to themselves, still excited over the fact that Steve was now able to fly.
The device he developed in order to survive, the arc reactor, clean energy he was so famous of was embroidered into him, but the world wasn’t meant to know, not like that. They needed a strong figure to help them rebuild their world and put their trust in him, and someone like Steve, who Tony looked up to, fitted those criteria. Yet, the soldier didn’t have a clear fault like that on him, even though his attitude sure told him that the Captain had demons of his own to face. The least Tony could do was appear strong and make sure that his help was offered when asked, and not to cause Steve to seek out someone else who was more capable of giving him the help he needed to get back on his feet. It might have even been considered selfish, but Tony wanted to be the one to bring Steve to his century, to earn that pat on the head and the Captain’s approval he was so eagerly looking for.
Tony looked at him and just nodded, buttoning up his own shirt and getting hid blazer. “I understand that you need some extra time but.. you can’t just stay here. There’s nothing for you here, or even around you. Nobody lives here anymore, Steve, I told you that everyone moved into the main part of the city, and with good reason..”, he explained.
“Captain..? Can you hear me?”, Tony asked him, keeping his voice loud enough but not menacing, sounding calm and making sure that the crew members weren’t doing anything to get Steve’s attention.
As he approached the door, he pressed his ear against it. Nothing, there was only silence. Taking a deep breath, he opened the door, rolling inside.
“Don’t try washing your hands from this blood, Captain. And I’ll be looking forward to our meeting soon enough.”
“Can I let go of you?”, he asked Steve, and with his approval, he moved back, feeling proud as he witnessed the veteran slowly walking towards the bed again without his help, his steps becoming more sure and stable.
Steve’s eyes narrowed slightly and he remained huddled over Tony protectively, glaring at the two men. “I know who you are...”
He thought back to those accidents that he had that always seemed to aim for his jaw, no matter what.
Tony couldn’t help but watch the man’s muscular build, the way his shoulder blades would move, the muscles tensing when he stood and walked. And the steam must surely be playing games with his eyes; the man in front of him, who had looked so like a child of Aphrodite before now looked instead like a brother to Adonis. His beauty was beyond this world, and Tony couldn’t help but stare, letting his own tunic slip as he moved closer.
Tony shrugged, even if Steve wouldn’t know, not knowing that he was actually there. He was sure that Steve understood what he was suggesting, and he tried to shake off the annoying thought that Steve would rather give himself to the suit than to him in reality.
“Where is Tony?!”, Steve asked the last man standing, grabbing his collar and holding him against the wall. “I don’t have time for games”, he made sure to add as he pressured the guard.
“People think that they understand, that they get how you feel locked alone with only the darkest thoughts with you, hoping that someone will take you out of your misery soon enough, but only getting the slight taste of pain before they pause, leaving you to suffer, then repeat. People suddenly rescue you and you don’t realise what is happening, you can’t tell reality apart from the nightmare that you’ve been leaving. They invite you to places, expect you to talk about it, or to be just fine, to get over all of it. That it doesn’t just go away, that you need to smile or whatever and feel better.”
As they made their way, Falcon, who stood by the temple gates, saw the white horses and chariot pass by, catching a glimpse of Tony and Steve as they passed by. He frowned, heading in to the temple to inform the goddess that he guarded.
The excitement was getting realer, and as soon as they turned on their flashlights, they could tell that yes, this was definitely the place to be.
The bearded man shook his finger at him. “This is StarkTower. One of the first, and the most reliable one too. Runs on absolutely 100% clean energy, this was a small project of mine.. One of my goals is for every household to run on clean, renewable energy, just like this Tower.. until the end of this year. Starting from New York, of course, them move along. Oh, the Tower.. Countless floors, hundreds of rooms and facilities.. should be good for you to settle down in there, catch up.. all that”
“I’ve lead these men here,” his friend replied calmly. “They were looking for you and the Athenian."
“How old are you anyway?” Tony asked as they walked, wanting to learn more about the man who had shown showed him more about what real culture meant. “Got a wife waiting for you back home?”
“You’re located on Earth 616. This isn't your universe, you somehow ended up dimension hopping. What was the last thing that you remember doing?”, Reed interfered.
He hesitated a moment before walking up to Tony awkwardly, and he leaned down just as hesitantly. He stopped halfway, still unsure, and then he seemed to make up his mind, kissing Tony’s cheek in return.
He didn't know why he was so sure of what he was saying, or why he was even still talking, he just… knew that he was right.
Tony smiled at him, but Steve’s last words surprised him. “What do you mean by that?” he said. “You saw me in your sleep? I hope it wasn’t a nasty game played upon us by Morpheus...”
Tony looked at him for a second, realising that they never introduced themselves formally before. “See you soon, Captain”, he nodded, taking the hand into his and shaking it.
Tony couldn’t help but give Steve easier access to his neck, hand reaching back to wind into the blonde’s hair, not wanting Steve to part his lips from his skin. Nobody else was allowed that close to him, but Steve didn’t have to do anything more to have permission. Tony knew that he wanted Steve there to stay focused, to understand what was going on in his head and heart, how this simple man could change his way of thinking. And he found himself drawn to him, the man he pushed against a wall, the man who the fates wanted him to murder.
“You should respect the dead,” he muttered, gathering his composure as he picked up the scrolls again.
“So if I were to come to Sparta, you would treat me as you did, not as you are now?” Steve asked, looking over at Tony and turning to face him.
A week later, they were sat in Tony’s small plane, eyes shut, waiting impatiently to reach Buenos Aires. From there, they had a rented vehicle to take them to the jungle just outside the city; according to Tony’s notes, their destination was there.
“Is that the guy that my Dad wouldn’t shut up about?”, he heard Tony saying in the distance, that only adding to his dislike of the man’s character.
“I want to see your face, but, I don’t want to hurt you," Tony muttered, torn between the choices he had in mind.
“When did I bully you, Athenian? Was explaining the difference in our ways an insult?” Tony asked him, shaking his head as he moved around, trying to see Steve’s face. “I was trying to show you that I’m different than them, but you don’t want to let me, do you? And what about your talk earlier? That the fates brought us together?”
“Don’t worry, we’ll get there…”, Tony comforted him, scratching the soft patch of fur under his jaw, pleased to see that Steve replied straight away, quickly waggling his huge tail.
Steve sighed a little and picked up a brush, dabbing it into the paint before using the back of a tablet to paint on, gently making marks. “It’s pretty simple. It just takes practice.”
“You heard the Captain, Stane. You’re not using him and you better get those money making schemes out of your head. We’re not breeding super soldiers, not now, not ever”, Tony concluded, properly facing Stane and standing side by side with Steve.
“Is caring impure as well?” Tony asked him. “People express their feelings through different actions, Steve. I showed my gratitude towards you with that kiss, for example.”
Tony felt his heart racing. All he knew was that Steve was pushing himself away, away from everything he had wished for. He actually cared for Steve, yes, he actually loved him, and he hadn't realised until it was asked out loud. And yet, he couldn’t bring himself to say it, especially when everyone seemed to disapprove.
“Insolent pest!”, Stane shouted as he managed to grab Steve’s leg and before the blonde could react, he grabbed him and held him tightly, squeezing his chest. The shield fell from his hands, landing on the ground with a loud thump, Steve having to fight for air as he felt his ribs cracking.
Her face was covered, but Tony was well aware of what she looked like beneath the mask, the question was how she was still alive and how the hell did she manage to follow them.
What was more scary and frightening for Tony though, was how Steve was able to leave the room when they were arguing, how he did that with such an ease, only to come back hours later, always ending up with Tony apologising to him. No, it didn’t feel right. Tony wouldn’t tell that to anyone else, but he hated how low he seemed to drop just to get Steve’s attention and affection back. He was addicted to that soft pat on the head or the short hug that Steve gave him when they made up, and he knew that it was wrong. Tony was strong enough to shove everyone else away from his life, but Steve remained there, no matter what. When Steve came back into the room, his eyes dark, still affected by their fights (that Tony seemed to start every god damn time), Tony seemed that he lost control of his own body and emotions, begging for forgiveness. But what if that fucked up their relationship? What if one day, Tony’s apologies would mean nothing to Steve, what if the Captain would be ready to move on, realise how he was hurting himself and Tony, and decide that keeping his distance would do them both good?
“Why are you even apologising?” Tony said with a soft smile, closing his eyes at the kiss. “That’s not difficult at all, I consider myself incredibly lucky. If you think about it, I have to be special to have you deal with me, right?”
“How typical of you to turn into an A class standard villain”, Tony commented, trying to get his hands free, but the handcuffs were indeed restricting.
Hank and T’Challa were in the Mansion’s lab, working to find a way to reverse “the bite”. He heard them talking about a curse, but of course they believed that whatever was going on with him was reversible and curable. Tony joined them from time to time but right now he was more focused on trying to help Steve speak properly again.
Why did he wake up that night though? He wasn’t sure, the nightmares were still vivid and the only thing he could think off was that he needed some water, some fresh air, anything but to stay in that dark room. His hand was instinctively placed over the centre of his chest, gasping for air; he thought that those panic attacks were mostly gone by now, but he was wrong, he was reminded of that every time that he would wake up in the middle of the night.
“It was a failure, in that I didn’t achieve what I had set out to,” Steve said, admiring some of the weaving and patterns that were on the cloths.
“Just a reminder, I’m not the one wearing a skin tight spangled outfit here, Captain”, Tony noted, leading to Steve leaving the room with a huff.
Tony could have stayed there forever, just watching the handsome man bathing. He looked so much more at peace, nothing like before, his golden locks at the side of his face. “Sometimes I think that you’re the son of Aphrodite instead,” he blurted out before he could stop himself.
“Signs of affection aren’t to be taken lightly, Athenian,” Tony explained calmly, “and I told you not to believe the words that are said about me. This is me trusting you right now, saying that I need your help.”
They spent the rest of their afternoon walking by the Seine, lost in the alleys and ending up facing the Notre Dame, which Steve absolutely adored and carried on talking about Victor Hugo’s novel, with Tony insisting that the Disney movie was much better and happier. The shape of croissants impressed Steve, and they had chocolate ice-cream as the walked down the street, holding hands, both of them enjoying the freedom and relaxation as much as they could.
Tony shrugged as they walked through a number of automatic doors, nearly bumping into Steve when he stopped walking. “I need you to…stay calm. It will be shocking… trust me…”, he warned him, eyeing the smaller man and handing him a jacket. “The temperature is really low in there, so you might as well as keep yourself warm…”
Tony’s eyes lit up when he heard Steve’s voice once more and he nodded, trying to hide his excitement as he
But the moment was gone and he would never find out what could potentially happen next, as Janet barged into the gym, calling them out for yet another seemingly routine mission. Nobody could really predict that they would split in teams of two and end up captured by what could be considered Iron Man’s greater nuinance of a villain; an encounter with him almost always ended with Tony having to use a different suit of armour for the next outing. He considered himself lucky that he ended up facing him alone, to avoid a brief walk of shame while he covered himself up, coming out of the suit that could cause him third degree burns if he didn’t get rid of it.
Steve reached over and took some of the bread, along with the meat, taking a bite into it and nodding. “This isn’t bad at all Spartan,” he said, tilting his head in delight.
Steve grabbed Tony roughly and switched places, pinning him up against the wall instead. “I am no coward,” he snarled through gritted teeth.
“Answer my question,” Steve said, looking at him with a serious expression, eyes softer than before, feeling his heart suddenly skip with fear as he asked it. “Would you treat me as you did before if I were to? Hypothetically. Would you bully me in front of your people?”
“I thought you may understand me, that you needed me, and that your pleas for help were genuine. But no Spartan would ever need or want an Athenian” Steve said, walking over to the door and reaching for the handle.
“Do not compare me to your people,” Steve growled, digging the heels of his palms into Tony’s shoulders.
The silence fell again as the elevator stopped, making a small ringing sound, both of the stepping outside. Steve didn’t blink but he was impressed by the warm interior. He should have seen it coming, if the other man was anything like his father, always about style and wanting to show off. Which he did so far, the fancy tent of his back in the snow, with large chairs and desks, even the clothes with his name embroidered on it should have prepared him for this sight.
”, the British, elegant voice asked him, and Steve turned around to see if anyone walked into the room.
Tony watched him carefully, his heart feeling heavy when he noticed the distress in Steve’s voice, and let go of his hand, pulling him close to a tight hug instead.
The next morning, none of them seemed to recall another nightmare attack. Steve confirmed it, and so he did the next night. He could get used to this, sleeping next to Tony, drifting away peacefully, the reactor’s light keeping the dark away from them.
“I’ll show you then. Take it as me being a personal guide, I’ll fill you in and show you more practically what changed. And help you adjust to this new life”, Tony rushed to reply, voicing his desire to actually help.
His suit black to fit in with the dark lab, he landed close to her, who was still scouting out the place, coming up with a plan of attack.
Tony bit on his lower lip and huffed as he could feel Steve's discomfort, rubbing Steve's hips to soothe him, leaning forward as he pushed himself deeper inside. “Talk to me. I’m right here let me hear you," he said softly, wanting to reassure him, wanting to know that Steve felt better as time passed. He couldn't imagine how hard it must be for Steve.
“Well one day we will both stand by our parents on that mountain,” Steve said, taking him to a small armoury where they kept his and the other soldiers’ armour, walking inside to be acquainted with his shield,  “once our duties here are done, and when the people no longer need us here.”
“You reacted like a normal human being, Steve, stop beating yourself around for it. I know that you’re a super soldier and all, but before you give me a lecture about how you’re supposed to remain a soldier at all times, soldier on and all that… I'm asking you to stop and just think as a normal human being for once. Yes, you can afford to do that. You failed before, yes, but holding on those memories will get you nowhere. You need to accept that Tony gave his life for something bigger if you’re going to lead us against Kang.”
The page that Steve was looking at was a rough sketch of a gauntlet, with a really rushed handwriting detailing the different orbs that seemed to be attached to it.
“Let me show you”, Tony said as he moved closer and helped Steve position his fingers correctly. “You keep that side stable.. there you go.. and you use the other one to do the grabbing. Here, try that piece”, he said, pointing at the piece next to the salmon that Tony just ate it.
Tony looked right back to him, not sure what to do, or which of them should act first. “Do you want me to..?” he asked softly, giving Steve's arm a light squeeze
“I have a plan. Attack”, the billionaire replied coldly, jumping off the jet and flying towards the direction of the thunder.
“Oh, yeah! We want to offer you a new place. I understand that you’ll be staying in that veteran hospital that you were picked up, right? The new apartment is..part of your re initiation progress. New beginnings and all that jazz. Before you ask, yes, it’s still in Brooklyn. And a very nice modern place too, equipped with the latest tech. The bed is so comfortable, you have no idea...”
When Tony opened his eyes, he noticed that all the windows were open. Huge pet peeve, he hated to wake up when the sun was bright outside; it made him feel like he wasted all his day doing nothing while- his eyes widened even further. He was back. Yes, that was his own bedroom, his own paintings on the walls, his own expensive, linen bed sheets, his own Steve sitting on the chair opposite him flicking through a sketchbook. His Steve…?
Some privacy would have been greatly appreciated, the day was emotional and so important to him, he just wanted to spend some time doing the simplest tasks with the use of his legs again. The unwanted attention wasn’t a thing he appreciated either, and he was relieved to see Happy coming through and clearing the way towards the exit of the building for him. He didn’t realise that Tony was following them until he slipped inside the car and the billionaire was sitting next to him.
His boxers were being slipped off, revealing his protruding hip bones and even more, letting out a quick gasp as he felt the cold metal fingers touch his body. The movements seemed so real, and each moment he kept his eyes shut he imagined Tony doing this. He never had the strength to be the one on the bottom but he was curious, he was just scared of being judged, but this was a suit so he could do anything, it wasn’t real.
“Aaa-aroo!,” Steve howled, his ears lowering in disappointment with himself, trying so hard to follow Tony’s instructions.
“Thought that I would do what?” Tony asked. “Kill, drink and sleep with women every single night? It didn’t sit with me well, nor did I want it to.”
Tony nodded to him, pleased by Steve's words. “You can come to the baths with me and then I’ll show you where you can rest, what do you think?” he offered.
Steve smiled at him, placing a soft, gentle kiss on his lips, before pulling away, looking at him with so much adoration gleaming from his bright blue eyes.
“Why should I trust you? How am I supposed to know that you’re who you claim to be? You could be HYDRA agents in disguise, who knows?”, the Captain asked as he strained his back.
Loving him wasn’t easy,no. It felt so hard, so difficult, yet there he was, constantly after him, despite how it hurt sometimes. Tony Stark was a needy man who required full attention, and even if he didn’t bluntly ask for it, he expected the other man to give it to him, his full attention and affection.
“I’m not comparing, at least not now,” Tony said. “Your words are full of venom, Athenian. You think my interested is feigned, but you know nothing about me, you let me show you nothing at all. You consider this battle a lost one before it’s even started.”
Steve walked a couple more steps, able to resist the urge to look over his shoulder to see Tony for only so long. When he did, he saw that Tony still stood staring after him, looking so lost. It had been strange before to see him as a man of power, in his prime. And then suddenly there he stood, alone and meek.
Shutting his eyes, he leaned back on the comfortable pillows, who felt like bricks to him at that moment. What if bringing Steve back to life was a bad call in first place? What if he would cause him more emotional trauma and scar him even more by bringing him into a world when he wasn’t any more appreciated and the old fashioned values he probably treasured meant nothing to the people? He had to eventually show Steve around, but he was dreading for his reaction, especially after he saw the way he was looking at the buildings, the city, everything. The next day would probably be eventful and overwhelming for Steve, and the least he could hope was that the man got to rest.
Finding him alive in the ice was something he could never imagine of happening, but there he was, in flesh and bone, talking to him, walking in him when he was just coming out of a shower, his chest exposed. Tony wasn’t exactly the type of guy that would open up to people, but his secretive tendencies became even worse after he returned from Vietnam. Even his friends couldn’t take more words out of him, and the one man who knew exactly what happened died before they could both get released. Turned out he needed a bodyguard in first place, before he was kidnapped and forced to make weapons for the sole purpose of pure destruction, something that their world couldn’t afford anymore. It had barely been a year, but Tony would still clutch on his chest and stay awake at night, thinking of the sharp pain he felt when the explosion hit him miles away, waking up to find that metallic creation built on his chest and being told that the only way to survive was to keep it on for the rest of his life.
“Perhaps, if you’re lucky,” Steve said, taking Tony out and sitting outside on top of the large hill.
“I’m not doing a favour to anyone, and I don’t want you to repay me either,” Tony answered. “No, I do enjoy what we do and I don’t want it to end, but the question here is, do you want this to carry on? Do you like it as much as I do? I want this to continue because it is wanted, not as part of our deal.”
Steve was at the front, clearing a path and listening to Tony’s directions. He was so sure that they got lost, he could have sworn they were going around in circles at that point, but the argument stopped once he lost his balance, disappearing into what it seemed to be a really well hidden cave opening.
Tilting his head, he pulled it out, wiping the dust from the top of it and taking out a large film reel. “Oh.. I forgot they gave me those.. the pictures..”, he recalled.
Tony sighed happily as his own hands roamed Steve’s chest, moving over it while his tongue carried on, licking every possible part of Steve’s skin he could find to taste his skin, the smell of oil and old parchment from Steve's scrolls filling his senses, as well as the sweet smell of Steve himself.
“Was that supposed to be a joke? It feels weird coming from you..”, Tony muttered. “Very well, but don’t hesitate to reach for me, got it? My door is always open, even if you don’t.. want to take the offer”, he said, not really willing to go away, especially when he spent so much time being inseparable with Steve. He walked close to the door, opening it hesitatingly. “Be careful.. okay?”
He felt it coming, him and Steve were leaning closer to each other, his heart was pounding, and he could tell that Steve has the same thing in mind.
Steve had to draw in a deep breath, exhaling smoothly to calm himself as his body trembled mildly. He wanted to appear as calm as he could though his mind was plagued with anxiousness, and Tony’s touch to his front made the heat rise to his cheeks. As he attempted to become accustomed to it, he focused more on the kisses as he gazed through his long eyelashes at Tony, and his every movement.
“You were right, you know,” Tony replied with a shake of his head. “This is a lost battle; I should stop hoping that there’s any saving me or my people. Nothing changed for so long; I doubt anything will do now. We’re sticking with our ways, and you with yours, and we will fight, just like it’s bound to happen.” He moved back, away from Steve.
“You can’t control love, though. Eros has his arrows, and trust me, that little guy knows exactly what he’s doing. What if your time comes? Will you just... let it go?” he asked with pure interest. He hadn't me that one person himself just yet, even though he was always being pressured to do so.
At his comment, the scientists and employees that were staring turned away, focusing on their screens, but Steve knew that they were doing anything in their power to catch a glimpse of him.
“Because you are different,” Tony tried to explain, shaking his head. “I don’t know what it is about you, but you are nothing like any other person I’ve met. You can... tame me if you put it that way. You take out the human in me, not the son of Ares, it’s just... well so far I was being just Tony.”
“They do,” he agreed solemnly, and Tony noticed how Steve remained silent; surely his words must have caused some sort of reaction, even one that he wasn’t aware of just yet?
Steve bristled and walked away but Tony didn't stop, following him to stand in front of him, blocking the doorway. “You show up and promise something, then at the first fight you decide to leave. You got me interested in your teachings and you just want to take that away and leave yet again. What do you want from me?”
Steve’s eyebrow twitched; he was trying to act calm but Reed was right; this Tony wasn't cooperating or understood how dangerous and important the situation that he found himself into was.
“Why wouldn’t I?” Tony nodded, pleased with Steve’s happy reaction.  “You’ve showed me so much; I should be able to do the same."
“I will blame Loki for what happened, it seemed like everyone lost their calm. I was carried away as well; of course you were someone special even before the serum. Yes, unlike you, I did read all the reports. I’m not scolding you, Steve, don’t worry”, Tony added quickly, watching as Steve opened his mouth. “You’re a great man, Steve Rogers, it was an honour to meet you”
Before realising, the bearded man lifted Steve’s chin, their lips locking for a split moment. His heart was beating so fast, his eyes shut after being widened for a shocking moment, pouring himself into that chaste kiss, so soft and pure. It was nothing like a quick, sloppy, lustful kiss, no, Tony knew how to make this special, how to make his heart flutter. He could feel the heat rising up to his cheeks as they both pulled away, not really saying anything for a few moments.
Tony rubbed his head, startled by the blonde’s words. “What do you mean fall in love?” he asked with a growl. “I’m not, I didn’t feel any Cupid's arrows on me," he started to say. Maybe that was why he had starting to feel the sudden adoration for the Athenian.
They were mostly silent, the nerves were starting to kick in. What if this project failed? If everyone build his hopes up only to crush them hard and painfully? No, he trusted Tony Stark, after what he found about him it truly made him believe that he would do anything in his power to give humanity a better future.
“No worries”, Steve said as he sat down on the couch, curious to see what Tony was planning. “We can just take it- What are you doing, Tony?”, he asked again, blinking as Tony started to unbutton his shirt, eyes fixed straight away on the piece of machinery on the centre of his chest, lighting up the dark, gloomy room.
He nodded. “I see. I think I understand now. Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, pressing his lips briefly to Tony's, “for explaining that.”
“Mr. Stark will be away for a couple of hours, sir, this won’t take long. However, if you want this to last for a longer period of time, I am built to satisfy those needs of you”, he replied sternly.
“If you are implying that either of us knows who they are, you’re wrong,” Tony said. “You’re just like me, Steve. You’re lost; you don’t know what you really want or what your real purpose is. Brought down to Earth, but to do what? You are only suffering, I know, I’ve seen the way you look at others. I’m not trying to say that I know you, but I can feel what you are feeling too.”
Steve gave the man an inspecting look once again. All right, maybe just one glass was the polite thing to do, and in the end, he still needed to meet the rest of the townsfolk and earn his respect.
He would always stick to the old ways that he was taught, to the idea that women should be sheltered instead of roaming free and flaunting themselves. He kept his eyes down and took another sip of the wine, closing his eyes momentarily.
Steve smiled. “I’ve said this a million times before, but I love being in your company,” he said, “so much so that the Gods blessed me with visions of you in my rest last night.”
“Steve?”, Tony asked, as soon as Steve seemed to calm down. “I think it’s time to talk about this”, he said calmly, facing Steve.
“And you know nothing of Athenians yet you say we are weaker than you. Our knowledge, our ethics are what make us strong human beings, not pointless violence and killing. Not parading around killing the innocent, pillaging like savages until there is nothing but the bare bones of a city left,” he said, lowering his hand back to his side as he watched Tony flinch away from him.
Taking one last good look at his tensed back, Tony headed outside the room and walked back to his own bedroom, taking his tie off and sitting on the large bed. Steve Rogers, Captain America, his childhood hero was on the same floor, in his building, alive and seeking his help. Maybe the last part wasn’t true, maybe Tony was offering his help too willingly, as he couldn’t stand seeing him like that. In a way, he felt responsible, he was the one who found him in the ice, and had to guide him around, make him feel comfortable and make sure that the man wouldn’t act on impulse and do anything that would put him in grave danger. However, his plan to reveal the presence of the Captain to the world, lift everyone’s spirits, especially when they seem to need a hero more than anything; Tony sure knew that he did. There were things he never really told to anyone, about his childhood, the few memories that he held dear from it, or the ones that haunted him to that day. Steve of course didn’t know, but Captain America meant so much to Tony, he was the one who Tony counted on when the loud voice of his father would echo the hall coming towards his room, little Tony holding the super soldier’s action figure tightly in his hands. His little toy shield was one of his favorite toys amongst his knights, and with Jarvis’ help, he would turn himself into a knight, holding the star shield proudly on his hand as he was defeating his foes. Those were the memories he chose to treasure, and Steve was in a way, part of them. He couldn’t thank him for that, not so soon when the man had to go through a lot more in his head.
she used to ask him, rolling her eyes. Tony wouldn’t usually reply, he would pretend that he couldn’t listen to her, that seemed to send her off most of the time, leaving him alone in his workshop, taking his frustration out to Dummy. What Pepper didn’t know was that, Tony wasn’t good enough for anyone else. And especially not for the person he least expected himself to like.
“Give me 10 minutes and I’ll be dandy.” Steve huffed, contently nestling into Tony’s arms, hearing the soft hum of his reactor that he could quite easily fall asleep to.
“Why are you sorry?” Tony asked, meeting his gaze with a smile. “You let me in, Athenian. That’s more than I could ask for already.”
“Your words are as much of a threat to me as the rest of your weapons are which, it seems, are not a large threat at all,” Steve said, staggering back as he was punched and using the shield, crouching down and then upper-cutting Tony with it.
“I’m glad,” Tony nodded as he poked at the fire with a stick. “It takes a lot to undone certain things. And I wouldn’t want to risk our friendship.”
He coughed, his vision going blurry, but the he heard the gunshot and saw Steve jumping in, pushing her off him. It wasn’t a fatal shot, he got her shoulder, but it would definitely be a wound that would slow her down.
“Must have been hard for you”, Tony said after he cleared his throat, having noticed Steve’s silence.
“Leave him some space…”, Jessica whispered to her as he gently pulled her away from the blond who seemed so lost.
Steve sighed. “So my debt is repaid? And you will ensure my people are safe? I have taught you enough?” he asked.
“But it is worth it, really, to see such happy faces amongst the crowds?” Steve said softly, and Tony nodded in agreement.
“Mr. Stark would now show you what I can offer you”, he said as the front of the suit seemed to pull back, the area between the legs revealing a length, long creation, still bearing the bright red colour of the rest of the suit.
“Natasha, right?”, Steve recalled, scanning the room. The rest of the people were either watching tv, chatting or playing games of chess. Everyone was covered in some form of bandages, the place looked like a much neater and quieter battlefield hospital. The screams and blood that he saw when he was first recovered in the field were enough to wake him up from his sleep drenched in sweat and having difficulty in breathing. But there was nothing special about him, everyone in that room suffered from the same memories and were getting treatment from the hospital therapists. He spent hours with the therapist assigned to him, Jocasta, a woman in her forties who seemed to be more empathetic than her strict appearance made her to be.
“This isn’t my city to tell you what you can and cannot do,” Steve said, shifting the scrolls in his grip.
Steve continued with the soft sucking, his eyes shut so that he could focus on pleasuring Tony. But just as he did, there was a loud bang, and the doors swung open.
Steve turned at the elevator again and shook his head, still not sure what to believe. “I’ll have your word on that”, he simply said as he walked across the room. “Do you mind if I go back to my room..?”
He grabbed Tonya’s shoulders, looking down at him as he held onto them tightly, craning his neck down to stare into the sapphire abyss. “I cannot help you. I have tried, and I can’t,” he said bluntly, softly.
Tony rubbed his head, thinking about the question. “It might not be the same to others, but that’s how I express gratitude towards you,” he said.
Tony’s fingers trailed the ancient gauntlet, the gems on it shining so brightly, even with the heavy cover of dust on them. Just picking it up seemed like such a careless thing to do, yet he couldn’t stop himself from doing so. His grip tight on it, he finally picked up the gauntlet, not wearing it, expecting the ground to start collapsing and fire coming out of the walls; the usual stuff. None of that happened. Huh.
Tony’s eyes widened, his breath cut short. He was staring at an almost perfect copy of himself, eyes shut, skin at its palest. Looking around, he almost tripped on his way to the nearest bin, falling on his knees and throwing up with a series of loud noises.
“No, I won’t leave you alone,” Tony said as he knelt down and started to collect his things, turning his back to Steve. “Just let me dress up and we’ll find something for you”,
Finally his eyes moved over to the suit that was on the table, lying there like a doll that had been left by its owner. He stepped up to it with a pensive expression, his hand rubbing his chin and eyes still squinted in thought, wondering if this was the suit that Tony was talking about.
“Come on,” he said, “this will help. It’s going to relax you a lot.” He didn't really pay much attention to himself – it was nothing new to him, or any of his fellow citizens, to reveal his body when he wasn't alone.
He didn’t wait for Tony to say anything, instead he flew towards him, grabbing him from the shoulders while they headed towards the back rooms. Tony’s gun was fully charged again, blasting soldiers away and clearing the path. The heat from the back of Steve’s boots seemed to have burnt some other soldiers who tried to snatch him as he flew past them. Moments later, they had corned Zola in his lab, his back turned as he was talking to Tarleton, planning their escape.
Steve bit down hard on his lower lip, so hard that it turned white, and he looked over his shoulder to nod at Tony as he shifted on his knees in response to the pressure on his lower back. He wanted to signal that he was ready, but it was hard to keep his moans quiet as he felt Tony's fingers moving inside him, trying to fight the tightness of the muscle.
“So, what’s next?”, he asked Tony as he was unstrapping him from the metal bed that he was placed on, flexing his arms and getting on his wheelchair once again.
Steve stood proud and tall by the gates of his city, shield in his hand as he watched the vast army approaching, their battle cries sending shivers down the spines of his people. Steve encouraged them to stand strong with his powerful words that he was famed for, that resilience returning to him as he was pushed back into the army to fight with his people, to save and protect him, as it was the only thing that he knew and he was now bound to his duty, though trying to wrestle with his deep feelings for the Spartan, trying his hardest to put them behind him and keep on a stern face, his efforts to teach them had indeed proven pointless.
The child of another god. It made sense to him for them to stick together, and that kiss surprised even himself; he never really liked anyone else in that way before.
“Carry on with your insults Spartan, how very cliché of you.” Steve replied, elegantly flicking his wrist to gesture, almost welcoming him.
Tony couldn’t help but smile and place a soft kiss on the blonde’s cheek. “We don’t need this to make it happen”, he whispered gently, snapping a photo of the padlock with his phone. That particular side of Steve, the innocent, careless one, always amazed him, and he grew so fond of it, glad to be privileged enough to see it ever so often.
“Tony Stark is dead… We assembled again, the Council of Kang, we figured out how much this helps us, how it works perfectly for our next strike. You tried to get rid of me, so I'm returning the favour, starting with your leaders. Iron Man is gone, in every universe, we’re dealing with him, one by one. And as soon as we’re done with them… Tony Stark will be erased from existence… Do you want to know how that will affect each one of you? Think back, how did Tony Stark affect your life? That will be…gone!”, he snapped his fingers. “Just like that!”
“Did you consider that attempt failed?” Tony said as he followed Steve closely. “After all, you made me come up and talk to you here, it’s hardly a failure.”
“Come on now…”, Steve sighed, throwing the sheets over the body in front of them and leading Tony out of the morgue. Instinctively, he placed his arm around Tony’s shoulder to help him keep his balance and calm him down, even a tiny bit, even though he knew that there was no way he could just calm down a man who just saw himself dead.
“I, uh... I wanted to prove you that I didn’t want you to leave,” Tony said slowly. “I still don’t.”
“I want you to keep your calm… I’m still trying to figure out what happened here…”, Reed warned Steve as the blond walked closer to the table.
“Now, I saved the best for last”, Tony said proudly as he approached Steve. “Those legs look like proper boots for a reason. Look at where the sole is”
“Because they are nothing like your women, Athenian, or any other Greek women. They are proud, they wouldn’t allow anyone to uh, violate them without knowing what would come afterwards. And as you know, I’m not married yet.”
The rest of the Avengers launched forward for an attack; Thor swung his hammer, Carol flew towards, his fists already lit up, the Hulk ran towards Kang and jumped on him.
“Just relax, Captain Rogers”, he said, eyes fixed on the man’s body beneath him, the fingers moving close to his opening.
“You aren’t my friend Tony... I had hoped you were, but you’re not. You’re the son of Ares, I am the son of Athena, and we possess traits our parents have. Although I do not let blood dictate me, you on the other hand, seem to have that mentality. I cannot teach those who do not care, nor can I befriend them. You say you want to learn more but you already know I am no mathematician, I am no scientist either. I am a man of morals and justice, which you seem to have enough of here. I did not know at first, but now I am well educated in your ways.”
“You say that but I’m sure you’re flattering me,” Steve said, moving to rest his head in the grass, still staring up at the sky.
“A man cannot change in a matter of days after two encounters,” Steve muttered, brushing back his hair.
“Mr Stark thought that you wouldn’t appreciate his own personal extravagant taste, so he had this place prepared for you”
“I’ll be watching out for you then," Tony nodded as he stood up as well. “Ready to hit the road again?”
Steve took Tony everywhere he could, wanting to show him around, thoroughly enjoying Tony's company. While they were at the temple, Steve took the time to look up at the large statue of his mother, internally questioning why he should feel this way about someone if she had forbidden him to love.
“So you need a companion but don’t want to forget your duties?” Tony asked, moving a little closer. “And who said that you can’t do both?”
“Do you really think that there’s a place for me in this world, Tony?”, he asked the older man who sat by his side.
“I don’t believe you, Tony”, Obadiah shook his head as he pushed his way through the two men, only to be grabbed by Steve. “What the hell?!”
From time to time, he noticed Steve looking at him carefully, perhaps having second doubts about bringing him along. But something about the way Steve smiled seemed to ease his doubts. “You know, I can understand why you like living here,” Tony said after a while, walking next to Steve once again.
“Thank you, Athenian," Tony said with a smile, tilting his head to enjoy Steve’s lips against his neck. He wanted more of the sensation.
The next morning, Tony woke up a bit too close to Steve, quickly pulling away and hoping that his drooling wasn’t noticeable.
Reed walked outside the makeshift morgue, and Steve stopped holding his breath as soon as the door was shut behind them.
Tony slowed down his pace; breathing softly as he noticed Steve’s reaction, giving him small, quick kisses. “It’s all right,” he murmured, “I can do this.” He pulled away and focused on Steve’s mouth again, kissing him deeply and slowly. Would Steve want what he planned to do next?
“And all though I’m grateful for the toughness and discipline that I’ve learned, it’s a shame that I’m missing when it comes to reading, writing and art in general," Tony admitted, watching Steve's fingers. “I had some training but that wasn’t the primary focus.”
him, in all his glory. Tony just stared in awe, his gloved hand reaching and touching the thin ice that was separating them. How was it even possible? If he didn’t know any better, he could have sworn that the Captain was indeed just sleeping, just resting his eyes after sacrificing his everything to save their world.
After their first hesitant kiss and fight, Tony was almost sure that this was going to be a love-hate relationship. He didn’t hate the Captain, how could he hate America’s most loved hero? No, he hated so much he
Steve’s eyes widened slightly, looking over at Tony with a confused look. “You’re... Not in love with me?” he asked with a shocked expression. All this time he was led on to think that Tony was, and hearing his confession suddenly made his heart plummet.
A makeshift ladder was hanging there, and wasting no time, they started climbing, Steve at the front again. As soon as he got up, he turned around, only to see Tony attempting to climb with the Gauntlet on, slipping on the very last step, but Steve managed to catch him, dragging him up.
This time around, luck wasn’t working in his favour in the slightest - not only his suit was melting at an increasingly high speed, but he was also trapped in a room with nobody else but Captain America, all while he was trying to save both his dignity and secret identity.
Steve was getting more and more frustrated, being torn himself between his pride and being a good person. He thought he understood Tony, he wished he did, but every time he tried to something seemed to push him back and it hurt him. So why not raise his own walls to counter? When Steve was hurt he would raise his defence, hide behind his shield to protect him, in this instant his words were his shield.
“I respect her wishes, and have seen men crumble, even wage war over love. I would much rather... not,” Steve lied. Of course he wanted to fall in love; his heart was lonely and he hated just standing there and watching while others found their loves, found someone to spend the rest of their lives with. But no one could ever touch him, so he was sentenced to a life of solitude.
“You have the right to know… what really is going on here.”, Steve huffed. He was thinking about it for weeks; they were getting nowhere with Reed, and it seemed that the only logical solution was to fill Tony in and prepare him to fight by their side whenever Kang would invade again.
Days passed and Tony seemed to fully comprehend how everything worked around this strange new universe. He wore the Iron Man suit, he went out on patrol with Steve, he was confident that in case of an attack, he was capable of fighting efficiently. That and the fact that he was receiving lessons from the master of combat himself, Captain America.
“You haven’t done much to prove my people wrong,” Steve said, although Tony was clearly not enjoying his reputation. “However, I can see this other, lesser known side to you, a softer side. But doing what you are currently doing, to please your father, is the side of you that I have been warned about, the dark side of you. And it is the most common perception of you. It shows me that the demon still exists within you, and it tends rear its head to me more often than your more human side.”
“And I’m telling you Stane, I have no intention of- wait, what time is it there? Isn’t it like 2am? Go back to bed”, Tony sighed into his phone’s screen, the man on the other end shaking his head disapprovingly.
“He sacrificed himself to save the rest of you and prove you wrong?”, Tony asked; this sounded like something he would do, which made him shrug slightly.
Steve nodded to him and stood there for a moment before rushing outside, Tony’s question echoing in his head.
Tony took in all the sounds that Steve had made so far, encouraging him to keep going, wanting to take things slowly just to give Steve enough time to see if he really wanted all of this. And when Tony's hands finally reached his front, Tony stopped them to rest them just above it, continuing to reassure Steve with his soft kisses.
“Tony.. don’t make me look like the bad guy in front of someone that famous”, Stane said, shaking his finger in front of Tony’s nose.
“Can I try?” Tony asked as he watched Steve and the little shapes he created, taking in every detail and technique.
“To replicate the serum,of course. We have our super soldier right here, we can start right away. Imagine a new breed of super soldiers, all thanks to you two! Tony, this is your greatest discovery, this will go down in history because you made it possible”, he said, lifting his hands up in the air in excitement. “Think of it, all the other countries buying the serum to build up super soldiers.. from us. Talk about a comeback at the weapon market!”
“Jump in! You earned this!”, he smiled as he patted the seat next to him and took a slice of the extra cheesy pizza.
“Go ahead, Steve, I’m all ears”, Tony prompted him, letting his pastry at side and licking his lips.
Steve smiled even more as he felt Tony’s lips, raising his own head to kiss Tony in return. It was one of the most pleasant wakeup calls he had had in a very long time.
But Tony looked suddenly horrified. “Your life is not short; you’re a demigod,” he said, his tone serious. “And I’ll keep you safe. That’s what friends do, they protect each other.”
Tony’s smile widened - of course he remembered that time - doing as he was told, he watched the marshmallow get toasted, curious as to what Steve had in mind. His curiosity was catered to when Steve asked him to open up, spooning the marshmallow that was so gooey, feeding him a piece and creating a small breach that lead to the hot chocolate, its sweet smell coming out from it.
“I enjoy affection,” Steve said, leaning closer to Tony again to pressing their lips together once more, trying to categorize the feeling. It was more than just happiness, it was an emotion he couldn’t place and he pulled back only scant inches before leaning forward to do it again. They were still just gentle kisses, becoming briefer every time he pulled back. And Steve smiled after his final kiss. “I really enjoy this.”
Steve’s blush covered his face and he panted heavily, strands of his golden hair beginning to stick to his skin as his strong arms buckled, and he used his elbows to prop himself up instead, raising his lower body for Tony. The sound of their bodies against one another was exactly like in his dream, and he let out another round of moans, his mouth opening widely as the pleasure slowly started to kick in, encouraging his lower body movement even more.
That last moan really did it for him and with one last, deep thrust, he pulled his mouth away from Steve, letting out a loud cry along with Steve’s name as he climaxed inside him, dropping his forehead against Steve's back, panting heavily, cheeks all flushed.
Tony sighed heavily. He could see how Steve was judging him, disapproving of everything he said. “You know, I had thought you would understand. We are children of the Gods, Steve," he said, not realizing that he called him by his name. “We know first-hand what it feels like to have responsibilities, to have to live up to expectations. I might sound ridiculous now, but I...think that we could be friends.”
And the nightmares stopped after a while, but when Steve started to have them, Tony was worried. Steve was strong and could handle almost everything with ease, which sometimes made Tony forget that he wasn’t only supposed to deal with Captain America, his partner was above all Steve Rogers, even though he tried to lock that weaker and needy part of him away.
“I know. I know exactly how that feels. But look at me now, Tony. You’re changing the world for the better. I’m able to do all those things, all thanks to you. Trust me, when I was staying at that hospital.. I saw the despair in people’s eyes, I saw how they completely gave up on living. You’re offering them a chance to start again, to live the rest of their lives. You are just much of a hero as the people outside on the battlefield are.”
“I’m just being honest, isn’t that what people do?” Tony said, even though he shivered when he felt Steve’s touch on his shoulder, almost protesting when he pulled away. “We all appreciate some good honesty around here.”
“We’ll see about that..”, he replied, his communicator beeping and walking away from Tony to answer. “What do you mean he’s here?? I’ve told you to you guard all the exits and the entrance! I don’t care, just stop him!”
And there it was, his room, seeming untouched by the passing of time; it seemed that whoever broke into his apartment before didn’t bother looking there, which was a huge relief for Steve. In this very room, in the closet, he kept his most prized belongings, things that he loved, that he would miss more than a few bucks if they were to be stolen.
Tony respected Steve’s wish to stay quiet, and he focused on examining the man’s posture, watching the way he would breathe out when he was clearly in deep thought, how his eyebrows would furrow. He really liked him, in a strange way, and he didn’t even know him that well. Despite his arguments and their fights, he wanted to prove himself to Steve, to help, and most of all, he didn’t want to be the one to kill him, not if he could change that. He didn’t take fate for granted, and maybe they could change all this, together. And he didn’t want to be left alone once again; it felt so nice to be near someone who seemed to understand what he'd been through, what he'd endured for so long.
“Can you see this? This is because of you, Tony. You are giving those people hope, their lives back”, he said confidently.
Ever since their relationship took a whole different turn and they started spending their nights in Tony’s king size bed, Tony got accustomed to Steve’s nightmares. The first couple of times he pretended that he didn’t notice, and stayed awake until he made sure that Steve’s breath returned to normal. The Captain wasn’t exactly up for talking about the content of them, and Tony didn’t want to pressure him, especially after their first nights together, when Tony was the one that had a horrible nightmare. Steve woke him up, shaking his shoulders, and it was then when he realised that he was shaking, the trembling stopping as soon as Steve pulled him close. He didn’t have to explain, Steve knew that he dreamt about those months in that cave, years ago. After all, he had seen the footage, even if Tony didn’t want him to do so. He didn’t want Steve to treat him differently because of them, but he was pleased when Steve didn’t give him that treatment.
At the end of the other room, Steve was still facing the window, his forehead pressed against the cold glass to cool himself down.
“No!”, Tony shouted. He couldn't accept that, he was trying for so long to make things right, and just when he thought that he found a way to keep everyone happy, the incursions resumed, the truth was out at last. Steve knew about the mindwipe, about the genocide, about him betraying him, and he knew that the betrayal was what hurt him the most.
With his shield strapped on his back and wearing his uniform, he showed Reed that he was there for business; he wanted to get straight to the point and get out of there as soon as possible.
“Uh huh..can imagine that... Maybe next time you should take a detour, when do you get..off work? Some nights you gotta be free, how many of you are there...?”
The plan was to leave before dawn the next morning, and Steve was meant to do a routine check that evening and in the morning, in case they were followed. Tony chose to be very quiet about the identity of who could possibly come after them, but it didn’t make Steve’s job any easier.
“Really? But you decided to lecture me on how you don’t follow your mother’s will blindly," Tony reminded him, knowing well what Athena represented. He just couldn’t imagine that the man was so pure, despite his age.
The breach of cold into his warm body made his mouth hang open almost instantly. It was difficult to relax with the long extension being pushed into him, he could feel every single bend, every twitch it made. He wanted to call something out, but he didn’t know what, so he continued with the pants, trying to relax his body just as he would tell Tony to.
“You have a lot of homework, Tony”, Pepper sighed, leaving him alone, still looking at the different videos. That was a surprise. He personally knew about Bruce Banner’s situation, but Captain America being alive, and this godly looking fellow named Thor, SHIELD claiming that he was from a different realm, was  difficult to comprehend.
Once he was done, he walked over to the grave sites, where headstones and memorial structures commemorated the fallen soldiers. Though they weren’t men of his city, he still mourned for the loss of lives, sitting down on a large stone overlooking them.
That wasn’t Tony’s intention, he funded the program and was so personally involved in it so he could help people, so those new prosthetics could open the way for more affordable and efficient cybernetic technology. He wanted to make it broader, help individuals who were missing limbs due to legit accidents or were born with those casualties. Suddenly he felt sick to his stomach, disgusted by his own actions, not wanting to do anything with this ever again. No, he had to inform Steve, face Zola and Tarleton, demand some answers and make them face the consequences. He couldn’t believe that something like this was happening right before his eyes and he had no idea. Still in shock, he ran outside the bedroom, bumping into a muscled chest and looking up to Steve who was looking at him curiously.
“Welcome to Stark Industries”, Tony announced. “This is the reception..more like a waiting room”, he explained. “The door over there? That’s my private office”, he added, but Steve seemed more concerned by the paintings on the wall, tilting his head, trying to make any sense of the weird shapes. “That’s modern art.. Pepper picked it, I don’t know what is supposed to be..”
Steve's eyes slowly fluttered open as he watched Tony hovering by his hips, chest heaving enough to make his lips turn dry. “W-what’s next..?” he asked faintly.
He trained as a warrior, standing side by side with the generals as they prepared themselves for the impending war. Tony had promised to keep Athens safe, and yet days after his return, Sparta had made it clear that they would attack Athens - with or without Tony.
Steve moved along with Tony, his body easily swayed despite its large build, and he wrapped his arms firmly around the dark haired man, pulling back only to break the kiss and stare into Tony’s eyes with heavy breaths escaping lips swollen from the kiss.
Tony blinked a couple of times when Steve held him, always considering embraces as a way to show genuine appreciation. And he did the same in return, his hands firmly around Steve’s back. “I can try and show you what I know, but you’ll have to help me as well.”
“A villain? I think that you misunderstood me here.. I’m simply doing business.. I asked you to pass the Captain to undergo some little experiments.. but you kept him away for yourself like the spoilt brat you are. So I figured out how to get him back! Dogs are loyal to their owners, right? He’ll come running to you any moment now”, Stane laughed as he approached Tony.
When he was finally released, he made his way back to Deadwood, trying to recover like nothing happened. Instead, he demanded the release of the local sheriff and is immediate replacement, something that was dealt with right away. Needless to say, he took measures the ensure that repetition of the incident in future would be prevented, and hired a buffed man who went by the name Thor to always be around in the saloon, providing him with a place to stay and drinks. Just providing a service along with drinks was enough for the new muscle of the saloon and kept him content, so Tony focused on getting back his clientele instead.
“More comfortable here than on your bed?” Steve asked, quirking one eyebrow as he took another grape. “From your reputation, it seems you do spend a lot of time in that bed of yours.”
Tony was almost out of breath, not even sure why. The Athenian felt so good when they were close, almost like he belonged there. Yes, he'd had other persons approach him, but this felt so much stronger. It was different.
“I am serious, I am working if you didn’t notice. I’m trying to see what Fury is hiding from us, and I’m pretty sure I’m going to find out something big. Some things just don’t seem fine to me, Rogers. Stop thinking like a soldier for now and be more suspicious”, Tony replied, looking at him while stuffing his mouth with a handful of blueberries.
“I would like to keep it, if I can." Tony said, noticing how Steve was still looking at his work without bothering to move away.
When the rest of the crew came running, he got one of the thermal detectors, throwing it away after a couple of scans. What was he even doing? Of course the hero’s temperature wouldn’t have been preserved after so many years dead in the ice.
They were outnumbered, there was no question about that, and even if Steve was the best shot, there was still no way they could come out of there without getting shot.
Tony heard his words, the rest leaving little to the imagination, understanding why Steve seemed to be so shy. After all, if Steve hadn’t brought up the duty to his people and mother, maybe his dream could have become true when they were together back in Sparta. “And did you like what you see?” Tony asked him in a softer voice, approaching him even more, warm breath against Steve's skin.
He didn’t have a chance to apologise, or better, he didn’t find an appropriate moment to bring this up. Much to his surprise, Tony didn’t seem to hold a grudge against him, but he really seemed like he expected something.
Steve nodded, moving close to the other bag and getting himself ready, before delivering another kick. This time, only a bit of sand came out, but the bag was still in place.
“No! I don’t care what happened to the Tony here, but I'm not going to sit down and accept to be treated like this!”
“I’m don't mean any disrespect," Tony quickly excused himself, kneeling to help; lifting some of the scrolls and handing them back to Steve. “I heard others talking about you being here."
“I’m unsure; my mother has wings on her helmet too,” Steve said. “I suppose it represents swiftness, freedom, elegance - the last of which I quite obviously do not possess.”
Tony that we…knew. He came through a portal, he must belong in a different dimension, but I don’t know why he appeared here from all places.”, Reed explained, shiftily looking behind him, at another door.
“I understand nobody deserves to be alone or have what they most care about taken from them,” Tony said. “And I make a promise on this day, Athenian. I, Son of Ares, will do everything in my power to save your people and stop this madness from happening.”
“Pizza? Pizza it is”, Tony suggested, not really waiting for Steve’s reply as they stepped inside his penthouse.
His eyes shined, the light coming from the flashlight emphasising how bright and excited he was to find that gauntlet.
“Even if that’s exciting, no,” Tony said. “Believe it or not, I find more fascinating the fact that you stood up to me, you really were different from others that came before.”
Steve had little recollection of the past couple of weeks; he remembered doing press interviews, photo shoots, meeting with veterans, kids, anyone willing to learn more about Captain America and listen to his inspirational speeches. Tony has been his side throughout everything, and even when Steve was able to move in his own place, Tony insisted that he stayed in the Tower with him. For a strange reason, Steve didn’t reject his offer, and before he knew it, things started to get better.
“Was that you making a joke, Sheriff?” Tony asked as he leaned against the door, putting on his hat.
“Steve..? What are you doing here?”, the millionaire’s surprised voice was heard, causing Steve to open his eyes and look away quickly as the other man was holding a towel around his waist, his chest still exposed, the steam still clearing up.
“Athenian, having a heart is always a disadvantage,” he replied as he shook his head. “You can’t stop war, if that’s what you’re trying to do. Humans will keep on fighting. Look at our parents; they are gods but they still argue and swear revenge upon each other. You can’t stop this. But you need to come out on top every time, don't you? To be stronger than the person next you. You think strength is what that matters, do you think that we just enjoy pointless brawls? We fight to survive, as you should.”
Stane looked at them, and it was clear that he was holding back insults to spit out to them, especially at Steve. It was so clear that he hated the man’s guts, and hated Tony for allowing that kind of behaviour. Without a word, he straightened his suit and headed towards the elevator. Just when it seemed that he was going to leave without a come back, he turned at them smirking as the doors closed.
They walked inside the glass elevator that was on top of the rooftop, Tony casually leaning against the handles and watching the city before them. Once he would just admire the view, but now, with the decaying buildings and the heavy smoke, it was rather painful to watch. It seemed that Steve thought the same, because he avoided looking, focusing instead on the light panel with all the number of the floors.
After of what seemed like a century, being thrown outside his own window of his own tower by the power-driven god, back in his armour, Tony was in constant communication with the rest of the team, co-ordination their moves. They fought for so long, dropping down to meet each other and plan their moves, and Tony didn’t doubt Steve’s orders at any time. He might have argued with Steve Rogers, but right now this was Captain America, and they had to protect the world, certainly no time to argue and bicker. The team seemed to work well together, and much in everyone’s surprise, Captain America and Iron Man had a strong teamwork. At random times, Iron Man would land on, blast a couple of enemies, then turn his palms at Steve, the shield reflecting his beams, taking out more enemies.
“I have learned all I need to, Spartan; that your bite is fierce and your appetite supersedes that of the Cerberus,” Steve said with a nod, quickly stepping out and grabbing his spear from one of the guards, heading out toward the gates again.
“…We have received more information from Stark’s close friend Colonel James Rhodes, claiming that Obadiah Stane, partner and investor of Stark Industries is involved to the incident, but he’s not yet located to make any comments”
“We’re done.”, he simply replied to him; he was lost, he truly felt so confused, so angry, so disappointed. Tony should have meant nothing to him, especially after this. He was truly done.
Tony was in the main chambers, sitting on the main throne with his spear and shield at hand, legs spread as he was waiting for the new arrival, smiling smugly when the guards approached. He didn't bother to stand up and greet him, only raising an eyebrow as Steve referred to him by his title, even though Steve didn’t really show any signs of respect. Only pride.
Tony sat back and watched him, the way his eyebrows would furrow in concentration, watching the image taking shape as time passed until he realised what Steve was doing. “Is that..?” he asked to be sure.
The constant reminder of his own and his father’s failure to save the whole of their home lead Tony to search for more ways to develop all kinds of new technology and find new means of energy that they could use efficiently, before the current sources ran out. Nuclear energy and  hydropower were what he focused on, and small expeditions were carried out by men of his company, trying to use the best of their resources and give the people what they were after. Much to his subordinates’ annoyance, Tony often wanted to be involved in everything, including putting on a less fancier parka and walk through the snow far outside New York, his comfort zone, looking over the operations. What he didn’t know, was that, not too far away into the future, those trips of his own would lead him to something much greater.
The other man didn’t crack a smile; instead he turned around, looking at the various bottles across the bar.
What Steve saw made his heart stop. Two metallic legs connected his knees and the newly attached limbs. They weren’t too thin, but not too thick either, they seemed sturdy, looking like boots instead of the robotic looking legs with toe fingers that he imagined. Boots.. like jet boots. He reached out, his fingers coming in contact with the cold metal, sending a shiver down his spine. His hand was shaking, and he immediately felt a warm grip on his shoulder, Tony was there comforting him. He didn’t know what to say, to see his lower body not...missing was too much for him to comprehend.
His eyes fell on a Captain America toy figure which looked worn out, the star on his costumed doll self fainting away. He figured out that this was indeed a personal collection, and wondered how much Tony probably had to pay to afford all those things; Steve knew that they were the real deal, but he also knew that more shields existed, for an instance, and that the billionaire probably offered a lot to have his own little corner in this room dedicated to America’s hero. Inspecting the figure, he lifted the delicate shield that it had on its back, seeing something written there. Squinting, he tried to read up on the rather messy, childish handwriting, and for a reason he couldn’t explain, it did made him smile.
“Look at that boy, Tony, he can barely stand straight, trust me, I’m doing him a favour”, Steve said with a huff as they walked inside the enormous glass elevator. “Besides, I needed to stretch my arms”
“We’re just Steve and Tony now, no gods are behind our words, we’ll act on our own," Tony replied firmly. “And I don’t care if she did; I’m not abandoning you, here or anywhere.”
“Oh, I acknowledge you, Son of Ares. I acknowledge your wrath and your enjoyment for striking fear into those who oppose you. You have done nothing but prove me wrong and prove my people right,” he replied, looking over at Tony with a glare. “What else do you want from me? Now, if you'll forgive me, I do not enjoy talking to mules, I will take my leave.”
The walls were full with drawings that seemed to have been there for centuries, the most common theme among them being a large figure with what seemed to be a crown on its head.
Tony’s suits always knew best with their advanced calculations and whatnot. Steve began to think that Tony probably had an under suit planned for him, which of course would involve him taking off his clothes for a start. He looked around the room, gazing from side to side to ensure no one was there and that the door was tightly shut before letting out a huff and reaching for the bottom of his t-shirt and slowly lifting it up, placing it so it was draping over the top of Tony’s chair.
As he grew older, he looked after his people, gifted with tactical knowledge and a sense of justice that earned respect from them. As a proud asset, he was provided with the gift of youth, from the goddess Hebe, sibling to Ares. Hebe had given this drop of youth to Athena to ask for forgiveness for Ares’ actions though, once Ares had discovered this, he was furious, and felt betrayed by his own sibling. They resolved their own dispute in time amongst themselves. However, now that Athena had this gift, she bestowed it upon her son and though he aged in mind, his body would never deteriorate or age and thus he would forever appear youthful, as though he were in his twenties. He was also gifted a violet coloured tunic, to signify his demigod status amongst his people.
The Captain nodded quite vaguely, pulling up the zipper of the coat completely and waiting for Tony to lead the way. He still felt lost, and the fact that he had no idea what to do made him really passive, almost like he was not caring about anything, which was probably the case by now.
“No no, not at all, I’m just fascinated,” Steve said, watching the fire light up Tony’s eyes, stretching his legs out as he lay there.
“Are you sure about that? Is that how your mother Athena taught you? Meddling with the son of her hated brother?” Tony asked as he started circling him once again.
Steve held Tony’s arm lightly, looking at him in the moonlight that shimmered through the window and outlined his features even in the darkness. “It was worth it, just to spend more time with you.”
“You had taken a sip from it, right? You had some of the water in the fountain of youth, I know the story. You’re the one... the ageless warrior,” he said with a small nod, tapping on the medallion around his neck. “You know, I can’t die either.”
Steve looked up at Tony, confused as to why he'd moved, searching his face curiously as he nodded once more.
Tony’s fists clenched, Steve had to fight back, he knew he would, he was the Captain after all, there was nothing he couldn’t do, but then it came to him. All those years looking up to the Captain he was just preparing himself for that moment, where he would save his hero, help him defeat the big guy, just like in the comics he read so many times before. Without any hesitation, he ran outside, and before Stane realised, Tony picked up the shield, which was way lighter then he thought it would be, hitting the man as hard as he could on his foot.
“Wait, when did he do all this?”, Steve gasped; he found it impossible for all this to have been prepared for him in the space of just a few hours.
The invasion of his privacy didn’t go unnoticed; it irked Steve, but he should have known that every information on him was out there for everyone to see, which was how he was found in the first place. So much for a private, quiet life.
He didn't know if Steve wanted him to stay or not but he saw the moment Steve realized he was still there.
Tony looked at him for a couple of moments, thinking about his answer. He wanted Steve there, more than anything. He wanted to be Steve's friend, but he wanted to keep doing what they had done together, to feel Steve's lips against his own, Steve's arms around his chest. “Yes we can," he nodded. Who knew? Maybe they could be like this and share their bond, and Tony would be all right. “I want us to be like this”
Tony let out a heavy breath as he tried to picture what Steve was describing. “And what will happen to you? And to me? And our people?” he asked quickly, staying in place.
“Don’t worry, it happens a lot with the new guys.. you did well for your first try, you picked it up”, Tony reassured him, rubbing his hand where Steve accidentally touched him. He felt it again, that strange feeling when he first held Steve’s hand, and a part of him wanted to do it again, but there was no way of doing it if he wanted to stay subtle.
When he looked down, he spotted them, those bright, piercing eyes, looking up to him. He froze in place, staring back down, too intimidated to even swallow down.
“I thought I should fix that”, Tony chuckled, walking into the living room and settling down on the large sofa. “Have you ever tried japanese food, Steve?”, he asked him, bringing up a restaurant’s menu up on the holo screen.
Steve felt the touch to his rear and scooted back a little, turning properly to look at the suit, “What are you doing?” He asked in his normal cautious manner.
“I see how it is," Tony nodded as he led Steve, walking through the city and out of the large, city gates, following the path that he knew that was going to take them to Athens. “So, you came here on foot before?”
“So… how did this happen…?”, he asked as soon as Steve helped him sit down again, facing away from those ominous doors.
“Recognised, Rogers, Steven”, the message read on the side screen, the door opening with a soft noise. Tony must have altered his security systems, just like he said, and in under different circumstances, Steve would be curious to find out more about this new technology and how it worked, but now his priorities were laying elsewhere.
nobody else that could pleasure him and see him in such a state. With a deep breath, he let the helmet pull back, revealing his face as he kept his eyes on Steve, feeling his warm breath against his skin at last.
“And who might you be, mortal?" Tony asked, unmoving, carefully inspecting the man’s strange appearance.
Steve nodded, swallowing down. Without thinking about it, he tried to convince himself to move his legs, having taught himself to forget about the use of legs for those past few months. He held his breath as his right leg moved on the side of the bed, letting out a gasp and looking at Tony straight away.
Tony smiled. “I’m really on good terms with that, if that means that I’m getting you as well," he nodded, placing a kiss on Steve’s jaw before pulling back to look at him.
Steve tucked himself around Tony, kissing him gently in return before he rested his face by the man’s neck, his hand still circling the other man’s torso, fingertips moving along his dark haired chest and down to his medallion.
It seemed to be raining every single day. The sunshine that they sold everyone who moved into the suburbs of New York was an absolute lie yet so many people were buying it. There wasn’t much for him to do anymore, he hated going outside, yet his stay in the veteran hospital was an absolute nightmare. Others were glad to be there, among their fellow soldiers, who seemed to understand what they were feeling and going through at all times but this...this wasn’t for him. He wanted to be out there again, into the action, serving his country.
Tony looked at him and sat up before moving closer to him, wrapping an arm around Steve to bring him close. “Here, is this any better?” he said as he rubbed Steve's shoulder.
“All right.. If I’m being perfectly honest here.. I’ve felt like this for a while”, Tony started, taking a deep breath. “It was mostly confusing, I mean, I didn’t know if I exactly felt the same way about you the way I felt about certain ladies, you know? And every time I thought that I was about to settle down.. something came up, always. After Rumiko, after the war, I thought that it was.. gone, that I couldn’t actually speak up or feel this way about you”
Tony watched how sleepy the man was, smiling at him even though Steve's eyes were shut, gently stroking his hand over Steve's skin, enjoying his company and the warmth of another human being next to him for once. “You know, I really like you," he said as he closed his own eyes, not sure if he wished for Steve to listen to him.
“Pull that lever, Cap!”, Tony yelled at some point, only to have himself beaten, relieved when Steve finally managed to listen to him, and Tony rushed to his side, blasting off the remaining threat. “What took you solong?”, he panted, taking off his helmet for fresh air.
Better now than never, wasn’t that a saying? Or was it something else and he got it all mixed up, unable to think clearly when it felt like his head was on fire, like the helmet was pressing against his temples, acting like a wicked hot prison of sorts. With some struggle, he managed to free himself, and as soon as he took a deep breath of fresh air, the heat rays just stopped. No, it was too late to go back now, and he probably looked like a mess, not like the usual Tony Stark that Steve knew, mullet and beard well kept.
However, Steve was greeted by a billionaire, someone who funded the Avengers and had the invincible Iron Man as his bodyguard. The kindness and warmth of this so called desk jockey surprised him, and he was pleasantly surprised to find out that he did pack a punch when he asked for training lessons from Captain America himself.
Steve shut his eyes and brushed his nose against Tony’s cheek. “I’m not supposed to do anything that could hurt my heart, but friendship isn’t supposed to hurt me,” he said. “But it has.  I’ve lost my friends. What I’m trying to say is that, I want you as my friend, Tony.”
The next morning, he sat up, looking for the chair, but as he removed the sheets, he smiled to himself.
“Can you believe this? How do they work so well? I swear, they are so strong, I tried to grab a jar this morning and it just broke in my hands...”
Steve stared at Tony, looking deeply into his eyes and hearing hope in his pleading. He felt his heart skip a beat and he let out a shaky breath as he exhaled, his bottom lip quivering. He didn’t know why, he just felt as though he understood, in a way, the expectations Tony had to bear. But he pitied Tony too, for being unable to let go of being a God, to just be human.
Steve stood to face him, narrowing his eyes a little. “I come to spread the ways of my people,” he said. “Manners are a sign of sophistication and evolution, and it is what separates us humans from titans. Or is it that Spartans consider themselves less evolved than the rest of Greece? Are you titans rather than sons of your god, Spartan? Such a statement would not surprise me in the slightest.”
Tony blinked in surprise at Steve’s actions, even though it was pleasant. “How was your sleep?" he asked, wrapping his arms around Steve's body to kiss him back, pushing his hair out of his eyes.
“I’ll show him how he’s wrong, how killing you or your people will be nothing but our downfall,” Tony said. “I’m my own man now, Steve. I will do as I deem right.”
“You made this?” Steve asked with surprise, seeing how well-crafted it was. “You have a talent my friend.”
When Nick Fury stepped into the gym, filling him in all the details about Loki and the Tesseract, Steve Rogers wasn’t pleased with all the new information that he acquired. The files under the persons being called in for the Avengers Initiative however, had a little surprise in them. When he saw Tony’s name, or let’s say, surname, written, his heart filled with hope, the photo of him resembling the younger Howard Stark he personally knew. Same posture and cocky smile, Steve thought they would have a similar character as well, and it would be nice to have someone with links of his past to talk with.
“Perfect?” Tony asked, lifting his head to give Steve a soft kiss. “You really felt that way about it? I was worried; you are after the son of the virgin goddess, I had to take good care of you, you really deserve the best."
“Because you were certain of your people,” Steve said sadly, “I cannot change destiny... And you will lead your army and destroy my home.” He took a couple of steps away from Tony instead, walking over to the corner where his scrolls were resting, kneeling down next to them to pick them up. “You must be proud, Spartan.”
“And what’s the point praying to the God of War, Athenian? My prayers won’t be heard, do you think that I didn’t try before?” Tony asked him, raising his voice this time around. Steve was plainly implying that he wasn’t either wise or pure.
Tony spoke with such bitterness, and Steve could understand why; the device on his chest did seem painful to keep there. “Does it hurt..?”
“True,” Steve muttered, keeping his eyes shut as he pressed his face against the pillow, his body exhausted.
Then there was Sparta, one of the most feared cities, ruled by Ares, god of war, keen to exert its power through its infamous army. However, its structures rivalled that of Athens, possessing its own unique buildings that were often larger, and projected dominance in the way that they were composed. Whilst Athens was proud of its scenery and natural beauty, Spartans were filled with determination to compete, and thus saw it as their own duty to make their city more superior than any other in Greece.
Tony stayed silent for a moment, thinking about his answer. Of course he did, but would he come off as too needy? No, he couldn’t, since just moments ago Steve was holding him and kissing him. He nodded. “I do.”
“Guys, hold on, we have a bigger problem here”, Tony called, flying towards the water. “Nuclear missile, I have an idea of where to put it. Keep that portal open”, he said, trying hard to match the missile’s speed.
“Good. Don’t make a mess without me”, Tony chuckled, waving at the Captain, who waved back and leaned against the window, admiring the rest of the precious view. Ever since he woke up he seemed to be exposed in all sort of different experiences, and this sure was one of them. “I wish you could see where I am right now, Ma”, he said with a smile, sitting on the floor and resting his head against the window, closing his eyes for what seemed like a moment. The next thing he saw was Tony leaning down to him and poking his cheek slightly.
“Got it!”, Tony nodded, firing his repulsors against the force field that seemed to protect Kang, avoiding the rays shooting from his gun.
Tony heard this before. He heard from Pepper how scary and agonising was to fall out of love, having the person that meant everything to you treat you like a proper stranger, not being there when you mostly needed them, totally ignoring you. Bad thing is, she didn’t warn him about how painful and scary was to fall in love with someone. And the worst; she didn’t mention how self-harming and horrible was when the feeling wasn’t mutual.
