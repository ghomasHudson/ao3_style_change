Rhodes looked at Pepper in alarm; he hadn't realized that.  Pepper shrugged helplessly.  "...you sure?"
exercise," protested Tony.
"I'm not like Tricky, I'm a good--"
Tony let Steve tug him upstairs to the bedroom and half-push him into the shower to get clean.  He was dying with curiosity so he obliged Steve's requests; he got in the shower to rinse off the sweat and semen and Steve's smell off of him, and brushed his teeth for a good two minutes, hoping to mask any hint of the alcohol, since Steve was obviously pissy about that.
It happened so suddenly that Tony didn't have time to react.
Tony sat up groggily, yawning.  "Oh, man, I missed the part with the guy's tongue..."  His heart was beating surprisingly fast considering he'd just woken up.  He pulled aside his shirt to check the arc reactor, but it looked normal.
When Tony leaned his head against him Steve leaned his own atop of Tony's. He let his eyes slip shut and curled a hand around Tony's bicep. "You are
"And HYDRA," said Mackenzie, frowning a little.
"So you're in a trio?"
"Tony, what are you doing?" cried Pepper in alarm.
Tony glanced over at Steve.  The happiest? Huh.
"If he's sorry, then he can say it to me himself," Steve mumbled. His eyes were red around the edges and his cheeks were flushed in an ugly sort of way. Donner had let go of his hand to clutch at his belly. Steve returned to clutching at Tony's shirt, shoving his face against his chest, as if he could somehow hide himself there.
"Not even the episode where she gets a job in a chocolate factory?" asked Fred, eyes widening teasingly.
He woke with a gasp.  He reached up to touch the back of his neck.  The circular bite scar,
With a shaky hand he took the pill and swallowed it dry, not wanting to sit back up.
"That's so great. I'm so glad you can be you. You're great," Steve told him. He let Trey hug him, or rather cling to him, but then he quickly fell back into his brother's arms. He was giggling. Steve realised he was drunk, too.
Of course he wanted him to put it on.  But seeing that heavy Victorian collar in the museum had bothered him deeply.
"Are you eating?"
"Tony!  You and Steve left in a big rush and your room is a complete disaster area.  I can't let housekeeping in because--"
feel it.
Sam almost smiled. "Yeah. That actually sounds like him. But you said he
"A dick?"
he thought.  Behind him, the heart monitor beeped a little faster, but it was too late, he was going under and he couldn't--
Steve lifted his leg and Hill walked over to strap the tracker onto his leg with a little more force than was probably necessary. "Why the entourage?" Steve asked. "Worried I'd say no?"
"I just think it's a beautiful message and, oh my God, Stevie, we were all
to, not because my stupid biology makes me do it. Who cares if you're a good Alpha? You're a good
Tony huffed a sigh.  He disagreed with Steve on that one.  It was too late to save Ty from getting shipped off to some fucked up torture camp where they'd cut out his bonding gland and who knows what else; Tony wondered if Ty smelled as eerie to other omegas as he did to Alphas.  He'd already asked Pepper, who had been surprised and said, no, of course she didn't sense anything wrong, how could she? Tony had struggled to explain to her what it smelled like but it had proved impossible because hormonal cues and pheromones were practically a sixth sense and Pepper, as a beta, had no way to even know what normal smells were like, how easily you could distinguish Alphas and omegas, how easily you could read hierarchies.
He took out an egg and cracked it on the end of the bowl.  It didn't split evenly. He gave it another tentative whack, but it still didn't break.  He frowned at it carefully, thoughtfully, getting overly focused.
"Fuck." Steve whispered against his cheek as the head of Tony's cock squeezed inside of him. He slid down slowly, savouring the sensation until his cheeks were rosy and his ass was full. It a foreign thing, being in charge of the pace for once. Steve wasn't sure how he wanted it, but he was about to find out.
"I would prefer not to retire anytime soon.  It is important that you cooperate."
The smoke had cleared and Steve rolled down behind the car just as a new volley of suppressing fire began. Regretfully, he pulled out his own pistol.
"You won't win," said Pietro flatly.  "If you love James so much, come back to him.  He misses you, you know. He's downstairs. You could go to him, right now.  He's still in there. You have nowhere else to go, so why not?"
Pepper made a nose of frustration.  "...I'll make some phone calls but I can't give you any promises.  Is that good enough?"
"SA is for omegas only," said Tiberius, looking annoyed at Happy's hovering.
Now really was not the time for this.
"James.  Write it in your notebook, okay?  Wanda and I are trying to make plans," said Pietro, without looking up.
"I am
"Aw, that's nice."
Then he stepped back. Steve put his hands on his chips, looking cheeky. "Close your eyes or no surprise. And no peeking.  Also...no super high expectations. It's just something little."
Now, of course, wasn't the time to ask.  Steve had gotten an erection and one of the camera crew was artfully placing a couch cushion over his groin in an attempt to hide it.
Maria's gun dropped; she swayed and blinked.  "Wh-- what?"
Tony poured himself a glass of gin and threw in an olive.  Garnishes, he learned, were often the difference between looking like a lush and looking like a cultured drinker.
But Tony was all about recklessness.  The heady feeling of abandon he got right before sex, right before doing anything dangerous and stupid, was one he pursued with gusto.  He supposed he might technically qualify as an adrenaline junkie; he'd once jokingly told "Wired" magazine that the Stark Standard for missiles was that, during the initial launch, he expected to get either goosebumps or an erection.  He was only half-kidding.  His  brain had long since tied together sex and weapon launches and flying, and sometimes, when Tony was frustrated and no girls were handy, he went for a flight over the Pacific instead.  Last time he'd taken the liberty of shooting at seagulls, which had netted him a nice, aggressive bit of media attention from PETA even though, he pointed out, he hadn't actually shot down a single bird, just scared them a little.
Stone just hummed. Steve was feeling judged again. Was this just how Ty was, or was this actually because of Tony? Because if it was, that wasn't exactly fair on him.
The asset's eyes lit up in a way Steve hadn't seen before; the glassy, distant look disappeared and his face, once blank, suddenly broke into a smile.
"Yes, sorry about that. I was...busy.  Sir."
Tony scoffed.  "Lemme guess.  You secretly knew him too, right, Laura Croft?   My God, no wonder he didn't have time for me, he had this whole secret SHIELD family to nurture... Which brings me back to the question about how you guys deal with your cycles... "
for a blank book?" he demanded in frustration.  "It contains no information."
"There's, erm, a bruise on my neck," Steve said quietly. "But that's it."
"You know, that was the original name of his robot?  The one he built in college? Bunn-E. Because it had two antennaes, remember, Tony?  Like rabbit ears."
"I don't want Richard to know.  I, uh... I want to stay anonymous, though," said Rex awkwardly as he put Steve's number into his phone.  "Richard's got a good career and besides, Pine Hills was already closed. I'm a good omega. I don't like to cause trouble.  I was really, really lucky Richard adopted me after, you know. I don't want to make things difficult for him." He gestured vaguely toward his neck.  He didn't need to tell Steve that his arvicolinectomy had not gone well. While Ty's smell was eerie and uncomfortable, it was lovely compared to Rex's.  Rex's pheromones screamed at Steve to get away. There was an acrid, fear-like quality to them. It wasn't a smell so much as a feeling, one of repulsion.  The feeling you got when you thought you saw something evil out of the corner of your eye late at night. As if Rex's body had permanently gotten stuck in the state it had been in at Pine Hills; whatever testimony he could give was nothing compared to the torture that was burned into his body's pheromones.
Pepper blinked and her ears went pink with the frankness of Phil's answer.  "Something I can make in the kitchen, I meant."
There was a pause, and Natasha said, "...uh, yes."
"...cancel the wine," he mumbled begrudgingly, glaring at Steve a little.  He would just have to make up for it after the simulation.
"Smell something like what? I've been stuck with your sorry ass for eight hours--"
Natasha pushed her hair behind her ear. "Some people are also calling Steve a hypocrite, because you saved him," she said and pulled a face with a small shrug.  "The press really, really likes that ER photo and... well, it shows Steve being cradled by his Alpha.  People are saying he shouldn't have put himself into that position in the first place."
of--"
"But it doesn't make it easier to live with," Irshad pointed out softly. Her drink looked sweet, some kind of fruit juice concoction that was littered with pomegranate seeds on top. She changed the subject smoothly. "I was impressed with your interviews, by the way, especially considering you only just woke up here. And, for the record, my mother always told me you were an O."
Fury stood and handed Natasha the suitcase of syringes.  "My team will escort you back to your home."
"But what are the chances, Steve?  You got lucky, you were frozen, but your-- your friend.  He was declared dead.  1944.  I mean, the-- the Smithsonian-- he got all those medals, post-mortem...."  Tony stopped talking.  He could smell Steve's discomfort.
subconscious.  I'm not responsible for any insecurities he has.  Second of all, this is
Then his vision fuzzed at the edges again. "Oh no. Don't you dare. Don't you--"
His Russian wasn't perfect but he knew what Karpov had said and Bucky was distinctly not doing it.
"Steve?"
"You're not bonded.  You don't get it. Secondary Alphas are like fucking eunuchs, Rhodey.  And he's not an
"Oh, it's okay. It was just an accident. I wasn't in a war, like you."
Judy turned to Steve and Tony.  "You two want to ride in the cruiser?"
"--shit."  Tony set his drink down and smiled.  "Pepper, hi, oh my gosh, look at you, you look stunning... ladies, the CEO of my dad's old company, Virginia, this is Annette and Christina and Jessica and Christine, ladies, Miss Potts..."
tell me you don't mean the band," Tony had said.  "I mean the band," said Jeanette humorlessly.)
"You wanna drive the bike down to the base?  I know a really nice restaurant... thought we could have a little lunch date before you and Nat fry my brain," he said with feigned casualness.  He eyeballed Steve's outfit.  "...unless you were planning on running there?"
He didn’t change much to the painting but adding more color to the grass and stores around the park. It made it more poppy and had a better balance. Wasn’t that helpful but Tony looked at him like he just changed the world. His brown eyes shone towards Steve.
Tony should be a pro at this. Or maybe he was just a perfectionist, Clint guessed.
Steve hates that Tony keeps sacrificing himself
Tony stumbled out of the bed, getting tied up in the sheets, as he raced towards the door. He bumped and tripped on things in his messy room, but he couldn’t feel the pain. All he felt was was someone squeezing at his chest and stomping on his heart. He needed out of that room to breathe. Tony pulled the door open and threw himself out onto the floor. It was cold, a totally difference than how that room was suffocating him.
Natasha nodded in fake agreement.
“We’re here. You got this boss.” Happy shot encouragement out from the front seat.
People could have died, Steve thought as he knocked the door. Clint could have gotten more than a broken ankle, Steve thought. Why wasn’t he there, Steve thought.
But Tony was singing about wanting a head on his shoulder.
Tony’s only weakness.
“Okay.”
Forgetting that all this ever happened might be what Tony had to do. He could act like this never happened. The man had been acting all his life, it would be easy. He could wipe those feelings away and that kiss. Ghey could both do it.
“No, your not! Your suit clashes with your shoes and your hair isn’t brushed. Pepper and Happy aren’t even here! This has to be perfect and we’re running behind.” Tony rambled before pacing around the room shoeless, “And my socks are mismatched!”
“It’s not bad to cry. In fact, I think it makes a person stronger.”
But she wasn’t going to give up. Something was hidden that was just too good for everyone to know.
“Oh your so strong, Steve, did you know that?” Tony slowly said as his eyes started to fluttered to sleep.
Steve just needed to know why. He had to know.
They left Tony to his clueless thoughts as they settled in the couch’s to watch cartoons.
“Sir is on his floor in the last room, Captain Rogers.” The British voice sounded more chipper today when talking to him. Steve guesses he wasn’t mad him anymore and was thankful.  He didn’t like that feeling of the A.I distrust. A person, well similar to a person, who didn’t like him watching at all times was weird.
Soon a tiny head with fluff curls popped out. Tony’s face was sweaty and red, but he still shivered. The hoodie he was wearing didn’t bring much warmth.
“Where were you?” Steve barked, crossing he arms.
She wrapped the blanket tighter around her body and walked towards. Natasha didn’t have any type of weapon on her for once. Maybe she had gotten too comfortable in her new environment, but she didn’t feel threatened here. It was safe enough to call home. It was safe enough that she wasn’t scared of what’s ahead of her.
They broke apart, and stared into the others eyes. Tony wondered how long they would be doing that in their lives, just staring at the other. Living with the other. Tony wanted to do that forever.
It was a game of cat and mouse. And Tony was tired of it.
Steve drove through the more grimy part of New York where he know Tony wouldn’t be there willingly. He knew how much of a rich boy Tony was and knew Tony wouldn’t step anywhere close in this part of town. Tony didn’t even know about this part of town!
“Where’d you find that?” Tony crossed his arms in a huff, “ Snooping around in my stuff, huh?”
No, he wasn’t going to chew him out, he just wanted an explanation. Some good reason why he wasn’t there! If Tony didn’t provide, then he was going to chew him out.
Steve nodded no.
Once done, Thor couldn’t wait to give the scarf to Tony. He found the man on the way out of the lab, sleep deprived and stumbling.
“Don’t be nervous, you can come closer.” Steve suggested. Tony scooted close enough that Steve could wrap his arm around his body and pull him closer. He wanted to do so, so badly, but it wasn’t the time.
“Wh- Well, no, thanks and all but umm, I just-“
All Tony’s relationships ended up in pain.
Real bad.
“Don’t apologize; I know you don’t mean it.”
“You don’t care?”
“I don’t want this. I don’t want you.” rang through Steve’s ears. He had no idea how he was still standing at this point with his legs going limp. His past feelings of bliss plummeted towards the ground and out of his body, right next to his feet. Then his heart followed suit, breaking once it hit the ground. A small pile of his feelings torn into two right by to Steve’s feet, torn so easily by eight words.
Steve grief was still pounding in his chest.
“I have made a grand mistake. I’ve torn Tony’s family scarf and now it’s ruined.”
Clint could name what it was now that was popping up during the night.
“Jarvis, show me where Tony is.” He ordered. The GPS popped the direction and started the car. He tried to keep his voice steady and not as shaky as he felt.
Tony was put to bed and now it was time for Steve to leave. No matter how much Steve wanted to stay to make sure Tony was okay or didn’t choke on his own puke he couldn’t. He wanted to talk about Tony about this so badly but it wasn’t his business. He wasn’t Tony’s boyfriend, he wasn’t even Tony’s friend. He was just his teammate.
Nah, it couldn’t be.
Or maybe a lot. Nobody needed to know.
Tony had always been a flirt but this was different. Anyone that he ever kissed will say he was amazing but with Steve . . . Tony wanted to give it his best. He was never supposed to kiss Steve, he knew it, but it was too hard to resist. Tony had been wanting to do that since forever.
“Well, I better get going. Who’s going to fix this huh?” Tony reflected while picking up the device. He shook his head, trying his best not to look Steve in the eyes.
Steve hadn't answered, not properly.  He had nightmares of being sold off.  The serum had erased the mark on his neck (all marks, everywhere; it had healed every scar and even his bellybutton had gotten more shallow) and after a while he couldn't even feel Bucky anymore.  Being an unbonded horseshoe in his time was a hell of a liability and he didn't want to go to an auction.  He didn't want to be with an Alpha he hadn't chosen himself.
"A memory," said Phil, standing at the window casually, hands clasped behind his back.  "His brain is referring back to a conversation."
"I think so; I'm beat."
"Tony, let's be real, okay?  You only care about this because of a bunch of preconceived notions of what's normal.  You think of trios as an Alpha with two omegas, or a beta and an omega. But it's the twenty-first century, man, and sometimes trios have two Alphas, and it doesn't make you less of an Alpha, okay?  ...and anyways, it's a moot point, because he was very, very clear that you don't have a trio and you're his only Alpha."
Tony's brow furrowed; the gears in his mind were turning.  "Air traffic control. Let's pull the data of all flights leaving Moscow in the last twenty-four hours."
He gave himself a few yanks but it was hopeless.  Accidentally objectifying Steve after everything that had just happened made him feel like the lowest piece of shit on the planet.
"Not kids, if that's what you're getting at," said Tony immediately.  The audience groaned good-naturedly, and Boswell offered a tight smile.
When Tony was by himself, he opted to spend about half his time at home in the shop.  Even though the whole house belonged to him, Tony often felt like the garage was the only place that was truly
"You wanna come in my mouth?" Steve asked, voice low. He didn't know if Tony planned to finish like this, or in some other position. Before Tony answered he moved to take him in again, bobbing his head a few times before he let the head squeeze into his throat.
"...that's a lot less fun than a sketchbook," said Tony.
"You're a good drawer. I had no idea," Phil commented as he finally glanced around. Steve half smiled.
A young woman got into it on the way up and clearly recognized him, her eyes widening. "
A quiet sound escaped from the back of Steve's throat as lips parted and Tony's tongue was in his mouth. His Alpha was everywhere, all over him and around him and making his head spin. Steve shivered against him.
"He's... he's a good guy, if that's what you mean.  He's more dominant than Tony but not quite as dominant as me."
The man in the chair stopped swiveling.
"At least let me help," Steve sighed. "This is what I'm
It felt good to just
"I don't actually know where we're going," he admitted sombrely. "I've just got to get you somewhere safe."
"Please," Steve whimpered. "Please just give it to me--
"Sorry!" he piped up.
"What?"
Ah.  So he was one of those, who would order Donner to be bad and then smack his around.  Donner's muscles tightened a little, readying himself for it, and forced himself to look into the Alpha's eyes.  After only a few seconds, he dropped his gaze again.
Steve ignored his teasing.  "Apparently this woman called Ellen Something wants to interview me. And the
The delivery driver was halfway through making his first stack (Tony had tried one and approved) when Steve wandered in sleepily in a robe.
Pepper was pinching the bridge of her nose in exasperation.
Natasha answered before anyone else could, her arms crossed over chest. "Yes," she said flatly. "A functioning albeit, but
"I told you, we're
No, he can't, Clint!"
"Steve?" he called gently, sliding open the glass door to the pool deck.  "...hey. You mind if I come out here with you?"
"That's all we ask," said Brennan gently.
She dragged Steve back toward the lights to show off her work.  Everyone agreed it was "daring."
Bucky looked down, then up.  "Do I have to finish this?"
Tony wondered how hard it would be to get his hands on a bald eagle.
"I can come back up, after I talk to the doctors."
"It's fine, I only got one today," said Pietro.  He was talking a little too fast. Bucky studied him.
"How poetic," slurred Tony, solving the cube.  He began mixing it up again for another round.  He could generally solve them in a couple of minutes; he just liked having his hands busy.  "I lost Steve and now I'm being rained on.  In the house.  Because there's a hole in my roof.  Because I beat up my best friend.  On my birthday.  JARVIS, I think I might be a mess."
did you say?  You don't mean the
Tony squinted at the photo.  "...I..." He wasn't certain.  "...I don't know. That might be it.  ...yeah. Maybe. I'm like... sixty-five percent sure?  ...I'm sorry, it's just... Steve..."
Tony didn't wait to make sure they were listening.  If he was right (and he had a sinking feeling that he was) then he was about one or two minutes away from being attacked.  It was Monaco all over again.
, he'd nearly lost him, with Vanko, now with HYDRA.
Lila was still crying and Clint was trying and failing to calm her down. The way he was looking down at her made Steve's chest constrict a little. He'd never seen Clint look at anyone like that before, not even Natasha.
"Yeah, probably Steve."
It was only once they walked away from the desk that Tony realized Piper hadn't said a single word to them.
Steve ended up being pulled back down into Tony's lap, restoring contact.
"I can't, I can't sit, I'm too wired--"
Steve turned to face Tony and pointed his phone at him. "You need to calm the hell down Tony. He's sick and he's confused and he needs treatment."  He could tell Tony was about to protest; he cut him off. "He did whatever they told him to.
Tony nosed behind Steve's ears, seeking out his scent glands instinctively, nibbling his neck.  "Omega," he said with delight.
Reed laughed.  "Or a hundred and sixty lobsters."
. "...but, y'know, now we're just friends, and of course she wants me to be happy. She was bonded, had a career, the whole package. She wants that for me, too.  To have a real life, like that, like how she and all of my other friends did."
Well shit, okay. That seemed like  a big deal. Was it a big deal? Steve wasn't sure. Last time he'd met a president it hadn't been a great experience. He didn't have the greatest of track records but he was willing to give Ellis a chance. This was a  gesture. He was extending a hand out to them. It felt like they should take it.
"Please?"  From behind him appeared Banksy.  Tony was immediately smitten; he was gorgeous.  His blond hair fell down to his jaw but he'd tied it back in a tiny ponytail.  All of Tony's concerns about looking too festive had evaporated; Banksy was wearing an outrageously loud green and red suit with a matching tie.  He was grinning, practically bouncing with excitement, and he squealed when he noticed Steve. "
"Never underestimate their egos," Fred warned him. "Some of them don't want to bet, but they also don't want to fold. Alphas are always selfish when it becomes a battle for dominance."
"No moping," Steve repeated, as if that somehow helped him do exactly that. He sighed. Tony was right. He was making this about him again...when it really wasn't. If Donner wanted a baby then he guessed it wasn't the worst scenario in the world. Pregnancy might even do him good.  Unlikely, but he had to have hope.
the twenty-first century.  Those are the only kinda rights we got.  Like, what sorta thing are you..." He trailed off, staring into Steve's eyes, gaze glazed.  "...you got like... like the bluest eyes, man."
Tony smiled, shifting a little so he could look up.  "I'll get you a warm towel," he said softly. He kissed the inside of Steve's thigh before getting up and stretching, looking down at the relaxed blond on his bed.
This close, Steve could smell her.  She was dominant, unbonded, and confident.
Tony placed a hand on Steve's arm and pulled him toward the bathroom.  "Brush your teeth," he commanded.  Steve made a little humming noise and obeyed but Tony could tell he was on autopilot.
Cooper dragged Steve into his room and immediately began the grand tour; Clint stepped on a plastic dinosaur and swore.  "Shit!"
"Uh-huh.  Snuggling up to him, holding his hand and shit," he grumbled miserably.
"Legally, Captain, I can't arm you," said Fury gruffly.  "If you read all those papers you signed, you'd know that.  But I believe you might have recently made the acquaintance of a couple of new friends.  They might be able to help you out."
Kate crossed her arms over her chest and narrowed her eyes at Tony. "Drop the omega and let me do my work or I swear to
There was only one other person Tony truly believed made him a better person, and that was Pepper.  Tony's ego may have been huge, but so were his insecurities; one of his driving forces was for constant
But Tony biting into his neck and holding his wrists down, that
He and Jorge shook hands.  Steve liked interacting with a beta.  It was refreshing to be around someone who was unstatused.
Tony sat next to Steve.  The seats were fake leather, he noted with amusement.  Why they hadn't sprung for real leather was beyond him.
Well, Tony was everything.
“What’s going on Tony? What happened, are you okay? Do I need to get the team or something, we can com-“
Now this was wild.
Everyone took part except Bruce. Thor could be having a difficult time for his disability to be subtle but he was ready to compete.
The gala was going to be his chance, Steve decided earlier that evening. But now thinking about, he didn’t think it all the way through. He didn’t even know if Tony liked him, nevertheless loved him. All the beautiful women here proved that loud and clear. Steve couldn’t compete with them, he would lose every time. He just wasn’t enough. He would never be enough.
Tony wiped his face quickly and started to pick up the pieces of his dignity left on the floor. He was going to call Happy and go home.
But now Tony was no where to be found. It seemed every time Steve tried to find Tony he was no where to be found.
“Don’t you dare walk out that door.” Steve pleaded, grabbing Tony’s arm causing the man to drop the box. “I’m sorry okay, I’m sorry. I should have told you, I know I should have, but I didn’t. And I’m sorry for that.”
Steve leaned forward and kissed him. It was passionate and really his last “ha ha” moment against the universe, just like how they got together at that gala. He held Tony around the waist, the brunettes hand holding Steve’s face as they kissed. They very last kiss of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. They soon parted away, both out of the breath.
If he only could.
Steve’s limbs moved without as he walked towards the man with the need to just protect. He sat down and tried to wrap his arms around his boyfriend but was pushed away.
“Nothing. I’m coming home early. I’ll be there before 10, don’t wait up for me.” The called ended.
“You don’t have to believe me, but it’s true.” Steve tilted Tony’s chin upwards to make eye contact, ”I’m sorry.”
“No need to apologize. It’s no problem, but how about we blow this joint? It’s getting a little stuffy in between talking about Avengers and stock markets.” Clint turned to set his glass down.
But once out of the limo, it vanished. His paparazzi smile engulfed his face like it belonged there. It was cool and suave. He looked in control. A total difference of  what Clint had just witnessed in the last hour. Tony wrapped his arm around Peppers waist and looked ready for war. They were the definition of a power couple and gave the paparazzi what they wanted.
But he wasn’t here to rethink his life choices. He was here to see Steve and maybe calm down. Tony knew Steve would make it better, the man made everything better. Tony realized he might be sounding like a kid in need of comfort, but he wasn’t. He was fact checking to make sure he wasn’t wasting his time trying to change.
It smelled great, a little bit overpowering on his nose and it was warm. Steve was relaxed, anyone would be relaxed, but Tony was still closed off. But the blonde understood, he would never be back to himself after his mom died. Not even with Bucky, their will always be a part of him gone.
“What do you mean?” Steve raised his hand to cup Tony’s check but drew it back quickly. Tony just knew Steve’s hand was supposed to be there. But he didn’t deserve Steve, he never would. It was better for Steve not to touch him- then the feelings will stop and everything will stop! They would stop thinking that they were meant to be.
“Umm . . . Why didn’t you tell Tony about the battle?” He rumbled the back of his neck in embarrassment.
“I’m going to take one of your cars okay! I’ll won’t be long.” He told Tony, rushing into the garage.
Tony must have not been hearing right. Perfect Steve did not just come here and ask him out! He couldn’t have. Tony was Tony and Steve was Steve, it wasn’t Tony and Steve. It would never be Tony and Steve.
Who would be up at 3 am? Nothing fun happens at 3. Steve learned that after 1, things start calming down and there’s no reason to be out past 2. Remembering this fact, Steve became a bit annoyed at someone ruining his beauty sleep. Without it the captain was a mess and cranky, just ask the rest of the team.
“So Rhodey and Pepper were telling the truth?” Tony’s face turned red immediately and he couldn’t stop it from growing. He looked down at his hands trying to find something to do with them. The man didn’t like being the center of attention, at least not now where everyone in the room wanted to know.
But he was here already. And making the journey back to his room- God he didn’t want to do it. He wouldn’t. Tony kicked at the door and held his breath, scared about what was to come.
“You already lost me. I just want to know, which part of me wasn’t enough that you had to lie to me? You knew for years and didn’t tell me, clearly you didn’t trust me. “ Tony walked closer to Steve, voice calm as ever, “ I told you everything, all on the table. My depression and insecurities and you were there for me- I’m thankful. But all  good things come to an end, huh?” Tony places his hand in Steve’s cheek.
Those weeks they spent together getting to know each other meant everything to him. Even more than his time spent with Peggy, although he will always value that. But to Tony, those weeks meant nothing.
Tony jumped once finally noticing her.
“Quite wonderful isn’t it.” He answered glancing up at the white chandeliers and people mingling behind them, “I hope the other Avengers are doing fine and rested after the attack.”
Steve just didn’t want this to become a routine. Seeing Tony limp around the tower, avoiding him with fake smiles and hiding his pain, that wouldn’t become a routine.
She didn’t enjoy this Tony as much.
Soon a light touch glided Steve’s face back to Tony’s eyes.
Steve didn’t know cars. Not yet.
“Sorry.” Steve said absently.
They grew a bit more closer.
”I like your laugh. You don’t have to say anything.” They we’re close enough to share a breath, close enough to connect lips. Tony was right in between his legs so that Steve could wrap his arms around his waist.
Tony longed to feel that type of love he’s sensing right now. No matter how many time he has had his heart broken, Tony still longed for it. Maybe he always will. But right now, right now with Steve holding his hands, he could feel it in the room. Tony didn’t want to admit it but he did.

Maybe that moment could start a relationship, Steve thought. He just needed to work on his flirting. And he had time to do that. He could also practice on trying to make tony red again too. It’ll all come together later, but now he could wait.
It was a bleak scene.
Wassup, tried to get this finished as fast as possible for y’all in this trying time. Please Comment if you can, I’m always grateful
He knocked again.
“You better keep it.”
“Stay. I just. . . don’twanna to be alone.” His words slurred together because of the sleep. Steve froze. Was his prayers just answered? Was there a god out their actually listening to his, his selfish prayers? It was just too good to be true.
“Oh she was. My mother, Frigga, taught Loki his skill and everything you humans in earth would call magic. She even made it her goal to be the bested dresses for she was queen.” Thor grew more nostalgic as he explained. He hasn’t been to Asgard since returning Loki for his punishment and that was months ago, almost a full year. Thor missed his mother’s soft glance at him and his fathers smirk. Hell, he’ll even admit he missed his brother and his tricks. But he couldn’t go back or the nagging would start. His family was famous for their nagging.
Steve turned back to the bar, never releasing his fist, and stared at the counter. He didn’t want to see the damage done to his hand- his heart already had been through enough- Steve didn’t need to see anymore. Steve just couldn’t believe what he saw, well he didn’t want to believe, but it was real.
“Yep.” Clint answered. He was in his nicest suit, a nice dark greenish hue, and he actually brushed his hair. It was the first press gala for the Avengers and fortunately Tony and Clint were picked to go. This gave him an opportunity to get ahead in the game and learn a bit more about Tony.

“It’s okay Thor. The scarf was old anyway, it wasn’t that important anyway. I’m . . . gonna go check on Steve or something.” Tony quickly retreated from the room, taking the dusty boxes with him.
“Your not evil Tony. What else did I do?” Steve asked as he sat up in the bed. But the man was already asleep. What else did he do! What if he tore Tony down or kicked him off the team or said that he didn’t love Tony? What if Dream Steve ruin a whole entire relationship? For all Steve knew the relationship was over because Tony believed any negative thing he thought of himself.
Steve eyes glanced at Tony while the man finished the last touches on his hand. God, he just wanted to remember his face this close up. He wanted to work out the last details of his face before he cut the last string. Before he let Tony go.
Or Steve didn’t give him any reasons to.
He was nothing.
Tony had somehow slipped by his side, which shouldn’t had happened, but Clint was a bit off edge at the moment.
Ok, that was good prize. Movie nights could be pretty monstrous if a specific person got to choose the movie. Such as when Bruce picked some documentary and a pillow fight was thrown out of the boredom. Then the hulk came for a visit. Then, the hulk forced them to sit down and watch quietly.
He couldn’t change himself anyway.
“And what do you want me to do?” Bruce grew more enticed when Tony’s name was mentioned. First, because Tony was his friend and secondly, because he was the ref in their contest. It was exciting watching his teammates fight over Tony over the last week, especially when Tony was obvious to it all. It was hilarious.
But Steve didn’t belong in hell.

With him!
But Steve understood and would even do the same. He had heard about Tony’s ex’s from Pepper when Tony and him started out. It was warning, Pepper made it so very clear, that if Steve did anything remotely close to what those did before to Tony she would kill him with her heels. Steve had seen her heels-they were sharp enough to kill him.

But nobody needed to know that.
What was this man hiding?
“We can’t be together Steve. No matter how much you want it. No matter how much I want it. But it wouldn’t work out, we’re not- we’re not perfectly fit.”
His joints screamed at him to stop as Tony pushed himself up. The tears were still running down his face but he wasn’t sobbing anymore. He could be ok.
“Okay we can try and see where this will lead.”
“I don’t want to talk to you.”
The crooked fake smile was back on his face.
Because Tony was Tony. And Steve was Steve. They shouldn’t mix.
around himself, as of it was holding everything together. That gave her his answer. He wasn’t ok. Anyone could see that he wasn’t ok.
No answer.
“What do you want?” The head said softy. It’s wasn’t spiteful or full of hatred, just tiredness.
“Go.” It was harsh as if he was trying to hurt Steve.Tony had finally locked eyes with him, cold and unwavering, but he meant it. Steve paused, looking at those eyes that started to waters slightly, just waiting for him to leave.
“Hey, be careful! It’s not dry yet!” Tony yelled as he tried to get the painting out of Steve’s grab. Steve held it up high so the smaller man couldn’t reach.  Tony jumped up again Steve trying to reach but steve started to laugh as he fell back into his seat.
Tony had to be heavily drinking.
“Tony you-“she sniffed, “ You need to get back to the tower now. Clint’s hurt bad. He’s in surgery right now but you need to get here. Now.” Natasha cried into the phone. She was painting her nails a nice pink hue, the name was something dusty but nail polish names were all weird, as she tried to find something to watch on T.V.
Tony shook the thought away as he ran faster. He needed to find something. A object or a person or an animal. He would even settle for the devil! Just so he wasn’t so utterly alone. Maybe if he ran fast enough, he would find something before they left. And they could figure this out together and escape or work out his punishment.
The rest of the evening passed in blur and a confusing amount of people were carrying around orchids. Some people offered their congratulations as they went. Haley pulled Steve into a tight hug and told him to call. Steve looked stunned for pretty much the rest of the evening.
...which meant Tony had all morning to check out the POSSV group.
"I majored in drama for a whole year, you know."
He was a bit concerned about what Steve might think of as sexy.  Steve had a lot of old-timey sensibilities and Tony couldn't imagine what Steve was possibly going to show him.
. It's not their right to know, or to ask." He could still full an easy self-consciousness tug at his gut that Steve knew wasn't his own.
Tony blinked.  The hell?
"I'll be back down in ten," he promised. Steve definitely needed another shower.  And he also needed to think... how could they show Gideon up? How could they prove to Donner what they already knew? Steve didn't want to make the omega miserable. But in order to save him from himself, it might be necessary.
, they'll eat that up," and, "hey, why don't you start off with that quote about there being no higher service than service to one's country?  Who said that, Nixon?"
"Of course, SHIELD will arrange more security than last time. We aren't prepared to take risks again," Nick said.
"You're his hero," said Clint to Steve with a small roll of his eyes.
"No, wait, I wanna know about my dad," demanded Tony, sitting up.
"Consent is seven letters long," Steve stated calmly. Mike didn't respond, ignoring him. The lift doors opened and they stepped out. The garage level was teeming with flashy cars. He spotted Tony in the corner; thankfully DeSoto hadn't tagged along with him.  DeSoto was back in the pen and would remain there until Tony or the man who was mated to him came to pick him up.
"Love you," he whispered, needing to hear Steve tell him he was loved back, needing confirmation from his omega that, yes, they were a pair, bonded, each other's.
"Or something," agreed Tony.  "...have you talked to Ty? Tiberius Stone.  He was at Pine Hills; he's got all sorts of dirt."
-- the kids, they love their hotspots."
"On foot?  Get in the car, Tony."
Steve knew that he was supposed to be polite and calm, the perfect employee to both Pepper Potts and Tony Stark.  That was his cover.  And being a subservient omega was the best cover in the world.  Fury had sent him on a mission and he intended to complete it.  He arrived to work every day dressed in crisp shirts and smart dress trousers; he looked the part.  He got Pepper everything she needed, and more.  But there was one problem: Tony Stark.  Steve found him annoying: his selfishness, his playboy attitude, his brazenness... everything, really.  Sure, he was clever, but Steve wasn’t sure about bringing him into the Avengers Initiative.  Yet.  Not that it was his decision, though he made a point of citing Tony's many personality defects in all of his reports.  He was tempted to argue with him directly on more than one occasion and had had to stop himself.  Last night he almost had.  They disagreed a lot on a lot of omega rights issues.  For a man living in 2010, Tony was shockingly conservative.  It was probably due to the daddy issues Steve had picked up on, his complicated relationship with Howard, who had dabbled in the omega rights "hysteria" of his time… but it was the rights themselves that the two had half-argued about, not the history.
"Sir," said JARVIS suddenly.
"You go, DeSoto.  I'll just--" Steve tried to pull away but the omega had surprisingly strong grip.
Tony was making a "vomiting" motion to Steve, but Donner seemed oblivious.  "Wait 'til I tell George and Banksy!" he exclaimed, making toward the door, a small spring in his step.
"Sorry, what was that?"
carried
"Steve..." mumbled Tony.
"I can see the cogs turning in your head, dear, but come on, we really need to get you clean. How does the oil just get...everywhere?" Steve asked with a fond sigh, his fingers brushing against Tony's. Steve too was evidently feeling better without an omega who disapproved of everything he did in the house. He tugged on his mate's hand gently. "Come on. The suit's not going anywhere..."
"Give me that," demanded Phil suddenly, pointing to Sitwell's notebook.
Steve tugged out of his grasp and pulled away from him. And without another word he pulled open the sash, climbed out of the window, and fell.
Steve leaned down to nip Tony's bottom lip and then kissed along the edge of his jaw, the movements of his mouth slow. "What's the magic word?" he asked softly in his Alpha's ear, squeezing around the cock inside of him.
"Tony, stop moving, I'm trying to hide these bags under your eyes," admonished Pepper.  She glanced up at Steve. "You look wonderful, Steve. Good job, Aria."
"I'm trying to run your company."
he thought.
Steve's tracker was dead.  Fuck.
Pepper observed him for a moment.  He seemed... okay. She took the bottle with her, though, just in case.
"DeSoto, I'm not angry at you," said Tony.  His voice sounded tired and impatient, even to him.  "I'm going to talk to Ron and tell him how good you were and how happy I am that I won some time with you."
Tony supposed he could spend Steve's entire heat in his suit or maybe go hang out on his yacht, but he didn't want Steve to have to suffer through it alone, and that's what this was: suffering.  Tony had no idea heats were like this. Sure, he knew they were uncomfortable and omegas who didn't take suppressants took off work, but he'd always thought of it like a woman's period or a migraine headache, maybe.  Not like this.
? They took so much of him away that I couldn't even feel him anymore!" Steve said and he was shaking. He was shaking with rage. He'd never said this before. Never said it anyone and it had been building up inside of him all this time. He was
Donner's eyes welled up and he twisted the end of his shirt.  He looked desperately from Steve to Gideon, clearly moments away from having a break down.
"An... accident?
No, he mentally corrected. Not
"...another triple?" asked the waiter, who looked alarmed.
Tony was, in a way, lucky.  No one ogled to back of an Alpa's neck.  He kept his hair a little longer in back to hide the mark and no one had ever noticed.
Mackenzie loped back onto the base.

"...agree with me."
"...did you and him- did you guys... feel this way? asked Tony before he could stop himself.  So much for not asking about Bucky.
"Buy me coffee sometime," Kate told him with a wink and then she pulled away to let him pass.  Steve Rogers walked out of the hospital room and down the hall without a backward glance.
Pepper winced.  "Yes. And you're going with a full detail.  People are going to lose it if they think you're trying to collar Steve... well, they're already losing it."
"I do. I just--" Steve sighed as Tony pulled at his clothes and he let him, not exactly displeased by it. Tony's hands were rough and warm, nothing like Brooke's. She said she liked
He got up to get himself a drink from the mini-bar.  ...a couple of drinks. After spending all day by his parents' graves and then completely failing to fuck his omega or make him feel better, Tony was ready to throw in the towel for the day.
"...I want
"What's the magic word, Rogers?" teased Tony, already going to the cupboard to get the mugs.  He set them on the counter and walked past Steve, trailing his fingers over his back as he passed.
Steve laughed weakly at that, warmed at Tony's attempt at humor. He slid down into his touch and leaned his head on his Alpha's shoulder. "It's actually pretty hard to pee on.  The stick's so little.  No goddamn clue how girls manage it." He fell quiet after that. Steve just focused on keeping his breathing even and steady whilst his gaze remained fixed on tiny stick in his hand.
Steve didn't just sound angry, no. He sounded
He cracked open an eye to watch Steve's reaction to his orgasm.  The expression on his face was one of ecstasy.
"I'm scared to ask what the other two are.  Tony, calm down, you've had concussions before, you're fine--"
Bucky had always accepting the teasing from the guys down at the dock with a smile and a shrug.  Yeah, he
him...
Natasha was edging down the hall; she picked up Tony's face plate.  Normally, Tony would have lost it at someone else touching it-- he was extremely protective of his suits-- but he didn't really care at the moment.  His world had shrunk to Steve. His priorities were getting him to safety and mating him. End of list.
don't have kids," interrupted Tony.  "You and Nat don't have to worry about this, do you?"  Omegas couldn't get Alphas pregnant. That was just biology.  "Question: how does that work? Like, does she wear a strap-on, or--"
He wasn't really hurting Steve right now. But it felt like it was what he needed to say to get a reaction.
Gently, Steve rubbed Tony’s shoulders, using his thumbs to try to ease out the tension.  Tony’s muscles were surprisingly stiff.  He imagined that the Tony Stark lifestyle was a tense thing in and of itself, sometimes.
Steve couldn't let him put the suit on. But how could he stop him? Then he spotted Rhodey stepping in through one of the entrance doors and he sucked in a breath. Yes.
"You...you work with Nat?" That seemed to comfort Steve, if only a little. Although he couldn't remember her mentioning a Rumlow before. But then, maybe this STRIKE thing was a new gig for her, he wasn't sure. Reluctantly, he nodded and stood. Rumlow kept his hand on his elbow and lead him towards a car. He put Steve in the back seat. He heard two men get into the front; Rumlow stayed in the back with him. Steve was feeling around, getting his bearings.  He had not felt this helpless in a long time, and he did not like it.
Tony wanted to protest and tell President Ellis to go shove it but one of the downsides to being bonded to Captain America was forfeiting that right.  Besides, Ellis was a beta.  He wouldn't understand what bonding felt like.  Hell, Tony hadn't appreciated it until recently.  Specifically, when Steve had been cracking his bathtub moments earlier.
He shrugged.  "I don't know."
Pepper steered him outside to try to talk him through it.
"I'm not going to
"...Bucky," repeated the soldier thoughtfully.
or if people think we're weird 'cause he's taller than me. Like you said, challenging stereotypes and blah blah blah.  People who get it, get it. But we could give a thousand interviews and there will still be dicks like Malick who think Steve oughta be
Tony put a hand on the railing and jumped over after him.  It went down a full seven stories before they hit the bottom.
"Yes--
Steve stared at Tony's fingers curled around his own for at least a minute, saying nothing.
Tony cracked open one eye.  "
"You might want to put two or three stitches on this," said the nurse working on Tony's lip.
Donner confirmed Rhodey's thought with his next sentence: "Do you want me to take my clothes off?"
"Trickshot was DeSoto's Alpha's old omega.  You had, like, a thirty-minute conversation about him."
"Certainly, Captain."
Tony heard-- and felt-- his omega's disappointment as he poured himself another martini.
"...you probably have questions," said Natasha.
"You mean apologize to Steve?"
, Aria's spiky, bold lettering (
The soldier took it, baffled, and sat up on the edge of his cot.  Was he supposed to deliver this package to someone? He waited for orders.
"You know, there's so many things in that sentence that freak me out...I don't know where to start."
"I didn't even know there was a lodge," Steve protested as he pressed a triple espresso into Tony's hand before pulling away with his own cappuccino. (He couldn't really feel the caffeine kick so for Steve it was all about the taste.  And the calories.  He put whole milk in his cappucinos and lattes; he had tried not to look too disgusted when Tony had eagerly told him about almond milk.)
"I'm afraid it will be doing a lot more of that," Richard hummed. He turned back to Steve. "I would say, Captain Rogers, that it still looks like you're going into heat. But if you have been, ahem, sedated. Or in a stressful situation... then I would suggest that it probably won't last as long as a normal heat for you, or be as vicious. But being around your mate will mean it will probably come on." Then he moved back to the bedside, checking on Donner again.
"If you don't undress not much is gonna be happenin' pal," Steve told him and tugged Tony up by his onesie's shoulder to kiss him.The kiss was slow and lazy and at some point Steve's shirt was being pushed up and over his head and dropped onto the floor. Then he pulled back a fraction and looked Tony up and down. "We're really gonna have to lose the squirrel suit. Seriously.  Not sure I can deal with this." He grinned and tugged on one of its ears.
"...did I just see what I thought I saw?  Captain America, on his knees?" Gideon Malick slithered up and Tony cringed.
"So...are you saying you flirting with people didn't mean anything? Because I always assumed...well, you made it clear you missed being with women. I thought it meant...something," Steve finally said lamely.
Tony clamored into the backseat of the car with Steve and lay over him protectively, while Steve cried and nosed into his neck for comfort.
"Damn it, Stark!" exclaimed Natasha.
Steve went out for lunch with Kerry and George to give him an update. And he didn't miss the way George's hand lingered on the small of her back when they went up to order their coffees. That made him smile.
"Is it something sexual?" demanded Pepper.
"What do you mean?"

...Steve, Bob Marley is a famous musician," he added.  It was becoming second nature to explain things to Steve.  "So what do you want?"
He and Freak were engaged in an angry discussion when the black SUV pulled up.  Was back-up here already?  The policeman held up a flashlight, but a moment later, he dropped it.  Karpovs recognized the high-pitched pop of a silencer.
, Pepper."
"Peggy Carter from the SSR?" asked Tony in surprise.
"You have very interesting friends, Captain," Gleason said. Even in a preheat, it seemed Clint was eccentric.
"...yes, yes, I quite understand, Dr. Thompson.  We've had plenty of similar concern from parents about his negative influence.  Of course, you've already talked to Mr. Bennett?"
"We wait for Stark to wake up and we carry on," said Fury, clasping his hands behind his back.  His face was expressionless.
Tony had very few things he actually wanted to do on this vacation.  After seeing the war rooms, he was content to let Steve take the lead.  Steve probably knew London better than him, anyway. But it didn't matter where they were, not really.  They were here for their anniversary, which Tony was still trying to wrap his head around; it felt surreal, having been bonded for a year.
"I mean, I'm trying to run a company, Tony, I'm--"  She stopped dead, frustration arrested temporarily.  "
thought Tony.
"Erm..." Steve stared around the room a little panickedly. Everyone was staring and everyone looked important and he was standing there, covered in blood, looking like some sort of deranged bum. It wasn't a good look. He was almost embarrassed. People weren't judging him, however; they more looked alarmed. Steve really didn't look good and he was very much aware of that.
"...hey," demanded Tony suddenly.  "...are you in the sixty or the forty percent?"
"Guess that makes two of us. Get out of my apartment."
"He's setting a fucking fire."  The screen was quickly becoming obscured with smoke.  One of the guards was grabbing a phone on the wall to call the director.
George grinned. "I know a manipulative Alpha when I see one. I promise...I have plenty of experience."
Steve was here because he chose to be. He was trying on collars because he was choosing. Sure, they might represent oppression but right
Tony heaved a world-weary sigh; he would much rather chat with Dr. Richards about dark matter or flirt with Annette, but Pepper was right.  The trick would be finding an opening; a lot of people were on the dance floor.
Steve woke up at six in the morning to Natasha calling him on his phone. He groaned and moved to sit up but found Tony on top of him. He didn't have a hangover, not like he remembered in the forties. The serum had taken care of the alcohol left in his system well enough. Wincing, he eased off of Tony and rolled over to grab his pants. He fumbled for his phone and answered.
I'm sure she's
"I'm fine," Donner said and he sounded like he believed it. An awkward silence followed and it was Rhodey who broke first.
"...wait, where did you get the business card from?" asked Eric, baffled as to where anyone could store anything while wearing nothing but a pair of a boxers.  Gene also looked momentarily confused, but neither of them got an answer, because the lights dimmed and everyone began clapping politely.
He found Tony with a mask over his face and a blowtorch in his hand, the odd spark flying as he moulded something to something else. Steve watched him for a moment, appreciating the curve of his bicep as he moved the torch alone. Steve felt a sudden need to draw him. He set the tray down and then grabbed a spare pencil and paper and started sketching before he knew it.
"We can't keep all these orchids," said Tony after a moment, still staring at them.  He had no idea what they would do with all of them.  You couldn't just dump a thing like that in the trash.  Tony wasn't sentimental but he had to admit, there was a reason he couldn't stand the idea of letting any of the flowers die.  Tony's father's orchid had died shortly after Jarvis had, because Tony had no idea how to care for an orchid.  It had been in his father's study, which Tony hadn't peeked into until over a year after his death; when he finally checked the dusty, mausoleum-like room, the orchid had been shriveled up in its pot and had crumbled to dust when he'd touched the crisp black leaves.  Tony had felt horrified; Jarvis had been tending the damn thing for decades and he'd completely forgotten about it.  At the time, he had consoled himself by thinking that at least it was only a houseplant and not a fish or a cat or something.  But now, knowing what it had meant, he felt guilty all over again.
"--the problem is that... with betas... I don't have to care about them.  I fuck them and that's it.  No... no commitment.  With omegas I feel... when I'm around
"See you when you get back," he said, giving Steve's ass a quick slap and grinning cheekily at him.
"Glad you two worked it out," said Tiberius, inching in.  He grabbed the bottle of pills, opened it, fished one out, and hooked a finger into Steve's mouth.  "Swallow," he commanded, popping the pill in. Steve's eyes were glazed over like a man on drugs.
He sat up groggily.  "Time?"
Tony's mouth quirked up into a smile.  "Oh, yeah. Yeah, if looks could kill..." He laughed.
"...there were status riots in the sixties," explained Tony briefly.  "People were really pissed about omegas voting and going to college and stuff.  That was right after suppressants started really taking off and you could just grab them at the pharmacy.  ...but my point is, Steve, this is, you know, it's 2010, okay?  People are just upset because you're pointing out we still have a way to go and everyone would rather just, you know... people aren't great at changing, that's all.  But you're not going to fuck up.  And if you do, whatever, I'll fuck up with you, it'll be a big fucking mess, but we'll still have each other.  So don't sweat it."
"Don't like the pudding?" Aria grinned at Sitwell over the table that night as they all sat around with bowls of pre-bought pudding.
Both of them froze.
"Cool, thanks!"  Tony turned, tripped over the wire railing, and fell off her balcony.  She rushed over to see if he was okay; he'd already caught himself and was hovering outside a window.  He rapped with his knuckles.
.  The breathlessness was coming from their bond.  Steve could feel Tony and it was shaking him down to his very core.
. "You're an asshole," Steve muttered fondly and ducked his head down, their noses nudging together.  "But fine. We'll call it even," Steve breathed. He swayed with Tony, his eyes half slipping shut. He sighed softly again. "I love you too. I'm sorry. I'm not good at being drunk, I'm out of practice... Brooke was so pretty..."
Tony's fingertips slid up Steve's shoulder to the scar on the back of his neck.  Steve, who barely scarred at all, who healed so rapidly.  Who still retained Tony's bite.  Tony felt a surge of affection; he kissed Steve's temple.  "...where's Pepper?" he asked, changing the topic.  "Can I talk to Pepper?  Where's Rhodey?  Is he okay?"
He flipped the photo over, looking for some more information on it, but there was nothing except for a date.  Tony squinted at the numbers.  They were familiar.  Stane's handwriting.  He must have been the one who took the photo and gave it to Howard.

"...this was my last clean pair of pants," he said, sounding a bit dazed.
"She told you to say that, didn't she?"  Tony was already pulling out his phone, texting furiously.
But they left without answering.  He'd been forgotten.
"What, this?"  Tony cracked it again.
"You got it, boss.  You want to stay at my place tonight?"
Steve's hands flexed by his sides tensely, almost like he was getting ready for a fight. In a way, he was.
"Aw, damn it.  I got Union Jack," said Happy, pouting.
to Steve; Steve's body was eager and willing, but he still took his time when he felt the base of his knot pressing against Steve's wet hole.  He moved his hips slowly, working it in as gently as possible.  His body shuddered when he finally felt Steve's body give, pulling him in, clenching around him; he whimpered unintentionally.  "Yes... oh... good... fuck..." he whispered, forgetting how he'd teased Steve earlier for saying the say thing.  His hands roamed over Steve's shoulders and arms, feeling the smoothness of his skin, the warmth.
"Aw, Pepper has a crush," teased Tony.
, Wanda, you're doing great."
A long pause.
"...army, I think."
"You haven't changed a bit," she said, smiling up at him as they broke.  "Well... except for the..." She reached for Tony's chest.  He grabbed her hand a little harder than he meant to.
Happy looked surprised.  Clearly, he was not used to getting thanked.  "You're welcome," he said.
Donner's eyes welled up.  "...you don't like it?"
want you.  Please. Please?"
that plant!" he declared, to save face.  He was breathing a little too hard.
He wrapped his arms around Steve's waist and lay his head on his shoulder, closing his eyes.  He wasn't great with words, not words that expressed gratitude or humility, anyway.  Instead he enfolded Steve in a hug and swayed with him, the old palladium-model RT node glowing from the wall, the long, precise ink strokes enhancing the shadows it threw across the room.
It was hard for Steve to move but the moment he was released from Gideon's grip on his neck it was like he could breathe again. He could smell Tony; he could hear them going for each other. He wished he could goddamn move. Steve wanted to kill him. He wanted to punish Gideon for
"Would you believe me if I told you that, as a child, I ran away to the circus?" asked Barton.
"If you're so jealous why didn't you just step in and hit on me yourself?" asked Tony.  "...I love it when you come on to me, Steve. If you want attention, all you have to do is ask.  And there's nothing between me and Ji-Yoo anymore. She's seeing some big actor guy now.  Terrance Frost or Vin Diesel or who knows.  One of the guys from
"Why would you ever not have a knotted one? That doesn't even make any sense," Steve mumbled, turning a very pretty shade of pink. He rolled back onto his back and tried to pull a serious face. He failed. He couldn't stop smiling. Steve giggled, cheeks rosy and blue eyes right.
Donner walked over slowly, keeping his eyes down.  He knelt without being asked. Rhodey wasn't sure how the hell to respond to this; he reached out and patted his head softly.  Donner leaned in very slightly to the touch.
"They make us wear collars. They make us fetch things for them. They get rid of you if you don't behave how you like," Steve pointed out as he stood up. "I'm not saying it's as bad as that. But I'm not sure we're treated like people in here."
There were plenty of things about Steve that Tony didn't like or agree with.  But that was because they were fundamentally different people.
upset," said Tony after a moment, very quietly.  "...I
"It's cool," Aria assured him. "It's been interesting, anyhow. Definitely a story to tell the grandkids." She smiled over at him, a twinkle in her eye. Steve laughed softly. "Seriously though.  Are you feeling okay? Especially after you went a little crazy over that coffee mug yesterday?"
"...then I went to... to Afghanistan and... and the... uh... leader... the guy... he... you know... he..."  Tony wasn't exactly pausing, but stretching out words. "...took me... like an omega... and... burned the back of my neck... and... uh... two others... and then... afterwards, they'd... mark me... keeping track, sort of... the cigarettes... I never counted... so... anyways... that's the thing, I guess."
"It will only last a few minutes..."
Tony's stomach twisted uncomfortably when he looked at the food.  He reached for a fork and realized his hands were shaking, hard.
"Do you and Rex have any children?" asked the female Alpha, raising her hand without waiting to be called on.
that smell.  It was the smell of an omega who needed him.  He'd smelled it earlier, in Monaco, but it had been faint then.  Now it was almost overbearing.  He'd never wanted anything more in his life.
"Mm.  True."
"I'm not saying it's easy," murmured Steve, trying to deescalate the situation.  "I'm aware that letting your Allpha take care of you is easier, in a lot of ways. But life isn't about choosing the easy route. If it was, I wouldn't even be here. I wouldn't even be in this century. But sometimes you gotta do hard shit, you've got to be prepared to get dirty, to struggle. That's what real life is. Your Alpha shouldn't be a safety net. They should be your
"Aren't you gonna invite me in?" demanded Tony, hovering.  Steve was on the seventeenth floor.  "I don't wanna park the suit outside, last time I was in Westwood I got ticketed.  They
He took a few moments to answer.  "No."
"Tonyyyy!" sang Justin.  "Hey, Tony Bologna, how's it hanging?"
"Kerry is an unbonded Alpha... she can go get Donner," suggested Tony.
, he thought, even though he knew the bond didn't make them psychic.  But he needed Steve to get the hell away so he could ask Gene about his "services."  Gene was too cool to talk about them in front of Captain America, especially after Steve's outburst the previous day.
Also he was wondering what the fuck Natasha's "special thing" was.
, Tony.  Go get breakfast."
, Steve mentally sighed. "I did try to call a few days ago but I'm afraid I couldn't get through."
"Oh, great,
"FALL BACK!" barked one of the agents, holding up a hand.  "Leave him!"
it--  I'll take it. I'll take it." Steve panted. "I'll be good. P-please...."
At home, Tony shuddered suddenly.
Just as hunger made food taste better, his brief foray as HYDRA's captive had made him appreciate his freedom.  Or at least, what passed for freedom.  He still had the ankle monitor that SHIELD had put on him.
The feeling of Tony filling him up with hot spent was almost enough to tug Steve over the edge. He wrapped a hand around his own dick and stroked twice before he came with a cry. Steve spilt over his hand and clenched around Tony's knot as he did so, dragging out even more seed into himself.
"I know, but I'm a renegade like that," said Tony breezily, pulling out his phone.  "I'm going to go make a quick call... can you make sure Steve doesn't--"
"You never struck me as a religious man," said Tiberius.
Tony's hips were rocking gently; he was sensitive, too sensitive, but he couldn't have stopped if he wanted to.  Steve's body was magnetic. He massaged the knot in and out of Steve's entrance, body shuddering with the intensity of the sensation.  Unlike Steve's heat on the plane, this one was not the slightest bit frustrating. They weren't separated and as long as they remained coupled Tony was perfectly content.  His brain was a simple flowchart with a simple question: was he fucking Steve? As long as the answer was yes, Tony was happy.
"Stark," repeated Clint.  "Just because you're not ready for kids now doesn't mean--"
Tony watched Pepper wrapping Steve's hand, heart aching for his omega.  Why did everyone he love always turn on him? What was it about him that made him so... unlikable?
Just why did Steve do that!
The colors weren’t what it would usually be. The grass wasn’t green, the sky wasn’t blue, and the people weren’t the many skin colors the world held. Just a deep pitch black. So the painting was more abstract Steve guessed.
Steve couldn’t even get that. He wasn’t enough.
Thor had messed up.
Tony eyes grew wide. He took the scarf from Thors hand, never looking Thor in the  eye. He couldn’t take his eyes off of the scarf, it was fixed, brand new. He couldn’t  believe it. Tony began to smile towards Thor.
Okay enough to survive the night.
No one in the Tower, as far as Thor knew, could sing. All he could do was wonder who held this magnificent voice, who singed with a airily grace. A type of grace that could rival some of Asgard’s vocalists.
They knew Tony didn’t sleep. Especially not in front of anyone. But here he was, sleeping peacefully. They all stared at his small body curled up into itself. He looked like a small black cat who was tired of spreading bad luck all the time. Tony looked years younger in his sleep, when their wasn’t something always on his mind.
Steve decided to move on. He came here to fix his iPad not to sneak. That was Natashas job.
We’ll see, Tony thought as he texted Happy telling him to come quickly. Pushing himself off the ground, he looked around the room noticing the glass still on the floor.
The words got caught in Tony’s throat.
Asking Jarvis wouldn’t be a problem.  Maybe it would help him feel better about his outbursts at Tony. Maybe it would justify that he was right in yelling at tony.
Tony was the burden of all burdens.
“I’m going to a press conference for 3 days in Australia. But I’ll call you every morning and night, okay.” Tony rushed. The news was delivered to Steve on the exact same day he was due to leave. Steve was little more than shocked, but accepted the quick kiss Tony gave him in the cheek and watched him hop into the car.
Tony already knew he was a mess; the pain wouldn’t hurt as much than making a mistake.
Thankfully, Pepper arrived before he called it.
“Then tell me why?”
Tony was oblivious.
Something that made them friends.
It was cute.
Steve sighed. Tony was still angry and well, Steve didn’t blame him. But if they could have one conversation, just one, were he could explain himself and not have Tony look at him like that- eyes full of disgust and hate- he would be thankful. Tony’s face towards him hadn’t changed in a week since the secret leaked out and those eyes spread across the team. Steve remembered the slap he received and the tears in Tony’s eyes. “How long have you had this?”
Soon breakfast was done and they had made a tray. They made their way to the living room but saw that Tony might not be eating breakfast this morning. He was clutching the blanket with his face scrunched up.
!  Where do you get off telling me what to do, anyway?  You're nothing but a spade who needs to be put in your place."
And then he felt a strange overwhelming need to cry. What would he have done if today hadn't happened? What would he and Tony done when they realised?
?" a voice responded.  "-how are you in my ear?"
"You think I don't already know he'd rather have you?!"
"Steve looks happier," Aria mumbled, eyes flickering up to the stage. (
"It's a pity the Winter Soldier's already left.  You just missed him. But I'm sure you two will get to catch up soon, especially if you insist on coming to us.  It's actually easier this way, really..."
Donner scoffed a little, then flinched like Rhodey might hit him, even though Rhodey hadn't moved.  After a moment, Donner blurted, "Steve doesn't have many omega friends, does he? He doesn't really know what he's doing." He turned the water bottle around in his hands.  "
"...all we know is that Barnes is alive.  There's no evidence he's the Winter Soldier.  Maybe HYDRA found him and they're keeping him somewhere and they've found a way to... I don't know.  Isn't that exactly what Fury said?  That if they found a way to exploit bonding, they'd do it in a heartbeat?  ...what are you going to do, Steve?"
But Tony soon became stiff. He looked around for Pepper but she was talking to a women, Clint thought was another CEO.
He wasn’t going to be scared. He was just going to walk and see where he would land. “I’m an Avenger, this is part of the job” Tony thought.   He would be okay as long as he kept moving.
“Always.”
It had to be.
Tony was just really insecure deep down. And Clint was going to have to at least try and open him up. Just a bit.
“You didn’t have to tell everybody.” He mumbled under his breath. Natashas eyes widened as she whispered a small ‘sorry’. The conversation left Tony’s love life and onto something else, but Tony was still left uncomfortable especially next to Steve. The perfect Steve who had a freckle above his right eye and a too sharp jawline with striking blue eyes. The man who couldn’t like Tony that was always reeking of motor oil and had too many scars to count. The Tony that glowed blue like a freak and had bags under his eyes. He sighed in defeat, knowing he could never measure up to Steve.
He was evil. Everyone knew he was evil. But he didn’t know why it hurt for it to be said out loud.
Tony looked up at Steve, starting to get nervous as he made eye contact. The room felt smaller as they began focused on one another.
Tony was perfectly fine alone. Perfectly fine alone in the lab where no one would find him and bug him about love. Steve wouldn’t find him there and bug him.
“You were not terrible, you sang greatly. You could even rival the singers Steven had shown me.” He argued as he sat down next to Tony.
That was nice. And he knew the rest of the Avengers couldn’t beat this. The contest was his.
It wasn’t fair.
They would be disgustingly happy in front of their team mates. They would be getting their morning coffee and starting the day. They couldn’t even do that together. It was night in Australia, while it was morning in New York. Another thing that was keeping them apart.
The blonde walked into the kitchen ready to cook a soup. He had been watching lots of cooking shows, so none of his food tasted bland like in the 40’s. He had learned the art of spices. But his mothers cooking was never bland, just completely different than today’s food. Although Steve was brought up poor, his mother made a way. He remembered the soup she would make for him every time he was sick, which was about every month. It was delicious. It was what he thought cured his illness, whatever it was at that moment.
He rode the elevator to Tony’s floor. The Captain has never been here before. He had only been in Tony’s room at the main floor, which was used when Tony was too lazy to make it to his floor after long lab binges. That room was kinda messy and didn’t have much of what makes up a room. It was more of a living room with a bed plopped in the middle of it.
Finding Steve’s room wasn’t very hard- Tony did map out the whole tower- but the darkness did make him a bit confused. Although it was better than that blinding white light. Way much better. One hand stayed on the wall, drawing tiny waves while the other wrapped around his stomach. God he still felt like he was going to be sick and he couldn’t shake that off. He could shake off the tears and the sobs and the tremors; but not the feeling like he was going to die.
Steve didn’t have as response- Tony was right. At the drop of Bucky’s name, Steve was gone not caring about the consequences. It never like that was with Tony. He ran away with Bucky, he didn’t even run after Tony - no matter how much Steve wanted to convince himself that he was tying to give Tony space, he knew the truth- Steve chose Bucky was more important.
But Tony had sent him off with those horrible words.
Those blue eyes were surprised, god Tony was surprised, but were also red and blotchy.
“You can tell me anything, you know.” But Steve didn’t get an answer and continued to drive. He heard the slight snores and sighed in defeat. He could talk to Tony about this later, when he was going to be able to remember it not when he would be too drunk to even remember his drinking.
But Tony’s pulled away fast, and Steve’s bliss was replaced with regret.
“Is that a yes?” Steve asked as he cuddled Tony, arms wrapped once again around the smaller mans waist. Suddenly Steve’s hands moved towards Tony’s stomach and began to tickle.
Tony was a complete contrast to Howard.
She turned the corner to two rooms. The one on the right was open and but she couldn’t see what was there and the other was closed. Naturally, she gravitated towards the closed door. Quietly she slipped in.
What the hell was happening? Tony didn’t even remember why he was here and now he’s being showered with warmth from the Captain. This- this was insane.
God he was a mess.
That was Tony’s room. And she wouldn’t tell a soul about this. It was secret and open. Natasha didn’t know if she would be coming back, but she would make sure no one knew about it. She would respect this boundary.
Yeah, this was mainly friendship business.
So they sat there, both telling stories of constellations they knew. Tony knew many and the story behind them, from Greek and Roman myths. Natasha told the Russian ones she knew in her childhood. It was very few good ones but it seemed that Tony didn’t care, he was just intent with something bloody as well as something sweet.
He felt like an asshole.
“Beautiful huh? I like how your thinking.” Steve immediately rolled his eyes, chuckling as he pulled away.
Tony had locked these feelings away long ago, and tried a friendship route, for he knew Steve would never actually want to date him. It- it wasn’t fair, his mind replied, it wasn’t fair how Steve could just walk in here and undo all his hard work. Tony couldn’t count how many times he had to fight his temptations to kiss the blonde. He couldn’t count how many times he had wanted to hold Steve’s hand but didn’t. Just for Steve to come and do that! It wasn’t fair!
It wasn’t a great feeling.
“I’m on my way.” Natasha heard, “I have to go. Family emergency, you know. I’ll call you a Uber, thanks for the date.”  The call ended.
“Well thanks. I bet your mother’s amazing and skilled if she taught you how to do this.”
“Everyones movie night choice. Since Bruce isn’t here, that’s four movies night for one of us to pick. Pretty good prize huh?” Clint answered with a smirk.
Steve entertained Tony with his day, the usual, until Tony’s breathing became deeper. Tony has fell asleep on him, again.  Just like the nigh before and the night before that. Steve whispered a goodnight and ended the call.
Ok, Steve thought, something clearly must be wrong. Tony enjoyed being the center of attention and was always talking. Now it sounded like he was afraid of his voice with how all he did was whisper. His voice was horse and quiet enough that if you didn’t look at Tony’s face, you would already know he had been crying. The man was so closed in tight into himself that Steve began to grow worried.
But Tony with red rimmed eyes and messy hair and tear stains on his cheeks. The mans face was red and distraught, clearing something was wrong. Something had to happened to make this man come to Steve’s door looking like this! Steve looked deep into the smaller mans eyes and saw some deep sadness. Tony didn’t deserve to be sad, Steve didn’t want him to be sad and show up to his door looking like this ever again.
Steve had broken his iPad for the third time this month. The screen was severally cracked and frozen, that this time he thought he broke it for good. So now he was trying to find Tony to fix it. And maybe get up on the score board, but who knows? They were all tied at the moment with 2 points each, after deciding to share one. His second point wasn’t one he was proud of and he needed to make it up, to himself, the team, and to Tony.
Clint could just feel the awkwardness vibrating off of Tony. It was overwhelming and weird on Stark.
“God Steve, I want you! I always wanted you. But I-” Tony basically yelled, taking a deep breath when he remembered we’re they where. “I’m not right for you.”
“How bout we get out of here and go to a burger joint?” Steve asked suddenly. Tony turned and looked the man in the eye, so seriously and earnest.
Steve moved towards the blanket and threw it over Tony. The man snuggled into the warmth the blanket brought, and Steve heart just about burst. Now he really looked like a cat.
The block shook slightly and dipped downward. Suddenly, a slit in the wall opened. It was only tiny enough for a tiny slim body, such as hers and Clint’s. And Tony’s.
Oh god, he was having a panic attack.
His phone rang with the daily good morning good night call. The screen read ‘baby boy’ and Steve smiled in remembrance. He changed it one morning when they woke up and Tony didn’t get a good morning kiss that day. What had somehow became a ritual that Steve failed notice. The man was quietly upset at Steve although not voicing it, but Steve could tell from the scrunched up nose every time Tony looked his way. It was silly but sweet that something as tiny as this got Tony all riled up. Steve remembered calling him needy, like a baby as he kissed around Tony’s neck that night. Tony denied it but since then it stuck. Tony was his baby boy forever.
“Yeah you look fine, honey. But we have to go now.” She reassured as she squeezed his hands.
“Why date when you can spend the night with me watching shitty TV and drinking?” She smiled as she snuggled close to man.
“Umm, hey Steve. Your prolly sleep right now but,” there was a pause as the voice breathed in, “Do you think you can come pick me up?”
“How about I draw us a bath, huh.” Steve ran his fingers down Tony’s arm, getting a light but firm grip on his wrist and started to pull the man off the couch. Tony face didn’t change, still that ongoing sadness the man had since that morning, but he stumbled towards Steve, fingers curling into a fist.
“For this?” Steve dug in his pocket, bringing out a tiny box that would be fully covered if his hand was in a fist. The box was dark navy blue, like the time they slept on the roof on a real clear night. The ring inside held tiny grey diamonds around the center and was silver. Steve knew Tony made the ring, it perfectly fit his finger and had a messy but neat writing of ‘Shellhead’ on the back , winghead must be on the other (Steve had no idea how Tony’s handwriting could be both messy and neat but it was and he loved it). The ring was perfect. Tony reached for the box, but Steve raised his arm upwards above Tony’s reach just in time.
They got off on Tony’s floor and Steve had to pick him bridal style before he tripped and hurt himself.
“But I thought- i thought we were going somewhere. . .” Tony spoke, his voice breaking. Trying was a waste of time - Tony knew it was- but he needed to know if that was Steve really thought since the beginning. Did he really hate him when the kissed that night at the gala or did he do something wrong. It was his fault either way, but knowing that it was just a part of him was better than thinking he made a mistake.
It was going to be okay. Steve knew Tony wasn’t going to stop risking his life but at least he won’t be doing it so often. That was good enough for Steve. He could survive with that. And now at least Steve could keep the blanket.
He was there for hours it seemed, messing around or rather destroying tech. Every time he came up from the lab for a snack or something, he would catch Steve staring. He didn’t even try to hide it, those piercing blue eyes making a whole in Tony’s back. It just made him squirmy under those eyes.
She needed to teach him that it wasn’t.
He ran out of the car to help the swaying man.
Yep, that was the story he was going with here.
“Hmm, well I guess that’s just what families do huh.”
It was snowing outside, as expected in New York in December, but quite nice to look out. Steve didn’t much care for cold and the chilling wind and the extra layers but he did enjoy snow. It was like the world was moving in slow motion, everyone just taking a second to appreciate it. It didn’t matter if he was watching it alone, Steve knew someone was watching it with him somewhere in the world.
The man pouring Tony's drink paused and the continued, saying nothing.
"You have no idea." The car started and Steve instantly felt nervous. How did he really know he could trust these people? He didn't.
old things too. His old uniform, his old clothes... even a few sketches. He hadn't asked for them back but they hadn't
Steve wasn't sure what they'd give Tony, either. Any tech they could give him would barely be able to rival Tony's own goddamn phone. The hamper was heavy when he was handed it. Wisdom gave them a toothy smile. "And congratulations, of course."
omega.
"Well.  I'll leave you be.  I suppose I'll see you both tomorrow, at the party.  ...Stark, you know it's not noon yet, don't you?"
See you in court, asshole!" spat Tony.  His hackles were spiking again.
"Uh-huh."  Gideon didn't seem convinced.  "Come along, Donner. It's not as if I don't have a telephone.  You can call your little friend when we get home."
"...you're gonna have to wear turtlenecks for a while," said Tony, cracking a sad grin.  He looked away again.  "...I don't know why you do this to me.  I've never... felt..."  He trailed off.  That was it, that was the problem.  Tony didn't like to feel things.  He liked to do things.  He liked to make things happen.  Intimacy scared the hell out of him.
Steve's eyes narrowed. "You couldn't handle me," he replied coolly and slammed his hotel room door a little louder than necessary when he walked inside.
"No, no, dude, it was 2002," said Lola. "Donny's twenty-six and he was bonded the day after his seventeen birthday, so it was 2002.  C'mon, Abby, you were there, it was the same year as the bonding--"
"Rachel Sunders,
"MOM!" shrieked Cooper suddenly.  "DAD SAID A BAD WORD!"
He sat up and tugging Steve's hips toward him.  "Ready for round two?" he asked, nudging Steve's entrance with his head.
Maria turned away, not wanting to witness this particular scene.  Being in SHIELD often meant seeing a side of people you'd rather not.
"Please. Tony. Tell me how to be good for you..." He pawed at his chest. "Please."
"...how many stars do you have on Yelp?" pressed Tony, stepping in front of Steve.
"I went off with Bucky because he was on his way to
"How do I know you're the real one?" Nate piped up.
"He hasn't noticed yet..."
"Well, first time for everything," said George after a moment.  "Champagne's a hell of a drink to start with, huh?"
From the living room, Phil was playing the Dave Matthews band at full volume, loud enough to make the orchid petals tremble.
"So you two, are you trying, or...?"
The sense of self-consciousness about Steve's build evaporated, forgotten, as Tony's senses explored his omega.  Steve's taste, his smell, the feel of his skin... all of it was overwhelming in the best possible way.  He let out a breathy groan into Steve's mouth, climbing into his lap, blanketing Steve's body with his own.
"You were a rat. He already knew. How?" Sam demanded, slamming his fist on the desk. The rest of them watched from outside for now.
But the blond was offering him something (information?) with no clear motive.  The soldier had not been ordered to kill him. He'd been ordered to take him alive and he had.  The objective was complete. He could not compromise the mission; the mission was over.
He'd leaped onto a car, then down, the shimmied up a fire escape using a dumpster as leverage.  He tore across the rooftop, trying to find the van, trying to follow Karpov.  He knew that for a while now, they had been talking about eliminating him.  But it never occurred to him that he might get Karpov eliminated, too.  Karpov was the one responsible for him.  Karpov was there when he was punished, when he was rewarded, when he gave mission reports, when he was given orders, everything.  Karpov was the one who occasionally brushed his hair from his eyes or told him his work was acceptable.  And now, because of him, they had grabbed him, shoved him into a van, and driven off with him.
"Whatever," said Tony dismissively.
Tony made his way down to the shop.  He had two goals in mind: one was to build a wire for Rhodey, and the other was continue his quest for modular, non-gantry armor.  The problem was a tricky one, because it wasn't good enough for it to just be modular, or just be non-gantry, no... it needed to come to him and attach to him, and that was the hard part.  If it weren't for the fact that the suit was supposed to assemble around him, then he might have already figured out the whole self-assembly part.
"Happy anniversary, Tony."
Steve gasped sweetly as Tony's knot stretched him, his eyes rolling back as he sank down on it. He trembled against his Alpha and moved in tandem with him, his thighs quivering a little as he rocked down onto his cock. It was from all the kicking and pushing off of walls; his body was actually
"They want to take him in," Sam said quietly, lowering the phone to his side. "If the Winter Soldier can control Steve like a puppet..."
"Except you thought Steve was just some run-of-the-mill personal assistant?" asked Irshad pointedly.
Or maybe he did. Maybe this Tony moving on and leaving Steve behind with the bond. It was painful but Alphas could do it. Omegas couldn't.
"As.... my omega?" asked Tony cautiously.  He wasn't yet ready to banish the idea that Steve had some ulterior motive, but if they came out as being paired... well, there was no reversing that. Everyone knew who Captain America was; everyone knew who Tony Stark was; the two of them being bonded would be a national headline.
cry in front of these people. He tried to think of something meaningful to say but nothing felt quite right.
look kind of familiar.  His face, anyway.  Tony was already scrolling through an index of omegas in his mind, trying to recall the face of every server and maid and busboy and valet and caddy he might have exchanged words with in the last week.  He was home for spring break and he'd interacted with a fair number of omegas at the club.  Over the last two years, zeroes had become a source of fascination for him.  Something about the way they smelled made him want to show off.  Case in point: he was rather glad that he wasn't wearing a shirt right now.
He passed the menu back and followed Steve's gaze around the pub.  Aside from the bartender, no one knew who they were (yet). It was nice, sitting here at the bar together, like they were a couple of regular nobodies.
"...'k," said Tony.  He let one of the techs lead him out a door and into a hallway.  It was long and narrow, but not as long or narrow as it had been in the simulation, and it wasn't snowing, either.  There were six people there.  Tony recognized Fury, Natasha, and Sam, but not the other three.  A man in a suit, a woman in tactical gear, and a third woman in business clothes, holding a clipboard.
