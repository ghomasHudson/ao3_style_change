Tiberius disappeared like a ghost; Tony had already gone between Steve's legs and was sucking on his dick, licking at him eagerly, one hand moving the toy inside of him.
Then Steve felt a wave of heat through out him and his legs gave way and he landed on the floor with a loud thud. Steve groaned, both at that and the shiver that drew up his spine. He felt his boxers growing wet and his member growing hard. Steve arched up off the floor and whined loudly. He could hear them talking outside- had someone just mentioned Captain America? Ha. No way. When Tony finally found out things would be interesting, wouldn't they? He might kill Steve.
And then he kissed him, Steve's hand braced against his chest.  Eyes closed, leaning forward to press their lips together, he let Bucky push his tongue into his mouth and he concentrated as hard as he could.
was wearing a collar, just for him, his knot throbbed again.  He was beginning to think that they were going to be stuck for longer than a half-hour, this time.
He saw Tony half awake in bed when he returned and slipped back under the covers, leaving a plate with the rest of the pastries on the bedside table. Steve curled back up next to him, not wanting to be anywhere else for the rest of the day and night. He'd figured they'd earned an almost 12 hour sleep in all honesty. The serum gave him so much energy. But when he crashed, he
bonded.  Come on, Tony, seriously.  That was just a recruitment tactic.  I mean, I'm flattered, but obviously, I'm with Bucky.  Sorry."
Aria was positively fuming, her hands curled up tightly in her lap. Whilst she was a beta, she understood in her own way. She'd been adopted by two omega women when she was just a toddler. She'd gotten a lot of shit for having two omega mothers at school and her parents had suffered even worse at work.
"Something like that," said Donner, then added, perhaps a little defensively, "Lots of omegas are blond."
"Oh, this, this is nothing, man; the second one broke the sound barrier."  Tony flung out an arm snatching up a car and swinging it around, batting two drones into oblivion.
Slowly, deliberately, he reached up to remove his faceplate to get a better look at the man.  He'd never seen the guy before in his life.
Tony was making a "vomiting" motion to Steve, but Donner seemed oblivious.  "Wait 'til I tell George and Banksy!" he exclaimed, making toward the door, a small spring in his step.
"About time you returned the favor, right?" Steve joked gently with a half smile and a shrug. He knew this was bad, and he wasn't really sure what to do about it.
Now he felt guilty, too.  Like he had no right to be upset, since it was Steve, not him, who had been force-bonded.
Tony got up and crossed the room.  He had boxes of Howard's notes stored away; most had never been opened.  He'd put them away back when it had been too painful to deal with and let it slip his mind, intentionally, because Tony's feelings about Howard were complicated and he'd rather not examine them.  But the promise of cracking open SHIELD's mysteries was too exciting to resist.
"I don't know," Steve admitted after he belatedly realised Tony was talking about Bucky. "I felt stuff. I have no idea what he felt, however. We never talked about it, but I don't think he did." Or, it was easier for Steve to feel that way. If Bucky felt
He tossed Steve's pills and the phone onto the side table, then wrapped himself around Steve, nosing and licking the back of his neck.  Steve's body was hot against his. Despite the bath, Steve smelled strongly of sex. Tony was partially hard but he was drifting off, his body having hit a limit.  He wondered how many people (specifically, older Alphas) died annually from trying to keep up with their omegas' heats.
it. I've never wanted it from anyone else." Maybe Peggy could have been his mate... if he'd lived. If they'd gotten to know each other outside the chaos of war. But that future was taken from them by HYDRA. And Peggy had grown up, lived a full, rich life without him. It had worked out in the end.  "I chose you and that's not changing. If you hadn't noticed already, I'm stubborn as hell. I know I'm impulsive, but I like to think I have good intentions," Steve breathed. "Ever since I can remember, all I ever wanted to do was the right thing. And I want to do the right thing by you.  ...and I don't mean to cause trouble." He blushed a little.
“Mom, he’s not a boy,” Tony complained, it was true, Steve was not a boy in anyway and neither was Tony, they were technically adults.
“Yes, that’s FRIDAY, she wasn’t my first A.I., though I don’t know why they all come out sassy,” he said shrugging his shoulders.
“I’m game,” Clint who had been sitting at the other end of the table messaging his kids answered them. “I’ll do it, I need to make amends for messing up my kids’ lives because I couldn’t let go enough to take care of them.”
“Steve,” he called out trying to say anything, but Steve was unrelenting, he could focus on more than one thing, he wasn’t a master tactician for nothing, but when he used it in the bedroom, Tony was sure that it would kill him because at that moment he couldn’t come. His body was buzzing, everything was too sensitive, he could feel one of Steve’s hands holding him up, while the other traced Tony’s other nipple, abusing the puckered flesh while Steve’s mouth bit down on the other, before giving it a lick.
“That’s very sweet of you,” his mother said smiling at all of them. “I’m glad that all of my children are happy.”
When I first started writing this arc of the story, I didn't really know how I was going to do this part, originally I was just going to start from the beginning.... until the plot bunnies told me to get to this point.
“I need to tell you man,” Bucky said pulling Steve out of his thoughts about the whole Tony problem currently taking over his brain. “I’m seriously in love, I didn’t know it until I saw her.”
That was how Tony met Steve’s parents, no questions about his family or who he really was, just Steve’s parents’ playful bickering, his brothers hovering, Peter being the only one really interested in Tony’s projects, but only because he was as smart as Tony was, Harley snickering, and Steve, poor Steve, just looked at them with a fond exasperated look on his face. This was a family that was so different from his own, but they had welcomed him into it no questions asked, all because Steve had brought him to the house.
“I still don’t understand why you gave up M.I.T. to go to some small school, but as long as you’re happy, I’ll let it slide. Even though we could have been roommates and all,” Rhodey was guilt tripping him, Tony knew this, though it was a joke it still felt like coming home.
Tony hadn’t been very shy, until his classmates started picking on him for being a smartass, which made him keep to himself more often than not. He found solace in a comic book character that had started being printed just a few years before he had been born. Captain America was a hero, he saved the world from Nazi’s and fought for the good guys, his alter ego was an artist, and he had a best friend too. Both him and Natasha had grown up loving the character, watching the cartoons, and once the movies had come out, they had watched them as well. It was from watching these that he had started writing, he had been around ten when this had started, Natasha helping him at first, until he had grown confident enough to write on his own. Though Nat, being his best friend and all, had been the one to constantly proof read all of his stories.
Tony was looking at him, his eyes wide and his mouth open, and Steve wasn’t sure why, but he kept telling the story of how the character came to be. “I had been weak as a baby, even in my mother’s womb, so he had created this character who had grown up sick, but got better because of some weird science, because you have to know that it’s weird there’s no way something like that was possible in real life, but anyway, he had wanted to give me hope growing up,” Steve sighed remembering everything, how painful it had been to breathe growing up until for some reason in High School, he started getting better. “I was a bit of a runt, and Bucky was one of my only friends, even in a house full of brothers.”
So, Tony declared them Kamala’s godparents, “If anything happens to her, I’m blaming them,” he said to Steve that night. After Carol had shown Kamala a particularly dangerous maneuver, that had Tony practically pulling out his own hair.
“Tired?” Steve asked him and all Tony could do was nod, honestly, he was too tired to deal with anything, but he also knew that he had to get a hold of Pepper, and his mother, and probably Rhodey if he had the strength. “You need me to call anyone?”
“Not necessarily, we have a lot of people here hell bent on revenge, but we won’t know what to look for without a scouting mission,” Tony said looking around at the group of people that he had helped gather while traveling the universe.
“I wanted to talk to the both of you about something,” Professor Coulson said, all the while Tony wondered what kind of character the man would be if he were in the Captain America comic books, probably someone who worked closely with Director Fury, it probably had something to do with the whole authority figure thing. “Mr. Stone,” Professor Coulson continued pulling Tony away from his thoughts about the comic books he read. “I read through your story, and it’s a fantastic piece of work,” Ty looked over at Tony with a wide smile on his face, as if he knew this was coming. “But I can’t help but see some similarities to Mr. Stark’s writing, almost as if he worked on this story as well.”
“Guys... I think it worked,” Scott said from across the room as he looked out at the small garden near the workshop, they all saw the birds which hadn’t been there before flying around.
“Just take this tunnel, it goes on for a few miles, but it lets you out far enough away that you can make it to wherever it is that you wish to go,” she said to them. “And take care of him mystery man.”
“Why the long face?” he said while rolling down the window, the trip home had taken longer than it should have, but that was because he had to deal with a cranky Morgan, who wasn’t happy that her fathers were going somewhere without her. She hung out with her sibling's way too much for Tony’s sake, well at that point anyway. “Let me guess, Lang turned into a baby.”
“I hope everything is okay,” Bruce said looking from Tony to Natasha, “I’ll go with you all, since it’s actually date night, I don’t really want to have Thor worry about me at the same time.”
“Yeah well now we have a Hulk, so it shouldn’t really matter,” he said, even though it wasn’t his fault that it had happened. Well except that he probably broke something when he was sent flying.
“Well, I thought that’s what we were doing,” Clint said, which was what they all thought that they were doing.
“There is that, plus he likes to write a lot, but I’m okay with that, it’s interesting to see him get excited over something, it’s like the who universe lit up just for him.”
“Yeah, whatever,” he said before walking away. He wasn’t going to stand there and listen to Natasha get on his case about his lack of skills when it came to dating, he had gotten by just fine in college and when he was in the army, so did they actually know.
“They’re good, really good, and you said that Tony was the one who created these, as fanfiction, but they would make an amazing comic run as well,” his father said, there were notes on the papers, but from what Steve could see they weren’t bad, his father normally made notes to change something here or there. “I wonder if Iron Man could be a woman or a man, it’s a real mystery if you think about it that way, they could really be anyone.”
“It’s fancy seeing you here too,” he said smiling at Steve, he couldn’t figure out why he felt shy all of a sudden. “I’m having lunch with my sister and my friend, but they don’t know how to order coffee so I need more and as strong as you can make it,” he told Steve sounding almost desperate. Although their relationship with had gotten a little better since they started talking it was never about anything important, or answering the questions that they had asked one another.
Taking over the bookstore from his Grandmother had been his dream, so when she had decided to move to warm climates, she had called Steve. Honestly, he wasn’t sure why she hadn’t done it sooner, he loved his Nana with everything in him, but he couldn’t understand why she hadn’t retired earlier. He had been going to school upstate near the army base that he had been stationed at and had finished up his degree in Art. He had been in the army for ten years and had made friends from all over the country, some of which had left the army for one reason or another, after he was done he had gone back to school, so there he was now in his thirties and the owner of his own store.
Now, with Tony asking him to the gala everything felt so surreal in a way, mainly because he was sure that Tony would have told him to leave and never see him again without letting him explain a single thing. All he could do was smile, because he had been ready to beg, but now he just wanted to scold Bucky and Nat for telling him to stay away when he should have at least tried sooner to talk to Tony.
“She really would, I think she trains with Nat when I’m not looking, but that’s only because Sharon wants to work in the FBI or something,” Tony said as they climbed up the three flights of stairs to the attic bedroom. “Jesus Rogers, why do you live all the way up here, are you trying to kill me.”
Instead of going to eat, he pulled a bottle of naked juice out of the mini fridge that Jarvis had given to him, “Master Thor said you would need it,” Jarvis had said before putting it in the car with the other one, because Nat had gotten one too. Tony started putting the padding on his bed, adding the really expensive pillow top to it and covering it all over again, before plopping down and smothering himself with his pillows. He hadn’t slept at all the night before, one he blamed on the new surroundings, and the fact that he had stayed up all night writing, but also because the bed was as thin as a board and felt like rocks had been placed in it. The first thing he had done in the morning was call an uber and ride off to the nearest mall, buying anything and everything he would need to be comfortable. Now it felt like heaven and he couldn’t be bothered to move for anyone.
Sometimes.... things happen that are beyond our control, and other times Steve has to stop Natasha from killing someone, even when Tony gets hurt in the process.
“I’m scared too,” Steve said to him, while running his hands up and down Tony’s back, it was something they did when one of them had a nightmare, something to remind them of the present.
“No, I didn’t, I was in the kitchen packing up some snacks, because as fun as a party was I would rather sit with you wherever you were and draw while you just talked about anything, I was getting ready to leave when Sharon cornered me.”
“Do you want to know what I’m thinking about?” Steve asked genuinely curious about what Tony himself was thinking. He really did love listening to him talk, whether it was about mathematics or about his stories, or even about himself no matter how much it pained to hear him talk about his past.
“Okay,” Tony said, but neither made an effort to move, both of them seeking comfort in each other’s arms just for that moment. Steve knew that a small trip, just to give them a reprieve, was all that was needed, and when they got back to work, they would find a way to help everyone recover.
“Nope... nope.... nuh uh,” Kamala said throwing her hands up. “I’m not getting another lecture for you, pops and his I’m disappointed in you face, which should be illegal in this house, was enough to keep me from taking the blame on anything, or doing anything.”
“I just got out of work, but we’ll take a nap and then get some food okay,” Steve said, and Tony nodded before snuggling into his chest. Steve hadn’t realized that he was tired until the warmth of Tony against him lulled him to sleep.
“It’s a lot to take in, especially after the past couple of weeks,” the roller coaster of him and Steve getting together, Ty using him not only for help with his story but to also further his family’s standing, being alone on Thanksgiving even though Rhodey, Pepper, and May came to visit.
Tony put his hands-on Steve’s face, it was cold to the touch, but it felt real, “This was the first time I made a decision for myself, and you became a part of that.”
“What was Coulson thinking when he was designing that I have no idea,” Tony said smiling, “It’s ridiculous.”
“Well that’s both interesting and complicated at the same time,” he said thinking about Vision’s still form in the next room. “My first A.I. was named Jarvis, after someone I dearly cared about, the man practically raised me, he was a wonderful man and if I could I would say that he was as close to a father figure then my own father was.”
“Okay,” Bruce said motioning towards Hope. “When I say kill the power to the tunnel, you kill the power.”
Now I'm going to go cry for a while, because I had to write this entire chapter and it hurt my soul.
“I like that there’s a possibility that I can look at them and the person I like would be looking at the same stars as I am, that we could live under the same sky and one day find each other.”
“Airforce, we need an assist here,” Steve called out, bringing Tony’s attention back to Peter, but before he could do anything, he saw Carol take the gauntlet from him and with the help of all of the women, as she rushes forward to get the thing to where Scott was, the van fired up and ready. Tony works his way towards where they’re fighting, trying to find a way to help Carol, but Thanos got to her, and as powerful as she was, she the gauntlet was hindering what she could do. He was looking over to where everyone else was trying to figure out if anyone was close enough to stop it, but then he saw Strange, as he raised up one finger at no one else but Tony and he knew that this was it, this was the moment Strange had been talking about.
Sighing Tony stood up from where he was and pulled Steve along with him. They walked into the workshop and closed the door, sealing them inside so that the kids wouldn’t be able to eavesdrop on them.
There was something about watching the Avengers work, they were still only half of a team, Rhodes was off getting Clint, Nebula, Rocket and Carol were all on their way, Thor and Valkyrie were driving down, Bruce had told him that Thor had taken the last fight horribly and they had been trying with him.
“Well. That'll be easy to remember,” his father said and Tony was about ten seconds from muttering the words
guy from the WSC, Alexander Pierce, who called the meetings in the first place?  I'm worried Steve. Really worried and--"
Tony still hadn't stirred, probably because he hadn't slept since they'd told him Steve was missing.  After four days awake and much of it in the suit, Tony probably wouldn't have woken if Fury had kicked the legs out from under his chair.  The room was still dark, but under his shirt, the arc reactor was providing some dim blue mood lightning that etched every deep crease and scar on Fury's face.
"Tony--" He was struggling to get the words out. It was so hard to say it. It was so very, very wrong.
Pietro was used to Alphas talking about omegas like this, like they were unruly children, and aside from a mild sense of irritation, it didn't really affect him much.  He was more interested in Bucky's reaction. He'd heard the clip of Steve saying he was force-bonded at least a half-dozen times; it was splashed all over the headlines.  And he couldn't get the image of his head of the wall, smeared with blood, the one where Steve had written, bold and sharp:
I've already kind of got enough battery byproducts in my body, though, thanks," said Tony, touching the arc reactor on his chest with a metallic tap.  "So, you want to inject me with lithium and I'm supposed to trust you because you, what, you're connoisseurs of my father's work?  Which explains this fucking Kombayah-singing dream team of Alphas and omegas, all working together in harmony, doesn't it?  Listen, none of you knew my father, but--"
Also, Steve wasn't entirely sure what a music video was.  A YouTube thing?  YouTube had been far too random and flashy for Steve's tastes and, during the month he'd spent on base with his tablet, he had preferred to digest news from sites with simple, print formats.
"I spoke to your friend earlier. Natasha?" Pepper offered. "She tried to explain...everything." She gestured with her hands, smiling awkwardly. How was she supposed to be normal in front of Captain America? She'd been bossing him about for two weeks and now suddenly...now his presence was almost intimidating. A man so significant in history was now pacing around in a trashed living room and looking to Pepper for answers. For reassurance. "...Tony isn't in a good place right now."
The chuckle on the other line was low and breathy.  "I hope you are ready, Stark.  I am.  Have been ready for many, many years."
By the time Tony was a teenager, any fondness he'd felt toward his father had evaporated in a furious rage at not being good enough.  Tony was as purposefully difficult as possible, locking himself in his room to play Black Sabbath's "War Pigs" on an electric guitar that he'd amp up to the full volume.  Howard suffered frequent "headaches" that Tony knew were hangovers, and the two of them spoke mostly through shouting over the music while Maria and Jarvis tried to calm them down.
Steve winced a little when they introduced him, proudly, as America's only genetically enhanced super-soldier.  Steve didn't really think he should get credit for the enhanced thing. He was just the test subject, really. He'd just had to sit there. But he kept his thoughts to himself.
Tony had to have him.  He ached for him.  Steve's smell had some intrinsic property that no smell ever had before, something that triggered an unidentifiable emotion in Tony.  It was the emotion you felt when you suddenly found the puzzle piece you were looking for and clicked it into place.  It was the emotion Tony got when he walked into his shop late at night and inhaled the smell of oil and grease and gasoline and suddenly knew, in an instant, how to solve a complex problem he'd been working on all week.  It was the emotion you got when you were anticipating a good meal and suddenly spotted the waiter bringing your food.  It was something that was by no means rare but was nonetheless treasured, special: the first snowflake of the season.  The sound of rain on the windowpanes.  The feeling of ocean air coursing through Tony's hair on a coastal drive with the top down.  It was at once familiar and breathtaking.
to do right?" He said and went to grab some tissue paper. When Tony turned around Steve stepped up to dab at his lip gently, frowning when he saw the small but deep damage Justin's teeth had done.
He went back to eating, checking his phone briefly to see if they were about to start trending again.  Part of him was annoyed by the lack of privacy they were being given, but another part of him saw it as inevitable.  They were in a public place, after all, on the very last bit of their honeymoon.  Everyone knew what people did during the honeymoon period; it wasn't really that much of a stretch to suspect that Tony had knocked him up.  Especially considering his drink order.
His ma had just gotten him a set of colored pencils for his 18th birthday. She'd had to save up for so long. He'd loved them.  They were really good ones, the kind a real artist would--
Steve lightly grabbed his arm before he could slip away entirely, not tight enough to hurt. He stepped closer to him, staring down at Donner's nervous face. "If you ever feel like Gideon isn't taking good care of you, or you don't want to be with me anymore, you come to me - and I'll get you out, okay? I'll get you out." Donner frowned, suddenly looking confused.
"...no," he admitted, leaning on Steve.  He didn't want to leave his omega alone. "Just... tell her to send something up with the doctor."  He reached over to place his hand on the back of Steve's neck, to stroke the bonding mark there.
Honestly speaking he hadn’t known that when the semester had started that he would have found Tony, it had been luck on his part that Bucky would get to be Tony’s roommate. This what destiny felt like, a moment of pure coincidence that brought something special into his life. He had barely slept the whole weekend, reading as much as he could, before starting on a brand-new sketchbook. Drawings of Iron Man and Captain America, the whole team as Tony saw it, and in the end, the last few pages it had all turned into drawings of Tony as Steve saw him, right before he fell asleep on the bed, the sketchbook in his arms.
“Oh god that was real,” he said as the memory of Steve staying with him came back. All of the things he had said, he really should have had a muzzle on his face.
“We were bored,” he said with a shrug. “It happens, but now... Steve now, it really doesn’t matter does it, because you want to do this whole time-heist thing.”
Steve didn’t pressure him to go back to the Avengers facility, he didn’t pressure Tony to be Iron Man, all Steve did was work through his own pain and his own guilt, while also making sure that Tony was alright after a panic attack or on days where Tony was too far into his own head that he needed to get out. So, as the first year went on and they got closer, they had also found a way to work together on their little project, not that fixing a house was a little project, not with Tony involved. They did other things, Tony learned to cook while Steve learned to bake, everything was fifty/fifty, they talked and watched movies, but most of all they learned to move forward together.
“Don’t blame me,” Bucky answered before kissing Natasha on her cheek. “The moment she heard that you,” he pointed at Tony before pointing at Steve, “had met his parents, it was all over, she wanted to meet mine and then we just made our way over here afterwards.”
Tony made his way back to the table, only to find it empty, with a little note from Nat saying that she’ll talk to him later, with a little angry emoji on it. So, that meant that they were going to figure out what the deal was with Bucky, or she was angry at him about not telling her about Bucky being his roommate. It didn’t matter, instead Tony picked up his stuff and walked out into the cold November chill, the coffee keeping him warm as he walked all the way back to campus, but he really couldn’t complain, with Steve’s coffee concoction in his hand.
Tony wasn't sure how to respond to Steve's talk about the tesseract being "toxic."  It was just an object.  Objects couldn't be cursed, or evil, not in Tony's mind.  But he didn't dare disagree with Steve while Steve was curled into him, shaking and vulnerable.
"The coffee will be ready if people want it," Laura said. "Cooper! Cooper, why don't you let the grown ups have someone alone time for a minute?"
A man stepped forward and Steve's vision just managed to focus on him. "How do you know it's him?" he asked, peering at Steve. Steve saw the HYDRA emblem on his uniform and bared his teeth.
"Uh, no," said Tony, pulling up a long string of noodles with the chopsticks.  "I had a cup of coffee earlier, remember?  ...Happy, put on the radio.  The Steve Rogers story is still big and I want to keep on top of that.  Also, once were in the air, call Associated Press and let them know I'll be at the Expo."
The first day would be Steve's most demanding. Then his body would slow down a little, although only a little. And by the last he would be sore and tired and spend most of it sleeping, thank God. Of course, Steve had never experienced this properly before but he'd read a lot about it. And Clint, being the sweetheart he was, had written him a quick guide to heats, a pamphlet he'd snagged at a doctor's office that looked like it was geared toward teens. Not that Steve was really thinking about anything aside from Tony's dick inside of him right that moment.
He let out a long, slow exhale.  It would be easy to just say okay, and go and do it, but... he could feel Steve's heart tugging.
DeSoto tore over to Steve and stopped in front of him, hands up, a look of apology on his face.  His eye was swelling up from his earlier fight. "Hey... hey man. Stop. Please. I really, really don't want to fight you... you're gonna get us in trouble... please."  He was speaking softly, so no one could hear him aside from Steve. His expression was one of pleading. Unable to say no to his Alpha, it was clear he would fight Steve if Steve tried to go any further, but that he was well-aware he was going to get beaten to a pulp.  "
Tony looked up sharply, worriedly.  "But... but my brain is safe, right?  It's Steve's that's--" His voice cracked and everyone pretended not to notice.  "--that's bonded to-- him. And I'm a genius, doesn't that make my brain less... less vulnerable?"
Tony had just called him the 'best omega in the world' but everything else hurt too much to even register it.
"And I thought maybe... maybe he was still alive. But that man I met in there wasn't Bucky. I don't know what he was, but Bucky, the Bucky
Hal let out a ragged breath. Everyone was staring her, including a few bonded omegas around the pen. Clearly that kind of outburst was inappropriate.
Natasha looked between Tony and Steve with an amused glint in her eyes. She sauntered forward, hands on her hips, ever bit the confident Alpha and nothing less. She turned to Steve. "Симпатичный жакет."
"JARVIS, I need you to scan anything that comes into this house for EM signals," called Tony.  "If anyone's trying to bug this place, I want to know about it."
His dander rose immediately and he growled softly under his breath, ready to fight to protect his omega from any potential threat.
Tony pressed himself against the one-way glass, watching Steve lying there in the chair, eyes closed.  Since the last time he'd been here, someone had wiped away the blood from the glass.
Steve drew back so only the head rested in his mouth and then began to slowly move back and forth, doing what felt natural as his cheeks hollowed out every time he drew off. He followed Tony's cues. What made him moan and squirm, what made him tug at Steve's hair. It was almost thrilling to feel in charge for once instead of him being the one begging and panting.
Pietro stared at the television, face unreadable.  "...James," he said quietly. "...turn that garbage off."
"All bad I hope," Stone smiled. "I heard you're intending to auction all these off? What a clever thing to do. Bet you can't wait to get rid of them."
He fumbled with the door handle and slipped out of the lab, into the hall.  It was dimly lit, impossibly long and narrow.  Tony couldn't breathe; he was gasping for breath but he still felt like he was drowning, like an invisible hand had a vice grip on his neck.
"I want you to stop touching me," Steve managed to grit out. It was confusing. It felt nice. And he liked it. Steve wanted to lean into the touch, wanted to nose against Brock's neck. But it wasn't right. He wasn't Tony. He was just the closest Alpha to him and he was speaking softly and kept touching him. Steve's breathing was a little elevated and he was stressed.
Clint realized he was breathing heavily into the phone and hadn't heard what Steve had said.  "Is he alive?" he repeated, firmer. "Is he... is he... okay? Where are you? Are you sure?"
"Don't fight. Not here." And there he was. An omega bossing two Alphas around. The essence of the Avengers Initiative right there. Jeez. Tony would never follow his orders...would he?
Tony reached up to rub the back of his neck.  It was prickling. He could feel the scar there.  Honestly, the idea of Tony being bonded to any omega, let alone one as desirable as Steve, was laughable.  Tony was barely a real Alpha. Real Alphas fought for their omegas, but everyone had pleasantly agreed Bucky would murder him, not realizing how much it pained him to hear over and over that he was the loser, that his claim to Steve was only artificial, that he couldn't be expected to protect his own omega.  But of course. Steve knew all his dirty secrets, Pepper probably did too. Steve knew what these little scars meant, what each one represented: Tony's failure as an Alpha, his being used as an omega. He'd never counted them, feeling like this act of protest somehow made it better. But it didn't. Once was enough to ruin him, to prove his Alpha-hood was nothing more than a genetic fluke and that he wasn't the slightest bit dominant, that he couldn't even protect himself, let alone an omega.
"Because I'm going to ask why the first thing you saw was Bucky Barnes." Natasha's words were flat and matter-of-fact, but there was a strange sort of sadness in her eyes. She didn't
Tony took a deep breath and dragged his hand through his hair.  "Let me start over.  ...this isn't about Pepper.  It's about... me.  About me being an Alpha.  Just... let me explain my thing, okay?"
"That we can't consent! Yes, that's a big one. That's garbage." Steve said, slowly eating the newly delivered grapes. He'd written a list of important things to bring up because he knew he'd need a mental list. Right now all he really wanted to think or talk about was sex. And he wasn't supposed to do that... why, exactly?
Steve choked on his water, attracting a view curious gazes from around. Jesus Christ. Were these people living in the dark ages? If your omega wasn't aroused then surely you were doing more than a few things wrong! But then, if a lot of partnerships were via force bonding...then maybe the omegas weren't really attracted their mates. The selection process seemed grim anyway; surely personality should come before the chance of siring an Alpha? But then Steve thought back to all of their omegas he'd met so far, most of them terrifyingly empty of both character and gumption.
A woman appeared behind Ji-Yoo and she was striking. She was tall, with bright red hair that fell way past her shoulders. She was in a red dress to match and the way her dark eyes moved across the table to land on Steve made him feel almost intimidated. She gave off a Peggy sort of vibe, the 'I'm going to eat you alive' one.
"I'm gonna teach you how to fight. Or at least, avoid getting black eyes," Steve said and opened the door, holding it for DeSoto. "Sorry, I feel like I should ask, is DeSoto your real name?"
Being filled up with Tony's cum and having him knot him had felt fantastic. But this wasn't. This was stressful. Steve didn't understand what their bodies were doing. He just knew that Tony was distressed and it was because of him and Steve almost felt guilty for that. He knew he would still do just about anything Tony asked of him.
Steve sighed. He hoped that they filmed the auction later. He'd like what he had planned to be photographed, or filmed, or at least preserved in some way. He wanted proof that they'd done some good here. He didn't want it to look like they were being polite or playing along for the whole thing. It felt too...complicit.  He wanted the world to see and understand that, if Steve Rogers ever appeared complicit, it was only part of a greater ruse.
"Tony!  Tony, stop!  Stop!" shrieked Sam, trying to get away.  He managed to kick Tony off him and back into a corner of the room, hands up, shoulders hunched, eyes down.
Tony eased back a little, taking a moment just to admire Steve, his forearms and head down, his body smooth and well-proportioned.  Unimaginably fit and also unmistakably omega. Or maybe that was just Tony smelling him. Pheromones had a pretty extreme effect on a person's perception, if they were statused, anyway.  A beta probably wouldn't have been able to tell, would have assumed that those muscles meant Steve was a dominant Alpha, even though there was no real correlation between dominance and physical appearance.
“Thor,” Nebula called out without giving them the option to think about this further. She motioned for the god to join them, Rhodes walking in with bags of food, Carol behind him with several boxes of Pizza.
“Maybe, I mean I did think for a while that the two of you had a thing for one another,” Steve said starting the car and driving off. “I wasn’t sure why he showed up all of a sudden, and the sweater was something that I wanted to give to you, but later, I hadn’t known that you would try and have another one on.”
“The thing is, and I know it’s weird, but I honestly think that she’s it for me,” Bucky said as he leaned back on his bed while messing with the metal band on his wrist, the five-pointed red star in the middle reminded Tony of the Winter Soldier in the comic books. “I know we’re young, but I feel a connection to her that I’ve never felt before.”
“I did use you to help me study, but again that was under the pretense of spending more time with you.”
There were only two people that came to mind for Steve, one was currently in New Asgard, the other was at home blissfully unaware of what was happening. Steve wasn’t sure if he wanted Tony to know about this, their lives had been good for the last few years, and the thought of losing it all and reliving so much of what had happened scared him. But he also knew that he needed to speak with his husband, they needed to figure this out, because there was always one thing that he thought about over the years and that was the question of their kids. About whether life would have been a lot better if they hadn’t lost their families, he didn’t want to lose them, but if he could give them their families back, he would in a heartbeat.
“For now, let’s take care of the Thanos problem, we’ll figure out the rest as we go,” Steve said before touching the side of Tony’s face. “Don’t die on me today.”
“So,” she said, and he knew that she was all confidence at this moment, which would only hurt the moment he had to let her down again. “I was thinking that maybe, we could talk about us.”
He had spent his whole life in New York, the only time he had left was to go to M.I.T. to get his degrees, and when that had been done, he had promptly come back. There was something about the crazy nature of the city that appealed to him, even when his one favorite spot as a kid had been a local bookstore that was run by this little old grandmother. He had hidden in there for years while in high school, and when her grandson had come to help, he had stayed hidden. It wasn’t that he was shy or anything, and maybe he had harbored a crush for the blonde, but that hadn’t mattered, he had been twelve and on his way to graduating high school.
It was slow work tying Steve’s arms to the headboard, before securing his legs to the pillow, if there was one thing that Tony had been grateful for it was the fact that after the serum Steve had become a very heavy sleeper, the only time he didn’t sleep well was when he had nightmares, or when he was on missions because he would be on high alert. But, in the comfort and safety of their own home Steve slept soundly, or at least that’s what Tony would like to think. He was never sure if Steve told him that just to keep him in the dark so that whenever he wanted to jump on Tony, he could do it without Tony being aware of it. Not that he minded that either. Luckily for Tony, he finished up with the restraints just as Steve began to stir.
“Are you done?” he asked before taking the last of the Juice Pop and putting it in his own mouth. “Yeah, now you are,” he pushed her head down onto her pillow. “That face goes there,” he said smiling. He really loved his kids, even now he still went into the others rooms and kissed them goodnight.
“Hey Stevie,” Bucky said as he reached the room. “Why are you sitting out here, I gave you the key so that you wouldn’t have to.”
“You’re repeating yourseld,” Scott said and all Steve could think was that he was trapped in a fight between his kids/ “You’re repeating yourself. - No! - Come on. You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist.”
Rhodes left the room, the fading crunching sound of glass was the only indicator that the man had been there in the first place. Steve sat on the ground thinking about what the man had said, about where his heart was telling him to go, all he knew was that he wanted to be there with Tony. He thought back to that first real conversation that they had had when Tony had gotten back to earth, about how good it felt just to banter about some inane thing like how they looked.
"Now what nothing!" snapped Karpov.  "He knows we're after him now.  It's back to the drawing board.  We can't use the asset a second time.  Too risky."
While Phil and Steve had slipped off to speak, in Steve's room, Tony had given up on glasses and drank straight from the decanter.  The head of RAID was smoking and it turned Tony's stomach.  His French was limited to getting deals made and women in bed (it was the language of love, after all) and he didn't have the vocabulary to explain what had happened.  Even if he had he wasn't really sure.
Steve knew he had time to get about five hours sleep. So he did. He would need it and then, he would be ready for them. Steve had been ready for this for a long time and now he had nothing else to lose, did he? Tony didn't want him. If he died, oh well. Who would care? America would, but fuck America. That country hadn't done shit for him as an omega.
Turned out drunk, celebrating Tony was a lot more cheery drunk, dying Tony. Steve always associated his mate's drinking with a depressive state, like his birthday party. But this was different. Tony was hyper and happy, his eyes lit up, and Steve couldn't even be mad at him. The simulation had been a horror show. Steve knew he wanted to drink too after his, probably would have if he could have.
“Well I’m Howard Stark,” his father looked at him curiously. “You look a little green around the gills there, Potts.”
“Steve,” he pleaded, he just wanted to come, hell he wanted to feel Steve come inside of him. “please,” the word was so soft that even he missed it and he was the one who said it.
If there was anything that Steve knew for certain, it was that Tony liked coffee which was good since Steve worked at Starbucks and could make all kinds of drinks. He had seen the bill that Tony had dropped in the tip jar and had to make sure that he had been the one to get it, though he wasn’t sure what it said, and he didn’t want to check either, it was all ones and zeros and nothing else. But it was something that Tony had written and put there for Steve to see, so he wanted to make sure that he was the one who got it and not one of his coworkers.
“There’s no us Sharon, I told you last semester,” he told her for what felt like the millionth time in his mind.
“Yeah except when he wiped half of everything, he created an unbalanced universe instead of a balanced one,” Carol said looking at them all, it made Tony wonder just how long he had been in that bed because she wasn’t wearing that red, blue and gold outfit that he had first seen her in.
“Where could we all go that won’t kill our budget,” May asked as she took Tony’s Orange Chicken from him and threw it on her plate before he could get it back.
“Thank you, Professor Coulson,” Tony said before turning the full force of that smile on Steve, and honestly there was no better present in the world than a happy boyfriend.
“Okay, we’ll go out this week, just you and me, get to know each other better too, maybe next weekend I could take you to meet my parents and you can talk to my dad about Iron Man.”
There was a painful look on Lila’s face, the same look Tony had always had when his father ignored him growing up. He knew what it was to have a parent who wasn’t there, it was one of the reasons he had been okay with the kids spending so much time at his house. When he looked at Clint, the man looked as if she had hit him, even though she hadn’t, and Tony knew that it was because the severity of what he had done, more like what he hadn’t.
“Ah, well that’s cool, usually the freshmen are too intimidated to take an upper level class so soon, some think that it’s too much too soon, most of the advisors try to keep them away too,” the guy said before sticking his hand out. “I’m Ty,” he said to Tony that smile plastered on his face.
He knew what Tony was going to think about, the fact that he hadn’t been able to save the kid, and now that they couldn’t reverse it he also knew that they were all going to have to deal with the aftermath of what their separation had caused. Survivor’s guilt was something Steve was already suffering from, it had alleviated a little when Bucky had come back, but now he was certain, not just for himself but for all of them, that they were going to have to figure out how to move on from losing so much. He excused himself once the ship was in the air, hiding in the room that Tony had used as his workshop. He knew from the moment he stepped inside because Tony left little bits of himself there.
“Nothing, just that I may not have read Steve right, or maybe Steve hadn’t known my intentions, I don’t know,” why was he telling Bruce this, like he was some high school kid or something. “I have to go to S.I. but I’ll go with you to the bookstore later.”
“Because I want Wanda to have something to hope for, to have someone to come home to,” there it was, the truth he had been holding onto ever since the thought of bringing Vision back became an option. He had seen how Vision had changed in the two years since the so-called Civil War between them, how he had pinned over her, before leaving on trips to see her. Tony knew it was happening but he hadn’t stopped Vision from going, because he still blamed himself for things that had been out of his control. For her losing her family, first because of his weapons and then because of Ultron. He wanted to protect the world but sometimes all he brought was destruction and he needed to make amends for all of it.
With a nod the Hulk smashed a car, and jumped into the air to grab one of the Chitari flyers as they went by, taking him with it. “There he goes off on his own, it feels as if it were only yesterday when he was smashing the walls and bringing pain to his enemies,” Tony said as he watched him go.
“It’s a lot to think about,” he said to his husband. “We can’t mess it up or those timelines would be changed, like Bruce said their past would become our present, we don’t know just what we’re getting ourselves into.”
Peter and Harley rushed into the room, both disgusted at what they saw before running back out, his father jumped into action moving around to get their go bag and get his mother to the hospital. Steve’s car was in the way, so he tossed the keys to his father and made them take it instead, he grabbed his brothers and pushed them towards the mini-van just as Bucky walked over a smile on his face, dressed in a tux.
“Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead?” Thor said his speech clear even after consuming as much alcohol as he had. “We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.”
"Hey." Steve put a hand over Tony's. "The same goes to you. These Alphas will be jerks, and they'll actually be talking to you, and not me. So the same goes to you. If you want out. Just say so, and we'll go. None of these asshats are worth either of us getting upset over." Then he leaned over to kiss Tony's forehead, closing his eyes for brief moment.
. He already has a dumb name; it's not even a nice dog-- anyway. The point is, don't go make your nose even worse."
strange. He looked the same and yet, at the same time, entirely different. His face was more severe, sharper. All the boyishness had faded and a maturity was in its place. His hair was long and ragged, a state he never would have left it in before and his eyes- they were empty, like there was nothing behind them.
But having already done that once, in January, Tony couldn't bring himself to.  "Yeah," he called. He'd curled into the bed, still in his slacks and shirt. He'd at least taken off his shoes and jacket, and loosened his tie, but that was as much effort as he could be bothered to put into undressing.  He'd grabbed a bottle of scotch from the mini-bar in the room and curled under the comforter, suddenly aware of how frozen he was. Standing still for two hours outside had numbed his fingers and ears and nose; the snow in his hair got the pillow wet, so he threw it aside and grabbed a new one.
He let himself into the hotel suite with a nod to the bodyguards hanging out outside in the hallway, and stepped in.  He didn't immediately see Steve, and relief flooded him, following by guilt that he would be relieved not to see his mate.
Steve almost felt his cheeks heat up. "I've met some incredible people," he said. "Maybe there's potential...but it's hard to find someone who could handle dating...well, me. I mean, I'm ninety-two, it's weird, there's a big learning curve for me.  I still don't really understand how emojis work." That made Marcus laugh.
Tony stepped over the bodies of a couple of guards toward the nearest exit.  He'd come in through a ventilation shaft, but he slipped through a set of double doors onto a loading dock, which seemed faster.  The bay was empty except for a slick of oil on the concrete floor, and the door was open. Clearly, someone had just left. The base had been cleared in a hurry, and if Tony had thought about it, he would have known that this could only mean two things: that there was something very valuable worth protecting that had been there, and that there was probably some sort of self-destruction protocol in place.
me, Tony?!  After Monaco, after Malibu, after disappearing for two days, avoiding my calls, now you're
"I think it's infected," Gleason sighed. "It looks like the Winter Soldier doesn't brush his teeth. I'm going to have to take some swabs and then manually drain it."
His enthusiasm was infectious; he dragged everyone toward the fireplace and sat them down.  Aria and Phil opted for hot cocoa; Sitwell and Mackenzie both accepted Tony's offer of alcohol.
"I'll send you more formal invitations later today. All the suit and tie nonsense," Ellis said, sounding more familiar now Tony was in the conversation.  "I'll leave you to...
He didn't even realised he'd spoken until he'd said it. Steve was hardly aware anything but Tony right now.
The director blinked in surprise at Bucky, who usually didn't speak unless asked a direct question.  "Excuse me?"
Tony wasn't sure he'd ever really wanted to hold anyone before.  Oh, sure, he occasionally threw an arm around a girl after a particularly juicy conquest.  He'd let them curl up under his arm while he smoked.  (Back when he'd smoked; he'd quit after Afghanistan.)  But he'd never wanted to just
He looked down at Steve.  Steve was hard as a rock; Tony was half-hard himself, still pushing the dildo into Steve. Oh God, what the fuck was wrong with him.
"Right... back... atcha," gasped Tony, thrusting his hips against Steve.  Steve's fingers were on his scalp, his legs wrapped around Tony, and Tony shuddered with delight as he pushed into Steve, slowing a bit when he got to the base of the knot, letting Steve's body get used to the stretch.  He bit Steve's neck as he worked his hips, the warmth of arousal coursing through him; Steve's smell only enhanced it, and Tony relished the smoothness of his body, the minimal friction as his cock glided into Steve; Steve's body was so responsive to him, eager and soaking wet, and any misgivings he'd been feeling evaporated as he buried himself into his omega, feeling the other pulsing around his shaft.
He wanted to point out that the man who'd left Tony's scar was dead and how different that was. If he was still out there Steve would probably hunt him down himself, no matter how dangerous. But knowing that Tony had taken his own revenge calmed him considerably.
Tony's excitement had given way to a look of disgust.  "Why bother? He's got his other mate. I don't want this stupid bond anymore.  He'd rather have Bucky, anyway."
"...he doesn't know, does he?" said Natasha softly, eyes sliding across the room toward Tony.  He was sipping on his third drink, talking animatedly with Sam.
On the other side of the sidewalk, in the sand, Wanda was sitting under a palm tree, doing card tricks for a crowd of about a dozen people while Pietro and the soldier shared an ice cream cone.
rocket science.  He did not understand his omega.  He thought he had, but clearly he didn't.  He was bonded to a fucking stranger whose actions were unpredictable and capricious.
Another gaggle was coming over.  A man with dark skin who was wearing sunglasses approached, followed by two men behind him who were actually about as big as Steve was.  Their ringleader, with the sunglasses, was short and an omega, and with his Alpha entourage, he looked positively tiny. But he walked with a swagger that indicated he had no idea.
Tony put a foot on the nearest car and kicked it away, then reached out, scruffed Steve by the back of his shirt, and flung him away.  He hoped he hadn't been too rough but he didn't want Steve here.  Didn't want him to get hurt.  He hoped Steve had the sense to get up from where ever he had landed and get the hell away.
"...you looked good out there, too," said Tony softly.  "...I forget how strong you are.  All the time."  He sighed a little.
"I think we need to pay Jasper a visit," said Phil wearily.  "Either he's hiding something or he and Steve are a lot closer than we realized."
Tony squinted a little; he seemed lost in his own thoughts and didn't bother returning Steve's smile.  "Yeah, yeah, Trickshot came up.  Ron kept complaining about him. ...something about
Tony's teeth clenched.  Steve's hand on his arm sent an electrical jolt up his nerves; he yanked back.  "I'm fine," he snapped.  He didn't want Steve, of all people, to see him as weak.  Ironically, Steve's stabilizing hand had made his knees even weaker.  The effects Steve was having on Tony were disturbing.  Deeply disturbing.
"Oh, don't worry, they're not even three months old yet.  They can't crawl or even roll over," said Jeff.
"Cut!" yelled Aria and Maria at the same time.  "Steve, don't say you wear a collar in the bedroom--"
Steve's breathing was ragged; he grabbed Tony's hand and Tony cringed at how hard Steve's grip was.  Absolutely fucking crushing.  But he didn't shake him off; he'd rather have his hand broken than shake off his omega; after a few moments, Steve's grip loosened, anyway.
Pietro held up a lighter with a grin.  Bucky grinned back and got up. He felt stiff from sleeping on the floor; he stretched, the gears in his left arm whirring and clicking.
Steve shrugged. "If I have to make it post-heat, so be it. I'm not missing the birth. This is more important."
For some reason Steve had gone from manically happy to sad in a matter of seconds. Maybe it was because he couldn't get the box open. Yes. That must be it.
"I promised Sarah," he said in a low voice.  "I promised Sarah I would make sure he wouldn't get hurt."
He flung open the front door, then slammed it back shut.  "Fuck.  They're in the stairwells.  Carter!"
"It's no trouble.  But no vomiting in my car, alright?" said Joey pleasantly, wiping his knife off and placing it back into its sheath on his belt.  "Come on, I'm only a few blocks this way. You don't want to get on the tube looking like
"A few rags are saying it's staged.  Faked.  Obviously, betas wrote the articles," added Natasha, watching Tony pull up a few more news articles.  "Can't really fake a bond.  There's already shots of Steve's neck.  And Tony, you smell... well, bonded."
He had never, not in his whole life, or at least in his memory, been in a position to grant anyone anything.  It felt good.
"Steve.  Hey, Steve."  Tony put his phone away and reached out to grab Steve's hands.  "Look at me. Listen. ...you have absolutely no reason at all to feel ashamed or humiliated or guilty.  What happened to you was fucked up but it doesn't make you any less of the obnoxiously idealistic, courageous, selfless person that you are.  Stop trying to hide the mark. It's there and we're not going to act like we're ashamed of it, because we're not, okay? I already let the media come between me and you once before, and it was the worst fucking decision of my life, and it was what caused all this in the first place.  You walk in there with your head held high and do what you do best: be the bigger man. And I'll be right there beside you. As your secondary, considerably shorter, not-especially-dominant Alpha." Tony gave a self-depreciating grin. Despite having initially been joking, Tony suddenly realize he was dead serious.  "...let's go rattle some cages," he said firmly, and he led Steve back downstairs, feeling, for once, extremely dominant, actually.
Steve whined loudly when Tony bit down, a tremor running down his spine. The feeling was almost overwhelming and his cock twitched where it was curved against his thigh. His entrance clenched around Tony. Steve felt almost too hot, especially in all the clothes.
Tony grinned cheekily.  He could feel the bruising around his eye, tender as it was.  But he'd definitely had worse.
"What should we wear for the party?" Steve asked Pepper, finding her in the kitchen. She was drinking coffee and face timing Happy, and actually almost looked a little bit embarrassed at being caught.
It was easier to protest the exercise thing than to start panicking.  It was only July.  They had, what, five or six months to figure it out?
Steve's breath hitched as Tony's hand crept under his shirt. Fuck. "Tony, I want you. It's been too long, Tony-- I want you inside of me," he murmured, breath hot in his ear and hands squeezing at his shoulders as Tony's hands snuck under his shirt. His whole body was thrumming with excitement, with alcohol. Admittedly, Steve was surprised by how horny just being drunk was making him but he was in no real place to question it.
Both Mackenzie and Aria snorted, but Donner remained steadfast in his insistence.  The afternoon turned to evening, then to night, and still, with every contraction, Donner cried out but continued to maintain a firm level of positivism.
for Steve in the next week and another news outlet wanted a joint interview with Tony about both their experiences. The work they had to do on Project 84 now that the raid itself was over was only going to get busier, especially with the legal battle ahead of them. That night they ordered in take-away, insisting that Donner choose the cuisine (he eventually just went with pizza). They wanted to get him used to making choices, even if it was only small ones.
Tony left the water running and called the only person he could think of to answer his questions: David Gleason.
He let off two more rounds when he could, then there was more smoke and Tony gave up trying to hit anything.  He knew he'd gotten at least two and that Steve had taken down plenty. He heard an engine start, then cut.
"I'm not saying it's easy," murmured Steve, trying to deescalate the situation.  "I'm aware that letting your Allpha take care of you is easier, in a lot of ways. But life isn't about choosing the easy route. If it was, I wouldn't even be here. I wouldn't even be in this century. But sometimes you gotta do hard shit, you've got to be prepared to get dirty, to struggle. That's what real life is. Your Alpha shouldn't be a safety net. They should be your
"Well, I'm not coming with you!" Steve snapped, sounding determined. "You could be anyone. And I can't even goddamn see. I'm not coming with you."
Tony laughed suddenly, kissing Steve's throat and pulling away.  "Now, where's my coffee?  I wasn't kidding around with Fury, I really do need coffee- I'm like Garfield.  I hate mornings.  ...no, wait.  Mondays.  He hated Mondays.  Never mind.  Do you even know who Garfield is?  The cat that eats lasagna?  Not the president... never mind, Steve.  It's for the best.  Those comics aren't even funny.  So.  Coffee."  He gave Steve an encouraging slap on the ass.
"Steve?" he called gently, sliding open the glass door to the pool deck.  "...hey. You mind if I come out here with you?"
Tony's face twisted slightly.  "He wanted to," he said softly.  "He loved him. The only reason Barnes didn't take him was because he was too sick to handle it.  But now he's not, and Barnes is back, and in case you haven't noticed, I'm not exactly the most dominant Alpha in the world."
"Come on... let's just relax the rest of the day... forget the collar thing, Steve, it was stupid anyway..." said Tony.  Steve looked a lot calmer but Tony didn't care; as far as he was concerned, they were through looking at collars. It wasn't worth seeing his mate freaking out like this.
"Want me to take her?" Laura offered. Steve passed her over with a small smile before kneeling down beside Cooper so he could go through his favourite pokemon cards. He jabbed a finger at a purple monster named Gengar that was shiny and popping out of the card in 3D art.
-" Steve's breath hitched as Tony pressed inside of him, and his arms curled up on instinct to pull his Alpha closer, one leg hooking around him with his heel pressing into the small of his back. Steve let out a high-pitched please sound and let his head fall back against the sofa as he rocked back with him.
He slumped down, leaning his head against Tony's shoulder, the pose itself a startling reflection of the extent of his flexibility.
Marcus nodded and quickly moved on to the next topic of conversation. "So... you say you've been awake for almost five months now. You're still unbonded..."
He took a few deep breaths and then strutted out of his room and down the hall, taking the curving staircase slowly.  But the omegas were gone and the room smelled only like flowers.
"I just..." Steve looked up. "What situation was Bucky in, when you...left? It's been bugging me. That I didn't know that."
"Sirs.  Mr. Hogan is downstairs and would like to remind you that you are scheduled to depart in five minutes."
"Oh, they're just fighting," an omega to his right shrugged; he held a small glass of white wine. "Some Alphas like to make bets. I doubt they'll let someone like you fight..." He laughed, like he'd just made a joke.
The woman who'd pulled away from him earlier scoffed from Steve's left. She was in a scarlet dress, her black hair done up in tight curls. She looked good but the expression on her face was foul. Steve pulled away from her to go back to the friendlier group of omegas he'd left.
Steve let his fingers brush against Tony's as the other moved close. He really needed a shower after his run.
"We think that what you're doing in the US is amazing," he said enthusiastically.  (He was so enthusiastic Steve actually wondered if he might be close to preheat.)
"Jesus," Haley muttered. "I'm sure he's a good person, deep down, but that guy is an idiot. It's not his fault he's an idiot, but he's an idiot."
"Uh-huh, uh-huh," said Tony, rising and dusting his fingers off on his suit jacket.  "...but you rescheduled with those other guys, about the collars?"
"Why am I smelling coffee?" he asked, feeling a lot calmer.  The hair on his neck was finally flattening. Obviously due to Pepper's calming presence.
Bucky gritted his teeth a little and walked into the next room.  In his notebook, he flipped open to the page titled "TARGETS," and wrote down, "purple orchid, Stark's, Smithsonian."
Gail was talking and Tony felt like he was in a weird nightmare.  Maybe it was just the alcohol, but being in his underwear in a dark room surrounded by people more dominant than him and feeling helpless felt a
Steve stood there, seeing nothing but hurt in the other man’s eyes, and he didn’t know what he could do, he didn’t know how it had gotten this far so quickly, they had only been together one day, they hadn’t work towards anything, and now he was standing there once again fighting against Tony.
“No, sir. I'm, a... visitor from MIT,” he said knowing that his father wouldn’t really care too much about where he was from, what mattered was that he wouldn’t notice just how familiar he looked to the other man.
“Alright everyone,” the professor said as he walked in through the door, getting the classes attention Tony looking at the professor with an excited glee rushing through him. “My name is Professor Phil Coulson and welcome to Fiction Writing.”
“Go to the living area and stay there,” he told them knowing that Tony was going to have a fit about them all being there. “I need to talk to your father,” he looked at his kids knowing that while they loved them, they wanted to protect their parents as much as him and Tony wanted to protect them.
“The robotics lab,” Steve said his heart painfully breaking in his chest. “It’s the one place I’m sure that he would go, because it’s the one place we can’t really follow him.”
It was the train wreck that this was his life, he had worked on this and now someone was taking it away from him. Just like him and Steve had been close to being something and someone took that from him too. He couldn’t figure out where he had gone wrong with everything, or why this kept happening to him. Taking his laptop from Ty, he sent the story off to him, he didn’t care about it anymore, it would just be a reminder of something else that he thought he had with another person, someone he thought of as a friend, Ty could have it.
Steve couldn’t help but stiffen at the way she had said his name, “Now Pepper,” Tony said trying his best to give her puppy eyes, which didn’t faze the woman at all.
“Sorry,” he told him, knowing that he needed to understand this and figure out what to do that won’t send Tony running the other way.
“Hey! Holy cow. You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone,” Peter said but Tony couldn’t help but look at him in awe, even after all of these years the kid could babble on without any other thought. “But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, "It's been five years. Come on, they need us!" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time...”
That was until Steve climbed into the back of the ambulance and sat next to him, saying “Hi,” with a smile that could melt the freaking artic.
“I’ve never heard about this, why wasn’t it on the news,” Bucky said looking at him astonished, and well of course he would be, Tony didn’t really publicize himself because his family had money and people would always take advantage of that.
“Someone’s happy,” Natasha said to him as walked into the living room. “He’s injured Tony, so don’t work him too hard.”
“If it makes you feel more comfortable, I mean those parties are a little crazy, the press is everywhere, and most likely it could be our first date, plus you’re going to meet my family, I just don’t want you to be overwhelmed.”
“Oh, that limited edition Han Solo one, the one that had been made as mistake,” she said with that evil grin on her face, the one she normally got when she was either planning revenge or remembering what she had done. “Teaches him to do what he did.”
“Want to get some air?” Howard asked him and he thought sweet relief, he would be able to put some distance between the two of them if they went up top.
“Sure man,” Sam said just as Natasha walked over to him, Steve guessed that the police already knew her side of the story and were in the back with Thor.
“Yeah, she took it when Bucky and I were together,” he said feeling a little embarrassed about it. “I was hoping that she would take our picture and put it up there too.”
“I’m not good with the outdoors,” Tony said but he knew that with Steve no matter where they went it would have been perfect, it was silly things, like the dates that Bucky had told him about, they were the kind of things that he would love to do with Steve.
“Anyway, I thought I should come here and apologize for my picture posts,” Stark said and Steve knew that someone was messing with him, there was no way that Tony Stark actually came into the store. “Someone told me to stop being stupid and actually talk to you.”
“Well let’s finish this homework and then go to the party, I have to ask someone out on a date today, hopefully she’ll say yes,” Bucky said smiling at Tony as he said it, before going into the room.
“No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey...,” they all yelled at him, they needed to think about this, and Thor rushing into doing it wasn’t the best plan they had.
For Steve, he was afraid of what Tony would think, but he was also thinking about what it would mean for SHIELD to know that he was there, alive and in the flesh. He heard a whimpering noise come out of Tony but neither said a word. Peggy quickly closed the blinds, giving them privacy, but looking at both of them warily.
“That’s fine with me, less stress than what you three would have to do,” Bruce said before transforming into the Hulk. Tony still couldn’t get over the whole thing, even years later, watching Bruce change was an amazing thing to behold.
“Nah, it’s fine, I like this, I’ve never had someone so interested in what I write, or at least someone I know.”
Bucky spent the rest of the drive talking about his classes, Steve was an Art major with a double minor in Art History and World History, while Bucky had gone for a business major with a minor in psychology. They had one class together, a prereq that they hadn’t taken yet, in some advance mathematics class, but that was it. Steve parked the car and started unloading, still wondering why anyone named Stark would be at their school, though he had rumors over the summer that the two youngest in the Stark family were starting college in the fall, they had kept what school they were going to out of the papers, so it was entirely possible that one of them would have ended up at their school.
The machine was done right as Clint arrived wearing the suit, his hair pushed back, but they could all see the worried look on the guy’s face. They weren’t sure if any of this was going to work, and Clint getting stuck in the past, or wherever the machine left him was going to be horrible on so many levels. Everyone had come to the room to see if it would work, Shuri leaving her lab, Thor sitting in a corner with Nebula and Valkyrie, Carol standing next to Rhodey, while Tony stood next to Steve. Bruce at the machine adjusting everything they had worked on, while watching the people in the room.
They were walking down the hallway when he noticed Tony sitting in a corner near the stairs, as if he had been waiting for Steve to leave. Their eyes met and Steve was certain that if he could have asked the guy out, he would have, there was something drawing him towards Tony Stark, but he could also tell that he was making the guy uncomfortable. Maybe Steve would try and become friends first before trying anything else, since it was better to fix the small problem that he had caused before attempting anything else.
His phone ringing soon afterwards, reminding him that he had a morning shift at his job, “Fuck,” Steve said before grabbing his stuff. “I have to go or I’m going to be late,” he called out to Tony. “I’ll call you later so we can talk, or you can stop by the house tomorrow, we’re having an end of semester party.”
"What, you gonna get a new haircut?” Rocket said and Steve knew that this was going to diverge quickly into a fight if they weren’t careful/
“Go ahead,” Steve said smiling at him, which honestly was a little distracting for Tony, no one should have that kind of power just from smiling.
“Fine, but I have the right to ask you for the most expensive pair of shoes for Christmas,” she said pouting. “And a necklace for May.”
Once inside of the building, he pushed aside thoughts of Steve, Ty had told him that he would be working in the stacks, so Tony headed up and found an empty table towards the back. Even sitting there, he thought of Steve and had to try really hard to get the blonde out of his mind, there was no chance of that happening at all, not since he had heard about the girl, or even the fact of Bucky being his ex. He didn’t want to have something weird happening with his roommate.
“Uhh....” the guy said and Steve couldn’t help but feel like he’s seen him before, even as the brunette pushed his glasses up his face. “Are you my roommate?”
“Yeah well you kind of did,” Tony said sighing as he sat down on the same bench but far enough away from Steve that they weren’t touching. He wasn’t sure if he could touch Steve again and never stop.
He knew she was right about that, especially since the last time they had a huge fight it felt more like a divorce than anything, and they hadn’t been together at that time. Since then they built a family, rebuilt their lives and their relationship, losing Tony would be like being thrown seventy years in the future all over again, and he didn’t think that he could deal with that and survive.
“You’ll get it done,” Steve said before taking out the cookie cutters of the Avengers and all the bowls. “Now let's make some cookies.”
“We can take the Benatar,” Rocket said jumping off the table. “It’s can travel at light speed across the known universe.”
was created by comic book artist Joseph Rogers, Captain America was made as a gift towards his son who had been born within weeks of the first issue’s release. The character was named after Rogers’ son Steve, Rogers’ has said that he wanted his son to have someone to look up to, a hero who fought for everyone and stuck up for the little guy. Since its inception, Captain America, also known as Steve Rogers, has had over twenty volumes, and nearly 200 issues since its release. In the last ten years three movies have been released following the character’s journey as a man out of time in the new century. New characters have been introduced, including the ever-popular Spider-man, which has now started its own solo run. The Captain America serialization will end in May of 2020, Rogers states that he wants to give the hero a true and satisfying ending that would match his character and make his son proud.
“My mom wanted us to have normal lives,” especially after the last kidnapping. “Well as normal as a bunch of Stark kids could have, so it was kept out of the public, I actually wanted to have a mathematics major added but she told me to slow down, though I might still do it later on.”
“I think they’re just glad that you’re crazy enough to deal with him,” Steve said his voice had a hint of glee in it. “I love you Buck, but honestly you’re a little nuts.”
Rushing forward he grabbed the Titan’s hand, he had one shot at this, he had to save his family, he had to protect them because he couldn’t lose them again. “I’m sorry Steve,” he said as he pulled the stones off of the glove, just as Thanos pushed him away.
“Yeah, there’s a lot of soldiers out there looking for us, but I also saw my dad, which was something else entirely, he said he would do anything for me, and I knew he wasn’t, and as much as I wanted to yell at him about it,” Tony said without stopping, he was rambling and Steve loved it. “I didn’t, mainly because I saw Jarvis, the real Jarvis standing there, and I knew everything would be alright, I wouldn’t have the happy childhood or anything like that, but as long as Jarvis and his wife were there, I knew I would turn out alright.”
“Yeah but you did the one thing that no one could, think about it Tony, Steve hated Captain America with a passion since he was a kid, and seeing the good ole Captain from your perspective has changed that, his mother said that the person who fell in love with Steve would be able to love both parts of him and as much as Steve hates to say it, Captain America is just like him in so many ways.”
Bucky stared hopelessly at the array of spiral notebooks, unable to make a decision.  After a moment, he hesitantly pointed to the red one again.
Aria sighed and sent a sideways glance at Pepper as Steve followed Tony up towards the house. "I mean, he has a point. But the fact that there's no one doing damage control in there does terrify me a little."
, Steve.  Can you demonstrate this outrageous claim?  Because, if not, I'm going to have to assume you're just trying to impress me."
His blues eyes were glazed over and Steve looked distant. He certainly wasn't going to be with it for the interview but then he supposed that was the point.
Steve didn't really remember Howard being 'funny'. He made women around him laugh a lot. And Steve always laughed it off all the times he half came onto him...but he couldn't really remember him ever saying anything
"...I saw you that article you did in the Times," he said after a long, awkward silence.  "...funny stuff.  ...really 'ppreciate what you're doing for us out there.  Y'know.  ....
"He doesn't shake," said Lowenstein, swatting his hand down.  "Does Mr. Rogers have any representation yet?"
She moved, offering Emily her hand with a warm smile. The girl took it and let Jed lead her out of the tent, the flap falling shut as he bent down to check Tony's temperature. "You need water," he murmured and then tugged on Tony's arm, gently persuading him out from under the bed until his head was resting in Steve's lap. He ran his hands through his Alpha's hair and felt him tremble. His forehead was clammy. "I'm sorry," Steve whispered, feeling miserable as he stared at the sick on the floor. "I wish I could make it better."
"Yeah, at least one of 'em has the prototype for Cap's shield," said Tony, studying his nails, pretending not to care.  "Plus you've got all his notebooks, newsreels, other shit..  It's a good thing we're not operating under a deadline, huh, because it's going to take forever to go through all this." He grinned.  "...deadline.  Pun intended.  ...oh, lighten up, guys, you're not the one who's about to drop dead.  Come on, let's get this stuff back home... Grab a box..."
He practically shouted the other's name, hips stuttering as he came.  He grabbed Steve's ass, pulling him down with a strength he didn't know he possessed, wiggling into the omega, needing to empty his seed as deep as possible into him.
"...you know, you really ought to control him better," said Eric to Tony.  Even without their bond, Tony would have been able to tell at a glance that Steve was ready to lose it.
Tony woke with a start and sat bolt upright.  His bedroom was chilly.  He checked his wristwatch; it was past eight already.  March 15th, 1986.  A Saturday.  He climbed out of bed and went to look out the window.  Sure enough, a thin blanket of snow was lying over the backyard.  It must have snowed overnight.
He felt so stupid for asking permission.  Standing there in torn shop jeans and a rumpled wifebeater, no shoes, hair and goatee a mess... Tony felt
"They try and take away everything that makes you who you are," Ty said quietly. "But that's not what we came here to talk about today. Sorry. I shouldn't have-"
Steve knew that Peggy hadn't had any children of her own. She'd married an American beta man and had an omega woman by the name of Angie who had passed almost eight years ago now. Peggy seemed fine by herself, of course; she was managing. Peggy had always been fiercely independent.
Tony had quietly, discreetly, and rather guiltily looked up one of Frond's books: "The Omega Mind."  It had been shockingly informative. Frond--
He gave his tongue a wiggle, pressing against Steve's hole tempting, pushing at it, then going back to licking it; Steve's body shuddered with a suppressed desire to move back into Tony's tongue, to have something inside him.
"It's okay, Steve, I got you," he said softly, grabbing a bottle of water from under the bench and thrusting it into Steve's hands.  "You're okay, I'm here, it's all over, mission's over... you're okay, baby..." He would have given anything to take the suit off, but it was an impossibility.  And besides, even if he could have, he didn't trust himself, not one bit. He knew he would have killed Natasha earlier if she hadn't had Steve's shield. He wouldn't have even thought twice about it.  His stomach twisted a little; he hoped that didn't end up on the mission report. He didn't want to look like some sort of crazy Alpha that lost his damn mind over an omega in heat. But this was different, this was his mate...
Ton startled awake with a yell and a swing at Steve (who easily avoided it thanks to his reflexes).  It took Tony a moment to remember they were in Alabama, which was dry and hot and dusty and somewhere he'd really rather leave.
"We're not having sex in the shower Tony," Steve told him plainly. He gently leaned backwards and dropped Tony onto the bed once they were upstairs before starting up the shower. Tony's shower got warm so quickly that there was no need to wait for it, but Steve still stuck his hand under the spray to check the temperature out of habit. Then he went back to fetch Tony. He was already naked at least, so Steve didn't have to undress him.
But he remembered, longingly, how Steve had swept him up and carried him to bed at his birthday.  Had it only been yesterday?  It seemed like an eternity ago.
Tony closed his eyes and leaned into his seat, letting Steve drive.  He was trying not to think about the darker parts of his life, as if thinking about them might make them more likely to come out to haunt him later.
He found Steve in the kitchen, on round 2 of breakfast.  He walked up and wrapped his arms around him front behind.  Steve's neck looked much better. What had initially looked like a single mangled bite had resolved into two overlapping marks.  It wasn't as good as his own mark being untouched... but it was definitely far, far better than Barnes's mark replacing his entirely.
