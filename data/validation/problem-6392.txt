Clint whisper-yelled underneath them, but Tony could no longer see him, because Steve was sealing the hatch back again and looking at Tony. “He’s gone. We can’t help him. Now get shuffling, we have to make it to the next hatch before they do.”
“But if you ever feel like… not being on your own,” Clint shrugged, eyes shifting to Steve’s honestly.
He spat, and he heard Peggy telling him to calm down on the other side of the door, but he wasn’t having it, he
There was a mute nod, and when Tony stood up, he had to pull with all his weight to get Steve to follow. How Tony hadn’t noticed this sooner, he had no idea, but he wasn’t going to let it happen again. Steve was obviously completely exhausted, to the point where it was becoming
Steve shuffled. “I’ve always wanted one,” he blurted, “and I always will. I… I’m not sure how to say this, but—”
Clint nodded his head, waving the tickets again. “Okay, okay- to cut to the point; I saved their asses, they were very grateful but rather shaken up, so they decided to go home instead of watching their theater production, and BAM! Suddenly I’ve got six Hamilton Tickets, for free!”
His boots echoed on the hard floors of the compound that he walked through with the rest of the squad from the jet. They’d transferred Tony into the building’s holding cells a few minutes before everyone else on the jet dispatched, and now Steve was supposedly headed for Fury’s office to debrief. There, the Director would undoubtedly ask him a myriad of invasive and personal questions, to which Steve would answer dutifully and truly, and then later be dismissed, possibly with a promotion under his belt for his excellent work on the Iron Man case. Then he would go home to his messy apartment, alone, and fall asleep, alone, and then wake up, alone. Because that was what he did. That was always what he did.
Steve remained quiet, thinking about the fact that Thor pretty much always had an empty house ready for him and his guests. Thinking about how loud and obvious Thor always was; how he made friends with everyone and loved the attention that was given to him by them all. Because in reality, when Thor got home, it was to a vacant world. To the reality that his brother was off the rails and that his parents didn’t even care about it. They sent the money over for Thor to keep the apartment running and food in their stomachs, and that was the largest part they played in his or Loki’s life.
Bruce looked up. “You sure? I might just do some more checkups now that you’re a little more coherent, just to ch- oh, whoah, okay there lovebirds, I’m going, I’m going,” Bruce pulled a face and raised his hands, shielding himself from the two of them as Steve pulled Tony onto his chest so the other man was straddling him, their soft kisses turning very suddenly more dirty as they reached the ‘thank God you’re alive’ stage of their reunion. “Switch off the heart-rate monitor before the nurses think Steve’s having a heart attack, please.”
And then Steve straightened up and stepped back, over in the direction of the door. Tony’s face fell right back down again. “Where are you—you’re not going, are you?”
Steve sighed. “It wasn’t all your fault,” he said softly, worrying at his lip with his bottom teeth. “I never mentioned it was an Unhuman thing. You didn’t know, and you seemed to really love Halloween, and I didn’t want to rain on your parade so I just let you get on with it without giving you a proper reason, just expecting… I dunno, expecting it to go away in the end, I guess.” Steve laughed self-deprecatingly. “And then, surprise surprise, it doesn’t, and I get overly upset by you continuing on with it, despite the fact that I never gave you any real incentive to stop.”
The whole group ended up squashed together, a pile of limbs and colour and pillows as they all stared up at the giant TV they could see through the entrance of the fort. A young Paul Rudd insulted Cher as she discussed something undoubtedly shallow, but in all honesty, Steve wasn’t paying much attention to the screen. Inside the fort, everyone was too caught up in a heated debate over the validity of pineapple on pizza, with Clint, Nat and Tony firmly on the Pro-Team, and the rest of them all yelling various profanities and cursing their existence for having that opinion.
Bucky swallowed and nodded. His eyes went a little harder and he stuck his chin out determinedly. “I’ll make sure of it,” he said firmly.
“He’s a better person than you fucking are,” Rhodey growled, taking Tony’s arm and tugging them away, “come on, man, just leave it. This isn’t your problem.”
Steve almost laughed, before the sensation died in his throat slightly. “Do you have to do this… often?”
“Well, I’m a changed man now. Camping’s on the agenda. I’ll cancel all my meetings.” He paused, before widening his eyes. “But before I go
“No, no, shit, he didn’t see me,” Steve assured him hurriedly, “I went under the bed. Tony’s… I think he’s fine. I left a little while after.”
Tony asks him softly, because he’s covered in blankets but he still feels cold and he’s too drunk and aching and sad to sleep alone tonight.
They’d just been getting ready for the day in their bathroom, Tony trimming his beard while Steve brushed his teeth. They hadn’t been speaking, but the silence was companionable. Easy. Tony was pressed up against the sink, looking at Steve in the reflection of the mirror with an analytical gaze and a small frown. Steve was looking worse. His cheeks were more gaunt, his skin washed out. He even seemed thinner, which was a little freaky. And Tony knew that whatever it was going on was a sensitive subject, but it had gotten to a point where he didn’t want to take no for an answer. It was clear that Steve wasn’t well, and Tony just wanted to help him. Even if Steve apparently didn’t want that, and was determined to try and deal with it alone.
Steve looked at him for another moment with his clenched jaw, before it dissipated a moment later, just like that. His fingers softened against his arms, becoming a gentle hold as opposed to a grip. He sighed and looked down, knocking their foreheads together. “I know you didn’t,” he said quietly, “you never do.”
Then Tony swore and leaped out of bed, and Steve landed back in reality with a blink of his eyes. He breathed in. They were in Tony’s room. Obviously. Although that still didn’t really account for the shrill whine of the alarm that signalled something or another, most likely something bad.
“You’re going to be fine,” Bruce, Bruce with the curly hair and the sad eyes said, “you’ve been concussed pretty badly, but you’re going to be okay.”
“None of this… none of it was your fault,” he whispered, forcing down the heat behind his eyes. “Tony, you were… I abused you for weeks.  I hurt you-“
With a short wave that quickly turned into a middle finger, Steve just turned back around. He was in a good mood, and no slimy asshole was going to ruin that. “If only all your girlfriends told you that when you fucked, you might actually be able to hold onto them!” He called back cheerfully, bouncing up the stairs and not looking back. By the entrance he spotted Clint, Jane and Carol, and he waved at them all before nudging his way into the circle. “Hey guys.”
Tony shrugged, putting the last armful of stuff into the cupboard. “Just housekeeping,” he said, “I keep stepping on all of this crap.”
The soft knocks against the door filtered through Tony’s ringing ears, and he knew that Steve was waiting for him on the other side of it. He tried to say something, but the air wouldn’t make its way out of his throat, couldn’t even get down into his lungs- it was stuck in the middle, stagnant. His head was wet, dripping down onto his shirt, clinging to the ends of his hair, disgusting and cold and terrible. He heard himself whine and curl in a little further against the toilet bowl- God, how
“They can’t have gotten far!” Clint argued, “did you see Tony? They had to practically drag him away!”
Steve looked slightly taken aback by the sudden outburst, and his eyes were a little wide as he looked at Tony, out of breath and staring murderously back at him.
stealing my Dad’s car in order for you to turn around and just keel over at home, Steve. I am taking you to the hospital, end of story.”
“Depressing?” Steve said with a wry smile, “yeah, it kinda is. But it might help me. And someone’s gotta keep her grave nice and tidy, or she’d go nuts.” He laughed nervously, before thinking about how weird that must have sounded to Thor. Most people didn’t talk about the dead as if they were still alive.
Steve ripped his eyes away from Tony’s face, suddenly feeling a wave of nausea sweep over him. He forced it down, unwilling to make Tony worry about him further. He had no idea what to say. What to do. None of this was right- it was a horrible dream that he couldn’t escape from. His hands were shaking, and he pushed them behind his back and clenched them tight, until it hurt.
“Okayyy…” Tony said cautiously, hands still half-lifted, “how about, rather than just sticking to the ceiling, I take you for a ride in my flying suit? Then you can stick to the biggest, highest,
Steve thought about the second time he’d met Tony, at the party downtown. When he’d cleared the room with a clap of his hands, and everyone had moved out of the way so he could get through. And here he was, in front of Steve, worried about what his friends thought of him.
Tony looked down at his Iron Man boxers, then nodded. “I like that plan,” he agreed, before bounding off in the direction of their bedroom, “back in a minute!”
There were shrugs and shaking heads around the room, so Steve figured nothing overly important had happened while they’d been gone. Tony came back into the kitchen a minute or so later, and it didn’t take long for all of them to settle down into their normal routine again; with Tony and Clint bickering across the table and Natasha egging them both on, and Thor sat happily filling himself up on bread rolls before the meal even began. Bruce informed him that he had no reason to complain when he had no bread left to dip, and Thor merely grunted as he stuffed even more food into his mouth as usual.
“Tony don’t-“ Steve called after him, and he moved forward but Bucky still kept hold of his arm, so Steve slammed his shoulder angrily into the boy’s chest and shoved him off before turning back around.
But until the streets were clear of scum, then he and his team would continue to do their job and fight to get rid of them. Many feared him- a few didn’t believe in his existence at all- but Steve's path was clear, and he didn’t plan on stopping anytime soon.
What other reason would the AI have for offering himself up like that, without hesitation? That’s just what family did, after all. Put one another first. Of all the things Tony could have taken with him last night: all the money he could have stolen or equipment he could have lugged into the back of his car—he’d chosen JARVIS.
Tony looked up sharply, “it is… we have less than 48 hours until product launch and he’s taken an early fucking night? I can’t… he annotated this and I have no idea what any of his shit writing is trying to tell me, what the…” He shut his eyes and calmed himself. It was alright. “Call his home number. I need him to translate this bullshit for me.”
Both of them looked at one another for a few seconds, disbelief in both of their eyes. Tony wondered whether he was still being affected by the concussion. Last time he’d been coherent, he was convinced Steve was going to kick him off the team for good, and now… now he was saying that he loved him? It hardly even computed properly in his brain.
Steve couldn’t sleep, thinking about it. The memories plagued him like a curse, every feeling of fist hitting flesh coming back to him when he closed his eyes. He asked about Tony’s condition whenever someone came in to visit him, and they all said the same thing. He was doing okay. He was healing. Steve wondered what Tony would be thinking, sat in that hospital bed, hardly able to move without some part of him hurting. Would he think of Steve every time? Or would he be blocking it out, crushing it all down like he usually did? He had no idea. Steve longed to see him more than anything else, but at the same time, he wanted to run. Run far away, where he couldn’t put another finger on the man he loved again. He wasn’t sure what he’d do when he saw Tony. Maybe it’d break him.
Oh Fuck. He couldn’t. He had to protect Tony. He couldn’t let himself be the one responsible for his husband’s death. He couldn’t do it.
Stepping out of the car and into the elevator, he undid his tie from around his neck and then pushed his sleeves up to his forearms, running through his to-do list. The results would take a little while to come through, but hopefully they would know by the end of the night, and so could call social services or... whatever it was Clint would want to do if it turned out he was the dad. Tony wasn't sure- it wasn't as if Clint would keep him, surely? Then again, what did Tony know? maybe Clint was a paternal guy. Maybe he'd grow into it.
“I’m- glad you’re happy, Steve,” he said, and the way he looked at Steve in that moment sort of- sort of sent him reeling a little. There was something in his eyes that Steve couldn’t place- something strong. It was sad- but there was more to it than that. It was a softness, too.
“Now now boys,” Natasha called out, pausing her meticulous brushing of Pepper’s hair in order to shoot them both a look, “no fighting during movie night, that’s the rule.”
“You think I’ll be better off alone?” Steve yelled throatily, and he could almost feel the pain in his heart as it tore itself in two- like Tony was just reaching in and yanking, “you think any life that remains is anything close to what I have with you? I’d rather die and spend what’s left of my living with the person I fell in love with than live out the rest of my days without you. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”
Tony barely managed to grab hold of the fabric of Steve’s shirt before he was sprinting back across the room, heading right for Clint, face absolutely
Steve turned to him, catching him just as he winced at the stretch. The other man sighed, but returned the kiss, this time on the mouth. “You’re gonna be a nightmare about this, aren’t you?” he said quietly. “I really shouldn’t have to say this, but please don’t reopen your wound just to kiss me.”
“Not too great,” Steve admitted with a strained smile, pressing his thumbs gently into the insides of Tony’s wrists, feeling the pulse once more. He felt nervous- he didn’t want to touch him in case something happened. Steve could still picture Tony, choking under all the insurmountable power that he held under his palms. “HYDRA did a number on me.”
“I am going to take the fastest and coldest shower of my life,” Tony explained, voice a little hoarse as he looked down at Steve, “and you are going to stay right here, okay? Don’t go anywhere.”
“I know you’re not, Mrs Wilson,” Steve hurried to assure her, “this is my fault. I know that I’m on my last few warnings now, I shouldn’t have spoken to Principal Fury like that. It was wrong.”
“Tony, I promise, it’ll be fine.” Steve leaned down, catching his mouth in a light kiss. “If I need backup, I’ll call for it. What with your above-atmosphere Quinjets and a suit that can reach Mach 5 in the time it takes for me to blink, I’m sure there won’t be a problem.”
Steve moved along, Tony beside him. “Stop struggling,” Steve said sharply, before adding in a softer voice that the agent at the desk couldn’t hear, “you’re already hurt, you don’t need to go overboard with the theatrics.”
What was he even thinking? Why did that infuriating, stupid boy manage to turn his brain to mush so effectively?
in his head, that was what made him feel so sick. He hadn’t thought about fighting it. Hadn’t been a mindless puppet, oblivious to what he’d done. He hadn’t been trapped inside his own mind, the rational part of him looking out as his hands moved against his own will either. He’d known. He
And it was stupid to think it, but fuck, Steve turned his head to look at Tony and the only thing he could think was ‘I want this forever’.
Almost certainly not. At the time, Steve had been convinced he’d never make a single other friend outside of Peggy and Buck. He’d thought highschool was just going to go from bad to worse. And he’d thought the beautiful boy that rode his bike to school and stared at him when he thought Steve hadn’t been looking was just another perfect disaster- far out of reach, living on a different world to Steve. One that he’d never be able to reach.
He swallowed back the doubts and marched forward, finding the stairwell he’d headed down a few hours previously. According to SHIELD protocol, Tony should still be on this floor. And if he wasn’t chained up to one of the interrogation rooms, he’d be in a holding cell.
“Why are you… what?” He asked, words still sitting thick in his mouth as his brain attempted to boot itself back up from its night of sleep. “Rhodey, why are you here?”
“Did we just get lumped into the night-shift again?” Steve asked, glancing dubiously down at Peter, now sat comfortably in Tony’s grasp once more.
“And I will keep coming back and trying until one day I succeed,” Steve gritted out, shaking his head as he watched her. “This isn’t about me wanting to kill myself. If that were the case I’d have just picked a bridge. This about me wanting Tony to live.”
But God, he’d never do what Ty had done- a shitty movie and then copping a feel in the back of the cinema? So fucking trashy. And cheap. Steve might be broke as shit, but if it was a date, then he’d put some Goddamn effort into at least making it nice for Tony, Jesus-
Of course it had. Because that was just the sort of thing Tony had to think about; whether he’d have a home tomorrow, or next week, or whenever he and his dad had their next fight.
things had been sent across their secure line in times when either of them had been away for whatever reason. Tony chewed his lip as he thought. “Send all dirty pictures via first-class airmail,” he landed on in the end with a nod of finality.
These worries plagued him for entire trip back, and by the time they arrived at Bucky’s he was a nervous wreck. Bucky wouldn’t hear anything of him returning, however, and simply pulled him inside and then pointed to the kitchen counter, where Steve sat obediently.
He shut off his phone and grimaced, grabbing his coat from the side of his bed and then getting to his feet quickly. Luckily Mr and Mrs Wilson had left for date night, so the house would be empty until around 10 the next morning. Well- Sam was there, but he slept like the dead anyway, and it would take an earthquake before anything woke that guy up.
This was a tricky one, see- it was notoriously difficult for an infamous mob boss like himself to stick to his morals, because there would always be an occasion in which he would end up having to abandon them for the sake of the cause. He’d strayed from his path a few times too many- he knew that. But when you got caught up in the life he did, it was bound to happen. He was trying his best, though. And to this day, he knew he had never spilled a drop of innocent blood. Everyone who ended up on his radar ended up there for a reason, and they were not good ones.
Steve stilled, his smile dropping. He pulled away a second later. “Tony, we’ve talked about this,” he said, voice gentle, but underlined with something Tony couldn’t pinpoint. However, he didn’t let that stop him, hands tightening in Steve’s shirt as he attempted to convey his point.
Tony stroked his fingers through Steve’s hair, shutting his eyes and letting the sound of Steve’s breathing take over.
Tony just patted his shoulder gently from over the couch, wincing when he looked at the screen for too long. How Thor could deal with watching something so bright in a room so dark and not go immediately blind was beyond him.
"Yeah, that's probably best," everyone said, all of them determined not to be saddled with the responsibility. Tony rolled his eyes, looking over at Steve for confirmation. The man looked like he was swallowing cement, but eventually he just sighed and shrugged in defeat.
Peggy scowled, pointing a finger. "You need to stop posting pictures of your stupid girlfriend online. You're making
They’d found out what had happened. He wasn’t sure how, but they did. It was probably on the news. Someone with a camera filming it all. Steve doesn’t remember much, if he’s being honest. He barely even knows how he got back to their bedroom, or how he got the cut on his forearm, or what Thor said to him when Natasha guided him through the door, or anything.
He caught eyes with Zeke as he passed by the window, staring uncaringly up at the guy with folded arms. Next to Zeke was Ty and another boy that Steve didn’t recognize, and they all slowed down for a moment, looking at him intently.
“Tough shit, buddy,” Steve shrugged, winding his foot around the back of Tony’s leg and then swiping, sending him tumbling onto his back with a yell, “’cause I’m here now, and you’re just gonna have to deal.”
Tony took another drag, and let the smoke fall from his lips. Steve felt the pressure as he pressed a kiss to Steve’s shoulder. “Just watch the view, darling.”
“Tony, yesterday you refused to get out of bed because I hadn’t given you a morning kiss. You had to call me and then demanded I come back upstairs.”
Of course, this was probably a lie. Tony hadn’t managed to remain undetected for this long without keeping his guard up, and he probably had a hundred different stories up his sleeve for this sort of occasion. But… but when Steve thought about it, it really did make sense. He could remember, last year, seeing Tony poring over files and files’ worth of data and transactions, all of them scattered out across their kitchen table. Steve had never asked why—but he’d heard clips of conversations Tony had had with JARVIS. They’d been searching for irregularities in the books. Unsanctioned deals and anything that looked out of place or fabricated. It had consumed Tony for… well, weeks, probably. Steve could admit, he hadn’t really kept track of anything during that time. The whole period was somewhat blurry; greyed out by pain and grief and booze. But he could remember that much.
“This is your choice, Tony,” he murmured with a shrug, “you wanna risk it with your old man, fine by me. I don’t care either way. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Just come back. Where you
When he reached Tony, he was pulled into a hug that was a little tighter and lasted a little longer than usual. Tony kissed him on the forehead quickly and then leaned back. “Hello to you too,” he said through a smile, before he frowned, “are you shaking? How long have you been out?”
Steve, having listened to the whole story, nodded solemnly. "I'm betting good money they won't be doing that again, though," he added helpfully, and Tony laughed sharply.
His movements are erratic and jerky, and it’s a concentration that Tony has ever really seen on-well-
Both the brothers went off to follow Steve’s orders, which was surprising, considering Steve had expected some resistance from Loki at least. Seemed he understood the severity of the situation, however, because he didn’t say a word. Steve was left alone again with Tony, gently taping the cut on the other boy’s cheek together. He thought about what Howard must have done to inflict this. Wondered whether Tony had even bothered to fight back. Steve doubted it. Had Tony been giving as good as he got, he probably never would have gotten this hurt.
But Tony had always lived dangerously. And there was no way in hell that he could ever, ever stop loving Steve now.
When he looked across at Steve, the man was smiling like a single star in a black sky, lighting up the world. “That’s how I feel too,” he whispered, leaning forward, “that’s…yeah.”
God, they were going to kill him. He had to build their missile or they were going to kill him, they were going to keep doing this and he couldn’t keep doing this-
Fury nodded, clearly impressed at how fast Steve had worked it out. “Exactly,” he swept away from the desk, beginning to pace the room, “it’s common knowledge that Stark doesn’t let anyone close these days. We haven’t seen a single guest in his house, he rarely attends public functions any more, and he lives alone in a far-out corner of the West Coast. If we tried to send in an agent, Stark would clock it was us and turn them out at the door without hesitating.”
In all honesty, Tony was pretty certain he was. Granted, it’d probably taken him longer than average to reach that conclusion what with all the neuroses he carried with him, but even
He forced himself to focus. Pulled his eyes open, focused on the hazy image of the person leaning over him. He had to say something. It was important.
Tony wouldn’t want Steve to help him back to safety. Steve knew him well enough for that. So he steeled his face and he grabbed Bucky and sent a distress signal on Tony’s behalf, trying not to think about the fact he was leaving his lover and his whole life behind in the snow.
“No, it’s—” Steve leaned against the wall and sighed. His head hurt. “—you couldn’t have done anything about it.” He remembered the request JARVIS had just put in for him and then pushed away from the corridor wall again, making his way down the stairs. “I’m going down now—which car is it?”
Tony whined and leaned up, catching Steve’s jaw between his fingers and littering kisses over his mouth. “No, no, I disagree. You should keep that hand right where it belongs, which is on my ass, thank you Captain Rogers—”
Clint rolled his eyes and hopped on the table next to Tony, “that these are favours you can ask- no arguments allowed- of me, contractually signed and agreed upon. Only for the amount of times it says on the slip, though, I’m not that easy.”
Once everyone had piled out of the car twenty minutes later and started making their way into Natasha’s place, Steve quickly pulled Bucky aside and kept him behind whilst everyone else wandered off. “Bucky, pal, brother, best-friend-for-life, you’re wise, right-“
He turned and walked away to the sound of his friends making various noises behind him and attempted not to snort in amusement. He was definitely not going to give them the satisfaction of that. Although he had to admit- it was nice to have them around, treating him like they always did, like nothing was wrong. It was probably not going to last, but… for now. It was just nice to pretend everything was okay.
So he dove back into his work with renowned vigour, letting the math and the science and the engineering take over once more; a welcome change to the mess within his head. He disassembled the prototype StarkPhone that was currently in the works and then reassembled it better, faster, and definitely prettier than before. Not that the latter had been difficult. He was going to be having words with the design team about aesthetics later.
She smiled softly, crossing her legs and then observing him for a second. “You know, I'm really pleased for you, Steve,” She declared, her eyes twinkling, “you’re usually very good at depriving yourself of things that make you happy because you think you don’t deserve them. But there’s always going to be a point when you start to let that go- when you begin to let happiness in, in whatever form it comes from, and that’s when you know change is around the corner. It won’t be an easy path, we both know that. But this is the first step. And I’m glad we’re reaching that point now. Because it starts slowly- that’s why we work on trying to get you back into your old routines, your passions, your hobbies. You have to work your way back up. Seeing that you’re socialising a bit more, you’re practising a hobby you enjoy doing- it means you’re taking action. Even if they’re just little things, and even if you have to stop for whatever reason, or you end up falling back a few paces- this is just proof that you’re capable of getting at least one foot on the ladder. Remember that, Steve. ”
A minute later, his phone pinged again. This time, it was a photograph. He opened it, and saw Agent Rogers smiling bashfully beside Stark, whose arm was flung casually around Steve’s shoulders. He had clearly been the one to corral Rogers into taking the picture, what with the smug grin on Stark’s face contrasted by the faintly embarrassed expression on Rogers’. Fury didn’t fail to notice that there was a gold band around Stark’s ring finger again.
“Tony?” Steve called out from the other room, voice starting small but becoming decidedly panicked the next time around. “Tony? Tony, come here, I don’t… Tony!”
Steve looked at him blankly, before folding his arms. “I’m not going to apologize to the car, Bucky.”
He glanced behind him, watching Steve as he sat up in bed, the frown back on his face. “What are you doing?” He asked, voice full of sleepiness.
“You know what I think is even hotter?” Steve titled his head and then brushed his lips across Tony’s ear. Tony remained silent, listening, and then Steve continued: “You doing what you love and succeeding in life because you’re smart enough to do anything you set your mind to.” And before Tony could respond with something undoubtedly self-deprecating, Steve blew sharply in his ear.
Steve nodded. “It’s for the best,” he said firmly, glancing over at Peter as the kid poked Thor with the Widow’s Bite, watching in fascination as the skin turned white where he put the pressure.
own, and generally make a very large show of being someone that he doesn’t want to question, for fear of also being sued for everything he owns. Can you do that?”
But Steve had made his choice, and Tony knew the man. He was stubborn, and when he thought something was right, there was no changing his mind.
. His fingers found Steve’s belt buckle, and he undid it hastily. “Just get those pants off, please.”
Tony gave a whisper of a smile, eyes falling shut as he leaned against Thor’s side. Steve turned when a shadow was cast upon him and looked at Loki, arms folded and eyes averted as he grimaced. “For what it’s worth, you’ve got me too. Not that you
The look on Steve’s face made Tony want to say it a thousand times over, and maybe at some point he would. Maybe later tonight, even, if Tony was really lucky. Although it would admittedly be in a less sexy environment than what Tony had been envisioning. Having a leg that you couldn’t really move meant they were confined to hospital-bed snuggles only.
floor, right up until Natasha gave him the all-clear five minutes later through a short text. Steve was already moving by the time he’d opened it, and he’d made his way back to the underground level in under a minute, not passing any other agents on his way. When he reached the desk, there was a new agent sat behind it, and he regarded Steve with a suspicious eyebrow-raise. “We don’t have any interviews scheduled tonight,” he declared as Steve walked by.
“— He’s not… okay, whatever, look, you’re right. I can’t just walk out. But Tony can summon his suit, and once he’s got that, nothing SHIELD can do will stop him, you know that.”
Zeke managed to hold that gaze for about two more seconds before crumbling; looking down and coughing. With a shake of his head, Tony turned around, looking down seriously at Steve and then moving him back the way he’d come. “Okay. He gets it. Think it’s time to go, huh?”
With an angry lurch, Steve hauled up another one of the bodies in the snow and tried to find anything useful tucked away in the uniform. The HYDRA logo sneered up at him as he checked the pockets, and not for the first time that day, he thought about how nice life was going to be once they’d wiped that organization off the face of the Earth.
That was how long it took before they managed to get out, find somewhere with a signal and comm in to Thor to tell him to get back to the tower by any means necessary. Thankfully, every part of the escape itself had gone perfectly, with Tony’s memory serving him well enough to be able to lead them over to the particle displacer that SHIELD had taken in from a fight a few months prior, and subsequently allowing them to create a hole in the seven-meter-thick ceiling. After that, it had simply been a question of Clint notching the right arrow and lodging it into the ceiling of the next floor above them, with the wire attached to it allowing them all to scramble up.
“Tony, stop squirming,” Natasha called out from the middle of the room, pointing a finger at Rhodey. “Rhodey, please stop him squirming.”
It took a few seconds, but suddenly Steve shook his head and looked to Tony, eyes widening a little in surprise. “Sorry- what did you say?”
He blinked into his pillow, frowning at the incessant beeping noise coming from his right. It took a fraction of a second for the tone to register, and then he was upright in a flash, grabbing the phone while his finger simultaneously slid over the answer button. He was used to going from asleep to battle-ready by this point. Came with the job. “Captain Rogers,” he said, voice clipped and a little croaky—he
Eventually, Tony stirred again. Nudging his nose against Steve’s shirt a few times, he sniffled and then pawed a clumsy hand over his face. Steve watched with a smile, setting his hand down against the back of Tony’s neck. “Hello again,” he said, “how was your nap?”
In answer, Bucky just waved a hand over to Steve. “You’re stayin’ the night over at his. Figure you might want to head to school in something that isn’t a suit.”
His hand cracked the ceramic, and he looked at, kept clenching until the cracks splintered, turned to shards into his hands. It pierced his skin. He wished he could feel it, but it was a nothingness in comparison to the agony that was going on under his chest. Someone was ripping out his fucking spine. Someone had stuck a hand through his ribs, rummaged around until it had found his heart and then just crushed it.
Tony hummed in his ear, and Steve leaned his head back until it was rested against Tony’s chest, looking up at the cloud-scattered sky and feeling, for the first time in what may well have been years, utterly weightless. No heaviness dragging him down- no thoughts reminding him of everything he’d lost. In his palm was Tony’s hand, and in his pocket was his mother, sending him love, always.
Howard stepped forward then, one long stride, and Tony’s mouth shut off with an abrupt halt. Steve heard him scuttle backward on the mattress above him, and for one terrifying moment, he thought that Howard was going to strike him. He reached out a hand on autopilot, aiming for the man’s ankle, readying to pull it out from underneath him if he had to- but he heard no sound of impact, and instead, just a deafening silence.
For a second, Tony did nothing except look at him incredulously. Then he burst out laughing, pulling Steve into his chest and hugging him in delight.
His words were finally stopped as Tony put a hand down gently over his mouth. The man was smiling as if trying to hold it back, his corners ticking up and his eyes going soft as he shook his head. “I love you too. And I’m sorry too. For giving up so easily in the end, for not being there when you needed me. I thought space would help, but it made things worse, and by the time I realised that, you were too far away from me. But I’ve learned. I’m different now. I don’t run from my problems any more.”
“You only just woke up,” Steve argued weakly, but now Tony’s shoulder was a little nearer, he couldn’t stop himself from resting his head against it. “God- I’m sorry, Tony, I’m fucking-”
Peggy's foot was in his face barely a moment after he'd made himself comfortable on the couch, and it prompted an automatic sigh in response. Unfortunately, by this point in their friendship that sort of behavior was normal, and so he just looked to the ceiling in defeat. "Fuck off, Peggy, my chest is not a footrest."
He asked again about what had happened after he’d passed out in the cabin, and this time, Rhodey began to retell the story with his usual flare, because no matter what he said, the man was dramatic as hell. The way he described it made it sound as if certain death had been inevitable, and from the way Steve tensed up a little next to him, perhaps that hadn’t been too far from the truth.
“Take it back,” Tony mumbled, feeling the warm insides of Bruce’s thick jacket as it insulated him, “Bruce, you’re gonna—”
“Then there is no one that I could possibly feel safer with,” Tony nodded and then patted Steve’s side of the bed hopefully. He needed Steve to sleep with him tonight. He needed it, otherwise he was going to start going down into a spiral, and once that started it’d never goddamn stop, and right now Tony was doing a good job of keeping all that at bay. He wanted to keep it that way.
Steve grinned for a second, before they turned the corner and began walking toward the receptionist at the end of the hall. Tony began his tirade; squirming around in Steve’s grip as he stumbled along, threatening a dozen different legal actions Steve barely even understood, waving his first in the air and saying SHIELD wasn’t going to last a week under the scrutiny of his attorneys. He was very believable. Then again, Tony had always been a better liar than Steve.
He would have finished his sentence, were it not for the sudden presence of Tony’s mouth on his own, sealing the words right up between both of their lips.
Tony was used to not sleeping. It kind of came with the job, and his brain took a while just to shut off on a good day, so more often than not Tony would just crash whenever he could, sleep schedule be damned.
But if Tony really was Iron Man… then Steve didn’t have a choice. This was a terrorist that needed taking down- not his ex, not his friend. A Supervillain, collecting an army’s worth of deadly weapons and information for God only knows what. Hell, the fact that Steve hadn’t seen this progression beginning when he’d still been with Tony made him partly responsible, because there was no way in hell any of this would have been done on a whim. Tony must have been plotting this for a long time. And Steve must have been blind to it for even longer. He should have seen what was happening before it had even had the chance to start; should have spotted Tony falling into the typical patterns that many radicalised individuals went through. But he hadn’t then, and it seemed that the only way anyone was going to be taking Iron Man down was if Steve did this now.
He tried to think of it. It was important. Something about love and dates and Christmas crackers, and…
“Oh my God.” Tony’s eyes widened as he moved forward, taking the little boy out of Bruce’s arms and holding Peter up with amazement. “That was Bruce’s name.” He turned his head back toward the living room. “Hey Steve! Peter really did just say Bruce’s name!”
“That’s bullshit,” he declared, snorting loudly and shaking his head. The clock in the corner of the room ticked on, quiet and yet deafeningly loud, and Steve wanted to put his fist through it to shut it up. He pulled an incredulous face and turned back to Fury. “You can’t be serious. Iron Man is… he’s a terrorist.”
Fuck, Steve wasn’t sure what he’d do if he found out Tony was in a relationship. Possibly something embarrassing, like cry. He really,
“S’gonna keep you nice and warm,” Steve explained as he tugged Tony’s arms through the sleeves of his own oversized shirt. Tony went willingly, relief surging through him as the dampness all over him was replaced by the soft fabric of Steve’s clothes. Soon enough, Steve’s arm came back to his back and hugged him gently, a hold that would have been easy to slip out of if necessary, but firm enough to remind Tony where he was. Tony, exhausted by that point, slumped forward and buried his head into the crook of Steve’s neck. He felt shaky; the last dredges of terror still flitting around his brain like a plague that just wouldn’t leave. He still hadn’t opened his eyes.
And there they stayed. Watching the stars glitter and move slowly through the sky as their little planet turned- still going, still (relatively) unscathed, thanks to their efforts.
Susan looked at him for a good long time, both of them gazing at one another from across the room. She was now Steve’s last tether to this place. He would already be gone if she hadn’t halted his progress.
“But I’m awake now,” Steve said sullenly, “why would I try and get back to-” he glanced down at Tony’s face- saw the way he was raising his eyebrows and biting his lip softly as he leaned further into Steve’s space, and the penny dropped suddenly, “-oh! Oh. Okay.
The bottom of Tony’s world fell away, leaving only the darkness of his words. His hands fell to his sides, numb.
“I don’t know what the fuck you did, but you seem to have Steve wrapped pretty firmly around your little finger either way,” Bucky answered, hands shaking by his sides, “now I don’t know if you’re manipulating him, or blackmailing him, or just straight up fuckin’ lying to him ‘cause you want in his pants, but I’m telling you it ends here. You’re dangerous, Stark, and I won’t let you put a finger on him. He’s been through enough-”
Another long silence fell, as all the boys processed Tony’s words. Steve felt like someone was in the process of gutting him. He looked down, forcing back the urge to scream, and instead just leaned forward, pushing a smile onto his face as he brushed his nose against Tony’s softly.
In a sad kind of way, Steve got it. He knew he wasn’t much, not just to look at, but in terms of background and influence and basically everything that Tony lived and breathed. It made a weird sort of sense, that Tony was… well, maybe not ashamed of him, but wary to show him off to the world.
“Sounds a little hypocritical if you ask me,” Steve folded his arms. Tony just shrugged, taking another long drag and blowing out.
Tony just watched him for another minute, gauging his reactions. When Steve said nothing, he leaned back in his chair as far as the cuffs would allow. He looked truly beaten; a look Steve had never seen on Tony’s face before, not since the day they’d met. “I trusted you,” he whispered, short, simple, damning. “You told me you loved me and I
Steve smiled, and he kissed Tony’s nose fondly. “well that’s good to hear,” he responded, “cause otherwise me sat in your bathroom stroking your hair would be a little weird.”
“I miss you,” he said softly, and it had been six months, but every time he came down here he still goddamn cried- he didn’t know how he was ever going to look at the concrete slab that marked his mom’s grave and not feel the grief well up so deep and profound inside him- “I miss you so much, ma.”
“I’ve heard things about him from the other parents, you know,” Mr. Wilson’s voice was louder now, trying to match Steve’s own, “I know he’s bad news. On drugs all the time, already has a criminal record—”
He shook his head and continued forward, pulling the window open easily and then checking his distances before tentatively climbing out, legs hanging over the sill. A moment’s pause had him nervously wondering whether the sound was going to be loud enough to alert someone to his presence- but he quickly discarded it. Their meeting rooms were all the way over on the other side of the building, and anyway, it was a brick roof. It wouldn’t make an overly loud sound.
Tony thought absently in confusion as Steve grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and lifted him up,
He didn’t want to leave, but if he stayed any longer he felt like he might be physically sick. His whole head was a complete fucking disaster-zone by that point, and he could hardly even tell which direction was up any more.
, he told himself quickly, feeling his cheeks begin to turn red just from the thought. That was enough of that. Very inappropriate timing.
Steve watched Tony open his mouth, readying to call out. Undoubtedly something witty or sarcastic, thinly veiled to hide the genuine relief underneath. But the words never came.
It was 2 in the morning by the time he managed to get back to their room, everything finally arranged and sorted. He felt sleepiness pull at his eyelids as he slipped through the door, but he had a few more things to do before he slept. Pulling out their suitcases from under the bed, Steve slowly began to throw his own clothes into it, making sure to be silent and not wake up his lover as he got some well-deserved rest. He didn’t much care for his own wardrobe, but he knew Tony did, so he spent a little bit longer picking out the outfits that he hoped Tony would like. Tony was probably going to pack a whole other suitcase the next morning despite all his efforts, but hey, it was the thought that counted.
“The Wrecking Crew appear to have begun a raid on Wall Street. They’re currently in the National City Bank, and reports are coming in saying they’ve got hostages.”
Steve looked up, and then without another moment’s hesitation he jumped from the couch and headed out of the room, holding a hand out for Bucky to stay where he was as he made his way through the kitchen and toward the door. He couldn’t see anything through the frosted glass of the window, but when he pulled open the door a moment afterward, he spotted Tony a few paces away, hands stuffed rigidly into his pockets as he stared at the ground.
Steve shook his head. “If it were high priority enough, he would’ve called all of us in. I’m sure it’ll be fine. Anyway, you have to attend the peace summit today, remember? That’s pretty important, sweetheart.”
Tony looked at him for an extra second, and then nodded again. “Thank you,” he said, pushing down at Steve’s shoulders until he hit the edge of the mattress of Tony's bed, “now it’s time to actually get around to what we came here for.”
“Well, you thought wrong.” Steve leaned forward, elbows digging into his knees as he looked down at Tony, still sat stubbornly on the floor and inspecting some soldering. “He’s not been calm since about 5 this morning, apparently. Thor says he missed us. Which brings me to my next question: why did Thor have to call
“Huh?” Tony said when he declared it, only half listening as he soldered something or another onto one of his wiring boards. Steve swallowed and folded his arms on the couch, looking at the curve of Tony’s back, the peek of skin showing between the waistband of his jeans and the hem of his shirt.
He wasn’t sure how long he stayed there. But when he finally pulled away from Steve, he could not longer taste anything in the back of his throat.
“You say that every time, kid,” Paul cut in, and God, he sounded exhausted, “just yesterday, you told us this wouldn’t happen again. Then less than 24 hours later, you’ve been suspended for fighting with exactly the same boy.”
Steve called a few times, but Tony declined, knowing he wasn’t steady enough to talk to Steve and then survive the rest of the working day. Steve had a tendency to get Tony to bare his soul without even meaning to, and he didn’t have time to do that just then. Instead, he drank a cup of coffee and did not wish he could take it Irish, and then locked himself in his office to fill out the remaining paperwork, making JARVIS give him heartrate updates every five minutes. His head hurt, he felt sick, and his hands were stiff. Cold.
like flying. Cool wind braced his cheeks, dark skies littered with shining pinpricks filled his vision. New York was a dot beneath him. He wondered if he was on a plane. Except it was cold, and he was exposed, and planes didn’t feel like
“I don’t want you to stink of smoke, especially not if you’re coming home with me,” Steve explained, pulling Tony’s hand down and then starting to tug him forward gently.
Steve snarled, and rolled right back on to his feet, sprinting back to the edge, readying to throw himself back off, but someone put out an arm, catching his waist and spinning them both around, using the momentum to shove them to the ground.
“All those dreams?” She stormed on mercilessly, “any one of them might be the scenario we chose to re-enact for you. Perhaps the first one- the morning after date night? Choking him to death whilst he stares up at you and just wonders
The kitchen was quiet as he waited for them with his cup of coffee, but it only took five minutes for them to come and fill the gap that they’d left an hour ago. They trudged back in, limping slightly but with wide, adrenaline-fuelled smiles on all of their faces as they laughed together. Tony watched them and smiled, ignoring the way his throat tightened at the sight of them. Didn’t seem like they’d missed him much.
Bucky grimaced, but nodded his head and gave Steve’s shoulder one last squeeze before standing and walking out of the room.
“Hey,” he began softly, turning to face those soft hazel eyes, wanting to capture it, save it, burn it on to his mind so it was the last thing he saw, “I just wanted to say I’m sor-”
Tony paused where he was stood, fingers lingering against the little bit of Peter’s sweater that he’d absently been sorting out. Something tight closed around his heart, and he looked down with a small huff. Steve was probing- probably thought Tony was gonna catch baby-fever after this or something, and then beg for a family of his own. Like he’d be any fucking good at that. Anyway- Steve had made it abundantly clear how much he disliked the very concept, and Tony was not going to push that. Not right now. There was too much on his damned plate.
But then suddenly Steve comes in and wrestles the bottle of whiskey out of his hand like he’s gonna die within the next three seconds if he continues to touch the damn thing, and Tony realises it probably looks a lot worse than it is.
Steve knew Tony had his eyes closed against his shoulder, but he followed the orders anyway. His head tilted a little, and his eyes settled on Tony’s profile, bruised and bloodied and peaceful.
But rather than respond, the boy just shook his head and then rushed off into his bathroom, rubbing frantically at the splatters of paint in his hair and face. It took a few seconds until Tony was done, and when he came back out again, he didn’t even look Steve in the eye. “Just… just wait. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
He went to school cold in a way that couldn’t just be fixed by warm sweaters and lots of layers, but tried to put it out of his mind for the duration of the day. He smiled at Peter when he bumped into the kid on the corridors, poked Natasha when she was being annoying, and although he didn’t see Tony much that day, he made sure to kiss him goodbye and tell him to enjoy the lecture he was going to be attending in Vermont that night.
Tony licked his lips, fingers tapping a staccato rhythm against the cot. But when he looked back toward Steve, his gaze was resolute. “Without a doubt,” he murmured, head nodding. “I want to marry you more than anything in the world, Steve. These last few days— they’ve only cemented the idea of it all.”
Sam made another face, obviously not in the mood for discussion about the subject. Steve couldn't blame him- if he and Sam didn't finish the homework, they'd both be getting sixty-minute detentions. And no one wanted sixty-minute detentions with their math teacher, the guy was a fucking tyrant when it came to completion of work. Bucky might not have been going to their school, but the work he was having to do was pretty much the same thing, and so they’d agreed last night to all pile their brains together and try help one another out.
She licked her lips. She was in a loosely-bound dressing gown which revealed light blue pyjamas underneath. He would have felt terribly guilty about all this, had it been any other day. As it was, he realised he couldn’t have cared less if he’d tried.
The noise of the door opening registered in Tony’s ears, however, because his head snapped up and his wide eyes looked straight at Steve, something undetectable on his face. Immediately, his gaze went to the bruise on Steve’s nose. It took a second for Tony to go from looking a little pale to entirely washed out, stricken with remorse.
The team all coordinated themselves flawlessly around Tony, and he had to admit, of all the people he could have been ambushed with on the side of a blizzardy mountain, he was glad that it was them. The rest of their friends had been cut off from them about an hour ago during the middle of the fight, and now Tony had no idea where any of them were- or even, God forbid, if they were still alive- but at the very least, Tony had Rhodey and Bruce and Nat to look after him. And they would do so to the absolute best of their abilities, which, considering them, was a pretty good standard.
The intercom switched off, and Steve stared ahead at the mansion in front of him, all obstacles cleared from his way with a single conversation. Tony hadn’t even hesitated.
Steve smiled at him and then stood slowly, holding out his hand. Tony tried to compose himself a little, taking one last look at the blueprints before grabbing Steve’s hand and letting the man pull him up. They walked out of the building like that; Tony keeping his eyes on the floor, trying not to imagine the last few stragglers looking at him as he and Steve made their way to the garage on the bottom floor. He wasn’t even sure why he cared, but it felt like a dozen eyes were burning holes into the back of him as they stared. He always got paranoid after leaks to the press.
Laughing gently, Tony stepped forward and wound his fingers through Steve’s, leaning into the man’s side. Steve glanced down at him, his lips quirking into an automatic smile. “We’re gonna be late for our 7:20 res,” Tony told him.
Steve glanced down again at Tony’s bare legs and then plucked a broken-off bit of chip out of Tony’s hair. He wasn’t entirely sure how that had gotten there. “Yeah, I can see that.”
When Steve remained silent, Tony placed a hand on the back of his neck and smiled. “It’s okay. I’m here, baby. And I’ll stay as long as you want me. Just…let it go.”
fucking dumb.” Rocket shook his head, looking stubbornly down at his desk as he threw the ugly little doll back onto the table. Steve didn’t really understand most of what Rocket had just said, but he could hear the pain in the creature’s voice, and tried to think of something that’d take his mind off it.
Tony wanted to say. Peter was a little kid in their care temporarily who Tony could bathe and play with and talk to, sure, but that wasn’t a child who relied on him to be the source of emotional comfort, of constant stability. Tony was fucked up, and he knew, one way or another, he’d end up foisting those problems onto his child. It wasn’t something he even wanted to imagine- he refused to be like his own dad. He was better off staying far away from kids altogether and just avoiding the problem. It would be better for everyone.
He found his phone and sent off a text to Steve, feeling pretty satisfied with his plan. In his excited, socially backward mind, he genuinely could not think of a single reason why it wouldn’t work out. Tony liked Halloween, Steve liked Tony… they could meet in the middle, surely?
“What makes you think that?” He blurted suddenly, and it was weird, he barely even knew her- but she seemed friendly and she was smiling at him and he found himself just needing to know. “What is it that’s so damn obvious to everyone else but me? I had Jane tell me that earlier today too, and I want to know what the fuck you’re all seeing that I’m not.”
Bucky had his arms folded in front of him, and he looked stubborn. They’d had their fair share of arguments over the years- Steve knew that stance. He wasn’t ready to back down yet, it seemed.
His mom had been one of his best friends. Steve had loved the month of December more than anything, mostly because of her.
“And I smoked for years, all the way through my twenties. I quit a good while back, but I’ve never been able to get rid of the craving. Figured there’s no point holding back now, is there?”
Tony just shrugged though- looking off to the side and then throwing up a smile when he caught Steve watching. “They made a documentary about it, you know,” he said softly.
Tony glared at him, jaw clenched so tight that Steve thought his teeth would shatter. Steve just stared, breath not coming at all as he gently pushed Tony in Ty’s direction. He had to do what Ty said, for his own sake.
Sam made his presence known by coughing loudly in surprise. “Fuck, man, are you serious? Did you just… oh, did you get the answers from the teachers? Shit, that’s probably useful as fuck” he said excitedly, jumping to his feet.
“Watching them try and coordinate the taking-over of the entirety of Wall Street is always funny,” Clint agreed with a nod, dumping his bow on the counter and then hopping up onto the counter to grab the cereal box.
dating!” Darcy shrieked excitedly, but Steve just shook his head and batted her flailing hands away in irritation.
Clint's face fell. "Oh no." He turned back to Tony, who was now at the counter pouring out a coffee, "no, don't do this. I don't know how babies work!"
Steve rolled his eyes fondly, but didn’t reply. Just opened his palm a little further so that Tony could trace his patterns into the skin there.
Steve eyed her for a moment, but Natasha didn’t look anything other than satisfied. In all honesty, Steve was mostly just irritated that she’d gotten there first. There were a few things Steve wanted to say to her too. “She was given a sentance, right?”
About an hour later, Tony finally decided to take Steve’s advice and go engage in some human activities such as eating breakfast. He made his way up to the communal floor, hoping that one of the team might have already made something he could pick at. Luckily, his hopes were fulfilled: Sam had dropped by and made pancakes for the whole team, and Thor had been kind enough to hold off from stealing Tony’s portion. The smell alone made his mouth water, and soon he’d sat himself between Clint and Nat as he scoffed down at his pile, comfortable and content.
Thor lingered for another second before putting a hand on Steve’s arm. “I will be outside,” he said, and Steve wasn’t sure whether it was a threat or a promise.
Bucky was silent above him, but Steve didn’t look up. His thumb rubbed over the little indent from where ring had met skin, and he hated himself just that little bit more fiercely when he thought about how he could have still been wearing it if he’d have just acted differently. Not been quite such a confrontational idiot about it. Tony was right; if he’d have just given them the money then maybe they would have left. Steve would have been able to pay Natasha back for the money. There was no way to get that ring back.
He’d been expecting something far more invasive than that, if the look on Clint’s face had been anything to go by. Steve rolled his eyes and looked away from his two friends, who were busy shooting smug little glances at one another and smiling down at him in pride. “It’s good,” he said, leaning back against the couch, “you know it’s good.”
He’d taken a moment to stand in the corridor and breathe, then pulled up Steve’s heart-rate on his phone, watching the steady pulses for five, maybe ten minutes. However long it had taken for him to count up to 1000 beats, anyway. It had helped, even if it was only for a minute or two.
“You’ve had your tongue down my throat, honey, I’m pretty sure you’re not afraid of a bit of spit,” Tony laughed and stood up, kissing him quickly on the cheek before stretching. Steve ducked his head and definitely didn’t think about the last time he’d had his tongue down Tony’s throat. That wouldn’t be a good thing to think about in class. Nope.
“52 beats per minute, sir,” JARVIS informed him, voice quiet, “a little more elevated than when you last checked, due to the fact he just had a cup of coffee.”
- she must think him so Goddamn weak, they all must, “he hit me because he was mindfucked, I survived, we’re moving on now. That’s… that’s
Another round of looks flew around the room, these ones a tad more uncomfortable. No one particularly fancied the responsibility of that, and kids were known to be...
“And until they’re searched, that gives us a few minutes to get the hell out, right?” Steve gritted his teeth together and clenched the phone tighter in his fist, trying to ignore the way Tony’s eyes were burning into his side. He could feel the beads of sweat beginning to pool across his brow, and his heart was starting to speed up with anxiety. “I
“How the hell did you manage to get an artificial intelligence into your room?” Steve walked forward, inspecting the desk in awe; all the buttons and wiring obviously melded together by hand, and suddenly the conclusion came to him-
Slowly, Steve curled his arms around Tony’s shoulders tighter, tucked him into the warmth of Steve’s embrace. Tony hated the cold. He’d hated the cold for years, ever since they’d first met, he wouldn’t step foot out of the house after November without gloves and scarf. Steve didn’t want him to be cold now. He didn’t want him to be uncomfortable.
But he didn’t have time to care about that. Didn’t even notice a flash of red hair pulling back the other guy who’d latched a hand on Steve’s shoulder, or the sound of Sam telling someone to back the fuck up.
“Right, Steve nodded, wandering down the corridors and letting Sam guide them, hopefully toward the cafeteria, “so- who’s who ‘round here then?”
Steve turned to him, patting his head fondly. “Yeah you are,” he responded without faltering, which seemed good enough for Tony, because after a second he just shrugged and then nodded.
So he buried himself up to the waist in Iron Man guts. It was about time he did a rehaul. The wiring sucked. Wiring could always be improved. It was simple. If there was a fault, it could be fixed. If something was slow, it could be sped up. He lost himself to the logic of it, finding comfort with the numbers in the same way he had his whole life. This was what he understood, and it wasn’t going to change, and it wasn’t going to leave. It was just numbers.
“You’ve got me this time around,” he promised, giving their hands a small squeeze, “and we’re not going to watch anything else. JARVIS can just relay any important information back to us.”
Steve just frowned, opening his hand until his palm splayed out against the mark and his fingers curled around the top of his shoulder. “No thanks to me.”
Steve followed; ducking under the branches and noting with surprise that the huge clump of bushes was hollowed out the middle. In front of him, it seemed Tony had found what he was searching for, because he smiled mischievously and turned back to Steve, cocking his head. “How averse are you to what may
, never mind buildings, and Steve knew Tony—he always worked at least seven steps ahead of everyone else. There was a larger game afoot here, and Steve didn’t even want to know what it entailed.
The hands on his arms wouldn’t budge, no matter how hard he struggled, and they yanked him roughly away. He could see that teachers were swarming the area now, some of them going to Bruce, who was still fighting the boy that had tried to hit Steve. There were others, too—Steve noticed absently that Sam’s nose was bloody, and Natasha and Clint were arguing furiously with a wall of teachers as they tried to reach some of Stone’s other friends, who must have come in for backup at some point.
“Tony?” Steve said dumbly, looking over to the bright red Ferrari and then to the boy himself when he got to his knees next to Steve’s side, “Tony, how the hell did you-“
The next time Steve opened his eyes again, some considerable amount of time later, he discovered that he was already being watched.
Tony just looked away, jaw clenched tight and hands fisting into the table. “He’s being stupid,” Tony snapped, “I’m fine, look at me. I wish he’d just get the fucking memo.”
The laws of their species’ had always been strict. The Demon’s magic had been put in place to make sure they never mixed themselves with angels. And no one had ever wanted to before, either, so no one had worked out how to fix it. Not even Tony- even after all those nights spent working until dawn to try and find a solution, especially in the last year, when the effects had finally begun showing.
Natasha rolled her eyes and then resumed hair-stroking. “You’re going to be fine,” she said, “help is on its way. Focus on the petting I’m giving you right now. This is rare.”
lost for a moment. He just turned his head away from Rumlow slowly, staring at the wall, jaw tight enough that Steve wondered whether it might shatter. His eyes were glassy. Rumlow just laughed and laughed and laughed, beginning to stand in his seat, walk over to Tony’s side where he stuck out a hand and grabbed Tony’s chin, forcing him to look up at Rumlow as opposed to the wall. This time it was Steve who flinched.
Tony huffed as Steve yanked him backward, until his back hit the bed directly underneath it. He looked up at Steve bashfully. “Uh- okay, so I know this seems really creepy now I’m thinking about it, but I swear, my intentions were innocent here.”
Steve stopped. It’d been playing on his mind too, he couldn’t deny it. But there could have been a number of explanations. “It was probably just a blank,” he supplied, “Redford must’ve forgotten about it, or maybe he’d fired it off just to scare you.” Tony still didn’t look convinced, but he nodded his head slowly all the same. He’d undoubtedly come to the same conclusion himself.
He could still see the look on Tony’s face when Rumlow broke the news. Still see the way his soul had broken, leaking out through his eyes. Because of him. Because of what Steve had put him through.
“Well, it’s his fault for befriending her,” Carol said with a shrug, before patting Steve on the shoulder, “anyway, I’m gonna get to class. I’ll see you ‘round, Rogers.”
The anger still simmered just below the surface, ready to burst at any moment. He still couldn’t believe what Bucky had done- felt utterly fucking mortified at the way he’d treated Tony after the guy had literally dropped everything to come after him when he’d called. It was the most
invite Tony to his birthday next week. It wasn’t exactly going to be a big thing; just gathering all his friends into one house and then watching movies, probably- but he’d like Tony to be there. Meet all his friends- properly, this time, and not whilst they watched him and Bucky snapping at one another. It would be… nice, hopefully.
Despite everything, Steve smiled a bit- following Tony’s lead as they started walking back down the path again. He was glad for the presence of Tony just then- the warmth in his hand felt good. It felt comforting.
He swore viciously, hearing his words get carried by the wind as he took up the fastest pace he could manage in the thick snow. It was gruelling work, and he felt the sweat as it began to form on his forehead, felt the groan of his legs as they pushed through snow. He refused to slow down though, and the sensation of his heart hammering in his chest was not brought on by the exertion.
He paused. Natasha wasn't the only one there. Peter was sat on her left, fiddling contentedly with something in his hands as he looked in fascination at the screen, and Clint was on the other side, a box of cereal in hand as he too watched Peppa Pig go about her day. Clint was back in his pajamas- or maybe he hadn't even changed in the first place.
Then it was Thor’s turn to splutter. “He’s not staying with me again. I love him, but not that much.”
"it's true," Clint waved a hand over to her and shrugged again, "also, Nat, new info- I think I'm a prostitute."
meant to be Unhuman. He was going to start with an article on Halloween, seeing as it was freshest in his mind, and he knew his way around promoting specific material online, so he’d make sure that this wasn’t going to fail. He could create a few other social media accounts as well, really get it out there. And he knew scientists, psychologists, neurobiologists that could give him the straight facts. He had the connections. It was time he used them for something worthwhile.
On the other side of him, Tony sniffed a bit and then shuffled around, hand leaving Steve’s back briefly to do something else. Honestly, the little huff of annoyance was involuntary, but it had escaped him before he could help it, and he heard Tony pause for a moment before laughing softly.
The words didn’t even sound cruel- just slightly concerned. Like Tony cared. Which didn’t make any fucking sense, considering Tony was Tony Stark and Steve was just.... Steve. Sad little orphan kid who didn’t know what the fuck he was doing.
“I just fell off the bed and landed on something, but I don’t think it’s broken,” Steve explained calmly, before shutting his eyes and sighing, “Tony pushed me off because his dad came in the room. Neither of us had any idea he was home. If I’d been a second slower, he might have seen me.”
The Avengers, who were all stood at the front of the crowd, slowly pulled out sheets of paper from their pockets, looking seriously at Tony as he flailed his hands in confusion, completely unaware of what they were going to have to discuss.
Both Peter and Pops turned, and Peter saw his Dad, leaning casually with his arms folded against the doorframe, a small smile on his face as he watched them.
“Oh, Bruce, I do love you and your projects, you know that,” Thor gave his arm a squeeze and beamed, “but human interaction is good sometimes, yes?”
"Steve, you have been making strange noises at your crotch for over three minutes now, and I am beginning to get concerned," his teacher said from over his shoulder, and Steve yelped in surprise, looking up from the text he was reading and fumbling the off-switch on his phone.
Steve shifted, then, slipping back out of the covers. Tony briefly panicked and thought that he was going to walk out, but instead he headed over to the desk, bending down a little and pulling open one of the drawers. Tony watched him pluck something out and then turn back around, fist closed. He got into bed again and pulled Tony’s hand up, placing the sobriety coin into the flat of his palm before closing Tony’s fingers around it and covering them with his own. Tony just stared intently at their hands, feeling the cool surface of the coin against his sweaty skin. His hands, he realised, were shaking.
you’d come down wearing something of mine, I wanted to do this. I thought you were doing it on purpose- you
matter, I just want to know what I’m doing wrong here, okay? Is it… I know I’m new to this stuff, but- but I dunno, you could maybe just, tell me where it is I’m fucking up or someth-“
From the bed, Steve cocked his head analytically. “Edible,” he said in the end, and it made Tony laugh.
Despite what Steve said, Tony’s face was doubtful, no longer trusting of the words Steve gave him— and more than anything he just wanted to stay here and… and try, something,
Steve knew that Tony had a strange relationship with them, but it was clear to see that at the very least, he’d loved his mother. Howard had been, in Steve’s opinion, a shitty father and a shitty man toward the end, but Tony had always held a strange sort of respect for him, and he’d clearly been a pivotal part of Tony’s life too. It had nearly killed him when they’d died; Steve knew because he’d seen the old news articles.
“Yeah, your lot weren’t so bright, were they?” tony replied, jostling his shoulder and then curling a hand around the lighter as he lit up with the ease of an expert.
Something dropped out of Tony’s stomach as his mind put together the pieces. “Steve?” He called out again, feeling a tremor in his voice. They
Tony just hummed. “Always am, sugarplum,” he answered, leaning in and giving Steve a quick kiss, “now go. I’ll be here when you get back. Promise.”
He pulled up into the drive and opened up the front door wearily, the smell of cooking and herbs filling his nose as soon as he stepped over the threshold. Voices drifted through the air too, right from around the corner where the kitchen was, and he heard Tony’s voice as he said “hold up, honey-plum, I think we’ve got company.”
But then they rang again, and he heard Sam shrieking something that sounded a lot like ‘your room’s closest!’ from across the hall-  which really didn’t leave Steve with a lot of other options.
She knelt in front of him, looking him up and down pityingly. He stared back. He would never lose a staring contest with a person from HYDRA.
There was a long silence as Tony stared at him in shock—then Thor raised a hand into the air for Steve to smack, and with a grin, Steve did, while Tony just whipped his head around and glared at his friend. “Thor, this isn’t a fucking joke!”
The first one was Sam. “What the hell, man?” He began the call with, sounding deeply concerned. “Steve, what’s going on? What was such an emergency that you had to leave the house in the middle of the night for with nothing but a text to let me know?”
, in the early weeks of a freezing spring. Tony could still hardly get over it- how could anyone fucking do that to a baby? It was goddamn lucky that he had JARVIS to inform him as soon as the little basket had been dropped off, or he didn't even want to think about what could have happened.
Tony felt like he was dreaming. Like he was floating on a level of euphoria that anyone else had yet to reach.
Tony could hardly stop laughing enough to confirm it, by that point. “Yes, baby, we’re married. Don’t worry. There’s no one else.”
There was silence for a few moments, before he watched Rhodey turn and raise an eyebrow at Pepper. He actually looked pleased, rather than offended. “I told you he was good,” the boy said to her quietly. She rolled her eyes, but as she turned back to Steve, there was a sheepish smile on her face.
“No, I’m not angry,” Tony interrupted before Steve could continue, shaking his head and huffing disbelievingly. “Did you arrange all this last night?”
For now, though, he’d enjoy the moment he was currently in. Which included a tantalisingly close Steve Rogers, an achy leg that he needed to remember not to jostle too much, and a late Christmas dinner with his closest friends.
Tony sighed, palming a hand over his face as he stood up. “I’m the world’s leading technology expert,” he grumbled to Peter, propping the little boy up into his arms and reaching up to the condiment cupboard, “I’ve changed society, you know that right? Revolutionised science. This? This is not what I was put on this Earth for, and I want a full-blown apology later, you hear me?”
Of course, he had been hoping to just silently join the table and not make a scene. That had been the plan. But of course, where there was Tony, there was usually Thor, and Thor didn’t exactly go for subtle approaches.
but Tony wasn’t dumb. Of all the things they said to one another- alone and with friends, laughing and joking, when Tony was crying and Steve was curled around him kissing his cheeks and whispering everything he loved about Tony into his ear- it was the things said during arguments were always the bitterest of truths. Steve wasn’t like Tony. He didn’t yell just to yell, spit insults that held no truth to them just to get a reaction. He only ever told people the truth of the matter.
what he was doing. How on earth was Tony supposed to resist that? He was not the only tactical genius in this bed, and Steve was very… persuasive.
“We should kill the bastard where he stands,” Thor gritted, pointing a finger out of the window into the dark New York night, “we should do to him what he did to Tony.”
been there, and Tony had been so blinded with rage and trauma that he was beating into Bucky in a way that might not have been fixable if he caught the wrong place, and Steve couldn’t let Bucky die and he knew that Tony wouldn’t want to kill him, not really—so Steve fought him.
“Come on then, Steve Rogers,” Tony looked down at him, leaning over to grab two of Steve’s bags and hoist them up, “I want ice cream.”
Steve spluttered indignantly, hands going to his hips. “Then- then come over here and make me!” He said, attempting at confrontational.
Steve hummed his acknowledgement and then called off, and a second later Tony heard his front door opening. He turned hastily back to the now-broken coffee cup and its contents, both scattered on the floor at his feet. In order to busy himself with something, he grabbed for the paper towels on the side and then dropped down to start cleaning it, all the while hearing Steve’s footsteps on the tiles as they approached through the hall.
“What are you looking for?” Natasha asked as she watched Tony tug the bot’s collar down a little and pull up his hair.
He needed to get out. Sort his fucking nose out, for starters. Then he could call Tony or something.
He wasn’t sure how long he stayed leaning against the wall before moving, but the fire alarm eventually rocked him out of whatever trance he’d fallen into, and he remembered that the lamb Steve had been making was now burning in the oven. With a curse, Tony stumbled back through the kitchen and yanked it out, cursing when the hot dish brushed his skin. It was charred and shitty. Not that Tony really cared.
“Is there a reason for this, buddy?” Steve asked into his ear, trying not to look at the three hundred faces that were currently staring in amusement at him.
His eyes widened a fraction as the words returned to him, and he drew his gaze back to the man in front of him as he brought back the memory of how his voice had sounded, how his eyes had shone and he’d said
Turning it on slowly, he tapped in his password and then looked over to Tony. “So what did you do?” He asked suspiciously, a small smile playing on his face as he looked down.
He looked up at Steve as he entered, and smiled brightly. “Hey, Steve,” he waved in front of him, and Steve frowned, watching as the multi-coloured slinky went over and over and over, “I just solved the mystery of creating perpetual motion… and guess what I’m using it for?
Yeah. Tony knew. He clenched his jaw and slammed the coffee cup down a little too sharply. The noise resonated. “Yeah, we’re the parents, we’re the ‘mom and dad’, we’re the fucking big happy family now, aren’t we?” He muttered viciously, pouring out a healthy dose of coffee into the mug and then pulling open the fridge with a sharp tug. “Well we’re gonna need to cut that shit out. Peter can’t get overly attached to us, and we shouldn’t be getting overly attached to him either. And we’re not his fucking parents anyway. We all said—we said we’d look after him together—”
“Steve?” He blinked, realising that Clint had asked him a question. When it became clear he hadn’t been listening, Clint repeated, “What are we doing? Going up or going down?”
Steve thought about how it must have gone down. He worked through the timeline in his head, over and over and over again as the road sped underneath his feet and the silence of the car stretched between them. He wasn’t sure when Ty had managed to get in touch with Howard in his poisonous revenge plan, but Steve figured it must have been sometime that afternoon. He wondered what Tiberius said-
, his mind informed him, as if he wasn’t already fucking aware. That had been the thing he’d kept falling back to, every single time he was left alone with his thoughts. This had happened because of him, whether it was intentional or not. He’d made Tony feel like he needed to prove that he wasn’t ashamed of Steve, made him feel guilty about not being as open as he could’ve been—like that even fucking
Meryl Streep. But right now Peter might as well have just recited an extract from Jane Austen by the way Steve was reacting to it. Tony figured that poor Meryl now paled in comparison.
They stormed into the building, Tony hearing Thor confirm his landing not even seconds later. Nat and Clint would be on the other side of the facility, and Tony quickly informed them of the situation. His arms ached fiercely as he lifted his repulsors to fire at the first non-SHIELD uniform he caught sight of, but he didn’t let it slow him. He couldn’t. He was in fight-mode, now.
He’d have to start packing a suitcase of things he wanted to take to the new house Pops would get. And then he’d be one of
Steve smiled, hands wandering underneath the button down and slipping around his waist. “Every time,
“Well, you can thank our friendly visitors for that, “ he heard Tony reply, hands reaching for the pie and then ripping open the lid, “they were the ones who went and sat on the goddamn power grid.”
“Don’t be mean to the computer-man,” Steve said absently, “I’m sure he’s doing his best.” His best was just a little slower than Tony’s average, that was all. They were too used to being spoiled with talent. “Tony’s out at Stark Industries this weekend for business, did he not tell you?”
“Hey, hey, don’t cry,” Thor shushed Peter as he started to get more upset, something pleading in his voice, “please, I thought we were over this. I thought we agreed that crying was no fun. Come on, hey, shall we look at the rain again?” Thor stepped back, but Peter’s wails grew louder at that, and Thor looked at Tony pleadingly, expecting Tony to take him and help him be quiet.
They passed Bruce along the way, and Tony didn’t miss the phone that he had in his hand, filming the two of them with a barely contained look of glee on his stupid face. Tony scowled at him, resisting the urge to tell Steve to attack. It would only induce a Hulk-Out when Steve invariably attempted to kill him, and Tony really couldn’t be bothered dealing with that on top of everything.
“Eurgh, do you two mind? We’re all still present- keep it in the bedroom, please,” Clint threw a pillow at them and they broke away, Tony searching irritably for the stupid little bastard as he rolled quickly over to the shelter of Natasha.
Thor came back, four plates of buttery toast in his hand. Steve had no idea where Loki was, but he got the feeling he wouldn’t be coming down for his portion. Thor probably knew that too, although it didn’t stop him trying. Steve didn’t think he was ever going to give up. “Right, eat quickly,” Thor said as he glanced at his watch, “you’re already late for school, Steve. I’ll drop you off, but you won’t make it for registration.”
Tony laughed again, edged with tiredness and gone too fast. Steve let the conversation die out, just concentrating on the feel of Tony’s warmth; the steady rise and fall of his chest as he breathed.
“Blaming yourself. You had no idea this was going to happen- all you saw was your boyfriend saying he didn’t think you were important enough to worry about. That would be enough to upset anyone. You were perfectly within your rights to walk away.
Steve didn’t say anything, and Tony looked up, squinting from the sunlight on his face. “I’m trying to protect you,” he said casually, fascinated by whatever cloud his eyes were latched on, “because if I don’t, then you’ll end up like me. And I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.”
But Tony was obviously trying to keep a lid on his own amusement; Steve could see him pursing his lips and hunching up his shoulders as he shook his head and looked to the side. He began walking backward leisurely, the unlaced shoe to his left making Steve wince at the hazard. Although it would probably be weird to bring that up. Tony Stark lived by his own rules- he tied his shoelaces for no man.
Tony just looked at him blankly, and eventually Steve sighed in defeat. He keyed the ignition. “Fine. But you’re buying me one of those salted caramel ones while you’re in there.”
Tony groaned again, but allowed Steve to wrap an arm around his waist and pull him up. He took the opportunity to slide his arms around Steve’s shoulders again, mouth on the other man’s neck. “Are you v
He sighed in acknowledgment as he pulled out his wallet and glanced back- where Ty was now in conversation with another person (Zack? Z-something, the one who’d been bullying the Parker kid earlier, anyway), the both of them staring at him with equally dirty looks on their faces. With nothing better to do, Steve just gave them a vague salute and then turned back to the vending machine.
“Hey, shit, are you okay?” Seemingly forgetting their argument all of a sudden, Steve jumped immediately into action, hurrying over with concern on his face as he looked at Tony’s hand gently and picked it up between his own. Tony winced, but just waved it off.
“Oh,” Darcy waved a fork in Sam’s direction and leaned forward conspiratorially, “you know Heather- she’s in one of your science classes I think- but anyway, I found out yesterday that she’s totally trying to score a date with him. All her friends have been talking about it- ‘parently he’s been staring at her during Chemistry for like, three weeks now, and she’s gonna make a move at Sunset’s birthday party this weekend-“
It was only when he was walking out of the doors at the end of the day that he remembered he still had Tony’s jacket in his bag.
Steve opened his mouth, and Tony knew he was gearing himself up for a speech; but the fight seemed to drain from him suddenly, and he shut his mouth with an audible clack again, falling back on to the pillows and closing his eyes.
Okay. Point. Tony rolled his eyes and let his head drop, Steve’s warmth seeping through his bones, relaxing his muscles. He pushed his thumb lightly into Steve’s wrist, starting up another count. They were firm and true, and the steadily-climbing number helped give him something to focus on that wasn’t… everything else.
Steve rolled his eyes, brushing his fingertip across Tony’s eyebrow. “I still think you’re hot, if it’s any consolation,” he said, “I can’t see your eye ‘cause of the swelling, but like, in an attractive way.”
“Hey, you were the one who had the bright idea of turning up wearing his coat like your victory winnings,” she said, pointing an accusing hand over to the black leather jacket in the corner of the room, “I’m pretty sure that’s what made Bucky flip in the end. He thought Stark was showing you off.”
Steve stepped off Tony’s bike twenty minutes later, looking over to Sam’s house and spotting Bucky just as he pulled open the door and glared over to him.
Tony was cut off as Steve skipped over to him and leant down, shutting him up with another kiss. “I love you too, idiot. Now get dressed, or Pepper will literally have my head.”
Oh God. Steve’s stomach plummeting to his shoes. “And I left him there,” he said dumbly, head falling forward into his hand.
Steve stood there, staring at the space the whirlwind of a child had just vacated with a small crease on his forehead. It seemed he’d just been given relationship advice by a pre-teen.
After that, Steve felt like there was no force in the universe that could stop them now. This was a galaxy’s worth of rage, of pain and loss and hurt, coming together to fight. And they didn’t intend to go home as the losers.
Tony doesn’t let go of his hand, though, and Steve has to stop unless he wants to drag Tony along with him.
Yeah. At this point, he was half convinced the man was a literal angel. Bucky said he just needed to go in there and ask for his number, but honestly? Steve was a little terrified of him. God- the man probably had people drooling over him at every chance they got. He was probably already with someone. It would be crazy for him
“What, you think he massacred all these guys and then just went and popped himself back into his restraints?” Tony asked, realising that in his head, he was already sure that this was Steve. Which it might not be. It could be one of those enhanced assets that HYDRA had begun remaking. It could have been a science project gone rogue. Steve wasn’t necessarily even here. Hell, maybe this violence hadn’t even been caused by whatever it was that was still alive in sublevel 5. Maybe that poor guy was the only one who’d made it out with a heartbeat.
“Uh,” Bruce began, “Steve, if you can hear, then we can- uh- we’ll get you some supplies. You probably shouldn’t be going out into the real world right now.”
“Alright, robo-cop, that’s enough of that talk,” Tony groused, cocking his gun and pulling a face. “Hey, babe!” He called over his shoulder.
Tony shook his head, gobsmacked. Steve wasn’t saying that, he didn’t mean it, not really. “No, no, that’s… don’t be stupid, come on—”
“Brilliant,” Steve finished for him firmly, sitting up a little and then tilting his head, “don’t even try and argue it, Stark.”
Bruce frowned. “Try not to,” he said, placing his hand on Tony’s shoulder, “it’s going to come back with time, but until then, we’ll be fine without you. You don’t need to worry.”
He knew Tony wasn't...it was silly to think like that. It was just him overthinking things. Bucky and Peggy putting stupid ideas in his head. Tony liked to keep things private, so what? Steve didn't care. Well... not really, anyway. He knew that he'd definitely love to let the whole world know if he could- Peggy was right about that much, but if Tony was happier being more private with their relationship, then that was fine too.
Thor, looked between them, then gestured awkwardly toward the kitchen. “I’ll just. Uh. Coffee,” he said, eloquently, before ducking out and leaving Steve and Tony to it.
“I’m sure Peter will be on his best behaviour,” Thor assured them, but Tony looked at the God over his shoulder and raised an eyebrow.
There was a pause, and Clint's hands stopped moving. "Huh," he said, shrugging, "then it looks like I'm involved in some sort of prostitution ring, then."
Steve bit his lip and looked down at his now-bare finger. The anger was burning down inside him- that ring wasn’t
“Put all that muscle to good use?” Tony finished, and when Steve nodded, Tony slipped his hand over Steve’s, curling their fingers into one another. “We will, Steve. I promise we will.”
“Sorry,” Rhodey muttered, and his voice was at least a little softer now, slightly sheepish, which was nice. The lines of his body were a bit more relaxed too. “Didn’t think. He really is okay though.”
“Multiple times,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes and a grin, ignoring the way it gave his cheek hell.
Tony side-eyed him. “I know you have. But I’m worried, Steve. You don’t look well. I know that this might be something that hits a little too close to home, or maybe something you’re convinced the serum will fix, but don’t you think you should just go to Bruce and get a professional opinion or something? Just to double-check?”
Tony just wanted to stay in bed with him, and forget about the rest of the world. But, unfortunately, that wasn’t how things worked. Not any more.
“Hey, hey, shhh,” Tony’s arms snaked around his shoulders, pulling Steve’s shaking body up against his own. As much as Steve wished the tremors were faked, they were not. This… this was all true. “It’s okay, Steve. I know. I get it. It’s been—it’s been hell for me too. Every day, I’ve missed you. I didn’t deserve to, and I knew that you’d be better off without me, considering—well—everything that I was doing, but still, I wanted to find you. Apologise. Just see you again.” He curled a hand through Steve’s hair, the motion so familiar and soothing that Steve sunk deeper into Tony’s embrace without even meaning to. Bucky was still on tour with Sam, Peggy was dead and the anniversary would be coming up in a few months, and no one had touched Steve like this ever since he had left Tony the first time round. He wanted to cry and scream and rage and mourn.
Sam nodded, spearing another pancake and then fitting it all into his mouth at once. Steve just watched, rather fascinated. “That can’t be healthy.”
She grabbed his hand and placed a cup of coffee in it. Clint took one second to process, and then uncapped the lid and drained it in six seconds. "Thanks Nat," he said at the end, as Steve just stared incredulously.
“Of course, Sir.” JARVIS sounded mildly amused. “May I suggest now that you make your way up to the nearest source of food? You haven’t eaten since breakfast.”
Tony sighed dramatically and leaned forward, pulling Steve down for a kiss. “Then I better get my work done quick so I can join you, huh?” He mumbled against Steve’s mouth before pulling away and skipping off in the direction of the staircase. “Don’t touch anything potentially lethal!” He called out behind him with a wave of his hand, and Steve rolled his eyes fondly as he yelled back his promise and then watched Tony’s mess of curls slowly disappear down the staircase.
He tasted the smoke curling into his own mouth, bitter and sharp and mixed with the taste of Tony as he pressed softly against the boy’s lips, feeling Tony’s mouth open under his own. His eyes fluttered shut; the fireworks bursting behind his eyelids and sending his heart racing manically- and Steve felt Tony’s hands wrap delicately around Steve’s waist, pull him closer until they were chest to chest, Tony leaning up trying to catch as much of his mouth as he could manage.
Bucky was looking at him solemnly when Steve turned his head to face him, and he could feel Peggy nodding along with her own words on his other side. His own face twisted incredulously. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”
“Do you… do you mean this?” Steve asked softly, his eyes flicking nervously around Tony’s face like he was searching for a tell, “do you really… I thought you seemed pretty- uh- unwelcoming-
“We’re not staying long,” Rhodey said with a small shake of his head, “just stopping by, making a few things clear, you know.”
He was stood by one side of a whiteboard, having what looked to be a pretty heated debate with some other boy on the other end. His marker was flying through the air as he gesticulated wildly, and Steve watched the other gangly boy answer quickly, his own pen scribbling another incomprehensible string of numbers and equation symbols over the already-covered board.
When Tony nodded, Steve took the pen. He sketched a little symmetrical design on the back of Tony’s palm, beginning in the middle and expanding outward. Tony just watched him work, cheek pressed delicately to the pillow. He always seemed so fascinated by Steve’s art—Steve didn’t understand why exactly, but right now, he was just about ready to pander to any of his boyfriend’s whims, so it was hardly a chore for him to do this.
But, surprisingly, it was Tony who broke the silence first. “You were convincing as hell, I’ll give you that,” he said slowly, voice devoid of anything at all, “really had me thinking it was real for a second there. Well done. I wouldn’t have called it. Not you, of all people. You always used to be terrible at lying.”
It was that or sit on their bed and think about the way Tony’s blood had leaked into his lap, or about his eyes, and their vast blankness, void of all the emotion that made Tony the person Steve loved. It was that, or be consumed by the memories until they killed him.
“Really?” Steve asked, widening his eyes a little. In all honesty, he hadn’t actually been thinking Tony would come at all, and yet-
They stayed there for a while; Steve rocking them back and forth as his fingers stroked softly through Tony’s hair. It was difficult to even contemplate- dealing with the loss of not one, but
Tony rubbed his hands together gleefully—which, okay, was probably insensitive, but that phone was the biggest clue they had in regards to Peter’s origins, and after some rather stunning bargaining-slash-blackmail-slash-bamboozlement of poor Federal Recruitment Officers, Tony had managed to snag the thing from the FBI before they’d even gotten the chance to tamper with it. That meant fresh, untouched, beautiful data encryptions and information that would surely lead Tony to finding what he was looking for. It was like being a kid in a damn candy store.
His heart lurched. “I intend to,” he reached out and pulled his jacket off the hook, swinging it around his shoulder, “God help me- I’m on my way, don’t die until I get there.”
When Steve heard about the ship that had settled down over New York—about Tony going missing, presumed dead again, Steve felt like he’d just been gutted.
Tony paused. His hand went back into his pocket, and Steve got ready to stop him again, but he didn’t take it out. Just held onto it under the fabric of his jacket.
“Hey Tony,” he said casually, walking over to him with a smile, “I’m actually pretty late, I can’t stay long-“ he broke off, getting a little closer than perhaps necessary as he stared up at Tony and smiled.
But that was just his emotions talking. That was just the part of him that still loved his fiancé, still wanted to be the man that got to wake up every morning and know he was loved in return. That was the part of him that had never moved on, and probably never would. He couldn’t let that rule over him when so many people were at stake.
“Let’s go to my lab,” Reed walked forward, slowly, nodding his head solemnly over to Susan who was now stood somewhere behind Steve, watching them both with sorrowful eyes, “it will be easier for me to explain things there.” He settled a hand gently on Steve’s arm and attempted a smile. It didn’t work.
“They suit you,” Steve says quietly,and Tony has to question whether or not he’s even conscious at this point, because that was
Steve grinned smugly, pulling his own one over his head. He noted that it wasn’t quite as big as the one he’d worn before. “The best fun is had whilst wearing the appropriate safety gear, Tony, come on.”
“Looking particularly crappy today, Rogers,” Clint breezed, looking up from his cereal to shoot Steve a sharp smile. His eyes were lined with bags, and his hand was shaking; barely visible, but still there.
Without saying another word, he quietly closed their door and crept further in, keeping his footsteps loud to make sure Steve was aware of his presence until he made it to Steve’s side. He quickly sat down beside him, leaning on his elbows and looking down at Steve, who had just pulled his eyes away from the view out of the window in order to look at Tony.
“I’m sure,” Tony told him firmly- and so Steve walked very slowly over to the little plastic chair a few feet away from the hospital bed, and he shrunk down into it, keeping his hands tucked firmly under his thighs. He looked at the floor, and Tony looked at him. He heard the other man open his mouth, try and say something undoubtedly casual and blasé, but then decide against it and shut it once more with a clack.
“Look,” Peter stepped forward, “he thinks he’s this terrible person who only deserves to be surrounded by terrible people, and then when the not-so-terrible people come along, he’s all like, ‘oh fuck I gotta make them go away before I hurt them’, right? So he pushes at you or he says something to you, and you think it’s just him being an asshole because
Steve’s eyebrows raised, and warning bells started to go off in Tony’s head on autopilot, every sense suddenly dialled up to eleven as the supersoldier in front of him unfolded his arms and took a step forward. Before he could advance further though, Tony suddenly jerked and held out a hand. “If you hit me, I’m leaving, I swear to fucking God Steve.”
“Oh, so Steve gets a man and suddenly his best buds’ gotta take the back-burner?” Sam told him from the floor, “I see how it is. What happened to bros before hoes?”
And now, 24 hours later, Tony was here. And he was okay. They’d beaten HYDRA, they’d gotten home, and they were celebrating Christmas, albeit a little behind schedule. Steve was holding his hand
Tony just sighed. “Let’s talk about it in the morning,” he said softly, “I want to go do some work before I sleep. I’ll be back in an hour or two, okay?”
“I have to-“ Steve jerked a thumb behind him and then laughed nervously, and Tony seemed to snap out of it at the same time as him, because he nodded a little nervously and then rammed the helmet back on his head. He didn’t quite hide the red on the back of his neck though.
“I’m just fine right here, Steve,” Tony said, his eyelashes fluttering against Steve’s cheek and his hand reaching out for the cup of what he must have assumed was coffee on the table in front of them. When he took a sip, however, he quickly choked and held back on a gag. Steve realised in amusement that he must have accidentally picked up Steve’s ‘hot chocolate’. “Son of a fucking bitch, what
Tony’s mouth dropped open. His face hurt like a motherfucker, and his eyes were watering from the impact. “Steve,” he began croakily, but the man just waved his hand sharply through the air again. Tony flinched back, just in case- but that one wasn’t meant for him.
“Something like that, yeah,” Thor said with a huff, “what about you, Steve? Where are you headed off so fast?”
Steve poked sullenly at the shitty salad in front of him and then tugged Clint's hat off his head when he sat down, just because.
Behind him, he heard Tony’s footsteps as they shuffled into step with him. “I can’t believe we’ve been dating for less than a day and you’re already hurling insults at me. How upsetting.”
But in reality, all that came out was a sigh, and a moment later his consciousness slipped away, leaving his fate in the hands of his three woefully outgunned friends.
“We leave for two hours,” Tony began sternly, “and look what you’ve done to my team. You’ve got them all wound up and hyper. It’ll take hours for them to settle down and go to bed now.”
Steve grinned, feeling his heart thudding happily in his chest as he reached out for the door. When Tony stopped him suddenly, however, his smile turned confused. “Uh-“
“Yeah, okay, seriously now Steve,” Bucky grabbed his shoulder and looked down at him seriously, “you might wanna not pull on that thread. Maybe go for someone a little less... Disastrous.”
Tony took back all previous apologies he’d made to her while he’d rifled through her phone. He hoped this bitch was rotting in hell.
Steve felt like the universe in all its entirety was pressing down around him. It was one thing to hear it from Natasha. It was another thing entirely to hear it in Tony’s voice, on Tony’s face, looking at a projection of the man he loved while he wasted away on some sort of space-ship in the endless galaxy.
He watched, numb, as Natasha swiftly hurried over to him, her face tight, edged with a desperation he’d only ever seen her show once or twice before. Clint came to stop by Tony’s side, grabbing his arm, saying words Tony couldn’t hear. Steve was gone; probably to check the other floors. Still desperately clinging on to hope that wasn’t even there anymore. Delusion was the more accurate word.
He expected some sort of rebound comment that passed it off, maybe a smile. Thor always seemed to smile. Except today. His face just seemed tight now. Tired. He pulled the spliff back up to his mouth, but just as he was about to purse his lips around it, Steve watched a large drop of rain fall and land directly on the lit end. Thor cursed loudly, looking down at it with a glare so fierce Steve was almost afraid of him for a second.
But when they’d finally gotten enough signal to reach Thor, the God had painstakingly told them he couldn’t leave the scene without putting hundreds of people at risk. And although Tony had wanted to say something stupid, something cruel about how
“Guys!” Clint shouted from the kitchen, dragging their attention away from the scene in front of them as they turned to face him, “don’t know what kind of mother’s meeting is going on in there, but Dinner’s ready, so get your asses over here before Bruce steals it all.”
“I am an AI,” JARVIS corrected, “and I obtained this number through searching Sir’s phone history and selecting a number that I felt would be most helpful in aiding me.” He paused, before adding, “And Thor was not answering his phone.”
“Alright, chill out,” Tony said with a roll of his eyes as he sat down to eat his breakfast. To him, dishes were somewhat inconsequential. Considering the amount of more important things on his never-ending list of things to do, he couldn’t really say he gave much of a damn. “I’ll remember next time.”
He eventually managed to wrangle the kid out of it, and then held him aloft over the bath water, hesitating for a second. “Uh,” he began, “JARVIS, buddy, can you look up—is there a specific way to like… bathe babies?” He felt stupid for asking, but he didn’t want to do it wrong.
Tony hopped onto the counter next to Steve’s side and threw a warm smile over to him, and Steve shook the train of thought away. He didn’t have to worry about that now. “You want some?” He said to the other man, waving to the bread. Tony nodded and so Steve popped another two slices in for him, accepting a kiss on the cheek in gratitude.
They all stopped. Bruce was currently on baby-duty. What with his Hulking tendencies, he didn’t particularly offer much assistance in training exercises. But if they needed him now…
Because that kind of proved things, didn’t it? These people weren’t paparazzi, they were obviously all buddies- family friends, it sounded like. Tony wasn’t trying to protect Steve from anything here.
Steve felt warmth bloom under his sternum and he wrapped himself around Tony, squeezing them both together and sighing happily. In another world, he could just stay here with Tony forever. It was perfect out here, truly perfect. No responsibilities or worries, no aches and injuries, just peace. Miles of field around them, with evening board games and inevitable shouting matches that resulted from it.
He turned his head and looked at Tony, feeling a short-lived wave of anger burn inside him. Tony had ruined lives, and done so guiltlessly. He bragged of his achievements sometimes, while he hacked his way into SHIELD and sent them messages. God, he was building up a weapons collection that was going to be able to level whole
“Well then, I guess finding out I’m now a Private Investigator that just got caught up in a government conspiracy big enough to rock the foundations of the USA forever is gonna be easy for you to digest then?”
a lip bite, and Steve’s eyes keep flickering down toward Tony’s exposed collarbone like there’s a god damn magnet attached to the thing-
Steve felt his nails puncture his own skin. He hated himself so viscerally in that moment that he wasn’t even sure what to do with all the emotion sat on his chest. He wished he could scream. Wished that he could go to a gym and punch something until his hands bled and skin tore. But he couldn’t, because he’d spent months hurting Tony, and Tony had stayed because
“hey, look at it this way—” Steve turned and looked at Loki, who was still hovering at the sidelines, leaning against the counter, “he was alright enough to get here. He’s still conscious. If it were a severe concussion, he wouldn’t have been able to do that. At least he’s coherent enough to understand us. Suggests that it’s probably only a mild to moderate one.”
Tony kissed Steve on a Wednesday, the same night that he told the man to stop the surveillance for Bucky.
“You can and you will,” Tony said sharply, pushing him back once more and then standing up jerkily, rushing over to his wardrobe and then throwing out all the contents until he found a decent suit. He looked manic, but his eyes were empty- completely unlike what Steve had been experiencing barely even two minutes beforehand.
Before Tony could even properly wake, Steve hissed down at him, “I think your dad’s back early, shit, what do we d-“
Palming a hand over his eyes, he looked at his clock on the bedside. Since walking off and then moping around, it had been about an hour since he’d left Tony. He should probably call- at least apologize for just walking off like that.
That left Tony, Steve, Natasha and the LMD, which currently appeared to be kicking Natasha’s ass into the nearby wall. He moved at lightning speed, each move calculated and perfectly executed, not flagging or feeling any of the pain that came from the blows raining down on him. Tony was no use in hand-to-hand here; hell, Steve and Natasha combined were barely able to hold the thing back.
It wasn’t going to happen, and Steve had long since learned to accept that, but still. Sometimes, he really did just wish that there weren’t so many things out in the universe trying to kill them.
exactly Tony managed to retrieve the voicemail, and Steve had promised not to let anyone know about what sort of things his brain could do, so he had to remain silent.
“I know,” was all he said, and then without another word, he pulled the door open and made his way out of the building.
He stilled when Tony’s hand moved to cup around his face, a thumb brushing over the warmth of his cheek. “I really do love that blush,” he said quietly, head cocking to the side a little like he always did when he analyzed Steve. He just let himself watch- the way Tony’s eyes flicked minutely over each area of his face, how his lip twitched in amusement. There was a second of silence, and then Tony dropped his hand, blinking out of the little haze he’d just found himself caught in. “Okay. Seriously. Food. Now.”
They both glared at one another for a moment, before Loki’s lip curled bitterly. “You don’t know a single fucking thing, Rogers,” he said with a shake of his head, “you didn’t have to grow up with my brother as your constant shadow. You didn’t have to be treated like second-best when compared to him. All you saw was poor little Thor, sad because his brother doesn’t love him, yet you never wondered why?” He stood from the armchair, glancing at his watch with a chuckle before looking back to Steve. “Well, it’s been a fun three minutes. But I feel as if I’m not wanted here, so I’ll just—”
In response, Steve showed Tony his forearm. It looked pretty normal, however, and so Tony glanced back at Steve. “Why are you showing me your arm?”
At that moment, his phone began buzzing again. Steve jumped, the tune ringing out loudly in the percussive silence of the hall, but took it to his ear a moment later. “Okay, so how do I navigate your house?”
He also could well have been working on Iron Man upgrades when he’d come out to meet Steve. That was an important thing to remember. Tony Stark was a terrorist. Steve was here to extract information.
,” he stormed on, “this weird orb thingy is, as far as I can tell, what was responsible for their hive-mind functions. I’m not sure how they managed to meld an entire army to it, but there you go. Possibly some sort of registry that only they were attuned to. It’s difficult to work it out when I’ve got no aliens left to ask. But from the effects we saw on the army themselves, it was pretty... violent. Lots of rage in those guys. The Hulk didn’t like the way they howled.”
The droning voice of the math teacher buzzed in the room, sending Steve further and further into sleep. He rolled his eyes and then let his head drop into his arms, pencil making useless strokes in the margin of his book. The clock told him only ten minutes had passed- but he felt as if he’d been doing this for about eight years, give or take.
The whole of his left side was a mess. His eye swollen shut, butterfly stitches spanning from jaw to temple. His nose was puffy, looked like it had been broken, and his bottom lip was painfully split open. Wherever Steve looked, there was an injury. Whatever oxygen he’d been managing to take in got stuck in his throat as he stared at Tony, gobsmacked.
“I know,” Steve said quickly, his hands wrapping around Tony’s back, holding him close, “and I know we have this conversation every time one of us gets hurt. It just…”
It was what Tony needed. Steve had been so selfish, ignoring his calls. Now he had to make up for it while he still could.
“Then we find them,” Steve’s voice permeated his ears, a hand settling on Tony’s leg, steadying him. Tony glanced up at him, saw the resolve and angry determination in Captain America’s eyes. “We find them and we get them safe. We will, Tony. You know we will.”
Steve smiled smugly at Tony and then hopped off the table. “Thank you, Doc,” he said with a nod, gently taking the hand away from his chest and then clasping it into his own as he began to pull Tony out of the room with him.
He really didn’t need to ask- he speedwalked as calmly as he could over to Steve and then pressed a gentle hand against his neck as JARVIS confirmed what he’d just felt. “49 beats-per-minute, sir.”
“Yeah, so I’ve been told,” he responded, making an effort to release the tension in his forehead. Steve looked him over analytically, before pursing his lips and dropping the jello cup down on Tony’s lap. Tony grinned. “Thanks.”
“Not like this it isn’t!” Tony argued, hearing as Peter began to whine a little bit in his arms as he reacted to their tense voices. He looked down and then made an effort to relax, keeping his voice calm. “Steve, they don’t know how to handle this. You’ve heard the horror stories about vulnerable kids getting paired off with abusive parents who can’t handle the fact their kids aren’t ‘normal’. We… there’s gotta be another way.”
Tony’s brows knitted together, looking over at Steve. His shoulders were tight, eyes on his own hands as he bit his lip. Nervous habit. “You don’t feel afraid touching me,” he said, before pausing. “You don’t, right?”
Maybe Tony was just the exception, because that was the sort of treatment he deserved. Only way to handle him properly, right? And it was effective. Tony tended not to argue with Steve lately, just to avoid potential conflict.
Tony’s face paled, and he spluttered a few times before shaking his head and shutting his eyes. “Jesus Christ, I can’t- Barnes, I swear, don’t make me tell him, I don’t want to do that-“
Steve grimaced and he tensed, mouth opening to respond with something scathing- but before he even could, there was suddenly a shadow across his side, and looked up to see Thor sidling up to them both. His face was hard.
But he’d just… he’d been tired. And upset. And he’d thought it would be okay, just for the night. Just that once, he’d thought they might just leave him alone and let him rest. He
Steve gaped, looking at his book and then realizing that Tony was infuriatingly correct. “Shut up,” he muttered, pushing him in the shoulder and then grabbing his hand before he could tumble off his seat, “and sit on four legs. Chairs are designed like that for a reason.”
Steve laughed gently, cheeks flushed pink as they both shuffled silently back to bed. With the care of someone handling a petri dish full of lethal bacteria, Tony delicately placed the sleeping baby back onto the couch cushions, tucking a blanket around his small body and then sitting back. He turned to Steve with an exhausted smile. "Good job," he commended, "Cap to the rescue, just like I said, see?"
He brushed his teeth tiredly, slumping against the sink and checking the weather for the day as he spat and turned on the faucet. He didn’t have work that day, so he could get away without doing his beard, but he quickly took out the tweezers and plucked a few hairs off his eyebrows all the same, just for upkeep. He really needed to call Paul in, see if he could fit Tony in for another dye-
Tony huffs, because really, he’s a grown man, he shouldn’t find being carried like this so comforting. But Steve’s got a nice chest, and it’s easy to just bury his head into the shirt he’s wearing and soak up the warmth and the beat of his heart.
He jerked his head to Rhodey, instantly seeing the dark clothes and smart dress and early morning and solemn faces and remembering, oh God, he remembered how his teacher had called him out of class that day 6 months ago with the same face,
Catching the look, Tony managed to smile. “We’ll finish when you get back,” he promised, “now go, save the world or whatever.”
. And yeah, okay, maybe throwing his breakfast away had been a little stupid of him, and that food could easily have gone somewhere else, but-
“I just-“ Natasha began, voice uncharacteristically subdued as she briefly cut herself off. Tony spared a glance back around at her, and saw the way her lips were tightly pursed. She looked right at him, solemn and downright
“Hey, dude, you passed my test,” Bucky butted in with a shrug of his own, leaning over to them both, “anyone who’s as absolutely willing as you were to start fighting the moment they thought Steve’d been wronged in any way is my type’a person.”
“Thor,” Bruce said soothingly, a hand going to Thor’s shoulder, but the God wasn’t finished. He stood in his fury, tears slipping down his cheeks. He was the only one who seemed to know how to express his emotions. Steve couldn’t even look at him. There was something terrible beginning to lurch in his stomach, a tension forming over each line of his body. He could feel Tony's weight in his arms. The memory of his empty face was inescapable.
“Steve.” Tony clamped down on his shoulder, his face serious. “Believe me, the US military wouldn’t dare touch me. What was it that you were investigating?” He was staring at Steve like the fate of the world rested on his next words; like this meant more to Tony than just getting an answer. Probably because it was relevant to Tony’s interests, what with his own plan to raid the same base.
but unlucky for me, life doesn’t agree. So sorry I’m not gonna be present this week, but believe me, it’s for the best.”
died- I just feel like it’s all around me. There’s no escape.” He sighed, but then pulled back and took Tony’s face in his hands. The gentle pressure of Steve’s palms against his cheeks was what finally got Tony to pull his eyes open- and when he did, Steve’s delicate smile greeted him. Home.
Clint’s face was tight, and he hunched in himself a little as he nodded. “Yeah, guess you’re right,” he said gruffly, “shall we call ‘em, then?”
He glanced over to his friend and then huffed irritably. "Yeah, you are. Anyway, how did this become about me and Tony? I thought we were consoling Peggy over her shitty date?"
“This?” Tony said softly, flicking a hand toward his body, “this is not your fault, Steve. You didn’t make me tell Ty to shove his head up his ass. You didn’t force me to stick around and take all that time putting JARVIS into that console. You didn’t tell Howard to hit me, and you didn’t tell me to just sit there and take it like a fucking bitch—”
“Yes I do.” Steve nodded firmly, and atop his head, the ears jiggled with enthusiasm. It might have been funny, had Tony any brain power left to expend upon the sight. “You made a mistake, you said some things that hurt me. But then I refused to try and resolve anything, and rather than explaining things to you in a calm manner and letting you arrive at your conclusion in a healthy way, I walked off and left you to stew in all those thoughts of yours. And that was my mistake. I… I forget that you’re not like everyone else, Tony. I forget that you would actually listen to me, and I’m sorry for that.” Steve seemed genuinely earnest when he said it, and that in itself was enough to make Tony feel like his cognitive functions were going into meltdown. He had about a dozen different hormones buzzing through him right now, his body’s preparation for the inevitable sadness, and now they had nowhere to go. Because apparently the events of this night were not ones that would end with a breakup.
His eyes lifted a little, unable to stop searching for that recognizable face amongst the hundreds. He knew Tony was in that day; his bike had been parked in its usual place in the parking lot- but so far he’d had no luck in locating the person who drove it. He was distracted a second later anyway, as someone to his left bumped him as they passed. He barely hid the hiss of pain as his aching rib let him know it wasn’t happy with the contact. Although it wasn’t a serious break and would probably stop aching so bad in a week or so, it was still going to be a dick to live with for the next few days of school.
Steve frowned and placed his hand protectively against the bot’s claw where he imagined the little guy’s ears might have been. “I think he can do whatever he puts his mind to, right bud?” He asked cheerily, and then laughed as the robot gave a few beeps of happiness. It seemed he was so happy, in fact, that he forgot what his original task was, and instead of picking up the knife he merely placed his entire claw into the centre of the sandwich, essentially mushing it into a heap. Steve looked down at it whilst Tony just cackled. “Okay. Well maybe we can just play some fetch for now, huh?”
Ugh. Tony must be getting mellow in his old age, because he couldn’t even think of a decent response to that, too caught up in how much he fucking loved the big lug sat beside him. Ever since the idea had popped into his head nearly a week ago, all he’d been thinking about was how goddamn much Steve meant to him. How good they were together. They cancelled out the bad stuff about one another and enhance the good, and God, Tony wanted to be his husband so badly it hurt. Tony Stark-Rogers. Rogers-Stark? Nah, that sounded weird. But then, so did Steve Stark-Rogers. Maybe it could be Tony Stark-Rogers and Steve Rogers-Stark, that sounded better.
And God, Tony wanted Peter to be part of that reality. That was the worst part. He couldn’t see this amorphous ‘Steve & Tony Start A Family’ bullshit without Peter being there too. It was all so tragically pathetic of him. And now his plan to back out and try to cut ties had fallen through thanks to Steve’s irritatingly sound logic, and so Tony couldn’t even take measures to prevent the inevitable fallout. He was just going to have to watch the deadline come steadily closer and resign himself to his fate.
Steve had been planning to start a rather large and rather dangerous fight in said bar- and he did, in fact, end up fulfilling that goal- but for a rather different reason. See, it just so happened that Steve’s target ended up being the one with his hand circled just tight enough around Tony’s wrist for him to start looking uncomfortable, and really, that had been all Steve needed. A quick slamming of his head into a table had done the job- and after that, the fight had mainly just carried itself. With a quiet word and a gentle hand against the small of Tony’s back, he’d quickly led them both out of the fight.
“You know he won’t do shit if you just don’t finish it, right?” Tony asked him from across the room, nursing a coffee filled with a little more alcohol than he cared to admit. There was a reason for both their presences at the dinner table at 3am in the morning, after all- and it wasn’t because their dreams had been filled with too much fun.
at knowing Tony was okay, that he may possibly have felt a little more deeply for the man than just friendship. Looking back, it was obvious that it had been like that from the very beginning. Steve had friends here, he had colleagues. The rest of the Avengers had taken Steve’s lead after a while and come to live in the tower too, and so Steve had ended up finding a strange sort of kinship in all of them. He loved them, and he cared for them deeply.
Bruce didn’t actually say anything—he just glared a hole through the wall, chest moving up and down as he breathed heavily. For the first time, Steve saw the temper that Tony had warned him of once—almost powerful enough to equal Steve’s own just then, which was saying something. He’d taken out that guy like it was nothing, which was the last thing he’d ever expected from someone like Bruce Banner.
