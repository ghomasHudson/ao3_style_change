“Well I would say it’s more the money and less the suit. I don’t see anyone kissing my ass for fame.”
“—drinks are so good!”
They shared a final glance before walking on towards their friends.
Steve laughed and replied, “No, you need to take a shower and we both should eat something.”
Steve grinned and said, “Of course. I’d follow you to the end of the world. Also, does that mean I get to see you in a tux?”
He must have fallen asleep, because he woke up to Steve carrying him into bed. As soon as Steve put him down in the bed, he jumped up and walked to the big chair that was in their - his, really - bedroom and sat down. Steve gave him a puzzled look and came to squat down in front on Tony, bringing them to eye level.
Tony smiled gratefully at him and nodded, “Yeah, bye.”
Our couple goes to a gala. Drama, fluff, and shenanigans ensue.
Steve woke up to see Tony curled up next to him. He smiled and knowing that this was where Tony felt safe, he laid still, wrapping an arm around the sleeping Avenger. A couple minutes later, Tony woke up and Steve pecked him on the cheek. “Morning.”
“Ummm…”
Tony inwardly groaned when the mob of people came up to surround him as soon as he got inside. He glanced around for Steve or Pepper but they had vanished. Dammit! After he had said hello to as many people as he could stand, he wandered over to the bar and ordered a drink. Three women came over and he groaned inwardly.
“Tony.”
She gripped his arm and her fake nails dug into his skin through his clothes.
“Yeah, yeah, the food at these events is terrible.”
Tony led Steve away towards a table where Steve could spot Pepper sipping on a drink. “Thank you Steve. She just wouldn’t take a hint.”
Steve laughs, his arms coming up to firmly bracket Tony’s hips. Tony leans over to straddle him on the couch, his eyes sparkling.
It’s a solid plan, a good plan, so Steve has no idea why he’s feeling on edge about it. He keeps his eyes fixed on the huge screen in front of them, absentmindedly registering the way his fingers keep tapping the desk in front of him, and how he keeps shifting his seat every few seconds. It’s a simple enough plan, and he knows that both Tony and Natasha are more than capable of taking care of themselves even if it does go sideways.
“Like what?”
“I didn’t.” Steve moans softly as Tony’s lips start drifting down his chest, leaving a trail of firm kisses. “But I still think we should let Clint walk in on us,” he adds.
Tony’s voice.
Steve grins up at her and does as she says, holding out a hand for support as she settles herself gingerly on the step beside him. “As milady wishes.”
“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable and god, Steve, just tell me how I can fix this. I don’t want to lose you.” Tony’s voice has now taken on a pleading note, and Steve aches at the sound.
Steve takes a deep breath. “Sort of. Yes, I think. I’m in love with Tony and I want to tell him right now.”
Steve scrolls further down. Another picture shows them laughing while shoving cake in each other’s faces. The next one is a blurry shot of Clint’s arm around Tony’s shoulders. Steve’s heart twinges as he reads on about an inside source claiming that Hawkeye and Iron Man are very much in love and excited to tell the world about their relationship.
How sometimes just looking at Tony sends Steve’s heart beating in double time, to how much he likes having Tony in his arms, and how much he likes it when Tony looks to him for reassurance and when he remembers little details about Steve, and how happy spending time together with Tony makes him.
Steve runs a hand through his hair, his face heating. “When you offered to pose for me, I ran away because I thought you’d be able to tell what I was thinking and feeling just from looking at me, and when you had to strip out of the armor because of the frog slime—” Steve breaks off and swallows hard. “I think about you all the time.”
“Not if it’s about that prank war you and Clint are organizing against Johnny Storm.”
“We’re not together,” Tony repeats, sounding breathless, and Steve’s heart leaps in his chest as he recognizes the glowing, warm expression on Tony’s face as hope. “Did you think… Is that why you…”
“I think Nat knows about us.”
A hot flare of protective anger wells up in Steve, and he nudges Tony’s shoulder gently, wishing he could offer Tony any sort of comfort.
“Did I design this based on your sketches? Yeah, pretty much. I found them a few months ago, and that’s when I started working on the design. Do you like—”
“Mmm…I swear to god, those hands of yours are magic.”
“Anytime, Cap.” As always, Tony’s voice is modulated by the armor’s speakers, but Steve imagines he can hear a smile in Tony’s words.
“I like the sound of that.” Tony agrees, muffling Steve’s laughter with a kiss.
“I know, honey. That’s okay.”
“You know, Steve? Jan was right, you really are good at this.” Foggy glances up from scribbling a few notes on the margins of his sketches and shoots Steve a smile. “I honestly can’t thank you enough. And you have excellent opinions on hobbits and Star Wars.”
He takes one long look at Tony, noting the minute details - the sweep of Tony’s eyelashes against his cheek, the sharp jut of his chin, the movement of his throat as he tosses back another sip of whisky from his flask before leaning against Jim with a grin. Steve bites his lip and puts pencil to paper for one more try, pressing very lightly on the page.
“I don’t want to dance with—” Something in Steve’s expression makes Tony’s face fall, and Steve almost regrets turning down his offer.
Nat moves over to press a kiss into his hair before resting her head on his shoulder. “I’m glad you have this now, Steve.”
“Hmmm.” Tony watches Steve visibly bite back a response before reaching up to adjust the
“I know, Steve. Jan told me.”
He spends the day curled up under a pile of blankets and watching romcoms, failing to distract himself from thinking about Tony.
“It’s almost five. We could go get some pizza in an hour?” Jan suggests. She’s sitting cross legged on Steve’s bed, squinting with concentration at the sketchbook in front of her, surrounded by a wide array of fancy highlighters.
Steve’s hands are still braced on Tony’s hips, and a small part of him thrills at the intimacy of it. It was only after they had taken this new step in their relationship that Steve had realized just exactly why he’d felt Tony’s absence so keenly when the team had disbanded. Even after months of having Tony in his arms, in his bed, getting to have him like this feels new.
Tony’s pretty damn sure Steve knows he’s standing in front of him, but Steve’s eyes don’t move from his book. He licks his thumb before turning to the next page, and Tony feels the back of his neck turn hot.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart.”
Foggy chuckles and shakes his head. “I got a little ahead of myself there, huh? But no, I don’t think I will be.” Steve watches as he bites his lip and glances back at Matt, looking utterly besotted.
Death shifts, and suddenly she is looming over him.
These days, all he draws when he picks up his pencil is Tony. Tony,  half-asleep in the morning, looking bleary-eyed and unfairly adorable, Tony working on new versions of the Iron Man suit, Tony gesturing at JARVIS with a wrench in his hand, looking outraged, Tony at a party…
“Well, I’m definitely not going to turn that down.”
Nat hums a sound of agreement from behind a large pile of books on Steve’s desk. Bucky tears his attention away from his and Sam’s impromptu thumb war to add a “God, yes please” to the idea.
“...Tony, we were patched into the team comms.”
Across from him, he sees Tony’s smirk widen and Sharon raises her red cup to him in salute. It’s her turn to set the dare, and Steve knows she’s not going to waste her chance. Thor beams and raises his own glass to Steve. “A fair choice, Captain!” he exclaims.
He wants to take care of Steve.
“Kiss me first, and I’ll consider it.”
Most likely he’d end up on the sidelines, watching Tony in the arms of a different suitor for every dance, and while Steve’s never really been one for dancing himself, the thought of Tony turning on his effortless charm for interested partners leaves a sour, bitter taste in his mouth.
Steve’s face brightens at this, a soft, happy grin stretching across his face that Tony sees far too little of, one that always makes him feel like Steve is giving him something precious, something just for the two of them. “You think so?” he asks.
. They had probably doubted whether Steve could survive a mission without collapsing or losing a limb, but he’s proven that he can pull his own weight, and the editors have been more than happy with the visuals he’s provided for new issues over the past few months.
“In case you haven’t noticed, Captain Rogers, I’m very good at providing favorable distractions.”
That’s not the only thing he dreams of.
“No, it’s fine, Steve, don’t worry. I know exactly what you mean. I didn’t really get how romance and dating worked for the longest time, and I still don’t, really.”
“Did I?”
“I love you too,” Tony says, and
“Not planning to,” Steve tells him, knowing that Tony will read the honesty of it in his face.
Maybe Tony doesn’t feel the same way, but there’s also a chance that he does. Steve doesn’t want to be chasing what-ifs for years to come.
Steve watches the edge of Tony’s mouth as it turns up in a grin, shoving aside the very strong and sudden urge to lean over and kiss the corner of it and run his hands through Tony’s hair.
“I don’t have–”
“I thought that was the idea,” Steve purred in his ear, twisting his wrist in a move that both collected the precum dripping from Tony’s rigid cock and ratcheted the tension an order of magnitude higher.
Steve just looked amused. He reached between them and finished rolling the condom on. “You do know these only work if they’re all the way on, right?” he teased.
She glared at him for a long moment. “You are not as charming as you think you are.”
On the screen, JARVIS warned him in all caps:
“Just collecting data,” Tony said, his own voice shuddering as Steve rocked down on him slightly faster now.
Tony shrugged, hoping the action didn’t look half as flaily as it felt. “More to see if it was actually on the table or if, y’know, this was all just campaign gimmicks.”
Tony strode up to the door and gave a grin to the agents guarding it.
Tony watched as the TV continued showing Steve’s reaction to the results. He was pulling out of a tight hug with the long haired staffer from earlier. Who happened to be sporting one of Tony’s own second generation cybernetic arms. Huh. So that’s who that guy was. Tony would have to look into hooking him up with an update soon. It would be a travesty for the next president’s best friend to be walking around with an antique.
It didn’t mean anything. It didn’t.
“Then why do you do things?”
Tony wasted no time in tearing open the packet and rolling the condom onto himself, but stopped midroll about halfway down his cock when Steve propped one leg up on the bed, Captain Morgan style, and dribbled lube onto his fingers. He smirked at Tony as he slowly began fingering himself open. The man was on full display and Tony could see
“What are you doing here?” Steve asked, glancing down the hall as though he expected a camera crew to be hiding somewhere along it. A rivulet of sweat ran down the side of his neck. Tony swallowed and forced his attention back to Steve’s face.
Steve blushed. “Please do not sext me on national television.”
Tony made a show of being shocked. “You’re drinking while in uniform. Are you allowed to drink while in uniform? Aren’t you on the job? I am shocked, Honeybear. Absolutely shocked.”
“I’ll see you on the other side.”
Steve’s blush deepened and spread to his chest even as he shook his head in good-natured denial. Tony admired the flush with a smile. His stomach flipped over, then did it again for good measure. To think he got to have this, to have Steve. He was actually giddy at the thought. Him, Tony Stark, giddy. The world must be ending, and those bastards hadn’t even warned him about it in his daily security briefing.
“Fuck off,” Rhodey said cheerily and took a sip of his not apple juice.
“Nothing shady, I promise,” Tony said, raising his hands to show he was unarmed.
Tony started to pout, but then Steve was laying himself out on the other side of the bed, open and welcoming, and Tony promptly forgot about anything other than how hot he looked.
“So no change in behavior, then,” Steve said with that perfect straight man face he had.
Fuck, this man was perfect.
It’d been too long, and Steve was too hot, and even dry this was all gonna be over way too soon if Tony didn’t redirect them this very second.
He couldn’t wait to find out what would happen next.
One of the election night preshows babbled to itself on the TV in the corner; a laptop set up at the desk showed a muted news show from a different network, the captions out of joint with the hosts’ mouths.
“Because it’s the right thing to do.”
Of course the Rogers/Wilson Campaign had rented out floors of a hotel in Brooklyn for election night. It was exactly the sort of sentimental thing Steve would do for what would be the biggest night of his life.
“Yeah, well.” Tony shrugged. “He’s an assclown.”
Tony let Steve take full control as they maneuvered their way through the door leading to the suite’s bedroom and over to the bed itself. He buried his hands deep into Steve’s hair as the kiss got more heated, as they tripped out of their shoes and the rest of their clothes fell to the floor. Tony tore his mouth away with a gasp as Steve actually picked him up and threw him on the bed.
“Workout gear. Gotta say, not what I was expecting,” Tony said with a theatrical leer as he slid his phone back into his pocket.
Steve’s eyes darkened further as he nodded. Tony couldn’t help it; he kissed him again, wet and open-mouthed. Steve moaned.
“You’ve admitted in multiple interviews that the primary reason you joined the race in the first place was to prevent him from winning the Republican nomination.”
Tony scooted somewhat inelegantly further up onto the bed so he was actually laying across most of it at an angle instead of the awkward half-sitting, half-laying down thing he’d been doing before. Steve followed, anticipating his movements and distracting him with little nips to Tony’s bottom lip.
Tony shook the hands of some of his own senior campaign staff, thanking them for all their hard work. On the TV, Steve still hadn’t checked his phone. Tony tried not to let it get to him. There was no reason to give in to total despair just yet. Steve might not even have his phone on him. Bizarre as that concept was, some people did do that. It was good to have a little perspective about these things. Just because Tony had seen him move to answer it earlier didn’t mean he actually had it on him. Maybe someone had pinched his butt and that was why he had jerked like that. It was possible. Unlikely, but totally possible.
Tony’s stomach swooped. “Is that so?”
“You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me,” the staffer said. The man had a killer glare on him.
“I didn’t want to skew the results before the majority of the votes were in. No sense tempting accusations of election fraud. Or fate.”
There was a pause of a small eternity before,
“LGBT crowd loves you a lot more than it does me.”
Tony pulled away, gasping, to look at it. His phone was not set to beep. It was not set to make any noises at all.
“I’d say your standards are skewed, but we already knew that,” Rhodey said, bumping Tony’s arm with his elbow.
“We knew that already,” Steve said, glancing up at Tony through his criminally long eyelashes. Tony’s heart skipped a beat. “The bigger question is how the rest of the country will vote.”
Tony gripped her by the shoulders and forced her to look at him, one of the only ways he knew to stop her ranting without blowing something up.
Tony’s phone went in his pocket and he immediately started walking to meet Pepper halfway across the room. If he had a little more spring in his step than a freshly defeated wannabe politician should, well, no one needed to know the particulars of why. It wasn’t a matter of national security after all, just the result of one of the most crushing, exhilarating nights of his life.
“Of the room? No. No, I don’t mind that at all. Probably best you don’t walk me out of the hotel, though.”
“Slander and lies, Ms. Potts. Slander and lies,” Tony said breezily, accepting a glass of something golden from a passing staffer. Apple juice. Cute. He mentally shrugged and drank it anyway.
“Are you trying to get this over with quickly?” Steve asked, his voice a deeper rumble than usual.
“Anyone who looks at you is gonna know exactly what you were up to,” Steve said, looking Tony up and down with a proud, appreciative glint in his eye. Tony barked out a laugh and sauntered over.
Every time their tongues touched, Tony felt a jolt of electricity run through him straight to his groin. Every time Steve’s hands moved to grope a new part of Tony’s body, the muscles in his arms would bunch and flex under Tony’s hands, making Tony’s knees just that little bit weaker. He clung to Steve, and Steve practically growled in response.
Steve returned quickly, his erect cock bobbing obscenely in front of him as he took the travel sized bottle of lube and strip of condoms out of Tony’s jacket. The jacket was thrown somewhat carelessly over the back of a chair as Steve raised an amused eyebrow at Tony and held up the condoms.
Steve though, Steve wanted it. He’d worked for it, planned for it for years. Tony’s heart still clenched when he thought about the interview Steve gave in which he’d admitted to making a deal with himself while he was still in the army: if he survived, he’d run for public office to fight for Veterans’ rights, to fight for more options for kids like him and his friend, Barnes, who lost his arm to an IED after two tours in Iraq. Steve’s voting record showed nothing but goodwill and follow through on all counts.
He reached a hand down to close over Steve’s wrist. Steve, to his credit, stopped jerking him off instantly.
“Can I come in?”
“As long as I win California,” Tony said casually, scrolling through data that technically hadn’t been released to the public yet.
Steve sped up, his pecs bouncing up and down in time with his movements. It was almost obscene to look at, ridiculous in the best way possible. Tony half wanted to laugh in disbelief, but he’d learned a long time ago not to laugh during sex unless his partner was laughing too. Still, it was a mesmerising sight.
. And what a sight it was. Tony couldn’t decide if he wanted to reach out and touch, or lay back and enjoy the show.
Steve grinned. “That was the idea.”
“I thought you had a plane to catch,” Steve said, trying to put on his serious politician face. His eyes were twinkling, though, ruining the effect. So were the patriotically-themed boxer briefs he pulled on from nowhere, which Tony was absolutely not going to laugh at.
Steve fingered himself with his whole body, abs tensing and releasing, pecs bulging and flexing as he moved his fingers in and out. And all the while, his cock bobbed in the open air, less than a foot away from Tony’s face.
“Probably,” Steve agreed. He looked a little sad about that, and Tony hid a grin. He wouldn’t ruin this, he wouldn’t.
The confirmation settled in Tony’s stomach like lead. Even knowing the probabilities of what the numbers would say in advance, knowing his math was right, he still felt disappointed. He pasted on a smile and turned to Pepper and Rhodey, who both wore expressions of mixed disappointment and relief. Pepper was the first one to fold him into a hug.
Tony moved in that direction, only half focussed on the continuing info dump of his best friends as he scanned all the information. Then he did a double take at what he saw on one of the screens.
Tony almost choked on the air he was breathing, and then another text came through:
“Really?” she sniffled, less disgustingly this time.
“Just for that, I’m gonna sext you when the election’s called.”
“Steve?” Tony asked, moving gentle hands up to comb through Steve’s sweaty locks. “You still with me?”
Challenge clearly accepted.
three times before he finally just sent it.
“Per electoral vote. Whichever of us wins gets more, obviously, but whoever loses gets a blowjob per electoral vote too.” His tongue darted out to lick his bottom lip. He looked nervous again.
“Don’t you already know, Mr. ‘I created an algorithm that’s already predicted the winner down to the district level’?” Steve snarked, shooting Tony a wicked smirk that made Tony’s dick consider going another round.
“Well, it pays to be prepared.”
He sluggishly slapped at Steve’s shoulder in an uncoordinated attempt to pet him.
“This isn’t something worth crying about,” he said. “I mean, in private, sure, whatever you need to do, but in public like this? It’s just kind of . . . embarrassing.”
“No, seriously,” Tony said, “you’ve already surpassed my top ten and we haven’t even gotten to the main feature yet. You’re unreal. Like a porn star straight out of some do-gooder’s wet dream . . . .”
He laid on his back, spread eagle with one arm blocking out the sun from his eyes. He won’t cry he told himself sternly it wasn’t like he actually lost anything, he was still friends with Tony and their friendship was as perfect as it always was. Even if Tony no longer had feelings for Steve, they were still friends, Steve still had that.
“If you had a tail, it would be wagging so hard right now”, a voice said from behind him and he jumped, almost dropping his lunch.
. But he was struggling to picture Tony with anyone he knew except the garbage excuse of a human being that was Tiberius Stone.
He imagined kissing all of them one by one and was surprised to find that he wasn’t bothered at all by the thought of kissing Ben or Adam, he was in fact quite the opposite of bothered and it wasn’t any different from Bernie or Emily. Peggy was a bit different because he loved her and had experienced the kissings first hand.
Steve supposed that made sense. Loki had the same reckless curiosity that comes with being a genius and Steve had witnessed Tony and Bruce doing various experiments out of that same curiosity.
Steve’s heart thumped merrily in his chest, so happy that Tony was not ignoring him, beckoning him and patting the chair next to him (Steve’s usual seat).
Oh god what had he done. He put his palms over his eyes, trying to block out the onslaught of emotions, he groaned in despair. He can fix this, he can. He had to, he can’t lose Tony over this.
He then had planned to tell Tony first thing in the morning which also didn’t work out. Steve was frustrated now, how hard was it to get Tony alone to tell him about his feelings (extremely hard apparently).
“Okay that’s fine Steve” Sam said neutrally without any hint of judgement in his tone and Steve felt relief coursing through him. But he still had a question.
They wrestled, Steve trying to pin Tony down while the smaller man actively tried to punch, bite and kick any part of Steve he could reach. He struggled but he was finally able to pin both of Tony’s hand over his head, flushed and panting. Tony was still angrily trying to buck Steve off of him but it was impossible because Steve was much bigger and stronger.
Going on a date with Billie was fine to an extent but neither of them were interested in anything more and now they just greet each other in the hallways or in class when they see each other.
He vaguely recognized the guy from Tony’s study group which was just a bunch of genius students brainstorming about their ridiculous and frankly alarming ideas. Peter Parker was the youngest member with Bruce, Jane, Loki, Reed Richards and Charles Xavier probably encouraging his outlandish theories.
He wanted to laugh, it had been over two months and he still haven’t managed to do that. Evidently, Tony’s feelings for him had just been a stupid crush seeing how fast he got over him. Steve was just so tired of feeling his heart break every time he see Tony with Lehnsherr, laughing at his stupid jokes and taking all of Tony’s attention.
Tony rarely ever talk about his family except to Pepper and Rhodey, both of whom had known him for much longer. But the little that he shared had always been with Steve.
Steve grinned, he could hardly wait for breakfast to be over so they could rush back to Tony's apartment. But he also savored the warm feeling of having everyone at one place, content and happy.
Tony abruptly pulled away and Steve wanted to protest, before he could voice his displeasure at having Tony’s lips anywhere
“Yeah that’s why you filled your sketch books with drawings of him for two whole months”
Clint yelped as someone, most probably Natasha, kicked him under the table.
Everything was perfectly normal…except it wasn’t, not for Steve.
Even though he was as loyal to the Dodgers as Bucky was, he knew better than to pick a fight over it with a drunk Clint. He turned down Clint’s offer to get him another drink, he didn’t want to wake up with a terrible hangover tomorrow after all.
He had wanted to call Tony as soon as he finished showering but no, Tony had been so brave asking Steve to his face and not hiding behind a phone. Steve had decided he owe him the same courtesy, he would tell Tony everything in person the next day.
Steve groaned quietly despairing at the idiotic ideas his friends came up with but couldn’t really bring himself to be too upset at being the butt of those stupid ideas.
“You confused me that day, I-I never really thought about you that way before but you managed to turn my whole world upside down. I started analyzing my feelings towards my previous art muses and Sam helped, Bucky too. They helped me understand more about my own feelings and I- well, I wasn’t actually sure at the beginning so I didn’t tell you.”
The little bright spark in Tony’s eyes flickered and he smiled a little sadly, “well, that’s what I told Pep too and I- well”
“I asked him and he said he wouldn’t miss Loki drinking everyone under the table but he had a ‘thing’ at Erik’s house first and will show up late” Clint said with exaggerated finger quotes on ‘thing’, “which clearly is a euphemism for gross kinky sex so I don’t even know why he think he’s being subtle”
He wanted to be drunk by the time Tony and Erik arrived, that way he would finally be numb from the pain of seeing them together every single time.
“What about your boyfriend Charles?” Bruce asked, unexpectedly joining the interrogation and the others fell silent.
“You’re totally gonna win. I’m so betting tons of money on you, like literally so much” Tony was saying while Pepper was trying to set a reasonable amount to bet for Tony clearly knowing that telling him not to bet would be a lost cause.
He was alone, lying on a couch and fully clothed, okay that was good news. He sighed, willing his body to work with him as he tried to sit up. He got very dizzy and stayed put while the urge to throw up his insides faded slowly, he finally spot the bottle of pills and water on the small coffee table and wanted to cry in relief.
There were probably a few more that just appealed to him but those were the prominent ones that immediately came to his mind.
“What does Erik have to do with anything?” he was interrupted by a perplexed Tony.
that?” Steve asked, a little awed.
Steve was angry.
As soon as they were out of sight, Rhodey turned to Pepper who was still glaring at the door where Tony had disappeared to.
“What?”
“Today? Well, um right before coming here actually” Steve mumbled.
Steve was a much better company in the evening compared to his fumbling conversations during lunch and he was enjoying hanging out with his rowdy bunch. They were getting progressively drunker and by default louder because Bucky and Clint were arguing about their teams again and Steve grinned fondly at the two idiots.
They broke up right before he started college, Peggy was a fierce girl who always knew what she wanted, she had her whole career and life planned out and she really didn’t see herself settling down, so they had broken it off amicably.
Steve almost winced, almost. “Yeah well, we don’t always hang out you know”
“Arrghh!” Tony slammed his mug down in frustration “I’m leaving” he said and stomped towards Steve who was still standing next to the door.
“I didn’t tell you because you’re important to me and if I was gonna pursue something with you, I wanted to be completely sure of myself. I didn’t want it to be a meaningless fuck or just me experimenting around. You’re one of my best friends and you’re too important to risk on some stupid thing like that. So I just, didn’t tell you, yet. I was going to- eventually, after I knew for sure. I was going to ask you to be my boyfriend the day you told us about your relationship with Erik-” Tony’s eyes widened in shock at that particular detail.
“What was that reaction when I first said it?” he demanded grumpily.
“So what are you doing here?” he said rudely, without any preamble pointing his plastic spoon at Lehnsherr.
She would hug him fiercely and tell him that it was alright, Steve glanced at the little dog shaped alarm clock sitting on his bedside table, showing it was two in the morning, it was his ma’s birthday present on his thirteenth birthday. They didn’t always have money to buy presents and Steve had treasured every gift he got.
Everyone looked to Tony who was now blushing. What the hell, why was he even blushing? Steve was suspicious now. Something was definitely up.
Loki watched him avidly, silently waiting for him to take a sip of the glorious smelling coffee and Steve took a cautious sip.
He was very much physically attracted to Tony, that much was clear and Steve suspected that he was possibly a little in love with his best friend after two weeks of agonizing over their relationship.
“What’s going on?” Bucky said from somewhere behind Clint, blearily blinking at the scene in front of him.
He squinted at Steve and Tony who were still on the floor, Steve half-sitting up with Tony on his lap. “Oh thank fuck” he simply said and turned back towards the stairs bellowing for Sam at the top of his lungs.
“Don’t you
Tony turned back to the door and Steve firmly shut his eyes, letting the tears fall, he couldn’t watch Tony walk out of his life, even just the thought was like a hot searing pain in his gut.
Loki was peering at him over a notebook from the open doorway, jotting down something several times, “I dare say the test was quite successful” he declared delightedly.
Steve didn’t really care what it was, it was giving him a nice syrupy feeling and heartache was rapidly becoming the furthest thing he was feeling. He poured himself another shot and downed it. He felt like he was floating and a laugh bubbled out of him. Loki was looking at him with curious amused eyes as if he was studying a very interesting specimen.
Today was supposed to be the best day, he had it all planned out and was finally going to tell Tony he wanted him to be his boyfriend. Actually, he had planned to tell him on Saturday but Tony had been busy and Steve couldn’t meet him on Sunday because he had an urgent assignment to submit on top of his weekend job.
“But you spent so much time with him. You barely had time for us anymore and you looked so happy” his tone was petulant, still incredibly jealous over that fact.
“Yes, maybe” Steve replied unimpressed while staring impassively at Sam.
He had always been protective of Tony even more than his other friends. He had chalked it up to him being the youngest among them- two years younger than most of them, and the reckless spitfire that Tony was, he had a supernatural knack of getting into trouble that was really bad for Steve’s heart.
Tony gasped, looking speechless as Steve darted little looks at him. It was just too painful to fully look at him while he spilled his guts out like this.
Tony had been dating him for close to two months now, he was apparently very serious and in love with Lehnsherr. Steve had mostly been fine with it, as fine as he could be while being completely jealous, hurt and trying to hide his obvious feelings for Tony.
The silence after that was awkward and stifling, Tony wasn’t even looking at him. He was staring morosely at his coffee mug. Steve gulped and his heart hammered away in his chest, it seemed he was supposed to do all the talking then.
"Well, I never!- " Tony started but was rudely interrupted by Clint who had loudly shoved a plate in front of them.
“Well, I guess I did that anyway, in the most shitty way possible and I’m sorry. You don’t have to feel obligated to do anything or feel sorry for me. I’m a fucking idiot and this is all my fault-”
It was also apparently very strong as Steve immediately felt slightly dizzy from the shot but not in a bad way. It felt good, the buzz in his veins felt so much better than any kind of buzz he had gotten from hard alcohol.
Two weeks later, Tony walks into the living room to find Steve playing Mario Kart with Clint while wearing a rainbow-colored beanie. He very nearly spills his coffee over his newly-pressed suit and flees the room before Steve or anyone else can comment on the flush spreading over his face. Tony Stark does not blush, thank you very much.
When he enters the living room, he’s greeted with an exuberant embrace from Thor, who nearly lifts him off his feet. “Captain, I am heartily glad for your return. Hulk and I are about to begin a glorious sparring match in the gym. Would you like to join us? We would appreciate your company.”
Steve sighs, not knowing what to say. Then, before his brain can catch up with his stupid mouth, he blurts out, “You went cake-tasting with Clint.”
He wouldn’t want it that way, especially from Tony. The thought had stuck in his mind like a splinter. If it happened, he didn’t want it to be in a crowded room just for show. He wanted it to be real.
“Hmm, love y’too…”
Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s chest and kneels down behind Tony, who is sitting cross-legged on the quad, kissing his boyfriend firmly on the cheek.
Tony looks at him with the bright mischievous gleam in his eyes that Steve adores and fears in equal measure. “We could make an announcement… or we could have Clint catch us in here as payback for that time he trapped us in the elevator and then forgot to let us out.”
tabs fill his screen. All of the headlines are on the same topic:
“What do you mean, it’s you?”
“Of course.” Foggy turns around and presses a lightning quick kiss to Matt’s palm. “Give us a minute, Matty?” Steve swears he sees the tips of Matt’s ears turn pink as he nods quickly.
“I wouldn’t even know where to start,” Tony admits, lowering his voice.
“That’s okay,” Tony replies, with a soft expression. A teasing glint sneaks into his gaze, one that Steve knows is going to keep driving him crazy. "You can make it up to me."
“Seriously, what are you doing here? Don’t you have Stats right now?”
Jan smiles and slips her hand in his. “Got it. I’ll talk to Foggy and see when he’s free for a chat, then.”
“Because… because I want to be with you. I want to be the one who gets to hold your hand, who gets to bring you coffee in the morning and kiss that sleepy look from your eyes, the one who gets your last dance at every gala, the one that everyone else thinks,
“Want to dance?”
“You’re not alone, Steve, and you don’t need to be fixed,” Foggy says, voice soft. “Whatever you decide to do with them, your feelings are yours. They’re real, and they’re good.”
He opens his mouth to say something, anything, when Tony straightens his shoulders and laughs. “Well then, I guess I gotta give the crowd what they want, yeah?” With a quick nod at Steve, Tony turns on his heel and heads in Clint’s direction.
Tony bursts out laughing. “You’re ridiculous and I can’t believe I’m into it.” He fists a hand in Steve’s hair, meeting him halfway with another long, slow kiss.
“I can’t argue with that.”
“Well, I got distracted. By you, as I recall.” Tony says, grinning unrepentantly.
Tony makes his choice without blinking. “Truth.” He tosses his drink back before wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. For a moment, Steve is distracted by the water still clinging to Tony’s bottom lip. “Bring it on.”
He can’t fail now.
Throughout the whole scene, Tony doesn’t notice Steve lurking in the doorway.
“Only thinking? You underestimate my powers of persuasion.”
“I’m fine, Hawkeye. Let’s just focus on the mission,” Steve says, clearing his throat. He doesn’t bother sparing a glance in Clint’s direction, keeping his eyes focused on the video feed playing out in front of them. The video feed of the gala that Tony and Nat are attending tonight as a couple, playing the role to retrieve important intel.
Foggy laughs and moves to sit, placing his large shoulder bag on the back of his chair. Steve returns to his seat. “Mostly,” Foggy acknowledges, and Steve ducks his head to hide a grin.
Steve hears his voice crack at these last words, the hurt of Tony’s accusation finally puncturing through his anger.
“First of all, thank you for trusting me with this, Steve,” Foggy says, and Steve manages a weak smile.
Steve could give him, and he’s so damn tired of pretending he doesn’t.
“Yeah?”
Steve had known that Tony looked up to Captain America as a kid - Tony had even shown him a picture of his younger self dressed up as Captain America for Halloween after the Time Stone debacle, but Steve never imagined it extended into a childhood crush. Steve feels a glimmer of hope plant itself in his chest before it’s extinguished abruptly by his next thought.
SHIELD had told the team about rumors of a series of black market arms deals being conducted at a number of high society affairs and requested infiltration assistance from the Avengers. Given Tony’s experience as a former military defense contractor and Natasha’s unmatched skills as a spy, it had been decided that the easiest way to complete this mission was for them to attend the gala as a couple. The ensuing gossip would allow them ample opportunity to distract guests while zeroing in on the right targets, and it would also give them a good excuse to stick close to one another.
Steve grins back at him before hoisting Tony into his arms. “I think I’d rather taste you.”
“I did not walk into a wall!”
“Yep,” Tony says, shifting a little until he’s snuggled up under Steve’s arm with one leg draped over Steve’s. “They’re your cufflinks. I borrowed them last week and added a little something.”
“So are you,” Steve says, grinning. “So you know how you said you really wanted to be my first kiss?”
Jan looks up. “What’s up, sleepyhead?” she asks, while Bucky crows about his victory over Sam in their third match.
Steve doesn’t look up. He wonders if she’s surprised by his choice or if it’s what she expected all along. He wonders if Death can feel surprise.
Steve pauses, releasing a long sigh that turns wobbly at the end. He registers the shaky timbre of his voice, the weight of something tight in his throat making it hard for him to swallow and start again.
“You started all this! You got him that
Tony’s smile is warm and sweet underneath his. Steve doesn’t think he’s ever felt happier when they part for breath minutes later.
“Oh, and why would you care, Cap? It’s my business if I decide what's worth it to save a teammate’s life, and it will always be worth it.” Steve can tell Tony is aiming for nonchalance in the face of Steve’s anger, but there’s a hardness to his voice that belies that ease.
Steve turns to his right to see Tony sitting next to him. His eyes are fixed on Steve’s face, his expression unreadable, and Steve's heart jumps into his throat as he moves reflexively to cover his sketchpad with one hand, hoping that it’s too dark for Tony to see anything.
Something between a chuckle and a sigh makes its way out of Steve’s throat as he forces himself to relax, letting his forehead fall forward to rest on Tony’s chest. Tony lifts one hand to stroke Steve’s hair, and it feels wonderful. Tony’s arms are looped around his neck, holding him in place. It feels like a weight has been lifted off his chest, like Steve can breathe again.
“Congratulations,” Steve says, clapping a hand to Foggy’s shoulder. “You deserve it. And we may not be on for the lonely hearts club anymore, but you’re still on the hook for the Hobbit movie marathon. Popcorn and hours of yelling at Peter Jackson’s directing choices.”
“You do?” Steve feels like he’s floating, like his heart is too big to be contained in his chest right now. At Tony’s answering nod, he presses down on Tony’s bottom lip, a shiver of want burning through his veins at the soft sigh that escapes Tony’s mouth.
“Love you back, fiancé.”
“You think we should put him out of his misery and tell everyone tonight?” Tony asks, eyebrows raised.
“Yes, indeed.” Steve grips Tony’s shoulder with one hand.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says after a pause, swallowing past the lump in his throat. God, maybe it would have been easier if he had stayed oblivious to his feelings.
“Tony…”
“You… I…”
“I spent years thinking that maybe there was just something I wasn’t seeing or didn’t get about having romantic feelings that everyone else did, and it was lonely. It wasn’t until I met Matt and I fell for him years after we became friends that the idea of romance became real for me. But even then it was so confusing because it wasn’t anything like what I thought dating should be like, at least from movies and television and from what other people said about it.”
“You saved me, sweetheart. You told me to be brave, and that’s how I found the strength to use the arc reactor and stop it all. Without you, I don’t know if I could have done it.” Tony’s smile grows, and Steve’s fingers tighten around Tony’s hand. “You reminded me of what being a hero means.”
“Tony, I love it. It’s perfect. I love you.”
“Tony. What. The. Hell. Were. You. Thinking,” Steve grounds out in a low voice, biting off each word furiously, feeling as though he doesn’t have enough control over himself to say more than one word at once. All at once, the devastating fear and panic he had felt during the battle when Tony had thrown himself directly in front of Steve to block an attack from Kang comes rushing back, and Steve’s voice rises in volume. “What the hell was that?”
Foggy’s fingers trace the rim of his coffee cup. “It wasn’t until I learned about the concept of being demiromantic that I realized that romantic feelings work a little differently for me, but approaching romance from a different perspective doesn’t make my feelings any less real.”
Steve feels his face turn hotter with embarrassment at the thought. He needs to at least try and stay professional, at least until the mission is over. After that, fleeing to his rooms is looking like a very good idea.
“Steve Rogers?” Steve looks up at the sound of his name to see someone he guesses is Foggy grinning down at him, one hand outstretched. The expression in his blue eyes is warm and open; the small bubble of anxiety in Steve’s stomach settles and dissipates at his friendly, quiet smile.
Then there’s the time Tony’s armor is drenched with frog slime in the middle of a battle (villains are really straining for creativity, lately) and Tony has to take off the armor immediately at the end of the battle to avoid contamination.
Tony’s self-aware enough to realize that if it weren’t for Rhodey as their audience, he would have climbed Steve like a tree by now, challenge be damned.
Steve loses time in his focus. It’s only until a familiar humming pulls him out of his reverie, minutes or perhaps hours later, that he realizes he’s not alone.
He knows exactly who his jacket thief is.
Steve huffs, lifting Tony’s free hand to his lips for a kiss. “You had good reason to be, but you know that’s not what I meant.”
“What’re you doing?” Tony finally asks after a long pause, the words half-muffled against Steve’s neck as he burrows himself further into Steve’s warmth.
“Of course,” Steve assures him, though the words taste false in his mouth.
“That—that’s good,” Steve says, a bubble of bright joy rising in his chest when Tony grins at him happily. He wraps his arms around Tony’s waist and pulls him close. “I’m still sorry I hurt you.”
“Tony, wait.”
“Indeed, Sir.”
A photo of Tony catching Clint in a bridal carry makes it onto every single evening news program that night, amid more wedding speculation.
has never been a problem for Steve. But there’s something about Tony in his quieter moments, when he’s standing still just long enough for Steve to try and read him, something that Steve can’t quite decipher.
Steve looks good wearing his name.
“Yes.”
He could have sworn his football jacket had been right there this morning, freshly pressed and wrinkle-free…
“Got it.” She grins and smothers a laugh before motioning in Steve’s direction. “I dare you to call Johnny Storm and tell him that not only are you a much prettier blond, you also have a nicer ass than he does.”
Even if Clint and Tony aren’t actually together, Tony could never be his. Steve’s an old-fashioned, stubborn ass who can’t even deal with his own feelings without avoiding two of his best friends. What hope does he have that Tony might return those feelings?
“Every memory?”
“Sorry, Tony, I think I’m going to try and turn in early. Raincheck for next time?” Steve says, trying to inject a note of cheer into his voice.
before Tony realizes the exact extent of Steve’s new
Steve turns and cuts him off with a short, bruising kiss that leaves them both panting for air when they break apart.
At this, Foggy freezes, looking apologetic. “Not that you’re not fantastic, or anything. But I’m, well, I have feelings for someone. Annoying feelings that I’m trying really hard to get over, but still.”
Tony smirks. “I enjoyed that, even if he didn’t.”
Tony murmurs quietly in assent. Steve tries not to grin at the sight of a napping Tony clutching at the collar of his jacket, but when he catches Nat studying him out of the corner of his eye, he knows it’s a lost cause.
“Steve Rogers.
“Nice shirt, Steve.”
Steve glances up and colors when he sees the open doors in front of him. “Thank you, JARVIS,” he answers.
Steve hears Clint whisper, sounding put-out.
Tony nods, wrenching his gaze away from Steve’s as he walks over to the doorway.
Steve drops his head into his hands with a loud groan. He
“Is that so?”
concerned. It was adorable.”
He leaves without getting coffee.
“...”
“That’s not the first time you’ve said that.”
wanted to kiss you pretty much since you said you hoped no one had kissed you.” Tony grins into the crook of Steve’s neck, filing that away for later. “I don’t know when I started wanting more than that, but I do. Very much.”
He jumps to his feet and blurts out something he’s pretty sure sounds like “finemaybelaterTonyseeyou” before hightailing it from the room.
“What’s that?” Rhodey asks, sounding wary. He really does know Tony all too well.
“I just wanted to make sure you were okay after you rushed out of there,” she adds.
Steve’s halfway out the door when he notices the empty coat hanger on the side of his bed. He picks it up, frowning slightly.
When he finds Death, Steve sees a stranger. That is almost a relief.
“What?” Steve freezes, feeling as though someone has dunked his body in cold water.
Steve’s happy to say it as many times as he needs to until Tony believes him, and many more after that.
“Clint suggested a kissing game. And I, well… I’ve never had a first kiss.” The words ring quiet and clear in the air between them.
Steve freezes as Tony lets out a swear and takes off. It only takes him a moment to see why - Clint’s falling fast through the air with no signs of stopping.
Jan flops back on to the bed with a frustrated groan, covering her face with one arm. “I need to finish up these sketches for the costume design project, but they’re not coming out right!”
He wants to be the one there with Tony, laughing at his jokes and dancing with him, wants to be the one to hold his hand, and the one he looks at first every time.
“It’s certainly…
“If that’s what you’re upset about, we can go cake-tasting right now, Cap. They have this maple pecan vanilla cake I know you’ll love, the frosting is—” Tony’s words are stopped in their tracks as Steve settles a finger over Tony’s lips.
“There’s the genius I know and love,” he says, cupping Tony's cheek with one hand.
Steve tries to keep his voice steady, but he knows Tony can hear the hurt in it loud and clear.
Foggy’s gaze is gentle as it settles on Steve’s, and the panic and confusion brewing in Steve’s gut quiets a little at the open understanding in his eyes. “Yeah, there is, Steve.”
“You better believe it, baby.”
“You’re wearing… a
“Someone knock me out so I don’t have to take that Chem test next week,” he grouses.
“Hmmm. Had a long day?”
“Very well. I hope you will not regret what you have chosen.”
At least Steve’s not looking at him right now and can’t see just how much of a mess he’s made of Tony just with a freaking
“Pose… for me?”
“Yeah. Still mad at you though.”
“You’ve done nothing wrong, Tony,” Steve says heavily, shaking his head. “I’m so sorry, I never meant to—” He lets out a broken half-laugh before continuing. “It’s not what you think, Tony. You never made me uncomfortable, it was never that.” Gathering up all the remnants of his courage, Steve looks up to meet Tony’s questioning gaze.
“—You know what, I’m sure Carol won’t mind running on her own today.”
Tony has been very busy with Stark Industries meetings for the last couple of weeks, so they've barely seen each other. Before Steve left on his mission, he made it a point to be in the kitchen every day after his morning runs, just to see and spend a few minutes with Tony. Despite his exhaustion, a smile spreads across Steve’s face as he remembers the look of sleepy contentment on Tony’s face whenever he takes his first sip of coffee in the morning, grinning at Steve over his kitten mug.
Steve receives it in silence. When she inclines her head, he moves forward and whispers his answer in Death’s ear.
Tony has to fight to cover the hitch in his voice when Steve steps closer, one hand hovering over Tony’s open collar.
He does not know how long Death gives him, but when Steve looks up to meet her gaze, he is ready.
Usually Tony can also tie a perfect Windsor knot without batting an eye, courtesy of Jarvis' strict guidance, but Steve refrains from mentioning this out of tact.
It’s not how he meant to say it for the first time – he’d planned a grand romantic date for it, a rare chance to pamper and indulge Tony like he loves doing. Not this, an impromptu confession rushing out of him because he doesn’t want to hold it in any longer.
“That’s still not going to work.”
“I texted Rhodey but he’s still in class and hasn’t gotten back to me yet, and I really need to see Tony right now.”
Just then, there’s a loud knock on the door. When Steve opens the door, he’s met with the sight of a half-asleep Tony looking dead on his feet. He’s wearing a LEGO Batman shirt that Steve is pretty sure belongs to Rhodey. There’s a furrow in his brow that Steve is trying really hard not to find adorable.
“Sap. God, my head is killing me.”
“Wow. That was…”
“Are you asking me out on a date, Cap?”
Completely and utterly fantastic.
“Better luck next time, Nat. Thor lost too.”
Tony’s the smartest person Steve knows, and Steve loves him. If he wants Steve to trust that Tony will always come back to him, just as he always wants to come back to Tony, it’s an easy decision to make.
“I will give you a choice.” Death’s voice turns honey-sweet for a moment, with a tinge of laughter. “Perhaps they will call me merciful, for a change.”
Then he registers Tony’s words and his brain screeches to a halt again.
All the time in the world and a dictionary with every word in every language wouldn’t make this an easier question to answer.
Tony bites back the incredulous
“Okay, Tony, it’s your turn next.” Natasha’s smile turns speculative as she fixes her gaze on Tony, a calculating look in her eyes. It’s the same look Steve saw on her face just before she took down Clint in yesterday’s sparring session, so he knows she means business.
He’s finally done with specs for Nat’s new Widow Bites, his favorite Sourpatch is here for a week-long visit, and he’s been successfully parrying Steve’s not-so-subtle advances with moves of his own for the past two weeks.
Steve gives a start as a sudden and loud CRACK fills the silence in the lab. He looks down to find that the edge of Tony’s table that he'd been holding on to has broken off in his hands. Steve blushes, a wave of intense mortification spreading through him. What the hell is wrong with him today?
Tony and Rhodey joined them for the movies earlier, and Steve had spent much of that time distracted by the small sliver of space between him and Tony as they sat next to each other on the bed. Almost touching but not quite.
“No, not really - why?”
“That was me making a strategic decision to save your life, Cap,” Tony responds, placing his wrench down before turning to Steve. Despite the even tone of voice, Tony’s eyes are flashing with emotion. Steve reads the hidden anger in Tony’s mask of calm, and it only serves to infuriate him further.
The hot touch of Steve’s mouth to the pulse point of Tony’s wrist has Tony freezing in place. He feels warm all over. All he wants for the rest of his life is the touch of Steve’s mouth on his skin.
Steve grins even as he feels himself blush. That had been a very memorable night indeed.
“I meant all of it, Tony, every word.”
“Oh,” Foggy says, sounding surprised. “Don’t worry about it, she told me it wasn’t a blind date or anything like that.” He tugs a little at the edge of his shirt sleeve. “If she had, I would have turned her down.”
“And what, exactly, were you thinking about when you were supposed to be paying attention during the debrief, hmm?”
“You do?” Tony’s question is soft and careful, and Steve understands the cautious note in his voice even as it sends a rush of protectiveness surging through his veins.
Steve looks up at the sound of a knock on his door, a sinking feeling in his gut. He can make a fair guess who his visitor might be, and he’s not ready to put on a brave face in front of Tony yet.
It’s just anxiety, that’s all; he wants the mission to go smoothly, and undercover operations have always left him antsy, even when he isn’t the one going undercover.
He’s so focused on his phone that he doesn’t hear the elevator doors open.
“You save me, I save you. That’s how this works, right?”
He clicks the top article. The link takes him to a page with the same screaming headline. Steve scrolls down. His finger halts on the screen, covering the edge of the picture that shows Clint taking a bite of cake straight from Tony’s fingers.
Steve nurses his drink as he turns in his seat to survey the crowd behind him. They’ve been trying to track down the possible location of an alleged secret map to the ruins of Camelot for weeks, though Steve thinks it’s more than likely another false rumor. Tony had asked Steve along for this meeting with an informant, but Steve had lost him in the crowd soon after they walked in.
He watches as Tony wraps his arm around Natasha’s waist as he makes conversation with one of the guests, who Steve recognizes as Trevor Banks, one of the people they suspect as being tied to the black market activity. Natasha leans in to Tony’s space easily, placing one hand on his shoulder before taking hold of his champagne glass and stealing a sip. Tony laughs and kisses her on the cheek, before moving even closer to whisper sweet nothings into her ear—
More than one picture of Tony dancing at the party makes it onto the next morning’s newspapers. Using one of the photos, Steve attempts to replicate Tony’s expression on paper. It’s almost perfect, for once. Tony looks content, if a little bored at being the center of attention, his smile bright and flawless.
“That’s why I keep you around, Rogers, for your good ideas.”
“There’s nothing wrong with plaid, Tony.”
“Unfortunately, Colonel, I am unable to take such a bribe. However, I do appreciate the offer,” Jarvis intones drily.
Steve looks up, hope blooming in his chest even as he tells himself not to read too much into Tony’s words. The astonishment he had seen earlier on Tony’s face has softened into something sweeter, something tender.
A misshapen lumpy figure that looks a lot like Tony smothered in three, no, four different blankets. And a purple robe.
“You like it when I’m romantic, admit it.”
“Really? That’s all you’ve got to say?” Steve raises an eyebrow in Tony’s direction, and Tony hears the barely-suppressed laughter threading its way through Steve’s words. “No comments about how
’ tenth anniversary edition will be any different. Pepper has been dropping hints about it for over a month, and Rhodey had assured him that it really wasn’t all that bad, if you avoided the right people. Although Steve hates disappointing his friends, especially Tony, he won’t be swayed into changing his mind.
Steve pulls his knees up to his chest and folds his arms over them, his heart knocking frantically against his ribs.
“Never mind,” Tony finishes, looking down at his feet. He shoves his hands in his pockets, and Steve bites back the completely inappropriate urge to smooth out Tony’s frown with his fingers, or his lips.
He’s good at his job - there’s no question of that. Steve knows that Tony and Jim had had misgivings about taking him on as their illustrator at Pepper’s recommendation while she broadened her scope to chronicle other journals as well as
“It’s perfect,” he whispers against Tony’s lips.
“Maybe, but also I know you.”
Thor nods. His happy expression turns mischievous as he looks down at Steve's phone. “Ah, so you have read about Tony and Clint’s new attachment as well? A fantastic joke, is it not?” He clasps a hand on Steve’s shoulder before leaving the room, his laughter booming loudly behind him.
“It’s not a fling for me either, Steve. I want more, with you.” Tony blinks and tightens his grip on Steve’s hand. “That is...if you want that too.”
Bucky’s arm is a familiar weight around his shoulders, as is the light punch he delivers to Steve’s arm. “She’s right, you punk.” The grip on his arm tightens into an embrace as Bucky pulls him in.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, Rogers,” Tony drawls.
“Steve. Sweetheart.” Steve’s heart skips a beat at the sound of the endearment coming from Tony’s lips. An endearment meant for
Tony lets out an indignant noise of disapproval. “Of course I could. This is just easier.” He points at Steve, forefinger wobbling a little. “And, and this way… this way you get the benefit of my sparkling company.”
“...Oh god, that wasn’t a dream? Well, sometimes when you smile, I can’t think, alright!”
“I know. I know you do, Steve. Now get over here before you make me swoon with another grand romantic speech.”
“They’re together?” Jan looks more than a little interested. “Foggy told me they’re just friends. And roommates,” she adds, sounding thoughtful.
“Tony, you got dinner plans tonight?”
He looks at Steve. “I’m demiromantic. That means I only experience romantic attraction to someone when I already have a strong emotional connection to them.”
“Tony, I don’t want you to think that this is a one-off. I can’t do that, not with you, even if that means—”
Tony’s laughter is soft against his palm as Steve smooths his hand carefully over Tony’s cheek.
She smirks. Steve thinks that maybe he needs to reconsider his earlier sentiment. “Just making sure you’re not getting lost in a daydream.” Jan’s expression softens.
“Want some company?”
“Second thoughts then?”
Tony stifles a groan as he lies back on the couch and flings his arms over his face. He knows Steve means it, that this has been much more than a game for far longer than he wants to admit, for both Steve and himself.
Steve raises his eyebrows in Foggy’s direction as they move a few paces away. “So, I’m guessing you won’t be joining me at the lonely hearts’ club this week after all?”
There’s a pause, and then Sharon’s next words almost make Tony’s heart stop. “Well, you better figure it out fast, because he’s coming over here.”
“Steve, wait up!”
“I always knew you were a smart man.”
Tony, Tony, Tony.
He meets the woman’s seething glare with a carefully blank expression, wanting nothing more than to take Tony’s hand in his and pull him away from her searching gaze.
“I’ll concede that you look good in it,” he murmurs. “You look so handsome in it, I think I might just let you keep it.” Steve punctuates this statement by tugging Tony forward for a kiss.
“Your eternal love and devotion, of course? What did you think I’d ask for?” Rhodey rolls his eyes, but Tony sees the fond smile lurking at the corner of his mouth and beams triumphantly.
“Whatever are you accusing me of, Captain Rogers?”
“What do you mean, what am I doing here? I’m in your room, so unless you’ve got another one of my best friends hiding out in here, I’m looking for you.” Steve walks in and shuts the door behind him, dropping his backpack on the floor behind him.
Sharon grins at him, bright and knowing before tugging him into a hug. Tony leans into the touch, smiling down at her.
Steve steps into the elevator, letting out a loud sigh of relief when the doors close without anyone else coming in. The mission he's just returned from had been a long one, and all he wants now is a good cup of coffee and some decent sleep.
“Perfect,” Steve says, ducking his head. He doesn’t understand why, but as he looks at Tony, it feels like his heart has suddenly flown into his throat.
Tony only releases Steve’s arm once they’re around the corner. His hand brushes against Steve’s bare wrist for one brief moment. It’s nothing, a mere accident, but Steve feels the touch like a brand on his skin all the way back to the office.
She falls quiet after that, but Steve hears her voice in his next thought.
“Tony, that’s fine, but—”
Jan pats Tony’s shoulder and gives him a once-over, probably to check that he’s really unharmed. “Did you drink too much of that punch Thor brought?” A teasing note slips into her voice. “Seems to me like someone’s getting a little tipsy.
Tony growls and buries his face in his hands. He’s at the very end of his rope. There’s only the tiniest sliver of pride holding his self-control back from marching into Steve’s room, swooning into his arms, and telling Steve to have his way with Tony.
“Are you already drunk?” Tony finally asked.
He felt Bucky’s hand on his knee and looked at him. Bucky tipped his head to Steve’s right hand where he was crushing his plastic spoon that was making ominous cracking sounds. He breathed out and dropped it on his plate. He wouldn’t be able to eat anything anyway.
Steve nodded enthusiastically, anything for Tony.
But he never actually forgot about it, now that he was aware of himself, he was constantly aware of how his interactions with both men and women he found attractive were very similar. He had always chalked it up to admiration before but turns out maybe it was attraction.
Sam turned to him again then and raised one eyebrow (Steve had always been jealous that Sam and Tony were able to do that so easily, If he tried he’d just raise both his eyebrows and look like an idiot).
a vicious little voice in his head barked).
Bucky perked up and looked at Steve sheepishly “Yeah sorry Stevie, you just go on and figure it out in your own pace” He patted Steve’s back fondly and turned to where Clint was and hollered a challenge. Just like that he was stumbling away and Steve loved them so much for not making a big deal out of this.
At that Tony turned to look at him, probably assessing his face for any hint of lies. Steve swallowed nervously and continued.
He thought a little meanly.
Steve had thought while silently fuming.
“It’s okay” he reminded Tony who just smiled and started to walk away.
Well that didn’t matter anymore did it?
Then there was Ben, also a theater student who was just so shiny and put together that Steve can’t help but admire and draw. There had also been Adam who was in the football team and refused to join in when his teammates bully people and often get into fights to defend someone, and Steve still being a bag of bones then had admired him so much that he put his admiration into sketches.
"I don't know, I heard you have an appalling taste in art" he teased.
Steve stumbled, he didn’t know how long he had been running or how fast he pushed himself to run, his legs were starting to give out so he stumbled to a stop and sat down, panting and sweating.
? Why not just give it to all these people in your house?”
“I don’t know any brunette” Steve told Natasha trying his best to sound innocent.
Maybe if Steve hadn’t wasted so much time mulling over things and wasn’t such a fucking oblivious idiot he would have had a chance to really be with Tony, he would be the boyfriend that Tony proudly tell his other friends about. He should’ve told Tony sooner and maybe that would make a difference, if he had, maybe Tony wouldn’t have tried so hard so to move on and he would still want to date Steve (
“Tony!” he exclaimed brightly on hearing the familiar cadence of Tony’s voice even before seeing him.
Steve basically did a lot of thinking and introspection for the two days, he thought about his friendship with Tony and how different it was from his friendship with Bucky or any of the other guys. He couldn’t even think about kissing Bucky, that was like kissing his brother
Natasha rolled her eyes and jumped down lightly, she took the whole coffee pot and left, slamming the door shut behind her.
Everyone excluding Tony had noticed his thunderous mood over the past few weeks, he had snapped at people for little things and nothing truly held his interest. His art projects were lacklustre and he had no enthusiasm to fix it.
“B-but he was your boyfriend! How- what-” Tony huffed out and incredulous laugh, making Steve's neck tingle with his breath.
He spluttered and coughed and Steve almost left him to choke but thought better of it and smacked at Sam’s back, with more force than necessary.
Steve really should have known.
“What the FUCK!” He finally found his words, “I thought you said they were talking, Tasha! Not fucking on the kitchen floor, Oh my god my poor eyes oh my god when the fuck did this happened, oh my-”
“Loki must be so smug right now, where is he? I want to know if he changed the formula. Bruciebear! Erik, where’s Charles?” Tony started to get up and that was so not okay, Tony should not be going anywhere else especially with that shark Erik, completely unacceptable.
"The boyfriend rumour was just convenient for them because Charles’ dad was being an asshole about their relationship. If he thought Erik was dating me, he couldn’t threaten to cut off Charles again. Since it was me who started it all I didn’t mind so we kept up the façade” , he explained.
Tony was talking to him, Tony was smiling at him, nothing could bring his happiness down.
Then, he had planned to tell Tony in the morning, meeting him with his usual cup of coffee just like Tony had done before with his confession.
Steve snorted, “How about no”.
He disappeared into the throng of people in the house and Steve decided it was high time he looked for his friends. He was feeling great, better than he had felt in weeks and he wanted to be with his friends he loved so much.
Out of their friends, Clint hated Thor’s brother the most, no one knew how it started but they were both insufferable when they were in the same room. Thor weakly defended his brother which prompted them to bicker about Loki with Tony chiming in every so often.
“I- what? Because he’s your boyfriend-”
He tried figuring out when Tony may have started developing romantic feelings for him but he just couldn’t pin down any interaction, everything was normal and happy between them.
As much as Steve was enjoying his friends giving Lehnsherr the third degree he despaired at their complete lack of manners. He knew they were protective and very much intimidating towards new people but honestly this was just rude.
“Of course” Steve replied confidently and added “Have I told you guys how much I love you all?”
Steve gave a mental shrug, he could hold his alcohol pretty well and he was like seventy-five percent sure Loki won’t poison him in their own home. “Fine”, he huffed out.
thing. It’s quite new and a pleasant surprise but Tony here is my --”
He knew Tony was out and proud bisexual, had always known even before they were friends and hated each other’s guts. He knew Tony had an older boyfriend who did a number on his emotional well-being but Tony had never actually dated anyone after that.
His memories were jumbled, only because he was remembering specific things in no order whatsoever but the most prominent of them all was his interactions with Tony.
“Tony-” Steve tried to placate, he didn’t understand why Tony was so angry but he needed him to calm down.
“You didn’t-”
“I know these past couple of weeks haven’t be easy for you” Tony started with a very serious tone as he sat down beside Steve “I knew the possibility of making you uncomfortable by asking you out was very high, no Steve, no interruption remember? I know it was a shock to hear about my feelings but I’m dealing- have been dealing with them. You don’t have to be extra nice to me even if you feel sorry for me. I’m sorry I made our friendship awkward with my feelings and stuff when I should’ve just left it alone-”
“Shhh” his mouth was covered with Tony’s hand, “Just- you don’t have to do this you know” he ran his other hand over his hair frustratedly, making it endearingly messy. With Tony’s hand on his mouth, Steve couldn’t ask what 'this' was. “It’s not even-” he was cut off by a loud cheer from their friends, they both glanced at them, Jane was doing a freakishly flexible pose with her limbs twisting and crossing with Natasha and Clint was complaining loudly while getting himself up from the floor, apparently the cheer was because of his fall.
privately about something” he gritted out with a strange emphasis on ‘boyfriend’. He pulled Lehnsherr up by the shirt, forcefully herding him towards the cafeteria exit.
After browsing a bit, he found something that looked relatively normal and a lot less scripted and after watching for a few minutes he concluded that yes, he was indeed hundred and ten percent bisexual based on his physical reaction.
"Well, gee you grouchy killjoy" Tony muttered back petulantly.
He fumbled with the pills, swallowing two and downing the water like a dying man. He felt a little better after having hydrated and once more took in his surroundings.
It was their own amazing family and with his Tony in his arms loving him right back, Steve couldn't imagine anything more perfect than this.
As he mindlessly sketched what should be his little Brooklyn neighbourhood back home he thought about how he had never actually questioned his sexuality.
He fidgeted again and it was so unusual for Tony to be speechless or out of words that the whole wrongness of the situation made Steve scramble to do something to fix it.
Steve just hadn’t wanted to consider the possibility that he was just the same as the various people Tony hooked up with, he had always known Tony was attracted to nice shiny things and was just easily distracted and often lose his interest just as quickly too, he had thought he was a little more special than that and had hoped Tony won’t move on so immediately.
Steve was too shocked to do anything but stay stock still as he felt the soft red bitten lips push firmly to his. It was a short innocent kiss but Steve could do nothing but gape as tony pulled away.
His beautiful callused but elegant hands that were always in constant motion when he was talking or working or listening. Tony was a whirlwind of chaos and beauty one can’t help but orbit around as if he were the sun, and Steve had drawn Tony many many times when he was hanging out in his lab, helplessly drawn to his magnifying chaos.
“Are you okay?” Tony asked quietly after a minute of staring. It was loaded in other wordless questions which was probably Tony checking if their friendship was okay.
still not even sure I am!” he exclaimed with confused indignation just as Bucky sat down with his new drink.
“Let me go, you lying liar!”
“Um, well, yes?” he answered, unsure what the question was.
Bucky groaned, “Stevie, you had a crush the size of a freaking continent on Adam Jefferson in high school before you moved on to Peggy Carter”
He gasped a little and opened his mouth to let Tony explore as much as he wanted, he did the same with Tony’s mouth tasting coffee and
Tony would text him when he was ready and Steve was determined to give him the space he had asked for. He finally fell into a fitful sleep after a few more minutes of brooding.
Steve breathed out, relief warring with cautious happiness and hope. He slumped over tony, limbs loose with the unbridled feeling of enormous relief. All the fight and caution went out of his body and he felt like a puppet with its strings cut.
He didn’t go to hang out with Tony in his lab after that, he had no right to feel angry about Tony and his boyfriend doing couple things in Tony’s private space.
He then thought about other beautiful people who had intrigued his artistic side, there was Peggy of course because she was an absolute beauty, and Bernie who he had a little crush on, she always looked ethereal in her glassblowing workshop in high school. And Emily, a theater student who played the most compelling character of Shakespeare’s Portia.
Steve rubbed Tony's arms bemusedly as he watched his friends eating and bickering with a few amused look thrown their way.
Steve felt a pleased possessive thrill at hearing Tony call him his boyfriend, "He won't be as gorgeous as
taste in absolutely everything. You should see my boyfriend, he's an absolute piece of art"
Sam sensing Steve eyeing him looked back with a raised brow and Steve shook his head fondly. After another hour of bickering loudly, Clint had slowly migrated to the other group of friends that seemed to be agreeing with him while Bucky complained loudly, trying to rope in Steve several times. He grumbled as he went to the bar to get more drinks.
“I know, Tony.”
“I mean, we’re still taking it slow, or as slow as you can when you live together and you’re best friends, because of, you know, not wanting to ruin the best thing in my life and all that.”
“That’s why I’m here.”
“Yeah, I do. I bet you I know something you don’t, though.”
Steve sits up from where he’d been lying sprawled on his bed after they finished their Mamma Mia movie marathon. Jan and Nat are sitting at the end of the bed as Jan braids Nat’s hair, while Sam and Bucky are in the middle of what Steve guesses is their third game of Battleship tonight.
✪✪✪                                                            ✪✪✪                                                             ✪✪✪
Tony had been fine, almost nonchalant about it too and he didn’t look affected much when he left. But Steve, if possible, was still reeling with the new information.
He just wasn’t a one-night stand kind of fella, he needed to feel emotionally connected to someone before he truly enjoyed having sex with them so he hadn’t really bothered at all.
"Considering your mental age is like four, that's not wrong" Natasha told him unsympathetically.
He was such an idiot, he was twenty-one for god's sake and was only just finding out he may be bisexual. His ma was probably laughing at him from heaven.
It was relatively empty with only a bunch of students hanging around near the tracks so he just started running, pushing his physical limits to take his mind off the pain in his chest.
apology once you’re sober and I’m not letting you off the hook. Fat fucking chance for that. But right now, sleep. Your sad hangdog puppy eyes make me sad because I’m still pathetically gone over you and I need you to be present with all your mental faculties and all cylinders firing for this talk and-”
There was a weird moment when Pepper eyed him a little strangely, as if studying him, but that was only for a few seconds.
Tony started to get up and Steve reluctantly let him go, they clearly weren’t going to get any privacy here.
He ended with a questioning tone as if he wasn’t even sure of what he was talking about and was looking for a confirmation from Steve, who at this very moment was still gaping at Tony in shock and reeling from what he just heard.
He caught the tail end of Clint’s question which was “..will totally do it, right Steve?” and everyone else including Tony were staring at him expectantly, Sam with a knowing look while Natasha seemed deadly amused.
"I didn’t want you to think I was just asking you out just to blow off some steam. And I didn’t want you to think I was still pathetically pining over you while I fuck other people pretending it’s you or whatever so I panicked and just blurted that out", Tony looked a little shamefaced telling him that, "I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out, Pep and Natasha figured it out the next day but I begged Pep to cover for me”
He knew Tony was one of the most beautiful person he had ever met, from the lush brown curls that usually go everywhere if Tony ran his hand through it enough times, to the expressive clear brown eyes that’d would light up and sparkle mischievously and turned amber under the sunlight.
ask you, I mean I guess it makes sense? Because then I would be sure, I just- well- um so yeah I like you and wanted to ask if you’d like to go on a date with me?”
Thor and Loki were brothers from New Asgardia in Norway and their family were royalty or some big shot like that. They were still acclimating and talked as if they were in a Shakespearean drama although they were so much easier to understand now compared to their first year.
“Potion of doom?” Rhodey asked before Steve could get his mouth to work.
And Steve just couldn’t take this anymore. He couldn’t sit here while all his closest friends talk about Tony and his new boyfriend and wheedle out all the sordid details from Pepper.
“Idiot” he sighed heavily and started to pull Steve up in a more vertical position.
They weren’t dating but they had a weird friends with benefits thing going on but it was only likely a matter of time before it turned much more serious because Bucky was completely ass over kettle over Natasha even though he was an incorrigible flirt.
He put his hands on Tony’s waist, feeling skin as Tony's shirt had gotten bunched up a little. Tony moaned and it was such a trip to be the one making Tony sound like that. Steve was about to explore more of that beautiful smooth olive skin when he was rudely interrupted by a loud screech.
“Steve, listen-”
He was very aware that he was acting like an asshole but he had no idea how to make himself feel better, he put more effort into being patient with his friends than he ever had to. He hadn’t written back to any of Peggy’s recent letter, he had tried of course but he just couldn’t bring himself to put down anything on paper.
He and Pepper had also started hanging out with the other group from time to time.
“NO!” Clint screamed.
Steve felt short of breath like he used to when he was still a weak asthmatic kid and his heart was beating wildly, pounding at his rib-cage.
"Well, I think it's sweet" Pepper chimed in from behind Sam with Rhodey and Bruce in tow.
“Just follow me” he ordered and helped Steve get to his feet.
They had fights about things they never argue about when they were friends but it was still the best relationship Steve had ever had with anyone.
He then walked to the little coffee shop near the college campus and got his usual coffee order along with a tall black sludge of a coffee for Tony, his other best friend who had probably stayed up all night again for one of his robotics projects.
“Steve, wait-”
“Hey, whoa whoa, calm down. it was a joke Steve. Of course, I knew you wouldn’t do that” Tony hurriedly said with hands out in a placating gesture.
"Does this mean I can stop acting like I don't know about Charles and Erik's relationship?" Bruce asked the room.
Then the meaning of what Tony just said finally caught up to Steve and it felt like a punch to his gut, a very unfair and painful punch that left him breathless.
✪✪✪                                                            ✪✪✪                                                             ✪✪✪
“Tony” he blurted out like an idiot, said man finally looked up at him, jutting his jaw stubbornly and his eyes were hard as they silently asked Steve to continue.
Everything was as fine as it could be until the next Wednesday, Steve as usual had went to Tony’s lab to hang out and Erik had been there waiting for Tony to arrive and clearly not expecting Steve to be in tow. He may have somehow guessed about Steve’s feelings because he had obnoxiously started flirting with Tony occasionally glancing at Steve to see his reactions.
me Rogers! What is wrong with you?” He got up and okay Steve was officially very confused and distressed now.
“What? Seriously? I’ve never seen them interact” Clint said.
Lehnsherr had stood behind Tony, hugging him from the back while he worked, brushing aside his hair, kissing his cheeks, calling him 'babe' all the time even if all he got was an irritated huff from Tony.
“I’m not straight, um- I’m bisexual” Steve mumbled, a little intimidated under Tony’s unnerving stare and he had gone very still, face devoid of any emotion. Steve knew there were so many things wrong with what Tony had told him but he couldn’t form a proper response, the words were all escaping his mental grasps.
There was no reason whatsoever that would make him question why this day was any different, but here he was, stunned frozen staring at Tony while he stammered out a confession that didn’t make much sense to the buzzing in Steve’s head.
"I have to go to Phil's for my evening shift"
“You’re gorgeous” He breathed out, unable to help himself. Tony turned his smile at him and Steve felt like he was staring at the fucking sun with the way his features light up, “You’re not so bad yourself” Tony said voice dropping an octave as he slowly looked over Steve's face and body.
“Are you sure?” Natasha asked.
He gingerly started to move, he had to see if his other friends were all crashing in the house like they had planned and he had to find Tony one way or another, he had to try explain himself.
He slammed his room door with a bit of unnecessary force and lied face down on the bed before even taking off his shoes. He felt completely drained by the day, which was funny because it was his most relaxing day of the week, usually.
“Oh Stevie” was all he said and sat down next to him without saying another word. They were there for a long time, Bucky a comforting presence on his side and he was so grateful for the silent comfort.
“Holy fuck! How are you still sitting up?” Tony sounded impressed and Steve preened and shrugged. Tony should always be impressed with him and give him all of his attention.
“You can hate me and not talk to me for however long you need. I completely understand and I won’t even bother you at all, I know I have no right to ask this of you but I just want to be your friend if you can please forgive me, I promise I won’t burden you with my feelings, I just don’t want you to cut me off. I won’t be able to handle that please Tony-”
“Just please listen to me, you can hate me however much you want afterwards but please let me finish” Tony stubbornly didn’t even acknowledge him and Steve took that as permission to start talking.
Fuck fuck
“But you said-”
“I’m sorry, I- well I don’t really remember the specifics of what I said last night but I’m so sorry Tony. I know I hurt you, I didn’t mean to but I did”
“Alright, who gave Steve drugs?” Clint asked the room.
And Tony bit him on his arm,
“It’s better now that you’re here. I missed you so much” Steve told him earnestly and Tony blinked and peered at him a little more closely. Steve tried very hard not to coo at the adorable confused look.
Surprisingly, it was Natasha who complained about how much time Tony was spending away from them, Steve had kept quiet even though he keenly agreed.
He really wanted to ask Lehnsherr to sit somewhere else but he didn’t want to sound like a petulant child so he kept quiet, glaring holes into his food.
Steve yelped in surprise and pain while Tony slipped out of his hold, he darted towards the door but Steve was faster and tackled him down on the floor.
When Steve Rogers woke up at 7am this morning, he firmly believed it was like any other Wednesday.
“You can’t possibly think I’m over you when I look at you like you’re the fucking sun every time you’re in the room. You can’t possibly think I’m in love with Erik when you make me forget about everyone else when you’re near, you’re impossible”
But Tony didn’t show up.
“You’re not straight” Tony repeated, deadpanned and jaw a little clenched, his expression was hard to see clearly because his head was getting fuzzy and Tony was getting blurry.
“Thank you?” Tony sounded very doubtful.
Bucky complained about it and looked at him weirdly till he made an excuse about not getting enough sleep last night due to his art history assignment which Bucky thankfully accepted as a proper excuse and got off his back about his behaviour.
Steve heaved a sigh, he rolled over the bed and took out his sketch book from his bedside drawer, maybe a little rough sketching will clear his mind.
Before Sam had the chance to answer Bucky butt in “Why are we talking about Steve’s bisexuality?” he was obnoxiously munching on a candy he pilfered from the counter.
“I’m so sorry, Tony, please, please-” Steve babbled and Tony shushed him gently while he helped him back on the couch. Steve was still crying, he didn’t know if it was in relief or the lingering pain. He was laid out on the couch and Tony crouched next to him, running his hand over Steve’s hair, calming him down and it felt so nice Steve never wanted him to stop.
He did what he, for some reason, had dreaded to do which was looking for gay porn on the internet. Steve wasn’t a virgin and he wouldn’t consider himself a prude or anything, but he had had sex only with Peggy, he had never liked having distant, emotionless sex with people he barely knew.
, having Tony in his arms telling him he loved him back was so overwhelming it made his eyes water.
“Heh. Don’t you glower at me. Here, take this” He shoved a mug with steaming rich coffee at Steve who grunted his thanks, not really in the mood to talk to anyone.
He turned to Sam who was rolling his eyes at their two friends antics and occasionally telling them to “Keep it down! you morons, your teams aren’t even playing tonight”.
Everyone was staring at him including Janet and Logan who were having a conversation with Pepper.
“Slow down, you idiot. You’ll make yourself sick” Bucky admonished with a sigh but he was already sipping his first beer too albeit a lot slower than him, Steve decided his advice was stupid and ignored it.
He was trying very very hard not to openly glare at the person sitting on
“Shush you, close your eyes. This is far from over. I’m expecting a very long and thorough explanation
That was dangerous territory and Steve was not supposed to be doing an analysis of his friendship with Tony just because of this and cheapen it to some plan concocted by Tony to get into his pants.
It was the rare day when their class schedules coordinate and they get to hang out just the two of them.
Bucky made an indignant sound and wrenched Steve’s hand off his face, “Look at me, punk. I know you can be oblivious about things sometimes, God help me no one knows that better than I do. But that doesn’t make you fucking stupid. You’re one of the best fucking people I know and if Tony stark is enough of an idiot to pass you up then that’s on him. Don’t go bad mouthing my best friend like that, ya hear?”
He missed Tony like a missing limb, he truly didn’t know he had become so dependent on his interactions with the younger man and now being deliberately deprived of that was a very rude and painful awakening.
It was sweet and taste a bit like wine but also not, it tasted kind of thick which didn’t make any sense.
After coming down from the high of his orgasm, Steve had taken a quick shower and had felt inexplicably guilty at imagining Tony like that at first, but then realised this solved all his reservations about pursuing a relationship with Tony.
Now he was beginning to wonder if there were a difference.
“It is truly unfortunate, he didn’t spare a single shoe. I was forced to drive barefooted to Jane’s home when he locked me out”, Thor didn’t even sound angry as he recounted the incident.
Bucky groaned longer and thumped his head on the sticky surface of the table. Both Steve and Sam wrinkled their nose in distaste.
Steve glared at him, he wasn’t really angry with Loki. He had accepted the drink after all, knowing full well what Loki was capable of but he was still annoyed at the unbridled glee on his face at seeing Steve’s very unfortunate predicament.
"Well, too bad for you we are in love~~" Tony singsonged and turned his head towards Steve, pulling him into a heated kiss.
But Steve was miserable, Tony had been hanging out with Erik’s friends more and more, sometimes even sitting with them during lunch. He hardly had time for them anymore and Steve felt neglected and despondent. He knew Tony always gave his all when something held his interest, and apparently that include relationships.
Steve chuckled and ducked his head to nuzzle affectionately at Tony's nose. It didn't feel awkward to be this physically affectionate with him at all, it felt like they have been doing this all their life, natural and easy.
“What the hell, Tones?” “Seriously?” Rhodey and Sam were asking incredulously while Thor was merrily congratulating them. Clint was asking rapid fire questions about when, where, why and how while Pepper was looking murderously at Tony. Natasha was quietly observing while Bucky was looking worriedly at Steve.
"Do you have anything important to do today?", Tony asked him as he twined their fingers together.
Tony was fidgeting from foot to foot and still babbling “I mean I’m sure you’re straight and all that but Pepper won’t let me
"Nothing else?" Tony's eyes sparkled mischievously.
And now Steve was the one sounding unsure of himself, he wanted to bash his head on the nearest surface because wasn’t he supposed to sound firm about his feelings or apparent lack thereof when rejecting someone, especially if that someone was your best friend.
He didn’t care if it was too early to say it or that they hadn’t even talked about being in a relationship. He loved Tony, it was an universal truth, just like the sun was a hot burning gaseous star, Steve Rogers loved Tony Stark and that was just a fact of the universe. He couldn’t
He pushed himself off the floor and immediately turned towards Tony again, casually pulling him into a back hug (He'd wanted to do this since he saw Lehnsherr do it to Tony in the lab). He felt an immense pleasure at the feeling of rightness at having Tony in his arms like this. He fit so perfectly against him, he was the perfect size for Steve to rest his chin on Tony's head while he cuddled him from behind.
Speaking of Tony, he still hadn’t texted or called Steve at all, not once during the weekend and this was a record for them, the longest time they’ve gone without seeing or talking to each other even if they were fighting.
“Hey there, stud muffin. Having fun?” Tony asked as he sat down on the floor next to Steve.
“Loki gave him a special wine of some sorts” Rhodey answered for him as he passed a bottle of beer to Tony.
Steve was too focused on the pain that he didn’t even hear the footsteps that approached him. He jerked when he felt a hand on his shoulder, he opened his eyes and inhaled sharply. Tony was there, he didn’t leave, he came back. Everything was tumbling around in his head, overwhelming him.
what keeping him glued to them?” Clint asked incredulously, “I thought it was Lehnsherr’s monster dick” he added unnecessarily.
He was mostly confused, he didn’t have any problem with the thought of Tony dating other men, he wasn’t a bigot,
“I know you said something about Erik not being your boyfriend anymore. Even with that, I hope you know i don’t expect anything from you please-”
“I’ll go get Thor and ask him about the drink” Pepper declared, amusement lacing her words. She was such a nice friend too, always doing things for others even though she was already plenty busy as a business studies major.
The more he thought about it that way, the more his confusion grew. Bucky had endlessly teased him about his crush on Peggy and Bernie and even Emily at one point, he didn’t know if those were also him admiring aesthetics or him having a crush on the people themselves, even just a bit.
“You’re just saying that to make me feel better” Steve huffed out bitterly.
Steve jumped at the voice and groaned as his headache spiked with the sudden movement.
And more than that he hated Erik Lehnsherr and really wanted to punch him in his smug handsome shark face.
Steve breath hitched, “I’m so fucking stupid, Buck” he burst out miserably.
“Maybe, but what do you have to be tired about? Heard you didn’t even hang out with Tony today”
“why would I do that? Tony, I would never do that! Why did you even think-”
“I love you too, you giant idiot”
He had started slow, thinking of a random person with big hands, rougher than a girl’s, stroking him. He groaned imagining the featureless man sinking to his knees and taking Steve’s dick in his hot, very wet mouth and it was incredible.
“Okay Tony, I understand” he tried not to sound as dejected as he felt.
He could hardly think about anything else that was not Tony. Even when he was talking to one of his friends, one thing they say or do would remind him of Tony which would inevitably lead him to space out of the conversation.
Steve was absolutely behind that idea because even though they weren’t close at the time and he wasn’t there for it, he knew it was bad, but Tony had been improving a lot in communicating what he wanted and even his feelings.
“Natasha! What did I tell you about sneaking up on me?” he exclaimed, mortified that he was so blatantly wearing his heart on his sleeves.
Tony was his usual cheerful self, sending Steve random memes anytime he felt like (Steve felt an unreasonably vicious amount of pleasure at that just because it means Tony was still thinking of him from time to time).
“This is like gross, watching mom and dad do the dirty or something Oh my god please stop eye-fucking each other. This is the kitchen! People eat food here, which I was just about to do before I discovered you two getting down and dirty and-”
Oh my god.
Tony didn’t show up at lunch. No one acted weirdly about that, everyone just nodded and accepted Pepper’s explanation that Tony was meeting with Professor Yinsen about one of his AI projects and would be busy for a few days, probably.
Bucky punched his arm lightly, “You just agreed to have an arm wrestling match with Logan” he whispered. He knew Steve too well and wasn’t fooled by the way Steve was trying very hard not to look confused at what exactly he just got himself into.
do that and Steve was being a complete idiot about this.
Steve’s heart dropped to his stomach “Oh”
, shit, having Tony like this was a sensuous and heady drug Steve was rapidly becoming addicted to.
He had never been good with this kind of thing, he had always been awkward and as subtle as a bull in a china shop and he was panicking a little.
“So Steve” that was Natasha coming to sit beside him on the floor, “tell me more about this brunette from History class”
“He seems cheery” Natasha commented dryly to Bucky.
“Tony” he whimpered pathetically, feeling tears welling up at the thought of what he was about to lose.
“And I never meant to come in between you and Erik, you have to believe me I know I have no right, he’s your boyfriend-”
“No, I’m not and uh- I didn’t want your shark, no uh what, your boyfriend-”
“What- but- Tony-”
That was how Bucky found him, a sweaty mess lying on the running tracks trying to block everything out.
“You rejected me by telling me you were straight! You said it to my fucking face and now you’re not? What was it huh? Did you not trust the man whore Tony Stark to not back off without lying to him?!” he was shouting, gesticulating around wildly with his hands.
Tony would
Lehnsherr smiled with teeth, like a shark.
“They’re working on something. Charles and Erik had a theory about mutation and it seems plausible enough that Tony wanted to research more with them” Rhodey answered.
“Steve…”
Their table was subdued, not really talking about anything, then Clint loudly cleared his throat, everyone including Lehnsherr and Tony looked at him.
Which only made the whole thing funnier when Natasha showed up to their usual table and Clint promptly shut up. Everything was completely normal.
"You shut up" Tony pointed at Loki, "This is your fault anyway. You made Steve drink your potion of doom!" his tone was gleeful instead of angry.
Steve tuned him out. They weren’t fucking, it was just a little bit of heavy kissing and exploring hands. They would have gotten right on the track of ‘fucking’ if they hadn’t been so rudely interrupted.
“Not because of you” Tony hurriedly add, “but I think a little bit of space would help me and will probably be healthy and better for our friendship” he said as if quoting from some book or someone else, probably his therapist or Pepper. She had been insisting on a healthy lifestyle and therapy for Tony after he had a breakdown last year.
“Thor’s evil brother? And you just drank it?” Clint screeched.
Steve was furiously chanting in his head while the others were exploding with a cacophony of questions.
And that was what hurts the most, the fact that he had built himself up to be more than those people in his head and had allowed himself to hope for something more. And now that he had realised his feelings for Tony which was so much more than just a fleeting fancy and closer to being terrifyingly in love than he had ever been, just to find out Tony had moved on and even had a boyfriend. An attractive, smart, charming boyfriend.
Steve shook his head.
He wished he could text Tony right now, even if it was some nonsensical conversation about how different metal react to different chemicals. But he refrained from texting first, barely.
It wasn’t like he never thought about Tony getting over him and moving on. No, he was quite aware that it was a possibility but he hadn’t wanted to dwell on it in case he lost his confidence. He knew Tony was an attractive guy (God, how he knows) and there were lots of people interested in him and not just because of the very thick wallet he came with.
“Are we- um- are we okay?” he asked Tony tentatively, terrified to even think that this would ruin one of the best friendships he’s had since joining college or even since meeting Bucky as a kid.
“I thought he’d give up after the whipped cream incident.”
“Anytime, Steve.”
Tony laughs and wraps a hand in Steve’s shirt to pull him closer. “You’re a menace, you know that?” His tone softens with a clear honey-drop of happiness.
Steve a little,” Nat allows, looking pointedly at Tony. “But if you think he doesn’t mean it, you’ve got another thing coming.”
Steve’s wearing glasses with thick black frames and round lenses, and they shouldn’t look right on him, but they do.
“That’s fine, he’s just looking for a little reassurance. Foggy’s great, he’s so creative with his designs and he’s really open and easy to talk to. I’ve always thought you guys would hit it off, actually! You could take this as a chance to get to know him.”
Steve skips dinner with the team in favor of destroying three punching bags in the gym. It doesn’t make him feel any better.
Tony watches Steve’s pupils dilate as he steps closer to Tony almost instinctively. One hand reaches out and hovers carefully over the lapel of Tony’s suit jacket, as if Steve wants to grab on and pull Tony close.
“Oh, that reminds me,” she says, sweeping one hand through her hair and sitting back up. “Steve, I have a friend in the class who’s doing costumes for Midsummer’s Night Dream for his final - he’s a bit hesitant about the direction he wants to go in, and I told him you’d be a great person to talk to about it. You helped out with costuming for the play back in high school, right?”
“Yep. I know you usually take your coffee black, but when you’re in a bad mood you actually take it with milk and three sugars. I know you like to read Jules Verne every Christmas. I know you once painted DUM-E purple when you were half-asleep and you were the one who lost Bruce’s pants that time. I know every single one of your smiles - yes, including that one. I know you steal my shirts to sleep in, no matter how many times you try to deny it. I know that Rhodey was the first friend you really trusted, and Pepper was the second. I know you think it’s cute when I sing show-tunes in the shower even when I’m horribly off-key. I know you are brave, loyal, and kind, and you have the heart of a hero. I know I’m lucky because I get to be the one next to you, to be the one to hold your hand.
“I knew you wouldn’t be able to resist.”
It’s like not being able to understand a picture until you turn it the right way around. And then it’s there in front of you, impossible to mistake for something else. Like looking into a partial reflection and seeing the rest of it, even without the light.
“He’s got it, don’t worry. Oh my god, Tony. Is this, did you—”
Maybe seeing Tony and Natasha being intimate and affectionate while playing a couple has rattled him more than expected, but that’s only because it’s so unlike them. Steve hasn’t seen Tony smile at anyone like that since he and Pepper broke up, and that was a long time ago, back during the Avengers’ first trial run and before they had reformed as a better and stronger team. He wonders if that means there hasn’t been anybody special in Tony’s life since then, as he hasn’t introduced anyone new to the team.
If he ever gets the courage to ask Tony out on a date like he’s been wanting to for months, he might even get a chance to kiss Tony on those sleepy mornings. Steve feels a sliver of want curl through him at the thought.
“Fine with me,” Steve says, wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders. “Just as long as you keep doing that, please.”
“Hey.” Foggy’s hand is warm as it covers Steve’s, and Steve fights the urge to brush a hand across his eyes when he looks back up at Foggy.
Steve laughs at her gesture and returns the pinky promise, feeling a lot lighter.
Nat says. Her musings are cut short by an outraged squawk from Tony, who sits back and points an accusing finger at Nat.
“If you stay, I’m sure I can provide you with a proper distraction,” Tony says, now sounding more awake by the second.
Tony’s heart thunders in his throat, and he wonders if it’s about to give out on him. Forty-three years on this planet, one too many near-death experiences, and this is how Tony’s gonna go.
Tony thinks about brushing the comment off with a flirtatious glance or a throaty laugh. He knows Steve would accept it as a temporary concession. One point for Steve. He would step away from the line they’ve been hovering over for weeks now. A line they’ve never yet tried to cross.
“Steve. Talk to me, honey. What’s wrong?” Tony’s voice is soft, tender. His hand moves away from petting Steve’s hair. Steve arches into the touch when he feels Tony’s hand now cupping his cheek, a murmur of satisfaction escaping him.
Steve bites his lip, considering his choices. “Dare,” he says finally, with a decisive nod.
“Oh, they look so adorable! I just love them together, don’t you?”
“Yeah, Nat got it for me. She said it’s the trendy thing to wear these days.” Steve meets Tony’s gaze head-on, eyes wide with what some might read as innocence but Tony knows to be anything but. One thing they had left out of the history books was Steve’s talent for sass.
Steve’s heart lurches painfully at the clear hurt in Tony’s voice, and a heavy pang of guilt sends his stomach sinking to the ground.
“You’re wearing the shirt I got you for your birthday.” Steve’s words are slow and measured, and there’s something in his tone that sends a shiver up Tony’s spine. Steve’s tongue darts out to wet his lips, and Tony’s so caught up in that little motion he almost misses Steve’s next words. “I like it. You look great.” He swallows, his eyes never leaving Tony’s face. “You look… very good.”
Death studies him, her dark eyes turning translucent.
Then, Steve’s thoughts are interrupted by his favorite voice in the world, the voice that makes Steve’s heart race like he’s just finished running a day-long marathon.
“I was thinking that the boulder was coming straight at you and you were going to be crushed,” Tony replies dryly, wincing as Steve presses a little harder on a deep cut on his forehead in retaliation.
“I think you’ve gotten it wrong,” Tony says, smirking, and Steve huffs a laugh into his hair. “After all, what’s yours is mine now. Which means I just took what rightfully belongs to me.”
A part of him had yearned to take the leap and make a move to find out if maybe Tony might feel the same, yearned to close the distance.
“Tell me.”
“Tony. I love you. I’m never going to be sorry for saving you, especially when the serum gives me much better odds at making it through in one piece. You know as well as I do that the armor isn’t infallible.”
“I’ve wanted to kiss you since you managed to trick me into thinking you didn’t know about the original trilogy’s Vader twist,” Tony says, swallowing Steve’s chuckle with a kiss.
Steve stretches his legs out in front of him, wiggling his toes in the pool of sunlight coming in through the window. The sound of a thud brings his attention to the other side of the room, where Bucky has apparently given up on studying and looks ready for a long nap.
“Why, Janet Van Dyne, you’re diabolical.” Tony sounds more than a little impressed. Steve has to agree.
“Are you alright? Why are you drowning in blankets?” Tony’s nose wrinkles at Steve’s question. Steve’s heartbeat speeds up at the sight, and he has to push away the urge to lean over and give the wrinkle a kiss.
“That’s where you’re wrong, babe. I do like it when you take it off though…”
He steps forward, only to be interrupted by an out of breath Clint barreling into the room. Steve watches as Clint spots the just-filled coffee mug in Tony’s hands and lights up.
“No wonder they call you a genius.”
Tony will never understand it, but he can appreciate the sight of Steve’s chiseled forearms whenever he rolls up his sleeves to help out with the cooking or to draw in his sketchbook. He supposes that’s adequate compensation. The choice of comfort over style isn’t entirely lost on Tony either, who knows he looks like a right mess whenever he’s in the workshop.
He pauses. “You mean just as someone I could be friends with, right? This isn’t a set-up?”
“Same here, Jan’s been telling me so much about you.”
“I know. Been missing you too.”
Then, before Steve can say another word, Tony is gone, only leaving behind the heavy clang of the door slamming shut behind him.
“You bring the snacks, I’ll bring the coffee.”
Steve glances up at Tony from beneath his long, golden eyelashes, his pretty blue eyes framed by those
Tony’s face pales at Natasha’s question, and next to him, Rhodey lets out a long, low whistle. “That’s a good one,” he says, sounding impressed.
“Steve was
adorning his head. Good god, it’s almost big enough to cover Steve’s
, like he’s ready to devour Tony if Tony gives him so much as a nod. Like he’s ready to take Tony apart with his mouth and hands and make his body sing.
He wonders what new resolutions he’ll have about Steve in the next new year.
But at least now Tony knows how much he means to Steve.
On any other night, he would have been thrilled at Tony’s question, relishing the chance to hold Tony close in his arms. But tonight, his nerves have been scraped raw by the many curious gossipers at the gala who have either been cooing after Clint and Tony or hounding Steve with questions, clearly angling for fresh details on the so-called hottest couple of the year.
Letting out a quiet sigh, Steve takes a long sip from his drink. The game has now moved on to Carol, who is being challenged by Rhodey to a dare of some sort. He also can’t help noticing Tony purposely avoiding his gaze, which stings more than Steve would like to admit.
Tony’s breath catches audibly in his throat. He wants to take those glasses that look absurdly perfect on Steve’s face and toss them aside. He wants to lean down and kiss the tiny marks left on Steve’s nose by those too-wide frames, even though he knows the serum will remove them in a matter of seconds.
Steve grabs his phone and speed dials three.
Steve gestures towards the hat. “So, what do you think?”
Steve sucks in a long deep breath, almost dropping his sketchpad onto the floor before his reflexes snap back in action. When he looks up, Tony’s frowning and looking closely at him. “You’re looking a bit flushed, Steve. Is everything okay?”
Tony’s hand clenches in Steve’s hair and Steve hears the sound of an unsteady exhale before Tony tilts his face up. Then his mouth is on Steve’s, hot and searching, sending a wave of bliss through Steve’s body as he wraps one hand around Tony’s wrist, sinking further into it as he deepens the angle of the kiss.
“Mrrffghhh.”
“No running,” Tony mutters, a petulant edge to his voice that Steve really shouldn’t find as endearing as he actually does.
She laughs. The sound chimes like the sweetest of bells. Steve’s breath catches in his throat before her next question takes it away.
“I missed you,” Steve tells him, and it’s not what he meant to say, but it comes out anyway. Because he had. It had been fascinating at first, getting to meet and interact with a younger version of Tony, but the fascination had quickly turned into horror when they had realized what each blast of the Time Stone meant.
“She caught me checking your ass out the other day.”
A loud crash above them has Steve raising his head in alarm, only to find Tony on the landing above them, gripping one side of the railing as he twists himself to the side to keep his balance. Steve dashes up the stairs, reaching out one hand to make sure Tony doesn’t fall.
“I don’t think it’s a beard, though. It’s more like…
“Good.” Steve steals another kiss from Tony’s lips, basking in the sound of his laughter. “Right back atcha.”
Foggy leans in to press a kiss to Matt’s cheek, and the happiness Steve feels for his new friend is so strong it blossoms into something like an ache in the middle of his chest.
“I’m mad at you.”
Steve settles into the silence between them, closing his eyes and securing his arms around Tony’s waist. He knows he should pull back, reassure Tony that he’s alright and everything’s fine. But the steady comfort of having Tony in his arms is so soothing, and it’s hard to move away. Steve lets himself hold on for a moment more, every touch a staunch reminder that Tony’s no longer at risk of being taken away by the orange glare of the Time Stone or Red Skull’s machinations.
“Jim! When did you get in? Tony said you wouldn’t be here ‘til tomorrow!”
Steve shakes his head. “I think this is the first time I’ve really put it properly into words. My friends are wonderful, and it’s not that I thought they wouldn’t be supportive if I said anything, but it always felt like something that I couldn’t explain, or just a problem I needed to figure out on my own.
“I had a crush on Captain America when I was a kid. But the truth is, I fell in love with Steve Rogers a long time ago.”
“I thought I’d lost you. You were bleeding out in my arms and I didn’t know if you’d make it.”
“Guys?”
Steve strokes one broad hand down Tony’s waist, as if wanting to calm him. A quiet sigh escapes Tony’s lips as he leans into Steve.
“We cleared out early, so I figured I’d pop by, see how everyone was up to. You, I haven’t seen in months, Stark.” The teasing glint in Sharon’s eyes undercuts the steel in her voice at the last sentence, and Tony slumps against her, huffing out a half-apologetic laugh. “I know, I know, I keep rescheduling on you, I’m sorry. I promise I won’t, next time.”
“I take back what I said -
“You better. In fact, you could be kissing me right now...”
“Are you saying I’m easy, Cap? I think I’m gonna have to reconsider my previous statement.”
He thinks of Tony, and in a heartbeat, the pang turns into something more like an ache.
“I knew I could take the hit. The serum would take care of it. Couldn’t let you get hurt.”
“I’ll give you twenty bucks if you turn that down, JARVIS,” Rhodey remarks, darting a quick glance at the ceiling from the other end of the room. He’s busy with his own upgrades to the War Machine armor and a possible new jet design. There’s something comforting in working side by side with his best friend again that Tony cherishes.
you’re the one who convinced him to give it a go.”
The press of Tony’s lips against his hairline is a sweet and welcome familiarity, one that Steve will never get enough of. Tony hums against Steve’s skin, his lips brushing Steve’s forehead with every tiny movement. Steve feels the vibration of it echoing through his body, down to the soles of his feet, steadying him.
“Wait till you see the ring. DUM-E, be careful with that.”
“If you need some, ahem, convincing, I think I’m up for the job.”
- before moving on to the tiny inscription engraved on the edges of the cufflinks.
“Well, you remember all those fantasies you had when I suggested that I could model for you?” Tony asks, leaning back with a long, exaggerated stretch.
Nat lets out a hum, and Steve knows without looking at her that she’s unconvinced.
“You should have yelled for me to move, not thrown yourself at me to get me out of the way,” Steve retorts, his breath hitching in his throat as he forces himself not to raise his voice any further.
“And I love you,” he adds, holding Tony’s gaze with his own, a soft smile blooming across his face.
It’s good to be home.
He had been so distracted by his own feelings for Tony, he’d failed to realize how much he’d hurt Tony by pulling away from him. Now Steve’s ruined everything, and Tony doesn’t even know the truth yet.
All this time, Steve didn’t know his own heart until he saw Tony’s clearly. Now that he has, he doesn’t understand how it took him so long to see it when it was there all along.
Steve flushes and rubs nervously at the back of his neck. “Oh, I’m sure you’ll do fine, Tony.”
“I’m sure you weren’t expecting to talk someone through a big realization today, but thank you for giving me the words.”
“You found my hiding place.”
Sharon looks up at him, assessing. “So what are you waiting for?”
“Yes,” he says quickly nodding. Maybe a touch too fast, judging from the muffled chuckle coming from Sharon’s direction.
“Of course.” Tony blinks, frowning. “You know you always—”
They look good together - Natasha and Tony - and it’s easy to see why people would fall so easily for the story of Black Widow and Iron Man being a couple. Their banter is seamless as they exchange happy smiles and gaze into each other’s eyes. It’s so effortless, it almost seems real. Steve swallows hard, his throat tight. He knows Natasha’s been seeing Pepper for a while now, even if they’re keeping things relatively private, and that they’re happy together. He shouldn’t be dwelling on the idea of Natasha and Tony as a real couple because it will never happen. Still, the thought leaves a tight, uncomfortable feeling in Steve’s chest.
“I know you’re my favorite,” Tony says. And maybe he had meant for it to come out as innuendo, but his words turn gentle at the end, entirely sincere and more than a little careful.
It’s one of Steve’s favorite ways to start his morning.
Steve gives a watery laugh. “Even if the feelings in question might never be returned and I’d be risking one of my most important friendships if I ever said anything?”
Tony’s apparently watching Clint and Bucky engage in a bizarre kind of dance-off. Steve thinks he’s better off knowing as little about this as possible.
“Hey, Tony, looking for me?” Steve asks in what he hopes is a normal tone, before realizing what he just said.
Steve gives him what he hopes is a passable smile in return. “JARVIS, would you mind zooming in on the video?” he asks after a moment.
He reaches for his shield as a Doombot tries to tackle him from his left, destroying it easily with one throw. Tony stands beside him, gauntlets directed towards other approaching Doombots. “Hey, Tony. After we’re done with clean-up here, would you like to—”
Jan beams at him and holds out her hand with her little finger extended. “Of course.”
“As fun as it is watching Cap spontaneously combust while trying to turn invisible, I really don’t want to hear the end of that sentence. Bruce, you owe me twenty bucks.”
“Enough,” Steve answers finally, tightening his hand on the shield by his side. “I would give enough to change things.”
It had been wonderful.
“So, if you got Thor a Hulk hoodie because Bruce is his favorite, does that mean I’m your favorite?” Tony has no idea how he finally got his vocal cords to start working properly again, but he’ll take it as a small win.
The feeling is a familiar one. Steve sinks into it with more than a touch of relief, letting Tony’s proximity put him at ease.
One more step and their faces are suddenly so close, Tony can count each of Steve’s brown, gold-flecked eyelashes if he wanted to. He takes a deep breath and stands on his tiptoes,  moving past the luscious temptation of Steve’s very pink lips to whisper into his ear. His own mouth grazes Steve’s earlobe as he begins to speak, and Tony swears he hears Steve’s breath hitch a little in his throat.
Steve turns away, suddenly in no mood for breakfast.
“Glad to hear it. After all, it’d be a shame if I needed to win over my own boyfriend. And I’m glad DUM-E likes me too, I’d hate to have to go find another art assistant.”
“Stuff it,” Bucky retorts, but it’s mostly good-natured, and Steve sees him hide a smile behind his yawn.
“Do you want to dance?” Steve’s question interrupts Tony’s words, stumbling out of his mouth in a rush like he thinks he might run out of time otherwise. His gaze settles on Sharon for a second before turning back to Tony.
“Are we really so tiresome that you’d prefer the company of a good book and a stiff drink to a night on the town with us?”
“Tony? Are you here? Open up!” Steve raises his hand to knock again, only to find himself falling forward when the door is wrenched open to reveal a misshapen, lumpy figure.
“Tony—”
Steve smiles as he feels Tony stir beside him. He leans over to brush Tony’s hair out of his eyes before kissing him gently on the forehead.
on a train track, you idiot.”
All Steve had wanted then was Tony back.
Steve thinks of how he’s felt around Tony for the past few months, everything he’s tried to brush aside and hide from because he didn’t understand it, or didn’t know how to.
“The longest. Honestly, this whole week’s been a nightmare - the specs I sent over to R&D need to be completely redone, Fury keeps chasing me on new updates for the helicarrier… we’ve been out on three calls this week and it’s only Thursday. I feel like this is the longest we’ve had some time to ourselves for days.”
That doesn’t mean it’s going to go anywhere, though. He’s not going to risk messing up an amazing friendship for confusing feelings he doesn’t even understand himself, especially when he doesn’t know if they’ll last. God knows romance isn’t exactly something he’s familiar with.
“Oh? You were that confident I’d agree to stay in bed?”
Their banter had been so easy and familiar, but Steve had also kept noticing how handsome Tony looked in his dark navy shirt and blue jeans, the way Tony kept blushing whenever Steve’s hand ended up near his whenever they both reached for the popcorn bowl at the same time. It made him hope, desperately.
It’s Clint and Tony dancing at last night’s gala. Tony’s head is thrown back in that loud laugh that Steve loves so much as Clint grins at him in the photo.
“Oh.” The disappointment on Tony’s face at Steve’s response stings, and a small part of him wonders if there’s something more than disappointment there, but Steve pushes it away. There’s no need for him to dwell on more false hopes.
“No! I mean, yes! Not…” Steve rubs a hand over his face, his skin heating in embarrassment. He wishes the floor would open up under him right now just so he doesn’t have to have this conversation. He’d even take a fight with Red Skull over this.
“They’ve got fantastic scones,” Steve suggests.
“Jan, have you seen Tony? I thought he’d be at the labs today but I can’t find him, and Bruce is away from campus until next week.”
“Something wrong, Cap?” Nat asks, shifting in her seat as she makes a grab for the popcorn bowl in Thor’s hands.
He tells her his request. The words fall quickly from his lips after being carried around for so long, a careful secret tucked in the corner of his mouth. Once Steve’s finished, it almost feels like he’s lost something, like she’s rummaged around in his chest and stolen something important.
Steve sees Tony tracking the movement of his hand. Perhaps it’s a trick of firelight, but for a moment, Steve swears that Tony’s face falls in response.
Steve laughs, and Tony sees him nodding in agreement out of the corner of his eye. “Bruce made his famous chili tacos.”
Tony wants that—wants to be marked by Steve. He wants to see red marks on his skin and know that Steve left them there, that he’d wanted Tony too much to hold back and be polite with his desires, that he, Tony Stark, could make Steve lose some of his carefully curated control.
“...”
“Tony!”
“Hmm?”
“I do. Beyond anything.”
Over the next few days, Steve uses up so many pages of his sketchpad that he ends up having to buy a new one.
“How did you know, that you were in love?” Steve asks, his heart in his throat. Foggy blinks.
smartass.”
“She caught me in the kitchen wearing your shirt. I tried to tell her it was to make fun of your ridiculous fashion sense, but I don’t think she bought it.”
It would be easy to excuse it as practice, of course. He’s done enough sketches of Jim and Pepper for this not to seem out of the ordinary. But for some reason, a part of Steve balks at anyone else seeing these attempts, especially Tony.
Tony Stark has proven himself to be more of an enigma than Steve could have ever imagined.
Tony feels a laugh bubble past his throat to his lips when he realizes just exactly what Steve is trying to say. He presses a hard kiss to Steve’s mouth and laces their fingers together.
“I still don’t mind waiting. I just hope that when it happens, it’ll be important. I don’t want to have a first kiss just so I can cross it off my list of life experiences. And I want it to be with someone who really wants my first kiss too.”
Pepper laughs until she cries over the video. Tony remembers the worried frown on Steve’s face when he’d pulled Tony into his arms and steered him away from the wall.
“Steve.” Jan’s voice is knowing, and just a little smug. “I know so.”
There are many tales and stories told of Death. Steve has heard many of them on his journeys.
“Smartass.”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to jump in like that.” Foggy shakes his head, looking curiously at Steve.
“That’s a low blow, Fog, a low blow,” Matt retorts, laughing.
“What kind of nickname is Foggy, anyway?” Bucky says, leaning precariously back in his chair to catch his pencil.
There had been Peggy, and one long summer of thinking about her and wondering if she also felt the same way he did, excited and fluttery whenever they hung out. But she had moved away before the start of the new school year, and nothing came of it other than what was now a steady friendship sustained over emails and the occasional call.
“Boys, quit flirting,” Nat orders, looking back down at her notes. Steve bites back a grin at Bucky’s look of flustered confusion as Jan giggles.
Steve traces one finger over the intertwined silver letters at the center -
He imagines trying to explain it, the way he feels when he sees Tony put away the job for a little while and smile just for himself, when he spots Tony looking at him across their campfires and how he’s still trying to figure out how to express that through his art. Something very much like panic lodges itself in his ribs, though he’s not sure why.
Tony grins a Cheshire-cat victory smile at that, only to turn away for a moment.
“She’s amazing,” Steve agrees with a smile. He doesn’t get to see Pepper very often these days with how busy she is, but they still keep up a semi-regular correspondence via text about art, books they’ve managed to read recently, and of course, Tony.
“The world needs him. It shouldn’t have ended that way, not for him. His life—”
“You know JARVIS could have let us out any time, Tony.”
“You were
He just doesn’t know what the hell he wants to do about it.
“You’re mine too,” Steve replies. His eyes are locked on Tony’s. Somehow, Tony thinks Steve is talking about more than Tony being his favorite Avenger. There’s a swooping feeling in his stomach at the thought, like Tony’s standing on the edge of a cliff, unsure of whether to jump or stand back, but it also leaves him feeling warm.
Hell, even with Rhodey here, he’s having a lot of trouble coming up with reasons why he shouldn’t do just that.
“I saw you dancing with Tony. You guys looked like you were having fun.” There’s a speculative note in her voice, and Steve feels his face heat a little, even though he knows there’s no reason to blush.
From the determined look in Steve’s eyes, Tony knows this isn’t over. Steve Rogers is not one to back down from a challenge - but Tony Stark isn’t either.
“Yeah, you know, I could get dressed up in a suit, or whatever you want, and you could draw me,” Tony says, reaching up to loosen the knot of his tie and leaning back with a sigh. “I’m at your disposal.”
Tony skids to a halt in front of the couch Steve is currently sitting on, feeling his stomach fall to his feet.
Not that Steve minds, really. He knows he’s been the cause of Tony arriving late to the lab more than once over the last three months since they’ve gotten together, and he has no regrets about it.
Steve reaches for another glass of champagne. He really, really wishes he could get drunk right now.
“Yeah, or maybe it’s the culmination of
Darting next to Tony, Clint takes the mug from him in a flash, before pressing a sloppy kiss to Tony’s cheek. “I’ll take that. Thanks, honey.” Steve’s heart thuds painfully in his chest. He resists the sudden and very strong urge to shove Clint away from Tony.
“But it’s good,” Foggy says, and the joy in his voice is so clear that Steve’s heart clenches in his chest for a moment. “It’s better than I ever imagined, and I’d spent so long thinking about it. Because it’s not perfect, but it’s real.”
“I love you,” Steve whispers, his voice cracking on the last word.
Steve lifts one hand to push his glasses up his nose.
Steve rubs a hand over his knee. “I was a little nervous about meeting up with you today because I wasn’t sure if Jan had clarified with you that this wasn’t a set-up or anything, but I’m really glad we did this,” he says.
“Nat definitely knows about us now.”
“Tony, I’m in love with you.”
Or he could try something entirely different.
“Any thoughts on that happening, I don’t know, now?”
“What’s wrong?”
“Yeah. Fantastic,” Steve echoes into the empty room.
A series of
Steve easily reads the question in Tony’s scattered words. “I knew you weren’t together but I didn’t like the idea of everyone else believing and wanting you and Clint to be in love.” He swallows. “I hated it.”
Foggy eyes him with a knowing gaze. “Hits you like a ton of bricks, doesn’t it?”
Steve blinks, feeling a little like he’s been hit over the head with something heavy. Around him, Steve hears a chorus of “awww”s and “how cute”s from everyone else, and what he thinks is a sound of agreement from Scott. He blinks again, Tony’s quiet, mumbled confession echoing in his head.
Tony watches the soft delight bloom across Steve’s face and tries to pretend like his heart isn’t trying to beat right out of his chest. The words say everything he doesn’t yet know how to voice to Steve, and he doesn’t know if it’ll be too much when he finally does.
“And here I was putting all of my faith in Steve. Bad show, Rogers.”
trying to avoid their feelings until they’re staring right at them,” Clint suggests, and Steve doesn’t even have time to try and formulate a reply to that before Sam shushes him with a well-aimed kick to the foot. “Hey, I said
It’s only later that Steve realizes Tony wore his jacket for the entire party, and the thought has him smiling all the way back to his dorm room.
Tony lifts his gaze to Steve’s face, feeling more than a little dazed. Steve is blushing deeply, dark red blotching his cheeks, and Tony aches with how much he wants him. He’s sure he must look a sight as well. All they’ve done so far is kiss, and yet Tony feels like he’s more than halfway to being ravished right now.
Steve knows immediately from the note of false cheer in Tony’s voice that something’s wrong. “I was just telling the lovely Miss Carlota here that although I am heartbroken to leave her presence, we unfortunately have urgent business that requires our attention and must bid her farewell.”
“Of course not, I’ve always been your favorite.”
It takes him years, but Steve finds Death in the end.
“Mr. Confident, are we?”
“And you… you love me.” Tony tests the words out carefully, still looking more than a little hesitant. Steve can’t help but beam up at Tony, and he pulls Tony forward with both hands.
His life for Tony’s would have been the easy choice. This was much, much, harder.
“I’m demiromantic. It means that if I do experience romantic feelings for someone, it’ll only happen after I get to know them very well.” Steve smiles as he thinks of Tony, and something tight unfurls in his chest. “It’s finally making sense to me now, why I always felt like I couldn’t relate when most people talked about love and dating in high school, and why blind dates or speed dating aren’t for me.”
“I’m fine, Buck. I have something to tell you guys.” He takes a deep breath. “It’s a good thing, I just needed some time to wrap my head around it.”
“Actually, I haven’t seen him for a few days. Not since he dropped by my room on Tuesday. He seemed kind of jittery and out of it, so I thought maybe he just pulled another all-nighter and needed some sleep.”
“Caught you.”
“We’re not,” Tony breathes, staring up at Steve, and it’s only then that Steve realizes his finger is still on Tony’s lips. He blushes and opens his mouth to apologize, only to find Tony’s own fingers circling his own wrist, moving Steve’s finger just a little until it lingers on the edge of Tony’s bottom lip.
“I can protect myself fine on the field, Steve!”
“You see right through me.”
“Suit yourself, Steve.” The hesitant smile that Tony aims in Steve’s direction is more than worth the loss of a couple hours of sleep, even if Steve grumbles about it in the morning.
“It’s great to meet you, Matt,” Steve says, grinning a little when he sees them both blink rapidly before refocusing on him, evidently having gotten caught up in the other person. “Foggy’s been singing your praises.”
“I don’t know, Sharon,” Tony says, raising one hand to tug at his shirt collar. The room is packed, and it’s starting to feel a little warm. Her face is gentle with understanding when he looks up to meet her eyes, her hand on his arm, and the nervousness in Tony’s chest settles a little.
“I know it’s late, but I was thinking we could order in from Di Napoli, go to the cinema… if you pick a bad movie we can make out for most of it in the back row like we did that time we went to see—”
“You better watch out, Wilson, or I’ll—”
It feels like they’re the only two people left in the world.
“Guys, Hulk’s about to demolish Cap’s birthday cake, so I think— OH GOD, MY EYES!”
“I know it’s not easy to talk about this, and it means a lot that you’re comfortable opening up to me about it.”
“Maybe I was hoping you’d take it off,” Steve counters.
Steve thinks of how sketching Tony has felt second-nature for a long time, and grimaces at the thought that his feelings must have been obvious to everyone long before he realized (a voice in his head that sounds suspiciously like Natasha’s adds, “extremely obvious.”)
“Really? I never noticed, even after two years of dating. I’m stunned. Someone should call up the Daily Bugle and give them the scoop, this is completely new information.”
“Mhm. Though waking up next to you in the morning is pretty great.”
Steve shakes his head. “I wouldn’t dream of it, Foggy.” He pauses. “Do you have a second?”
“Yeah, you know him?”
“Morning, sleepyhead.” Steve’s grin turns into a laugh when Tony makes a sound like a disgruntled cat in response.
“And I like the look of you wearing my shirt.”
Tony hums happily to himself as he scribbles a measurement adjustment on his plans for the new Mark VIII, the sound of AC/DC pounding so loudly through the workshop that the floor is almost vibrating.
If you choose your memories, he will return to you, and you will see him as a stranger.”
his brain yells back.
“I didn’t know you were coming. Nat said you were stuck finishing up a stint in France.”
“And yet,” Death muses, “you did lose him.” Wisps of air trail off her fingers before disappearing into nothing. Steve blinks hard to keep her in his sights as her shape starts to blur.
“I mean, even if I didn’t have these feelings,” Foggy says, “and boy, do I wish I didn’t, I don’t do blind dates.”
Steve turns to Tony with a grin, leaning comfortably against the kitchen counter as he sips from his own “I’m lazy and I don’t care” cat mug. It was a gag gift from Thor that Steve unabashedly adores.
“I know how I feel and I know that there’s nothing wrong with me just because romance might work differently for me than it does for most other people.” Steve releases a slightly watery sigh. “I know it now, and I’m happy.”
“I didn’t know,” Steve breathes out in a whisper, awed. All this time, every time Tony’s looked at him in a way Steve couldn’t understand, every time his expression had eluded Steve's art, that’s what it’d meant.
“You know, Steve, I think DUM-E likes you. Maybe I like you too.”
“Not a chance, you handsome duck.”
this undercover operation was a bad idea. He just didn’t think it’d be because he’d be sucker-punched with the fact that he’s head over heels in love with Tony. Who is his best friend, and who definitely doesn’t return his feelings.
Steve smiles, his mouth very nearly brushing against Tony’s lips.
It had started last New Year’s Eve when Tony had gotten drunk on Thor’s mead and woken up in the workshop to a list of resolutions he hadn’t remembered making. They had ranged from ‘convince Clint to dye his hair purple for a week’ to ‘set honeybear up on a blind date with Carol’, and most of them had been completely ridiculous. One caught his attention though:
“He looked good in your football jacket.”  When Steve looks across at Jan, there’s a tiny grin spreading across her face. He laughs and rubs a hand across his face.
"Now, what do you say to me taking you to my bedroom and peeling these ridiculous jeans off of you so I can appreciate how much better you look out of them?”
Tony.
In the end, he had said nothing. Steve’s not sure if he feels more relieved or disappointed about that.
Only it’s now one hour until midnight and he’s still standing here, not doing a single thing about what he wants.
“Tony, oh my god…”
“Yes.” Steve shoves his hands into his pockets. “For now, it’s on pause, but I’ll let you know how it goes.”
“It’s not you, Steve, it’s me!” Steve jumps back as Tony stalks in front of him, looking furious. There’s something painful in Tony’s eyes that Steve wishes he could wipe away, but all he can manage in the moment is to gape at Tony in wide-eyed astonishment.
Once he’s made sure it’s perfect, Steve steps back with a satisfied smile. He looks up at Tony, only to find Tony already looking at him, a dark, indecipherable look in his eyes that almost makes Steve lose his footing.
,” Tony allows, letting his eyes linger on Steve’s face. He tries his best to avoid looking at the beanie, but it’s a lost cause. “Whatever floats your boat, Cap.”
“Last week when you were on the tail-end of that three-day bender fixing Mark XI, you came into the kitchen, kissed me on the cheek, and called me sunshine.”
Steve lifts his head as something else occurs to him. “JARVIS, is Tony around?”
“I just took a shower,” Steve explains, tossing his used towel into the laundry basket. When he turns to face Tony again, Tony’s expression looks almost glassy. It’s gone with a shake of his head and Steve wonders if he had imagined it.
“So, you want to go grab a bite? There’s this new exhibit on dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History I’ve been meaning to check out, and I thought you might like to come along as well. I think you’d have fun.”
The voice in his head sounds a little like Rhodey.
“Oh.” Steve leans back on his heels, trying to ignore his immediate disappointment. It’s no big deal. He’ll just look for Tony after getting some rest. He definitely needs a nap, anyway.
“You’re kind of wonderful, you know that, Rogers?”
He had brushed it off as a joke at first, simply his subconscious’ way of dealing with the not-sizeable-at-all crush he’d started nursing on Steve for a while now. Maybe for longer than a while, maybe ever since he’d woken up from the darkness of space to the sight of Steve’s bright blue eyes and the quiet happiness on his face when he saw that Tony was alright. But that was all it was, just a crush. Nothing more, and certainly nothing Tony couldn’t deal with discretely before it grew into something with strings, with feelings.
“I’ll give it a shot, anything’s better than listening to you whine about it,” Sam offers with a smirk, twirling in his chair on Bucky’s other side.
Nat shrugs. “I’m not sure, but from what I saw, I’d say Murdock’s more than a little smitten.”
Then, Steve lets go of his restraint and does what he’s been dreaming about for months; he kisses Tony.
“Drinks, dancing, friends, my dazzling presence… What more could you want, Steve?” Tony fiddles with the knot of his tie, peering encouragingly at Steve from under his eyelashes before returning his attention to his suit once again. “How will we enjoy ourselves without you?”
For the rest of the night, Steve feels subdued, distracted by Tony’s words playing on a loop in his head.
Tony waves a hand. “Let him in, J.”
“Can I crash here for a bit?” Tony asks, raising one hand up to hide an enormous yawn. “Bruce is still not done with lab work and I locked myself out of our room again.”
If Tony’s calculations are right, he’ll get Steve to crack in five days. Then, he’ll have his hands full with a gorgeous super soldier in his bed, hopefully for good.
Rhodey throws an arm around Tony’s shoulder and drags him forward. “Come on, you too. I don’t need to ask JARVIS to know it’s been far too long since you’ve had food that isn’t blueberries or some of DUM-E’s green goop.”
“I figured as much. Does this mean we don’t have to make a big announcement now?”
echo through his chest at the idea that Steve might feel uncertain about this.
“Tony, are you alright? What happened?”
“I overheard you and Jan talking that night at the party. When you said that you wanted your first kiss to be with someone who really wanted it, I realized that someone was me. And I had all these plans to woo you and I wanted it to be perfect, but then Jan told me about Foggy, and I thought she meant that you two were together now, that I wouldn’t even get a chance to show you how much you mean to me.”
.” And not just any beanie. The blue monstrosity sits innocently on Steve’s head, with neat white lettering spelling out “YOLO” on the front.
“Anyway. Steve, what do you say? Foggy’s really sweet and I’ve talked his ear off about you all semester. I’m sure you guys would have a great time together.” Jan pushes her notes aside and gets off the bed, perching beside the window nook.
Steve watches Tony covertly in the glow of the firelight, eyes tracing over Tony’s animated movements as he trades jokes with Jim on the opposite side of the camp. His eager gestures are easy to memorize. If only they were just as easily captured on the page.
Steve grins up at Tony as he releases his grip on the armor. “Thanks for the assist, Iron Man.”
Tony’s tone is unmistakably fond, and the warmth of his words wrap around Steve like a homemade comfort, like coming home to a pair of kind eyes and a soft smile at the end of a long day.
A loud crash behind them makes Clint wince, and he shoves the half-empty mug back into Tony’s hands. “I think that’s my cue.” As Clint races from the room, Tony stares after him before shrugging and returning his attention to his coffee.
