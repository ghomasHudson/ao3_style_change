Pietro shooked his head, crying softly against Thor's shoulder. "Y-you're r-really gonna take c-care of me! And I don't have to g-go hungry all the time."
Thor held him on his hip again, "You wish to seat in the blue?" Pietro nodded to the question, causing Thor to chuckle. "The deep blue or sky blue with the little clouds on the seat?"
Steve could only guess based on his other experiences with littles as to what might be happening. He knew of a few from difficult situations who feared what might happen. He rest his chin on Pietro's head. "Don't worry about a thing kiddo. We will take care of everything. We will find you a caregiver and get this all sorted out. Don't you worry kiddo."
"Good boy!" Steve smiled and ruffled his hair, nearly cooing over him when Pietro blushed timidly. "Are you....five?"
Steve was touched, giving Thor a firm nod. "Thank you Thor, let's me see if we can coax Pietro out."
Thor smiled and wrapped his arms around him. "I think we are going to be just fine. Our Thunderfamily will be just fine."
Steve sighed and shook his head. "Have you checked on the boys yet? I went to play with them while Pietro was being tested and James was getting a bit cranky."
Pietro heard Steve sigh softly and the next thing he knew, the super soldier's hand came swatting down against his bottom. It may have just been a single swat but it stung. He gasped, freezing his attempt to get free and rubbed his backside. "Ow!"
Unfortunately Pietro wouldn't quit his squirming. Reasoning with him never worked, in fact it only gave him more fuel to fight against them. He tried to shove Steve but it was no use, he was held in place. But he didn't expect what came next.
Thor turned to face him with an amused look on his face. "As you wish, little one." The Asgardian moved the high chair closer to where he was making breakfast before turning and finishing everything up. Once he was done, Thor scooped an omelette onto the tray of the high chair. "Bon appetit."
"Absolutely fucking not! Sister doesn't have to do this!" Pietro yelled at him, trying to squirm his way out of Steve's grasp.
Tony was already on it, swiping through his phone and ordering various things for home delivery. "We do have a couple of things for him, the rest will be delivered later. The team and I had a bet what he would be classified as. I was betting on a little and had a wide range of stuff delivered in case I was right." Tony pulled out a large drawer filled to the brim with diapers and clothes for ages 0-10 all designed to fit Pietro. "Looks like I win, and you can bet your ass I'll be gloating the whole day."
The silverette's jaw clenched and he looked down with a pained expression. "Who would want a troubled, bratty, outcast, tall, unstable guy for a little? You're fooling yourself."
"I don't want to be a fucking little! The classification test is bullshit!" Pietro stood up and started yelling.
When Pietro nodded once again, he slid the test towards him and handed the speedster a pen. "You may get started."
Steve rubbed his temples. Pietro was seventeen then. He wouldn't have been able to be classified yet. But now he was in his twenties. And as an American citizen, he would need to abide by their laws. "Ours is less intense. We have someone come to your home or if you prefer, there are testing centers. They administer a written test along with some verbal questions and so forth, and that's that. Our laws may differ from what you're used to but nothing too drastic will change. But you are past the acceptable waiting time. We have a classification specialist waiting in the tower. We have to do this Pietro, for your own good."
Pietro mumbled something in his native tongue before looking back to Steve. "We register for a class of fifty. We are given tasks over eight hours and the observers does the watchings. In the normal, there are five observers and you don't know who is assigned to you. They call out your classification with the paper work at the end of the course, in front of all the others.  It is legal requirement to attend before your twentieth birthday."
Thor chuckled. "Easy, child of mine. Easy. There is plenty to eat. You will never go hungry again, little one." He meant this to be comforting, something to soothe the boy. So, he was surprised when the silverette gasped and tears began to well up in his eyes. What Thor didn't know was how common it was for him to go hungry for most of his life. He had to fight for survival since birth. Having access to food wasn't always available to him. That was what sunk all of the nurturing in. He wouldn't have to worry about his next meal. Thor was truly going to take care of him.
"I take it, we don't even need to ask what his results were?" Tony said, stepping forward. He raised his eyebrow at the pair with a knowing look.
Just as he thought he was going to get up and get back dressed, he felt a much softer fabric sliding up his legs and stopping around his hip and Steve pulled him to sit up.
Soon enough, Thor was bouncing him and patting his back. "You shall never hunger and never be neglected of love and affection ever again. Sweet baby boy." Thor kissed his forehead. "Captain of America, I request for us to stay until morning. I fear young Thorson may not be need some time to adjust before we make the journey." He made his way to the living room and sat on the couch, setting Pietro on his lap.
Steve got in his face, "I mean 'Tro. You will take that test or there will be plenty more of that. Got it?"
While Pietro was distracted by his food, Steve walked to Thor to discuss Pietro's future. "What is your plan? We can set up a floor of the tower for you to live on a more permanent basis."
Steve and Tony made the decision to let James and Peter sleep in more and wake Pietro up a bit early in order to help the Maximoff boy settle into everything. Both caregivers were anticipating Pietro being a bit difficult considering the little outburst earlier. Opening the boys door, they entered the room and quickly had the AI system lock it.
Pietro's eyes widened and Steve came forward, putting his hands under his armpits and lifting him up. Pietro found himself put on a table and he quickly sat up but the super soldier placed a hand on his chest and pushed him back down. "Ah, ah. No fighting. Do I need to remind you what will happen?"
The speedster glared at him and turned his head away. But it didn't stop Thor from leaning in and planting a kiss on top of his messy, silver hair. "On Asgard there are a multitude of possible test options and not as many littles as one may think. You are special and I wish you not forget that. You shall be the perfect match for a very lucky caregiver. If you give them a chance."
Pietro squirmed around more, hoping to get out of his grasp. He couldn't believe it, the Captain had the audacity to pick him up and carry him as if he were some subordinate! "Release me, you popsicle maniac!"
"Papa...stop!" Pietro crossed his arms on the tray of the high chair and buried his face against it, his cheeks reddening a bit. A few moments later, he felt the soft touch of Thor's lips on the top of his head as the God of Thunder lay a kiss.  The speedster let out a soft sigh, his neurotic complaints coming to a halt as he lifted his head up to look at his caregiver. A plate of eggs and sausage was put on the tray and Pietro didn't hesitate to scarf it all down.
Tony raised an eyebrow at the question. They've interacted with enough new littles to know the process. They never wanted to accept themselves in the beginning. It was a hard adjustment. But  the little could feel what their age range was. "We are going to have to set the mood and ask him. If he refuses, we will get tough and not give him much of a choice."
"Blue!" Pietro blurted out, covering his mouth when he did so. Why did he care? It was just a chair.
"Captain of America, Pietro is my little. He shall be welcome as a Thorson, I am the King and they shall respect that. In Asgard, classifications are taken most seriously. He shall come home with me and he shall be my Prince." Thor bent down and squeezed Pietro's cheek, making the speedster squirm away.
Pietro shook his head frantically, running his fingers through his hair in a fit of stress. "God! What is Wanda going to think?! I can't be a little! You get that man back here and have him take it back! I demand a redo!"
Great. It was Captain America, himself. Pietro rolled over and sat up in the bed, shooting Steve an irritated look. "What is so important you must to wake up me?"
Pietro caught his breath, breaking away from Steve and clenching his fists. "No! I can't be! Not one of those!"
Steve rubbed his face tiredly. "I will figure something out. I will go talk to him." As he heading out of the room and down the hallway, Thor grabbed Steve's hand. He and Bruce had been chatting privately. "Captain, if I am deemed worthy. It would be an honor to take the boy in." Before Steve could reply, Thor was already offering an explanation. "On Asgard, I was classified as a caregiver. To live in accordance with midgard laws, I have taken your test and still classify as caregiver status. I wish to see the boy before we make any life altering decisions."
"Perfect. The first portion is a twenty question multiple choice exam. It will be followed by an interview of sorts. Understand?"
Pietro didn't know what to say. Of course he had suspicions about himself, but he had fought it for so long and denied himself the headspace when it started to slip. He anxiously looked between the two men and surprisingly nodded.
A door opened and closed, clicking with a lock as Thor made his way in. "Awwww midgard children are grumpy." In a single move, the thunder god strode over, scooped up Pietro, and set him on his lap on the couch. "If I stand correct, the Captain informs me those are bad words for little boys. Can you refrain from such vulgarity? I'll get thee a toy."
Pietro shook his head, non-verbally telling the man no and shyly burying his face in his hands, his cheeks flushing red with embarrassment.
Pietro obeyed and suddenly a black and white striped shirt was placed over him. Before he knew it, he was dressed and picked back up. Steve carried him back to the living room and sat on the floor. Pietro glared at the two of them. "I can just take this off and leave!"
Pietro shot up and sped toward the door but Steve had been expecting this. As soon as he noticed the younger one's eyes dart away, he held the door shut and wrapped an arm around Pietro's waist when he froze in place. "This is happening whether you like it or not! Please, cooperate with me here." Steve's voice with strict but held a tone of concern for the boy.
All of the men seemed to shake their heads. Each of them had their hands full with their own littles. It wasn't uncommon for caregivers to take on a couple of littles, but none of them could take on the speedster at the moment.
The blonde man nodded in response. "I know. Trust me, I know. How do you think we can figure it out?"
But it didn't get better. He felt Steve place something under his backside and the sides of the dreaded thing come around his waist while Steve fastened it.
Pietro put his name up at the top of the test and began reading through the questions. Some of them had obvious personal answers, but some honestly stumped him. There were a handful of questions he felt he could fit into a number of the answer options. He took his time making sure he answered as accurately as possible before picking the papers up and handing them to the Classification Specialist.
He gave Pietro a smile but the silver haired little felt as his whole world was falling apart. He had been going off on his own as long as he could remember! By law, littles would need their caregivers present. He would have to rely on someone and that didn't sit well with him. He had major issues with trust. He felt himself panicking and suddenly was struggling to breathe. Steve had been standing by the door and rushed over when he saw the panic attack setting in. He quickly sat next to the boy and placed an arm around him, rubbing his back. "Hey, you're going to be ok. You hear me? Everything is going to be ok 'Tro. Breathe. We won't let anything happen to you."
Pietro huffed and crossed his arms, placing them over his eyes. His cheeks flushed scarlet red when he felt his pajama pants slide down and Steve lifted him up slightly to pull down the underwear.
He had finally moved back to the States and was currently residing in the tower, despite not being too comfortable with the idea of living under Stark's roof. After turning his alarm off, he was ready to go back to sleep but there was a knock at the door.
Thor nodded and rubbed Pietro's back, taking the dark blue paci Steve handed to him. He quickly stuck it in Pietro's mouth before he could protest. At first the silver-haired mutant widened his eyes, but almost instantly calmed down and started sucking on his paci.
Steve once again rolled his eyes, sitting on the couch. We've locked all exits and unless you want to run around naked, you are going to have to stay in those clothes."
Thor ruffled his hair with a smile, "You got it buddy." He sat Pietro gently into the high chair with the cloud theme. "Does thou hunger? I might be able to whip up some special concoction just for thee."
There was a bit of a hesitation on Pietro's end. He knew what he wanted but was embarrassed to say. "....cwoud."
Pietro gave Steve a confused look. His eyebrows furrowed as he tried to make sense of what the Captain was saying. "I do not get this."
Pietro nodded, too ashamed to say a word as his cheeks flushed red. He watched Steve open the door before following him down the hall as a boringly slow pace and sitting in the living from before a man holding a file in his hands while Steve left them alone.
"And do you believe Asgard will be accepting of an outsider?" Steve asked in a concerned tone. Pietro wasn't from Asgard, as far as he knew, it wasn't his home. But in Thor's eyes, Pietro already had a home there.
"Easy there, tiger. It'll be a lot easier for everyone if you quit fighting." He readjusted Pietro onto his hip, his arm supporting him under his bottom and wrapped around Pietro's waist, leaning the speedster against his side. He walked through the hall, relieved when Pietro finally gave in and relaxed against his hold. Steve fought the urge to commend him on it, figuring the silverette wouldn't want to draw any attention to himself yet. He walked into a room with Pietro on his hip and the speedster went wide eyed when he saw the room was filled with Avengers and all eyes were on him. Apparently everyone had been aware of his forced classification test and were awaiting the results. Pietro's cheeks flushed red and he quickly turned and buried his face against Steve's shoulder. Steve couldn't helped but smile softly at the adorable action.
Pietro's cheeks flushed red once more and Steve grinned. "I think we found it." He turned to his husband, "Tony, can you get all the supplies we will need? Lots of blue and silver themed."
Once Pietro was out of the room, Steve addressed the rest of the room. "I would love to take him in, but Tony and I have our hands full with Buck and Peter. Bruce? Wade? Scott?"
"Truthfully, I'm not sure what Sokovian laws are like. Each country runs these things a bit differently. And with the war, I don't believe you ever had the time for Sokovian officials explain the process to you. Pietro, I am talking about the zarafica."
Steve didn't know why he did it. He didn't know Pietro's classification. But Steve was so used to being with littles, that a quick swat to the backside was usually his go to final warning. So now he was faced with the decision to apologize or act authoritatively. This was Pietro, he couldn't show any signs of backing down.
Pietro tensed up but quickly melted into the touch, essentially leaping and hugging Steve tightly and speaking in Sokovian in a hurried, panicked voice. Whatever he was thinking, he was having trouble handling it on his own.
Pietro clenched his jaw and looked away, giving the older man all the answers he needed to know. "So you do know about it. How is it administered where you come from?"
Steve let out a sigh, "He's still needs a bit more time to get comfortable. We are going to have to find him a caregiver in the mean time. Tony, can you show Pietro to his new room? Find one closer to other caregivers please. It will only temporary until we figure out his new home." Steve set Pietro down and watched Tony grabbed the little's hand and drag him out of the room.
Steve shook his head at that and stepped forward. "What Tony means, is that we are here to help you get more comfortable. Your classification may be new, but you've been a little. Pietro, the signs are all there. You have poor impulse control, get cranky often, and well...you did respond to the little swat earlier. We want to talk. Think you can bear with us?"
After a thankful look from Steve, Tony spoke softly "That being said, we need to find out how old the brat is."
Pietro thought for a moment but eventually looked back up and nodded, the tiniest smile tugging on the corner of his lips.
Pietro was starting to wake up and he sat up in the bed and rubbed his eyes. "What are you doing here?"
Steve held a tight grip on him, not letting him go even for a second. "Yes. She. Has. She was classified here as soon as she turned eighteen! Pietro Maximoff, quit squirming! You are going to take that test. Do NOT test my patience young man, you will find yourself in a world of trouble."
Tony scoffed, "Well, good morning to you too Sleeping Beauty. We're here because we need to have a chat. There is no use denying you're little. All it will do is more damage to your mental health, more mental breakdowns, and drawing more attention to yourself. So, you'll need to get over it."
The line went dead and Tony put his head in his hands. It had been a whole week since that stupid fight with Steve, and he’d been miserable ever since.
Clint finally slid into the real seat and reached down for the popcorn bowl. “Well call him or something! It’s my turn to pick and I want a double feature!”
The team had been sitting in amicable silence on their way back to the tower. Natasha was cleaning her equipment and stowing them away in their proper places. Tony was flying the quinjet. Okay well maybe Jarvis was doing the majority of the flying, but Tony was making sure nothing went south. Steve was writing up the details from the incident to send back to Shield with Coulson. The Hulk hadn’t made an appearance, so Bruce was reading some science article, in a chipper mood. And Clint and Thor were in a yelling match about what to have for dinner.
“Every time you force me to watch Die Hard, I’m gonna add an extra 24-hour delay on your arrow production,” Tony said as he sat in his spot, not as stretched out as usual but also not uncomfortably stiff. He turned to Steve and gave him a small smile. “Hi.”
Clint accepted it and was pulled to his feet. “Fuck you, we’re watching Die Hard just because you said that.” They were both laughing as they started down the ladder. Clint went first so he could make sure ‘Mr. My Shoes Cost More Than The Empire State Building’ didn’t slip.
Tony gave it a moment, and threw the file back on the table. He stood, turning to leave but not all the way, if only for the theatrics of it all. “Unfortunately I cannot relinquish him to you.” A deliberate pause. “
Steve nearly reeled from that. “You guys were upset too?” He asked in disbelief, giving a glance to the four of them.
that it’s after hours on a Thursday, those incompetent assholes at Shield shouldn’t have been left in charge of this.” He must’ve been on a call, since he tapped his ear to shut off a communicator. “Always left to fix other people’s mistakes.” He was shoving a stack of miscellaneous tools and papers to the side of his desk, clearing a space for the new files. “I do
Tony stopped his tirade as he finally looked up to greet his visitor. He apparently wasn’t expecting it to be Steve. His manic demeanor vanished.
did you manage to get a black eye?” He was studying his screen displaying Tony’s face, looking for any clues on how it had happened.
Steve somehow managed to move closer. He was heated from anger and you could feel the restraint flowing off him. “You better stop while you’re ahead.”
Steve tried to answer but Tony cut him off. “And do you even care that what you’re saying may be affecting us? Have you ever considered how we feel hearing you always talk about not wanting to be here? Fuck, I won’t even speak for everyone else but
Tony was elbow deep in the Mark IX (Mark VIII had been destroyed in a Hydra stakeout a couple months ago) when his phone started to ring. He sighed and started to wriggle out. “Who is it, J?” he asked.
Steve fell to his knees next to the mangled heap of armor. His hands hovered mere centimeters above the scraps. Bits and pieces had either been torn or blown away. Blood pooled out of a missing section in the abdomen.
he thinks as his car flips in the air, the front end completely sheared off from the electrical whip. He manages to un-lodge himself from the car and barely escape attack after attack when he begins to wonder how he’ll get out of this without revealing his secret. Happy has the suitcase armor and god only knows if he’s on his way. Even if he shows up with the armor, Tony would have to put it on in front of millions of people. Not the best way to keep a secret. He
Tony looked away, hiding his eyes. He nodded and slipped his hand out of Steve’s grasp. Quietly, he said, “I’m sorry for saying that stuff about Peggy and the Commandos. And Bucky.”
Thor didn’t need to add anything. Instead he just offered up the bowl of popcorn. A high honor in that tower.
Tony was exhausted to say the least. He’d only just dealt with Stane a few days ago and it’s been nonstop debriefings and company meetings and putting out fire after fire since then.
Tony tried to swat him away and gave a little chuckle. “Oh yeah. I forgot why I’d gone up there in the first place. So I was leaving the gala- would you relax, its just a scratch- I’m leaving the gala, and these two guys come up to me telling me to give them my wallet.” He swatted Clint’s hands away, earning an incredulous look. “Anyways! I’m like “who the fuck mugs Tony Stark?” because c’mon, you could come up to me on the street and ask me
And maybe the genius played a role in this, but goodness was he attractive. Steve couldn’t keep his hands off Tony whether he was in a ratty pair of jeans or a million-dollar suit. And he had to have been the most well-toned and eccentric billionaire on the planet. He could make Steve laugh until tears rolled down his face and his side was in stiches. What was better than a handsome, smart as a whip, funny guy?
want to belong. Tony took a small step towards Steve and tried to relax himself. “Listen Steve, we’re all here for you and just want to help you adjust. You can ask us for anything. You belong here with us.”
Service ladder, now that was probably the smart way to get to the top of a bridge. Certainly not the route Clint had chosen.
The next couple of days at Avengers Tower were tense at best, hostile at worst. Thankfully, through Tony and Steve’s crafty avoidance of one another, the worst was never reached.
He was nervous. Ideally not visibly so but that was the least of his worries right now. What would all this mean for the company? For his employees? His freedom?
Nobody made a move for a few seconds, and then the tensions bled out of the room. Clint spoke up first, “Shit, I thought something was gonna go down.” He picked up a piece of cheese, took a bite and waved the rest of the slice in Steve’s direction. “You’re lucky Tony showed up. I don’t think Thor coulda’ held him back much longer.”
He knew they’d come out of this whole mess with their heads held high, because he’d made sure to surround himself with strong people. But the time in between, the time before everything settled,
Dust and ash clouded the landscape. It was like living in a black and white movie. Everything was muted and dull, shades of gray blending into one another, hardly a single defined shape to be found.
“There is no damage to the spinal cord, and no risk of paralysis. You may… you could remove the suit, if you’d like.”
When Steve made no move to get his phone out, Natasha sat up and gave him a glare. “You two still haven’t made up? I thought you were going to apologize.”
It hadn’t even been 7 in the morning when the Avengers alarm blared throughout the tower. Apparently, some pissed off grad student thought his rejected capstone project needed to be tested in the city.
“Tony, I… I need to say something to you.” Tony stiffened in his seat, nearly pulling his hand away. Sirens were going off in his head until Steve interjected, “It’s nothing bad! I just… I need to apologize to you. And I need to do it right this time.
He didn’t mean to sound like a total sap, but it had been nice having these people around. It was nice feeling like he belonged for once. Every time Thor picked him up in a big bear hug, Clint popped out of a vent to scare the shit out of him, Bruce invited him down into his lab, or Natasha made him a warm cup of tea, well he just swelled with happiness.
And Steve had to admit, Tony really had been going the extra mile for him lately. He was trying to make him feel more adapted to the new century.
“That’s okay.” Steve watched for a few seconds to see if Tony would stop working, but it didn’t look like he’d be given that allowance. At this point, he’d take what he could get. “Tony, I just wanted to say that I’m sorry for what I said.”
Natasha sent a text to Happy and started towards the street. “We’re heading back.” Happy pulled up a moment later and she flicked her thumb towards the car. “Let’s go.”
Steve’s hand twitched to reach for his phone, even though he already knew there were no messages from Tony. They still weren’t on speaking terms.
Steve had also been trying to avoid the team as much as possible. After getting the cold shoulder from Clint, a harsh glare from Natasha, a disappointed glance from Thor, and a frustrated sigh from Bruce, he took a moment to really actually consider the recent fight.
“You son of a bitch! Who the fuck do you think you are!?” Rhodey waved the picture aimlessly, haphazardly trying to get out of Thor’s grip. “Well!? You’re not even going to try to deny it!”
Then Monaco happens, and it was times like that that made Tony wish he’d just come clean after the ordeal with Stane.
Clint was laughing with him, some of the worry easing its way out. The night air had just started to cool off, so it really was a pleasant evening for taking in the scenery. Even if it was at the top of a hundred-year-old bridge.
lied to you, Rhodey-bear?” He batted his eye lashes dramatically, hoping to end the interrogation quickly.
Bruce, shyly, spoke up. “If it’s all the same to you, I think I’ll walk back.” He didn’t need to tell them he needed the time to cool off, that he needed to not be in the small space of that car. They already understood. The green flecks in his eyes spoke volumes.
They’d all taken quick showers and dressed in the least remarkable clothing they owned. For Bruce, that was easy. A casual button down and some khakis did the trick. Steve and Thor had to wear something slightly looser to hide their bulk. Nothing screamed “Superhero” like bulging muscles. Thor loved hoodies with big pockets in the front and Steve made do with a light fitting jacket. Natasha sported a similar jacket to Steve’s. As she passed by Clint’s room, without even looking in she gave a sharp “no.” He always tried to wear skin-tight leather pants when they went out and somebody always had to stop him. He gave a whine and went to change into regular jeans and t-shirt. As for Tony, unfortunately the press had gotten wind of every single one of his looks. From his sharp tuxedos saved only for galas, right down to his little lacey undies he was wearing in a leaked home sex video taken in his pre-Iron Man years. He had to throw on a ball cap and some completely unfashionable sunglasses along with his non-ripped jeans and a plain t-shirt.
Steve swallowed the lump in his throat and offered his own smile in return. “Hi,” he responded, hardly above a whisper.
He slowly cracked his eyes open, blinking away the dryness that had built up. Once he was able to see clearly, he realized it was Steve holding onto his hand for dear life.
Clint turned away from the glass to see Natasha, Thor, and Bruce heading towards the room. Natasha tilted her head towards the glass in reference to her question.
Tony kept his eyes shut, listening to the droning beep coming from the monitor next to his bed. He knew this wasn’t hell, but he almost wished it was. The morphine drip wasn’t quite strong enough to completely take away his pain, but it was dulled enough that he could stand to be awake.
Thor, easily entertained by even the simplest foods, wanted an obscene number of pizzas ordered to the tower. Clint, with a remarkably unpredictable pallet, was craving something more refined. No one else could have cared less about
The events from… yesterday? Two days ago? What day even was it? Whatever. The events from that fight came flooding back to him. The grotesque mutant animals, the weird alien tech, the damn ‘energy source’, which had been closer to a bomb in design than anything to do with a power station. It had all been a cluster.
for money and I’d give it to you. Anyways I didn’t even have a wallet on me, so I told ‘em to fuck off and well they just didn’t like that.”
The next few seconds happened so fast, no one could honestly say what had happened. Only that when it was over, Tony had ended up on his back, slightly propped up with one elbow and the other hand covering his left eye. A look of disbelief spread across his features.
Time goes on, the toxicity in Tony’s blood continues to rise, and he makes more less than perfect choices.
Tony pulled the cap off his head and brushed a hand over his lower face. “Your attitude is all over some fucking trash? Jesus Cap, you could’ve just asked us for help!”
Tony glanced down at him. “What, you enjoying the view too much?” And he stuck his ass out a little for emphasis.
This was a defining moment. The next few seconds would dictate the rest of his life. From how he acted in public to how he treated his personal relationships. Every little thing he’d do from here on out would be scrutinized down to the tiniest little detail. And boy wasn’t that just a lot riding on one little sentence.
Bruce seemed to wake up a little and grabbed Steve’s arm. “You have a bite mark. We all do, actually. The med team is going to need to make sure we didn’t get anything from those animals, first.” He paused to smile up at Steve. “You’ll be the first to see him once he’s able, don’t worry.”
Nick Fury gave a single bob of his head. “Correct. We’d like Iron Man to join us with full disclosure of his identity. He'll be relieved from his duties at Stark Industries." He raised his chin and gave Tony a pointed look. "We have something big planned and we’ll need all the help we can get.”
Steve carefully brushed the hair out of Tony’s face. He could see his labored breaths, so at least he was still alive, for the moment.
“Peggy was by your side 100% of the time, right? She never had anything else to do except take care of you.
Rhodey’s phone started to ring and he stepped out to take the call. Probably some military official wanting to know more about the incident at Stark Industries.
Tony heard the shout from the kitchen and had half a moment to consider just turning around and going back to his lab.
Natasha gently tiled Steve’s head down so they made eye contact. “Hey, it’s going to be okay.” He nodded and tried to watch as they loaded Tony into the med vehicle. He wondered why Coulson got to go with him.
, it’s a fundraising event for MIT.” He glanced at his watch. “But, you’re right. It should be over by now.”
Tony, the ever-diligent boyfriend (yes, he could be diligent when he put some thought into it) had been working overtime to try and keep Steve’s bad thoughts at bay. He’d been doing well in this century so far, and had even seemed content for quite a while. The “team bonding” events Coulson had lined up actually worked most of the time, and after settling their differences, Steve and Tony had started their relationship. Tony was certainly happy, and he finally felt like he had a family.
Where to start? The man was a genius, and that was putting it lightly. Tony was so far ahead of all his competition. And every single thing he made left Steve breathless. Maybe he couldn’t understand what it all did, but it was all just so fascinating and mesmerizing. The man made things that Steve wouldn’t have even thought remotely possible, and he did it with such ease. Well, mostly with ease. Accidents did have a tendency to happen in the workshop.
The team was able to get their own individual meals and meet at a table hidden behind some trees. None of the other patrons seemed to notice them. Either that or they just didn’t care.
Steve, being on the receiving end of the tirade, looked absolutely miserable. His eyes were downcast and his mouth was set in a tense line. He looked like he wished Thor would just walk away so Rhodey could land a couple of good hits.
And Clint understood. Sometimes they had to remember that they fought for the people who couldn’t always fight for themselves. And even though their own lives and problems were important, they were part of something bigger. Something that required strength and courage that wasn’t always easy to muster up. They all felt that need for a reminder from time to time.
The tension bled out of Tony all at once, and Clint could feel him sag in relief. “Okay.” Quickly enough that it made Clint’s heart jump in his throat, Tony stood. “Let’s get outta here. Thor better not have eaten all the popcorn already. And I don’t care that its your turn to pick, I’m not watching Die Hard again.” He reached a hand down.
Both Tony and Steve took a step closer to each other. Neither one was the type to back down from a challenge.
But he hadn’t been present the last two weeks, and there was a visible hole in the group where he was missing.
‘Oh, that reminds me, Anthony.’ Tony’s Mom looks up from her magazine, across the breakfast table. She looks very beautiful this morning, with a peacock blue dress and her hair in an elegant twist. ‘I had a call last night, from the mother of one of your friends. Maggie, I think she said. Something about a birthday party with some of the other children?’
‘Such a good baby girl,’ she encourages. ‘That’s right, move for me.’ She runs the tips of her fingers down the crack of Tony’s bottom and holds them there, moving gently, and Tony makes a little choky noise because she can’t help it.
‘What,’ Tony says, a tiny husk of a sound. She feels like everything’s turned upside down, tilting weirdly, warping at the edges. ‘What?’
He mumbles half-heartedly in protest; Steve hums in his throat, a soothing sound, and pats Tony’s shoulder as he stands up, moving about the little hollow to fetch something from a dim corner. Tony watches him as he comes back to the fire with another birch container, pinching something out of it and sprinkling it into the larger one hung over the fire.
At the same time, with her other hand Steve reaches between them and catches Tony’s nipple between thumb and forefinger, giving it a gentle rolling pinch. It startles a sharp shocked little whimper out of Tony, and Steve laughs a little. ‘Nice, isn’t it?’ she murmurs, and pinches again, her other hand stroking along Tony’s folds for an instant.
'It's – it's fine,' she says, and her own voice surprises her, sounding soft and sleep-soaked and uncertain and
Then he seems to have an idea, his face lighting up, and he stretches out his hand towards Tony. Tony’s not sure what it means, but then Steve points to an area on his palm. Tony shifts a little bit, to see.
Steve smiles at him when he’s done, putting the mortar down. ‘Good,’ he says, but then frowns when Tony reaches inquisitive fingers up to probe at his handiwork. He reaches out and takes Tony’s hands in his own, moving them away from his chest and positioning them firmly by his sides. ‘Don’t touch,’ he says sternly, and Tony doesn’t know the words, but he certainly knows the tone.
. She lowers her eyes and gently cleans away the last traces of dried blood from the edges of Steve’s broken knuckles. Steve’s hand has gone still in her hair, and she wishes Steve would start petting her again.
The Stranger puts down his tool. And then, very, very slowly, he holds out his huge hand towards Tony, palm outwards and upwards. Tony watches him warily, baring his teeth a little, not yet a snarl but a warning. But the Stranger simply holds his hand there, waiting, waiting; and his knife is lying on the ground between them, and there is no threat in the lines of his body.
‘Don’t be sorry,’ she says gently. ‘You can ask me any sort of questions you like, and I’ll answer them if I can. I didn’t know that Steve liked flowers, but that’s nice. And Darcy does like flowers, especially big bunchy roses, and she picks them for both Alex and me, and we put them in a vase in the kitchen.’
‘Wait, what, no,’ she whispers urgently, and then, ‘is she… is she really, Rhodey? Look again, can you look again?’
‘I – I like flowers,’ Tony says shyly, and then ducks his head. ‘I picked Mum roses once,’ he mumbles. But he’d got in trouble for that, the roses were special garden ones and not for picking. They’d been so pretty, though, pink and yellow and smelling wonderful, and he’d scratched his hands trying to make a bunch of them.
person who would know what to say, how to comfort. But she’s not, she’s just Tony, but she has to say something. ‘Yeah,’ she mumbles, ‘yeah, I have – I have them too. Dreams. Bad ones. I – I think I’m back in Afghanistan, and – and there’s water, and they – they do things and I can’t stop it, can’t stop any of it, and I know it’s all my fault,’ and she snaps her mouth closed because what the hell is she thinking, Steve’s just had her own nightmare, the last thing that she wants is to hear Tony’s.
He touches Steve’s chest like that for some time, and after a while Steve begins to smooth his big hands up and down Tony’s back, then round to his stomach, his chest, thumbing his nipples a little. That feels so good that Tony arches his back and whimpers, and Steve’s face is flushed pink and his eyes are big and blue and he’s looking at Tony as though he can’t quite believe it.
Everyone gets distracted with bickering over Indian or Chinese, and Steve's in the middle of it, all laughing and warm and goofy and holding the Chinese menu out of Clint's reach while Bucky jostles her for it, and Tony knows she's staring at Steve with a dopey lovestruck look on her face but she can't seem to stop. Steve's wearing a completely ordinary blue t-shirt, but it clings and swoops breathtakingly over the perfect curve of her breast and makes something go hot and shivery deep down low in Tony's stomach. Tony takes a deep breath to pull herself together.
Clint flicks another piece of popcorn at her. Tony jumps, slightly guilty. ‘Stop being gross, Stark,’ he whines. ‘Quit thinking about sexytimes with Cap and start thinking about
And Tony goes into her room and flops on her bed in a happy disbelieving daze, and when, much later, she falls asleep, it’s to the remembered slide of Steve’s fingers in her hair, and Steve’s kiss on her temple.
her – and Tony has a vague sense that she should protest, but then she drifts off again, and next thing is that Steve's got her in bed, wrapped up in something warm and soft – Steve's weight is making the mattress dip as she sits on the side – gentle fingers are stroking Tony's hair.
‘TonyStark,’ Tony mumbles. It comes out too soft, his dad would frown at him and tell him to open his mouth and speak clearly. But Steve’s mom just crinkles her eyes. ‘Nice to meet you, Tony,’ she says. She doesn’t say it in a baby voice, either, Tony hates it when people do that.
Darcy’s Mamá’s eyes are like twinkly laughing stars. ‘Pleased to meet you, Tony and Steve,’ she says, smiling down at them. ‘I’m Maggie. Darcy’s told me all about you, Tony.’
‘Don’t EVER touch my stuff AGAIN,’ Steve says aggressively in Tony’s face, and Tony can’t help it, he lets out a little stupid sniff and dashes his hand angrily at his damp eyes. Stupid,
Steve makes a quiet little sound and rubs a nice slow warm circle into Tony’s back with his big hand. Tony melts into the skins.
When Tony lets go, Rhodey’s looking at Steve, head tilted. ‘Only going to say this once, Rogers,’ he says easily. ‘You know the drill. You hurt her: Me. Bodybag. Shovel. Unmarked grave.’
,’ Steve says, firm. She shifts a little, lifts herself up so she’s hovering over Tony. ‘Look at me – please, sweetheart,’ and her tone is so tender and entreating that Tony does, her breathing going shaky.
She winds her fingers shyly around Steve’s, looking up at Steve’s face. ‘Just good feelings?’ she whispers.
Clint’s Daddy is here too, and Tony finds out that he’s called Phil and he has a kind, quiet voice like faraway traffic on a road. Then, halfway through eating, Sarah arrives wearing the prettiest blue dress like a floaty butterfly, and a carrying a big hamper which Steve runs to help her with. ‘Sorry I’m late, everyone,’ she says, smiling, ‘I had to finish my shift at the hospital.’
After a bit, Tony realises there’s one thing that he can do to get Justin Hammer to leave him alone. He’s never really tried before, but one day he opens his mouth and taunts back at Justin, and realises to his delight that he can say mean enough things that Justin goes quiet and turns back around in his seat and gets on with his work. It’s an important discovery. Tony’s not very good at fighting with his fists, but now he has something he can hit back with, his tongue.
Steve’s voice is quiet, but with that Captain America-ness in it, sort of commanding and reassuring at the same time; and Tony finds that she can breathe a little bit easier when Steve’s standing there telling her to do it. Tony can just about – she can find her words now, fumbling for them, and she says, ‘M’fine, okay, it’s
robot, not just a baby picture. Steve and his mom are already through the door, and no-one’s pushing him, so Tony reaches out to touch the robot picture. It’s so cool. One day he’s going to draw pictures of robots like that, really neat ones, and then actually make them for real, so they can help him clean his room and stuff.
on Steve, and in a minute she’ll remember all the reasons why that is a Very Bad Thing, but for now everything’s fuzzy and soft-focused and she can’t think about it straight.
He brings his hands up shyly, and places them on Steve’s chest. It’s very warm and smooth, and it feels so strong under his hands that it makes him shiver, but in a good way that Tony doesn’t quite understand. Steve is breathing faster, and he’s looking at Tony in that soft wondering way he has sometimes. Tony looks up at him through his lashes, questioning, and Steve smiles at him (so
Ms Potts is a good teacher. She doesn’t look anything like a teapot, but she’s good. She lets Tony read more interesting books than the others, because he knows more words than them. And she likes his robot pictures. She even stuck one up on the whiteboard, his best one, the red and yellow one that looks a bit like a suit of armour.
But Maggie just grins at him and pats his arm. 'Have another one then,' she offers, and so Tony does.
as pretty as Steve’s face. It’s prettier than the dying sun, prettier than the fire-sparks, prettier than a new flower.
Steve touches his face again, his fingers gentle. He doesn’t seem to know how to explain the word, but that’s all right. Tony’s sleepy anyway. He snuggles his face into Steve’s shoulder with a sigh, letting his eyelids droop closed, and Steve pets his hair and strokes his back and murmurs to him softly, and it’s good, everything is good.
‘Was that a yes?’ Steve prompts quietly. ‘Can you use your words for me, like we talked about?’ She cups Tony’s face with a gentle hand. ‘I know talking’s hard for you today, sweetheart, but I need you to use your words for a new toy, just to be safe.’
, Steve down in her workshop where Steve definitely shouldn’t be, why has JARVIS let her in, and, shit, this is the most embarrassing moment of Tony’s life, this is like seriously,
Steve catches her with an arm round her waist, drawing her in to rest with her back against Steve’s chest. ‘Understood,’ she says to Rhodey, and oh, that makes Tony shiver suddenly, because Steve, Steve sounds so warm and
Steve does the border. He draws long ropes up the sides and then adds other things like long curly snails in shells, and seahorses, and tanks, and some flowers. He points at Tony’s face when he sees him looking at the flowers. ‘Flowers AREN’T GIRLY,’ he says sternly, daring Tony to disagree, ‘they’re AWESOME.’
Tony comes awake feeling safe and comfortable, warm arms circled around him. He blinks his eyes open and looks directly into someone else’s blue ones.
. Tony draws Darcy in the middle, very carefully, with pigtails and a red dress because red's the best colour. He draws everyone else around her, Steve with bright blue eyes and Tasha’s red hair and Clint with a bow and arrow just like Robin Hood and pretty Jane and Tony himself with a black curly scribble of hair. Thor is behind the others, nice and tall and big.
Tony doesn’t know quite what to do. She’s blushing, hot, all over her face and down her neck, beneath Steve’s hand, trying to grasp for something, anything to say in response to Steve’s astonishing speech – but. It’s just – God. What is she supposed to – to
. He wants to stay lying here with Steve, so he puts his hands on Steve’s massive chest and clings, nestling closer with a little sound.
And Tony’s mouth falls open, and she can’t stop staring, staring, staring up into Steve’s face in disbelief.
, you shovel-talked Steve! Oh my God, so embarrassing, why do I keep you around, why are my friends like this, oh my God,’ and Rhodey rolls his eyes and places his hand lightly over her mouth.
(Steve doesn’t hate Pepper Potts quite so much any more. Tony seems to have forgotten about Pepper, and Tony is Steve’s
’ Tony says, incredulous. He can’t imagine his Dad and Mum doing anything like that, or any grown-up. ‘But – but what
'Okay,' Steve says softly, and the words hum against Tony's lips. And then, then Steve's pulling back a little, her hands stripping quickly at the suit, unbuckling and yanking, and finally it's tossed to the floor and – and
Steve’s expression goes soft and melting around the edges, smiling a bit except that it looks sort of sad as well. ‘Only good feelings,’ she promises. ‘Only ever good feelings, darling girl.’ She smooths Tony’s ruffled hair back from her forehead, and Tony loves her so, so much, she
Steve's crying calms, after a bit. Tony goes on holding her until Steve moves, straightening up a little. But then Steve's arms come around Tony, and she’s holding on, now, warm hands clutching at Tony’s back, her forehead coming to rest on Tony’s shoulder. Tony turns her head against Steve’s, listening to Steve’s heavy uneven painful breaths, and it
‘Easy, darling,’ Steve says, laughing a little. She moves her hand upwards, stopping Tony from getting friction where she wants it, and Tony’s making shuddery sounds, pants that sound almost like sobs. One of her hands slips down almost involuntarily from around Steve’s neck, trying to reach between her legs and touch herself, but Steve gently catches her wrist. ‘No, Tony,’ she reproves. ‘Be a good girl for me. No touching, remember?’
‘Friends,’ Tony whispers. There’s a lovely warm, warm feeling spreading out from the middle of his chest, and he looks up and grins shyly at Darcy. She beams back, giving his pinky a friendly little wriggle and pushing her glasses back up her nose.
and Tony wants to jump and shout and dance around with excitement and hug someone. He wraps his arms around himself instead, with a little delighted shiver of happiness, and goes over to the shelf where Old-Bear sits and watches.
Steve’s pinky hooks tightly onto Tony’s and holds on, and then Steve breathes out a long breath and lifts his head and looks sideways at Tony, very quickly, and then away, and then back again. Tony still can’t stop smiling, wiping away the last little traces of tears; and then Steve smiles back, a little tweak at the corner of his mouth. His arm is still around Tony’s back, very careful and light, but warm.
‘S-Steve,’ Tony says helplessly, ‘Steve – Steve!’ Her hands are clutching at Steve’s shirt, shaking with want, but still obedient, not trying to touch; Steve’s proud of her.
as Bucky grabs him round the neck and noogies him. He emerges from the following struggle so bright-eyed and glowing that Tony eyes him suspiciously, eyes sliding to Bucky's wide grin and the sparkle in his grey eyes. Huh.
Before Steve goes back home, Mr Karolidis rests his hand lightly on his back. ‘Come talk with me,’ he says quietly. ‘If you need. I’m here, you remember that. Okay?’
It seems a long time they sit there, silent, soaking in each other’s warmth. After a while, Tony hooks up the blanket she’d dragged along with her, pulling it awkwardly around Steve’s shoulders; and Steve somehow shifts and gets the blanket around both of them so they’re in a warm sort of cocoon. Tony exhales, like a sigh, feeling Steve’s strong heartbeat where she’s slumped low against Tony’s body.
. It makes Tony feel suddenly, dreadfully, like crying. God, Steve’s face is in her hair, nestling there and breathing in –
Steve’s grinning as Natasha scowls at her, moving out of reach and dropping down onto the sofa seat next to Tony with the prize. ‘My lady,’ she says, all laughing eyes and chivalry, offering the box to Tony with a flourish. And Tony can’t stop smiling even though it’s just silly, really, and Bucky and Clint are groaning quietly and rolling their eyes at each other on the other sofa, muttering ‘Aaand again,’ and ‘
Tony rolls the little egg in Steve’s palm. It’s very cold, but – but that would probably feel really good, that cool hardness down between her legs where it’s warm and wet. She doesn’t like things that are big, down there, but the egg is quite small, and she trusts Steve. And Steve is always gentle, so gentle, and it won’t hurt even a little bit. Just good feelings.
with her, God she just, she just hates herself sometimes – ‘M’c-crying all over – over y-you, I should – go, just, let me,’ she snuffles, but her hands and body don’t want to let go of Steve, and Steve just holds her tighter and it feels like the only thing that’s stopping her from breaking up into tiny pieces.
Tony bites his lip and looks down at his feet. He doesn’t know what to say and his words are gone, even though Darcy’s Mamá – Maggie – is nice and friendly-looking and has a kind voice. He shrinks into Steve’s side, and then he feels Steve’s rough little hand grasping his own and squeezing reassuringly. It makes him feel a little bit better.
, Steve is kind and his face is nice and he has a gentle voice that makes Tony feel safe. So Tony slowly lies back, letting his body go soft again, glancing shyly at Steve in invitation.
When the broth is gone, Steve feeds him the meat, holding it in his fingers for Tony to eat. It’s soft and juicy and flavoured with herbs, and Tony wolfs it down, his lips brushing Steve’s fingers in his haste.
Tony nods understandingly, because yeah, his Dad is like that too. He bumps his knee gently against Steve’s, so Steve knows it’s okay, and Steve untenses. ‘Let’s colour the struts,’ Tony suggests, tracing a star shape on Steve’s shoulder with a capped marker pen, and Steve grabs a big handful of popsticks.
But still. Steve. Tony reaches out and touches a petal with the tip of her finger; she can’t stop the big wondering grin that bursts over her face, but then, there’s only JARVIS to see.
, leans on Steve and smells her nice smell. Steve is great, Steve is really great, and hey, wouldn’t it be nice to just curl up into Steve and soak in it, soak in how warm and nice and soft and strong Steve is.
Tony nods shakily. Steve leans forward and kisses the sweet warm flush of her cheek, lingering there for a moment as she cups Tony’s breasts. She takes a moment to enjoy the supple weight of them, and then catches Tony’s trembling lip again, giving her nipples a sudden tantalising tweak at the same instant. She loves doing this, touching Tony’s body as she kisses her and feeling each caress quivering back against her lips.
Tony’s lying curled into Steve’s side, her face buried in Steve's t-shirt. She's restless, a little twitchy, the way she gets sometimes when she needs this. Steve strokes her short curls.
Steve smiles and leans down to kiss her forehead. ‘Brave girl,’ she praises, and Tony smiles drowsily, reaching up to touch Steve’s breast, so soft and pale. It’s nice that Steve isn’t wearing any clothes.
‘Shh-shh,’ someone murmurs nearby, and Tony’s head jerks towards the sound, trying to see in the dusky firelight. ‘Shh-shhhh,’ and the voice is strange, deeper and more rumbling than the voices of Tony’s tribe, but quiet, gentle. And Tony needs to run, run far away – except that his head is so heavy, and he is so warm, and the fur is so soft.
Tony relaxes again. Maggie doesn’t try to make him say any more, but it’s nice just sitting there with her in the sunshine.
, that silky, heated skin, quivering beneath her fingers – so good that Steve nearly loses her head and sweeps Tony up and back to their bed to finish it. But she takes a deep breath, controls it, allows the arousal to settle into a hot wet throb between her thighs. This is for both of them, and Tony needs this, needs this gentle taking-apart and coming-undone as much as she needs the sex itself.
‘No you don’t,’ Tony corrects. He peeks back at Steve, ducking his face back into the safety of Darcy’s shoulder. ‘Do you really think…?’
She can’t think, she can’t think, and everything’s spinning except Steve, who’s solid and warm, soft and strong and holding her as though she’s – as though Tony’s
Steve holds Tony there like that for a long time, teasing, lovingly pressing her hands away to stop her touching; placing soft tender kisses on her face when it gets so intense that Tony can’t help making sounds. Tony pleads and pleads, but Steve just quietly hushes her. ‘I said no, darling girl. You know your colours,’ she murmurs, gentle and firm. ‘It’s okay. I got you, little bird.’
Steve’s face is soft, washed in the warm Christmassy light. She’s just standing there, at ease, looking around at everyone, her hair glinting golden. She’s so –
Three soft thuds on the floor later, and she actually cries out in relief as Steve’s skin is finally pressed against her, warm and soft and solid, and Steve’s thigh is between hers, rocking, and Steve’s hand is gently cupping the naked crease of Tony’s backside, her fingers working a little. Tony cries out again, and again, little sharp cries, involuntary; her hands are finally,
Except Tony is really not dumb, Tony is real great and kind and smart and knows how to make all kinds of stuff, and his hair is soft and curly, and Steve always likes the way Tony looks at him with big brown eyes, like Bambi in that baby movie, when he thinks Steve’s cool. Steve likes everything about Tony, really, that’s why they’re best friends.
‘Yeah,’ he shrugs, because he doesn’t want to look stupid, like – like as though he was trying too hard. But it doesn’t seem to really matter, because Tony looks so
gets a swing. Darcy’s grinning at him, making small chirping sounds of anticipation as they start off slowly, getting higher and higher and higher till Tony's almost sobbing with excitement, wind rushing past him and whipping wildly through his hair, his fists clenched tightly on the ropes. It feels – it feels so wonderful, like flying –
He needs to get a desk, he suddenly remembers, and looks round in a bit of panic, because what if there isn’t any room left for him? But then he sees Steve and his mom choosing a desk at the side of the room, and there’s a spare one pushed up right next to it, and it suddenly feels like Tony
Natasha doesn’t look convinced, and Clint, who doesn’t talk much unless it’s to Tasha, says, ‘Why?’ in a curious sort of voice.
with her – her stupid Steve-face, and Tony’s losing it in front of her, and now Steve’s going to think she’s unstable and shouldn’t be on the team –
At Steve’s hip, she nudges her own t-shirt up invitingly, drawing Tony’s warm hand up beneath the fabric until she reaches Steve’s breast. ‘Go on, baby, you can touch,’ she encourages, shifting Tony’s other hand too; and Tony makes a pleased, aroused, cooing sound in the back of her throat which jolts straight to the slick throbbing spot between Steve’s thighs. Small eager fingers fumble reverently at her breasts, and Steve takes a deep unsteady breath as Tony circles and explores.
One evening Tony asks Steve again what the ‘pretty’ word means. He crawls over to where Steve’s sitting grinding herbs, and rubs his head against Steve’s shoulder. ‘Pretty,’ he says insistently. ‘Steve, what’s pretty?’
‘Look,’ Tony says proudly, holding the knife out towards Steve. ‘For you,’ he explains, touching Steve’s chest gently with his finger. He watches Steve’s face hopefully.
‘Y-yes?’ he says, a little bit choked, and drops his bag and offers his arms eagerly for his hug. Steve wraps his arms around him, tight and good and firm, with his pointy chin pressing into Tony’s neck. Tony rests his head on Steve’s shoulder and sighs blissfully, closing his eyes.
‘Such a good girl for me, aren’t you? You’re being so patient, Tony,’ she praises. ‘I’m so proud of you, sweet thing.’ Her hand is damp with Tony’s slick; she brings it up and licks one finger, enjoying the taste. Tony watches her with big wondering eyes, and Steve smiles a little, fondly. ‘You taste so sweet,’ she explains, and then gently smears a little at the corner of Tony’s mouth.
Then Steve tips Tony’s face with two gentle fingers on her jaw, and carefully thumbs away the little smudge of butter on her nose, and something goes all to mush in Tony’s chest. And she smiles stupidly up into Steve’s face and everyone’s watching and teasing and she doesn’t care because Steve’s just –
Steve carries him outside, and oh! The sky is big and wide and streaked with colours, eggshell blue and flower pink and violet purple, the sun just disappearing beyond the wooded line of the sky. The ground gradually drops away into a little valley below them, and everything is lit with soft dappling colours, and Tony doesn’t know why but it makes him
Chapter 2 will be coming, hopefully sooner rather than later - in which there will be more caring Steve and small Tony, and soft kisses. I promise soft kisses.
Drowsiness washes over him in the sudden way it’s had since he’s been sick; Steve is holding him so close and he feels so safe. Tony snuggles into him, making happy, sleepy sounds, and Steve nuzzles his hair. He
Tony glows. He nearly almost gives her a hug, too, but remembers just in time that hugs are for school, not home. Mom doesn’t really enjoy hugs very much, but that’s okay, he can give her kisses sometimes instead. He smiles happily up at Mom again, and then it’s time to say goodbye because the car has come to take him to school.
That night, Tony sits nestled between Steve’s thighs, Steve’s chest warm and massive at his back. Steve has cooked meat over the fire, roasted in the flames, and he’s feeding the softest pieces to Tony with his fingers. Tony snaps softly at his hand with little pretending growls, because it makes Steve chuckle.
embarrassing, and she ought to just put her head up and smile and say she’s fine, nothing to worry about, just resting. Except when she puts her head up and tries to grin like usual, it goes all wobbly, and she
Steve doesn’t do anything, but he looks pleased. Tony slips into his chair, and Steve bumps his shoulder gently with his own. ‘Cool,’ he says, and Tony sighs happily and grins back at him.
.’ She’s fumbling, her hand coming up to cling to Tony’s shoulder, twisting round to bring them chest to chest; and Tony can’t help it, she brushes her lips against the side of Steve’s face, wrapping her arms closer.
When he wakes next, watery dawn-light is streaking across the sky and filtering inside the cave-hollow. The fire is still burning slowly, and Tony is still warm and comfortable, still tucked in a pile of soft skins. The wound in his chest is just a dull ache, not the burning pain of before, and the pad of soiled moss is gone.
'Ngh,' Tony says, and flounders out of the covers, struggling into a position vaguely close to upright so that Steve can hand her the coffee. She touches her own knee; she's wearing jeans, still, she realises, Steve's jeans and shirt, but they're so soft and worn through that it's not uncomfortable.
Tony huddles quietly behind a tree to watch him, shivering a little and hugging his arms around himself. The wound at the centre of his chest throbs and burns, thin trails of yellowish discharge leaking out of the sodden moss-pack he’d bound there to stop the blood. He’s so – he’s so
A warm, chubby little arm slips around him and cuddles. ‘You can cry if you want,’ Darcy informs him, patting him softly. ‘I don’t mind. An' your hair is nice. Can I play with it?’
She glances at Steve – when did that become such a natural thing to do? – and Steve's looking at her with the corner of her mouth tipping up, jerking her head slightly in Bucky and Clint's direction. Then she winks, which makes Tony go all warm inside, and she can’t help smiling back at Steve, because God, Steve’s so beautiful like this, all warm and relaxed and soft.
It seems to take hours. Tony presses at his stomach with his hands to stave off the empty pangs, something his mother had taught him when he was a child. Food had often been short, deep in the cold winter, even for the Chieftain’s family.
, now what happens, she knew it, she always ruins everything, absolutely everything. ‘Sorry,’ she says quickly, miserably, ‘that was weird, don’t know why I said that, just ignore me.’
party, it’s going to be good, good, good and almost all of the people Tony likes are coming and none of the boring grumpy people she doesn’t like. Like Agent Coulson.
She folds Tony’s t-shirt neatly before going any further. Tony whimpers, feeling a little neglected, and Steve makes a low soothing sound in her throat, amused. ‘Shh, darling,’ she soothes, and lays the folded shirt on the counter. ‘I haven’t forgotten about you, bunny.’
And soon – soon Steve is looking back at him with his lips parted, panting a little, and he shifts a little against Tony. It’s like Tony’s body flares like a new flame, bright and shining and lovely, so that he bucks and lets out a sharp eager little cry, and then another –
, she needs more, and she pants into the smooth warm skin of Steve’s shoulder, sucking, then darts wildly down to Steve’s satiny nipple, kissing open-mouthed, warm and wet. Steve whimpers at that, high in her throat, her body going taut for an instant. And then – God,
Pepper’s herding everyone along towards the Christmas tree, exchanging little laughing looks with Natasha every now and then. Darcy comes and gives Tony a big hug and a pinch on her bottom, whispering something loud and incredibly inappropriate that makes Tony chortle, because
‘Landing pad!’ Tony says, pleased. ‘Do you… do you wanna see the plane that’s gonna land on it?’ He peeks at Clint uncertainly, but Clint’s nodding, his face solemn and intent.
Darcy shrugs. ‘Dunno,’ she says, unconcerned. ‘I s’pose they gave each other p’mission. They like each other lots,’ she adds. ‘They’re always
Steve’s hands always feel good, Tony thinks dreamily. He’s still very warm, but he feels safe and good and happy, and it would be nice if Steve could touch him more, all over his body. Maybe Steve would like to be touched too, that would be nice. Tony would like to stroke Steve’s chest – and his arms! He likes Steve’s arms very much, and it would be nice to run his hands over them.
Ms Potts looks at Steve narrowly. 'Do you think you can sit next to each other without fighting?' she asks. 'And does Tony want to move back?'
day, and Dad had been grinning and he’d shown Tony how to hold his arms so that he could catch the soft ball that they were playing with.
,’ she says, her voice cracking, and she tries to thrust up against Steve’s hand again, though the angle is wrong and Steve knows she won’t find any relief that way.
things that aren't there, because imagining things leads to hoping, and hoping takes you to places that hurt.
Steve’s mouth opens as though she wants to say something else, and then her eyes move over Tony’s face, searching, and she seems to change her mind, her smile turning oddly wry, rueful. Tony can’t quite make it out. ‘Steve?’ she’s just starting to say, uncertainly, and then Steve glances down and seems to realise she’s still holding the flowers. She laughs a bit, looking back up at Tony.
Steve chuckles. His eyes are smiling, and he leans even closer and rubs his nose softly against Tony’s. Tony’s eyes widen. This is new. What does this nose touch mean?
Steve’s looking down at her, so soft and blue and serious. ‘You’re not – whatever you were going to say,’ Steve says gently. ‘You’re good and sweet and kind and funny and
Steve smiles at him, reaching out to smooth a curl of hair away from Tony’s eyes. ‘Here,’ he says agreeably, and picks up the best piece, putting it in Tony’s hand. Tony brightens; Steve’s hand is still lingering in his hair and he turns his face a little, leaning into it, before Steve goes back to his work.
Then Darcy gets him to put his head in her lap so she can play with his hair, and Tony likes Darcy playing with his hair so he lies down and cuddles the beautiful bear and listens to the story; and slips his thumb into his mouth because no-one’s there to tell him not to do it.
Anyway, Darcy and Thor were making punch to bring, which would be way better, because they were Darcy and Thor and they were experts in punch-making. And there would be lots of it. Thor had been talking about a rain barrel.
Tony can feel the cool heaviness of the egg inside her now, and it does feel good; not the bright insistent excitement leading to climax, but a comforting weight, steady and grounding. ‘Nice,’ she tells Steve after a moment, and Steve looks glad.
Steve takes a deep breath. Tony watches tearily as he pulls his hands out of his pockets and sits down on the bench, on Tony’s other side. There’s a moment where nothing happens, and then Tony lets out a hitching breath of surprise, because Steve is patting his shoulder with awkward gentle little pats.
Maggie laughs. ‘Do you?’ she asks Tony, and her voice is so gentle and warm that it makes Tony inch forward a little and nod. And so Maggie reaches out her arms and gives him a quick warm hug, and Tony hugs back and somehow there’s a big sort of lump in his throat. Maggie’s hug is like – like when his mom hugs him, except that hardly ever happens any more now he’s big. It’s a
, she's bleeding, what if she's bled onto Steve's sheets, that's like a whole new level of humiliating dreadfulness, dear
And then everything happens in a frantic sort of flurry, Steve’s hauling her own shirt off one-handed while her other hand slides to Tony’s hips and under her waistband, insistent. ‘Clothes, off. Now,’ Steve commands, and oh, God
. Tony can’t take his eyes away from it. He curls up on the floor next to Darcy at story time and looks and looks and
Tony's out of bed before JARVIS has finished speaking, grabbing a blanket on impulse from the end of the bed and stumbling towards the door. JARVIS turns the passage lights on so she can see where she's going, but it seems impossibly far to Steve's rooms. God, what if Steve's... JARVIS said she'd hurt her head, but how badly? Is she concussed?
, not even Ms Potts or probably even the principal. Tony doesn’t think he’s actually friends with Steve or anything like that, they don’t talk much, but Steve’s always there and Tony would rather sit next to Steve than anyone else in the class.
, CRYING, tears rolling down his cheeks, and that’s unacceptable, Tony must be looked after so he doesn’t cry, and Steve’d been
‘Okay, okay,’ he says, ‘now! Cakes cook in the cups, and we make icing. What’s your boy’s favourite colour?’
‘Right away, Sir,’ JARVIS says soothingly, and then, after a moment, ‘Cerebral scan clear for Captain Rogers. Surface laceration at temple, stitching not estimated to be required. Deep tissue bruising and lacerations to right hand; Captain Rogers’ accelerated healing is in progress. Bruising to left shoulder and back, extensive but already healing. Sleepiness due to simple exhaustion.’
‘Yeah.’ Darcy nods firmly. Then she says, ‘Hey, if I draw you a giant metal fire gorilla, can you draw me a cool robot with Darcy written on it?’
Rhodey squeezes her arm and then gives her a little push. ‘Go on,’ he says softly. ‘Go talk to her. Say Merry Christmas. Go!’
something inside Tony so that her heart bounces back to its proper place and everything steadies itself again. She registers that, after all, it’s just a little bit of grease, and Steve doesn’t look surprised or put off, just a little bit awkward holding such a big bunch of flowers.
. Steve’s cheeks are very pink, and he doesn’t look at Tony, just keeps holding tightly as Darcy chats to everyone and sings songs from all her favourite movies.
‘Sst. Tony. Are you crying?’ It’s the Darcy girl. At least she’s talking quietly. Tony turns his face away, rubbing fiercely at his eyes, because he doesn’t care, he doesn’t!
‘My mummies poke each other’s bottoms sometimes,’ Darcy chips in suddenly. Everyone turns to stare at her.
‘I, I maybe didn’t know that. I,’ Tony says vaguely. She’s peeking over Rhodey’s shoulder to look at Steve, standing on her own at the side of the room.
When Tony comes down, she’s tucked into the hollow of Steve’s neck, warm and safe, her body and mind drifting on an ocean of warm hazy contentment. She loves Steve, she
They take the Chinese out to the lounge to eat it when it arrives, because to be honest they’re a bunch of overgrown teenagers who’re fine with eating straight from the box in front of the TV. Tony rushes to grab the honey sesame chicken, but Natasha somehow slides in front of her and gets to it first, sending a smug look Tony’s way.
The bell rings. Sarah kisses Steve goodbye, because she has to go, and Steve hoists his own bag onto his shoulders as well as Tony’s. ‘No,’ he says sternly, when Tony tries to take it back, and starts marching off towards the class, Tony scampering to catch up and walk alongside him.
I’ve marked this as 1/1 chapters because it works as a complete story, but I *ahem* may possibly have Plans for continuing this fic. Anyone interested in soft caveman bunny kisses? Steve gently licking Tony’s face?
‘Tony,’ Steve whispers again, against his cheek; and then his mouth is suckling Tony’s skin, damp and warm on his cheek, his throat, his chin; they’re mating bites, and Tony yelps and shudders and presses into them. And then Steve’s mouth is at Tony’s own, and he draws Tony’s lip between his own and bites, very gently.
It’s Steve singing, Steve’s soft breasts that Tony is currently snuggled into, Steve’s hand running soothingly through her hair. When Tony tips her face drowsily back to look up at her, Steve’s hand curves around the back of Tony’s head to hold it against her shoulder.
Tony meets her eyes, full of trust, and Steve smiles a little and holds her gaze as she touches her again; this time, a gentle stroke down the slope of each shoulder. She hesitates above Tony’s softly peaked breasts, and Tony bites her lip, arching her body a little, pleading for the touch. Steve strokes slowly down the outer side of each breast, then runs a gentle thumb along the hot soft spaces beneath them.
‘Watch’a doing?’ Steve says, leaning over to see. Steve hasn’t finished his Numbers, he’s only half way through, but Steve hates Numbers.
Tony lets out a little breath he’s been holding. And he’s trembling, but he slowly reaches his own hand out, tentative and uncertain, and brushes the fingertips against the Stranger’s calloused palm. And the Stranger smiles a little, his eyes soft, and wraps his fingers around Tony’s.
They fit together, Tony nested into the comforting curve of Steve's body, and Tony forgets about the fact that she’s dirty and horrible, and just
a breakup message but somehow Tony’s managed to turn this thing to shit anyway, just like she always does. And now she’ll have to pull out the note and read it in front of Steve and the shame of it all is rising up and pressing on her throat, and she wants to cry but – but…
‘Hug,’ Darcy prompts, and Steve actually shifts gingerly closer and puts his arm slowly and carefully around Tony. And now Tony’s being hugged from both sides, and it’s – nice, it’s
soft, and her eyes are very blue, beautiful blue, and she’s smiling and it feels like the sun. ‘Hi Tony,’ she says, and runs the pink tip of her tongue over soft, sweet lips, and Tony can’t look away from Steve’s lips and face and eyes.
me like that!’ Then she’s right there, and – and she’s touching Tony, running her hands over her shoulders, her back, bringing her palm up to cup Tony’s face, and what, what…?
, Steve in a damply clinging white T-shirt, black shorts showing every curve of her hips and thighs, Steve's long legs, muscled and lightly sprinkled with golden hair, Steve's hair tousled and her lips soft and parted and her eyes blown wide with want. Tony makes a helpless, desperate little sound and launches at her, hands roaming Steve's arms and shoulders, chests pressing softly together, rocking against each other as they kiss.
I also realised I hadn’t replied to lots of the comments on the last chapter. So I’ll be going through those as well, sorry everyone for the long wait. Your wonderful comments made me so happy, thank you!! *hugs everyone*
Steve glances at him very quickly, then looks back at the batter he’s spooning into a cupcake case. ‘Her girlfriend,’ he says under his breath.
When it’s time for Maggie to go, she gives Darcy a hug and a drops kisses on each of her cheeks. ‘Bye, darling girl,’ she says; and then she turns to Tony and Steve. ‘It was nice to meet you,’ she says, and she pats Tony’s shoulder; and Tony sighs happily at the touch and smiles softly up at her because she’s really nice.
Steve turns around and beckons, and Tony looks up, and it’s Steve’s Mom. (Her name is actually Sarah, she’d told Tony to call her that the second time they’d met.) ‘Oh, so I’m allowed to come over now?’ she asks Steve, half-laughing, and Steve’s face goes kind of pink and he scuffs his feet.
Tony draws in a breath and then nods bravely. There’s a spreading wet spot at the front of the pretty panties, which Steve would like to gently suck at through the soft fabric, but she doesn’t. It’s too soon for that. Instead, she trails teasing fingertips up Tony’s thighs, laughing softly when Tony gasps and squirms. ‘Shh,’ she hushes again, and runs her hand through Tony’s hair, slipping down to softly cup her cheek for a moment. ‘I’ve got you, sweet girl.’
Tony curls his knees in and tucks himself into Steve’s side with a sigh. And Steve skritches with his pencils while Tony reads, and it’s quiet and nice and the tightness in Tony’s throat slowly fades away.
‘Nat’ral selection,’ Clint slurs, waving his hand flappily in the air. He yawns hugely, and Bucky snorts at him.
‘I – I, I don’t know,’ Tony says in a tiny, shaky voice. ‘Steve,’ and he closes his eyes tightly so he doesn’t have to see all the strange people. His legs are wobbly, so he sits down abruptly on the grass, eyes still squeezed shut. He can feel Steve plonking down too, his arm still around Tony, and Tony’s fingers clutch at the bottom of his hoodie.
She hesitates for a bare second by Steve's door, unsure if she should knock, but then JARVIS makes the decision for her, smoothly swinging the door open in front of her. And if Steve’s not able to come and open it herself… Tony's heart is pounding, high and frightened in her throat, as she pushes open the inner door to Steve's bedroom.
But Steve’s hand is rubbing reassuringly at the dip of his back, so Tony shyly presses his nose back against Steve’s and is rewarded by a smile. ‘So pretty,’ Steve murmurs, and Tony still doesn’t know what that means. He wriggles enquiringly.
‘Do you want to go?’ Steve asks her, and Tony actually does, despite the delicious comfortable lethargy of being snuggled up in Steve’s warm hold.
Steve lays the branches down in a neat pile and lowers himself onto the ground with a satisfied sigh, smiling at Tony and reaching out towards him with his hand. Tony shivers happily, crawling into the warm crook of Steve’s arm; Steve draws him in close to his side, rubbing his cheek against Tony’s head.
Steve smiles down at Tony's eye. Just – smiles, and waits, her thumb stroking a little bit on Tony's shoulder.
They go to bed when everyone’s yawning too hard to focus on the program or anything else. Tony’s arguing loudly with Clint, something about coniferous forestation; her eyes keep slipping shut and she doesn’t even know what she’s saying anymore, but she’s damned if she’s going to let Clint win. As neither her or Clint know anything about conifers, it’s probably not much point anyway, but Steve is chuckling, a warm soft solidity against Tony’s side, and Steve’s arm is tucked around her and Tony feels safe and sleep-drunkenly happy.
When she peeps back up at Steve, Steve's standing there warm and sun-washed and lovely, looking down at Tony with the oddest expression on her face, soft-eyed. And when Tony meets her gaze, Steve just quirks the corner of her mouth up, and reaches out to slide her hand through Tony's hair before she goes.
When it’s finished, the shadows are growing long and cool, and Tony’s hands are red and sore from pulling and coaxing the skin, but he feels warm inside, satisfied with his work. He carves a small pattern into the solid packed earth of the cave floor; the grip makes the knife steady and sure in his hand. It’s a beautiful tool, now, something useful and strong that Tony has made better and more sure, and he hopes and hopes that it will be a worthy gift for Steve, who has given Tony so much.
, Tony, you’re so,’ Steve says; her voice is rough and strange and she breaks off whatever she was going to say with a little breathless cracked laugh. ‘You’re so… I should. I should go.’ She hesitates, and then she’s reaching out, and touching a knuckle very gently to Tony’s cheek before she strides away.
had another fight before, because Darcy had wanted the plane they were making to be red and gold, and Steve had wanted blue with stars. Luckily they’d agreed to do a mix of both, so now the plane’s going to be blue and red with white stars.)
, everything working smoothly and exactly right. But now her back's kind of aching, and she's starving.
Tony makes a tiny shaking movement with her head, and now something else is rising up inside her; horror.
‘Only for you,’ she breathes again, and Steve makes a breathless, huffing, joyous little laugh and brings her arm up to snag Tony in close against her chest, nestling her face into her hair.
‘Steve,’ she says warningly. ‘I’m moving Tony because you were fighting, and you know that fighting isn’t allowed in this classroom. Jane will be sitting here for the next week. After that, it will depend on your behaviour. Tony, pack up your things and move to Jane’s desk.’
'Um,' Steve says, and she sounds awkward, suddenly, and when Tony looks up at her through sleep-tangled eyelashes, Steve's face is faintly pink and she shifts self-consciously, not meeting Tony's eyes. 'Uh,' she says, 'you were – you were sleeping, so I thought – I. I didn't, you know, touch your clothes or anything. I just thought – well, your room was further away, and...' She trails off, rubbing the back of her neck.
Tony picks the envelope up with fumbling fingers, trying to screw up the courage to turn it over and open it, because – because it’s easier to rip a band-aid off quickly. But at that moment, of all things, the morning silence shatters with the emergency call to assemble. And Tony shoves Steve’s note deep in her pocket, shoves the hurt down just as deep inside, and suits up. The world needs Iron Woman, not Tony Stark and her stupid,
Darcy. We’ve talked about this,’ she says, and pulls Darcy in for a hug of her own, ruffling her hair.
Tony squeaks in terror and drops the pencil. Oh no, oh no, oh no no no, Steve’s back from the craft box, oh no no
, even softer than he imagined, and he cuddles it and presses his face in it and then cuddles it some more.
They cuddle for a while, because this thing they do doesn’t have to be rushed; it’s slow and gentle and soft. Then Steve says, ‘How about a nice warm shower, baby? Want me to wash you?’ and Tony wriggles happily.
He kind of wishes the boy would turn round and say hello. That would be nice. But the boy – Steve – is looking left and right with narrow eyes, frowning a bit.
Tony knows she’s flushing, too, intensely aware of Steve next to her; and then Steve shifts and squeezes Tony’s shoulder very briefly, and then stands up, and Tony thinks it’s a bit like she fills the room with goldenness, drawing everyone’s gaze. God, why is she having thoughts like that?
When they’re finished, Steve cracks her neck with a sigh and stretches back, one arm ending up lying across the back of the sofa behind Tony’s shoulders. Tony squeezes her eyes closed; she doesn’t expect Steve to put her arm around her like the other time, of course. That was really – that was really nice, but she was sick and only about half-conscious and she can understand why Steve had to support her
Natasha’s sitting on her desk with her feet swinging, grinning. Clint has his head cocked to one side, and he’s tearing some purple paper into heaps of little bits. Jane’s there, too, showing Steve her pink woven friendship bracelet. Steve’s looking interestedly at the bracelet, but he looks up when Darcy and Tony arrive, and his face softens a bit.
, and oh, Steve! Steve’s actually, really, truly his proper friend now. Tony hums happily in his throat and nestles in, enjoying it. Darcy giggles.
lickable collarbones, every time she tries to look up. It’s not appropriate, not even a little bit, God, Steve’s just had a
, made things easier for his people, which was why it had hurt so much when they had let Obi – when they had stood together and bound him and laid him out on the altar to die…
‘Steve’s staring,’ Darcy tells him after a bit. She sounds pleased. Tony has to see, so he peeks over Darcy’s shoulder, wiping his nose on his sleeve.
Tony’s bent over his desk, drawing. Steve and Tasha are up the front doing extra Maths, so their seats are empty.
It’s a big gash, slit across the huge calloused palm of Steve’s hand, but half healed, the edges clean and scabbed over.
. What does that mean? Tony tries it out on his tongue. ‘Pretty. Pretty?’ He looks back at Steve, his head cocked to one side in question.
Tony gave one quick flick of his hand to shut down the workshop, and shuffled the two of them out the door. “Try sounding just a little genuine when you talk to them, okay? Some sincerity goes a long way in an apology.”
“Steve, we need you to step back, okay? Can you do that? The medical team needs you to take a couple steps back.” She knelt down in front of him and put a comforting hand on his shoulder. Her tone was soothing, like she was speaking to a child. When he didn’t budge, she gave him a small smile. “Can you do that? For me?”
The overhead lights were glaringly bright. The air was still, and no one dared make a move. All pencil scratching had stopped, one camera flashed swiftly but no more followed. The tension in the air was palpable. The suspense was nearly overwhelming.
Rhodey sighed and threw his hands up. “Fine! I’ll stop by on Monday.” He went to end the call but stopped. “If something’s going on, you can talk to me about it. Just give me a call.”
For instance, even if technology could be frustrating, it was still so impressive. The ability to communicate with anyone on the planet and keep up to date on the whole world’s news was amazing. People were so creative. And art, books, science, and anything he could think of was so easily accessible now.
Steve cleared his throat and shoved his hands in his pockets. “Uh hi, sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt.” God, he sounded like a nervous teenager. “I was hoping I could talk to you for a few minutes.”
At this point, everyone could tell the tension was getting a bit too thick. Either this argument was going to peter out calmly, or something explosive was going to happen. It was almost never the former.
First of all, people were so wasteful now. Back during the war, you ate anything you could get your hands on, whether it was palatable or not. And technology had made bounds in the last 70 years. With all the world’s knowledge packed into the smallest computers he’d ever seen; Steve couldn’t believe there were still so many ignorant people out there. And every time he thought he’d gotten the hang of a piece of technology, something new came to take its place and he had to start all over.
asked to be picked up. Tony never asked for anything. So Clint had at least some reason to be worried. Another message buzzed on his phone.
Tony was no stranger to self-loathing, but hearing Steve dismiss their home and their family like that really was like taking a bullet straight through the heart.
The gentle sounds of friendly chatter on the side street were a harsh contrast to the blaring of horns and shouting that came from the main roads. Thankfully, the surrounding buildings blocked the majority of those noises. A muffled cheer came from inside a sports bar, and pleasant string music wafted out of the Bistro across the courtyard. A quick laugh burst from a group dining in the patio a few tables away.
“I guess I just wanted to remind myself why we’re all doing this. What this is all even for.” As he spoke, he swept one hand out, gesturing to the entire city.
He turned to his computer and decided to work on some programming instead. If he just focused on his work right now, he wouldn’t have to wonder what he was going to do about the team, how he’d handle seeing them and not thinking of them as family.
“Well if you’re going to act like a child, I’m going to treat you like a child. There’s no reason for you to be throwing a tantrum! What even is your problem tonight?”
Steve nodded, essentially numb at this point. He wanted to believe their comforting words, but Jarvis’ assessment still lingered on his mind. He slumped at the memory, not bothering with false appearances.
And wasn’t Clint always a pushover for the puppy dog eyes. “Fine! Slap a Band-Aid on that and we’ll stop somewhere on the way back for new shirts. You’re buying, though!”
“I’ve been so scared these last few days thinking I’d never be able to tell you how I really feel. I kept thinking
Tony wiped his face, leaving a grease streak on his cheek. He waved his soldering iron wielding hand in dismissal, “It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.” You could practically hear the ‘
There wasn’t any real reason to be alarmed, sometimes these things went longer than strictly established. The team was just antsy to spend some time together.
Steve groaned when he realized he’d thrown everything Tony had done for him to the side like it hadn’t meant anything at all. He felt like such an ass sometimes.
Tony looked like he wanted to say no, but he let the adult in him win this time. “I’ve got about ten minutes until I need to make myself presentable. Sorry if you were hoping for longer. You caught me at a bad time.”
Tony gestured to the small stain on his shirt. “I figured getting mugged was reaching my rock bottom. And what better way to escape rock bottom than get as high as possible?”
Steve took in a sharp breath and took off towards the suit, cutting through the haze. “Hawkeye! Update,
He was thoughtful and sincere and wouldn’t hesitate to give everything he had to make someone else’s life just a smidge better. Everything he did, he did to improve people’s lives.
The soldering iron in Tony’s hand slipped and brushed against the fingers holding a wire in place. “Fuck!” Tony put the tool in its stand and stuck his finger in his mouth, trying to blink the wetness out of his eyes. Clearly he wasn’t going to be handy for a couple hours.
Bringing himself back to the present situation, he wondered how long he could feign sleep before someone noticed. He was sure at least one person was in the room, if the warmth and weight around his hand was anything to go on. It was nice, just laying there, not having any responsibilities for just a few minutes. It was nearly peaceful.
You look like Rocky used you for a sandbag. There’s no way that happened on a mission. The face plate would’ve shattered.”
I may be able to loan him to you from time to time.” He walked away without giving Fury time to answer.
The team shared a couple of glances. The thing was, lately, Steve hadn’t really been acting himself. They were closing in on the anniversary after he went into the ice and as the date drew closer, he drew more into himself. It would be understandable if this hadn’t been going on for a month and a half now.
So maybe that was the only healthy choice he’d made that week, but at least it was something. He caught a few hours of sleep here and there, avoided team dinners at all costs, if they were even still having them, and living off the stash of granola bars and assorted dried fruits he had hidden around the lab. The only reason he left was for an important shareholder meeting. And he’d unfortunately have to venture out again soon for the upcoming socialite networking event.
His façade built back up quickly, and his shoulder’s stiffened with a hint of nervousness. He slowly started to return to his ‘tidying’. “What can I do for you, Cap?”
Tony was sitting on the second highest “rung”- so to speak- of one the Manhattan Bridge’s suspension towers. His suit coat was covered in a few dirt spots and wrinkled from exertion. The sleeves of his jacket and dress shirt were pushed up to bare his forearms, and there was a small tear in the hem of his pants.
