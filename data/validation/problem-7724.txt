“Thanks Wade.”
THREE chapters left 😙
“Well, you were underage.” Ned reminded him, bringing his thoughts to the present.
Since he’d talked to his mother about going on birth control, he’d made an appointment with Dr McIntosh to review his options.
Steve shot a glare at Harley, only a little bit surprised by the news. Harley was supposed to be turning over a new leaf. “Harley. Really? Who haven’t you slept with?”
“Lady Nertha,” he spoke whilst bowing before her. His tone was mockingly even though his words held nothing but truth. She was Lady Nertha of Asgard, daughter of Princess Hela Odindottir.
Tony glared at Tate at the mention of his infidelity and Tate realizes he needs to object. “Your honor. I don’t see how any of this is relevant to the case.”
“Then where does that leave Anna?” Harley wondered. He knew she was up to something, but she couldn’t pin her to anything at this point.
?” She added the last part as an afterthought.
Stephen gave it some thought, thinking back to his time at the bar prior to getting home last night. “Yes…” Stephen confessed. “There was a Johnathan Doeran.”
“You hurt me Sam.” Bucky whispered by his ear. His voice almost broke. “So much and I thought we were better than that.” Bucky pulled away after his final word. “I don’t want you here in our home tonight. Your apology doesn’t erase the hurt you caused me.”
T’challa then placed his hand on Bucky’s shoulder leading them inside the palace. The Dora Milaje followed, leaving Sam to gawk at the closeness the King and his husband shared. He didn’t like it.
“What? How do u know?” Peter inquired as he watched Harley mess around with his phone. Morgan advanced towards her older brother. She wanted to know too of course.
Tony shook his head. “You’re joking. You have to be.” How could he be pregnant? Really?
“You have a lot of stuff.” Tony remarked.
“Morgan, you should have stayed with your Dad after the divorce.” Amelia teased. Torunn agreed and Morgan actually let out a laugh. In trying to keep the conversations about anything but her miscarriage, Amelia shared something she had noticed from the days she’d been visiting Morgan. “Your dad has been spending a lot of time here.” She noted.
“Nice place, guys.” Jaime commented, taking in the decor of Nathan and Morgan’s new home. His Aunt Natasha and Bruce had picked him up from the airport and this was the first place he wanted to go. Nathan had talked so much about his place with Morgan, it made Jaime eager to see it and Morgan was proud of it, after weeks of decorating. The trio got comfortable on one of their sofas before Nathan left them to go tend to a meowing Binx – their black kitten, their baby.
one in those two weeks but he really didn’t need everyone and their mama or his mom to know yet if things didn’t work out.

“What?” She bit out.
“But I’m still right.” She insisted. Pepper wouldn’t know if there was any truth to that. She’d have to wait for something to come up like everyone else.
.” Stephen stated. They’d never be his kids no matter how they currently felt about their dad.
Steve peered down at him, settling one hand on his hip and the other on his cheek. “Wish you hadn’t.” He stated, pressing his lips to Tony’s, forgetting they had an audience.
Steve hugged her briefly and pecked her cheek as he headed towards the elevator. “Goodbye Morgan.” He almost sang the words. Morgan could sense the glee in them.
"We dated for a few months and we were married for 2 years."
Nat glanced to Bruce, with a ‘what did I do wrong’ look on her face. “You know how Tony is. He hasn’t fully forgiven Steve and –”
Wade hummed. “We can’t all be good at everything.” He smiled, asking Peter to take his first bite.
Anna stared at him for a second, wondering if she should answer him genuinely. Tony encouraged her, when she looked his way. “I could kill you – drain your life force.” Her voice was small. “That is if my skin touches yours long enough. I could steal your memories and
“We’re way pass that. I’m not trying to get Tony back.” Justin informed her. His eyes had darkened. “I was ruined because of him.” According to Justin, after they’d broken up, Tony humiliated him and his company, Hammer Industries suffered in the long run. He’d lost everything because of Tony. He wanted revenge. “I’m going to take everything he loves and burn it to the ground. I want him to suffer the way I did.” He explained.
“Just want to get to know you.”
Harley moved the screen around, so it was displaying Peter’s suit. “I’m trying not to think about my dad’s situation.” Jacob caught on. Amelia had told him about Steve and Nat. “I don’t even know why it bothers me so much.”
It startled him as he was busy reading, tracing his fingers over the braille before him.
“Hello, princess.”
Wade hated that Peter was stuck and unhappy in his home. He wished he could help in some way, but Wade knew Peter couldn’t move in with him, so he had to suggest the next best thing. “Why not stay with your father?” But they’d had this conversation several times before.
“I know Bucky and I’m so sorry. I really am. I should have trusted you.” Sam uttered as he walked towards his husband and tried embrace him. Bucky gave in.
“So, your mom’s gay huh?” Then Harley was talking again before Jacob could respond. “That’s hot.” Harley burst out into fits of laughter, but Jacob knew Harley. He knew he was serious. Jacob was in the middle of getting himself a drink when Harley’s phone went off and put a pause on his laughter. Harley opened the text that had popped up and hurried to his feet.
Kayla smiled. “Alright.” She could do that.
“Yeah. I know. It’s been years though.” Nat rebutted.
“On Asgard?” Harley’s eyes widened and his lips parted with a silent gasp. No human, no mortal had ever been to Asgard in all their recorded history.
Torunn was surprised to hear this. She never thought Harley would change. “That’s good Harley. You will find life to be much happier this way.”
“I…” he was hesitating. “I care for you Stephen. I really do, a lot. I’m just a little scared to love again not since –” And Stephen captured Tony’s lips with his. They made out for a while, Stephen groping his ass and pinching his nipples. Tony was getting hard again and Stephen started stroking him. Tony moaned into the kiss and Stephen got between his legs, positioning himself at his hole. He pulled away. Tony was struggling to catch his breath.
Peter hesitated for a second. “I am. What about you? I’ve never seen you around here before.” Deadpool stopped circling him and stood behind him. He was closer than he was before and Peter didn’t think that was possible. This guy really didn’t know personal space and Peter couldn’t bring himself to take a step or two back.
“Another?” he glanced at Sif, asking her why she would let Thor do that to her again.
Wade sighed, faking exasperation. “Well, if you must know. I can read minds,”
“He was my first love.” He shouted back. “We have so much history and we only fell apart because of Hammer. If he hadn’t interfered with our lives, we’d still be together.” He said, as a matter of a fact. He chose Stephen because he didn’t know how to repair his relationship with Steve. He wanted a fresh start and Stephen was rather ungrateful about it.
“Gotta try.”
“He’s the father of my children – my four children.” He reminded him, folding his arms over his chest. “We co-parent –” Peter and Anna were still under 18. “– and we’re friends.”
Steve shook his head, taking a step back. “I do not pretend like she can do no wrong.” Steve Rogers really did believe he treated all his kids fairly and equally.
“You really think it’s a girl, huh?” Tony teased.
Morgan scoffed. “Okay. Ew.” She seemed to genuinely want to throw up. “Talk of any of our brothers is off limits if its sexual.” Amelia couldn’t agree more while Torunn was grateful. She hated to be reminded that the person she’d given her virginity to was also the subject of so many past affairs, one of such being with a horny Lila Barton.
“Father said he’d spoken with him recently. He and the rest of the guardians hope to visit Earth some time this year.” Torunn supplied.
“James.” T’challa greeted, smiling at him. Sam was taken off guard. No one called Bucky, James. He watched Bucky to see his reaction. He only returned the smile.
"That's crazy."
“Mom….” Her voice cracked. “It won’t stop…” Tony ran to her, trying desperately to calm her down. “I can’t stop it…the baby.” She choked out her last words.
“Very.” Hela added. Nertha was happy to hear that and Hela did love a good family fight. It was harmless fun. Thor would beg to differ. We can’t fight amongst ourselves, he’d say. Torunn smirked at her cousin and Nertha scoffed.
Steve pulled out of Tony, who winched at the loss. Steve got an eyeful of Tony’s clenching hole dripping with cum. He groaned in arousal and frustration. Tony sat up, pulling a robe on while Steve dragged on his pants, trying to keep his erection down. They both went to the connected bathroom and tried to clean themselves up. Tony took longer of course so Steve reached Harley first.
And the other to his dad.
"I was 34." He saw Steve make a face. There was a trend evident. Tony Stark always dated younger men. And Tony hurried to justify himself. "He was very mature for his age. We loved each other."
Steve glared at Harley, his arms folded over his chest. “Really Harley?”
When Steve Rogers met Tony Stark, he was newly 20 years old and still being subjected to the whims of Margaret “Peggy” Carter. The Super Soldier division were running tests on him one day in July of 1996 when Tony stopped by at Stark Industries.
“Aunt Nat.” Harley proclaimed, reading whatever was on the screen of his phone. “The gun used was one of Aunt Nat’s.” He announced, proudly.
“Well we can’t. We’re both taken.” Morgan explained. “Someone has to live out our fantasies.”
“Let’s have lunch.” Tony said, boldly. “My treat.”
“That’s me.”
he thought. Stephen was splashing water in his face. “And I chose you.”
“How did you three decide that your sister, your own flesh and blood was a killer?”
“Okay. Talk to you later.” He responded, after which the screen before him disappeared and he found Steve standing a few feet away.
“I’m happy you guys broke up. I’m sorry for saying it Mom but Stephen Strange gave me a bad vibe.” Morgan insisted. She sounded like Steve and it made Tony uneasy and then guilty because Morgan had moved out of her home because of Stephen.
Anna was reminded of the fact that Morgan didn’t wish to pursue college anymore. That her older sister didn’t want Stark Industries though it was written in their mother’s will. Anna would happily take full ownership if Peter nor Harley wanted it either and she was almost sure they didn’t.
When one antagonist falls, another one rises..or two..
And if that wasn’t enough baby-ness, Valkyrie was currently pregnant with hers and Rhodey’s
His wondering gaze focused on Steve and he said the few words he wasn’t prepared to hear for at least another week.
Tony’s face was the first thing Stephen saw when he woke up. Tony was alerted of Stephen’s consciousness when he heard him groan. Stephen was rushed to the hospital the night before. It was scary for him. He cared for Stephen. He didn’t want to lose him; he’d grown pretty attached to Stephen after 9 months of being in each other’s lives.
Remy then removed the glove and caressed her check, anticipating the pain but was pleased to say it never came. Anna stared at her, asking with her eyes. “Nothing.” He responded, finally kissing her full on the mouth. “Missed you, ‘chere.”
Steve looked up at Tony, after he got his shirt on. “What?”
“I’m sorry.” Steve tried again.
Her cheeks redden and she cleared her throat before excusing herself to the bathroom. The other girls let laughter ring through the room.
"Stop." Harley's tone had soften. "You dont get to talk about my other father." He took a moment to compose himself. Talking about his other father was always a touchy subject and he didn't need some gold digging whore's opinion on it. "You better not try anything to hurt my father or I will hurt you."
“Girls!” He shouted, shutting up his daughters instantly and halting their efforts of attack. He glanced back at Tony who had been staying quiet and subconsciously rubbing his left side. It was clear his mind was elsewhere. “Tones?” He called out.
Stephen got on his feet and faced him. “We’re engaged Tony.” He snarked. “I’m about to be your husband and I can’t go a day without hearing about your ex.” Tony set his phone down and took a deep breath. Maybe this was a given, his fiancée was bound to get upset about all this time he spent with Steve but...
Peter found Shuri shadowing Prince Azari. She had taken it upon herself to keep an eye out for her nephew from the day he was born. He was to be King one day and Shuri took great pride in seeing over him. The little prince was currently eating handfuls of cake with Winter and a few other giggling kids. She had not seen Peter approaching her.
Torunn acknowledged her parents next, bowing before them. Thor helped her up, pulling her into a hug while Sif held a 3-month-old Magni in her arms. “Torunn, welcome home.” Then he released Torunn and hugged Harley. “Welcome to Asgard, Tonyson.” Thor had the tendency to alternate between calling Harley, Tonyson or Steveson from time to time.
“Karen! Override!” Peter shrieked at the mention of Deadpool. It wasn’t going to help the situation if his mom found out what Wade did for a living. At least not right now because talk of Deadpool ultimately meant talk of Spiderman.
“I want a baby too.” To fill the gap, his children leaving home, was creating in his heart. He wanted a baby too but definitely not Stephen’s. And they ended the conversation with a kiss.
“Right.” Gamora settled, reaching across the table for some food. “It’s almost always someone close.” Her years of fighting equipped her with that knowledge.
Remy’s memories of her came to the forefront of his mind as Amelia refreshed them, reverberating things said before. “She was involved with Uncle Steve because of Hammer. She’s dating Uncle Bruce.”
“Love you too.” Peter mumbled, staring at the closed door a little confused until he put two and two together. He got down to the garage and realized that his father’s car was still parked outside from the day before. He decided to send a text to his group chat with his siblings. After which he pulled out of the driveway and off to school.
Steve held Tony’s hand as he spoke. Tony squeezed it gently before Steve retracted and decided to hold him at the waist instead, craving any physicality he could with their baby. Their four children watched them curiously as they remained silent for a time as they stared into each other’s eyes.
“You can control it though, to some degree. I know.”
Tony came across the four of them amid all the excitement of the party. Eleanor quickly took a liking to Tony and vice versa. Tony expressed how wonderful and intelligent the 5-year-old was and found it hard to believe she had any of Wade’s DNA in her.
This went on for some time until Steve saw Peggy entering the room with who he soon learned was Tony Stark.
“Maybe a little,” Peter supplied and started getting out of bed. “I’m just gonna brush my teeth.”
“Tony,” he began. “I love everything about you. Every. Single. Thing.” And he kissed Tony’s navel, briefly addressing the scar from his horrible shooting incident.
Steve could see and hear that Tony was getting a bit choked up and a little emotional.
“And maybe it just wasn’t the right time.” Maria explained further. Morgan never thought of that. “The universe will give you a baby when the time is right.”
Stephen decided not to force the conversation and ultimately left the room. It had been a long night and he did need to rest. They’d talk about this again later because Stephen knew with everything, he’d heard from Rhodey about Hammer, chances of Tony and Steve rekindling their relationship were extremely high. But he couldn’t let that happen. He couldn’t let Steve Rogers take Tony away from him. He couldn’t let him win.
“Don’t say it like that.” Bucky protested, placing the empty container in his kitchen sink and grabbing a bottle of wine from his fridge. He poured them both a glass. “But we are still trying for another baby.” Bucky added.
“Sorry I was just looking for you and kind of just kept listening,” He apologized but Tony wasn’t paying much attention to him. Steve decided to say what he had meant to earlier. “Morgan is doing better.” Tony was surprised to hear this.
“No!” he almost shouted. “I love Peter. I want to be with him. I’m not going to take advantage of him.” Steve stared at him. He could sense a hint of sincerity in Wade’s words. “I want to marry him…” Steve raised an eyebrow. “…one day.”
Stephen huffed and disappeared into the en suite before he said something he would regret. But Tony was riled up and couldn’t fathom the reason he would be behaving this dramatically. “Why are you so mad about this?” he shouted. “I found out that my ex didn’t cheat on me by his own will – the sole reason for the destruction of our relationship,” his voice lowered as he walked towards the open bathroom door, grabbing a robe that was hanging nearby to cover himself. “I had the opportunity to be with him.”
By the time Harley was 16, his birthday parties had developed a pattern – strippers, underage drinking and loud, obnoxious music. Tony allowed him to have his parties on the other side of the property far away from the main house, in one of the guest houses which Harley made sure was soundproof. Steve and Tony had only found out two years ago what really happened at those parties. They forbid Harley from having those types of parties on Stark property, but Harley of course had found a way around that.
“It’s not yours.” He blurted out and Steve chuckled because why would he ever believe that? What would be story behind the baby not being his? That Tony had cheated? Never in a million years. Steve knew that.
Amelia scoffed but she had to agree, Pietro was pretty good looking. She wondered what he was up to these days. At least Morgan was smiling.
Steve had put Harley and Morgan to bed and was heading back to the party area to help Tony finish cleaning when he saw Nat still there. They had discussed the situation and Steve asked that they forget it ever happened and move pass it. Nat, however, wanted to tell Tony to clear her conscience.
Torunn shrugged. “I don’t know what to say.” Because her mind was working to come up with possible answers for this new revelation.
“Who’s that?” He had to ask, pointing slightly in her direction.
Steve hesitated for another second before he stepped out of the way and let Tony in. Steve closed the door behind him after he did and watched Tony take in the scene of his home. There were a lot of unopened boxes of full of items for the baby. It made the apartment feel smaller than the last time he was there.
“Great. I’m actually going over the guest list with Tony right now.” Pepper explained.
“I’m so sorry Tony.” She managed. Pepper could imagine Tony waving her off.
Bet you can't guess who their kid is... even though he's been mentioned as a extra character as early as Chapter 7 😏
He finished his plate and sat by the breakfast table adjacent the kitchen. Tony got a lovely view of his back lawn which sparked memories of his Mother’s Day Brunch. Peter and Morgan made their own plates and joined him at the table.
Tony remembered that night. How he stayed up, waiting for his husband while he was out screwing his friend. The tears travelled down his cheeks, clouding his vision but he spoke in Steve’s direction. “How could you sleep with my friend?” then at Nat. “How could you sleep with my husband?”
“Relax. I’m not going to hurt you,” Deadpool explained. “I like you. See you around, Spidey.” And he hopped off the building, landing somewhere below. Peter rushed to see where he had landed but he was nowhere in sight.
Harley had just finish talking with his wife when he departed to the main house. His kitchen was lacking, and he knew his grandmother was always cooking so there would definitely be food there.
Steve stopped second guessing the situation however and picked Tony up before seating him on the kitchen island. They really had to be quick about this and equally quiet. Once Steve had started pulling Tony’s pants down his legs, Tony captured his mouth with his own. His shirt was gone next and their kisses were hurried and hot. He could feel Steve getting hard against his thigh and as much as he wanted to take this slow. He knew there was no time. In a second, Steve had pulled away from the kiss and dropped down to his knees, taking Tony’s erect cock between his lips. He was alternating between kisses and sucking the tip and then there were two fingers curling inside him. Tony closed his eyes before they started rolling back in his head. Steve watched as his lips slowly parted, little sounds escaping from them. Tony wondered to himself, was there really any time for this. He just wanted to be fucked. Was there time for him to cum once and still get fucked?
“I wish.” Steve sighed. “Your mom deserves better. Better than me. Better than Strange.”
Nertha was displeased by all the wedding preparations that were taking place around her in the palace’s grandest ball room and she regretted everything. She was the reason for Torunn and Harley’s betrothal. A mortal, though it was one she was once infatuated with, would hold more power and authority on Asgard than she ever would. She regretted it all.
“Wade.” It wasn’t a question. He knew his name now. Wade Wilson.
“We can’t make any promises.”  Bucky informed her, giving her a serious look, and she nodded to let her papa know she was listening and that she understood. He and Sam had been trying for years but there wasn’t any right way to tell a 10-year-old their parents stopped trying for a baby after so many years of failing.
She got dressed and went in search of him. Her first thoughts were that he was probably in the lab in the basement so that’s where she went. Harley tend to have invention ideas in the middle of the night and got up to work on them right away.
Steve engaged in a soft lullaby for the baby in his arms. He kissed the baby’s forehead, pushing its little strands of blonde hair out of the way.
Chapter 29: High Off the Feeling
Binx was curled up by Morgan’s head but on his pillow. Morgan was still sound asleep under the covers, when he shut his bedroom door softly. He knew to be particularly quiet because she was a light sleeper. He moved Binx out of the way and over to the other side of the bed where she settled into a comfortable position and went back to sleep. He looked over at her and could hear soft breaths escaping her lips. Morgan was still asleep.
Steve let himself be known and then he was handed a sheet of paper. “Mr. Rogers, you’ve been served.” The paper was an issued a court order and sure enough Steve’s name was on it. “Mr. Stark is pleading for sole custody of Nicholas Rogers.” The man let that sink in. Steve was shocked obviously as was everyone else. Tony had been missing with his son for almost a month and now he was trying to get custody of the child he had adamantly expressed he didn’t want, over and over again.
“You know, I’ve always wanted a sister.” Morgan’s thoughts took her back to Sharon whom they’d all believed was carrying her father’s child at some point. She wondered if Anna had been caught up on all the drama that had taken place recently. “It’s been a pain being the only girl in the family.”
“How are you, with Rhodey –
Tony’s lips parted as he took a breath. Steve felt his hold on him loosen and he pulled back before slamming into his husband. Tony whimpered and Steve leaned down to kiss him. His hands stayed in his blonde locks. Steve groaned at the assault to his head, feeling Tony’s nails scratch his scalp, then on his shoulders and upper back. His legs wrapped around his waist, using his heels to force Steve as deep into him as possible, making it harder for Steve to roll his hips. They found a rhythm, however. Steve was able to hit his sweet spot with each brutal thrust he made. Tony screamed out with each one. Steve could feel his husband’s erection pressing against his belly and he reached down between their bodies to stroke him until he released, clenching his hole even tighter around Steve’s cock.
“Niece, nephew.” He began. “I couldn’t help overhearing.” His tone made Torunn chuckle. He had to be eavesdropping. That sounded more like something her Uncle Loki would do. “Maybe we could come up with some sort of solution. Hm?” He motioned for the young couple to follow him.
“I have already grown to like you Harley. I think I always have.” She went on, resting her head on her hand.
“I’m surprised.” That was Tony’s kindest way of saying he was very much disappointed. He still didn’t look at her and Morgan could feel the tears falling down her face. She was crying. She doesn’t cry. It must be the hormones, right? She wasn’t crying because she knew she disappointed her parents, brought shame to them, ruined her future. She was supposed to take over S.I. Her name would be slandered. People would find out. It would look so bad on her parents. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers’ teenage daughter was a complete fuck-up. Not even Harley had ever messed up this badly and he was sleeping with any and everybody.
He was halfway out the door when the words slipped pass her lips. “I love you James.”
“Are you okay?” she questioned.
“Steve?,” came a soft voice behind him. Tony had just disappeared around the corner, cum dripping down his legs. Maria had managed to sneak up on him. “I thought I heard Tony in here.” And then she noticed his hair. “What happened to your hair, Steve?”
“Her royal highness, Princess Torunn of Asgard, Goddess of Thunder,” the minister spoke. “And for the first time, His royal highness, Prince Harley of Asgard.”
Tony averted his eyes. He’d heard that before. When he was younger and still new to the whole dating thing but that was a long time ago. He opened his mouth to speak but got cut off.
Carol was taken back by that. “I’m great. Why?” And Jacob decided it was best to just get to the meat of the matter.
This story has really been a labour of love. I've never been so passionate about a story and it really is my baby. I'm gonna miss it but it's time to move onto different things. And writing this story and putting out in the world is probably the best thing I could have done. It brought someone super special into my life.
“But I was always so careful Buck.” Steve ran his hands down his face before clasping them together under his nose, his elbows resting on the little tea party table set up before them. Clearly, he wasn’t careful enough.
He was still at a loss for words. “He’s coming to the Christmas party. Don’t make a scene Steve.” Tony then waltzed away, leaving an irritated Steve in his wake.
“Not many people do. It was years ago,” Morgan filled Michelle in. “So there’s always this awkward tension between Aunt Carol and Sif. It’s just never been this close to a fight.”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice finally broke through his thoughts and he opened his eyes. He wasn’t in shock. He didn’t look horrified. He didn’t look scared. He didn’t look angry. And if Tony didn’t know any better, he would say he look like he was in awe.
“No. You?” Bruce shot back. Nat’s left eye squinted, slightly, followed by a reassuring smile.
Harley mused, trying to stifle his laughter. “I’m just saying if it works, it works.” There was no harm or loss in being in a polygamous relationship.
“Neither had I, Uncle.” Torunn agreed.
“Yeah. SJ is going to be here sooner than we think...” Steve whispered. Tony glanced up at him, his eyebrows furrowed at the mention of
“Wonderful.” Torunn smiled at him and he watched her saunter away from him. He never noticed it before but Torunn Thorsdottir was a sight to behold. For the first time he was seeing Torunn as more than just Thor’s daughter or Morgan’s friend.
“I’ve been trying to reach him. He hasn’t been home in a few days. And he hasn’t been answering any of my calls or texts –” She went on.
Tony liked it rough these days. He could alternate between love making and fucking. He even enjoyed being tied up every now and then but since he’d gotten pregnant with the twins, he only ever wanted it rough and that’s how Steve knew Tony was pregnant. His sexual appetite had changed drastically and intensified.
“Can I ask why?” Sam asked while Bucky was left wallowing in his thoughts.
It was Loki and Hela that came up with a compromise. Let Harley and Torunn live on Earth. Torunn can come back at any time to do her duties. It sounded feasible. Torunn and Harley even agreed to return whenever Torunn had fallen pregnant so she could be cared for by their doctors and so their children could be born on Asgard. The young couple knew, however, that they’d want to return permanently one day.
“Yeah. That too.” Steve sighed.
“Marriage means forever.”
He smiled at her, his eyes crinkling at the corners. “I love you too.” And he meant it. They just needed some time to get pass this.
Harley only need be a good husband to Torunn and perform any royal obligations that may come with his new title. Otherwise, everything was the same. He could dress the same, talk the same.
Steve got the check. He cashed it in a few days ago. It was an exuberant sum of money. More than enough for an abortion but he wasn’t going to do that. He was keeping his baby. And even if he wasn't financially stable, he had so much support from the rest of the team. Bucky was doing the most, coming with him to his doctor visits, helping him making the crib, figuring out the stroller and all the little things in anticipation of the baby. Right now, he was sitting in the waiting room with Steve at the doctor’s office. It was his 20 weeks check up. He had sent a text to Tony with the time and date and place of the doctor’s appointment but as expected, he didn’t show up. He could see Tony had read the message though and he was clearly ignoring him and that broke his heart.
“Yeah.” He assured her. He let her get cleaned up before heading down to their mother’s lab together. They had a couple of “fix-it bots” somewhere down there that could help. And as they supervised the repair of Anna’s bedroom door, more questions pertaining to Anna’s relationship with Remy followed.
“Yet you two were spending a shit ton of time together afterwards. I couldn’t even go through my heartbreak in peace without seeing you two together.” Tony’s eyes got glossy and tears threaten to fall. It was one of his most painful memories, besides being kidnapped in Afghanistan all those years ago. He was pregnant with Peter the day he found out about Steve’s infidelity and he struggled with his pregnancy from that point onwards. As a result, he had a difficult labour, to the point where his heart had stopped for a while.
“Who’s Wade?” Steve inquired. He’d been asking this since Peggy’s funeral and got no answers.
Morgan and Anna met for lunch to catch up and discuss their father’s wellbeing. Morgan had moved out of Stark Mansion and into the Banners home. She was staying with Nathan while they searched for a place of their own. They were hoping to have a place ready by the time they graduated in the end of May. Morgan didn’t want to live in her home anymore; not when it felt so empty.
Morgan caught on to Amelia’s heart eyes as did Torunn. “Is she okay?” Torunn asked sincerely. Amelia was frozen, lost in her memories.
"Can we talk about how he's younger than the last one? How he's practically my age?" Harley chimed in. He was 26 and this Steve guy was 28.
“Their only child? Come on.” Jacob had a look of irritation on his face. “Anyways, I get home thanks to Amelia.” Amelia entered Jacob’s room in that moment, taking a seat by her boyfriend so she was visible on the screen.
Tony took a step back. He took a deep breath. He gave himself a mental pep talk. 'You got this Tony'. He pulled his shirt over his head. That was the easy part. Steve had seen his chest countless times. Steve was smiling sweetly at him. He reached for his shorts next. Should he pull the shorts down first and then his underwear or should he just pull them both down at the same time? Rip it off like a band aid right? Just pull everything down, he told himself.
“You look ravishing.” Stephen complimented Tony, giving him a kiss on the cheek. Tony led him in and over to the grand Christmas tree in the corner so he could add his present to all the others surrounding the tree. Everyone was asked to bring a gift for at least one other person on the guest list. They would be opening gifts together in the morning.
“I’d say you’re nearing your 8th week.” She announced.
Nathan was saddened at the memory. Today was the anniversary of that day; the one-year anniversary of the unfortunate day they lost their baby and Nathan remembered that he and Morgan wanted to get out of town for the day and have a small memorial to honour the child they could have had.
(See the end of the chapter for
He saw Peter fold his arms but remained quiet. “I don’t want to hear the argument about you turning 18 soon.” Steve spoke up. “I know but I don’t need to see whatever...” He gestured to them. “...was happening here.” Peter huffed.
“Rhodey.”
And within seconds, Nertha took his hand into hers, stating, “Right now.” Before disappearing with him into thin air.
Pietro was actually happy to be an Uncle soon despite his teasing towards their relationship in the past. He just could not give up the chance to mess with his sister whom he was 12 minutes older than. Then they talked about Cassie, and Wanda couldn’t help but ask if he was serious about her. Pietro confessed that they’d already been together for 5 months. He was very serious about her.
birthday was good. Vision and Wanda had even made an appearance. Steve accommodated them while they figured out living arrangements in New York. The young couple shared their future plans with Steve.
Bucky was embarrassed, his cheeks turned a light shade of red. “Right!” he apologized, taking the container from Steve and emptying its contents in a container of his own on his kitchen island. Steve never came over empty handed. It was just something nice his best friend liked to do. Steve was a good guy. Bucky cleared his throat again. “I’ve just been busy with –”
At the Christmas party, Clint, his wife Laura and Natasha were busy talking when Vision and Wanda joined them. The couple had just flown in to New York, from Scotland after many connecting flights.
“Mom,” he whined, “He’s not my boyfriend. I swear. We’re just friends.”
“You never really know Pepper...” Carol teased. The timing of villains was always so uncertain and varied as time progressed. “And if he’s only trying to help her figure out her powers, I don’t see why not?”
“It’s okay Tony. Just take care of Morgan. I’ll take care of the project.” Pepper assured him and Tony was forever grateful for her. The call ended and Pepper saw Carol enter the room; she was reminded of Carol's extended stay in her home. She thought back to the conversation they had three weeks ago when Carol snuck into her house at 4 am after the incident with Rhodey. It wasn’t until Rhodey had called the morning after that they’d talked about it.
“No.” Steve said. To what exactly, Wade wasn’t sure.
Story ideas come to me out of no where sometimes.
“Just wishing you luck babe.” He pecked Tony’s lips this time. “I hope everything works out for you.”
Steve ignored that. He didn’t need to dwell on a simple name change. “I didn’t want to interrupt your happy life.” He concluded, taking the items Tony was holding and leaving them in their original spot.
Gamora could agree. Those two were constantly trying to out-do each other but it made a good friendship. The three women laughed remarking at how easy their partners made it to poke fun at them.
“Pep, I see how torn up she is and it’s like I’m the one who had the miscarriage. I can feel her pain. It breaks my heart. She’s just a kid. She shouldn’t have to deal with something like this.” She can hear Tony’s voice break.
“Hm?” she hummed. She was getting a little ticked off with his silence. The last time she was genuinely angry at him was when he had teased her at the Christmas Party, by suggesting she wasn’t Steve’s and Tony’s biological child. He knew she was, but he just loved getting underneath her skin, in more ways than one.
“What is happening over there?” Michelle wondered. She stayed with Morgan, Nathan and Ned after Peter bailed on them and had just witness what was just the outskirts of a potential fight between Carol and Sif.
“You guys always baby me and I’m about to be 17 in two days.”
It was family dinner night at the Stark household. It was the first one in a long time that had Maria Stark in attendance and Tony was happy about it.
“I got it Tony. See you tomorrow honey. Tell the kids hi for me. Love you.”
“Besides Ned, Michelle, Wade and Shuri?” Tony listed while he packed away the stuff on the table. “Just me and your dad. Figured you’d tell everyone else whenever you’re ready. Didn’t want to spoil it.”
The doctors took the baby and got him fully cleaned off, weighed him, measured him and did all the necessary things. Bucky even cut the umbilical cord. It was so messy, so chaotic in that delivery room but the most beautiful moment in Steve’s entire life. Nicky was here, he was happy, and he was perfect. And he survived a shit pregnancy. Steve never really knew how greatly he loved this little life until he had him in his arms. Words couldn’t describe a mother’s love.
“My ex just moved out here with our daughter. She knows what I do for a living. Says she doesn’t want that stuff around Ellie. But I followed them here anyways.” That added hurt to injury. Not only was he a little sexually frustrated, jealousy was now coming to claim him. Why was he anyways? Wade would never be an option.
“You two do seem very happy.” Torunn added, before she hugged her in-laws.
He grinned, before answering. “I’m asking Kayla to squeeze us in sooner. She needs to check you again. She must have made a mistake.” Tony would argue that wouldn’t change anything but if that’s what Steve needed to finally accept the truth, then by all means… “A week from today.” He read out loud – Kayla’s response after a few minutes.
“That sounds like I’m going to be a fifth wheel.” Peter argued.
“I guess. It would be nice though…”
Tony was staring at him and remaining quiet. Steve only realized, when he focused on Tony’s eyes and his favourite orbs of brown were glistening…with tears. “Oh babe.” He whispered and Tony sniffled.
“You don’t need to apologize for anything.”
“What?” Anna spun around and narrowed her eyes at her. If she was faking innocence, she was really good at it because Morgan couldn’t tell if she was sincere or not in that moment. Anna was so confusing. She started to wonder if this was some weird power she had over people. She was just so hard to read at times.
“Of course.” She said, pulling out her pad of paper and writing up a prescription. “We need to get you started on prenatal vitamins in the meantime.” Tony hated the sound of that.
Thank you for reading! If you liked it, what was your favourite part?
Moments later, Tony joined her in the kitchen, the tray of his half-eaten breakfast in his hands.
“Nertha.” Thor said, simply. “She saw him leaving your room.” Torunn was still standing and Thor motioned for her to retake her seat. She obeyed, feeling like a child again.
Theirs was easily one of the greatest love stories ever told. A love like that was rare. Steve chuckled, holding Tony close once more after his tears had subsided. “So who’s officiating?” Tony wondered.
“We spend an awful amount of time right here.” Steve reminded him. His hand left Tony’s hip, fingers brushing over his sensitive half hard cock and settling between his cheeks. He pressed a single finger into the tight rim of muscles, able to feel the cum he had left in him only a few hours ago. “I spend an awful amount of time in
“Thanks.” Morgan accepted. “You know Dad, Mom’s single again…” Tony gave her a pointedly look.
“No. No.” Morgan shook her head. “I didn’t mean it like that grandma.”
“Wade is a guy that’s taken a liking to our son.” Tony provided, finally catching Steve up.
“Your presence is required in court next week. Everything else you need to know is on that paper. Good day, Mr. Rogers.”
“I think my parents knew.” Jacob put in. “And Aunt Pepper.” Amelia was nodding. “My mom was always so standoffish when it came to Aunt Nat. I honestly thought it was just her personality.”
“I don't.” Carol had to stop lying to herself. “Valkyrie and I are just getting to know each other.”
It was Mother’s Day, May 13
At the mention of his name, Harley entered the room with two containers of ice cream in his hand. “I brought pistachio because I thought of your eyes and –”
“I don’t want to go down for breakfast.” He whined. He was too tired to move, their baby boy was not making this pregnacy easy and having incredible morning sex didn’t help either. The only response Tony got was the sound of the shower running which seemed to lull him to sleep.
“Thank you.” She smiled, getting Tony something to wipe off his belly, after which they went back into her office. “So, I assume we’re moving forward with things…” She trailed off, if the grins on their faces was any indication.
“New in town. And no, not a hero. Just a killer,” he whispered and Peter finally took those much needed steps away from this guy, facing him now.
“Maybe we can sneak into SHIELD and...” Morgan trailed off, grinning at her.
“Getting your brains screwed out?” Steve smirked. Bucky’s cheeks turned red. “I know.” He provided, gesturing to his messy head of hair. Bucky attempted to smooth it out. Steve knew his best friend didn’t particularly like talking about sex while Sam was the complete opposite.
“So, we can have sex without a condom.” Peter said, with a bashful smile.
Excuse my errors please 😔 gonna review it again but I needed to post it. This was long overdue.
Tony and Tate sit up straight. Steve is hoping this will playout in his favor and the rest of the court waits patiently as the video starts to play. It’s a video that clearly shows Tony pushing Steve in the lake all those months ago. Tony walking away. And a four-months pregnant Steve struggling to get up onto the dock.
To get his mind off that, however, he decided to check his phone again and sure enough Steve had sent a text in response to his last.
Harley stared at the wall where his mother was projected moments ago prior to picking up his phone and sending a few text messages.
Pepper took a seat beside her and Carol turned her body around to converse with her. “So you and Valkyrie? You've never told me you liked women.” Pepper felt a bit wounded by the revelation. She thought she'd know this already since they were so close.
Being back in Kayla’s office was surreal. It brought back memories of Tony’s doctor visits from all three pregnancies; though the last time they were here for a doctor’s visit, things were awkward. Tony was only weeks off from his due date with the twins and he despised Steve for cheating with Natasha, so Tony only ever spoke to him if it was about the babies.
It was definitely not whatever. There was something off about Stephen Strange. Steve just hadn’t figured it out yet. Harley went to find breakfast and Steve went to Peter’s room next.
“No. I trust your instincts. Look into it.” Torunn responded, pressing a kiss to her fiancé’s lips.
“We lost her.” The head doctor explained. “I’m sorry.” Paige didn’t make it. And Peter was crying again. He knew his twin was no longer with him. Steve passed Peter to Tony as the doctors got Tony cleaned up. He held onto Peter, praying nothing would ever happen to him. Tony’s sobs prolonged whilst he held Steve’s hand for support. Neither Tony nor Steve got to hold or see Paige again before they took her away.
He was a little frozen in the spot. Tony was trying to process it all, repeatedly and each time he came up with the same thought. Steve hadn’t willingly cheated on him. He was chipped. Natasha was chipped. They didn’t know what they were doing, and Tony had always thought that when they said that, it was just another excuse. But it was the truth. Steve was faithful to him or at least tried to be on his own accord and Justin Hammer had successfully torn them apart. It took him 17 years to learn the truth because Justin wanted something he could never have. Him.
She made to walk away again, and Morgan grabbed her. Her palm ached but she would endure it if she could get the information out of Anna.
Peter bit his bottom lip. “I know.” He mumbled and Wade let him go, “I just hate being there – it doesn’t feel like home anymore.”
“I love you.” Steve breathed. Tony stared at him and remained silent. “I want you to know that you’re the only person I’ve ever loved.” He went on. “I knew what I had. I knew how lucky I was.” He was able to make out a light blush on Tony’s cheeks regardless of the poor lighting. “I would never mess that up.”
Stephen couldn't read his face. “Who are you texting?”
Remy collided with someone else however before he could get to the elevators. Anna was saved from a fall by Remy. He stared at her for a second too long, in awe of her and then suspicion.
“Thank you, your honor. Miss Potts, I understand that you were an active part of Mr. Rogers pregnancy.” Pepper confirms this. “And what was Mr. Stark’s part in the pregnancy?”
Steve was holding a small bundle when Tony found him. He could see an indisposed Sharon, resting on her hospital bed while the doctors got around to cleaning her up. Tony’s skin crawled. He shivered seeing all the blood, remembering his last delivery. They’d lost Paige and now they might be getting her back.
“See. I’m not exactly over her.” Michelle sighed, covering her face with both her hands. Peter reached out and patted her on the back, letting out a chuckle.
“Does dad know?”
“No. This is very serious. You’ve never dated anyone before. Like where is he from? How did you guys meet?”
“You’re beautiful, Tony.” Steve commented, pulling him into a hug. Tony was taken off guard. But his sobs ceased and he reciprocated the hug.
your powers from contact if you have any.” She scanned the room after she’d spoken, gauging everyone’s reactions. No one seemed bothered by it.
“Are you serious?” Jacob’s voice faltered.
“No?” he mocked her. “What happens when they tell Uncle Thor?”
“Steve Rogers, right?” There was a pause. “The ex-husband.” He jeered.
and Tony gave birth four days later, a week after his due date. When Tony went into labour, Steve had rushed to the hospital to be with him, learning about it from his mother-in-law, Maria. Tony was too far gone on anaesthetics and in pain to argue with Steve when he had asked him specifically to not be in the room when he had the twins.
He would be. He knew it. He had so much support. He just needed to get use to the idea of Tony not being there for him or the baby. And that was okay. He could do this on his own and SJ would never be in short supply for love.
Steve and Tony shared a look and Morgan caught that.
Hela backed away from the window, standing before them. She was dressed in green and black as per usual, a cape dragging behind her on the floor. She pushed her hair back, unfazed by it all. “Now brother. You should have realized. That woman had no good intentions. You can just smell the malicious intent on her.”
Wanda then invited them into her home. She directed them to place their gifts on the coffee table and Steve and Clint got their chance to hold William too. Vision served food and Wanda took pictures of everyone meeting William. She was making a scrapbook of memories for him so he could look back on his early years with his new parents.
Stephen laughed at his comment. “You know what I mean.”
Tony shot up. "It's my life. I love him. I know he loves me too and we're getting married." He paused, rubbing both hands in his hair, frustration rattling his head. "I've never be happier guys. Steve makes me happy."
Their relationship had been lacking in luster recently. Tony was putting all his energy into finding Paige. He’d even got a doctor on hand to do the DNA test once, they’d met their supposed daughter and if Stephen was feeling neglected because of that, Tony could understand but he wouldn’t be sorry for it.
Sharon struggled to get her front door open. She had a bunch of grocery bags in each hand and her keychain somewhere in between. She was returning home from the supermarket and the doctor's office for her check-up. Steve had come along. He’d been in attendance for every appointment thus far. She wanted him with her all the time, but this would have to do for now. He was very involved when it came to the baby considering his obvious hatred of the situation. Steve hadn’t hesitated to let her know, that he didn’t want a baby with her. He avoided her for the first couple of weeks and then some more after the incident with Morgan but since then, he was there for the baby. Sharon’s doctor appointments were the only times she saw Steve. He was going to be there for the baby, but never for her.
“Yeah, those guys are pretty cool.” Nathan explained and turned the page to reveal a group picture of the rest of the Kozlovs and himself. Nathan stuck out like a sore thumb among the red heads. There were even pictures of Nathan’s Grandpa Ross – Betty’s father, Thaddeus Ross. Nathan was big fan of his. Morgan reminded him that her parents weren’t, and neither was his dad.
“Miss Marshall isn’t done with the exam yet.” Steve tried to explain. He stood and found himself towering over Tony.
“Is it confirmed then that Amelia has mutant abilities?” Carol brought her attention back to the present.
But that wasn’t his only concern. Women died giving birth in the past. Growing up, death by childbirth was still a very common thing. And Steve dreaded the thought. Dreaded that his baby, would be left without any of his parents to care for him. Steve had ran that by Bucky and Sam a few times and he let them know that he wanted them to have and care for SJ if anything was to happen to him because Tony wouldn’t be an option. Sam and Bucky didn’t want to hear any of that. Sam reminded him that things were different now. The chances of him dying during childbirth were slim. He’d survive it. He’d live to see his son grow up. He’d be a part of his son’s life. SJ would have a parent that loved him so much. He’d be there.
“Who would have thought Harley would be the first to get married?” Peter added, laughter in his voice. Anna let out a chuckle. She’d already learned about her older brother’s reputation.
And Clint wanted to hurl.
“Look. We’ll never be friends.” Carol stated and Sif scoffed. So they were going to address the elephant in the room then. “But I do wish you both the best.” Carol complied. “I just don’t understand your hatred towards me. You got Thor in the end.”
“Here is fine.”
“What is it? A trick? A spell?” Nertha stopped him right there. She feigned a level of dismay only Nertha could.
Tony went to the nearest pharmacy. He ignored the prescription and decided to get them from off the shelf. They sooner he got back to work, the better. It would keep his mind busy and not filled with thoughts of the baby, for the most part. He could figure things out, later on. Preferably with Steve.
“I really don’t understand why you’re sleeping with her in the first place.” Sam took a bite into his sandwich. “And, I don’t know if you forgot Steve but you’re gay. Super gay.” He said the last two words slowly, like he was speaking to a child.
Jacob snickered as his best friend started the task of undoing his tie for the fifth time. “Are you nervous?”
“I know in my heart that baby is mine.” Stephen explained, taking a step closer, glancing down at his belly. “Yet, the news says you and Rogers are expecting a 5th child
“Good. The breakup was a little strange, but we’ve managed to remind amicable.” Jacob explained truthfully. He tried to sound positive, but Harley could see grief in his eyes.
When Tony finally looks at him again, there is fire in his eyes. His eyebrows are furrowed and his jaw is clenched. Then that fades in an instant because he’s gotten an idea. His eyes are fixed on Steve’s mid section, it’s still very flat but he can see a significant outline of a bump where his shirt is a bit tighter. How far along was he, anyways?
“I don’t know.” Stephen responded, his hands in his lap as he sat by Tony’s bed, watching the rise and fall of his chest. It was hard seeing him like this. Only Tony’s evident breathing could settle his mind; a reminder that Tony was still alive.
Tony sighed into the hug. He could always just relax in Stephen’s arms. It was nice. They pulled away a little and Stephen pressed his lips to Tony’s. Tony let out a little moan when Stephen’s hands were cupping his ass.
Morgan grew self-conscious. “Mom you’re not serious, are you?” She always thought she was the good child. All she did was have sex…and get pregnant… Surely that alone couldn’t have permanently soiled her reputation.
“Hi.” He whispered back. Then Wade let him down, staring down at Peter into those, stunning brown eyes.
“You two can’t be mad at your father forever.” Tony teased. They stayed silent.
“Peter.” Wade mimicked his tone. Peter almost had whiplash with how fast he spun around to face him. He knew his name too and then there was a little chuckle coming from the masked man before him.
Of course, Harley figured it out. He just didn’t expect him to get back to him for another few days. His first born seemed very pleased with himself and the moment he smiled Tony’s heart melted. Steve couldn’t deny Harley even if he wanted to. He was his twin.
It was the same song and dance every time they had this discussion and every time he pleaded his case, Tony wanted to fully forgive him. He always looked so sincere but actions always spoke louder than words.
“Mhm. I’m sure she’ll be back soon. You know Carol, she likes to blow off steam first.” Pepper reminded him.
“So having a dog was entertaining.” Wanda began, a drink in her hand and Vision by her side. “But we see everyone with babies.” She sang. “And we want one too.”
Jacob watched Harley with Nertha. He watched his best friend hang on to every word that Nertha said like it was the air he breathed; like a hopeless idiot. Jacob took that one back. Harley clearly had no control over the things he done pertaining to Nertha.
“When?” He questioned. He needed to know. He didn’t want to. It wouldn’t make the pain, hurt or heartache go away, but he needed to know.
"But I'm glad things happened the way that they did. I met you. And I couldn't be happier." Tony whispered, as he captured his lips into a intense kiss and his hands rested on Steve's belly, where their baby was growing. Steve had gotten pregnant on their first try and it prompted Tony to propose to him.
“I just really need some space right now.” The cliché line, Stephen knew it all too well.
“Yeah. You got me.” Stephen smirked, finally turning to look at the man across from him.
Peter and Anna’s 18th birthday was a difficult day for Tony. He cried like a baby all day leading up to the party, later in the night. He figured he was extremely emotional because of his pregnancy but it was so hard for him to let go of his youngest children. Steve had to remind him that they still had a year left of high school and neither intended to move out yet. Tony wouldn’t hear it.
“I’m happy knowing our baby isn’t falling deeper into depression. I know that road all too well and I don’t know what I’d do if she went into that dark place.”
“Aunt Carol and Uncle Thor use to date,” Harley answered, appearing out of nowhere behind Michelle. He was creepy like that at times. She gave Morgan a look as if asking why her older brother was so weird. Morgan shrugged.
Pepper smiled at her. She loved and cherished her and Calvin so much. They didn’t have a father. She’d been doing this all on her own. She always wanted kids but not necessarily with anyone else, so she went the route of getting inseminated, not once but twice. She often wondered to herself if she was putting her kids at a disadvantage by not having a second parent. But Amelia and Calvin were perfectly fine as far as she could see and Amelia was almost 18. She did it for almost 18 years and they never seemed to be lacking in anything, physically, mentally or emotionally.
“It’s my birthday. I’m allowed to be.” Tony reminded him and he received another kiss. “Go.” He pleaded because with each kiss, the more aroused Tony was getting, and he didn’t want Steve to be late.
“I don’t mind having girls fight over me.” Harley explained, winking at Michelle and she made a disgusted face. “I’ll wait,” he whispered so only she could hear. “Or whenever you’re ready,” he smirked.
Torunn and Harley looked on. That was a couple they never saw coming. Though they supposed, no one could have ever imagined that. They both knew Jacob was a good guy though and Nertha had good qualities. They could make each other happy if things worked out, regardless of their personalities and backgrounds and the 5-year age gap between them. And that was all the couple could ever really ask for, for Harley’s best friend and Torunn’s cousin. Everyone deserved happiness.
Anna nodded. “How’s house hunting?”
“First of all, no one showed up to the airport to get me.” Jacob started. Harley listened to his friend complain about his first day back home. They’d flew down for summer holidays, but Harley got home a week before Jacob did. He was projected from his phone on a holographic screen before him. Harley was down in his mother’s lab tinkering with Peter’s Iron Spider suit. Shuri had made plenty of improvements on it but Harley wanted to add a couple of things. Harley was the only one that was surprised indefinitely by the revelation – his little brother was Spiderman. Morgan had a hunch for a while.
“No. He or she isn’t. Tony’s carrying
Steve only became aware of Tony’s presence when his name had been spoken. A smile spread across his face as he registered the voice in his head. He couldn’t be happier holding his new-born and having the person he loved most here for him. His ecstatic blue eyes met Tony’s gloomy brown ones and Steve’s joy shattered, seeing the pained expression and unmissable wounds on his face. It was mostly bruised; only one particularly deep wound stood out on the side of his face and his eyes were red. It was clear to Steve that Tony had also been crying.
“How’d you think we felt, after you came along?” Harley added, a smirk on his lips as he was in a good place with his younger sister at this point. They’d move past the murder allegations.
. Dr McIntosh smiled even wider, when she saw something new compared to previous visits. “So that’s why you’re not trying anymore.”
“If I could go back and change things, I swear to you I would.” Steve whispered.
“Peter you're a smart kid. Tell me. What do you think a 28yr old wants with a 16yr old kid?”
Nathan pulled away so he could speak and shared his concerns with her. “I think Nat might be having an affair with Amelia’s dad.”
His mother was definitely getting up there in age. It wasn’t surprising she could have gotten things mixed up. But everything after the mention of Stephen was a never wavering philosophy, she held all her life about family. Family was everything to her. It’s why Tony made an effort to visit her as often as possible with the kids. It’s why he was finally having her moved in with him, even though she didn’t want to let their family home go.
“This. That. Everything. You and Rhodey.” Pepper and Rhodey had been there for him since before he met Steve, before they fell in love, before they started a family and eventually fell apart. They were the only two people that kept Tony grounded and pulled him through all the messes in his life whether he created them or not and Tony was forever grateful. He sat across from Pepper, before she spoke again.
“Thank you, sweetie.” Steve was glad they could move pass this. He didn’t like having her or any of his family against him.
“You two might as well pull out your dicks too.” Tony snapped, pausing his eating and glared at both respectively. “I’ll get a ruler.”
“Where is he anyways?” Steve hadn’t seen Pietro in years, since the Avengers split up. No one had really. Not even Wanda. It was just calls, texts and the occasional video calls. Never in person.
Tony sat at one end of the table with Steve at his side who pecked his lips quickly before getting up to make sure Brook was doing fine being held by Peter now. He watched their family interact, feeling insanely happy, thinking how much he really loved and appreciated everyone present. He looked over at his mother who was busy at the kitchen counter finishing up breakfast and all he could think in that moment was the one thing she always said,
“Says the person who got pregnant 4 months into their relationship.” Steve teased.
Nertha had never been more confused in her life.
“How’s he doing?” Peggy directed her question to the woman in charge, ignoring Steve’s presence all together. It was all just an act however, so no one would suspect that she was having inappropriate relations with him.
Peter overlooked the city as Ned talked off his ear. He pulled of his Spiderman mask and took in the night air. It was refreshing. It was peaceful and it made him happy. He found himself at peace following his revelation to his mother – not much of revelation, considering, he’d already known but, it was what it was. He hadn’t been genuinely happy since Wade left and after he and his mom had had that heartfelt conversation, Morgan had gotten back to her old self and all was well in the Stark Household again, he had nothing to complain about. Wade Wilson be damned. He just still couldn’t believe he’d actually left; left without even saying goodbye.
The next morning, Rhodey found their bedroom empty. He called and texted her but got no reply. He wasn’t expecting her to ghost him like that.
- Features more information about the Hammer investigation, among other things 😏
Protect and Avenge the earth.
Nat and Bruce had stopped by the Barton’s one weekend in September. Clint and Laura were possibly the only two people who weren’t against Nat after learning about her and Steve’s past. They let her tell her side of the story and tried to understand it all. And if Tony had forgiven her, they didn’t see why they should hold a grudge on his behalf. The four of them were seated out on the porch of Clint and Laura’s home. They could see Nathan, Lila, Cooper and Nathaniel out in the front yard while they had snacks and lemonade. School had been open for a couple weeks now and Laura who was a housewife welcomed the thought of being child-free again.
“I want to show you something.” Tony carried on. And he got up, standing fully clothed before him. “I want to show you me.”
And Merry Christmas 🎄 to all that celebrate!!!
A smack across his face, broke his thoughts. A smack from the person would had just given him the most intense orgasm in his entire life. Wade looked over at him in confusion.
“Yes. I fucking love you.”
Justin emerged from the rubbles that were the result of Tony’s last blast. He came out in a tailored suit, completely weapon-less and unharmed.
And Tony was melting away into it all as Steve squeezed him a little tighter and hugged him a little deeper. They stood there together wrapped in the embrace and for that moment, they were at peace in each other’s arms.
“Baby. I can’t move.” He whispered, caressing the side of his face. Tony held that hand and used the other to cradle his belly. “I’m going to come if you don’t release me…just a little bit.”
But then he felt as though he was giving up on his dreams. He wanted to get his degree and he wanted to be an active part of S.I. one day. Morgan would be the one running operations, but he had a few ideas to add here and there. Torunn, on the other hand was the crown princess of Asgard. It was her home. He couldn’t ask her to stay on earth but she wouldn’t want him to be unhappy on Asgard either. It was something they had to discuss further.
“But if mom is able to move on from it, I suppose I can try too.” Morgan concluded.
“Not a good time babe. I have to take care of Morgan.” Tony didn’t have time for Stephen right now or anything or anyone else really. He had to stay with his little girl during such a difficult time.
Carol took a deep breath and gave herself a moment to answer. “Valkyrie wants a baby. To complete our family, she said.” She giggled.
“You could always stay with me.” He suggested. Harley still lived on campus at MIT and Morgan had moved out of Stark Mansion weeks ago; Peter could do it too except that would mean leaving Anna behind.
“Is it now?” Tony asked. He might have sounded amused, but he was fuming on the inside because someone had managed to get pass his state-of-the-art security and infiltrated his home. He knew only a couple of people who could have possibly done that and they lived with him. “Disable the streaming.” Tony requested and Friday did just that.
“Crazy Lila Barton?” Jacob laughed just as much as Harley had seconds ago. “I wouldn’t even tell my enemy to date her and she isn’t single.” He paused. Harley stayed quiet, allowing him to continue. He wondered who manged to put up with her craziness. “She’s dating Kozlov.” Jaime Kozlov, Natasha’s nephew. “He’s her latest obsession. Amelia use to say she just has an obsession with blue eyes. Eyes that look like yours.” She clearly had a type.
.” He paused. “That must be your good parenting kicking in.”
As promised, Steve got one of the best lawyers out there. Nova Caffrey. One of the best in her field. She'd never lost a case. Steve hoped they’d win. He needed his baby and Nicky needed his mother.
“This is why I got inseminated.” Pepper protested. “I didn’t want to deal with any man.” Pepper was briefing Carol on what took place when Remy LeBeau showed up at his house and introduced himself to Amelia. The incident left Amelia to believe her mother had lied to her about her conception. Remy wanted to meet and talk so she gave him the benefit of the doubt and met her for coffee and talk, they did.
“Don’t start that with me Buck.” Sam countered. He turned the tap off and stepped out of the shower to dry off. Bucky was grooming his own hair when Sam, in all his nakedness began rummaging in their dresser draws for underwear. “She’s supposed to be Queen of Wakanda one day.” He found underwear and disappeared into their walk-in closet. “Maybe it’s a phase.” He concluded.
Rhodey then excused himself stating, “I have to go stop your mother from killing the Queen of Asgard,” to Jacob.
“I can’t. I got a thing-” Harley started. He was hooking up with some random girl later on and Tony could tell that’s why he’d be busy. His former player behavior must have been genetic because Harley was everything he used to be and more before he met Steve.
, she thought before she pulled up Tony’s medical records on the computer before her. They were updated minutes ago with the information collected from the earlier tests Tony had done.
Anna drew back and grinned at her. “It’s okay. I was – am your long-lost sister. How well could you have possibly known me?” Morgan was sure she skipped a breath. Why was she repeating the exact words Morgan had said to their brothers that one meeting they had had without her? Morgan would have been crazy to not find that a little bit suspicious but for her parents’ happiness, she tried to overlook it.
“What is it that he wants exactly?” Carol urged. The two women sat on one of her home’s balconies on patio chairs, cool drinks in their hands and sun hats and shades on. It was a beautiful summer day in July.
“I would hope not.”
Sharon finally halted her packing and turned to meet the blue eyes piercing into her soul. She felt like she had made a deal with the devil. They’d met a few months back as fate would have it and they decided they’d help each other out. After she’d gotten pregnant, she hadn’t seen or heard from him in months. She was 4 and a half months now. She thought Justin had forgotten the whole thing and she didn’t mind. She had gotten what she wanted.
Tony was surprised by the name. Morgan hadn’t called him that in years, but it made him smile. “Yes, my baby. I’m so happy.”
“What have you done to Amelia?” She started. Remy was taken back. He couldn’t have guessed that’s what she would say. He couldn’t read minds after all.
Steve put the book down for a second, he was scaring himself. He almost jumped out of his skin when he heard his doorbell ring. He remembered Bucky’s phone. Maybe Bucky had come back to get it. He threw the blanket off him and struggled to get to his feet, pulling his shirt that had ridden up to expose his belly, back down.
Steve collected Tony and led him into the room after everyone else but not before checking to make sure he was doing okay. Tony felt fine. Their children were just driving him up the wall at this point. For being, if not almost being adults they were terribly childish.
“They are.” He assured her. “It’s really badass, sis.” Anna smiled, happy to know she was in another family that accepted her even though her powers were so extreme.
“Congrats Gary.” Stephen spoke up before Justin did as he had planned.
Peter paused his washing, his hands still in the soapy water and gazed at Wade who was busy rinsing in the other sink. “Really?”
and something about it being
Harley could understand that. Aunt Carol was a ticking time bomb. He sighed, a thought flooding his mind. “You don’t think they’re still ‘
Nat greeted Bucky when he got to them, leaving the couple to have a moment.
Peter was smiling at his phone when Steve knocked at his door. “Come in,” he stated.
“Then trust me mom!” Peter cried. Why couldn’t his mother just trust him?
“You think they’ll ever get back together?” Carol wondered.
So, they quickly undressed. Once fully naked, Wade worked a finger into the tightness of Peter’s virgin hole to get him stretched enough to take him. Peter knew it was going to hurt as he bit his lips to deal with the ache a single finger had caused him, but he’d deal with it. Soon Wade set Peter down on all fours and spread his cheeks so he could see his pink puckered hole. Peer was impossibly tight, and he made quick work of eating him out and scissoring him open even more.
He glanced up to the bartender that was in on his little rouse. “Kids are a piece of work. You got kids?” he questioned, the bartender.
“It’s probably morning sickness.” Carol explained. Wanda would have never thought that. “That’s every pregnant person’s excuse when they’ve just discovered they’re pregnant and they’re not ready to let everyone know yet.” She clarified.
“Nertha.” Morgan informed her father. Steve focused on her while she elaborated further. She hadn’t addressed him directly in weeks. “Why was it, again?”
“I should get going actually.” Stephen started to rise from the barstool.
Just then Friday’s voice came ringing in his ear. “Stephen Strange is at the front gate, Sir.” Oh, right on cue.
“I’m sorry.” Jacob responded, sincerely, his hands returning to its normal state.
“You don’t think Tony can handle it?” Pepper took offense. She was raising Amelia on her own and unbeknownst to them, she was pregnant again. Tony could take care of his kids and they’d be there for him if need be.
“Mr. Rogers’ Medical Records.” Tate explained to the room. “Mr. Rogers has been on a countless number of drugs for mental illness. Some doctors may even say this much, must be addictive.”
“Dad, can I ask you something?”
He didn’t need to hear his 17-year-old daughter talking like this. He glanced at his wife and she looked just as concerned as he was. Laura tried to get Lila to calm down. He had struck Harley with an arrow, just minutes ago. He was getting bandaged up by Bruce and Tony as they got their stuff together to go home. Harley would be fine.
“Franklin.” Franklin Richards. Susan Storm and Reed Richards’ son and Winter’s best friend, who also happened to be one of the few children at her school with enhanced abilities. “He just got a sister.” She stated and then after a moment, “It can be a brother though, I won’t mind.”
"Harls." Steve responded, steadying his beating heart.
“I guess I shouldn’t mention your twin that didn’t make it at birth then.” Tony chimed in.
Steve watched his younger kids interact before he called out to Morgan. “Can you two make up now, for my sake?” He gestured to his girls. Morgan gave him a bright smile and rose from her seat to get to Anna. She had no problem apologizing when in the wrong. She could accept when she was wrong, and it was clear, her father was trying to move on from this so she wouldn’t hinder the process any longer.
Wade proposed that Tony was becoming more acceptable of their relationship and maybe saw him as family. Tony would beg to differ if asked. Peter asked Wade not to push that idea any further.
“Tony, need some help here.” Rhodey cried out, breaking Tony’s thoughts. He was struggling with preventing the giant armour from crushing him with one of its metal feet. Tony channelled all his anger into defeating the giants once Friday had located the source of their power. He flew past the armours easily infiltrating Justin’s power source and destroying it. The armours all collapsed leaving a frustrated Justin in the middle of it all.
Wade.
“Yes Tony, you did the right thing. The guy was what? Almost 30?” Pepper started. Tony nodded. “I would have done the same thing had it been Amelia or Calvin.”
“I just don’t want to hurt anyone.” That she would swear forever but it didn’t change a thing.
“That sounds like the early stages of a relationship.” Pepper teased. Carol got quiet. It did sound like that. "You're starting to remind me of Steve and you-know-who."
Maria continued. “Howard and I had tried for years.” Morgan could see she was reflecting on the memory. “We got so lucky with Tony. So so lucky.”
“Yeah. I love Nertha. I love her so much.” He was pulling on his jacket and stuffing his phone in the pocket.
That wasn’t impossible. He could shoot webs from his wrist. His mom was Ironman. His uncle Thor was an actual god. Wanda was dating Vision, an intelligent machine personified. Aunt Carol could shoot laser blasts from her hands. It wasn’t impossible that Wade could read minds. Peter just hadn’t read any mention of it in his file. And in an afterthought, he wondered if Wade could hear what he was thinking in this moment.
“I just never expected to see you again.” Steve confessed.
“Oh.” Justin began. “You still don’t know.” Tony could see him searching for something in his pockets. “Chips. I planted chips on Steve and your little Russian friend. The redhead.” He explained, nonchalantly. He retrieved a remote from his pocket, pressing a button and deploying hundreds of gigantic suits of armour. Rhodey pulled out his guns and Tony stared at Justin.
Brooklyn Grant Stark-Rogers was 3 months old today. Brooklyn for where Steve was from and Grant because of his own middle name.
“Told you.” He boasted. Wade’s cooking was almost as good as his father’s. And Peter was left thinking about what had happened last month at his mother’s brunch party. He and Morgan were having a hard time forgiving their dad and Aunt Nat for all the pain they caused their mother. They were always the most protective of their mother. Harley was just left in shock when he heard about it.
“Where are my manners?” He caught himself. “Remy LeBeau.” He stated, handing her one of the cards. Amelia hesitated for only a second before she let the card pass from his fingers to hers. She wasn’t aware that the man before her was subtly influencing her actions with his powers. He watched her carefully gauging her reaction. He saw a small spark flash by within her green eyes and she was none the wiser, flipping the card over to examine it closer. It was a black heart. Nothing special about that.
So, I have this idea for writing a spin-off/prequel of this story but the focus is on Sam and Bucky. If you ship them, would you guys read it?
Stephen’s tongue had slipped pass his lips and was searching his mouth when Morgan’s voice forced them to pull apart. “Geez mom. Get a room.”
Morgan was a little caught off by the question. She tried to put the incident behind her, but she supposed Stephen had just been recently caught up with it all. “I’m great. Much better.”
Notes:
“No elbows on the table please.” Winter explained. That was something Morgan would say at her age. Steve apologized and quickly removed his elbows from the table. He missed his kids at that age and if he was being honest, he wouldn’t mind having another kid. Just not with Sharon Carter.
“It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through.” Morgan began. “To think that we’d created a life and then it was taken from us…” She trailed off. Her eyes were getting a little wet. “But I know I’ll get through this.” She remembered her grandmother’s words. “Because I have so much love and support from my family and friends.” Amelia and Torunn both joined her in a hug.
Or any couples you'd love to read more about? I am open to suggestions. I love this canon-divergent universe that I've created so far 🥰
“I guess that’s his Karma.” He responded.
- We get to see Steve's reaction
Peter had overslept for the most part. He stayed up most of the night with Wade just talking and having a good time. Wade would never touch him. The most he ever did was hold his hand. He wouldn’t even return the kiss on the cheek Peter gave him last night. He was sticking to his word and as much as Peter admired and appreciated that, he was getting a bit frustrated at this point. Was he really going to wait almost 2 years before they did anything? He needed to let Wade know that he didn’t have to. He would never tell.
That caught Tony off guard. “You offered to be a surrogate?” he wondered, keeping his eyes on him.
Where was his other half?
“Hope it’s nothing too serious.” Wanda worried, staring after Pepper as she went back into the house with Gamora to get more platters of finger food. The women were seated on one of her balconies around an outdoor table with matching chairs and a large umbrella for shade above them.
“I’m trying to talk some sense into him. I really am.” Pepper explained. “But you can take him to court you know that.” She held Steve’s hands as she spoke. “You can’t force him to be a part of the baby’s life but you can get financial support. He has to take care of the baby.”
“According to these results–” She turned the monitor around so he could see, “–you’re very much pregnant, Tony.”
“Your name doesn’t sound familiar.” Amelia concluded, handing the card back to him. The spark was there again. She folded her arms over her chest not amused by whatever it was this man was trying to achieve.
“But we can’t live apart.” She reminded him. “I’ll speak to my parents.” She really had no issues with giving up her crown if it meant she could be with Harley and be happy together.
Stephen then sat on the bed by his thigh, resting his hand on that area. “So, you weren’t with Steve?’ he asked.
“No one else is in the building, since Mr. Rhodes left earlier Sir. Your mother, Peter and Torunn are the only other people here.” Friday answered. Good. So no intruders had gotten in but it still didn’t explain why Morgan was bleeding.
Steve bent over to pick him up and his jacket fell open, putting his mid-section on display. “You’re pregnant.” Tony realized. Steve glared at him. The first words he’d said to him in two years. Why was his pregnancy a surprise? Did Tony expect him not to move on?
Harley moved into the guesthouse a day before Peter and Anna’s 18th birthday by himself. Torunn wouldn’t be joining him for at least another week. She still had a few duties that required her constant presence on Asgard and Harley could deal with that knowing they’d be spending the rest of their lives together after she had joined him.
“Anna’s sleeping with Remy.” Peter blurted out, because this was the only piece of information that tied Anna to Remy and though he’d promised to not repeat this to anyone, Peter was starting to doubt his twin’s intentions. “And it’s a proper relationship.” He let the information be processed by his siblings. Anna had mentioned she and Remy were serious about each other, stating that they’d starting dating after running into each other at the Christmas party last year.
“I’ll take you to him.” She provided, extending her hand out to Winter. She grabbed it eagerly, waving goodbye to her parents. Bucky was fine with that. Sam was a bit on edge.
Peter spoke first. “Mom,” he said it slowly. “This is Wade...Wilson.” Tony got an eyeful of Wade’s face. He stared for a while before he addressed Friday.
Tony stayed silent for a few minutes, staring back at Steve.
“Please leave.” Tony added, coming out from behind Steve. He didn’t want to have to deal with this right now. He just wanted to crawl back into bed with Steve and forget about this mess. Eventually, Stephen left.
“Mom’s the nicer parent.” Peter added. They rode the elevator down to the home theatre and were greeted by their group of friends. Everyone was so welcoming to Anna. She felt right at home.
“Why do you think that is?” Carol voiced, thinking of her heartbroken son. Almost a month later and Jacob was still having a hard time getting over the break-up.
“Yes. Even better than our wedding party.” Sif had to admit, and it left her with thoughts of their engagement. They were lucky enough to have known each other prior. Not many arranged marriages started that way. Most people were complete strangers to each other. Their daughter and future son-in-law were another rare case. Though not their ideas, Sif and Thor wanted to believe there was some attraction and/or feelings involved that sprouted their night together after Torunn’s 18
Tony was sitting with Steve in his living room. They were cuddling under a blanket while a movie played before them. Steve had his hands wrapped around Tony’s waist circling his belly button every now and then. Steve was glad to say he knew 90% of Tony’s body. He knew everywhere but between his legs and even though he found it a little strange at times, he respected Tony’s wishes because he just wanted him to be happy. He just always made it work.
“But it would be good for the babies...having both parents in the same house.” Peter chimed in.
Peter dared to roll his eyes. “Okay. What about when she isn’t here?” Wade struggled to find an answer. His hold on Peter’s waist loosened. “Did I do something wrong?”
“We can’t ask her that, Morgan. I wasn’t even supposed to tell you guys about her relationship.” Peter protested, placing a hand on Morgan’s wrist. Morgan flinched. Peter noticed and he pulled his hand away. “You okay?” Peter worried.
“Ellie’s here.” He responded, coolly.
“You should go.” Torunn said, finishing her cup. And Harley tried to hide it, but he could not deny how hurt and used he felt. It didn’t feel good being on the receiving end of a one-night stand. He wondered if this was how he made every girl he’d ever slept with feel. It made him feel so much better about changing his life around, but he was starting to think he was growing feelings for Torunn. Clearly, she didn’t feel the same. He got up out of her bed and saw her blush before averting her eyes, providing him with some privacy so he could dress. Once he was fully clothed, he made his way out of her room, closing the door slowly and quietly behind him.
“That’s awesome,” Peter added, getting up to leave. “And don’t forget we’re staying at Dad’s this weekend.” That’s right. It was Steve’s weekend with the kids. Since the divorce, every second and fourth weekend of the month was appointed for the kids’ time with Steve and he was able to see them any other time that was convenient to everyone. Tony wanted the divorce to be as mess-free as possible and so he never went to court for any custody hearings regarding the kids and Steve didn’t fight it either.
“Baby? Why didn’t you tell me about Hammer?” He was helping him to his bedroom.
“Yeah. That can’t be easy.” Bruce noted and Nat snuggled closer into him. They stayed quiet after that until moments later, Bruce whispered something by her ear.
“It’s okay.” Steve assured them. “I’m good. After all these years I feel free and able to talk about this freely.” It wasn’t a burden anymore.
It was the first week in April. Morgan’s birthday was on the 26
e, leaving the conversation with Anna and Morgan. At that point they knew they needed to talk to Anna
Tony narrowed his eyes at her, and his jaw tighten. “More speculations.” He said putting everyone’s eyes on him and Anna saw both her parents dishing out the same look, a look specifically for her. It’s like they were saying,
“You don’t think Winter is T’challa’s, then?” Sam wondered.
“Mom. Dad. I’m your daughter. You know that.” Anna pleaded, hugging her mother. Tony embraced her, willingly. She had to be their little girl. There was too strong of a connection on his part. She had to be because he wouldn’t know what to think anymore if she wasn’t.
“Show off.” Tony remarked. He would give Stephen a chance because why the heck not. They were both single and lonely and everyone deserved a special someone. The name would take a while to grow on him though. It was way too close to comfort.
Just a heads-up if the format of this chapter looks any different compared to others, I've been on vacation and have been subjected to typing on my phone.
Wade:
“Maybe there is an affair going on.” Morgan put forward, covering her mouth with one of her palms as she thought about the situation. “Maybe they have some history.” Some history her and her brothers didn’t know about, but “Anna might know about it.”
“Cum babe. Cum.” Steve told him, before he took the cock all the way down his throat again. Tony released and Steve savoured the taste while he swallowed all of it. Once Tony had finished spending himself, Steve removed his fingers and put them in his mouth to taste his favourite part of Tony all while Tony watched him.
Tony scoffed. Was he serious right now? “And who is right for me? You?” he grilled him. He was hysterical. “I don’t think I want to be cheated on again.” Why couldn’t Tony ever get pass this?
“What? No. That’s none of his business.” Tony rolled his eyes for the second time in their conversation. “Look baby. Thanks again for helping with the model. I’ll talk to you later. Love you” and he hung up before Harley had a chance to respond.
Morgan liked Betty. And it didn’t take long for Betty to warm up to her too. She liked Morgan a lot. She asked about her every time she and Nathan spoke and dotted on her every chance she got. She even went out of her way to let Steve and Tony know how good they did at raising her. Morgan always beamed when she heard that. She was happy to make her parents proud. Someone had to because Harley wasn’t and maybe Peter was trying.
“Exactly. Why would she be sneaking around?” Harley wondered.
Steve heard the toilet being flushed and the sink running. “They’re your kids when they hurt their mother.” He taunted. “My kids would never do that.”
” Tony whispered, extending a hand. Did he trust him? They’d only known each other for a matter of minutes; but strangely enough, he did. Steve did trust him.
“I didn’t know she was gay.”
Luckily, with each thrust the pain lessens and he starts to enjoy it, only to have Tony cum inside him and pull out right after, leaving him very unsatisfied. And Steve tries not to think about it because, at least they’re making progress and Tony might want to be a part of SJ’s life.
“Tony, when was the last time you went out?”
Morgan was not satisfied, however. “Anna –”
Harley took another second to admire her before he put his plans into action. He glanced around the room, combing through the faces of the guests before he located Clint and Laura. They were what seemed to be dozens of people away. “You wanna hang out somewhere else?” he suggested. The further they got away from the Bartons’ view, the better. Harley had put his hand out so Lila could wrap her hand around it. She took it and they made their way out of the party.
“25 years in my field and I…” They heard Kayla mumble in a disappointed tone.
They kissed. “Surprised to hear you say that.” Natasha baited.
Guys. I cried a little writing some of this.
“I told him to stay away from her.”
Was it possible for a person to love two people the same way? Pepper had thought about it a lot while Carol had made herself at home for the past 3 weeks. She was helping herself to everything in her home, from her food to her clothes. She was in a suit of Pepper’s pyjamas right now as a matter of fact. Carol had no desire to go back home for clothes if it meant seeing Rhodey so soon, at the time. She was ashamed, humilated and disappointed in herself for falling for someone else when she was already happliy married.
“Father you cannot be serious.” She tried again. It had to be a joke. She can’t marry Harley, of all people.
“Yeah.” Carol agreed. “We should all go.” And that gave everyone the push to move off and head out. Even Tony, Stephen, Morgan and Peter headed inside. Morgan and Peter were sharing a knowing look. They’d have to tell Harley.
“I didn’t think you cared.” Stephen said honestly but his words were a little slurred. He was still recovering.
“Nat what are you doing?”
“I’m good for now.” Jacob assured him. “Look, today’s your day.” He walked over towards the door, opening it and about to step outside. “And we have to go.” He pointed a thumb out the door. “Don’t wanna keep your future wife waiting.”
Wade noticed Peter was playing with his food. “You okay?”
“Mom.” She responded in the same voice, but she also sounded delighted. “I’ve only just got you and Dad back and I would love if you guys got back together and stayed in the same house but it’s your life. None of us are babies. What you do in your love life shouldn’t matter to us.”
“Missed you.” He mumbled into her hair.
“Don’t start a fight you can’t finish, Strange.” Steve warned him. He would never stand a chance in a room full of Avengers. And Stephen considered leaving until he was being held by someone from behind with what felt to be a knife pressed firmly against the veins in his throat. The person’s other uncovered hand sent shockwaves of pain throughout his body.
"And after that? Before Daniel?" His third husband.
“Couldn’t let you win, little brother.” She smirked, heading in the direction of their mother. No, no she couldn’t. She always had to win. Good to see the old Morgan was back, however.
Stephen gave him the once over, scoffed and turned his attention to Tony –completely ignoring Steve’s words. “Tony.” He breathed out and Steve’s face hardened. “Can we talk?” He went on, glancing up at Steve as he said the next word. “Privately?”
Steve nodded and retreated to the bathroom. He re-emerged in a second however, to toss Tony a robe. Tony slid it on and tried to make the bed look presentable. He spotted Steve’s discarded clothes on the floor and he kicked them under his bed. Tony wasn’t ready to tell their kids; they were getting back together. They only just had sex. Accidentally. A couple times. But still accidentally, of course. He passed by a mirror and saw the horrid state his hair was in and tried to smooth it out.
Tony embraced him back and placed a small kiss to his forehead. He would never admit it put he had favourites when it came to his kids.
“Only using me for my food, I see.” He feigned hurt while Tony nodded to emphasize the sincerity of his words. Steve laughed though before heading out the room.
“Johnathan Doeran?” Tony tested out the name. He was surprised Stephen could even remember a name and what type of name was that? He might as well call himself… “John Doe.”
“Yes. I just don’t want to talk about it right now.” Tony explained and then he mouthed ‘after’ at him.
“Aunt Natasha has a son.” She blurted out. Silence again. Everyone knew Nat couldn't have kids and even if she did, what would that have to do with them? "With Dad." Anna finished, staring directly at him, who looked away searching for Natasha in the crowd of guests.
Then Sif greeted Harley. “Welcome Harley. Let’s get you settled in.” They’d see to it that Harley was well taken care of. It could never compare to how well Tony and Steve cared for Torunn in their own home, all these years, but it was a start. Any of the Stark-Rogers children would always be welcome on Asgard.
When they arrived, Sif gave her a brief hug and Thor offered her hand to Harley literally and figuratively. He was giving his daughter away. Harley unveiled her and Morgan held onto her bouquet for the duration of the ceremony.
Tony tried to conceal a smile, thinking of the use of the word
Steve smiled sadly. “And I’m here for you Steve. Whatever you need. I’m here.”
“I couldn’t give up my one chance to be a mother,” Natasha confessed. She was convinced she couldn’t even get pregnant so carrying James was a miracle for her and though not ideal circumstances, she always wanted to be a mother. Of course, she realized quickly after having hers and Steve’s son in Russia, that things couldn’t work out the way she wanted them to. So, out of respect of Steve and Tony’s marriage as she loved to claim, and her upcoming life of being a superhero drawing near, at the time, she gave her sister full custody of her red-haired, blue-eyed baby boy. “But things didn’t work out.”
“Justin Hammer.” Rhodey provided. With the mention of the name, memories of Justin Hammer resurfaced in Tony’s mind. So that’s the
Harley came home for Easter a few days later. He’d heard from his parents what had happened to Morgan. He’d sent her a couple texts and called once or twice to send what condolences he could, but nothing beat in-person conversations. That’s why Morgan was the first person he went looking for when he arrived at Stark Mansion, after his mother’s smothering of course.
Steve wasn’t fazed by it though. He knew he’d be afraid too if he wasn’t society’s definition of normal. But fuck all that. Normal was overrated. “It’s okay. Just no more secrets, okay?”
Tony placed one leg over the other and leaned back in his seat, arms folded behind his head. “Never better.”
Steve gave him the once over, his eyebrows furrowed and his jaw clenched. He just couldn’t stand him. “What game are you playing here?”
Natasha interrupted her. “Hey. It’s okay.” She promised. “I know how much you care for your parents, as you should.” Given the situation, she would not expect anyone to react any differently, especially Morgan Stark Rogers. “But just know that all is forgiven, Morgan. We’re okay.”
. Tony’s mind wondered. He had hurt Stephen...
Tony was getting himself a handful of grapes when he responded. “You guys know I can’t cook to save my life.” Newly 45 as of the end of May and he still couldn’t cook. Why would he need to though? He was Tony Stark. “Your grandmother cooked right before she left for her book club earlier.”
“Uncle Steve has essentially moved in,” Torunn informed her. They all knew Steve had “moved in” so he could be there for Morgan, but they’d feed into any gossip if it got Morgan’s mind off things. “Maybe they’re rekindling their relationship.” Torunn suggested.
“Just stopped by to make your mother breakfast – in bed.” Steve half-lied. Morgan wasn’t buying into it though.
“Baby. I forgot. It’s family dinner night with the kids…and Steve…I forgot that we scheduled our date for tonight.” Tony admitted.
Tony was on the fourth floor of his home admiring what had become of the preparations for his Annual Christmas Party. It was 3 weeks away and Tony had to admit it was his favourite time of the year because all his former Avengers teammates and their own families would be there, just like one big extended family.
Peter sat on his bed first as Tony got into a sitting position. Peter placed the tray of food on the bed side table and hugged his mother before he ruffled his light brown hair. “Good morning, mom.”
, he thought as he went to his kitchen to fetch them both something to drink. Tony declined and asked for water instead. Steve wondered if he was sick. Tony wasn’t known to pass up on a drink.
Pepper had learned that Remy LeBeau was a cold and calculated individual from the two full conversations she had had with him thus far. He listened, watched, and learned before he acted. He also stayed true to his word by only focusing on Amelia. Pepper caught him one day when he’d stopped by to pick up Amelia. A thought had been floating around in Pepper’s mind that she was eager to know the answer to.
“No. It’s really quiet tonight –” Peter began before his spider senses went off and he felt a presence behind him. He turned around and came face to face or rather; face to crotch - with some guy in a red and black suit. “Well, hello to you too but my eyes are up here” the guy sang, looking down at Peter.
When the dinner commenced, the room was mostly quiet. His children only spoke amongst each other and with their grandmother.
“I think we have a couple more years in us.” The Super Soldier Serum would do that.
“Anna. Please let him go.” Tony begged. Anna pulled the knife along further.
Harley:
Morgan gave her a pointedly look.
“I’m not a baby. Mommy says I am 2 and half.”
Steve had opted out of visiting Peggy in the hospital to go to Sam and Bucky’s place instead. Sam was out grocery shopping – one of his favorite pass times. He and Bucky were sitting on the carpeted floor of Winter’s playroom. She’d just run out the room to get two more cups for the tea party her papa and Uncle Steve were now a part of. She had a lot of dolls packed neatly around the room, several doll houses, lots of artwork on the walls and even a TV and play station system for when she played games with her dad. All her dolls had one thing in common. She enjoyed doing arts and craft and from the day she could hold a paint brush between her fingers, she painted every single doll’s left arm in the shades of her papa’s metal arm. She liked to call them collectively, her Winter Army.
“And she’s okay with that?” Jacob asked but Harley stayed mum, admiring his charmingly good looks. Jacob shook his head. “Yeah, okay I’ll be sure to let her know.” He didn’t believe for second that Torunn really knew and if she did, there was no way on Earth
“Sorry, for bringing it up.” Steve apologized.
It took her a minute to process what he’d said and what it all meant but, when it did, her eyes widened with the initial disbelief. Natasha Romanov had a son. A son that she now realized was in attendance at hers and Peter’s party. It wasn’t hard to figure out who it was and who the father was with even that little bit of information. It wasn’t rocket science. So, a smirk grew on her face.
“What’s your mom saying?” Wade questioned.
“I’m not sure, Sir.” Friday explained.
Morgan turned one on the 26
They talked for a while with Azari and Winter lingering close by and soon Michelle and Ned joined in on the conversation. Peter’s phone went off. It was Wade and he excused himself, disappearing into the party.
“I came more than you last night.” Tony began, “Let me try to even the score.” He straddled Steve’s lap, but then laid his head against his chest before he surprised Steve by slipping under the sheets. Tony stopped between his thighs, giving his erect cock head a peck. Steve moaned while Tony slobbered over his dick and fondled his balls. A couple hard sucks later and Steve came in his mouth. Tony didn't let a drop go to waste.
“Stephen’s.” And Steve full-on laughed, like it was the funniest thing he’d ever heard. Tony stayed mum allowing him to settle down and eventually process the fact that Tony was not joking at all.
“Mom?” Peter called out again.
“Yes?” Stephen quoted.
“What?” Tony faked shock, his tone was sarcastic. “No.” he sang that. “I had no clue.”
“She’s our long-lost sister. How much could we possibly know?”
“Anna hates tech.” Morgan remembered, and she sat up straighter.
Since Thor’s announcement, Torunn had been on edge and could only resort to her Uncle Loki for some sort of assistance with persuading her father. She could not marry Harley. She couldn’t.
Morgan concluded that Nat might have been the one who killed Hammer and Remy must have been the other person at SHIELD the night it happened, that’s how he must have found out what Nat was doing. Natasha was after all, the one who was determined to pay Hammer a visit but never followed through.
“Ba–” He stopped himself from calling him any terms of endearment. They weren’t there yet. “Tony, I really hope she’s out there.” He really did.
“Me too.” He whispered.
“We find Paige.” Tony decided, pulling back from the comforts of Steve’s arms. He wouldn’t let him forget that they might get Paige back, but Steve felt his mind inflating with worry. He wiped his eyes, before meeting Tony’s.
Tony’s dry laughter cut him off. “What are you insinuating?”
In typical Asgardian fashion she was at that young age where she could start looking for a potential husband. Torunn wanted nothing to do with that. But tradition was tradition. Not even Asgard’s King could change that. “I can say I am not too excited about that.”
“I think Fury should start investigating us. All of us. Everyone is a suspect at this point.” Carol concluded. Nat stared at her questionably.
A conversation progressed among them until Friday’s voice rang clear in Tony’s earpiece forcing him to abandon the group. “Remy LeBeau is here, Sir.”
“Is it working?” he played along. Natasha smiled and he finally met her eyes.
They stared at each other for a long moment. Tony's eyes seemed lost, his vision blurred with tears of joy until he focused on Steve’s erection, jutting out to the side in his pants. He really wanted to return the favour. Instead, he pulled his pants and underwear back up – he had to get dressed to ride the elevator up to his room. They weren’t home alone after all. In fact, that blowjob was already quite the risk.
He continued to eat in silence until he realized, Steve was still sitting there staring at him. “Don’t you have work?” He sassed. Tony didn’t. He’d taken the day off for his birthday as per Steve’s orders. Otherwise he’d be at S.I. with Pepper.
“Do tell.” She begged him. “What do you know about her, that I don’t?”
Anna and Remy were inseparable but luckily, Remy wasn’t living with them. Anna and Peter would graduate at the end of the month and then Remy and Anna would be relocating to a country in Europe to do what they did best - working as hired assassins. They were in no rush to marry or have kids yet. Remy liked to remind her that having Amelia Potts as a daughter was more than enough.
“Of course, I'll wait for you," Peter humored him. Wade helped him clasp the necklace from behind.
from those four.
Steve could tell he was trying to make himself feel better. Soon, Sam joined them also wearing a robe. “Hey man. I didn’t know you were coming over so early.”
“I have to get to the funeral baby.” Tony released himself from his hold and straighten his clothes. “See you later.” He added, before walking out Stephen’s hospital room.
Maria sighed. That was typical Tony behavior. He was always acting way too grown up. She warned him, he’d be attracting unwanted attention. What she didn’t know however, was that was exactly what he wanted. Oh how she wanted to preserve Tony’s innocence.
Peter Benjamin Stark Rogers. And just like that they were fathers before Father's Day.
me in that exact spot. It just reminded me of it.” Morgan whispered. She looked spooked out.
“If I knew you were going shopping, I’d come help you with the groceries.” Came a voice in the darkness. Sharon shrieked and dropped everything. She searched for the nearest switch. Her living room flooded with light and sitting all poised and perfect on her couch was Justin Hammer. All blonde hair and blue eyes staring back at her.
Tony looked up at Steve who was smiling from ear-to-ear. That was their baby, Tony was carrying. That was their baby. They both sighed and Steve pressed a tender kiss to Tony’s forehead. “I told you.” He whispered, cheekily.
Pepper almost fainted, if Amelia didn’t have his powers she’d probably be seriously injured or worse…
“Pete.” He spoke when he finally opened the door and let his son in. He guided him to the two seats by his fireplace, that weren’t facing the bed. “What’s up, honey?”
Steve chuckled at Bucky’s realization and it made him think back to their younger days when Bucky was clueless on anything pertaining to sex and he never cared for it or relationships because he was certain he’d always be single; having a metal arm, brainwashed into killing thousands of people and all. But Sam looked pass all that. It didn’t happen overnight of course, but they fell in love and Sam was, essentially his first everything. “What did the doctor say?” Steve clarified.
looks at me?”
“We can do it again when Harley is here for Spring Break next month,” Tony finally spoke. Maria emerged from the kitchen again and they were able to start dinner.
She got interrupted by an irritated Steve, who shook her hand off in the process. “Will you just stop?!” He was loud enough to draw by-standers’ attention, and he quickly apologized. “Look, I’m sorry for being so awful to you especially right now after you’ve just lost your aunt. I haven’t been fair to you and I apologize. I will be there for our daughter, but I need you to understand Sharon that I can’t be with you.
We are wrapping things up. Thanks for sticking around, whoever stuck around ♥️
Tony sat at the kitchen island and Peter knew to join him there.
Bucky was infuriated.
I am lucky enough to not be a mother yet :)
Tony without a second thought, hugged him. This haunted him for years and now he was free. “It doesn’t make you a bad person. You have every right to feel this way. You get to finally move past this.”
Remy gave her the once over. “You look nothing like any of them.”
He smiles up at Tony as he hovers over him but Tony doesn’t return it. Instead he’s kissing him again, one hand around his neck. Steve can feel him squeezing too hard and then the other hand is there, squeezing even harder. Tony pulls away from the kiss and he’s angry. Steve is clawing at his neck, trying to get Tony to stop. Because he can’t breathe and if he can’t breathe then neither can the baby and he can’t let his son die. But Tony doesn’t stop, he’s very determined. Tony is going to kill him. SJ is going to die. He’ll never get to see his baby’s face. He’ll never get to hold him and the last face he’ll get to see before he dies, is that of the man he loves. Maybe it’s not so bad. Maybe.
The court room is quiet while the video plays and Tate acts quickly. Tony is paying him way too much and screwing him way too good for him to lose this case. Tony Stark really was that good in bed.
“You’re really close. Way too close.”
Sam and Bucky were still in Wakanda so he knew they wouldn’t be attending. Then Sharon had tried to insert herself into his birthday celebrations, but he had to remind her, they didn’t need to interact if it had nothing to do with the baby. Otherwise, his 41
“Must be a pretty big gift if you guys kept it upstairs.” Morgan noted, leaning on her dad for support. Steve brushed her hair back and kissed her forehead.
“Excellent save.” He commended. Tony gave him a smile.
Daniel had taken half his savings as it was ruled out in court. They'd only been married for 8 months when things fell apart. Tony was heartbroken because he really thought third times the charm, this would be the last time.
She struggled to find the right words, but she figured, she might as well come clean. Jacob was almost 20 years old. He wasn’t a kid anymore. He could handle this. “Your dad and I are in a bad place right now.”
“Our family?”
“We love you too.” Her parents responded, simultaneously before they shared a kiss. Even if they never had another child, this would be enough.
He adjusted the cap he had on, pulling the rim lower to shield his eyes. “Sure, until he realizes who I am.”
“When Aunt Nat and I made up, we made a joke about going to SHIELD to teach Hammer a lesson for messing with our family.” She provided. “I told Anna about it.” Because why wouldn’t she share that joke with her sister. “But she
do this?
“Mhm…they’re so defensive.” She commented, resting a hand on his arm. “It’s really not good –”
“Steve, I was looking for you.” Sharon smiled at him after which she acknowledged Tony and Peter’s presence. Her smile disappeared. “Oh Tony. Pietro.” Peter couldn’t tell if she was botching his name on purpose or if she was that incompetent that she didn’t bother to learn the name of the son of the man she was so desperately trying to win over. “Did Steve tell you we’re having a girl?”
He came home a little earlier because he was at a genuine loss for words about his father’s affair with Aunt Nat. He needed answers and only Steve could provide that.
“Taking care of you?” Stephen asked suspiciously.
“I saw Dad today.” Anna spoke after their waiter was out of earshot.
Tony raised an eyebrow visibly annoyed, glancing from his arm to his face. He soon caught on and let him go, mumbling a quick apology. He then thought about what Steve had said and an idea sparked in his head. “We should probably go down to my lab then and you can see my latest project."
Pepper almost believed him. Almost. “Are you persuading me somehow.” Because maybe he did have persuasion as a power.
Sex tended to be a lazy affair as his pregnancy progressed. Steve was gentler, more careful and far more delicate than he needed to be, according to Tony. He was only 20 weeks along and sure his bump was prominent but he wasn’t fragile. He reminded Steve constantly that he could handle it a bit rougher.
Tony stayed mum, his hand now over his mouth in genuine surprise. Stephen stared at him and Tony found himself glancing around the room, taking in everyone’s reaction that he could see from where he stood. He heard Morgan’s voice calling out for him, asking if he was okay. He kept his eyes on her while her face turned into concern then his eyes went back to Stephen as he called out for him.
“I keep telling you, I don’t want you dating my daughter. Do that and we’d consider the debt repaid.”
That was three weeks ago. Since then Sam had been staying at Steve’s place who took Bucky’s side once he’d heard the full story from both sides. He knew all too well how important it was to trust your partner no matter how things may seem. Had he gone to Bucky and expressed his paranoia, Bucky would have willingly consented to a DNA test if it eased Sam’s mind. Steve knew it and Sam knew it too. Instead he did everything behind his back and now he had to try to salvage his relationship with Bucky in any way he could.
“You think I’m over thinking it?” Harley wondered.
Harley took the seat at the vanity, his eyes closed as he held the side of his head. “Yeah,” he provided. “Fun fact. I was under mind control.”
Nova knows this isn’t looking good for Steve but that doesn’t deter her. She gives her opening statement before calling Pepper Potts Stark to the stand. Pepper is asked to repeat the court oath, swearing to state only the truth.
“Is Dad going to hurt Wade, Mom?” Peter asked without looking at him. He was too focused on watching the two of them walk away.
“Over 22 years ago, we met." Steve took a breath to stop himself from tearing up. "21 years ago today, I married the love of my life and it is still the best thing I’ve ever done. Because it gave me you, and our kids - all 5 of them.” He went on, staring down into his favourite brown eyes that now glistened with tears.
“Hi Daddy.” She responded and Peter saw a smile creep up on Wade’s face.
Tony groaned audibly. “We’ve been trying to keep this under wraps. Only immediate family knows but Morgan was pregnant.” Pepper kept quiet when he paused. “She lost the baby two days ago.” A lightbulb went off in Pepper’s head; so that was the real reason Amelia hadn’t been over to see Morgan. All Amelia was getting when she called or texted Morgan was Tony or Steve letting her know how
“You think so?” Harley perked up, grinning and retracting his arm from around her prior to running his fingers through his hair. He was clearly very proud of himself as he got up to fix his hair in her vanity mirror. Being sure to set the cat down carefully first.
. “Mother, you do remember I’m almost 46 years old with four children, right?” Just 3 weeks off. He hoped she did because she was getter older and he worried she might be forgetting things.
“She taunted me.” She closed her eyes, soaking in his touch.
Check out ending notes. It's very important.
Peter pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose – he’d forgotten his contacts – and sighed. “My dad is still a wreck.” He had thought about living with his father, but Steve was heartbroken, sad, crushed, possibly depressed and Peter didn’t know how well he could handle that, with the way he was feeling.
“Or do you just not want to see Sharon?” Bucky inquired.
“How about you Torunn?” Morgan added. Torunn focused on her friends again but she looked lost. Morgan filled her in. “What’s going on in your love or sex life?”
“Rogers.” Strange spoke. His tone was neutral, neither rude nor polite.
“I think my parents are so caught up with rekindling their relationship and getting ready for the new baby that they’ve completely neglected everything else. I don’t believe for a second that under normal circumstances, they’d be okay with you living here.” He paused. “And if they are, know that I’m not.”
“No but I’m not there with you because of school…”
“You did.” Anna responded in his chest, hearing a little hum leave his lips.
Peter caught his mom in the middle of picking a birthday banner. He’d been thinking a lot lately, with Wade being MIA and not there to distract him. Even though it was all said mother’s fault, Peter knew he had to move on from it all. He needed to move on from Wade and this undeniable malice towards his mother. He couldn’t hate Tony forever and with his newfound forgiveness for his mother came the need for a revelation. For whatever reason, his Spiderman secret was eating him alive. He wanted things to be good between him and his mom. He didn’t want there to be any secrets. Morgan had just told him and Dad that she was pregnant not even two days ago. If little miss perfect could mess up that badly and confess to it so early, Peter figured his revelation would be the least. And he was
don’t see the problem.” Jacob jabbed.
“What? What have you done to Morgan?” Tony was sure he had left Morgan safe and sound at home, completely out of harm’s way. What had he done?
said you never stopped just last month.”
Rounds of applause followed and Peter and Wade soon made their way over to his parents where Tony jokingly scolded them for upstaging their wedding day. While Wade, pulled Steve into an unnecessary hug on Steve’s part and called him Dad.
“Okay.” Carol hummed, giving her a look.
Tony answered with a question. “How long have you had these powers?”
Steve scooped up his husband after he said those words. Tony squealed and Steve had to remind him that Harley and Morgan were still in the building. He shushed him. “Wouldn’t want to wake the kids.”
“Only Anna?” Torunn tried to ask but the doors slid open and Anna emerged. She seemed startled, a little surprised to see Torunn.
“You love me?” Tony started to think Steve was shocking him far more than he ever could.
“Did you cheat on him?” her son asked, bluntly.
“Maybe a few weeks ago but ever since your cousin released me from the mind control, I’ve been trying to become a changed man.” Harley clarified. He hadn’t had sex since Nertha. He was becoming a little more self-aware and careful when it came to who he was sleeping with. He was always protected of course but he knew there was still a risk; a chance of him really messing up and getting someone pregnant or catching a disease… He was putting himself first these days, and not in the narcissistic way he was before but in a more respectable and hold-yourself-to-a-higher-standard manner. It was hard not slipping back into his old ways, but this newfound philosophy and lifestyle was gratifying.
“After we lost your twin sister. I held on to you so tightly. I didn’t want anything to ever happen to you.” Tony finished. Morgan and Harley were shocked.
(Torunn and Harley's wedding)
Harley turned 3 on August 6
“Technically, I didn’t –” and Tony lost his ability to speak when Steve pushed pass his folds with no warning and settled deep within him, brushing against his walls.
Tony glared at his husband. He was growing tired of sitting in the same spot for so long. Steve was a struggling artist. Tony hated that because his work was always so good. Every time his pencil touched the sketchpad, he created masterpieces, but Tony supposed that was just the art industry. Not everyone got a chance even if their work was good.
Questions followed as expected. Plenty of

The Stark-Rogers children didn’t like that at all, didn’t like being in a place that no longer felt like home.
?” Anna dared to ask.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay papa,” and the 8-year old ran off, being caught briefly by her dad before making it to her room. “Bye Uncle Steve.”
Tony tipped on his toes to kiss him, resting his arms around Steve’s neck. “Shower.” He suggested. “You can fuck me against the wall.” Tony said bluntly, reminding him of times like that in the past. Steve would love that. They shared a brief kiss and then Tony dropped his robe, giving Steve a show of his naked body as he walked away towards the bathroom. Steve followed, dropping his robe as well.
“I just happen to know Agent Romanov’s dirty little secret.” He explained, kissing her neck.
But Tony let out a little laugh. He might have even chuckled. He didn’t believe that. He trusted Steve. He trusted Nat. They would never do that. It had to be a joke. He looked to Steve in hopes of seeing him laughing. He wasn’t. He seemed conflicted with himself. “Steve?” he inquired. This had to be a joke. This had to be a sick joke.
though he had worded it differently. What Anna was, wasn’t something she had learned. It was written in her DNA and Tony had never noticed it before now.
“I wish my parents could be as happy as yours.” She began, resting her head on his shoulder and occasionally titling her head back so she could meet his eyes. He’d already taken his glasses off in preparation for bed and she could clearly see his steely grey eyes. “And you have 3 parents.”
Tony repeated the name. It sounded familiar, but he couldn’t place it.
Peter stood up quickly. He noticed he had katana swords holstered behind him in the formation of an X. He was definitely taller and more buff than Peter and he had to admit his suit fit him really well.
“Father’s Day is right around the corner. What are you guys planning on getting your dad?”
He lay Tony flat on his back and made love to him, moans passing his lips with each thrust Stephen made. When Stephen had finished inside him, they lay side by side trying to catch their breaths. Tony’s phone went off again and he reached over to the nightstand once more to retrieve his phone. Stephen didn’t stop him this time.
Jacob stayed quiet after that. Carol took it as her cue to end the conversation. She told her son how much she loved him, and Jacob didn’t hesitate to say it back.
Steve leaned out of the hug and gazed down at him. “If you think I love you for what’s between your legs, you’re even crazier than I thought.”
So Tony isn’t sure what he’s supposed to do in this moment. What is he suppose to do with this information that Steve just dropped on him. This isn’t part of the
Peter was a little bit in shock. He’d never slept over before and he could tell from Wade’s pleading eyes and Ellie’s matching ones that he wanted him to. He’d have to lie about that. He didn’t like lying but… “Yeah. I could just say I’m staying at Ned’s or Mj’s.” He knew his friends would cover for him, no question about that.
if you ask me to.” Remy reminded her, holding her at the waist with both hands. Anna nodded, a small smile on her face. She wanted to move pass this like everyone else, but she had to catch Remy up in person, whose natural killing instinct tended to overpower all else. He was ruthless killer and it seemed only she could curve that. Only she was immune to that tendency of his.
“Sure Ellie. That will be fun.” Wade agreed. Peter adored their conversations. There was so much love and adoration in each word that was said. It was beautiful. He wanted kids one day especially if they turned out like Ellie. Wade loved to argue that she was all her mother, but Peter wasn’t oblivious to the little things about her that he saw right of the bat that were clearly a reflection of Wade.
Nertha stepped forward from the side, bowing slightly in respect for her Uncle and Aunt. She greeted them and they acknowledged her. “I must inform you; I saw Harley leave Torunn’s room the morning following her coronation.”
The conversation ended there, due to Amelia’s presence. She left with Remy, leaving Pepper to appreciate his kind comment about her good parenting and if he had any ill intentions towards her or Amelia, she couldn’t see it.
“Rome, I think.” Wanda figured. “He’s having the time of his life. Vis and I want to move back here to raise our family.” Vision was holding one of her hands. Steve was smiling at them. Young love was the best love. The earlier years were the better years for him and Tony even with 3 kids so close in age.
the wedding but one of those siblings felt differently about that.
They stayed in the same position until Nathan complained about his arm falling asleep and she laughed, apologizing. She appreciated the gesture and kissed him sweetly to thank him. She slipped her tongue into his mouth and he welcomed it. He sucked on her bottom lip for a second and her fingernails grazed the back of his neck. That alone was enough to get him hard. They kissed many times before but never like this; never this intensely. Nathan pulled away, staring at her in awe. She was gone; her eyes wild, glossy and terribly aroused.
