It had only been a moment. Steve’s eye line strayed down to look at the basket at his feet, planning a way to discreetly retrieve the tools needed to conserve the exact expression on Tony’s face, how the curves and lines had never seemed quite so soft, and thinking of how best to capture such elegance with the few pencils he’d brought. He’d only looked away for a moment. But it was the wrong moment.
Tony sucked in a breath and released it, along with all of his reservations and defensiveness, and added with a softer tone, “...but it really is beautiful story.”
His breath slowly returned back to a normal rhythm, the numbness having steadily leaked out of him only to be replaced with a stiff ache which was, in all honesty, much more familiar. He began to take stock of his every limb, starting with slipping his fingers through his shirt between two buttons, running the fingers of his free hand along the cool steel and pleasantly warm glass of the rector. After a moment of feeling the almost non-existent but no-less reassuring humming vibration of the machine at work -
Tony didn’t even look up, deciding instead to walk straight to the toaster, picked it up in both hands, and brought it to eye level to peer inside its slots, completely ignoring the shower of crumbs that cascaded to the counter. “Nope.”
The hand moved up again to card through Steve’s hair. “It’s always that way, though, isn’t it? It’s always one of us doing something stupid while the other...” Steve couldn’t not hear the regretful tone in Tony’s voice around the attempted but inevitably aborted smirk, and feel all the more fractured for it. But before Steve could comment on exactly what he thought of that, Tony shook his thoughts onto another track. “You’ll be safe here, I made sure of it. You’re plenty far enough out of the--”
He brought the jacket back up so both their faces were covered again. “Hey, no it’s okay. I didn’t mean to...you don’t have to--”
Which, of course, is when Tony decided to walk in from the other room, only to stop dead in his tracks and openly stare at Steve – who had also subsequently frozen mid-lick.
Tony sat and grumbled as he waited for Happy to bring the car to a stop and come around to open his door.
On the other hand, Tony hated when people pussy-footed around his issues. He’d much rather deal with others’ confrontations head on instead of them walking on eggshells around him like they were afraid he would break at the smallest mention of it. So Steve decided to take his chances, hoping he wasn’t about to send Tony’s walls firmly back into place.
Tony felt a wave of shocked affection wash through him. He had no idea that Rhodey had ever picked up on that, or that he’d ever even seen him watching. And then that he’d told Steve, who in turn was trying to help him retrieve this thing he’d lost without even understanding what it meant to him. He couldn't help but feel...so, so loved.
Steve could only return the embrace by burying his face in Tony’s neck. He took as deep a breath as he could manage, almost trying to keep a piece of Tony within himself and hold him there, willing Tony to never leave his side again. If only…
“I do. I know, Tony. Of course I know,” Steve choked out, because even if they weren’t here on a battlefield, saying ‘I love you’s that sounded far too much like ‘goodbye’s, he needed Tony to know that. Above all else, he loved Tony desperately, and he knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that his love was more than returned. Tony had never let a day go by that left Steve feeling anything less than cherished. “I know, Tony. I...I love you.” He didn’t even care that his words were beginning to waver between more kisses. “I love you. I love you. Please...Please, Tony. Please don’t leave me.”
For a moment, Tony went completely still several moments before he adamantly shook his head no. A heavy weight dropped hard in Steve’s stomach.
“I do feel safe with you. That’s not what….” Not at all sure how he could explain, he took a moment to regroup and pulled Steve’s hand up to lay an apologetic kiss to his fingers. “But this...it’s….”
“Oh my god.” Steve gingerly held Tony’s fingers in his own, looking over the deep red-turning-dark skin with deep concern. “Tony, what did you do?”
“Yes,” he answered, drawing the word out into five syllables. The evidence was found, no point in lying now. May as well just try to carefully steer it from here. “Um, yes. I did. Just a small-”
“But love between celestials and mortals was forbidden, so when the princess’s mother, the goddess of all, heard of their union, she forced the princess to return to heaven.
Steve took a moment before he answered to look at Tony’s face, how he looked now, blissfully unaware of where he was or what he was about to see. God, he hoped this wasn’t a horrible decision.
He pushed away. He needed to get away. This was not love. Love doesn’t steal. Doesn’t torture. Doesn’t kill….or maybe it does but this…not this...
Steve let his head fall back till it rested on the cushion behind him and slowly chewed the piece, taking his time and letting his own warmth melt it a bit to allow the taste to reach every corner of his mouth. It had been reduced to little more than a thick, chocolatey syrup before he finally swallowed it down with another appreciative hum. He didn’t even open his eyes as he broke off another piece to push between his lips to start all over again.
“Better be,” Tony muttered as he went back to fiddling with the tablet. “Took me and JARVIS five simulations to get the size-energy ratio where it needed to be.”
The very next day, Steve found a rather healthy supply of the black triangular prisms neatly stacked into a perfect pyramid on the kitchen counter. Steve would have complained about the fact that Tony could have used that five-hundred+ dollars on something far more worthwhile if Steve himself hadn’t been the very reason they seemed to disappear so quickly – and it certainly didn’t escape his attention that the pile was restocked nearly twice a week.
The irony that Maria Stark knew her little boy would enjoy a tale of a father being bested by his son was not lost on Steve, and he was certain that it hadn’t escaped Tony’s notice, either, but if Tony was going to leave it at that, then so was Steve.
Tony looked down at his hand which was beginning to throb with the restriction of the glove. Hawkeye Band-Aids would have to do for tonight.
Steve brought both of the the other’s hands to rest on his shoulders and leaned in to press his lips to Tony’s. He’d meant it to be simple kiss, a kind of distraction as he reached up to remove the blindfold, but once it was off, Tony’s arms snaked further around Steve’s neck to pull him in and kiss him harder, deeper, wasting no time in pressing his tongue into Steve’s mouth and kissing the very breath from him.
Tony smiled and laid his head back against Steve chest, continuing to rub small circles there to help ease his still panicked heart rate, a thought churning over and over in his head. A thought that could be both dangerous and very, very bad. But the alternative could be so,
“No yelling? No lecture, no ‘You can’t go punching people like that, Tony. We’re public figures. We have to set a standard’?”
“Eight. Stars in his eyes, wants to do something great, change the world. He’s funny. Hell, he had me in stitches. And so damn smart. The questions he was asking, the way he just absorbed everything so quickly. He could really be something great.”
“However, once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, all the magpies in the world take pity on the lovers and form a bridge across the river so they may be together, if only for a single day.”
“Let’s do this. Drop me off just by Taskmaster, I’ll meet you when I’m done and help you with Hammer if you’re not done before me.”
“So basically your body’s systems have completely shut down, but the serum is helping them a little, well, it’s helping the blood flow through your body but it’s also pumping a bad toxin through it too. We have to find a way to get this toxin out of your body before it starts infecting anyone else.”
Steve agreed with Tony, hobbling alongside him until they had gotten to the pavement, stepping tentatively at first. Tony took the chance to pull back (even though he didn’t really want to pull away from Steve’s body warmth)  “How’s the communication signals going?”
“There he goes again with his soldier talk,” Tony would think accompanied by an eye roll but like he stated before, he wouldn’t change a thing. He knew the Captain was stuck in his ways, which would often cause issues for him, heck, it caused a war, because the Captain had an opinion that was rooted down like a tree in a storm.
“Verily…” Thor replied, using his usual booming tone as partially hushed with seriousness as it was, spinning his hammer a few times before using it to smash through the window, latching onto the handle and soaring out, with Carol and Vision flying after him.
Steve had spent the entire day exploring the city, and was absolutely exhausted. Going incognito so he wasn’t recognised was rather tedious, even though he was out of uniform; kids had their way of figuring out it was him. He enjoyed going to the Smithsonian and watching the kids run around his exhibition, as surreal as it was. Then he’d get the occasional glance from nearby kids that’d recognise him, only to place his index finger to his lips and accompany it with a smile which would result in either one of two actions; their jaw dropping to the floor or a smile that was returned.
The bottle that he once had in his hands just toppled to the floor with the more rigorous movement, the bed creaking loudly.
The pang of metal was all Steve could hear for a while, it were as though he could feel himself slipping again but was quickly jolted back to full awareness the moment that Tony threw one of the creatures to the wall with immense strength, making a loud crash as it swooped through some of the equipment that was set up. It was as though Tony had to fight his way through all of these deformed creatures to try and get to Zola who was busy running from machine to machine to trigger chemical releases.
His mind wondered and his eyes shut as he fell into a deep sleep dreaming of his rescue. In truth, Steve
“They’re all gone. You should really take a look out of the window. Those explosions where everywhere, Stark.”
“If I don’t meet you there in let’s say an hour, then send out a search party. I’ll just do a quick check, Steve.”
Steve clasped his shield on his arm, bringing Jan, Natasha and Tony closer. He thrust it out at the bots, ducking under for cover while Jan and Natasha used the space to fire at the hoard.
“Tony isn’t the type – and besides, Taskmaster and Tony didn’t hate each other to that extent, not to beat him down like that. It took me holding him back for him to stop. There’s something wrong, Captain. I want to find out exactly what, but the guy just isn’t letting me.  He won’t even let me into his lab. He’s being distant with me, and Pepper.”
“H-help… I... I can’t..!” He tried to move his hands before his eyes lit up again, letting out a loud pained scream whilst he grabbed Tony to his chest, pulling him into his arms and activating the jets on his boots – holding Tony above him and using his body to crash through the floors above him. He pummelled through not only one floor but the next three, smashing his body through each ceiling until he reached the ultimate top floor, throwing the limp armoured body to one side, sending him crashing into a bookcase that fell onto his body, even as Tony feebly tried to his best to hold up his arms to stop it. It was too late; the bookshelf fell hard on his body, the dents in his armour encasing him tight in the metal cocoon.
to die, I’d be honoured to die by your side. But no matter where we go, or what happens to us, I’ll find you in every reality, and I will love you in each the same. I’ll be with you forever Tony Stark.”
Being strapped to that rocket sent Steve into a fit of anxiousness, laying there against the smooth, cold surface made him relive in his head. There he was, soaring through the sky, able to hear Bucky. He tilted his head up, eyes fixed on the shadow of the boy, desperately trying to move his bound hands and reach for him. “Bucky!” He screamed. The Captain could even feel the wind push through his hair, the powerful gust as they flew higher and higher, but still he was unable to move.
“We say things in anger.” His voice maintained a little wisp of harshness and strictness. “And sometimes it’s the truth.”
Tony’s eyes remained focused on his image and he groaned, gargling up some fluid while his other hand touched his visible lower teeth, now exposed due to a lack of lip – the million dollar smile that was now probably worth less than a cent. Then he caught sight of Steve in the mirror standing next to him, holding on to him protectively, wanting to keep him by his side. There was that stare that seemed almost human, the small movements, and the subtle twitches in Steve’s face that reminded Tony that he was still the man he loved. They still looked perfect next to one another even in the state that they were in, at least in Tony’s eyes anyway.
“It’s more than just a watch, Steve. That’s a communication radio-watch, you hold it up to your mouth, talk, and it’ll come straight to me.” Tony gestured to his hat. “And well, I shaped it like a star because I know you like stars. Almost every shirt I’ve seen you in when I’ve met you after you’ve changed, heading home, you’ve had a star on. So there you go.”  He flushed with embarrassment himself, his foot nervously kicking a tiny little pebble that was by the steps.
Without thinking he stood up, shedding the blanket that kept him warm. With that instant the cold surged up his spine and made him tremble. Never in his life had he run to the bathroom so quickly to leap under the hot water that sprouted through the golden faucet the moment he taps it.
Tony darted toward the map that was by the reception, with Steve covering him and lightly grabbing the receptionist who seemed as brain dead as the rest of the civilians that dwelled outside, though the second that he grabbed her it was as though he’d flipped a switch. She flailed and kicked, making loud sounds which he had to mask with his gauntlet.
Since the moment that he’d seen him he’d been drawn to him. At first, he wanted to say it was curiosity, but now he was second guessing himself, falling quiet as he sat in the car next to Tony. He bit the inside of his lip and looked out of the window at the passing sights, not really paying much mind to Tony’s antics when they’d reached a halt.
“What angel? Who?” He would plea, shouting up in return, staring upward into the endless abyss of clouds, seeking out an answer.
There was a loud sound and Tony hoped for the best, knowing for well the second that the switch fell from the embedded palm, it would activate. So the only choice was to blow off the Green Goblins entire hand and swoop down to catch it.
“So what is this…?” Tony asked, his voice echoing throughout the hallways, which showed how large this place really was.
“I see him, he’s getting to his feet, quick!” Steve said, preparing his shield to throw at the figure hidden by smoke.
Just as Doom stood to his feet he quickly noticed Tony powering up a blast from his armoured red and gold gauntlet, the ray of cyan bouncing off the holographic shield and straight at Doom, who was once again sent back. This time he wasn’t happy about it and as he stood he roared, sending multiple blasts out from each fingertip.
“He does not love you, Steven Rogers. We are on the threshold of change, that man evolves and I am here to facilitate that evolution and give nature a helping hand. We shall be one. You are in our way.”
The others had different sorts of injuries, but it was clear that Jessica and Carol were the ones to have inflicted them. Tony went from body to body, placing them in a row, after all, these were people once and they did deserve to be respected nonetheless. The care that he was giving them by placement didn’t go unnoticed by Peter, who followed and did the same as the man in the iron suit.
He paced and paced like a cage animal but with slow steps, dragging his feet but mentally scolding himself whenever he did; he would hear his Sarge’s voice growling at him in his head, shouting and threatening to send him to the kitchens to peel the potatoes if he didn’t lift his feet when he was walking, if he didn’t keep his back straight, posture up, shoulders squared and sharp.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. It was hard to stay serious even if he was surrounded by the city looking post-apocalyptic, with Tony acting like a cat next to him. The mood seemed to shift after their kiss, Tony seemed much lighter hearted, but Steve had to be sure to veer him on the right path. All that talk about soft skin made Steve’s imagination wonder. It was no surprise that even the young Captain had fantasies of his own and often drifted into dreams, but he shook himself out of it and carried on walking.
“Remember what I said, kid. I’m not going to repeat myself,” It was hard not to become distressed over what was happening with those savages, but again, he had to keep repeating to himself that Carol and Jessica knew what they were doing and they were capable enough to deal with a couple of brain-dead monsters.
Steve could feel his breath catch, not daring to tear his eyes away from one second. Although his friends had tried to fill in as many memories as he could, it just wasn’t the same.
Tony’s eyes widened suddenly, just a second ago he was mocking Steve and his ideas, well, not mocking, more disagreeing and now he was being held in a close embrace. After his nightmares he needed it, but he was curious as to what the circumstances were for the sudden display of affection, not that he was complaining; Steve’s chest was so warm, his breathing was soft as was the material of his shirt.
“Why not? Tony, considering Zola caught him, there could easily be something very extreme in his system.”
After a long pause, a reluctant nod was the response from the blond, pushing back his well-trimmed side-curtained hair and letting a heavy sigh escape his lips. Carefully he drew the man closer and began to tend to each of his bruises, starting with the lower arm and gradually working his way up. Careful, slow, neat wraps along the arm with the occasional flinch from Tony.
“Yeah, go figure.” Tony said. It didn’t surprise him that Steve was awake and wondering the hallways, probably patrolling as always. The guy never took a break.
“She’s this’a way!” Tony pointed out, grabbing Steve’s arm and tugging him the right away through the huge green park. They both ran together with Steve following Tony’s guide.
Hammer was definitely as greasy looking as Tony had described him. He wore a white suit that looked almost grey, short slicked back brown hair, glasses, and hada skeletal looking face with a huge nose. He looked like a man who had been thirsty for attention his entire life, that or he was trying too hard and vastly overcompensating. His glasses were thick white frames, gleaming under the light and hiding his dark coloured eyes that Steve occasionally caught a glance of when the glare on the lenses shifted.
“Got this one!” Tony shouted at a bot coming Steve’s way. With a powerful punch landed square on the bots metaphorical nose, it crashed to the ground.
Tony swallowed hard as he could help but scan the worried face in front of him, so close to him, those pink bright lips, indented chin, golden hair that continued to shimmer in the very little light that continued to peek through the door that was very slightly ajar, “How?” He asked meekly. Although he didn’t believe him, the man seemed so persistent, so why not indulge him a little?
He began to tremble, taking a few steps back before falling to his knees and clutching his head, hands digging into his scalp. “B-Bucky!”
“Well…only Steve and Luke have used it. I was trying to figure out what might be wrong, but I couldn’t find anything in the programming. I’m thinking I might have to rebuild the damn thing.” Tony eyed Reed carefully as his sense of territorialism sprang to him, nevertheless, he attempted to swallow it.
He tapped the comm, holding his hand to his ear as he darted down the street and began to climb the rusty fire escape ladder of a nearby apartment complex and climbed the rusty fire escape ladder of a nearby apartment complex to the roof. Each step echoed loudly, creaking under his weight as light footed as he was at that moment. “Anyone? Team?”
“That’s not true…” Jessica whispered, only to get the stink eye in return from Fury. Not that she was particularly bothered by it; instead she turned her head away and grabbed her sandwich from her desk, taking a huge bite out of it in spite.
The moment that Tony caught sight of him when he was being escorted to the jet he had to stifle a laugh and managed to cover it up with a heavy cough at the rather bland and old fashioned look, this coming from a man that was ever so keen to wear vintage Armani and was currently dressed in a cat suit, upon that realisation he realised that he really shouldn’t have been the one laughing.  Steve fastened his belt, Tony next to him, ordering that they be flown back to NYC. Rather than piloting the large metal, triangular shaped craft that certainly looked like something out of the many sci-fi movies that were cult-famous these days, but Steve hadn’t seen anything like it. But judging on what he was told, SHIELD was similar to a military and or government organisation, so having the technology didn’t surprise him. That and he was far too distracted with staring out of the windows, watching the cities they passed, seeing how everything had changed, not that he could see much asides from a bird’s eye view.
“Now carefully get the green and blue, try and connect them to the base control panel, which is the green thing you see right there.” Tony pointed, using his repulsor as a light over Cap’s shoulder.
, not on his watch. He just needed the company, there was no way he would admit that he would, but he hated being alone. He hated being the ever alone Iron Man. Adjusting to this new foreign landscape and trying to survive was proving difficult as it was, but at least now he felt more at ease with his fellow Avengers by his side.
Just like that, Norman Osborn had managed to take away one of Tony’s most beautiful memories; his night with Steve. Rage surged through him, making his heart race, making the adrenaline pump through his body. He raised a hand and powered up his repulsors.
His mind drifted back to Carol momentarily, knowing that he’d have to go back to see her and tend to her wounds. But she was a fighter, she could withstand a couple of hits. Now his main concern was catching up with Peter.
Peter laughed, “If only. Then I could just walk out the cinema and write a terrible review and it’d be over.”
. His body moved closer to Tony wanting to kiss the lips that passionately called out for him. His tongue licked along Tony’s now dry lips before tilting his head to lick the roof of Tony’s mouth, and the man seized the chance to lock Steve’s lips into a powerful kiss to muffle his own moans that he was extremely embarrassed of. No one had made Tony Stark scream like that.
“Judging by the look in her eyes, Peter, something new is in her system…” He replied, taking a step up toward her, slowly, but sharp jolts of agony surging up his spine with every step closer.  “You know, the way she was powered, it just… Reminded me of those guys we faced back then.”
“Carol and Jessica…? Where are they, what happened?” Steve asked, shutting his eyes when a flash of a memory coursed through his brain, a strange overwhelming feeling befell him, as though he saw them as targets. Especially Carol, with her eyes gleaming with red. He pulled away from Tony and let out a yell of frustration; the man before him backed off quickly and looked up, wondering if he’d touched something he shouldn’t have.
He spent other time trying to assemble a bot that could go in there and deliver the injection, but realised that he did have a better way of going in there rather than using a bot, it would involve his suit being sterilized afterwards but at least he could go in there with Steve if only briefly. He donned one of his suits that he had used for high radiation purposes, mainly when working with some of his more explosive materials; a black suit with a matted finish and red faceplate along with a couple of red accents just for aesthetic purposes. He grabbed the large syringe and stepped through the doors, going through one set that did the decontamination and then stepping through the main locked doors.
His eyes were eyes that saw a world in a whole new light, or much rather darkness. He would step out into the new world where his act, his idea had taken seed and as opposed to seeing superheroes cooperate and work together like he had planned, all he could see was the damage that he had done. Tony Stark was a futurist but at the current time all that he could see was the past, replaying in his mind over and over. Yes, had worked hard, damn hard, for what he had gotten now and he wouldn’t change a thing... Well... Only one thing; for the boy from Brooklyn to just see things from his perspective and not rebel against him, not with such venom and hatred, and yet, he expected as such from Steve, it’s a wonder why he couldn’t see this coming. With all the peace he had achieved and with all the casualties of war all he could think was that “it wasn’t worth it...” Nothing was worth the death of his friends and nothing in the world was worth losing the one person who always had faith in him. Now everything was darker than it had ever been, with shadows and ghost of empty souls wandering the streets. Sometimes he would walk along the streets of NYC whenever it was dark, between late night and early morning, before the sun had risen over the horizon and even before the moon had completely moved along to shed its glow elsewhere. At that time, he would walk the empty streets, barely surviving mentally, since he had become so accustomed to living beneath the surface without his shield to protect him. It was then he would see faint silhouettes looking at him, staring as he walked with his head hung and he would feel their sad gaze upon him as though they pitied him. Always alone. Iron Man.
“That sounds fishy to me, Masters. Why such a small submission window? And with all of those… Technology companies forming an alliance it seems like you were shoved out without an option.”
“—No, you don’t think?” Tony reached just behind him and held up two of the broken pieces he was working on.
He had hoped that the large clunking sounds from the machinery at work inside would drown him out, but hopes were all he had at that point. He was sure Tony was nearby, he could sense it.
“He’s a robot. Robots can’t be trusted. You see? It’s stuff like this, hell I don’t even trust a microwave, heard the things can give you cancer!”
He seemed friendly enough, for now that was. And that charming grin as much as a plastered on one, was enough to coax Steve into giving him a chance but that wouldn’t mean he would lower his guard completely.
watch it? So yeah… I kept these all throughout high school and college, kept them all of my life. Consider them a lucky charm of some sort.”
“Not really, you want to capture moments and there isn’t always someone to take a photo of you. We can’t all have personal photographers, poster boy. Even though I probably could if I wanted to pay for one – You’re making me over think this, let’s just take the selfie.”
Tony pushed down one of the pillows and Steve got down on his knees, his initial curiosity dissolving into a childish mannerism. They couldn’t be adults all the time, not when the both of them were deprived of their childhood with Tony being forced into education and Steve enlisting in the army,  plus there was always something about Tony that brought out the more childish side to Steve when they were goofing around.
“It’s clear that you’re both resigned to the idea that something is wrong with him. I think it was just a malfunction and misreading on the machine’s part. Take it from me, I don’t often blame machines that I build with my own two hands and spend copious hours programming! In this case it
She screamed a high pitched shrill shriek when Steve touched the cat again, pulling it back. “Stay away officer! Until you get that… Whatever it is under control..!” She yelled, pointing at Tony.
“Well look at it, it’s pretty beat up, but I think it’s a hospital. I vaguely remember it being one, a makeshift one when the explosions started taking place. They needed more hospital facilities in NYC,” he explained.
Steve could see that the rage was causing the armour to make rash decisions, so while he taunted it, he dodged the beams that spiralled his way, spinning and dodging before punching his hand right through where Tony had told him to, next to the crack that had already formed. He pushed his hand so deep within the crevice that he could feel shards of metal scrape and cut at his hand, grabbing the warm source before ripping it out. The lights of the armour began to dim and it slowly but surely, eventually fell by Steve’s feet.
Tony crawled a little further and tugged out his own set of cuffs to snap the guy’s ankles together too. If there was one thing that he’d observed it was that Batroc’s legs were extremely powerful, and if they were restrained at least he couldn’t get away. Steve sighed with relief and got to his feet, grabbing Batroc by the collar and holding him up, hearing French curse words being muttered under his breath.
As the reactor was plugged in, the words ‘connection successful’ appeared on the screen. Tony shut his eyes, feeling his consciousness dissolve into the wires, doing the work and slowly disabling each and every chip. It was then that he connected to the power generator, the main computer that controlled every single person, and slowly his energy source seeped through the wires and started to power the generator. Once it had taken over, the energy was pure, and every chip deactivated at once.
He walked up to one of the people that seemed to walk past in their group, giving them a light shove on the shoulder. They turned, looked at him, and then just carried on with the group, continuing with that blank stare.
Steve was really back home, back in Brooklyn, and it was like nothing had ever changed. It was strange being out of the battlefield, but a relief that HYDRA had apparently fallen with the Nazi regime, and that everything was slowly starting to self-regulate. The economy was getting better and the best part of it all was that the kids were free to run around the streets again, happy and carefree.
Steve paced slowly after his bitter win over the two fallen robots. Both lay in heaps of metal scraps, now scattered over the floor. Tony could feel the tension that the two men behind him were projecting; it was a nail-biting moment, especially since Hank had sounded
“Shit…” He cursed. “That son of a bitch, it was him, it was him all along! He did this to me!” He glared at his augmented hand then glanced at Steve. “He did that to you… He… He did that to you!” Rage began to fill his tone, his hand quivered and teeth began to grind against one another.
There they were, outside in the rain, fighting, drenched already with Steve partially covered in mud. The weight only dragged his already fatigued moves, but currently he was completely still, completely in shock. The nerves in his leg felt raw and exposed, a huge amount of pain in his lower body as he attempted to move his legs, his elbows now digging into the ground, his shield having been knocked miles away when he and Tony were brawling on the ground. “Tony!” Steve called out pleadingly, his voice shrill from the yell he had just made, his throat still hurting but not nearly as much as the shooting sharp pain in his leg.
Tony slowly opened his eyes to look up at him to see the man staring up at the ceiling, his strong square jaw tightened.
Steve winced, knowing that the chief was going to yell at him for this, his eyebrows slanted in pain for the poor car. Tony didn’t stay in the car for long, though, instead he quickly darted back out and decided to try and balance on the hood of the car, making it harder and harder for Steve to see.
“Nay, tis not I…” He replied in a softer tone than usual, still strong but not yet reaching its booming peak.
“Why was I kept in that room for so long? You said it yourself, it’s like I lived a life, a virtual life, for so long…  Why wasn’t I woken up?”
what PTSD is, doctor. So how are we going to solve this, my guesses are that him waking up in the future isn’t going to help.”
Steve stared in shock at the hologram that appeared before him and only him, hearing his voice. Everything looked so old, even Tony’s hair was much longer, and this was filmed in the days where he had only a moustache and not the signature goatee.
“I’m totally going to help you take him down, even if it is over your turf. He’s down in Brooklyn…” Tony said. “I’ve still got a little score to settle with him.” Taskmaster once worked under Sunset, Tony’s vicious ex-girlfriend. That and Tony would never turn down the chance to work alongside Cap. Seeing him fight was like watching a professional ballet; he was so co-ordinated and always fought with so much poise and grace. Not to mention he looked pretty darn good in those tight blue pants of his that were obviously one size too small, but Tony wasn’t going to complain not when it was so easy on the eyes.
Steve, however, was worried about Tony, slipping out of the open space where the car door used to be and jumping out, climbing on top of his rival’s car for a second with ease to ensure that Tony was okay, but when he saw the detective slowly get to his feet and fix his hat on, he knew that he was fine. Moments later there was a stream of bright cyan as Tony resorted to using his jet boots again. Steve made a mental note to remind Tony to fix those boots when he could.
He couldn’t believe that man he had idolised since he was a child, having read his comics as a little boy and even having his action figures was real, yet alone in front of him. Apparently Howard’s drunken ramblings weren’t ramblings at all. Every single detail about him was flawless, his chiselled jaw, golden hair. It was a shame Tony couldn’t see his eyes, but he imagined them to be as blue as the ones in the comic books.
Tony couldn’t gather his thoughts and sort them; instead all he could think about was how hungry he was and how good that smell was too.
The difficult part was working on his hand – since it was his dominant hand, so he didn’t make it the complete gauntlet of his suit – a much more streamlined version with an attachable repulsor. It was amazing what a man could do with a box of scraps.
Tony treaded carefully toward the man on the metal table. Slowly he loomed over him and stared down at his pale complexion and peaceful expression. Tony had spent some time cleaning Steve up, getting rid of any of the dark blood smudges that were over his face and fingers; he had even gone to the extent of cleaning his nails. Tony had his fair share of manicures back in the day but never did he think that he would be sitting down by Steve’s side in a suit cleaning his nails to make him look a little more human than he appeared to be. It was like treating and looking after a doll, a doll that Tony had admired for so long – after all, he used to care for his own figurines of Captain America in the same way as a child, with the utmost care and consideration.
Steve ran behind him and started batting at the tails of the long trench coat, trying to put out the flames, that was seconds before—
“You see, it was a merger. Something that could help us both. The Psycho Prism was an invention of mine, long ago that failed due to a number of reasons… But it was something that could help spread my influence across the world, so I wouldn’t have to be there, so the world would be under my control effortlessly – but I couldn’t retain the power, I couldn’t focus it, Hammer and his tech expertise has allowed me to focus it and thus control the villains which your friends are fighting. Sure, it was using plans that I had stolen from Doctor Doom, but Mr Hammer had no problem in adding his own spin to it, it seems extremely effective with my new team. Quite an assembly of my own, wouldn’t you say? All I had to do was strike a deal with Mr Hammer – I don’t put him under my influence and we work together, building together, stronger devices that would allow me to control all of you. Alas, only one obstacle stood in my way…”
“You said you would protect me… Please protect me from him… Please… Please Captain America…” He pleaded between sobs, reaching with a shaky hand toward the drawer and pulling the figure out again, hugging it to his chest. “You promised…”
“He’s not a lab rat!” Tony screamed with frustration, pulling out of T’challa’s grip. Perhaps it was a mix of lack of sleep and too much coffee but he felt heated, his emotions were brimming and he threw a couple of papers off the table. “He’s not to be studied like that! He’s a person, he’s alive, he’s a real man! You can’t keep him like this!” He blinked away the tears.
“STOP!” Tony squirmed, gritting his teeth tightly, hands wrapping around the wrists of the suit, trying his hardest to pry them away. The burn around his neck was like no other, the intense heat emanating from the metal around his throat was so hot that he could feel his skin begin to sear, in fact, he could smell it, and the stench of burning flesh was one that always made him cringe and remember the time that he was on that island alone with the suit, and it did the same as it was doing now.
“What’s that? The moat? I know it was an awesome touch. Peter’s room had blue sheets so you know.” Tony’s grin stretched, dimples on show.
He stepped toward Steve and placed a chaste kiss over his lips, then watched for his reaction. Shortly after he received the faint blush accompanied smile he was anticipating and felt his heart flutter. This was going to be the start of something big and he knew it. Plans bubbled in his mind, thinking about what they could be together, how they could have a life together. Tony was a hopeless romantic when it came down to the line, and although he had gone through his fair share of relationships there was one that stood out, and that was with Steve. The man that was constantly on his mind, the man he aspired toward, his hero. In times of crisis he would ask himself ‘What would Steve Rogers Do’. Even Rhodey knew how much Tony really cared about the guy, and would often jokingly mock him for it.
“These results indicate that he, at the time, had no cardiac function. Yet his blood was somehow being pushed through his body, circulating the serum.”
There was a voice from the distance, and a man with a white hood with orange lining stepped out from one of the hidden corners of the alley, “You give us info, and we’ll give it to you,” he said.
Steve sighed, still trying to comprehend it all. Staying largely silent and locked in his thoughts for most of the trip. Tony’s attempts at small talk were futile, that was, and until he began talking about the cartoons he watched. It took a lot to admit that to Steve and it was a strange position to be in. People would be fans of his, not the other way around, so actually getting excited about talking was really a foreign feeling to him, and yet he could feel his heart race, voice raise with excitement when he started talking about fights that he’d seen illustrated, and filled with even more joy when Steve would expand on them. The talk from the soldier was reluctant at first, but hearing someone talk so passionately about his exploits and feeling the need to correct him on some points made him open up a little more.
“Watch out!” Steve shouted just as Tony was about to step his huge boots in a bed of sunshine yellow pansies. Tony gasped loudly and jumped over them instead, Steve doing the same.
His body trembled, it quaked with the realisation that he had broken Steve. Slowly but surely the colour was returning to Tony’s eyes as he pulled Steve closer. The rain danced along his features, droplets trickling down his temple.
There were figures standing all clustered amongst themselves, and both Steve and Tony’s hearts lit with glee and renewed hope. The Avengers were, and always would be, the light in even the darkest situations. As they neared, step-by-step, the images of their friends became clear; Thor, Vision, Carol and Clint stood by the others, twiddling with the tips of one of his arrows, and it wasn’t long before Janet flew up to them right on cue with Natasha leaping gracefully over the building tops, and finally into the park. They all looked worse for wear, having fought their respective villain and all with clear burn holes and singes on their uniforms, which were yet another clear indication that they’d all been caught blasts.
Carol ran in from behind Luke and Danny, her pace so quick that her hat blew off and her blond hair unravelled. She was known for her strength in the team, that’s how she’d earned respect, not only because of that but also due to her discipline. Back in the Air Force she was a true hero and a wonder, most people even considered her a marvel, earning her the nickname Miss Marvel; that was, until she had been promoted to colonel.
The team weren’t anywhere to be seen, so they both ran outside and upstairs toward the roof where they were met by everyone. Warm rays dancing along their skin as they stood proudly, holding up their hands and punching the sky as they stood with the rest of their team –
That was the perfect opportunity to divide and conquer. The instant one was ushered toward the noise, the other remained in position. Steve ran as quickly as he could, losing his footing for a moment on the boot but catching it as he leaped up behind the man and elbowed him hard around the crook of his neck, hitting the nerve and sending the large mass of muscle to the floor, dragging him quickly into the building so he didn’t attract attention. Tony meanwhile crept up behind the distracted guard and pounced on him from behind. Pinching the nerve around his neck just like Steve had taught him to, muffled by Tony’s metallic hand that was wrapped around his mouth. When the man finally fell limp, Tony copied exactly what Steve had done and dragged the man inside, placing them by the door. They were stunned, but that meant that they had to be as quick as they could before they woke up again.
When Steve returned his thanks, Tony felt his heart swell, turning to Reed. “Let’s get him more food.”
Tony stared with anticipation, trying not to remain fixated on the man. “You think about it, and I’ll be just out there when you’re ready.”
“Let’s try a transfusion, we still have some of his blood from various samples, we can replicate and give him a supply and see if it’s strong enough to fight off the virus.” Reed suggested.
“Those chemicals of yours got blown up along with all of your labs, in fact, everyone’s labs. There’s no science, there is only obeying and adapting.”
Doom laughed again behind his mask, stepping down from his throne with grace that neither Steve nor Tony thought was possible in the weighed armour he was encased within.
“Perfect, now is the time then.” The gruff voice behind a mask spoke, the metal around his face causing his voice to echo ominously behind it, bright blues peering through the slits at the screens with interest, watching the red dot move quickly down the screen and along a street. “Now, we strike. I will get those plans, if it’s the last thing that I do!” He laughed darkly.
Tony just flinched in return, palms placed on the sheets of the fine silk sheets, his grip tightening once he felt the skim. It was difficult to try and keep his knee still, to prevent it from jerking backwards but still he stayed.
“Okay, okay, lovebirds, we ain’t got time for this.” Luke said, he and Danny running through the smoke. The air was now filled with dirt; car alarm sirens chiming after the ground had shaken.
“Wait, Tony, hold on… I just noticed something.” The alternate armoured version of Steve stepped back.
“What are you talking about, you realise I’m the director, that means I’m in charge.” He hated using his title to get his way, always a firm believer in earning his rank, but when the going gets tough the tough needed to get going.
“Steve... M-m... my hero...” He whispered, mainly to himself. “I’ll love you till I die... Beyond that even...”
“Yes, Captain, I am here having rounded up the civilians from the City, we’re just offshore in numerous boats. War Machine has assisted me in evacuating citizens using jets to a nearby heliport, SHIELD are also assisting us using the carrier. What are your whereabouts?”
“Deal.” Steve replied stepping in and looking at the large pane of glass that was before him where the others would stand for observation. The thick steel doors closed behind him, the heavy sound alone making his shoulders shrug with surprise. It was then that he had come to the realisation that he was locked in, sealed in tight. Normally he would feel his heart drumming at this point, but he felt nothing but a nauseous pool swirl in his stomach which he pinned on all the food he had eaten earlier that day.
He was introduced to SHEILD, his weapons were repaired, and training facilities were provided. Tony ensured that everything Steve wanted, he was given. Spoiled for choice, but the soldier demanded very little asides from the basics that he was used to, appreciating his new employers with the added fact that their leader was someone who he was very well acquainted with. Solo missions began to show how well Steve would do by himself, but of course Tony and Rhodey were standing by just in case anything went awry. On some occasions Tony was too busy to monitor Steve, so Rhodey did the honours until he had to let his friend get along with his own business. Rhodey was an integral part of the team, and was a superhero too, he had his own matters like the others to attend to, he couldn’t be babysitting the entire time – not that Steve needed to be looked after, especially after proving how quick he was to adapt and learn. Tony should have known that the master tactician from the pages of his books did exactly what he did on the cover.
Darkened loomed thickly over the Avengers mansion ominously, heavy with rain but only allowing spits to sprinkle over the city. It was that time where day was merging into night, not that anyone could really tell given how the clouds had masked the rays of the setting sun, quilting the above and plunging the city into a premature evening. The lights in the city were turned on, and yet it seemed so void of life. For New York City to have its inhabitants scurry toward shelter was a rather spectacle, and it left the streets bare, with only one or two civilians running underneath their umbrellas to seek warmth and somewhere dry.
“…Sir, we’re testing the subject to establish if he’s fit as a SHIELD operative… We’re under Fury’s orders…”
Steve stared up from his possessions with a hollow glare, trying at least fathom all he had been told.
“Not again, Steve! Listen, we spent the night together, we love each other, we’re going to take this guy down and free our friends.”
being in situations of helplessness. What he did like was the glowing pride he would feel the moment one of his friends had come to help him, especially if it were Tony. Years of that unspoken connection and years of that bond between them had just earned Tony a special place in his heart…perhaps it could be considered that Steve placed him on a pedestal, even after the war between them. He knew it was all worth it in the end, because no one could take the place Tony had in his heart.
The punching bag was still on the floor of the room, which scared Tony. He didn’t know how it could’ve fallen off the chain. He checked the security footage again but he did realise whenever Steve was having a shower it was turned off for his own privacy. He may have been keeping it there but the soldier has his rights, and he wouldn’t infringe on them either, even though unbeknownst to Reed and the others just prior to that he couldn’t help himself from being lost in basking in the wonderful glow of the man that he admired to such a deep set extent. They would never know nor would they ever understand how he felt and how he had always felt. His priority now was getting Steve out of there, and he had already partially broken his promise when he had fainted from his fatigue. He said that he wouldn’t rest and Steve seemed to appreciate that, though there was that glance of sadness that he did spot even through the glass that indicated pity for him.
“I’ll heal your heart Tony Stark, whenever you need me.” He said, “Just promise you’ll never drink the pain away.” He replied, placing his lips to the side of Tony’s jaw.
Steve made a loud sound and ran ahead of his partner, grabbing Tony’s hand to pull him to follow. He could see darting shadows, getting as close as he could to them, distracted by each movement. There was something and whatever it was moved very quickly.
Hammer’s hand slipped into the inner pocket of his expensive looking blazer as he pulled out a beeping device; a small handheld tablet which allowed him to see outside through a few newly added cameras that were perched in various places along the outside of the factory.
“Stark tech! It works just like a real shield!” Tony explained, though quickly as they dodged another blast.
“New and old, combining to make something special, I like that,” he pondered, tapping the centre of his neatly groomed goatee. “Would it be too corny to say that you complete me?”
“Inhale, then exhale…” Tony said out loud to himself. When he breathed out, a hand covered his mouth and his eyes shot open, knowing for well he had very little repulsors power left, not when the power regulation system in his suit was malfunctioning because of his faulty augmentations. His body jerked back into the powerful grip as black leather gloves slid over Tony’s mouth, letting out a muffled yelp.
Steve smacked his own hand on his forehead, dragging it down. Of course Tony’s priorities would lie within the internet. The frown on Tony’s face was so stretched that it could’ve reached the ground, that was until Tony flashed the saddest puppy-eyes at Steve, over doing it by adding a lip wibble as he pawed at his phone screen.
“Exactly. So we’re becoming lab rats whether we like it or not. All of the superheroes and us types are all stuck tryin’ to cover our own asses without being caught and experimented on. We surface and we’re goners courtesy of giant mobs of people who’ve been brainwashed by their TV to kill anyone with superpowers. They made the excuse of saying that we would be dependent on these things because they’re preventing us from getting damage from the gas, since people who inhaled the gas well… Lost control of their limbs and had to get substitutes. So everyone was chipped regardless with the basic ‘breathing control chip’, and most people have augmentations since they’re becoming a fashion trend right now – they enhance you. Fancy that for plastic surgery huh?”
He took steps of caution, toward the gate and stared up at it with such dismay. It was hard to believe that not so long ago he’d be in that very park, almost every lunch, eating a bagel with some coffee usually with Steve by his side. After all, it would be the super soldier that would’ve coaxed him out for lunch rather than sitting down in his office cooped up all day.
Tony pushed himself up slowly only to see Janet blasting Whirlwind back with her stings. She was fuelled by the passion to get Hank out of there, and was clearly fatigued from fighting for so long, but regardless, she continued to throttle the clearly possessed villain until he collapsed again.
Just as Tony had said, they headed straight for a lab that was located in the center of the city, luckily one which they weren’t too far away from. Turns out that huge tower that Steve had taken a gander at when he’d first explored the city on one of his lunchtime adventures actually entirely belonged to the detective that he was now working alongside with.  He couldn’t believe it when Tony had told him whilst they were pushing the car; in fact, it almost made him stumble.
“You wouldn’t have come searching for me if I wasn’t valuable.” Steve replied, reaching out for the mirror and touching the surface, his fingers pressed against it, glowing azure meeting Tony’s cyan, locking with such a fierce intensity.
Steve wasn’t going to mess around, not when he could hear the others approaching. He needed everything to be cleaned up by the time the others arrived to show that he and Tony were fully capable of handling the bigger cases. The leaper threw a punch, but Steve dodged to the left, ducking and then countering with a perfectly planted uppercut to his chin, sending him up to the sky. Batroc kicked his legs out, obviously using his best assets to take Steve out. Once more Steve punched Batroc’s right foot away whilst ducking under the left that flew above his head, tilting his body back and throwing his weight on the leaper which sent him crashing to the ground.
“I’m not perfect Tony, far from it. But trust me, you’re an angel, I just want you to believe that.”
Immediately confused, he stammered. “I, it’s not, I wasn’t… I can’t remember I just… Tony, listen to me. I want you to listen carefully while I’m still of a sound mind.” He pressed his palm to the glass to leave a cold print stain. “If something happens and I’m beyond saving, I want you to do it. I want you to kill me. No one else, you.”
“What? Tony… Tony…” He repeated, scrubbing a hand through his hairline, careful not to spackle blood on those prominent grey temples. There was an apologetic tone as his dismay began to show, trembling.
“I guess my wings are shedding because… You don’t believe me, that’s the only plausible explanation.” He said sadly, though Steve was relieved to feel Tony’s cheek rest against his chest again. He always was eager to pull him into an embrace, especially after a heated argument.
With Bucky by his side Steve seemed much better, happier even. So he resumed his routine, this time changing it ever so slightly to accommodate spending time with his friend. A feeling of gratitude befell him, feeling more attached to Bucky than he should have. The kid seemed very curious of Steve’s demeanour, but didn’t question it, which Steve found a little strange but he was just glad his friend was there and by his side again. The dazzling duo was complete again, and had survived the war and was back home, and he really couldn’t ask for more than that.
“Will you?” Steve asks. His voice low and soft, his eyes fixated on the dark haired billionaire that stood with his arms dangling at each side, mouth wide open.
He found his jaw quivering as he looked deep into his soul-less eyes once more, pleadingly, hoping and praying that wasn’t him staring back, that this was some hallucination. He felt broken at the realisation when his fingers touched the sharpness along his jaw, that he could practically feel the bone.
Steve was sluggishly pacing the room at that point. He could feel his thought pattern becoming erratic as he was plagued with the constant restlessness from being confined for that long without much to do. The punching bag was broken and on the floor and Tony hadn’t really had the chance to fix it, so Steve had tried but was unable to repair the chains that were broken, even when he had bent the metal there was absolutely no chance of getting it up there even as he tried to think of different ways. Usually this would be a synch for Steve; after all, he was a master tactician with much more to him than what was given to him by the serum.  He was gifted with brains, the ability to think and advise driven by his constant thirst for knowledge. He may not have been on a genius level but tactics wise he was one of the best out there. There was a reason that he was seen as one of the greatest heroes that had ever lived, and that wasn’t just because of the serum that came out of the bottle and his heart of gold.
“You need to stop this nonsense.” Tony said, gritting his teeth slightly as he pulled away, giving Steve a glare which hurt him, it caused his wings to fold around him even more.
Tony Stark the ultimate business tycoon had managed to extend his reach, surpassing the ministry of defence and take over SHIELD after years of working under Fury’s orders. The acquisition resulted in him overthrowing Director Fury and taking over the world’s most secure home of defence.  Fury then resumed his work, begrudgingly so, as Commander but was keen to keep operation rebirth under wraps. That was until Fury was caught in a catastrophe of an accident and was sent to the medical bay back at HQ to be tended to, that was when things started to slip and secrets started to spill.
Natasha brushed her shoulders off, turning to face Tony and Steve properly. “Janet told me… I’ll fill the others in.” There was a sympathy about her voice when she caught sight of Steve’s legs with her own two eyes. It was different hearing about it, but seeing it in person just didn’t sit right. Nonetheless, she signalled a nod at the others, and they too replied with an understanding stare. Everyone knew Steve by this point and knew that he wouldn’t want to talk about what had happened to him when they had other concerns.
It took a moment for Steve to give in, nodding sadly and aiming his own repulsor toward the Green Goblin, with Tony doing the same, both of them standing back to back, armour to armour, with their hands held out, palms facing the same man.
With a sharp gasp, he opened his eyes again, trying to clear the murky vision, that copper taste tainting his mouth once again. His body jerked forward sharply. Grimacing in pain and yet, with his body so numb he was able to feel the fizzling continue in his chest.
He was caught off guard by the sudden spasm in his boots as the power level began to become irregular in his newly fitted boot – more specifically, the augmented leg.
“I won nothing!” Tony barked back, feeling Steve’s gentle but sturdy hands keep his head up when he just wanted to pull away, but the touch felt like a warm pillow that kept him at ease and prevented him from breaking down further.
Upon reflection he realised that he couldn’t take one of the jets, which would be too obvious. So once he reached the top of the building he allowed the smart metals from a case he kept nearby to hover around his body before latching over his skin. Red and gold now covered him in the form of one of his latest suits, his RT node glowing a bright blue, helmet clasping on before the faceplate locked itself. The metal shimmered in the sunlight as he stood on the roof, the bright blue panels with intel flashing up on his screen, looking from side to side to ensure that the suit was in working condition, and JARVIS confirmed that by reeling off statistics. “Perfect. Let’s go to the coast of England then.” He said, the boosters lighting up and beginning to flare before the propulsion system took effect, sending him up into the air in a vertical stance, taking flight with blue streams of light following him. “I should probably get some tea for Pepper, or some crumpets. You know if I can’t buy the Queen out of the crown jewels. I tried once, actually, they drive a hard bargain. National treasures, pff.”  Tony bantered with his AI.
The people outside stopped in their tracks, eyes opening as though they had just woken up, gasping for air and stumbling around, looking in sheer confusion.
“I… Like the sound of that.” The billionaires expression lit up at the last word, lacing his fingers with Steve and finally turning their backs.
“Wait wait, while we’re on the subject let me do something.”  Tony ran to Steve’s side eagerly, holding his phone up so that they could see both of their faces in the screen. “This is called a selfie, you’ll hear the term used a lot.”
Tony sucked in his cheeks, turning his head toward the darkness of the sewers. “We picked a good spot then.” He attempted a positive spin on things, just to make the kid lighten up a bit.
Steve was bending forward and vomited out a huge amount of black ooze. The sound was absolutely putrid, yet alone the sight, enough to make Tony’s stomach turn. In fact, he was sure he threw up a little in his suit. Quickly he rubbed Steve’s back. “Better out than in, huh?”
All Victor needed to do was snap his fingers and the wall panel to his left turned around like a secret passage, revealing Reed strapped to the wall, his body frozen and in tight binds with smoke from the liquid nitrogen misting around the man, causing his teeth to chatter. Of course, the only way to restrict rubber was to freeze it – science class 101.
It wasn’t long until the skies started to become darker and large beaming spotlights filled the city while everyone returned to their own spaces in swarms.
“Monopolising the industry since I wasn’t there to compete and industries like Baintronics weren’t interested at all.”
“Me too, always have. You know, sometimes you get tired of running and you just want to stand up to them, but you know, in this case you can’t. But you want to. Sometimes it’s just being curious, like what would happen to me if I did just get caught.”
Steve would open the door, smile at the book and take it to his desk to sit down and read, and he would read when he couldn’t sleep, then he’d go down to Tony’s lab and discuss it with him. After all, Tony was as much of an insomniac as he was. The post-traumatic stress had resulted in the inability to sleep, but Steve was lucky that was all it was.
The other cops stood by the door and watched as the guy was slowly placed into a cell; looking extremely grateful for being in that cell, actually. He dropped down and curled up in the corner of it. Steve couldn’t help but stop and stare, wondering how on earth someone had ended up like that.
“Wouldn’t have it any other way.” They took a few more steps together until they reached Steve’s bedroom door. Tony knew he’d have to part ways with the man, groaning at the thought of leaving the comforting warmth and departing from the firm yet secure grip as well as the Captain’s distinct smell of (oh so American) apple pie with a hint of cinnamon and the bitter faint after-smell of gunpowder.
“I don’t know this tech, Peter. I’ve been in a coma for this long, I knew how the prosthetics would work because Stark Industries was actually had a few in the works, but brain chips? That’s a completely different story.”
To his surprise there’s a small note in place, resting just in front of the face of the digital clock. Tony reaches for the paper and pulls it closer to see, his vision still with an edge of blur as he tries to wake up just a little more.
Hank shot her a glare. “Don’t say that, we just finished dealing with him. I would much rather go without the huge amount of damage he had done to the city…” Besides, Hank wasn’t too keen on working side by side with Reed all the time. Whilst he did appreciate his genius from time to time, he knew being around him for prolonged periods of time would be infuriating. As much as he admired his dedication to the cause, the gist of it was that Reed could be rather oblivious and would often forget that there were others in the lab alongside him, attempting to help.
“Yours….” Tony replied, though practically incoherently, biting onto Steve’s skin for some sort of relief. He wanted to leave the same marks that he was sure the man left on him. Though Steve tactically countered by dragging his fingers down Tony’s back, moving to the front to get a grip on his hipbones, his thumbs caressing the distinct V.
The others observed any changes in Steve’s brain activity with great caution. Once it was clear on the monitors that Steve’s brain activity had slipped to resemble that of someone in a coma, they settled down. Although they did register that Steve’s brain activity patterns were already abnormal before the injection, they had just been settled to a point that there was very minimal synapse activity, even more minimal than before…which would indicate that he was sedated. Steve lay still, his skin absurdly pale, dark veins patterning along his exposed skin. If anything, he looked like Snow White after she had bitten into the poison apple, with his beauty preserved behind that pane of glass. Tony trailed his fingers along Steve’s profile shamelessly, tracing how sharp it was when he was laying there on the ground. But he quickly realised that he couldn’t just leave Steve there; he sent in two more bots to reel in a steel bed. Carefully they both lifted the super soldier up, staggering a little with his weight and muscle mass, but they managed to raise him to place him on that table. Tony knew that the very table he was placed on looked more like a morgue table with the body placed on top of it, just waiting to be reeled into one of the many cases for a post-mortem. However, with the minimal brain activity still on screen, it was clear that Steve wasn’t alive…nor was he dead.
“Tony…” Steve said in that voice that would always make Tony take the submissive corner. It sounded more like a disappointed parent calling the name of their child after they’d done something horrible.
“I know I did… I’m sorry.” He scrubbed his fingertips along the tip of his hairline, pushing his hair back even more. He was sure in his own reflection in the pane of semi-reflective glass he could see more greys sprout, which didn’t surprise him but had hence resulted in a frown. “You know I’m doing all I can Steve, the sooner we get you better, the sooner we can get you out here.”
Steve nodded in understanding; that and he was all too familiar with those comic books, after all there was once upon a time when the policeman had been an aspiring comic book artist – but that was another story for another day.
Steve winced, kicking his legs out and hearing the repeated thuds of his boot clanging against the metal. “Tony, call it off!”
Steve shook his head, trying to remind himself that he was lucky to have this job in the first place, knowing full well that he shouldn’t have been looking a gift horse in the mouth. “Just a little bored, is all. I’m sure we’ll find something to do.”
Steve’s fingers began trailing the hem of Tony’s designer black pants, unzipping the front, slipping his hand into them without hesitation.
It was those drops that drizzled over the huge metal bar that was just on top of Tony. A gentle stream of water made its way down the side of the rusted bar towards its edge, reaching the jagged corner before cascading momentarily in the air until it met with Tony’s eyelid. More drops followed, one by one, landing on Tony’s eyelids.
Tony pouted under the mask. “Hah hah, very funny. Maybe your jokes are the things that needed augmenting.”
Steve ran over the strip that was made, straight to Tony’s side and grabbed him, pulling him out of the way as the ceiling collapsed just where he was standing.
Tony took a couple of deep breathes. He could feel his anger boiling before he was grabbed, being pulled to attention to face them all. The men before him looming over like all knowing oracles, staring down at a soul that used to stand among them, expecting him to join so willingly without debate. Slowly he recollected himself, turning to look at Steve laying on the mattress, his body turned and facing the wall.
The occasional scuttling of rats feet by the door made Tony stir, then more sounds started to ring through his ears; the sound of the wind rattling the rocks, the propellers of the search light helicopters as they did their rota, then the loud sound of a wood plank falling was what made Tony sit up. He knew it was either the wind, or something they didn’t place back properly when they were entering the building.
He couldn’t stand it. He couldn’t stand being alone like that. Not for now anyway. As big of a soldier as he was, being pummelled in the face with loss was painful enough to deal with, and yet he was forced to carry it all on his shoulders. He slipped out of the cold sheets to his feet, rubbing his eyes and deciding to explore the new place. His wondering mind guiding him down to Tony’s lab which was vacant at the time, just large hanging robots from the chains, and that was all that was there. When he walked further he decided to snoop. The man did say that he would be in either his room or the lab, so the place was empty at present. A few more steps in and he heard a voice, spinning around on his heel and catching sight of a particularly menacing looking robot. It was gold and red like the rest of them, but this one just looked different. He couldn’t help but inspect it with a furrowed concentration. It really was the future, and he had seen bots in HYDRA’s labs before, but this was different. He could’ve sworn he heard it say something when he was walking, but it was there, still, chained up like a doll being repaired.
That instant Steve realised who he was talking to. The name Jarvis, the house he was in, it looked so familiar. It was Tony’s old house that he’d shown him, and of course, Jarvis was his old butler and best friend. The little boy in front of him was Tony, though he should’ve recognised him by his short black hair and large blue eyes. He had such an adorable chubby, round face, button nose and was wearing a Captain America shirt that seemed oversized for him, but he seemed happy in it, with little black formal trousers and sneakers.
“Sarcasm is unnecessary. However, our solution at this time, the best course of action would be to sedate him.”
Tony could’ve sworn for that second Steve could see through the one sided mirror and was looking directly at Tony.
“Tony.” There it was, that dreaded powerful tone T’Challa could use, strong enough to command a country. Then again, Tony knew the real reason that he was so invested was because he didn’t want the strain of whatever Steve had to spread to his own lands.
“So Reed and I were collaborating, doing our work for the police, who I at that point worked for as a newly qualified detective, and drafted up plans for the perfect police robot. Only thing was, our prototypes constantly failed. They needed something much smarter than AI, they needed real brains. Regardless, our work became well known and admired and wanted by dozens.”
Boomerangs eyes narrowed, sucking at his tongue and clicking it. “Tch, you’re no fun.” There it was, a thick Bostonian accent took its place.
“This ain’t the time for hugs, sorry Carol!” he replied as he leaped out of the way, jumping over her body and running up to Tony. “Well, Carol’s alive!”
When he raised his leg, the mechanics moved accordingly. It was fascinating to a degree but also daunting. With the overwhelming sense of confusion flooding his mind, all he could think about was how his life had changed from this moment onward, how he would never be the same. There he was in the past rejecting some of Tony’s suits, and now he had no choice but to embrace what was now part of him. Of course there was an underlying resentment, but it was certainly not Tony’s fault – it was the Purple Man and Hammer. It wasn’t like he had time to dwell on it, but Steve gave Tony the benefit of the doubt. He knew that Tony wouldn’t have gone this far if he didn’t see a need to.
Tony snapped out of it and looked around at the TV that was on behind him, the news of course, and then there was Jessica sitting down with one leg folded over the other crunching popcorn between her teeth, turning her head to look at Tony whilst Anya sat on the arm of the chair next to Jessica, reaching over to try and get some of the corn. Jessica frowned at her before getting a handful and chucking it at her playfully, making the younger girl pout before laughing, both of their attention turning toward the man who sat upright with a cold sweat dripping down his temple.
Quickly he placed his thumb to his ear and his pinkie by his lips, the silver rod extending from the top of his hat.
“Peter, can you open that respirator and pull out the green power panel? It’s just behind the red power wire.”
Steve’s grip tightened on the white straps and he pulled him closer, but not aggressively. “It’s hurting you, isn’t it? Those bruises… All the suit, all those malfunctions… Tony you need to get rid of it. You need to destroy it.”
“I can’t… Feel you, Tony. Not with these.” He stuttered, looking at his new hands that were made of sparkling chrome each finger curling in tandem. “I could feel your heart just not… You.”
Even adrenaline fuelled, it wasn’t enough to speak quickly. Steve ran toward him, tackling him down by the torso and punching into his chest. Tony tried to punch him back as hard as he could with his augmented hand, using the one shot arm thruster he’d installed, making his hit far more powerful than before. It was enough to shove Steve back, and bought him enough time to crawl toward Norman, but just as he had managed to get close, the super soldier yanked him back by the ankles. Steve was so strong that he tore off one of the boot covers, crushing Tony’s left foot with a mighty crack. Never before had Tony felt such a powerful electric surge shoot up his entire body – the augmentations he had were connected to his nervous system.
The repulsors shimmered brightly as they gathered more power, knowing this would be the last of Norman Osborn. The fight had led to this. Take him down, save the world, free them from his control.
The flight went by relatively quickly, especially after Tony had made his first sonic boom, travelling at extreme speeds often made cross-sea journeys extremely quick. By the time he had reached the coast, it was little after dinner in the UK.
“I don’t know what you are, but you don’t know me, or Tony!” He yelled. “And you’re not funny either! Then again, Tony wasn’t the funny one in the group. We all know that it was me and Danny that were the funniest.”
Steve grabbed the large shoulder pieces, his nails scraping against the metal before he shoved Tony with all of his body weight to the ground, staring at him with eyes that Tony could only identify as feral.
There it was. That was the trigger that Tony’s gut seemed to be waiting for. His eyes shot open and he keeled over, vomiting a dark brown liquid straight onto the floor.
“Now that we’ve quite exceptionally explained our intentions, I feel as though you should get finished off…” The Purple Man turned to Hammer, who rubbed his hands together far too eagerly.
“That’s a good one, what is that? A pickup line? Lemme tell you Cap, that lines pretty outdated.” Tony said with a laugh.
“Well, yeah, considering that the first line of defence that Killgrave and Hammer had was the villains they pit us against, their second line will be those drones, and then once those are taken care of we’ll be able to take them out, fair and square.”
Peter turned to face Tony, “He would rather people get tributes, and you know, this place was turned into a memorial way after Cap was gone. But they didn’t find a body to—“
“That’s ace, and I’m the queen of Sheba. Now back out of here ya flag covered yank.” He gestured with his boomerangs, pointing to the door.
Once he was done he pushed himself up from the floor, dragging his feet and letting his blood coated hands fall, trailing blood behind him as he walked around trying to sniff out more food. That’s when he spotted him; Steve was hunched over a mangled body that he couldn’t even identify. The soldier had really gone all out on him, smashing his head in completely. It was only the ID that lay strewn to one side with some tattered fabric that gave the identity of the man away – the mangled cape made Tony’s already paling eyes widen sharply. How Steve had managed to take down Doctor Strange was a question all in its own – probably an ambush, knowing the tactician. There were tentacles probably from defence laying around, but it had seemed that Steve had managed to take down a man with power of an epic proportion. He had achieved the impossible,
“Yeah, I got that…” He stood up, taking off his cap and cleaning his face with his sleeve, not that it helped him look any more presentable.
The mention of Bucky caused a hitch in his breath. Nonetheless, the armoured soldier kept his guard up, even as Tony managed to make a small circle around him without taking him out of sight once. The jet was far gone by now, but that wouldn’t stop Tony from doing his best to track it. “That hit home huh? You remember Barnes right? Bucky Barnes, your friend, served alongside us, took your place when you’d fallen. Where is he now, Steve? Where’s Bucky?”
“Must be to power the device Hammer’s helping Killgrave build.” Steve stood by, curling his fingers and signalling for the others to sidle against the wall. He made sure that he took the front so he could peer around the corner and gauge the patrol patterns of the bots. Luckily AI were more predictable and had a set pattern and routine, and it took him a matter of minutes to figure out what their patterns were.
“I’m sure you will” Steve replied with the utmost faith, his feet making loud clanking noises against the floor.
“You have every right to blame me, but I’m glad you don’t,” he simply replied, fixing his faceplate back over his face to hide how broken and beat up he’d felt. Never before had being at a graveyard jogged his sense of being. Now he was starting to question everything, so much so that it was giving him a headache.  “I think we need to find somewhere to rest for the night, wait it out.”
“Robot? No, that’s not right. More like… A cyborg, yeah, an augmented human. Cyborg sounds neat though, reminds me of those movies where the guy was half-robot half-cop, geez, I love those movies—any who, yes, I’m a special agent, under a project funded by the NYPD. You see, they wanted to make the perfect detective and of course, I’m the perfect specimen…” He broke to flash Steve a charming ear to ear grin with his pearly whites, “Before this I was a detective, one of the best in the business if I do say so myself.” He wasn’t. In fact, Tony was far from it, sure he was one of the smartest but there was a difference in being a desk jockey and actually taking to the field. “I used to make gadgets, all the time and use them in my work.” That part was true. Tony was once a detective famed for his ingenuity. “One day, while chasing down an infamous crook – Victor Von Doom—I was, well, it was a car accident. My wheels went off the road and then there ya have it, with the work of a great doctor though, using some schematics we’d put together beforehand it’d turned me into… Me. Part machine, part human.”
“Norman, up to your old tricks again?!” Tony shouted, coughing a bit as the smoke seeped through the eyeslits of the mask, causing him to shut his eyes tightly before they began to water.
“That sounds best, so it’ll just have to be us. Who do we have? Carol, Natasha, Thor, Clint, Janet, Steve and of course… Moi.” Tony puffed out his chest proudly as he tried to take control of the situation in the way that Steve would. “So you return to the others, Vision, tell them where we are.”
Tony caught the way his jaw shivered, the way his pupils dilated and body tensed. “Come back Steve… I need you,” he whispered to him, his eyes going tear-bright at the image before him.
“I’m not going to lie to you and say that I don’t enjoy Captain America calling me Director, but I’m not keen on the role. I like helping, being out there, doing more than just sitting in an office, and you being around and me using you as an excuse to get out there has made me… Well, it’s lit the fire again, so to speak.”
The little hologram on the table showed them presenting the idea to a committee and receiving a round of applause, the image suddenly changing to a beautiful young looking girl which Tony stared ever so fondly at.
“ENOUGH!” It shouted before typing something frantically into the command pad it was using to keep the chair afloat. “Psionic blaster!” It shouted, a bright pink beam shooting out of the gem that sat in the middle of his forehead, connecting it to the chair.
He was walking inside with Tony just a few footsteps behind him before he spotted it hanging from the ceiling – A P-64, a fighter plane, on full display, bullet holes and all. Seeing it there gave him a chance to actually admire it, as opposed to when he’d step foot in the air base he’d either be shooed away or have to watch them fly overhead. Then not too far away was a Light Tank M2 in all of its glory. Proud and sturdy, and yet, Steve could pick out the weaknesses in the armour of the tank and where exactly the enemies would strike. He’d not seen many of these on the field himself, they didn’t really last too long either, but taking a look at it close up made all of the memories rush back to him as if it were just recently. He could almost hear the loud clunk of the engines as these rolled by the usually wet terrains. Tony stood with his arms folded, staring at Steve who seemed at that point like a child in a candy store, spoiled for choice, surrounded by everything he could want.
Spiderman wasn’t about to leave Tony there, he swung in with the soles of his feet facing Carol and booted her off the fallen knight with a ‘Huzzah.’ All of the commotion didn’t go unnoticed, in the distance of the buildings Tony could see people peering through their windows at the brawl even through the hazy double vision he was experiencing.
The blond nudged Tony’s beautiful ebony strands out of his face using his nose, pressing a number of kisses to his temple, smoothly removing his fingers. Tony let out a grunt at the loss of them, already feeling a strange emptiness, but that was only temporary. Steve angled himself between Tony’s wide legs (amazed at how flexible he really was). For a moment he kneeled up and kissed along Tony’s legs, as though he were praising them, placing gentle kisses to the inside of his thighs. Tony was still flustered, his throat dry, hands idly rubbing along his own body having missed how Steve’s body draped over him provided him with a sense of warmth that nothing could ever replace.
The rumble of thunder outside and heavy rain hitting the windows was the only sound that Tony could hear at that moment, his eyes opening again weakly, turning to look at the room. He saw tubes that resembled stasis tubes, spotting Peter inside, Bucky in another, Rhodey, Sam, T’Challa… There were dozens of them, all lining the wall that reached to the peak of the tower. With his mouth agape, his hand weakly crawled over the floor, trying to gesture to them.
“No, those wings, you better believe it pal, you’re an angel.” Steve replied as he attempted to swallow down his nervousness, though his bright pink cheeks were making it far too obvious as Tony stood so close to him that their chests almost touched. His wings fluttered and even the tips of the feathers turned pink. Tony noticed right away how the light seemed to go a strange red around Steve and pursed his lips in thought.
Steve stared for a moment with contemplation. Raising his head and giving Tony that stare that he was used to, that stare that meant yes without vocalising it. “We’re not in the same dimension. How do you expect this will work?”
Along came JARVIS, scooting along and dragging MODOK in a tangle of wires along with that fluffy cat that Doom had as his companion, also tangled in the wires, screeching loudly in protest as she was bundled into the back of a police van with Doom and MODOK, doors slamming shut. Though JARVIS didn’t escape without scratches all over his screen and frame – luckily titanium enforced alloy could easily withstand the constant scratching of a rebellious evil cat.
“Remember what I said Buck, usin’ up ammo like that s’gonna get you into trouble! Be wise with your shots!”
No, it was Osborn’s fault, Norman Osborn had made him do this. He pushed him to his limits, and it was only with Tony saving him from the control that he was freed from the prisons of his mind.
Doing a U turn, he flew back toward where he had lost Steve, looking from side to side but seeing nothing but fallen web tendrils attached to the skyscrapers. Everything looked the same, every building had the same sterile look to it – they were all tall, sharp edges, square windows. He could’ve sworn if he counted the number of windows each building would have exactly the same. When he was mentioning a sci-fi Nazi scenario in his mind earlier he didn’t realise how everything started to be fitting into that exact setting the more he looked into it. Everything looked identical and lacked colour – in fact, the most colour he’d seen all day was in the ruins of the dingy hospital.
The blond grimaced, his hair falling over his face, feeling a crack in what must’ve been his lower rib. So his suspicions were correct, Tony’s own serum which he had vaguely and briefly mentioned were an improvement on his own. Steve was the test subject and Tony was the improved version, but if they thought that would stop Steve or put doubt in his mind, they were sorely mistaken. “Nothing beats the original…” He coughed, spluttering speckles of blood on the floor.
Steve looked at the artefacts that resided in their own cases, wanting to reach out and touch them but being restricted from doing so, which once more sent a dull ache coursing through his chest.  He needed a distraction, and quick, which was what, brought Tony to his attention. He took a few quick strides to catch him up then flashed a tiny nostalgic smile at the contents of the display that the dark haired man was focused on. “That one is one of the guns we used to infiltrate a Hydra base back near the East of Frankfurt.”
“They’re blaming Tony for this!? But it can’t have been him, I went into the lab, I didn’t see any killer robot, I just saw little helper robots. HELEN, do you know anything about this?”
Tony’s eyes welled up with tears, but it was as though he was trying so very hard to restrain them from flowing. No child should ever have to hold their tears back like that, Steve thought to himself. His eyes were fixed on Tony with concern, kneeling down next to him, “Tony… I’m sorry, Tony I am… Please… I wish I could help you…”
“I’m going to need to go to the lab to get it fixed and…” He tilted to the side to try and take a glance at their car, noticing he smoke wafting up from under the bonnet where it was clumsily parked. “I think we ought to go to the lab to get that fixed anyway, before Chief Fury makes us do all our patrols by foot. I mean it’s not a problem for me, but something tells me you want to be in
! We’ll get her down in a jiffy, especially now that I’m on the case.” He hovered, floating up to the tree. “Now kitty kitty, see, I’ve got whiskers too.” He gestured to his goatee, before a leaf brushed by. The cat was approaching Tony, taking slow cautious steps on the tall tree branch whilst Steve observed keenly, worried about Tony when the leaf brushed by his nose again.
“I’ve seen it first hand, the way you used to beseech me for help, when you thought I was just a superhero right? You were a kid…”
“That’s why we have help.” Carol stated, brushing off her blazer as she stood up and out of her car, gesturing behind her to the two men ushering the citizens to safety, one wearing a green bandana on his head looking rather stylish and the other in a uniform that was probably two sizes too small for him.
“I’m not asking to be cared for, Steve, I’m just grateful when it happens. And it doesn’t happen often.” Maybe it was the concussion that was giving him this bout of vocal honesty, but for once he just felt safe, he felt safe with Steve next to him, tending to him. “If I care for someone I show it, because who knows how long you have with them.”
“It’s not an obligation!” Tony quickly snapped. “It’s something I want to do, and I get to learn more about you in the process, exchanging info, isn’t that a fair trade? If you don’t like what I have to tell you then SHIELD won’t force you to work with us, if you do, then we can help you.”
“You were brainwashed… That’s why your head was hurting, there was a chip…” His hand reached behind Steve’s neck and lightly touched his fingertips to his neck, just over the wound but not touching it enough to cause him pain again. “…Here.”
Fury cleared his throat, standing with authority in front of his office, a cigar hanging between his teeth while he pushed back his greys. Just the sound of his throat clearing managed to silence the buzz of noise around the precinct. “Listen to Carol. We need to stop that thing from walking down the street actin’ like it owns the joint! Everyone, get your asses down there ASAP! Take it down and make sure that Stark comes back in cuffs!”
But they didn’t just go to one gallery that day; they went to many, going from gallery to gallery and of course, stopping off for ice cream.
As he was running, his legs began to stiffen, and he had to slow down. His body was being weighed down and his new legs certainly weren’t co-operating, realising now more than ever that it was taking so much sheer energy to move onward. The slow-down was noticed by Tony just before he grabbed Steve’s hand and tugged him to give him more momentum to carry his heavy metal legs. “Come on, Steve!”
“Death Valley, it had to be a location named so ominously.” He lamented to his computer systems as his black and golden armour shimmered in the scorching beams of sunlight that parried off the metallic surface, casting offshoots of light even as he flew with such rapidity that not even a grain of sand beneath him was shaken.
Then it was Tony and Steve’s turn, with Tony using his makeshift repulsor and blasting any few drones that were missed. Steve decided to take a leaf out of all of the kickboxing training he’d done in the past, and use the strength and force of his newly acquired metal legs while he chose to throw a number of kicks at the bots, whipping out his shield that they’d retrieved from the mansion ruins, and spinning it out to decapitate the bots that flew his way angrily.
“Deactivate!” He gestured, watching the suit fall. At least he’d managed to regain control of it, but his hands instantly went to his neck, feeling the sharp pain as he too fell back in the corner of his lab, trembling. He needed to work harder; he needed to get this bot back to its normal state. He couldn’t just give up on it, especially since his other suits were destroyed, but he felt a strange link to it ever since the day he had first put it on after recovering it – after masses of procrastination he managed to use the suit for the first time, and felt it access his memories, his pains, his happiness, and now he felt closer to it than ever. And just when he was getting more comfortable with using it, it does this.
Tony’s hands ran over his throat, just smoothing over the bump of his Adams Apple where he felt a huge gulp that must have sounded obnoxiously loud. Reeds hand reached to press his palm against Tony’s back, holding him, preventing him from falling back further.
The director glared with a sharp intensity.  He didn’t fully understand why that annoyed him so much; after all, she was right. He didn’t know anything about the real Captain America; he didn’t even know he was still alive after all these years.  Tony would be sure to research it all, dig up all he can from those hidden files especially since he was in the facility.
Hours of talk after the long initial silence had ended them back in the USA, in New Orleans to be more specific. Getting transferred from plane to car and getting taken to the museum. Tony was exhausted, dozing off in the car journey while Steve remained distracted by the sights that passed by in a quick hazy flurry.
“Hey hey now.” Tony said with a pout, looking up at Tony, “I do believe you, it’s just angels I don’t believe in. I trust you with all of my heart Steve, as cheesy as that sounds.”
They both looked from side to side, searching for more people but it seemed that they had taken care of that. What concerned Tony was the fact that with one simple prompt, they changed from mindless drones to killing machines. He needed to find what was making them trigger like that, and how to stop it, and clearly they were running out of time. If they’d activated these guys, it was like poking a beehive, and they were right in the centre of it.
They were all inferior. Every single person that doubted him and his abilities were inferior and unworthy.
The car’s engine revved loudly, the tires spinning so quickly that a cloud formed behind them as it roared into life, front wheels lifting off the ground before it sped off into the distance. Steve clutched onto the dashboard while the car reared like a horse, yelping with surprise before it zoomed down the highway.
He jogged over and held out a hand to the man, though at that moment he was questioning what part of him was really ‘man’, first he flew into the office, then he had that thing poking out of his head and just moments ago he flew up to the tree with those mysterious jet boots that Steve was pretty sure only existed in the movies that he liked to watch.
In response there was a lot of ‘that’s true’, seeming to be the general consensus. People were actually agreeing, posing that as the reason that people were afraid or weary of Tony in the first place.
“What?! What, what is it, what happened?!” Peter said as he pushed the curtain that separated them back and saw the skull.
“I’ll be your eyes, don’t worry.” Steve reassured him, bending his knees slightly into a crouch so he could move when the shadow finally revealed itself.
Tony explained quickly. “Zola captured and chained Steve to this huge table, and he kept injecting him with sedatives. That’s my best guess, though…the discharge was black. I figured it must’ve been the repercussion of Zola-brand sedatives.” He shuddered for a moment.
The last thing Tony could remember was leaving Steve at the designated drop-off point, waiting until he saw the Captain charge in full-force before following Hammer’s signal to the factory.
“Why don’t we show them the tribute room?” Steve nudged Tony and placed a hand on his shoulder, rubbing it softly.
There was a powerful surge that shot through Steve’s arm augmentation, zipping up his body and through his armour. A huge shock that send him straight into convulses. Immediately the armoured soldier yanked his arm back out of the cavity in Tony’s chest, causing the fallen man to choke at the abrupt removal. Trails of blood streaked through the air from the crimson covered robotic arm. Steve’s entire body began to shake violently, and Tony had only hoped that the force was strong enough to fry whatever was controlling him. He could hear the chattering of teeth, the trembling sound of shaking metal. Opening his eyes as much as he could to watch Steve, even though that only pained him more.
“Carol, I get you’re supposed to be a big decorated Air Force vet, but you’re talkin’ to me here. I know what I’m doin’. All’z I know is these bots can’t be trusted, never could be. Stark’s caused us nothing but trouble since day one.”
Steve blinked. He saw no tripod, no huge box, but he decided to see where this was going. Tony pivoted on his heel, taking a few steps back and holding out his square black phone with a giant Stark Industries label plastered on its cover.
Horror surged through his body. A gut wrenching agony echoed throughout his frame, his teeth chattering, golden brown eyes narrowed only to prevent tears from spilling but that alone was a fruitless effort; the tears began to spill, warm drops trickling down his cheeks. His throat closed and he found his breathing hitched.
He flipped the small chip in his hand, shutting his dark blue eyes and throwing it to one side as he walked to the cabinet that he had locked up, yanking the padlock off and opening the cupboard to pull out a bottle of classic Jack Daniels.
“We were taking down Hammer, turns out he’s not alone. He’s got The Purple Man with him…” Tony replied solemnly. “We’re going to take them both down; they’re working on something big.”
That made him wonder; was this chip that was to prevent neural damage actually causing it rather than preventing it?
Steve, as flustered as he was, nodded, glad that Tony knew what the priority was and found himself making his way down to Tony’s lab.
The huge doors opened with the loudest of creaks and the room was bathed in an emerald light, the same green that was Victor’s signature colour. At least by then Tony knew that he was on the right path.
“No…” he whispered, pushing the gate open and running into the courtyard, staring at what was around him. He decided to go with his gut, as twisted as it was at that very second, and ran inside.
Tony needed to see the destruction with his own eyes. His heart rushed with panic as he dropped the sole of his foot to the floor with a large clank. He staggered toward the window with a jerky limp, trying to get used to the new weight that dragged his footing down toward a broken boarded up window, tearing away the card as quickly as he could and looking out into the city. It looked worse than just a napalm bombing; it looked like it’d been hit by a nuke. There were, however, a couple of large skyscrapers standing, ones that he had never seen before.
Tony pursed his lips and sighed. “Well, hopefully you’ll find whatever it is you’re looking for in the desert.”
Tony rolled his eyes once more and waited for Spiderwoman to slip off her bright yellow glove to reveal a metal hand that resembled a claw in its design. It certainly wasn’t as realistic as Tony’s was, and had a lot of damage. There were chips along the fingers and the palm made a soft buzzing that was earlier masked by the rubber texture of her glove. Tony held her hand in his own and took off his single gauntlet, to reach into his suit and pull out a tool that he would keep within a small plate beneath the shoulder, just in case. It weighed virtually nothing because it was just a piece of acrylic that was shaped for the convenience of a multifaceted screwdriver. His suit was prone to malfunctions so he had to be prepared in the most resourceful way.
“Prestige power self-affirmation, that’s all you seek, that will never make you happy!” Tony screamed.  “Trust me, Osborn! You’re beyond repair now, you’re completely out of your depth. You’ll have nothing but loneliness!”
“Who goes there!” He yelled, knowing for well it was Steve, but he was never one to pass up the role-play.
There he was, gripping him tightly, arms wrapped around his back and holding him. His angel had returned and once again saved him from the decent to hell before the flames had a chance to kiss his skin.
There it was ahead of him, the opening to the city, and he snatched the sack he had left there when he was yanked away by Carol into his arms, cradling it under one arm as he ran forward. As he lifted his head, slipping his faceplate on, he saw a distant shadow running toward them. It was huge, tailing after a burly man who moved with heavy footsteps. As he came closer, they could catch sight at his expression; no, he wasn’t one of them. He looked like a civilian, but something was clearly amiss. For a moment they stood as Peter crouched on the floor, not willing to get any higher than he was. Carol hovered protectively above him, her arms held out and ready to strike, Jessica followed Carol’s position and whipped back her long black hair, hands ready in a stance.
He coughed, hearing footsteps by the door once more and turning to it with shock to see Steve standing there, with a slightly swollen jaw. “You think I’m going to let you run away from a fight? You can’t just hit me and expect me to not get a reason why, a real reason!” Steve demanded.
Chief Fury was in full uniform, with badges and ribbons decorating his lapel, with further decoration on his shoulders to signify his higher rank. Steve was certainly no stranger to authority like that, and tried not to stare at the eyepatch the man had either covering his left eye with the string tucked neatly behind his grey sideburns. He was quite the sight, clearly a war veteran that had turned to helping out the police.
If Taskmaster was tied up, Steve could get to him later. Steve pulled at the tight wire-lined ropes and wrapped a loop around Taskmaster a few times, then around the lamp post, before making one of the tightest knots he could muster around the back of the street light.
The first few weeks of the process were the most complicated and involved installing a new type of machinery that Stark Industries had only just brought out, but SHIELD wasn’t happy with the regulation machinery. Of course, they had to adapt it and modify it for their purposes which involved an array of mechanics tinkering with the inner workings of it all to create a simulator that could create the surroundings that they wanted. This wasn’t just for training or recreation of something small, it was creating an entire world dated back to the 1940’s, all in the head of Steve Rogers.
The doors behind him closed and he quickly smacked one of the buttons to turn the glass that he was staring through into completely opaque blinds. Tony jumped to his feet and looked behind him, still jumpy with his eyes darting behind him to look at whoever decided to waltz in.
Steve stopped and stared in awe for a moment, taking in the sight. This wasn’t just a pillow fort, this was a pillow castle with everyone’s sheets, blankets and pillows all positioned carefully to make a structure that actually resembled a castle. It was huge, proud, well thought out and of course was the brainchild of none other than Tony Stark.
The seconds felt like hours for that one moment. Finally the vitals flashed up in bright cyan, some with red accents to confirm.
Tony spotted the shift of the shadow and stared up at the pale skinned, tall man that stood in front of him. Even through a blur of tears he saw him, he saw that tear skim down his bloodless skin, a dark track left in place of it. He drew himself closer and pressed both hands against the glass, only for Steve to mimic him and do the same, staring so pleadingly.
He turned, slowly, to meet the bright azure eyes that stared at him with a stern glare. He backed off quickly and stood with his back to the cabinet behind him, his palms resting on the worktop for support as he dropped the bottle that leaked the dark drink.
“Cap..? CAP!” Bucky was trying to yell over the loud sound below them and from the barrel of his gun. This wasn’t the first time Steve had suffered from shellshock, in fact it was becoming increasingly worse, but the situation that they were in was the worst time on earth for him to be suffering from it. “Snap out of it!” He yelled, kicking the last Hydra agent away before placing his hand either side of his Captain and shaking his shoulders.
“That’s a given, you realise we’re dealing with Norman Osborn. I thought you would know him better than anyone else,” Tony replied.
Tony almost jumped when he felt something brush by his leg; a fat looking cat scampered by, meowing and hissing at the two as it dashed by, seemingly not caring about its owner for the time being. But it had one thing in mind as it ran into the previous room – it was going straight for JARVIS.
Doom spun on his heel, leaning in until he was inches from Reed’s face. “He is nothing but a tin man to me!” He pulled back, shaking his head. “I have always been capable of creating more superior creatures, robots with far more potential than being lackeys for the police. I could make an unstoppable army for my country – Latveria.”
“Then I’ll heal you completely, every wound, every pain, every nightmare – I promise you, I’ll take them all away.”
The heat rose to Tony’s already flushed expression, staring through long lashes at the man and his adoring gestures.
Steve grit his teeth and tried to turn to his side, grabbing Tony’s boot only for a repulsor to be directed right at him.
Half of the words were swallowed by the static, the other half were inaudible. Steve did all he could to relay the message but he wasn’t sure what exactly he was dealing with, or why the puppeteer decided to control those villains, but it did occur to him that one of the villains they were dealing with wasn’t exactly subject to influence; a Doombot. Robots couldn’t fall under the powers of the master of persuasion.
“I’ve been to Paris, in fact, I visit France extremely regularly. You’re a wanted criminal; I remember seeing your ugly mug plastered all over Charles du Gaulle airport!”
“Don’t mention it; now don’t prove me wrong okay? There’s probably a pot going around somewhere in the building for how long you’ll last. I’ll be sure to put myself in for the last slot, don’t let me down.” She held up her mug to him.
“Puh-lease,” he chucked, hopping off Tony’s bed and  returning to his own, looking at Tony’s hand as it moved back and forth with ease, relieved that his work was actually functioning, even though Tony was guiding him, it was somewhat of an accomplishment. He rest on his own bed, patting it out and lying flat with his arms behind his head.
“No, you don’t understand.” He paused, plucking up the courage to look into the demonic eyes of his own creation. “He makes me a better man, and I make him a better man. We help each other, we take from each other, that’s what friends are, that’s what lovers do, they hold each other’s hands – they don’t coerce them into becoming the same person, because what makes them appealing are their differences, their quirks!”
Tony felt his augmented arm spark, sending a shiver through his body, that spark carried on and shot through Steve’s hand and met with the exact same spark that rose up from his legs. Their eyes opened, both of them, glowing a bright blue for a second as they stood up together, hand in hand, connected by a force from their new limbs.
Everything was set up and in place within the next few hours. The others had been working hard on finding the correct chemical composition that would be compatible with Steve’s system, while Tony worked on a new bot to administer the new sedative. Once the elaborate set up was complete, Tony kept his eyes on the man labelled ‘patient zero’ by the systems that Reed had programmed.
“Stick to Tony.” He smiled, feeling the need for a friendlier introduction, as late as it may have been.
“Hold on.” Steve held up his finger, waggling it at Tony. “Don’t get any ideas. And since when have you actually ventured into the laundry room? You’re the guy who just dumps it in your lab and gets your bots to clean it up.”
There was a rumble from the back seat and the little robotic dog poked its head between the two seats at the front, “Actually, it wasn’t moments, Sir. You’d worked on her previously just in case I failed. According to my calculations you spent days working on her…”
Again, processing the information; Doom had been a possible culprit, but if that wasn’t the case now, then who else? A register ran through his head, but he couldn’t think of anyone that was this capable of doing such a thing, or a motive behind it.
“I’m going to look around…” Tony whispered, pulling back and letting Peter pay his respects. He needed to see who else had died but most of all, he needed to find the stone he was looking for. Taking long, careful strides to weave between the disorganised stones, he set his eyes on a range of names that he was familiar with;
Steve’s eyes opened, staring at the man and then placing the palm of his metal hand to Tony’s face, again wishing that he could truly feel him again. “How’re you feeling?” He asked.
“You have no idea.” He said, guiding Steve’s hand up with his own, allowing the man to lightly take grip of Tony’s length, sliding his fingers up and down. There was a soft hum from Steve’s reactor, and that light vibration that ran through his clockwork and circuitry could be felt. There was a light pulsation as Steve merely held him, making his lips part and his breathing becoming rougher. “My Steve…”
perfect.” He quite openly said, immediately noticing Steve’s cheeks flush pink. “But me on the other hand…”
Then the armour emitted a loud sound emulating the sound of guns, old guns. It knew, of course it knew, it had been in Tony’s mind all this time. The sound of bullets echoed through its speakers and it made him flash back to when he was on the field, racing through his memories, the nights he spent trying to keep his friends and innocent civilians alive by fighting over and over for them. Then the rocket, but instead of seeing Bucky he could hear Tony’s voice from the time in the lab –
“Nothin’, s’not important. Let’s get going.” Tony flicked his antennae, “I’m pickin’ up a new job… Another kitten, down by the fancy houses…” Maybe he was a little too used to being called a ‘thing’, but it wasn’t his fault – but Steve didn’t know that. Anyway, Tony’s priority was not to get too attached, partners like this one always left for one reason or another, he was just counting the seconds now.
Steve’s body became motionless after Tony spoken, his head hung again, but his body maintaining a slight tremble. Then he lay very still…completely still after another moment. Tony could feel his heart begin to sink once more, just wishing that he’d had a second chance. But just as he was about to become resigned to the thought, he spotted Steve’s eyelashes fluttering.
“Jessica, if you know anything, it’s what it’s like for your identity to be mistaken. Skrulls, remember all of that? You know, just… Trust me, there’s nothing I can do to prove to you that I am real, that I’m the guy that apparently didn’t die in the explosion. But lemme show you this.”
Tony was squeamish when it came to the sight of his own blood, even after all these years; let alone damaging himself in that way. But he knew it was for his own good, so he carried on, at one point it began to get so painful that he stopped, taking a deep breath and reaching for a small stone to bite on while he continued so that his yelps would be muffled. Sweat dripped down his temple, but was quickly washed away thanks to the rain. Annoyingly the two prominent pokes of hair that would stand up were now matted down to his forehead, heavy and soaked with rain, and meant he had to keep flicking his head, but he’d managed eventually – wiring in the copper wires to his arm and then forcing it up so it slotted into his shoulder perfectly. To get it to fit, he had to remove his chest piece which was done in a press of a button. Luckily it slipped into its compact holding form which was half of a briefcase, as shoddy as that case looked due to all the damage on it, it wasn’t worth keeping when it just collapsed into a poorly formed mess. His armour was destroyed, leaving him more vulnerable than ever. Luckily he had his new arm. This would just have to do.
Steve let out a quiet chuckle that resonated with more confusion than anything else, trying to get himself together, looking around at the passers-by, and going about their day as though nothing happened.
Steve persisted with his maneuvers, trying his hardest to keep close to reach into the car eventually and stop the driver by force, but all he could do was push it.
Peter thwipped at thin tendril of webbing toward the fallen chip and reeled it closer to examine, then passed it to Carol.
after that entire fiasco. His heart was still drumming, even as he held Steve over his shoulder, switching once both of his hands were free to carry him bridal style. Steve looped his arms around Tony’s neck for security, watching as the golden faceplate slipped over once more and Tony made his way out the same way he had come in, this time with his friend resting there in his arms.
“So… Tony, you going to show us around a little?” Reed suggested, trying to change the topic of conversation even though it was difficult to with Tony standing there with his shirt wide open, and Steve with his head turned, hiding his face. It was absolutely amazing how the Captain would change from this confident commanding character to extremely bashful when he was exposed like that. Not that everyone didn’t know already.
“I did some scouting before we got here when I was trying to find the others, they’re definitely all stationed in the top floor labs,” Janet breathed, tucking her short hair neatly behind her ears while she moved to sit on Tony’s shoulder instead, just for the time being.
Steve tilted his head back, noticing where Tony’s eyes were going. It didn’t take a genius to put it together.
The armour let out a yell of frustration, placing its searing hot repulsor-lit palm to Tony’s face, making the man tilt it to a side, but despite his efforts to escape the heat, he could feel the burn, he could taste it too.  He pulled at the restraints that were extremely tight, so much so that he could feel the ropes start to cut into his wrists when he was moving them.
“Incompatibility with upgrades. System failure.” The Captain swung his arm up and kept it directed to her, firing a powerful shot which she countered with her own, screeching with a mix of agony and pure corruption. She switched to dive at them, Tony ducking out of the way this time as Steve grabbed her with ease and slammed her to the ground. He didn’t stop there; mercilessly he swung her from side to side until metal shards flew from her face, cracks appearing in the newly fitted plate.
Steve tried to turn his head to catch a glimpse of what was happening behind him but two large claws shot out from the wall and grabbed his chin and forehead, dragging him as far back into the wall as he could, a loud metal clank echoed when his cranium was brought forcefully against the glowing segment of the wall.
Caps head was hung, his mop of blond hair shadowing his eyes, body slumped forward and only held by the restraints that kept him pinned to the glowing mass behind him. Blood trickled over those delicate heart shaped lips that Tony had once pressed his own to.
“I miss flying. I could’ve been there in two seconds flat.” He mumbled while walking, head low and focused on his hand. His mind drifted back to the armour he had to discard earlier before sifting through the rubble, sighing at the loss.
“So what, you’re saying that these supervillains that don’t know each other are just banding together and fighting? This is hardly the Cabal, these are just random villains,” Carol stated, her gloved hand just over her chin, eyes narrowed with a deep perplexed look that seemed to be the resonating theme throughout the rest of the Avengers in the room.
His irises lit to cyan, that ring appearing as he stared at the command keys trying to find some way to break the encryptions using Extremis, which was harder than he had thought. It wasn’t exactly technopathy, but it was damn close. The two lab assistants attempted to position themselves to block the door, but they knew they weren’t as big as people that Tony had faced before, they were no Juggernaut or King Pin. The bolts made a loud clicking sound, unlocking and Tony’s eyes faded to their regular colour, placing the briefcase that he held down for the moment and gave them a light push back to get in. They put up as much resistance as they could but everyone had seen what Iron Man was capable of, they dare not push against him but they did try their best to hold him back.
Their bodies were colliding with force, slipping against each other in a clumsy mess, but so focused on giving one another the most pleasure they possibly could. Though just being with Steve was enough to send Tony to the moon and back. His tip was leaking down his stiffness and onto Steve’s front the closer he pressed. Tony’s grip moved to Steve’s thighs, unable to drown out the moans as he held on as tightly as he could, hair swaying back with drops of sweat making their movements much slicker even as time went on. He was sure his rear was raw and red, but regardless, he was filled with such need.
“What the hell happened?” Steve helped Tony try to scramble to his feet, but he caught sight of him clutching his side, immediately his hands reached for it, to help support him.
“Need a shower big guy? We can get you showered up… You’ll be all fresh and clean and you’ll feel better.”
Steve’s words began to sound more coherent and less frequent, which was a good sign. Although he still had that glazed look in his eyes, that was probably the repercussion from the chip that Tony had torn at so roughly, but he was going to make sure that all the correct wires were intact, praying that this air borne neural toxin wasn’t making Steve spout these words.
Attaching it to any bolt he could find then trying to do the same to Tony’s chest plate was much harder; a simpler design meant he could barely find a wire amongst the solid steel blocks. Eventually he did, and he took a deep breath as he began to feel Tony’s reactor reach through the wire for power, as though he were sucking out energy through a straw.
Tony shook his head, holding his arm out for Peter to follow wherever he pointed, trying to ask him to move wires and then place the chip exactly where Tony told him to, then carefully closed it as instructed.
“Don’t touch me…” He wrapped his arms around himself, hanging his head a little, taking deep breaths. It was abnormally uncharacteristic of him to refuse help like that, especially when he was so eager to get out of there.
Instead of going for Steve’s leg right away, he dismantled the bots legs, pulling them off only to notice a garish ‘HAMMER’ logo painted across the side of each calf. He grimaced, reaching for the stone he was using for cutting and striking it out the same way someone would key a car.
“Make him watch…” Hammer said, and just like that the Purple Man snapped his fingers with glee. Tony’s head jerked to the side, his eyes forced wide as if pins were holding prying his eyelids open. He could feel his eyes burning, watering – he needed to blink but the invisible toothpicks holding his eyes open were preventing it. The blade forced itself down lower and lower, tearing into his muscle with a loud
“I know that’s why… I trust you. Because you and I have more in common than you can believe, we have what makes us unique, but we also have each other…”
He swallowed down his pride for a moment and placed his hand to Steve’s jaw, being light with his touch. “I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to call you a relic.”
“Guy with a sock for a mask got to the place. We’ve been living in a revamped hydro-plant since, and now I’ve managed to rebuild it all. Now it’s just up to the others to move in once they’ve managed to detach themselves from their current living situation. To be honest I didn’t want to open it all or let anyone stay here just yet, I’ve got a few more finishing touches to add but it’s mostly finished.”
“Upgrades? Is that what that was, Steve?” Tony attempted talking to him as though things had never changed, when they clearly had.
His head turned to the bot that he had dismantled before to create himself his own functioning arm. If he could do the same for Steve he knew he’d be able to walk again. So once more, despite the exhaustion, he pulled himself to his feet, dragging them and the stone from fallen rubble under his feet, reaching for the bot and dragging it back to Steve.
“Good luck getting in there, that place is like fort Knox,” Taskmaster chuckled darkly, walking back into the shade of the alley and leaping over a wall with ease.
He was hitting his spot over and over, Steve letting Tony’s legs slip off his shoulders and ensuring that they were wrapped around his hips and continuing thrusting in and out of him powerfully, groaning in sync with Tony.
“Tony I want your wings to be normal again; I want to take you up there with me, up to those gates.” He said, pulling back and opening his eyes, staring into Tony’s wide sapphire eyes.
“Come on Shellhead; let’s go get the team together. T’Challa’s sent out a signal, we’re going to assemble.”
Once Jessica had scrambled off Carol, she got to her feet, Carol striding up to the fallen bot and punching her fist through a huge sheet of metal to sever its head from the rest of its body. She knelt down and pulled out some of the chips.
It didn’t take long for the woman to get to her feet, spinning around and zooming toward them like a bull with a red flag waved in front of it, her eyes glowing, red shimmering lights glowing in the darkness. Tony noticed that the sun was starting to rise, peeking through the corner of the window that he was thrown to, not that he had time to admire it. He was being thrown out with Peter alongside him with the powerful woman having a tight grip of both of their necks. The remainder of the glass that was attached to the pane shattered upon impact as though it were sugar glass.
If he wasn’t in front of Nick, he probably would’ve burst out into tears and threw a table at the nearest wall. As it was, he just slumped against the wall, exhausted.
The cameras flashed as the paparazzi flooded around the gate of Doom’s mansion, the loud sounds of shutters clicking as they took photo after photo of Chief Fury by the gates, standing next to Reed Richards who had already been escorted out of the mansion, wrapped in a trauma blanket with a beautiful blond woman cradling him lovingly (though truth be told, she did look annoyed when he’d first been taken out of the mansion, but Tony could tell that annoyance was with love). Steve and Tony both walked out either side of Doom, holding the man in special cuffs that Tony had made for just the occasion.
Steve walks in just behind him with a hand on his back, taking in his reaction. He can’t tell whether Tony is shocked in the bad sense or good, just yet.
“Oh am I? People often say I’m devilish but I’m fine with being an angel.” He said with a coy smirk, moving closer to Steve and looking up at him. They’d always go through the same routine; they’d get really close, particularly whenever Tony spotted Steve blushing. It was an adorable trait of his that Tony loved to exploit and tease him over.  But he’d only do this when they were alone, because in actuality, he did want it to go a step further but it was up to the Captain to make the first move; traditionally resulting in Steve blushing and pulling back, but that never stopped Tony from trying, in fact he enjoyed it too much to resist it.
He pushed through the rain, moving far too quickly for the droplets to have a chance to settle on the smooth metal as he cut through the air, catching the light of the lightening whenever it struck. It was all so vivid in his mind, as though he were going through it at that moment. Tails of blue left in the sky while he flew to his target and landed, cautiously by the entrance.
And it wasn’t long, not until they had finally reached the top of the huge tower that Tony had first taken Steve to, taking him right to the top where he placed them down on the balcony; a tiny ledge he’d built just for this purpose – to share the view with someone that he loved.
There was a reason Tony didn’t want to remove his shirt. There was also a reason that he hadn’t been working in his regular tank top these last few weeks.
“Tony!” Steve gasped, staring back at him, placing his hand under his chin and looking from eye to eye to make sure that he didn’t have a concussion. “Tony, speak to me, can you see anything?”
He stood, clipping the new boot on, followed by the rest of his armour. Although it had a couple of dents, and some cracks, he knew it would be enough to hold its own.
Steve knew from the moment that he’d met the officer that she was as hard as nails, and certainly knew right from wrong. She knew that they were innocent, as did the others. It was a relief not to be chased by the people he’d been learning to trust these last few days.
While Steve was content with the first bot, the second had finally made its way around it when it loomed over Steve who was crouched over the fallen metal frame. This was the moment that Tony began to grind his back teeth nervously, if it didn’t work he’d have to build a new bot. Having to do that would cost time that the treatment team simply didn’t have. It slid the top bar forward with a minute click. Tony knew that sound attracted Steve, like an animal, so he had to make the movements of the second as quiet as possible. At this point Tony could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears. Even a pin drop could be heard like a loud bell-ring to Tony at that second in time. When the top bar slid open, the hatch was revealed, and the syringe slowly lifted from it.
“Shh…” Tony whispered. “I hear reports of a bank robber, just downtown! He’s gettin’ away, there are other cops assigned to the chase but they’re still on it, you know if we go now we could beat them to it!”
“Okay, okay! I give!” he yelped in surrender. “He’s… Through that door…” He pointed to one of the main doors.
“Probably in his room polishing his boots.” Tony mumbled. “Why? You’re not going to bring him down here, are you?” Protective didn’t quite cover it, he didn’t want Steve to be made a test subject for no reason, unless the two were completely sure that something was wrong.
His wings spread, body entirely relaxed as he opened his eyes to savour the moment of bliss. Just as he managed to take a glance at how pure they appeared to be, he noticed a black feather. His attention now turned toward it, the engineer that strived for perfection reached nimbly toward it and plucked it for his wings to be completely white. The wings shuddered and from where he had plucked it, a liquid metal started to seep, corrupting feather after feather and covering each one with a metal plate. He stared, mesmerised by the way the liquid had engulfed him. He knew he needed to get to the light above him, so he pushed his body toward it, but his wings kept him back, the weight was too much. The shimmering metal coat began to generate strange orange bumps on its surface, copper taking over and sending dragging him back down. Tony tried as much as he could to fight it, panicking, pushing against it but the rusted, corroding wings sent him crashing to the floor.
Steve nodded understandingly, wanting to explore this new lab but he had to hold himself back from tinkering with anything, especially since almost everything in that lab looked so delicate. His leg shifted, but just as he was about to move he felt something brush against it, so he peered down to see a metallic dog staring back up at him.
He sighed and continued, explaining, “There’s a bomb planted in the centre of New York City. But whoever did it, wasn’t planning on being discrete about it. It’s huge, right on the top of the Empire State.”
He lived for the future; he lived to build a better world, to design and construct and mould his creations. He wanted to bring them to life as a master puppeteer to make the world a better place to live for everyone else. He knew such selflessness was heroic. But before he knew it, the future was quickly closing in on him. It was up to him to keep up and to ensure that it went his way.
“Aaaah….” He held his hands out for the cat, “ahhh… ACHOO!” There it was, Tony sneezed loudly and flew back, crashing into a hedge sculpture of a giraffe. The cat meanwhile was so startled by the huge noise that Tony had made that it darted down the tree and jumped straight into Steve’s arms.
His fingertips curled over the metal circle, getting a firm grip and pulling himself up to scout left and right. He scoped the now desolate terrain. There was nothing in sight but broken buildings, fallen objects and a couple of large bodies.
Such a cold name; Patient Zero. It dehumanised Steve to little but a lab specimen. Although the others had lectured Tony time and time again about detachment to people that they were working with, they all knew that it was impossible for Tony to pull himself away from his childhood hero like that. It was as though he were talking to a brick wall.
The wind pushed through their hair, so much so that Tony had to keep one hand on his hat to keep it on. Steve’s short curtains were incredibly out of shape but he could fix them later; that was the least of his concerns right now.
“I know right?! That was a heckuva save! I’m okay though. Must be grass allergies, I hate coming out from the lab because of it.” He rubbed his red nose.
“I wanted this to be done by two, actually. I knew for well you wouldn’t get up on time – Actually, I was counting on it. But you’re full of surprises, Stark.”
There was a flash of embarrassment as he attempted to slope his shoulders a little, give himself a little slump in pose, but it didn’t work. The second he tried to lower himself by instinct his shoulders raised again and chest out to show off his broad frame. Anything else just felt uncomfortable.
He struggled to fight against the force in his mind, but it was no use, not when he was so weak as it was.
“That’s impossible… I mean… I’ve seen them before but… I thought… This is impossible!” Tony continued with a stutter, his eyes darting along each strand that seemed to materialise even further as he touched it.
“Yeah, modern technology, Cap. I’ll teach you more about it; give you all sorts of things to learn too. Just smile, this one’s for the Christmas Card.”
Steve was quick to notice the strange fall in Tony’s tone. “Not too keen on him…?” Was he prying, perhaps a little too soon? It’s only been a matter of hours since they had first met and here he was discussing father issues. Tony didn’t really reply, just sucked lightly on the inside of his lower lip until he composed himself enough to meet Steve’s eyes again.
“The number of explosion survivors was scarce, but yes. You were the exception, you know; everyone presumed that you were dead. We kept you under wraps and it took a lot of work to do so. SHIELD found your body and we kept it.  Performed the surgery ourselves.”
Tony tried to shake the image of Steve trying to actually bite him out of his head, closing his eyes just for a moment and trying to think of the few seconds prior to that, at least they were somewhat comforting. He could feel the tears swell, he could feel himself break down and fall to his knees – hitting the metal tiles under him. His wet skin touching the cold, making him shiver, but he was too distraught to even react to that. He had come to the realisation that his friends mind was being destroyed, as if the tests weren’t enough to prove that along with Steve obeying the one prevalent instinct he had; hunger.
Zola’s eyes darted from screen to screen before he smacked one of the biggest buttons on the control panel and the plate that Steve was on began to shake and light up behind him. Tony was gaining far too much momentum, too much to turn around before he thwarted himself into Zola who had just managed to push the button as he was knocked back.
It had been months since Captain Rogers had been found and transported to a small base located just off the coast of England where SHIELD was keeping him under strict observation. He was still unconscious, lying on that cold steel bed, locked in a tiny room of the hidden base. The capacity was completely sealed, not even daylight managed to break into it; there wasn’t a single window. Everything was artificially lit in this lime green lighting which made it have much more of a horror atmosphere, the occasional flicker from the power supply able to send even the workers into shudders of paranoia. But that was the way that Fury liked it. He liked his workers to be on edge, because he knew it was the adrenaline that kept them going. Not that they had much to do asides from monitor.
“N-nothing, just checking… You—it looked like you stopped—never mind. Nightmares.” He muttered incoherently, curling up against the pillow and pressing his nose to it instead. Paranoia was surely getting the better of him, so burying his face against Steve’s pillow to inhale that fragrant scent that he adored was enough to pacify him.
“Good, make sure you do,” she instructed, giving the two strict eyes before heading off with Batroc, ready to send him straight to the slammer.
As quickly as he could Peter held his hand out and began to attempt to reach for a building with his webshot, trying to squirm his way out of Carol’s grip and take Tony with him, or at least slow down the momentum of which she was heading straight for the concrete below.
They had managed to down six or so passers and around three cops. Steve could hear the sirens in the distance, as did Tony. Tony still had the sense to try and get Steve somewhere safe, although his need for self-preservation was vast fading he still had a little bit left of his survival instincts. He had managed to cover some ground with Steve, tugging him into the safety of a park and walking down a path with them. Those nearby knew from the screams that something terrible was coming and had evacuated the small surrounding area, including that of the park nearby, after all the events that the people of New York had gone through they had learned that when they heard screams they needed to hide – Skrull invasions, killer robots, alien attacks, incursions.
Pulling up all the courage he had, a fire lit under him, he finally placed both hands on Tony’s shoulders, meeting his eyes with a solid stare full of conviction, trying not to get lost in Tony’s guilt-ridden blues. The more eye contact he made the more the other man’s eyes lit up.  “Let’s go,” Steve said with heart.
Just as he was carrying a box outside and had placed it on the lawn, his arm began to seize up. Suddenly a jolt of pain surged throughout his body starting from his arm and coursing its way up his shoulder, causing him to blink a couple of times. When he did blink he managed to see images – strange images being relayed to him. He could see fire, chunks of the ceiling collapsing on the ground, and then a blurry image of a door. With those hazy images beginning to compile themselves in his mind, he realised where exactly it was; the lower laboratory. The rush of panic that lingered in his system from the images almost resembled fear. He had to shake off whatever emotion he’d felt for that moment and take those flashes as a warning of some sort, following his gut and running back inside and toward the lab. If those images were right, the door would have been blocked so he tapped the wall next to the door and drew his bionic arm back. With a powerful thrust forward he punched the wall, repeating the motion until the wall crumbled.  Along with the power he’d put into that punch he ended up tumbling in amongst the pile of broken bricks, low and behold he fell right next to the door that was blocked by a burning chunk of metal, wood and other components that once formed the ceiling above, along with the wires that lined the ceiling. Electrical fires were always a risk; if those dangling wires caught fire then they could snake up into the entire electrical system.
Bang on target, it hit his shoulder and sent him staggering back, but with practically no reaction, no scream of pain as the burning singe in his shoulder smoked. He grabbed Carol again. Carol shot power shots toward the beast of a man but as much as he was getting burned and obviously hurt, he just carried on as he was. His mouth opened with tendrils of spit joining his chapped lips, letting out a roar which immediately broke the strands.
“I’m sure you could have,” Steve humoured him, returning a pat on the shoulder. “Well, it doesn’t matter now. We’re nearly there, there’s no use wallowing in despair and regret.”
“What do you mean, you gave him two servings right? You know he’s a super soldier so his metabolism…”
“Listen, I don’t blame you for them… For Jessica and Carol,” Peter felt the need to say, seeing how much the man was suffering and knew for well that he didn’t deserve that. In fact, after such a long time, Peter was happy to have him by his side and even more relieved that he wasn’t a fake that was sent by some other entity.
It withdrew its wires from the machines and stepped up to Tony. “Together we will be unstoppable, invincible. Do you not want that, Tony? Do you not want to be invincible and free of the pain and suffering that you have spent your entire life suffering in? I can save you.”
“Your heart is here, and I can feel it…” Steve replied in that strong, confident tone, placing his hand over Tony’s reactor and seeing a tiny spark when the metal hand touched the glowing light.
“We all do. We’ve made the team aware of what’s happening, briefly, and they all know that Cap is in good hands now and that he needs his space.”
Tony knew exactly what they had done and even though it was for Steve’s own good, there was a part of him that was just considerably overwhelmed with guilt for knocking him out like that. It looked as though they had just thawed him out from the ice again, the way he was resting on that table with others staring at him. It sent an unmistakable and resounding sense of déjà vu coursing through his entire system. Throwing a man that had rested for 70 years back into a coma and induced sleep for further scientific testing was a hollow experience for Tony. Slowly he exhaled yet another sigh of overexertion, oozing pure heartbreak. His hand brushed up over his chest and clutched his aching heart while his eyes stilled upon the profile of the sleeping beauty before him. It even hurt to
The armoured man looked around again, trying to see if he could find Steve but he knew he would be much more efficient with both working hands, so he had to do this. Tony sat down in a lotus position in his armour, using the soles of his boots as a clamp to hold the arm in place as he began rummaging through the wires with his good hand, trying to re-wire it. Again, this was much easier in his head. He had to crane his neck down and awkwardly tug at the wires, using his teeth at some points, which wasn’t the wisest idea, but he had to ignore the small shocks he was getting through his teeth in order for this to work properly. Small surges were nothing, as long as he could get this working. He tore off the plastic cases of the wires to reveal the copper, and awkwardly angled himself toward the arm so that it was fixed to the stub. Now this was where it would get painful; Tony grabbed a shard of glass that was nearby and surprisingly easy to get a hold of and used it to rip the cut open.
Tony’s steely eyes shut, inhaling deeply. He felt a shiver course up his spine the closer Steve got to him, a warmth befell him once more and when he shut his eyes, it was as though he could see a bright light.
