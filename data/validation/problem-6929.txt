Sam grinned.  “Guess we’ll just have to rely on your looks,” he said.  He dropped his arm and tapped the box against Steve’s chest.  “This should help.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  He took a deep breath.  “You know, if you’d asked me this morning what my absolute worst case scenario was for what that pack of jackals would come back with, I would’ve said that it was that you’re here to kill me.”  His hand fell to the table and he looked up.  “Who knew that ‘he’s running around the city fighting mobsters with just his bare fists and a trash can lid’ could actually beat that, in terms of nightmare scenarios?”
Carol looked just as rough as Rhodey did, her face pale and her hair sticking up in off-balance clumps.  She was wearing what looked like one of Tony’s button down oxford shirts and nothing else that he could see.  She leaned a shoulder on the door frame, her arms crossed over her chest.“Anyone have any hints for getting Clint out of the bathtub?”
“Hi,” he said, his eyes darting over the lobby.  When he moved, it was careful and slow, his feet picking their way across the carpet.
“That he did,” Jarvis agreed, stacking up Peter’s school books.  “Shall I put these on the shelf, sir?”
DJ bounced across the room, scrambling up over a chair and the small desk, hopping from there to the heavy chest at the foot of Steve's bed.  From there, he let himself fall forward, landing facedown on the bed.  In the silence that followed, DJ giggled into the quilt.
“It is.  But you're not giving it back once it's fixed,” Val said.  “Are you?”  DJ shrugged, and she shook her head.  “They're going to figure it out eventually, Deej.”
She popped the cork.  “He’s quite clever, Officer.  Better watch yourself.” She gave him a look, her lashes sweeping low over her eyes.  “Once you get deep enough into the labyrinth, you might have a hard time finding your way back out.”
“And I say, ‘I’m not,’ and she goes, ‘Not what?’ and I said, ‘I’m not straight.  I’m bi.’”  She paused.  Carol had her face buried in her folded arms.  Jess reached over and patted her on the head. “And she said ‘Good for you,’ and then she left.”
“I can make it work,” Steve said, and it was ridiculous, it was impossible, but his voice was hard and determined and Tony found himself believing he could.
If he was being honest with himself, which never ended well, he regretted a whole hell of a lot more than that.
DJ gave a firm nod, and Peter gave Steve a bright smile.  “I'll help him, if he needs it,” he offered.
“You love me,” Sam said, holding the cup out to Steve, one eyebrow arching. “I mean, I thought you did.”
Tony was leaning back in his chair, one foot braced on the edge of his desk, the other thrown out in front of him.  His eyes were closed, and he had a bottle of vodka pressed against his forehead.  Steve slipped through the door, letting it close silently behind him.  “So,” he said, his voice soft, “this is a vodka level problem.”
Bobbi licked her lips, flicking away the last of the cream with the pad of her thumb.  “So sorry, Mr. Stark, but I don't babysit.”  Her eyelashes fluttered.  “Not in my job description.”
“We’re going to have a quick discussion about the choices that we’ve all made that lead us to this point,” Iron Man told him.  The armor flickered in the light as he turned.  His head twitched, a quick jerk of his chin to one side.  “A quick, honest discussion.”
“Don't go all shrink on me,” he said.  Sam didn't say anything.  He just waited, his face calm, his gaze steady.  Tony huffed out a breath.  “You said it yourself.  I'm bad at this.”
“Telling Abby that you've drawn naked pictures of me and you're not sharing,” Sam said, and Steve lunged for his phone.  Laughing, Sam twisted around, keeping it out of reach with a force of will.  “No!  The truth will be known, Rogers!”
Tony took the cup of water from him and drained it as footsteps came thudding up the hallway.  “As it turns out, you were right.”  He struggled to his feet, holding fear at bay with a force of will.  “I need a car and a driver.  Now.”
“And I made banana bread,” Jane said, carrying a platter in each hand. “Because I forgot about the bananas when I we, you know, went to Asgard.”  She was wearing a pair of red and purple plaid pajama pants and what appeared to be one of Thor’s sweatshirts, the arms rolled up so they didn’t trail over her hands.
“Hey, don't-” He barely got the words out before Steve managed to grab hold of his arm, tugging him forward, pulling him towards the bed.  “Steve, what-”
“So am I.” She took a deep breath, her head twisting away.  “The cops didn’t think much of it, of course.  Just another criminal who got what he deserved.  They had other priorities.  And my mother didn’t make a fuss.  She just gathered whatever she had left and moved back to the city.  She could disappear here.  Forget.  Pretend that none of it had happened.”
Obie burst out laughing.  “There is that,” he said.  He reached out, slapping Tony on the back.  “Your father would be proud.”
He paused, his head tipped to the side.  “Right.  Yeah.”  He paused.  “I mean.  I’m not saying ‘elope’ but-”
“And you can’t say anything when I go to a fifty dollar buffet and eat nothing but eight corndogs,” Clint said.
Tony wandered across the workshop, kicking chunks of armor out of the way with a vicious sweep of his foot.  A gauntlet slammed into the metal cabinet, and he was pretty sure it left a dent.  It also might’ve broken his foot.  Not that he cared much.  The physical pain muted a lot of other things in his head, and he was grateful for it.  He lowered himself into a chair, slumping low in the seat.  “I gave up,” he said, saluting her with the cup.  And with a broad smile, he took a deep drink.
“We tell him that he should be more careful with his possessions, it’s not our responsibility to take care of them, and he shouldn’t expect us to,” Tony said.  “If he does, he’s delusional.”
But the slow, steady weight of his gaze was his own.  The way he moved, awkward and sometimes too quick for his own good.  His careful,economical use of words.  The way he saw things, the way he listened, his gentle, bright spirit, his natural wonder, that was DJ.  That was only and always DJ.
“A mistake I won’t be repeating,” Tony said.  He grabbed one of the pillows and tossed it over Steve’s head.  “Go to bed, Deej.  We’ll be here tomorrow.”
And Agatha’s familiar was sitting on the arm of the couch, front paws crossed in front of it, tail swinging in slow, easy arc, as regular as a pendulum.
The hug was too long and too tight and too needy, and Steve still sank into it, a tension he hadn’t even been aware of bleeding out of him.  He buried his face in Tony’s shoulder and took a deep breath.  “God, I missed you.”
“Do you want to try again?” Tony asked.  A nod.  “Upstairs?” Another nod.  “Do you promise me that if you’re uncomfortable, you’ll do whatever you have to do to make it better?”  This nod was slower, but firm.  Tony leaned in, his forehead bumping against DJ’s.  “Will you let me help?” he whispered.
“No,” Tony said, holding the box out of reach. “Not a chance.  I ordered half the damn menu, find something else.”
Val scrubbed at her nose with the back of one wrist, her face wrinkling up.  “No, you're not,” she said.  “You're just sorry DJ is mad at you.”
“I can’t do this,” Steve said to Pepper.  “I think we can agree that I can’t do this and move on with our lives?”  He glanced at the record player, set up just by the doors.  “I only agreed to come out here because I thought you needed help setting up the winter shutters.”
His shoulders rose and fell in a shrug.  "Lotta things I should be doing," he said, an edge to the words.
“Yeah, but I'm not sure I'm sharing those,” Steve said, his voice full of laughter.  The wind kicked up, and his pale hair flopped over his forehead. “That's my offer, Stark.”
Steve watched her go, watched her walk out of the room with her back straight, chin up, her ponytail swinging behind her like a metronome.  Perfect.  Polished.  Professional.  The door shut behind her, and he turned his attention back to the television.  Tony was still talking, smooth and polished and professional, but his smile was natural, his eyes bright.
DJ’s stomach sank.  “You left him,” he said, and Steve fell silent.  DJ shook his head.  “Shouldn’t…  Shouldn’t do that.  He’s no good alone.  You know-” His throat worked.  “You know he’s no good alone, Steve.”  He tried to smile.  “That’s…  That’s why he made me.”
Steve looked like he wanted to put his fist through something.  “Why didn't anyone tell me this was happening?” he gritted out.
“Well, I expected that would be your opening,” Tony said. He spread his hands. “Tony had a tongue, and he sure knew how to use it.”
Just a little canon appropriate violence in this one.  Based on the strangest scene in the Annie movie.
Hammer looked at Steve.  “I would never have done it, if I’d known,” he said, his voice pleading.  “I thought we’d just…  Make some easy money and then he’d go right back where he’d been, none the worse for wear.  He was right there, it was so easy...”
Steve reached for the remote.  With a flick of his thumb, he turned off the tv, and sank down into a chair at the conference table, his head falling into his hands.
Tony braced a hand on the counter, his mouth going tight.  “Right.  Schedules.  You like to know what's happening, so you can prepare, right?”  DJ nodded. “Okay.”  He glanced up at the plans.  “In one hour,” he said, looking back down.  “Okay?”  DJ considered that, and nodded, but his face was creased with worry.  Tony took a deep breath and tried again.  “Play for one hour, then you can help me with the chestplate, then we need to get ready for dinner.”
Outside the car, Rogers was still, his head tipped forward, his shoulders squared.  Tony wondered if he could hear them.  “But your opinion is…”
“Yes, but they change so often that we’ve all found it easier to ignore them until we know which one you’re planning on enforcing on a particular day,” Jarvis said.  “And then apologize.”
“The rest of us aren't,” he said, and there was a grunt and a high pitched scream in the background.  “So go take care of that, Iron Man.”
Steve looked up and found Stark standing directly across the table from him, his expression unreadable.  "I already caught it and I'm compensating for it," Stark said.  His head tipped to the side.  "But then again, I'm used to catching mathematical errors."
Steve wasn't naked, either, but he was almost painfully attractive, all long limbs and broad shoulders and narrow hips.  His shirt was raked up around his chest, exposing the musculature of his stomach.
“I love how that’s what we’re choosing to focus on,” Tony drawled, his fingers working their way into a narrow gap in the prototype’s frame.  He gritted his teeth, trying to find an angle that would give him the access he needed without scraping half the skin off of his knuckles.  “As if that’s what’s important.”
“Natasha is in the solarium, tending to her plants.  Bruce is in the midst of his yoga routine.  Phil is reviewing some case files.  The others are still asleep,” Jarvis said.
Tony didn't look up from his papers, but his mouth curved into smile.  "I am disliking that tone, Miss Potts," he said, scribbling a note in the corner of the blueprint before tossing it aside.  "I find it to be disrespectful."
Tony’s mouth closed.  He sighed.  “It would be helpful if you knew me a little less,” he said, reaching for his coffee cup.  Steve got there first, slipping it out from under his hand.  Tony stared down at his empty hand.  “Right.  A lot less.”
Thor smiled, even as he crouched down next to the bed.  “Hello, little prince,” he said.  “I brought you a welcome gift.”  He reached into the pocket of his jacket, coming up with a small, gleaming ball.  It seemed to be made of metallic threads, each one catching the light as he rolled it across his massive palm.  “A small thing, I know, but a common plaything from my home.”
“You were yelling at the President that weekend,” Greer said.  Steve paused, and she smiled.  “You do not remember, do you?”
“I’m not even going to ask how you knew what was in here,” Carol said, handing the bag over.  “Because I’m pretty sure I want to know the answer.”
Billy’s eyes were huge, but his voice was steady.  “Call Stark Manor.  Tell them Stane might be the kidnapper.”
Steve stared at him, looking for some sign of annoyance or anger on his face, but there was nothing, nothing but Tony, relaxed and smiling.  “One second,” he said, and before he could think better of it, he took a step back, and another, retreating, and then half jogging, half sprinting towards the kitchen, his hands pulling down on the hem of his shirt with every step.
She grinned.  “I could see the exact moment he just-” Her head tipped to the side.  “Gave up and adopted him.”
Natasha crossed the white tile floor, her footsteps echoing in the empty space.  “Take a seat,” she said, gesturing towards the counter.  Without waiting to see if Steve followed her instruction, she headed to a door on the far wall, throwing it open to reveal a path down to the gardens behind the house.  She leaned out, tucking two fingers into her mouth and letting out a piercing whistle.
Tony struggled against a grin.  “I always a very fine beard,” he pointed out.  “Now I'm just scruffy.”
“Yes,” Val said.  She tugged on her father’s hand.  “Let’s go see if I can figure out the rules to his card game without asking him!”
“Of course he did!” Ty wrenched the sheets out of his hand, balled them up, and threw them back at him.  Tony let it bounce harmlessly off of his head.  “And then he said I failed.”
“Do you really want to start up the 'food feud' coverage again?” Pepper asked.  Tony considered that.  “Because if you enjoyed that coverage, you were the only one who did.  No one else did.  No one.”
“Then fuck ‘em,” Tony said with a grin. “Order yourself whatever the hell you want and put it on the company card, Pep.”
Tony nodded.  “I knew.  I knew that they-” He swept his thumb across the back of Steve’s hand.  “It was different, though, seeing them with him.”  He looked up at Steve.  “The kid can fly.”
Miss Potts's hand flicked through the air as she returned to her ledgers.  "Any number of things," she said, flipping through the pages.  She made a notation, and reached for a different book, checking the dates on the spine before flipping it open to compare it to the one she was working in.  "Engines.  Machinery.  Generators."  Her pen flowed over the page, smooth and easy.  "Medical equipment.  Car parts."  She glanced up.  "Mostly, engines.  Plane, truck, car, if it makes something move, we can build it.  And we do."
He had a split second to see the shock roll across Tony’s face, to see his eyes go wide, and then Steve was dragging him into the room.  “Are you out of your mind?” he hissed, casting a desperate glance up and down the hallway.  It was deserted, not even old man Currothers peeking out from behind his door.  Steve shoved his own door shut, locking it with hands that shook.
“And I don’t want-” Shuri started, but Okoye was already sliding out of her saddle, sighing in relief as her feet hit the road.
“Yes, but he kept his best material for me.”  Tony crossed his arms over his chest.  “Is there a point to this?”
There was something steady and solid in the words, something stable to the way he said it, that Steve couldn’t quite define.  He’d spent his entire life feeling like he was standing on shifting sand, waiting for the ground to fall out from under him, struggling to find his footing.  Every time he thought he’d find it,  it slipped away from him, knocking him off balance again.
“No,” Tony said, but either getting rid of what he could, or the adrenaline must’ve helped, because he when Jarvis caught his arm, he was able to stumble to his feet.  “Yes.”  He swiped the back of his arm across his mouth.  “Yes.”
“He’s a bit of a dumbass, Steve, you know he is,” Isaiah responded.  He rocked forward in his chair.  “The point being, I know you.  I know you damn well.  I invited you along to testify, and, whether you know it or not, I knew just what I was getting when I did that.”
“She's good at getting her followers in a lather,” Marcy said. “You can discount her, but I'm not about to.”
“Your turn,” he said, and she dragged her box over, her fingernails finding a seam in the paper and slicing through the tape.  She peeled it away as DJ bounced up and down, so eager Tony could tell that it was all he could manage not to help her.
“And what have you done for us lately?” Phil asked.  He made a notation on his tablet.  “It's just a few select representatives.  Go out there, hang some lights, smile nice and get it over with.”
“See, this is the problem with magic,” Tony said to the ceiling. “Unreliable.”  His free hand bounced against his raised leg, his fingers rattling against his knee.  “Nothing from Wong, either?  He usually sends an acknowledgement, even if he doesn’t pick up.”
“She really was the best hire you’ve ever made,” Pepper told him.  Rhodey cleared his throat, and she looked at him.  “I love you, but you were letting him eat three day old toast that he found in a desk drawer.”
Tony’s eyes dropped to the board, and then came back up, sharp and clear, and Steve found it hard to breathe.  “I can work with this.”
Steve was laughing against his back, he felt it as much as heard it.  “And I’ll either break something, or trip on it and break my neck,” he said.  “One quick pull and there’ll be pearls rolling everywhere.”
“Stand DOWN,” Gyrich said, and Thor had zero interest in listening to him, which was nice, because he had diplomatic immunity, and Tony hadn't managed to get that.  Not yet.
“Too late, turn!” she said, the order firm, and he turned, somehow matching the fluidity of her movements.  “Good.  And again.”
But when he was safely outside, past the kitchen garden, down past the wall and halfway to the lower fields, he unwrapped it.  Two thick slices of bread, spread with a soft, yielding cheese were nestled in the center of the fabric, tucked alongside a few small pieces of chicken.  Nothing like the feast that had been spread out on the dining room table, but far more than he was allowed, under most circumstances.
“You're tricky, I think it's better that I don't give you a chance to escape,” Steve said, grinning.
“Yes, well, the damage was minimal, and in Ben’s words, ‘they tried to kill us and they failed, let’s eat’ is appropriate for the season, so we’re all expected.” She handed Carol a fat stack of papers.  “Consider making a donation to the Yancy Street Community Center in his name.”
The elevator doors opened, and Steve touched Sue's elbow.  He waited until she met his eyes, and then he smiled.  “Franklin's a very lucky boy,” he said.  “Not just because he does look quote unquote normal, not because he can pass as normal, but because he has a mother who will defend, to her death, his right to exist, as he is.  No matter what he can do, or how he chooses to live his life.  He's got a mother who will fight for him, no matter what.”
“Steve n' Tony's Fix-It Service,” Steve said, and he was breathing better now.  Less ragged.  Less strained.  “Most startups fail in their first year, you know.”
“At this rate, I just might,” Obie said.  He smiled, just a little.  “Tomorrow.  You and I need to have a talk.”
Clint shrugged, and immediately winced.  “Dunno.  But sorry they took off before you got here.”  He slid off the stretcher, his booted feet hitting the ground with a solid thump.  “Would've liked to see how that would've worked out for you.”
"We can, but, uh, it'll be tough," Bruce said.  He peeled back the husk, considering the neat rows of golden kernels with a narrowed eye.  "Late season.  Always hit or miss."  He smiled at Steve.  "There's butter."
“We are told, he is offering to help watch the goats.  He is helping build fences.  He is insisting on taking a shift to guard the camp.”  She paused.  “And the guards do not know what to do with this.  This…  Was not the plan.
“He's got the flu,” Steve said.  “He's asleep, I'm sorry.  When I brought him home, he tried to warn me, he tried to say something about an alarm, and I didn't understand.”  He took a breath.  “He sets an alarm so he remembers to call DJ, doesn't he?”
Stane laughed, his lips pulling back from his teeth.  “You’ve always been weak, Tony.  You’ve never had the balls to do what needed to be done, that’s why you let me take over.  Because you were, and have always been, weak.”  There was blood on his lips, on his teeth.  “Always.”
The night air was crisp and cold, in a way that he’d only found in the desert.  The strip mall the costume warehouse occupied was far enough from the center of the city that the lights were muted, the soft glow of the strip barely creeping into the sky.  Tony leaned back against the building, trying to focus on his phone.
Natasha didn’t move from the workshop doorway, one hand braced on the frame, her face set.  “What happened?” she repeated.
“Right,” Tony said, as Jarvis came up behind Jan, a small silver serving tray balanced on one hand.  “Jarvis, please remove this interloper from the property.”
Tony leaned against the island, watching with idle curiosity as Jarvis poured a measure of beans into the old fashioned hand crank machine and started to turn the handle.  It let out a grating whine that made DJ cover his ears.  “Should it sound like that?” Tony asked.
“I like it,” Tony said, leaning his chin on Steve’s shoulder.  “Jarvis?  Can you inform Ms. Van Dyne that we are on our honeymoon and will inform her when our schedule opens up?”
"Oh."  Peter blinked at him again.  There were leaves in his hair, and a tear on one shoulder of his shirt.  "I'm fine.  Thank you, Mr. Stark."
“I'm being humored right now," Stark complained, as Pepper passed him off to Jarvis.  He glared over his shoulder at her.  "I know I'm being humored.  Give me that."
Steve gave him a look, his lips twitching.  “Rude of me,” he agreed, and he peeled away the rest of the brown paper.  It fell to the polished marble of the lobby floor in broad, heavy swaths, leaving Steve with an armload of roses, beautifully formed blooms of golden yellow with red bleeding along the tips of every petal.
“I used the app,” she said, deliberately vague, and when she chose to be vague, there was always a reason.  “Women don’t like ‘dying,’ Harris.”
While Steve was still sputtering, Tony rocked up onto his knees, catching Steve’s head in his hands.  A few quick rubs, and he’d worked the shampoo into Steve’s hair.  “There,” he said, the pressure of his hands changing, his fingers smoothing over the lines of Steve’s head.  “That’s not so bad, is it?”
“We were barely expecting these people for dinner,” Stark told him.  “We were expecting roughly half of these people.”
Tony considered that.  “Which…  Question is that answering?” he asked at last.  She flipped him off.  “Both of them, then?”
“Ooooooof,” Tony said on a long, pained exhale, and Steve could feel the heat of his breath against his neck.  “Okay.  Wow.”  He reached past Steve, fingers brushing against the touchpad, and he was so close that Steve could smell his cologne, a subtle, pleasant scent made Steve’s mouth go dry.  He shifted in his seat, feeling awkwardly out of place in his own body.  He didn’t know where to put his hands, or how to breathe without it sounding desperate.
“Stay in the car, I’ll get the key and we can take the elevator from the parking garage,” Tony said, slipping out of the car door and pushing it almost closed, reluctant to wake the kid.  Clint leaned over in the driver’s seat, and Tony stabbed a finger in his direction.  “You.”  He waved his hand at the backseat.  “Babysit.”
“A choice you are, of course, welcome to make,” Jarvis said, unruffled as ever.  “However, I shall leave the final journey from your blotter to the flames to you.” He set the coffee pot down by Tony’s elbow, turning it so the handle was within easy reach.  “As it is high time for you to learn to do such things for yourself.”
"He IS okay," Bruce said.  "He's here.  I know you don't like it here, he doesn't like it, no one likes it."  He leaned into his hand, pressing against the arc reactor.  "His body is handling this, but even he can stand to get a little help."
Reality crashed in on him like a wave, less like he entered a new world and more that it formed itself around him.  As if he had always been there.  As if he belonged.
“Take me to a hotel,” Tony muttered, and Happy laughed.  Resigned, Tony reached for the door handle.  “Your insolence has been noted, Hogan.”
“Yes, but it is mine,” Pepper said, her voice unnaturally chipper.  Tony paused, his fingers hovering over his notes.  He looked up to find Pepper staring at him, a wide, toothy grin plastered on her face.  “So.  If I'm asking you this question, do you really think that the answer would be found in the database?”
"We're not calling the police, we're not calling anyone," Tony gritted out, his fingers locked on the back of DJ's shirt.  "We're going to-"
“The Rhino threw me through a WALL.  That had a mural on it,” Peter said, his voice dark.  “The 'destruction' was a side effect.  So yeah.” He spread his hands.  “I got zero problems with lying to the press.”
Tony took a deep breath.  “I know we will,” he said.  “I have to-  I have to believe that, because otherwise, I’m-” He laughed, and there was very little humor to it.  “I’m going to lose it.”
Aunt May switched her gimlet glare in Jarvis’ direction, but Peter ducked back into his room, scanning desperately for his shoes.  They weren’t where they should’ve been and he had no idea where he’d left them.  “I won’t leave the house, Aunt May, I’ll just go and check on DJ and if he’s awake, I’ll bring him back up here and if he’s not I’ll wait there until you or Mr. Jarvis come and I can do this, right?” Giving up on the shoes, he darted back into the sitting room.  “Aunt May.  I can do this.”
Jarvis sighed.  “Though I may be biased, I must say, it’s not as terrible a prospect as you might think.”
“I don’t know which one is mine,” Harris said, “let alone what his drunken party tricks might possibly be.”
Isaiah gave him an innocent look.  “I’m an old black man, beholden to a wide variety of social charities and government agencies to try to feed the absolutely most disenfranchised people in the city of New York,” he said.  “You, meanwhile, are a young, attractive white boy who is eloquent, charismatic, and make your money from people who pay Tony Stark the equivalent of a month’s rent for a single meal and then come out and stand on the curb and pay you to actually feed them.  And you taking Congress to task is only going to act as free advertising for you.”  He spread his hands.  “Am I throwing you under the bus?  Boy, the bus is going to speed straight up to you and do an instant u-turn.”
"Who's the dancer here?" she asked.  Her heel dug into his shoulder blade.  "Reach for your toes, Cap."
Memory hit Tony sideways, a wave of fear and adrenaline riding right behind it.  The movie theater.  The gun.  The smell of blood and the screech of tires, and DJ’s face, almost as pale as Pepper’s, almost as-
“We knew Stark had this much stamina,” Natasha said, running a cloth back and forth across the wood in a loose parody of polishing.  “But what were the odds that he’d find someone who could keep up with him?”
Sam spread his hands, his head tipped forward so he could look up at Steve from beneath the arch of his brows.  "Not your therapist.  Just your friend."
"Oh my God, he is in a mood," Ellen grumbled. She dropped her bag and straightened her jacket. “How do I look?”
His chair was removed from theirs, both in physical distance and in style.  Made of plain, unadorned wood with no cushion on the back or the seat, it was set at the far end of the table, well away from the rest of the family.  That was where it always stayed, and that was where Tony always sat.  Well out of reach from the heavy serving platters of savory, well-seasoned meat and crisp vegetables, gleaming under a cloak of sauce or clarified butter.  Baskets filled with bread, studded with nuts and raisins, warred for space with pots of jam and plates of pickles, and bottle after bottle after bottle of wine.
“Yeah, yeah,” Clint said, flexing his arm, testing the duct tape fix.  It held together, and he made a grab for Darcy’s churro.  She held it out of reach with a grin.  “Gimme.”
“I honestly don't know,” Steve said, half under his breath, so disgruntled that Tony started to laugh.
“Well, once I figured out which way to hold it, it was a lot easier,” he said.  His horse pawed at the dirt, displeased with the delay, and Steve leaned forward in the saddle, patting him on the neck.  “I know, Nomad, I know, but we have to wait for the others.”
“And you were still adorable,” Tony said, because he was sure of that. “But still.  When you asked the cool kids if you could come over to play, did that ever work out well for you?”
Aimsbridge let out a soft chuckle. “Chin up, Captain.” He paused, a puckish glint in his eyes. “Figuratively and literally.”
She nodded.  “I know, I know, but-”  Her head tipped back, a gentle smile sliding across her features.  “Our work knows no hours, Mr. Rhodes.”
Steve tried to smile, but it felt odd on his face.  "Tony.  Everyone always looked at me differently.  Before the serum.  And after.  What I was, who I was, for some people, that changed.  For me, it didn't."  He took a breath.  "For the people who mattered, it didn't."
Marjorie gave the room an unimpressed look.  "Yes.  We are."  She fished a sleek phone from the depths of her equally sleek black purse.  "I'll call in some favors."
Hammer immediately looked at Tony, and Tony's eyes narrowed. “Such a shame to miss the movie,” he said. “I couldn't, of course, what would it look like, I bring these boys here, and then immediately leave? People would notice.” He smiled. “No reason the two of you couldn't get along, though. Be a nice break from your usual grind.”
“Then you don’t get a vote.” Bucky pushed away from the wall.  “C’mon, Steve, grab your new toy and let’s go.   We’ve still got a few days ride; might as well get to it.”
“And the thing is, if either of us cared less, it’d be easier, Deej.  If either of us could say, ‘you know what, whatever, do whatever you want,’ it would be so much easier.  But being your parent, it’s…  It’s something I’m not good at, but I’m…  I’m not willing to give up on it.”
“You'll have tea and toast,” Steve said, and Tony stared at him, betrayed.  Steve smiled.  “Keep that down and we'll see if you can have one.”
“My grandfather followed me around yelling at me that every subpar bowl of soup I served was a dagger in the heart of my entire family, living and dead,” Shiro said.
“Right, let’s get on that,” Darcy said, and Sitwell was there, and Sitwell had a gun, and that was strange, that was very strange.
“Bet he managed to make his budget stretch to a few more things,” Steve said, moving back far enough for Tony to stand up.
“Yeah, yeah.” Clint glanced down at the cookie he was working on.  “Huh.  Going a little modern art there, aren’t you buddy?”
“Hey, Jarvis, anyone up yet?” Steve walked into the shared kitchen, dropping two big paper bags onto the nearest open countertop.  “I picked up bagels on my morning run.”
“Probably not.” On stage, Steve seemed to be about three seconds from tossing Morrison out of the nearest window. Tony wouldn't have blamed him. “I married that.”
Clea’s eyes widened.  “He didn’t-”  Strange shook his head.  She looked at Steve.  “You didn’t-”  He shook his head.  She smacked him on top of the head with the scroll.  Turning back to Strange, she let loose with a wave of words in a language that Steve didn’t understand.
She held the cup out to him, and DJ took it.  Seemingly satisfied, she picked up her saucer, and settled back into her chair, the dark silk of her dress rustling as she adjusted her position.  “Would you like a cookie, then?  They’re quite good.”  Her head tipped to the side.  “Coconut.”
“Journalistic win,” Jesse said. She toasted Rogers with her tea cup. “So does that mean we can ask you for an interview?”
“He won’t leave,” Harris said, even as he turned, looking back in the opposite direction.  “He’s got to be here somewhere, the room isn’t that big.”
Like everything else I've ever written, I've thought "how can I get a couple thousand words out of this concept, there's no way that'll happen," and end up trying to avoid hitting 100K.
There was a beat of silence.  The girl cleared her throat.  “Gary’s actually pretty decent,” she said.  “He knows it’s bullshit, but he gets in trouble if he doesn’t yell at us about it, so pretty much we all try to do it because he doesn’t, you know-”  Tony stared at her, and she gave a little shrug, looking sheepish.  “It could be a lot worse.”
She paused, her mouth drawing up. “I forget, quite often, that the rest of your kind do not have that connection to the astral plane.  That my appearances and departures are unexpected, and likely, quite startling.  Even if my presence is desired, when I-” She paused, the hologram still spinning over her fingertip.  “Pop in?  Is that an accurate description?”
“Not a metaphor!” Tony yelled, even as he wandered towards the door.  He darted out, letting it fall shut behind him with a solid bang.  It was childish, and he did not care.  He had energy to burn and a lot of frustration, and he didn't want to go home and he probably shouldn't drive when he was like this.
"An' who cares what the likes of you needs?  Me, I'll be needing a bed an' I ain't gettin' it as long as you need a nurse maid," Rogers said, and he was laughing now, too, his shoulders jerking with it.  He rocked forward, his chest brushing against Tony's back, and Tony had to work hard at not relaxing into the shelter of his body.
Bruce nodded.  "Won't be the first time it's been out back all night, won't be the last."  His eyes cut up, meeting Steve's for a moment.  "You okay with him?"
Steve leaned against the doorframe, his chest aching.  Tony was slumped over the kitchen table, his head pillowed on his arms, his dark hair falling over his forehead.  His lips were parted, just a fraction of an inch, his breathing slow and relaxed.  There was a clean, empty coffee cup resting just next to his hand, his lax fingers just brushing against the porcelain.
There was a beat of silence, of stillness, and Harris knew, on some level, that every gun in the room was now pointed in his general direction.  He took a breath, and another, and tried to ignore the pale, frightened face that he saw reflected in the smooth, featureless front of the helmet.
“I’m shocked, appalled and proud in equal amounts,” Tony said.  “Pride’s growing, though.”  He looked at DJ.  “So.  What’s new?”
A long moment of silence, then a slow, careful nod.   Tony smiled at him.  “All right.”  He took a deep breath.  “Did you want to see a movie?”
"Yes."  He flipped his hand towards the door.  "Go.  Bed.  Rest of the righteous, and all that."  Rogers didn't move, and Tony glanced at him.  "Is there something else you need, Officer Rogers?"
Steve paused, the baghanging almost forgotten from one hand.  “What kind of crisis?” he asked.  He tossed the milk and cheese into the fridge and hip-checked it closed.  The rest could wait.
“-We stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds.”  The words had a strange, uneven cadence, like a half remembered poem, but each word was solid, hard and unrelenting.  “When the mob and the-” He stared up, his hands flexing at his sides, the metal on his fingers rattling as his hands formed red fists.  “And the press and the whole WORLD tell you to move-”
“My mother would be amused to know who is cooking her food,” Hitomi said.  She stroked a hand over DJ’s head.  “Will you help me weed the garden now?”  DJ nodded with a grin, and she smiled down at him.  “Thank you.  You are my best helper.  Best boy.”  She leaned over and pressed a kiss to his forehead.  “Say good-bye to your father.  He will call tomorrow.”
As the holographic numbers formed in front of him, Clea nodded.  “I do.”  She reached up, idly playing with a well formed number nine, spinning it in place.  “Stephen has, it is difficult to explain, but he is aware of me, in a way that most mortals cannot be.  He knows my movements, he knows when I approach, and more than that, there are subtle signals he can provide me if my presence is not beneficial or wanted, either due to timing or location.”
“Don’t line up,” Tony agreed.  He gestured at the screen and if Steve turned his head just the smallest amount, he’d be able to kiss Tony’s neck, and that way lay madness.  He stared straight ahead, hands braced on his thighs, shoulders a hard line.
“Just keeping everyone on the same page,” he said, putting the cap back on his sharpie.  She affixed the tag reading ‘Elvis’ to her jumpsuit.
Sam poured him a cup of water.  “Yeah?”  His eyes canted up to meet Steve's.  “Because I have something that'll make you feel better.”  Steve arched an eyebrow at him, and Sam nodded.  “Ready for this?”
“No,” Tony said, bored with the conversation now.  He made a grabbing motion at Rhodey, trying to reclaim his plans.  “Let me-”
A prickle of unease slid over Steve’s skin.  “What’s this?” he asked, his mouth as still as he could keep it.
Steve's free hand swept up and down the plane of Tony's stomach, his touch familiar and comforting, slipping beneath the fabric of his shirt to settle against Tony's skin.
He slapped his hands down on the workbench, hard enough to hurt.  “They’re both gone.”  A bubble of laughter caught in his throat, and for an instant, he was afraid he was going to throw up.  He swallowed hard.  “They’re both-”  He rocked back, his eyes burning.  “I don’t fucking care.  I don’t WANT to fucking care.  So do your worst, toss it all, I’ve got stashes you don’t even know about.”
Steve went back to his dessert.  “Jalapeno and bacon macaroni and cheese,” he said.  “With the trashy, processed cheese you love.”
"If everyone wears a mask," Steve said, "then everyone's safe."  The boy nodded, his teeth flashing in a grin.  Steve smiled back.  "Safety in numbers."
He stopped, his mouth going into a thin line.  “Right.”  He took a deep breath and held it, just for a second, then let it out. “I'll see what I can do.”
Tony looked over his shoulder in time to see Steve come wandering into the kitchen, his hair a tumbled mess and his expression still sleepy.  “Great,” Tony said.  “And what is that in Japanese?”
“Deej?” Steve leaned his elbow on the back of his seat, looking back at DJ.  “Pretty sure we had leftovers from last night.” His head tipped forward.  “Clint would probably be okay with tacos.”
“Okay,” Steve said, pushing himself to his feet.  He waited until everyone settled down, and then he inclined his head in Jan’s direction, his hands braced on the tabletop.  “The floor is yours, Wasp. I’m sure that everyone’s going to give you their undivided attention.”  He looked around the table, meeting everyone’s eyes in turn.  “Right?”
Jesse's eyes rolled towards the ceiling.  “Right,” she said, but she was smiling.  “Get your hungover ass out of bed, and let's go pound on the door of city hall.”
His eyes flicked up towards the ceiling.  “Fine,” he said, and Pepper exhaled, a sigh of relief that made him smile.  “Sorry, Pep.”
“I think eating off paper towels is safer at this point,” Tony said.  “And that's probably the least of our problems.”
“Maybe.  But both of us knows where the other one stands,” Tony said. “And it’s right behind you  It’s…  Always going to be right behind you, DJ.”
“What? Why?” Tony tossed the cleaning cloth back into the bleach water.  “Rhodey’s the good one, Pep. Rhodey’s the-”
"It isn't," Steve said.  And he was tempted to leave it at that, but somehow, he doubted that Stark would be persuaded to let it drop.  "I went to art school.  Drafting might not be particularly exciting, but it's steady work."
"Thank you," she repeated, and then, at the last second, she twisted around in the chair.  "Officer Rogers said to keep an eye out for one of the boys here, maybe you know him?
There was a beat of a pause.  “Of course, sir.  I shall put the kettle on now, by the time they come in, I’m sure some cocoa and a bit of bread and jam would be appreciated.  After all, they’ll be cold and tired.”  Another beat.  “I do assume this request encompasses all three parties?  Not just the younger ones?”
Steve stared up at it, stymied.  It was flanked on all sides by huge metal tables, piled high with boxes of bottles and tubs of glassware.  There were other tables, there, smaller ones covered with a variety of unfamiliar equipment, and racks upon racks of seedlings.  There were round glass jugs labeled with rows of what seemed like random letters, and metal tins stacked on wooden shelves.
Tony stared at the sink. “Please tell me that it's not a congressional summons,” he said, his voice dire.
“You're flirting with my ex.  Right in front of me,” Tony said, tucking his hands in his pockets.  “The gall of you, Rogers.  The absolute gall.”
Tony pried an eye open, staring without any real interest at the gray, dank Manhattan skyline.  It looked cold and heavy and dark, and Tony wanted nothing more than to roll over and pull the blankets over his head.  It felt like he hadn't slept well in days.  Probably because he hadn't.
“She's lying,” he said.  He rolled his shoulders.  “Say hi to DJ for me, okay?  Tell him I found him a souvenir.” It was a giant stuffed turtle with big, sleepy eyes and a dopey grin.  Steve loved it.
“Mr. Stark designed it,” Rhodes said, lifting the hood on a nearby car.  “And built it, for that matter, but the design was the hard part.”
“In more ways than one, I’m starting to think,” she said.  She grinned up at Steve, and there was glitter around her eyes, pale blue and silver.  She handed up a five dollar bill.  “Put the rest in your sandwich fund, or, you know, your campaign chest.”
Ellen's teeth dug into the pen cap.  “No,” she said.  She forced her jaws to relax and tossed the pen onto her desk.  “Not a peep.  All we've gotten was the Avengers press release, and the one from SHIELD.”
Jarvis stepped out of the door, waiting until Tony exited the library before he responded.  “We had a bit of an incident in the kitchen,” he said, his voice pitched low.  He headed for the staircase, and Tony fell into step with him.  “DJ was assisting Mrs. Parker in shelling the last of the peas from the greenhouse, and chef started to grind a batch of coffee beans.”
If you'd like to see some of the 'highlights,' consider checking out this video, from one of my favorite YouTube Channels:
It was a little too loud, a little too sharp, and Coulson looked up, his eyebrows arching.  Tony took a deep breath, doing his best to get himself back under control.  "Why,” he repeated, much quieter this time.  “Why.   Is the press here?"
The robot came a sudden, almost violent stop, its weight cracking the pavement beneath its massive feet.  Its head swung from one side, and then back, servos whining as its joints flexed.  Tony's eyes narrowed.  “Jarvis, what's the energy spike we're getting-”
She held out a hand, and Steve stepped forward, taking it and raising it to his lips in a theatrical gesture.  Tony stomped down on a wholly irrational spike of jealousy.  “If you’ve ever a need for a good suit, I demand the right of first refusal,” she said.  “If you’re going to jilt me so cruelly, you owe me that much.”
Steve looked up, his eyes dancing.  “I think I’m capable of doing both at once,” he pointed out, his voice stern.  He hipchecked the bedroom door open.  “Let’s bed.”
“Forgive me for waking you.  There is no emergency, however, I require your assistance,” Jarvis said.
Tony's stomach turned over, his skin icing over in an instant.  Almost as quickly as it had hit, it was gone, his face going hot as he turned to stare at Steve.  “What?” he managed.
Nat picked up her bowl.  “On it,” she said.  “Meet you in the gym?”  Jan nodded.  “Give me ten to get the equipment we need.  It was a late night, I'm going to have trouble moving it.”
Steve gave him a look that Tony couldn't read.  “I'm working on it.”  He turned back to the stove.  “I'll trust you to pick out a wine.  Just...  Don't tell me how much you paid for it.”
O'Brien reached for his coffee.  "There's no 'going with' here, Rogers," he said.  The cigar by his elbow smoldered in the ashtray, and he reached for it.  "He confessed."  He glanced up again, his eyebrows drawn up tight over his eyes.  "Confessed to being a communist and trying to take out Mr. Stark for the good of the cause."
Her rough face softened as Steve handed over the paper wrapped packet.  "Ah, but a good boy you are, too good to an old lady like me."  She turned it over in her hands.  "Soup bones?"
“Won’t!”  Ten minutes would hopefully give him enough time to find his shoes.  Because at this point, asking Jarvis for a hint was not an option.
“So.” Steve ran a hand over his hair, undoing the hair and makeup department's careful work with one swipe of his fingers. “Uh. When did you get here?”
Tony's head came up, and he struggled to focus on Bruce, who was staring at him with a face like a thundercloud.  Tony took a breath, and another, his chest aching.  “Plates.  UP,” he said, and someone took the plates away from him, whisking them out of reach before he could fuck them up even more.  Tony was grateful for that much, at least.
The room service waiter smiled, just a little, as he rolled the first of the two oversized food carts into place next to the table.  “I just deliver it, sir, but I wouldn’t be concerned.” He held out an envelope to Tony with one gloved hand.  “Compliments of the house.”
“Thank God.  If you’re not here to scold me, feel free to come in,” Tony called, rocking back in his chair.
The door to Hammer’s office was hanging open, crooked on its hinges, the broken glass still scattered across the worn wood of the floor.  Steve picked his way through the carnage, trusting Tony to follow his lead.  At the edge of the door, he glanced back, and Tony gave him a nod.
"Leave it," she mouthed. There was an odd look on her face. "Don't-" She shook her head. "Leave it all."
DJ looked back at Steve, his eyes narrowed.  Steve did his best to look trustworthy.  DJ gave a quick, sharp nod, and leaned in.  "Ramen," he said, in the tones of someone conveying a very important piece of information.
“I’m actually going to do a little poking around,” Steve said.  “While I appreciate the cottage, it-”  He rubbed a hand on the back of his neck with a slight grimace.  “It needs a little work.”
There was a moment of silence, and then Justin lunged to his feet, knocking his chair over backwards.  It hit the floor with a crash, and Justin stood there, his hands in fists at his sides.  “I- I- I-”  His throat worked, and he gave the table a vicious push.  A wineglass wobbled on its base and tipped over, the red wine splashing across the snowy white tablecloth.  “I’m doing better than you.  Aren’t I?”  His face flushed, his eyes too bright behind his glasses, he drew himself to his full height.  “I’m doing much better than you.  And I always will.”
“Oh God, she is.” Tony pressed a hand to his face.  “So.  So.  Rhodey and Peter went to pour me into the shower, those two-” He gestured at Jess and Carol. “Were lighting sugar on fire in my kitchen.  And you stripped down to your shorts and sang a novelty song, until you were tempted by the leavings of their burnt sugar, and you went into the kitchen.
Her lips twitched.  “I do not have children,” she said, and Tony let out a breath he hadn’t even been aware that he was holding.
“Which is, unfortunately, what I bring,” Obie said.  He gave DJ a smile, fumbling at his pockets.  “Hello there, young man.  I brought some candy for you, let’s see, where did I-”
DJ stared down at his soup, his stomach churning.  “Can I ask you?” he asked, and stopped.  He looked at Agatha.  “Ask you something?”  She nodded, her tea cup held gracefully in one hand and the piece of garlic bread in the other.  “How…”  He shifted in his seat, his spoon tapping against the edge of his bowl, regular as a clock ticking.  “You thought I was her.  But I’m not…”  He looked down at the tablecloth, at the tiny white specs of soup that arced away from the movement of his spoon  Perfectly imperfect.  He stilled his spoon with a great deal of effort.  “Not as strong.  Won’t ever be as strong.”
"Not as important as you," Steve said.  "Nothing..."  He leaned in.  "Nothing is as important as you."
“”I’m not.  I’m selling you both to the Smithsonian for a button,” Tony said.  “AI wing.  Start low.  Work our way up.”
A slight shrug.  “Don’t think my dad likes the desert,” he said, the words careful.  His head came up.  “Not anymore.”
"Wonderful, you've been here for, what, two days, and we've managed to completely destroy any moral compass that you might've had," Tony said, plucking the candlestick from DJ's grasp.  DJ made a hopping attempt to grab it again, and Tony struggled between screaming and laughing.
There was a grace to the movement, as close to art as he got, a twist of his wrist, practiced and assured, and he scooped up a spoon, using the bowl of it to spread the puree across the plate.  The dessert settled in the center of the design, and he chased it with pinch of glittering power, letting it float from his fingertips.  The flowers had just enough bend to them that he could shape them to the spots where they needed to go, even after the time in the fridge.
“Hi,” Steve said, and her eyes came up to meet his.  Her moth dropped open as Steve took off his ball cap.  “I hear you’ll be marrying us today.”
“No,” Tony said, and Harris wasn’t sure if he was talking to him or Steve.  Or both of them.  Tony took a step forward.  “Marry me.  Tonight.  Today.”  He reached out, his fingers cradling the line of Steve’s jaw.  “Steve.  There’s nothing we’re doing here that we can’t do at home.  You want the big ceremony with every hero in the tri-state area in attendance?”
“You’re a natural,” the woman told him with a grin.  “Save your ammunition for the main event.” She looked at Harris, who was blowing the petal away from his eyebrow.  “And for the last time, you’re in Vegas.  I’ve been working for a 24 hour wedding chapel since I was 19.  What makes you think you can surprise me?”
“It absolutely wasn’t,” Darcy said.  She gave Harris a quick kiss, ruffling his hair with one hand.  “How’re we doing?”
“Welcome,” DJ said, his lips forming the single word with care.  He looked up at Tony, and Tony reached out and ruffle DJ's dark hair.  Giggling, DJ leaned into the contact.  “Help?”
The photographer grinned from behind his camera.  “Yeah, I figured that out.”  He took a couple of quick shots, and Steve did his best not to flinch.  “Who's it for?”
Her smile lit her face, and he had the idle thought that his Ma would've liked her.  Would've liked her a lot.  “Glad to meet you, Steve.”
"I filed my story last night.  It's over.  It's done," Ellen muttered into her pillow.  "I don't care about anything, because I filed my damn story.”
Jarvis’ eyes shut, a faint shudder rolling over him.  “We do not discuss such things, sir, not since your adult teeth came in so fine and straight despite it.”  He took a deep breath.  “He has not hurt himself unduly.  He will likely have quite a bruise on his arm tomorrow, but Mrs. Parker is quite adept at kissing such things better.”
Drew groaned, but stood up.  “What am I supposed to do?  Discuss the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox with them?”
“One ought not to question some things,” Agatha said, slapping a hat onto her head.  DJ wasn’t sure where it had come from.  She collected her cane.  “Let us see what we can find out, shall we?” she asked Wanda, who nodded.
“That’s the conclusion I’ve reached as well,” Steve said, smiling back.  Sam walked past again, arms piled high with pots.  “He’s stealing my furniture now, though, so, that’s going to be a problem.”
“This is just asking for paparazzi photos,” Tony said from the doorway, and Steve tipped his head back, squinting against the sunlight.
Jesse took it from her, her brow furrowing as she thought.  “Ah, I think that's one of Clark's,” she said.  “It never got published, because it's not particularly good framing, an' Duck said we weren't a damn tabloid.”
"We washed it!" Peter said.  Tony looked at him.  "We gave it a really..." He gave Tony a very confident smile.  "Thorough bath."
"We didn't talk about the people who preyed on the new arrivals, the people with literally nothing to their names and everything to lose. We didn't talk about the race lines in the city, the way the cops'd take a kickback from just about anyone to look the other way. We didn't talk about the political machines that ran the city, that ran everything, and stole from everyone. We didn't talk about the graft and the protection money and the kids working in dark, cramped, hot rooms and women doing piecework by inadequate light at all hours of the night for starvation wages."
“I didn't-” Steve's face felt like it was on fire.  “I mean, not like-”  Sam didn't say a thing, and he burst out, “I did not have sexual fantasies about Tony.”  Which sounded like a lie, even to him.  He pressed a hand to his face.
Fury's smile was slow, but real.  “If anyone can prove me wrong, Captain, it would be you.”  He stood.  “Heads up, people.  Let's get everyone on the same page, before the landscape changes again.”
“DJ!” he yelled, taking off running down the front path.  “DJ, where have you-”  He stumbled to his knees, reaching out, catching the boy by the shoulders, and the kid turned, eyes wide, hands up to fend him off.
Clint and Tony exchanged a look.  Darcy leaned forward.  “Yeah, but doesn’t mean you’re comfortable around someone who made the mistake, Deej.”
He nodded, his pale hair flopping over his forehead.  "Everyone down these parts knows Officer Rogers," he said.  He leaned up against Hammer's battered desk, rocking his weight back on his heels, clearly happy to stay and gossip.  "He's a good one.  Most of the police round here, they'd as soon give you a sound thrashing as talk to you, but Rogers is a decent one.  He knows everyone, by name even, an' he's fair.”
“And yet, this is so much better.”  Her chin came up, and she gave Steve a narrow eyed look.  “You send me back there, I will starve.”
Jarvis set the tea pot down, dusting off his hands.  “It is neither the pieces, nor the players that concern me,” he said, his voice quiet.  He turned in his seat.  “It is the rules.   Rules that bind our movements, our choices, and most importantly, the winning conditions.
“No, we're not.”  Sam stood.  “Steve.  Look.  Six months from now, what will you regret?  Taking the chance, or not taking it?”
“Oh my God,” Jan said from inside.  “It's like he's living in an IKEA catalog.  It's-  It's monochrome horribleness, and you know he paid some decorator a hundred grand to make his bedroom look like an IKEA catalog.”  She popped back out.  “Steve.  Steve.  You have to see this.”  She grabbed his hand and dragged him forward.
“As I said, very discerning guests,” Jarvis agreed.  “I shall let you know when dinner is expected, in the meantime, perhaps you can make yourself useful and being opening some boxes, sir, Happy and Bobbi will be back soon with the tree, and a bit of prep work would be appreciated.”
“Fuck you,” Steve said, the words thin and cold and so full of rage that he could barely force them out.
Tony took a deep breath.  “I'm a mechanic at heart, Steve,” he said, his voice blunt.  “And rings can be-”  He flexed his fingers.  “Small spaces and moving metal parts, if it gets caught on something...”
“Guys try it with me all the time,” Clint said, his fingers walking idly up the length of his bowstring.  “Which is fine with me, if they really want blow job tips, I'll totally give them some.”  Everyone stared at him.  Clint shrugged.  “Like, I got nothing better to do, I could aim in my sleep, so this kind of livens things up.”
“We have outflanked you,” Marcy said.  She gave him a bright smile.  “And we didn't even have to try particularly hard.”
The sound of chair legs scraping across the polished floor snapped Tony out of his thoughts.  He looked up as DJ hopped off of his chair.  “And where are you going?” he asked, as DJ collected his pad of paper.
DJ took the toast, taking a delicate bite from the crust.  He smiled at Tony over the edge of the toast, and Tony smiled back.  "Is it good?" Tony asked, leaning back into the pillows.  "Jarvis, did you make the toast?"
He turned and headed for the stairs, leaving Steve staring at the empty hearth.  By the time the words sank in, he was halfway to the second floor.  “Move some people around?” he asked, not understanding that, or maybe not wanting to understand that.  “What the hell does that mean?”
“Can you stop gaslighting him for a second here?” Carol said, her arms crossed over her chest.  “And also, I think there's a difference between people we hook up with and people we get into relationships with.  Not just Tony.”  One of her shoulders rose and fell in a half shrug.   “Are we going for a one shot or-”
“Horrible child,” Tony told him with a smile.  He crossed the room, squinting up at one of the door panels.  He reached up, his fingers poking at the hinges.  “I do not know what I’ve done to deserve such disdain.”
“It happens,” Steve said.  He glanced over his shoulder.  “He knows it happens.  He's going to teach me how to make rice porridge for you.”
“After last night's bath adventure, I think I'm clean enough,” Tony said, turning off the water and reaching for a towel.
The blonde man in front of the reception desk blinked.  “Uh, no.” He shifted in place.  “Or yes.  But not far that far in the future.”
“Do you think this is a problem everyone has at their wedding reception?” Steve asked Sam.  “This seems like a common thing. Maybe they mention it in 'Modern Bride.'”
Before he could lose his mind, or whatever was left of his morals, enough to do it, Steve moved.  He pushed himself up, and extended a hand to Tony.  Tony took a breath, and let it out.  “You're a thief, Rogers,” he said, taking Steve's hand and letting Steve pull him up.  “A dirty thief.”
“God, he’s just as annoying as you,” Clint said, leaning forward to brace his hands on his thighs.  “Except, you know, I don’t give a flying fuck about him, so, somehow he’s worse.”  He looked up.  “How the hell did you find us?”
She balanced the bowl between her palms.  “It means something.  Still.  Even after all this time.” She handed him the bowl and turned her attention back to her kettle, steam curling around her face.  “Be careful with that shield, boy.  I won’t be the only one to remember it.
In one fluid movement, Steve pulled away, leaned over, snagged the keys, jammed them into the lock and wrenched the door open.  Laughing, Tony tried to step aside, but Steve tossed his keys in the general direction of the hallway table and wrapped an arm around his waist.  “This is very good for my ego,” Tony said, struggling to keep his breathing under control.  “Really.  This is-”
The whole thing took less than a minute, and Pepper found herself on her feet, her handbag clutched to her chest.  The hinges on the office door creaked, and she collapsed back into her seat with more speed than grace.  Hammer plodded past, a stack of folders balanced in his arms.  "Now, now," he crowed, his broad face flushed with exertion.  He dropped the folders onto the desk with a thump, and grinned at her, his spectacles crooked on his nose.  "Let's find you a proper little urchin!”
“Oh my God.”  Jess had her face in her hands, and Carol was bent double behind her, laughing so hard that she was crying.  Luke had his arms crossed over his chest, staring at Clint with his mouth hanging open just a little bit.  Sam was just shaking his head, his eyes squeezed shut.
Tony paused, cup halfway to his mouth.  He smiled back.  “Clea?  If you proved to be a threat?  I would find a way to stop you.”
“Clear the street, and get that girl out of there,” Steve snapped, and the robot swung again, fending Thor off, and it clipped the edge of a building scaffold, knocking the whole thing sideways.  Tony went in shooting, trying to disintegrate the pieces before they could hit the ground, low level repulsor blasts taking out wooden platforms and chunks of metal pipe.
Steve picked his way up the main aisle, frowning down at the beds of delicate greens and vegetables he had no name for.  Everything smelled faintly of wet soil, that thick smell that came in the wake of a heavy rainstorm, and the floor was still damp. He glanced up, staring at the network of pipes that ran along just under the glass panes of the ceiling.  There were sprinkler heads there, some of them still dripping.
In the silence that followed, the sound of the pot being returned to the coffee maker was very loud.  “Why the sudden concern?”
“He had little use for other people, and he had little tact when dismissing those who annoyed him.  He drank heavily and often, and that did not make him easier to deal with.”  Jarvis met Steve’s eyes.  “He hit Anthony once.”
“You fell asleep in the kitchen,” Jarvis stated.  “Captain Rogers, returning from his run, found you there and put you to bed.”
Rhodey reached out, his fingers gentle as he caught Tony’s wrist, pulling his hand away from his chest.  Tony looked down, surprised to find that his fingers were locked in a deathgrip on the fabric of his shirt.  He let go with a wince, and let Rhodey pull his hand down.  “I’m fine,” he repeated.
He knew that voice.  DJ scrambled to his feet, almost knocking the table aside in his haste, and Harris was right there, a few feet away, and Darcy was right next to him, holding onto his arm, and they looked just like he remembered them, just like he’d known them.
Tony pulled a face.  “Well, when you put it like that, it just sounds tawdry.”  He punched the elevator button and leaned back against the wall, grateful for the moment of rest, no matter how fleeting.   “Sorry, Jay.  I haven't-”  He scraped a hand over his face.  “I haven't been sleeping particularly well.”
Tony didn't even slow down.  Even if he'd wanted to, trying to stop Pepper mid-way through a song was dangerous, if not impossible.  "Good afternoon, officer!" he said, his voice pitched to be heard above the rollicking beat of the music.  "Are you done with your investigation?”
“Thank you, ma’am.  It’s appreciated.”  He headed up the stairs towards the door of the tenement.  “It’s always appreciated.”
"It's going to look like a flag with daffodils stapled to it," Tony said, leafing through the pages.  Jan aimed a kick at his ankle, and he skittered sideways, grinning.  "Did you get the lobster?"
“Happy?” Tony said.  “Go make a significant donation to the good Father’s collection plate to thank him for his assistance.” He met Happy’s eyes.  “And stall for time.”
“A risk I’m willing to take,” Tony said.  He waited until the were all gone, and turned to Pepper.  “Do you really think he’s a threat?”
"That will take care of everything for now, Mr. Stark," he said, closing the folder and adding it to the stack. "Let us know when you're ready to file."
Natasha touched his wrist, the barest brush of her fingertips against his hand, and DJ peeked out at her from between his fingers.  She was smiling, just a little, her eyes half closed as she studied him.  “It's okay,” she said.  “Take a breath.”  He sucked in a breath, held it for a moment, and then let it out.  She nodded.  “We'll figure it out.  All of us.”
Steve looked at Shuri.  Shuri, half hidden behind the big wooden bowl, held very still, her dark eyes wide.  Steve set his bag down beside the door and shrugged his shield off of his back.  “Buck.”
“So the hot tub ended up full of idiots,” Natasha said, her voice expressionless, “and Jell-O.  And Jell-O covered idiots.”  She paused.  “Until the, you know, massive amounts of sugar and gelatin in the water caused the filter to clog, then the motor overheated, then-”
DJ was fiddling with something in his pocket, his head down.  “Are you okay?” he repeated, and Tony glanced at him.
“What is wrong with you?  Seriously?” Sam asked, and Steve was laughing as he headed back to the ballroom.
The apartment had an awkward layout, long and narrow, with a set of steep stairs against the wall leading up to the loft, like it had been carved out of space leftover when bigger and better floorplans had been completed around it.  From his vantage point, he could see only the edge of some that might've been a living room, the back of a couch and kitchen table pushed up against the wall, directly below the skylights, where it'd get the most sunlight.
He stood.  “Who knows you’re keeping him?  And who would be in a place to profit from that knowledge?”
Tony stared at him, and Stark settled back into his seat.  “After all,” Stark said, his voice quiet, “your father hit you, didn’t he?  When you refused to listen.  When you were a disappointment. Your father hit you.  That is what fathers do.”
“Good night.”  He waited until she slipped out of the function room, then he reached for the trash can.
“Did I ask?” she said, her voice tinged with acid.  She jerked her chin at the car.  “Get in.  Both of you.  Goddamn idiots.”  She looked across the road, and yelled to Happy, “How did I go from being the Mad Dog of Fisk’s mob to being the voice of reason?  How does that HAPPEN?”
“Right,” Jessica said.  “I was going to ask 'why' you didn't live here, but that answers it pretty clearly, thank you.”
“What was she hoping to accomplish?” Rhodey asked, leaning against the edge of the workbench.  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “She had to know he was going to be discovered, he’s not cut out to be a spy.”
“No, because Steve refuses to get married without a pre-nup and Dad refuses to get married with a pre-nup and they’ve been in a standoff over it for like, three years now,” he said.  He stopped.  “Clint got ordained.  As a justice of the peace.  He says they’re going to end up needing to do it somewhere for some stupid reason and now he’s ready.”  He stopped.  “Like that scene in Pirates of the Carribean.”
Steve shook his head.  "The world's hard enough, right now.  It's like the politicians who open soup kitchens when they want the press, when they want the votes, then shutter them when they're not useful to 'em anymore."  The more frustrated he got, the worst his accent got, the street kid still there, fists clenched, just under the surface.  He shook off the thought.  "And who cares about the men who'd depended on that meal?"
DJ bounced up, throwing himself into Steve’s arms.  Steve scooped him up, hugging him close.  His face was tight, his eyes squeezed shut.  “Thank you.”
Jarvis darted to the side, and before Tony could manage to push himself upright again, something moved to his side.  Something small.  And slight.  And fast.
“She’s a very helpful lady,” Jan said.  She held her hands out to DJ.  “Hello, my darling.  Come here, you’re covered in flour.”
“I can work from that, honestly,” Bucky said.  He reached for the cream puffs.  “Like I sad, it's nothing personal, Stark, Steve's just a private sort of person, and you take up a lot of room.”
“Who's going to tell her?” Stark said, his voice belligerent, and Clint, Natasha and Peter all raised their hands.  After a moment, DJ raised his hand, too.  Stark gave him a look.  “Traitor,” he said, but he was smiling.  “Fine.”  He pushed his stool back from the counter.  “Do we have any pie?  Or did Peter eat it all again?”
“Perhaps a pair of house slippers?” Miss Van Dyne said, peering at the seams of Steve's borrowed jacket.  She made a disappointed noise. “There's not enough to here for me to let out.”
Steve moved cautiously around her, ducking his head to clear the threshold.  “I suppose it will,” he said.
Once upon a time, there was a king who died.  Once upon a time, there was a kingdom, still held sway by its once and future king.  Once upon a time, the man that killed him did not know he had not succeeded.
Tony paused, the paper cup of cheap coffee that he'd been given when he'd gotten in this god forsaken line hovering inches from his mouth.  "We got shot down over your airspace," he said, his voice flat.  "By Doctor Doom."  He raised one tuxedo clad arm.  It had gotten through the whole mess relatively unscathed.  He wasn't sure how.  "He invited us to a party.  There were actual invitations and RSVP cards, it was-”  He shook his head. “We came to a party.  And then he decided to shoot at us."
“You’re close enough to my size, you can borrow whatever you want,” Harris said.  He paused, not sure how to say this.  “Before, we got you Thor’s sweatshirt? Do you want-”
Steve reached for his phone, still in easy reach on the bedside table.  "Now, Mr. Stark, I think we all know that I stand for truth, justice, and the American-"  Tony snatched the phone out of his fingers, leaving Steve grinning down at his empty hand.  "Now, that was just uncalled for."
Sam winced.  “Right.  Gotcha.”  He pulled a box away from Steve.  “This one's done, get another one.”
Maguire gave Steve a speaking look out of the corner of his eyes.  “Gettin’ comfortable, are we, Rogers?” he asked, with a twist of his lips.  “Didn’t expect to find you outta uniform.  Thought you were on assignment, not vacation.”
She gave him a look, her eyes narrowed into brilliant slits, even as she held out a pale, tasteful card to Steve.  “I bet he knows more than you’d like him to,” she said, her voice silken.  Tony rocked on the balls of his feet, but said nothing.  She turned to Steve.  “Call me.”
“Absolutely not,” Tony said, throwing back the blankets before Steve could stop him.  He was wearing a pair of unfamiliar flannel pajama pants, but they fit him better than the shirt did.  He stared down at his legs until his head started spinning.  “Tell me these were a gift.”
The silence was sudden and absolute.  DJ’s eyes flicked open, and found that the world around him had frozen in place, a tendril of nothingness hanging motionless in space right in front of him.  The glow from his hand was stronger now,  bright enough to throw shadows across the walls, across the bookshelves.  Everything else was still.  Frozen.
“Making a deep, meaningful statement about environmental issues and popular culture in the current-”
Steve nodded.  “Hammer.  He’d have to do the paperwork, so he knows, he knows enough, and he’s always looking for money.  We don’t want the hired muscle.  We want Hammer.”
“Probably just me and Buster Keaton, but, again, I didn’t have anything to do with it,” Harris said.  “And I felt worse for the philharmonic than I did for my insurance agent.”
“Look at this.” Jesse held the camera out to Ellen. “He looks like he's been filibustering congress over health care for children for twelve hours. Exhausted and frustrated, but resolute. Stoic.”
“Apparently so, because here you are.”  Tony waved a hand at DJ and Rogers.  “The small goblin has not attempted to smuggle any of my tools out of the workshop today, and thus, should be rewarded.”
Steve nodded, and reached for the shield.  It was lighter than anything he’d ever handled, and he ran his fingertips across the surface, feeling the absolute perfection of the design, of the execution.  He shifted it over his arm, and then, onto his back.  It settled there as if it had been made for him, which, he supposed that it had.  But the moment it fell into place, the weight a fraction of what his body remembered, something relaxed, deep in his chest.
“Really.” And that explained why Hammer and Happy hadn't needed an introduction. Steve wondered if it had been Pepper or Tony that had set it up, and what, exactly their offer had been.
“Well, it is the season for miracles,” Sam said.  He paused.  “Want me to come over and be your fashion consultant?”
“Deej, you want to come?” Tony asked, and DJ held up his hands, wiggling his fingers.  “Ah, I see that Mrs. Parker already scrubbed you down.’
Jess looked at Steve, a hopeful look on her face.  He smiled at her.  “I think we can get churros,” he said.
Drew stared at DJ.  DJ stared back, his lips pursed around the straw of his juice box.  Drew’s eyes narrowed.  “You’re a Stark,” he said to DJ.
“What is-” he started to ask Strange, and DJ pulled away from him, slamming his fists against the portal.  Once, twice.   He stumbled back, and he was crying now, his shoulders shaking.  Harris caught him by the shoulders, only barely aware when the conference room door opened.
DJ wasn’t sure if Harris was talking to him, but he nodded anyway.  “It’s a small company,” he said. “When I found him.  Just a few people.  They were-  Were running a Kickstarter.  To finish their game.  And it wasn’t you, but it was you, and…”  His shoulders jerked up in a shrug.  “Wanted him to finish his game.”
He looked back at the fountain, familiar and foreign, all at once, and felt more sure of what he was about to say than just about anything he’d ever said in his life.  “You can stay, if you want.”
"Okay."  Steve braced his hands on his thighs.  Tony slumped back against the cabinets, his chest heaving with the force of his breathing.  Other than that, there was no indication of movement.  Steve sighed.  "We have a timeline for when you're going to do it?"
Tony glared in Steve's direction.  “For a man who is supposed to be good under fire, Rogers, you panic easily when it's a camera aimed at you and not a gun.”
“Not those specific things, not specifically,” Peter said.  Jarvis’ other eyebrow raised.  Peter huffed out a breath.  “I might have breached a subject or two, in a very roundabout way.”
“No time like the present to learn,” Clint said.  He was dancing a box step with a woman half a head taller than him, who was probably old enough to be his mother.  “Come on, Doc, let's cut a rug.”
A Roomba floated past him, wobbling through the air and stopped, halfway under a table, executing a slow, easy loop.  It hovered there, swinging slowly back and forth, and then turned and moved a few feet away.  Stopped.  Rotated.  Went back.
Shuri slid down, catching her horse’s bridle and following Okoye’s lead.  She hopped up onto the stone wall, and her horse nudged against her hands.  Laughing, Shuri stroked a hand over the horse’s nose, smoothing the dappled gray fur under her fingers.  “Fine.” She leaned forward, pressing a kiss to the horse’s forehead.  “You need to eat, don’t you, my darling?”
“No, it is fine.”  She paused.  “Would you explain to DJ?  He is...  He is upset.  He has a hard time, when his schedule changes without warning.  Do you have the Facetime?”
DJ looked at it, and rolled into a sitting position.  “No,” he said, wrapping his arms around his knees.  “Sorry.”
Some of the strain went out of Steve’s shoulders.  “Thanks, Deej, I appreciate it.”  DJ nodded, and Steve headed out to the main buffet area.
Steve leaned over his shoulder.  “I've had enough bad propaganda pictures of me punching world leaders in circulation,” he said.  “I'm not faking it with a cardboard cutout.”
"Don't you like the rain, Tony?" Steve said, shoving a hand through his hair.  The wet strands tangled around his fingers.  "Come on out."
“I’m in,” Carol said immediately.  “I don’t even care about the croissants.  I missed one brawl last night, I’m not missing another one.”
“What’s the worst that could happen?” Harris asked.  “Seriously.  If I stand up right now and say, ‘Hey, world, come and get me,’ what’s the worst thing that could happen?”
“Yeah.” Danny tossed his plate at the nearest flat surface.  It might've broken.  “I’m a better kisser than you.”
“I did move a little bit,” Tony said. “I moved this far. And that was far enough.” He smiled, and Steve felt that against his skin, and his arms tightened. “This... This is good.”
Clint looked at DJ.  “Would I give you a ‘What Happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas’ t-shirt in your world?” he asked.  DJ thought about that for a second, and then nodded.  “See?  On brand.”
Shuri made a face.  “I am not hungry,” she said, her voice arch, even as everyone started digging in bags and pouches.  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “I know what this is, this is just a distraction from the very real business I am trying to conduct, and-”
Steve was suddenly in front of him, and Tony looked up, startled.  Steve's mouth opened, then closed.  Wordlessly, he held out a sheet of paper.  Never breaking eye contact, Tony took it from him.  Steve's throat bobbed as he swallowed.  “Tony.”
It sat down next to Harris’ plate.  It reached out with one paw, tapping the edge of the china.  Harris picked it up and moved it out of the way, and the cat immediately took its place, staring at Harris with fathomless eyes.
He dipped his spoon into the soup, stirring it and watching the steam rise from the surface.  “And do not take gold from their hand.  In the light of day, you’ll find you’ve sold your soul for a fallen leaf or hedgeberry, shriveled and brittle.”
“Please, I haven’t wrecked a car in at least six months,” Bobbi said.  Her eyes slid sideways, looking at Steve.  “You know why.”
“Excuse me?” Tony gestured up towards the second floor landing, where Rogers had just disappeared.  “I wasn't-”
There was a moment of silence on the other end of the line.  "Hello to you, too," Tony said, his voice wry.  "How are you?  Having a nice evening?  Enjoying yourself?"
Bobbi crossed her legs, settling the file on her knee.  “I think you’re right,” she said.  “Do you want to share, Officer Rogers?”  She looked up, the hard line of her brows arching as she flipped through the pages.  “Or did you not know?”
Steve held them out to him, and Tony stared at them, caught off guard.  “I saw them in the flower market,” Steve said, and he was grinning, his eyes the color of the morning sky, dark blue with a faint glow of gold in its depths.  “And thought of you.”  He looked down at the blooms, dark green leaves slipping between his fingers.  He glanced back up, and he was grinning, so bright and happy and alive that Tony's chest ached.
“‘Perhaps?’” Tony repeated.  “Why perhaps?  Toast.  Butter.  Jam.  No egg.  Absolutely no apple.”  DJ giggled, and Tony tried to muster a glare for him, but it was a failure.  “Oh, is this funny?”  DJ nodded, his eyes dancing, and Tony hid his grin behind his newspaper, rattling the pages in front of him.  “Fine.  Then you may eat my egg as well as yours.”
Tony looked at him, his eyes narrowed, as if he was looking for some sort of hidden meaning in Rogers's very straightforward words. “Yes,” he said at last. It sounded a bit like a question.  “I mean.  I’m not.  Jan is.  Because Jan doesn’t have any idea how to do things by half measures.  It’s part of her charm, but sometimes, honestly, she’s-”
“Well,” Iron Man said, drawing the word out.  “Clea showed up and told me that everything was our resident magical bullfighter’s fault, at which point, I decided I was done with this shit, and she brought me to New York, where everyone was supposed to be, only to find out that no one was there, except a very frustrated Coulson, who knew, surprisingly, nothing.”
“I’ll see what I can do,” she said, peering up the ladder.  “You know that’s for food storage, right?  That’s where we put apples.  And preserves.”
It looked like cleanup was underway, but there were still remnants of the previous night's celebration.  He folded his arms on the railing, smiling down at the city.  It was stupid, it was so stupid, but he felt lighter than he had in a long time.  Happier.
“Fresh, hot, and as strong as we can make it,” the young man said cheerfully, reaching for a cup and a gleaming silver carafe.  He poured a cup off coffee with practiced ease, and held it out to Tony.  “Las Vegas knows two things, Mr. Stark: Good times, and hangovers.”
Bobbi met his eyes with a faint smile.  “Kind of surprised it wasn’t just left standing open,” she said, pulling the door open and waving him past her.
Tony stared down at his phone.  “You gave PEPPER my plant,” he said, bracing a hand on his hip.  “PEPPER.”
Harris reached out, patting her on the knee.  “Darce?”  She leaned in.  Harris smiled at her.  “NOPE.”
Once he was back on the main floor, Steve settled down into one of the more stable kitchen chairs, ignoring the way it creaked under his weight.  "I've never seen your dad when he's sick before.  I made him some tea and toast."  DJ nodded, and Steve smiled at him.  ""What do you think?   Tea and toast?  Is that what you have when you're sick?"
And his father was seated at the head of the table, a massive tome open in front of him, a tray of sushi balanced on one upthrust knee.
“So what’s your solution?” Steve asked.  “To sit here, in your house on the hill, making up a private army and waiting until you can make things perfect before you do anything?  And to hell with everyone who’s dying while you’re waiting for the stars to align?”
There was a thick file folder sitting in the middle of the seat, and looking at it, Steve felt his stomach flip over, and he didn’t know why.  But when Bobbi slid into the car from the other side, his hand twitched, making an instinctive move towards it.
"I had such fun!" she said.  She looked around, a pleased smile blooming on her face.  "I think it turned out really well.  This is going to be the party of the season."
“I'll let you know if anything changes,” Coulson said, grabbing Clint by the back of his vest.  “You.  Sit back down.”
“Twenty-four, seven, baby,” Trip said, not even looking up from her copy of Rolling Stone.  “Though we do close early on Christmas Day and open late on New Year’s Day.”  She flicked the edges of the pages down, peeking over the top.  “You looking for a future booking?”
Another arrow hit the wall, mere inches from Happy’s head.  Happy didn’t even seem to notice.  “He’s faster than you’d think, it’s a real treat to watch.”  He flipped the arrow in his hand over, catching it with a flick of his fingers.  “See?   This is-”  He gave the arrow an easy toss.  And this time, another arrow caught it broadside, the tip going through the shaft and slicing it in half.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, not missing a beat.  Tony gave him a suspicious look, and Jarvis smiled, just a bit.  “He’s not allowed to do many things.  Unfortunately, every attempt his aunt has made to make him understand his rather unenviable position as the child of the help has been undermined by her employer.”  He folded his hands behind his back, his body canting forward just a bit.  “Leaving him with a sense of himself as a valued and appreciated member of the household.”
Steve licked his lips.  “I-” There was no good answer to this, nothing that he could say that wouldn’t make it worse for Greer, and he’d made this mess himself; he had no one else to blame.  “Someone…  Someone likes Sam,” he said at last.  “And I just wanted to make sure that he wasn’t-” He gestured vaguely in Tony’s direction.  “Interested in-”  He stopped, frustrated.  “That you weren’t…”
Tony groaned.  “Listen, I don't think-”  He stopped, the words clicking in his brain a little too late.  “How do you know where I am?”
“I think we can be forgiven for not considering that possibility,” she mused.  “Again.  Ice.  Big block of ice.”
There was a moment of stillness.  Rhodey never lifted his head from Pepper's lap.  She grinned up at the sky, her expression amused.  Stark stared at him for a long, silent moment.  Then he closed his notebook and set it down next to him, placing the pencil deliberately on top of it.
Steve glanced over his shoulder as Jessica strode in, ready to spar in a pair of yoga pants and a sports bra.  Behind her, Luke was staring up at the ceiling, his mouth hanging open just a tiny bit.  He gestured at Clint. “Parker, what the hell?”
“Well, it's your lucky day, because I intend to show up this time,” Tony said.  “Just you and me and a couple of hundred boxes of ornaments.”
“I don't know,” he admitted.  “Don't even know if he has one.  Some of those kids, they don't.”  He smiled.  “But there's only one there by that name, you'll find him, if you look.”
“I’m trusting you to keep an eye on him,” Tony said, and Peter nodded.  He waved at DJ, who waved back.  “Go to bed, you rapscallion.”
He knew who it was, before he even got the door open, but still, finding DJ waiting on the other side made his stomach turn over.  “Deej?” he whispered, tightening the belt of his robe.  “What’s wrong, are you all right?”
“I apologize for speaking out of turn,” Jarvis said, his voice coming from a speaker in the ceiling. “But yes. You have returned safely to Avengers tower. It is nearly eight pm.”
Tony tossed his pencil aside, running a sharp hand through ihs hair.  “Why are you on his side, anyway?  Just once, why can’t you be-”  He stopped, his mouth pressing in a tight line.  “I’d never do that.  Hurt him that way, I mean.”
There was a moment of silence, and then a soft sigh.  Steve looked over to find Jarvis smiling at him.  Steve exhaled.  “Sorry.  It’s got nothing to do with you.”  He turned his attention back to packing.  “And you’ve been nothing but nice to me.”
"Thank you," Steve said, jogging around to the back.  Peter was fast, fast and efficient.  And he'd been trained in Tony's kitchen, everything was done with precision, and everything was done right.  Even as he climbed up into the truck, Peter was wiping down the counters, a bucket of bleach water steaming next to his elbow.  Steve exhaled, some of the strain going out of his shoulders.  "Really.  Thank you."
“I’m being recalled,” Steve said.  He heard sound of paper crumbling and looked down to find the page crushed between his fingers.  He smiled, a bitter little twist of his lips.  “Effective immediately.”
“I know enough about your housekeeping to suspect the child is being accurate in this,” Agatha said, as the other Strange was labeled as ‘Locally Grown.’  “To surmise, something went wrong, and the spell intended to protect him went too far?”
“Stop fussing,” Tony said, even as he relaxed into the double embrace of Steve’s arms and the coat.  “I’m fine.”  Steve’s hand found his again, and Tony raised it to his lips, pressing a kiss to Steve’s knuckles.  “I missed you.”
“I’m not 100% sure my legs are going to hold me much longer,” Tony said, bracing an elbow on the counter.  “So if you want some physical gratification, you’re going to have to come over here to get it.”
“We’re doing just fine,” she said.  “But I’ll be honest, it was kind of you to send that Mr. Hogan around.”
Behind Strange, a large man in a blue sweatshirt shifted, turning around to face Tony, and Tony’s breath froze in his lungs.
“He's a very busy man,” Tony explained to the gathered crowd.  “You should see his calendar.  It's-”
She stopped at the end of the line, her fingertip hovering over the shot of Steve Rogers, an embarrassed smile on his face, holding up his left hand to show off his ring.  Ellen tapped it.
“Which is good, because I need to go keep an eye on your loser of a father,” Rhodey said, reaching for his uniform jacket.  “But I can come back afterwards and you can show me how you unjammed that defective and poorly designed elbow joint that he foisted on me.”
“I tested it personally,” Jarvis said.  “No matter what I did, I could not manage to get it open.”  He picked up Tony’s cup of water and set it, with deliberate movements, closer to him on the edge of the table.  “I cannot imagine what the problem might be.”
“Ignore them.  They’ll be at this for a while.  What’s your question?” Fury asked, plucking a pickled egg out of the oversize jar with a fork.
“I have many secrets and that’s not one of them,” Tony said.  “I’m not sure which one of you is trying harder to kill me, at this point, it seems like it might be-”
"My door," Steve said.  "I finally got permission from my landlord, so I can finally get rid of the green."
Tony gave Steve a sympathetic look, but since Steve was sitting with his head buried in his hands, he probably missed it.  Amused, Tony went back to playing with his phone and waiting for this to be over.
Jesse took the picture out of her hand and held it out in front of her.  "Look closer," she said.  She braced a hand on the edge of the bed, her short hair falling forward over her forehead.  "Look at the goatee."
"Exactly."  Bruce's hand snapped up, pointing at Tony's station.  "Plating six is in four minutes, take over."
"Why are there bowls involved, do you like dirtying dishes, what purpose would-" Tony started, and Steve glanced at him, his face so full of affection that the words died unsaid in Tony's throat.
Seamus considered that. "Nah," he said, and Steve reached for his collar. Seamus tried to fend him off, but Steve was faster than him, bigger than him, and distinctly more determined than him. A moment later, the boy scrambled out of reach. "Geez, get off!"
“What we need and what we can do are two very different things,” Happy said.  “Besides, at these speeds, if a stray dog decides to make a break across the road, we’re going to have a bad time of it, so-”
“Just the ride share guy,” Darcy said, her voice breezy. “I didn’t want to leave my car at your place, and for some reason, your building doesn’t show up on GPS.”
The voice caught him off guard, and Tony's shoulders went tight.  But despite the provocation, he didn't turn around.  “Check with Bruce and Peter, I think they're down in the orchard,” he said to Bobbi, who nodded.  “He might be in one of the outbuildings.”
It was over as quickly as it had happened, the sound of the horn hanging in the air as the car shot past them.  An instant, and it was gone, going just as fast as they were, but towards the city instead of away from it.  Steve twisted in his seat, his hand braced against the dashboard, his heart pounding in his ears.  “Was that-”
Stark emerged from the pastry closet, a whole pie balanced on each hand.  He said something in French, and Steve wondered why the hell his voice seemed to get deeper and huskier when he did that.  Stark's eye caught Steve's, and he smiled, his lips curling around a word that sounded somehow obscene.
“Now, that’s possible,” Sam said, his head bobbing.  Steve yanked his door shut and started up the hallway, and Sam fell into step with him, head still tipped down towards his phone.  “Also possible that you were deliberately ditching me.”
"I'll see you.  After I eat."  Steve scowled at the empty chair where Tony should be.  "I-"  It had been so much effort, so much planning and so much energy and goddammit, he just wanted to have a nice meal.
“I don’t want to date Tony,” Steve said, and Sam just stopped running.  Steve kept going for a few steps, and then turned back.  Sam was just standing there, staring at him.  “What?”
Carol flexed, the impressive musculature of her arms stretching the fabric of her shirt.  “Guns,” she agreed, her teeth flashing in a bright grin.
Clint huffed out a breath.  “Right.  We're okay,” he repeated.  He smiled, and it was way too bright, way too broad.  “We're okay.”
A few minutes later, the door behind him opened, and he heard the familiar tread of Steve's boots.  He tipped his head back, a smile slipping over his face.  “What'd you bring me?”
“I’m sure that the steady diet of praise and pastries he’s getting from Mrs. Parker and the chef makes it a bit more palatable,” Rhodey mused, paging through a massive book.
“I expected him to smash it.”  Tony picked up a thin wafer of pickle from the plate, popping it into his mouth.  “I handed him an expensive piece of trash and a hammer and told him to have fun.”  He paused.  “I would’ve smashed it.”
“Tell me people don't actually think this way,” Steve said.  He sounded tired, his shoulders slumped forward.
“And when he’s angry, he forgets that.” Pepper gave the machine a nervous look.  Her voice dropped.  “Any progress?”
“He was worried about you,” Luke said.  With one last smile, he headed for the door.  “We all were.  Next time, leave being a landing pad to me.  I'm better at it.”
“Coffee,” Tony said, his voice stern, and laughing, Steve crossed the floor to hand him the cup.  Tony took it with a pleased sound.  “Thank you.”
“”You could, but no one will listen,” Tony said.  He unbuttoned his chef’s jacket, shrugging out of it.  “You’re late.”
Behind Jarvis's back, Stark turned around, his expression amused.  "He would," he said.  "Be happy.  To do all that additional work.  Moving furniture.  Scrubbing floors and walls and ceilings.  Airing out all the linens.  Hanging new-"
“Yes, sir,” she said.  Her eyes flicked over Tony's shoulder, and then back to his.  “Should I check in with Jarvis?:”
There was a slight pause, and then a sigh from the other end of the line.  “And in such things, he is most often correct,” T’Challa said.
"No one.  For now, we're stockpiling."  Miss Potts set her cup down with a click.  "We're betting everything on the fact that Tony is right."
“My apologies, sir,” Jarvis said, and Steve had to bite the inside of his mouth to keep from laughing.  “What were you going to ask about?”
“He know what happened?” Fury said, because Harris supposed he had a lot of experience with ignoring Tony Stark.  “And will he be trying to find you?”
“Don't,” he said, holding his hands out. “Pep, don't, it's not-” He smiled, and it hurt, but it that was fine, that was right. “Pep. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. You never-” His smile stretched. “You never left me. Not really. Not in any way that matters.”
In the silence that followed, Peter gestured at Clint with both hands.  “Clint Barton, ladies and gentlemen,” he said, and everyone was laughing now, everyone except Clint, who just grinned, unrepentant.  “Someone gave him government clearance.”
“Wait,” Peter said.  He was doing a conga line with half a dozen young men in very tight jeans.  “Wait, what?  What, Albuquerque, what happened in Albuquerque?”
“Yes, and we both know that he has never, since I turned him on, done what he was supposed to do.”  Tony watched as Dummy shoved stacks of boxes across the workshop floor into a corner, and then rolled towards the door.  “He’s not usually so…  Single minded.  And the team doesn’t usually work this hard to find him things to do.  So what the hell’s going on?”
DJ shook his head, very slowly.  “Not at all,” he said.  “But you’re never going to tell them that.”
“He says that like someone bleeding is unusual for movie night,” Sam said, picking up the teapot.  He filled a cup with a practiced gesture, the tea pooling neatly in the hollow of the cup.
“I have good, loyal men already on the payroll,” Obie pointed out.  “Men I already know, who you already know, there’s no reason-”
"I am not claiming him," Steve said, and everyone was laughing now, the photographers jockeying for positions, for angles.  Steve ducked his head, a faint smile creasing his cheeks, and they went nuts, shutters clicking so fast that it was just a wall of sound.
Tony's lips twitched.  "It's adequate."  She stuck her lower lip out in a pout, and he struggled to keep a straight face.  "You did a good job, Jan."
"I love you and I'm quite terrified that your heart will explode one day," Pepper told him.  She held up the page.  "What is this?"
“A quiet meal is a failed meal,” Thor said, his voice firm, and Tony hid his smile behind his wine glass.  “Besides.” Thor smiled at DJ.  “He is a most polite child.  Even though things must be very boring, when the adults talk above his head this way.”
Steve’s fingers flexed against his leg.  “I’m guessing he got to the gate, and found it already open.” He looked at the window.  “Fire’s still merrily burning, things are still in an uproar, he likely hasn’t been missed from his post.  But now he suspects that he’s being double crossed.  He’s lit the fire, and if he’s caught, it’ll be on him, because he doesn’t know who hired him, not really.
“Probably gone down the trash compactor, he's...  Not a fan of shoes,” Tony said, as if this was a normal conversation for him to be having.
With a pleased sound, DJ wrapped his hands around the cup, his fingers sliding back and forth over the chipped surface.  He sniffed cautiously at the tea, then took a careful sip.
The grand foyer of Radio City Music Hall was a cavernous space, built to awe and impress. Right now, every inch of the space was packed, and people were still pouring in, families in well-mended coats and carefully polished shoes, every one of them clinging tight to the StarkIndustries tickets that had gotten them past the staff manning the doors.
Steve shifted, and Tony did his best to drag his mind out of the gutter.  He was very, very glad of the pillow between Steve's head and his lap.  “Probably,” he said, and his voice sounded raw, even to him.  He cleared his throat.  “The guy with the money's never had much sense.”
“That you’d take care of me, no matter what,” Tony said.  “I know, Obie, I know, but I think the old man has to acknowledge that there’s only so many years you can spend at that job.”
“I do not believe him to be in any danger, or any pain,” Jarvis said.  “But we still do not know how far his control over his physical form extends.  I believe that if he is allowed to calm down, to relax, he will be able to put himself to rights.”  Jarvis paused.  Then, “Panic makes things harder.  For him, especially.”
Stark's smile stretched.  "I shall leave the nonsense to you.  I've got real world problems to solve."
“Going,” Tony said, and took off, Steve held securely in one arm.  “Hold on, we're going to have to do some catching up.”
Peter watched it flop over the arm of the chair.  "I'm...  Fairly confident," he said.  He looked at Tony, a bright smile on his face.  "It's a very good cat.  If.  You know." His eyes slid sideways.  "It's a cat."
His skin was warm under Steve’s fingertips, so soft and so familiar, and it hurt to touch him sometimes.  “I’m not going to apologize for that.  Not if it keeps you safe.  Not if it keeps all of you safe.”
“Right,” Tony said, because nothing had mattered back then, nothing had mattered other than his own pain and the ways he made it go away.  Or at least made it more bearable.  “Then it was the first, and last, time when you were left all alone, and I think, I think your human side doesn't want that.  Is afraid of that.”
“I was promised world saving,” Clint said, balancing an apple on his head.  “I was promised minimal jail time and maximum amounts of saving the world.  And now I’m just sitting in a kitchen in the small hours of the morning, wondering if we have enough bacon for breakfast and hoping that the boss’s latest squeeze isn’t going to go straight to police before I have a chance to cook it.”  He paused, the apple wobbling on his head.  “Which is pretty likely.  Because he is the police.”
His dinner went cold on his plate as he stared, unseeing, at the movie.  He wondered if Greer was as aware of Sam and Tony as he was, but she never seemed to even glance in their direction.  She seemed perfectly comfortable curled up against the arm of the sofa, her plate balanced on one knee.
Something like a laugh forced its way past the lump in his throat.  “No.  He doesn’t.”  Tony looked up, and Steve spread his arms wide.  “I can’t do anything.  I’m…”  His hands fell back to the side, the slack emptiness of his fingers somehow worse than any fist he could’ve made.  “I can’t do anything for him.”
“Surrender.  Or be destroyed,” the robot said, the monotone somehow more threatening than a more natural delivery.
Tony opened one eye, peering at it.  “Jay, take a message and make that stop,” he mumbled, pulling the sweatshirt he'd been using as a blanket up over his shoulders.  “Thanks.”  His head fell to the side, trying to find a comfortable place to rest in this damn seat.
Rogers' eyes rolled up towards the ceiling.  “It's Steve,” he said, cutting Tony off.  His head fell forward, then came back up, his eyes warm beneath the firm line of his brows.  He was smiling when he added, “The only ones who call me Rogers are commanding officers who think I'm going to obey them.”
Tony's eyebrows arched as he took a sip.  "Think of me as a poison tester."  He nodded at DJ.  "Want to make her another one?"
“Yeah, it's gonna suck, either way,” Bucky agreed.  He didn't sound particularly sympathetic.  He nudged his stool away from the counter.  “Can I get a to-go box for the rest of these?”
Steve nodded.  “I’ve had my fill,” he said.  Enough to last him a lifetime.  “Just…”  He gave her a lopsided smile.  “I need the tin back, when you’re done.”
“Yes, and don't TOUCH anything,” Ellen said.  She slid down off her stool and headed for the kitchen, her slippers slapping on the ground with each step.  “I've got everything exactly where I need it.”
“Thank you,” he mumbled, wiping away the last of the jam from his lips with a swipe of his thumb.  “What the hell would make Stark agree to that?”
Tony gave her a sideways look.  “Did you do something new with your hair?” he asked, eyeing the length of blue silk that had been tied in a massive, lopsided bow around her hair.  “I'm thinking you did something new with your hair.”
“Does it help you?” DJ asked.  Franklin shrugged, his head down, and DJ nodded.  Maybe that made sense.  Maybe he didn't need it to make sense.  Maybe he didn't know what did and didn't make sense anyway.
Ellen sucked in a breath.  "Oh, my god, you are so rich.  This is-" She held it up.  "This is the holy grail, this is-"
Ellen shifted her phone to her other shoulder.  “Of course I'm watching this,” she said, because there was no point in asking what 'this' was.  They both knew.  Ellen worried her pen cap between her teeth. “What else would I be watching?”
Tony leaned in, and cleared his throat.  “I’ve never been prouder to say that I know exactly where his mouth has been,” he said.  He grinned, wide and wicked and perfect.  “And where it’s going to be-”
"Eighteen, actually."  Tony made a vain attempt to fend him off, his hands fluttering in the air in Steve's general direction.  "Get off, I can do it."
"We won't have the flowers until the day of," Jan said, drawing his attention.  "Red dahlias and yellow roses, blue gladiolus and white lilies."  She grinned at him.  "Your colors."
"Hello there."  Tony put some distance between him and the lump of fur, and DJ ducked back down, a faint giggle echoing in his wake.  Tony smiled.  "Who let you in?"
DJ thought about that.  And decided he didn’t want to think about it.  “Me, too,” he said instead, and there was nothing here but bad choices.  But the third floor landing looked remarkably intact, and the main foyer-
Tony pushed at the blankets, trying to shove himself upright, and Bruce lunged across the room, making a grab for his shoulder.  Tony shook him off.  “Where-”
He skidded to a stop, the metal scraping across the tile floor, and lay there, gasping for breath.  The HUD was going nuts in front of his face, throwing up data and warnings faster than his spinning head could take them in.  The blare of the alarm inside the helmet mingled with the one outside the armor, and DJ managed to flop onto his back, halfway under a table.
Obie sighed, a stream of smoke curling from his pursed lips.  “I get the feeling,” he said, tapping the cigar against the rim of a nearby ashtray, the movement sharp and hard, “that I don’t have your full attention right now.”
“Good.  Let him get away with nothing.”  The old lady gave Steve a quick once-over, her dark eyes narrowed.  “I’ll give him his own portion,” she said to Tony, giving the contents of the kettle a stir.  “And in exchange, next time there’s a storm, you check with me first.” She stabbed a finger at him.  “First, you understand?”
“Get them to the streetcar before I’m stuck with them,” Tony said.  To the boys, he added, “Have we stuffed our pockets with all the candy we can carry?”  Laughter and a chorus of ‘yes’ answers made him smile.  “Good.  Now, be good for Officer Rogers.”
DJ considered that question.  “I am afraid of that small space,” he said at last, each word careful.  “It's...  Specific.”
But DJ had already emptied rest of the hot water from the kettle into the sink, splashing the plates into it with a great deal of enthusiasm.  Steve smiled at him.  “Try not to break anything,” he said, as DJ shoved a chair over to the battered basin and scrambled up to kneel on it.
“Yeah, me too.”  Steve took a step back, pretending to consider DJ, who was dressed in a simple white shirt and dark pants, one of his suspenders sliding down his left arm. "Do you think maybe we should find you some shoes?" he asked.
“Shock and awe tactics,” Tony said, before Gyrich could feed them whatever line of bullshit he had cooked up and ready to go.  “You decided to announce your existence in a big way.”  Out of the corner of his eye, he could still see the faces, pale and fearful, behind every window, each one tight with remembered trauma.  Tony's jaw locked.  “This is a threat.”
Ellen gritted her teeth, struggling against the need to say something that would probably get her fired.  On her computer screen, her boss chuckled into his coffee cup.  “Watching you try to be diplomatic is a hell of a thing,” he said, flipping through the stack of pages in front of him with an idle hand.  “You haven't had much practice, have you?”
Tony considered that.  And the fact that the thing was possibly chewing on the spine of one of his ledgers.  "I'm not going to lie," he said at last.  "I'm not sure that would be wise.  Or legal."
“It must be so nice for the two of you to have other children around to play with,” Natasha said, moving a pitcher of iced tea out of the way before the two of them could topple it.
Rhodey looked over the top of the book at him, one eyebrow arched.  “How old are you again?” he asked.
Tony looked up at Steve, a tight smile on his face.  “Might not come to anything, but it’ll keep both of us-” He gestured vaguely at the ceiling, towards one of Jarvis’ cameras.  “Busy.  And out of trouble.”
"I know, I know, I'm GOING," Ellen said, grabbing her bag from the back of the chair.  “And your bow tie is crooked.”
“I’m wearing my seat belt,” DJ said, which was something that could’ve gone unsaid, because there is no way Steve would’ve started the car if his seat belt wasn’t fastened.
Clea paused.  Held up a hand.  Snapped her fingers.  “Now it won’t!” she said, sounding very pleased with herself.  A book bounced off the ceiling, and she reached out to catch it.  “Now-”
“Well, Phil isn’t IN Vegas, so if he is, that’s-  That’s not going to go well,” Tony said.  “But since you’re her best friend on the team-”
How strange could a place be, how alien, how foreign could it be, after all, if Tony was there, his shoulder brushing against Steve's, smiling in that way he did when he was happy.  When nothing was perfect, but that was fine.
Tony considered him.  “Naked except for an apron?” he asked, and Steve made a pained, helpless little noise.  “Right.  Come pick one out.”
She looked at Steve.  “He had to be quiet.  No matter what.  No matter how bored he was.  No matter how frustrated, or angry.  I would teach him.  How to walk silently.  How to sit perfectly still.  How to not move, when there were people in the house, when they might hear him.  How to be unseen, unheard, how to…”
“Who invited you?” Stark asked him, as DJ happily handed over the shoes.  “In all seriousness, how did you-”
“Only me,” he agreed.  “Focus on me, and we'll get through this, you and I.”  His hand tightened on Steve's shoulder.  “We're in this together, after all.”
"I'm fine!" Tony said, throwing his hands in the air, stomping up the corridor.  "Great!  You're fine, he's fine, everyone's FUCKING FINE."
“Your old shield, it made with the finest steel that your people had access to.  It was made to protect a man, to protect a mission,” Shuri said.  She scooped up the shield and held it with one hand, the polished surface of the vibranium gleaming in the firelight.  “This?  This is a shield that can protect a nation.”  Her chin came up, her eyes sparking.  “Take it.  It is the shield of a king.”
O'Brien pushed himself to his feet, his hands braced on his desk, his broad shoulders squared, his head down like a bull ready to charge.  "No," he said, and it was quiet and firm.  "No.  You won't be talkin' to him.  No.  You won't be investigatin' this.  No.  You're gonna put that file right back where you found it, and you're going to walk yourself back out to your assigned beat, and you're not going to say a damn word about it."
“We don’t know,” Steve said, his heart in his throat, not wanting to hope, not daring to hope.  Natasha, still at the curb, straightened up.  Billy, who was sitting on the hood of the car, slid off.  “Billy, run and tell Happy we’re going to my place.”
The kitchen seemed like it was a long way away.  “Why are you on my couch?” Tony asked Rhodey, because bothering Rhodey was less effort and more fun that trying to make his knees work.
Tony had the distinct impression that time was not passing like it should.  “Can you put that away?”
They sat in neatly ordered rows, dozens of metal monsters, all polished to a mirror shine.  The majority of them were black, trimmed with gleaming silver chrome and riding high on white wall tires.  But a few, scattered here in there, were painted in sharp, brilliant splashes of color, green and yellow and rich, mellow gold.
“So you’ve done this before?” Darcy asked, taking the unicorn away from both of them.  Clint made a grab, and she ducked away, pressing a kiss to its fluffy muzzle.  “Gone to the gathering of pointy headed weirdos?”
“Right.  It’s yours,” Bucky said, turning towards the kitchen.  “I’ll go see if the well out back is still drawing.”  He stomped off, his shoulders hunched, his footsteps heavy on the stone floor.
So he pushed himself up, inch by agonizing inch, into a sitting position.  “Knock it off,” he called, his head falling into his hands.  “I'm coming.”
Tony leaned back into the shelter of Steve's chest, a hand braced on the edge of the workbench.  "He had a code, but you didn't let him in?"
“I wind it, and it runs down faster than it should,” Steve said.  He shifted, trying to find a place to stand where he wasn’t in the way.  The claustrophobic space pressed down on him, dozens upon dozens of clock faces staring down at him like unblinking eyes.  He crossed his arms over his chest, trying not to bump into any of the shelves when he did.  “Sometimes, it just stops.”
“I think so, and I hope so?” DJ said.  Fury’s head tipped to the side, and DJ managed a smile.  “Otherwise, he has to tell my parents what happened.”
Steve nodded, but there was a muscle jumping in his jaw now.  “And he signed the rights to these things away?”
It should've stung, but somehow it didn't.  Tony smiled at him.  “That's all right,” he said, and it was easy, it was so easy.  “All of my insubordinate help does, too.”
“Rhodes is a bad influence,” Tony said.  “Jess and Carol are determined to eat me out of house and home,  Clint’s burrowing through my stuff right now-”
“He doesn't see the genius of some of my better ideas, it's true,” Tony said.  He rubbed DJ's hair one more time, his hand lingering there.  “So maybe it's better if we don't tell him.”
“All right, so I wouldn’t have, but I would’ve thought very seriously of doing it, and I don’t think he ever did.  He just wanted to see what was on the inside of it, and then, once we got it open, he just wanted to know how it worked, and I-” Tony stopped.  Took another bite of his sandwich.  “Fine.  So he fixed a clock.”
“I’m going to Las Vegas,” DJ said, and calm descended for the first time since he’d walked into the Sanctorum today.  He smiled. “I’m going to the Cabal.”
DJ slipped behind Mrs. Parker, who covered her mouth with a hand to hide her smile.  “You don't have to have your picture taken if you don't want to, dear,” she said.  “But I'd love to have a picture of you to put up in my parlor.”
“Let us know when you get to the vow of silence,” Rhodey said, and Tony gave him a look.  Rhodey grinned at him, utterly unconcerned.  “It would make a nice change.”
“Right.”  Bruce adjusted his glasses, leaving a smudge of dirt on one lens.  He didn't seem to notice.  “I'll just-”  He gestured behind him.  “Right.”  Without finishing anything close to a sentence, he headed for what Steve assumed was the servant's stairs.
"Odds are even that Happy's just luring him into the nearest alley to mug him," Tony said. Steve nodded. "Really? No response to that?"
Steve choked on a laugh, and Tony gave him a look.  “Do not encourage her,” he said, swinging a leg over the railing.  He hopped down to the street and stepped aside so Steve could do the same.  He dusted his hands off on his legs.  “Acceptable?”
“Well, we live in one of the largest cities in the world, and everyone who lives here has a cell phone with a camera attached, so...  Yeah, there's a lot flying around social media, but most of it's junk.”  Ellen could hear her typing.  Jesse attacked her keyboard like it was trying to escape, every time she used it.  “There's one, here, I'll send it to you.”
"Relax," Tony said.  His eyes slid in Steve's direction.  "You look like you're about to face a firing squad."
It was true, though.  Steve could still pick out things that he remembered; the city may have changed, but not that much.  The castle was still there, high on the hill in the center of the city, the lines of it as elegant and beautiful as he remembered.  It loomed over everything, the turrets and walkways stretching up into the cloudless sky.
“I heard something like that,” Tony said.  He let his head fall onto Steve’s shoulder. His eyes fell shut.  “We’re going to make a spreadsheet.  Your fantasies.  All of them.  And we’re going to go down that list, one by one.”
“Of a sexual nature?” Sam filled in, and there was mockery or embarrassment to the words.  Steve was grateful for that.
“No,” everyone said, and Steve buried his head in his hands.  Tony reached out, patting him gently on the back.
“We cannot,” the blonde agreed.  “Like.  I appreciate your help here, but…”  He spread his hands, palms up. “We cannot even try.”
“If you can read between the lines, I’m an open book,” she said, leaning back against a workbench, her hands braced on either side of her narrow hips.  “And if you can’t, well, it’s not my job to teach you how.”
“Good try, but no.  Not now.”  Steve stood, and he ached, he ached down to his very bones.  “I’m going to go do a quick patrol around the walls.”  He reached out, brushing grass clippings away from DJ’s hair.  “I’m just going to make sure you’re safe.  Then I’ll be right back.”
He found Steve's shoes first, deserted on the floor of the living room.  One was tumbled against the wall, the other a dozen feet away, the laces trailing behind it.  The doors to the balcony was open, and Steve, dressed in a pair of running shorts and a white t-shirt, was outside, his arms spread wide and his face tipped up, letting the rain wash over his flushed skin.
“Christmas,” Tony agreed as DJ gave him the box.  “Oh, is this for me?  Excellent.  I approve of your color choices.  Very nice.  Still not distracting me from breakfast.  We’re going to have breakfast.”
“Cold comfort.”  Her chin came up.  “He didn’t want me involved, but by then, I was just old enough to be useful and still young enough to think I was invincible.  He’d trained me to be his lab assistant from the time I could hold a test tube still for him, but I wasn’t particularly interested in running a still, or taking shorthand, or packing boxes for him.  So,  I learned to drive, and I learned to drive well.  Not a job for a girl, but…”
“Hi!  He’s fine,” Carol said.  “Despite drinking his weight in vodka last night.  Meanwhile, Tony’s hungover-”
"Of course, Mr. Rhodes," Pepper said, accepting the tea from the boy.  "Do keep Officer Rogers out of trouble."
He broke into a run, legs chewing up the distance, taking the stairs two and three at a time.  In a matter of seconds, he was reaching out, catching Tony’s arm, and even that felt like an eternity.  “You shouldn’t be out here.”
A clatter brought his head up, and he watched the church key bounce across the workbench, Tony’s hand still hanging in midair.  There was a strange, strained look on his face, and Steve gave him an apologetic smile.  “Sorry,” he said, and his voice sounded raw.  “Dignified, huh?”
In the silence that followed his departure,” Carol folded her arms on the table, leaning into them.  “This place is the human equivalent of a swarm of locusts,” she said. “There are no leftovers, Jan.  You could have a delivery scheduled every ten minutes for five hour straight and it just means Thor and Luke Cage don’t have to spend all night going ‘anyone want this last one?’”
“Just like being back in grade school, huh?” Isaiah walked around the far side of the table, his cane thumping across the floor with each step.   He leaned over, considering the tabletop with a scowl.  “Missed a spot.”
Steve nodded, his face expressionless. “Of course.” The words were oddly flat. Lifeless. When he looked in Tony's direction, his eyes were dull. He smiled, anyway, and Tony hated it.
Steve looked back at his feet, not sure a conversation about jealousy was one he wanted to be part of, not when Tony was dancing with someone else.  Someone much, much better at it then Steve was.
Rhodey leaned out, a cup of coffee held in front of his face.  He arched an eyebrow.  “If I hadn’t picked up,” he said, hanging up the call with a flick of his thumb, “would you have jumped me on my way out of the building?”
It hurt, an ache that settled low in his chest, and his shoulders hunched.  “Relieved,” he said, and he it caught him off guard.  He looked up, surprise sweeping over him, and something like peace settling over him in its wake.  “Relieved,” he repeated.
Internally, Tony cursed himself.  “Right.”  He slid into the jacket, letting Jarvis set it in place on his shoulders.  “So.  Bread and butter.”
Steve smiled back.  “Going to share a chocolate malted and hope he gives you his Varsity sweater?” he asked.
“And I'm here to save you from this nightmare fuel,” Pepper said.  “An hour.  Two.  Tops.  I just need you to put in an appearance, Tony, it's good-”
“Yeah, on your viral video.  Not his viral video.” She wiggled her phone in his direction.  “Statement?”
Pepper stood, her hands braced on her desk.  “You are playing with fire right now, you know that, don’t you?  Between Rogers and now Washington-”
“We’re closed tomorrow, and there’s a cleaning crew coming in to do a deep scrub and it’s three goddamn am and you all need to go home and offer your most abject apologies to your loved ones for choosing a career that makes it all but certain that you will never, and I mean never, know what it’s like to celebrate an actual holiday with them.”  Tony reached for his water bottle.  “There are boxes for each of you in the cloak room.  They contain a wide variety of calorically dense treats covered in spun sugar or gold dust or essence of amor, I don’t even fucking know, take one even if you hate chocolate, because there’s also a wad of cash in there.”
The image flickered in and out, systems disturbed and bursts of energy whiting out the screen.  There was sound only sporadically, mostly the sound of stone and metal groaning and crashing to the ground.  The huge, open lobby of what had once been Stark Tower was in ruins, shards of glass and stone lying broken on every surface.  The huge fountain had been blown apart, water splattering out across the cracked marble floor.
Tony shoved a hand through his hair, trying to draw a deep breath.  His chest ached, but he could breathe freely.  “Fine,” he said, his hand dropping into his lap.  “I was-”  He shook his head.  “Never mind.”
“That kid is shameless,” Steve said.  He grabbed his coffee cup and headed towards the living room.  A few minutes later, he leaned through the doorway.  Clint was snoring softly, his arms thrown out on the back of the couch, his head tipped back at a painful looking angle.  Next to him, there was a huge pile of blankets, one familiar foot poking out of the tangle of fabric.  “Hey,” Steve said, his voice pitched low.  “Time to wake up, you two.”
“You drive a hard bargain,” Tony said.  “Take the box.  Leave me a cruller.”  Pleased with his deal, DJ snagged the box and bounced off towards the diagnostic station where Rhodey had left his armor.  Tony watched him go, and when he was out of earshot, gave Steve a look.  “You brought him down here to keep me from exploding.”
Maguire shifted his weight, his fingers gripping the brim of his cap  tight.  “I-” His face flushed, he tried to bluster forward.  “I was told to bring back your reply?”
Tony faced him, his chest tight.  He took a deep breath.  “Obie.  I am very thankful for everything you’ve done for the company, and me.  Because God knows, you were dedicated to Dad, and you’ve been dedicated to me.  To StarkMunitions, and even though you thought it was a mistake, you followed me right into StarkIndustries, with every bit of loyalty and enthusiasm that I could hope for.”
He glanced down at the glasses in his hand.  He should give them back.  It was stupid.  Maybe even manipulative.  Instead, he tucked them back in their case.  “Thanks.”
“Oh, like you'd be throwing yourself into that shark pit,” Tony said.  He rolled his shoulders, then his neck, flexing his fingers as he did.  “I want the suit.”
She was next to him now, and Tony lifted his head. “Want to know why I can't do this anymore?” he asked.
“And that’s likely because of this,” May said, slipping the cup from his fingers.  He made a pained noise and a futile grab for it, but she was already putting it back on the tray. “You may have a cup with your cake.  If you finish your dinner.”  She gestured at DJ, who was now studying the door panels, his fingers tracing along the carvings.  “You have a child to set an example for now.”
It was a smooth, simple piece, the light sliding over the surface.  No fuss.  Nothing obviously artistic about it.  But it was perfect, for all that.  Tony held out his hand, expecting Steve to hand it to him.  Instead, he cupped his hand around Tony's, sliding the ring smoothly onto his finger.
The burst of laughter caught him off-guard, slipping out before he could choke it back.  Stark grinned at him, his expression smug, and Steve wished he could figure him out, could make him make sense.  "Oh, are you a king now?" he asked, his voice wry.
Bucky tossed the knife in the air, catching it by the hilt.  “Is that supposed to stop me?” he asked.
O'Brien exhaled, a thin stream of blue-gray smoke curling through the air between them.  "I ain't saying that," he said at last, rubbing his forehead.  "He's saying that." He flicked a gesture at the file.  "And we got no reason to say he's lying."
“This isn’t even your dimension,” Clint said, nudging Darcy and Harris into a pew across the way.  Darcy was wearing Harris’ jacket, and Harris had one of her bouquets.
“Oh, of course, just DJ,” May said, cupping his face in her hands.  She kissed his forehead, and DJ leaned into the contact, his eyes fluttering shut.  “But if you’d like to go by Dover Julian, please just let me know.”
Steve froze, caught in the act of picking up an apple.  He looked up, but she didn’t seem to notice.
“You said that before.”  Darcy shifted on the couch, mumbling in her sleep, and Harris rubbed her shoulder, slow and soothing.  She let out a sigh, and went still again.  Harris looked up at DJ.  “Why do you think it’s your fault?”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Tony said, reaching up to give Steve’s shoulder the gentlest of shoves, pleased when Steve caught his wrists, stretching Tony’s arms up over his head, pinning them to the ground.  Tony arched up, pleasure humming through him as Steve leaned over him, his face flushed.
“Sam likes a train wreck as much as the next man, that’s why he’s on this team,” Greer said with a grin.  “If he had self-preservation skills, he would not be here.”
“Fine, fine, I’ve given up trying to guess it,” Clint said.  “This is for me and Phil, huh?”:  DJ nodded.  “Okay.  Want to help, Phil?”
Tony took a deep breath, and put his phone away.  “The jet’s being fueled up and checked now, by the time we get to the airport, it’ll be ready to go.”  He pointed at Clint.  “Guess who’s driving.”
The slight build and the clothing, a pair of skin-tight jeans, battered doc martins, and an oversized hoodie, marked the figure as a teenager, as did the backpack slung tight over one shoulder.  Their head was tipped forward, their hands shoved into the pockets of the sweatshirt, hidden in the folds of the fabric.
“Because Stark is an idiot, and he’s publicly an idiot, and I have a Google alert set up so I know about it before you,” Bucky said.  He sounded gleeful.  “Purely so I can start conversations like this.”
The words cut off suddenly, and Pepper looked over at the far side of the patio, where a large blanket had been spread over the stone, hundreds of marbles scattered over its surface.  There was an empty glass and plate next to the blanket, but no other sign of who'd put it all there.  She stood.  "Maybe he went down to the green house?"
“We used soap,” May said, coming up the hallway behind Steve, a folded stack of towels cradled in her arms.  She smiled at Tony, her eyes dancing.  “I am beginning to think he dislikes clothes.”
Dummy rolled past, a dry erase marker clamped firmly in his claw, and Tony watched him go, a faint smile on his face.  “Make that zero big and bold, buddy.  We want to be able to see it from space.”
“I think-” Tony started, as Steve handed him the plate.  “Maybe we should just focus on the toast right now, it's, it's a good piece of toast, and-”
Bobbi's eyes lit up.  “See, that's a different story.  Tree climbing is in my job description,” she said.  DJ went scrambling past her, and she snagged him by the back of the shirt.  “Here, Pete, I'll take the basket, and you can take this.”
One eyebrow arched.  “You have any idea how quickly the talk of rebellion stopped, once you were named a prince of the realm?”
“Oh!”  Steve reached into his pocket, pulling out his watch.  He looked down at it, and then back up at Tony.  “Half past twelve.”
Tony extracted himself from Steve’s arms with more speed than grace, his face hot.  “All right, you damn brat,” he said, but DJ was already halfway down the grand staircase.  Without thinking, Tony grabbed hold of the bannister and boosting himself onto it in one smooth hop.
Steve scowled at him, his face wary.  “Something funny?” he asked, and there was a tension in his voice that Tony didn’t quite understand.
"It's really hard.  You have to work at it.  Like, you have to get a really awkward angle," Jesse said.  "Right up his nose or something."
DJ's face fell, and Peter straightened up.  "I can help him take care of it," he said.  Tony gave him a look, and Peter didn't seem to notice.  "And he'll be good, he'll be useful, I mean, there's always going to be mice, and maybe with this, all we have to do-"
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, staring at nothing, before he heard the door to the private dining room open.  He straightened up, trying to force a smile onto his face.  "I'm sorry, I'm just going to-"
Tony smiled.  “I guess I did.”  He set a piece down, the base clicking against the board.  “Discover check.”
“We’re avoiding people,” Tony said, swirling the remains of his coffee in his cup.  “Where’s Darcy?”
“Well, if anyone knows about trying and failing to live an ordinary life in extraordinary times, it’d be Coulson,” Shawn pointed out as Harris reached the front of the line.  “Also, attracting trouble.”
"He's small and wily, it's true," Steve said, half coaxing and half lifting Tony into the seat.  "Sit here until I get things secured."
If he was lucky, he'd be there when Sue brought in a sample of the day's bread for Tony to approve.  Tony's would always be plain, so he could judge the texture and taste and look of it.  But the slices that Sue slipped to Steve were slathered with fresh herb butter, or topped with pickled vegetables, crunchy and sweet beneath the biting tang of the vinegar and salt.  When it was cold and icy out, the streets of New York gray in the early mornings, she would give him lemon curd, so perfect that even the smell of it was enough to make him remember summer evenings and sunshine.
“I’d appreciate it if you wouldn’t.”  Tony headed up the stairs.  “I love you.  You know that, right?”
The song they dance to, just in case anyone wants to know what I listened to ON REPEAT for like an hour while writing the final scenes is "The Night We Met," By Lord Huron.
“No, what I said was that you're not comfortable with dealing with things like this,” Sam pointed out.  “Hating it and being able to do it despite hating it are two different things.”
“‘S okay,” she whispered back.  “Harris has a lot of good qualities, but his shoulders are hella bony.”  She smiled down at DJ.  “He’s a polite kid, and he’s had a tough couple of days.”
Steve shook his head.  "No, it's just..."  It hurt.  The thought of it hurt.  He managed a smile, though.  "You're still friends with Pepper, even though the two of you broke up.  We can still be friends." Tony was silent, and Steve fought against an unreasoning spike of panic.  "Right?"
He was still in the coffee shop in the lobby when Pepper strode through the front door.  He drained the last of his espresso, sticking another twenty in the tip jar on his way to throw out the cup.  The barista behind the register stopped wiping down the counter long enough to give him a nod and a smile.  “Thanks, Mr. Stark,” she said, and he gave her an idle wave.
“Excuse me, sir,” Steve said, and that was the best Captain America voice, the deeply disapproving but still passably respectful.  “You're telling me that you sent a fifteen foot tall robot into the center of the city with no warning to the citizens?  To what purpose, sir?”
“Remember when you went to pick up the pizzas for board game night and ended up foiling an armed robbery?” Darcy pointed out.
In the warm light of morning, he found the expansive main room of the suite was large enough to host a party or meeting, with huge windows that looked out over the strip.  There were small, intimate clusters of seating and large, expansive couches clustered around low, glass topped coffee tables.  There was a grand piano, topped with a beautiful arrangement of roses and lilies.  There was a bar, its shelves filled with gleaming rows of bottles and glassware and fronted by a row of gleaming stools.
“So this?” Rogers waved a hand at the room.  “This is as foreign to him as if he'd ended up in China.”  His hand fell back to his side.  “He must've been....  Scared.”
Tony poured himself a cup of coffee.  “I’m fine,” he said, but he raised his arm so Steve could see for himself.  “Hurts like hell, if I’m being honest, and I’m sure it’s turning six shades of purple today, but Bruce knows not to trust me with weak sutures.”
Peter nodded, and he was still crying, but it was slower now, without the hard, labored breaths under it. “Yes, ma’am.”  He glanced at Tony.  “I should’ve gotten to him sooner, Mr. Stark.”
“Right,” Tony said, drawing the word out.  “You know where he is. You just can’t get him back from there.”  Stephen opened his mouth, and Tony’s whole body jerked forward, pulling hard against Steve’s hand.  “So I’m not seeing much of an improvement there, what I’m seeing is that you LOST my KID.”
“I wanted to send a video, but the throwback here seems to think that he’ll find the printed word more comforting,” Tony said, and he wasn’t sure if Steve was right about that or not.  But it had saved him from the humiliation of struggling to find something to say to the unblinking eye of a camera.  Steve had volunteered, and he’d let him, because he was at the end of his rope.
“It's not a good idea to ask a guy in spandex about sex stuff,” Peter said.  “If they try, I tell them facts about spiders and that confuses them and also makes them think maybe I have a weird kink that they don't want to know anything more about.”
“Truth is subjective,” Natasha said, her arms crossed over her chest.  Carol glanced at her, and she gave a slight, one shouldered shrug.
“Clean up and get upstairs to set the table,” Tony said, ambling towards the door, “and I'll see if we've got anything in the freezer.”  He glanced back.  “Thirty minutes, various disasters.”
There was a boy standing on the windowsill, clinging to the building three stories above the street below.
“Ah!” Jarvis stepped back, waving Steve through the door.  “Good day, Officer Rogers.  To what do we owe the pleasure?”
“It wasn’t meeeeee,” Clint sing-songed.  He handed DJ a nametag, and DJ carefully peeled the adhesive free.  It said ‘Lost Boy.’  “Sounds like me, though, kid, sorry.”
The photographer who'd shouted the question now found himself somehow alone in the middle of the press corral.  Despite the fact that there was no where to go, and no extra space, somehow, everyone had found a way to edge away from him, leaving him very exposed and very obvious.  He blustered on anyway.  "Well, some people do worry that, what with his history-"
DJ's eyes slid shut, and Tony smoothed the tears from his cheek with a swipe of his thumb.  “Do you believe me?” he asked.  “It's okay if you don't.  It just means I have to keep telling you.  Keep reminding you.  Until you do believe me.”
“Cap, you have to be used to that by now,” Tony said, grinning behind the shelter of his helmet.  “Everyone talks bad about me, and not saying that this guy doesn't deserve to be in traction, but maybe I'm not the reason to put him there.”
Someone laughed, and Tony was going to have that person thrown to the wolves, or maybe he’d just skip the middleman and do it himself.  “What happened?  Where-”  He sucked in a breath and immediately regretted it.  “Where am I?”
It felt like a lie in his mouth, it felt heavy and wrong on his tongue, it tasted of metal and blood, but Peter nodded.  Because Peter still trusted him.
Happy grinned. “Never going to turn down a drink,” he said cheerfully. “Especially if you're paying, boss.”
"Go polish your shoes and make sure you look presentable, and, remember, keep.  Your mouth.  Shut." O'Brien went back to his paperwork.  "As much as you're capable of, at least."
Logan let out a snort.  “Six months?  You're not getting' off that light.  You'll be hearing about this for the next six years.”  He held out a hand.  “Name's Logan, kid.”
If Miss Potts heard the unctuous note in Murray's voice, she didn't acknowledge it.  Instead, she smiled up at Steve, her big blue eyes surrounded by long dark lashes.  "Hello, Officer Rogers," she said, extending one white gloved hand.  "So pleased to meet you."  She sounded almost sincere.
“Ah.  Furbro.”  Natasha straightened up, not seeming to mind as the cat wound its way around her ankles.  “I shall notify the chef that we have another mouth to feed.”
“We agreed,” Tony said, his voice breezy, “that what’s good for the copper’s good for the tycoon.  You left it out, I get to satisfy my…”  His smile stretched into a wicked grin, and Steve lost his breath.  “Curiosity.”
"Yes."  Ed grinned at him, one arm braced on the side of the machine.  "I thought you could use the extra kiss up points."
Tony’s head fell forward.  “I’m fine,” he said, and Natasha snorted.  Despite himself, he smiled.  “Yeah, well, fuck you, too.”
Steve paused by the wall, checking a gate with a quick tug.  The lock held.  “I’m guessing an arrest.”
She shrugged.  “You married Tony, and my first act was not to give you a shovel talk or try to buy you off,” she said.  “So.  Yes.”
“It was a gift.  I didn’t ask where they got the design,” Steve said.  He squinted up at the awning.  “That doesn’t look much like a clock.”
“I’m not the only one,” Steve said, and he leaned forward, and Tony met him halfway.  The kiss was soft and sharp, familiar and frightening, all at once.  When they broke apart, Steve hovered close, savoring the smell of Tony’s skin and the heat of his breath.  “We done with this fight?”
“I suspect you’re right.”  Mrs. Parker gave him a look.  “So word below stairs is that you’ve been asking how the staff came to be here,” she said, holding her hand out for an apple.
Natasha leaned back, her hands braced on the pommel horse.  “Just do exactly as you're told and you'll both be fine.”
“I love how you think that Tony is in charge of anything here,” Bobbi said, tapping him on the tip of his nose with the spoon.
“Yes, and we’ve had all, what, six people try?” Hank asked.  “Not exactly a-” The sound of breaking glass echoed down from the shop, and his head snapped up.  “REILLY!”
“And yet you keep expecting him to do engineering work for you,” Steve said.  “And also clean up the workshop.”
He ducked around them, climbing the ramp into the back of the quinjet.  The heat hit as soon as he cleared the door, and he pulled his cowl back.  “Tony?”
“Because our clients are idiots, and I wanted to sleep, not get pulled into your stupid,” Carol said.
“New York Now,” Tony finished with her.  He pointed the water bottle at her.  “Right.  Right.  You’ve got my number.”
Clint rolled to his feet, folding the newspaper with a theatrical flick of his hand.  “Who’s got first watch?”
“That explains so much.”  Pepper sidestepped a workbench, and Tony's hands closed on her waist, lifting her up and over a spare piece of equipment before setting her feet back on the workshop floor.  “I thought you just followed the music.”
Pepper propped her hands on her hips.  “What have we said about not giving Miss Van Dyne carte blanche?”
“I’m so close to breaking up with you right now, you have no idea,” Steve told him, and it was so obviously a lie that Tony just grinned up at him, brilliant and beautiful.  Steve scowled back.  “Don’t push it.”
“I’m a walrus,” Clint said.  She just stared at him, and he flapped his hands like flippers.  “Walrus.”
Tony leaned back against the wall.  “Jarvis sent you the schematics, didn't he?  And the video?  So what else can I tell you about-”
Things passed in front of his vision, and he wasn't sure what were memories and what was happening now, and he kept himself steady, kept himself still, because if he started screaming at ghosts, then he was insane and if he forgot where he was that was worse.  Flickers of things, in the corner of his eyes, flashes of people, sounds that shouldn't have been there.
Tony smiled.  “Thanks, Jay.”  He jogged down the rest of the stairs, taking a slow, deep breath.  He had no idea what he was doing, and yet, it seemed like he was going to do it anyway.  Luckily, he was used to making things up as he went.
“I'm working on not flinching every time anyone says it, including me,” Tony said.  He pressed both hands to his face.  “Steve's taking this as a challenge.  He's...  He's going to really do this thing.  Every time we're in public.  He's going to be my husband.”
“That seems both excessive and also difficult,” Pepper said, a hand covering her mouth.  Everyone looked at her, and she shrugged.  “I mean, how complicated was he-”
“Oh, wonderful,” Iron Man said, his voice twisted by the armor’s speakers.  “The annoying voice in the back of my head gets a physical form.”  He shook his head.  “Not that it’s any of your business, Jiminy Cricket, but it’s an emergency release.  One he’s not supposed to use.”
Steve realized that he was smiling.  And it felt good.  It felt right.  "You snuck in through the kitchen."
She turned to Steve.  "He's cast iron.  Solid to the core.  But the only reason they can't break him is because he's had the right seasoning."  She patted Steve on the shoulder.  "Go through the fire enough times, and they can't burn you any more."  Her fingers slid free from his arm as she started forward.  "No matter how much they try."
"This should be an easy enough assignment," she said, as he pushed the door open for her.  Her head dipped in a slight nod of thanks, and then she was moving down the broad stone stairs in front of the station.
“Yes, because he’s going to be eating his weight in candy at the theater,” Tony mumbled under his breath.  May gave him a look, and Tony tucked his hands in his pockets, rocking forward and backward on his heels.  “Am I wrong?”
“You’re both insufferably cruel,” she said, tossing her hair over her shoulder with a flick of her hand.  “Come on then, Steve, I’ll make a dancer of you yet.”
Tony pulled away, just long enough to suck in a breath, and Steve buried his face in Tony’s throat.  Tony sucked in a long, slow breath, and felt Steve do the same, unconsciously mirroring his breathing.  Tony smiled.  “Steve?”  Steve hummed against his neck.  “Where are your hands?”
Returning to the prep station, he set it down, pulling the lid off.  Thank God he’d prepped.  Because right now, he wasn’t capable of doing much more than combining a few already prepared ingredients.  He collected a plate from the stack at his station, the perfect, gleaming white canvas, and reached for the bottle of puree.
“No.” DJ's voice was soft, but there was a hint of a giggle to the single word, and Tony smiled at him.
“Right.”  Steve paused for a second, pouring himself a cup of coffee.  “I'll see if I can drag him out of bed.”
"That seems like the right thing to do," Steve said.  He was good at doing the right thing.  He was also good at really hating having to do the right thing.
“I'm going to go join her,” Tony said, and Steve's hands were on his waist, pulling him in until his back was braced against Steve's front.
