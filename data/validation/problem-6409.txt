"Don't flatter yourself too much. I'm just happy you're feeding me." Steve tried to act cool, but who was he kidding. He'd missed having a friend, having company, missed casual touches and easy conversation. He was ecstatic to see Tony.
He threw his phone in his bag, grabbed the lotion bottle from the bathroom, and pulled his boxers down just enough to let his dick spring free.
“So, in this universe, the photons from the sun that day hit your eye in a bad way. The ones in my universe hit your eyes in a good way.” He paused. “Well, um, good for me, anyways. And that changed the course of our histories.”
Steve chuckled as he put his phone away. He saluted the soldiers at the gate and made his way back to his hotel. Tomorrow would be a fresh start.
He looked up and Tony was staring right back, eyes half lidded, pupils big and dark, one hand still in Steve's hair, the other reached down and caressed his cheek. Steve leaned into the touch, and felt such a strong connection, loyalty, a bond like he'd never felt before. They didn't move, both unable to look away. Tony was the one who broke the silence.
"Are you sure? You don't need to just for me. What if someone recognizes you? You wouldn't be mad if someone took a picture of you dancing with a
“Great. I’ll be right here to greet him.” Steve smiled as he fixed his hair and sat up just a little straighter. It was disgustingly sweet how excited he was to see the Other-Tony come home.
"God, I could watch you like this all day, seeing you lose control of yourself." Tony said in a deep, comforting voice as he let his slick fingers trace around Steve's warm opening, letting him adjust to the sensations near his virgin hole as he peppered tiny kisses under his ear. Steve knew he must look so obscene, so vulgar right now, spreading his legs for his lover, probably squirming under his touch, but he didn't care. He wanted Tony all around him, inside him, could lose his mind at the very thought of it.
It turned out that Tony really hadn't been giving Steve enough credit. It didn't occur to him before that Steve was more than just handsome, strong and a skilled tactician. He was actually really smart too, and a quick learner. Tony was walking him through his Starkphone, and Steve was diligently keeping up and asking all the right questions. It was no wonder he'd become tired of SHIELD's orientations so quickly.
“No! I want to. It’s just, well, uh..” Steve blushed, hard. Tony, thankfully, didn’t make a joke about it, or push him to explain like Steve expected him to. Instead, he cupped Steve’s face with one hand and raised his hips up.
“I’ll knock you off your feet, Rogers.” Tony promised. Steve walked back inside, leaving Tony to watch the skyline below. He kicked his feet out over the edge, swinging them back and forth gleefully. He hadn’t felt this exhilarated in years. He stayed out on the roof a little longer, thinking of all the places he could take Steve. Would he like a nice, quiet restaurant? Or maybe a baseball game, he’d have to check the schedule for tomorrow. They used to talk about taking Steve out dancing someday - maybe he could find a ballroom somewhere that operated on a Monday night. Hell, he had enough money to
"Yes. How did you-" Steve was shaken. How could he know all that? Steve remembered it all like it was yesterday. Thanks to his eidetic memory, but also because it was one of the best nights of his life, sharing all those things with Tony. From then on, the observatory roof became
Back to the man who would bring out the best in him, because now he wasn’t just a good man for the sake of justice, or honor. He was a good man now, for Tony’s sake. For the sake of their relationship, for the team they would lead together, for the happy years they would spend with each other. For the child they might one day raise together after retirement. For the sick days comforting one another, and long nights spent arguing because Steve would never let himself lie to Tony, ever again. For the mornings making love, making up for silly disagreements. For the way Tony would never hide his feelings from Steve anymore, would become an open book for him, so sweet and affectionate and all his.
"Guess we could always sleep in the guest room next door. Rhodey doesn't mind us using his bed right?" Steve gave Tony a playful look as he finished cleaning him off.
a mirror universe. Everything is backwards to me. Your apartment layout, you, the words on this phone, left and right, East and West, everything. Obviously not an exact mirror, since we aren’t married in this dimension. But all the math is adding up so far, so I need to run some tests in the lab to see where the difference is.”
Tony thought, as he hugged Steve back. He had been trying to come to terms with this whole 'just friends' rule he'd set for himself, when Steve went and did something like this. He was promising Tony he'd be safe.
"Yeah." Steve blushed. "You remind me of a tornado sometimes, flying in and out of places, leaving everything in chaos behind you."
dicks and some nice tits?” Tony teased. “I’m sure I could get the machine up and running again.” Steve looked down at him and scowled in annoyance. Tony just smiled in return, then sucked him down in one go for good measure. Steve threw his head back and groaned. In the back of his mind, he was glad for this banter, though. It meant Tony wasn’t insecure about the whole thing after all. The fact that he was joking around like this meant he was having fun, and Steve loved that Tony was having fun with him.
Clint jumped up from where he'd been guarding their pile of clothes. He looked over Nat's shoulder to inspect the message. "Nope!" He grinned, "He
"Okay." He so eloquently answered. Thankfully, the server brought out some chocolate covered grapes just then, so Steve popped a few in his mouth. Surprisingly, the sweet treat was excellent following the caviar, playing on the contrasting flavors. Steve wondered if Tony had been here before, and made a mental note to bring him sometime. He would love this.
"Then he said he would miss me, I said I'd miss him too. His hand was still in my hair. He was like, holding the back of my neck..." Tony reached back and touched the same spot with one hand, remembering the sensation. "And it just felt right, so I closed my eyes and leaned in, but next thing I know we're hugging and then, that's that. He pulled away and then I just left."
"Yep. Good." He shot her a glare, but she innocently smiled back. He didn't elaborate, he hadn't been able to really talk to Tony yet, and so he didn't want to assume anything about where they stood.
Tony made a mental note to find out how much it would cost to buy the entire 2012 Jimmy Choo collection for Pepper. Of course she would upend an entire construction project for half a day just to give Tony some time with Steve. He felt a little guilty, but knew that Pepper wouldn't let the crew go home without a luxurious and well deserved dinner first.
"Oh, hey Bruce. Good morning." Steve was a little disappointed that he wouldn't get alone time with Tony this morning, but he knew Tony wasn't a morning person, and he certainly wouldn't take that out on friendly Bruce. "Sure, I'm making some pancakes today. Could you maybe clean up the berries for me if you don't mind?"
"In case!" Tony shot her a look. "In case...well what if he needs to find me and I'm down there? You know I'm down there all the time, Pep."
“But you need to get cleaned up too!” Tony insisted. “Let’s just take a shower. The tub isn’t big enough for the two of us.” Steve blushed at how easily Tony accepted their new routine.
“Stark.” She replied, an icy tone replacing her cheerful demeanor from just a second ago. It gave Steve whiplash.
Steve was about to say something back, but she looked away and exaggerated grabby hands towards the steaming mug Tony had brought her.
He was mortified, but somehow found the fortitude to sit through breakfast. Thankfully, Thor and Bruce joined them soon after, and conversation was light, so Steve didn't need much brain power to function. As soon as he was done eating, he decided he better retreat back to his apartment, to reset and focus up. He tried to sneak away when Clint arrived, late of course, and complaining that all the bacon was gone. But right before he made it to the elevators, he heard someone running after him.
By the time he made it back downstairs, everyone in the tower was already sitting around the TV, snacking on pizza and waiting for him.
“Not at all.” Tony took his hand and squeezed it. “I’m sure your Tony realized by now that our universes are different and left me a copy of his notes. Plus, I didn’t bring any equipment with me. Oh, speaking of which, here’s your phone.” Tony was starting to hand the phone back when he thought better of it. “Actually-” He turned on the camera and wrapped an arm around Steve’s neck, giving him a big smooch on the cheek and snapping a quick photo of the two of them. He handed the phone back. “There. Something to remember me by. So you don’t forget that someone out there loves you.” Steve took back the phone and stared at the picture, the loud whir of the portal powering up was drowned out by the roar in his ears as he tried to hold back his tears.
"Yeah." Steve was overwhelmed. He looked around, suddenly nostalgic. Even though it was another stadium, baseball was the same everywhere. He could smell the freshly cut grass, could imagine the fanbase cheering on their team. He saw a couple, decked out in Dodgers gear, taking photos next to statues of players outside the stadium. A young boy ran up to his dad with a baseball from the souvenir store, screaming with glee. Steve looked around, there weren't many people around for a Saturday. "Is there a game today?"
Steve smiled and packed up his things. He'd met a few guys earlier that day at a nearby port and was meeting them for dinner before they promised to take him to the best jazz club in town, and he was looking forward to it.
"They're happy to come along. And Fury already approved their time. Plus, he's dedicating a group of SHIELD agents to send with us. I already told you, it's taken care of."
“Calm down, Tony. Don’t you remember Ulton? Jarvis is...he’s gone, Tony.” Tony shoved his repulsor back into his face, and Steve held his hands up in response, showing that he meant no harm.
They did not greet him with open arms when they returned. He hadn’t expected it. Not really. But it would’ve been nice to talk about it, at least.  After all, he
weigh about a hundred pounds. “I’ve got it. Let’s go.” He smiled at him. The gorgeous Steve-Rogers smile that was usually only reserved for nice people who deserved it. Maybe this universe was one where Tony won the good-luck lotto.
After realizing he wasn't going to get anywhere with his packing today, he decided to go for a walk. His walk eventually turned into a jog, which turned into punching bag after punching bag in the gym.
"I like the cute outfits you used to make for us, and keeping you company at those parties was such a delight. I can't wait for everyone to see us together."
“You horndog.” Steve chuckled and pulled his face up, giving him a long, forgiving kiss. “It’s okay baby, I accidentally kissed the other-you here. Probably would’ve done the same thing if he hadn’t stopped me, you know I can’t go a whole day without you.” He squeezed Tony’s ass, making the smaller man giggle. “Good to know I like you in that universe too. Other-you sure likes Steve.”
"Anybody can be good. Maybe they need a push in the right direction." Steve pleaded, "Let me try? Didn't you say they have a meeting tomorrow? I can go and try to reason with them."
Tony looked up too. "That's Jackie Robinson." They both stared at the intricately framed photo. "He was the first African American man to play in the MLB when he joined the
"Baby, what i want you to know is, that I'm in this for the long haul, if you feel the same way, that is. I mean, if you're okay with that..." He gripped Tony's hands a little tighter, hoping he wasn't making a fool of himself, so head over heels already.
"Thor is excited to come back to help. He knows he would be great for carrying the heavy equipment. Bruce says he's fine with the flight, he has things he wanted to pick up from India anyways. He wants to do...science stuff that I didn't really understand, but he said it will be fun."
"It's okay. I don't know about you but I really enjoyed that." Tony yawned when Steve laid him down on the big couch.
think I was his husband, I guess they use my room sometimes when the penthouse is being renovated. He just crawled into my lap and said he’d missed me, and I said I’d missed him too. I thought...I thought it was
Steve pulled out his phone, about to send her a text when he saw the time on his screen. Almost 1 AM. He put his phone on his nightstand instead, but asked Jarvis to let him know the moment Nat woke up tomorrow. He would need as much advice as he could get with this.
“Sorry.” Tony blushed. “I...I guess he thought I was his husband too. I should’ve told you. I’m sorry. You have every right to be upset.” He apologized again. "I know I've been giving you hell about not telling me things, and it's hypocritical of me to not tell you sooner-"
"So what brings you down here?" Tony asked, still typing, not looking away from his screen. "Sorry, didn't mean to monopolize your afternoon."
Steve shrugged. "Guess it was raining too much for them to keep going." They both looked out the window. Sure, it was raining, but it wasn't exactly a storm or anything. "Foreman said the rest of the day was shot, and to come back tomorrow."
just saved all their asses. But seeing that smile, Tony's heart started to slow down, and his tense muscles relaxed - he knew that he needed to keep living, if only to see it again.
Tony's hands slowly came out of his pockets and hovered over Steve's waist for a moment, before reluctantly landing instead on his shoulder blades with a light pat.
“Fuck, Tony.” Steve was going crazy. The way Tony looked right at him as he fucked himself open on his fingers, he was really going to go insane. And they way the other man kept using those fond nicknames, the way he moved so perfectly, like he knew every inch of Steve's body, and made him feel so cared for. He didn’t know what he did today, what he’d done in the last month, or ever in his life, to deserve this, but he realized with a start that he needed to at least
“Hey, uh...I like you...too?” He told his shampoo bottle. Ugh, no. That sounded stupid. “Look, Rogers. I know I've been a dick since you got back, but...that was my mistake. We used to be friends. Can we go back to that?” His echoing voice sounded desperate and broken against the tile walls. No - that wasn’t right either.
"I don't think that's how exposure therapy works." Rhodey sat up and and snapped his fingers in the air a few times, making sure Tony turned to look at him. "Why are you putting yourself through this? You know you're not going to get over him. You've been obsessed with the guy your whole life. You didn't exactly hide your Captain America comic book collection very well in our dorm room."
"No, I mean in general, Steve." Tony waved a hand to signify the totality of their relationship, hoping Steve would understand without him having to put it into words. "I know I can be too much. And if I've made you uncomfortable in any way, I'm genuinely sorry. I can keep my distance, you know. I won't be offended if that's what you want."
"Captain Rogers?" Thankfully, Steve was starting to get more used to Jarvis, who spoke without warning quite often.
Tony shot up at that. He had small tears in his eyes, but they were completely forgotten as he nodded furiously. Steve chuckled and pulled Tony back down, guiding his head to rest on his shoulder.
"Of course it's for you, daredevil." Tony rubbed his eyes and squinted at the bright sunlight. "You know anyone else around here who likes to ride their bike at a hundred miles an hour with absolutely no protection?"
"Oh." Steve thought that working on a bike wouldn't warrant privacy, but it was Tony's home after all, so he had a right to privacy anytime he wanted. Or maybe Tony was still upset with him. "Whenever it's next convenient, could you please let him know that I'd like to see him?"
"What??" Tony jerked up and put his phone down, closing out Jarvis' dictation. "No!" He whined, "He's just new! You know that. What if
“None, Captain.” Tony tried to sound serious, but he couldn’t wipe the wide smile off his face. “But you still have to let me take you on a dinner date tonight.”
"No." Steve was more sure of himself than ever, even if he didn't know how to dance, or how to flirt, or how to keep himself sane around this man. He was sure he wanted to be here, lost at sea, as long as he was with Tony. "Let's stay."
This was his chance, the moment felt right, and natural, exactly like he wanted. It must've been the adrenaline from all the dancing, or the glow after being so close to Tony all night, but he felt so connected with the man, like everything tonight was intimate and theirs alone. It was now or never.
Steve was stunned. Tony never got up early enough to make breakfast, or if he did, he would just grab a coffee and head into the office. Right now, though, the man was in half a suit again, dress shirt untucked and unbuttoned, under a frilly baby blue apron Steve had never even seen before. The same color as his slippers. Willing that line of thought away, he sat down and finally responded.
That was it. He didn't have any footage of any freak-out Steve surely must've had. But it was apparent that he called Pepper soon after. Maybe it wasn't so bad, then? Who was he kidding. Steve couldn't get out of there fast enough. He was obviously not interested. In fact, if anything, this proved how straight Steve was. Tony thought back to his conversation with Rhodey. Rhodey. Tony and him had fallen asleep next to each other after raging college parties plenty of times, and if they ever got too close, Rhodes would just push him off and go right back to sleep. Maybe Steve didn't like the touch?
"Well have a good night!" Steve settled back and put his arms on either side of him, behind the couch. Tony could practically feel the heat radiating next to him, it seemed closer than usual. He wished one of those strong arms would slide up and over him. Wondered how good all that muscle would feel around his shoulders. He could smell Steve's body wash, it was warm and inviting. He must have zoned out, because next thing he knew, Natasha's face was right in front of his.
"Guess you're right." Steve walked over to a nightstand, picking up a phone identical to the one Tony was always tapping away at. "So this is the telephone you were telling me about?"
"You know, Thor left for Asgard last night. He said he would be back by the end of August though, I'm hoping I can convince him to help me with a few more experiments before we leave for Tajikistan." Bruce made light conversation as they worked.
The next time he drifted back, he was hugging his pillow. Feeling just as nice as before, but able to form thoughts now, being a little more awake. He didn't want to get up just yet, so he nuzzled his nose into his fuzzy pillow, trying to shield his eyes from the sun. Hmm....were pillows supposed to be fuzzy? He didn't know, but it was radiating warmth so he didn't really mind. Then the pillow cuddled back into his neck, and let out a little sigh. Huh. Pillows didn't usually do that. The pillow started to snore, little puffs of air tickling the skin under his ear. Okay, wait.
He caught himself. It's not the first time he realized he'd been thinking about Tony again. Why was Tony stuck in his head? He shook it off, maybe it's just because he's the only person he's been consistently texting with during this whole trip. It's no big deal. He'd see him tomorrow, have a good time, then continue his travels. No big deal at all.
Well, Steve didn't know where to go from here. He didn't want to make any other move, Tony wasn't drunk, but he'd had a few drinks earlier, so it wouldn't be right to say anything else tonight. Instead, he mustered up what little courage he had left to move closer.
"Is that okay?" Steve looked at Tony, and wasn't sure what exactly he was asking. But Tony was giving him a look like their entire friendship hinged on his response, and Steve knew he wouldn't want Tony any other way.
been affronted by the boldness. But fuck, did he want this. Steve groaned, pulling Tony closer, kissing back with a burst of passion. He gripped Tony’s side - it felt perfect in his big hand. The other hand, he couldn’t help it, slid down to Tony’s plump, firm ass and gave it a squeeze. Tony chuckled and pulled back.
people in need. Regardless of their nationality, regardless of the cost." He began, starting to pace around the room. He wouldn't even need his notes for this. "It's a shame. Things seem to have changed. You people have the ability to help an entire nation. Without even lifting a finger yourselves. And you're against it, actively
"No. Not necessarily. It's something that you can work towards improving." Tony paused. "Hey, you know, I'm in LA this weekend, I have to meet with some board members in our West coast offices. Pitch them something. Anyways, you're not that far from Cali. How about you meet me there?"
"I apologize for the intrusion, but Miss Potts would like to remind you that the vote takes place tomorrow at 7 AM sharp."
Tony's breath hitched and his eyebrows shot up, but he didn't move, or make a sound. The elevator ride up was long and slow, it seemed to go on forever. Finally it came to a stop and the doors opened on Steve's floor. He didn't know what to make of Tony's silence, but the man hadn't pulled away either. He may not have even taken a breath the whole ride up.
"Ow." He said to himself, rubbing his nose. This interrupted his rut, and when he opened the new message from Tony, he couldn't help but smile wide.
And for some reason, that’s when it hit him - the formulas Other-Tony had left him - they were the path-integral formulation. Proof that quantum mechanics is probabilistic - in other words, the only reason he and Steve weren’t together, weren’t married in this universe, was purely due to luck. He
"What?" Steve's eyes went wide. Had he? "No...I don't think it's come up. But I thought...I thought it was obvious? I mean,
“Yeah, so you’ve insisted.” She raised an eyebrow, and he shrugged. “Yet, he never blamed you for Ultron again after that night.”
“Come on, the general contractor asked me this morning if we wanted pink or purple wallpaper for the nursery.” Steve took his hand, guiding him back to the elevators.
It was mid afternoon, while he was sketching the buildings in the French Quarter, that he finally heard back from Tony.
"Put those on, don't look at the light and hold her steady." Tony pulled on what looked to be sunglasses and started to melt the wires with the fancy pen as Steve held the suit's leg in place.
"Tony - it's the only spot in the building where we can safely extract you, and at the same time take down the syndicate before they're able to reach for their weapons. We've got everyone in position. Besides, you dance all the time." Nat explained through his earpiece.
"Steve! Where the hell were you? You missed a crazy game, Ramirez practically handed your guys the big win in the 12th inning! It was amazi- wait who is that behind you?" Clint and Natasha walked in, and the archer just now realized what Nat was already seeing. Tony poked his head up from behind Steve's broad shoulders and smiled.
"T-tony I don't t-think I'll last m-much..." He trailed off as Tony sucked on the skin right inside his thighs. He kissed, further until he was settled between his legs, then, with a naughty grin, licked a wet stripe right up Steve's twitching cock. He took the head in his mouth, tongue playing with his frenulum. Steve quietly gasped, spreading his legs open wider without even realizing it. Only a moment later, Tony was taking him all the way in, holding his hips down with both hands, that way Steve wouldn't be able to thrust up and Tony could set his own, excruciatingly slow pace. It was too much, Steve was used to cumming twice, sometimes even three times back to back. He usually never spent this much time between orgasms, being slow or thorough. He was so keyed up, he could feel everything like his senses were heightened, every inch of his cock screaming in joy in Tony's warm, wet mouth. Tony slowly circled his cock with his tongue, lapping his way up to the head before sucking him hard, taking him deeper, then pulling back off and starting over. Steve was in euphoria, body writhing in pleasure.
, why don't you just do nothing." Rhodey waved an arm in the air. "Just pine after him and wait for him to telepathically realize you're in love with him, and then he'll come flying in to whisk your crazy ass off your feet."
"Oh come on! You guys were supposed to be the judges! We can't end in a tie!" Tony whined to the rest of the Avengers.
Steve couldn't be happier. He'd resolved to start enjoying his favorite sport again, and was thrilled that his friend remembered and cared enough to take him to a game, let alone three, with the two teams he'd been struggling with, it was so considerate of him. He popped open the back of the Dodgers hat and put it on.
"Come on," Steve got up and motioned for Tony to follow. "Put on your shoes. I didn't think I'd have you up so early, so I didn't have anything specific planned until lunch. But I just had an idea."
"Oh no!" Tony's eyes went wide with interest, just how Steve hoped they would. He enjoyed making Tony go on one of his rants, especially if it would help lift his spirits. "What did I tell you about listening to strangers, Steve?! They were obviously messing with you. You need to send me that list so I can curate it. I'm not letting you waste your time on, say, Star Trek Enterprise, when you should just be watching the originals."
The room was suddenly way too small. Steve remembered the last time he was aware of the feeling of immense loneliness. It was right when he'd moved in to his old apartment after SHIELD defrosted him. He was still coming to terms with everything at the time, and was distraught that everyone he knew was dead. He did get to know the SHIELD staff pretty quickly, but it was a rough start to be sure.
"Yep. Get washed up." Tony patted Steve on the arm. "We'll make a night out of it! We can work on your movie list." He grinned, and Steve melted, it was so sweet of Tony to offer.
"I'm pretty sure they know exactly who we are. It's kind of hard to mix up two big celebrities like us, isn't it?" Tony laughed lightheartedly, thankfully taking this very well. "It's probably just the atmosphere of the place, every restaurant has a theme. If you haven't noticed, there's a lot of couples in here, so that's just their shtick. Come on, take a load off. I'm sure the food is worth it. I haven't had Cuban in a long time, and it smells great in here. How'd you find this place?"
Tony's plane was waiting, so Steve parked right under the entrance ramp. They both got off the bike, and the air was thick and hard to breathe in. Steve tried not to look completely distraught when he turned Tony around to unclip the helmet, pulling it up and off. Before he knew what he was doing, his hand was in Tony's hair, his fingers running through the soft, fluffy mane, smoothing out the helmet hair. Steve knew he should pull away, but he let himself feel close to the scientist just one more time.
“No. Keep going.” Tony encouraged him. “Just stings a little, but I’ll need it for that huge thing.” He said, referring to Steve’s cock, which gave a little twitch at the mention of filling him up. Steve slowed down anyways, adding more lube, taking his time to open Tony up just right. It was obvious that Tony wasn’t as experienced with this as the Other-him had been, Steve wasn’t sure if he’d ever been with a man before at all. But that made it all the more intimate, sharing these new and exciting experiences with the person he loved.
“Looking back, I would have done it all differently. I’d have told you everything sooner.” Steve said.
"The Mets?" Steve gave Tony a curious look while everyone else started clearing their weekend for the outing. "That's the new team around here, isn't it?"
"Surprise!!" He looked around, the whole team was in the doorway, behind them were presents, balloons, streamers and a variety of cakes and food.
"My song!" He exclaimed, and turned Steve around abruptly to start dancing with him, abandoning their quest for their group altogether. Steve didn't mind. He gladly turned Tony in a spin too, catching him by the hand again, and twisting his hips to the beat.
"Alright. That's understandable. How about we just chill and enjoy the game, okay? Let's not talk about..whatever it is right now. You can tell me or the therapist or whoever, whenever you're ready." If he was being honest with himself, he knew; he really did know, that he would never get over Steve. He just couldn't help himself around the man. He wanted to do everything possible under the sun to make all of Steve's troubles go away, if only to see him smile. If he needed to touch him, to be near him, to hear his laugh and flirt with him in order to quell some insatiable urge at the mere sight of the other man, then that was nobody's business but his own. Even if he could never have him all to himself, at least he'd always have these moments. Tony turned his attention back to the game, placing his head on Steve's shoulder. Physical contact was hit or miss, but when Steve didn't freak out, it usually seemed to calm the soldier down. Thankfully, Steve visibly relaxed, Tony could feel his muscles slacken under him.
"Wow, hell must have frozen over. Stark is making breakfast today?" Natasha's voice from behind Steve startled him out of his thoughts.
His vision whited out for a second, and in the next moment, he was staring up at the ceiling, a sweaty, panting Tony laying on top of him, both hearts racing together. They laid there for a few minutes before Steve was able to gather all his strength and wrap his arms around the genius.
"Y-yes." It was too late to back out now. Natasha didn't even try to hide the grin behind her mug. Tony shrugged and scooped some honey into Steve's coffee, stirring it for a second before leaving to place the honey back into the pantry.
He found some more of Other-Tony’s projects by the deep space telescope. They looked interesting - apparently he was aiming for something called a jump-point. But as much as Tony wanted to copy the notes down, he needed to finish his star observations before the morning sun made it too bright to see anything.
universe is left handed, meaning every particle spins in the opposite direction from my right handed universe. And for the most part - that’s been correct. Up until maybe a few years ago. That’s when the divergence happened, and I don’t know why.” He scrubbed his face, and looked up at the confused Steve.
choosing himself. They were joined now, two pieces of one whole. Steve’s happiness was Tony’s and Tony’s happiness was Steve’s.
"Oh….oh baby…fuck, yes!" Tony moaned as Steve explored Tony's opening further, taking small cautious licks at first, then delving in. Steve had wondered what Tony would taste like down there, and to be honest, it didn't really taste like much of anything but clean skin - he
He tried to think back to the gorgeous half naked men and women he saw today. But it felt so impersonal. Cheap. Fake. That didn't do it for him, so he tried to think of Peggy. That just made him sad.
"Not at all. You want a child to have a better life than you did, it's a great reason." Steve's heart sank thinking of how lonely Tony sounded when he talked about his childhood. "Howard was a shit father, huh?"
"That's good. Move slowly. Just wiggle your fingers and toes first if you want. Just so you feel em'."
been out. He would go to those horrible company parties with you just because he knew you hated them so much, and wanted to make your night a little more bearable. He came running back the moment you called him, without hesitation. You said so yourself - he’s tried time and time again to talk to you since he's been back, he's even called to ask
“I’m pretty sure Tony Stark doesn’t get enough sleep, no matter what universe he’s from.” Steve supplied. He gave Tony’s shoulders one more squeeze and pulled away. Tony wanted to ask him to stay just a little longer. “So, are you seeing anyone back home, then?”
The soldier ran his fingers through his hair, until eventually he went limp next to him. When Tony looked up again, Steve’s eyes were closed, his neck bent uncomfortably to his side, but even so, he was beaming with delight. Tony pulled over a pillow and shoved it under Steve’s weary head, and Steve looked content even when he started to snore softly. Tony’s mind was unusually quiet and calm, so he draped a blanket over them, and fell asleep in Steve’s hold soon after.
“Mmngh…” Steve moaned, bucking his hips up, chasing the friction. He’d never felt like this before - the insatiable need to give himself fully to someone like this. He wanted Tony right now, more than he’d wanted anything in his life. Tony teased him, raising his ass in the air so Steve couldn’t rub against him.
“Uh...I didn’t really have much.” Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder to see what he was searching for. It’s not like he brought more than a couple duffel bags back from Wakanda last week. The movers had arranged his things from the compound before he’d even arrived, and everything else had been here exactly as he’d left it all those years ago.
"Love you s-so much...ah...feel so good baby...fuck..." Tony tried to keep talking to Steve, but was losing himself as well. Steve reached behind him, shoving a pillow behind his back so he could watch Tony as he fell apart. Once he was balanced, he reached down again to stroke himself in time with Tony's thrusts.
So they stayed up for a while, Tony telling Steve about his troubles that day. Apparently there was some important project that Tony was trying to get approved, but a lot of the board members were against it because it wouldn't be profitable for the company. Today, those members decided to hold their own meeting, where they scheduled a town hall for next week, inviting some of the biggest shareholders, without consulting or inviting Tony.
to hang out with you. And I want to see you off. It has nothing to do with feeling bad. What happened to being pals?"
“It’s been so long! Glad to see you’re doing well.” A tall blonde woman approached him. She looked familiar, though Steve couldn’t immediately place where he knew her from. She had on a “PRESS” badge with the name Christine printed on it - so she was probably a journalist he’s talked to before.
my favorite!" Tony leaned in close and happily took the bite. Steve heard music playing in his head. It was perfect.
When the elevator doors opened on his floor, he noticed a package sitting outside his front door. There was no address, or indication to who it was from or what it was, but he took it inside his apartment anyways. He knew that the mail service at the tower wouldn't drop anything off to him if it wasn't safe. Curious, he opened it right away. Inside were several items, but again, no note that he could find to see who it was from.
Steve walked into the lab, carrying some hot cocoa for them to share. Tony had spent all night working on a new project he’d never seen before.
It had been over an hour. Steve was exhausted after such a long day, but he couldn't sleep. He kept replaying their elevator conversation in his head. He didn't know how it went so wrong. Maybe he hadn't picked the best time to tell Tony something like that, maybe he should have said something before taking Tony out. Maybe he'd fucked it all up, and now-
“Y’ don’ need t’pee?” Tony asked through a mouthful of toothpaste from the doorway, eyeing the lounging supersoldier.
"Plus, have you even been practicing with your phone? What if you get lost? What if you're in trouble, there's some sketchy people out there who will try to scam you if you're not careful-"
“You know. Awkward. Weird. Sexual tension?” Steve just stared right back at him. “You...you haven’t told him what happened?”
Tony sat in silence, staring at the floor for almost a minute before finally looking Steve in the eyes.
"I'd love that, Tony. I can't wait." Steve's smile radiated though his words, and Tony let out a tiny sigh of relief. "But you don't have to be delicate with me. I do want to talk about it, if that's okay. You've helped me out so much. You're a great friend, I'm so lucky to have you."
"Is there anyone who would not like to yield their time?" Her icy stare was directed at Williams, who stared right back, but didn't dare speak up.
“No, no. You’re right.” Tony crossed his arms. “That’s on me. I shouldn’t have butted in. Cap’s a grown man. He can fuck whoever he wants. It’s not like it would be the first time he falls for a complete stranger.”
"T....T'ny?" Steve was hoarse for some reason. His throat was as dry as a desert, but focusing on that sensation helped, somehow, even if it hurt a little.
“Nah.” Tony waved the idea away. “He doesn’t like me like that. Or at all, really. Your Tony is probably way nicer.”
"I don't mind it." Tony rubbed his chest. "I mean, yeah. It was really scary when it happened." Steve knew all about Afghanistan, but it was different hearing it from Tony. "That's part of the reason I get panic attacks sometimes. But I'm proud of what I built, and the arc reactor does a lot more than just keep me alive. It's the key to clean energy too, so I really love it actually." He blinked and saw Steve staring again, "Uh, but yeah. Not so great looking sticking out of my chest."
In his younger days, Tony might have jumped right back on Steve, could have probably gone all night with this stunning hunk. At his age, though, all he had was this blasted post-sex clarity. Fuck. He hoped Steve was still interested, even after he practically threw himself at him. Steve had just been so goddamned
"Of course Tony." Steve reassured him, but Tony must've still been on edge, because he froze up again at the contact, not taking his eyes off their hands. "I know you're only lookin' out for me."
"You...ah…you flatterer. Want to do the honors?" He handed Steve the bottle of lube, and put all his weight on Steve's torso, like he knew Steve could handle it.
"No." Steve had the box clutched to his chest this whole time. "There's lot'sa good memories too. After we left the camp, the Commandos made it their official cig, and we'd share stories at night around a campfire and the guys would smoke 'em. Bucky used to try to pick up dames by offering them a smoke outside the nightclubs. I remember one time we went to a game at Ebbets Field after saving up for a few months. We got to see a grand slam and Red Barber sent down a whole carton to the team." he chuckled and looked at Tony with red eyes. "That was in 41'. One of the only games I'd ever been at. And SHIELD tried to pretend it was a live radio broadcast when they first woke me up."
“Hm..” Tony contemplated for a second before smiling up at his husband. “That could make for a nice play area, don’t you think?”
"Mmmph.." Tony threw a couch pillow over his face and groaned. Those stupid comic books. They lied. All they ever said about Captain America was that he was strong, and brave, and determined. They never said anything about his smile. About his laugh. About how sweet and sensitive he could be, how he could make you feel like the only other person in the world. The way
"It better be that strawberry shortcake. Don't let the hounds get to it." He raised an eyebrow in Thor's direction.
"It's quite a lot for just a couple nights, isn't it?" Steve felt a little guilty at all the extravagance.
"Yeah, that sauce is amazing. Here, your turn again." Tony cut up a piece of chicken and lifted it to Steve's mouth. Steve closed his eyes and chewed thoughtfully, trying to hide just how much this was affecting him, hoping the darkness of the room would conceal his blush.
Steve shivered in nervous excitement. His nipples were rock hard, and somewhere off in the distance, he was aware of his swollen cock being pushed up into his abs by Tony's perfect, soft stomach. The pain receded and Tony let go of his hair, now lightly caressing it again while he slipped another finger in, this one sliding in easier than the first. Tony must've known it was coming, because he braced himself right before curving his fingers up, rubbing against Steve's prostate, making him yelp, almost jumping up in pleasure.
"Hey!" He held up the box for Tony to see. "It's Old Gold! They used to sponsor the Dodgers! Just like Red Barber used to say on the radio after a home run!
“Stop, honey. You’re making me blush!” A shy smile graced his face, the corners of his eyes crinkling with amusement at Steve's shock.
The lab was the closest place where he could be alone. He couldn't wait the extra 45 seconds it would take to get up to the penthouse. He sprinted to the closest open screen he found.
"Label looks all weird." Tony called out as he ran the sink. Steve didn't know what he could mean. It was the same, name brand toothpaste he'd used since he arrived in this century. “Ow! What the hell, your water’s so hot. Pipes must be running too close down here.”
"Yeah. He was an amazing player too. Rookie of the year, All star player and got MVP too. Basically got them the championship in 55'."
“I don’t know, but Tony was really wound up tight. I just hope he doesn’t take it the wrong way.” Steve grimaced.
got to him. Steve folded his arms, tensing up. Maybe he looked a little intimidating this way, but it helped him find some semblance of control, when all he wanted to do was scream at Tony, lash out at him, pull him close, make love to him, fight him,
Giddy with anticipation, Tony cleaned up and took a seat at his bar (hot chocolate in hand, no liquor tonight; he needed all his wits if he was going to come up with the best first date ever) when he heard a knock at the door.
"Fine, ugh. How am I supposed to say no to that face." Tony pretended he was relenting, but secretly he was enjoying the attention. "But there better not be any singing 'happy birthday' at restaurants or I'll tie you up and throw you in the back of my jet to New York, and your little adventure will be over." Steve smiled, he wouldn't mind that one bit, he thought. But he agreed and they settled back down, both leaning on each other under the blanket as they watched TV for a while. When Steve started to nod off, Tony tapped his shoulder and helped him get up. Tony threw the blanket over himself like a cape, and they walked to their respective bedrooms. Steve's door was closer, and Tony stopped him before he was able to walk in.
“Baby?” Steve probably felt him go stiff, because in the next moment, his hands were on Tony’s hips, trying to guide him off his lap. But Tony decided - he was going to be up front about this. He wasn’t going to hide anything, everyone’s opinions be damned. He pushed Steve’s hands off his hips, and shuffled back into his lap with a determined look on his face. Steve must have noticed how nervous he was, because he gave in, and wrapped his arms around him instead.
Steve woke with a startled snort at a dip on the other side of his bed. He flailed his arms, throwing off his blanket, and shifted to push himself up - raising his hands in the defensive position.
"I know." Tony smiled as the elevator stopped on Steve's floor. Steve was about to step out when a hand grabbed his elbow, loosely, just for a second before letting go. "Uh. Thank you. For helping me today. For everything. You know. With the meeting and you know...just helping to keep me distracted in general. I tend to overthink things sometimes and get reckless. So just, thanks again." Tony cut his rambling short. Steve just stared back for a minute, taking in how nice it was that Tony was opening up to him like this.
"I'm sure you're exaggerating." Rhodey tried to settle his fears. "He hugged you. If he was put off by a kiss, he would've pulled away, or pushed you off. Did he do that? Explain exactly how it happened, it was probably a misunderstanding."
Tony told him once, a long time ago, before their first big press conference, that they were in this together. They were still just getting to know each other, but Steve trusted him completely. Tony would love to grab Steve by the arm and drag him around an event like this one - making silly inside jokes in front of the press just to get Steve to laugh. Whispering juicy gossip about the celebrities in attendance into Steve's ear if he was ever nervous about meeting them. Drowning his drink in a second and asking Steve to go get him another when he could tell Steve was getting uncomfortable in a situation - just to give him an out. Little things like that would put Steve at ease.
“There you are. I thought you’d be down in the lab all night.” It was Steve, well - Other Steve. Tony could immediately tell from the way his hair was parted opposite than usual, and his stupid adorable freckles were backwards on his cheeks. He was in his jogging clothes, of course. Why was Steve looking for him right now, at such a god-awful hour?
"Oh!" Steve looked at his watch, 11:55am. Shit, he never slept in that long. "I'm so sorry, I'll get out of your hair right now! Let me just change and pack my things-"
Steve chuckled as the list grew longer. He figured Tony had met his CEO, Pepper, downstairs and was probably talking to her on the way to wherever they were going, as his list started getting more practical (likely thanks to Pepper) and more ridiculous (probably Tony joking around.)
Steve looked up at the Liberty Bell in front of him and snapped a picture. After a minute, he figured out how to send it to Tony.
"I'm just saying. If you're gonna do this whole 'exposure therapy' thing - just don't be surprised if the feelings don't go away. And don't be mad at me when I come back to say 'I told you so' when he finally makes a move on you."
They laughed and talked, and at the end of the night, after they'd ordered takeout to eat while watching world class cooks duke it out on Iron Chef, Steve made Tony promise to come back tomorrow so they could watch the end of that season, he really wanted to know who would win. Tony huffed a
“I miss us too.” Tony replied. He waited a moment before continuing. “But you have to hear me out. You’re….you’re
“It is Sunday, October 9th, 2016. My indicators are showing bizarre magnetic readings from you and your equipment, and the Ironman suit you are wearing is unregistered.” Jarvis continued. “Might you need a polarization, Sir?”
me. I wish I knew what Other-Tony did, or said to him. You don’t know what it’s like at the tower. He’s so relaxed with everyone else, they’re all best buddies. And me? Steve can’t even be in the same room with me without going completely rigid, like he thinks I’m going to lose it and attack him, or his buddies again. I just feel so...dangerous there. And maybe I still am. So, yes. I’m unloveable.”
"Got that J? Tell him that Pepper said to go to the SI entrance door if he wants a driver, don't use the taxis." Tony smiled back.
"Love you! Love you... Love...you..." He panted as he came, red cock untouched, squirting all over his chest and stomach. With ragged breath, he slowly dragged himself back to reality, endorphin rush fading away, and he let himself bask in the warm, messy afterglow. His release had been overwhelming, he'd never had anyone else play with his ass like that before, and it felt so good, like Tony was filling in a gap he didn't even know he had.
"Very well." Pepper, cool and collected, kept going. "Mr. Ralph Emerson - Major shareholder and Head of Accounting-"
"That's understandable." Tony let go of Steve's hand and picked up his phone, pulling up a contact and texting it to Steve's number. "I have a great therapist. Don't feel any pressure to use her, but she's very good and keeps everything confidential. She's used to high profile clients, and if you don't feel comfortable with her, she has a hand picked list of colleagues she can recommend." Tony put his phone away and picked up Steve's hand once more. "I hope I'm not overstepping here. I'm sorry about the cigarettes. Seriously, I won't be offended, I can get rid of them if you want."
Steve cleaned himself up, and made his way back to his room to get ready. He'd need to be prepared if he really wanted to help Tony - his
“Well, I’m him!” Tony lit up. “Tell me all about it. We’ve still got some time to kill before I’m sent back.”
"Nah. Got plenty of signed baseballs in Howard's collection. Feel free to take whatever you find if you want to go to the mansion sometime."
Oh! Poor Tony - he was just concerned about Steve! He must think Steve would be upset about Nat sending photos without his permission. Steve smiled, placing a hand on Tony's, which was resting between them on the couch.
"Sure, soldier. If it helps to see it that way." He beamed. Steve lost himself in the music, in the flow, in the way Tony pushed him, pulled him, any way he wanted, commanding his every move. Tony laughed when the tempo sped up, turning and turning Steve. He had perfect equilibrium, thanks to the serum, but he still felt dizzy, bubbly, drunk, like he was a whole new person with Tony and he never wanted to look back. Tony clutched him by the waist after catching him in the middle of a twist at the end of a song, and Steve caught the distinctive flash of a camera from their left side. He froze, holding his breath.
“Shut up.” He tried to make an angry face at her, but after a second his smile bled through, and they found themselves laughing out loud. “Oh god, he knows what my
“Uh. Yep. Just needed some...coordinates.” He bluffed, he didn’t know if their relationship in this universe was as ambivalent as it was back home. At least Steve seemed to be calm, lighthearted even - a good sign that they might be friends here.
He let his thoughts wander on what that might be like. He'd seen plenty of beautiful ladies advertising on the street that night in nothing more than heels, thongs and pasties. But he found that after the initial shock, it didn't excite him at all. He'd seen advertisements of shirtless, muscular men as well, plastered everywhere. Though he knew he liked men too, even those pictures didn't really get him going.
"So...kids. Is that what you wanted? With Aunt Peggy? Is that what you want now?" Tony asked him during the 7th inning stretch.
"It's okay." Steve was terrified he'd ruined everything. "Well...I suppose this is goodnight then." He didn't budge, though, frantically searching his brain for a way to get back to the light mood they had lost.
Tony wasn’t a religious guy, but maybe the God in this universe just liked him more. He really couldn’t come up with any explanation. All other factors seemed to be the same. Most of history was identical to the history back home. There were just a few small differences in recent time, though he couldn’t place exactly when or where the change started.
"Sorry." Tony pulled back and shoved something big into Steve's extended hands. "I guess I nodded off there at the end, Jarvis was finally able to wake me up but I got it done this morning."
"Bruce makes curry sometimes." Steve wasn't exactly sure if any of these were curry. There were green, yellow, red, brown, white and orange sauces laid out in front of him, they all smelled intoxicating. Tony took pity and prepared a plate for Steve, and after lunch, they agreed that everything was delicious.
"I don't care." Steve smiled, big and bright, just like Nat said. "You might have to teach me though. I don't know how to dance to save my life." Tony seemed convinced then, always up for a challenge, and couldn't help a giddy grin.
The next day, Tony was laying down on the couch, waiting for Steve to come back from showering. Natasha walked in with a hot mug and eyed Tony, until he looked up at her.
"You're not selfish at all." He smiled at Tony, who looked away. "I don't know what you were going on about earlier, but it seems like an amazing plan to me."
“Yeah. Okay.” Tony’s heart almost leapt out through his reactor. The sun had set now, and he could see a few dimly lit stars appearing in the sky behind Steve’s radiant smile. “May I take you on a date tomorrow?”
He decided, then and there, that the life they led in the mirror-universe wasn’t impossible after all - he didn’t need luck, wouldn’t need to break the laws of physics to keep Tony. He just needed to make the choice to love him, every day. To give up his pride and his fears for him.
"Nah, no one will recognize you this way. Let's go." Steve led them outside, where they walked seemingly in a random direction. After just a block, Steve found what he was looking for.
"Huh?" Steve's heart skipped a beat, making him lose focus, and his character on the screen was knocked out a second later by Tony.
“Yeah.” Steve ran a shaky hand through his hair. It was still all tangled up from last night. “Um...no. I don’t - I don’t think I can make it today.”
The line disconnected. Steve wondered if he'd said something wrong, but decided he'd probably just praised Tony a bit too much and flustered him. He just couldn't help but say all that stuff, though. He really meant it, and wanted Tony to know how special he was to him. Putting his phone away, he looked up at the radiant blue sky. Today was a better day. He turned his bike around and headed back to the small town, he'd need to grab some lunch before heading out.
"Sounds promising." Tony laughed, "I'm kidding. I just wanted to see your reaction. Here's what you'll be wearing." He pulled out a pair of swim trunks from behind his back with his other hand. They were plastered with huge eagles carrying American flags. It was so embarrassing, that Steve almost picked the Speedo over that.
“You okay?” Tony pulled back, meeting Steve’s eyes. “Probably still half asleep, huh? We don’t have to if you don’t want to.” He didn’t ask with any bite, or to humiliate, but Steve wondered if it was really
Steve was whisked away and finally Tony plopped him down on a chair at a patio table, overlooking the whole street. Tony was off, talking to one of the restaurant workers. Steve took the opportunity to look around. This was a Mexican restaurant. Must have been pretty authentic too, since he now recognized the language everyone was speaking as Spanish, and his eyes almost bugged out of his head when he realized Tony was speaking Spanish too! That man continues to amaze me, he thought, when he saw Tony heading back towards the table with a huge yellow drink in each hand.
"Ahem." Steve coughed, getting Tony's attention before he got lost in his thoughts again. "So you'll let me try to reason with them?"
"Yesh." Tony muttered into Steve's armpit. Steve chuckled and pulled Tony out of there, still holding on to him with one arm, and pulled the tray of food over to them, setting it on top of his own lap.
"No!" Steve looked shocked enough at the suggestion, so maybe that wasn't the case. "That's not it at all!" Ah, then it
"Grand Canyon. Not a bad way to spend a birthday. Are you planning on spending your night in Sin City?"
It was a heady thing to think about. He must've fallen asleep in the middle of that thought, because in the next moment, someone was squeezing his arm.
"Mmm....Fine. Gimme the rest of the slice, meanie. Since you insist on tricking me into eating my veggies by making them taste good." He huffed as Steve beamed, and they all enjoyed the rest of their pizza from their first ever 'Boyfriend Cooking Competition.'
"S'gonna be hard not to." Steve smelled the delicious looking food and dug in, hoping he hadn't ruined the mood.
"That's too bad." Steve sounded dejected. His face looked like he'd just watched a puppy cry. Well, Tony wouldn't let
"You...you really don't have to." Tony mumbled. "I had a great birthday today. You don't have to keep me company just because you feel bad."
"I mean, what happened to me yesterday? It seems like you might know." Steve tried to explain, "I've never felt like that before. I was so worried about nothing all day. Weird, like I couldn't focus on anything, and my heart was racing a lot and I felt so much dread. Then last night, well, you saw."
After the show, he got a hotel closer to Fremont Street, which was quieter than the strip, and settled down for the night. He was already feeling much better than yesterday. Sleeping until noon definitely helped, he felt refreshed. Felt more in tune with himself than he had in a while, which was...interesting. He'd noticed a lot of gentlemen's clubs on the way. Jarvis had politely suggested that Las Vegas was a good place for 'adult entertainment' - and Steve wasn't so dense that he didn't know what
Tony looked it over. He read it a few times. When he heard Rhodey yelling at him to 'Hurry! Show me!' he held up the screen to the video camera on his flight table.
“I don’t think so.” Steve smiled sadly. “I feel like I’ve been crazy about him for...well since forever. But he’s never given me any indication that he liked me back. I mean, maybe he did, way back then. But a lot has happened since then, and I just don’t think he still feels that way anymore, if he ever felt that way at all.”
“Sir, your heart rate is exceeding safe levels. Please, I recommend you take a deep breath and relax.” FRIDAY calmly continued.
“Your freckles! They’re on the wrong side, idiot!” Tony ignored her, scoffing at Steve. “You couldn’t even get the mask right? And the hair, his bed head’s always parted to the left, asshole, right where his eyebrow wrinkle should be. You’ve got it all wrong. You really didn’t do much research, did you? It’s easy enough to find his pictures on the internet, you know.”
“No. Of course not.” Steve said. Tony slowly blinked up at him, sweet and completely beautiful. “You wanna get ready with me?” Steve suggested, remembering how Other-Tony expected them to share their morning routine together. Tony smiled at that, finally waking up, and nodded eagerly. Steve picked him up bridal style and Tony giggled in his arms. He walked them over to the bathroom, where he placed Tony on the edge of the sink, and stood between his legs caressing his thigh as they brushed their teeth together.
to a man before. He’d never done much with men, or women, or anyone in general to be honest. But it couldn't be much different from doing it to himself, right? Plus, he didn't want to look like he didn't know what he was doing, not in front of Tony. So he took the bottle and wrapped his arms around Tony, squirting some lube onto his fingers, and gripped Tony closer with his other hand. He reached down, slowly, and let his wet fingers rest on Tony’s hole for a moment. When Tony squirmed back, pleading for more, he found the courage to push through the tight ring, and he couldn’t believe how easily his finger slipped in.
Thus, the New Hero Deal. Months of careful preparation. Months of dread. Knowing that every success would bring him one step closer to the man who could shred his heart to pieces with a mere utterance. But he had to do it. For the team. For the world. No matter how much it hurt.
“Ah, ah. Don’t want to spoil the main event, do we?” Tony grinned, running his hands over Steve’s now exposed chest.
It was toward the end of the meal, while he was delicately placing a spoonful of salty caviar into his mouth - Pepper said they were some kind of fish eggs or something - when she brought up Tony out of the blue.
The real reason he was here was a little... embarrassing. In reality, he was looking to get away from the fireworks tonight. Jarvis said they were banned in the park, so he'd carefully timed his days to bring him here today.
Look, there's going to be technical stuff in this chapter, but it's not all that important. It's just to feed into the plot. Again, don't think too hard :)
“Why are you in the suit?” Steve walked up to him. “I haven’t seen this one before. It’s nice.” He knocked on the helmet. “Open up, I’m about to go.”
He also had his arms stretched out in front of him. Steve didn't hesitate, didn't even think or say a word before barreling into Tony, hugging him tight.
"Tony. Hey." Steve's heart jumped a little at that nickname. His brain helpfully supplied him with memories of last night, Tony sweetly calming him down with names only his ma had ever called him. It's not that he didn't like being Cap. He didn't mind all the nicknames the team came up with, actually. But, well...it had felt really nice, all things considered, Tony's words washed over him like a warm breeze at the end of that horrible experience, lulling him to sleep. Now, he was back to being just Cap.
“So, what? All I had to do all these years is jump on your lap to get you to kiss me?” Tony scoffed.
"Yes, ma'am." Pepper chuckled under her breath at the formality and closed the door behind her, leaving the two alone.
Steve walked inside and closed the door behind him, hearing Tony slip out. He got into his own soft, comfortable bed, and fell asleep in a heartbeat.
fault, and he insisted that we watch this crap. I should've cleaned your list up before I let them see it."
Well. If he couldn't have Steve like that, then at least he could try to be a good person and be a genuine friend for him.
see Tony today. The thought of that made him queasy - he took a seat next to Bucky before speaking up again, trying his best to sound like a Captain that wasn’t on the brink of hysterics.
"Hm." Steve didn't want to hold anything back, it was important for him to be completely honest. "At first I didn't know. When SHIELD found me, I mean. That's sort of why I went on that cross-country trip. I wanted to see who I was as a person, where I fit in, if anywhere, if I even belonged in this world anymore. I missed the time I grew up in so much, and felt so alone when I first woke up. I wanted to see if it was even worth it to stick around."
Anyways, hope y'all liked the short update, I'll have more up soon! Had a bit of writer's block earlier this week but it's getting better.
"Alright, yay! Hurray. Good job guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just...take a day." Tony wanted to breathe, wanted to make sure he could keep breathing and couldn't stop himself from talking, at himself and at no one in particular. "Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I want to try it." Tony looked over at Steve, who was smiling at him like he'd just made the sun rise. To be fair, he
"Okay, well...did you sleep okay last night? I mean.." Tony looked around. This place was much too public to delve into Steve's mental health like this. "You know what, we can talk about it tonight over dinner. If you want. We don't have to. I just want to make sure you're okay. You've been skittish all day. You'll let me know if something is happening, right? You can trust me, can't you?"
“Oh, it was all Tony.” Steve beamed. “He was the one who kissed me first. He asked me to go steady, and he was the one who asked me to marry him. How was I supposed to say no? He’s so wonderful, and handsome, and smart and funny… really, he’s the best - I don’t know what he sees in me. I ask him all the time, and he just says it’s because I’m his Sunshine.”
Tony rolled his eyes. "I'm sure you could. But there's no harm in asking for help if you need it. Got that?"
Steve waited for Jarvis to answer. It had almost been a full minute, and he was about to ask again, thinking that maybe something was wrong with the AI, when he finally heard back.
Before they left, they stopped by the Jackie Robinson statue outside the stadium, and Steve took one last picture while they waited for their ride.
"Yeah." Tony still wasn't looking at him. And how could he blame him? Tony spent his birthday this year angry, upset, locked away alone in his lab because of Steve. Because they had fought over nothing again. Steve's temper betraying him as always.
never ask for flight clearance. Haven't you learned by now that it's easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission?" They were in Tony's kitchen, the smaller man offering up a bowl of chocolate covered almonds. Rhodey pushed his hand away, and Tony shrugged, plopping a few in his mouth.
"Thanks, Tony." Steve smiled, not taking his eyes off the sunrise on the other side of the vast canyon. "Isn't it a little early for you?" He looked at his watch, 5:32am. "Or are you still up from last night?"
“Will it hurt?” Steve asked. Tony looked him up and down before shaking his head and chuckling. He got up and walked over to a nearby sofa, patting the seat next to his. Steve sat next to him.
"Jarvis? Could you save this list for me? I'll take a look at it later. I think I'll head out for a bit."
“Uh...you’re still in your PJ’s?” It was Sam. Oh right, he was supposed to meet Sam and Bucky for their run and breakfast today.
"Good luck." Tony smiled and waved them goodbye. The moment the car was out of sight, he dashed back in, running to the closest elevator, jamming the emergency button as soon as the doors closed.
"He did. This is for Captain America. He moved in today." Tony said, without looking up from his phone, where he was currently editing some security code so Steve wouldn't have any trouble coming in and out of the building. "J - tell him I know he wants to go back to see Brooklyn ASAP but he's going to have to wait to go with me. There's no way he's ready for that hellhole without a guide."
Steve shook is head no. "SHIELD offered, but the doctors there seemed...off. Like I was some experiment they wanted to study. I was afraid the therapist would treat me the same way."
Tony went straight to work, got up on his knees, spreading his legs around Steve’s thighs, and expertly reached back with one slick hand to start opening himself up. He looked up to see a wide-eyed Steve frozen in place, his gaze fixed on Tony.
to pull Tony closer. But he didn't get the option- Tony threw his arms around his neck and jumped, and Steve caught him, unintentionally gripping his ass in the process. It made Tony moan, and Steve felt that right down to his cock.
"It's okay." Tony said in an uncharacteristically soothing tone. "Let's get you upstairs." They silently made their way inside and into the elevator. Steve guessed someone would bring his bags up and put away his bike. Tony held on to Steve's arm the entire way up, likely making sure he wouldn't nod off again and fall over. Steve could've gotten up on his own, but didn't want Tony to pull away, so instead he closed his eyes and leaned against the wall, letting the other man dote on him. All too soon, they were in front of his bedroom door.
"I don't want anyone else, baby." Tony let out a tiny whimper at hearing the pet name being used for him. "You know the only reason I let him touch me, was because I thought it was you, right? Since I met you, I haven't wanted anyone else. You're it for me, Tony."
"SHIELD's had him for months, Tony." She pointed out. "They did a whole program to catch him up, and I'm sure he's learned things along the way." She placed a hand on his phone. "Jarvis can take care of him for now. Why don't you let the man get settled in. I'm sure he'd rather hang out with you in person anyways, instead of a bunch of notes."
“Nah.” Steve picked Tony up in his arms, carrying him back into the bedroom. He loved that Tony was so pliant, letting Steve pick him up whenever he wanted, without fuss. “We have to become a close-knit group before we can do all that, right? So a day to just hang out is the perfect team exercise.” Steve loved hearing Tony’s little giggle as he finally let him down in Tony’s closet. He hooked his chin on Tony’s shoulder, watching him pick out clothes for the day. “Unless you have any objections?”
“It’s not a competition.” Steve ran a hand against Tony’s cheek. Tony leaned into it, and smiled up at him.
As they kept texting back and forth, Tony wondered if he could convince the soldier to give him a private fashion show tonight.
Tony glared at him, arms crossed and puffing up his chest right back. After a stare-down, Tony finally seemed to have given in.
He opened his eyes and stretched, better wake up soon. He'd probably have a long morning of talking to do with Tony, though it didn't seem dreadful at all after last night. Actually, he was really looking forward to it. Tony was like a whole new person right now. So different from the cold acquaintance he'd been around the last few weeks. He thought he’d have to get used to how distant Tony had become. Then again, they hadn’t spent any time alone in so long. Maybe this was how Tony could really be around him. He hoped they would talk things out peacefully for once, and maybe this sweet new Tony would be here to stay.
"Looks like he didn't like the dark pants though." Steve handed her phone back, "See? After you sent the photo of the back of the dark ones, he says 'You're killing me' and some yellow crying faces."
And they fought again in Siberia. It was heartbreaking, earth-shattering, how such a beloved icon - an angel on earth - could bring Tony crashing down in moments like these. It was a war he never asked for, a war that he gladly surrendered every time Steve mercifully extended any shred of kindness towards him. Because through all their arguments - this was the same man who also gave him unforgettable moments, who made him so happy, made every minute of his miserable life worth it with nothing more than a smile. Steve had told him, time and time again, how proud he was of him, something Tony never heard from anyone else that he looked up to in his life.
why we’re here. Because when we’re here, we know where we stand, we know who we trust, and we know it’s all thanks to you.
“He said photons are random.” Steve trekked on, trying to move the conversation forward. “And that is the only change that could have set things apart. It was in 2012, when we-”
"It would be an honor!" Thor agreed. "I am no stranger to helping civilizations progress. Why, I recently encountered a giant race of dwarfs in the outermost regions of space, and carried power structures for them as large as your city's buildings!"
him, we could move forward without ever having to get into the ugly truth. I thought I could have it all. So, it was easier to keep it from you. I know now that it was stupid, to think I could’ve kept secrets from you. But that’s why I never told you about your parents. About Bucky and what we were doing all those years. I just, I wanted to come home one day, my friend by my side, and have you back too. Instead, I pushed you away, I lost you. I’m so sorry, Tony. I hate myself for disappointing you.”
You kiss babies and help old ladies cross the street and everyone loves you. The team loves you. The team is happy to follow you to the ends of the earth - because you’re an amazing leader with or without me. You’re like, the picture-perfect boy scout and soldier and hero. And I’m….well I...I don’t fit in. I’m nothing like you guys. I met Other-Steve when I was in the mirror dimension.”
"Whoa! Easy there, Cap." But Tony chuckled and threw his arms around Steve too, hugging him back just as hard. Steve relished the feeling a little longer. He felt his ears burning, and pulled back, embarrassed at himself. "Guess that's a yes, huh?"
Steve did. It had been one of the bigger blows about the future. His all time favorite team of his all time favorite pastime had been moved to another city. On the
Well, at some point, Steve was going to have to live up to his Captain America reputation. He bravely joined their hands, resolved to speak everything he'd held inside.
"I mean, we don't have to talk about it if you don't want." Tony shyly replied. "We can just, you know. Hang out." He got uncharacteristically quiet, waiting for a response.
An ache ran through his chest when he opened it. It was a photo of Tony, smiling wide. Next to him were Clint and Natasha with pointed party hats on, in the middle of laughing. In the back, Bruce and even Thor were seen digging their forks into an entire cake, probably unaware Tony was even taking a picture.
“No?” Steve asked, and Tony just huddled deeper into his chest in response. “Then what, Tony? What do you want from me?” He gently pulled Tony’s face up. “I’ll do anything. Tony, I need to show you that I care, just tell me - how do I show you?”
"Steve!" He caught up with him before he was able to make it back to the exit. Steve turned around and looked relieved to see him.
"That's right. I'm video calling you. You can see me on the screen, if you want. And I'll be able to see you, if you want."
“And he said you got mad at Steve, but won’t tell him why. So your price of admission; you need to tell me what’s going on.” Pepper stuck out her chin to make her point.
to say worried. Worried I'd ruin our friendship." Steve threw himself back on the couch. "And now, I went and fucked it up with this. I should've known right away something was up. Of
Steve took the opportunity to stick his tongue down his throat as he thrust forward. Tony moaned into him, and he snapped his hips again, making Tony whine in arousal. Tony’s arms tightened around his neck, he didn’t want their lips to part even for a second. Steve was thrusting into him from both ends, timing his cock and tongue to penetrate Tony at the same time, as deep as he could go.
"Your schedule is completely free tomorrow afternoon through Sunday morning as well, sir." Jarvis politely informed him.
"I'm so happy that you're here." He whispered. Tony snored softly in response, and Steve felt more at home than he had in a long, long time. The comfortable new position quickly lulled him back into a deep sleep.
my Sunshine. My muse, my reason for still living in this century. You make me so happy, happier than I ever knew I could be, and I want that for
"Hm. Have you talked to-" Tony furrowed his brows and looked around, obviously not satisfied with their location. "Wait. I'll text you." He whispered before twisting again, this time leaning his head against Steve's arm and throwing his legs over the other couch arm, essentially using Steve as a pillow. Steve almost missed his phone buzzing in his pocket over the blood rushing in his ears.
“Nothing.” Tony took out a notebook - any of his tablets, and even his phone would be more than useless here - and began taking notes from the blueprints scattered on the floor. They seemed to be some kind of solar sail for long-distance space travel. He couldn’t imagine why the Other-Stark would need this, but who knows what kind of contracts he might have taken on in another life. He took notes on a couple more blueprints he found around the lab: A size-altering gauntlet, maybe for the Hulk? If the Hulk was still around in this dimension. Some kind of ray - he could tell from the specs that it was meant to slow matter down to near-zero movement. He didn’t know what good that would do, but he took the notes anyways. And upgrades - so, so many upgrades to Captain America’s shield, his uniform, his weapons, everything.
