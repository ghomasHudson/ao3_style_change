Steve flinches, braces himself, and steps through the door. “Tony?” he calls, then again, louder. Tony doesn’t answer. Steve moves farther into the room, which looks like nothing so much as a futuristic car garage, and calls Tony’s name a third time.
“You could.” Tony hadn’t even meant to say it, but the words are out there, and he can’t take them back.
Tony eyeballs him, like he’s not sure if he’s making a joke. “I’ll ask Pepper what she thinks. They keep in touch.” Tony makes a face that Steve can’t quite parse. “If she doesn’t know anything, I’ll ask Natasha. She’s still angry with Fury over the whole thing.”
For a long moment, Tony stares after him, then pours himself a cup of coffee and stares at that. He’s not entirely sure he knows what just happened.
“Help each other out.” Tony’s pretty sure he sounds like a broken record. Or a parrot. He’s usually more articulate than this, he’s almost positive.
Eight days after Steve stopped being able to turn around without seeing Tony’s face splashed over every media surface with the brunet McPherson alongside, he gets called in for some kind of meeting. There’s no preparatory packet to read through, no Fury coming in to beard him in the gym, just a phone call after breakfast, “1300 in the conference room, Captain,” and then nothing.
Pepper eyes him for a moment from the doorway, then comes all the way in, circles him slowly, brushes at his shoulders, and then nods approvingly. “Very nice,” she says. “He’ll only have eyes for you.”
stop it. The Maximoff girl, she showed me – you knew. You knew I could have saved everyone. You knew it, at the end, when I was watching you die. When it was too late for any of us. I can’t let that happen.”
“Like a picture,” Natasha says firmly, and Tony’s pretty sure she’s rolling her eyes at Barton as hard as he is. “You blow up a picture to make it bigger. Someone blew up these rats to make them bigger. Expanded them.”
A whirring noise sounds under the blaring guitars and screaming vocals, and then something pokes Steve sharply in the back. He spins, hands coming up automatically, only to find himself face to face with a long robotic arm with pincers for fingers. The thing chirps at him, and Steve takes half a step back.
Tony can’t help an incredulous snort, and Pepper’s nostrils flare like she’s ready to yell, but she takes a deep breath and when she speaks, it’s clearly not him she’s angry with.
“Of course,” Tony waves a hand like it’s a foregone conclusion that he would share whatever information he digs up.
Tony swears, and rubs a hand over his face. “Fuck it,” he says, and puts the coffee back on the counter. “Lock it all down, J. I’m going to bed.”
in a way it hadn’t before. Now he has actually signed papers, and is about to go sign more, and then he and Tony are going to be
Tony’s reply is lost to the general noise as Steve gets farther away, just a low murmur followed by the tinkle of laughter.
Tony frowns, but before he can figure out how to ask what Steve’s actually thinking, Barton is declaring they need takeout when they get home, and Bruce is chiming in over the open line that there’s a new Indian place he’s been meaning to try.
“Tony,” Ms. Potts is holding a plate with a blueberry bagel already sliced and spread with more cream cheese than can be considered healthy. “Come, sit, eat.” She gestures with her free hand at one of the vacant stools, and Tony, surprisingly, does as told, taking the plate from her with a grin. “You, too, Captain,” she points imperiously at another stool. “We’re planning.”
“We’ve got all the civilians out,” Coulson’s voice comes through for the first time since he’d told them he was on site with reinforcements. “We’ll send in a team to run a final sweep.”
“It will eventually.” Natasha seems pretty confident about that, so Tony’s going to take her word for it.
Tony’s fingers squeeze briefly around Steve’s, and Steve realizes they’re still holding hands. He supposes that’s what they’re meant to be doing, and wonders all in a flash what this looks like from the outside.
Something like half a second later, Steve breaks their staring contest first. Pepper’s shooing him towards the door to the hall, and Tony looks around, and realizes it’s just the three of them in the room.
Steve settles in, and tries not to fidget while he waits. He’s earlier than he’d meant to be. He’d had a meeting at SHIELD regarding a mission he and Clint had been supposed to be involved in that was being passed off to another team – “in view of other priorities, Captain, you understand” – and the handoff had gone more quickly than expected. Clint had headed back to the Tower, but Steve hadn’t seen the point, had just changed at SHIELD, as he’d originally planned, and come straight to the restaurant. But now he’s wishing he’d gone, too, if only to kill a little more time.
“Well, what kind of husband would I be if I didn’t look after my spouse’s affairs?” Tony shakes his head at himself. “Tell her that her opinion has been noted, and thank you.”
, but there’s something almost soft in his expression. “Glad you feel comfortable, then,” is all he says.
,” Pepper’s tone is clearly an attempt at not sounding irritated, which is just great for her, because Tony is plenty irritated enough for the both of them. He was in a groove, and as much as he’s trying to cling to it, the interruption has knocked his focus loose, and he’s becoming rapidly aware of the headache building behind his eyes from lack of sleep, and the sour feeling in his stomach from too much coffee on not enough food. “I am
Steve huffs out a breath that might be a laugh under any other circumstances. “Can you match my breathing?” he asks, inhales slowly, holds it, exhales, holds, and Tony struggles to follow, tries not to think about anything else, doesn’t think about car accidents that might not have been accidents, or police in his dorm room, or closed-casket funerals. Inhale, hold, exhale, hold. Steve’s grip on his shoulders loosens a bit, but he doesn’t let go, just sweeps his thumbs back and forth in a motion that should be irritating but somehow manages to be soothing in its steady beat, like he’s counting his breaths by the movement.
Steve heads north, figures he can run through Central Park for a while and pick up food on his way back, and lets his mind clear down to the air in his lungs and the steady beat of his sneakers on the pavement. It’s relaxing, almost meditative, and a couple hours pass before he notices how late it’s getting and returns to the Tower.
Steve nods again, anyway, doesn’t have to ask what the other man means. “He’s very frustrating,” he says, hopes it doesn’t sound like whining.
“I suggest you ask your fiancé about McPherson,” Fury tells him, rising. “I don’t have time for this.”
Natasha shrugs, like it’s not a big deal. And it’s not, Tony thinks, it doesn’t really matter. Except for how it is and it does. “It seemed like something he should know. He’d had a few misconceptions. Coulson corrected a few, I corrected another.”
“I figured I might as well be useful, since I’m here, rather than watch it all go down on the news,” Rhodes explains.
“Our esteemed members of the press,” Fury’s voice is dripping sarcasm, “have decided that they weren’t getting enough mileage out of Stark’s old flames, so they’re trying something different on for size. This,” he waves at the screen on the wall, “is part of their latest attempt to stick their collective nose into Avengers business.”
“Agents Romanov and Barton have returned to their quarters and are equipping themselves. Captain Rogers is en route to the tower. Dr. Banner is in his lab, and wishes to speak with you.”
“Is Tony still in his workshop?” Steve asks, once he’s passed the security guards at the side entrance and is alone in the elevator again.
“The Avengers are assembling around the breakfast bar,” Jarvis tells him, and Steve blinks in surprise.
“Did you see where they went?” If Steve sounds like he’s trying not to roll his eyes, Coulson sounds like he’s pinching the bridge of his nose and taking relaxing breaths.
Steve tries not to flush. “Did Ms. Potts say how the leak went? Or the. The press release? That was tonight?”
“Mostly. Cheaper than paints, and easier to take with you. Did some interesting courses in school with different media. I liked oils. Charcoal was a lot of fun, but messy. My mother was always threatening to make me do my own laundry.”
Steve’s head comes up, and it’s like Tony can actually see every muscle tense at the sight of him. “Tony,” he acknowledges.
That gets a laugh from Tony, a little grateful for the sentiment – which he knows is real, he does – and a little grateful for the break in the tension. “You’re going to kick Captain America’s ass?” he asks, reaches up to hold onto Rhodey’s wrists for a moment, appreciating the contact.
“What the hell?” he hisses. If this is retaliation for the height crack, Steve is pretty sure it’s overkill.
“You’ve been working for nearly twenty-four hours,” Pepper responds tartly. “At least, it’s been nearly twenty-four hours since Rhodey left, and he said you had gone under before he’d cleared the room.”
There’s a sleek black car sitting a few feet away, but Tony just waves at it as they pick their way out onto the main street.
Steve takes a deep breath and releases it, realizes he was standing almost at attention and forces himself to relax. If he hadn’t had it from Natasha that Tony and Ms. Potts really had broken up well before this charade started, he’d be wondering about it again. As is, he can’t help but think Ms. Potts is a little more protective of Tony than is really warranted in this situation. Steve doesn’t
“If you think I don’t know Jarvis warned you I’d do something dire if you didn’t pick up, you’ve got another think coming,” Pepper tells him tartly, but she looks marginally placated. She’s stopped scowling at least. “You’ve got your interview with Anderson Cooper tomorrow. I know it will be difficult for you, but you need to not flirt with him.”
“Right,” Steve nods, tries on a smile. He feels like he’s on stage with the USO tour again, only no one told him his lines.
“I need to tell you,” Steve hesitates, looks more unsure than Tony has ever seen him. “I don’t know how to tell you. But you’re right, it’s not my – I don’t have the
There’s a thundering in Tony’s ears, and the tiny voice in his brain that’s still functioning logically is saying it’s his heartbeat, but the rest of him is just trying to breathe. His vision tunnels, and everything goes grey.
sleep with Steve Rogers when the man is in his dance space and touching him. “No one would approve,” he tries, as if he’s ever given a damn before, has made a point not to, but Steve might. Maybe. Tony’s come to realize that Steve is a bit of a rebel, but he somehow still always has to be the best Boy Scout, helping kittens cross streets and saving little old ladies from trees, and it’s not like there are badges for getting heartsick billionaires laid, but it’s just like Steve to offer to sleep with him for the good of the team without realizing what a mess it would actually make. “Besmirching a national icon, and all that.”
Pepper opens her mouth as if to refute it, sighs, and shakes her head. “I’ve given the weekend PR team my statement to release this evening,” she continues after a moment. “We decided it best to go with an expression of deep disappointment that your relationship was being dragged about like this, and that, while it is true you are engaged, we would like to ask that your privacy – and that of Captain Rogers – be respected going forward.”
“Don’t be mad, Snack Pack,” Tony taps an awl against one palm. “He was only pissed at me for my own good, yesterday. He just wants everyone to be as full of patriotism and derring-do as he is, and that sometimes manifests itself as yelling, when all a person’s done is give him a compliment.”
“Tony?” Steve prompts, and Tony realizes he’s just been standing there, staring up into Steve’s stupidly perfect face like an idiot. “Do you –”
Tony snorts. “Of course not. He’s just doing me a favor. Doing us all a favor. Taking one for the team. Selfless Steve Rogers to the rescue.”
She eyes him for another minute, then nods, seemingly satisfied. “Tony shouldn’t be much longer, if he hasn’t gotten too distracted. I think it’s lovely that you want to take him out for dinner.”
There’s another pause. “We have all put a lot of work into fixing the image you and Stark are presenting to the public,” Coulson says eventually. “You and Stark included. The rest of us would prefer it if you could keep your domestic squabbles behind closed doors, if you must have them. And if you could keep them off the public channel that would also be appreciated.”
“I suppose you’ll do,” Pepper concedes when Tony finally turns to her, fully dressed down to the cufflinks in clothing she’d laid out for him. She eyes him critically for another minute, then shrugs. “Yes, you’ll do.
“There’s blueberry in there for you,” Steve tells Tony, who is still leaning against the far counter, a coffee mug in one hand and a slightly bemused expression on his face.
When Steve stumbles out into the kitchen after jerking awake from another nightmare about the war, he finds Tony already there, tapping arrhythmically against the counter while he waits for coffee to percolate.
Pepper side-eyes him. “The board will be in favor. Captain Rogers is a stabilizing influence, apparently. Can only be good for stocks and for the company itself. That’s probably going to be the general opinion, actually. They’ll chalk your recent better behavior up to him.”
The kitchen is empty when he gets there, but he’s left bagels on the counter the last two mornings, and they’ve vanished by lunchtime, so he figures someone has to be eating them. Probably several someones.
“Right,” he says softly. “Right.” This is home. For now. He takes another deep breath, trying to fix the thought in his mind, and pushes himself up. “Lights,” he tells himself, needing the directive, and gropes for the lamp next to the bed. It flares to life before he can make contact and he jerks back. “What the hell?”
of pretending he’s pretending, and he just. He would just like, just for a bit, to pretend everything’s real, not in a for-the-cameras way, but for himself. If he’s going to be royally fucked up anyway – and he has no delusions about what the situation is doing for his sanity – he may as well let himself have this. Steve is
“Great. The GranCabrio was ready, you said? Let’s build an engine.” Tony leaves his unfinished drink on the bar and heads for the elevator. He figures he can get in at least a couple solid hours in the workshop before he has to go hold hands and play nice for the cameras. Thinking about something that is not Steve Rogers sounds like a fantastic idea right now.
Steve hesitates for a moment, clearly on the verge of saying something, and Tony braces for it. But when Steve speaks, all he says is, “Tea is better for nightmares than coffee, I’ve found. Non-caffeinated tea. Helps me warm up and calm down, instead of feeding the adrenaline.”
This might be one of those times when he needs to at least try to sleep, though, if his inability to muster any surprise at the giant blond demi-god sitting at his breakfast bar is any indication.
“Right,” Tony says cheerfully. “Well, we should go. I don’t really –” he twiddles his fingers in the direction of the action “– sports, so much, clearly, but SI has a box at the Garden, and a couple glass seats, I think, so we should go. I think you’d fit right in.”
“Hockey,” Tony says again. “A lot of you-shaped men on knife-shoes hitting a flattened ball with sticks.”
Tony rolls his eyes, but goes to follow her orders, wondering if he can handle actually asking Steve about it outright, or if he needs to just continue to keep his mouth shut and wait for impact.
Steve snorts. “It was supposed to just be the two of us with Sitwell running comms. They’ve got a team of five on it, now.”
Rhodey grins back at him. “I may need the suit, but you’ve shined her up pretty good. I think I could take him.”
“Tony, you need to change,” Pepper picks her way across the floor towards him, avoiding an ankle-high pyramid of nuts of varying gages, half a Ducati engine, Dummy, and two circuit boards with the ease of long practice.
“Fine. Sorry. I just. Was thinking.” Steve picks up a piece of bread and starts spreading butter on it, just to have something to do with his hands.
Pepper says something, probably introducing the woman, and Tony nods, but he’s still watching Steve, can’t seem to not, stuck somewhere between
“You keep doing that,” he says, and is surprised at how angry it sounds. “Are you waiting for an invitation?”
Steve eyes him like he doesn’t understand. “The team is falling apart,” he says, and now Tony isn’t sure if he actually didn’t understand, or if he’s being deliberately obtuse. “I thought maybe working together again would bring us back together as a team. Things seemed better, finding the scepter, going after it, the party when we got back. But what’s happening now is only making it more obvious that none of us trust each other. Clint’s family.” He waves a hand as if to encompass the house around them. “None of us even knew.”
“I didn’t mean he couldn’t use it,” Pepper says carefully. “I know you put a lot of time and thought into –”
He’s not sure if Tony’s changed, or he has, or if he’s just seeing a new side of the other man, but the whole thing has him off-balance. It doesn’t help that Tony is so aware and helpful at these swanky events, and on all of their fake dates, and then turns around to become the infuriating asshole Steve first met. They still work well together in the field, but Tony’s somehow less willing to follow orders, and Steve is tired of being mocked.
It should be disconcerting, seeing so much of Steve in Tony’s private space. They’ve been living together for a couple months, now, and Tony’s barely seen Steve inside what is now
Steve claps a hand down on top of Tony’s, then carefully peels his fingers away, turning his hand over to hold. It’s not ideal, but better than the alternative. Tony shoots him a surprised look that quickly turns back into a fake smile.
“I could maybe get the gang together, set up a mission, Operation Save the Puppies, but then we’d have to know who’s killing the puppies, and there aren’t actually any puppies in need of saving. I mean, there are, of course, puppies in need of saving, all the time, I’ve seen the ads, but there are no specific puppies being targeted at this moment in time, at least that I’m aware of. What I mean is –”
Coulson clears his throat. “The general public consensus is that the primary reason behind Captain America and Iron Man’s altercations is Tony Stark’s fluid sexuality. It has been assumed that given the mores of the times in which you were raised, you are less than supportive of same-sex relationships.”
The issue with Tony getting too comfortable with how agreeable Steve’s been is that he stops being careful and does stupid things – like suggesting mid-cup of coffee that they go out. Steve had just kind of stared at him over his bacon, and Tony had managed to backtrack quickly, say that Pepper thought they should do something more like a casual date than the fancy events and dinners they’ve been working with. And then, because Tony can’t always control his mouth when he’s nervous and trying to explain things, he’d blurted out that they should go to the Met, because Steve likes art, and Tony was already thinking of Pepper, who also likes art, and then he’d wanted to kick himself, because
“I mean,” Tony says slowly, “That regular everyday garden variety city rats are being,” he scrambles for a word, “
He thanks Jarvis, and takes the elevator down, steadies himself against the drop. Outside, the light is a little less brilliant at street level than it was in the penthouse, the sun partially obscured by the buildings, but it’s still a beautiful day, the sidewalks busy in spite of the early hour.
“Not sure,” Tony admits as he starts walking down the hallway. “SHIELD doesn’t put anything other than the danger level in their call-outs. Apparently, it causes too much confusion, given some of the weird things that crop up. So we’re not dealing with another invading army, but it’s not a bank heist, either.”
“Roughly the size of a full-grown Saint Bernard.” Jarvis sounds a little stiff, but it’s possible Steve’s imagining it. If not, he’ll figure out what he’s supposed to do about it later.
Point. “Stay here, keep an eye on the screens. Stay on comms, we’ll yell if anything gets above ground.”
“What, like you’ve used yours?” what Tony can see of Steve’s face has flushed in a way it only ever does when he’s furious. “To create sycophants incapable of telling you ‘no’?”
“Yes, Raisin Bran?” Tony eyes the tie, and then rips the whole thing off again, barely restraining himself from throwing it on the ground and stomping on it.
“Tired, Cap?” Tony slouches against the wall by the door, somehow managing to make it look like the wall’s sole purpose for existing is to support his weight, and it should be proud to do so.
Steve can’t miss the threat in her words, and he’s not sure what exactly she thinks he’s going to do – or what he even
And that was apparently the wrong thing to say, because Steve’s coming straight at Tony now, shaking the book he’s still holding in Tony’s face like an overlarge finger. “What gave you the right to sell off my things without asking?”
Steve can’t help the slight smile that quirks his mouth, turns back to the windows as if that would help hide it.
, and then he remembers. Stark Tower. He’s in Tony’s penthouse apartment in Stark Tower. The meeting, the move, the dinner date, relaxing for once to friendly jokes instead of bracing for harsh jibes, walking out of the restaurant with the barest pressure of Tony’s fingers against the small of his back, the flashbulbs going off in their faces before they even hit the pavement.
Tony barely hesitates before taking the Spyder, and if he doesn’t speed quite as much as he usually does, he’s just being safety conscious, not dawdling. He has no reason to dawdle. It’s just a date. It’s not even a
Feeling a little warmer under the collar than he’d like, Tony swallows roughly, himself. “You, too,” he says, wants to reach out and touch, because Christ on a cracker does Steve look good, but isn’t sure that’s allowed. He firmly tucks his hands into his pockets to keep them out of trouble.
“Probably,” Pepper agrees easily. “You still should have been there.” She waves the tablet at him. “Instead, we’ll do this, and then I’ll let you be a genius until it’s time to get ready for your date. Which
“Where are we going?” Steve asks once they’re in a slightly quieter corridor off the main hall, letting Tony tug him along.
Tony nods automatically for a moment, then looks away, takes a deep breath of his own, and looks back, meets her eyes. “I appreciate it,” he tells her. “I do. But I can do this. It’s a teenage celebrity crush that’s gotten a little out of hand, what with a couple decades of compound interest and then actually meeting the man. And it may be – it may have
The last several days have been quiet, no call outs or fancy events, but Tony has seen Steve every day regardless. It’s not that Steve has been seeking Tony out – at least, Tony doesn’t have any reason to think he has, since it’s not like he’s started wandering into Tony’s SI office, or the workshop – but if he’d been avoiding Tony before, he’s certainly not anymore.
Rhodey hangs out with him until Thursday night, which is pretty awesome of him. Tony doesn’t think he’s seen him this many days in a row since they were at MIT. It makes a nice change to have someone to eat with, and chew over armor upgrades while they chew on takeout. Tony even deigns to actually make some of the upgrades to the War Machine armor himself, instead of just talking about them. He usually stays out of it, since the military has been so grabby about it, but it’s
Mr. Cooper chuckles. “I do,” he agrees, “That’s why I’m a little surprised you didn’t have anything excessive planned.”
Coulson looks up at their entrance and his face does the twitchy thing Tony’s learning means he’s smiling. “Ms. Potts,” he says. “A pleasure as always to see you.”
After what might be hours or might be just a few more moments, Steve pulls away, just enough, breathes, “Ready?” across Tony’s lips.
Coulson clears his throat in a way that should be unassuming, but somehow makes everyone sit up and turn to him. “Thank you,” he says, once he has everyone’s attention. “We’ll try to make this as quick and painless as possible, and then you can return to your regularly scheduled morning pursuits.”
Steve had been under the impression Ms. Potts and Tony weren’t a couple any longer, but some of the things he’s seen today would imply otherwise.
“Yes, that,” Tony agrees, and he hopes that Natasha knows that even if he can’t see her, she’s his favorite right now. “But they’re not. Being expanded, or whatever, and sent here. They’re being brought here, and then blown up. Expanded. Made bigger.”
Tony spends most of the next few days in his workshop. He has a conference call he can’t get out of late Thursday afternoon, but he can get away with audio only, so he doesn’t even have to change, or try to cover up his bruising. He’s not
“Nothing,” Steve shrugs, realizes he’s holding his pants like they’ll fall down if he lets go, and buttons them, rolling his eyes. “Nothing serious, anyway. Just wondering why this place feels so. So
“Anything but that,” Steve says, dry as he can, and gestures for Tony to lead the way out of the park.
“Not the point,” is Barton’s tart rejoinder, but the alligators have noticed them, and things get ugly fast.
“I’m not hoping to get anything out of this!” Tony all but explodes, can’t quite contain it any longer, somehow manages not to yank his hand out of Rhodey’s grip. “This wasn’t my idea! It wasn’t even
“Anywhere in particular you’d like us to start?” the female agent who’d spoken downstairs asks. Steve figures he should probably ask her name.
Twice Steve opens his mouth to ask why Tony isn’t putting up more of a fuss about this, and stops himself both times. He wonders if maybe he’s not the only one feeling a little trapped, but it’s so odd to think of Tony, of all people, feeling trapped by having a lot of people around, given his life, that Steve has to shut that train of thought down. Something to think about another time, when he isn’t already feeling like his head might explode.
Tony gets both hands in Steve’s hair, holds him close. Steve has one hand high on Tony’s shoulder, sliding higher, thumb sweeping the soft skin under Tony’s jaw, tilting Tony’s head where he wants it. The hand he’d had over Tony’s heart has slipped down and around to the small of Tony’s back, pulling him in.
“Right,” Tony nods a bit. “Well. Thanks for that.” He’s not entirely sure what the appropriate response is at this juncture. “Look, you know this isn’t a real marriage, right?” he asks, because that’s probably the important thing, here, and maybe that will nip talk of the depth of his attachment in the bud. “Fury and Coulson set it up with Pepper to fix the Avengers’ image.”
Rhodes makes an irritated noise, then reaches out and wraps an arm across Tony’s chest, tugging him away with the grating sound of metal on metal. “Why don’t you go handle the press, Tones?” he suggests. “They’re piling up at the barrier SHIELD’s put up by Columbus Circle.”
Steve shakes his head. “No. But it’s different now. Comforting, I guess. Something to do with my hands. I don’t even know what I’m drawing half the time. It’s like running, I guess. Good way to clear the mind.”
The thoughts keep tumbling over in Steve’s head, though, while he brushes his teeth and changes for bed. He barely notices how hot the water is until it almost scalds him, or when it goes straight to freezing when he automatically turns it cooler.
Not that he’d use it as a selling point, but dinner and a walk in the park tends to lead to other things for the benefit of the various less-than-stealth photographers that follow them around, and the random passersby who also like to take less-than-stealthy pictures to post on the internet. And whatever else he may be, Tony really is a very good kisser, and Steve would be lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying that aspect of things almost as much as he’s enjoyed going to museums and art shows. He doesn’t want to overdo it, or make Tony uncomfortable, of course, but he likes wrapping an arm around Tony’s shoulders, or holding hands over tables or between chairs. He likes kissing his hair or cheek when they’re standing around talking to people he doesn’t want to talk to, or in greeting, or when one of them wanders off. There’s something comfortable about it, something settling, and Steve hadn’t realized how much he’d wanted that kind of casual contact until he had it. Steve also really likes kissing Tony properly on the mouth, though, which is far from settling, but also something he hadn’t realized was something he was missing. He’s careful about initiating, isn’t sure how much Tony is actually interested and how much is just play-acting for the world at large, but sometimes Tony
“Ask Cap?” he suggests. “I don’t know that he’s made all that many friends in the here and now. Guy doesn’t get out much, unless he’s hitting things. He might like it if you, you know, stood up with him.”
“There’s an apartment for you downstairs,” Tony tells him, figuring if Thor wanted pleasantries he could have waited until daylight hours.
“Didn’t we already go over this?” Tony asks, keeps his tone casual, face blank, turns back towards his work table just in case.
Tony smiles beatifically at him. “Everything okay, honey?” he asks, louder now. “They didn’t leave a pin in your suit, did they? I’ll have to have a word with my tailor,” he adds to the couple who have somehow materialized in front of them. “Third time this month they’ve left pins in. Do you think they’re trying to make a statement?” His thumb is now rubbing gentle circles over the spot he abused. It’s distracting.
“Yeah, well, it’s a nice couch,” Steve says, and feels that warmth again when Tony’s lips quirk into a grin. He untangles their feet and pushes up to stand. “I’m going to take advantage and try to get some sleep,” he says. “You should maybe think about doing the same?”
It’s crossed over from late to early, though there’s still the sporadic crack and crackle of fireworks somewhere, when there’s a soft tap on Steve’s door and Tony pokes his head in. He’s still dressed in the suit and jacket he’d worn out, though he seems to have lost his tie somewhere, and the top few buttons on his shirt are open, leaving his neck bare.
Just as Tony’s decided to start being obvious about yawning so he can beg off and go to his room – he really is tired – Natasha swings her legs over his lap, effectively pinning him in place. Startled, Tony turns to her, mouth open to say he was just going to go anyway, she can have the couch back, but she’s not even looking at him, fully engrossed in the film. Something warm settles in Tony’s stomach, and he lets himself sink further into the couch
“Tony, hey, stay with me,” Steve’s hands are back on his shoulders, warm and steady. Tony catches at his wrists and clutches, fingertips pressing into bare skin. “You’re having a panic attack,” Steve tells him, voice low and careful.
“As far as anyone knows, you were trying to keep it quiet before,” Pepper had reminded them on their way to the gallery where the event is being held. “But now that you’ve gone public, there’s really no need for that sort of thing, so you will be attending a lot of these events, and going on dates where everyone can see you, and you will do it cheerfully and adorably
Eventually, Steve groans and hauls himself up and away. Tony can’t help the slight wince when Steve pulls out, but it’s mostly just discomfort. There’s the pad of bare feet across the carpet, and Tony turns to watch Steve disappear into the bathroom. There’s the sound of running water, and then Steve’s back with a washcloth. Tony can see the red imprint of the arc reactor on his chest. It makes something hot turn over in his stomach, even now.
“I was busy, okay,” Tony snaps. “I had meetings with R&D, and Rhodey was here, and Bruce needed help with a thing, and it’s not like Steve was ever around when I
“I don’t –” Steve starts, tries to pull his thoughts back together. Tony’s got one hand hooked into the open front of Steve’s jacket, the backs of his knuckles just grazing the front of Steve’s shirt underneath, and Steve is suddenly very aware of that almost-there contact.
“It’s a pre-nup.” At Steve’s blank look, Ms. Potts continues. “A pre-nuptial agreement? It’s to protect the private assets of individuals acquired prior to a marriage. Not particularly romantic, and I’m not generally a fan of them for a variety of reasons, but this isn’t a real marriage, and – no offense meant – we can’t risk the company. It’s really nothing personal, but this isn’t intended to last long-term, and there are too many people dependent on Stark Industries to chance a lawsuit tearing it apart.”
Steve takes a breath, lets it out. “Nothing, Jarvis,” he says after a moment. “Just concern for a – for a teammate.” He stands and heads out towards the elevators. “Would he eat a bagel if I brought one back for him, do you think?”
do this, you need to tell me. You can lie to everyone else if you want to, but I know you, and I know what this must be costing you. No one will judge you if you –”
“That’s you done, as well,” Dan-the-makeup-artist says, tucking the last of the ever-mysterious makeup bottles into a case.
“Yes, yes,” she says. “We all know the press has never respected anyone’s privacy, especially yours, and is unlikely to start now.
That wasn’t exactly the direction Steve was expecting the interview to go in, but he’ll take it. He’d certainly rather talk about the programs he’s been working with in his free time than their fake Valentine’s Day celebrations, or what they’re expecting to do later for their anniversary – he can’t even wrap his head around the fact that it’s already been a month – even though he knows they won’t get out of the interview without it coming up. For now, it helps him settle from the earlier pitfalls, and he can feel himself relaxing as he talks about the kids he works with in one program, how he’d heard about them through one of the agents at SHIELD.
Barton and Natasha appear out of the elevator as Tony touches down, and Jarvis opens the ramp onto the quinjet.
Then he pushes the last door open, flips the master switch, and stops dead. It’s an art studio, big and open, brilliantly lit from the banks of lights overhead and along the walls. Steve can guess it would be just as brilliant during the day, with no artificial lighting at all, just the sun through the walls of windows. There are draft tables and easels, neatly labeled cabinets and drawers. Steve gets his feet moving, and realizes the studio has been fully stocked: paints, inks, pens, colored pencils, and brushes of all sizes.
“Get our things together?” Steve’s starting to feel like a broken record. He looks over at Tony, whose eyes are fixed on his phone again, fingers moving rapidly. He turns back to Coulson.
Coulson and the food both gone, the meeting breaks up, everyone piling their dishes in the sink. Banner takes his tea with him, Clint grabs the last bagel, and they both wander towards the elevator.
Tony turns back, smile easing again. “It’s a work in progress, but I can’t say I mind the effort. You know I like a good cause.”
It’s nice just walking with Tony, oddly enough. They don’t talk, but it doesn’t feel uncomfortable, more like a silence between friends than between two people forced to be out together. Steve had thought, for a while, that maybe this was where they were headed, a comfortable friendship, rather than a sometimes-strained working partnership. Over the last couple days, he hasn’t been sure if their current situation would destroy any progress they’d made, or help it move along faster. He’s hoping for the latter, but he hasn’t been holding his breath. Until now, he wasn’t even sure Tony knew how to be quiet – he’d swear the other man
Tony gives the screwdriver a final twist and runs the pad of his thumb over the screw to make sure it’s all the way in, contemplates pulling out a blowtorch and maybe doing some welding to make his mind stop running a slideshow of Steve with the various women always flocking around him at society functions.
pay attention, but a bigger part of him is too busy being glad Steve hasn’t noticed how weird Tony’s been. The rest of him is just quietly thrilled that they can get along like this at all, that they haven’t somehow managed to get in a fight.
Somewhere in the background Steve registers the sound of footsteps. Someone gasps. Multiple someones titter. The footsteps rapidly retreat the way they’d come.
“Jarvis said you like blueberries.” Steve isn’t quite sure why he’s feeling defensive, why Tony can get under his skin without even saying anything, but he doesn’t much like the feeling.
He just needs to look at this in a different light, Steve thinks, smiles a little under his fingers. He’s an artist, he can do that.
“I thank you again, my friend,” Thor beams a little brighter, and then wanders out towards the elevator.
“I suppose,” Steve hedges. He thinks they should probably talk, figure out what they need to be doing on their end, maybe, if anything needs doing that hasn’t already been planned out for them, maybe set some ground rules for sharing the apartment, private space.
Fury tilts his head, considering. “In this business, you are close with everyone, and you are close with no one.”
Agent Godfrey is calmly directing the packing of Steve’s life into neatly labeled brown boxes when Steve comes out of his bedroom.
“Irreconcilable differences,” Tony says shortly. He looks pointedly between Ms. Potts and Coulson. “Can we wrap this up? I was in the middle of something downstairs. Several somethings, in fact.”
“It’ll be okay,” Steve says, voice still level, still oddly gentle, but there’s something tight about it.
“Nice to see you, Tony,” Tony says, and gets three unimpressed looks for his trouble. “Just finishing the rounds,” he tells them breezily, and pulls out a chair. “Ms. Potts,” he says, and grins sunnily at Pepper.
“I meant,” Steve says slowly, like he’s trying to be very careful with his words, like he knows how thin the ice is right now, “that I wasn’t doing anything that was worthwhile. There are plenty of things that are important, that are necessary – I know Stark Industries does a lot of good in the world – but I didn’t have anything else. I
Everything, Tony wants to say, anything. “Fuck me,” he says, because he doesn’t know if everything is on the table, and he
,” Tony bites out. “It was theoretical. And incomplete. What happened shouldn’t have been possible. And you’re a goddamned hypocrite to tell anyone off for experimenting,
“That would be good,” Steve admits, after what might be too long a pause, but Tony doesn’t call him on that, either, and Steve watches as his shoulders drop half an inch, like he’d been tensed for another response entirely.
“Sir is partial to blueberries,” Jarvis replies. He sounds a little stiff, but Steve can never quite be sure if he’s imagining things like that, or if maybe it’s the accent.
It’s short work to get through the crowds. Heads turn to watch them go, but no one stops them. “Walk with purpose, and don’t make eye contact,” Tony has said more than once, and it never fails to surprise Steve how well it works.
It’s Tony’s turn to shrug. “We were both yelling in public. Sure he started it, but it’s not like I don’t know better. And I said some pretty uncalled for things – you heard it.” Tony can’t help but wince, still feels like an ass for what he said, and even worse that everyone else had to hear him say it. “Don’t think I didn’t notice you avoiding the question.”
Steve continues to stand in the middle of the kitchen for several long moments, alone, staring at the pile of plates in the sink, trying to figure out what on earth just happened.
Tony eyes her. Now he’s wondering what else she’s talked to Steve about. “This would be sometime in the last two days,” is what he eventually goes with. “After the thing with the alligators. Before breakfast this morning.”
“I feel silly calling it a mission,” she admits, “and I don’t know – nor do I want to know – enough to be more specific.” She shrugs. “‘SHIELD thing’ seemed like a good idea in my head.”
“I’ll show you mine if you show me yours,” Tony offers, half convinced that’s a sure way to get Steve to drop it, half sure it’s the only way to get Steve to talk, and fully aware both of them coming clean is the best option for the team, and the world as a whole. Which feels a little egotistical, but probably isn’t far from the truth.
Pepper sighs. “If you can’t do this – no,” she holds up a hand before Tony can even open his mouth, “don’t interrupt. And don’t just brush this off. If you
“Nothing,” Tony nips Steve’s bottom lip, kisses him again. “Just,” he tugs the waistband of the pants as he speaks between kisses. “Where did Clint get these?”
Steve sets the empty kettle on the back of the stove to cool and turns to look at Tony. He’s getting the feeling there’s something else Tony’s really asking, but he’s still too fuzzy to work it out. “Sometimes,” he says, eventually, carefully. “I guess I haven’t really thought of it like that. Mostly they just make me sad, after, if I can forget the rest of it long enough to think about them.
“Sleep with, have sex with, do the horizontal tango, whatever you want to call it,” Tony’s gesturing with his hands, but Steve’s pretty sure the motions don’t actually mean anything. “Regardless, just get that signed, and everything will be just swell.”
’m taking?” and there goes Tony’s bet about wanting to crack Steve right in the face. It’s extra infuriating that Steve is exceptionally stunning when he’s angry. “When’s the last time you paid for anything you ate? Rent? Heat? You live in my Tower, eat my food, use my tech. Even the ugly damn clothes on your back are clothes I paid for. You had nothing when you came out of the ice, and you’ve got nothing now, so don’t you dare talk about what
“And how often does Stark show up where and when he’s told?” Fury asks rhetorically. “He’s a stubborn piece of work, and you’re no better, that’s what got us here. So forgive me if I don’t just assume you’ll be able to smile at a few cameras and everything will be coming up roses.”
“I was rooting for you two crazy kids from the start,” Clint puts in, and then jerks, slams his knee on the underside of the table. “The hell, Nat?” he swears, rubbing at his knee.
Steve’s scowl deepens. “You know the Rangers took the Garden from the Amerks,” he says, and this is clearly a grave treachery, but Tony only understood the first half of it.
“Seems to me it’s being handled,” Steve says. “We just show up where and when we’re told and look happy to be there. Nothing too new about that. For either of us.”
“– so you are just going to have to deal with it,” Pepper says over him. “Look,” she says, softer, “I’m on your side, here, if there are any sides to be on. This isn’t what I would wish for you. Maybe if we hadn’t –”
“Yours,” Steve doesn’t hesitate, pulls Tony inside the elevator, and backs him against the wall. “Penthouse, Jarvis,” he says, and he’s close enough again that Tony can feel the vibration through his chest.
Thor grins broadly. “I had heard as much,” he replies, voice somehow managing to be a quiet boom, perhaps out of respect for the late hour. “I thank you for it.”
“Furniture, sometimes. Cityscapes. Did a course on nudes, once,” he adds thoughtfully, and Tony almost chokes on his sip of wine. Steve smirks. “That sort of thing.”
Tony glances at his phone as it buzzes in his hand with the upload. “Great,” he mutters, and shoves the phone into a pocket. He holds out his arms, letting the suit wrap around him, relaxing into it, and calls the coordinates up on the HUD. “Where are all our brave little soldiers?”
It’s Steve’s turn to laugh against Tony’s mouth. “I didn’t want to ask,” he admits, pulling back just enough that they can look at each other, and his expression turns serious. “What is this?”
get out for a bit, it’s a fair bet Tony and I will kill each other, and I’m pretty sure the words ‘connubial bliss’ will
“You can’t wear khaki and plaid anymore, you look like Pepper’s father.” Which is not at all how Tony meant to say that.
The tunnels are dark and wet, and Tony assumes they smell pretty rank, given Barton shares several times that the smell is making him gag, and Natasha tells him each time to shut up, he’s making it worse. Tony tries not to be smug about having his own air supply, but mostly he just manages to be smug silently. He figures that’s progress.
That’s a bit of luck. “Has she been there long?” Tony’s already changing into clothes more suited for working out.
“I’m trying to be less of a dick,” Tony tries not to snap. “But it’s not like there’s much to work with.”
“I do not agree with the senseless killing of beasts that are clearly not acting of their own volition,” Thor announces from somewhere – Steve assumes from the center of the lightning flickering near the perimeter, which is where he’s supposed to be. “But I will say stunning the creatures does not seem be working as one might hope, nor will they listen to reason.”
“Is Tony awake, yet?” Steve asks while he dresses, thinks maybe he could grab some bagels for them on his way back. He didn’t see much in the way of breakfast foods when he explored the kitchen the evening before.
Steve looks down automatically, even though he knows what the picture is, and realizes Fury’s finger is touching the small figure rising from the landing pad, captured in flight and surprisingly detailed given Steve doesn’t remember adding it in.
“Don’t stop, and don’t talk to anyone,” Tony says, reaching up with his free hand to adjust Steve’s tie, as if that had been what they were talking about the whole time.
Coulson taps the table. “An engagement won’t work,” he says. “It will have to be an actual marriage.”
T-minus no hours, and Tony is pointedly not thinking about what he’s getting himself into. That way lies madness, though a distinct lack of panic, which is just as concerning as the alternative. This is marriage, and domesticity, and
“I’d hoped to,” Steve says, doesn’t sound like he’s taking Tony’s word at anything but face value. It’s. Nice. “It’s what I went to school for. Not really the best way to make a living, especially then, but. I loved it.”
For a few seconds, Tony thinks about telling her no, he’ll see her when Rhodey sends his report, but he does owe her, and the look she’s giving him now tells him not to try it. “I’ll just finish up with this, then,” he promises, gestures at the holographs he was working on before she came in.
Halfway through a meeting on quarterly projections, Tony’s phone goes off. The speaker stops awkwardly as everyone swings around to stare.
“Remind me to take you to a hockey game this winter,” he says after Steve lets out a particularly wild string of curses at the home plate umpire.
might know that,” Pepper rolls her eyes, “but no one else does. And unless you want to launch the ‘Is Stark Cheating Already!?’ stories barely over a month in, and drag your ex along with you, you’ll need to lock it down.”
Ms. Potts eyes him for a moment, hands going still against her tablet, and Steve hadn’t even realized she’d been tapping it until she stops. It’s possible he’s spent so much time around Tony at this point he’s been desensitized to incessant fidgeting. “I don’t think we’ve really had a moment alone to talk before,” she says, and she sounds oddly formal. She also hasn’t clarified why it’s a problem for Tony to go to dinner.
“What?” Tony manages not to choke on the single syllable. He has no idea what he looks like, but Steve spreads his hands, wide and empty, palms out, in the air between them.
. “Of course not,” he says, and Steve feels instantly deflated, and then the punch to the gut – “An NDA would never cover it on my end, not with my reputation. It’d get out somehow. I have strict instructions for meditation only.” Steve does not need the accompanying hand gesture to that, he gets the metaphor just fine, thanks. “So it’s just you and me, Buttercup, playing the audience until they get bored and everyone can move on. But you should get out there, sow your wild oats, live the dream, take home a different brunette, give a blonde or a redhead a try – though if you mess with Pepper or Natasha I will not be held responsible for the consequences.”
“Everyone already knows you won’t take direction, and you can’t stop your mouth,” Clint points out. “Too bad we
“You are actually planning on going through with this,” it’s not a question, and Tony doesn’t even bother to dignify Rhodey with a look, just tips his chin up a bit higher as he fights with his bow tie. The damn thing won’t cooperate, and it’s got nothing to do with the fact that he can feel the way his hands want to shake.
, and Tony will be damned if he lets his best friend fly anything that isn’t as safe as he can make it. It doesn’t have all the bells and whistles the suits he’s making for himself have these days, but Rhodey’s not much for bells and whistles unless they look like rocket launchers. Tony blames the army. Sucks all the fun right out of a person.
Steve gives her a wry smile. “Ma’am.” He nods at the other agents as they stand. “Thank you for waiting.” Most of them are trying to suppress grins, and Steve appreciates that they did wait, instead of just waltzing into his apartment without him. He holds no delusions that his otherwise-secure home is locked to SHIELD.
“Spoilsport,” Natasha’s voice is accompanied by the crackle of electricity from one of the new stings she’s testing out, and she’s briefly lit by blue sparks.
“Jarvis could have told me that,” Tony points out. He takes his hand away from his head and inspects it.
after their debrief, not quite sure if he’d even need a best man for their charade of a wedding. “And I’m not sure what else I’d need. Ms. Potts and Agent Coulson seem to have everything else in hand.”
“I thought I already was,” he replies. Something loosens, just a tiny bit, when Tony’s focus settles on him more firmly at that, so he keeps going. “Things could get pretty raunchy, especially nights when we were wound up. As often as not, it’d turn into everyone trying to outdo each other. Still not sure if half of it was true,” Steve shakes his head at some of the things he remembers, “Still not sure some of it was physically possible. But it was all for fun. A couple of them had girls back home, but it was never them they talked about, not those nights. Certainly not their pictures that got passed around.”
Rhodey, looking a little stricken, releases Tony’s hand – cufflinks firmly in place – and puts both of his on Tony’s shoulders. “Tones, I’m sorry, I’m just trying to look out for you, you know that, right?”
“Darling,” Tony says, grin somewhere between natural and paparazzi-ready, “this was better than three dinner dates. We’ve earned ourselves a night in.”
The view is breathtaking. It’s not awe-inspiring like some of the things he’s seen – the Alps, the Grand Canyon, deserts and oceans as far as the eye can see – but this, this manmade mess, it’s home, and from this high up, he can see all of it, the shining spires and the shadows holding them up.
“True,” he admits. “It’s why we’re in this situation to begin with. But maybe it doesn’t have to be terrible? We work well together in the field, most of the time. You know we do.”
“I mean it, Tony,” Pepper’s glare intensifies. “If I find out you’ve ended up in a hot tub with triplets –”
There’s a pause that is probably only a second or two, but feels far longer and full of computerized judgment. “Alerting Sir to your presence, Captain,” is what Jarvis finally says, and a moment later one of the panels of glass swings outwards, accompanied by a wall of noise.
For a second, Tony thinks Steve might actually haul off and hit him, but he just steps back, expression still furious, but colder now. “Clearly such a hardship for you. Remind me to thank whoever pried your wallet loose from your fingers, but it isn’t necessary. I can pay my own way. I wouldn’t want any
Steve yanks his gloves on with a little more force than necessary. “Good of him to make those decisions,” he snaps, then wishes he’d bit his tongue. This is not the time for him to get all twisted up over who’s calling the shots. Tony likely has more information that Steve does. “How big
“Little busy here, Cap,” Tony bites out, and Steve looks up just in time to see him punch a pigeon in the head with one gauntleted fist.
It’s been five days since the fight with the alligators in the sewers, since Steve first saw his apartment, since Coulson sent him Tony’s file. Four days since Natasha cornered him while he was looking for Tony, and gave him another cold shower of information. Three since he finally found Tony in the kitchen eating breakfast and tried to apologize and was summarily brushed off. They’ve been okay since then, so maybe Tony was right, maybe apologies weren’t necessary. But Steve still feels a little off, wishes Tony would have let him apologize properly, because Tony apologized – Tony apologized to
If the bright red of Tony’s mouth as he quirks another grin still makes Steve want to kiss him again, well, there will be opportunities later, he’s sure.
“I monitor everyone and everything in the tower, as is my directive,” Jarvis says primly. “I mentioned it merely because it seemed relevant to your current welfare, which is my prime directive.”
Tony takes a moment to button his shirt and fiddle with his cufflinks. “He won’t touch anything, it’s fine,” he says eventually.
“What?” Steve stops when Tony does, eyes quickly scanning the scattered people around them, the trees, the monument.
Tony’s in the workshop when the pictures hit the internet. The notification chimes softly to indicate a new reference to Tony Stark in the media, followed immediately by another for images. Through the haze of Neon Knights and intense focus, Tony recognizes the alerts and categorically ignores them as unimportant until Pepper tells him otherwise.
“I’ve got an idea to get us some breathing room if you want to actually see this exhibit.” Tony’s breath is warm on the side of Steve’s face. To anyone else, it probably looks like Tony’s brushing a kiss to his cheek. “You game?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve says again. He has faced down actual armies, and yet it is this immaculately dressed civilian businesswoman that unnerves him. He is unsurprised.
“Is that why I’m here?” Clint takes a bite of a bagel he’s already slathered liberally with cream cheese.
Steve can’t dispute that. Natasha verbally tearing into Fury when he’d finally told them Coulson was alive and more-or-less well had been a thing of beauty. “Let me know what Ms. Potts says?” he asks. “Or Natasha?”
Pepper pats him on the shoulder. “You were doomed when you made me CEO,” she tells him confidentially. “You just haven’t seemed to pick up on it, yet.” Tony figures she’s probably right, and waves her off before tossing the metal scrap back on the table and turning back to the prosthetic he had been trying to adjust when she came in.
Tony scans the tunnel. “Fleeing back into the walls, or wherever they came from,” he says. “Normal sized, seems like. For New York, anyway. J, Bruce, anything?”
“I should hope not,” is Coulson’s shockingly tart rejoinder. “Review those files, Captain, and don’t forget your after-action report.”
“Sir believes it is the most expedient mode of transportation at this moment,” Jarvis responds. “And given the size of the birds, and their aerial nature, he feels the jet may prove useful.”
“The curtains are fine,” Steve answers. “And the lamp.” He slides out of bed and pads over to the windows, tugs the curtains back.
“How much longer until we go on?” Steve knows his voice is too loud, but he feels justified when it brings Tony’s head around to hear the answer.
By the time SHIELD has finished clearing the scene, and Coulson has called them back in for a useless – though thankfully short – debrief and then released them again, it’s late afternoon. Steve is feeling pretty drained – not physically so much, but they’d had to deal with clamoring reporters and
It takes three reminders from Jarvis and two only-semi-irate phone calls from Pepper to get Tony out of the workshop the next morning with strict instructions to shower before showing up to the lunch meeting he’s
“He –” Steve stops, tells himself firmly this is an olive branch, not an attack. “Yes,” he says, instead. “We had a mission, but, given the situation, they’re sending another team.”
A woman in a headset sweeps in, and, before Steve can blink, she herds him and Tony out of their chairs, out of the greenroom, and out towards the soundstage. She hovers as Mr. Cooper greets them – a handshake for Steve and a back-clapping embrace for Tony, which makes Steve grit his teeth all over again – and then points out the cameras, checks the microphones clipped to their shirts, and makes herself scarce.
Tony turns back to Coulson, ignoring the odd look Rogers is now giving him. “Anything else, oh great one?” he asks. “Ms. Potts will make sure Jarvis has an updated calendar, complete with instructions on hand-holding for the cameras, and he’ll make sure the Stone Soldier gets all my plus-ones.”
was poking fun, might try to turn it into a grand gesture to cover, buy an elaborate frame and have an unveiling party or something. Or maybe he’d hang it in his workshop and say he was using it for target practice, hide something sweet behind a joke.
It’s an interview, an online magazine, a reporter Tony doesn’t know, doesn’t think he knows, and Trent. Short simple questions, and Trent waxing poetic about their relationship, the year they’d spent together, how in love they’d been, the secret trips, expensive getaways, private moments. It somehow manages to gloss over the end, just says Tony had become distant, ignoring Trent, and Trent couldn’t handle never knowing where Tony was, who he was with, when it was all over the society pages how Tony was seen with a different woman on his arm every night. It says nothing about the company secrets Trent had been trying to steal, the sealed lawsuit, the fifteen years he’d spent in prison.
you both have shit to deal with, and can’t manage to do it in private. So I just wanted to put it out there again. It’s all on
“You and I will sign at the end,” Ms. Potts tells him. “And Natasha will notarize it. Then I’ll get it back to the legal team to file.”
For a long beat, Steve just stares at him, and then he chokes, but no, he’s not choking, he’s laughing, trying not to, both hands over his mouth like he can hold it in. And Tony can feel it building in his own chest, bubbling up his throat, and then they’re both laughing, high and hysterical. Steve drops down hard onto the floor from where he’d been kneeling, and it just makes him laugh harder, head dropping until his forehead is pressed to Tony’s shoulder, and they’re shaking together as they gasp for air.
Tonight, Steve is mostly bored. It’s an odd thing to be grateful for, but he is. He’s itching to go look at some of the new pieces on display – they’re ostensibly here for the opening of a new exhibit, and Steve’s heard good things about the artist – but they’ve been surrounded since they arrived, and no one else seems at all interested in any of the art.
Tony drags his hand out from under Steve’s jacket – where it has somehow wound up at nearly every event they’ve been to – catching briefly at the waist of his pants, and grabs his hand, carefully linking their fingers together. “If you’d excuse us just a moment?” Tony says blithely to the various people clustered around them, and then he’s clearing a path towards the entrance to the hall they’ve all gathered in, towing Steve behind him.
“America clear,” Steve sounds like he’s halfway between amusement at the team and irritation at everything else.
“Sir is in his workshop,” Jarvis responds, and, when Steve looks around, half expecting signs, adds, “Sir’s workshop is sublevel C, below the Tower.”
Some time later – at least half a dozen chimes, which could mean ten minutes or ten hours – Tony’s elbow-deep in holographic blueprints for a reactor-based Maserati engine when Cover You in Oil cuts out abruptly, followed by the hiss of the door and the sharp clack of Pepper’s heels crossing the floor.
Pepper glares, but it’s not like she can tell him not to go. And she can’t even yell at him about the noise, because she personally silenced his phone before the meeting started, and she knows as well as he does that Avengers alarms will come through either way. She follows him out into the hall. “What happened?” she asks, and she is most definitely annoyed – it had taken more wrangling than it probably should have for her to get Tony into the meeting to begin with – but there’s also definite concern edging out the irritation in her voice.
“Natasha promised to run over it with me when we’re done here,” Pepper confirms. Tony swivels to look at her.
as much, and here’s this guy throwing it out there like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. It’s somehow worse than the questions and speculation they get about their sexual preferences – at least that’s just crass and Tony can laugh it off. So now Tony’s ultra-aware of the fact that they’ve managed not to kill each other for five whole months, and he’s thinking about what kids from either one of them might look like, if they’d find a donor and a surrogate, or if they’d adopt, and this is not what he needs to be doing now. Or ever.
Tony laughs again. “You’d better,” he says. Then, “Thanks for being here for, you know, everything,” he waves a hand to indicate
Steve is the last to leave the conference room, wanting a few minutes of breathing room before he has to face the horde of reporters outside. He’s just pulled himself together when Tony saunters back into the room. He’s looking a little tense around the eyes, has been for the past three days, but still manages to look the perfect blend of put together and artfully disheveled Steve has always envied, just a little. Howard and Bucky had both been the same. It’s not the first time Tony has reminded him of both his father and Bucky, but the comparison still makes Steve’s chest ache.
They don’t say anything else, but it’s not uncomfortable. They just sit for a long time, sipping tea, while Tony’s breathing evens out, and his heart rate slowly settles back to normal.
It all adds up to feel a bit like a high-end hotel. For all there’s art on the walls, and personal touches here and there – Steve suspects Ms. Potts for both – it doesn’t feel lived in, or as if any decision had been made on
“Let me know if you need anything else tonight,” Natasha says to Ms. Potts, loading her rinsed plate into the dishwasher before heading for the elevator. “Otherwise, I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Coulson has his own phone out, now, tapping efficiently without the sharp motions Tony’s using. “You’ll be moving in with Stark, of course,” he says, glances up, must be able to read how flabbergasted Steve feels in the expression on his face. Steve thinks his jaw might unhinge if it keeps dropping. He maybe needs to get a handle on that. “It won’t look like much of a marriage if you aren’t even living together,” he points out, tone surprisingly gentle. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve sees Tony look up sharply, but when he turns, Tony’s looking at his screen again.
Even without all of that, though, and whatever else SHIELD decided to filter out, there’s probably a lot in that file. “So I should blame Coulson when Steve starts calling me – what was that one that really took off – the Merchant of Death?” Tony doesn’t delude himself about his past following him, but he needs Steve having more ammunition against him like he needs a hole in the head.
like shit, but this is what we’ve got, so I’m going to try to make it as bearable as possible, and you and Pepper throwing all this other
That decided, Steve tucks his pillow more firmly under his head, and lets himself drift off to a slideshow of memories of kissing Tony over the last few months, the cameras and crowds nowhere to be seen.
“Pictures from last night are already circulating,” Ms. Potts adds. “Jarvis, if you would,” she taps the counter, and a series of photos appears above the bagels.
He should have had Pepper give Steve the papers. Or maybe Natasha. They would have been able to explain better, make sure everything was clear. But Pepper would fuss and make sad eyes at him, and he’s spent more time with Natasha in the last few months, but he doesn’t exactly know her well, still isn’t sure if she likes him all that much – not that he can really blame her – and he wouldn’t feel right asking her to do something like this. Still. He should have sucked it up and asked one of them. Better than spilling his feelings all over Steve.
“I’m sure he’d say he lives to serve, as well.” Tony rubs a towel over his head. “Isn’t that the military line? Though he’s pretty lousy at serving,” he muses. “Unless it’s something he already wanted to do.”
“We didn’t really have a whole lot of spare fruit in the thirties,” Steve points out. “Nothing interesting anyway. Some prop pieces.” Steve considers for a moment.
By the time they hit the bed, Tony’s in his boxers and undershirt, and Steve’s down to just his pants, untied and hanging loose off his hips.
It’s just really nice, having Steve around when they’re not both on high alert from alien armies or invasive photographers. They’re not talking much, true, but when they do, it’s comfortable from the beginning, unlike every time they’ve been out in public together where they both start on edge, and only slowly find their way around to not snapping at each other. Steve’s talked a little more about his mother, how she’d make breakfast for him when he was young, before he had to learn to do it himself, and Tony has found himself sharing stories about hunting for change for the vending machines with Rhodey in the dorms at MIT to avoid going out into the snow in winter.
“He’s been shouting me down about following orders since I met him, I don’t think it’s got anything to do with our matching bling.” Tony holds up his left hand as Exhibit A.
“What did happen with Trent McPherson?” Steve asks. “It can’t have been the media, or it wouldn’t be such big news now.”
Steve smirks at him, leans down to press a kiss against Tony’s temple. “We have an audience,” he murmurs, warm breath washing over Tony’s skin, making him shiver.
Tony’s looking startled again, and Steve’s a little startled, himself, but it’s nice to talk like this, he’s finding, like relaxing after lifting weights, just letting everything go. He doesn’t really have an end goal, here, is just saying things as they come to him, but still. It’s surprisingly good.
“You are welcome.” Thor claps him on the shoulder again, and Tony’s knees almost buckle this time. “I had thought to question you further on your aim for this alliance, as you had not spoken of your affection previously. But I see now that I need not ask your intent, my friend. Your regard for the good captain is plain, and it brings to mind many of your actions since we formed our band of warriors. For all you speak, you say very little of what you truly feel, letting your deeds show the depth of your attachment. This is most commendable.”
,” she holds up a hand to keep Tony from interrupting. “Sometimes I need you to actually talk to them about what you’re working on. This is a big contract, but they’re going to want to know why it’s okay to build body armor for the military but not weapons, and if this means we’re going to
“The woman you were flirting with at the gala?” it’s half a question. “Tall, blonde, legs for days. She seemed pretty attached when I saw you two, but then she seemed to vanish, and we came home.”
Every morning, Steve has been in the kitchen when Tony has shuffled through in search of coffee. He’s always had his own mug in front of him, sometimes breakfast or the remnants of it as well, and been somehow occupied, either reading or drawing, so there’s no indication he’s actively been waiting for Tony or anything like that, but he’s said good morning in a way that sounds like he actually means it, and asked how Tony slept – or
“So you should come!” Clint decides. He heaves himself to his feet with more groaning than is probably necessary – they hadn’t gone
“On it,” Tony blasts at a rat leaping for Natasha’s perch in a maintenance alcove, and sweeps the tunnel. “Hawkeye?”
“We just need a workable alternative reason for why we always get caught when we don’t agree,” Tony counters. “Isn’t that what you Men in Black always do when something can’t be explained truthfully?”
“I don’t see how this is new,” Clint remarks. “Stark and Cap have been butting heads for the last year, and it hasn’t made any difference when it comes time to get the job done. Why does anyone care now?”
The moment hangs, stretches out, snaps, and Tony pushes forward, kisses back. This is what he wanted to say.
Tony shrugs, careful not to dislodge Steve’s hand. “Not intentionally,” he says, and this is exactly what he doesn’t want to talk about, not now. The secrets they’ve been hiding, the fears they carry, they’re out there, and he knows that’s for the best, but this was more than he’d bargained for, and he just. He doesn’t want to think right now. And it’s not usually that simple, but for once, he doesn’t. He tugs Steve forward by the shoulder until he can press his lips to Steve’s forehead, like a benediction, wants to wipe everything away.
After several long moments, Steve realizes he’s staring, following the lines of Tony’s shoulders and arms, wondering a little vaguely what else he’d be sweet about that he usually laughs off. It takes more effort than it maybe should to tear his eyes away, back down to his sketchbook, abruptly grateful Tony is so engrossed in his own work. He yawns again, decides he should probably call it a night. He shuts his book with a snap, and Tony jerks, looks up, eyes wide and disconcerted.
The moment stretches on, and Steve doesn’t look up, just turns a page and keeps reading. It’s not until he’s turning another page that Tony tells himself firmly to stop being a creep, and clears his throat loudly to get Steve’s attention.
Tony rolls his eyes, even though Steve can’t see it, and hooks an arm around the other man’s waist. “Step up on the feet, like you’re a kid and we’re dancing, and hold on,” Tony instructs. “This isn’t going to be a quick fly-by and drop, and I’ll need at least one hand to steady us at the speed we’re going to be moving.”
“We used to,” Steve pauses, clears his throat, tries again. “The Commandos, we used to tell stories, to pass the time.”
be doing is too much of a relief for him to do anything that might jeopardize Natasha’s cooperation. He only hopes Fury’s willing to let him go.
“You did say that it was unfair for a man of his aesthetic appeal to be a decent human being as well.”
The restaurant is expecting Steve when he shows up. They don’t even ask his name, just whisk him off to a table that’s tucked into a corner to give the illusion of privacy, in spite of being fully visible to the big room.
Tony comes fully into the room and closes the door behind him. He’s holding a sheaf of papers in one hand. “I wanted to give you these,” he says, holding them up. “Make sure you had them, for when you need them. Natasha probably explained them when she was going over paperwork with you back before – well. Before.” He takes a few steps closer to the bed and holds the papers out. Steve takes them automatically.
Steve opens his mouth to snap back – what, he doesn’t know – but there’s a knock at the door, and then it opens before either of them can respond.
“I mean they’re no longer here,” Steve still sounds tense, like he’s waiting for something else to happen, but also a bit like he’s trying not to roll his eyes.
Tony starts, like he’d stopped paying attention, then nods, topping up his mug and moving to sit on Ms. Potts’s other side. “Has anything changed in the last hour?” he asks, taking the pen she offers him.
“Man’s got a point,” Clint puts in, the faint twang of his bowstring sounding odd over the comms. “I’m using tranqs and nets, and nothing’s keeping these things down.”
Steve hasn’t done anything more presumptuous than kiss him on the cheek in private, and Tony has managed not to freeze up since that first time, but he’s started doing it more often, and he lingers over that, too. Tony can’t help but wonder if it might be misplaced affection, if it’s not an actual bet or dare of some kind, of Steve missing being close to people. He’s been close with Clint pretty much since the beginning – Natasha had said something about Clint having sought Steve out after the Chitauri invasion to thank him for trusting him, and the two of them bonding over hitting things from a distance with old-school weaponry – and they’ve clearly gotten closer working missions together. He’s gotten closer with Natasha in the same way, and is at least comfortable working with several of the SHIELD teams, but Tony doesn’t think it’s anything close to what he’d had before he went into the ice.
Truth be told, Steve’s really just tired of seeing the people he cares about hurt, and it’s galling that Tony would assume Steve
“No,” Coulson replies. “Actually, none of you need to be here right now. Cap, Stark, we’ll be in touch to brief you in a couple hours, so stay on premises. The rest of you can go. We’ll keep you updated when you’re needed.”
Steve’s smile widens to something that looks just as practiced as Tony’s. “Tony,” he nods, and waits until Tony has sat down before he sits again.
Tony scowls back immediately, because what the hell? “What the hell? I didn’t know any more than you did.”
“Great,” Tony says again. “Tell Cap to get his spangled butt up here when he’s decent. I’ll fly us out. It’ll be faster than the jet, and if Tweedledee and Tweedledum are coming from SHIELD, they’ll have one, and I don’t think we’ll have space to land two.”
Natasha heaves a very put-upon sigh, gives her hair a last swipe with the comb, and sets about gathering her own things together, disappearing momentarily back behind the partition. “If you think you’re up for it,” she calls, only a little muffled, “I’ll talk to Coulson and Fury, I’m sure we could use you back in the field. Probably not Bogotá, I think they’ve got a specific team in mind for that, but there are a couple the three of us could take, with just a handler, rather than sending out a full strike team.”
Clint had said that was a good thing, when Steve had brought it up one night when neither of them could sleep. They’d been out on the landing pad, not really talking much, just watching the city lights. Steve had been sketching, then, too, and it had felt like a confession when he’d said it.
“What is there to handle?” Tony asks, knows exactly what there is, if this is really showing up top of a simple online search, but that doesn’t mean he wants to do it. “It’s a sex tape. This is not the worst thing that’s turned up on the internet.”
“Thank you,” Pepper smiles at the nearest camera, and turns back to Tony. “Regardless of whether or not you were, in fact, making out, it looks like you were, and the pictures were everywhere by dinnertime. That wasn’t exactly what we were going for, but it was certainly effective. PR was contacted by at least half a dozen major news outlets before eight this morning and has been “no comment”-ing all day. However, about an hour ago, we had our leak. A line about how pleased all your friends are that you and Captain Rogers have finally decided to get married, and how happy the two of you are together.” Pepper pauses here to give Tony a significant sort of look.
“I know you’re not ignoring me, Tony, because you know I don’t have time to chase you around to get you to do the things you need to be doing.” Pepper sounds the level of harried that means Tony’s not in real trouble yet, but he shouldn’t push too hard.
Steve takes another step forward, very deliberately getting into Tony’s face, and Tony takes an automatic step back before planting himself. “You just take whatever you want,” Steve’s practically spitting, and Tony has no idea how this went south quite so quickly, but he’s not about to roll over just because Steve’s decided to start throwing his weight around again.
on Katie Whatsername, at MIT. Do you remember how badly that turned out? Because I do.” He gives the tie a final tug and steps back.
– to trust you with our secrets, especially secrets that are not relevant to the team but certainly involve the safety of people
“Oh,” Steve feels his face heat up slightly and hopes he’s not flushing. “Well, it’s nice to meet you, Dummy, I’m Steve.” He holds out a hand automatically, and immediately feels foolish. “Uh –”
moment, there is no mistaking Tony’s sincerity, or his concern. If Steve thinks about it, which he’s been doing an uncomfortable amount of the last five days, he can think of dozens of times when Tony has checked in with him just like this, when he’s made a point of making sure Steve is level. More than once Tony has found ways of helping Steve find an even keel, even if Steve hasn’t admitted to a problem, just done it in a way where Steve hadn’t even realized at the time what was happening. There are probably other times Steve doesn’t remember, times he hadn’t even known there was a problem to be fixed.
He’s just finishing the last of his own bagel when he hears the elevator, and a few moments later, Ms. Potts clicks into view, looking as scarily put together as ever, in spite of the still-early hour.
Tony looks startled, fully invested now. “What –” he starts, but Steve cuts him off before he can get the question out.
“Don’t let Nick hear you, or he’ll get an edict passed saying you’re not allowed out on anymore playdates,” Tony warned, and then they were too busy for Steve to come up with anything else for a while.
“Dr. Banner is in the monitor room – Captain Rogers has agreed that, as with the situation with the rats, it would be best to keep him above ground, except as a last resort. The Captain himself is in his room in the penthouse, changing into his uniform. Agents Barton and Romanoff are at SHIELD headquarters, and will meet you on site.”
“I know that,” Pepper says steadily, “but it’s going to look like it. I can make a statement that you just wanted your privacy, if you like, but it’s unlikely that will help much.”
Steve’s face crumples. “I’m sorry,” he says, “I shouldn’t have said anything, you just, you were standing there and then you just. Sat down. I don’t think you fainted, but you didn’t exactly not faint, either. And you weren’t answering me. I thought.” Steve shakes his head. “Should I get Clint? Or – or Bruce?”
Steve looks a little startled at that, looks back at Tony, wide eyes stupidly blue, and Tony hates himself a little for noticing. “I didn’t say that.”
He starts sketching Stark Tower while he waits. He’s drawn it enough that it’s not hard to do from memory, even in detail. He leaves off the smashed windows that had still graced the penthouse the last time he’d been there, knows Tony and Ms. Potts have had it fixed in the last year even though he hasn’t been above the conference levels of the Tower since the Chitauri attack. He wonders what the inside looks like now, what the private rooms are like. He’ll be sharing Tony’s space, which he can’t picture as anything less than modernly opulent – or maybe opulently modern, he can never tell with Tony – but he got the impression there were separate residences for the rest of the Avengers. He can’t imagine anything Tony has designed being anything like the army barracks, and Ms. Potts did say apartments, but he can’t really imagine it being anything like his current apartment, either.
What feels like only a few minutes later – but is probably at least a few hours – Atomic Punk cuts out, followed by the predictable click of Pepper’s heels.
“Tony,” Steve reaches out, like he might touch, but pulls back before he can make contact. Steve’s the only person in the complex Tony hasn’t touched since he’s been back. Everyone’s been more tactile than ever, needing to prove to themselves and each other that they’re all here. That Steve hasn’t, that he won’t, hurts in a way Tony doesn’t want to think about. Can’t afford to think about. Or maybe it’s the only thing he should be thinking about.
Tony banks hard, and hits two more rodents before catching Barton up and swinging back towards the train that has started rocking with the force of the rats trying to climb up it.
They work hard, the only noises their breathing and the sounds of their feet and bodies hitting the mats, except for when Natasha gives instructions or corrections, or when Tony needs clarification. It’s good, exhausting in ways not a lot of things are, and demands Tony’s full attention, but doesn’t require – or allow – him to think the way he usually does. He slowly starts to unwind and relax into it.
Eventually, Pepper squeezes Tony’s arm, sans nails this time, but Tony still jumps. He’d forgotten she hadn’t let go.
“Are you going to tell me a story?” Tony asks. It’s a little bitter, more than a little tired, but mostly curious, so Steve will count it as a win.
“You probably got more done without me there,” Tony points out, glad for the change in topic, even if talking about board meetings is almost as bad as actually attending them.
“Well, your people called my people and I wasn’t going to say no,” Mr. Cooper laughs, “even if it’s not quite what we usually do.”
doesn’t mean he hasn’t thought about what he’d do in a relationship with anyone else. He just needs to do with Tony what he would have wanted to do with someone of his own choosing. And it’s been, well, nice, sometimes, to have Tony pressed up against him, his warmth close and comforting. And the times Tony has kissed him have been more than nice.
isn’t something you want – that’s okay. It can be whatever you want it to be right now, in this place, before we have to go save the world again, and it can be whatever you want it to be if we come out the other side.”
Steve stares blankly ahead for a long moment before comprehension dawns. “Our comms were on.” That’s mortifying. It makes Jarvis’s chilly disposition more understandable, though.
Steve looks perfectly at ease, and a little like he’s going to start trying to sell Tony war bonds. It’s fairly impressive.
If Tony had been worried about Nebula getting along with the Survivors – which he hadn’t been, but if he had – he wouldn’t have needed to. The raccoon – Thor calls him Rabbit? – makes a few snide remarks, but that seems to be his default. Everyone else is more than ready to welcome anyone still alive with open arms, and Thor, in particular, seems to put her at ease. They wander off together at some point to talk. Something about Nebula’s sister, and crazy homicidal family members. Tony’s not sure. Next to Thanos and Hela, Tony’s family looks positively ideal. He’d throw Loki in with the crazies, but it sounds like the jury’s out on him. He’s missed a lot.
might not always like it, but he knows. We have to be ahead of this thing, whatever it is. You talk about sharing, but you won’t even trust us enough to talk to us about what you’re going through, and you don’t ever actually ask about us, either, you just sit in judgement and get angry that no one feels comfortable telling you their deepest, darkest secrets for you to trample over. Everything’s black and white with you. You make up your mind, and that’s it, you’re right, everyone else is wrong, and how dare we have opinions that aren’t yours.” Tony takes a breath, then another, a third, deeper. This isn’t how he wanted this to go. It’s almost like that first meeting, back on the first Helicarrier, the first time the scepter got into their heads. He feels it fizz under his skin – fight or flight, and he never was very good at fleeing – but this isn’t going to help anything, and he knows that.
After several minutes of basking, Steve feels significantly less destructive. He dresses quickly and heads out for a run, following the already familiar route up to Central Park. The steady rhythm of the run helps as much as the sunshine and the view of the city, and by the time he returns to the penthouse, armed with breakfast, he feels much better, and ready to deal with whatever the day plans on throwing at him.
Steve comes awake abruptly, completely disoriented, and instinctively holds very still, not even opening his eyes. There’s no street noise, and while the bed he’s in is perfectly comfortable, it’s not
“I.” Tony has exactly zero idea how to respond to that. He can almost feel his brain trying to reboot. “What.”
Then one of the pushier men shoves his phone in Tony’s face and asks, “You and Captain Rogers have been married five months now – has Father’s Day brought up the topic of having kids?” and the bottom drops out of Tony’s stomach.
Tony frowns, because that can’t be right. He’s sure Steve knew that the suits they wore for highly publicized red carpet events were bought outright instead of lent by designers specifically for the purpose of being able to sell them afterwards. But maybe – maybe Steve’s reaction makes more sense if he hadn’t known.
Tony raises his hands like he’s surrendering. “Of course you are,” he says, and it doesn’t sound like he believes it, but Steve is ridiculously grateful that he doesn’t push, for once. “I just thought you might want to get this dinner date over with?” it sounds more like a question to Steve than he thinks it was probably intended to.
“Nice comeback,” is all Tony says, and Steve doesn’t even know what it’s meant to be a comeback for, just a brief lapse in his brain-to-mouth filter.
Tony shrugs, turning to face him, and forcibly keeps his hands at his side rather than tapping at his chest where the arc reactor used to be. “Less than you are,” he points out.
Startled, Tony stiffens, then lets himself relax into it. There’s definitely something different about Steve, and just because Tony can’t put his finger on what it is, exactly, doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy it. Even if it
“Holy rats, Batman,” Barton breathes, and then has to get three tranquilizer arrows into a single rat before it drops.
Pepper gives him a suspicious look, but there’s clearly no time, because she lets it go, and gives him a push towards the door. “Your turn,” she says, keeps half a step behind him as they walk.
“SHIELD and SI are not involved, except for Pepper, Coulson, and Fury. We’re not broadcasting that this is a giant ruse, that would defeat the purpose.”
“Sir,” there’s something chiding in Jarvis’s voice, and for a moment Tony can heard the AI’s namesake. It’s enough to shake him out of his funk, if not entirely settle him.
Steve looks around the table; Tony at the far end with his eyes fixed on his phone, posture overly relaxed, Natasha next to him, apparently having a conversation across the table with Clint using only their eyebrows – one day Steve will learn to do that – Banner a few seats farther down tapping on his own phone. Coulson’s sitting next to Fury, turned as if they’d been talking before Steve came in, but now he’s watching Steve, expression even more unreadable than usual. Steve sits.
“The fuck it will,” the words are a snarl, and Tony’s jaw clenches as soon as they’re out. He needs to stop this. Of all people, Steve doesn’t need Tony’s million and one neuroses thrown in his face, especially when he’s clearly dealing with something himself. Tony would have to be blind not to have noticed the tension Steve has been carrying around in the weeks since their debut, the way he draws in on himself and sometimes seems somewhere else entirely when the paparazzi start shouting and taking picture after picture. Tony’s pretty sure it’s the flashing lights more than the noise, but he’s not positive, and Steve seems determined to pretend nothing’s wrong. At least with Tony. That probably shouldn’t hurt as much as it does. And now it’s the middle of the night and Tony’s practically yelling at him. Tony turns away, back to the table, wraps his hands around his mug.
“What’s got your head in the clouds?” she asks, coming to sit on the bench in front of the lockers while she towels her hair.
Then there are the times Steve remembers being unable to clear his head, being unable to settle in the glittering crowds, being unable to take a deep breath or focus amid the flash of cameras, could only be grateful there was no smoke like there used to be, and Tony would get them out. Steve doesn’t know how he does it, but Tony seems to have an uncanny ability to find quiet corners, or abandoned hallways, and just, well, remove them from the center of things. In light of new information, Steve’s starting to wonder if that unnecessary callout had been manufactured. It had been a particularly bad night, and the combination of the distraction and just getting away from the glitz and glamour and back into his comfort zone had worked as nothing else could have.
.” Tony runs his fingers roughly through his hair, grips the back for a long moment, then takes several deep breaths.
“As you like,” Thor shouts back. He drops low enough that he can release Steve at the top of the stairs, then kicks off again to join the other flyers.
Steve’s lips tingle a little at the memory of kissing Tony’s cheek just moments before, and it takes more of an effort than it should not to press his fingers against them. That was nice, too.
“We’re getting nothing,” Tony puts in, as Jarvis finishes running a sweep. “No traces of anything that’s not supposed to be here. Might be a good idea to install cameras down here, if this is going to become a thing.”
interested, though how much of that is for the audience or from simple proximity, Steve can’t be sure. He doesn’t want to rock the boat by just coming out and asking, thinks that might be a little crude, but. Well. A little more affection never hurt anyone, and Tony hadn’t said anything when Steve had kissed him just now with just the two of them there, so maybe Steve can test the waters that way.
“Did something happen?” Steve asks. He takes half a step closer, hands still out like he’s going to touch, then freezes, and drops his hands abruptly back to his sides.
“Yeah,” Steve breathes out, a little unsteady, and it might be agreement, might just be acknowledgment, but he leans in to kiss Tony again, hard like he wants to leave an impression, and when he pulls back he’s taken the condom and lube from Tony’s hand.
Tony waves a hand vaguely. “What are they going to do? What do you mean you shouldn’t have said –” and it all comes crashing back. “Oh.” He can feel his pulse pick up, feels it in his chest and his hands like he’s vibrating. He has to force himself to take deep breaths, focuses on that instead of the way his face is starting to tingle. “Right,” he says, feels like he had to choke it out, but it comes out sounding almost normal.
And that’s just. No. “You think the only thing worth anything is fighting?” Tony demands. “Nothing else matters?”
“It wasn’t new. I’d never seen it so clearly, but the idea wasn’t new. She didn’t pull it out of thin air and plant it in my brain. We don’t know what’s coming, but there are things out there we can’t begin to imagine, and I
“Uh,” he says eloquently, blinking in some confusion at Natasha and Barton sitting at the breakfast bar in workout clothes, plates of eggs and giant cups of coffee in front of them.
, things won’t be that bad after all. For right now, Tony’s going to actually let himself hope, because he’s not entirely sure how he’s going to get through this otherwise.
“I appreciate it,” Tony grins, waves again, this time directly at Steve, “we both do. It’s nice to have a friendly face asking questions for once.”
“I’ve got nothing, Cap.” Tony tries to keep his own frustration tamped down, but he knows everyone can hear it, anyway. This is getting to all of them.
Settling in against the bar, Steve orders Tony’s drink and resolves to be a better husband, even if the thought of being someone’s husband still feels like a pair of boots he hasn’t broken in yet. He gives in to the impulse and touches his fingertips to his lips. If he stops looking at it as a punishment, or something he just has to grit his teeth and endure, maybe they could even enjoy themselves.
“Right. Well. Thanks,” Tony says, clears his throat. “Just. Just make sure he has clearance for everything. We can set up access for the others later, when we know what they’re doing.”
Tony sighs, tamps down the urge to try to further delay the inevitable, and allows Pepper to chivvy him out of the workshop, up to the penthouse – there’s no sign of Steve – and into the shower. He can hear her rustling through his clothes in the walk-in closet.
Something relaxes in Steve’s face, his shoulders. “I can make some, if you’d like?” he offers. “I was going to, for myself, and then I saw you.”
The distress hasn’t left Pepper’s face, but she looks determined now, as well. Multi-tasking facial expressions. Tony wonders if most people can do that, or if it’s just her. “Whether or not you want to talk about him – and I understand that you don’t – we still have to handle this.”
“I would never –” Steve sputters, and then realizes Tony’s joking. Or mostly joking. It’s not always easy to tell, and Steve can see the way Tony’s shoulders are tense, like he’s trying not to hunch in, and is clinging to a lifetime of training to continue looking casual. “What’s wrong?” he asks abruptly.
“Any idea what’s causing it?” Tony can’t tell if the slightly-less-than-bland edge to Coulson’s voice is interest, irritation, or distraction. Avoiding panicked and shrieking civilians who don’t know how to follow instructions from the professionals evacuating them while trying to shoot giant rodents is pretty distracting.
“Working on it,” Coulson replies shortly. There’s a burst of gunfire reports, and a handful of human screams mixed with the grating screeches from the rats. “More cover for the evacuees would be good right about now.”
,” he insists. The last thing he needs is for Tony to spend the whole night asking how he’s doing. “Are we going to hold hands all night?” he shakes Tony’s hand for emphasis. “It’s not the most comfortable, what with the height difference and all.”
For a long minute, Tony doesn’t even register what Steve’s saying, just tries to grasp the fact that he didn’t even
“If or when we decide to have kids, you can bet we won’t be consulting you about it,” Tony says with a smile that hurts. “But thanks for asking. And that’s the last question any of you get. You’ve thoroughly killed the romance of the afternoon – thanks for that – and you’re blocking everyone’s view. Very unsportsmanlike of you all. So we’re going to go enjoy the rest of our day somewhere where you aren’t. C’mon, babe,” Tony firmly grabs Steve by the hand, and tows him out into the aisle, plowing through the idiots still trying to shout questions at them and getting in everyone’s way.
A server appears almost before Steve is fully in his chair, two bottles of wine in hand. “Red or white to start this evening, Mr. Stark?”
Tony gives him a crooked sort of grin, then turns to the crowd with a smirk. He tugs Steve forward by the hand, somehow making it look like he’s not leading him around, though Steve can’t help but feel like he’s being paraded about, anyway.
When Tony chances a glance at Steve, it’s to see him staring out the window, an oddly contemplative look on his face.
“Steady, Cap,” Tony tells him under the noise, leaning close to make sure Steve can hear. His grip tightens on Steve’s hand, and he pulls him in, like he’s trying to get closer, but Steve recognizes the defensive posture, sees the way Tony is putting his body between Steve and the press lining the walk. “Look at me,” Tony says, low and firm.
, he thinks. He shakes his head again, and tries to stop clutching the gauntlet and screwdriver so tightly he’s losing feeling in the tips of his fingers. “You want to have sex with me,” he says, because he’s pretty sure he’s not hearing things, but figures it’s best to clarify.
Slowly, Steve makes his way from room to room, touching bits of furniture, opening cabinets. There are full windows everywhere, reflecting the rooms back at him, but if he stands next to them, he can see the city lights winking up at him. Everything looks clean and comfortable. The sofa is soft, opposite what he’s learned is a full, high-end entertainment center. There are shelves of books in a wide variety of genres. There’s a closet full of clothes that look like they’re his size, everything from gym pants to full suits. The bed is large and neatly made. The bathroom is even bigger than the one he’s been using in the penthouse, with a multi-head shower and a decadently large bathtub. The same brands of shampoo and soap he’s been using are lined up neatly on a shelf under the main showerhead, which would be a little disconcerting, but he’s been around long enough to recognize that Jarvis probably had everything set up for him. The kitchen is open and airy, all gleaming chrome and shining marble countertops.
Steve opens his mouth again to say that he knows that, it took him a while, and some pretty big signs pointing the way, but he’s there now, but Ms. Potts isn’t done.
Rhodes shrugs. “I’m happy to help. Figured I’d stick around for a couple days after the wedding,” Steve forces himself not to twitch, “and, like I said earlier, I’d rather be here helping than watching it on the news, knowing I should be helping.”
Back on the street he doesn’t even pause to think, just lets his feet carry him away from the apartment block. He wonders if this will be the last time he does this, here, or if he’ll end up moving back when the whole sham marriage is over, whensoever that might be. What’s ‘some time,’ anyway? A few months? Years? Do they even know? Does it matter? Maybe he’ll stay at the Tower. If everyone else is moving in, he should probably be with them, but maybe there won’t be a place there for him after this ends, figuratively or literally.
“And that’s the gist of it,” Coulson says before Clint can retaliate. “Agent Romanov, if you can get those –” he nods at the folder he’d handed her “– back to Ms. Potts sometime tomorrow, they can go to the Stark Industries lawyers first thing Friday after the news has broken, so we can get them signed before the wedding.”
“Because, now, Captain America doesn’t approve of my lifestyle choices.” Tony’s tone is so bland it takes a minute for his words to sink in.
“Mm,” Rhodes hums, then gives Steve a surprisingly piercing look. “I’d meant to say this to you before, but didn’t get the chance. I know none of this was intentional, and that you were not prepared for this anymore than he was, but if you do anything to hurt Tony, I will break your kneecaps, and I will enjoy doing it, Captain America or not.”
Carefully, with hands that are comfortingly steady in spite of the way he feels like he’s about to shake out of his skin, Tony pours out a cup of coffee then settles the pot back in place. Just as carefully, he carries the mug over to the table and sits. He tries regulating his breathing again, and it’s easier now. His heart is still going full throttle for the open road, but if he can just remember how to breathe, he’s sure he won’t feel quite so much like he’s about to go into cardiac arrest. He’s not allowed to do that anymore. He promised Pepper.
“You had an interesting conversation with Steve,” Tony says, apropos of absolutely nothing, in between sips from his water bottle. He hadn’t meant to bring it up, hadn’t meant to open that can of worms, but he can’t be entirely surprised his mouth ran away with him on this one. He’s been thinking about it all day, and he doesn’t have the greatest filter at the best of times.
Tony’s smile is sharp. “Oh, I am. Can’t really argue with the results, I’ll give Saint Nick that, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want him to feel it. It’ll just be more fun to watch Natasha do it. The woman is an artist.”
“Great,” Tony says. “See you at dinner, then.” He gives the ground a kick, and slides back under the car. The music blares to life again around them.
a little crazy. But now, when the nightmares come, when these attacks sneak up on him, it’s like he’s lost signal, somehow, and all he can hear or see or think is static. Static and pinpricks of light in darkness. Galaxies far, far away, full of hostile, sentient beings just biding their time. Until what, he doesn’t know, and the static just screeches loudly, preventing anything more than
What had started out as the view from his window had turned into scenes from the fight in the tunnels had turned into the team in the conference room during the debriefing had turned into Tony, lips curled in a sly grin, leaning in, sunglasses off and so close Steve could count his eyelashes. Steve had stared at that last sketch for a long time, not quite sure what to make of it. And he’s still not sure. He’d seen the photos, and even though he knows Tony had only kissed him the once – and barely even then – it had looked so much like something else that Steve can almost remember being kissed again, more than just a brief press of warm lips and the there-and-gone rasp of Tony’s goatee. Which is ridiculous. It didn’t happen. It was just the angle of the pictures. Tony obviously knew what he was doing, knew where the cameras were, and what it would look like. And now it keeps playing in Steve’s head like battle plans and older memories he doesn’t want to think about.
Tony’s mouth goes thin. “Good thing I wasn’t interested, then.” Tony’s voice is clipped. “If age differences bother you, though, you should probably keep that to yourself, given our situation. It looks a bit like hypocrisy, what with you robbing the cradle. Or maybe I am, since you were chilling in suspended animation instead of actually living like everyone else for most of your ninety-odd years.”
“What?” Steve blinks, like maybe he hadn’t actually been focused on Tony and Natasha at all. “Oh. No. You’re not going far.”
“You keep saying ‘marriage’ like it’s an actual option,” Tony comments, eyes flicking from Steve to Coulson and back, then down to his phone as it lights up against his fingers. His mouth twitches a little at one corner.
“Of course.” Tony only takes half a second to think about it, then adds, “I’ll have Jarvis let them know they can move into the Tower as well. There are apartments for all of them.”
They wind up outside, and it’s familiar and not, doing this, the two of them. It’s dark away from the buildings, too far from any city to even get the light pollution that’s so much less now, anyway.
“Nothing,” Tony says dismissively, waving it off. “I just wanted to clarify that this arrangement doesn’t have to ruin your life. You can still have one, just make sure it’s discreet, at least for now.”
His mind fails him, as it only ever does in these moments. Tony spends most of his life with his thoughts running in a hundred different directions, too many things to do and say and be and create. It makes the people around him a little crazy. It sometimes makes
hard, either on the mats or in the simulator – and starts shoving his things into his bag. “It’ll be a blast.” He winks over-exaggeratedly.
,” he stresses the word, because even if Thor doesn’t mean ‘proposal’ the way Steve had initially taken it, he still doesn’t like it, “that I made was changed a bit, but the intent is still to convince the general public that we’re not going to fail at saving the world because of infighting.”
“Captain Rogers,” Pepper’s still smiling, but it’s not quite as warm as it was for Coulson. Tony maybe shouldn’t still be categorizing her smiles, but he’s never been good at breaking bad habits.
Even with the cowl still covering half of his face, the scowl is obvious. “Were you planning on telling anyone you were wounded?” Steve demands.
“Okay.” Tony loosens his grip just a little, takes a deep breath for the first time since he woke up. “Yeah. That would be. Okay.”
Not that Tony would be opposed to some private fireworks. Steve’s been extra touchy-feely of late, both in public and in private, and it’s getting to Tony. He’s not sure what started it, or if he’s just going a little crazy from the extended proximity, but Steve’s touches seem to be lingering longer, and he’s been finding more excuses to touch to begin with, whether or not they’re being watched. And he most definitely slipped some tongue action in there the last time they had to kiss, and Tony. Tony does not know what to do with that.
“Is anyone else awake?” Tony asks, pushing himself up and out of bed. It became apparent early on that none of them sleep very well with any kind of consistency.
“It can wait,” Pepper informs him, and, no, it really can’t, but Bruce, the traitor, just waves him off, so Tony ends up trailing Pepper back across the lab and out into the hallway.
, you wouldn’t be here, when all your friends are dead,” Tony snarls back, and, even as incensed as he is, the second he sees the words hit home, he regrets them.
Rhodey shakes his head. “I think he’s a mess and doesn’t know what to do about any of this, and is taking it out on you.”
“I don’t mean he’s fragile,” she says, like she’s read his mind. “He’s the strongest person I know. But he also has the biggest heart, and it’s been broken too many times.” She doesn’t say by her, but there’s something about the way she’s holding herself that Steve hears it anyway. “Everyone sees the big personality he puts on, the flashy armor he wears, but he’s not as insensitive as most people believe.”
Ms. Potts’s eyes flick briefly to Steve, like she knew he’d been going to say something, but all she says is, “I’ll ask him to meet us in my office. Captain, just come down to the executive level in half an hour or so.”
. His inner fanboy takes a moment to cheer, and the part of him that always wants to thumb his nose at everyone who’s ever been a dick to him wants to gloat, because he’s marrying Captain America, their arguments are invalid. There’s something very satisfying in that, even if it’s not really true.
The doors slide open to a short hallway ending in a glass wall. There doesn’t seem to be a door. Steve approaches carefully, fascinated by the floating blue lights he can see on the other side. He doesn’t see Tony, but he leans closer to the glass, trying to decipher what the lights – holographic images, Steve reminds himself – are forming. He doesn’t realize he’s pressed his hand to the glass until Jarvis’s voice says, “Print recognized: Captain Steven Grant Rogers. Please enter access code, Captain.”
There are empty pizza boxes on the coffee table. Barton’s sprawled in the big armchair, and Bruce is sitting on the floor, a tablet discarded on the ground next to him, leaning against one of Barton’s legs. Natasha and Steve have commandeered the couch, Natasha stretched across two thirds, toes just poking into Steve’s thigh. They all look comfortable and happy, and Tony feels the smile that spreads over his face at this evidence that Steve’s clearly doing better with everyone, getting closer to the rest of the team, even as, almost simultaneously, his chest tightens a little at the confirmation that Steve really has changed with all of them, and there’s nothing special about the way he’s been acting with Tony. From the easy look of things here, he’s still wary around Tony, and clearly only spending time with him when they’re supposed to, nothing like this.
Now that he’s thinking about it, he realizes a number of the books he’s seen have been things he’s mentioned – sometimes only in passing – as titles, or authors, or events he’s been interested in. And, in that light, the art he’s recognized probably isn’t just Ms. Potts having good artistic taste, though, from everything Tony’s said about her, he’s sure that’s part of it.
?” Barton demands plaintively after another few minutes, voice a contrast with the sharp hiss of his bowstring.
As it turns out, the things he would rather pack himself don’t even fill a duffle bag. He zips the bag closed anyway. No point in weighing it down with other things.
“Pep, calm down.” Tony grabs Pepper by the shoulders, gives her a little shake. “I was teasing. And I never went bungee jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, Tracy decided San Francisco was too far away –”
Taking several deep breaths, Tony reminds himself that he can’t just fly off home to fume and kick himself for being an idiot in peace and quiet. He still has to deal with the press. And debrief at some point, assuming Steve gets his star-spangled panties out of their bunch. And get caught up on the meeting he walked out of. He slowly forces himself to relax and unclench fists he hadn’t realized he’d made.
Museums are not high on Tony’s list of places he’d like to spend any significant amount of time, but after half a morning at the Met, he isn’t as miserable as he thought he’d be. Mostly that’s due to how thrilled Steve seems to be, and how contagious his enthusiasm is.
Uncertain of another option for getting Tony’s attention over the music, Steve crouches down and shakes one of the protruding legs by the ankle.
“Of course there are,” Tony sighs. He eyeballs the videos and still images while he finishes pulling on pants and stuffs his feet into the closest pair of shoes. “Where is everyone?”
Oddly, that does make Tony feel a bit better about everything. At least he’s not alone in this, and maybe – just maybe – it won’t be so terrible. He’ll have company for all the events he can’t get out of attending, though he’s seen the calendar Pepper has been putting together, and it seems like he’s going to be going to more events than ever, which is unfortunate. But if he and Steve can figure out how to get along, having his company should make all the posturing and posing far more bearable. And if he and Steve can get along, well. Sometimes Tony wants to put on the suit and go a few rounds, but the bit of him that hasn’t managed to douse the damn torch he’s carried for decades can’t help but thrill a bit at the idea of actually being friends with Steve Rogers, actually letting him see the best in him, the bits that everyone else misses, the scattered pieces he doesn’t hate as much as the rest. He’s seen Steve laugh a few times now, seen him smile a few more, and he doesn’t hate the idea of being able to cause that. And fake as he knows this marriage will be, he’s still going to be married to
“I’ll just let Cap do the talking,” Tony says eventually, and it only sounds a little bitter. “Was there anything else, or did you just call to tell me the one interview that wasn’t going to be work is going to be as much trash as everything else?” Maybe more than a little bitter.
“It wasn’t,” Tony cuts her off. “Don’t make it into a thing. If he wants it, it’s there. If he doesn’t, that’s fine. Everyone else seems comfortable enough. He can do what he wants.”
skip out, not on this. Steve’s fairly certain Tony makes a habit of showing up late to meetings, if he shows up at all, but he’s just as certain that he’s never left anyone on the team to face the press alone, has taken over that duty himself more times than Steve can count in the past year, has done it so smoothly that Steve’s not sure anyone has even noticed how Tony has kept the limelight on himself so that Clint, and Natasha, and Banner, and even Steve himself, haven’t had to deal with it.
The final parts of the newest pacemaker Tony’s been working with R&D to develop are just coming together nicely when Jarvis interrupts with a phone call.
By the time Steve starts yawning, he and Tony are the only ones left in what was once Tony’s living room, but has now become the Avengers’ common room, stretched out at opposite ends of the couch, legs intertwined in a way Steve would have found irritating only a few short months ago, but now just feels comfortable. The others have all gone off to their own apartments, presumably to sleep, trickling out in the last hour or two since the movie ended.
“Maybe this will help make us better,” Steve suggests. “We’re going to have to spend a lot of time together, maybe knowing each other better this way will make things easier in combat situations.”
And then, abruptly, it’s over. Tony blinks, and the alligators are gone, nothing left but an arrow quivering in the wall.
Steve is still awake when Tony finishes in the bathroom, sitting up against the headboard, already deep into a book he must have picked up downstairs. Tony was kind of hoping he’d be asleep, that they wouldn’t have to talk. He’d offered Steve first shower and taken longer than he needed when it was his turn specifically to avoid another confrontation.
“Upstairs?” Steve’s hands are back on Tony’s arms, around his wrists this time, and he’s tugging again, pulling Tony towards the door and the elevator beyond.
“So I stop making drive-by messes of everyone else’s lives, and Rogers gets the credit? How nice for him.”
Tony glances sideways at Steve, clocks how red his face must be, and, for a split second, his expression slips, something oddly like guilt showing through, before Tony’s usual press smile returns. “You know me,” Tony says glibly.
The penthouse is empty when Steve reaches it. Unsurprising, given the hour, but Steve had vaguely been hoping Tony might be there. He’d have had an easier time getting Tony to agree to going out if he didn’t have to pry him away from a project.
A distraction. He needs something, anything, to focus his mind, take it off the vastness of space and the things he
Tony realizes he’s staring, mouth slightly open in shock. Pepper and Jarvis knowing about his crush, fine. He’s almost positive Rhodey knows he never grew out of it, too. But Thor? Thor’s only been around sporadically over the last year. If he knows, who else knows? Does
Tony is tinkering with a ’39 Bullet diagram, caught up in the balance between modernized capabilities and original design, when the music in the shop cuts out, announcing Pepper’s presence.
“Right,” Steve says again, can almost feel Tony’s lips against his as they move, can taste the coffee Tony was drinking throughout their debrief on his breath. He can feel where Tony is using his grip on Steve’s jacket for balance, and tightens his fingers a little on Tony’s shoulder to hold him, but a moment later Tony drops back onto his heels, and Steve’s fingers slide up the back of his neck just a little, brushing into the short hairs along his nape. Steve can feel the nearly imperceptible shiver that runs along Tony’s spine, and then Tony is stepping away from him again.
“I’ve never been to Bogotá, either,” Steve tells them, figures he can get the story out of one of them later. If Natasha was going to tell him, and Clint didn’t want to talk about it, it’s probably a funny story, rather than about something that went belly up.
It’s not meant to be insulting, Tony really doesn’t want Steve to worry about it. He’d also really like to not get into anything just now. The press have been extra ravenous since the wedding – clamoring for pictures, political and religious views, and details of their sex life in fairly equal measure, regardless of whether they’re at a charity concert at the Kennedy Center in DC, or dealing with the aftermath of a bridge collapse in Missouri – and he just wants to deal with them and get home. The longer he stands here, the more aware he is of the aches of bruises waiting to pop out, as well as the sting of those minor abrasions, and he really wants a chance to soak in the hottest water he can handle before he has to go back to the office to deal with everything he skipped out on.
Tony hums agreement, wonders if maybe Steve would like to go to Greece to see the Acropolis, or maybe London, since they’d see more, and then has to remind himself that they’re not really dating, and while going a couple miles uptown to a museum is fine, going several thousand miles to a museum is probably not.
“And no dawdling!” Pepper half-yells, half-laughs after him as the doors close, the sound following him down to the garage.
The whole process doesn’t take very long, and then Clint’s wandering out with a third bagel in hand.
They’re almost back to the Tower when Steve breaks the silence, clearing his throat to get Tony’s attention. “I had a really good time today,” he says when Tony looks at him.
Steve shakes his head. “No, I get it.” He’s still a little offended that they think it’s necessary, and a little concerned about SHIELD’s possible involvement, but he can’t really do anything about the former, and the latter is something he’ll have to look into later.
“Who are we heading off?” Clint wanders in and makes a beeline for the bag of bagels. He looks a bit like he just rolled out of bed, sweatpants and t-shirt rumpled, hair sticking up. Natasha, right behind him, is, by contrast, in a neat pair of slacks and a carefully buttoned blouse, like she just stepped out of an office meeting.
Steve blinks at the abrupt subject change, then up at the waiter who practically materializes out of thin air when Tony beckons. He takes the menu he’s offered while Tony rattles off something that might be wine, says “I’ll have the same,” when the man turns to him, and then looks back at Tony, who has opened his own menu rather pointedly in front of his face. At least, it seems pointed.
Tony deposits Barton on top of the train – gently – and uses the kickback from his next repulsor blast at a particularly large rat to spin him back to face the tunnels. An infrared scan shows the mass of rodents in the dark. “Hey, Jolly Green, you getting this?”
“Nuh-uh,” Tony reaches out, catches Steve by the wrist, and Steve realizes he’s automatically reached up to fix his hair. “Don’t ruin all my hard work.” Tony’s smirking again, and Steve feels himself start to grin back.
Tony presses his laugh to Steve’s cheek, and gets them moving again, shedding clothes before they’re even through the bedroom door.
Steve frowns, but sits to take his shoes off. “Ready for wheels’ up in five,” is all he says, and shrugs out of his shirt.
Steve’s frown is visible in spite of his mask, but he doesn’t say anything, just heads up the ramp into the jet. Something about the way he moves reminds Tony of nothing so much as an offended cat.
An hour into some event, and Steve still isn’t sure what it’s for. He’s thinks it’s a charity dinner, though there’s been no sign of either dinner or any kind of charity. If he’s right, he’s learned, they’ll eventually sit down to some sort of fancy meal, and all the speeches will be particularly self-congratulatory. If it’s for something besides charity, the speeches might actually reference whatever, or whomever, it’s for, and go on about that for a while before turning self-congratulatory. Either way, Steve hopes the food is better than the last event they attended. Maybe he’ll luck out again and there will be a false-alarm Avengers call-out, and by the time they figure out they don’t need to be there, it will be late enough that they can just go home. Maybe there will be a
“Pleased to meet you, Agent Godfrey,” Steve responds automatically, and she gives him a mock salute. “I’ll pack up a few things in the bedroom, if you’d like to start out here.”
“Jarvis, take a look at whatever’s still holding up Steve’s back pay. Have Pepper get Legal on it to make sure everything’s above board, but feel free to cut through any red tape that needs cutting if they get bogged down. Steve’s not going to be happy when he finds out it’s not SHIELD funding the Avengers, or his paycheck, or that apartment he was in, and he should have access to his own money, anyway.”
Tony shrugs. “It feels right,” he tells him. “I don’t know what this,” he gestures between them, “is. I don’t know what it can be, if we make it out of this. I know what I’d like it to be, but if that’s not something you want – if
Tony gives her a look he hopes properly conveys what he thinks of that, and how well it would go over. Jarvis knows how to send perfectly tactful e-mails, Tony’s not quite sure why Pepper’s always trying to make extra work for herself.
Ms. Potts’s face goes through several rapid expressions before settling into something oddly blank. “You’re asking Tony to go to dinner? Now?”
Rhodes watches him for a long moment, then nods. “Glad we had this talk,” he says. “I’m going to go make sure Tony isn’t goading the reporters too badly.” He takes off neatly, flying in the same direction Tony had taken.
Steve just shrugs. “Pretty sure he’d have to care for me to break him, anyway. I’m never sure he cares enough for anyone to break him. World threats, sure, but a single person?” Steve shrugs again, then eyes Fury speculatively. “Except maybe Ms. Potts?”
Tony glances up with a wry smile, then looks back down, starts moving the bits of bread around on his plate. “So kind of them not to want to interrupt our honeymoon.”
, any minute now. “I know,” he says, grips Rhodey’s wrists and hangs on for just a second. “And I appreciate it. I do. This is not what I thought I’d be doing with my life right now.”
cameras around. At least he’s not having flashbacks to being in a firefight every time a camera flash goes off in his face anymore – and he’s aware that Tony’s steady presence and efforts to physically shield Steve from the cameras, or at least put himself in the spotlight, have made a difference – but it’s still more than a little unsettling. He expects loud noises and bright lights in combat, but it’s harder to brace for it out of uniform.
“Well,” Tony says after a moment, voice low and rough. He clears his throat. “That was.” He clears his throat a second time. He’s still looking up at Steve from a scarce few inches away, eyes wide, the hint of a flush high on his cheeks. Steve wants to kiss him again. “Yes,” Tony says, and for a moment, Steve thinks he might have said something out loud, almost leans back in, but Tony keeps going. “That was good. Very. Convincing, I’m sure.” Tony drops his arms from where they were still wrapped around Steve and takes a half-step back, almost to the wall, and Steve wants to follow, push him back against it and – “Should buy us at least half an hour,” Tony adds, voice less strained now. “Maybe more. We can look around a bit and then head out early. The gossips will assume we’re just enjoying our reunion again in a more appropriate setting.” He waggles his eyebrows, and if it weren’t for the way he still looks halfway to wrecked, Steve would almost think he’d imagined the last several minutes.
people who knew me and cared about me,” Steve grits out. “What’s your excuse? You’re in your own damn time, and the only people who care about you are paid to care, or you built them. Everyone else just fakes it for their own ends. Isn’t that what happened with Stane? And McPherson?”
“But the apartment is there for him to use if he wants it,” Tony feels compelled to add. “He shouldn’t – don’t keep him out. It’s his. He should have a place to go, if he needs it, and it’s been set up, anyway.”
Steve’s mouth moves a little, like it would try for a smile in daylight, and he nods, pushing himself up and out of his chair. “Okay,” he repeats, and then goes about filling the kettle Tony didn’t even know they had with water, and setting it on the stove to boil while he pulls down two fresh mugs and sorts through the collection of teas Tony had also somehow missed. “Dr. Banner likes tea,” Steve says, like he can read Tony’s mind even with his back turned. “And Natasha. And Clint, actually. Thor won’t touch it, but that’s somehow not very surprising.”
“Thanks,” Steve responds automatically, feels his jaw loosen and his mouth curve into a smile like he’s already on camera. He hates how familiar it’s gotten again, as if he’s back on the bond sales circuit, only this time he’s trying to sell himself and Tony, and Tony’s not half as dependable as a bond.
It’s Steve’s turn to shake his head. He keeps his eyes focused on his own hands as he measures out the tea into a strainer, sets it carefully in a mug. “Europe,” he says eventually. “They always start easy. Not good memories, necessarily, or real memories at all, but not. Not bad. And then it all goes to hell.”
The sun has almost completely set by the time Steve makes his way back to the Tower. He’d returned after the fight just long enough to change out of his uniform before leaving again, needing to be somewhere where Tony was not, and not willing to risk running into the rest of the team, either. He’d spent the rest of the day wandering the city, had even gone out to Brooklyn. It hadn’t helped.
“Right.” Tony beats a hasty retreat back into the hallway and out to the landing pad. “On a scale of one to Hulk on a bad day, how upset is the Star-Spangled Man that he isn’t the one making the plan?” he asks Jarvis.
Pepper narrows her eyes a little bit more, and visibly restrains herself from launching back into it. “Shower,” she says firmly. She steps back out of his hold and makes shooing gestures with her hands.
“Right,” Steve says for the third time in as many minutes. He toes his shoes off in the corner of his room and starts pulling the Captain America uniform on. “Is the rest of the team up?”
allowed access to anything but the kitchen and living room on this level without express permission, Jarvis,” he says while he strips and gets into the shower. “And keep them out of my workshop.”
Before he can get distracted, or talk himself out of it, Tony pushes away from his workstation and goes Steve-hunting. Conveniently, Jarvis confirms that Steve is in the Tower, and directs Tony to find him in the penthouse library.
Pepper smirks. It’s a rare look for her, and while Tony probably won’t ever think she’s not gorgeous doing it, it gives him a deep sense of foreboding. “I don’t have the time, and public opinion improves when he’s wearing clothes that don’t look like he raided my father’s closet. There’s a pair of jeans in there that I highly recommend he wear next time you two go out on a more casual date. You’re welcome.”
“I’m fine,” Tony says, closes his eyes for a moment while Rhodey fiddles at his wrists, then forces himself to open them again, meet Rhodey’s gaze, and say it again. “I’m fine. We’ll do our song and dance, we’ll appease the voting and tax-paying public, and we’ll get out of this and go about our own lives again. I don’t expect anything from him. I’m working on being less of a dick,” he raises an eyebrow at Rhodey, because Rhodey had called it ‘pigtail pulling’ the night before, and Pepper tends to refer to it as him getting his hackles up, but Rhodey doesn’t say anything. “Hopefully, he will respond in kind, and we won’t end up killing each other.”
Tony opens his mouth to say something, anything, to make Steve look less like he might cry, but the collective shout and groan of the crowd draws Steve’s attention back to the game, and the moment passes. Tony breathes a silent sigh of relief, and makes a mental note about Steve and hockey.
“Only minor abrasions detected, Sir,” Jarvis replies promptly. “I would have notified you immediately had there been any significant injury.”
“Stop before you hurt yourself, Captain,” Fury cuts him off, pointedly eyes where Steve’s fingers are clenching around the edges of the table, “or anything else.”
“I’m flaunting my shiny new husband,” Tony murmurs back, smile locking into place as he looks somewhere past Steve. “It would be lovely if he’d stop trying to squirm away.” He pinches just above Steve’s hip. Hard. Steve jumps.
become home – or on the various other non-paparazzi-filled dates Ms. Potts has suggested over the last few weeks has been a bit of an eye-opener. Tony’s actually fun to be around, and Steve is starting to wonder how many of their fights have been because he took offense at something that wasn’t intended to offend, and Tony was just retaliating. Tony’s definitely more than a little abrasive, and his mind doesn’t work the same way Steve’s does, but if Steve doesn’t go in with his hackles already up, it’s surprisingly easy between them. Tony’s funny in ways Steve hadn’t expected, and it’s actually fascinating to listen to him talk. He’s also discovered Tony
It stretches longer than it should, and when it slows, when Steve pulls back and ghosts a touch over Tony’s face, across one cheekbone, Tony realizes he’s crying, feels the sting in his eyes and the dampness under Steve’s thumb, sees tracks on Steve’s cheeks, and doesn’t know when it happened, but he feels looser, somehow. Lighter. Wrung out, but like something’s been lifted.
Steve loosens his grip on Tony’s arm, but doesn’t let go. “I know this isn’t – it’s not a romantic relationship,” he says, looks like he’s struggling a little to figure out what he wants to say, or maybe just how to say it, “but we’ve been doing all right, out in public. Physically, I mean. I’ve,” Steve’s ears are bright red now, and there’s a distinct flush creeping up his neck and into his cheeks, but he pushes on. “I’ve enjoyed it, anyway, and you always seem to. So it wouldn’t be a hardship.”
And Tony’s out the door before Steve can say anything else, leaving Steve sitting on the edge of his bed with a handful of paperwork that says he can legally cheat on his husband, and no one will mind.
Steve is still seething when they get to the studio. He hadn’t seen Tony since he’d left him in the library the day before, and the picture-show smile Tony had greeted him with when they’d gotten in the car together set his teeth on edge. They hadn’t spoken, Tony too busy with his phone, and Steve staring out the window, watching the city slide by outside the tinted windows.
“Yes?” Steve echoes, and his hands have mostly stilled on Tony’s arms, but his thumbs are still sweeping up and down, restless like he can’t help it. And when Tony nods, isn’t sure he can get the words out again, a smile breaks over Steve’s face like the sun or some other damn cliché, and he uses his grip to tug Tony even closer. Slowly, like he’s afraid this isn’t what Tony meant by “yes” – or wants to give Tony time to pull away – he leans in and kisses Tony on the mouth.
“Tony,” Pepper sighs. “I know this is hard for you. I know this is the last thing you want to be doing. But something needs to be done, and you agreed to this –”
Steve reels back, then his spine straightens again. “Fuck you, Stark,” he says, voice tight, and turns on his heel and stalks off, around the quinjet still blocking the street, and past the SHIELD agents holding the perimeter.
Regardless of why Steve’s been doing it, the extra attention has Tony on edge. It has him wary in a way the snapping and yelling and disappointed looks hadn’t. And while Tony doesn’t
There are five bright points of heat where Steve’s fingertips are still pressed to skin, just below the rolled up sleeve of Tony’s shirt, and Tony
Natasha rolls her eyes at him. “They’ll just say we’re covering it up, or that even if that’s what the actual fight is about, the undercurrent is their differing moral standpoints.”
Slowly, Steve draws several deep breaths, opens his eyes, takes in the shadowy outlines of unfamiliar furniture.
Tony huffs, undoes the mess he’s made of his tie, and starts over. “We talked about this last night,” he points out, because they did. Ad nauseam.
“Right,” Coulson finally says. Steve manages to stop staring at the door long enough to swing back to face him. He doesn’t even look ruffled, something Steve envies. “This will have to happen quickly. A long engagement from this point will spark more rumors we don’t want. If we get it moving quickly, though, everyone will just assume it’s
“Great.” There’s a clang as the shield bounces off a wall, and an unpleasant crunch from the rat it hits. Steve gives a satisfied huff. “Any idea where they’re coming from?”
“Thank you,” Ms. Potts smiles. “There are a couple twitchy bits, and I’d like to have it set to sign before we hand it off to legal, since they’ll have so little time with it.”
The look on Pepper’s face is far too smug for Tony to deal with. “Get out,” he tells her, and she starts to laugh. “Steve Rogers can barely sit in a room and eat a meal with me, and you think his – his
A corner of the metal sticks into Tony’s thumb, and he hisses, sticks the digit in his mouth for a second, tastes metal and dirt, then squints at it to see if he’s bleeding. “Rhodey was here, and I’ve been working,” he tells his thumb, hoping it sounds less defensive out loud than it does in his head.
“We’ll see,” he agrees, lets Steve pull away and climb to his feet, takes the hand that’s offered so Steve can haul him upright. “Sleep?” he asks.
Steve thinks for a minute he means something specific, glances at the clock on the stove automatically, but it’s still the middle of the night. Then he realizes Tony just means he needs to do something with his hands, the way Steve sometimes will sketch when he wakes up in the middle of the night, needs something he knows how to control.
The locker room at SHIELD that has been set aside for the Avengers to use is oddly impersonal. It’s not something Steve ever noticed before, and he’s pretty sure nothing has changed in the last few weeks, but it’s bothering him, in a background irritant kind of way. Clint and Natasha haven’t seemed to notice, or, if they have, they haven’t said anything about it, chirping each other good naturedly through the partitions while they shower and change back into street clothes.
For a long minute, Steve says nothing, but he doesn’t look like he’s waiting for Tony to keep talking, he looks like he’s steeling himself for something.
actually managed to remember it, and maybe thought a ballgame would be a nice gift, he sure as hell wasn’t going to
“Of course,” like it’s just that easy. “Let me just,” Steve jerks his head back towards the bathroom, and Tony lets him go.
fought a war. My father, he fought in the First World War. The Great War. The war to end all wars – but that’s every war, isn’t it. The history books now, they say it was the cause of the Second World War. What did that cause? The Cold War? I told Fury, we didn’t fight to keep fighting. We fought to end it. But now I’m here,
Pepper makes a face like she’s chewing on the inside of her cheek, but she doesn’t contradict him, and, for that, he’s thankful. “Get some sleep,” is all she eventually says. “I know you’re working,” she continues before he can say it. “But you need to sleep.”
Tony scrubs at his hair. “They can do what they want with their own apartments,” he says after a minute. “Keep them out of Bruce’s lab, though, unless he specifically says otherwise. That’s a safe space for him. Full access to all the gyms and conference rooms downstairs, just make sure they get – and pay attention to – the warning spiel if they want to use the training simulator. Pretty sure we don’t carry minced superhero insurance. Maybe have Pepper look into that?”
Flashes start going off the moment Steve steps out of the limo. He leans back down to offer Ms. Potts a hand, but Tony takes it instead, and Steve can see Ms. Potts nudging him forward even as she narrows her eyes at Steve over Tony’s head. Her injunction to “ramp up the couple-ness, every time you are anywhere together,
Automatically, Steve gets to his feet as Tony reaches him, then realizes he doesn’t know what to do. He can’t exactly shake Tony’s hand in greeting, not with all of these witnesses, not now, and he’d just seen the man yesterday, anyhow. And this is a date, he knows it is, but he’s pretty sure he can’t just pull Tony’s chair out for him, either.
Steve relaxes minutely. It’s unlikely Ms. Potts would be present if there had been an alarm. “Thank you, Jarvis,” he says automatically. “Nothing too serious, I hope?”
“Sleep,” Steve nods, gives him a shy smile that looks a little odd on his face, but Tony thinks it was probably a lot more common before he knew him, before the ice, before the war, before the serum.
“Please, don’t,” he says, leans a little into Steve’s touch, puts the hand he’d been holding up on Steve’s shoulder, feels the heat of his skin through the stretched-tight cotton, lets those  points of contact ground him. “I’m glad you told me. I can’t,” he closes his eyes briefly, then opens them again to Steve looking concerned again. “I can’t really process all of this right now. I just keep thinking – I blamed him, my father, for years. I thought. He was driving, must have been drunk, and he drove them right off the road and killed her. And I know that when everything else we’re dealing with is done – if we survive it – I’ll have to deal with this. But right now, all I can think is that
“Don’t let this idiot drag you in,” she warns, jerking her thumb at Clint, who pretends to look wounded.
Possible. Steve is all about Doing Good, and he’s also the type to get a sort of vindictive pleasure out of a place like Maria’s, that sells High Society cast-offs to the middle upper echelons of society for obscene prices, and then donates all the proceeds to a handful of homeless shelters around the city. “Worth a shot,” Tony concedes, and waves Pepper off to her meeting.
The greenroom they’re asked to wait in feels somehow too stuffy, too small for the two of them, but Steve sits silently while one of the makeup artists pokes at his face, instead of asking to wait somewhere outside. Not that there’s anywhere he could go outside. There was already a crowd when they arrived, and if the handful of interviews they’ve done so far are anything to go on, it’s only going to get worse until they leave.
“So a marriage is more believable?” Steve’s not quite sure what to make of that. The logic seems right, but what they’re discussing
Steve suppresses a sigh. “I’ll just see myself out, then,” he says to no one, and turns back towards the door in the glass wall and the elevator beyond.
Pepper holds his gaze for a long moment, then nods decisively. “Tell me if it’s a problem, and I will deal with it.”
“You’re never too old for daydreams,” she tells him tartly, “and you’ve been known to believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast – and make them possible by lunch.”
Pepper’s expression gets a little soft, and a little sad. “That’s not true,” she says. “There’s so much to you, Tony, and so much to love.”
Tony scowls, but the facemask snaps shut over it, and he takes a hopping step back before kicking off the ground, heading for the southwest corner of the park.
“Please don’t turn off my music,” he mutters, doesn’t even bother to speak loudly enough for her to ignore.
“Noted, sir,” Jarvis replies. “Ms. Potts has already added it to your calendar, along with the usual alerts for you to ignore at your convenience.”
There’s a roar of repulsors before Steve’s moved more than a couple steps, louder than usual, and Rhodes is swooping in, War Machine armor making more noise than the Iron Man armor ever does. There’s an incredible crash and the screech of metal on metal as Rhodes halts Tony’s graceless tumble, placing himself firmly in Tony’s path and bracing.
“Our foes have forfeited,” Thor announces. The lightning has vanished from the sky entirely, but Steve thinks Thor is probably still somewhere out on the edge of the park.
“What the hell?” In the abrupt silence, Barton’s voice is loud, clearly audible in the tunnel as well as over the comms.
Steve shakes his head, but Tony can’t tell if it’s a denial. “I’m afraid you won’t be there.” Steve’s voice is low, a little strangled. “What if I reach out –” he does, hand hovering about halfway between them, “– and you’re not really there? What if you vanish before I get there?”
“There are two camps,” Banner puts in, and why does everyone seem to know what’s going on but Steve? “Half the country thinks you’re the only thing standing between them and the destruction of all their so-called Family Values – they want Tony off the team, thinks he’ll corrupt everyone with his deviant ways.” Tony snorts, but doesn’t interrupt. “The other half think you’re a bigot, can’t believe you’re allowed to represent our country, and want to get rid of you before you drag us all back to the Middle Ages.”
“Was there –” Steve starts to ask, stops. “I know this isn’t going to be easy,” he says at last, makes sure he’s meeting Tony’s eyes. “We don’t always see things the same way.”
“I didn’t say it was just about the two of you getting hitched,” Rhodey points out, and kindly doesn’t say anything about the way Tony twitches. “The man has been through a lot, and it’s not going to get fixed in a month, or a year, or even a few years. He’s handling it all a lot better than I would, but he’s still dealing with it, and that’s going to come out in some not-so-pretty ways, sometimes.”
Not that Tony’s never thought about it. He and Pepper even talked about it at one point, when they were still in their honeymoon phase and it seemed like things between them were really going to work. It’s just that he hadn’t thought about it with
“I feel it.” Steve’s voice is soft, but clear. He’s staring at his hand, fingertips curling in just a little like he’s trying to hold on. “I feel it.” He looks up, then, motion almost sharp, and meets Tony’s eyes. Tony can’t read his face in the dark, but Steve doesn’t seem to have the same trouble. “I missed you, too,” he says, and kisses him.
– just the way you’re a goddamned hypocrite every time you get your righteous panties in a bunch when you don’t get a daily memo detailing everyone’s every thought.”
“Her legal background is legitimate, and we don’t want to bring the company lawyers in yet. We’ll have them go over everything just before the wedding, after the news has been leaked, but we want something solid prepared before then.”
It’s a quick flight, so Tony doesn’t have long to dwell – or try to come up with ways to incorporate better sensory feedback ports into the suit – and they land only just ahead of Barton, Natasha, and a handful of SHIELD agents.
Tony laughs, though, light and easy. “We didn’t get much of a Valentine’s Day,” he says. “Had a nice breakfast together, but we both had to work,” he shakes his head like it was some kind of tragedy, and for a moment Steve forgets he’s still angry in his relief that Tony’s managed to strike the right chord between the truth and what viewers are probably looking for. “I don’t think I got to see this guy more than a few minutes at a time in passing until dinner,” Tony’s hand lands just above Steve’s knee, and he squeezes a little.
Pepper’s frowning again. “Did he move downstairs to his own apartment?” she wants to know, and there’s clearly a right answer and a wrong answer here, but Tony doesn’t know.
“Who says I didn’t have it planned?” Tony wants to know, smooth like he has a script, then shrugs, as if there was a cue somewhere. “Steve’s not really an ‘excessive plans’ kinda guy. He likes things simple.” Tony squeezes Steve’s knee again, which makes the heat rush back into Steve’s cheeks.
, even though that’s what he’s thinking. “The Tower’s not that far. We can head in that direction. Let’s just walk?”
With a firm kick, Tony sends his sheets to the end of the bed, and tips himself over the edge and onto his feet. He trips across the carpet, catches himself on the doorframe with one hand.
“Pepper, what –” Tony starts again, but the images are already flickering to life around them, and. Oh.
“Sorry,” Tony casually silences the alert and pushes back from the table. “It’s just an Avengers thing, carry on. You’ll let me copy your notes later, right, Ms. Potts?”
Steve plays with the patchwork quilt spread under him, tracing shapes with just the tips of his fingers. It’s distracting, the way his fingers move across the fabric. Tony can see the threads catching at his skin, wonders if the roughness is just from calluses or something else, wants to reach out and touch, find out for himself.
“No, Agent, that was me,” Jarvis’s voice announces, at the same time Ms. Potts says, “No, Jarvis does that.”
Ignoring the heat crawling up the back of his neck, Steve shuts off the stovetop, casting about for something to do with the eggs, which are still mostly liquid. “Right. Thank you, Jarvis. Is there something –”
“Not a thing, Jarvis. That’s a direct order. I don’t want this getting any more awkward than it is, we’re already pushing disaster levels, here, without further complications. I’ll get over it, and I’ll deal with it in private until I do.”
“Fuck, Steve,” Tony pants against Steve’s mouth, swallows Steve’s reply, and then he’s shaking apart, scarcely registers when Steve goes still above him, following him over.
Tony grins back, friendly and comfortable. “Went out for a nice dinner – haven’t you seen the pictures? I’ve been assured they only got my good side.”
Coulson waves it off, now flipping through a stack of files he’s cleared space on the table for. “That can be one of the things they’ve been arguing about,” he says. “Which is, after all, the purpose behind all of this.” He pulls a folder from the pile to pass to Ms. Potts.
“You’re Captain America’s husband now,” she reminds him. “Wow them with what a good influence he is.”
“Jarvis?” Steve asks as he steps out of his room again once he’s dressed. “Is Tony in his workshop?” He probably should have said something before – a greeting, if nothing else – but he’s still not entirely used to the AI, and he gets the impression Jarvis isn’t overly fond of him, anyway.
“I remember the days when that wasn’t a sentence that would have happened,” Barton sounds a little wistful. Tony can relate. “Those were good times.”
“Got it,” Bruce says. “Thanks, Jarvis.” And Tony can hear the tapping of fingers on a keyboard as he starts to sift through the footage on his end.
Tony hesitates another moment, but everyone’s now watching him expectantly, so he rounds the couch and settles carefully between Natasha and Steve, still feeling like he’s intruding. They’re never all in the same room together on purpose, unless they’ve been practically ordered to be, and yet here they are, having a movie night while he’s supposed to be out of the country.
doesn’t particularly like art, not the kind of art found in a museum like the Met, anyway, and it’s not like Steve would want to go to a museum with him, in any case. Only then Steve had
This groundbreaking statement is met with nothing but the continued sound of fighting for a long moment, then, “What are you talking about?” Natasha asks.
Ms. Potts takes the folder, but doesn’t open it. “Given Tony’s track record and Captain Rogers’s reputation – sorry, Captain – it would seem like a good idea to keep things private, even after an engagement. It would make sense not to publicize it and have it destroyed by the media.” She looks at Tony, who shrugs, and she goes on, though her voice tightens. “Trent McPherson is a perfect example of why relationships don’t need to be flaunted about, not only while he was actively in Tony’s life, but immediately following, and everything that’s been going on lately.”
Steve catches the look Tony sends him, like he knows exactly what he’s doing, and he’s daring Steve to say something about it in front of these people he doesn’t know. It’s possible this is retaliation for more than just the height crack, but Steve gets the feeling he’s going to regret the decision to stop holding hands.
“I have a lot of interesting conversations with Steve,” Natasha says carefully. “You’ll have to be more specific than that.”
It’s a perfect day for a ballgame, sunny and warm without being unpleasantly humid. The Mets aren’t scoring, but the Cubs aren’t really, either, just the one in the first, and Tony isn’t really invested either way. Steve loves all baseball – a surprising number of the stories he’s told Tony that don’t involve him getting his ass kicked revolve around him sneaking into Ebbets Field as a kid (though the two don’t seem to be mutually exclusive). He seems to be testing where his loyalties will end up, now the Dodgers are in California. He hasn’t completely given up on them, he says, but it’s not the same. He’s tentatively rooting for the Mets, so Tony figured a Mets game would be the way to go. Tony’d contemplated flying them out to LA for a game, but didn’t think Steve would take that very well, and all of their upcoming functions are in New York, so Tony doesn’t even have that as an excuse to get them out there. The one thing Steve
“Huh,” Tony flicks his fingers apart for a better view of the joint on the prosthetic he’s been trying to realign. “Has it been that long?”
Steve had darted a quick glance at Tony, who had been staring pointedly out one tinted window, but Steve saw him mouth the word
“You keep trying to play the hero, someone’s going to wind up hurt.” Steve gestures at Tony’s arm, “Maybe this isn’t bad, but you keep acting like you can do everything, and it’ll be worse. Might not even be you. You dragged Rhodes in last time, who’s next? If you’d think about someone besides yourself for one damned second, this wouldn’t happen.”
Hands are grasping Tony’s shoulders, shaking him, and Tony looks up, and up, into blue, blue eyes. Tony blinks, and Steve’s face comes into focus, very close to his own. “Steve?”
Steve gives himself a bit of a mental shake, and closes his sketchpad, shifting to sit sideways on his bed, feet on the floor. “Of course, come in.”
He rolls his eyes. “Don’t leave sweatmarks on my chairs,” he tells them, and leaves before he can get sucked into an argument about privacy and kitchen rights.
Eventually, Steve finds himself outside a café he’s been to at least a dozen times. It’s usually packed in the morning, but this late in the afternoon there are only a handful of people inside. He orders a drink and settles in at one of the tables, a sketchbook from his bag open in front of him.
here by something, and they’re growing into these fanged and furry pieces of terrifying when they get within a certain radius of whatever is doing the summoning. There’s no lab or workshop or evil zoo somewhere making these things and setting them loose. They’re only here. And I know this,” he continues, “because I can see them coming, and they’re not like this anywhere else, but they’re all coming
Not the greatest dinner conversation, but, Steve figures, at least they’re less likely to start an actual fight over their appetizers.
,” Tony grits out, barely refrains from swearing at him, and Steve kisses him again, the curve of his lips against Tony’s.
Tony blinks and takes several breaths, too shallow, hopes it’s not obvious how difficult it is to try to draw them in fully. “Oh. Right.”
“That’s what they all say,” Tony jokes, but he seems at ease in a way he hasn’t for their other interviews.
“Fine,” Steve replies automatically, and tries not to wince when Tony’s expression turns skeptical. “This isn’t exactly my idea of a fun time,” he allows, “but I’ve survived before, and I’ll survive again.”
do – but in that moment, she’s somehow far more terrifying than Rhodes had been. It reminds him more than a little of Peggy, and he’s fiercely – and surprisingly – glad that Tony has a friend like Ms. Potts in his corner, and simultaneously wishes very much that he was somewhere else.
“It would appear there are alligators in the sewers, Sir.” Jarvis sounds embarrassed to even be saying it.
The gallery is packed with a magazine’s worth of Who’s Who of the New York socialite scene, and Steve’s a little disconcerted to realize he’s starting to not only recognize people, but have individual opinions about them. They’re not all bad, and he gets the feeling that he might even like some of them under different circumstances. Under the flashing lights of the paparazzi cameras and the sharp eyes of their peers, however, he can’t help but find them boring at best, and downright offensive at worst. He wonders if Tony feels like this all the time, like he’s about to scream at the hypocrisy all around them, or if he doesn’t notice anymore, after a lifetime in the spotlight. He wonders if this is why Tony always has a drink in hand at these events.
Tony’s nodding. “She always asked what the point of having money was, if you weren’t going to help people with it. Granted, she loved her fancy parties, but she always donated her party clothes after she wore them. She said Society would never let her live it down if she wore something twice, and there was no point letting things just sit around getting dusty in her closet.” There’s a look on Tony’s face that Steve doesn’t think he’s seen before, almost soft. He doesn’t quite know what to do with that. “And Steve, of course,” Tony’s face clears and he looks at Steve, shakes his hand a little, “always wants to help, so it seemed appropriate.”
“I slept with Katie on and off for half a semester, and I still get Christmas cards from her every year,” Tony reminds him. “Her oldest is starting college next fall.”
Tony snorts, and barrels through half a dozen rats blocking the train on the side closest to the tunnel exit. “Jay, give us the cameras from the subways and whatever you’ve got at street level, starting with SHIELD’s perimeter, and moving out.”
Whatever the reason, Tony has been feeling more like a teenager around his crush than ever the last few days, swinging between elated when Steve’s actually around and in his space, and supremely confused and grumpy when he’s not. It hasn’t been good for his focus, especially when Steve is actually in the workshop with him, chatting casually with Dummy or Butterfingers like they’re old friends. Pepper walked in on one such conversation, and the look she’d given Tony said she knew he was gone. It had not been encouraging.
Steve remembers arguing about the suits, but he doesn’t remember Tony ever saying they’d been sold for charity. Something that feels an awful lot like guilt twists in his stomach. “The name must have slipped my mind,” is all he says.
They’re a couple blocks away from the Tower when Steve steers them off the street and into Bryant Park. It’s only a little patch of green compared to Central Park, but it’s not bad for Manhattan. Steve’s sat around watching games of chess and backgammon more than once before, figures he’ll probably be spending more time here now that he lives so close. He hopes he will, anyway, there’s something almost peaceful about it, a muffling of sound in spite of the traffic all around. He can feel some of the stress easing out of his neck and shoulders, steals periodic sidelong glances at Tony to see if he minds the detour, but Tony seems content to just walk and not question it.
“They couldn’t pry me away with a crowbar,” Tony tells him, tightens his grip so Steve knows he’s not joking.
Then, very abruptly, there’s nothing to fight anymore. The dozens of regular-sized pigeons that were just a moment ago massive and hell-bent on destruction scatter. Most disappear into the trees, while the rest just drop to the ground, making their odd cooing noises as they peck at the ground for crumbs as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened.
“You’ve been involved with a number of local charities in the last year or so,” Mr. Cooper prompts, “Can you take us through how you chose them? And what you do with them?”
“I’ve got the B train,” Steve catches a rat on his shield, tosses it back into the wall with a thud. “Who’s got the 4?”
That’s not at all what Steve thought she was going to say. He opens his mouth to protest, because he might not have any idea what’s going on, but he knows Tony’s not weak, and she cuts him off before he can get anything out.
“Very good, Sir. Ms. Potts has agreed to notify the Legal team regarding investigating Captain Rogers’s army pay, but would like it known that this is not something she feels you or the company should be involved in.”
“The good memories. The not-bad memories. When you have them. If you have them. Do they help? Seeing people. Knowing you remember them. Even if there’s nobody else left who does.”
Tony doesn’t turn, picks up the gauntlet he’d been working on and inspects it to make sure dropping it to the table hadn’t caused any damage. “An NDA only covers the person who signs it. There are fewer eyes on you, and those that are have no reason to be suspicious to begin with. Even if someone did say something, no one would believe it without proof. And even the sleaziest of gossip rags won’t pick up a story on Captain America cheating based on a rumor.”
Steve’s nostrils flare, but all he says is, “I’ll wear one of the suits from the last few weeks, then. I only wore that blue one once.”
“You said something about going to get the marriage license?” Steve asks. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Tony twitch.
“You suggest what?” Steve demands, loud enough to drown Tony out. “You waltz around like you’re so much better, decide everything just belongs to you, because, what, you’ve always just been given anything you wanted? So you can just keep taking?”
Tony gives her a grin. “When am I not?” he asks, steps into the elevator, and gives her a wave as the doors close on her indignant expression. The grin slides off his face as the elevator starts moving, and he sags momentarily against the wall. As much as he’s glad to be away from the Slideshow of Never-ending Graphs, he’s tired, and behind on half a dozen projects, and the meeting was supposed to be a mostly-uninterrupted hour of quiet work on his phone while a slew of people managed to make math boring in the background.
Right up until the massive birds decide they’re tired of being shot at, and several dozen draw up in a flock to swarm the easiest target, which, of course, is Steve. Everything vanishes under dirty grey feathers and clawed feet. Steve has a minute to think how embarrassing it would be to survive a war, being frozen for seventy years, and an alien invasion, only to be taken down by what Bucky’s mother always called flying rats.
“Something you two have in common,” Mr. Cooper says, gestures at Steve. “I hear you both donated your suits from last week’s premier to Maria’s?”
It takes an effort not to turn to look for the camera. Instead, Tony tips his head back a little to look up at Steve, the smile he digs up not feeling quite as forced as usual.
