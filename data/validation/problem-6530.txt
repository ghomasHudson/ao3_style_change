Tony casually attached cuff links to his dress shirt while speaking, “Long enough to know that I want to buy you hundreds of lingerie sets. I called you a couple of times and you didn’t answer,” he gave Steve a once over, then continued “but now I see why you didn’t.”
Tony spits a mouth full of blood and breathes heavily. The coppery taste worsens his nausea, but he fights to hold it in. Still, when he spits out another mouthful of blood, he finds it's mixed with some bile. A grimace stays on his face as he makes himself look away from the mess. His brain is running a million miles a minute and he has so many questions, but it all comes out like word vomit, much like his physical reaction.
He’d arrived at the agreed place a bit earlier than the man he was supposed to meet up with,  whose name was Steve Rogers. Blond hair, blue eyes, ex-military and now a freelance artist. It was surprising to find such a gem. They talked long enough to figure both weren’t creepy fucks, and decided on a date to meet.
Tony was done for. He cried out in pain while coming in his slacks. The sensation licking up his spine ruthlessly, his mind drawing a blank although he was aware of his body. He could feel himself coming and coming to the point where he was concerned he’d be dry from now on, and God the ache in his ribs bloomed across his chest and made his legs weak. He could feel the relief in his balls as he released, that pain that didn't subside even after an intense masturbation session or a decent one night stand. It was fucking beautiful, his vision being momentarily obstructed from closing so intensely, knowing Steve was watching him as he huffed and lifted his hips,
“Get dressed and be on your way. You should get some rest, because I want to hear the first rule again next time, and want it to sound believable. Speaking of rest, rule eight, about being healthy, is something I’m going to help you better work on because you were up damn late last night. And I have a feeling that's not the only time you've been up late. We’ll discuss schedules tomorrow. Get dressed, and no whining- I can see it about to happen.”
As Tony got undressed, he could feel Steve’s eyes burning a hole through through him, his face tightly locked in a peering stare. Tony’s fingers trembled under the weight of being studied, refusing to make eye contact. He didn’t know what Steve had in mind, but if he had planned on Tony reciting the rule naked and magically not feel awkward then he was wrong.
“Has anyone ever told you how good you look in that uniform? And I can’t help it, I tend to be, over what I want.”
Tony knew Steve wanted to act on the fact that he was achingly hard to the point of pouting like a five year old. Nonetheless, Steve smirked and looked towards the door.
Again, the word honest was spoken, and Tony nearly tensed at that question. What exactly were his limitations? It took him a minute to think it over a bit before coming up with something that did make him slightly nervous.
Tony chuckled, almost cunningly, “I knew you’d like that idea, but you wouldn’t be allowed to come, not until I'd get my hands on you and fuck you. Those panties would be soaked through by then, huh?”
The schedule didn’t cover times when they’d meet up or talk on the phone, which Tony found a bit strange, considering that he thought rule eight, be healthy, was for the benefit of his sub role. When he asked this question, Steve huffed out a laugh and said it was Tony’s sake outside of their Dom/sub relationship, that he genuinely wanted Tony to be healthier. Tony may or may not have felt a bit silly after that. Steve cared, and it’s not that he wasn’t used to having someone care about him, because he had friends who deeply cared for him. Tony was still new to Steve, new to the intimacy of it all, it felt good and foreign all at once.
He nodded, “I had a line prepared and everything,” Tony cleared his throat. "I don’t mean to be disrespectful, officer handsome, but goddamn I want, like, three of you.”
“Stark, I’m working,” Steve says, firm yet distant. Tony has to admit, Steve is probably working, but then, he’s also willing to bet that Steve’s probably read over the same sentence five times since Tony’s come in.
Steve walked over to Tony, just as unhurried as before, and slide his fingers into the hair on the nape of Tony’s neck before gripping firmly, thought it wasn't firm enough to hurt. Tony could feel the leather of Steve’s gloves brush against his skin and rub, making him sigh.
“We’re about to step out in five minutes,” Tony took a few steps forward, they were slow and steady. Every step put emphasis on how well Tony’s suit of choice fit him.
Steve—it can't possibly be his Steve. He feels nauseous again, but he’s afraid of showing any vulnerability that could allude to him being weak (despite being chained up and possibly playing at the hands of some grander scheme). He could possibly negotiate; maybe this Steve is a clone, but how?
“Yeah…but like you said, nothing serious, alright?” He means it too, he has no interest in Tony in that way and he doubts he ever would. He just could use a helping hand besides his own in the bedroom. And for some reason, he wants Tony on the receiving end. Steve’s not in the business of propositioning any man for sex, but Tony’s not just any man.
Slowly, he crept his hands in his pants. He felt Steve shift beside him a few times, probably trying to get comfortable as well.
He could almost feel jagged nails scrape along his scalp softly then grip his hair, because if Tony was up for a challenge Steve would readily give him one. Tony’s torso lifted and his thighs were shaking, sweat slicking against his chest and back causing the once loose-fitting shirt to stick to his now clammy skin. His left hand was stroking fast enough to create consistent smacking sounds because of his hand tightly coiled around his cock hitting his pelvis so rapidly.
All had gone well, until Tony knelt down to tie his shoes in preparation for the walk back home. At first Tony thought it was his imagination, the sun rising causing a distortion of shadows, but when Tony looked closer he’d noticed something else had risen too. Tony’s first reaction was to point it out subtly and joke about it, and just as a smile reached his face it fell.
He’d gotten to know a lot more about Steve, too. He learned a bit about his military background, and his job as an artist. He was a lover of anything vintage, his music taste that of an old man, but again, Tony liked it. He liked Steve’s grounded nature, his dry wit was a plus, and saying he was easy on the eyes was a huge understatement. It was rare that Tony appreciated the person someone was, but this was one of those rare cases; a start in the right direction. Even if a thought crossed his mind that this one might work out.
Tony hears the squirt of the lubrication coming out of the tube; he pushes his ass out further so Steve can get a good grip on his hips. Slowly Steve presses himself in, and Tony stiffens and moans all at once. It’s fantastic, edges of pain that mingles with pleasure, and leaves him wanting more. Before he can press his ass back to match Steve’s thrusts, Steve pulls his hair again. Tony’s back arches and his knees buckle, he grips the desk firmer, and that same grin from earlier reappears on his face.
A harsh back hand before letting him go, and it stung in the best of ways. Tony groaned into it, feeling a tight coil in his stomach that indicated
Take care he thought to himself. Tony pulled away and casually opened one of his drawers, then another, a smirk playing at his lips at the sight of various organized lingerie items. Steve watched Tony take it all in, then look back at him. Their gaze was even and lust filled, broken by Tony, who walked out and shut Steve’s door.
part of him kicked in, Steve once again grabbed his cock. This time firmer than the sweatpants episode. Slowly Tony lifted his head, and was met with the smuggest smirk and most mischievous glint in Steve's eyes.
Tony was close to probably the most wonderful orgasm he'd ever had in his life, and then Steve removed himself entirely, leaving Tony to whimper pathetically on the floor. Steve stood up, walking off enough to get a full view of Tony. Lips parted and bloody, pupils blown, legs shaking, sucking in huge gasps as if he was trying to collect himself, so enticing. So pathetic.
God his reaction was the best. Tony had the slightest tremor that went through him and Steve was fully hard by that point. Something about him showing some level of vulnerability was enough to shake Steve at his core. There was no time for the bed or for finding some accommodating place for Tony to be bent over; Steve occupied the wall just fine.
“You’ve got to be good for me and take it. Don’t you want to be good for me?” It comes out smoother than Steve expects. He'd felt himself wanting to stutter the obscene words, it’s slightly embarrassing how often he’s said things similar to that and how filthy he still feels. Tony’s reaction is even filthier
Tony flickered his gaze to the basket of bread he’d been tempted to grab before Steve arrived. “I’m not exactly well versed. I’ve done some research, but the doms I’ve encountered weren’t the best, to put it kindly.”
As Steve tried to formulate a response, Tony sipped on his scotch. The grin on his face distorted by the glass being put up to his lips.
Steve nodded stiffly, curiosity outweighing the nervousness, and the hand to his crotch gave him all the answers he needed. The blond gasped, arching into Tony’s palm and hoping to god he wouldn’t stop.
Tony stills. Out of everything that’s transpired, this has to be the most terrifying thing of it all. His Steve seeing him like this... Steve walks off but his voice carries over. “I hope to see you again.”
“I do not have an accent,” Steve was mostly lying to himself, and Tony sensed it, rolling his eyes. “And ya coulda just told me. Woulda given ya more props. I know how mucha love role playin’.”  Steve’s hands dragged down the length of Tony’s spine.
Tony brain was still foggy, but he did what he was told, excited for what was to come. Reward rung in his ears and admittedly coddled his pride, but most importantly, Steve was pleased. He was probably grinning like an idiot.
“I’ll be sure to keep you updated on my misfortunate dating adventures.” He’d probably have to keep his self-deprecation in check when meeting Steve again. The man seemed as if he had a sort of comforting confidence, as if he knew himself enough to express himself through lines and canvas. Tony hung up, suddenly feeling a sense of dread about their next meeting.
He looked directly at Steve, unlike how he'd previously done it. His voice was steady and unyielding, and he amazed himself with just how well he’d managed to fit in this role. He’s never wanted to please anyone so badly before, and yet there he was, wanting Steve to know he could be patient with him and that he would be. That, at the end of the day, it only mattered to him if Steve was satisfied, and with the grin that slowly made its way onto Steve’s features, Tony knew he’d done well this time.
Steve pulled out a pen from his pocket and outstretched Tony’s palm, writing down his number with a smile plastered on his face.
He’s not sure why Tony's complied to his demand. He hadn't argued, and he looks downright eager, awaiting further commands. Steve sits back in his chair, but swivels it towards the man currently in his black boxers and nothing else.
Tony has a routine. Some parts of it are more essential than others. Jarvis would kick out whoever was a part of last night’s fling, Tony drinks out of the bottle of whatever his liquor of choice might have been for that night. Forcibly, he stumbles out of bed and throws up--chemo always leaves him nauseous--then he washes away the previous day in a long hot shower.
This is when the game begins. The doors shut behind him, and Tony runs a finger over the mahogany desk Steve is sitting at. Steve’s pretending that he’s not there, and Tony doesn’t buy it for one second. Someone has to talk first, and it’s almost always Steve grunting an insult or some form of a challenge to make Tony push. Tony thinks he does it on purpose.
He smells like expensive cologne mixed with whiskey, just the way Steve hates it. Nevertheless, he always looks polished. Despite the dark circles around his eyes and his exhausted state of being, he’s well put together, not that he's planning to look that way for long. He steps into the oval office like he does any other day, when his schedule isn’t flooded (or rather, when he decides some people are worth ignoring).
Walking out the door and partially feeling as if today he’d made progress. At least to him he did. Listening to a voice outside of the one in his head that always accused him of making mistakes was a enough for now.
He opted for another approach, because at the moment he just wanted Tony bent over, pretty face contorted into a mix of pleasurable emotions, and pull the soft black strands atop of his head.
Once the uniform is clean,  he burns out his cigarette Tony keeps their eyes locked for a moment, as if waiting for further direction and domination—or maybe wondering what he’s gotten into. Regardless of what it was, Steve has plans to use him thoroughly, and he’d rather not waste time. “Up,” Steve says, and Tony immediately lifts himself off the ground and stands. He’s shaking, tremors leading up his thigh and through his fingertips.
Tony could understand that. The man didn’t seem like the type to have frequent flings, but that was just an observation. He didn’t exactly look intense as much as knowing what he wanted.
Ten minutes into the speech, Tony slams his hand onto his desk like a petulant child begging for attention. “Are you listening to me? I’m not one for repeating myself.”
“Fuck!” Tony called out, his head flying back and hitting the floor with a thud. Steve was nearly crushing his dick with his super soldier fucking knee, and Tony was enjoying every second of it. Tears began to form in the corners of his eyes, he couldn't stop them from streaking down his cheeks.
Steve reaches over to his desk and squirts a bit more lube onto his fingers, shifting Tony's weight back a bit, so he can lubricate his cock. He then picks Tony up and pushes him down onto his cock, this time not as slow as before. Tony chokes out a sound and clutches his stomach. “S-So deep,” he manages. Steve thrusts up and Tony nearly doubles over, tearing up and trying to talk, but it comes out broken and cracked. Steve moves Tony’s hand, tracing a finger from his pelvis to his tummy then keeping eye contact with the pathetic man on his cock.
Strong hands pulling his hair, gagging around Steve’s cock, and when it’s all said and done Steve would come down his throat so that Tony'd have no choice but to swallow. The thought alone made Tony let out a choked cry, stilling his hips in the air as he came into his palm. Just in that moment, Tony pressed his fingers deeper into his mouth, nearly choking himself as drool spilled down the side of his mouth.
Steve hasn’t said anything at this point, he didn’t know if this damned him more but he didn’t know what to say. He’d wanted to see how far he could go to break Tony for so long, that he didn’t know what to do with this. Why now? What had he noticed? More importantly, why couldn’t he bring himself to say yes?
“Forget I asked, Steve.” Was the last time Tony had mentioned it, before walking off and never speaking about it again.
Between four to five pots of coffee a day, and large stacks of paper, sometimes those basic necessities got away from him. Steve made him a schedule of when he should be eating, three times a day (do people seriously do that?) and cutting everything off at 11:30 p.m, or at the latest, midnight (unless something else demands his attention i.e a function or, well, Steve).The schedule covered breaks in between grueling papers (five to ten minutes), beside the times where he should be eating ‘try to eat a vegetable’ was highlighted, which made Tony frown; lettuce on a burger totally counted as a vegetable.
“Y-You— jerk—oh god!” Tony managed between rasped breaths, and Steve was sure that was supposed to come out more potent.
“Patience; To the submissive, I say this: A potential Dominant will let you know if She or He is interested in you or not. Keep in mind that your purpose as a submissive is to serve and to satisfy someone who will take into consideration the realisation of your fantasies. Don’t expect your Dominant to be able to turn on like a light switch. The timing must be right for both of you.”
“Don’t look so proud of yourself honey. You know how worked up I get,” Tony says defensively. Steve doesn’t reply, instead he grabs at Tony’s chin and kisses him, ignoring the fact that Tony had just swallowed a load of his come. He can taste himself and it’s filthy, but so damn good. Their tongues lap against one another's, playful but intent. He feels his cock growing hard again, just from thinking about how he’s stooped so low for a man willing to stoop lower than low. When he pulls away Tony looks as if he’s not done yet, his eyes blown with lust, hair disheveled (because of Steve’s rough-handling) and biting his lower lip deliberately to get a rise out of him.
And why would Steve need a picture when he's planning on Tony wearing lingerie more often than not? Tony walks up to him slowly, his hips rocking from side to side hypnotising with each passing step and leaving Steve breathless. Tony settles on his lap, a knee on either side of him and biting his lower lip. Steve instinctively grabs a handful of his ass and massages it gently, then accenting the touch with a firm slap.
Tony nods slowly, and then whines when Steve lifts him and pulls him off of his cock. “If your legs aren’t going to stay open, you can leave.” Tony is still trembling; come drips down his thigh and his eyes rimmed red, yet his eyelids hang low. He gets on top of the desk and spreads his legs, pushing two fingers into his come filled hole. Slowly he pulls them out then licks over them seductively; his eyes flutter up to Steve’s. It’s filthy, a display of someone wanting to be treated like they’re worthless.
The briefing is just that, brief. Schematics on their next upcoming mission. Another perfect distraction for Steve. He keeps avoiding eye contact with Tony, feeling guilt ebb at him a bit, but also not feeling guilty at all. Still, being conflicted alone makes him want to avoid all contact. Tony looks crisp as usual, although the bags underneath his eyes tell a different story. After the meeting Steve makes his way towards the door, the mission doesn’t start for another few days so he, again, has time to kill.
“Ya couldn't have just texted me? What the hell are ya doing up at 3 a.m anyways? Aren’t ya going to work in 4 hours?” Steve’s Brooklyn accent seeped into his voice, and Tony had to suppress the slew of inappropriate thoughts.
They’d discussed the few questions Tony had about the rules, all of them having the recurring theme; were they now considered to be in a relationship. Steve told him it didn’t have to be defined now, that technicalities could be worked out further down the line, but it didn’t mean he couldn’t follow the rules. Tony wouldn’t fathom it; the fact that they had a set of rules made him uneasy, yes, but still curious.
Steve let a not quite full on grin pass his lips. “Do we need to go over anything before we get started?”
With that, Steve headed back to his room, getting the suit off and freshening up a bit. From there, he took one of the babydoll sets he had, a soft lavender with lace straps and top leading down to sheer material that brushed against his pecs, and a ribbon in the center. The panties were the same color, lace and a thong this time, followed by sheer stockings and a frilly white garter belt. Reaching in the back of his closet he grabbed a pair of nude heels, as he slipped them on he felt himself sigh in relief.
“Oh bullshit, darling. If that were the case you wouldn’t be sitting here watching Real Housewives of Atlanta with me while I go on about how trashy everyone looked on the red carpet last night.”
They were stroking in unison, both of them sharing the same look of lust and disbelief. “You’ve gotten my cock nice and wet from choking on it. I lift you and hold you against the wall, pushing myself in and watching your reaction get more and more incredible.”
Tony curled his toes, coming right into Steve’s hands and whimpering “Fuck—Steve!” as he did so. It took a few minutes for Steve to come after, but they passed the time by kissing for the first time,harsh and spur of the moment. It set Tony’s skin on fire, feeling Steve’s lips finally on his own. Soft yet insistent, wanting to map out his mouth and take control, the dominance streak in Steve made him break out in goose bumps.
Steve doesn’t say anything. Matter of fact, he doesn’t hear a word from him until later on that night, when Steve steps into his room, bags full of what smells like Chinese and a look that says ‘shut up Stark.’
He got on all fours, wanting to come off as seductive to please Steve, but he felt so exposed, like an open wound. Steve stared at him as if a constant stream of ideas of what he wanted to do to Tony were occupying his thoughts, but he said nothing. His legs were spread invitingly, and his fingers were resting on his chin, it was beckoning, and caused Tony to be aware of the fact that they hadn’t even kissed yet.
On the extensive long list of problems Tony had so meticulously shoved in the back of his head to solve at a later date, Steve was number one; especially nowadays. Tony's having trouble looking at the situation without making boner puns, which would
things,” Steve teased. Tony gently elbowed him before falling asleep seconds later, his head pillowed on Steve’s chest.
Tony had a thing for competence, nothing turned him on more than someone who knew what they were talking about and in turn could direct him firmly. He was defiant, and ultimately needed to have some form of control, so testing the waters and pushing people was what he naturally did. Steve, on the other hand, had a demeanor about him that was calm yet unyielding, as if he knew what Tony was up to from the very beginning.
Egocentric, pretentious, curt, yet unsure—very unsure; this is all Steve gathers from the first five minutes with the man talking. If he’s being honest, he’s only half paying attention. The other half preoccupied with his lunch.
Steve then removed his hand and started stroking himself again, and Tony didn’t move while he watched. Part of him still reeling from his orgasm and another part of him, well, had patience. Maybe obedience had something to do with it. He didn’t want to conflict with how far they’ve gotten. He never dreamed Steve would feel comfortable pissing next to him in a urinal, let alone bringing Tony to an orgasm (although it was via getting the shit kicked out of him) or stroking his gorgeous cock in front of him.
“What was that?” Steve teased, adding a third lubed finger and Tony tensed up, lifting his hips and gasping.
To him, Steve is bittersweet--like dark chocolate, the bitterness is overpowering at first, but sweetness hints and teases, simply a possibility, which then fades into nothing, leaving a bad aftertaste and a craving to try just a bit more. Tony indulges as much as possible, because he’s good at finding distractions; some might say he's an expert.
Fair question, he didn’t have to join him, and Tony is never exactly making him. “Looking for something different I suppose.” It was meant to be a thought, but the words fell from his lips before his brain caught up to him .
“We still didn’t solve the whole being unable to sleep thing; I say we tire each other out,” Tony said, which came off a lot more of an innuendo than he’d intended.
“Shut. Up.” Steve’s words are punctuated by a slap, steady yet hard, he keeps going after that, taking a pause in between each slap and wishing he could actually take a picture of the lovely marks on Tony's ass. The redness turns darker, a slight purplish color and Tony doesn’t let up with his noises, which Steve finds rather cute. He stutters and squirms to the point where Steve holds one of Tony’s hands behind his back and grips tightly.
Steve took his time getting ready on certain days, especially days where he had public events to attend. He enjoyed being well dressed, but wearing confining suits for hours on end wasn’t something he took pleasure in. So he did things to lighten the less than enjoyable load. After a good run, he took a long, hot shower that would momentarily turn his skin red, and leisurely plucked through his drawer to choose what panties he wanted to put on.
Steve says nothing, his hand travels up the back of Tony’s neck and to his hair, then he pulls, gradually making his hold tighter and pulling until he hears Tony gasp. They still hold some form of eye contact, Steve looking down at Tony as if he’s his superior, and Tony looking through a sheet of long eye lashes.
Steve crouched near him, grabbing him by his jaw and staring directly into his eyes. His gaze was normally cold, emotionless, blank, awaiting command. This look was different, it held the same coldness but his face was twisted into a sneer.
Steve swivels in his chair to face him. He swiftly reaches out to grab a handful of Tony’s hair and tugs—hard. Tony groans, a wide toothy grin on his face and his eyes closed. “Such a romantic,” he jokes while getting on his knees. Steve grabs both sides of Tony’s face with one hand and keeps his fingers locked into his hair. Their lips meet briefly before teeth and tongue take over, it’s barely a kiss and more of a mash of mouths fighting for anything but intimacy.
Steve moves from his current hunched over position, chin in hands to hold up his head in a way that tells of his boredom, to sitting up completely and staring at the sight of Tony. He realizes his reaction when Tony smirks and speaks
Steve opened the door slowly, walking in and removing the robe before shutting the door behind him. Tony had a tumbler of scotch in one hand as he sat back on the couch, sleeves rolled up, tie loosened, and eyeing Steve hungrily.
“If you weren’t, I’m sure you would have walked off a long time ago... or given me another ticket.” Tony said jokingly, then cringing when his phone began ringing obnoxiously.
—and in uniform, no less. After this he could die happy, guaranteed. Once Steve’s pants were unzipped, Tony was finally met with his very hard cock. Uncut like he suspected, the foreskin pulled all the way back, and the tip dribbled a bit of precome.
Tony falls on his knees, catching his breath and looking up with those same glowing eyes. This time it’s malicious, and he doesn’t expect Tony to heed his demands. He’s probably repeating ‘be superior’ like a mantra in his head. Unsure. He’s unsure and curious and so beautifully confused. The excitement only heightens and his eyes are glued to the seemingly unbreakable man.
“We should start discussing limitations before we jump into anything else. I need you to be as clear with me as possible or we can’t move forward. No matter how silly you might think they sound, you have to be honest.”
Tony grabs a few tissues to get the come off his face and hands as well as he can. “What are you doing tonight?” Tony asks, not so subtly asking him to come over.
“You’re good kisser,” Steve interjected after biting Tony’s lower lip. For some reason, that felt good to hear, and it motivated him to pull at the back of Steve’s head and kiss him harder. Steve had no problem keeping up, moving his lips from Tony's own to the back of his ear, then slowly down his neck and, oh god, he was going to die. Tony was never one for neck kisses because up until now they never felt like anything, but Steve’s lips on his neck felt carefully orchestrated, as if he knew every single nerve ending that would drive him wild and used that knowledge to a fault. Steve then switched to the other side of his neck and never moved his hands below the belt, so patient and thorough and probably planning his demise.
fast (granted, he didn’t even bother glancing at what the speed limit was but who actually complied to the speed limit on the highway). Just as he’d managed to swallow down the last of doughnut and itched to sip a bit of his coffee, he heard the annoying siren of the car go off once, twice, and fuck okay he should pull over.
“You listen to every word I say, you can go home. And if I see you again it’ll be because you want me to.”
The imagery of him breaching Tony has him pumping faster, dropping his phone to fondle his balls while the brunet carries on moaning in the video. It’s not Tony’s voice, but he imagines he’d be just as whiny. He’d pull Tony’s cheeks apart just to watch his dick go in and cause more discomfort and then he’d pound relentlessly. Tony’s vocal, in his head, he can imagine the brunet moaning as if each sound was being pushed out of him. He’d try to wiggle his ass back, but Steve would have his hips still. Nails biting into his hip bones, bruising, he hopes. Jack hammering at an angle so the head of his cock mashed against smaller ones prostate. He’d grab his hair to force himself deeper, because Tony is an object, an object to milk Steve’s cock and do what he says when he says it.
Tony took a drag from his cigarette. “I could help with that you know…the different thing. Doesn’t have to be anything serious.”
“S-Steve,” Tony forces out, his heart is feels heavier; what did the other him do to make him so sought after? He wants to ask but he’s afraid of the answer.
“That’s just it Tony…I didn’t feel uncomfortable. Awkward but not uncomfortable. Actually I kind of wanted to ask more about what you meant.”
A dry heat passed over the land, making it so the cool breeze had to work a lot harder to allow some sort of relief. Steve was used to the western heat. Being a sheriff meant sitting out in the sun for the majority of the time while sitting on a horse—the only protection being his hat, firmly placed on his head.
It started out as innocent curiosity at first. Steve had always loved the look of lingerie. One day, walking inside of the stores after staring down a pair of black silk with lace trim, he, on impulse, bought them as soon as he got a feel of the soft material. The clerk smiled, saying that his girlfriend would be pleasantly surprised, Steve let out a nervous laugh and agreed.
Their lips touched again, sloppier this time, all while Tony made sure to stroke his cock. Light strokes, but firm enough to send Steve near the edge and pull him back as soon as he tensed up.
Soon enough, Tony got sick of his own teasing and shoved his mouth down inch by inch, his mouth becoming fuller — his fingers couldn’t even compare. Then there was the gagging, but Steve didn’t give him time to adjust. He gripped Tony’s hair and thrusted his hips, and although Tony relaxed his throat he was still a drooling mess. Still, he found himself moaning around the thick flesh, eager, so damn eager to please Steve.
Steve let his eyes fall on the sight, and oh god  Tony was right, the head of his cock was peeking from his panties, dribbling pre come and all. Tony reached down to rub the head with the tip of his finger, and Steve arched up in response, feeling ripples of pleasure course through him.
Tony nodded, he hadn’t even noticed his eyes were sealed closed until he pried them open to see where Steve went. His dom came back with something that looked like a chain with two attachments at the end, Tony furrowed his brows in confusion, then it kicked in.
“Ya sound wide awake ta me, let's meet around 5, remember ta have rule number one down. Night Tony.”
Tony started with softly running a finger along his perineum, and his thigh instantly twitches as tingles licked up his spine. He could see the head of his cock peeking from the foreskin already, so he rubbed some more until he was nearly rolling his hips, letting his eyes flutter closed. Low groans left his mouth and played in his throat; they were loud enough to know he was getting into it, as if it’s a motivation factor in his own pleasure. He pressed another finger where the tip of his cock and the foreskin meet, gently in circles and the pleasure was so subtle but his toes curled.
Well, at least he was self-aware, then again that served to do nothing more than to annoy Steve more. If Tony knew this situation was absurd, why not cut the crap on TV off and stop talking about how boring Jennifer Aniston is, whoever the hell she was.
“They’re rules. Ten rules that we both must comply to while in this relationship. I’m a man of structure. Not everyone likes that about me, but I figured you could handle it.” Steve flipped over the sheet.
“On the flip side of that, you still didn’t complete the task the way I wanted you to, so you’ll still receive punishment. Know that punishment doesn’t exactly mean something bad, it’s more of a reinforcement.”
“Save it, Stark. I’m not keeping you for long. I met another one like you by accident in another universe, pretty thing,” his voice trails off, and Tony closes his eyes to brace for another hit when Steve’s hands go up. Instead, a single calloused finger runs across his forehead. “He had a scar right here, drank like a fish, killing himself daily; broken. I almost felt insignificant; he had self-loathing down to a T. But you... You’re healing.”
It was one of those morning where Tony was running super late. Of course he’d still made time to get his daily few (dozen) doughnuts and an unnecessarily large cup of coffee, before whisking out the door.
He froze, his throat going dry all of a sudden, and for some reason syllables and coherent thought weren’t making sense.
Tony preferred moderately priced, white table cloth places for his first outings. Nothing too loud or distracting, so he could focus on whether or not he was wasting his time. Being the busy man he was, the use of online communities to meet people was almost a must. It made his life a hell of a lot easier, considering how difficult it was to find someone willing to cater to his specific needs without him having to ask for it.
“I hope this isn’t the last time we’ll be helping each other sleep,” Steve said next to his ear, which in Tony’s half asleep state was chuckle worthy.
Steve shrugged. “Luckily, I love a good challenge.” He looked around, then grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him along. Tony nearly fell over, but followed behind, not knowing where they were headed but trusting him for some reason. Steve took him to the back of the building outside; all that could be heard was the typical New York traffic.
“It’s not all about sleeping together; it’s about the romantic aspect and being each other’s soulmate,” Tony said dreamily.
Tony restated the snippet, a bit more annoyed this time, what with the obvious disappointment on Steve’s face. He couldn’t understand why Steve wasn’t happy with the first iteration. This time should do it, he figured.
“Alright… I hope this doesn’t sound creepy but," Tony paused to take a short, steadying breath. "I wanted to see you again. There’s something about you and… I don’t know. The way you talked to me last time made me want to see you--not that your art isn’t something to marvel at it truly is. But I wanted to see you.” Long winded for something that could be answered with a sentence, but Tony tended to ramble under pressure.
Tony chuckled, stepping in front of him and motioning with his head to follow him to the limo. Cameras flashed and paparazzi spoke but Steve’s focus was on the brunet in front of him. In the car, Tony trailed his hands up Steve’s shoulder, as soon as eye contact was made, their lips were on top of each other’s.
He bought more, full sets, stockings and garters, the frillier the better. Until Steve had two drawers filled to the brim of them, and a few heels in the back of his closet as well (a bit more difficult to find for his size, but nonetheless, he had about ten pairs).
Steve nodded his head. Tony then said something along the lines of ‘miss me’, and Steve responded with a flat ‘of course’ with a hint of playfulness behind it. That alone was enough to make Tony glad to be home. Well, that and the fact that Steve was wearing his Captain America uniform, which always got Tony going. Small talk about Tony’s trip continued. And, a stupid mission about mutant bees that Hawkeye had the misfortune of battling up against, and a few bad puns later, Steve’s hand was back onto his groin and he was stroking slowly, but this time Tony wasn't trying to be subtle about staring.
Tony groans and lifts his head, revealing blood dripping from his nose down to the top of his lip. Immediately he lifts out his hands, energy beams seem to be forming in his robotic suit from the palms of his hands. Steve grips him by his neck and lifts him off the ground without hesitation.
Really, it had started at 6 a.m when Steve finally convinced him to go on a jog with him. Tony had reluctantly agreed, though he'd figured a sweaty Steve Rogers would be worth getting his ass up at an ungodly hour. Steve wouldn't even let him reach for a cup of coffee, the heathen. Nevertheless, Tony had found himself throwing on some sweats, some ratty old t-shirt and running shoes before heading out to meet up with Steve outside.
Being face up like this, all of himself exposed was humiliating and exciting all at once. He knew the obvious tent in his pants was visible. He also knew there was a huge chance the super soldier would be disgusted, considering how conservative his views were. Steve's been in war. he could pretend as if he hadn’t had quick grunting sessions with his fellow soldiers to relieve some tension, but Tony knew better. Then again, this was far from war. It was right out of Tony's fantasies.
“Don’t get all defensive,” Tony said while raising his hands in mock surrender, a grin now plastered on his face. “Just looking out for a pal. Women get boring for me at times, hell people in general, sometimes you just need to feel something different. Something more.”
Tony was trying to get a peek at the canvases. He could see flashes of what seemed to be half painted body formations and detailed muscle work, and Tony wanted to see more. As he stood on his toes to look, he nearly stumbled over, causing a loud clack from the heels of his shoes hitting hard wood floor. Turning he looked in Steve’s direction to see him sitting.
Steve fits his fingers to the already blooming bruises on his hips and fucks him harder, making sure every thrust has him in a frenzy. He can feel himself getting close, but he knows he can hold out long enough to get Tony to come on his cock again.  Steve moves his grip down towards Tony’s thighs with one hand, the other smacks Tony’s ass harshly a few times just to tip him over the edge. Tony reaches down and strokes his cock, coming into his clenched fist and holding himself up as Steve keeps fucking into him. Steve’s muscles tense, his brain feels as if it’s melting from how hot and how hard he’s coming, filling Tony up. Tony stills himself and grips the arm of the chair, then slouches and rubs over his tummy once again.
But of course, Steve was selfish and inconsiderate,  ignoring Tony’s bodily functions that included popping boners when sexy super soldiers even so much as licked their lips a certain way. So he just had to not wear underwear again around Tony. This time they were both in the kitchen, alone. Tony was getting (more) coffee and Steve was getting something that was probably adequate nourishment. Small talk was held, Tony so happened to look down, and there it was in all its glory. Those gym shorts did nothing to hide how perfect Steve’s dick curved, and made his dick look so deliciously traceable (obviously he’d trace it with his tongue).
When Tony managed to pull himself out of his mashing, inappropriate thoughts, he grabbed a newspaper on his way to his car and got on his phone. In between waiting for pages to load, he rummaged through the art section, squinting at the freakishly small print and tapping his foot impatiently. He was supposed to own the most advanced tech, yet it’s taken more than twenty seconds for this page to load!  Finally, after what seemed a century, the page popped up, listing the artists that would be attending the show next Thursday at 19:00. Tony smiled to himself. In the back of his mind he knew it would come off as weird bumping into the man again, but he had to.  Something about the way their encounter had ended made him feel incomplete, yearning for Steve’s touch—or was it the way he talked so evenly and clear headed.
Tony’s wrist is giving off a dull ache, rubbed raw from rusty metal chipping away layers of skin. Parts of his suit cling onto different parts of his body—the only sense of protection he has left. He’s aware that physically, it won’t provide any sensible form of defense but it’s the psychological concept that at least keeps his head up. His face is twisted and determined, he’s been staring at the same brick wall for hours, trying to formulate a plan, but his mind is blank with residues of shock.
“Times up. You did good,” Steve’s said, his eyes casting down to Tony’s erection then back up to his face.
He's proactive, obviously used to being in the limelight and it comes off as fake, no matter how enticing. Steve wants real emotion, but he has to bide his time. Tony throws his head back and groaned, brash and showy just like the suit he’d sported.
“He can’t be that mean... You did say you guys have slept together.” Tony was in denial, and Antonio had a sharp enough tongue to piss off just about anyone.
Still on his knees, Tony crawled to where the come started to seep into the rug and licked and sucked as much as he could from it. A broken chuckle fell from the soldier, and when Tony peered up, he saw him shaking his head. Disappointment? Disgust? Who cared. Tony kept at it eagerly, and eventually he heard the clinking of a belt near him. Steve tipped his chin up with the hand not covered with come, the one with come on it lifted to Tony's mouth. He, again, lapped it up and let out a shaky sigh. It was almost like relief, finally getting a taste of something he craved. Steve was probably watching him but Tony, for once, didn't try to put on a show, and was zeroed in on Steve’s big hand. The leather on his palm swept against his tongue, and it had him moaning.
Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony’s waist firmly, gripping the breathy fabric that was his button down, which constricted his hold enough to feel the curve of Tony’s waist.  Tony smiled, tipping his hat back to get eye level with him and then they were kissing. It started out gentle, but turned into a mess of mouths and tongues searching for one another. The harder they kissed, the thicker the air felt, and Steve could feel his clothes beginning to stick onto him. He gripped Tony’s jaw with one hand, pushing his tongue in his mouth and mapping it out before licking over the tip of Tony’s tongue.
- and his cock twitches. His thinking is becoming hazier, and if the prospect the danger had given him any more of a high, he’d be asking to be fucked—held down and told to take it all while crying and begging for mercy. The thought is disturbing, and he’s sure lust has overtaken his features.
Everything was playing at his body as if he was an instrument. Tony emitted sounds that left him questioning if he was okay. Eventually, all he could do was just pant heavily, so close, so fucking close and the only thing he could say was Master.
Tony nodded stiffly and did as he was told. Steve had big, warm hands. They generated more warmth than Tony’s, and the few times he felt them sent electric currents up his spine. He wanted those hands and calloused fingers rubbing over his lower back, tracing his spine, holding his own hand while whispering the filthiest commands into his ear in a public place.
“Aren’t you well versed,” Tony stated with a raise of his brow. The man’s home spoke more 'artist' than 'used to be soldier', though he could definitely sense the soldier part within his mannerisms. Steve was well spoken, and very respectful, especially when addressing someone older than him, and had a firm look seemingly engraved within his features.
“Pretty good, I ate breakfast and a burger for lunch, but I did have a salad on the side.” Tony said proudly as if displaying a badge of honor.
Steve laughed. “You almost have me convinced, but I promise there'll be a lot of those next time.” Steve stood up and made it so they were unbearably close, resting his palm against Tony’s crotch, which made him tremble.
Tony shrugged, “My thoughts and my mouth run in the same circles, which isn’t a good most of the time.”
“God, I love those noises you make for me.” Steve growled directly into his ear, then moved his fingers against Tony’s entrance. “I’m going to finger you until you come.”
Tony didn’t remember saying he was going to nap a bit, but he drifted off, with Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist, which left enough leeway for him to fall asleep.
They shook hands, which felt a bit odd to do, since it technically was a date. Tony shrugged it off and sat.
“I planned on getting some dinner with a friend of mine this evening, do you mind if we meet afterwards?”
That same day, he rushed into the tower, avoiding everyone and locking himself in his room. After getting undressed, he slowly pulled on the tiny piece of fabric that constituted as undergarments, and stared at himself in the full length mirror in awe. Aesthetically, he was pleased by the look of firm muscle surrounded by something so delicate, another part of him that wasn’t thinking as artistically was turned on by his cock being strained against the material.
“No problem. Text me when you’re headed my way, and don’t forget about the first rule I still wanna hear.”
Tony was holding his breath, releasing every time some sensitive area was fondled with or brushed against. He looked down and eyed Steve’s movements until he was told to look up and relax. He stared at the ceiling, humming softly at the tingling sensation on his skin as Steve touched him.
He’s obsessed with reconstructing the world in his image, and really, isn’t everyone trying to do that. He knows the guy is a genius, and as with all geniuses and inventors, he'll find his downfall by the hands of his own creations. Tony is doomed to fail in his motivations.
“Are you aware of how fast you were going back there?” Handsome asked, face tight and gaze even, then proceeded to squint. “Aren’t you the guy who orders a million donuts every morning?”
“You’re adorable, and short.” Antonio replied, followed by Anthony shoving him slightly. Anthony was not that short.
Tony peeled off his now soaked work shirt, and walked over to the bathroom. “Then you best get over here,” he said over his shoulder, echoing his words from earlier.
“How long have you loved Steve?” Antonio asked Tony, which made Tony smile for a split second. He eyed the glass of wine in front of him. Antonio watched every move, thinking that he should probably stop drinking in front of one of his counterpart who prided themselves in being sober, but for some reason, seeing both versions of him couldn’t be done without a buzz. Even now, he was mentally exhausted. Antonio already thought of himself as pathetic,, but seeing the other two only reinforced his conclusion.
He gets on all fours, cracked cement and dried blood underneath his hands, and the feeling makes his skin
“Exactly, and to be fair, it puts me to sleep too, so I might just join you. I mean hell—out at war these things were the norm. It’s not like we have to make eye contact.”
The problem is, Steve’s been thinking about his offer for a month now, and it’s turned unhealthy. Like feeling guilty when he has to make a passing glance at Tony unhealthy.
Tony’s lips pressed into a thin line, “They’re not a million and you do look familiar, now that I get a good look at you.” Bullshit, he noticed immediately, but it’s not like the man needed know that.
Both Anthony and Tony pulled away from Antonio, murmuring something along the lines of “don’t even start.”
The brunet sipped on his glass of red wine, eyeing his watch when a smooth voice spoke his name. “Tony?”
Deft fingers were shaking as he pulled down Steve’s zipper, as if this was his first tango with a dick in his mouth. The thing is, it was his first time blowing
One of his hands let go of the hold he had on his newspaper, wiping the sweat from his brow and feeling around him. Tony was currently taking a well needed bath, so he couldn’t have taken it, but knowing him he probably would've wanted to attach some weird technology on it to make it fly.
Steve’s stroking himself faster now, heaving and letting out low growls as he tugs on his balls and aggressively fists the base. “Take it, bitch,” he says to himself, imagining he’s uttering those words to Tony as he begs for it, screams for it, says Steve’s name like a fucking prayer. Even with all the fantasy, it’s not enough. He needs the real thing to fuck, to use, to break. Watch his eyes roll back, watch him tear up when it’s too much. Fuck, just the mental image of Tony crying on his cock has him coming faster than he thought. He lets out a surprised gasp when he does so.
Steve would be lying if he said he didn’t love the attention, eyes glued to him as if he’s all Tony wanted right now. He bit his lower lip at the sight of Tony’s legs spread open, inviting, so damn inviting.
“You’re your own brand of distant today,” Tony said while leaning over next to him, lighting up a cigarette because he must have been feeling a pretty good buzz. Steve watched as his lips wrapped around the filter of the cigarette, so pink and full and had probably been in places they shouldn’t be. Watching Tony smoke always stirred something in him. Maybe because there’s always an honest conversation at the tail end of that, or because of how Tony visibly relaxes, or just the comfort of smoke that reminds him of his past life. The brunet doesn’t do it often, but when he does, the hypnotic tendrils of smoke don’t distract from how good the sight of Tony’s lips wrapped around something is.
“I won’t read everything aloud, you can do it on your own. If you have any questions, call me. We can talk things through. Once you finish going over them, your first lesson starts.” Steve said with ease, Tony pulled his gaze up towards the blond.
He was met with what was probably the most arousing sight ever. Even just watching him from the back, he started to get hard. Tony in one of his work shirts rolled up his arms, his hat placed firmly on his head and a slight swing of his hips to indicate he was dancing to a tune of his own.
The first finger felt incredible, slowly moving in and out and made Tony quiver. Only one finger and he was already a babbling mess, and Steve didn’t give him time to adjust before adding a second. This time making a sort of ‘come hither’ motion with his fingers, building up speed and leaving Tony choking on air.
Tony restrained a shudder, stepping in before he could seem anymore desperate. He stood towards the bed, feeling nervous again despite himself. The events that transpired last time replayed in his mind like a broken record. He remembered the first rule by heart as usual, but what if he messed up again? Would Steve drop him as a sub altogether? Just the thought of disappointing the man again made him rigid.
Tony feels the sting of disappointment, and then the calm of relief wash over him. Right now, he wouldn’t mind having his mouth full again. Tony opens it gently, and Steve laughs. “You're all the same. Damaged beyond repair.” The observation hurts, but Tony’s been aware of this for years.
I swear updates will be quicker, I have a laptop now so I can write whenever I want yay!! As always this isn't for the faint of heart. Although this chapter isn't too heavy it's still dealing with harmful themes such as not explicitly getting consent for dangerous activities. More tags are coming as I think of more crap lol. Beta'd by Morphia-writes!
Besides, time for dinner meant more time catching up with those same friends he’d been neglecting due to working himself into oblivion. Not that they hadn’t already noticed something different. First, it was Pepper, who’d come in and asked routinely ‘Should I get someone to bring up lunch for you, Mr Stark?’
Tony could feel his face heating up, followed by pangs of insecurity tugging in the pit of his stomach. “Yeah, right.” He liked Anthony. The man was optimistic and bright eyed. He didn’t share the dullness that he’d adapted over the years or the permanently vacant look  Antonio tried to cover up with jests and alcohol.
Tony closes his eyes in disgust, and As soon as he opens his mouth in the slightest, he can hear Steve’s zipper and the rustling of clothing. He feels the head of Steve’s cock touch his lips, and gently sticks out a tongue to taste.  He’s always wanted this, he thinks, stifling a groan, but not like this. Never like this.
He should probably establish a safe word, but he's impatient and can’t see things heading into that territory right now anyways. Steve hums for a second. “We’ll get into ‘kinks’ another time. That’s an entirely different discussion. Right now--” Steve gets up from his seat, he can feel his body thrumming with excitement at the way those crisp blue eyes peer up at him almost innocently.
Tony looked up for a moment, and to his surprise Steve was also just as excited below as Tony was. He still had the look of a hardened soldier, but it seemed angrier. The sides of Tony's mouth curled a bit into a smirk. “Isn't it obvious?”
“I know your conservative head can’t compute what’s going on but like I said the first time I sucked your cock, don’t think.”
It’s hard to adjust to the rhythm, but he does it eventually. Steve’s size doesn’t make it any easier, but fuck, he’s torn between slowly getting turned on and wanting this all to be over. He hates himself for this, knowing he won’t be able to look his Steve in the eye afterwards.
For a few moments, Steve was lost in Tony, and he allowed himself to be. Until the kiss was over, he found his bearings and in an assertive voice he told Tony to “Lay back.” Tony did so without hesitation, leaning his head back on the armrest as Steve removed Tony’s slacks. With lube in hand he waited, watching as little tremors ran through Tony.
Tony’s eyes skimmed the paper. Beneath each rule in bold was a separate explanation for both the dominant and submissive. The first rule, be patient, already giving him a sense of relief and uneasiness
Tony jerked out of his stream of ongoing thoughts. Clearing his throat, he answered. “Yeah, sorry about that, I guess I’m just curious.”
“You walk pretty well in those heels. If I pay you to walk around in heels and bend over and pick up stuff, would that be considered prostitution?”
Tony’s grunting petered off into soft whimpers and little whines when he angled his cock just right, the dry heat settling on Steve’s already moist and clammy skin, the tinkering of his belt becoming a constant chime that occasionally sped up with Steve’s thrust. And fuck, the way Tony clenched was bringing Steve to the edge. Mentally, he had to calm himself down so he won’t come too fast.
Tony didn’t bother to sit up, figuring that since Steve didn’t do so, he should wait on some invitation.
Tony slides off of the desk and sinks down on his knees in front of Steve. To Steve’s surprise, he doesn’t immediately start touching his cock--he looks contemplative, and Steve just watches for a moment, wondering what Tony might be debating. Is he ashamed at how deep he's gotten into this? After a moment passes, Steve grabs a fistful of Tony’s hair, with his free hand he traces a finger  around his partially opened mouth and as it opens wider, he removes his finger and pushes Tony’s head down on his cock. He loosens his grip on Tony's hair and lets him suck. Steve has to admit the man has a talented tongue;  he swirls it around the head of Steve's cock, then licks the underside of it, simultaneously keeping his lips locked around it.
Angling his fingers upwards and curving them slightly he brushed against Tony’s prostate, which earned him an undignified yelp.
“Get on the desk, lie on your back,” Steve tsk’s lightly, the lack of lubrication being a huge problem until a coy Tony Stark clears his throat rather loudly, showcasing a small packet.
He briefly wondered when this would happen again, but dismissed the thought as soon as it came. He wanted to live in the now for once. Take in every detail for the jerk off memory banks. Steve’s eyes half lidded, his glare slowly turning glassy as he kept a firm grip on his length. He seemed to use his whole palm to stroke himself, and god did he need it with that huge cock of his. He let out soft grunts and heavy pants, occasionally cursing lowly while he tipped on feet a bit. His free hand held onto some piece of furniture as he worked himself, his grip growing increasingly firmer with each stroke. Tony wanted Steve like this all the time, in him, on top of him-- holding him down, making him fucking scream and pray desperately because he went so far off the deep end. And then Steve came, groans leaving him between harsh breaths, thick ropes of white landing on Tony's rug. Steve tipped forward and his head was tipped back. He finished with a low “fuck,” and Tony imaged it must have felt really good. All of this felt so fucking good.
Tony’s life was based on a structured yet cumbersome schedule, he always had to be doing something, and the moments he had to breathe he found himself never letting himself do so. There was always work that had to be done, and really, he liked it that way. Steve, however, said he was overworked and in need of rest, asking asinine questions like, did he get eight hours of sleep or did he eat regularly.
He kept the finger going at a shallow pace, not too fast or too slow, just enough so Tony'd get acclimated to the penetration.  The next finger was what always drove Tony to the brink of insanity, and really all he needed was two finger to make Tony come, but Steve was all for driving Tony over the edge. The second finger was pressed in, a scissoring motion, slow and deep. He could feel Tony’s inner walls clenching around his fingers, and although the feeling wasn’t around his cock, it still felt good.
“You. I was gonna walk up to you and say ‘Heya partner’ in your accent, and then give you a little show.”
Minutes pass, but then Tony’s suits melts off of him, liquid silver and blue lights hanging off of his skin, the garish thing is soon gone. Steve stares intently, watching tan skin flex and a body that’s surprisingly smaller than the suit, yet is still lean enough to give off the illusion of strength. Steve knows better.
Steve had the hands of a worker, rough and worn, and strong. His touches, however, were gentle when meant to be. He took his time in some areas, near his hipbones and thighs, the hunger in his eyes evident with every swipe of his fingers.
“Well I’m sorry, for someone who I thought lived on photosynthesis and coffee, this is just new. Are you dating?”
Tony talked more than he probably thought he did, and hell, even the subtle smugness he seemingly carried along with him everywhere like he did an expensive watch drove him mad.  However, it usually didn’t take much to get Tony trembling, no matter how stubborn, he always fell pliant with so much as a touch to his lower back. He’d fall quiet, waiting for Steve’s next move, and most times, Steve wouldn’t have a next move, it was just satisfying to see him so wanting.
Tony felt wisps of cold air against his skin, shivering at times from the combination of the temperature and the silence. Steve wasn’t ignoring him, but they weren’t talking either, not to mention the word punishment weighed in on him like cinder blocks. He tried to keep himself calm. Steve told him that not all punishments are bad. Even if he made a mistake, Steve wasn’t disappointed, was he?
“Patience is a virtue, darling,” Tony calls back from the bathroom. “I’m a very unique perfectionist, I thought you would have learned that by now.”
Steve nodded to signify a yes, but Tony wasn’t satisfied with that, slapping his ass harshly once and making him shout a clipped yes. Those images swirled around in his head. Tony would give him smug glances and turn the controls higher. Steve would try to hold back yelps, biting his lower lip and fuck oh fuck he was coming, shouting Tony’s name and digging his heels into Tony’s back.
Tony looked out his peripheral vision and squinted, refusing to fully look at the man lying beside him, who was currently without a shirt and probably just as uncomfortable as he was. Tony was even more annoyed at the fact that his preferred sleeping position had his back towards the door; staring at Steve’s perfectly sculpted back muscles until he fell asleep wasn’t at the top of his to do list, especially when the inevitable boner situation was  sure a follow up. It didn’t help that it was chillier than expected, so he wanted to scoot back a bit for warmth but he didn’t want their butts to touch.
Steve got up and walked to the bathroom, washing his hands and then dampening a washcloth so Tony could wipe himself down. He handed Tony the washcloth and sat on the opposite end of the couch.
Steve raised a brow. “I appreciate the compliment, truly. And, don’t take this the wrong way but... why are you here? This doesn’t seem like your type of environment. I can’t imagine my art dragged you down to another hipster art gallery.” Steve stepped closer, invading Tony’s personal space like last time, and just for that, Tony was glad he showed up.
Steve raises his eyebrow. “No, I’m eating.” His Brooklyn drawl leaves him, and he lifts his legs to cross atop of his desk as he continues eating as if Tony hasn't said a thing.
“Good. You always did do a fine job following directions, Mr. Stark.” Steve pulls out one of the folding chairs against the wall and sits a few feet away from him.
Steve waited a second, and then leaned over to get a firm hold of the back of Tony’s neck. “I’ll take any opportunity to knock you down a peg.” Which didn’t exactly answer Tony’s question; not that Steve gave a damn. He didn’t deserve an answer.
“Crazily enough that’s one of my favorite scenarios to masturbate too; up against the wall, fucking you after shutting that snarky mouth up with my cock—
“You look disappointed, perhaps a thank you is—“ Before Tony could utter another unwelcomed word Steve grabbed the collar of his shirt and pulled him into a hard kiss.
“Must I tell you everything? Besides, it’s not a big deal. I’m just a bit chilly, is all.” He snuggled underneath the blankets, and as he did, so did Steve unravel himself from the sheets, lying back down the opposite direction once more.
Both of them paused for a moment, looking at each other and then shaking their heads. “Let’s pretend like we don’t know,” said Tony.
“Were you serious about publicly humiliating me in front of millions of people plus our teammates?” Steve asked.
“No touching yourself. You’ll get touched plenty, in our next meeting.” The words were whispered next to his ear.
“Don’t deny it, you’re eating healthier, cutting back on work, you seem a bit more easy going. You’re totally dating someone.”
“I can’t believe you push me away when I’m trying to make you feel good, or do we have to pretend like this isn’t a part of our routine, my dear.”
Tony ran his thumb over the Steve's lower lip, and Steve flicked his tongue out to lick eagerly. That finger was gone in a split second, making Steve whimper at the loss. A few seconds after, Tony was pouring lube onto his fingers, coating his cock with the liquid. Tony swiftly pulled the panties off, fumbling to get them out of the heels before getting in between Steve’s legs.
His lips were soft, but the kiss insistent, demanding Tony’s attention. Tony kissed back and tried to match his passion. Next thing he knew, he was lost in the heady feeling of it all. It was a steady rhythm they created, increasingly frantic, each collision of their tongues and mouths sending sparks down his spine. Tony reached a hand down to feel the texture of Steve’s skin, tracing up his forearm while keeping his eyes glued shut and enjoying the experience of feeling without seeing. Too much did he let his ability to examine deter from experiences and feelings of pleasure.
Tony was definitely satisfied with how red the blond’s ears got during the teasing commentary. He sputtered before gathering his words.
After coming, he pulled out, mouth connecting with Tony once again, and he began to stroke his cock, rubbing the head and reveling in the feeling of it in the palm of his hand. It only took a few moments and Tony’s orgasm washed over his features, coming into Steve's hand and panting harshly. Steve felt his cock twitch at the sight of Tony’s eyebrows furrowed; lips parted and sweat dripping down his chest and neck. It was truly a sight he wished to see always.
He grew hot when Steve’s mouth ran along his inner thigh, groaning softly and lifting up his hips, Steve licked at his skin, and then bit him once. A sharp yelp left the brunet, and he was about to grasp Steve’s hair, before quickly remembering that he was told not to touch his dominant. Instead, he reached for the sheets, tugging them tightly, then tighter as his nipples were tugged on.
he reminded himself. Even knowing he was being watched did nothing to settle the tremors throughout his body. Matter of fact it made the intensity that much more palpable. Slowly, he managed to pry his tear soaked eyes open.
“Calm down, Shakespeare. Not everyone has waited a decade to hold hands,” Anthony said facetiously, followed by a bark of laughter from Antonio. Tony sucked his teeth. The fact that he was the hopeless romantic out of the three of them was only slightly embarrassing.
only be funny the first few seconds after seeing Steve’s erection ever so proudly tenting his sweatpants, its outline clearly visible.
It’s only a few feet Tony would have to crawl. The chains are long enough so it’s possible, but he’s afraid of what’s next. His fingers itch to move forward. He wants to leave. And sure, he’s hanging onto to the comfort of his Steve in hopes that this is one big joke, but it’s wishful thinking.
”What are you thinking about?” Steve asked, his voice came off as strained and it was enough to make precome dribble on the tip of his cock.
Tony’s shaking uncontrollably now, wanting to lean into the touch, but instead, he pulls his face in the opposite direction and struggles against the chains a bit.
It’s always a game, a game both of them are willing to play. Steve can’t deny both of them end up winning sometimes.
The man has nonchalantly offered, one drunk night when Steve wasn’t particularly up for Tony’s showcasing of ladies. He sipped on a drink that did nothing, out of habit of making others feel comfortable. He’d stepped on the balcony for some fresh air, needing a break from the madness inside.
Tony twists his hand on the upstroke and seems to hold a firm grip, his toes curl and legs tense. He bites his lower lip and lets his free hand grip the edge of the desk to hold position. Steve takes out his cock from the confines of his stealth suit and works himself over slowly, watching and thinking about how he wants Tony to take his first load.
The routine being Tony saunters in, Steve tells him to leave and Tony refuses. Twenty minutes later they’re breathing heavily and slipping their clothes back on as Steve glares daggers at him. Tony doesn’t know why they play this pretend game if it’ll only lead up to that, but somehow the sex is a lot more fun that way.
Steve’s impatient, and Tony doesn’t mind. He bends over the desk like he’s physically directed to. Digging into his pockets, Tony pulls out a small bottle of lubrication, and hands it back to Steve. He can nearly hear Steve shaking his head.
Steve’s gaze crossed between the anger that never left him and very obvious lust. He was palming himself now, and Tony wanted nothing more than to reach out and touch. His body was screaming with the aches, but that didn’t stop him from trying to lift up and just reach-- just touch or taste or anything Steve might allow him to do. Steve, however, was not one without cruelty, and gave him a gruff “No.” He did, however, pull his cock out, and Tony was just far gone enough to express his gratitude “Jesus..” he groaned, seeing that monster for the first time. Uncut, thick and long enough to rival his favorite dildos, the tip an angry red, almost purple at this point, and leaking the tiniest bit of pre come. Steve gathered some of it onto his thumb. He pressed a leather clad hand to Tony's face, his thumb grazing his lower lip. Tony sucked eagerly at the digit, shameless.
And just like that, he pulled away, and the waitress came with their order. Steve was full of smiles and was well mannered, as if he hadn’t just said what he’d said a fraction of a second ago.
“What?” Tony dragged out, “you don’t miss me? I’m hurt.” He clutched his heart, accompanied by sniffling, which led her to roll her eyes.
“Impossi--” Definitely possible, because as soon as their lips touched again Tony forgot whatever the hell he had planned to say next.
Before Steve can finish, he pulls Tony’s head up and off of his cock, and comes on parts of his uniform. With easy strokes, he gets out the last bit of come, then wipes his fingers onto Tony’s lips. “I want every drop of my precious come licked up.”
To put it lightly, he’s been curious about the dominant and submissive lifestyle for a while now. He’s never been in a properly functioning relationship, since it was so difficult to find a dom who wasn't just out to be controlling for control's sake. Needless to say, he was a curious sub, not exactly the most experienced, but has done enough research to keep himself properly informed.
“You should be thinking about how good it felt when I touched you. That sense of relief I saw on your face was beautiful. Not the million ways you can hate yourself, pet.” Steve didn’t even look up from his sheet when he spoke.
“It’s alright, Tony.” He doesn’t want to hear how it was a mistake. He doesn’t want to hear any of that backtracking right now. It wasn’t an accident, and they both know it. Tony doesn’t say anything else, and Steve doesn’t bother to, either. Both lost in their own thoughts. Once the elevator dings Steve’s about to step off until Tony grabs his wrist, Steve raises a brow and looks back quizzically.
Steve’s life is..fulfilling. Or at least he finds himself trying to fill it. A balance between not enough and too much to handle. The modern day falls under too much, the missions he takes where he’s painfully aware of the distance between him and his teammates falls under that umbrella too. The day to day of getting up when he doesn’t work, keeping himself preoccupied falls under both not enough and too much. Too much alone time, not enough stimuli, too much time to think, not enough distractions. Certain things that fall under his control-- he can open up a good book to distract himself. To take his mind away by reading something as outdated as he is. Sadly, he can’t force his teammates to open up to him or to at least help close the gap a little. He knows its partially his fault. It always is when it comes to building any foundation for a relationship. It’s why he and Jan couldn’t work, it's why he and Sharon didn’t either.
With each passing pressure onto his hands and knees, it became harder and harder not to want to rush into sex. The buildup was wearing away the resolve he thought the rules would have placed on hold, and he wondered if Steve was suffering just as much.
“Our second date has gone so well.” Tony picked up his phone and ran to the bathroom to take the call. Something business related that he wished he would have ignored and had more time with Steve.
Tony’s thoughts are quickly interrupted; it’s Steve or what he presumes to be some clone of Steve again, sporting a black stealth suit and a cold expression. Hardened, unwavering eyes, but then his lips turn up into a playful smirk. He sits on his haunches, boots grinding in cement, rock and dried blood.
The brunet shakes his head a bit, as if trying to come to grips with Steve’s curiosity. “Tony if you don’t--”
When he was done teasing himself, he started in slow but firm strokes along his shaft, twisting his wrist up slightly just to give the right amount of friction. His eyes closed, and he was imaging the Steve that shocked him, telling him to get on his knees and stroke the outside of whatever fabric of choice it was that day. His strokes sped up, and sweat broke out on his brow.
Tony lifts his head, coughing. He has tears welling in his eyes, but he smiles and wipes his mouth gently, as if touching up make up. Steve’s eyes fall down to Tony’s cock pressed against sheer panties, and then his own jeans. Both have wet spots that can only mean--
“Right now just do what I say,” he finishes by grabbing a patch of hair in the back of Tony's head and pulling him up. Tony gasps but leans into it, his lips finding Steve’s. The bigger man snakes a hand around Tony's waist, thrusting his tongue into his mouth. Already he can feel the need to take Tony bubbling up on the surface, the shroud closing in on his lust addled brain.
“Next debrief, I want you to wear the whitest panties you can find, right after sticking a vibrator inside. Captain America shaking and trying to hold it together while everyone is watching, while I’m watching. Or during the next interview, camera’s on you, and you can barely say a word.”
“What time are you going home again?” Tony’s way of asking if he could stay over, and Steve wouldn’t give him a direct answer. He just shrugged in response and turned his attention to the television, hiding a smile when Tony rested his head onto his shoulder.
Tony rolled his eyes playfully. No matter how long it’s been, she could always find a way to chastise him. “I’m just cutting back a bit. I missed you.”
He couldn't remember what had been said, all he knew at that moment was that he was face up on the floor with Steve's boot snug against his neck. He also knew his cock was straining against boxers that Steve would find obscenely expensive. Steve pushed down harder and Tony let out a gurgle that was meant to be a cry.
Digging into Tony’s left pocket he rolled his eyes when he found a small tube of lubrication, how convenient of him.
Tony nodded in agreement, though he couldn’t exactly relate to that statement, because honesty wasn’t something he’d fully considered important in intimate relationships. The majority of them were built on lies, and the idea of being together, so at the mention of being honest he wondered if he was ready to be as open as Steve probably wanted him to be.
Tony kept his eyes locked, tracing over each line with his eyes before he was interrupted by the gorgeous man himself.
Small gasps left him, each harsher tug to his nipples edging on a new type of pain he had yet to explore. It was addictive, and he needed it to stay constant, Tony felt a cry about to leave him but Steve stopped all of a sudden.
Tony did so, pushing himself upright and almost nuzzling into the warm hand that reached out to touch his face. Steve could probably tell, or at least he was imagining the knowing look he’d received from the blond.
Tony moaned lowly, thrusting his hips into deft fingers that gripped him with the right amount of tightness. As usual, he was trying to catch up with Steve, testing his theory about if his head was sensitive and being pleasantly surprised when Steve squirmed.
“That would imply you had the capability to do so,” Tony gasps out, letting out a sly grin when Steve grips harder.
Steve gives him a look of annoyance, running a thumb over Tony’s bottom lip gently. “Open your mouth and do what I say or I’ll force it open and rip out your teeth with pliers. Do I make myself clear?”
Huffing, Tony finally pulled back and tried to catch his breath, Steve did the same and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
“I--...uh.” Were they dating? Steve said they’d get into labels later on, so he didn’t know a specific title to put over whatever they had. Plus, saying something along the lines of ‘Master wants me to be healthy’ wasn’t exactly something normally brought up in a conversation.
Steve’s life is fulfilling in his own sensible way of keeping things on the back burner until he can organize it mentally. He saves the day, and hopes the rest of it spent alone goes by quickly so he can distract himself by saving it again. He says it's enough, and it should be. But there's something else. Something on that back burner that boils over every once in a while. Something that glaringly falls under not enough that reaches the darkest recesses of his mind late at night. Something he feels dirty about it, even mid way through choked gasps and rustling underneath the covers-- all that reminds him of what it truly means to feel something is not enough.
Steve looks sharp, the strong lines of his face and his stature always make him look impossibly angular, impenetrable and hard to reach. He’s in a well fitted suit, clearly uncomfortable with sitting on his ass all day, reading over specific outlines and guidelines. He’d rather be out there, physically making it all happen, and Tony understands.
Tony nodded in agreement, letting a grin grace his lips before slowly pushing himself into Steve. Both of them groaning in unison, a little clink from Tony’s buckle resonated when he began thrusting. One hand on the base of Steve’s cock, stroking in time with thrust after thrust. Tony leaned in closer, making it so the thrusts were short but hard enough for Steve to feel it.
Steve rolls his eyes, and then thinks about being alone with Tony briefly. “Fine, what time?” He doesn’t even know why he's saying yes. He knows nothing is going to happen, but for some reason he wanted to see if there’s a possibility it could.
He’d been able to remember the first rule the first time he drilled himself on it that evening. To put it bluntly, he was a bit smug about it. Sure, Steve has had his fair share of submissives, but were they all as intelligent as him? Probably not. He smiled to himself, but quickly remembered he had to review the other nine rules.
They headed out at around 8:30. Tony shot a text to Steve, stating that he was on his way. Not too long later, he arrived at Steve’s living quarters. Unconsciously, he rushed to the door and knocked with haste.
Tony grinned, teeth showing. And really, Steve was pleasantly surprised when he looked down to see Tony didn’t have on any under garments, and his work shirt was unbuttoned. His cock was half hard, which didn’t help Steve’s current growing situation below. Tony walked up to him, slow and with a slight pout on his lips.
At any rate, the gallery visitors looked a bit more eccentric, to say the least. It was rare to find someone with a hair color that didn’t come out of a bottle, or someone who wasn’t littered in tattoos. They were all works of art themselves. Needless to say he felt (and looked) out of place, but he tried to focus on the pieces of art themselves. He wasn’t sure why, but this time he felt more inclined to pay attention to the works. Most of it focused on some aspect of nudity. It wasn’t perverse in any sense (no matter how much the twelve year old in him wanted to snicker at the gaggle of dicks). However, any sort of out of place amusement fell once he saw Steve’s art.
Tony leaned against the wall and looked up at Steve, meeting his clear eyes briefly, then his eyes trailed over the man's nose and lips, followed by the sharp lines of his jaw. Like the paintings he kept tracing the lines of with his eyes over and over again. Steve’s finger traced over his bottom lip gently, one hand at his waist, and Tony’s heart was strumming out of control. The pit of his stomach was a pool of mush and his thoughts made no sense, until Steve finally kissed him.
“I’ll fuck you when I see fit, Stark. What did I say about talking?” Steve removes his finger and slaps Tony’s ass firmly, letting go of his hair and bending him over his knee. “All you need to do is follow directions. I know you can, but you’re so damn stubborn, aren’t you?” He adds another slap to his ass, harder than the one before, making Tony cry out.
Once he’d decided he’d tortured Tony enough, he murmured “come for me Tony.” Steve took the hand from his thigh and gripped the base of his cock, stroking and watching as Tony came a few seconds later. Groans left Tony in increments between panting and harsh breaths, his hips lifting up off the couch and toes curling, a grin so wide he wondered about the headspace Tony was currently in.
Steve moved over, leisurely enough to make the small gap between them feel like yards across. Tony suddenly felt a lump in his throat that he aggressively tried to swallow, and then Steve’s lips were at his ear.
Tony stayed silent but his eyes pleaded otherwise. After getting dressed, he was making his way towards the door, but tried one more time.
It’s late again, the feeling of not enough ebbing through him. Sometimes he needs a jump start, and unfortunately, porn falls into that category. Things…things that are more extreme than he’d like to admit. Bondage and submission really do it for him these days when thinks of Tony. He manages to come across a thumbnail of a brunet in a stockade. Head and arms trapped in a device that makes it so the man has no choice but to bend over and take it. An object, a dumpster for Steve to let out his frustrations. Steve trails his hands down to his sweats, feeling himself get excited already from the thumbnail alone.
His mind ran rampant with confusing and conflicting thoughts. He and Steve were okay on some level, but not okay enough to share a bed and be cool with it, and hell he was still thinking about the fact that Steve had ripped that log in half with his bare hands. Shit, shit repeated like a mantra in his head as he adjusted his cock subtly.
When Steve pulled away from his neck, he landed a kiss onto his lips again, this time no tongue and almost too innocent for the numerous sex driven thoughts Tony’s brain had been formulating. When they finally pulled apart, Tony was sure he looked a mess, his lips felt bruised in the best of ways, his suit jacket was half off of him and he knew his hair was ruined. His legs were shaking from trying not to buckle underneath him as he tried to catch his breath.
“Offering my services? For a limited time only. But look, don’t make a big deal about it. You just seemed tense and antsy. You always are, but you know what I mean.”
Tony laps his tongue around the head, then underneath, and Steve groans rather loudly before pushing Tony’s head back down, huffing when he chokes. He keeps fucking Tony’s mouth until he finally releases, coming hard enough to make his vision blur, giving a full body shudder. His brain is muddled with nothing but the mantra
“Steve, oh god yes darling that feels—“ Steve pressed harder to get Tony to shut the hell up, he didn’t need to be told how it felt, he just needed Tony to moan for him, and moan he did.
A muffled mantra of “Fuck, fuck, fuck,” leaves him, and he’s trying to keep his head clear enough to keep his orgasm at bay. He doesn’t want to come yet;  wants Steve to keep pounding into him forever. He wants to hear Steve pant heavily and murmur curse words as the clanking of his belt gets louder with the speed of his thrust.
Antonio rolled his eyes. “Darling, sex has nothing to do with how badly we treat each other. Yes, I am partially to blame--not that any of you are shocked, but you two still have a chance. We’re all screw ups, after all. Especially you, Tony.”
in response, hips stuttering upwards, making Steve grin. They continued like this, sweat soaked skin and heat slowly weighing on them, making it harder to breathe with the already rigorous activity. It was so good, Steve could feel the pressure in his balls build because he needed to come deep into Tony’s body, and after a few more thrust, he did so. His eyelids fluttered, gripping Tony’s hips harsher and groaning.
Steve thrums his pen against a stack of papers, and Tony’s not sure if he’s still trying to ignore him, but it won’t work. Tony walks around the desk, one finger sliding across Steve’s shoulder blades. He leans in and pretends to scan over paper work.
“I know who you are,” Steve took his hand gently, but his hands felt firm and strong. The type of hands he wanted to feel touching every part of him. Tony shook himself from those thoughts and nodded.
He could come from just this, continuous and still feeling waves of pain from the clamps on his nipples. Just when he thought he was done in, Steve brushed his fingers against Tony's prostate once, twice, then over and over and fuck if Tony thought he was a mess before, he was ridiculous now.
Tony’s silent for a moment, then. “I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable, can we just move on? It won’t happen again,” he says, sounding almost desperate. As if there’s something else to lose besides the overt awkwardness.
After getting undressed, he laid back, head anchored by the pillows and watching as Steve removed his shirt, and stopped there. Not that Tony didn’t appreciate the magnificent view of solid pectorals and washboard abs, but even so, he wanted to see the little soldier downstairs. Tony snorted at his own joke.
drooling, even though he wiped the side of his mouth and drool so happened to be on the back of his hand. Just as the logical,
“What’s taking you so damn long? I don’t have all day.” Not true at all, Steve's willing to wait for as long as Tony needs to primp himself, not that he thinks Tony needs it. Really, he prefers it if Tony just came out naked.
At the tower, Steve suppressed a whine once Tony pulled away, quickly getting an idea once they were inside.
Steve smiled almost sadistically, then reached a hand out to rub the side of Tony’s cheek, leaning in closely he whispered. “Since you're so eager to go by titles, I suggest you refer to me as Master. Is that clear, pet?”
Tony poured himself another fresh pot of coffee, taking a break from the stack of papers on his night stand. He read and re-read and didn’t notice how many times he did so until the digital clock next to him flashed 2:45 a.m. He had few questions, and really, he was sure they were things that he needed to ask himself.
When Tony finally gets into a position on his knees, his body is quivering and tears sting his eyes.
“These first meetings are always awkward, no matter how many times you do them, which reminds me, how much experience do you have?” Steve asked, keeping his gaze on Tony’s eyes.
Steve’s brows furrowed for a moment, as if he was analyzing his statement. “Did you think I was going to play a part in that distraction? Fuck you for a solid ten? Then hopefully you can stop thinking about what that question was about? That’s not what I meant when I asked you,” Steve’s hands ran across his hips, then settled there. “If we were going to have sex, it would be something to remember. We’d lick every crevice of each other’s bodies and every inch of skin, because we would want to actually feel each other. I'm not taking part in a grunting session for you to feel better about yourself afterwards. And I’m not fucking you—yet.”
Steve had to resist the urge to shake but failed, his legs nearly buckled at the tight, slick heat around his cock which felt like relief compared to how his arousal had made him feel a lot hotter. His thrusts became fast and hard, shaking the flimsily placed picture frames the drawers leaning against the wall with each push of their bodies colliding. Steve grunted, edging on moaning from how incredibly overwhelming everything is.
“For as long as you keep this up, I’ll keep pushing, darling.” It didn't come out as smooth as Tony would have liked it. His throat held a dull ache that turned sharp with every deep breath he took.
“Good. that’s great. Your piece looks amazing,” Tony said. He wasn't sure what else he was supposed to say. Really, he hadn’t even thought their next encounter through besides them having the most intense sex of his life.
For a moment, Steve pressed his erection against Tony’s steadily growing one, and then backed up with ease, around the island, and out of the kitchen. Tony nearly keeled over, clutching the edge of the countertop and trying to catch his breath. Tony knew Steve could be playful, cocky even (no pun intended), but this was a side of him Tony was utterly
Tony resisted the urge to suck his teeth and repeated the assignment. He wasn’t sure what Steve meant by believing it. Was it really about that? To Tony, execution was everything, show off what he can do to impress, because he’s good at it. And now Steve wanted more than what he’s used to giving. Like he believes it; what the hell did that even mean?
It didn’t take long before Tony was coming, some splattered onto his cheek, some against his brow, his lips, which he hastily licked up. Tony slumped and sat back, huffing and trying to catch his breath. Steve let out a happy sigh, not minding the come on his face one bit, though Tony was gracious enough to wipe it off with a wash cloth.
Really, it was more whining and whimpering, breathing harder and the most beautiful smile breaking out of his face. This was what Steve wanted to see. Drool dribble down Tony’s chin, repeating Steve’s name as his entire body shook, it took tremendous effort for Steve not to come right then and there. Steve was probably gaping at this point, fingers still working as earnestly as ever but his brain short circuiting because he knew no one ever saw Tony like this. A sense of pride washed over him and motivated him to go faster.
Steve's already gone through the motions of jerking off before the briefing, but contemplates if he should try again before seeing Tony. He should probably have a clear head, but figures he’ll be alright. He's at Tony’s on time, greeted with a still business-causal brunet holding a tumbler of some booze. “Punctual as usual,” Tony says before walking off to the living room area. Steve strips his jacket, hangs it up, and sits on the couch, leading Tony to sit on the opposite end.
Steve lifted his foot, and as Tony found himself scrabbling for air again, that same foot landed into his ribs. The tips of his soles digging into his flesh. Tony coughed and grunted in pain. He knew this reaction couldn't be good for his body, but since when has he cared about his personal well being? He knew that Steve wasn't using all of his strength, which frustrated Tony, even though he knew he should be grateful. Steve could kill him if he wanted. Still, in his current state, Steve could slit his throat and Tony would probably come buckets before bleeding out on his priceless Turkish rug.
“It’s you again,” Steve said smoothly, his lips upturned into a grin. This time he was in a crisp white button down and some slacks that had Tony’s eyes lingering for more than a second.
After a week of furiously jerking off whenever he had the chance, and a private jet ride later, he was back home, and was  told to meet with Steve in one of the debriefing rooms. Tony was so close to skipping his ass down to the room it was embarrassing. Maybe there was a small skip to his step as he walked out of the elevator, but no one was watching, and he acted completely normal once he opened the door to the debriefing room.
Once Steve walked away, Tony did a little jig while staring at his palm and grinning, as if this night couldn’t get any more teenager esque. After putting Steve’s number into his phone, he sighed deeply and left the gallery.
Moving his hands from his mouth, he spoke. “Lookin’ good darlin’,” Steve said, drawl apparent and almost breathy. Steve’s arms were folded over his chest, but itched to wrap around a startled Tony who turned around quickly.
His heart is thumping, but that’s a given. Steve’s looking down at him, as if putting him in his place.
“You think so...” his voice dragged a bit as he traced over the armrest of a leather chair with the tips of his fingers. He then sat in the chair, and Tony didn’t notice since he was still taking in everything.
He figured they were past the point of pretending they didn’t notice each other, so he made eye contact this time. Officer handsome let a small smile grace his lips,
“Then take a break, darling.” Tony keeps his voice low, soft and teasing—the type of teasing that has Steve shoving him against any flat surface without hesitation, and fucking him into his place.
Steve says breathlessly. It’s all he hears from the man, the rest is just heavy breathing and the ringing of his belt buckle.
Theoretically, he’s never alone. People are always at his fingertips; the classic tale of a man who has everything but absolutely nothing. Still, he makes himself feel better by routine distractions: the money, the press, and the countless people that go through his bed, a blur of faces he doesn't bother remembering. All of these things are numbers, price tags, tangible items he’d bought, just like the Dolce & Gabbana suit he’s sporting--acquired exclusively from Italy.
“Did you need anything?” Steve said, trying to sound even keeled, though everything Tony said left him not knowing how to properly respond.
Subsequently, the following morning Steve shot him a text about lunch, and Tony agreed. That afternoon, they met at a small family owned place. Steve had a piece of paper lying face down beside him the entire time. Tony found his eyes wandering to the sheet during their light chatter, until finally he asked. “You’re going to make me keep staring, aren’t you?”
“Come to me,” he says smoothly. Tony hesitates, but follows the direction given after only a brief moment. Steve wonders what Tony’s true goals are. Direction? Attention? Is he looking for someone to see him in a way he refuses to see himself? Steve wonders how long it's going to take to crack Tony piece by piece until he’s a literal weeping mess on the floor.
An annoying ring from his phone interrupts the moaning and slapping of skin from the video. It also makes the haze of his orgasm quickly dissipate. Who the hell-- “Hello?” His voice is a bit gravely from his previous activity.
“Finally made time for me? What’s with that? Next thing you know you’ll start getting sleep or something.” Jan shared the same grin.
if he could but he would damn well try. Gagging only turned him on more. Tony pressed two of his fingers in his mouth, sucking and licking. They were nowhere near Steve’s size, but he needed to be filled somehow.
They'd stretched for a few minutes, It felt pretty good,  his muscles flexed and then relaxed. He also definitely got to see a peek of skin between Steve’s sweatpants and apparently size extra, extra small t shirt (Tony wasn't complaining—no one's complaining). Besides Tony feeling like his lungs were being lit with a match, hacking as if he had bronchitis, and his legs nearly shaking after a pathetic two miles, everything went better than expected (and then Steve said they were doing four next week).
“It better be soon. I need to judge him for myself.” She said firmly, interrupting his worrying thoughts.
Tony does so, a small grin on his face as if he’d gotten through to Steve, as if he’s used to getting his way. Swiftly, Steve grabs the back of Tony’s head and slams it into the oak desk in front of him.
“You made several mistakes, but I’ll tell your biggest one," his voice is calm as he speaks. "Coming into this facility and pretending it’s yours. I built this place. I tore it to pieces and rebuilt it in my image, successfully.” He grips tighter, feeling the crunch under his fingertips.
Tony was so close, so deliciously close and fighting off the shock that shook him to the core. He stopped and turned to face Steve, both of them making eye contact this time and hesitantly, Tony looked down at Steve’s cock. Beautiful, uncut and bigger than expected, the head turning a reddish purple color from the blood flow. He reached over, wanting to taste but restraining himself and just stroking instead.
After Steve deemed his hand decently tongue bathed, he pulled away and zipped up his pants. He left without another word, leaving Tony there on his knees in his come-staind slacks, and starting to feel how bruised he really was. He was still in a good headspace, and didn’t even need alcohol to ride it out. Tony sprawled himself near the wet patch that contained Tony’s saliva and Steve’s come. He closed his eyes gently and replayed the events. He didn’t know if there’ll be a next time but he could hold onto these memories for the time being, and the bruises that’ll eventually fade.
Jan crossed her arms. “Nope, not until I meet him I’m not, which begs the question, when am I meeting Mr. army brat god.”
“Jesus, Stark,” he grunts as he feels Tony’s mouth take more of him down, and then his throat god his throat-- no one should be able to do that, and yet Tony is taking him down seamlessly, as though he were born to do so. Steve lifts his hips and grabs a fistful of Tony’s hair, fucking his mouth and groaning when he hears Tony gag and feels it. His nerves alight, every single one in tune with Tony’s mouth sucking him dry. He can feel the hand in Tony’s hair shake, his hips slowly losing rhythm.
Steve lets a satisfied grin pass his features, pushing all the way to the hilt in one smooth go, not letting Tony adjust before starting up a rough pace. He anchors one hand on Tony’s shoulder and another digging into his hip, making sure to leave purplish bruises on his immaculately well-kept skin. Tony’s mouth is moving to indicate he’s trying to form words, but he’s only moaning, both of his hands on either side of his face, his pinky finger pressed against his open mouth. He looks ruined and Steve has barely gotten started. Steve stops for a moment, pushing both of Tony’s legs up near his head to get in deeper, which makes Tony shudder and let out a sharp cry. Steve knows he’s hit the man’s prostate directly, and he keeps thrusting at that angle, enjoying the sight of Tony debauched  and utterly wrecked. He feels nails rake down his bicep, probably leaving welts, which is turns Steve on even more. Tony is drooling and grinning like a mad man, his toes curl and he’s clenching around Steve’s cock. Right then, Steve decides he wants to milk Tony dry. “Come you fucking cock hungry whore,” Steve demands, digging his fingers into Tony’s skin harder.
His skin felt clammy, even when Tony’s cool hands touched over his bare skin he felt hot. The brunet worked his lips over Steve’s inner thigh, biting and sucking over the exposed patch of skin. As soon as Tony’s teeth made contact with his skin, he tensed, trying to ward off his orgasm, writhing and whining until the sweet pain stopped.
“No, but I will give you your fifty dollar ticket, courtesy of officer handsome.” Officer Rogers said, voice laced with obvious amusement and sarcasm.The man turned on his heels after handing Tony back his license, registration and shiny new ticket.
“Fuck—Steve!” Tony nearly shouts, trying not lose it at this point. This position has every thrust hitting so much deeper, he can nearly feel each drag in and out of his entrance. The hand at his hip quickly darts around to clamp over his mouth, and Tony takes the opportunity to moan louder.
Steve’s eyes darted between Tony’s lips and his eyes, he then settled on the night sky. Although distorted and tinted orange from light pollution, it was still a beautiful. “Just not in the mood today, Stark.” It was more of a grumble than a clear sentence.
“Sex with no attachments, an exploration of some things…kinks.” The last part is said with a mischievous grin, which makes Steve scoff a bit.
Steve would probably try and talk him out of it, asking Tony if he’s sure he could take his thick cock down his throat, and Tony wouldn’t
A hand around his cock had him coming, hips jutting up and gasping, tugging at the sheets so hard he thought he’d tear them. Seconds later, he flopped against the sheets, meeting Steve’s eyes and smiling, his eyes glazed over and feeling exhausted yet better than he has in a while.
Steve pauses for a moment. “Now, suck my cock,” he says, and Tony complies eagerly, getting his pants unbuttoned and letting out a small sound when Steve’s cock pops out of his boxers. Steve feels Tony’s mouth hit the head of his cock, so warm and wet and everything he needs to satisfy the red hot lust running through his veins.
“That’s all you’re worth. You should be grateful I even let you taste my cock.” He pulls Tony by his hair so he’s face to face with Steve’s come. Tony’s tongue darts out to lick his upper lip nervously. He hesitates before licking over the thick black kevlar near his upper thigh. He moves higher up his unbuttoned trousers, sucking on the fabric at his groin to get some of the fluid that's seeped in. His tongue works patterns that let out a strange noise when the texture of the fabric meets Tony’s tongue. Some of the come has landed on his belt buckle, some over his midsection, all of it was lapped up carefully, and with some eagerness behind it. Steve’s glad he’s a man of self restraint because this would drive a lesser man crazy.
“You must have played the pretend game a lot as a child, because you’re doing a good job of it right now.”
The sheets weren’t fully on Steve, so he could only hear the shifting of soft cotton fabric, which turned Tony on greatly, knowing that the same man who’s jacking off next to him right now was the one who'll be giving him orders the next day. The thought alone almost made him come, almost. He’d learned to bring himself close to the edge, then relax and stop himself from coming too quick.
Steve wishes he could take a picture of Tony’s face right now. He resists the urge to chuckle from how purely taken aback he looks. Sputtering a bit, Tony speaks. “Did you hit your head?”
Steve’s stance changed, crossing his arms which made those incredible muscles stand out more.  “What makes you sure I’m interested?” He was trying to disguise a smile again, he couldn’t fool Tony.
The hand was gone after a minute or two, and then Steve was drawing at his desk. He could hear the scraping and scratching of pencil against paper, only imagining what the images probably looked like based on the various unfinished paintings up on the wall. Every once in a while, Steve’s gaze would fall back onto Tony, flashing a grin, then continuing to work with a hardened expression.
It’s a game to see who will give in first, and to no one's surprise, they’re about even. It’s all provocation and prodding, Steve is quick to anger and Tony is just as quick to react. Right now, however, Steve finds himself slipping at Tony’s will, and for a man who puts emphasis on the suppression of urges it’s a huge disappointment to watch where his self control ends and where Tony’s victory begins.
Really, Tony was half hard from the notion of talking to Steve about masturbating in the same room, so it wasn’t hard to proceed with getting himself erect. Even strokes that had the bed sheets make a scratching noise. He was trying not to come off as too obvious, even though they’d agreed this was okay. Still, he felt awkward, and how could he not? They’d just got done finishing each other’s sentences about jerking off, and Steve was fucking gung ho about it. Tony hadn’t even been fully serious.
A few moments of silence passed, Tony trying to close his eyes and not think about going to sleep so he could sleep. As usual, it didn’t work, so he decided to take in the décor he hadn't bothered noticing after finding out he’d be sharing his room. Everything had an old country vibe to it; wooden chairs, a small closet that housed just enough of the few items they brought along, and the modest lamp that sat atop an oak nightstand. Really, the lamp wasn’t necessary considering the amount of light that shone through the window, be it sun or moon. It almost made him want to turn and see what Steve looked like with the moonlight shining on him.
“Hey, how was your day?” Steve answered, followed by saying he’d be right back, Tony assumed he was talking to other people.
Wrong answer apparently, or right, as far as Tony was concerned. In a flash, Steve's boot was back on his neck, harder this time, enough to feel all the air leave his windpipe at once.
Steve looked at Tony briefly, then cast his eyes elsewhere, he could feel his throat getting dry despite his fruity drink. “Yeah,” he said.
Tony thought for a second, then remembered that Steve had asked how does sex felt for him. If Tony were being honest, he did think about it a few times. Sex for him had always been for instant gratification. It was a form of release or a coping mechanism, a pleasurable distraction that was sweaty and quick and only mattered if an orgasm was involved. That was sex to him, and considering that Tony was an impatient man, that would probably always be sex to him.
Tony didn’t take off his clothing, he kept their mouths together, tongues teasing and prodding. Occasionally, Tony bit Steve’s lower lip, making it hurt just enough for the blond to moan or gasp. Tony reached a hand down to grope at Steve’s crotch, and fuck, Steve felt so damn hot. He sounded desperate and needy, but that didn’t matter, all that mattered was Tony touching him.
“Well I can tell there's nothing wrong based on that eloquent answer. Oh, and you haven’t looked me in the eye since you’ve arrived.”
Steve knocked the hat off of his head so he could grip Tony’s hair and pull back, kissing along the tan skin of his neck, and then bit just the way he knew Tony needed it. Tony let out an
Tony was trembling, he usually did when he was angry, getting on his knees he scooted himself closer. Steve leaned in and wiped the tears threatening to spill from his eyes. “This is good, because I know you want to please me, and I know you can, it just takes time. It’s only our first session.” He kissed Tony’s cheek then the top of his forehead.
Tony didn't exactly know when this started, or rather he did but things began to blend together as the minutes went on. It was systematic really, a build up of Tony's lack of patience and Steve's unrepentant cruelty towards him that caused it. Specifying was difficult, even though Tony was usually good with these things. Despite being an alcoholic, he could remember people, times, and events down to the most minuscule detail. He knew they had gotten into a bigger fight than usual, Tony with his scathing sarcastic remarks. He considered himself calm in situations of stress, being Iron Man and all, but Steve Rogers wasn't a typical stressor. It was almost as if he got off on making Tony uncomfortable and hurt, he had an uncanny way of knowing when Tony was offended, and what buttons to push to get him there. Which wasn’t an easy task, considering what he allowed to get to him. He didn’t make it this far in the world by being easily offended. Steve had a ruthless way with words, comments that manifested like the tiniest slivers of fiberglass under his skin. Itching and irritating, bothering him to the point of doing anything to make it stop, so he tended to lash out.
Tony wanted to blame Steve for this, but he had to admit he was a huge factor in the equation. They both know Tony wanted it.
Before Tony could respond, Steve took the glass of scotch from his hand and sat it down on the coffee table that probably cost more than his apartment. Steve got Tony onto his back (it’s not like Tony put up a fight, again that smug look on his face that Steve swore he was going wipe off of his face) and gripped the belt around his waist, unbuckling it with ease.
Once he came down from his orgasmic high, Tony shakily dragged himself to the shower. He'd worked himself up way too much to just clean up with tissues and call it a night. After a quick, hot shower, Tony climbed into bed and didn’t think about what Steve might be up to next.
Tony did so without hesitation, nearly gasping when Steve pulled him into a kiss. It was more than anticipation. Every chance to taste Steve’s lips was like a breath of fresh air. His hands reached up to either side of Steve’s face, their rhythm in sync. Tony wanted to be frantic about it, but Steve refused him. Forcing them into something slow, tasting just enough to set Tony’s nerve endings on fire.
When finally in front of him, Steve thinks about possible scenarios, all degrading and horrific, but he settles for buildup. “Take off your boxers, sit on the desk and jerk off. When you get close, stop. if you come, I’ll slit your throat.”
“P-Please.” Tony tried to get it out. It was amazing that he could even find his voice with the thick soles pressing into his adam's apple.
Steve had to gall to casually nod and head towards home. He had to have noticed. It wasn’t as if Tony was going to point it out, mainly because he wanted to keep staring without the awkward
Steve had found himself trying to get a rise out of Tony, pushing him and even worse, ignoring his emotional needs to see how far he could go. And hell, Tony wasn’t without fault. Matter of fact, he'd seemed to thrive on it, never hesitating to do the same, but he'd used his sharp tongue to his advantage to cut deeper.
in bold, red lettering. It flashed, taunting him and letting him know he had at least six more hours until dawn would save him from this form of torture.
Unfortunately, as things would have it, Tony was scheduled for a week away in some other country discussing business matters, and it was killing him. The entire time, he debated on calling Steve or skyping him or something--anything to hear his voice so he could take the edge off. Being the over thinker Tony was, he didn’t call or skype or anything, he simply waited patiently (as patient as Tony could be).
Tony immediately got on his knees. The thick canvas fabric of Steve’s pants didn’t allow as much detail to come across as gym shorts or sweatpants did, but it was still obvious Steve wasn't wearing underwear once again. He darted out his tongue, licking the outline of Steve’s cock, then sucking along the fabric just to feel the thickness tease his mouth, to confirm it’ll be so much bigger than he can handle.
The event was marked evening casual, so Tony dressed himself in a well-fitting suit that fell into that category, yet looked incredible on him. Yes, he was trying to impress Steve, and yes it did bother him slightly that Steve seemed like the type to look for something deeper than aesthetics; something he couldn’t quite place his finger on.
It was rhetorical, he assumed, considering talking was near impossible and the only thing he could let out were choked gasps. Also, the obvious point being that he probably started this-- at least the way he usually did. As he was thinking of formulating a response that would be choked and raspy and snarky, of course, that same boot struck him across the face. It was as if Steve could see the twinkle in his eye. Tony simultaneously sucked in a breathe while choking on blood that left his mouth. He could feel his teeth launch into his jaw as it connected, the hard leather splits his lip. Tony's cock was leaking at his point. He was heaving on the floor, grinning wildly as he looked up at Steve.
Steve rolled his eyes and rubbed the outside of Tony's entrance, he hadn’t applied lube to his fingers yet but was enjoying the soft pants that left Tony. Steve opened the lube and squirted a bit on his fingers, three to be exact. Tony was looking down, a spectator really, but not for long. Steve pushed one single finger in, and Tony reacted perfectly, head thrown back and thighs shaking soft enough to let Steve know there’s enough room to make him lose it more.
“No, I am not a clone. Yes, I’m from an alternate universe. And no, I am not Captain America. It’s a pleasure to meet you too, Mr. Stark, and don’t worry, I know plenty about you.”
“Well pick one, because it's the only decision you’ll get to make tonight.” The words are whispered next to Tony’s ear, low and dark. Tony visibly shivers, then looks up in awe, as if he didn’t know Steve had it in him. Frankly speaking, they know nothing of each other besides the small moments they share. Who knows, Tony might surprise him tonight, too.
