But other than that he always hung out with Bucky. He wasn't shy, had never been a shy or quiet kid, but he just wasn't that interested in hanging out with anyone in the school. He'd always felt out of place in there, and most of the kids there had either teased him when he was small or just ignored him and why would he want to hang out with anyone there?
“If it is, it’s the most convincing green screen or CGI effects I have ever seen. Pictures from satellites don’t look this convincing.” Thor leaned against one of the chairs’ backrests and stared out the window.
“Ugh, okay, so here’s what we’re gonna do. I’m gonna go back the way we came and see if I get any signal and if I can call for help. In the meantime you kids stay here and wait for me to come back.” Clint narrowed his eyes at her and walked away from what he and Thor had been doing.
“Cheater. You are a dirty cheater, Captain.” Steve just smiled and tried to look innocent, but it was hard not to start laughing at his boyfriend, who
But at the same time, to go to space and see those new planets… to see new and strange places and creatures that no one on Earth had even dreamed about seeing or existed. He couldn’t deny that the scientist in him wasn’t thinking about it and wanted to see and do it all. Plus, he’d always told himself since his mom died that she would be up here among the stars, despite how he knew that it just couldn’t be true. So in a way, he felt closer to her up here than he’d ever been on Earth since her death.
For the first few minutes Tony was lying there, spluttering and coughing up saltwater and trying to wrap his brain around what had just happened and how fast it had happened. It all couldn’t have been more than five minutes, tops, but it had felt like an eternity before he was finally back up on dry land.
“Yeah, yeah, keep telling yourself that Rogers. But I’m telling you that she’s not gonna be back for a long, long while.”
at you. Not for something like this. I’m furious at him; I want to punish him for making you feel like this and being this scared to tell me what happened. But I will never be mad at you because some guy comes up to you and forces himself on you.”
Tony laughed and shook his head at his husband’s antics and pressed a kiss to his cheek. Steve’s small frown melted away and he nuzzled his nose against Tony’s in an Eskimo kiss, wrapping both arms around Tony, placing his chin on top of his head. Then Tony yawned and slumped against Steve’s chest, suddenly exhausted. Which, considering the emotional rollercoaster his evening had been, wasn’t really surprising.
“Ay, that is correct. Thor Odinson is my name. My father moved here for work and I started going to your fair school about a year ago.” Steve looked up from his sketchbook again, this time a bit more interested.
“Of course. But first,” He took the ring out of the box and gently put it on Tony’s ring finger. Tony gently pulled his hand out of Steve’s grip to get a closer look at it, and now that he wasn’t in complete surprise by Steve proposing and he got a closer look at it, he recognized it very quickly.
“Alright, alright, sorry for trying to help. I’ll leave you to sorting out that rat’s nest on your head on your own if you so wish. If you can.” His smile widened a little when he heard Tony mock growl at him and snorted out a laugh when he felt his boyfriend push him towards the bathroom, barely moving him an inch.
Steve usually doesn’t respond with anything after that; only tightens his grip on Tony and lets himself cry into his boyfriend’s shoulder. But he always thinks the same time.
Steve groaned as he and Natasha finally made it up to the communal floor in the tower, dropping his bag by the dinner table and sat down, folding his arms on the table and resting his forehead on the cool wood. He vaguely registered JARVIS saying
The kids stared out the window, eyes wide open and jaws almost hitting the floor as they took in what they were seeing, because outside the window, spinning in its orbit slowly and painstakingly real, was planet Earth. In fact, they were seeing the continent of North America right outside the window, as well as the big blue from the planet’s oceans and white clouds.
Steve just sighed, moonily and just a tad dopily as he rested one arm on the counter and his head in his hand, staring out the windows after her. “She said yes, Sam. She actually said yes! And she kissed me! She kissed me on the cheek!” Sam nodded and flipped a page in his textbook.
“I go there too. Though I’m a sophomore, and I’m not an engineer. I’m an artist.” She smirked at him.
Tony smiled and huffed a small laugh, a few tears forming in his eyes before blinking them away. “Yeah? And how did that work for you?”
So she tried to distract herself from it by working with her projects. She had been working for almost two months trying to create a real, actual A.I and was determined to make it work. It would be a learning robot that would do things for her around the workshop, like getting her coffee or make her smoothies or clean after her when she was too busy with work to be bothered to clean up her own messes. And it was coming along really well, until she accidently pulled on the wrong wire and the robot rotated in a 180° angle and the arm of the robot smacked her hard against the face and almost knocked her out cold as she hit the floor very hard.
Tony smiled again, his eyes getting a little wet with emotion and still clutching those dog tags very tightly, when a voice broke through his thoughts, making his head jerk up and his breath got stuck in his throat.
“Surprise me. You know what I like, doll.” Tony mock-grimaced and batted at his hand with one arm while covering his hair with the other arm.
Tony nodded and had finally stopped coughing. “Yeah, I’m fine. Thanks.” He turned back to the Adonis, smiling wryly again. “You didn’t exactly learn Italian in High School, did you?”
“Well, I didn’t see you come with any bright ideas or initiatives Rogers, so maybe you should just-“ Then the lights went off again and they turned to look back at the podium as the screen appeared. Steve turned to Bruce, now looking very concerned.
“So, how are the studies going?” Bucky groaned again and took a huge bite of his blueberry scone. His long brown hair was shaggy and he looked like he hadn’t slept very well.
is what made everything they’d both been through up until today worth it. All the fights they’d gotten into, all the trouble and low points they’d fought their way out of and all the war he had seen in his tours of combat, it had all been worth it, because at the end of the day, he had Tony there to brighten his day and fill his life with love. Everything that they had been through together had only made their bond stronger and all the storms that they'd weathered made Steve absolutely sure that there was nothing that they couldn't get through as long as they were together. Sure, it was probably not the last time they’d ever hear from Howard Stark or have other troubles come into their lives from nowhere, but Steve knew they would get through it, just like they always had before. Together.
Steve had been everything he ever wanted in a boyfriend and more; he was kind and caring, funny, witty and always seemed to be able to make Tony smile. He was one of the few people in the world that could out-stubborn him and wasn’t afraid to call him on his bullshit or get into arguments with him- both light-hearted ones and more serious ones- and refuse to back down before Tony did or before one of them made a good enough point to prove that the other was wrong. He was also always there to ground Tony whenever he was getting lost in work or just needed to get his head out of his crazy ideas and reined him in when he was being reckless.
“You got something you wanna say Rumlow or are just gonna stand there hog time from my summer break? ‘Cause I got stuff to do, places to be and none of them are you.” He smirked mockingly and made lewd hand gesture. “Unless you’re into that stuff, ‘cause I’d love to see how much you like me shoving my arrow right up your ass.”
“Nah buddy, I don’t think so. First of all, we’re miles away from the city, which means she’d have to go quite a while to actually get any reception. Second, I could see she didn’t want to deal with this situation at all, or us. I’ll bet you ten bucks that she just wanted to get away from us for a while. She’ll probably not be back for a while.”
Janet cooed and crawled up to sit beside her, hugging her close again. “I know Tones. But I really don’t think he’s a bad guy. Based on everything you’ve said about him, based on what he said when he didn’t know you were there, I think he really likes you. You should at least give him a chance to surprise you before you decide he’s no good.”
“You mean your addiction for caffeine, right? I swear, sometimes I think you love coffee more than you love me.” Tony shoved him playfully with a teasing smirk.
"It looks a little like a box, but maybe someone stole the car and we've gotten stolen with it or something?" Tony looked up from comforting Bruce and over at the others.
Natasha turned to him, her face softening slightly and she looked him over, before grabbing the backpack he had dropped on the floor when he fell. “Sometimes I think you like pissing off these guys until they pound you into the ground. What if one day I’m not here to save your ass?” Clint rolled his eyes and dusted off his jeans and t-shirt.
Steve had heard enough. He released Tony’s hand and placed his arms around Tony, pulling him close and held him tightly. Tony buried his face into Steve’s shirt, now sobbing uncontrollably and his arms wrapped around Steve’s stomach, clinging to him like a child and between his shuddering breaths he cried out ‘I’m sorry’ into Steve’s chest, over and over again.
“Where… Where are we, really?” But before any of them could give any sort of answer, another voice joined them.
lets you forget it. "-We have decided to let you to a camp this summer! So you can meet other kids your age and have some fun!"
It almost made her puke to say all that stuff. Reed was an asshole and Justin Hammer was a pathetic little wanna-be of scientist, inventor and businessman. She wouldn't give any of those guys the time of day, let alone ask them on a date with her.
He didn’t see Steve’s face but he heard him chuckle fondly and held him a little tighter and kissed his hair. “I love you too, Tony.”
Still, it didn’t stop him from trying. That was just how Tony was. Never stop, never quit and never give up, no matter what the odds.
Steve couldn't help but smile and laughed a little. Tony. Of course Tony knew he was home. JARVIS must have told him that he was home. He hummed, pretending he was thinking deeply and tapped a finger against his chin.
“I’m sure I can fix it. I’m really good with engines, it shouldn’t take too long.” Steve rolled his eyes but he also started to get of the car.
"No, no, not like that, Tones! You flirt with guys who want to have a quick fuck and they always make it clear that's what they want. When a guy starts blushing and stutter and can barely talk around you it doesn't sound like he wants a quick fuck from you."
Her eyes widened. Was that how Steve saw himself? Had she been making him feel self-conscious about his own status in life? Had she been rubbing it in his face somehow?
The guy was fucking gorgeous! He had the body of a Greek God (or would that be a Roman God, considering they were in Italy?); he was tall, well-built and strong with muscles in places Tony didn’t know existed. And the fact that his clothes were wet and clung to his body in just the right ways and showed of his muscles perfectly certainly didn’t help Tony’s staring. His hair was blonde- though it was lying flat against his head and face now, and shone like gold in the sunlight and his eyes were as blue as the ocean below them. Which Tony might have found ironic if he wasn’t so captivated by how handsome this guy was.
They had walked into a big room, almost entirely made of white and light grey metal and a few strange contraptions were scattered across the room. In one corner was a machine that looked like a cross between a computer and a super advanced hairdryer, with a seat formed under a big bowl-like apparatus, which was connected to the big machine and had a keypad and a display on its side. In another corner was a device that looked like a cross between a dining table from a diner- one of those round ones with a bench that went around the whole table and were connected to each other- and a big round dome that covered the whole table. There a door close behind the hair dryer machine, and two doors on each side of the room, each with a small display on the right side, but they were at the moment closed and maybe even locked if the red symbol of a closed lock on the displays were any indication.
“You’re my sister, Toni. I’ll always be in your corner, just like you’ve been in mine.” She squeezed her hand again and then sat back up again. “So, where will you go?” Toni shrugged and grabbed a pillow and hugged it to her chest while also fiddling with the seams on the pillowcase.
“No Steve, you can’t punch him. He’s a squishy human, your punches crush steel, it’s out of the question.”
“Just… just hold me, please?” Steve definitely didn’t need to be asked twice. He quickly wrapped both of his arms around his lithe frame and pulled him close, leaning his head against Tony’s and Tony rested his forehead in the crook of his neck.
“I must agree with you. It does sound much more interesting to go on an adventure rather than stay at a summer camp I did not even wish to attend in the first place. I think I may just vote for this as well.” Tony and Clint immediately made sounds of approval, but Bruce just looked very apprehensive.
Tony had never been a particularly good swimmer. He had learned, obviously he had learned to swim, but he had never been too fond of swimming or water in general.  But once he managed to get his head above water, he’d felt that the cuff of his jeans was caught on something and he couldn’t yank it free. And because of how deep it was and the fact that it was his cuff that was stuck, he could barely keep his head above the water. As he tried to pull his leg free and keep himself afloat with his arms, waves kept splashing into his face, mouth and eyes, making him swallow or accidently inhale salt water, which made him cough and splutter and made it much harder to keep his head above the water or avoid new waves, never mind calling for help.
want to stay here in a cold gazebo in Central Park while it was storming around them, possibly for hours. But he didn't want to leave him all alone here either, and Tony was just about as stubborn as Steve himself was, so to get him to walk out of there would be quite a challenge.
Bucky wasn't wrong about any off it, he'd always hated bullies and never backed down from a fight or a challenge and it had ended in more fights than he could count or remember. And that had been before he'd hit his growth spurt and started to get his muscles after starting to play football.
He suddenly fell forward and hit the ground and only realized once he was lying on the floor that someone had tripped him. He heard laughs from somewhere behind him and he quickly got up on his knees so he could see who it was.
And speaking of the devil, he didn’t have to wait for very long after having started to pay the bills before he heard the key turn in the lock and then the door opened. There was a rustle of clothes as Steve took his jacket off and then he came in with a paper bag in his arms. Steve smiled warmly at Tony and placed the bag on the kitchen counter.
Steve's eyes widened- if possible- even more and almost yelled, "NO!" It almost made her wince and he immediately reined himself in and said, in a much softer voice, but he was still very distressed. "No, of course not Toni, you're not swallow, you're amazing! You're smart a-and funny and brave and-"
Tony tried to grin while fighting against every urge to scream or cry to throw a tantrum over this. "Okay, fine. Sounds like it'll be a blast." Not.
She leaned on the counter, looking him straight in the eyes. “Long enough to hear you think you’re not good enough to breathe the same air as me. That you think I’m too good for you.” And now she looked a little hurt, and Steve immediately felt bad at even the idea that he might have hurt her. “Is that what you think of me, Steve? You think I’m so swallow that I judge my friends by their bank account? Or how many facts they can cram into their heads? Or how successful they
"I know it might not seem like your cup of tea, honey. But you spend so much time working in your workshop whenever you're not in school and it's just not healthy. You need to get outside, get some sun and fresh air and I really think a camp away from the city and away from everything going on here could do you some good."
“I’m fine Natasha, he barely even touched me. And you didn’t have intervene like that, I was fine.” She rolled her eyes and handed him the bag.
“Because I say so, now come on!” Then, suddenly, an loud humming started to accompany the light and hissing and it all got closer and closer and louder and louder. The kids shared a look between themselves before hurrying back into the car, slamming the doors behind them, but still keeping a watchful eye on what was going on outside. Steve looked out his window and bit his lip.
He only grumbled and threw a pair of socks at him. “I know what you are attempting to do Loki, and it won’t work. I can’t say that I’m too happy with how all of this has transpired, but I am simply trying to make the best of it.” He grabbed a couple of jeans, a few t-shirts and a couple of hoodies before stuffing it all into his bag. “Also, I don’t seem to recall you having any better plans for the summer. What are you going to do with all your free time, exactly?”
He was thinking of what to order, about whether he’d rather want pizza or Chinese food tonight, when suddenly his phone started ringing. He looked up and over to the coffee table where he’d placed the phone earlier and just stared at it dumbly for a few long seconds. Who could be calling him at this hour? Most of his friends were probably having dinner right about now too, so it couldn’t be them. Maybe his boss wanted him to cover a shift because of last second changes? Or maybe-
"And then there's me. Steve Rogers, scrappy kid from Brooklyn with no money, a bit above average intelligence and have been studying Art for almost two years and has nothing to offer anyone."
Everybody jerked away from the window and started to look around, trying to spot the speaker. It was a deep voice, powerful, strong and commanding and unmistakably masculine, yet at the same time there was a strange undertone in the voice. Like it wasn’t entirely human. Also, the voice seemed to come from a speaker as opposed to from somewhere in the room from an actual person.
No, she'd have to go through with it. Hey, maybe Steve would realize that she wasn't who he thought she was and wouldn't ask for any second dates? Just because she cared about him didn't mean that he would care about her once he saw her true colors. Might spare him the effort and heartache to cut it off before it could grow into something that would hurt them both.
“Still hiding in the bathroom, Romanov? Or maybe you’re drinking that whole bottle of vodka you brought to school, huh?” That was Sharon. Because of course it was Sharon, she’d hated her guts since Coach Fury had told her she could be an amazing cheerleader if she wanted to be, probably the best on the team. Natasha, of course, had no interest of becoming a cheerleader, but Sharon still acted like she had been wronged and did everything she could to make Natasha’s life miserable. Especially since she realized that Natasha couldn’t fight back, no matter how much she wanted to.
She glared over at the robot, gritting her teeth in pain as the sore spot throbbed against the icepack. "Pray to whatever God you have that I don't bruise or I’ll take you apart and turn you into a coffee blender. Or a wine rack."
“Well then, let me talk a little clearer, maybe they’ll pick this up: you are a fucking freak that even the circus didn’t want, so what makes you think we want you here? You and your freaky sister were put in the system as orphan kids, and why do think that is? Because your parents didn’t love you, they probably didn’t even like you! So why don’t you crawl back to the circus or whatever, find some place that actually want you there, if you actually find something.” Clint’s fingers itched and he wanted so badly to punch him in the face, and he almost did, when another voice cut through the crowd.
“It’s hard enough to deal with Stark, I don’t need more of his kind.” She had said once, but it had been with a very, tiny curve of her lip, which was as close to a teasing smirk you could get out of Natasha. Tony had played up the ‘hurt and wounded’ act he always did when someone on the team teasingly insulted him or called him out when he was being silly, but he too had been sporting a small smirk.
Clint and Natasha also started to look around the room, though Natasha seemed to follow Clint around just so he wouldn’t touch anything rather than try to find a way out. Thor ran up to join Tony by one of the doors, but Bruce stumbled over to the hairdryer machine and sat down on the seat, leaning his head back against the metal and closed his eyes, taking deep breaths and tried to calm himself. While this room wasn’t as bad as the metal box or the car had been, the fact that the windows were covered and the doors were closed, made it all feel like they were still in a box.
“I believe I have found a manual of sorts! Perhaps the answers on how to steer the ship can be found in here!” Clint glared over him and almost slapped the book out of his hands.
Steve had more or less gotten used to this and he was very touched to have a boyfriend who cared about him and wanted him to have good presents for his birthday. And after they got married it meant so much more that his husband loved him so much, and did consider letting up on the rule a little and maybe raise it to 500$, just for Tony.
“Yeah, maybe the Watcher guy wants his hair to look great at all times? Maybe that’s what we’re here to do, spread his ideas of hairstyles over the galaxy!” Tony laughed before standing up and circled around the thing. Thor smirked and sat down on the seat, looking up at the upside down bowl over him.
“I don’t know, but I’ve never seen anything like this before, it’s probably some kind of secret lab or something. I still say we’ve been kidnapped, the guys might come here and cut off a finger or ear to send to our parents.” Steve rolled his eyes and looked at him, mostly annoyed but Natasha could see if he wasn’t quite as convinced as he probably wanted to be.
it necessarily. There’s a part of me that is curious about going on adventures and what we might find. I mean it
The kids find themselves on a strange spaceship, flying just above Planet Earth and meet the mysterious Watcher. He offers them a choice, to go on a mission through the galaxy or get sent back to summer camp. What will they choose?
"Toni, would you like to… go out… on a date... with me?" Steve was red like a tomato in the face and sweating like crazy at the moment, like he was afraid she would slay him and not just say no.
“’Kay. So that happened.” Steve snorted and shook his head with a smile that was both slightly exasperated and blown away at the same time.
She rested her head on Toni’s shoulder and Toni smiled softly, leaning her head against Janet’s and they sat like that for a while. “Thanks Jan. It really means a lot that you’re saying this.” Janet reached out, took her hand squeezed it.
Steve’s cheeks flushed a bright red and smiled brightly, if a bit sheepishly and bent down to kiss Tony’s cheek in return. “Well, I’m very glad you did. But I was hoping to give you one more thing tonight.”
She’d just gotten back from gym class, which she was very, very good at, but she could always feel the other girls glare at her and throw dirty looks at her. And she didn’t really care about what they thought of her, normally, but it did tear at her to constantly know and hear what they were thinking about her, whispering and talking behind her back or try to trip her up or make her feel like trash, as much as she liked to pretend that it didn’t.
“No, guys get back here! We don’t know what that is; we’d better stay here. Let’s get back in the car!” Tony turned to look at her over his shoulder, raised eyebrow and looking a bit defiant.
Tony looked up at him and smirked a little at him. “Hey.” Bruce flushed a little at having been caught staring at him, but tried to smile like he hadn’t.
“Okay, let’s switch it up a little. I’ll call and order some Chinese food and you pick out the worst, most laughable movie you can find on Netflix. I’m in the mood for a bad movie night and to laugh at terrible effects and bad acting.” And Tony immediately lit up and lunged for the remote.
“You’re trash!” Sharon yelled and Natasha heard the water get turned off and then she heard the scraping of a plastic bag being dragged across the floor. She knew what was coming, because it always did. She reached for backpack, pulled out her umbrella and opened it just in time for a big pile of trash and water hit her from above, the smell of garbage, old food and used tampons and sanitary pads attacking her nostrils along with dirty sink water.
“…You heard that, right?” Steve nodded slowly, making sure to keep his hands to himself. As much as he wanted to hold and comfort Tony when he looked like this, he knew better than to do before he made it clear that he was open for it. It would only make things worse and make Tony pull away even more.
In the corner of his eye he also saw another, smaller table where Tony Stark was sitting with two other, slightly older kids: a girl with long red hair and freckles and a well built, tall, African American guy. He kinda recognized the guy, as he was on the football team but he had never talked to him. Though he was sure he was a James, just like Bucky.
Steve’s body went cold for one long second before his blood started to boil. Howard. Of course he’d somehow managed to find out about their engagement. He had no idea how the man could have found out about it since neither Steve or Tony had posted anything about on any social media and they had only told their closest friends about it, but it didn’t really matter. Howard had somehow learned about it and was trying to tell Tony to break it off.
Pierce did move back a little, but he was still far too close for Thor’s liking. He rolled his eyes and leaned against the lockers, looking rather annoyed now. “Seriously Foster, what do you see in that guy? He’s a total freak, I mean have you heard how he talks?” Jane smacked him again, this time in the face and threatened him with a fist.
But as he made his way towards his next class, he felt someone yank on his hoodie and pull him backwards. He yelped and almost tripped, dropping his books on the floor, one of then landing on his foot. He looked up at the person who had pulled him back and saw it was Emil Blonsky and Thaddeus Ross, who had been out to get him for years. And Bruce wasn’t entirely sure why if he’d done anything to this guy, but since when did that ever matter to a bully?
Steve smiled widely up at him. “Tony Stark, you are the love of my life, my best friend and I want to be your partner in everything. So I ask you, will you marry me?”
"Wow, that was… certainly something." He tried to sound somewhat glad because he knew she just wanted him to be happy, but he had a sneaking suspicion that he wouldn't like whatever was connected to his parents sitting him down to watch that stupid commercial.
For a few seconds Steve just stood there, too surprised to do anything. Then a determined smirk spread over his face and he took off after Tony. After all, it was one of the things they both had in common: they both liked to win.
“Really? What does he do?” Thor looked over at him, seemingly a bit surprised that he spoke again, and then smiled again.
Natasha and Steve eyed each other with raised eyebrows and folded arms over their chests. It was a look that said
Tony raised his eyebrow, amused and smirked. “My favorite dish for dinner, homemade and everything, dessert, cuddles and kisses and now more? Why Mr. Rogers, if I didn’t know better I’d say you were trying to seduce me.”
Then he was forced to look at a few other tables, and he only recognized a few of the kids. Bruce Banner from science class- who he had defended from bullies once or twice-, Jane Foster who was Thor’s girlfriend (he was sitting there with her too), her best friend Darcy, Reed and Susan and a few others who were classified as ‘nerds’ and were mocked for it.
“At least now you’ll smell better.” She heard laughing from other girls, other mindless little cheerleaders that followed Sharon everywhere like lambs, before they left the room and slammed the door behind them.
“Okay, let’s just this this over with.” He locked the car and slowly started to make his towards the school. He thought back to what Jarvis had said to him before he left and sighed.
She rolled her eyes and leaned back against the wall of the cubicle, taking a long sip from her water bottle, while also registering the sound of water running.. “Which is it, Sharon? Am I a slut, or a shit? Make up your mind.” She made it a point to keep her voice low and calm, but still loud enough to be heard.
“Aw, come on Foster, can’t you just come out with me tonight? It’s summer, we could celebrate that school’s finally out, together.” Jane rolled her eyes at before smacking his arm when he tried to put it around her, glaring daggers at him. Thor would not like to be on the receiving end of that particular look.
Tony was running before he even fully realized he was moving at all. He bumped into some guy, the half-full, lukewarm take-away cup of coffee flying out of his hand and onto the floor and he almost slipped in the puddle of coffee as he ran faster. He heard somewhere behind him someone yelling at him for making a mess, but he couldn’t care less, because Steve was
And it was probably because his eyes were closed and his mind was elsewhere that it all came as such a surprise when he suddenly felt someone bump into him, pretty roughly too. It took him so by surprise that he ended up tripping over his own feet, stumbled over a long, taut rope that was keeping a boat tied to the dock and he fell into the water with a small yelp.
And the most amazing about her: she took no shit from anyone. Whether it be professors or classmates or- and especially- men trying to silence her or demean her, she always knew how to handle them and make them feel humiliated or demeaned instead. Steve would always remember that day when he saw Justin Hammer trying to tell her how
Steve smirked and shrugged lightly. “I’m here, aren’t I? I’d say it worked out just great for me. Especially since I have you now.” He placed his arm around Tony’s shoulders and hugged him close, letting Tony rest his head in the crook of his neck.
Steve leapt out of his skin and turned around, wide eyes and jaw hanging open. Toni was standing right behind him, her hair in a messy bun, loose jeans and a white t-shirt a few sizes too big. She wasn’t dolled up or anything, she didn’t even have make-up, in fact she had some engine grease on her face and she was still so beautiful. She had probably been working on some project or some invention and had taken a break to talk with him and get a coffee. But she looked a little upset and he desperately wanted to wipe that frown of her face.
Then, before anyone could say anything else, a bright blue light shone from somewhere out in the woods and a low, electric sound and another hissing sound was heard as smoke poured out from the woods.
Also, it didn’t help that the girls kept throwing Russian stereotypes at her, despite not having lived in Russia since she was five years old.
Steve shook his head and poured himself a coffee. “I can’t Sam. I really like her and I don’t want my first real friend who is a girl to not like me. And really, I’m fine with her just being my friend. I can live with that. Besides, she’s way out of my league anyway.”
“Well, what are we supposed to do then? We still have no service, no food and no way of calling for help. Do you think the camp people will call the cops if we don’t show up?” Bruce shrugged and rubbed his hands together and blew hot air on them in an attempt to warm them up.
Steve smirked from where he was standing, arms folded and leaning against the car. “Your daddy’s tech not good enough anymore?” Tony glared at him and tried again a few times before giving up and turning back to the engine.
Steve suddenly felt a little unsure what to do next and moved to wipe the counter, despite it already being clean, aside from Bucky having spilled a few drops of coffee when he laughed before. But it was better than just standing awkwardly and stare at her like an idiot. But he could feel her eyes on him and he almost made a bit of a show of himself as he stretched and wiped the counter top in certain places instead of walking across the space.
Clint groaned and threw down the last t-shirt and a pair of jeans into his bag and zipped it before moving on the next one, dumping a stack of comic books, his headphones and his beloved teddy Golden Retriever Lucky into it. Natasha had never once seen him sleep without Lucky since they were both adopted by Phil and he was not ashamed to admit that he loved that dog and needed it for comfort at nights. Not that Natasha was one to judge, since she still had nightmares about her past some nights and would find comfort in sleeping with her old ballerina shoes or with her jackknife close by.
Steve’s eyebrows drew together, suddenly feeling that old, familiar urge to punch something- or in this case
The Adonis smiled and then slowly got up on his feet, reaching out his hand for Tony to take and Tony gladly took it and let the Adonis help him stand up. Then he went back to looking kinda sheepish and a little guilty.
But right now Tony wasn’t smiling, not even a little. His expression was a little hard to read, Steve couldn’t quite pin down what Tony was feeling at the moment, aside from a hint of fear and shame, which made Steve worry about what had happened tonight. Steve and Tony had planned for the both of them to be there, but due to Fury dropping a mission on him and Natasha a few days prior; Steve had found himself busy with writing a mission report he needed to have finished by tomorrow. And Steve had been more than happy to avoid another night at a PR event, and once he finished had found himself on the couch, relaxing and watching TV until Tony came home. But now he was worrying about what had happened that made Tony look like that.
Toni sighed and blinked hard to keep back the tears. “… and what if he doesn’t like me? What if he is everything I think he is and I fall for him but he decides that I’m not good enough for him?” Tears started to form and she bit the inside of her cheek to try and fight them back.
Steve looked mock-outraged at him and turned his nose in the air. “Well, if you’re gonna be like that I don’t think I wanna cook for you in the future, you’ve hurt my feelings Stark.” Tony smacked him on the arm again and moved towards his chair.
Tony shook his head and smiled fondly after his boyfriend and rolled his eyes at his ridiculousness. He chuckled a little and turned in the direction of the door, saying very softly, “I love you too.”
“Oh yeah, I thought you looked a bit familiar dude. Are you also here against your will?” Bruce shrugged and tried to smile.
“Are you alright?” The voice sounded very worried- and very American- but Tony was still coughing up water, but when he finally felt like he could breathe and his eyes didn’t sting so much anymore, he blinked a few times and looked up at his savior and-
“Does this man bother you, Jane? Shall I take care off him and vanquish him to another room?” Before Jane could respond, Pierce groaned and rolled his eyes at him.
Tony refused to look him in the eyes, he kept his head down and stared at his shoes, or the carpet, or the TV remote, or anything that wasn’t Steve. So Steve got up, walked up to Tony, took his hand and gently brought him over to the couch and they sat down, Steve still holding on tightly to Tony’s hand.
Bruce sighed as he zipped his bag closed. All packed and done. Now all he had to do was wait for the cab to come.
“Steve, seriously-“ Sam was looking somewhere over Steve’s shoulder, but Steve didn’t even notice, he was too into it.
Sometimes Steve still found himself amazed by how quick Natasha had, not only changed her view of Tony from her original report on him for SHIELD, but had come to care about Tony like an annoying but lovable little brother. She cared about him a lot and wouldn’t hesitate to physically knock him out and carry him to bed, tie him to it and force feed him when he woke up, just to make sure he wouldn’t kill himself from lack of sleep and nutrition.
It had been a very big surprise when his father had told him, the second he had come home from school yesterday, that he would be sent to a summer camp instead of staying in the city, mostly because of how much money these things usually cost and they were not made of money. Especially after his mom had died and his father had been forced to pay for everything on his own. Bruce had tried to find part-time jobs to help pay the bills and save as much as he could for emergencies, but it was still not much.
Tony sighed in contentment as he sat down on the couch with a cup of coffee and placed his laptop on his lap. Finally a day off and he had taken care of everything he needed to do. The laundry was taken care of, he had cleaned the apartment, and now all that was left was paying the bills for the month before he could kick back and relax.
Okay, what? Why was Steve so upset about her dating life or who she might end up? And why the fuck did he think she should be with stiff boring lawyers or busy doctors or stingy businessmen? Sounded like a bitch.
And finally there was a small smile forming on Tony’s face and he rested his head on Steve’s shoulder, pressing a kiss to the crook of his neck. “I love you.”
Blonsky smirked down at Bruce, towering over him by at least four inches. “Hello Banner. Still wearing that hoodie as the rest of the month?” Ross smirked and elbowed him with a snort.
“Oh yeah, I go to MIT. It’s my freshman year, engineering program.” Steve smiled back, bringing over the latte and croissant.
After a minute or so he could hear Tony enter the room again, as well as a very soft ‘shh’ from door before walking towards the couch. Steve smiled a little wider and turned his head towards Tony. “Can I open my eyes now, Tony?”
Now, he had made some acquaintances with a few other young students, such as Bruce Banner, and had even managed to obtain a lovely girlfriend in Jane Foster and made friends with her friends. But the negative attitude that was simmering in this city was almost enough to choke him at times. And while Loki had been fortunate enough to find a click that more or less suited him- a strange little group of mixed individuals- Thor had a bit more of a tough time finding a good place among his peers, before finally joined the football team. But he still could not help but feel that- as nice as some of the people were at this school- they were laughing at him behind his back or made jokes at his expense.
Bruce swallowed loudly and walked closer to the window, placing his hand on the glass and his eyes locked on the green and blue planet on the outside. He stared at it for what felt like an eternity before turning back to the others with big, wide eyes and his face suddenly very pale.
Janet hugged her tightly and stroke her hair gently. “Aw, Toni… of course he will. You’re the best friend anyone could ask for, you’re smart, brave, loyal, generous and funny and any guy in the world would be fucking lucky to have you. And if Steve doesn’t see that then I say fuck him, that’s his loss. But you deserve the best guy Toni. You deserve to find the best guy ever who’ll treat you right and like the queen you are.”
"But I… really, really like you Toni. I think I've liked you since that first day we met. And I'd really like to be more than your friend, to take you out on a date, and treat you right and make you feel special like you deserve and-" His voice broke and just stood there, staring at her with wet eyes, still trying to blink them away.
“H-he wanted to c-catch up somewhere, for o-old times sake. I-I said that I wasn’t in-interested, that my h-husband was e-expecting me home soon, and I t-tried to w-walk away. B-but then h-he grabbed me and k-kissed me.”
“Oi! Hands off the merchandise, you cretin! You’re messing it up!” But he kept smiling very widely and that mischievous spark in his eyes was still apparent so Steve wasn’t too concerned about Tony being too mad about his hair or the roughhousing. So he just smirked back and ruffled Tony’s hair more thoroughly for good measure, ignoring Tony’s outraged squawk.
Tony blushed a little as he got the many extravagant gifts listed up for him, but waved it off and smirked his usual confidant smirk. “Well, obviously I’ve got a big gift for you! What kind of husband would I be if I didn’t? Becoming a centenarian is a big deal. But this one I know you will love, I guarantee it.”
Wait, what? Go to a camp? With a bunch of kids that had to be several years younger than him and also spend his whole summer in nature and miles away from any Wi-Fi or air conditioning? No way, no way in hell was he doing that!
“Seriously, what is this? Some kind of elaborate prank?” Clint shook his head and rolled his eyes, only to shushed again and he raised his hands defensively and took a big step to the left to avoid Natasha hitting him. Everyone else had their eyes glued to the screen, even Tony was listening very closely now.
“Yeah, you probably like that, cuz you know no one will ever love you. Just like your parents didn’t love you or your brother. Your dad probably loved you about as much loved the smell his own shit and would’ve loved to kill you too if you didn’t run away.”
Steve sighed heavily and shifted over so they were now sitting less than an inch away from each other. “Are you okay? Do you need anything? Water? Space? Fresh air?” Tony shook his head, moved his legs back up on the couch and leaned most of his weight against Steve’s shoulder.
going to do that, no way in hell! I love him and I am not going to dump the love of my life just because you disapprove,
“Hey, what’s wrong? Aren’t you happy? I thought you really liked the guy.” Toni sighed and looked down at the pillow she was still hugging.
Toni coughed and tried to laugh it off, despite Janet’s tight hug making it a bit difficult to breathe, and gently pulled away from the embrace. “Thanks Jan, you’re sweet. But technically
"What if I would like that? What if I like that 'scrappy kid from Brooklyn?' What if I want to be more than friends?" She gently released his wrist and grabbed his hand with both of hers, as tightly and reassuring as she could. "What if I would like to give him a chance to sweep me off my feet?"
"Well, I want to take a warm shower. I want to wash all of the grime and blood and dirt from this mission off me." He lowered his voice seductively. "You want to help me with that?" Tony smirked and wrapped his arms around his neck.
When they met back in kindergarten Tony had been very quiet, pensive and barely talked or made any moves without being asked to and barely even then. Heck, he hardly ever smiled or laughed in a way that didn’t feel forced or held back. Steve had been the one to ask or decide what games they should play for the most part and Tony just sort of went along with it. But with time and as Tony became more comfortable around him and the other kids, he’d slowly but surely started to come out of his shell and became happier, more confidant and started to make more jokes and decisions for himself. And as they made their way through school together Steve felt as though he was allowed to see Tony grow stronger, braver and eventually discover himself and realize what he wanted and who he wanted to be despite how his father wanted him to take over Stark Industries and be exactly like him.
Yes, he realized that this whole thing was not only dangerous and risky as hell, but he was also worried about how little they knew about this mission. No facts or anything, just a simple
Steve scowled lightly at him, took a deep breath and closed his eyes before walking up to the podium. “Well, I can’t say that going on an adventure like this this isn’t enticing or anything, but I still think the risk is too big considering the unknown variables. So, I say no.” And he pressed the red button, which lit up and made a loud buzzing noise. He stepped back and Clint took his place, also he with a grin on his face.
“Hey. I’m Bucky, and this lug’s best friend.” Bucky? What kind of a name was that? But Tony didn’t really want to ask and just nodded with a weak smile. Bucky was standing on his knees but was now standing up. “You okay now?”
Steve laughed softly, shaking his head fondly as the dialed up their favorite Chinese restaurant and ordered all while Tony was still rambling on about the movie and instead of pulling up Netflix he was flicking through different channels. And even though Tony was still talking a mile a minute and barely stopped to breathe, not even looking at Steve anymore, Steve felt his heart swell and warmth spread through his body as he looked at him.
“I told you, Pierce, I’m not interested. One, I have a boyfriend, so no. Two, even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t go out with you if you were the last guy on planet Earth. So kindly get lost before I tell Darcy to whip out her taser. Again.”
“No idea, but the guy has been throwing dirty glances at us for the whole day. Maybe he’s just mad his BFFL isn’t here and is taking it out on us.” Tony rolled his eyes and shook his head slightly.
“Aw man, no. Come on Cap, keep your foreplay in the bedroom, okay?” Tony’s head jerked up and he glared at the archer. But before he could say anything, Steve started walking again, turning a corner and their friends were suddenly of sight.
Thor had never been to America before moving here from Norway with his father, mother and brother, due to his father needing to work in America for a few years. And so far he couldn’t say he was too impressed by its residents.
“Great. Glad to have that over and done with.” He then picked up the list and looked it over with a small grimace. “So, I got all the groceries. Except for this last one on the list. Is that an actual word, or did you just scribble something random with your elbow? I mean, what is
Toni wasn't sure Janet actually heard the last part of it, because she was too busy squealing very loudly- and very
"-kidding me right now? Do you know who she is? Antonia Elizabeth Stark, daughter of Howard Stark? Billionaire, genius and CEO of one of the most successful tech conglomerates in the world? And she is clearly gonna take over that one day and revolutionize the world one day with her own genius." Steve was clearly worked up about something and it concerned and worried her for a moment that this was it, the moment where she would see Steve's true colors and how he really was shallow asshole under the adorable puppy act he'd been playing for weeks now, or that he found her annoying or a bitch but then he gestured at himself, almost dejectedly.
Really, all of them had come to care quite a bit about the genius, as annoying and frustrating as he could be Tony had proven to be very easy to like, once you got past the mile high concrete walls and defenses the genius had built around himself and his heart. And once you got used to his more annoying quirks, like his rambling, his habit of getting too far into people’s personal space, or his habit of working too hard, too long and being too stubborn to accept that he might need a break every once in a while. Like to eat and sleep.
Of course Pierce had run off to tell the principal that he had threatened to injure him today, which he had called to tell his father about. And Odin of course had been furious at how Thor had threatened with violence and had yelled at him for so long about how it made the family look and how he needed to think before acting and control his anger and, bla bla bla. Thor had heard that talk many a time before.
Steve smirked without looking up from the napkin he had started to sketch on to help pass the time before more costumers would come in and hopefully time would go a little faster. “Hey, Buck. Feeling lively today, are we?”
Tony had always been told he needed to work on his patience, but considering he'd had been waiting for 10 months for this day to come, dragging it out like this felt really unnecessary, not to mention unbearable. And maybe it was the caffeine or his own inability to stay still for more than a few seconds at a time or a combination of the two, but he was practically vibrating in place and had to fight against himself so he wouldn’t start jumping around or run back and forth between here and the gate or something else that would make him like stupid.
“Well, I can’t find any clues on this thing that can tells us what this is supposed to be. But yeah, it does look like a sitting area, but it’s the weirdest dinner table I have ever seen. And my mom has had some pretty crazy ideas of how to furnish a room.”
He started to go over the pros and cons of each choice in his head again, when he heard Clint mutter under his breath, either talking to Tony and Thor or just talking to himself.
birthday. Which of course would be a big deal no matter what he said or did, because becoming 100 years old and not be a frail, weak and wrinkly old man was quite a feat. And so he resigned himself to his fate that Tony would go out of his way to get him some kind of extravagant gift and maybe even discard the rule entirely in order to spoil him.
Tony smirked at him from his seat, his cheek resting on his fist and with his elbow on the table. "Looks like we're really hungry, are we?" Steve smirked back and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then wiped it on his uniform.
Steve’s smile widened and a few more tears fell down his cheek and Tony raised his hands to his face, gently wiping them away. “And two, how long have we been friends? Fifteen years? You have always been the best friend I could ever ask for, even before you asked me on a date, or said that you loved me. You’ve looked after me when I was in trouble; let me cry on your shoulder after fights with my dad or when another boyfriend or girlfriend turned out to be a bust. And you’ve always been there for me to rein me in when I get lost in work or school or when I’m just being stupid, when I’m being an asshole or when I just need to get my head out of my ass. You have always been there for me, even before I was a genius and dad tried to exploit it.”
“My, my Rogers, are you looking at girls and drawing them without consent? I can’t imagine they’d like it. And who’s this?” He flipped the page, a picture of a girl at a table in the library, who was drawn in more detail and with her long hair flowing around her in a bright red. “Is that Romanov? Why Steven, do we have a thing for Russians?”
“I never cheat, Tony!” He yelled after him, still with his eyes closed. He heard Clint snort from somewhere behind him.
Tony’s mouth was open, eyes wide and started to fill with tears again, but he started to blink, hoping to kill them before they could fall and he chuckled. “Fuck you, Rogers. You’ve made me cry like five times in less than thirty minutes today, you fucking asshole. I should give you the ring right back for making me this emotional today, you know I hate feelings.”
To his small delight there were a few laughs around him and Rumlow turned bright red, though he wasn’t sure if it was because of humiliation or anger. Maybe both? Then he grinned again and put his hands on his hips.
“What button did you push, anyway?” Bruce paled a little as he realized he hadn’t actually looked at which button he had pressed and didn’t know what he had voted for, but before he could answer The Watcher appeared on the screen again.
“Hi.” Silence. Bruce wracked his brain for something to say so Tony wouldn’t think he was an idiot. He came up blank, but then Tony smiled a bit more genuinely at him.
“No, Steve. I will not have the media go crazy over Captain America punching a civilian and putting him in the hospital. Pepper would kill us both and you know it.”
In other words, she was a Queen in the making and he was nothing but a nobody from the working class.
“That’s probably the most polite way I’ve ever heard that phrase being said before, Thor. I think you and I are gonna get along great if we end up actually going on this mission.” Tony managed to say between his laughter and Clint nodded on the verge of choking on his laughter. Thor looked very pleased with the reaction he’d gotten from his little joke, but then looked away from them and smiled at Bruce as he came up to them.
“Um, yeah, to class.” Blonsky smirked and shook his head before reaching out his hand towards Bruce, as if he was expecting him to give him something.
Our Heroes all find out they're going to summer camp for the whole summer and surprised to find that they're all going with a bunch of people from their class that they've barely talked to before. And suddenly, their taxi breaks down miles away from the city and they're left all alone with no means to get help or go back home.
Steve Rogers had caught her eye the moment she had walked into that damn Starbucks and saw him behind the counter. And damn, he had to be some kind of model or maybe an experiment under the government or something. It had to be illegal to be that hot. He was tall, big muscles
A/N: Okay, that was the end of the chapter 3. Hopefully I’ll get chapter 4 done very soon too! And, I know I’ve already said it, but this story in mostly based on a Swedish TV Show (and a little in inspired by TMNT 2012) so a lot of things in here are from that show. So, just so we’re clear on something, pictures on how the machines look can be found on this link:
Clint was Clint. He, just like Tony, had moments of being inappropriate and rude and kind of an ass. He liked to pull pranks on his teammates and sometimes didn’t think before he spoke, but he was a very good friend. While he had taken more a shine to Tony and Thor, and he and Natasha clearly had a strong relationship even before they joined the Avengers, he and Steve got a long pretty well. And he had certain brutal honesty that Steve appreciated from time to time; given how some people still seemed to walk on eggshells around him when trying to explain things to him. Clint had treated him like he treated everyone around him, right from the start. Steve very much appreciated this.
He had been working at the time. It was Wednesday, which meant he had no classes, which in turn meant he had a shift at the Starbucks close by MIT, so off to work he went. And it had been a very calm day. Sure, there was always the morning rush, where students or early workers came running in to get their coffee and maybe some breakfast before rushing off to classes or work, but after that it been a very slow day. Which, hey, it was always nice every once in a while to have a little peace and quiet, but he usually liked for
He then went back over to the couch to put his laptop and coffee mug away and also fluffing up the pillows for a nice dinner and movie night.
Toni nuzzled her face into Janet's neck and let out a low, shaky breath. "Thanks Jan. But I don't know if I'm ready for that yet. Or ever."
Bruce tightened his grip around himself. “I’m just saying we shouldn’t rush into things. We have an hour to think about this, maybe we should really think this through before we decide what we want to do?”
Tony closed his eyes and held back a tired and frustrated groan. Not even five seconds into school and he
Her lip quirked slightly and she pulled up her legs on the bed so she could sit cross-legged. "Because Phil wants us to become more social and hang out with more people than just each other. We've been over this already."
Tony took another breath, but he broke their eye contact, looking down his shoes again. Steve didn’t say anything about it, just squeezed Tony’s hand reassuringly. “H-he… he showed up at the event. I-I didn’t know he was gonna be there. And from what Pepper told me, it didn’t sound like he was invited. He might’ve been a plus one for someone, or he snuck in somehow, I don’t know…”
Tony chuckled softy, stood on his toes to kiss Steve’s nose and then buried his fingers in Steve’s beard. “Okay, some real talk here, babe, what the hell is this? Do they not let you shave in Syria? Or are we trying to be the next Robinson Crusoe?”
“Yeah. Laundry’s just done, folded and put back in the closet. The apartment’s clean and I’m just about done with everything.” Steve’s smile widened and he came over to the couch to place a soft kiss to his temple.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Ooh, a surprise? Aw babe, you didn’t have to.” Steve just smiled, gently let go of him, but he kept an arm around Tony’s waist, and started to lead him into the kitchen.
Never let it be said that Tony Stark was a lazy person. Sure, he sometimes liked to laze around on his days off and spend as long as he could in bed with Steve and just watch TV on the couch with a pizza for lunch. He was also way more of a morning person than people usually took him for, despite all the jokes that his teammates might make at the breakfast table when Tony dragged himself into the kitchen, still half asleep and clutching his coffee mug like it was the Holy Grail. Which, if you asked Tony, it might as well be, considering he was way more protective of his coffee than he was of his own health. Something that really concerned Steve and he usually gave Tony part of his own breakfast, just to make sure Tony ate enough. And who was Tony to say no to his boyfriend’s pathetically big, sad puppy-dog eyes? You’d have better luck telling a group of starving orphans that lunch was cancelled for the day.
Steve had no idea if any of those rumors were true, but both Natasha and Clint were very good at gymnastics, and he was scary good at archery and she was an expert at martial arts. So the idea that Clint might have had a past with some kind of circus, and Natasha might have been trained since very young to do these things, since she had this dangerous air about her, which made most people stay away from her while still gawking at her beauty. But Steve had never been one to listen too much to rumors so he didn’t really believe it. Well, not much anyway.
“Oh, what’s the matter Cunt? Did you scrape your knee? Do you need mommy to kiss it an make it better?” He spoke in a patronizing, baby voice and did a little pout, just because he could. Clint gritted his teeth and tried to take deep breath so he wouldn’t do something stupid. School was over, he was free from this guy for the next ten weeks. Why did he waste time on this guy and stay around here like a moron.
“Dad, I’m done now.” He looked up from the paper and looked at Bruce with tired, drunk eyes. Bruce rolled his eyes and bit his lip so he wouldn’t say anything, he just sighed.
"So I take it you're done?" Steve nodded and Tony took the plate, utensils and glass and put it all in the dishwasher before turning back to Steve. "So, what do you wanna do now? Take a shower? A bath? Maybe go directly to bed?" Steve smiled and walked to Tony, wrapping his arms around his waist and pulling him close.
“Yeah, he looked like was just getting ready to back off and run.” She took his arm and started to lead him towards the exit. “Now come on, Phil had something he wanted to talk about when we got back home.” Clint nodded and finally sighed in relief as they left the school.
His mom knocked on the door and entered with a sad smile. "Hi honey. I just got a call from Bucky's mother-" Steve nodded and cut her off.
over and over again. Bruce looked from the screens, to the levers and buttons and then out the window at the big asteroid. He sat down in one of the chairs in front of one of the screens and started tapping. The others came running up and Natasha clutched the back of Bruce’s seat tightly.
“You didn’t. If you had cheated on me, you wouldn’t have tried to avoid it all from happening and you wouldn’t feel this bad about it. You don’t have to worry about any of that, I know how loyal and faithful you are Tony; I would never assume you would cheat on me. You love me and I love you, till the end of time, remember?”
It always surprised a lot of people that he had a very fiery temper and could loose it when he was pushed to far, and he’d been working hard at controlling said temper so he wouldn’t completely loose it someone. Not that he could actually take any of these guys in a fight, but he was stronger than he looked, despite being a bit short and not particularly muscle-y.
“Indeed, Captain. You have been known to bend the rules when we engage in Midgardian games. Perhaps we should change the purpose of the games to see who can cheat the best.” Thor said somewhere to his left, sounding pretty amused.
said you wanted to give him a chance to surprise you and sweep you off your feet! He wouldn’t have asked you if you hadn’t caught him talking about you and told him that you liked him!” Her eyes and face softened and she placed an arm around her shoulders. “That is a big thing for you. I don’t think you’ve ever been that honest with a guy that you liked before. It’s amazing that you’re moving forward and becoming braver. I’m really, really happy for you.”
She rolled her eyes, clearly annoyed but pushed the bottle towards them. “Relax, it’s just water. I always bring water with me just in case. And you look like you need something to drink right now.” Bruce immediately felt a bit embarrassed for his reaction, but there were a lot of rumors floating around about Natasha and that bottle she always carried around.
“Thanks babe. You’re the best.” He then walked over to the counter and started to unpack the groceries. “By the way, can you pay the bills today? I don’t get paid until tomorrow.” Tony smirked and picked up his laptop again.
“Oh really, do tell Mr. Whiz Kid, how do you figure that?” Tony grimaced at the engine seemed to jerk something loose.
"And yet you felt the need to decide for me who is good enough for me? Like that choice isn't up to me? Bruce Banner is a genius and going to change the world some day. Reed Richards is a genius and will be rich and famous one day. Justin Hammer is from a rich and somewhat powerful family. Do you see me hanging around them and trying to get dates out of them?"
“If you have nothing of value to say Loki, I suggest you leave me to my packing.” Loki smirked and plumped down on the bed, picking up one of Thor’s stuffed animals and played a little with it.
“If you think that’s good toots, you should see his paintings. Or, you know, when he’s actually trying. He’s much, much better when he’s actually putting effort into it.” Steve glared at him but the girl just smirked at him.
“Because you want a good future and for that to happen you need to go to college and get an education? And maybe you wouldn’t have to study so hard if you didn’t spend so much time checking out girls in class.” Bucky glared at him and sipped on more coffee.
Still, Steve took his responsibility to take care of Tony very seriously, and after almost 24 hours of working non-stop it was high time for him to get some sleep. So Steve headed down the stairs towards the workshop, punched in his access code with ease and walked in.
"That's only because you don't try, Steve. You don't reach out and try to make friends, you just sit there with your sketchbooks when you don't play football, which is strange considering how nice and friendly you are."
Tony narrowed his eyes and put his laptop aside before coming over to Steve, looking over his shoulder at the list and then chuckled a little. “Babe, it says
Tony was close to tears and caught between a rock and a hard place. He needed to get away, soon, or who knows what he would do. Normally he would yell back and tell Ty exactly where to shove it, but he’d been caught off guard and now didn’t know how he would get away from this, since he was cornered by three guys, two of which were taller and bigger than him, so-
” Tony rolled his eyes and made a talking duck head with his hand, and Steve had to give it to him, he was very good at keeping his emotions out of his voice. If he hadn’t known the guy for so many years he probably wouldn’t have see through the façade he was trying to put up.
Tony was nodding with happy tears running down his face, saying “Yes, yes, yes!” over and over again before running up to Steve and throwing himself around his neck again. Steve wrapped his arms tightly around Tony before lifting him off his feet again and spinning him around. He heard cheers and applause around them, but paid them no heed; the only thing going through his head at the moment was
Still, he didn’t let himself get deterred and just glared at his brother. “If you have nothing more you wish to tell me, then I suggest you leave me alone and let me pack in peace.” Loki just smirked at him and jumped off the bed, making his way to the door. But before he left the room, he turned to look at Thor.
“Why the fuck do you even care? You haven’t called me or tried to make any contact since I left for college! You know, when you disowned me! And even if you hadn’t, last I checked, I am an adult! So my life is none of your fucking business and you don’t get a say in anything I do anymore! So
much difference. You’re still far away from him, whether on camp or in space. It’s not too much difference there.” Natasha smacked him and he yelped in pain, rubbing his arm where a small red mark was starting to form from her hand. “What? It’s true!”
Bruce looked around at the other kids in the car. Natasha had earbuds and seemed to listen to music from her phone, slightly moving her head in time to the music. Clint was playing on some kind of game console and the blonde guy next to him was looking out the window, admiring the scenery. The blonde next to him had taken out a sketchbook and had started to draw something, and Tony was playing around on his phone. Bruce was starting to regret throwing his bag into the trunk and that he hadn’t taken out his phone and headphones, but before he could do or say anything, Clint looked up from his game and looked between them all before putting his game down.
“Nah, he’ll have to learn to share, just like everyone else. I’m not sharing him with anyone else and he knows it.” Tony smiled fondly at him, a small blush covering his cheeks. Steve just smirked. “And I’m sure Tony can learn to share too. He’s such a good boy.” Tony fond smile turned into a mock scowl and he smacked Steve on the shoulder, which just made Steve laugh.
But he hardly got to finish that thought before he was stopped just as he entered the building. And surprise, surprise it was Tiberius Stone, followed by Aldrich Killian and Justin Hammer, his little posse of wannabes and assholes.
“Hm, very nice Steven. But do people know that you draw them without knowing about it?” Steve flew forward to grab it, but Rumlow grabbed him in a tight grip and held him back from grabbing Schmidt.
