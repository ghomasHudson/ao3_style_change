Tony hummed thoughtfully. “Was all of this for me?” He smoothed down Steve’s shirt with his free hand.
He didn’t know which of them was more surprised, but if push came to shove, he’d bet on himself.
For @t0nystark1er’s prompt, which I have lost cause Tumblr deletes messages you respond to but it was along the lines of Ma Kent meeting the Wayne family. I hope you like it!
It means, though, that he’s unprepared for the huff of breath against his mouth, the slide of Tony’s tongue; is completely vulnerable to the taste of Tony, less like something new and more like something lost and longed for ever since.
Tony could admit that there was a tiny, spiteful part of him that wanted to climb in the suit, blast Steve with a few dozen rockets and yell, “Ha! How do you like me now?”
Drugs?  Too many side-effects.  He didn’t want to live a shorter life, or to spend all his time looking for the next hit or recovering from the last one.
had come out, and Steve
He brought his hands down to his sides, pushing off the mattress and gritting his teeth at the accompanying surge of pain that it caused. He’d been expecting it, since the painkillers would’ve worn off hours ago, but it was the pull of tape against his skin that made him freeze.
That was before he’d come to understand that to Steve, “massage” actually meant “maim.”
Dr. Stark’s fingers are still inside of him, but they’re not moving. He’s undoubtedly staring in shock at the mess Steve’s made of himself. In all likelihood, Dr. Stark has never had an omega on his table like Steve. Most of Steve wants to curl up into a ball and hide in the blankets Dr. Stark gave him, even as a tiny part of him twinges with something like pride that Dr. Stark is looking at him, that Steve has proved just how much he wants him, even if he can’t do anything about it.
demanded one as soon as he’d signed the contract, especially considering how prickly he’d been the first day. Tony mentally went over the terms, and yeah, it’d been part of their contract, so he was surprised Steve hadn’t wanted to use his safeword in any and all circumstances he thought he could get away with it—
“See?” Tony said, using moderate pressure. “Doesn’t that feel good?”
He’s sure Tony’s probably wondered about him in the past, the omega on Tony’s table who can barely keep his legs closed when he’s around. Maybe Tony had been willing to overlook it before, but he knows Tony has to be realizing just how much better he can do.
Word count: 794
“Yes,” he says, or he tries to say anyway, but it comes out so hoarsely that he has to clear his throat and say it again.
He gets a fierce sense of satisfaction when Steve’s legs start to tremble, but there’s still a long way to go. Steve can take so much.
“Yes, Sir?”
to Steve’s chest. The other half—well, the other half, okay, Tony
At least with cat-Tony, Steve doesn’t have to worry about not touching him, and he doesn’t know who enjoys their petting sessions more.  It’s just really relaxing stroking Tony.  He’s soft and affectionate, and Steve kind of wants to keep him, although obviously, he wants regular Tony back more.
“Fantastic,” Tony said, drawing out each syllable.
He’d thought he’d known what Steve wanted. He’d thought that he would give Steve a safe harbor, somewhere he could catch up on the life that had passed him by while he regained a degree of control that SHIELD would never have allowed him.  But was that enough?
“Okay, late now. Catch you later.”
It’d left Steve anxious but eager, and he was glad they were finally going to get started. A part of him wanted to skip exploring the house and get down to business right away, but he never felt quite like he could relax in a new place until he’d seen it for himself, even knowing that JARVIS was watching over them. He owed it to Tony to make sure all of his attention was on him during the actual punishment and not on his surroundings, so Steve walked into every room, taking note of the layout of the house and the location of all the windows and doors.
“The bathroom’s right through there. Feel free to use it before we get started.”
-----
“Sure,” Tony said, moving away from the window where he’d been staring outside toward the sitting area, awkwardly gesturing for Steve to sit down in one of the armchairs.
For one horrified second, he’s tempted to jump on the table right then and there and slam his ass down on the paper and cover every part of himself he can reach with the sheet Dr. Stark had given him.
“Or ‘please, I don’t care where you bite me, as long as you keep doing it?’” he said, regretfully moving his hands away from Steve’s chest—although he’d hardly call it a disappointment to rest them on Steve’s hips. He inched down the bed so he could get a mouthful of Steve’s side, just above the rise of his buttocks. He didn’t have to be quite so careful there, and Steve’s breath hissed out as Tony bit him, his ass tensing appealingly under Tony’s palms.
“You’re right, wrong tactic.  Please,” he said, brown eyes large and soulful, and jeez, why couldn’t he say no to him?  “It would mean a lot to me.”
He’d gone a little soft while he’d been having his freak out, but Steve apparently hadn’t noticed, which Tony could only be thankful for. It wasn’t as if he could explain that he’d realized he was even more in love with Steve than he’d been even a month ago, and the thought had devastated him.
done.
“Mr. Stark, I’ve been ordered by Director Fury to bring you in for a meeting,” the guy said, calm and apparently unflappable.  He obviously didn’t know Tony that well.  “The restraints are to ensure your cooperation and will be taken off when we reach Director Fury’s office.”
“Nothing?”
“I’m sorry, I …” He trailed off, rubbing his hand over his face—dropping it when he realized how unsteady it was. “What did you say?”
on the tenth anniversary of Thanos’ defeat. Something was happening, and Steve couldn’t let himself be blinded. It was just a distraction, a ploy of some kind, and he had to keep a clear head and not let the thing’s face confuse him. He wasn’t going to be swayed by the tests, no matter what the results said, and he knew that Peter wouldn’t either, that if nothing else, the two of them would stay strong.
“Three days, huh?” he said, and rationally he knew that a move from D. C. to New York wasn’t actually a very big one; and that if Fury had a problem with Tony and Steve being together, he would never have bullied them into a contract in the first person; and that Steve had been the one to come to him, looking to start again.
, he thought.
Before taking the serum, Steve had never really fantasized about being overpowered. He hadn’t hated the thought of someone being able to manhandle him, but it hadn’t been something he looked for either. His dreams had centered around a Dom who’d treat him with a firm but just hand, one that wouldn’t be upset because he had his own opinions or who felt like he needed to fade into the background. He’d wanted someone who wouldn’t be afraid to push his boundaries but also wouldn’t be disappointed when they hit them either, who wouldn’t haven’t felt like Steve was a failure just because his body couldn’t do everything he wanted it to do.
Between the two of them, there was no doubt that Steve was stronger. Their sparring every day only reinforced the knowledge, as if either of them would forget. He hadn’t thought, however, about how helpless he’d be when he was in the air, how it would feel for Stark to hold him, trapped and safe.
He waited for Tony to tell him what to do next, but Tony didn’t look up, even though he had to know Steve was there. Steve wondered if that meant Tony wanted him to leave him alone, or to continue to stand there, or if Steve had missed a cue to do something else, but he didn’t ask for clarification. He’d given up that privilege.
Not even telling the person he was in love with that he had feelings for him.
He just wishes that it didn’t mean he was being so overstimulated that he’s barely keeping himself from yelling.
He yanks Tony down and kisses him like he’s been dying to do since the first day they met.
is more than enough. But he can’t seem to force the words out out.
He kept his eyes open the whole time, gritting his teeth when orgasm finally hit, and he watched the evidence of his loneliness flush away.
“Honor,” Steve said, and fuck, it hit him just as hard as it had the first time Steve had told him.
“Of course I don’t,” Tony says as he leads Steve forward, wrapping his oh-so-firm arm around Steve’s waist. “But I want to,” he says, squeezing Steve’s side, the tips of his fingers slipping under the towel, practically burning into this skin, and fuck, who’s Steve to argue?
“You didn’t.”
Tony, then he’d be taken away from him.
“Not too much. I decided to be productive and swing by Malibu while you’re out of town. I regret it deeply, however, because right after lunch, I’ll be subjected to a Slow and Painful Death by Boring Business Metrics Meeting,” Tony said, and Steve smiled a little.
“Steve,” Tony breathes, pulling away slightly, and no. No.
that people seemed to learn all the wrong lessons from war.
Not much.
“I love you, Tony,” Steve rasped, his voice cracking, and he might have said more, but it was lost in the roar that filled Tony’s ears.
about asking.
Steve hadn’t known just how hungry he was until he started eating. Everything tasted amazing, and Tony seemed intent on feeding him, nudging plates closer to him and smiling every time Steve took another serving of something. It was tempting to eat everything in sight, especially with Tony keeping up a steady stream of chatter between his own bites, stories that didn’t require more than the occasional acknowledgment on Steve’s part. He knew, however, that if he ate too much, he wouldn’t be in the mood for sex, and there was no way he was going to let that happen. So he controlled himself, eating enough for two men instead of three, and by the time he put down his fork, he didn’t feel too full.
want to,” Tony said, sharply enough that Steve flinched slightly, looking away, and he decided to continue on with the movement, climbing off the machine and heading for his clothes. The scene was over.
“Well, I’ll let Dr. Reynolds know you’re here,” Nurse Sara said at last, smiling back at him as she walked to a cupboard. “He’s going to want to examine you, so please get completely undressed, underwear too, and put this gown on with the opening in the back. You can use this sheet to cover your lap if you’d like.”
,” Steve says, his voice rising as Dr. Stark starts pushing into him, and fuck, fuck, fuck, why does his finger seem so big?
It didn’t take much for his wandering mind to dwell on all the what-ifs that might’ve prevented the very thing he was there to mourn: what if Steve had just done a little more, what if Dr. Strange had told them what to expect so they could’ve planned for it, what if Tony had flown to Carol with the Stones instead of using them himself?
“Tony,” he said, and damn it, he’d meant to call him Stark. He plowed on anyway. “I think everyone on this entire floor could hear you.”
He doesn’t know how long it lasts—a few seconds realistically, but it feels longer. It feels like an eternity that he’s splayed open and pitiful, his ass aching and covered in slick. He does know that it’s too quiet, though. Dr. Stark doesn’t say anything, and Steve can’t yet, too mortified to do anything except try and slow his heaving breaths, and he only accomplishes that much because the drape keeps him from seeing whatever expression is on Dr. Stark’s face.
either,” he says wryly, the faintest hint of a blush rising back to his cheeks.  “After today, I’m going to pretend it never happened.”
It was, and it wasn’t, because while he could feel Tony’s erection pressing against his back and have Tony’s arm across his chest, he couldn’t touch him back or see him, which wasn’t anywhere close to what Steve had been hoping for.
“Did you know that you talk about me a lot?” Tony asks, biting down briefly and making Steve jerk.  “Seriously, a
Steve doesn’t know if that’s a step up or a step down from his normal state of finding Tony attractive, but it’s not like he has a say in the matter either way.  Tony has a habit of getting under a person’s skin and then making himself at home, and Steve is not immune.
That hope took a blow, however, when Tony finally pulled away and Steve saw the pair of ears he’d picked out. Steve wouldn’t have said that he’d had any expectations of what he’d be wearing, but apparently he would’ve been wrong, because the ears came as a surprise. They were the same color as his hair, and they were long and floppy, falling halfway down his face. If anything, Steve would’ve assumed they’d be short and out of the way, but these grazed against his cheeks every time he so much as twitched, and he could tell they were going to impede his field of vision.
It wasn’t like Tony was blameless. He’d done … so many things wrong. Had hurt Steve past the point he could bear and kept on going.
“Are you normally this tight?” Dr. Stark asks, and there’s something about the way that he says it that makes Steve shudder, makes him feel like he’s going to drench the whole damn floor in slick, and his thighs fall open from where they’d been trying to close.
“Yeah, but Tony doesn’t know that,” which is a fair point and so not relevant to anything he should be discussing.
Steve hears a sharp inhale, and he looks up to meet wide eyes, which are much closer than they’d been a second ago.
“Of course you can,” Tony said and smiled.
to stay? Unless the idea of leaving filled him with so much fear that he was desperate?
Tony hesitated. “I’ve talked
Steve just shook his head in reply, a fast, jerky movement, but he pushed his chest further into Tony’s fingers, to use and abuse his sweet little nipples, and Tony supposed that was answer enough. Steve really was too good to be true.
“A lot like who?” he demands, and he feels sick at the thought that Tony might’ve fallen in love with him because he reminds Tony of someone else.
to keep going. Stopping would’ve been unbearable.”
Stark glanced up at the sound of the door closing, loud enough apparently to be heard over the din in his ears.
“I can do it however you want me to, Steve,” he said, putting words to action and squeezing hard enough that Steve’s knees buckled, his fingers pressing bruises into Tony’s skin.  “Is this too much for you?”
“It’s all right, Steve,” Dr. Stark says soothingly. “You’re doing just fine,” but he’s not because Steve’s hips are tilted up now, and Dr. Stark ends up getting his prostate multiple times in a row.
The thought had made him laugh so hard at the time that he’d stumbled and nearly sliced a chunk out of his leg.
Finally, Dr. Stark moves on to the exam itself, and it’s torture to have his hands on Steve’s neck, his back as Dr. Stark tells him what to do. He’s standing so close, and Steve shivers and presses his thighs together, trying to hide his scent as long as possible, because once he moves, it’s going to permeate the entire room.
sliding the blankets a little higher so they almost cover the lower half of his face, in letting Dr. Stark’s scent envelop him and keep him safe.
Before anyone yells at me, Tony doesn't actually die.
Just not . . . him.
Everything happened in a rush after that, and he didn’t have the opportunity to focus on anything except the upcoming battle, except then—
If things had gone better between them, he wouldn’t have added that one, but considering the situation, he felt it had to be said.
“Steve?”
He’d intended to finish out his contract with Tony, but he’d thought they might do it long-distance at first, keeping their separate apartments but seeing each other on the weekends and gradually move towards living together again. That had changed as soon as he’d realized how hurt Tony still was about what had happened. He couldn’t ask Tony to have a long-distance relationship when that meant leaving Tony over and over again. It had to be all or nothing.
He hesitated, his heart racing, knowing it was going to come off as an accusation; that it was one. “Tony, I—”
“Thank you,” Tony said, his fingers ghosting down Steve’s cheek before dropping away completely, and Steve missed them fiercely as soon as they were gone. “Keep them closed until I tell you otherwise.”
“Why don’t you take him?” Tony asked without any expectation in his voice of it actually happening.
Or three days after that:
But he’d never taken an unwilling Sub, or one whose kinks didn’t line up with his, because it was all too easy to do something you’d regret the next day when you were in the middle of a scene, and he didn’t want to be that kind of memory for anyone.  He much preferred to be the type of memory that someone brought out in the middle of masturbating, thank you very much, the one that made people blush and squeeze their thighs together because of the pulse of arousal they got from the recollection.  He didn’t think it was asking too much to be considered a sex god was all.
After the Serum, he’d been too busy to train with anyone, first undergoing test after test to see what he could do, and then later, touring the United States to generate money for the war effort. Even after he’d teamed up with Bucky and the Howling Commandos, he’d been getting so much real-life experience that sparring had become unnecessary.
He had to do it again when Steve shook, Steve’s cock making a wet sound as it slapped against his stomach, and fuck, Tony obviously needed to spend more time mapping out Steve’s pain boundaries, because he wasn’t anywhere close.
Steve woke up early the next morning, his eyes heavy and gritty. He hadn’t been able to sleep much.
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve said, because it didn’t anymore. Tony hadn’t been part of the project, and he hadn’t been keeping anything from Steve. The rest wasn’t important. “Nick just said some things that—”
-----
Would it kill Tony to look a little disappointed?
He followed Tony’s—no,
-----
Still, when Tony accepted the mug with a heartfelt “thank you” and took a sip, sighing in contentment, it filled Steve with hope—irrationally and foolishly maybe, but it was true nonetheless. It was just a cup of coffee. But it seemed like so much more than that.
“Wait,” Steve said, almost a gasp, because it hurt to interrupt Tony when he was going to—
“It’s alright. I know, I know,” he said, as he put Steve on his knees on the bench for the next part, his ass about waist level to him. Even though he wasn’t actually saying anything of meaning, the tone seemed to reassure Steve, enough that Tony could take a step back and spill half of the lube getting his fingers coated, but whatever, he could buy more. He rested his left hand on the back of Steve’s neck, not for Steve for once, but for himself, needing the contact, the illusion of control, and then he pushed two fingers into Steve, closing his eyes at the sensation.
managed to find each other, that it would've lasted beyond a few months?
sensitive. He stares up at Dr. Stark in shock and gets a surprised look in return before Dr. Stark starts to frown.
-----
Steve had done that. To him, to them. He’d ruined all of it, and he couldn’t help but wonder if any amount of suffering on his part would ever be enough to fix it.
“Tony, you don’t …” He refuses to let himself get distracted by the fact that they’re touching. For the first time. Somewhere other than their hands and Steve’s—
“So as I was saying, I owe you one.”
Steve closed his eyes, resting his head on his forearm and then trying to keep as still as possible.  He gave a sigh of relief as Tony worked the plug into him, grateful for the extra security.
“Do you?” He ran a hand through his hair. “Look, if it’s for you, then we can talk about it. If you seriously think I should hurt you somehow because you-you hurt me and that not punishing you will actually make it worse instead of better, then you can tell me that. But if it’s for me,” he said, his expression softening without permission, “if you think this will somehow make
Steve sits up and does as he’s told, all too conscious of how he’s staring at Dr. Stark’s face, because there’s nowhere else to look, and of how naked he is while he’s doing it. There are only a few reasons why he’d be opening his mouth in front of an alpha like Dr. Stark, and with the two of them so close to each other, he can’t help but think of the other scenarios, even as he tells himself to stop.
“Yeah,” Steve said after a short pause, his whole face flushed. “Like that.”
He knew he was a bad Sub.
He’d hurt Tony. Again and again. Had believed Tony capable of … terrible things and left him to suffer the consequences of Hydra’s infiltration on his own and without any warning. How did a person apologize for something like that? How did he fix it?
Tony by some miracle.
“Right,” he scoffed. “Excuse me if I find it hard to believe that nearly a year after you go off into the wild blue yonder, you decide you want to catch up on old times.”
That’d be the smart thing.
If anything, the thought makes him feel worse, and he’s being ridiculous, he knows he is, but–
And Tony had just needed something to focus on besides the pain.
He preferred to not think. Not remember. And that worked for the most part, except for when it didn’t, and those days, he’d stay in his motel room and let the memories rush over him until he was strong enough to stuff them back into the lockbox in his mind.
“I’ve always liked Stark,” she said, leaning back in her chair, and he looked up in time to see her expression turn sly. “And I’ve heard some of the most interesting things about him,” she said, her tone making it apparent exactly what kind of things she was referring to, and he laughed and took another bite of food, hoping to cover his flush. “What? Don’t you want to know?” she asked, looking at him expectantly.
Actually Tony’s chest is a lot wider across than Steve would’ve thought it was. And his thighs are
“Thank you,” he says sincerely, and relaxes just a little, because it’s out of his hands now. He can’t get to Steve, can’t ruin their friendship by letting his knot take over his brain and make a pass where it’s not wanted. He’s safe.
(fyi max accepts commissions, so if you’re interested, please go to their tumblr to find out more)
It was always after one of those times, when he was already off-kilter, that thoughts of Tony would manage to sneak in. If Steve’s recollections of the past could be compared to an amputated limb, the pain radiating out from nonexistent flesh in flashes and bursts that drove him to his knees, then his memories of Tony were a freshly-taken wound that refused to even try to heal, open and bleeding him dry.
Okay, short, short chapter, but real life has been...and the summer is basically a time of no writing for me, and I've been getting a lot of requests for an update, AND you guys know how much I love my cliffhangers, so here we are.
Sorry for all the exposition, but I had to set the story up. Next chapter is already written, and I'll post it in a few days.
Steve wasn’t hard anymore, filled with too many regrets and worries to maintain a state of arousal, but he didn’t care. Tony hadn’t abandoned him. Tony wanted him to put on a show.
He was kind of tempted to go a little kamikaze on Steve in retaliation--the worst pain of his life, really--but he controlled himself and started by rubbing Steve’s shoulders.
“I wasn’t—”  Steve’s jaw clenched, and Tony could see his finger tightening around the strap of his bag.  “Maybe to someone like
“Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?” Tony asked, and Steve knew there were other people watching and they were pretending to have never met, but it was jarring nonetheless. As if Tony didn’t know what Steve did to train.
Steve stilled, his eyes searching Tony’s for a long time.
Steve knew he was teasing. It was
The two at Steve’s thighs get to stay, since they’d been relatively respectful, but he assigns the three others to making sure Steve doesn’t drown. Sure, Steve apparently likes suckers on his nipples, but they hadn’t known that at the time. He replaces two of them with the ones who’d actually been doing what they were supposed to before, one tentacle per nipple to avoid fights. They immediately find their targets, and Steve jerks, his fingers digging into Tony, his hips doing something absolutely captivating as Tony’s tentacles taste and pull on his tender skin.
"Must I what?" Tony asks, and even in the suit, Tony can't pull off the air of injured innocence.
This time it was Steve pulling Tony closer.
“What about you?” Steve asked, getting up off his stool. He took the rest of Tony’s sandwich and put it back on the plate, holding on to it while he reached out with his free hand, and when Tony only watched it, he carefully took hold of Tony’s wrist. “Shouldn’t you go to bed too?”
It hadn’t been enough. He hadn’t been. He knew that already. It was why they were in this situation. Because for all his good intentions, he’d never done half the things he should’ve.
to go?” he asked, finally looking a little uncertain.
“Or not,” his neighbor said, raising an eyebrow at Steve’s continued silence.
Steve was worried he wouldn’t like it. And what that meant for him and Tony if it were true.
What did that mean—he wasn’t—was he coming back?
The things that Tony did to him, that he made

He closed his eyes for a second.
Well.  That at least explains why he asked Tony to marry him, Steve thinks, flushing so hotly that his face feels like it’s going to explode.

with Steve, because all he can suddenly think about it is that with the way they’re positioned, they could kiss while Dr. Stark finger fucked him, and he forces himself to collapse back onto the table before Dr. Stark actually touches him and Steve tries to make that a reality.
“Wh-wh-wha—” Steve cleared his throat. “Tony—”

Next chapter (or the one after that, depending on how cooperative these two are), pet play!
“Being on my knees for you is the only thing I’ve managed to get right in the last few days,” Steve said, letting his hands fall to reveal the twist of his lips.
Although the pool might have been on the roof; he vaguely remembered Stark mentioning a glass ceiling so he could look at the sky while he was swimming laps. He hadn’t been paying attention, too jittery, wanting to work off some steam but not knowing how to when everything looked so clean and untouched. He could just imagine Stark’s gym being the same, the leather polished, the weights shining, and he couldn’t picture himself breaking punching bag after punching bag, the sand spilling like blood over the floor. He’d given Stark a stilted goodnight soon after and retreated to his room.
“What?”
“Look,” Tony said, reaching out to put a calming hand on Captain America’s arm, “I don’t know what Dom/Sub dynamics were like back then, or your past relationships, but nowadays—”
if he doesn’t say anything.
they were together. Tony had never made a point of taking Steve out where they’d be noticed, had seemed to do the opposite in fact, and Steve had appreciated it at the time, although he’d never thanked Tony for it, just like all the other things he’d accepted from Tony but never acknowledged.
“Yes.”

anything—to be able to keep at least that with him in the darkness and the cold.
Steve swayed to the side when Tony added a second finger, and he barely managed to throw his hand out to catch himself as Tony pushed back in, twisting his fingers back and forth and rocking over Steve’s prostate as if his goal was to drive Steve as crazy as possible.
affected, much more than he would’ve thought possible considering the idea of doing this for Tony hadn’t aroused him.  The reality, however, was a little different.
Steve wasn’t the type of person to pretend or make up emotions that weren’t there, but faced with losing something good—because Tony had to believe Steve would’ve left by now if they hadn’t—
he was there and headed upstairs. He should’ve phoned to tell Tony he was in town, or at least sent a text. Hell, he probably should’ve contacted Tony after the mission was over. With the time difference, it wouldn’t have even been that late, and he could’ve told him approximately what time he’d be in New York. He hadn’t given Tony any kind of ETA about when he’d get in, though, just said it’d be a three day mission, so he had no one but himself to blame that Tony was occupied.
He ignores the the flowers already on display and heads inside, and what. What.
“JARVIS,” he said, clinging on to hope for as long as he could. He had to swallow a few times to get enough saliva to talk. “Who taped up my back?”

“I like to approach each day with a smile on my face and a song in my heart,” he said lightly. “But who says I’m kidding? I’d give you this room if you wanted it.”
“Were you happy with Mr. Stark?” she asked at last, and it would’ve been a lie to say yes.
“It’s alright, it’s alright, Steve,” he hears, head swimming, his heart throwing itself against his chest, and it takes a long time to realize Dr. Stark is carefully wiping at his torso with the sheet.
He was finally ready, however, to let people see what he and Tony were to each other, what they could be. And he wanted Tony to know that.
He hadn’t ever expected to get this. And now that he knew what it felt like to hold Steve, it would just hurt that much more later.
He could feel his eyes widen.

Steve could swear that he heard Tony’s voice, but that made no sense.  Tony hadn’t been in the ice with him, hadn’t even known Tony existed then.  He’d been alone, forgotten and unnecessary.
“I’m not . . . not doing so well. I think I have a fever. I was going to get some aspirin just now, but then you came. What are you doing? Is something wrong with the door?”
“Now, Pepper,” he began and had to flinch at the look she gave him.  Pepper was actually a Switch rather than a straight out Sub, and while she’d enjoyed submitting to him most of the time when they’d been together, he’d always suspected she would’ve liked having him over her knee a lot more frequently than he’d actually bent over during their relationship.  Her current expression made him even more certain.
Tony.
Steve felt saliva begin to gather in his mouth, and he swallowed hastily, glancing at the security camera out of the corner of his eye. He couldn’t believe Tony had asked JARVIS to tell him that, and although JARVIS sounded normal, he had no idea what to say to him now.
“Keep it in mind,” Tony said and drew Steve’s head down to demand one last kiss. Had it always been this good, kissing Steve? He honestly couldn’t remember. “On your knees now, Gorgeous,” he said, his heart filled to bursting as Steve complied, automatically putting his arms behind his back.
He nodded slowly, realizing Tony was waiting for a response. Alright. Okay. He’d make sure to do a thorough job.
“If you’d just relax--”
There was something wrong with Tony.
It felt less like a discovery of something new than an acknowledgement of what had been right before his eyes. Of course he was in love with Tony. Of course he was. After everything Tony had done for him, all the kindnesses, big and small, how could Steve not love him?
His cock slapped wetly against his stomach, and he didn’t know when he’d closed his eyes, but he squeezed them shut even further and struggled to calm down and slow his panting breaths.
He remembered calling Steve, only for it to go immediately to voicemail, and being annoyed Fury was keeping him buried in meetings; seeing the coverage on the news in horrified disbelief; glancing at his phone obsessively and constantly checking with JARVIS that he hadn’t been sent something out of the ordinary, some kind of code or a spam email or
“—have what you need.”
Tony chooses that moment to pounce and ferociously attack Thor’s cape.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s shower had ten shower heads. Ten. Two in each corner, one hanging from the ceiling, and a handheld one in the more customary position about three-quarters up the wall. And Steve had thought the two in his bathroom were excessive—although, admittedly wonderful, especially after a long workout.
He swallowed, and it took him an embarrassing amount of time to say, “You don’t know me,” a thread of hoarseness running through his voice. It was ridiculous how affected he was by what she’d said.
“But what kind of Dom would I be—”
, he might have to give Fury even more tech to balance things out, because Tony would totally have paid money to do this.
he’s enjoyed himself because Steve comes like a fucking geyser—he knows it can’t last.
It took her longer to break into the main system, and Steve was starting to worry when she finally said, “Alright, I’ve found them. Dr. Martin is located on level 5 and her husband is on B-4.”
“But that much?” Steve asked, his fingers straightening slowly, gesturing towards the lines that criss-crossed Tony’s skin.
He closed his eyes just before he got a faceful of washcloth, too sore to dodge out of the way. “I don’t remember your aftercare being this brusque, but time does cloud memory, I suppose,” he said as he gingerly draped the cloth on his forehead.
After a while, Dr. Stark’s hands move from his nipples to his chest and back, again and again, and Steve is going to go crazy. His nipples are already more sensitive than normal, so it almost hurts when Dr. Stark touches them, a sharp burst of sensation that sweetens and expands until Dr. Stark lets go to massage him again, but even that feels better than it had before, Dr. Stark’s fingers pressing into the muscle, lifting his breasts almost like an offering while his nipples pulse with remembered pleasure.
“Did you end up going anywhere?”
And he’d been—
Although . . . he wasn’t sleeping, was he? And it really was going to be a long flight; and he already knew he’d inevitably spend much of it thinking about Tony, unable to do anything except sit there and wait; and yes, he’d already taken care of himself in the shower after he’d gotten back, but that had been a while ago, and it’d been quick and perfunctory at best.
He sucked in a sharp breath, feeling his neck muscles tighten reflexively, his Adam’s apple dip as he tried to swallow.
“Anywhere. Well, within reason. I got a message saying SHIELD wants you to stop by in the morning for a checkup,” Stark said, rolling his eyes. “But otherwise, the sky’s the limit. Kind of. How do you feel about flying?”
Of course, that was when Tony said, “Spread your legs a little wider for me, Steve,” and all hope that this wouldn’t be half as embarrassing as he thought it was going to be flew right out the—thankfully closed—window.
about sex as a result. The kind where he’s so desperate for cock that he doesn’t mind if the prep is minimal; where he cares more about getting a knot deep inside of him than being able to sit on a chair afterwards.
The sneer on Captain America’s face seemed to get bigger and bigger the more he talked.  “Making money by creating weapons designed for mass murder and being lucky enough to have a father who could pass along his genius don’t make you
It was bad enough to be attracted to Tony, but letting himself act on that, or letting himself nurture that attraction, would’ve been … disrespectful, to Tony and to Pepper. And foolhardy. And for all that Steve put himself in the path of most resistance more times than not, he wasn’t actually a masochist, and allowing his feelings for Tony to grow the way they'd wanted to would’ve been setting himself up for pain.
good, Tony’s fingers inside of him, pressing and rubbing . . .  The sensations would build up, everything spiraling upward, pleasure turning sharp and aching—and then it would seep away, leaving him unfulfilled, like a promise, broken, heightening the yearning but taking away the need. He’d seek out Tony that much more frequently as a result, only to have Tony toy with him once again, drawing everything out until he felt like a strand of taffy at the edge of breaking apart. Only then would Tony let him climax, when the tension had ratcheted up exponentially, so it felt like an explosion when Steve finally came, and he was ruined in its wake.
“You don’t need to thank me. I told you there’d always be a place for you here,” he said, remembering he’d told Steve that right before he’d gotten on his motorcycle and driven away. “G’night.”
“I fucked up,” he said hoarsely, his hand twisting around the handle of his bag. Five minutes. That was no time at all. “I knew I was doing it, but I didn’t—I didn’t
What else could he have done, though? Honestly, what had Steve expected? No Dom worth his salt would’ve punished Steve for not feeling the same way, as if a person could force someone to love him. It didn’t work that way.
What if the reason Dr. Stark acts the way he does is because he doesn’t want anything to do with him?
“Are you kidding me?”  Tony moved closer until he could whisper in Steve’s ear.  “That looks like it’d fall apart the first time you tried to fuck me over the back of it.  We need something . . . sturdier.”
He blinked several times in order to clear his blurry vision, almost wishing he hadn’t when the all too familiar ceiling came into focus. He hadn’t slept in his own room for over a month, but he’d memorized all the tiny dips and divots in his supposed “prison” a long time ago.
Tony rolled his eyes at whatever expression was on Steve’s face.
If only he’d realized it a few days ago, Steve thought, his stomach sinking, knowing it wasn’t the best time for his epiphany. Even if he had the courage to admit his feelings, there’d be next to no chance that Tony would believe—
important was that he was a
“I won’t,” Steve promised, clutching Tony a little closer. “I’ve got you, Tony.  We’ll get out of here together.”
“I’m on my way.” He turned back to the bed. The conversation had been so short that he hadn’t even made it out of the bedroom yet.
Tony used to kill people from a distance.
“It seems my brother is attempting to distract us from searching for him,” Thor says, looking oddly sheepish.  “Be not troubled, friend Steve.  Loki’s transformation spells were always for mischief and not harm, and they never lasted longer than the time it took the sun to travel across the sky.”
They were corralled into the medical wing and separated into different examination rooms. Steve’s nurse was embarrassingly fervid in her thanks, as if he’d single-handedly saved the world, when in reality, he’d been one of the minor players. In the end, he managed to change the subject by asking her if he needed to change.
so much, who’d welcome Dr. Stark with open arms and even more open legs, who’d let Dr. Stark knot him over and over again, until he was too fucked out to even—
Steve found himself hoping that was the case, that Tony had been working or even—or even out (
“I know. I like you, too.”
He anticipated a variety of reactions, from Tony watching him calmly, to bursting out laughing, to even making a joke at his expense (the last was unlikely, but he felt he should be prepared). What he hadn’t expected, however, was the …
I can't believe these last three chapters have been all porn, but there you go.
Except then his body was jerking as his momentum changed and he was abruptly being lifted
There’s a quick moment of silence where Dr. Stark doesn’t move, doesn’t do anything, and Steve wonders if he’s looking at how his nipples are standing at attention, if he can see Steve’s cock, lying hard against his stomach under the sheet, but then Dr. Stark steps up to the table, and Steve has other things to worry about.
“I’d forgotten how much you need it,” Tony said in a tone Steve didn’t understand, but that wasn’t why—
“In what way?”
He had to hand it to Steve, Tony thought wryly as he got into position. He didn’t even flinch.
get hard whenever he thought about the shower.
loving him the way he should, Steve thought, feeling sick, and he had to breathe out of his mouth, because he hadn’t once stopped and considered whether the fucking machine was anything other than a way to hurt him. Because he was always willing to believe the worst of Tony, whenever he could.
He made his way slowly up the stairs, his body feeling too heavy for his bones to hold up, and he found Tony in his office, the computer Steve had used gone, although it didn’t stop JARVIS from projecting screens for Tony to use.
He tilted his head back and rested it against the brick as he breathed, in and out, in and out.
He did when all the lights came on, but he wished he hadn’t.
Although, he thought, raising his eyes to meet Tony’s, maybe—maybe Tony was waiting on his opinion to give his decision?
to—go back to the Compound and look for you.  I find myself looking to the south throughout the day, searching the skies for red and gold.  The number of times I’ve considered abandoning the others . . .
“Please take off all your clothes and put this on with the opening in the front,” Nurse Grace says, handing him a flimsy robe, and it’s all he can do to look her in the eyes as he nods and smiles awkwardly. “Dr. Stark will be in in a few minutes.”
Hmm.  He tilted his head.  Was there something wrong with the hands?  The perspective seemed off.
On the plane ride to New York, he’d finally decided what he was going to ask Tony for next: a date. Somewhere public, where everyone could see the two of them together, and someplace romantic, so no one could mistake
tired earlier. But then, he’d been so focused on Tony that he hadn’t really paid attention to where Tony had taken him.
He settled back on his legs. His hands weren’t quite steady as he grabbed the denim, and they were strangely slow, moving the material at a glacial pace. He watched as first dark grey cotton boxer-briefs were revealed—the undershirt just covering the juncture of Tony’s legs—then toned thighs with their sprinkling of hair, knobby knees, and finally, he got the barest glimpse of Tony’s shins and calves as the jeans fell completely to the floor.
He felt drained—happy and weirdly calm—but so, so tired, and he didn’t fight the urge to say, “Thank you,” one more time, his voice low and scratchy. Tony laughed, gently ruffling his hair.
Tony flinched, yanked from his thoughts, and he looked at Steve wildly.
“Tell you what?” he asked, pulling the cork out, and he made the mistake of looking up at Steve. Fuck. He looked good. Healthy. Time away from Tony had obviously agreed with him.
“What … what happened?” Steve breathed, almost too softly to hear, and Tony wished it’d been quieter still so he could deny it for that much longer.
It wasn’t necessary. Nothing she was asking was information they wouldn’t put in his files after all, something which Stark had complete access to as his Dom. He appreciated the gesture, however, and the intent behind it.
What if he’s not?
He hadn’t fallen in love with her then, but it’d been a short ride down from there, each encounter solidifying the image in his head of the two of them after the war, him on his knees beside her, her collar around his neck.
His bedroom. Tony wanted him in his bedroom. Where Steve had given him a blowjob last night.
“What were you thinking?” Hill demanded several hours later after they finally managed to drag him away from the crowd to SHIELD headquarters.
Warnings: Underage pining, although nothing sexual happens; angst
The blanket slid off at some point, and he’d mourn the loss of Dr. Stark’s scent, but he’s more worried about how hard and fast he’s breathing, how he’s advertising how close he is again. Once had been bad enough. He desperately wants to hold off from coming again, but as the seconds tick by, Dr. Stark doesn’t stop, and Steve’s starting to sound high and strained.
The texture was different from anything he’d experienced before, a little rougher and drier, but far from unpleasant. Tony’s tongue was really long, though, gliding over Steve’s whole cock and even his balls at the same time. It lifted and pulled gently at them as it moved, and it was a dizzying flood of sensations, especially when more and more of Tony’s saliva started falling onto his skin. Tony just produced
Steve has always appreciated men’s arms. Maybe … maybe not quite this much, but that’s probably just because he’s here right now, Tony directly in front of him, and once he looks away, he’ll realize his sudden fascination is actually completely normal for him.
He swallowed, pushing that thought away forcibly.  It was fine.
get up, Tony.” Steve’s voice cracked. “You shouldn’t be down here, especially while you’re still recovering.”
“No one’s arguing with you that you made the right decision, Tony!” she said, putting her hand on his arm.  “
“You can tell just from looking at them how strong their relationship is. They haven’t stopped touching since the moment they saw each other, and they’re giving each other comfort, and more importantly, accepting it. They’re not going to let this drive them apart.”
What could Steve say, though? That he didn’t deserve to hold Tony’s hand where anyone could see? That Tony should know better? That before everything had happened, Steve had wanted to go out with Tony and be open with his affections but he couldn’t do it
Steve froze.
But it was just right
But only in a fantasy sort of way. He knows he’d be disappointed if that were the type of alpha Tony actually turned out to be.
Steve glared at the verbal jab, but he didn’t bother denying the necessity of being able to abuse Tony in private. Asshole.
“Look at you,” Tony said, his hands once again reaching out to Steve’s stomach as if he couldn’t help himself, his touch tender and worshipful. “Fuck, you’re so beautiful like this, Steve.”
nice boy this year.  Or a naughty one, depending on which you like better,” Tony said, leering cheerfully.
, portable shield that was able to keep him safe from ninety-nine percent of hand-held weapons and emitted a strong electrical shock to anyone that tried to touch him when it was activated.
Had Steve felt … obligated somehow?
He very carefully doesn’t stare at what Dr. Stark’s hands are doing and takes a deep breath in through his nose—only to get a lungful of the heavy, sweet scent of his slick, which is drowning the room in his arousal.
“Sure, anytime you want,” Tony said, wondering if he should ask—not sure he wanted to know the answer.
Right?
“So you’re saying you don’t even like me, but you’re willing to let me stick my—”
Tony pulled back, a frown forming on his lips. “I don’t think—”
—that loosened Steve’s tongue. That made him say things he would never have said before.
Rather than admitting the only gorgeous person or view he wanted was the one right in front of him, Steve said, “Tony, you know I don’t care about that sort of thing.”
ETA: This is now a full fic
start ignoring him once the novelty had passed. Nonetheless, if Steve were being fair—something he recognized he didn’t want to be, which only made it even more important that he do it—until he did, Stark’s courtesy meant he, in turn, needed to try harder. He wouldn’t kneel down, but he could be polite, could try to make the next three months bearable, could stop accusing Stark of every possible abuse under the sun just because he wasn’t the Dom Steve had wanted.
“I’m going to bring the car up,” Happy says, and Tony nods, signing the last of his discharge papers.
He kept to the road for a long time, stopping wherever looked promising. He drove through national parks and visited out-of-the-way museums, ate in diners that ranged from quaint to just plain disgusting and tried a piece of blueberry pie that he would’ve cried over in different days, and it didn’t get better.
It didn’t make Steve feel any more comfortable about the idea, however. Growing up, his mother and then someone from the orphanage had accompanied him to his medical visits, and after he’d moved to the boarding house, Bucky had done it whenever he could.
“Hmm?” he replied, as if he didn’t know what Steve was really asking. He could feel Steve quiver with indecision—why wasn’t Tony letting go? Should he say something? How long should a hug last?—and he hid a smile.
Steve didn’t ask any of the questions he no doubt had as he followed along, but that was fine. Tony knew he’d figure it out pretty quickly, or he’d ask, since Steve wasn’t exactly shy when it came to demanding the answers he wanted, but until then, Tony would enjoy Steve’s bemusement while he could.
He’s always been impressed by the employees they send over.  Attractive obviously, but that’s the least of their qualifications.  They’re well-read, knowledgeable on politics, philosophy, pop-culture, fluid dynamics, whatever he could want, he’s never been disappointed, and that’s saying something considering Tony can be a demanding son of a bitch, or so he’s been told.
If only it were so.
?”  He lightly smacked Tony on the head with his sketchpad and stood up, taking a few steps before turning around to face him.  He normally enjoyed Tony’s lack of respect for personal boundaries—too much sometimes—but at that moment, he needed some distance between them.  “There are so many reasons why I won’t marry you, Tony,
“Steve?” he said, lifting his head.
“I was going to call!” It was too little, too late, but he had to try. “I meant to, but Nick told me about Project Insight. About your role in it,” Steve said, blurting it out, and shit, he knew he wasn’t explaining himself well, but he had to say something before he lost his chance. “He said—”
“You still doing all right there, Steve?”
“For God and country, eh?  Lie back and think of America?  Wow, I can’t wait.  Can I take you home right now?”
“Fury dies, and I don’t hear anything from you,” Tony said, and Steve flinched at the words, at how even his voice was, almost bored in tone. It was only the blankness of his eyes that told Steve he wasn’t as unaffected as he seemed. Tony had always been expressive, his hands flying all over and his face stretching into smiles and frowns at the drop of a hat, but it was his eyes that had let Steve know what he was feeling. And when they were masked like that, it meant Tony was hiding his emotions, because they were too much.
Maybe it’s because he goes to Dr. Stark, knowing he’s going to get naked and be examined and that he’ll end up collecting fodder for all the long nights in between visits; if he went to Tony, however, he’d go wanting to be held, and since that’s not going to happen, he stops himself before he can get started.
the way you’ve been handling things—”
Maybe Tony would make it vibrate? Steve had seen discreet ads for vibrators in Submissives’ magazines back in his day, and he could admit to a being curious about them, although he’d never gone so far as to order one. Maybe Tony would—

“Just a technicality.” Ah, sweet alcohol. It was one thing in his life he could always depend on. “Fury’s provided me with a chain of documentation that shows you didn’t want a Dom. It might get him in trouble since he was your Negotiator, but I doubt you’d press charges in the first place, and considering the circumstances, they’d probably just think he’d been overzealous and leave it at a slap on the wrist since things turned out the way they did. Still, the documentation would hold up in court, although considering who you are, if you’d told any judge that you wanted out of a contract, they’d—”

I apologize that we’re almost 10K in and there’s not even a hint of porn yet. No one is sadder about this than I am.
“What? Who are they?”
He wet a washcloth with cold water and wiped at his face. What the hell was wrong with him? He’d faced down enemy soldiers with more composure than this.
“What about that—”
, Captain,” she said, her voice hitching. She cleared her throat. “Now if you’ll just take off your clothes down to your underwear, the doctor will be in shortly.”
He couldn’t blame him for it, though. If caring about a person was the trust that he wouldn’t hurt you, or if he did, he’d do his best to not hurt you more than you could bear, Steve had already shown Tony he didn’t deserve his affection.
“I bet,” Tony murmured sympathetically, and it was just two words, but there was a wealth of warmth in his voice that had Steve closing his eyes.
By all rights, Tony should be bored out of his mind, but it’s actually kind of nice holding the Angel now that they’ve got a rhythm going. He’s really warm, which is soothing, and from what little Tony can see of his face, Tony’s beginning to suspect he might also be kind of beautiful. Tony hadn’t noticed before, what with trying to figure out logistics and the fact that the Angel’s hair had been plastered to his skin, hiding a lot of his features. It’s somewhat dry now, though, enough to mostly slide off his face, and Tony finds himself looking behind him less and less frequently in favor of trying to get a better look at him.
Many thanks to meece for betaing parts of this chapter.
“Alright then, I’m going to give you a lab slip so they can take a few blood samples, but you look to be doing well. We just have one last thing to do, and then you can be on your way.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Rogers.”
“Wait,” Tony said, “do you mean you didn’t
“I know so,” she says, and the dawning wonder on Tony’s face is better than anything Steve could've imagined.
So Steve wanted a kiss. Steve had
“You are a fool,” Loki said, and Thor couldn’t help himself.  He reached out, cupping his precious face in his hand, marveling at the ability to do so freely and without harm.  He mourned the loss of blue, even though Loki had informed him it was not a permanent change.  Still, it felt almost a betrayal to find this pink-skinned version of him as appealing as he did.  “And I, doubly so, for your idiocy excuses you, but I previously had no such failing to blame for my feelings for you.  Perchance it is madness.  Or your brand of foolishness is contagious perhaps.”
“Loki,” he pleaded, sliding his fingers down to clutch at Loki’s tunic and dropping his head to his shoulder.
“Steve,” Tony said, the barest hint of a slur to his words. “I told you not to wait up.”
He goes to the refrigerator and pulls out a carton of eggs, grabbing another carton, too, in case he can get Tony to eat some as well.  Sometimes, if he sneaks food in front of Tony, he’ll just start eating without paying attention until it’s too late.
“Yes,” Steve breathed, licking his lips before taking Tony’s thumb in, sucking and rolling his tongue around it.
“Welcome to your new home,” Tony said, throwing open the doors to his penthouse and spreading his arms to show off all the glory.  And his pad was nice, too.
“Okay, but then how

relieved, he is, had felt self-conscious and paranoid even knowing that, in all likelihood, there wasn’t anyone else in the office, but he’s also ….
Luck, and Tony.
Tony asked him if some movie was alright, and Steve agreed without even hearing the name. He didn’t care what they were going to see. All he cared about was getting his hands on Tony.
He doesn’t want to abandon Tony, wants to stay with him and learn more about the things he likes to do and exchange silly stories and see if Tony kisses on the first date (and what else he’s willing to do as well), but in order to do that, he somehow has to admit that he’s leaking through his pants and barely refraining from throwing himself at Tony and riding him right then and there, other patrons be damned.
But then came all the questions, and Steve moved away, let Tony slip from between his fingers, and he knew it was the right thing to do, but it hurt more than he would’ve thought possible.
Warnings: AU, first time Tony and Steve meet
By the time he was done, the room gleamed, all bare workspaces and open floor, the damage hidden, even though it didn’t make the reality any more bearable.
Still, Morgan eventually started to smile shyly at him when he visited, and it was strange, but Steve discovered that he
Shit. He wouldn’t.
Steve’s face burned, and he wanted to say that Tony had told him not to, that he would have if Tony had let him … but he couldn’t blame Tony for his disbelief, not really, not after the past few days. Although he couldn’t help but selfishly wish that Tony would take into account his previous actions, all the things he’d done in the past—
“Ma, you know Bruce, of course, and these are his sons. This is Dick, Tim, and Damian, and I think Jason said he’d be arriving late.”
“So you’re going to feel my hand on your thigh,” Dr. Stark tells him, putting his words to action, and ohhh, Steve hopes he mistakes the way he twitches for nervousness, “and I’m going to move towards the juncture of your legs and insert one finger inside of you, all right, Steve?”

“They’ve known Rhodey for years.  They know he knows better.”
was a mistake anymore and mean it.
“I think I will be,” he said, cautious but hopeful.
Steve didn’t know how much time passed, the seconds seeming to drag on, one after the other, and he had to adjust twice, his hands sweaty from nervousness, his fingers slipping against his own skin. At least the sweat helped him push the tip of one finger in, not exactly comfortable, but it was worth it, though, for the sharp inhale of air he finally heard from behind him moments later, for the silence that stretched out after it.
“It’s alright,” Tony said in a near wheeze as Peter lifted him into the air with the force of his hug. “I’m fine, there’s nothing to worry about anymore, I’m fine.”
While Tony seriously doubted that it’d be Steve’s first kiss, he knew it’d be
This hadn’t been his choice. But.
He started walking around the lab as he waited for her to come to terms with the news. Maybe he should build another suit. Designing new suits was very calming.
Steve stares down at his phone. Bucky tends to be a lot more blunt than he is, which is saying something, but even he has to realize the absurdity of what he just suggested.
Take, for instance, the nipple clamps. That first night in front of the television, they hadn’t even gotten to Steve admitting all of his fantasies, because Tony had discovered that pinching Steve’s nipples over an extended period of time made him so needy that Steve had broken the ottoman in an attempt to keep from touching himself. Tony had taken advantage of that knowledge frequently ever since. In and of itself, that would’ve been bad enough, but Tony had bought him several pairs of nipple clamps, some plain, but most of them decorated with jewels or chains or even little bows, and he kept telling Steve how gorgeous they made him look, how plump and perfect his nipples were, and it never failed to make him flushed all over, shivering with desire and shame.
Steve didn’t quite yank his hand away, but it was close.
Tony, so it’s basically the same thing.
And why the hell was he in his room? He’d taken to sleeping in a guest room ever since …
There was a long moment where Tony didn’t say or do anything, and then Tony shifted back as he asked, “Do you want me to let you go?” his voice gentle and even, and Steve nearly slumped down in relief at the fact that Tony wasn’t angry.
“Damn you and your tree trunk thighs,” Tony muttered a few seconds later when it didn’t work, said thighs almost framing his face, and seriously, how had he forgotten how homoerotic wrestling was?
think about it, about having to tell Tony every single thing he’d hoped Tony would do to him, about how humiliating it’d be to reveal some of his base desires.
He took a shuddering breath instead, nearly sitting down where he was, exhausted in a way that made no sense for how little he’d actually done, but he couldn’t be weak, refused to do anything that would keep Tony from continuing his punishment. So he stood there instead, taking deep, heaving gasps of air as he flexed and shifted his arms, trying to get rid of the pain while keeping his movements small.
“Tony—”
“I’m sorry, but I’m going to have to touch them again,” Dr. Stark says, and yup, there it is. “More than just touch them, I’m afraid.”
“You want more, Steve?” Tony asked, pushing in a bit further, careful to only go as far as Steve’s body seemed ready for—which wasn’t very far actually; Steve was tight, and the soap had washed off long ago.
“Let’s not do this, Steve.”
Bruce modelled his second jacket and third shirt of the day, which was kind of hilarious since he’d already met Mrs. Kent a couple of times before, but considering Dick was trying out outfit number five, it was totally relatable.
“Sleep is for wimps,” Tony said, handing Steve a blueberry muffin and a cup of chai tea and simultaneously avoiding the question.
Without meaning for them to, his thoughts turned to Tony, about what he’d do if he and Tony were ever in the same situation—
Steve forced away the memories and devoted himself to finding the right angle to make Tony shudder and gasp, to stroking him just the way Tony liked and bringing him so much pleasure that Tony could start to forget all the pain.
Yes, he understood.
Steve took a deep breath and then raised the ottoman. Okay. He could do this. The ottoman wasn’t heavy, but then, this wasn’t about strength. It was about endurance. About what he was willing to endure for Tony. About what Tony had endured for him. Except Tony had had to wait for three days, and Steve just had to wait until Tony told him to stop. That was all.
Inasmuch as Steve had a schedule, he typically spent his mornings with Stark: a late breakfast, and then the two of them talking—or Stark talking at him, and then working out before coming back for another shower and lunch. They’d even gone from spending one hour in the gym together to longer, neither of them keeping track of the time other than Steve counting how frequently Stark would complain that he was either going to be in the best shape of his life or suffer a heart attack from Steve’s exercise regime.
Tony’s voice was amused, but the look on his face let Steve know how affected he was, and it gave him the courage to say, “Aren’t you?” to shift his hips closer, even if he wasn’t quite brave enough to rub against Tony, not yet anyway.
“You put a lot of thought into this.”
“Just what?” Tony asked, his eyes roaming over the canvas of Steve’s upper back, red marks—
He opened his mouth to say, “Hello?” but before he could get it out, he heard, “What are you doing?”
Steve settled against the back of the couch, letting his shoes rest on top of the pristine coffee table as he glanced from the floor-to-ceiling windows that showed a horizon he didn’t recognize, to the screen on the wall that was bigger than the bed he used to sleep in, to the fireplace and chandelier and all the decorations and little touches that reeked of wealth and excess.
When Tony invited all of them to his mansion for a party next to the pool and asked him if he swam, he rubbed his hand over his upper arm, feeling the changes in texture under his shirt, and gave him some weak excuse before walking away.  He’d used to enjoy swimming before his body came to resemble a battlefield, but he was doing everyone a favor by keeping his clothes on.
sorry,” he all but whispers, and Dr. Stark sighs.
Apparently he easily distracted when he’s hungover.
Steve swallowed.  Maybe Tony was right.  There was nothing wrong with being selective after all.
The muzzle was … odd.
Bucky whipped around, not giving himself the time to wonder, because hesitation meant death, and he was sure he was going to see Hydra agents surrounding him--but all he saw was the tail end of a cat, turning onto the sidewalk.
“Alright,” Tony said as he walked back into office, and it was all Steve could do not to shudder in relief. “If you’re going to put on a show for me, then it should be a real show,” Tony said, and he placed a relatively thin vibrator they’d used before on the edge of the ottoman in Steve’s line of sight.
Even if—
“Nick showed me Project Insight, and he said that you’d upgraded the helicarriers. He didn’t say you knew about the project itself, but the way he mentioned it, I just assumed …” He trailed off, looking down, ashamed but unwilling to tell Tony anything but the absolute truth. He should know the complete list of Steve’s sins.
It bothered him almost as much as seeing the blank expression on Tony’s face as Tony closed down and knowing he’d been the one to put it there.  It was the reason he said, “If it turns out that you’re
What was the point in Tony wearing himself down? As an artist, he understood that there were times when the muse was more free with her gifts than others, and he’d spent a few nights up later than he should’ve in his time. But it had always caught up with him, made him sicker than he’d been before, more sluggish and slow. There been things he’d drawn that had seemed so perfect in the wee hours of the morning that he’d later looked at, only to realize the dimensions were off, or the shading was bad, or any number of mistakes that he hadn’t noticed, and then he’d had to spend hours fixing something that would’ve taken only minutes if he’d seen it right away.
Who the hell knew?  He already had a fucking ton of money—earned by himself and
He’d known, of course, about their contract. He’d seen the way they acted around each other, the looks they’d exchanged, the small touches they’d shared. It was obvious how in love they were, and he never would have guessed they’d been through such a traumatic event together. And if whoever had captured them had known who they were, those few hours would’ve been a lot worse than Steve could probably imagine.
“What just happened?” Steve asks as he stares at the black kitten sitting in the spot where Tony used to be.
“I have access to very limited mission data. In your case, I’ve chosen not to read it, and unless I get an alert that something requires my attention, I will continue to not read it.”
I wanted to thank all the people who've commented and left a kudos over the course of this fic so far. I was staring at the the numbers the other day and just thinking, wow. Wow, guys. And I really, really, really appreciate all the support, even though this has been the slowest updated story of all time. You guys keep me going, through when I thought I was leaving fandom, in the middle of moving and having no internet, and struggling through tons of writer's block, and seriously, you guys are the best.
“Oh, for Pete’s—you can’t tell me that you’ve been
But what if it was?
“I know you don’t.” Steve covered his eyes with his hands. “That’s the way you are. You see me hurting, and it matters to you more than the fact that you’re hurting too.”
“But . . . I mean, even if we don’t have a contract, the rules are still in place, aren’t they?” Steve asked, looking worried, and Tony knew how important rules could be, especially for new Subs, so while he hadn’t actually intended to revisit their old rules, he found himself nodding in agreement anyway.
Tony closed his eyes, bracing himself for what was coming, aware that he deserved whatever Steve had to say.
“Um.” Steve looks at the computer, positioned near the end of the bed. Technically, there’s no reason to say no. Dr. Stark’s going to see everything eventually anyway, and it isn’t like Steve’s body-shy. He gets undressed at the gym all the time with no problem, and Dr. Stark wouldn’t actually be
Steve nodded to show he understood, even as he wished he could see.
“And if I find out that you’re lying about why you’re here—”
“Who are you?” Steve asks, wriggling around to pull his end of the sheet up, and
The sound of Tony’s footsteps makes him jump, and Steve almost drops the ring before putting it back on the cleaning cloth. He yells hoarsely, “Be back in a bit!” and leaves the room, the house, and then he runs for miles and miles and tries to come up with a good reason why Tony would have something that Steve now realizes looks an awful lot like a wedding ring.
It was a relief that he hadn’t, of course. It wasn’t as if Steve had
“You’d think so, but he didn’t even know about safewords, Pepper! I told him he should pick a safeword, and he didn’t even realize they could be used non-sexually.” Tony sighed and walked over to the nearest chair, slumping down into it. “And he’s from the damn forties. Submissives’ rights were a joke back then. Is his idea of being able to say no the same as our idea of being able to say no?”
But Steve either knew or suspected, his face drawn into harsh lines that splintered apart in a spasm of grief, and even as he pulled himself together, the jagged seams were all too easy to see.
of being fucked constantly, especially with something the size of the dildo underneath him.
“It’s just … I’m at a point in my life now that I’d like to settle down, maybe start a family, if my partner is interested, and you’re … you know,” Tony said, doing some kind of complicated hand motion, and no, Steve did not know.
to watch. So he had to make sure he did something worth watching.
, Steve thought, wishing he could explain. The muscles in his legs and buttocks flexed helplessly at Tony’s proximity, embarrassing and no doubt obscene, and he found himself moving his finger away before he realized. He’d never have thought that he’d do something like this without any prompting—but knew that he’d do ten times more if Tony wanted him to.
“And I love it,” Tony said, the soft look on his face convincing Steve that he was being truthful.  Tony was a hard man to shop for, and Steve had finally given up trying to buy something one of the world’s wealthiest men didn’t already have.  Instead, he’d painted a picture of the team laughing together based off a photograph Pepper had taken during last year’s Christmas party.  It’d been right before the two of them had started seeing each other, and Tony and Steve had been standing side by side, the expressions on their faces revealing a lot more than either of them had realized at the time.
“Is now really the time for jokes?” Steve asked tiredly.
“When was the last time he slept?” he demanded.
“Did you just—?” Tony started to laugh, his forehead coming to rest against Steve’s thigh, and Steve found himself smiling sheepishly as well, even as he wanted to cover his face in embarrassment. He couldn’t believe he’d done that.
Steve’s steps faltered. What kind of Dom was Tony? The answer was obvious. The more appropriate question was what kind of Sub was he?
They were all quiet as they ate, and Steve couldn’t remember if he’d even enjoyed the shawarma, which turned out to be some kind of roasted meat, although he knew he’d had four helpings.
“If I didn’t—you think I—what are you even talking about?”
The security on the fifth floor was minimal in comparison to the first two floors: one guard at the stair entrance who’d been more asleep than awake and one outside the doors of the lab itself.
“Alright,” he said and went back to staring out the window.
He didn’t know what to say.
But the larger part simply wanted to drown in Tony’s touch, his scent, wanted to soak up every second of contact while he could, because Tony had barely touched him in days, and Steve had missed it more than he’d thought possible.
But then he had.
Dom, to

Because of his–
“Sadly, yes.”

. Close enough for Steve to reach out and grab. Held up like Steve could just ask for it and Tony would—
The flare of heat in Steve’s eyes told him he was, and Tony was going to have to think about ways to test if Steve had an oral fixation while he was gone.
“Yes,” he said, and he had no doubt that Tony could manage without giving any indication of how much it actually hurt. After all, Steve hadn’t suspected anything was wrong until he’d seen the evidence laid out before in angry, horrific lines.
Steve sighed, lowering his pad.  “Tony—”
just get her ass handed to her by Captain America for the fourth time in four days.”
He wanted to believe him.
He shook his head.
“Whatever you want,” Steve murmured, a hint of a smile tugging at his lip, and Tony had to laugh.
“Steve,” Tony said, smiling and looking unbearably fond, and Steve knew he was going to give in.  Of course, he’d known that as soon as Tony had said he had a small favor he wanted to ask Steve.  “You don’t have to.  You can say no, now or later.  Yes, I made it with you in mind—”
But I can’t stop thinking about all the reasons why you didn’t come here when the Compound fell.  Are the two of you lost?  Bruce is able to travel so far when he becomes the Hulk, and I remember him saying he almost never knows where he is when he wakes up.  Is that the reason?  Is one of you hurt?  Not contaminated, not that, but injured maybe?  Are you hungry?  Thirsty?  Are you being hunted?
Also, this is a loose definition of "forced bonding" but whatever, for the "forced bonding" square of my avengers_tables card.
Damn.  Off or not, he had a good smile, wide and adorable like a basket full of puppies, and it made Tony want to clutch at his chest just a little bit.
He also hadn’t known that he could develop an erection when he was in this much pain, but the man is
He speeds up just a little and changes the tempo of his alternating thrusts so there’s overlap now, moments when both hectocotyli are pushing into Steve and not just one, and he can tell Steve likes that, because his breath comes faster every time it happens, and he leaks more fluid around the tentacle in his cock.
“Another blow job,” Tony said promptly, and Steve frowned slightly, confused.
Okay. That isn’t helping.
Warnings: I'm going to put these at the bottom for those who don't want to be spoiled
“T-Tony?” Steve said, and his heart rate had gone up significantly.
Unfortunately, according to the clock on the wall, they’d only been in the gym for about thirty minutes, ten of which had been warming-up and another five, taping their hands, and he’d be damned if he gave up and suggested they switch to weight-lifting or the treadmill without sparring for at least a little longer.
But it was obvious that Steve didn’t believe him, thought Tony was saying it for Steve’s benefit, but not because it was true.
In the meanwhile, if you guys want to read angst that gets resolved quickly (gasp), please give my fic
Even worse, he didn’t have anything of Tony’s. No pictures or keepsakes to mark their time together, because it’d been early days yet, and there would always be time for that later. He didn’t even have a collar, not even that much to show that Tony had cared for him once upon a time.
“Good, then I’m going to get ready for tomorrow.” Tony reached out and trailed his fingers down Steve’s cheek and under his chin, lifting his head slightly, and Steve held his breath and stayed as still as possible until Tony pulled away. “I’ll have JARVIS order something for lunch, so if you’re in the mood for anything in particular, you should let him know.” He looked at Steve for a long moment, eyes seemingly searching for something.
He hadn’t counted on Tony deciding that after being denied Steve’s cock, he’d lick Steve’s ass instead.
“I told you: I wanted to see you. I . . . I miss you, Tony.”
Bruce ran his fingers along the lapel of Clark’s suit, which probably looked pretty flirtatious to an outside observer, but then an outside observer wouldn’t be able to tell how hard Bruce was pressing down.
“Well, it looks like I was worried for nothing. Everything looks good, Steve, and so we can go on to the next part of the examination.”
“Nevermind,” Steve muttered, shaking his head and turning away. “It’s not impor—”
Steve sneaked a glance, and Tony looked … had Tony been that worn down a minute ago? Harsh lines bracketed his mouth, and his eyes were dark and flat. It made Steve dare to turn his head and hesitantly brush his lips against the edge of Tony’s palm, ready to jerk back if Tony didn’t want it.
Steve’s face burned just thinking about it, and he shifted in his chair.
Tony lost his chance to respond when Steve’s expression began to crumple.“I don’t—” He dug the heels of his palms into his eyes, and Tony could see the tremble in his lips when he whispered, “I don’t know how to be good for you, Tony.”
“Steve!”
And then Tony started getting even
Steve’s eyes were huge. But his voice was steady when he said, “Yes.”
“So correct me if I’m wrong, but I’ve gotten the impression that you’re expecting corporal punishment. Actually, you know what? Don’t correct me, because while we’ve never really talked about this, you should know that I prefer not to do that. I can, if the situation requires it, but I don’t like it, and I don’t intend to do it right now.”
want to see you again? I always want to see you.”
“I told you that you wanted to get drunk,” Tony says, smiling.  “I was just the lucky guy sitting next to you in the bar.  You, my friend, can drink tons of alcohol.  Seriously,
He couldn’t even imagine speaking his thoughts aloud—although, of course, now that Tony had suggested it, he couldn’t
Would he be able to be still and just accept it, or would he thrash around, gripping the bed so he didn’t accidentally push Tony away? Or maybe Tony wouldn’t want to take his air away so much as restrict it, putting just enough pressure that he had to struggle for it. How long would he keep Steve on the edge, desperate to beg for release but unable to find the breath for it?
“Did you like it?” Tony asked, his tone curious, his fingers spreading out to Steve’s sides.
So why did he feel so rejected?
(See the end of the chapter for
As if he could erase the past six hours of suffering. As if he had any right to tell Steve to do anything anymore.
“This isn’t a job for a civilian, no matter how much they might want it to be,” he said, frowning when Clint looked like he was going to argue again. “If Tony loses control, I have a better chance of stopping him, and I’ll be able to heal a hell of a lot faster than either of you. It should be me.”
you to do this—”
Decision, decisions.
Or thighs like that. Or a shoulder to waist ratio like that either. Tony would liken him to a piece of art, but while some of the Greek classics came close, he’s really never seen the guy’s body proportions except in porn, so.
“I know,” he said, having to swallow past the lump in his throat to get the words out. And he did. He knew that he couldn’t use his safeword to make Tony forgive him, or keep him, or force him to give him another chance when he’d wasted so many already. “But you said—”
He stared out the window of the helicopter and wondered what had Stark—Tony, he thought, a little curl of shame wriggling its way up his spine. Surely by now, he deserved to be called by his first name.
Steve wouldn’t say that he’d been in love with Tony. He’d admired him a great deal, worried about him, cared for him. He’d betrayed him too, and oddly, it’s the memory of how Tony had looked at him in Siberia that gave him nightmares for a solid few months after Tony’s death. Not that he didn’t find himself remembering Tony in his last moments, lingering on the way his skin had burned and cracked and the vacant shine of his eyes, but it was Siberia that seemed to haunt Steve the most now. All of his regrets piling higher and higher.
“I’m sorry, I was trying to be gentle--”
Steve would’ve done the obvious and checked Tony over. He would’ve seen the marks.
By the fifth time it happens, he’s gone out and gotten a few bottles of Everclear 190 proof. They’re expensive, and the taste is terrible, but if he chugs them, one right after another after another, then for a little while, it gets … not better, no, but maybe quieter? Definitely slower, all his thoughts pausing in their mad rush, and he gets to pretend for a few precious moments that he never saw the look on Tony’s face when he found out Steve had kept the truth from him.
Dear, Anon. Dear, sweet, Anon. I know you asked for fluff, and I think I gave you some, but...I also gave you a hell of a lot of angst that you didn’t ask for, and for that I apologize. I did write bottom!Tony, however, so I hope that helps a little bit.
—that he’d want Steve to not be around.
The noise Tony made was even ruder this time around. “I think someone had a little too much champagne in her mimosa.”
“What’s your safeword?” he asked as he ran the stream of water over Steve, getting rid of whatever remaining soap there might be.
The first call goes straight to voicemail, and no. That’s just Bucky being a shit.
Fuck, Steve was going to be the death of him.
Although if he were thinking about all the things Tony deserved, being addressed by his first name was actually very low on the list.
“Sorry for falling asleep,” Steve said, faltering as Tony got closer and wrapped his arm around Steve’s waist. He had just enough time to think, “Why didn’t I brush my teeth?” before Tony was pressing an open-mouthed kiss to his neck, making his eyes flutter closed.
They meet near the middle of the room, and Steve shakes his hand, letting go quickly and refusing to think about how warm and firm Dr. Stark’s grip had been.
“Sit up now, on your knees,” Tony said, and Steve pushed himself up on unsteady legs, grateful when Tony encouraged him to lean back against his warmth. “You really needed that, didn’t you?” Tony murmured into ear, making Steve shiver, and Tony huffed a little laugh. “Of course you did. Just look at how much you came,” he said, lifting his hand, which was covered in Steve’s release.
Tony waited and waited, but Steve never looked away.
Steve felt his jaw drop a little.
Well, at least he doesn’t need to come anymore, Steve thinks distantly, which isn’t exactly a silver lining, but he’s no longer in danger of poisoning the room further with his stench—
Steve shook his head slowly. What could he say? Any explanation just incriminated him more, emphasizing his lack of faith, and how was he supposed to convince Tony he could change when he failed at every turn?
Nearly a year later, Tony couldn’t remember each of their faces, not after so many deaths.  But this one . . . oh, there was something special about him.
Also! The arm/tank top thing was inspired by this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddgwoz7UUsw
He has absolutely no idea what this means. Besides the obvious.
close; Steve had made sure of it. He couldn’t show just how happy he was that Tony was back, not without confusing nearly everyone in the room, Tony included, and that wasn’t how he wanted to confess. Hell, he didn’t know if he was going to ever admit how he felt. It’d been easy to have feelings for a dead man. But now that Tony was alive ….
It was a dark and stormy night.
“I don’t know about you, but I’m in the mood for just about one of everything on the menu,” Tony said, and that was a good sign, wasn’t it? He had to be doing better if he had an appetite.
He rolled and stared up at the ceiling.
“Go—go slowly,” he gasps once it’s all the way in, and Dr. Stark murmurs something, but Steve can’t focus enough to pay attention.
Tony tensed for a second and then sighed. “Of course you do.” He sat up, and Steve missed his weight as soon as it was gone. “Go shower. I’ll get your stuff.”
He’d already lost everything important after all.
He’d never felt anything like it before—had never responded to anyone else like that before—and he reached out blindly, clinging to Tony to help him through it.
all those years of martial arts training get up and walk out the door in shame.
There was no reply, just another flash of blue, and then nothing.
A shameful and disgusting part of him almost hoped Steve would say no, would get up and leave as Steve was no doubt dying to do, because Tony didn’t want to be hurt anymore, wanted the pain to be over so he could at least start to pretend that he’d eventually heal.
“We did terminate the contract,” Tony said and apparently they had some old business to clear up first before they got down to the real stuff. Fine, it wasn’t like he had anything better to do than relive an extremely painful period of his past.
“I did,” Steve said, and he hadn’t gotten the greeting he’d been hoping for on the plane, but Tony’s disappointment went a long way to making up for it. “You were busy, though, and I didn’t want to disturb you.”
“Tony?

wanted to do to him . . .
“A bet?” Steve tries to pay attention, because he’s honestly interested in the answer, without paying
“I’ve heard that getting naked and cuddling in a sleeping bag together is a great way to stay warm.”
As with everything Tony had ever done, it was a performance, Tony slowly and majestically descending from the heavens in the Iron Man suit, his face uncovered so people could see him with his arms outstretched at his side. The allusion to Jesus Christ couldn’t be more obvious, and Steve thought,
Steve honestly hadn’t thought that admitting how he felt would fix anything.
fault that no one currently needed to know.
at him, and the silence was dragging out, and it was becoming easier and easier to see the hints of resignation appearing on Steve’s face.
He cleared his throat and swallowed again, but his voice was still shredded when he told Tony, “You said if there was something I couldn’t do, I should use it, and I can’t—” leave you, “—walk out that door, knowing that you think I
“But you . . . I didn’t . . .” Steve looked at Tony’s erection, which hadn't gone down as much as he would've liked, but then he hadn't exactly been thinking the purest thoughts, had he?
He tilted his head down so he could look at Fury over the sunglasses.  “You didn’t want me to be part of the Avengers.”
“Basically,” Stark said, his smile turning gentle. “Yeah.”
“Don’t want?” Tony asked, and he could feel the mocking grin settling on his face, as comfortably as any mask he’d worn.
think I meant?” He winked at Steve.
He closes his eyes as Dr. Stark touches him, trying to focus on the reassuring stream of chatter instead of his fingers, the occasional brush against Steve’s nipples, the scrape of his lab coat against his skin. Dr. Stark has always been completely professional, but it doesn’t stop Steve from wishing he wouldn’t be, that he’d rub his perfectly trimmed goatee against Steve’s chest and roll and pinch Steve’s nipples until Steve was crying from frustration.
But Tony still wasn’t looking at him, was typing something at rapid speed, and Steve wasn’t entirely sure that he’d heard what he’d thought he’d heard, but he was completely certain that he wasn’t going to disobey, so after a moment’s hesitation, he did what Tony wanted.
“You know, Steve, I … ” Tony was quiet for a second, and Steve was all too aware of the changing floor numbers out of the corner of his eye. “Now that I’m actually here, I think I might’ve been a bit ambitious when I suggested having breakfast downstairs. What do you think about getting our food and taking it back up? Or just having it delivered? Would you mind?” Tony asked, giving him an out, no matter that it was phrased as a request, and Steve hated it, didn’t want it, wished that Tony would ignore everything else and just
He’d been planning to ask Tony on a date. But wouldn’t this be better? Wouldn’t this convey his intentions as clear as he could make them?
Steve wasn’t sure what to expect when he got to the penthouse. After yesterday . . .
Dear Tony,
known after all.
Steve smiled involuntarily and let himself move past the mention of his previous relationship. “Knowing how many times I can orgasm in twelve hours is important?”
“Really?” Steve said, his tone oh so dry, but there was definite uptick in his pulse rate.
“Good morning,” Tony said softly, and Steve met his eyes without meaning to. “Hey, so, depending on how you feel, I was thinking we might go to the coffee shop downstairs and get some deserts masquerading as breakfast food. What do you think? We’ve been cooped up in here for so long; it might be nice to stretch our legs a bit, get some fresh air.”

“Which parts, Steve?” he bursts out, and he doesn’t mean to, he wasn’t going to get into this.  Tony knows that he shouldn’t be angry, or at the very least, he shouldn’t be
What?
Tony didn’t seem to expect a response, not that Steve would’ve been able to give him one as Tony’s fingers started moving faster, the pleasure turning more intense and deliberate.
He turns both vibrators up to full speed and barely gets his hand on Steve’s cock before Steve’s coming, his voice all but broken. Tony has to brace himself so that Steve doesn’t knock them to the ground as all his weight comes to rest on Tony, but he doesn’t mind.
After all this time, Tony is intimately aware of what Steve smells like when he’s aroused, and apparently while Steve’s eyes were shut, Tony had leaned forward close enough to catch his scent over the pervading aroma of coffee.
He needed to get out of there. It had taken him years to realize just how destructive his inner voices could be, and if he wanted a chance in hell of being able to
“Oh, you must be hungry!” Tony said, extricating himself, and he ignored how empty his arms felt now that they weren’t holding Steve anymore. “Let’s see what’s in the kitchen.”

And Steve sighs, lowering the foot that had been raised to climb the ladder up to the helicopter.  It's not like Tony telling him to do it should change anything; they'd just finished foiling the enemy, everyone else is already seated, and he'd been all set to go aboard, but now that Tony's making an issue of it, Steve can't let it go.  He frowns at Tony, but the suit's faceplate is down, so who knows if it has any effect on him?
meant it. He frowned at him.
A second later, Tony has to remember to pump his tentacles in order to keep from sinking under the water line, fucking hell.
He didn’t know why the realization shook him so much, but it did. He’d never questioned why Stark gave him free reign of the Tower, including his lab that housed important company secrets; why Tony put himself in the position of being taken down during their daily matches and never complained about the inevitable bruising or suggested that Steve had done more damage than necessary. He’d always known that he could be trusted, and he’d taken it for granted that Tony would know it too.
This wasn’t a collar Steve had earned.
He doesn’t mean to squeeze down on Dr. Stark’s finger, but what else is he supposed to do? Dr. Stark is
“I believe you,” Steve said quietly, too late and to an empty room, but promising himself that this time, it’d be true.
“No, Steve—”
The straps had been impersonal, just material sliding over his skin, hooking into the other side and tightening automatically. Tony had been close as he’d latched them in, but there hadn’t been any contact. For the band around his waist, however, Tony’s hand reached around from him and smoothed it against his stomach, and Steve had wanted Tony to touch him, did want it, didn’t think there’d ever be a time he wouldn’t.
It was unfair, Steve knew. Tony had never so much as hinted that he was unhappy with their sex life, even though all they’d done so far was use their hands and rubs against each other. Well, that and twice now, Tony had gone down on him.
He sighed and pushed himself, climbing out of the bed and making his way to his bathroom. He turned on the light and squinted until his eyes had adjusted.
His heart seemed to spasm suddenly, before starting up again with a lurch.
This is a very short chapter, I know, but look how fast I posted it! >_>
“Tony—”
“I … I’m
And Tony can’t disagree. “My soulmate,” he whispers back, and he’s not actually sure what that means, but it’s a promise anyway.
“Goodnight,Tony,” Steve said somberly, and that was that.
“But . . . but what does that have to do with me?” he asked plaintively while thinking,
another blow job; I’m giving you the chance to give
He definitely hadn’t expected him to look calm, relaxed almost, a tightness gone from around his eyes and mouth.

you to safeword if you need to. I won’t be angry or disappointed. We’ll just change things around before finishing your punishment, alright?”
“I’m so sorry,” he said, placing his hand over hers.
“There’s not much to do here,” Steve said a trifle meanly, and it was both true and not, but he was rattled from what he’d learned and how he’d learned it, and he hadn’t expected Stark to be waiting for him.
“Floral, Steve?
It’s cold and strange, not quite uncomfortable but far from pleasant, and it causes Steve’s hips to lift up and elicits a shuddery moan that makes him want to die a little bit and shove further down a whole lot more.
He didn’t know why, but he’d assumed it’d be over with quickly, that a wolf would try to come as soon as it could in the wild. But Tony didn’t stop, he didn’t stop, and he didn’t stop, and Steve couldn’t say when he started moaning from the large cock roughly hammering into him, but he knew he was getting louder and louder. Tony kept rubbing against his prostate with each thrust, the feeling much more intense than it’d ever been with the handful of partners who’d fucked him before. He wondered if it was because of how thick Tony was, or if the bone inside just made it that much more noticeable, but it felt like Tony never missed, and the wide stretch of his hole combined with the sharp, almost punishing jolts of pleasure were making him lightheaded.
She patted him. “It was a long time ago.”

forehead.
The possibility that Tony might make him wait until he had no choice but to fail slithered through his mind for a second, and he immediately felt disgusted with himself, his stomach twisting. What was wrong with him? Tony hadn’t asked him to do anything he couldn’t handle yet, had

“I’m sorry for interrupting you,” he blurted out, belatedly realizing that Tony could interpret his actions differently than he’d meant them. There was a pinched look around Tony’s eyes that Steve didn’t know if he should attribute to the past few days or to his most recent actions, but either way, he hated the fact that it was there. “I wanted to hear what you—I

-----
He would’ve liked to blame it on the dream, wished that being unsettled from thinking about Stark in that way, from calling him by his first name and imagining himself submit to Stark were valid excuses for his behavior, but they weren’t. None of the events from the previous day, from the visit to SHIELD to what had happened after he’d woken up, should’ve affected how he reacted to Stark’s suggestion.
“I don’t have a look!” she said. She coughed. “But if I did—”
was what Tony wanted him to wear?
“Well, Steve, there’s a reason I’m avoiding ole Nick, and no matter how much I enjoy these,” he said, shaking his hand so the chain connecting them jingled, “and let me tell you that I’m enjoying them
“Fine.”
,” he said, pleaded almost, and he couldn’t believe Steve was trying to argue with him about who should apologize more—actually he could totally believe it. He just couldn’t deal with it at the moment. He was hanging on to his composure by the skin of his teeth as it was, and if they started fighting again, even about something like this, he didn’t know how he’d handle it.
“—ve you and I … believe me … acted like we … I do, Tony,” Steve said, eyes still cracked with red and wet streaks drying on his skin, and Tony desperately wanted to know what he was saying, but he couldn’t concentrate, couldn’t—
So Tony had convinced himself he’d imagined it, and except for the rest of that day when Steve had been distant and cautious around him, they’d gone back to acting the same way they’d been before, walking slightly out of step while they figured out how to dull the jagged edges between them.
No. He wasn’t going to think about it.
Tony per se—they’re not dating or anything—but it’s
Apparently, it didn’t fool Steve, because he blushed, red spreading across his face in a steady wave, and Tony had to give it to him: embarrassed or not, Steve didn’t back down.
“Did you come?”
He does not.
“What flirting?” There hadn’t been any flirting!
Steve’s voice was ragged as he said, “You deserve someone better—”
Steve did as instructed. Whatever happened, he’d brought it upon himself and Tony was giving him a chance to make up for everything he’d done. No one had ever died of embarrassment, and Tony was going to be there the whole time. He was going to be fine.
“Oh, Steve, what have I told you before? You never need to apologize for wanting me,” Tony said, a pang running through him. “Now c’mon.” He reached around, fingers brushing Steve’s cock, not surprised when he found him still hard. Steve had always had a ridiculously fast recovery time.
“Do you want my mouth?” Tony asked, his voice gone low and gravelly, and he wanted Steve to say yes, could almost taste him on his tongue already.  He rubbed his thumb over the head of Steve’s cock, eliciting another of those gorgeous sounds from Steve, and said, “I could lick all the come away and then take you into my throat, let you fuck my—”
He swallowed. “As simple as that?”
Word count: 900
By the expression on her face, Nurse Sara probably thought Stark was being rude, and a few days ago, Steve might have even agreed, even as he railed against having Stark there. Now, however, he saw it for what it was: Stark was trying to give him what privacy he could.

But in reality, he hadn’t done anything to
“Honor,” Steve whispered, his hips rolling into the mattress, and Tony could see the goosebumps rising on his skin.

“Is it alright if I touch them again?”
“Don’t worry about it.” Dr. Stark smiles reassuringly, but his eyes dart downward before coming back up to meet Steve’s. “It’s a common reaction.”

Steve took off for the tree line, ignoring the voice in his head that wanted to tell Tony he didn’t need a head start. It was a remnant from the days when he’d stand his ground, no matter the odds against him, and it wasn’t necessary here. This was just training, and there was no reason he shouldn’t use the time. Tony’d be able to take him down fast according to their rules if he stood around in the meadow, and that wasn’t what Steve wanted. He wanted Tony to have to fight for it.
discipline, I was thinking of something else. Remember when I told you I’d help you be good?”
“Th-these are yours?” he asks, hoping against hope that Dr. Stark was storing someone else’s blankets for them. Dr. Stark nods oh-so-helpfully, however, and Steve wouldn’t have said he was even
Maybe … maybe Tony isn’t really that interested in him?
Yes, Steve was humiliated and anxious and there was a part of him that wanted to take Tony’s offer for a different punishment ... but he couldn’t imagine telling Tony he wouldn’t accept whatever he had in store for him. He might as well walk out the door right now, which was something he adamantly refused to do.
popped into his head again, and maybe it was a good thing Tony couldn’t see his face, he thought, his cheeks flaming. Although if Tony were looking at his cock, he’d know he was thinking of something.
I won’t apologize for volunteering, but I am sorry that I left you.
—better, not-not
“Promise me.” He lifted his chin as Tony placed biting kisses against his neck, little shivers traveling down his back. “You can’t leave me like that again, Tony,” he begged, his voice breaking as he remembered burnt and jagged wounds, and he knew that Tony couldn’t guarantee his safety, knew he couldn’t either, but he didn’t want to hear reason from Tony right now. He needed the blind assurance that he would always have Tony with him, so he didn’t give him a chance to respond, just drew Tony’s head up so he could kiss him again and swept him up in his arms.
I can’t believe I just wrote that, but since crossing it out will make the words even more obvious and since I don’t have an eraser of any kind, I guess I’ll leave it there.
“I’m not saying you have to do anything too intense. A little scene here and there can go a long way. It doesn’t even have to be sexual,” she said, although her expression turned slightly dubious; she knew from experience how Tony got during play. “It’s just that from everything you've told me, Tony, the last thing—the very
“Which one was it, Steve?” Tony asked, letting his teeth graze taut skin, nipping gently, and Steve jerked like he’d been electrocuted.

“What?” Steve whispered, and Tony had never seen his face so pale.
“If you’re sure … ?”

, virtually throwing his pheromones around, his body doing everything it can to entice Dr. Stark and screaming “receptive” and “fertile” in the basest, most conspicuous way possible. If Dr. Stark were a lesser man, Steve would be getting fucked to within an inch of life by an alpha in full rut.
There’s no one else in the room, no one else in the entire office in all likelihood, and even if there were, it’s not like Dr. Stark is shouting or even using a loud voice. But it’s still shocking to hear him discuss Steve’s condition in a public space.
Stark had been quiet all day. After hours of dealing with the man grunting or talking in monosyllables instead of running at the mouth like he’d gotten used to, Steve was getting uneasy.
“So should you,” Tony said, even as he gently brushed Steve’s bangs away from his forehead, sliding his hand through his hair.
No, Bruce had been in full-costume, and Dick had been in full-costume, and they’d been working on something important, and Dick still hadn’t been able to stop himself from fanboying all over Superman and embarrassing not only himself and all his descendants to come with his hero worship.
He doubted it, though.
Damn, he was getting a headache just thinking about it.
“Hmm, what’s that?” Tony asked as he pulled his shirt up over his head. “You want to use both hands? Be my guest,” he said, walking over a few steps to one of the strategically located bottles of lube. He tossed it to Steve, who caught it easily.
“Impossible,” he said again but found himself looking into the observation room where Steve and Joe (“My father’s name was Joseph,” Steve had said as he’d stared down at the kid.  “Yeah, I
was okay,” and Steve writhed inside, could only imagine how humiliating that must have been for a Dom, how desperate Tony must have felt to do it, “and still, nothing from you. And then you show up on my doorstep without so much as a text! You say you don’t want to leave, but you’ve made it more than clear how you really feel, so yes, I’m easing the way for you. Here are your things. Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.”
“Steve, it matters that you’re trying to fix things with me. That you didn’t give up on us. You know that, right?”
“Do you want to go ahead and set up your next appointment, Steve?” she asks, and he opens his mouth to automatically agree—
Steve lets out a embarrassingly eager noise when Tony climbs on top of him, but what does it matter when he abandoned his pride in regards to Tony a long time ago, and he wraps his legs around him, pulling him down so he can grind his cock against Tony’s thigh.
Considering this was Steve’s first time, however, it’d be cruel to deny him any longer.
—directions. He had to remember that
If he masturbated now, it’d help him fall asleep, which meant he’d be in better shape when he saw Tony. Plus, he could get it out of his system and spend the plane ride figuring out his next steps. Wouldn’t that be a better use of his time?
Steve could feel his eyebrows do something strange, but he honestly had no idea how to respond to that, so he answered Tony’s question intead. “I, um, got back a few hours ago.”
him—oh fuck.
“Good, then your punishment is going to be you acting as my puppy for the next three days.” Tony squeezed his hands, and Steve felt pitifully grateful for it. “Let me explain what that means exactly.”
Not that anyone had ever accused Tony of being nice but still.

Steve kept waiting for the alarm to sound, but apparently, neither they nor the guards they’d taken down had been missed yet.  Stark was able to keep them away from the main tunnels, and Steve took care of the few guards they did encounter, allowing him to arm himself in the process.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologized, his hand gripping his doorknob tightly.  “I was just . . .”  He trailed off, having no idea how to finish that sentence.  “But yes, you can borrow a flashlight and some candles if you’d like.  Or, or you could even just stay over here until the power kicks back on.  I don’t mind,” Steve said, not wanting him to go.  “I even have some left-over pizza if you’d like.”
“So instead you stoke the fires of alien body snatchers and/or necromancers, the Second Coming, government conspiracies, and that’s just what’s trending at the moment. Who knows what other theories they’ll have in a few more hours?” She sighed and rubbed her forehead. “You never make it easy for me, do you, Stark?”
He stroked the line of Steve’s jaw with the knuckles of his hand, followed the curve of his cheek, up and then down. He noticed the faint flush that was starting to spread across Steve’s face but didn’t call attention to it, just said, “You’re gorgeous,” and traced Steve’s bottom lip with his thumb.

“Okay,” he said finally, pushing his fingers through his hair. “Okay.”
“He’s a grown man, Tony; he knows he can say no.”
“Welcome to Jackson, Steve!” he said to cover his reaction, which no matter his gift for gab, he wouldn’t have been able to explain for the life of him.  “I’m guessing you’ve already seen most of the sights, but in case you haven’t, don’t blink as you’re walking down Main, otherwise you’ll miss all that the town has to offer.  There’s a diner about four blocks south of here that I’d personally recommend if you’re in the mood for burnt coffee and excellent chocolate cake.  It’s nothing fancy, and do

Also, I came to realization that I played myself. I shot myself in the fucking foot, because I thought, angst, more angst, last bit of angst, and then resolution, and then it’s over, right? Maybe some porny epilogues, but that’s it. BUT I FORGOT ABOUT THE HEALING. I FORGOT ABOUT HOW LONG THE HEALING PROCESS IS. WE’RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING FINISHED YET BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN RESOLUTION, WHY, WHY????? FML. FMLLLLLLLLLL.
Steve sighed, knowing he wasn’t going to get any more sleep. He rubbed grainy eyes and then rolled out of bed in order to pack what few things he’d left out the night before.
He explained the whole situation, from the request for a meeting to the bait-and-switch, and finally said, “It’s

It should’ve been enough for him, having Tony depend on him, getting all those little bits and pieces of Tony that no one else ever got to see.  And in many ways it was, because Steve valued their friendship so much, he would never have done anything to jeopardize it.
ETA: This is now a complete story. You can read it
He took a slow, deep breath.
“You want a guarantee; you have it.” Fury inclined his head at him, and maybe it was Tony’s imagination, but he seemed much more animated than he had when they’d first started this conversation. Not that Fury was ever really brimming with emotions or anything other than weary scorn, but still. Relatively.
Are you still mad at me?
“Gorgeous,” Tony crooned.  “I wish I could keep you like this forever, round and sweet.  You’d like that, wouldn’t you, Steve?” he asked, his hand picking up speed on Steve’s cock, his other hand moving to his nipples, pinching and rolling one and then the other as Steve whimpered.  “These would get full and swollen; you’d be so sensitive.  I’d take such good care of you, Steve.  I swear I would.”
Beautiful.
once Tony’s gotten him mostly out of the water and warmed up.
"Can't you tell?" he asked, adding in an extra groan for effect.
Tony cleared his throat. “I’m sure you’re hoping we start your discipline right away, but I’d like the chance to think it over and decide what the most appropriate punishment would be. Will you be alright if we wait until tomorrow?”
But that was for later, because he could almost hear the tick of the clock in his head, so he slowly drew his hand down, lightly pulling at Steve’s lip as he leaned forward, and he returned the favor, licking once against plump skin before tilting his head to join their mouths together.
But Steve had no intention to say anything of the kind, and he let out a long sigh as Tony began to nuzzle his stomach. It was almost ticklish as Tony kept the touch light, but it also felt good, all that heat and the promise of weight behind it. It felt even better when Tony pushed the T-shirt he’d borrowed from Dr. Strange aside.
“Of course, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS said, and then it was blessedly quiet.
Steve told himself he wouldn’t look, and he didn’t for the first five minutes. Ten. Twenty.
At this point, it just seemed like something he had to be good enough for, something he had to earn, a reward, he supposed, and while Tony had fucked him with his fingers, his tongue, had even brought out a few toys that made Steve rub his thighs together in remembrance, Tony still hadn’t gone all the way.

“When you told me you wanted to get drunk, I didn’t realize how determined you were, but wow.  When you go for something, you really go for it, don’t you?” the guy asks, brown eyes crinkling as he smiles, and Steve realizes to his dismay that the reason he’s feeling so poorly is that he’s suffering from the worst hangover he’s ever experienced.  Apparently, he had somehow gotten drunk last night.  He hadn’t known that was possible.
So instead he asked, “What are you in the mood to drink?” and headed for the bar, because even if Steve didn’t want one, he sure as hell planned on having something.
Okay, so this is all hand-wavey law, so be warned.
, he told himself sternly when his cock just got that much harder, and he got up to find his clothes and finally get dressed. Or maybe not, he thought, remembering Tony’s comment about milking, and shit, was he going to get goosebumps every time he thought about it from now on? He’d gone from never considering it to basically counting the seconds until it happened, and he really, really needed to stop. Later was later, and hopefully, Tony would want to do . . . something. And if not, well, Steve apparently was looking forward to that too. But whatever Tony wanted, Steve did have one request of his own.
There’d always been something about Tony that got to him.  The first time they’d met had been at Pepper’s birthday party, Tony stumbling in as most people were getting ready to leave.  Steve had thought he’d been drunk from the way he was acting and had pulled him aside, telling him off for being rude and obnoxious on Pepper’s special day.
Ever since Tony had burst into the room, he’d been fighting the impulse to touch Steve—what if he didn’t want it? What if he didn’t want it but let Tony do it anyway? He still wasn’t sure it was the right move, but knowing how much Steve was hurting, he couldn’t
“Alright, so why don’t you take a look around and then let’s talk punishment,” Tony said as he and Steve walked into the house they’d be staying in for the next few days. Tony had been very secretive after coming back out of his study the previous day, just warning Steve that the penthouse wasn’t equipped for what he’d planned and that they’d be flying to a property he owned upstate.
“Hello?” he calls out, barely a foot inside in case he is actually too late and they’re in the middle of shutting everything down.
“What the—”
“Stop, oh, fuck, stop!” Steve gasped, hunching forward, and it wasn’t his safeword, so Tony just followed with his fingers, rubbing against Steve’s prostate even faster. “I’m going to come, please—”
“Too much for one night?” he asked, solicitous.
He didn’t think about anything. He didn’t.
“Why didn’t you get yourself off why you were blowing me?” Tony asked, and Steve licked his lips nervously.
Just to freeze in the doorway. What is—
Steve knew that Dr. Strange kept talking, but he couldn’t hear it over the static in his ears. He and Tony were together now, and Steve was quite happy with their love life, more than happy as a matter of fact. Tony was an inventive and attentive partner, and he threw himself into sex with the same passion he showed everything he loved.
(See the end of the chapter for

What?
He just wanted a chance to breathe without the weight of it all on his chest.
Although why none of their other enemies hadn’t been able to—
“You have a call from Major Hill, Mr. Stark,” JARVIS said, and Steve nearly fell off the ottoman as he flinched, yanking the vibrator free out of some insane desire to not be caught by anyone—barely managing to keep his head down before realizing it was just JARVIS.
The crinkles around Tony’s eyes have no right to be half as endearing as they are. “Don’t worry about it; I know it’s what you’re used to.”
And that’s when the thought hits him that …
“I’m sorry I didn’t offer these to you before, but I only just remembered I had them in my cabinet. They’ve been sitting in there for weeks, so they shouldn’t smell much, if at all. Are they all right?” Dr. Stark asks, causing Steve to freeze—and how had he not noticed he was nuzzling his face in the fabric, what the fuck—and stare up at him.
older than he is—then the team can humor him until they figure out a way to get him back to his own universe.
He frequently found himself up at all hours of the night, and he took to running to make the time pass faster, finding the heavy thud of his feet on pavement thankfully mind-numbing. He probably should’ve tried to sleep more than he did, but it made him jittery to lie there with only his thoughts to keep him company, and he always ended up giving up sooner rather than later.
buy him because they are ugly, like seriously ugly, and really, that's what Steve buys with his own money?  He looks like an overgrown puppy, staring at Tony with big, soulful eyes and a downcast expression and damn it.
But Tony feels … amazing. The scratch of his beard, the softness of his lips, the way his hand eventually comes up to first cup Steve’s jaw and then drag back into his hair, Steve’s imagined all of it, time and time again, but it’s always been hazy in the past. (Quick too, if he’s being honest, a prelude to fantasies about unforgiving fingers and a thick cock, and he is ashamed of himself, okay, but considering how his interactions with Tony normally go, he thinks it’s understandable.)
“Because we were both willing to ignore it.” He gave the bottle a swirl before tipping it back for another mouthful. He wiped his lips with the sleeve of his shirt. “Because the alternative was what you were trying to avoid in the first place,” he said, and it was a sharp reminder that Steve might be a card-carrying member of SHIELD now, but there’d been a time when they’d done what they could to throw him to the wolves—even if the wolf, in this case, had been Tony.
“Yeah, about that,” Stark said. “How would you feel about going out with me tonight?”
And Steve had walked away.
Tony—so damn much. And if this got him closer to having him back, it’d be worth it. If Tony forgave him, even a little, it’d be worth anything.

He sighed and rubbed his jaw, staring at the closed elevator doors.
He felt Steve go rigid underneath him.
“Are . . . I see,” Steve said, not sounding like he saw at all, and thank fuck. Tony could deal with confusion. Tony could happily deal with confusion all day.
But the thought that Steve was suffering because of something Tony had done, that Tony was the cause but he couldn’t do anything to solve it, couldn’t
He sits down gingerly, the paper crinkling underneath him, and he makes sure the robe is loose around him so he won’t have to move it for the first part of the exam. Then he tucks the sheet around his waist firmly and waits, determinedly refusing to look at the tray of sterilized tools off to the side and trying not to think about how he’s dripping onto the table, about the pool of wetness he’ll find and futilely try to mop up later. It’s worse than his erection, even though they’re both proof of how much his body likes what’s happening, but at least he can tell himself he gets hard all the time; he can’t lie that the leaking is normal.
