‘What the fuck did you just say?’
Tony nods. ‘Just this once we have to. If Ross is mixed up with HYDRA…’
‘We could put on an Avengers dance show,’ Wanda grins, ‘and have Steve in the lead.’
‘Yeah that spread like wildfire,’ the man chuckles, ‘and something is telling me that you’re about to say things are more serious than you led the others to believe.’
‘I’m sorry, I know,’ she says, pulling away and drying her eyes, trying to slip on her pristine mask once more. ‘I just- he’s been worse than when he got back from Afghanistan, Rhodey, and I’ve not been able to help him. I’ve not been able to
‘We will find them,’ Bucky joins them, the rest of the soldiers now having been dealt with, ‘I swear to you, T’Challa, we’ll find them and avenge Nakia. I’ll personally march the ones responsible into your throne room.’
‘Really?’ he looks at her in surprise.
She looks over at Nebula. ‘Think you can watch the kid while I sort out Hulk?’
‘Hey,’ he’s finally reached her and he takes her shaking hand in his, holding it between his flesh and metal hand, ‘don’t start panicking yet, Wanda. It could just be a side effect from the knockout gas. Maybe it just needs a little more time to get out your system before you can use it again?’
Tony shakes his head. ‘That’s what some of the calls are I need to make. Just- just trust me on this ok? The less anyone else knows the more you can deny if it goes wrong.’
‘Because I don’t think Nebula is going to rely on only one option to getting Gamora back,’ Clint cuts off Quill’s response. ‘So she’s more likely to be careful with it. Plus I’ve seen her in action. I think she’d be able to take Nat out, and that frankly terrifies me.’
‘So if I started explaining one now I’d get another kiss?’
‘What?’ Steve isn’t even sure what he’s asking as he walks towards the picture of Piotr Maximoff, wearing the blue uniform he’d worn on their mission to Sokovia. Underneath is a plaque that states:
going to be that patient,’ he mumbles into Steve’s shoulder. ‘We’ll be up soon. Go wake up Bucky.’
Loki holds up a hand as he feels a familiar sensation at the back of his mind. –
‘That’s a joke right? Of course I love it,’ he says, giving his boyfriend a kiss. Yes ok Tony was more than capable of buying himself a racetrack for a day, but the fact that Steve had thought to find one that had all of the vehicles Tony would definitely like to try out, and given him enough tickets to take others to race against made it so much more special. Especially since he wasn’t that keen on Tony actually racing. Not after he’d seen the footage from the Vanko incident and had remembered just how vulnerable Tony could be outside of the suit.
Loki grins. ‘No I actually enjoyed that part, just don’t tell Thor or he’ll renege on our deal. Though I suppose part of that enjoyment came from spending time with people away from the Warriors with no risk of Thor feeling I was avoiding him. No it was celebrations like the hunt that I didn’t enjoy but Thor would insist I had to join in. I much preferred spending time with Mother preparing the entertainment because we could work together using our magic to create more and more elaborate creations each year.’
Peter pauses, then reaches into his jeans pocket and passes the man a small disk with his Spider-Man emblem on it. ‘I told you. I’ve come here from a mutual friend. I just want to know what’s happened to Deadpool seeing as he hasn’t contacted m- my friend in nearly a week.’
‘Can you show me some of the artefacts later?’ Peter asks.
‘Ready to comply,’ comes the monotone voice that has Steve’s heart sinking through his boots.
‘Fury?’
When there’s no more arguing from the others Tony feels himself relax slightly and removes his fist from the wall.
‘Chop the tree not your leg this time,’ Bucky suggests.
‘Yeah but if you wanted to do that we’d be down in my workshop with mugs of coffee,’ he points out, standing up and raising an eyebrow. ‘You only
‘We’re staying,’ Bucky’s voice is slightly on edge.
‘Well…not exactly, but-’
‘Well when you said you’d be going ice skating,’ Strange’s voice comes from behind them, and they turn to see the wizard walking through a portal, ‘I didn’t expect it would be quite
‘I’m not sure that sounds any better to be honest,’ he sighs in defeat. ‘Is
‘Loki won the fight,’ Tony explains. ‘He’s the king of Jotunheim.’
‘My money’s on Mantis,’ Tony says, ‘she’s definitely not been around alcohol before and she’ll feed off everyone else; either that or Rocket or Groot simply based on body mass.’
‘Spoilsport,’ the man grumbles.
‘Can I get a coffee this time at least?’ Bucky grins.
He tries not to grin as Peter freezes and looks up warily at him. ‘Well, uh, you see the thing is…’ he runs a hand through his hair, looking everywhere around the workshop but at Tony. ‘It’s not a girl.’
‘Ah,’ Tony looks to where Wade has just walked into the room and realises he may have forgotten to mention to Clint about their extra visitor.
Loki blinks at him a couple of times before responding. ‘Are you going to let me finish before interrupting me this time?’
A low groan comes from the super soldier. ‘They are really not as friendly as they pretended to be.’ He manages to push himself onto his back and Wanda tries to bite back on the whimper that escapes at the sight of his bloodied face.
‘No promises,’ Wade grins.
‘You’re the Spider-Man right?’ the man’s head tilts to one side, as if he’s looking towards Peter but not at the same time. ‘You’re supposed to be protecting this city but you let a madman like him run around?’
‘What-’ she turns and cuts off Steve’s remark with a glare.
‘He means get lost, Squidward!’
‘And I bet you’ll be paying for it all.’
‘I’m here, Tony,’ he tries his best to comfort the man. ‘We’re all here. We’re getting you out.’
‘Whatever you say, kid, now give it your best shot.’
A/N: Hey everyone! Sorry the update is a little late this week but I hope you enjoy it. Thank you to everyone who has left comments (I will reply soon I promise!), kudos and to everyone who is still sticking with this story.
Oh and Tony’s been avoiding him tonight like he has been the majority of the week, so no emotional support there.
‘And you’ll stay here?’
Tony gives a small laugh and Steve gets butterflies in his stomach. What is wrong with him? He never gets hooked on people this quickly. ‘I would say I’m glad to hear it, but I’m not sure I should be happy at your physical injuries.’
‘What do you mean?’ Panic seizes Tony’s heart. ‘Pete what’s happened?’
‘Seems like Peter’s number one fan got her knitting circle to help with making the whole team a batch of Christmas sweaters,’ at his questioning frown she rolls her eyes. ‘Senora Valdez, that Pete sees most weeks?’
‘Peace, Barton, I do not expect an apology.’
‘Err… no, nothing that I can think of. Except you know what I was saying about the Decathlon team anyway. Well unless you want to hear about the new exchange programme they’re starting up? There’s a whole bunch of rumours that since Wakanda is opening its borders that we might actually have some kids from there on the exchange programme, but I think that’s just a lot of wishful thinking to be honest. I mean not that it wouldn’t be awesome to go to Wakanda and -‘
Love always,
‘What you planning?’ Tony asks. ‘Tell me how much time you need.’
quickly? You must be one hell of a kisser!’
Tony groans. ‘I don’t know why that kid is so fond of that lawyer,’ they watch as Peter greets Matt and then takes him over to where Loki, Ned and MJ are standing. ‘I’m worried about him though.’
Thor, Loki and Valkyrie arrive to begin the Yule celebrations; Peter finds out how Wade's been getting the Christmas sweaters sorted; and Bucky and Loki have a revealing conversation.
‘Think we can last that long?’ Rhodey asks, looking out towards the army. ‘They look ready to attack any moment.’
‘Like he could,’ Bucky scoffs, though the effect is lost as it’s muffled in Steve’s stomach. ‘Alright let me go you punk!’ When he’s let go he rubs his neck and looks at Steve. ‘You seriously telling me you’re okay with this?’
‘Because you can make us all laugh even when it shouldn’t be possible; because you brought us all back together, and without you I’m not sure how long it’d be before we fell apart. Tony, when we realised you’d been taken the whole team turned to me for what to do, and you want to know what my reaction was? I wanted to turn to
Dodging past tall, well-built people, Peter makes his way to the bar; behind are two men, both are around the same height as him, one looks to be of Indian heritage, and the other has a mop of light coloured hair and glasses.
he thinks,
‘I’m paying anyway, let me get what I want. Besides Steve isn’t here to give me his disappointed eyes when he sees me drinking more than he thinks is good.’
‘Could you actually have broken my ribs?’ Harry frowns, looking down at his chest.
Gamora smiles at her wryly. ‘Thanks. But what’s this of Nova being destroyed? We were the ones to defeat Ronan and give the Power stone to them to keep safe, we hadn’t heard anything about them being attacked.’
‘Is this a good time for me to arrive?’ Pepper laughs as she joins them, taking the last available seat.
The boy looks like all of his Christmases have come at once. ‘Yes please Mr Falcon sir.’
thinking!’
Wade’s reply is cut off by the door opening to reveal a frowning Wanda. ‘Peter if you’re back here doing things you
‘Hmm,’ Dr Hill gives him an assessing look, ‘you’re off all school activities this afternoon. Rest up,
‘Yes, we contact the performers ahead of time to find out which carols they’re singing so we can print the words for the residents to join in with if they want,’ she replies, ‘I just wish they’d told us the nights they wouldn’t be here. Sorry I better go speak to the other staff members.’
‘Captain
‘You still with me, Tony? Afghanistan was ten years ago, now. Do you remember making Yinsinium? Changing the arc reactor?’ At those words he panics, looking down at his chest and trying to get his arms free from Steve. Natasha takes his face in her hands again and gets him to look into her green eyes. ‘Tony the arc reactor’s gone. You healed yourself remember? It’s not in your chest anymore, you don’t need it. You’re safe. You’re with us, at the facility.’
Before I can get to my feet they’re gone, Vanessa already morphing into someone else.
‘Bucky what are you doing?’ Sam shouts as he and Peter leap to their feet from where they’ve been sitting on the couches.
‘Oh my god shut up!’ Peter laughs, shoving against Wade’s chest and letting the merc lead him over to where Quill and Thor are currently arm wrestling.
Sam cuts the tape holding the box closed and they open the top to reveal the contents. ‘Is this? Have we been sent
‘You should not have tried to get in my way,’ comes the reply.
‘We’ll have to make it worth it,’ she says, turning to the rest of the team.
‘Missed you too,’ Wade says when he pulls away. ‘I wasn’t sure if…I wasn’t sure whether you’d be happy to see me when you got back.’
‘What?’ Before he can process what Clint has said the archer points above his head, then darts in and presses a quick kiss to his lips. Loki barks out a laugh. ‘You tricked me, Barton, I’m impressed.’
Where are they going? Bucky wonders.
‘Rogers!’
Bucky laughs.
. Weasel called me with a last minute assignment and by the time I had chance to call my phone was dead and I hadn’t packed my charger. I know: I’m a fucking moron. I’m sorry.’
‘No, Steve, I’ve already had all this from Tony I don’t need it from you too. You two want to wallow in self-pity over the fight, let me wallow in mine.’
‘Wade!’
Wong shrugs and looks at Strange before raising his hand, the other sorcerer does the same, albeit a little grudgingly.
‘Loki-’
‘Awesome!’ he and Ned chorus, earning them some fond laughs from the team.
Strange gives a small laugh. ‘Alright. But first we need to do some more research.’
‘You want to make sure it’s done this time so you want someone to come along and help take out the trash?’ Bucky’s voice comes from the doorway. Both of them turn to look at him as he walks further into the room. Steve notices Bucky’s focus is solely on Wade, and he leaves the two to have a silent conversation. Eventually Bucky looks towards him. ‘I’ll go with him.’
‘You asked me to help you fight Steve,’ Peter deadpans.
‘Adopted daughter,’ the human interjects quickly. ‘She hates him as much as anyone else.’
Steve grabs hold and chuckles a little. ‘I wouldn’t do that if I were you, Pete,’ he says. ‘Why don’t you go wake up some of the others and we’ll be upstairs within the hour alright?’
we did it? What if someone worse than Thanos comes calling and we’re too busy fighting amongst ourselves that we can’t defeat them? Isn’t that why we nearly lost to him in the first place?’
‘I better take Wanda her morning tea, she’s a little grumpy when she wakes up without it,’ Vision says. ‘After Bucky had a clock thrown at his head when he tried to wake her up once, it’s fallen to me to be the alarm clock. Phasing does have its uses.’
?’ Harry asks, eyes narrowed in Flash’s direction.
‘Yeah I know…but I don’t want to get in the way.’
He nods. ‘I know, I just- I wish you didn’t have to do them at all.’
‘Hey what about us guys that aren’t freaks of nature?’ Sam asks.
didn’t know about and I realised what had happened. I’d gone back to the right time, but somehow I’d managed to go to a different dimension, and I’ve somehow swapped with my counterpart from this one. So much of what we did was the same all the way up to meeting and dealing with Francis.’
‘Look,’ Tony interrupts the one-eyed man, ‘go and talk to him. Tell him what’s going on and let him make up his own mind. If he agrees to help, then fine, and if he doesn’t then you leave him alone and one of us will come and help. I’ll send something with Steve for you to give to Pete if he does decide to help. Agreed?’
‘Hmph,’ Deadpool crosses his arms, pretending hurt, and looks the other way.
‘Fine,’ Bucky rolls his eyes, ‘like we would anyway. Not when it’s something this important to him.’
As always do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see from these characters in the future. I hope you all continue to enjoy this story, I am still looking for ideas for specials so please let me know if there's any you'd like to see.
‘Not everyone at once,’ Steve reassures him with a smile. ‘We’ll all take it in turns, that way you can see if there’s any difference in the sense you get from different people and different forms of attacks.’
‘YIBAMBE!’
‘That’s awesome,’ she grins up at him. ‘When did you become a super-hero?’
‘Well, uh, happy new year, Spidey,’ Wade says, ‘you uh, you want to go on that date or would you rather not and-’
‘Hey what about me?’ Wanda demands from the end of the table.
‘Bullseye, Snowflake,’ Wade sighs, letting go of Peter’s hand to open the bag he’d put at his feet when they sat down. ‘I…I’m not from here.’
Thor and Valkyrie meet some first class A-Holes.
‘This is true. But I’ll never pass up an opportunity for a hotel with a good bar.’
‘Cooper? Lila? What are you-’
Tony tries not to tense up at the thought of the team leaving, and obviously doesn’t do a very good job of it if the tightening of Steve’s arm and Wanda’s reassuring look is anything to go by. ‘Rhodey’s right. FRIDAY?’
Tony nods, taking it from Thor’s hand and pressing it into the gauntlet with the one he already has. He can feel additional power coursing through his suit and he wonders how long it’ll be able to withstand the added power for.
Tony places the box on a table and sits down, running a hand along his face. If Steve was a betting man he’d say the inventor looks as if he’s about to cry.
‘I’m grabbing the back,’ MJ says before elbowing her way through to save them all the back seats so they can sit together.
‘If you didn’t stay on the ceiling during food fights there wouldn’t have
‘It’s not-’
He gives her a tight hug. ‘I know, and thank you. Now please stop trying to talk me out of this. I’m having enough trouble not running for the hills as it is.’
Love always,
‘Because you’re a jerk,’ Steve says, grinning. Tony just sighs and shakes his head as the two start bickering. Who knew bringing everyone back would just give him more headaches?
Tony is stood in front of another tunnel exit that came out to the left of where their one enters, his suit is in place and he’s watching the fight in the middle; opposite them is a single Jotun standing against the wall, apparently overseeing the fight. In the last exit of the chamber stand the remaining two Jotun. In the centre are two others, one of which Bucky recognises as Loki’s half-brother; the other takes him a moment to place before he recognises Loki in his Jotun form.
‘Hey now,’ Tony protests, ‘don’t go hating on my version of Cinderella, Morgan, it’s the story of how me and your Papa got together.’
The team struggle to find leads to help them track down their missing friends, and Wade voices everyone's worst fears.
‘You were scared of losing Spiderman,’ May says, though he notices her stance is a little less tense, and the statement is bordering on being a question.
The white haired woman blinks in surprise. ‘Yes we are. You…you would allow my people to stay here when they wished?’
‘For the love of…’ Peter rubs his temples with his fingers. ‘See this is another reason I didn’t want this stupid trip to go ahead, you overreact with anything that happens at school.’
‘The last barrel of the Asgardian mead,’ Thor suggests, ‘to be consumed only by the victor.’
It’s nearly a month since she arrived back in America and rejoined the team; she and Tony spent most mornings downstairs in the training room working on improving her control of her powers. She isn’t sure how he manages to fit in training with her, running out most afternoons to meet with Ross and the committee, keep up with his own training and inventing, made sure he was back almost every night for dinner with the team, and still manage to look after himself.
‘Sorry, Cap, but I’m not going to trust he’s not up to his usual mind tricks,’ the archer growls, Scott’s looking between him and Loki like he’s watching a tennis match.
‘Stay back for now,’ he replies as the door to the plane opens, Steve’s very familiar form stepping out just as the soldiers come into view around the side of one of the buildings. ‘Follow my lead. We can’t afford a fight.’
Do let me know what you think of these chapters, they're a hint as to where this special is going, and throughout the story there is going to be hints as to what I currently have planned in the main series. So keep your eyes peeled and see if you can spot them!
Stark laughs again. ‘I like you Barnes. I promise you, I’m going to get you fixed up, and then I’m going to find out why all this happened.’
‘Well…it’s probably going to be faster,’ Steve sighs. ‘Really wish I’d brought my shield now.’
Let’s test that shall we?
‘I know but-’ Tony sighs and sits up, finally daring to meet that piercing gaze. ‘Steve I don’t want to keep on doing this with that still hanging over us. We’ve not actually
Tony looks at the teen carefully, arms crossed over his chest. ‘Alright, kid, invite him up. But he’s on the same probation as Loki is alright? I’ll warn the team when I get back from this call.’
. How did you do it? Do you grow or does just the suit? Wait is it the suit that makes you grow or is it your powers? Can you actually talk to ants?’
Peter blocks it out, burying his head in Tony’s chest. Because he hasn’t been able to tell Wade about all the illusions Beck had created for him before they’d met up. He can’t tell him that Beck made him kill Tony.
‘What happened to the programme? Are they still operating?’ Vision asks.
‘He made them himself,’ Loki cuts across Wade.
‘Maybe a bit of both,’ he admits, then introduces Scott to the people he doesn’t know.
‘You’ve called her plenty of times now stop being a baby. You know both you and Wanda are not going to have a perfect Christmas unless Peter is here with us.’
, he thinks as he enters the park and realises he’s lost them already.
‘Yeah but you love them,’ he laughs, gesturing at the four tickets he’d bought, renting out a racetrack for the day. ‘And you know this is
‘What are you-’
Tony just closes his eyes and let’s himself relax against the super soldier. ‘Don’t leave me,’ he whispers.
‘Maybe another time,’ Steve rolls his eyes, ‘let’s beat this guy first.’
Steve smiles. ‘Not yet I haven’t. I was wondering if you wanted to start joining in on team training? We seem to be slacking on the weekends, and I didn’t want you to get left alone with only the mad scientist for company,’ he grins as he jerks a thumb at Tony.
‘That’s not the-’
‘Already done, boss.’
‘You know what? I don’t want to know. Don’t tell me anymore,’ Peter puts a hand up; then he frowns. ‘How many have you got left to do?’
‘Hilarious, Doc, maybe you should take up a career as a comedian,’ Tony rolls his eyes. It doesn’t take long for Dr Hill to do all the tests and he leaves them in one of the room while he goes to get the results.
Peter seems to consider that good enough, so he sits next to Tony and tells them about what happened over a week ago. How he’d been following a couple of drug dealers wanting to find out where their supplies were coming from and had met Deadpool at the site; since both of them wanted to take out the gang they’d decided to work together, on the condition Deadpool didn’t kill anyone and they left them for the police to take care of. They heard how the two had worked together, Deadpool sticking to his promise until Peter had been caught unawares.
As the doors open he spots the window and takes a running leap, landing gracefully inside and looking up.
‘Excuse me?’ Bucky demands. ‘How is the mind controlling maniac going to be of any use with healing?’
‘Everything alright, Buckaroo?’
‘How does he do it?’
Wanda bites down hard on her lip to stop from saying everything she wants to as Bucky’s motionless form gets thrown into his cell, and he rolls onto his side. The cell door is slammed shut, and one of the guards smirks in her direction before they disappear up the corridor. She listens to their thoughts as they go, but most of it is a language she doesn’t understand and the only things she can guess at are to do with what the one’s wife has planned for dinner that evening.
‘I assume she’s magically drained?’ Loki asks from where he’s leaning against a wall behind the other three.
‘Wong is staying at the Sanctum whilst I am gone,’ Strange ignores Sam’s comment. ‘If there is anything you need he shall be there to assist. How happy he shall be about it remains to be seen. Are those of you who wish to go to Norway ready to accompany me?’
‘So I honestly didn’t ever intend to start dating a mercenary I swear, but it just sort of-well just happened. I mean we were just hanging out more after patrols and became friends and then, I guess something kind of changed just before Hammer attacked the school, and then we started dating just before the team got you out. And to be fair you were all for approving of him when you heard about the rules he’d put in place because I’m, you know, younger than him,’ at Tony’s expression he quickly adds, ‘and I’m taking that back. Taken back.
Natasha nods. ‘Every evening there’s a supply truck that enters the facility around eight, all they have to do is flash a card pass and they’re let in. We need to stop the truck, get rid of its guards and have me and Wade hide in the back while Bucky takes over the driving.’
‘Err… two hours Captain Rogers,’ Peter says, taking a big bit out of a chunk of bread, apparently getting a little bolder now he realises he’s not going to get told off for his actions.
All that's left to say is another big thank you! I hope you enjoy all the other ramblings I come out with in the future.
Do let me know what you think: what worked well and what didn't. It'll definitely affect how I do things in the future so don't be afraid to let me know what you think. I can take criticism I promise. And I really hope you liked the Spideypool! I had to make a point that everyone was concerned about the age gap seeing as Peter was so young, and I'd be interested to know what you think about how they handled it.
Hammer decides its time to speak to the team about his new house guest, and Tony manages to get a message through.
Loki, to Tony’s amusement, flushes. ‘I only did it once at the beginning to ensure they listened!’ he protests.
‘What?!? And Tony
There’s barely enough time for his senses to send off a short warning before Wade’s grabbing his arm and dragging him out towards the back room; he doesn’t struggle, reading the anger radiating from the other man, and really hoping Wanda doesn’t choose now to reappear. He’s not entirely sure she’d help the situation. He hears Weasel calling to Wade as they disappear into the corridor and then he’s being shoved through the door to the back room and Wade’s following him through it, slamming the door shut and leaning back against it, arms crossed over his chest and a furious expression on his face.
Wade’s whole body goes rigid, and the look he turns to Peter almost frightens the teenager, if it wasn’t for the fact his spidey senses haven’t changed their tune. ‘Weasel failed to mention you were there when the two men arrived.’
‘Lower it in section eighteen,’ he repeats. ‘We need to keep them focussed on us until we are able to remove the stone from Vision.’
‘How are you feeling?’
‘Aw nothing much,’ the raccoon replies, ‘just a bomb I’ve been working on.’
This time when he falls, he lets go of Wanda, her body rolling an arm’s length away. He thinks he can see Steve fighting to get back towards them, but black clad soldiers have materialised out of the mist between them.
‘Wait,’ Sam blinks, ‘you’re
‘Good enough. Now let’s go join the part- Peter Benjamin Parker how many do I have to tell you: no eating on the ceiling!’
‘What have we got?’ Tony asks, retracting his helmet and coming to stand next to Natasha who is already furiously typing away, two bodies at her feet. ‘You know, it’s kind of scary how little having people lying dead at your feet as you work distracts you.’
‘Or what, tough guy? What you gonna do?’ the man walks over to him and kicks him onto his back.
words rather than any of the others because they were the last ones he’d heard.’
‘Your ego doesn’t need the boost.’
Peter hesitates before he knocks on the door.
And in his mind, there is only silence. For the first time in months, he feels alone.
‘Bucky!’ Peter has never been happier to hear Steve’s voice.
‘I already told you: treason.’
‘Let him have it,’ Steve tells them, and the three of them unleash their full power at the alien. He screams, a long, loud, high pitched scream, that lingers even when he falls motionless to the ground.
‘Isn’t it a little early for this?’ he whines as he heads to the coffee machine.
‘Alright, alright, keep your shirt on,’ he cautiously approaches the suit. ‘Hey, uh, think I could, um, come inside?’ The suit opens smoothly, leaving space for him to step backwards into it. ‘Oh man this is so cool. And also terrifying. Hey! What the-’ with the suit now encasing him Clint’s able to see the forms of the trapped people under Hulk through the debris, and the computer immediately starts calculating the best route to get to them. ‘Oh man this is awesome. Why didn’t I ask Tony for one of these before?’
‘And the weapons?’ Bucky asks.
‘Guys? We need to leave. NOW!’ Clint shouts. ‘Get the hell out of there!’
‘Because I didn’t either,’ he replies, ‘I didn’t dream I was drowning once.’
Panic fills his chest as the material starts to rise up, the man at the table has cut himself free and is heading towards the other two.
‘That’s the mead Stark gave me as a Yule gift!’ Valkyrie snaps.
‘Why Nebula and not Quill?’ Rocket asks.
‘Maybe we should have two or three of you this time,’ Pepper ignores his comment.
Tony finally looks up at him and Steve’s heart breaks. There’s so much pain in those brown eyes that he does the only thing he can do. Steve reaches up, cupping one of the bloodied cheeks with his hand, running his thumb over the dry, chapped lips.
A/N: Hey everyone! I hope you enjoyed this chapter and can forgive me for the bit of an emotional roller coaster. I'd be really interested to hear what you all think, especially about Tony and Peter's... erm... discussion? And the flashback to the scene with Bucky and Tony. I had a request to add in some WinterIron into this story a while ago, and this was part of the response to that.
‘You were seeing Daredevil. When did you find out who he was?’
‘You mean the fact he’s an insane mercenary?’
-I did nothing except speak. I know you can hear me-
‘If you want me to.’
‘You bet on Thor didn’t you?’ Tony grins, but Steve just scowls at him.
‘Tony!’ is the last thing he hears, seemingly through water, as his vision blacks out.
‘But what if they do?’ Peter asks as he fiddles with his covers. ‘What if they come and find us when you aren’t here?’
‘As soon as everyone’s up we’ll get on the quinjet and go,’ he responds, gulping down his coffee as though it’s his lifeline.
‘I’m getting used to it,’ Strange rolls his eyes. ‘At least I know it’ll help if I’m in danger, the rest of the time it’s best to let it do what it wants.’
‘No,’ though his voice is not as sure any more.
Bruce was busy analysing samples from the canisters that had been left at the scene that had contained the mist, and T’Challa’s suit had managed to contain some of it which meant they had a small sample to work from. Shuri was on her way over to help, and Wade had disappeared into the city to follow up with some of his contacts on any news on HYDRA. Being the only member of the team who would be able to move around fairly safely, Clint and Natasha had also given him some of their contacts to follow as well.
Tony let’s out a bark of harsh laughter, and can’t hold back his next words. ‘You didn’t seem to care about whether or not I could trust you after Siberia, why the sudden crisis Cap?’
‘Well…each family has different traditions they do, and since we all became each other’s family we just decided to combine ones from everyone. It’s actually quite fun because it means we’ve all been doing things we hadn’t done before. And we’ve been making new ones as well: like Bucky winning that huge tree the first year that now means we always get a huge one to put outside. And last year we did Yule and now we’re going to start doing a Yule feast each year, just later than the usual date.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint curses and Peter’s about to celebrate when Wade grabs him and pushes him to the ground, wrapping his body around him. Peter’s about to question it when he hears the tell tale
‘It was all over the news that the amazing Spiderman helped the Avengers with a hostage situation,’ Deadpool shrugs, then he grins again. ‘I’m right aren’t I?’ Peter curses himself and turns to leave again. ‘It’s obviously bothering you, Spidey. What happened?’
Ned’s eyes, if possible, get even wider. ‘You just called the Black Widow by her first name dude.
‘Uh…what did I do?’ Peter asks.
Steve nods and heads back the way he’s come, just as he’s about to join the street he looks back and sees Tony still stood watching him and raises his hand in farewell before he turns the corner and loses sight of him.
‘Will do,’ the AI responds.
Tony shrugs. ‘Sometimes they only want my wonderful presence once a week. Sometimes it can be every day. When we were working to get you all back it was a lot more regular.’
That’s probably why he misses the foot in the small of his back that sends him sprawling to the ground. Reacting on instinct yet again he springs from his hands and flips over into a crouch, waiting for his opponent to make their next move.
‘You two can shut it,’ the soldier scowls, causing both of them to laugh.
‘Thank you,’ Peter smiles up at Tony. He’s startled to see tears begin to form in the man’s eyes.
‘Stark,’ Strange nods.
‘What the-’ Wade turns round and spots him. ‘Shit! What are you doing you fucking idiot?’
‘You’re up early,’ Bucky comments. ‘Trouble sleeping?’
‘You are not using an animated movie to help Thor in his arguments.’
‘No,’ she shakes her head, ‘let’s go.’ As she tells FRIDAY to close down the various screens and turns to follow the teenager she sees him waiting for her in the doorway.
‘Kid,
‘-down in my workshop. Now!’
Instinctively, Peter reaches out to grab him, their hands locking as Peter feels the tug in his other arm, and he swings the soldier towards the end point. Praying he’s timed it well enough he lets go of his own bar.
‘You do realise Bucky’s already taken two out with his right? And Clint’s got two knives ready for any that get close to him.’
‘I don’t like staying back,’ she admits to Natasha. ‘Not when T’Challa is on the front line.’
‘Nat-’
‘Yes,’ both of them respond in unison.
‘Where are we going?’ the archer asks.
‘None of you,’ he says, terror sitting in his stomach, ‘are coming to my school dance. It’s going to be bad enough without the possibility of eternal humiliation being on the cards. And will you stop calling me
‘That’s the top clearance level in the company,’ the inventor continues as Peter trails off, ‘which is currently assigned to three people: you, me and Pepper. Pete…this is kind of a present for now and something for the future and I wasn’t sure whether to tell you now, and then decided Nat was right and you should have the chance to decide for yourself how much you want to do now-’
Tony laughs, falling to his knees next to the soldier and brings him into a hug. ‘Just don’t kiss me alright?’ Then after a pause. ‘You did it.’
The four of them are down in his workshop as he talks away. Sam had noticed on the first evening that Tony constantly fiddles with things when he’s nervous so suggested he continued to tinker in his workshop while they talked. Tony isn’t sure he’s ever going to repay the man for that suggestion, and he’s already put together a long list of possible ways to do it in the future. Including paying for his entire wedding and honeymoon if he ever gets married.
He can see Steve’s face pale, and his jaw goes rigid. ‘Buck I’m not-’
Clint snorts. ‘You mean Bucky was making sure I wasn’t threatening you.’ The archer looks back inside, then sighs and turns back to him. ‘She’s not going to get back with him you know.’
Bucky asks.
Valkyrie pauses. ‘I’m not really sure what it was at first. Maybe it was Loki reminding me of the memories of facing Hela; maybe it was hearing she was free again and it was the rage that the one who had killed my lover was back; maybe I was just tired of being lonely. Whatever it was I decided to do something for someone other than me for the first time in centuries, decided I was going to be part of a team again.’
‘I think it’s several people at this stage,’ Tony huffs a laugh; then he comes over to stand in front of Peter, taking in a deep breath and placing his hands on Peter’s upper arms, looking him straight in the eye. ‘I’m not going to lie and say I’m happy about this, or that I’m going to accept it overnight. But we owe him for all our lives, and for yours a couple of times over, and we’re giving Loki a chance: so we’ll give him the same. I guess it’s the least we can do.’
‘Nice to know you’ve been gossiping behind my back.’
Bucky shrugs. ‘Well we never had one as kids because you couldn’t afford to waste food. Was only ever something you saw in the movies, so you just used to talk with your mates about growing up and being rich enough to afford enough food that you
you I didn’t want to drink.’
‘What happened, Tony?’ Steve asks quietly.
‘I know I shouldn’t rise to his childish antics…’
‘I can confirm that Peter is alive, Miss Maximoff,’ the AI says.
T’Challa fixes him with an assessing look. ‘You would not have worried when I met you before.’
‘Yeah no, never call me that again.’
‘Who is EDITH?’ Rhodes asks.
‘That was
‘Tony Stark? My name is Doctor Stephen Strange, I’m the Master of the New York Sanctum and I’d like to know why you have allowed a threat to the world into your home,’ the man responds.
‘You fight as Jotun or I order the death of your friend,’ Lautenus is no longer smirking, but looking more intense than he has before in their exchanges.
‘Jerk,’ he mutters, knocking away the arm Bucky tries to ruffle his hair with. He feels better having spoken with Bucky about their old team, for a while it had felt like they shouldn’t bring them up, but now it felt like a small weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
By the time they’ve completed the team building activities that were set for after dinner Peter is ready to escape the majority of his classmates. As soon as Sam calls for everyone else to follow him back to the area they’d set aside for the school’s use, Peter grabs his friends and quick marches them towards the elevators.
What next? Oh yeah! So Bucky tries to get Loki to help him with not being mind controlled. Ends up back firing and now the two have a freaky telepathic mind link. Oh the fun I could have with Peter with one of those….I’m wondering who’s going to have the inappropriate thoughts first. My money’s on Snowflake. I’m going to start a sweepstake. Anyway then Loki sees there’s Jotun runes on some pictures from one of Stark funded projects and he and Barnes and Stony go to Norway to check it out.
It’s peaceful as they walk along the path, rows of stones stretching away into the field. Neither of them says much, just happy to be away from the compound. Eventually, though, Tony stops and turns off the path; three rows back, set slightly apart from the other stones around them, sit the graves of his parents.
‘He can read you better than I can, Tones, don’t even bother,’ Rhodes shakes his head.
‘Considering you’re nearly sixty years older than me I don’t think you can talk about age gaps, honey.’
‘Follow me to my apartment, I’ll get changed and then we’ll head on out.’
‘Especially if their name is Tony Stark or Bruce Banner,’ Clint laughs.
‘You went for the same hiding place I did!’ Tony says as Steve hands him his present.
‘You’re more than welcome,’ Wanda smiles at her. ‘Are you both alright?’
‘Want me to speak to Fury about taking over?’ Clint offers.
‘You better have done all your homework, Peter. You aren’t going out on patrol until you have. Are you still listening to me?’
‘And he’d know seeing as he’s been around for that whole century,’ Sam adds, earning a round of laughter from everyone else.
I can see Widow making her way along the side of the truck. She’s only got one driver to take out but it’d make too much noise. I’m being too quiet.
‘The night you
‘Hey Baby Boy,’ a subdued voice comes from behind him.
‘Because it’s amazing.’
‘Um, hey Doc,’ he waves still distracted by the number of books he can see, and slowly walks over to where the man is sitting in a large chair in front of a desk.
, Spidey. You’re jail bait!’
On their one in the facility, Peter usually crawls up the wall and helps the others up, or Wanda will use her magic and get everyone up at once, or Tony, Rhodes and Sam will ferry people up in their suits.
‘Definitely not.’ At the pout on his face, Tony sighs. ‘But you might be able to one day in one of the new suits I’m working on for you.’
‘I’ve no interest in joining the super-hero squad,’ Daredevil spits at him. ‘I’m only interested in him,’ he points towards Deadpool, ‘getting the hell out of here. And if not then if I can’t find a way to get rid of you myself I’ll drop the Avengers a line and make sure they finish the job.’
‘Uh, hey,’ he squeaks, ‘yeah, uh, what was that for?’
Tony just leans further back and grins up at his partner. ‘But Steve, everyone agrees
Bucky watches him leave and then turns his attention back to the sorcerer and the trickster; they seem to have become very friendly since Loki had gone to visit this morning and now Bucky’s worried he’s left it too long. Not that he
He looks over to see Natasha helping Nebula to tie her skates. ‘Are you sure it is not difficult to balance on these? They seem to be designed to be difficult to walk on.’
‘Tell me about it,’ Bucky rolls his eyes in response as the trickster finally appears through the doors and makes his way towards them. ‘Please tell me we have an open ended tab at the bar.’
Wade catches Weasel’s eye and gestures with his head to the back room and, when Peter goes up to the bar to return his glass, Weasel says something to him and takes him out the back. Giving it about half a minute, Wade hurries after them.
‘Oh,’ Tony’s shoulders slump, ‘fine, play your Christmas music.’
‘Do you have more in you?’
‘Yeah I’m glad you’re here unwrapping it, kid, it needs a bit of explanation. Take a seat.’
‘Led Zepplin? Led Zepplin! Peter how can you have spent so much time with me and not know that you were listening to AC/DC?’ Tony demands.
‘Steve, I-’ the words he wants to say catch in his throat, so instead he just smiles and says, ‘thank you.’
‘And if he decides to turn back into the Winter Soldier and attack them all?’ Ross counters.
get hitched.’
Peter frowns behind the mask. ‘What are you talking about?’
‘Where
‘We are not here for you, Midgardian,’ one of them, a female by her voice responds. ‘We are here for him.’ She points to Loki.
Steve sighs and Tony grips the sheets beneath his hands tighter, trying to stop the traitorous flow. ‘Will you look at me? Please?’
‘Not that you’ll remember it the next morning if you can get your hands on enough drink,’ Loki smirks, flickering out of sight as a cushion is launched in his direction and reappearing, cackling, at the breakfast bar next to Sam.
‘What you feeling tonight, Spidey, chimichangas or burritos?’
‘Steve!’ Tony calls out a warning, firing up his suit to grab hold of the pole before the alien can get his swing going. He plants his boots onto the pavement and uses his weight to pull it back, effectively stopping the alien, which lets out a grunt of surprise.
‘I didn’t do anything!’ the metal armed man defends himself, dropping Peter’s bags at the door.
‘Let them,’ T’Challa says as the army surges forwards.
He doesn’t want to open his eyes just yet, that usually leads to bright lights and lots more pain. So he decides taking stock of his surroundings and injuries would be a good start. There’s a steady beeping in the background, and the tell-tale sound of machines working.
‘We should still warn him,’ Natasha says, ‘how many stones are there?’
not talk about this?’
‘Don’t call me Petey-Pie
Steve laughs. ‘Point taken,’ then the two of them set up a production line of sorts to get the popcorn prepared. When they’ve filled one bowl Tony calls to Wanda to say it’s ready and she uses her powers to bring it over to the rest of the group. Sam and Rhodes are having an argument over the best way to lay the cushions on the floor, while Peter and Vision appear to be having a discussion on the web fluid.
‘Because you are less likely to have any lasting injuries from the abilities I wish to experiment with,’ the man sighs. ‘I…I am not comfortable with these abilities and the form I shall have to take to use them as it is. I hate to admit it, but I do not particularly want to injure anyone here should something go wrong.’
‘Can we not tell him and get Peter to do it all in secret?’ Natasha asks. ‘Then just show him the finished project?’
Bucky doesn’t respond, just glares at the smirking god in front of him and closes his eyes, remembering the meditation exercises he’d started practising once the programming had begun to wear off. He feels fingers on either side of his temples and tries to stay calm.
Peter grins. ‘You’ll have to wait till next time to learn my name.’ He swings away to the sound of the merc’s laughter.
Love always,
‘The one Pepper had framed?’ Steve asks.
‘Mr Parker? Mr Parker!’ he snaps his head up, trying his best to ignore the sniggers from Flash. ‘Mr Parker can you
‘The Council just called, they want you and me to go and see them this morning,’ the inventor replies, rubbing one eye with the heel of his hand and yawning as he reaches for the coffee pot.
‘It’s just basic Physics,’ he grumbles, swatting away the soldier’s hand, ‘any of them could work it out.’ He gestures towards his classmates.
‘Only like the best pilot in the Air Force!’ Sam and Rhodes answer at once.
Loki smiles at her. ‘Please, do not tell anyone else this. I do have
‘Sam did it for me, my fingers were shaking too badly,’ he admits.
‘Around eight,’ is the reply as Tony takes their glasses back to the mini bar. ‘Think you and Bucky can resist killing each other for an hour?’
‘What?’
‘I want you to cancel all appointments for tomorrow-’
‘We can work on some of them,’ Tony replies. ‘Not sure we can take them all, Cap.’
‘Thor I will turn all of your prized possessions into serpents if you don’t stop pestering Tony and Steve to let you go on a hunt,’ he turns a threatening finger on his brother.
‘Why would they have guards when most of the test subjects end up not being able to move?’ Wade adds. Natasha is glad Bucky doesn’t have an answer any more than she does.
‘Only Vision,’ she responds.
Tony can’t help it, the kid looks so scared he pulls him into another hug and presses a brief kiss to his hair. ‘You’ll be fine, Pete.’
‘But I wouldn’t want the flavours to be contaminated by each other,’ Loki frowns.
‘We could celebrate Yule up to the twenty-first,’ Sam suggests, ‘and invite others to come and celebrate it with us, and then celebrate Christmas afterwards. Might be fun to do something different and may stop Wanda and Peter becoming the terrible Christmas goblins again.’
‘I got you, kid,’ Steve reassures him, the blond’s hand tightening around his own in an almost punishing grip. ‘I’ll swing you the rest of the way, Pete.’
‘The next move, Miss Potts,’ he replies, ‘is tying up our loose ends with the issue over Sergeant Barnes. There’s a couple of people still involved in all of that I want to see come to justice. JARVIS?’
‘Uh…yeah but…well it might not work so well,’ he admits, wondering if they could actually pull it off considering he’s supposed to be holding back.
‘Do they look like Jotun runes to you?’ Tony asks Loki.
‘Sure we-’
like Pete. But something isn’t quite right. Then it hits me.
‘Yeah but Peter’s convinced him that one needed changing,’ Tony can’t help but chuckle, ‘I need to hear the story I think; but Wade’s not moving on the others. Which makes me feel a little happier if I’m honest; plus if I can make an attempt at holding down a relationship with Captain America I don’t think I can say Deadpool can’t have a chance at holding down one of his own.’
Surprisingly enough they manage to chop the tree down with very little trouble. Although Wade does lose a leg at one point due to him messing around, and he ends up standing on one leg to help chop down the rest of the tree. The sun is starting to set by the time they get the tree down, and luckily Wade’s leg has finished regenerating because the mercenary was not looking forwards to having to deal with Peter if he hadn’t fully recovered. Despite knowing the mercenary heals as well as he does, the teenager still doesn’t like seeing him get hurt and Wade’s inability to take getting himself injured seriously has caused more than one argument between the two. Thor can see why the teenager gets upset seeing his loved one hurt, but isn’t sure why he gets as upset as he does seeing as the man appears to be incapable of dying.
‘Well yeah, but there’s nothing that’s going to-’
‘Thor that thing is huge,’ Steve eyes the tree uncertainly. ‘How are we going to turn it into a table in time?’
‘I’m not so sure,’ Loki muses, ‘I agree that something feels slightly…I’m not sure how to describe it. A little familiar, but also…unnerving.’
‘Dammit Tony this isn’t just about the Accords. But now you mention it, yeah this is what you were like. You wouldn’t listen when I tried to tell you Bucky was innocent, when I tried to get you to give me time to find out what was happening.’
‘Matt’s out at the moment and may not be back for an hour or so at least, he’s getting some stuff for a case. Sure I can’t help you?’ the fair haired man asks. Peter just shakes his head, and looks back at his textbook. ‘You’re from the gala right?’ Peter looks back up and nods at the question, he sees the frown on Mr Nelson’s face and then the man gestures for Peter to follow him. ‘Come here, kid.’
‘If we’re done being sentimental?’ Lautenus cuts in. ‘The rules are very simple-’
‘Any final words, dearie?’
‘Pete, you agreed to do Neil Jacobs’ science homework for a whole semester just so he’d stop annoying Laura Hall.’
She fixes him with one of
‘And unfortunately he has to eat at least twice as much as the rest of us because of, uh, his job,’ Ned supplies.
Natasha huffs. ‘I’m supposed to worry about you, you know.’
And here's the sneak peek (again I'm sorry and I love you all):
‘So we’ve got to put a load of things on this giant bush?’ Rocket says as she comes over with Rhodey and Sam.
Bucky tries to look innocent, but the snigger ruins the image. ‘Just thinking that this song basically sums up your love life, Stevie.’
‘Tony we’re both adults, it’s slightly different when a teenager is involved.’
‘Sounds like a plan,’ Peter says. ‘Shall we have pizza before or after?’
‘Dr Higgs is with him now,’ Peter explains, ‘she’s said it will take a bit of time but she’s hopeful he can pull through. She said she assumes she’s not to talk about this unless you tell her otherwise.’
‘I suggest,’ T’Challa speaks up as the discussion surround Thanos comes to a close, ‘that we briefly discuss the proposed new Accords. Whilst we have everyone around the same table it seems a shame to waste the opportunity, besides if we can move them into completion before Thanos’ arrival we may be fighting from a stronger position.’
‘Maybe?’
‘Tony get down!’ Clint slamming into his side and sending them both sprawling to the ground from his chair cuts off his retort, the next thing he hears is a crack from the table. He looks up over Clint’s shoulder to see a bullet hole in the table. Rhodes and Bruce have already scrambled to their feet and Rhodes is looking out of the window looking for where the bullet came from.
have to go?’
‘We’ll head on up now,’ Scott tells him.
‘Hey Pete you know how to play poker?’
He turns, shaking his head as Deadpool wrestles with the two on the floor, knocking one unconscious and putting the other in a strangle hold.
‘I am not-’
‘Why are you in Rhodey’s suit?’
Steve reaches the ground and starts sprinting to the entrance. ‘Everyone else in position?’
‘You sure, Quill? Because you answered that very quickly for someone whose been-’
Apparently the Asgardians were
He wonders, frowning into the sink in front of him. He misses having Tony as a friend so why is it his stomach twists painfully at that thought.
‘Thor,’ Valkyrie sighs, ‘it’s not that they’re cowards necessarily. These all seem to be people running from the destruction he and his lieutenants are leaving behind them, they’re scared to go against him because they’ve seen what he is capable of and they’ve already lost a lot to him. It’s understandable, especially when none of these people are warriors. The rest are pirates, smugglers and ravagers and have no interest in drawing attention to themselves. We must be patient, Loki was certain we would find someone here who could help us.’
‘I’m saying,’ Tony leans on his other arm so he can look at Steve easier, the determination back in his face and taking his breath away. ‘I’m saying that if you really do still love me Steve, if you are serious this time that you want to be together that Pepper isn’t going to be surprised when I tell her. So what I want to know is this: do you still love me enough to want to be with me?’
‘There’s a couple of entrances, Cap, but nothing showing up as a red flag yet. Definitely been some movement around here though,’ comes the reply, ‘I don’t know how it didn’t get picked up.’
‘I don’t know,’ comes the reply, accompanied by a sigh big enough to lift half of Tony’s torso from the bed. ‘I wish I did. The one thing I will say about Wade is we know he’ll protect Peter, and he’s proven he’ll help us because he knows it’s what Peter would want. If nothing else we can trust that. Though I’m not sure how I feel about their relationship.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Will you come and join in our Yule celebrations?’ Peter asks Matt as they go to leave the apartment, Wade is going to head back separately so he can tie up any loose ends from his assignment and has already left through the other door.
‘His good side?’ Pepper grins. ‘Or tall, blond, muscular and handsome’s good side?’
‘Well,’ Peter scratches the back of his head. ‘I didn’t really want to go for any of the really big names, you know? But I wanted to go for someone close to them. Like an adviser or something. Someone who was an influence on them, but not necessarily in the spotlight themselves. I just think that’d be much more interesting.’
She gently brushes a strand of unwashed hair from his forehead. ‘You just focus on making sure Steve gets you to that jet in one piece, leave the rest to us.’
‘Yeah,’ Wanda frowns. ‘Why?’
‘None of the others had the same one?’
‘You know it’s genuinely disturbing how you manage to hide all those weapons,’ he tells her.
‘Tony!’ Bucky greets the new arrival enthusiastically. ‘You just missed Sam’s story about flying into a tree.’
people
you can call him,’ he suggests, spinning out into the corridor and managing to web one of the guys down. ‘Hey Karen is this suit bulletproof?’
Bucky bursts out laughing. ‘Yeah and it was all my fault that started. I’d been to the bar to get them each their drink and then mixed up the glasses when I gave them their orders.’
‘I still say it’s unfair you can do that,’ MJ grumbles.
‘I hate to break it to you, Steve, but the man does have to lead when it comes to dancing, and I imagine it’ll be a woman who you end up dancing with at the gala.’ The blond still looks unsure so he adds, ‘Come on just give it a go. You’ll probably be better at it than you think.’
‘Sorry, Buck, but you know you’re just not the right partner,’ Steve grins at his friend.
‘You want me to tell you about the Avengers, Rosie? This is my team and they’re the greatest superheroes to have ever lived. One day you’ll get to meet them because they’re basically my family by now, which means they’re yours as well. We also have some people help us that aren’t officially on the team as well, like this guy, this is Scott,’ he points to a picture of Scott, Hope and Cassie from Yule, ‘and that’s his girlfriend Hope. She’s pretty badass, but they both have these suits that mean they can get really,
‘You know, Wanda,’ Agatha’s voice is more conversational again rather than taunting as she comes to hover in front of her, ‘this is some proper power you have here, sweetie. And now that I’ve had a taste of it? I think I know where it all came from. I mean you showed me how you were made, Wanda darling, you let me into your head.’
‘Mr Stark!’
Steve can’t help the bark of laughter, mentally reminding himself to ask Bucky about that story. Once Vision has left though, he sobers up again and looks over at Natasha.
‘Agent Romanov? There’s a call coming through from the same number that Justin Hammer called from before. Shall I put it through to you in the briefing room?’ FRIDAY asks.
‘Seriously?’ Peter demands. ‘I gave you that reason when I first met you and you completely ignored me, why shouldn’t I do the same to you now?’
‘Get him back to the facility, we’ll follow as soon as we can,’ Tony tells him.
‘Still not legal,’ he counters, and gestures for Ned to follow him. ‘Fuck you could have told me you weren’t even legal I’d have stopped with all the ass comments!’
feel a little warm.’
‘Dad this is definitely
‘What’s a banana split?’ Wanda asks from the cocoon she has made of her blankets on her bed.
‘I don’t want it to get worse, not for Ned anyway. I mean, if Spider-Man can’t take a couple of scraped knees then what-’
‘Haven’t you learned never to underestimate Tony Stark by now?’ Steve chuckles, keeping his voice low so they can’t be overheard. ‘He overdoes things when he thinks he’s to blame you know this.’
‘If I knew what that was I’m sure I could find an answer for you,’ Loki grins.
Bucky groans and gives a small laugh. ‘You’ve been spending way too much time around, Steve. That’s what he used to say.’
Tony sighs. ‘Pete I really
‘More than I care to admit,’ Vision replies, which earns him a round of laughter from the other three occupants in the room.
‘I don’t know what you mean,’ he huffs, not meeting her eyes.
‘I think Mr Stark would have a few things to say about it as well,’ Karen says once the mask is over his face.
‘Wade,’ her tone is warning. ‘We won’t tell anyone else unless your suspicions are confirmed and we have to as part of the mission debrief, and we won’t mention that you had these suspicions when we debrief either. We just want to know what
‘Hey,’ Sam gives him a small smile, ‘you got nothing to worry about, remember?’
‘What did you want us up here for Tony?’ Steve asks as he, Sam and Bucky walk in; they’ve obviously been working out.
‘Wait. What?’ Peter sits up and catches his wallet as Tony throws it at him, checking inside to see the inventor is right.
Natasha casts a last look around the house on Long Island as they finish packing up.
‘What?’ Steve bursts out laughing. ‘No! Where on earth did that come from? Of course it’s not Bucky; that’d be like sleeping with my brother. It was, uh, it was one of the guys from the crew when we were touring with the shows; I never did find out what happened to him.’
‘Oh no,’ he counters, ‘no, no, no. Last time I got dragged into inventing something Ultron happened.’
them?’ Sam asks. ‘By yourself?
‘Love you too, James.’
Bucky sighs, his hand falling from Steve’s shoulder as he looks up at the stars peeking through the clouds. He nods. ‘Yeah. Yeah I do.’
‘It also means,’ Tony says, looking at Thor and Loki, ‘we’re better able to provide protection and asylum to any Asgardians who need it, rather than having to find ways to hide you away. We’ll also be better able to appoint our own staff, and hopefully be less likely to have moles in our midst. All of this,’ he looks at the rest of the team, ‘will only happen if everyone agrees to it, and
‘What about you Sam?’ Tony asks. ‘You spending it with family?’
‘NOW!’ Loki forces his brother to turn and marches him towards the facility. ‘Inform us if there is anything else you need us to do.’
‘Wanda! What are you doing?’ Tony shouts, though in his heart he’s scared he already knows the answer.
Tony blasts through the windows of the café just as a second armoured vehicle comes speeding around the corner and heads straight for the entrance to the courtroom, flying through and leaving Clint to catch up.
‘Yo losers,’ MJ joins them as they head to their lockers. ‘You guys up to much tomorrow? There’s a new film out I want to go and see.’
‘From what I’ve seen of your entire team all you tend to do is pick fights with each other,’ the wizard points out.
Peter smiles at him. ‘No, it’s alright. Thanks anyway.’
to do that?’ Scott asks.
‘Well tell me when you want me here, or come and join me,’ he hears as he starts to fall asleep. There’s three words he wants to say as he drifts off, but he doesn’t quite have the courage right now.
‘And if anyone,’ Tony points a mock-threatening finger at each member in turn, ‘complains about having to do DIY I will personally put them on cleaning duty for a month.’
is a key factor in keeping that team together. Tell our friend he has to find a way to break that boy’s trust in the team and bring him to us, or he’s to find a way to take him out. I don’t care who or what he has to sacrifice to do it, I’ll make it worth it.’
‘Is that Ross?’ Natasha demands.
‘I’m pretty sure you could say the same about a lot of members of this team,’ he counters.
‘Never said you were staring,’ he says quieter, reaching down to press a soft kiss to Tony’s mouth, ‘just said you were enjoying us chopping wood.’
‘Call me Clint,’ he says, ‘now I’m going to get Bucky out here so you can finish off your mistletoe challenge, and
Steve frowns. ‘Not even Bucky knows that so you’ll be hard pressed to find any. Thank God.’
‘Can I just point out,’ the trickster grumbles as he dumps his armful in the middle of the room, ‘that all the strongest and most agile of the team decided to leave the Colonel and I to do all the heavy lifting to watch yet another fight over mead.’ There’s some mumbled apologies and everyone hurries to help the two sort out the materials.
‘None of us did,’ Steve responds.
‘I know,’ she replies with a smile. ‘But I want to come and help you. I know how much you hate these meetings.’
A/N: Hi everyone! I am so sorry I'm late updating this week, we've had no internet for half the week so I've not been able to update. As an apology I'm putting up a second chapter in a couple of minutes so I'll do a longer note there. Thank you so much to all my readers, for everyone who has left kudos and for my wonderful reviewers who, if I haven't got round to replying to you yet I will at some point today.
‘Apologies,’ Loki groans from where he’s holding his head in his hands. ‘I didn’t mean to be quite so forceful. Your mind was so loud it was causing my headache to get worse so I formed a barrier between your mind and my own to block out your thoughts. In my haste I was more forceful than intended, hence why it caused you pain. When this headache has subsided I shall teach you how to do it so you can shut me out should you wish to for the duration of this bond.’
‘What did you name him?’ Bucky asks as the music starts and the dance starts.
‘Oh like you can talk,’ he huffs.
‘So, what is it?’ Bruce asks. ‘I mean I know what is it for people here on Earth, but what is it for you? Sounds like a big thing.’
‘We’re looking for someone name of Wade Wilson,’ one of the men says, Peter peeks around the corner and sees the man lean against the bar.
‘You want me to do what?’ he blinks at Steve, trying to work out how long he’ll be spending in the medical wing after this.
‘My, my, Captain America I never would have thought it,’ Tony teases him, ‘I expected to be wined and dined before such a proposition, now I just feel cheated and cheap.’
‘He has a name you know,’ Peter says, folding his arms over his chest.
‘Everything is perfect,’ he tells her, ‘you, Wanda, are absolutely perfect and I am hoping, I mean I’d very much like-’ he makes himself stop, take the box from his pocket and, as he has seen in many films and television shows in preparation for this event, goes on to one knee in front of her. Wanda’s eyes go wide and she covers her mouth with her hand. ‘Wanda Maximoff, would you do me the honour of becoming my wife, and make me the happiest being in existence?’
Tony shakes his head as Steve continues to lead them around the cleared area. ‘They said they would be making their displeasure at his actions clear, but I doubt they’ll actually do much.’
‘Yes, that makes more sense. Now this celebration doesn’t seem so…’
‘Right then,’ Sam brings the axe up and starts chopping at the base of it.
Steve looks round at everyone, and Tony has rarely seen him this angry. ‘Let’s go.’
‘Celebrating an alien festival? Of course I’m there!’ Ned enthuses.
Weasel just nods and pours him a coke. ‘No alcohol.’
‘Oh my god its amazing!’
‘I didn’t notice him come in,’ Tony ignores Steve’s remark. ‘Before I knew it he was behind me using some technology I’d stopped work on previously; it stuns victims and leaves them paralyzed for a short period of time. I just lay there on the sofa as the man who’d been my guardian took the arc reactor out of my chest, saying I’d outlived my usefulness, and walked off to leave me to die from the shrapnel.’
His phone pings again a couple of minutes later; it’s from Weasel and Peter bursts out laughing at the message, showing it to Wanda.
… forwards, as soon as we get the green light it’ll be over before you know it.’
'Why? I've got a perfectly good view from here. Besides it's probably Mark just grabbed the new guy's arse like he always-' the crowd has moved enough that Wade catches sight of a mop of brown hair and a lithe frame holding the man against the wall.
The back hand cuts him off and sends him flying into the legs of one of the guards. The room behind her erupts in anger, and she gets a sinking feeling at the satisfied look on Hammer’s face. He turns back to the team. ‘Send me the schematics. Or I’m afraid, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes, I may let one of the guards beat you in your little competition.’
‘I said it was probably Tony, Loki and Drax,’ Sam says as he takes Steve’s offered hand to pull him up.
(See the end of the chapter for
He frowns at her. ‘Now you’re just being mean.’
‘Tony from….oh Stevie you really are an idiot,’ Bucky laughs, then groans and holds his chest as it starts to hurt.
‘I missed the bus and the next one broke down?’ Peter mutters, still looking down at the floor.
what we’re facing. They might have taken them to another dimension, or even another
‘Move us off standby mode. We’re on full blown Code Ripley.’
‘Couldn’t you just make him dream that he did the hunt or something?’ Peter asks Wanda quietly. The girl chuckles and shakes her head.
Bucky tenses. ‘Tony, what the fuck are you doing?’ he shouts, scrambling to his feet.
Until he’d left her behind.
‘Why the sudden need to have the mercenary close?’ Tony demands. ‘Just how close are you two exactly?’
‘Peter? What’s wrong?’ Natasha asks, standing up from where she’s sat at one of the tables on a laptop.
‘You know, if you wanted to let off some steam, I’m sure I could have found some more entertaining ways of doing that.’
‘What did you think you saw?’ Tony asks.
He looks over at Sam, whose face says he feels like he’s just attempted to murder Tony and his whole family. ‘Sam? Stop it. It’s not your fault.’
‘How did you get in here?’ Sam asks.
‘Hmm, with bacon and cheese and chillis.’
‘Did Wanda ever tell you how she and her brother came to be orphaned? Their apartment building was shelled, it killed their parents outright but they were trapped under rubble. It was one of
‘Good luck, Steve, our resident grumpy guts is in fine form,’ Sam says, getting up from the chair. ‘Anyone would think he doesn’t appreciate us caring about him.’
Natasha shrugs. ‘I didn’t know I did, I’d never used them like that before and thought I’d try it out. Now I’m wishing I
‘Err…that’s my secret and I shall take it to the grave with-’
‘Pete? You know why I freaked out back there?’ Bucky continues, voice a little steadier than before. Peter shakes his head. ‘It’s because I felt like I’d gone full circle back to before the war and I’m watching Steve getting taken out to the back alley to get beaten up; and I
‘Shut up Tony.’ The inventor just laughs, and Loki calls out reminders of some of the steps to the others as they go through again. As good a dancer as Tony is, and as entertaining as he is when he’s messing around trying to make everyone laugh from making some of the steps more elaborate than they need to be, and as much as Loki is laughing as much as the others when they finish he can’t help but miss having stronger, larger hands grasping his in some of the steps, and the occasional brush of fingers against his waist and forearms as they go through the steps.
‘Sounded like you needed some help,’ she says, ‘I came to lend a hand and I’ll head back when they’re nearly ready.’
shine on us again, Thor.’
‘No I’m talking to the smurf sat next to you,’ Bucky huffs, he’s already nervous about having to ask this as it is without the trickster making it more difficult. ‘Yes I’m asking you.’
‘Deadpool,’ Daredevil growls. ‘I didn’t realise he’d asked for
‘Nice to know there’s another non-freaky speed person here,’ he gives her a smile.
‘Oh, Stevie,’ Bucky laughs and shakes his head. ‘You and me are going to have the birds and the bees talk.’
As they turn to leave the office Tony turns to him with a grin. ‘If I’m Prince Charming does that make you Cinderella?’
‘Sure Tony, I’ll-’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Oh like you would have worked it out sooner,’ Peter grumbles.
‘And just how do you know that?’
I apologise profusely for what I did to Bucky. I'm not going to lie...it's going to get worse before it gets better. As always do let me know what you think and if there is anything you'd like to see in the future!
‘I’ve asked you hundreds of times if there’s anyone cute at your school! Hang on he’s not at your school is he?’
As for the knowledge of Wade’s inter-dimensional travel, well…
‘Yeah, yeah, whatever,’ the raccoon looks back over the trees. ‘I caught Sam and Quill making their way here. Not seen anyone else yet though.’
‘Why were you playing with a bomb in the first place?’ she asks.
Loki’s worry bleeds through.
‘I wouldn’t go
‘Provided it does not intend to cause harm,’ T’Challa adds.
‘Is there anyone you can ask that might have some information on Hammer or HYDRA? Anyone who might know where they took him?’
‘No,’ Wanda argues. ‘I found out they aren’t staying at the facility, and I damaged the building which should help slow them down.’
‘You two ladies not joining us for the last few songs?’ Bucky asks, throwing his jacket on top of Steve’s where it’s resting on the bar and unbuttoning his cuffs.
Deciding not to take any risks, he grabs the handgun from down the side of the sofa cushion, slips his mask over his head and heads to the door. ‘Who is it?’
‘It is,’ he protests.
‘Tony,’ Steve sighs out a laugh and presses a kiss to his cheek, ‘you’re a genius. It sounds perfect.’
He can’t help giving the humanoid a hug as he passes by on his way out. ‘I’m glad you’re alright, Vis.’ He knows the humanoid is surprised and lets go, running out the door to meet Loki before he can return the hug.
‘Well…depends on your point of view,’ he shrugs. ‘I mean he listened well enough that we never got caught again.’
A shout goes up from the direction of the pool table and Wade looks over with a frown; sounds like the newcomer was making a name for themselves. He’s certainly surprised to see one of the more lecherous members of Sister Margaret’s pinned up against the wall, but can’t see the person pinning them because of the crowd of chanting mercs.
he thinks as his laughter eases into chuckles,
‘Right,’ Steve grins, ‘here’s what we’re going to do.’
'Come here,' Sam sighs, coming to stand in front of him wearing a matching black suit, 'honestly, Cap, I thought you'd done this millions of times.'
know about this.’
Peter leaps over the top of the three ninjas that are heading their way, webbing one to the floor so Matt only has two to deal with, before running towards the power source. Its energy signatures are so similar to an infinity stone that when they’d first arrived he’d had to stop himself from having a panic attack. So now he knows he needs to grab it so they can take it back to the facility for everyone to study and frown over; right after he and Loki have thought up some elaborate story as to why they have it in the first place when they should have been Yule and Christmas shopping.
There’s an earnest and honest smile on Steve’s face. ‘Thank you, Tony.’
Rosie tries to grab another picture. ‘Oh that’s Doctor Strange, he’s a real life wizard.’ They go through some of the other members until Rosie leans back against him and starts to suck her thumb, a sure sign she’s getting tired.
‘It was Justin Hammer’s cell, Iron Man,’ comes the reply. ‘We think they were trying to get him out and ended up killing everyone in a three cell radius.’
‘Well that’s what happens when you take on the dream team,’ Peter laughs. When Wade finally sets him down he grins up at the man. ‘Tacos or chimichangas?’
‘Why does everyone think it was so terrible that we ended up with a second tree anyway?’ Bucky demands. ‘We
‘Mr Stark can you say with certainty the Avengers are a fully cohesive team once again?’
‘Alright that’s enough children!’ Tony cuts across the argument. ‘We’ve only got a couple of minutes until midnight and I’m not seeing the New Year in with an argument. Wade give the kid half the beer and then everyone’s happy.’
‘What’s wrong, Baby Boy?’ the mercenary comes up to him, holding his shoulders in gentle hands.
‘Steve?’ he hears Bucky call as the rumbling stops and the powdery ice settles around them. Its pitch black.
‘You let me and my squad go, you don’t send anyone after us. And you give us a week headstart.’
‘Those are Jotun runes,’ he says, coming close to the image floating above Tony’s screen. ‘But what are they doing on Midgard? Unless they are left over from Jotunheim’s conquests? Though that was centuries ago, before Thor or I were even born. I’d be surprised if they had remained undiscovered for this long.’
‘More like screaming, but yes it is,’ he replies. ‘I’ve made a few more modifications to it this afternoon, just to improve accuracy and stuff. But it’s still the same gun.’
‘Thank you, Pool,’ he says, cutting off the merc.
Tony’s too terrified to even rest his eyes. Not that he’ll ever admit that out loud. After the video call earlier, and Hammer’s threat, he’s too worried to close his eyes in case he loses the opportunity to defend himself against the guards. He just hopes Natasha understands his message and the team finds him soon.
‘So are you Tony’s secret weapon or something? Wanda asks as they move quickly and quietly along the main corridor towards the auditorium. She’s impressed just how quietly the guy can move.
‘Yes but he tried to kill you, multiple times,’ Natasha points out.
‘I think whoever you got to look over them has done a pretty good job, Tony. But you have to get Secretary Ross to agree to them, not to mention a committee-’
Taking out a flash drive she plugs it into the main computer and gets to work, constantly checking the security cameras as she works.
Steve’s about to ask something else when he notices a group of small portraits on the opposite wall. He feels tears burning at his eyes as he walks past the other two and takes in the familiar faces of his first team. Each of them has their name underneath, then a larger plaque beneath them all:
‘And what? Send us into the middle of a fight with no preparation and no plan?’ Strange raises a challenging eyebrow. ‘Might I suggest we return to your facility and organise who will be joining us on this rescue mission and who will be staying behind? Should we not also notify Fury?’
‘You know the taxi driver too?’ Tony raises an eyebrow at him.
Peter just laughs and runs his hands up Wade’s chest, letting one rest on his shoulder while the other runs over the skin of his head. ‘Please don’t disappear again,’ he says, brown eyes soft and pleading.
‘Hoping you might actually follow one for once,’ Steve says, and Tony manages to focus enough to see tears in those blue eyes.
‘Ok how come she’s Wanda and I’m Miss Natasha? Are you saying I’m old, kid?’
Strange tries to contain one of her arms with a glowing rope, but Wanda can see the power Agatha is sucking from him through the restraint and he releases the spell with a grunt of frustration. ‘We’re going to have to be smart rather than powerful,’ he says to her.
at school. I’ve got all these powers, these abilities, and I just let those things happen to my friend when I should be
Steve pauses before replying, caught off guard with the topic of the conversation. ‘I don’t hold anything against you for it,’ he says carefully, ‘not anymore, not after you got everyone back together.’
A/N: Hi everyone. An actual update on time this week! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I think this is one of my favourite ones to have written so far to date. I had the image of Peter facing Thanos with Venom in my head for so long as I was so happy to finally be able to write it.
‘Am I interrupting a date?’
of you. Maybe the link was making you feed off each other’s frustration and hurt and that made everything worse.’
‘So considering there’s no explosions I take it things are going well so far?’ the assassin asks as she enters the workshop.
‘Winter,’ Loki interrupts the suggestions from the other two. ‘I think I shall call him Winter.’
‘Wade, we don’t know what it’ll do to you.’
‘Thanks,’ Bucky smiles at him.
‘I wouldn’t say that was such a huge leap for someone of your apparent genius.’
been working,’ Natasha teases, leaving them all with a brief goodnight.
‘You want to know what I see when I look at this?’ he asks softly, resting two fingers over the bandages where a slight glow is showing through.
‘And just to be safe,’ Tony adds as he and Steve join them all, ‘I’ve put a special protocol in place so FRIDAY will intervene if it looks like it’s getting close to an accidental reveal.’
‘I was told to bring you here,’ the driver replies, ‘I don’t ask why. I’m not paid enough.’
‘A couple of hours at most,’ Thor replies, ‘and we will need supplies for the trip.’
Steve has to admit, that the expressions on everyone’s faces when they realise Tony has hired them out an ice rink for the Avengers’ private use after hours makes his discomfort about being around the ice worth it. There’s a bar attached to it, and Vision and Rhodes decide they’re not going to risk it on the ice and will watch from there: Rhodes because of his legs and Vision because he doesn’t trust the ice. Not that Steve can blame him. He promises to join them soon.
He decides against using his webs this time. If he’s going to beat Natasha he wants to do it on as equal a footing as possible.
‘You sure he’s not a long lost kid?’ Clint asks as he takes the empty spot next to her.
‘Oh good some more suicidal idiots,’ a talking rabbit comments.
‘You were supposed to wait until you could grab one of them!’ a British voice is saying.
‘Shit,’ Tony curses, running a hand through his hair.
‘Oh yeah. Oops. Sorry, Doc.’ Strange waves him off and Tony notices the weariness in the doctor’s movements. ‘Steve? Grab the doc a chair would you?’
‘Don’t worry big guy,’ the red-head pats his arm, ‘we still love you.’
‘Why would you tell me?’
when they realised what they’d done. Think Stewart wanted to take me to hospital but May talked him down and put me into bed then went to talk to the other boys. I got bored though so climbed up on the roof.’
doubt it.’
‘If you know him as well as I think you do, you should know he’s not going to care what you look like. He cares about you. I’m slightly concerned just how
‘No I don’t think they were initially. I think, when I shut it down, perhaps they found a few stragglers and convinced them to continue the work. In which case I didn’t do as good a job shutting the fuckers down as I thought, so this is my mess to clean up. Only…’
Peter laughs. ‘Are you six again or something?’ Her response is just to stick her tongue out at him.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘So,’ Tony grins, ‘do we want to watch a movie or would you rather start on the plans for the Long Island house?’
‘You are a bad man Tony Stark,’ Rhodes says, following the other three and leaving Tony grinning against the railing.
‘Tell him not to bother I’ll go to the Sanctum and see Strange, let everyone else worry about the other guests that will be arriving.’
‘Tony!’ Rhodes has entered behind them and caught sight of his friend. ‘Hammer you bastard what the hell have you done to him?’
‘You think I don’t know that?’ his friend demands, ducking back behind one of the cars. ‘We can’t get through this shooting, there’s no break in it.’
‘Peter….pleasssse,’ Venom hisses in urgency.
‘You’re only ever allowed to sleep in my bed from now on.’
‘You guys want breakfast?’ Tony asks them, trying and probably failing miserably to keep the grin off of his face. He’d even managed to keep this a surprise from Steve.
‘Oh no,’ Sam says. ‘No way not with you and him on the team,’ he gestures to Bucky. ‘We’ll all be flat as pancakes within two minutes.’
‘Thor we are not doing a hunt and that is final!’ Loki shouts over his shoulder as he walks over to the teenager. ‘Take it off the heat but make sure you keep stirring otherwise it’ll go solid.’
When he starts to pull away Peter makes a noise of protest, tightening arms around the man’s neck and jumping up to follow the man’s mouth, using his wall crawling abilities to hold onto Wade’s shoulders, and wrapping his legs around his waist. Wade stumbles back a couple of steps, but quickly steadies them and continues to kiss him. It’s deep and ferocious, and full of emotion, much like the man himself.
‘I think they’d be safer with a guard dog,’ Peter mumbles before sleep finally claims them both.
‘It’s made from the same stuff as my arc reactor,’ he explains, taking the ring from the box and turning it so Steve can see. ‘There’s also something similar to a very mini reactor in there. Press this small button here and it can light up, so if you ever get stuck anywhere you’ve always got a light. Press it again and it’ll set off a signal so we can come find you. I just…’ he trails off, not meeting Steve’s eyes at his soft confession, ‘I didn’t want to risk losing you. And you know how I am with commitment so it’s also a promise to stick around. I mean not a permanent, but a-’ his nervous rambling is cut off by Steve pining him to the bed and kissing him hard, big hands coming up to gently frame his face.
Hammer’s laugh startles most of them. ‘Oh ho! I must admit, Anthony, if I knew it was going to be this entertaining I would have done this call so much earlier. Tell me: just how long have those two been fighting over you?’
‘Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are already on their way there now; Miss Maximoff and Vision are just getting up from the sofas; Agent Romanoff is coming up from the gym; Mr Wilson and Colonel Rhodes are currently off the facility.’
Peter snorts. ‘They are so not over each other.’
‘I don’t think I
‘Tony, what is-’
Loki gives her a wry smile. ‘We deemed it prudent to reach a truce and both caught the other at the same time. Though we’re not divulging that information to the group at large as we’re not sure if it would be classed as cheating.’
‘Shuri this is no time to be complaining about my footwear,’ T’Challa sighs and rolls his eyes. ‘How is Vision doing?’
Here's your sneak peek at the next chapter:
‘What the hell?’ Peter frowns. ‘What are you talking about?’
‘I promised I’d tell you another time,’ he says, still keeping eye contact, well mask contact. The merc stands up and lifts his hand. For a heart-stopping moment Peter thinks the merc is going to put it on his face, then he drops it onto his shoulder.
Tony reaches the front door just as May Parker pulls to a stop. Peter scrambles out of the door and runs up to give Tony a hug. ‘Merry Christmas Mr Stark!’
Thanks again for all the support,
Agatha pulls her magic to her fingertips and grins at Wanda. Then the grin falls away and she looks back at her hands, snapping her fingers again. Nothing happens.
‘Shit, fuck, bastard,’ Wade curses softly behind her. ‘I’d know that fucker’s voice anywhere.’
‘Considering Wanda has been giggling since they arrived, but will not tell me the reason behind it, and Peter has been blushing just as long I’d wager that the topic of their conversation has to do with Peter’s love life and Wanda has just discovered something about it he doesn’t want shared,’ Vision says, entering behind them with a sigh.
‘Perhaps it already has,’ the blond responds, copying the gesture.
‘Wade meet Wanda. Wanda this is Wade,’ he says it as casually as he can, trying to keep the smile from his lips as he straightens up. The merc’s face goes from suspicious, to shocked, to terror all in the space of a couple of seconds and Peter takes pity on him, going to stand next to him and putting a hand on his arm. They’re trying not to draw attention to the fact they’re together whilst in the bar so it’s the most physical touch Peter can allow himself.
‘You wouldn’t shut up about the stupid thing so we’re coming and doing it so we can see what the big deal is.’
‘All except the old Expo site,’ he nods, ‘I’ll go to the others first and then head over there. Now how about we stop talking shop and actually chill a bit? You look ready to drop, Baby Boy.’
‘Won’t know if you don’t try,’ Tony says, raising his glass for the other man to meet. ‘What’s eating you, Barnes?’
Loki appears to be struggling to process what he’s seeing so Bucky chooses to stay silent; he does move a few steps along when asked though.
‘I’m not leaving until I know what’s happened to Deadpool,’ Peter can feel his irritation rising. ‘And you are not going to be able to make me leave.’
‘Oh no you don’t,’ the red head replies, coming to sit next to her. ‘I’m not letting you walk out of here beating yourself up or you’ll never come back in. Come on lets go through some of the more basic stuff again.’
‘Clint? Get a bit lower, I’m going to get a boost and be with you,’ Natasha says.
‘Merry Christmas, Steve. Merry Christmas Tony!’ Peter says again, bouncing on the bottom of the bed. ‘Come on get up! Wanda and Vision are already up making hot drinks for everyone. They sent me off to get everyone up.’
‘You hear that Gabe married Peggy in the end?’
know if something does go wrong.’
Peter just nods and goes to his room, closing the door behind him while Tony explains to May Parker just what happened.
‘Or not if you feel like following Mommy Spider’s advice. Go on dates, preferably with girls whose fathers don’t end up trying to steal my stuff and kill you if I’m honest. All the stuff you’re supposed to do as a teenager. And yeah maybe you won’t do all the crazy stuff I did at your age-’
Tony soaks in every second of the car ride as he drives Peter to school ready for his trip to Europe. They talk about the different places the group are going to visit, and he suggests some places that Peter and his friends should check out if they get chance.
Tony salutes the doctor and grins. ‘You got it, doc.’
Tony chuckles, not able to stop the fond smile at the mention of his boyfriend. ‘Yeah. Still not sure what he sees in me, but honestly? I stopped complaining when I realised it was a stupid idea: didn’t want him to realise what a mistake he was making.’
‘Merry Christmas, Dad,’ he replies, then allows himself to be dragged away by Wade.
as well as Tony,’ she snaps. ‘I couldn’t live with myself if you got hurt whilst we were trying to save him. And you can bet anything that Tony would have my hide if I let you come along. If you’re there Pete he’ll be too distracted keeping you safe to focus on getting out. We can’t risk that. Understand?’ He frowns but nods. She stands up to leave and he scrambles to his feet. ‘Don’t stop what you’re doing now though, you’ve made more progress than we have. Seems you’ve got some good contacts, Spider-Man.’
interesting ways of getting me to stop talking.’
‘I think you’ll be better off finding a more recent example, seeing as we weren’t even together then if you want to run with this, Steve.’
‘Stalling?’ Tony knows that Vision doesn’t mean it to be accusatory, but he hears it anyway. Feels as though that’s all he’s been hearing recently. ‘What is it that’s making you not want to call?’
Mama cackles. ‘That’s true, but I still know when to stop.’
‘Better run along, Wade. We’re running off somewhere you’d never think to look for us. That is, of course,’ he pauses to scoff a laugh, ‘if you can get out of here.’
‘What?’ she’s genuinely confused by his statement.
‘Starting to feel a bit offended here, Steve,’ Tony mock-pouts. ‘You saying you’d rather spend time with Hydra than with me?’
‘Hey,’ Sam greets him and Bucky as soon as they walk in through the front door, ‘you guys better come into the living room and hear this.’
.’ She turns to Steve. ‘I’ll deal with the Council and then I’m calling Scott and Clint.’
‘Vis, how many times do I have to tell you: just because the door is open doesn’t mean you can go through the wall?’ Tony grumbles.
‘Just as long as there isn’t some crude interpretation of me on a cave wall then I’ll be happy,’ he grumbles. ‘You have no idea how much the Warriors Three loved that their interpretations were always much grander than mine. Although I’ll never forget when we learned about the story of Sif’s hair: that was rather amusing.’
Now he only has one person left.
‘He likes restricting what students can get hold of. Until he met me.’
T'Challa and Thor have some farewells to make before joining the rest of the team
‘And you’re not worried about sending two Avengers into a situation we don’t have the full intel on? Didn’t you once chew me out over not giving you all the information on a mission I sent you on?’ Fury challenges.
‘He is right though,’ Wanda says. ‘Shouldn’t the police be dealing with it?’
‘Want to bet?’ comes a furious tone from just in front of him, and Peter has never been so happy to see Bucky Barnes in his life. Though the look on his face is murderous and has him shuffling to the side of the sidewalk next to Ned, who’s knelt down next to his friend.
‘I’ll keep him distracted,’ Tony flies in front of the alien just as he manages to get the webbing off of his face and fires repulsor shots into its face. ‘Come on Frankenstein, take your best shot,’ he says, weaving in front of it and continuing to fire repulsors at its face.
Steve finds he can’t form words around the lump in his throat as Rhodes stands up to leave, patting his shoulder as he does and leaving the super soldier with his thoughts.
‘What?’ Steve frowns as Tony pulls away obviously confused. ‘No. I was asking what training he’s been doing without the suit. He needs something to fall back on if he doesn’t have it.’
He activates the suit and has the mask dragged back to reveal his face; staring straight at Wanda he lets himself sink into a memory, knowing if this doesn’t work to break her control then nothing will.
‘Your ability to control the weather you mean?’ Wanda asks.
Tony gets there first, unleashing what looks like the majority of his arsenal at the alien, before being flung to the side, leaving an opening for Steve to ram his shield up into Thanos’ chin with all of his strength. He ducks under a swing from the alien’s sword and Thor jumps in, new axe fully charged and sending all of them flying backwards from the force of it.
‘You were the one who bought the giant tree,’ he grumbles, heading back downstairs to collect even more bags from the car. ‘Have you seriously not got
‘Well I’m not going to be voting for you to win any beauty contests,’ comes the reply, ‘but it’s not going to put me off my dinner.’ When Wade opens his mouth to argue, Tony cuts him off. ‘Look, this isn’t about any of that. What I am asking you is: do you want to spend Christmas with Spider-Man?’
‘Fury’s been told,’ Natasha responds, ‘he’s on his way to the facility now. And you’re right we do need to work out who’s coming and who’s staying. Someone needs to be here to stay in contact with Wanda and Vision, be ready for when Wade gets back and to make sure we can deal with Ross if needed.’
‘I don’t know him like you do, Pete,’ he replies. ‘But I won’t hide the fact I worry about you spending time with someone who is borderline insane.’
‘Perfect. Think you can hold that stuff up a little longer while I try and clear a hole for everyone?’
Tony finally looks up at him and Steve's heart breaks. There's so much pain in those brown eyes that he does the only thing he can do. Steve reaches up, cupping one of the bloodied cheeks with his hand, running his thumb over the dry, chapped lips.
‘What the hell?’ he asks out loud, finally opening his eyes. ‘What the fuck is he doing here?’
Peter is one of the last ones to reach the common area that morning, and as he walks in he’s greeted by the sight of Natasha tending to a cut on Bucky’s forehead.
‘Tony-’
Tony shrugs and looks down where he’s resting a palm on Steve’s chest. ‘Probably before MIT. At first it was fitting in with college life, then it was the parties and alcohol, then it was the nightmares…’ He trails off and looks back into blue eyes. ‘What about you?’
‘What? I’m not allowed to think about my boyfriend pulling off the rugged tough guy look?’
‘Is there anything we can do, Tony?’ Steve asks. ‘You’re doing so much for us, there must be something we can do in return?’
a killer. And that’s why Beck…that’s why his illusions…’
‘How about we think about redecorating
Disorientated Tony pushes himself up to see the alien lumbering towards them, his hammer back in his hand, and lifting it up to swing it down. Only one of them is getting out of this unscathed, Tony realises, and gets his gauntlet ready to blast Peter out of the way when suddenly the alien freezes.
‘As the bond is still so fresh they cannot be too far apart. As their minds stabilise they will be able to move greater distances until they could be entire worlds away with no adverse effects. For the first twenty four hours at least, they will not be able to be more than a few feet away from each other.’
‘Hey you alright?’ Peter asks next to her, bringing her out of her thoughts.
‘Alright.’
‘We didn’t take into account the fact you’re keeping your identity secret,’ Tony continues, ‘when we invited your school here, and we should have done. We didn’t think about what the impact could be on you. In our defence our resident mind reader is on a study vacation in Kamar-Taj until this weekend.’
‘Honestly it’s as if she doesn’t trust my ability to hold my own in a fight,’ he huffs to himself.
‘Venom was taken by HYDRA,’ he cuts across Sam. ‘He may have seen or heard something whilst he was being held that could be useful. He may have learnt something when he briefly took over that guard when he escaped. But we won’t know unless I go back into his memories and I can’t do that without help.’
Bucky lifts his flesh hand to his face and finally feels the tears falling. ‘Huh.’ Then he tells Steve the story of the mural.
He leaves her to think over his words as he joins the others, a couple of tears threatening to fall.
Sam looks over to where the others are decorating the trees that line the path from the facility to where the table is situated. Peter’s balancing on Wade’s shoulders to put the lights up, while Tony does the same on Steve’s shoulders opposite; Valkyrie and Natasha are a couple of trees back putting on some ornaments that will withstand the weather, and Loki appears to be studying one of the first ones with an assessing look. Then he lifts his hands and sends a covering of ice over the tree, only enough so that it seems to glisten in the sunlight. ‘Wow,’ Sam whistles. ‘It looks beautiful.’
‘Wha-’
‘The scary thing is I know you’re completely serious,’ Deadpool mutters, then sighs. ‘My name’s Wade, by the way. Wade Wilson.’ Peter’s face breaks into a grin, which only grows when the merc reaches up to grip at his mask. He pauses again, and Peter lets his grin slip to a smaller, more encouraging smile.  ‘Don’t say I didn’t fucking warn you,’ Wade grumbles and takes the mask off.
‘Kid you got the wizard yet?’
‘All ready to go Thor?’ Natasha asks him as she reaches them.
Thank you so much to everyone who has come so far on this journey with me, I hope you continue to enjoy it as we get closer towards Thanos' arrival. Hope you all have a lovely Easter!
‘Do I want to know why you needed us at a Christmas tree seller?’ Tony asks, stepping out of the suit and letting it close up behind him. Rhodes stays in his, the suit giving his legs and back extra support.
‘He’s probably going to give me more grey hairs than being Iron Man ever did,’ Tony quips, trying to find some steady ground.
‘Not yet. Was going to call him next. We’ll get everyone organised and wait to hear from you. If we don’t hear anything we’ll head to the Sanctum and come find you. Wouldn’t it be better for Pete to meet you there?’ she asks.
‘You didn’t think to give it to me before?’
Finally Mama releases Wade’s face and gives his cheek a soft pat. ‘You’re a good man, Wade Wilson, if a little lost right now.’
He turns and reaches up to cup Steve’s face with one hand, pressing a kiss to the soft lips. ‘One more call and I promise you I’ll make it quick. No more than ten minutes tops.’
‘Oh you are such a baby.’
Tony follows the rest of the team inside, noticing that everyone is a little more subdued than normal. It seems Thor and Valkyrie’s departure has driven home just how soon they may be facing Thanos.
‘What’s your excuse Reindeer Games?’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘I still love you.’
‘Vision?’ Steve asks quietly, as the conversation at the table starts up. ‘Where did Wanda take Sharon?’
‘Because,
‘Yeah well I’m not a genius. I can’t fix…
Wade fidgets, then takes a seat on the sofa opposite Steve, looking down at his interlinking fingers when he answers. ‘I need someone to come with me.’
(See the end of the chapter for
’ Steve repeats. ‘As in the owner of Stark Industries Tony Stark?’
‘Ok you’ve made your point,’ he grumbles.
‘So long story short I may have been tinkering with my web shooters in the workshop to see if I could put in a function with more power and I swear I thought I had it right and I asked FRIDAY to run loads of tests and everything, so I thought I’d come and try them out and they… well they kind of exploded and when I tried to come up and get rid of them I…err well I may have got a bit tangled up in the webs and…well you can see.’
‘But-’
Peter is in a bad mood all day. He can’t focus properly in lessons and gets pulled up by the teachers a couple of times each lesson, meaning he’s on the edge of getting a detention. He’s short with his friends, and by the end of the day even Ned isn’t trying to engage him in conversation. They say goodbye on the steps with MJ telling him to ‘lighten up’ before tomorrow or she’ll kick his ass.
‘Not unless other magic was involved,’ Wong replies, ‘but you would be able to sense that was present.’
‘I’ve been ready the past five minutes,’ he tells her. ‘I’ll check the back door. Go!’
‘My birthday is 6
‘You stay with Karen, Foggy,’ the man named Matt says, ‘I think we’ve abandoned her enough tonight. Peter, was it? Peter can take me. I’m sure he’s not going to lead me off a cliff or anything.’
‘Yes, but I don’t want to get there too quickly. We’ll just be sitting ducks if we do; plus if the Jotuns are able to sense us somehow we’ll just be drawing them closer to where Loki and Tony are going to be, and I’d rather see if we can take one or two of them out before they reach their intended targets.’
of them,’ Tony growls, ‘and I’ll make sure you die a slow and
Sam is quiet for a while, and Peter wonders if the man is actually going to help him or just watch him suffer. ‘I think,’ he says eventually, ‘that you’ll know when the best time to bring it up is, Peter, and I’d suggest waiting until you know it’s not something that’s going to fizzle out soon afterwards if you’re so worried about his reaction. I’d also suggest you get him alone and you tell him about being worried that he’ll be disappointed, as well as how you feel about this guy. I’d also say maybe explain to him how you two ended up together. It might surprise you how accepting he can be, especially when it comes to you.’
There’s a multitude of hands that go up, and the Headmaster is the one choosing the people; Peter is looking nervous again.
‘Francis figured something out about you, didn’t he Wade?’ Bucky asks, tone quiet and what Peter could only call encouraging. ‘Right at the end in the warehouse when you were fighting.’
He’s about to respond when he feels a warning from in front of him and dodges to the side, lashing out with a leg that passes straight through his new opponent.
‘Oh but Peter she is right,’ May laughs. ‘I mean just look at everything with Liz, and now-’
He’s tried to bribe Natasha into faking an emergency call out, but she refused. He even tried speaking to FRIDAY, but the AI hadn’t granted his wish. He’s avoiding Bucky like the plague as his friend has been doing nothing but winding him up about the dance all day, Sam isn’t much better, Vision tried to be helpful and give him tips but it just brought him to the edge of a panic attack. The only person who had been sympathetic was Peter, but the kid was on crowd duty and so Steve couldn’t grab him until after the speeches. By which time it was going to be too late. He’d thought about speaking to Rhodes, but the man was giving the speech from the Avengers and was nervous himself, and Wanda was feeling paranoid about being around so many people.
‘Yeah, please,’ he says, eyes scanning the information that flashes onto the screens. ‘All of this is looking at modifying crops and things on a large scale, none of it is small scale…’
‘You’d have thought after last time we’d have learned not to try and keep stuff from each other,’ he laughs.
‘I am Groot,’ comes the reply from the tree next to him, who is playing on a games console similar to one Thor has seen Peter play on.
‘What’s that?’ Bruce points at what Rocket is turning over in his paws.
‘Hey Karen can you let Mr Stark know I’m on my way?’
‘What did Bucky do this time?’ Rhodes sighs.
‘Mr Stark,’ the Japanese representative, Mr Aizama, interjects, ‘you cannot honestly expect us to readily agree to allow all of the renegade Avengers to return?’
‘Will you allow my people and Loki to stay here? And protect them until I return?’
. He didn’t understand it’s power any more than we do,’ Tony pulls the teenager into a one-armed hug. ‘This is one of the many reasons I keep you around.’
‘I never thought anything would be more irritating than Thor’s attempts at singing, but the so called music your stores play in December wins the competition,’ the trickster grumbles.
‘Came back early,’ she tells him and he pulls away, ‘and Shuri’s with me too.’
‘You already had an escape plan?’ Wanda asks. ‘Why didn’t you tell us?’
They try and resolve their argument through wrestling. No surprises when it ends in a draw. They decide to take a break and go to sit on the benches where they’ve left their water bottles, Steve wipes at his face and neck with his towel and leans back against the wall behind them, his thoughts wandering in the quiet room.
Natasha smiles. ‘He has a way of making people feel good about themselves,’ she says, ‘but-’
‘I’ll explain in a minute,’ is the answer the soldier gets. ‘I’ve got someone who has apparently appeared from a different dimension, along with some of his enemies, but I don’t trust him, and I need someone I trust to work alongside him.’
‘Might I suggest,’ Loki interrupts, ‘that we save the catching up for another time and get out of here before reinforcements arrive?’
‘No. Bastard made me think he could, but ended up not being able to do shit.’
Harry shakes his head. ‘Let’s talk about it another time, yeah? I don’t want to start this trip off talking about my dad and bringing the tone down.’
Shut it idiots.
small, and also really big. And Hope’s is super cool because she can fly as well. Plus she’s generally more kick ass than Scott, just don’t tell him I said that. I mean tell Hope, but not Scott. That’s his daughter Cassie in the picture with them, she’s pretty cool too.’
Tony sees the answer on Strange’s face before he answers and feels his heart sink in sympathy. ‘You could have done better,’ he answers for the doctor, ‘couldn’t you?’
A/N: Hi everyone! Sorry I'm a bit late I've been trying to get a couple of chapters into this year's Christmas story so I could post the first one today. I'll be doing that right after posting this.
‘Alright kids I need you to get out of here. Find a classroom, barricade the door and hide under some desks until the situation is under control, alright?’ Deadpool says, coming up and kneeling down to check on the man. ‘He’ll be fine, he’s just injured.’
‘Uh oh,’ Rhodes says, ‘he’s gone into his “I’m-frozen-while-I-think-of-something” stance. Brace yourself boys.’
‘And finally? Anyone asks if you know me? Say no,’ Clint finishes.
‘I don’t care how annoying he was, he can’t be that bad because he hasn’t got Hulk out yet.’
Natasha sees the flash of pain on Tony’s face and opens her mouth to intervene.
‘Take it that’s our cue to sleep, right Baby Boy?’
‘FRIDAY, has the Black Panther and the group from Kamar-Taj arrived yet?’ he asks the AI.
Let me know what you think.
‘You mean run in all guns blazing?’
Although I do have to make a huge apology: one of my readers on FF.net pointed out I'd been spelling Rumlow's name wrong the whole way through the first two chapters. I'm changing it on all future ones first and then I'll go back and edit the previous ones. Sorry everyone! And big thank you to Silvertikal for pointing it out.
‘So someone who was also at the prison to make sure everything went to plan. Probably also the same person who caused a distraction by trying to get Bucky under his control, which I imagine would have gone very differently for us had he actually managed to get the brain washing to work, and then may have hinted to me that he knew about my feelings for Steve. Something that he only would have known about had he seen a certain interaction between me and Bucky from our surveillance. One that I now know was copied and sent on to someone. Tell me I’m getting close, Justin, come on.’ He smirks at his former rival, whose eyes have suddenly gone wide. ‘Wouldn’t also be someone who has been trying to get this team under his control as long as we’ve been separate from SHIELD? Wouldn’t also happen to be someone who is now pressing for enhanced individuals to be registered? I imagine so he can build his own team to fight us?’
‘Much appreciated,’ Nick nods, then heads towards his own car with a wave at the others. T’Challa and Okoye had already left that morning to return to Wakanda, the king wanting to ensure that his people were ready for whatever might come their way.
‘Stop it,’ Natasha nudges him, ‘can’t you see he’s already turning green? Don’t make him more nervous than he already is.’ She smiles at Steve. ‘Don’t worry I’ve read the speech. You’ll be fine.’
‘You’re not denying it though,’ he points out.
It’s Vision who asks the question most people have been avoiding. ‘I hope you do not think me rude,’ he says, ‘but what happened to get your scars?’
‘Never underestimate my powers of persuasion, Capsicle.’ Tony closes his eyes and leans back, imagining for a second the other man is here in the room with him and they were back to how they were before the Accords. ‘Steve, do you want to come home?’ Suddenly he doesn’t have the energy to dance around the question.
‘Oh come on it’s only us,’ Wanda says, ‘its good fun, Pete. Please?’
‘No, listen to me,
to talk to me because Captain America knew who I was, no we can’t move on. We are not moving on.’
Vision pulls the tearful girl away as Natasha kneels next to the prone boy, checking his pulse. She looks up at Steve, relief clear in her face. ‘He’s alive, just unconscious. Any news on Tony?’
‘Sorry, Frosty, but there are a lot of presents here. I sent yours back though,’ Wade says, putting his armful of presents down by the tree.
‘Don’t make me regret it, Wilson,’ Tony growls.
‘All clear, Bucky, I’m just dealing with a couple as you turn left.’
When he next opens them he’s alone and lying sideways on the sofa and someone’s put a blanket over him.
I hope you continue to enjoy my writing.
‘We have one,’ Mama says, ‘that covers Christmas Eve through Boxing Day.’
‘I’m not sure I can get drunk,’ Bucky says with a dark smile, ‘I know Steve can’t. I assume they used similar stuff on me.’
‘Agreed,’ Natasha says, cutting off any more discussion. ‘It’s the best option we have for now.’
‘Plus I’ve left instructions with Pepper that if anything needs my signature with SI then you can give FRIDAY permission to add it to any files. You’re basically my stand in while we’re away,’ Tony adds.
‘So I have to do as I’m told for once?’
Tony stops, he sees the warning look Vision gives him, and turns, lifting the face plate and stalking back towards Ross. ‘I don’t need this suit to take you apart, Ross,’ he growls at the other man. ‘When you were just attacking me I took it and let you play your games. Now you’ve gone after my team. You want a war? You better be prepared to lose.’ He turns to the guards who are looking very pale. ‘I want that list of prisoners sent over to me within three days. Understood?’ The only reply he gets is two nods.
come from?’ Steve looks at him completely confused.
‘This is absolutely
‘Why are we still watching this?’ Tony asks as Rhodes turns the volume back up on the chat show once Wanda and Vision are out of the room.
I hope you've enjoyed it and thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos. I will be sitting down and responding to everything in the next few days, I thought it was best to get all the chapters written and up first.
‘Yeah they said Cap would never have survived without you to take out the people he was too busy catching his Frisbee to notice.’
‘Yeah and I get more than enough core workouts from Cap, thanks all the same.’
‘I’ll make it mandatory.’
‘He’s
‘Hey, it’s alright, we’re here,’ he rubs her back soothingly.
‘And more besides. You were right when you told her in the Raft that her ledger is gushing blood, and she did it to try and prove to them that she was loyal.’
‘But I’m warning you,’ he continues as he walks towards Peter, ‘I’m not going easy on you just because it’s your-’
‘Step away from our friend,’ Steve growls, tightening the straps of his shield.
‘It looks like one of the husky breeds,’ Tony adds, ‘they’re used to pull sleds in places like Alaska. They’re one of the hardier breeds.’
‘Shame the Guardians couldn’t be here, or Carol.’
Steve grins. ‘I won’t tell
‘Come on,’ Peter says to his friends and half runs down the aisle and down the steps. ‘Nat!’ he runs and gives her a hug, causing the assassin to let out an ‘oomph’ and a laugh. ‘I thought you were still in Wakanda until the weekend?’
His friend gives him a grin. ‘No need. I’ve got an override code.’
‘He’s probably about the same as you,’ Tony tells him, giving the dark haired man’s hand a squeeze. ‘Come on, Elsa, I thought you were supposed to control the ice.’
‘Pretty sure I also called you a drama queen,’ he chuckles.
‘Clint stand down and let us explain,’ Steve says, putting his hands up.
I've had a few requests for a WinterIron story so I'm having a few thoughts about how to do that. It would be separate from this series, but I've got the start of an AU idea in my head that I might make into WinterIron. For now I'm working on the next special which is set after this story finishes, and will then go on to the sequel for this one.
‘Aw man,’ Sam grumbles, then eyes the spy suspiciously. ‘How did
‘Sam and Bucky are looking at everything we’ve got and seeing if we can pinpoint a place. Considering how many soldiers they had shown up in such a short space of time, they have to be fairly close. Vision’s seeing what he can get from surveillance with FRIDAY. But neither of them is able to track Tony.’
‘Is this fairytale real?’ Morgan asks.
‘Get a life, Flash,’ Peter grumbles, pushing Ned past the boys and heading down the street. ‘Come on, Ned.’
I'm going to go post that second chapter now.
Anyway back to summarising. Before she threatens to have my Baby Boy run off with someone else. ‘But Mr Pool’ I hear you say, ‘you aren’t foreshadowing there are you? Surely not!’ All I can say people: the author can be a bitch. Seriously don’t believe her when she says she’s sorry for the horrible shit she puts us poor defenceless characters through. Sadistic.
‘Yeah,’ Wade’s voice is more subdued this time, ‘they’ve been more successful this time. HYDRA’s going to have their own army of mutants.’
‘Are they always like this? They’ve got worse since the last time,’ Matt groans.
the door opens and Tony steps through into the old kitchen. As the team files in behind him, some of them going back out for the boxes of food, he has to fight off the swarm of memories that flood him as he looks around the old kitchen. He can almost hear Ana’s scolding at how much dust and dirt he’s allowed to gather on her work surfaces, and moaning at the fact the salt cellar had been knocked off the shelf, spilling its contents onto the table and down onto the floor. If he closes his eyes he can smell dinner in the oven and hear Jarvis’ rhythmic slice and thud as he chops vegetables for Ana.
‘Go for it,’ he tells her, standing up. ‘Where are they? Let’s see if we can get closer.’
‘Not in corporeal form I don’t,’ he huffs.
‘I am by no means a great healer,’ he responds, trying to shake himself from his shock, ‘but I may be able to work with the technology you speak of to increase the healing benefit. However my magic is returning slowly after my injury, the amount required for this sort of spell would be greater than what I could safely perform now.’
A/N: Hey everyone! I hope you enjoyed the Wanda and Wade meet. Do let me know what you think, I'd be interested to know what you feel about her being the first of the team to officially meet him as Peter's partner.
in getting drunk, trust me when I say you will want to go to sleep.’
‘You’re dating
Tony smirks. ‘I’ve never trusted you, Ross. I made sure the others were always covered any time they left the facility so you couldn’t try and pull anything on them. Trust issues a mile wide, that’s one of my failings I’m afraid. So every time I step outside the facility I’ve had FRIDAY record every second of it. Including today.’
‘Do you not understand the meaning of the phrase “fuck off” now or something?’ Tony’s voice is still quiet, he’s sitting on the end of the bed, still wearing what he came off the ship in, staring down at his hands.
‘No,’ Rhodes’ tone is final for which Tony is eternally grateful. Although the raccoon is a lot of fun to have in the workshop, he does not look forwards to seeing what he can come up with to cause trouble for the team. He’s scary enough when it’s directed at their enemies.
‘Everything alright boys?’
Bucky takes a deep breath, and pulls down the barrier he has put up between their link. He’s flooded with Loki’s emotions, and knows the trickster is drinking in his own. They stand facing each other, foreheads touching and eyes closed as they don’t need to use words to tell each other what they’re feeling.
‘Alright kids, I’ve linked us up with the Warden in the control room. You guys head on out and I’ll make sure the jet is all locked up so we don’t have someone running away with our stuff.’
‘I’ve tried to convince him before but he won’t-’
‘She was Aunt Peggy wasn’t she?’ Rhodes asks, coming over to sit next to his friend. ‘She’s the one who used to send you all those food packages during college.’
‘Vision!’ Wanda screams, her magic wrapping around him and pulling him back towards them.
going on,’ the scientist admits.
told you.’
‘I take it none of us are allowed to say beating Thanos right?’ he asks.
‘We’d better get a move on,’ Tony sighs, making a face when Steve grabs both bags. ‘I am capable of carrying my own luggage you know.’
‘Pepper may know something,’ Tony muses, ‘I’ll ask her next time we speak. From what I remember from the media reports at the time he turned up and started going down the whole charity-hand out wagon that had his business partners spitting feathers.’
Just before they hit the ground he’s able to fire the repulsors and right them, kicking out at Proxima and grabbing hold of Vision, allowing them to land fairly gently on the ground, their enemy staggering to her feet a way in front of them. Tony eases Vision to the ground before planting himself between him and Proxima.
is something I didn’t think I’d be seeing today.’ He goes to Thor’s side. ‘How you doing big guy?’
Natasha studies him for a moment and then nods. ‘Alright. So these are all places of high activity?’
‘No,’ he lengthens the vowel. ‘Why would you think that?’ His face is a picture of wide-eyed innocence.
‘What news
Do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see from the characters or stories and I hope you continue to enjoy reading this :)
‘Traitor,’ Tony frowns and looks down at his drink.
‘But that’s how you get some of the best sundaes ever!’ Ned tells him.
‘I wouldn’t advise testing it,’ she replies.
‘You are not the only one cursed with knowledge,’ Thanos replies, his grip on Lorena tightening.
‘Deadpool if you don’t take it off I’m webbing your hands to the wall and taking it off myself,’ Peter says, crossing his arms and hips forward like he does when they’re suited up and Deadpool’s annoying him.
‘That hasn’t worked for a while, Steve, you know that,’ she sighs.
‘You know Morita helped Fury a couple of times?’
Tony opens his mouth to thank Thor when he sees who the hammer flies back to.
‘What do you have to arrest him for anyway?’
do. Stop second guessing yourself and for once in your life let something good happen to you, alright?’
Steve just groans and tries to ignore his two friends laughing at him. Tony puts an arm around his waist and offers him a freshly brewed mug of coffee. ‘Look on the bright side, babe,’ he says, grinning up at him, ‘at least they know you didn’t disappoint.’
‘No, not yet.’
‘I hope your usual light tone means you do not hold us responsible for Secretary Ross’ actions yesterday?’ the Chinese representative asks.
be putting me into a jail cell for many
‘What? Why would you ask that?’
‘Bruce?’ Tony asks in surprise, looking at his friend.
‘But that would have killed you!’
‘You told me we couldn’t!’
‘Me?’ Steve asks.
‘So it’s man we’re looking for,’ Tony muses out loud, ‘obviously a man in a high position, most likely in the government seeing as you are adamant that I won’t be able to do anything about him doing what he likes.’ Hammer starts to look wary. ‘I mean it would also have to be someone who has shown they have some idea of everything you’ve already proven you know,’ he lazily looks over at Natasha, seeing her eyes widen very slightly which tells him she’s just realised what he’s already worked out.
Bucky grimaces and nods. ‘I’m fine, got a bit of pain when he started, but nothing more. He might not be alright if I get my hands on him though.’
Clint bursts out laughing. ‘You’re more concerned about that than the fact you’ve just seen him kissing
She laughs, a really freaky and horrible sound. ‘You would throw away the Mistress of Death, for a
When Tony’s managed to have a drink and stop coughing, he looks over at the young man, who is currently bouncing on his seat and looking like he wants to launch himself at him. Tony can’t help it, he reaches out a hand to the teenager. ‘Thank god you’re alright,’ he manages to get past his cracked lips.
‘Wait Star Spangled Banner Man is happy with you coming here and inviting me up for Christmas?!?’
She smiles at him in understanding and pats his knee. ‘Being home in itself solves a lot of problems, doesn’t it?’
‘Bucky why is this suddenly so important?’ Steve asks with a sigh from where he and Tony are sat on a sofa; Thor is in a chair opposite them and Sam is in another, the aforementioned soldier is the other side of the breakfast bar to him and Peter.
‘We’re facing the biggest threat any of us could imagine, Barton,’ Nick interrupts, ‘we need to make friends where we can.’
He sighs and goes to the sink to rinse out his now empty mug. ‘I just want things to be the way they were between us, Nat. But I’m not sure they can be. I think I betrayed him more than I realised.’
Do let me know what you think about these chapters, I hope you're enjoying the story. Do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see from any of the characters in the future and I shall see what I can come up with.
‘He wasn’t picking up last I tried,’ he sighs.
Tony huffs a laugh. ‘You’ll be pleased to hear you’re a couple of corridors away from him. I’ll get Steve to take him down to the training area and work away some of the excess energy.’
‘Oh I have plenty of concerns after today,’ Tony says as he stands up. ‘But I believe they are all with Ross, and I’ll take them up with him and the President.’ He gestures for Steve to stand up. ‘As for this Council I hope we can continue to work in a mutually beneficial arrangement as we have these past months.’
help with?’ Flash mutters. Peter frowns, flushing red again.
Tony sighs and rubs his temples with one hand. ‘We have until next Friday,’ he answers quietly. ‘If we’ve made enough progress I may be able to convince them to give us another week, possibly two.’
interruption,’ she clears her throat, then pauses and frowns, ‘part of me
‘I’m coming,’ Peter lands nimbly next to the soldier and takes hold of one of the ends, the two of them pulling back as hard as they can.
‘Well I know one thing, Stark,’ a voice says from behind him, ‘I’m still good enough to get past your security.’
‘Don’t try and tell me to stay home,’ he frowns. ‘I
your parents’ permission.’
‘I don’t feel cold,’ Steve admits, pulling him closer with the arm around his waist, ‘I didn’t feel the ice in my sleep.’ Then he surprises Tony by pulling him down for a kiss. ‘Thank you,’ he whispers against his lips as he pulls away a fraction.
‘No they can’t,’ Peter deadpans. ‘They are monstrosities that should never have existed in the first place. Why would you think ‘oh yay let’s talk about horror’ at Christmas anyway?’
‘I would say sorry to disappoint you, but I’m enjoying your pain too much,’ MJ tells him.
‘Well that was weird,’ Tony says as the two wizards disappear into the portal and it closes behind them. ‘He’s not going to keep opening portals in here is he? I’m not sure I can take it.’
‘He’ll be fine when he’s got his coffee,’ Tony waves a dismissive hand. ‘Besides I’ve got my own big bad super soldier to keep me from getting carried away.’
Deadpool claps a hand over his eyes and half turns away. ‘Stop talking, Spidey and put your mask back on. You
Then, OF COURSE, Peter and Tin Can have an argument, Tin Can gets captured and we spend ages trying to find him. Oh and by the way? Peter knows who Daredevil is. Still hasn’t told me when that happened or how. Oh wait! But me and Petey Pie actually get together as well! Although he’s not happy I’m all responsible adult about it.
‘Just take the number, Spidey. Even if you never use it, at least you know it’s an option,’ the teasing lilt is still there in the merc’s voice, but Peter can tell he’s nervous.
‘Course not, we get to use it against you
‘Wanda-’

time?’ Carol smirks.
Quill sighs. ‘I just can’t catch a break can I?’
‘I’m giving you a hand Tony,’ Natasha adds. ‘Wanda how long ago did he leave?’
‘Hang on,’ Ned’s mouth falls open, ‘are you going on a
‘He’s not my kid, and you deserved it,’ Tony responds from where he’s leaning against Steve’s side on the sofa, fiddling with a project on the tablet. ‘If you’re nice maybe he’ll take the webs off before they dissolve.’
