Tony is quiet, and Steve adds, “We’re going to be okay. I promise. I won’t let anything change what we have.”
Pepper sits up too. “I haven’t seen that. That’s very different. What happened to the ‘iconic look’?”
“Yeah. I’m just making dinner.” He stands back to allow Steve to come through the door. In the living room, Steve takes the chair in the corner, so Tony can sprawl over the sofa. “So what’s on your mind?”
“It wasn’t worth it,” Steve agrees, softly, and Tony’s heart billows. “If we’d stayed together as a team, we could’ve…”
He’s up late again, tinkering in the garage, and Pepper comes in. He’s used to being the one who stays awake through the night, but lately she’s been having trouble sleeping too. She’s extremely pregnant now, and it’s a wonderful sight, but also deeply terrifying, far more so than the dizzying void of space. A child,
“Wow, Ms Potts, you sure do have a lot of feelings on this subject,” Tony says, a little shocked and a little in awe, running his fingers through Pepper’s sunset-gold hair.
“Dammit, Tony,” Steve said, too angry to be embarrassed. He was so mad he didn’t even care that he was swearing, and he definitely did not want the image of star-spangled thongs in anyway associated with his thoughts of Tony. “This isn’t about you or some power-play. We’re a team, and I, the rest of the team, need to know that we can depend on you, and we can’t do that if you don’t follow orders!”
“Yes,” Steve said, resignedly, with his eyes still on the ground. It wasn’t a pretty summary, but it would suffice.
“You did?” Steve said, surprised. He tried to look through the panel separating him from the priest, but, of course, he could see nothing.
“Look, Steve, I like you. I think we could be good together, good for each other. But you need to get yourself figured out. I’m not going to be anyone’s gay experiment. Not yours. Not even Captain America.”
He still remembered going to mass with his mother and hearing Father Creagh giving a passionate sermon from his stand. The man was short and bald, but in Steve’s young mind, he towered over everyone in his embroidered robe. The intimidation only increased at the words he shouted and his thunderous expression.
Main title and chapter titles comes from Hozier's amazing song "Take me to Church." This is basically a fic about Steve trying to figure who he is and what he wants (thanks Uncle Iroh!). First time I've written in this fandom, so I hope I got details and characterizations right. Please enjoy!
During missions nothing changed; they still complemented each other wonderfully in the field with no unnecessary chatter (well, no more unnecessary chatter than usual from Tony). It was hard for things to be awkward when talking to an alter ego versus a person.  Steve didn’t kiss Iron Man; he kissed Tony. And Tony was commenting on Captain America’s ass not Steve’s (that’s how he tried to reason his almost constant blush away).
“I’m not having a mental breakdown,” he managed to breathe out. “I just, it’s all pointless, isn’t it?” He moved to the wall to steady himself, but ended up sinking to the floor. The ratio of laughter to tears was becoming uneven; Steve could feel the tears streaming down his face with only the occasional chuckle to lighten them. Tony was rapidly paling, and he kneeled down to be beside Steve.
“Oh, my dear boy,” the priest said, and Steve heard him exit the booth and felt his arm come around him. Steve knew this should surprise him, but he was too overcome with shame and fear. “What sin have you committed? Loving one of God’s creatures?”
Eventually, he looked up to stare at the sky and couldn’t help but wonder (not for the first time) if anyone but the Chitauri were looking back.
It just happened one day in the barracks after an especially tiring USO show in the Norwegian countryside. A shy looking cadet had approached him, talking about how much he admired him. A pretty blush was on his face as he quietly asked what Steve was doing that night.
“I’m Catholic, you know?” Steve said looking down at the ground with his hands firmly clenched in his pockets, outwardly ignoring the term of endearment while inwardly his hear celebrated. “I just, that sort of thing isn’t allowed, so I-I can’t Tony. I’m just, I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“The way you put too much peanut butter on your bagels, which by the way, peanut butter on bagels is at least in the top ten crimes against humanity right up there with slam poetry, is entirely human. Your absolute stubbornness is another one. Call me a hypocrite, Cap, but goddamn! I’ve never seen someone with hold onto something the way you do, like super magnetic, welded on, static cling!  And that constant stick up your ass!”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he finally managed to get out. “I, I don’t mean to laugh at you, but, I mean, how many times have we had this fight? This same, old, well worn fight? I mean, what’s the point in going over the same ground? It’s-it’s absolutely pointless-” he managed to finish before breaking down into laughter again.
Steve found that he couldn’t reply with his throat all choked up. Before he could say anything, Dum Dum came to get them for the raid.
“It’s not okay! I’m Captain America!” Steve screamed, turning around to look at him, tears streaming down his face. “I represent more than just myself! I can’t let myself feel this!”
“Steve,” Tony repeated for a third time. “Of course you’re human. You think someone with as many faults and problems as you isn’t human? Impossible!”
Steve looked up in shock at Bucky’s casual words. Bucky just shrugged, keeping eye contact with him.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Thank you Father,” Steve said, moving from the confessional towards the door. “I think I know what to do now.”
“You know,” Tony replied with that familiar smirk on his face, “I agree with that moving sentiment. My ass is never finer than when it’s next to yours.”
“Yes we are. Anybody who knows you doesn’t give a damn who you’re with. Hell, I’ve seen more than enough of Frenchies’ escapades. It’s okay, Stevie.”
“Steve, I’ve known you forever,” Bucky continued. “You’re my brother, and I will always love you. I know you better than anyone. You think I didn’t notice how you didn’t care for the dames? How even the longest walking sticks didn’t catch your eyes? Shit, I think I caught on before you did.”
“Tony!” Steve said with a hint of exasperation, and effectively stopping Tony’s retreat. “I thought you said you’d take our relationship in whatever capacity you’d have me, right?”
Steve turned his attention back to Tony, who, despite all his posturing, looked a little ridiculous. He was still all sweaty from being in the suit, his hair was sticking up every which way, and, for all his efforts to be intimidating, the shorter man was essentially sticking his nose in Steve’s mouth. Adding that to his now red face and seriously pissed off expression, he looked so darn darling that Steve couldn’t help but burst out laughing.
“Cap, what’s going on? ‘It’s all pointless’? What the hell does that mean? You’re not-“ Tony took a moment to put his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You’re not suicidal are you?”
“In fact, you’re probably one of the most important things in my life right now. You and the Avengers.”
Tony’s face quickly turned slightly disappointed before he seemed to rally himself. “Oh like, as a friend and teammate sort of thing, right?” Tony gave a wry smile as he suddenly and jerkily moved backwards towards the exit. “That’s cool, that’s fine, I’m just gonna go stick my head in the Tower’s reactor, so if you’ll excuse me-“
He got to the bathroom just as the shadows reached the top of the staircase, slithering along the floor, hissing softly. It took two tries to get Stark into the bathtub, but as soon as the warm water touched his skin, the slime started evaporating, the shadows with it. After a minute, the yellowish steam surrounding Stark was gone, along with any trace of the slime. Stark was himself again, sat in the water, his lower half obscured by the murky water—for which Steve was infinitely grateful. It hadn’t exactly been easy to do all that without catching a glimpse of something… private—Stark was himself again, but there were notable differences. His hair, of course, was one of them. Where it had been pitch-black, it was now a dark brown with a golden glint. His skin was different, too. Less silky smooth, more marred. His hands were scarred, small nicks and cuts and burns. He had small scars everywhere on his body, even across one of his eyebrows. It was barely visible, but it was there, where there had been nothing but skin half an hour ago.
Steve gripped his outstretched hand, barely appreciating the warmth and firmness of Stark’s hand before they crossed the threshold, the door closing behind them.
The weredog was still in his corner, still sleeping. He had been sleeping for a long time now. Was it something magical? Did he need much rest after turning into a human?
Tony knows Steve, yes. But this Steve? This Steve says things, does things, that Tony would never imagine Steve doing. Still, they’re the same, at their core. Tony’s known Steve for over a decade. The slight deviations are just a product of his subconscious. Isn’t this the
He sees the glint of the rifle just as Steve shouts and lunges for the U.S. Marshal in front of him. A blink later, the shot echoes between the buildings. Tony’s elbowing people out of the way, the undersheath sliding out of his bones, tearing his clothes as he runs to where Steve has fallen to his knees.
There’s still wine in the bottle. It’d be a waste to let the fire evaporate it. He should drink it. At least he’ll go down doing something he loves. (Loving something and being addicted to something is the same, right?)
Steve clears his throat, takes a few steps forward into Tony’s space. He’s within touching distance now, and Tony would only need an instant to sink his teeth in Steve’s neck. Their eyes are locked as Steve reveals what he’s been hiding behind his back. It’s stupidly, endearingly romantic: in his hand, there is a single rose.
It’s not supposed to happen, now that he has Extremis. He’s supposed to be even better at seeing the bigger picture, now. He’s a futurist. He thinks years, decades ahead.
Tony bent down to smell the red and yellow one and was thankfully too absorbed in the flowers to see Steve blush furiously.
Cap cleared his throat. “Then please call me Steve. And, Tony, thank you for telling me. I know you didn’t want us to know, but I’m so glad you told me. And I really think that Ant-Man and the Wasp would like to know too, and Thor as well. You can trust me, us, with this. We’ll keep your identity safe.”
Stark saw Steve immediately, and frowned briefly, something flashing behind his eyes, but it was gone the next instant, replaced by a slightly too warm smile.
“You are gifted with magic too, Mr. Rogers. You can give life to your drawings, your aspirations and beliefs can become reality. You can and will find out what the contract is about, and you will help yourself in the process. Rescue will come, but not in the form you expect. I can’t tell you more. Good luck.”
The whistle of the wind was fainter here, allowing Steve to hear something that had been lost in the wind before. It was a distant cacophony of huffing and puffing, of grinding gears and screeching metal, combined with a low whine. It couldn’t come from the town, because the wind blew from the hills to Brooklyne, and, besides, there were no factories there that made that kind of sound. Was this the sound of those gargantuan air-ships he’d heard about? Was there one of them at the bottom of the valley?
When he was done, he raised the cloth cautiously, taking care to avoid exposing too much, and made sure that there weren’t any wounds left untreated on his legs. Thankfully, there were none. He looked up again. Tony was watching him, slit-eyed, breath whistling out of him. he nodded at Steve’s asking look and turned over, revealing another cut on his upper back, which Steve cleaned and bandaged too.
The guards had been knocked over as well, and several of the ships lying in the harbour had been visibly damaged by the blast. The waves had calmed down, but there was rock on the docks that hadn’t been there before. Had it been ripped out of the harbour? How deep underwater had the blast reached?
Suddenly suspicious, he searched the castle until he found another window that didn’t just face the sky. If he looked through it, he could see a busy street, decorated with colourful banners and garlands. The automobiles moving about where imposing and shiny. The window clearly showed a city different to the port. It had to be a rich city, maybe Greenewitch or Wizardchington. Steve continued on his search for other windows, but the only places he could see were the port, the rich town, the hills, or darkness.
When he went downstairs the next morning, Jarvis was his old self again, burning happily, crunching on a piece of wood. Seeing him like this, you wouldn’t know he was a hundred times more powerful than a simple flame. Steve made coffee, put a few eggs to fry, and started cutting slices of bread and cheese for the breakfast.
The lights are off, and Tony is cocooned in a warm blanket of darkness. He could stay like this forever.
Thor is swinging his hammer left and right, but Steve is fixated on Tony, hitting him again and again and again, unrelenting.
Tony walked back towards the door, and Steve realised it was set in a simple wooden shed. There were garden supplies around it. Had this been a gardener’s shed?
They floated to the ground together, Tony with a hand securely around Steve’s waist. They walked to the place where the Witch had collapsed into herself.
It turned out that Steve would meet her the very same day. He couldn’t really say he was surprised; time was not a luxury for Stark anymore.
He knew that once his curse was lifted, he would have to go back to Brooklyne. But if Tony followed him there, it’d be amazing. He was still staring at Tony in wonderment when the latter started to speak again, eyes shuttering.
Steve steeled himself as he started recognising the streets. He was going to be there soon. He turned a corner and stopped abruptly.
Steve needed to focus. He didn’t have time to deal with the ice, he could do that later, right now he needed to—
There was an air of abandonment about the mansion. The shutters were closed, the gate locked with a rusty chain. Stark’s steps faltered ever so slightly as he walked past the property.
He’d been cursed instead of killed, just like Steve, James and Tony. And Steve had been the one to deny the cure to his curse. He stammered out a greeting, unsure of what he should say, what he should do in the presence of yet another powerful sorcerer.
“Don’t feel sorry. You had your reasons, and I’ve always respected that. Now, I even understand them. It can’t be easy, being Tony Stark and Iron Man. But I’m glad it’s you. There couldn’t have been a better man under the helmet. I’m glad to have you at my side, Shellhead.”
He had to find a way to stop the curse, he had to, he couldn’t leave Ste—he couldn’t leave his friends like that. Steve couldn’t lose him, but what was he to do? He couldn’t stand by and do nothing. He would fight the Witch, use his shield, anything.
“I pulled out a scarecrow from a bush a while ago, and this morning I opened the door and it was following the castle, trying to get in. So I grabbed a pan and hit it with it. I think we managed to lose it.”
Tony, by confessing that he hadn’t flirted seriously with Jocasta, had just fulfilled the last condition of his curse.
“Not that I don’t understand his choice—you are what could be considered handsome— but a store-owner?
He could only watch as they pursued their deadly dance in the air, one of them occasionally flying right into the other’s path, making the air vibrate with the amount of magic that was being discharged.
“We met at the Witch’s castle. He’s not a scarecrow, he’s actually another man that she cursed. I think he managed to slip away with me, but I don’t recall what happened very clearly. He says he’s been trying to enter the castle, that there is something he needs there.”
Where the suits of armour had glowed a familiar blue, their lights were now a menacing red, the same as Jocasta’s fire. She had taken control of the suits.
Tony still hasn’t decided if he should be there. He suspects that Fury is going to try something, or maybe the Winter Soldier. Tony has his own agents, of course, but he’s still new as a Director, and he can’t fully trust that they will listen to him if Fury decides to make himself known.
It was the most obvious thing in the world, Steve couldn’t live without Tony, he knew it now. He knew it in his mind, in his heart, in his very bones.
“God, you are so egotistical!” Tony shouted as he started to pace back and forth in front of Steve, who watched bewildered. “Of course, everyone else is fine loving who they love, but not you! You’re too goddamn important, right?! You can’t have it both ways, Steve. I guess if it isn’t fine in God’s eyes for you then it isn’t fine for everyone else either, right? You think you’re a disgusting sinner? That something’s wrong with them? Then that applies to me too, smartass!
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Your orders you mean?” Tony sneered back stepping closer. “Who died and made you team captain, huh? Oh, that’s right, the Greatest Generation did! Cap, I saw a detonator that only I can disable, I disable the damn thing (in record time I might add), and all you get from that is’ you didn’t follow orders, Tony,’ and ‘oh you’re such a show-off Tony.’ I’m not going to let bombs go off just to boost your damn ego! Got it, spangled?”
“Well, Father,” Steve said a little uneasily, unsure if the priest was about to ask him more details about his own service, “I’m sure the men you served with were eternally grateful for all the comfort you gave them. I don’t know if any of us ever leave the war…but I’m not really here for that…” Steve shifted uncomfortably, unsure of how to bring up what was on his mind.
Even if all the Avengers were present just lying around the living area with their own projects and work scattered about, there was an undertone of discord and a sense of tension in the air. Either Steve or Tony always ended up awkwardly excusing themselves and stumbling from the room.  The rest of the team knew something was up, but despite Thor’s oblivious joviality, Clint’s snarky comments and crude hand gestures, Bruce’s quiet but knowing looks, and Natasha’s threatening glances while Wii bowling, Steve still hadn’t had a heart to heart with Tony.
“Can’t argue with you there,” Steve replied, putting his own hand on Tony’s shoulder and letting slide down his arm to his elbow. “But you’ve never really complained before.” He could feel Tony’s muscles even with his wiry build.  He blushed slightly as he did so; he’d never touched Tony like this before, never so purposefully. Sure they’d brushed up in battles, they’d even held each other skin to skin during one memorable after-battle shower when Tony almost cracked his head open by falling asleep standing in the shower. But never like this, with affection, with caresses.
“Steve,” Tony said, this time not in exasperation or caution but with some emotion and tears forming in his eyes.
Steve never told anyone what he was feeling. Beyond the fear of legal and moral ramifications was the much greater fear of rejection and disgust.
Maybe that was why he tried so hard to get into the army, to make up for what he was. Part of the reason he volunteered for Erskine’s project was the hope that it would not only make his body stronger but his mind as well. If the serum could fix asthma, maybe it could fix his ailment as well.
“Good evening, my son,” came the reply. The voice sounded like an older man, which was reassuring to Steve. The last thing he wanted was a younger priest who might recognize him from the news or something.
“Our recent culture revolution rejects all of God’s teachings. But this recent acceptance of that which is unnatural, that which is in direct opposition of God’s design for humanity, truly reveals the sorry state we have fallen to.
It looked exactly the same as when he was a child. Apparently, the Catholic Church never changed with the times, in either policy or furnishings. It was beautiful though in an austere way. Steve could appreciate the flying buttresses and the soft light that filtered through the stained glass. But he didn’t come here for the architecture, and his nerves kept him from observing his surroundings too closely.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The romance films made him feel uncomfortable sitting that close to Tony while glamorous stars exchanged smoldering looks on the screen. Steve wondered if he ever looked at Tony like that. He tended to chatter a lot more to distract himself from his own thoughts. They talked about all kinds of things: Tony’s strained relationship with his late father, Steve’s own memories of Howard Stark, and how the two didn’t align. How the world had changed since Steve woke up from the ice, and how it would continue to change into the future. How weird it was that Thor could never figure out who was stealing his pop tarts even though Natasha was constantly eating pop tarts. (Tony always figured that even if Thor acknowledged it, he couldn’t stop Natasha from eating them). They talked about how to improve team dynamics, how to be more prepared for emergencies, and how to get the giant stick out of Fury’s ass (Tony’s words, not his). Sometimes they fell asleep talking, and Steve would wake up to the wonderful, warm feeling of Tony resting on his shoulder.
They were sitting together on the roof of Stark Tower, Tony in his black Led Zeppelin t-shirt and ripped jeans and Steve in his white tee and significantly less ripped jeans, though they were just as worn. Steve sat sketching while he listened to Tony ramble about circuitries and switches, not following a word, but loving the sound of his voice anyway. He tried not to look over at Tony too often, but he was trying to catch his profile, so it was a losing battle. He thought he was being sneaky enough with his glances, but after one too many times apparently, he looked over to find Tony looking right back at him.
He met Tony’s eyes, and couldn’t bring himself to look away. ‘I’m just looking to capture his expression,’ Steve thought to himself. ‘It’s for the sketch, not because I like to look at him.’ Steve was so focused on justifying himself that he didn’t realize Tony was leaning towards him until it was too late.
I don’t know. I’m not saying I regret going through the Project, but I’ve always thought of myself as ‘wrong’ even after the serum-and I think it’s time to change that.”
“I-,“ Steve started but he couldn’t seem to help himself from blushing. “Of course I do. Who could resist you? You’re, well, you’re Tony.”
Steve began to make the sign of the cross as he recited, “In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.”
“I still believe in God,” Steve said, seemingly shocking Tony out of his kissed-induced stupor, “and I still consider myself to be Catholic. But still, I know that I love you and I want to be with you. I think if God does exist, than there isn’t any planet he’s created where I’m not a better man when I’m with you.”
“No!” Steve shouted in horror. “Tony, you’re not disgusting or wrong! You, you’re amazing and smart and beau-” Steve stopped and cleared his throat. It’s just, you’re not Catholic.”
“And the way you smile,” Tony continued, “its just…I-I can’t think of anyone more human than you.” Tony finished and looked down at where Steve’s hand laid on his elbow then back up to meet Steve’s eyes.
How could he explain to Tony that part of the reason he was so frustrated and angry with him was that Tony brought his repressed feelings and sinful desires to the surface?
And as he lay in Tony’s arms with the sky growing dark around them, he finally felt the peace and contentment that he had searched his whole life to find.
All of them were so eager to do…things with girls. Things that made Steve have to leave the room. The other boys, especially Bucky, teased him for his pure and innocent heart, taking his hurried exit for bashfulness. Steve didn’t have the heart to tell them that it made him uncomfortable because he didn’t understand. Why would they want to treat any girl, especially the girls they fancied, like that? Why would they want to do those things with them? It all seemed so…strange and unappealing, at least to Steve. He seemed to be the only one that felt this way though, so he just swiftly made his exit whenever the topic turned to girlfriends.
“Tony, I don’t think you’re going to hell. I-I don’t know how to explain, but it’s not okay for me. Other people can find ways to work it out, but I haven’t.”
“I love you too, Steve,” Tony whispered softly right next to his ear. Steve shivered at the contact and, though he wouldn’t admit it even to himself, at the tenderness in Tony’s voice.
There was a pause after Steve stopped talking, which was incredible in and of itself. Steve talked so much that it made even Tony Stark be quiet. ‘Will wonders never cease?’
Around nine or ten, the other boys started to single out the girls at school. Each boy had a favorite gal based on her hair, or smile, or jokes. Even Bucky shared with him one afternoon out by the oak tree in the schoolyard that he found the girl with long braided hair sitting in the front corner of their class very “cute.”
Anytime Steve walked in on Tony or vice-versa, there was a great deal of mumbling, aborted movements, and clearing of throats.
“Hmmm…” Bucky hummed while contemplating his face. Unable to take Bucky’s scrutiny, Steve climbed out of the truck and started to walk away.
“I-I’m sorry,” Tony stuttered out. “I just, I guess I thought…of course I was reading that wrong, you’re you, and obviously you don’t feel that way about anyone, least of all me. I’ll just go. Over there. Far away, to bury my head in the sand.” Crouching with his hands on his knees, Tony put his head in between his legs to take a deep breathe before swinging upright to look at Steve. “Whew, forget that ever happened alright?” Tony finished with a blush high on his cheeks as he started to walk with awkward limbs toward the roof door, still wiping his sweaty hands on his jeans.
“Hello, Tony,” Steve replied with what he hoped was a reassuring smile. He thought Tony was so brave to come when he had no idea what Steve would say. But one way or another, things couldn’t go on like this.
On nights when it was just the two of them, things were more personal. Sometimes they would talk about nothing and just sit in companionable silence. This usually happened when the Marx Brothers films were on; you couldn’t look away for a second or you’d miss half the dialogue! The noir films were the funniest. Tony would take a ridiculous line and use it during sparring or missions just to get a laugh out of him. Steve will never forget the time during a post-battle report at SHIELD that Tony said, right to Fury’s face, that the offender had probably “thrown himself against a hard world until it sharpened him into a granite stiletto.” It didn’t even make any sense in the context, and it wasn’t even that funny. But Steve couldn’t help the loud laugh that burst forth from him.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Well, I guess I know where I stand now,” Tony said, sounding bewildered. “Actually, I have no idea. Are you having a freak out? God, did I cause Captain America to have a mental breakdown?! Fury’s gonna kill me! I am a dead man slash iron suit walking.”
“I cannot tell you what you wish to know.” Steve felt his hope fall and almost began to cry when the priest spoke again. “I cannot tell you what you wish to know,” he repeated, “because only you have the answer. I am only a man, but I think that God would not want you to lie about who you are. I cannot tell you what God’s will is for you, that is something we all must discover for ourselves. But, if it will ease your mind, I will tell you that you have already done your penance. God the Father of mercies…I absolve you from your sins. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”
“Sure thing, Steve,” Tony said easily, moving to sit with Steve on the ground near the edge of the roof. The New York skyline looked amazing from up here, and just as Steve predicted, the waning light covered them in warm tones of pink and orange. It covered Tony’s hair in highlights of gold, and Steve found himself gazing at him rather than the sunset. Eventually, Tony turned to meet his gaze, and they held it for a moment until Steve finally found the courage to break it.
He took deep breaths to try to relax his tense body, but he tightened right back up when he heard the roof door open. He stood and heard Tony’s light footfalls step towards him.
The hope in Tony’s eyes seemed to explode before something tamped it down again. “Then why did you pull away?”
Loki’s scepter didn’t help, but, gosh, did Tony remind him of all those rich and powerful bullies he took on everyday during the war. Men who thought the law didn’t apply to them, that they could do whatever they wanted no matter who they crushed along the way. Didn’t help that Tony looked like Howard; Steve liked Howard, but he always felt like the man was watching him, dissecting him. It felt like he was trying to see how much Steve could be worth to him. It made him feel like a bug on display.
Steve didn’t know if this new world was better than being stuck in the ice in an eternal slumber. The whole thing felt like a dream anyway. He awoke to a false reality, almost parallel to his own with a similar setting, familiar radio programs. But it didn’t take him long to figure out that it was all fake. Immediately after, he was thrown all too quickly into a futuristic world like something out of a movie but not nearly as fun. No flying zeppelins that were sleek and smooth, flying all over the sky. No metal people or automatons to do your work for you.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said with a weak smile and a hint of swagger as he pocketed his hands into torn jeans.
Bucky’s voice stopped him. How could he know? Sure he liked Peg; she was smart, clever, funny, and beautiful. And, most importantly, even after he gained his good looks and muscles, she didn’t treat him any differently than she had before. She was a safe bet. They hadn’t even kissed yet, let alone had a dance. He couldn’t help but turn to look at Bucky’s smirk.
I don't know why it took me so long to post this chapter. Probably because I kept thinking that it's a short chapter so it shouldn't take that long to write. I put it off, but here it is! Also, totally but a "She Loves Me" quote in here. Thank you so much for reading!
“It’s like how it was before the serum. I always thought something was wrong with me that I had to be fixed. I was too skinny, too weak, too defective. But maybe if I’d just learned to accept that that was who I am, if I’d learned to be happy as myself, I would’ve been happy. I always thought of myself as broken, as incomplete.  But maybe I just am who I am. And who that is isn’t wrong or broken.
Steve also didn’t mind when he walked in to find just Tony watching movies on the television. He didn’t know if Tony did it on purpose, but every time he joined Tony on the couch he was watching black and white films. Maybe that was all that played at night or something (Steve still didn’t understand cable), but it was comforting to see something familiar after waking up from nightmares to find himself again in a frightening new reality. Tony’s presence assured him that he hadn’t somehow slept another seventy years, but the films reminded him that his past also existed, simultaneously, in his memory.
No, instead the future he gets sent to is one where the world is still in danger from the same monsters he fought over 70 years ago, eccentric gods, green giants (not the one that introduced vegetables), secret agents sneaking around corners like bad Dick Tracy impersonators, and hostile aliens hell bent on invading earth. It seemed more a fevered dream than reality. Half the time he suspected he was still frozen in the ice.
Steve felt his mouth go dry, and he looked down from Bucky’s steadfast gaze, unable to accept or confirm the words he spoke.
If he’d wanted to sort out a private meeting back in what Clint lovingly referred to the “oldie-fogies’” days, he would have left a note with the time and place next to the bookmark in whatever book rested on their bedside table. He couldn’t keep track of the times he’d left a note for Bucky in whatever penny dreadful, gumshoe mag he had lying around. But Tony was all future and paperless; Steve didn’t think he even owned a book!
Which wasn’t an option. Not possible. Not that Steve could stop himself from thinking about it. It was just easier to scream.
Steve looked at the priest in surprise. “It goes against everything I’ve ever been taught, everything I’ve ever known! How can I accept this part of myself without tearing my soul apart in confusion and conflict?” Steve couldn’t help his voice raising as he questioned the priest. “How can I live with myself if I don’t know who I am?” he pleaded more quietly, almost desperately.
At this, he turned and walked back into his tower, leaving Steve outside with only the wind and the sky for company. Steve stood frozen looking at the door long after Tony left.
“Sorry, Steve, but you should know what you’re getting into.” At this, Tony leaned in closer to give him a hug. Tony was smaller than him, but Steve couldn’t help how his body relaxed and leaned into his strong frame.
He doubled over in shoulder-shaking laughs, and when he finally sat up to look at Tony, his shocked expression started Steve off again. Tears started to come to his eyes as he tried to recover himself.
“Amen,” Steve replied as the Father finished making the sign of the cross above him. He met the Father’s eyes and saw that they were kindly looking at him. He was correct; the priest was an older man, and he helped him to stand as Steve prepared to leave.
“I think that priest was right,” he continued. “I think God would want me to be honest about who I am. And I think I finally understand who I am.”
And then, as soon as he turned to look at Tony, his body was instantly at ease. Tony did that to him. If Tony was here, everything was going to be all right.
He was sick six days out of the week, small, pale, and weak, since the day he was born. Other boys wrestled and played baseball in the rain, but he could only watch from the window.  It didn’t stop him from getting into a fair measure of scrapes with his best friend Bucky there to back him up. His mother often despaired seeing his bruises and scrapes when he showed up to supper, but she always patched him up with a kind smile. The kindest smile. Despite his trouble breathing, he still managed to get into scraps with the Brooklyn bullies who didn’t take kindly to anyone weaker than them. True, that included him, but he didn’t care.
“Stevie,” Bucky said in a slightly broken tone as he put his arm on Steve’s shoulder and pulled him into a hug. “You are so much more than Captain America. You have to know that…right?”
His pals asked him so often who he had an eye on that he finally just picked a girl. She was nice, liked to joke around, and had a warm smile. She was a safe choice; he was too skinny, pale, and unattractive for any girl to look at him twice anyway.  After he chose her, the ribbing continued, but at least he could participate in the locker room discussions.
“Steve,” Tony said again pleadingly. He heard Tony move closer to him and felt a warm hand on his shoulder. After a moment, Tony’s hand came to his chin and lifted his head until his watering blue eyes met brown. The fond look in Tony’s eyes made him stop laughing though he occasionally hiccupped.
Steve was perfectly fine with denial. Heck, he spent most of his days pretending that he wasn’t in the future. Before Tony, Steve could conceal every part of his personality that didn’t conform to the Captain America ideal. It wasn’t always easy, but his slip-ups were far and in between. After Tony, he was lucky if he could pull himself together for a press conference. Captain America, the paragon of American virtue, a symbol of hope and freedom, could barely make it through breakfast without having a shouting match with Tony over the toaster! He felt equal parts of frustration and attraction anytime he was around the other man, and often he had no other outlet than harsh criticism and shouting. His only other option was to fiercely kiss the man until they both couldn’t breath enough to shout.
“Yon gonna see Peg soon?” Bucky asked casually as he leaned on the side of the truck examining his gun disinterestedly.
Thanks again for reading. This was a healing process for me, and I hope that if this story is relatable for you in your life that you find some comfort. I hope you enjoyed it!
“Friend, that’s more words than you’ve spoke in the past two weeks,” Tony said with a smirk and a slightly country twang to his voice.
In the end, Steve ended up asking Mr. JARVIS to create a digital note? A computer message? He still didn’t get it, but Mr. JARVIS assured him that when Tony opened his projection screen (?), he would get the message to meet Steve on the roof at 6:00 p.m. Call Steve a sap, but he wanted to have this conversation in the same place as their first kiss with the sun setting around them.
Now Steve really couldn’t look at him. There was humor and warmth in Buck’s last remark, but that didn’t change how Steve felt. This was worse than he ever imagined. Not only did Bucky know about his defect, but he also knew about his perverted desires. He couldn’t even protect his best friend from his corruption. He was breathing so hard it felt like his asthma had come back, and he almost didn’t hear what Bucky said next.
Oh, they still fought, and, occasionally, Steve had to restrain himself from killing Tony. But along with this came teasing, a causal kind, that could only exist between friends. ‘Shellhead’ became Steve’s well-known moniker for Iron Man while Tony favored ‘Winghead’ for Captain America. Their fights became less explosive and more cathartic. This easy camaraderie slowly spread to the rest of the team; not only did their battle strategies improve, but their personal interactions were now far less tense.
He shot Steve with a smoldering look that stopped Steve’s heart and stole his breath. “Well, maybe you’re not wrong to want more,” he replied, trying to shoot an equally paralyzing look, but thought he might have failed based on the amused look Tony now had directed at him.
But in the midst of all this confusion, there was one thing those egghead science fiction theorists had gotten correct. There were metal people and automatons, well, one metal person: Iron Man.
The priest’s voice had quieted down by this point, so Steve returned to picking at his nails. The words meant little to him at the time beyond surprise at the vehemence in the usually pleasant priest. Now they haunted him daily.
Of course, Bucky chose to talk to him right before a mission. They were preparing to capture Zola’s train when Bucky found him checking the team’s ammo supply in the back of a half-truck.
“Oh yes,” the priest replied with what sounded like a smile in his voice. “I am well acquainted with the ways of war. And what happens to those thrown into it.”
“Tony,” Steve called out, unable to let him go like that. Then Tony looked at him, and Steve could see the tiny bit of hope in his eyes. No doubt it was reflected in his own. It was time to tell the truth.
But to Steve it was. He still believed in God, and he wanted to honor what his mother had taught him. It was a foundation of who he was; he couldn’t give that up for a meaningless roll in the hay. He knew his mother would always love him no matter what, but he wasn’t sure he could love himself.
“I want to be with you, Tony. If that’s what you want,” Steve finished in slight apprehension. He thought he knew where they stood, but with Tony, nothing was ever sure.
“I just-“ Steve began, looking at his hands instead of Tony’s concerned face. “I feel like I’m in this endless cycle of failure. We get a mission; I make a call on that mission. It’s the wrong call, and somebody gets hurt. I go to SHIELD and explain what happened and why I made such bad decisions. I come back to the tower and we fight about how I’m a bad leader. Rinse and repeat. Over and over again, and nothing seems to change no matter what I do. I don’t know how to make it stop. I-I don’t know how to be better at this.
He got that same examining feeling from Tony, but it was compounded by his hopeless attraction to the man. The electricity that went between them when they first met on the helipad only strengthened Steve’s desire to lash out at him.
“It’s from-you know what never mind,” Tony replied with a slight blush for some reason. “Look, I have no idea what you’re going through. None. And I can see how this seems like an impossible task. But why don’t you just talk to the team? We are a team, right? When one of us hurts, we all hurt. Talk to the others and we’ll work out a plan. Make us do drills, sleepovers, truth-or-dare, or whatever, but I’m sure the team will be up for it. And I-I need to trust you too. I’ll try to be less of an ass when I deviate from script, all right? You don’t have to do this alone. Hell, you absolutely shouldn’t do this alone, that way lays madness my friend.”
“It’s kind of ridiculous anyway. I’m worrying about liking men when I may not even be human anymore. I might be damned already!” He didn’t think it was all that funny, but his own despair bubbled out of him as hysterical laughing that he couldn’t seem to stop.
“Um, yes I can. Genius, billionaire, philanthropist, playboy here, remember? If I want to put a sparkly, star-spangled thong on my suit when I fly it out to battle then I damn well will, and I’d like to see you stop me! Unless, you want to wear them yourself because I’m not saying no to that.”
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
He got along with the girls just fine. He liked them just fine. He just didn’t understand everyone else’s obsession.
“It only increased when I was in the army as I’m sure you can understand. I never acted on my feelings because it was against what I’d been taught all my life. I’m not perfect, never will be,” Steve said, straightening his back, “but I’ve always tried to do what’s right. Now, I’ve met someone, and Father-“ he broke off as tears started to fall from his eyes and his shoulders hunched over, no longer straight. “I love him,” he managed to choke out. “I love him, and I don’t know what to do. What is right, Father,” he appealed, raising his head towards the partition. “What should I do? I’m so lost in more ways than one, and I could use some guidance. Please, Father. I’m so lost.”
“I went to see a priest. And I’m not sure how to explain how all my feelings are tied to one another, but I’ve got to try.”
Steve purposefully wore a sweatshirt with a hood to hopefully attract less attention and sat quietly in one of the front benches until it was his turn at the confessional.
I'm not Catholic, but I hope the confessional scene worked out okay. The movie references are "Brokeback Mountain" and a movie I saw on late night T.V. channel during the noir hour, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it was. I'm probably misquoting it anyway.
“Oh I see,” Tony continued with his arms crossed and a skeptical look in his eyes. “So, you don’t hate gay people, but you think they’re all going to hell because of who they love? That better? You think I’m going to hell? That’s probably, scratch that, definitely true, but not because of who I date. Mostly. Well, that won’t be the majority of it anyway.”
When he was finally able to speak, he said “It might be okay for some people, but it’ll never be okay for me.”
Steve spent time with the team outside of these late night meet-ups, but he really loved going down to Tony’s workshop to sketch and think and nap while Tony worked. He loved being in there so much, he even brought earplugs to wear when Tony blasted his (what apparently passed for) music. It was rare to have those peaceful afternoons. When they did, Steve wouldn’t want to spend it with anyone else but Tony. After so many years being sick, then at war, then alone in the ice, Steve didn’t want to spend anymore time alone than he had to.
“I think it’s an excellent idea. Here, let me make this official. We, King Rhodes, hereby declare Wizard Anthony Stark to be the new court sorcerer, effective immediately.”
It was Tony! He’d transformed himself into a raven and was now matching the Witch blow to blow. Steve watched with trepidation as the turquoise flares outnumbered the green ones. A particularly big one ended with a howl of rage, and Tony flew away as the Witch grew to her original size again, clutching her arm. Steve wasn’t sure, but he thought he saw blood. The Witch didn’t stop at her own size, however, having seemingly decided that if shrinking wasn’t working, she’d grow tall instead. She grew and grew and grew until she towered tall as a tree, her hands sharpening and straightening into pointed blades, her dress rippling in yellow and black around her. She had wings, Steve saw, insect wings that kept her flying. All in all, she reminded Steve of a giant, deadly wasp.
As it turned out, it wasn’t. Jarvis had multiple examples of people Stark had taken in until they could continue on with their life. He’d found a teenager on his porch, once, and instead of sending him away, had fed him and housed him until the young man had admitted to being an orphan. The young man had sat on Stark’s porch because he knew no one would dare make him move from such a powerful man’s doorstep. Stark had helped him get an education and now he lived in Queen’s city, specialising in glue-like fluids and arachnids. There was another teenager he had helped, some years after that, a brilliant girl that had lost her father in a street fight. She’d been passionate about automatons, and he had helped her develop her skills in magic and machines. She was living with her mother, now, setting up her own shop, which she’d named Ironheart.
He didn’t know what would be worse, to have Tony gone, or to have a version of him that he could never hope to love?
It would scar if Tony didn’t have a spell to make it heal faster. Just another scar to go with the ones he already had. Steve traced one of them with his fingers, wondering where it came from. He jerked back when Tony shivered under him.
But he never touched the wall. He was in Tony’s arms instead, Tony who was a mass of feathers, but still had the same eyes, and told him in a rough but so, so soft voice:
There was something going on with Stark, something that Stark was trying to hide, and which was most likely dangerous.
Why would Tony be looking for someone as useless as Steve, besides? He wasn’t interesting, was good for nothing apart painting things that moved, and scaring away inanimate objects.
Loud bangs were coming from the harbour, lights flashing in the sky. Steve ran as fast as he could, pushed his legs until they were aching with every step, and kept running. He was the only one running to the fight and not from it.
Steve stood up, intending to walk towards Jarvis, when a low groan caught his attention. James was grimacing, his eyes squeezed shut, his left hand flexing. He tried to stand up with an aborted cry, but his body didn’t seem to be cooperating: with a jerk, he slammed down on his bench again, chest heaving. He gritted his teeth and growled, eyes flashing desperately, but the next moment, his posture was ramrod straight, and Steve knew he wasn’t himself anymore.
What were those scars? They looked nefarious, almost poisonous. And Stark hadn’t had those when he’d stormed out of the bathroom earlier. Which meant that this was most likely the reason that Stark had cast this spell on himself. Not to hide his hair colour, or his small scars, but to hide the serious scarring on his chest.
He had to ask Jarvis about it when he woke up again. Speaking of, he should go to bed too. Tony was already stumbling up the stairs, muttering a good night.
Tony staggers back against the wall, lets himself slide down. Whatever he does, whatever he says, it’ll end everything they ever were. Steve has given him no choice. He wants to scream, take the suit and fly far, far away, until there’s nothing but Tony and his thoughts and his feelings that won’t stay down, that come up in his throat and threaten to choke him. He wants to fly into the sun, until he’s nothing but dust. But there’s nowhere he can go, because he’s stuck in the loop, and it’s fitting, in a way, that he’s been running after the future all his life, that it’s been sliding between his fingers during these last months, but that he has an infinite amount of time, right here, with Steve. Time has been running out for months, but now it’s still, and he’s going to destroy everything anyway.
“It’s a pleasure meeting you, Steve Rogers. I apologize for not letting you see your sister, but she is in training and shouldn’t be disturbed. I don’t doubt you would have liked to meet me in better circumstances, but you will get the help you’re looking for. It is a heavy curse you’re under, but you have the tools at your disposal to lift it.”
There was nothing left, nothing but a single wasp. It buzzed slightly, flying towards the nearest window.
They wouldn’t have been in such a hurry if Tony hadn’t made a stupid mistake in converting from the old Swedish time-measuring system to the one currently in use. Thankfully, Pepper had spotted the error just in time for them to go into a mad dash into the cave, Tony dropping everything but the parchment and a torch.
, power of a super-soldier until he’s straddling you, pinning you to the ground, doing his best to rip you in half.
On their seventh fight as Avengers, Steve gets injured. He brawls with a saber-toothed tiger (this fight is against a magician who’s put life into old fossils) and the tiger rips his sleeve off, tearing open Steve’s shoulder. The wound isn’t very deep, and Steve carries on with the fight until he subdues the tiger. Tony’s busy with three mammoths, so he doesn’t see Steve (only hears his quiet gasp of pain on the comms) until they’re done with the fight. Tony touches down, at a safe distance from the animals and the wounded, and flips his faceplate up before turning around and coming face to face to Steve, blood still oozing from his wound. Tony freezes as the sight and smell overwhelm him. It’s so close, and there, and available. Tony could take three steps, kneel down, and lick at the wound. It’s already open and pulsing for him.
What if it was the Witch? What if it was someone else? But who else? Two of the four places the door led to weren’t inhabited. It wouldn’t hurt to check, though. Steve had been surprised by the scarecrow and the weredog, what if this was yet another being he had met before? What if it was Lord Fury, or even Natasha? Or Tony who couldn’t enter the castle for some reason?
In the middle of the kitchen lay Tony, immobile, the marks still very much there. He was still breathing, but each exhale was a rattling whisper.
You can’t fight your way out of everything, Tony wanted to scream back at Steve. How can you think that being dead and free is better than being alive? Does the phrase
Tony was pacing, raking one hand through his hair, tapping a staccato beat on his chest with the other, talking a mile an hour, trying to figure out what to do.
Did humans have feelings, or emotions, that fire demons couldn’t have? Was it something physical, or metaphysical? Was it something tangible? Was it an idea? Was it a promise? Was it riches, a physical body, hands? But when and why would Jarvis have any use of hands or a human body? In addition, miss Potts had said that Stark did give Jarvis something of his. But where did Jarvis keep it? Or was the castle some kind of manifestation of what Stark had given Jarvis?
Tony isn’t dead. He’s slumped against a street light, watching the hotel go up in flames. No one died, the police are saying. A miracle, Christmas come early.
Steve didn’t want to wait for him, who knew when he would be back? He was surely still talking with Natasha. No, Steve wanted to do something, and if he couldn’t find the contract, at least he could help Stark with the spells. And what if this spell was a little trickier than the others? Steve could handle himself; he didn’t need to wait for anyone.
Inside, the castle was slowly crumbling, the paint on the walls peeling off, the bricks turning to dust, the walls caving in. Tony was still dying. What was he supposed to do?
“You’re not answering my question. Why do you always do stuff behind my back and pretend it doesn’t kill you to do it? Even if you don’t remember, you must have a suspicion as to why you acted like that during the war! “
Steve felt heat rising up his throat and cheeks and cursed his inability to lie convincingly. Thankfully, Stark didn’t know his tells, and dipped his head in a nod, as if it all made sense. It was so strange, seeing Stark like this, so tall and strong and handsome and—
Tony would be near the sea. Where mermaids lived. Of course, Steve didn’t know if there were mermaids in the harbour, but honestly, he wasn’t going to take the chance. He had to warn Tony somehow, make him lure the Witch away from the water.
But Tony was gone. Could Steve do anything? Miss Potts had said that he had some magic abilities. Well, his spells might not be very powerful, but something was better than nothing at all.
“I’m sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America. Pleased to meet you.”
dead. Did he mean that he would literally die, or would he change as the Witch of the Waste had changed? Would he turn into an evil man? Would he be unrecognisable to those who had known him beforehand?
Steve wondered why Stark hadn’t used that ability before, when Steve was breaking his back cleaning everything up.
The scarecrow bowed slightly. It didn’t look that threatening, now that it wasn’t trying to force its—his?—way through the castle’s door. Steve decided that he would let the scarecrow in. If he was telling the truth, he could help him, and if not, if push came to shove, he could always use his trusted shield again. It had proven a reliable weapon.
He agreed, and Stark smiled that beautiful smile again. Steve had to be careful, or he would grant Stark everything just to see that smile.
Which meant that Steve would need to run down to the fight. And avoid himself from getting killed by a stray spell. While he was weak and short-breathed. With only a shield as protection.
This was what Jarvis really looked like, in all his glory. A blazing fire, bright as a star, illuminating the whole kitchen with millions of colourful lights. It was breath-taking.
But then he saw that wherever there was slime on the ground, shadows pooled around it. They seemed to come from the slime, rising up from the floor and growing taller, crawling up the walls, reaching for Steve’s feet. He almost tripped when one brushed his ankle and tried to curl around it. They were morphing into menacing forms with sharp claws and pointy teeth, whispering unintelligible words. They gave away the same aura as the black door, and Steve knew he couldn’t let them touch him.
“He wants you to understand that he is utterly inadequate for the position. He has given me several arguments; Stark is infamous for his hedonism; he is self-centred. I live with him, and more often than not, he interrupts me when we talk, he doesn’t let me finish speaking, he has even left in the middle of conversations before. You could argue that he only thinks about himself, that he doesn’t care about other people, but, well, I’m the living example of the contrary, he’s really considerate, did you know that he helps people in need?”
Oh. Tony knew the dog wasn’t really a dog, and that it was the Witch that had cursed him. Which almost certainly meant that the man wasn’t working for her, or at least not willingly. Steve wished he could talk to Natasha and ask her about him. She had to know exactly who he was, especially since she was literally training to hone her intelligence skills. She would have the answers, Steve knew.
Iron Man locked eyes with Tony, who took a step back at the sheer desperation in the man’s eyes. This went beyond Iron Man not believing that Tony was who he was. This was personal for Iron Man.
Who would find him? A nameless agent? Hill herself? Or maybe Carol, if there’s Avengers business. He wonders if they would cry. He doesn’t think so. They have better, more important things to do. Tony doesn’t deserve more than a moment of silent contemplation.They’d look at the broken parts of his body and understand that it was just a matter of time.
Maybe she was jealous. Because she and Tony had broken up. She’d talked about concurrence, when she’d cursed Steve. Maybe that was it. Did she curse everyone Tony slept with?
It made sense, didn’t it? Hadn’t Steve thought about it himself, that everything he touched turned out to be trouble? It had been true with the scarecrow, and it was true with the dog. What did it want? How had it even found its way in? It had come from the hills, Steve saw.
Jarvis was looking even worse than when Steve had left him. He was just glowing faintly, his core exposed by the lack of flames. He pulsed gently, the soothing pulse of the blue glow enough to make Steve want to sleep again. He was
His excuse to leave was as obvious to Steve as it was to Jarvis, but Tony didn’t seem to care that he was transparent in his need to leave. For what it was worth, he looked really unwell.
And he had the nerve to pretend that he didn’t know what Steve was alluding to? Well, Steve could be very explicit if he had to, and he wanted to, wanted to rub it in Stark’s face.
Tony’s yanked out of his thoughts when Steve bumps against him, jarring his arm badly. He’s stuck, he realises, stuck in the outer limit of the space pocket.
They loved each other, yet they regretted the contract. Miss Potts had told Steve that a fire demon could corrupt their human’s heart, and that it had happened to the Witch of the Waste. Was this what Jarvis and Tony were afraid of?
Tony still wasn’t looking at Steve, who was busy trying to understand the implications of what James had just told them.
He put it down next to the door and decided to rest a little bit near the fire. Jarvis was content that Steve had fended off the scarecrow and crackled peacefully. Steve dozed a little, waking up when he heard noise from the weredog’s side. He was awake, shifting restlessly, whining a little. He growled loudly, stood up, faced Steve, and shuddered twice before twisting.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh at that. Encouraged, Tony continued, “Don’t even get me started on your stupid muscles. Who needs all those muscles, huh? How are there even shirts that fit you?! I can’t really complain, but seriously, talk about bulk!”
Steve just couldn’t stop laughing. Tears started to come into his eyes, hand covering them as his shoulders continued to shake.
Well, Steve didn’t know about it. If he hadn’t been actively suppressing that part of himself, maybe he would have picked up on it sooner. For better or worse, he only realized what was happening after someone propositioned him.
“They deserve our pity and our assistance but not our acceptance. They must be institutionalized and repaired. Never forget what the Lord has declared in Leviticus chapter 20 verse thirteen: ‘You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.’ Do not forget Sodom and Gomorrah. We must reject those who reject the word of God as diseased and defiled.”
He only needs to be patient. If he’s lucky, Steve’ll get injured a few times more between now and the end.
He shot up from the couch, rage burning through his veins, and started throwing everything he could find at the walls. He should burn this whole place down, he should alert the authorities, he should warn the King, he should, he should—
“I don’t control my subconscious. I don’t control what you do, Steve. I can’t…I can’t order you to hug me.”
Steve figured it couldn’t hurt to tell him, since nothing bad had happened. Besides, he had the feeling that Stark wouldn’t let it go, if his intense gaze was anything to go by.
Tony can’t help himself, he runs to Steve, needs to touch him, make sure he isn’t dead, feel his warmth, feel his heart. He collides with Steve, hands roaming over his chest and face, and they’re so close together they could kiss—
Had he really done that? He’d planned on putting them close together, but that would be too telling. He was already being embarrassingly obvious with his subconscious desires, no need to thrust them into Tony’s face.
Something acrid wells up in his throat. This is his new normal, now. Wait for Steve to kill him. Again, and again, and again.
Steve told him he’d found it on the pile of spells, which seemed to surprise Stark even further. How had the spell found itself there? And more importantly, was it even a spell?
From where he's crouching on the ground, he can see the polished boots of cannon-fodder encircling him.
That’s five more time loops than Tony remembers. Less than he feared, but his gut still clenches at the thought that Steve killed him
Which was still a step further than Tony had come. He unbuttoned his shirt and showed the mangled mess of his chest. He opened the plate, baring his heart to Stark, and Cap, who’d decided to blithely ignore their privacy. They both paled, Cap choking out:
Stark, still not looking at him, dismissed the thanks with a quick wave: “Don’t mention it, I need you to look sharp to make a good impression on Pepper.”
They made small talk as they ate, talking about the shop, the ideas Tony had for his suits, and what Steve wanted to paint. Steve wasn’t entirely forthcoming when he said he wanted to paint landscapes and domestic scenes. Sure, those were fine subjects, but he wanted to paint Tony most of all. He’d painted Jarvis already, and even the castle, but never Tony. It was too personal, somehow. Made his feelings for Tony more real. But he couldn’t really tell Tony about that.
Tony can’t breathe, and that’s why he unconsciously calls his armour, because another thirty seconds of this and he’ll be dead, because Steve is so focused on his anger that he doesn’t realise he’s crushing Tony, cutting off his air, pushing on his ribs and using his whole body to pin Tony against the wall. The armour surrounds him, and he pushes Steve off him, because he can’t think when Steve’s so close to him, but he uses too much force, and Steve falls hard against the worktable and lays still on the floor.
Why was Stark so adamantly against confronting her? He wasn’t helpless against her, not if the King thought he had a chance to battle against her and win. Why would the King ask for him, otherwise? Was Stark such a coward, that he didn’t even want to try?
There was a lot to think about, Steve knew. Miss Potts had given him clues as well as confused him even more. She knew more about Jarvis and Tony than Steve did, that was sure. She’d said something puzzling; that Steve had magic within him. Was that even possible, a first-born gifted with magic? It felt too good to be true: Steve had never had any luck in life, but now Potts said that he would find a way to break his curse.
He was only light, a bright beam aimed at the Witch, who was too close to dodge it. It hit her head on. She managed to deflect a part of it, but Steve jumped in and used the shield to reflect it back to her.
Steve felt his heart surge with hope. He looked down, right into Tony’s unwavering blue stare. Steve held his breath. Was he—had he done everything right? Was Tony alright?
Tony Stark.” He wouldn’t let Iron Man sway Cap, dammit. Besides, why was Iron Man so adamant about him not being Tony Stark? The teleportation hadn’t changed his appearance, had it?
He took two more eggs and three more slices, deciding that he should give them to Jarvis as a treat. A flame licked around the pan, and Steve saw it as the tongue it was when it curled around a slice and dragged it into the open maw of the demon. The flames were perfect, and after a few minutes, the eggs and bacon were ready. Steve lifted the pan up, put it next to the fire, and opened a few cupboards until he found cutlery and a plate that weren’t dirty. He sat down at the table, carefully pushing some of the papers away, and turned sharply when he heard the door unlock.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think. I’m just so confused about the money. How does he live in such luxury with that little amount of income? Is he from a wealthy or noble family?”
They needed to go back to the castle, find a way to end the curses, maybe they could ask miss Potts now that there wasn’t the looming threat of the Witch anymore. But how were they going to home? Steve couldn’t carry Tony, and Tony could barely stand, and…
Lord Fury smirked slightly but acquiesced. He gave Steve a sky-blue cloth to put the armour pieces in—it had to be infused with some kind of magic to make the armour easier to carry, Steve mused—and they were walking back towards the entrance when something ran into Steve from behind, scattering the pieces of armour everywhere and knocking Steve to the ground. The thing had managed to tangle itself into the cloth, snarling and twisting in a fruitless effort to be free. Sir Coulson came running soon after, apologising profusely for losing the dog. He extricated the dog from the cloth, hoisting it up into his arms, and Steve gasped in surprise as he saw it. It was the same dog he’d freed from under the bush all those weeks ago! What was it doing in the Shield guild, of all places?
Pepper Potts was every inch the woman Steve had imagined. Pale skin, freckles peppering her face and throat, flamboyant hair put up in a severe hair bun. She was wearing a pristine white dress, the sheer pooling gracefully around her as she sat. She was holding a cup of steaming liquid, the vapor coming from it tinged slightly red. She had sharp blue eyes that latched onto Steve’s as soon as they made eye contact.
There was also the matter of the detail about the contract between a fire demon and a human: the human had to give the fire demon something. But what? What didn’t a fire demon have, that would be tempting enough to willingly bind themselves to a human, with all the loss of freedom it entailed?
Steve whirled around to gape at Tony. Had he heard that right? Tony resolutely stared at the ground, missing the way James turned towards him.
Steve wasn’t in any state to try to run and hide, because he was now completely bathed in the blue glow. Anyone would have seen him. Besides, he couldn’t run even if he wanted to. With this body, he would more likely fall and break a bone than escape successfully. If only he wasn’t this weak—wait. That might work in his favour, just this time. With him looking like this, Stark wouldn’t be interested in courting him. After all, he was known to pursue beautiful young adults only, not sickly or ugly runts like himself. Steve was almost certain that he was in no danger of getting his heart eaten, which was good enough for him to start shouting at the castle.
A whimpering moan escapes Tony’s lips. He’s beyond speaking. There’s a tear track down one of Steve’s cheeks. He’s blinking sluggishly up at Tony, and Tony forgets what he wanted to say. Forgets everything but the colour of ice, of death-kissed lips, of eyes so clear you can see the shifts of the light on them.
They helped each other to the entrance of the castle, sitting in the sand until the familiar whine of the suit reached them. Tony let it embrace him, and as soon as he was surrounded by it, he stood straighter. Steve suspected the suit was the only thing holding him standing.
Tony grabbed two wooden chairs that had been hidden in the shadow. He sat down one of them and waited for Steve to join him.
He hates you and will never forgive you for what you did, a slithery voice murmurs in the back of his head.
Then the moment passes, and he remembers he’s a pathetic waste of a man, that he’s not worth saving. He had it all, and he threw it down the drain all the same, and he knows Steve is only there to make sure that he doesn’t do something dangerous like flying in the suit. As if he could. He’s not Iron Man anymore.
His helmet is gone, and Steve has his shield high, ready to strike the killing blow, but he falters suddenly, going pale. He hesitates, a full second, and the murderous edge of his rage is gone, he won’t kill Tony.
“She’s one of my best friends. Pepper Potts, you might have heard of her, she’s a powerful witch that specialises in helping those in need. I might have used her name when I created my fake identity in Ma’Hattan. But she doesn’t mind, since we have a different clientele. Anyways. She knows the King, and she’s friendly. She’ll help you.”
The next weeks went on in much the same way. Steve tidied up, cleaned, cooked, and generally made himself as helpful as possible. All in all, he turned the castle from a troll cave to a homey and cosy place. When they weren’t cluttered full, the rooms where beautiful. Steve liked this castle, he realised.
Steve instantly knew that he was in the presence of the guild leader, Lord Nicholas Fury. He was renowned for his excellent intelligence work and faithful service to the King. Rumours had it he had been instrumental in defeating the invading forces of the Hydra kingdom ten years ago. He was not a man to be trifled with, to put it shortly. Steve stood up and bowed slightly, to which Lord Fury responded with a curt nod.
“I don’t know, everything you see here is normal for this kind of lab. I use transistors and electro-magnetism for the armour, I can show you the plans if you want. Do you have an armour too? Are you Iron Man in your reality as well?”
He grinned at the pair of raised eyebrows and added, almost as an afterthought: “Oh, and remind me to look into Project Rebirth, would you, Rhodey? There’s someone I want to meet. I have the feeling we would get along exceedingly well.”
“So you’re telling me you can’t do anything? That this,” he gestures around them, “is not something you can fix? Why are you here, then?”
Stark’s smile vanished in an instant, his hands coming up to hover protectively around the centre of his chest. His eyes were guarded, and Steve knew that what he would say next would be a lie.
The marks were definitely growing. Would they grow indefinitely? Would they cover Tony’s whole body? What would happen then?
That was something else that surprised Steve. Tony was making jokes about his possible demise. And while it was preferable to crying about it, Steve didn’t know what to think of the dark brand of humour that Tony had adopted.
Into the time gem and Tony should get away but he killed Steve and he can’t move at all and the gem shatters and blows Tony away and
He’d drink until he was sated, and then he would dump their body somewhere it would never be found. He’d fly down, and go back into the fight, and no one would have noticed that he’d been gone for at least fifteen minutes.
If Tony could speak, he would thank Steve. Thank him for giving this to Tony. Thank him for touching him.
Of course, he’d been stupid enough to fall into her trap, but he didn’t care, as long as Tony was safe. Steve would manage.
But there was still the matter of the skull on the mantel of the fireplace. And the disappearances, and how Stark had been seen with one of the victims. Not to mention the coincidence of the appearance of the castle and the missing men and women.
“That’s where you’re wrong, Jocasta. I never fell in love with you. I knew who you were from the start. I was flirting with you because I was searching for Stephen, and you were the only one who could give me clues apart from Janet. I’ve only fallen in love twice, and the first time was Janet.”
The sun was setting, the sky ablaze in red, purple, and orange. The flowers were as beautiful as the last time he’d seen them. He was almost too overwhelmed with the sheer amount of them. Everywhere he turned, he could see different types, all more beautiful than the others. He wouldn’t have the time to make more than two bouquets, the sun was close to the horizon already. He needed to make the best of the light there was.
Steve would do it all in one fell swoop: prepare himself for his meeting with the King and come further with his own investigations (that had been on hold for too long).
“Ok, that’s good, we can throw away that option, it’s one less possibility. So either the gem just decided to show up and cause this, or your unconscious calls it.” Tony’s guessing wildly at this point, but he really hopes it’s the second option, because if not, they’re stuck until the gem’s fancy changes, and that might not happen before they both go crazy and die permanently.
He put one of Tony’s arms around his shoulder, put the shield on his free hand, and stood up. He panted harshly, getting used to the weight. He could do this.
He opened the door that should be the right one, and he saw the castle’s kitchen. He understood what Tony had done, now. Instead of taking up the whole building with his castle, he’d left the shop intact, so that they had a place to sell their spells, paintings, and flowers. Steve just needed to see if there was a door from inside the castle that led to the shop as well. He found one, on the far wall of the kitchen. Perfect.
He stared at his own hand, his own, thin and sickly hand, and suddenly he felt Tony’s weight again, felt every ache in his joints and muscles.
He needed to take a break, to gather his thoughts. Usually, he would take a long walk, or work at the docks, or exert himself. But he couldn’t do that anymore. Besides, any kind of physical effort only reminded him how weak he was, and he hated it. He wanted to find a large log and rip it in half, in an effort to release his anger and helplessness, but he was barely able to
So he sat in the shop and made his brushes during the day, worked at the docks during the evening, and dreamt of painting during the night.
“That’s such a shame, I so wanted to talk to him. Could I wait here until he comes back? I really want to see him.”
He swallowed, looking at Steve again, his face pale, and Steve’s heart stuttered. He hadn’t forgotten that almost-kiss, hadn’t forgotten how Tony had looked at him. Could it be…
Steve opened the door again, and there it was, the fireplace, the messy kitchen, and Jarvis, still looking at him, and was he laughing?
Of course, Steve wanted to know why Tony had gone to miss O’Casta, and he would try to get the information out of Tony, but he could back off if Tony absolutely wanted him to. He knew that Tony was kind, and empathetic, and it wasn’t even that bad that he flirted with a lot of people (if Steve told himself that enough times, he might even start to believe it), so why did Tony insist on painting an unflattering picture of himself? To Steve, who had figured out, albeit with a lot of help from Jarvis, that Tony was a good man?
Steve decided to follow Jarvis’ lead. The fire demon seemed to want to make Steve understand something, and he was curious to know more. Did it have something to do with the pact? Or with Steve’s curse?
He could use his middle name, Grant. Grant Rogers. It wasn’t unusual for cousins to have the same surname, right?
The man recoiled, eyes wide, then hard. Tony guessed that that hadn’t been a good answer. Did the man know his name? It was safe to assume so. But why was he so angry? Did that mean that he was working for the enemy? Or was he an old rival? Did he know of Tony’s extracurricular activities?
Her maw was open wide, a hideous grin that took over her whole face. Her tongue licked Tony’s heart, and Steve knew that she was about to eat it.
It was more a jagged mound of sharp-edged black stones, piled high under the sun. The castle was more dead than alive. It wasn’t moving, ink-black save for the sickly yellow rocks protruding here and there, yellowish smoke oozing out of them like the dying breath of a sick animal. Sulfur smoke, Steve knew, highly toxic. He stayed away from the smoke and its stench.
Steve couldn’t stop from hoping, could he? It surprised even himself, that he tried to be optimistic all the time, when his whole life had proven him wrong.
And if, if Tony wasn’t interested in O’Casta, and if his words earlier were heartfelt, and if Steve remembered correctly that they’d both leaned in, then, well, there was a small, tiny,
At his question, Jarvis assured him that they would arrive within moments. Soon after, Steve saw the vast grounds of the guild for the first time. Natasha had sent him letters, describing the place, but they hadn’t done justice to the real thing. The manor—or should he say castle—was hidden in the middle of a thick forest. From ground level, it would be impossible to find it without knowing the way in. From above, Steve could appreciate the strategic placement of the castle: it had a high tower that was a particularly good vantage point over the whole valley. Not far from it, large clearings could hold outdoors training sessions. There was a lake not too far, the mountains less than five kilometres away. It was an ideal placement for a secretive and elitist guild. The grounds and architectural structures looked pristine and well-maintained. As he flew lower and lower, Steve recognised the faint shimmering in the air that betrayed a magical barrier. He set foot in front of the main entrance, the armour retracting around him and reforming half a meter behind him. It would protect him in a heartbeat, Steve knew. He could feel it, the protective intent.
Tony would sell his soul over and over again if it kept the people he loved safe. It’s not enough to be willing to die for them.
Trying to blink the black out of his vision, Tony groaned weakly and rolled over. His heart was beating out of his chest, and he was shaking all over. He stared up at the light on the ceiling. God, he couldn’t think. His brain was scrambled. What the hell had that been?
Tony was even more graceful in the armour than he’d been out of it, looping and swooping around the Witch, who had lost the advantage, since he was significantly faster, and could hit her from afar. She screamed angrily, her face distorted in the blue and yellow light, and thrust her stingers into the clouds, a loud crackling announcing that she had channelled electricity into them. She hit Tony, and sparks flew as electricity arched through him.
He pushes himself up, meaning to activate his suits, make Steve vent his frustrations on his armours, but Steve sees him move and slams into him.
Jarvis, at these words, burned brighter. He turned almost entirely blue, his flames spewing out of the fireplace, licking the ceiling. His voice morphed, became deeper, more monstrous.
Tony’s in his workshop, and he panics as he tries to understand what happened. There are running footsteps coming closer. He turns to the door as Steve skids to a halt in the workshop, and they stare at each other. Steve’s eyes are so wide, his chest heaving, his cheeks flushed. He looks, and Tony looks back, and he takes a step forward, and suddenly Steve is crowding him into the wall, hands around his face, and Tony has a flash of panic, remembering the last time Steve’s hands were on his head.
As for Stark… He felt a little bad that he was being led on like that, but not enough to pity him. Stark was bound to fall into such a trap sooner or later, anyhow, with his propensity for courting every pretty thing he laid his eyes upon.
His mind’s already racing for solutions. Time travel. It’s a challenge he can’t back away from, a problem he has to solve, now that it’s been dangled in front of him as a possibility. He wants to be the person to make it work, and he still wants to save the world. But especially Peter Parker. Dumb kid who never knew when to stay well away from trouble. Dumb kid who also wanted to save the world.
, and they’re both still alive, and there’s—there could still be a future for the two of them, if not for half the universe.
She smiles at him, looking a little misty-eyed herself, before batting his shoulder. “Now go make me a grilled cheese sandwich. With Kraft Singles. Many Singles. Kraft Multiples.”
“You’re working on that again?” Pepper says, a hand falling gently on his shoulder. “It still looks like the same exact shield to me.”
But Steve just says, “Would’ve been far worse without it.” And yes, that was always his stance, wasn’t it?
“I’m not craving anything except a straightforward answer to my question.” Pepper stalks—well, waddles—towards him. “That’s why we got married, so you could tell me things. And maybe I’d also like a grilled cheese sandwich.”
“I had an uncle called Morgan,” Pepper answers, at the same time that Tony says, “It came to me in a dream.”
, he’s going to break down into humiliating tears if he doesn’t see Pepper right now, why is Cap the first one to greet him? Where’s his
“That’s why I came tonight,” Steve says, voice ragged. “I realised I shouldn’t wait to hear your voice again. I should never have waited.”
“It’s not embarrassing,” Steve says, his shoulder pressing against Tony’s. “It makes sense when you explain it. Rather than being sentimental, it actually seems kind of… spiteful?” His lips twitch into a smile.
He pulls a face at her. “Is this why we got married? So we could just volley the same question back and forth at each other all night long?” He gets up, dances away from her towards the door. “Can I get you something to eat? What’re you craving this fine 3am?”
, he loves her. But there’s some part of him, now that he’s seen Steve, talked to Steve for the first time in two years, that is buzzing and whirring, like the machinery in his workshop when he’s obsessed with a new idea, a new project, something he can’t let go of even in the middle of the night, even when Pepper is calling him to bed.
Steve has been strangely silent the whole time, but now he says, “You have to try. Tony. I don’t want to risk what we have either, but I know I’ll never be able to forgive myself if we don’t try, and I can’t live like that.” He’s sitting on the sofa, gripping a cushion so hard feathers might fly any second.
what trumps everything else. You can’t let go of that because it’s who you are. And you know what Iron Man can’t let go of? Captain America. Because Captain America was meant to be his friend, his partner, somebody who could be by his side through every chaotic situation the world threw at them, and instead Captain America left him bleeding and broken on a Siberian hillside.”
Tony takes both of Pepper’s hands in his and stares into her eyes. “Honey, you can’t be picky about your food here at the end of the world.”
Tony coughs, looking out at the lake and pretending he didn’t hear that, and Pepper’s whispering something in Morgan’s ear that makes her snort with laughter, and Steve’s still got his hand around Tony’s ankle for no reason at all. The sun glitters on the lake, and Tony tries his best not to ask himself how he can make this last forever.
“There you are,” Tony says. Steve had driven here with Natasha but made himself scarce since arrival—Tony hadn’t been able to pin him down till this moment. “Welcome to probably the humblest abode I’ve had my entire life.”
at your actual shield again, but I had it in a corner of my workshop somewhere. So I set about trying to come up with something completely different. And all I could think about was what you’d broken. My arc reactor. I thought it would be… I don’t know,
Not for long, though. He draws in another shallow breath, thinks about Pepper’s hair between his fingers. He’ll dream of her again, he told her so. It’s always her. Always.
“The world hasn’t ended,” Pepper murmurs, her eyes earnest and bright, her voice the softest thing he’s known in weeks, so soft he could lie his head upon it and sleep like a baby for a whole month. “Not for us. We don’t have to resort to Kraft Singles yet.”
Tony doesn’t feel like he’s been passed out long enough for them to have found Thanos already, but who knows. The news doesn’t evoke any emotion in him. He doesn’t really give a damn anymore. “
“Coming here last week… Well, when we saw Barton’s home all those years ago, it didn’t call to me. Not the way it called to you, and made you want all this.” Steve looks around as he did last week and takes in the room, the fireplace, the bookshelves, the candles. “That life, it held no enticement for me, or so I thought at the time. But I’ve come to recognise that it doesn’t really matter to me whether it’s the simple life or the complicated life, as long as I’m fighting alongside people I care about.”
“These tomatoes are gorgeous,” Tony says, eating another slice all by itself. “You really have some green fingers.”
The next morning, Tony says goodbye to his dearest Morguna, and to Pepper, with a shower of hugs and kisses that can’t even begin to convey the depth of his affection for them, and he drives to the Compound with Steve. When he climbs out of the car, he says to Steve, “Wait, there’s something in the trunk you might need.”
Tony goes into the kitchen to refill his glass of champagne and Pepper’s, and on the way out he bumps into Steve. Leather jacket, slicked-back hair. Exhaustion that never fades from his face. Tony wonders if Steve, given the chance, would choose to go back into the ice and sleep for another seventy years.
Alone with Steve again, Tony gives him another kiss, bringing one leg up and bending it to slot alongside Steve’s thigh so that he’s half-kneeling on the chair, but something in Steve’s pocket digs into him. “What on earth have you got in there?” he asks, patting Steve’s pocket.
But he’s back on Earth, the planet he wanted to put a suit of armour around, the planet his weapons once devastated. The planet he was prepared to give his life to protect.
They’d been talking about all the things that Pepper’s been trying to do lately with Stark Industries to help keep the world running with half the population gone, but Tony’s drowsy in the sun now and glad for an lighter topic of conversation.
“It looks kind of like the arc reactor,” Pepper observes, helpfully. “Your original ones, before you got all into nanoparticles or whatever.”
. But you never called. And I never did, either. And then my phone rang, and it was that number on the cell I’d given you, and I thought it’d be you when I picked up, but it was Bruce, telling me the world was ending. I really thought it would be you. But he said you’d gone into space. And you didn’t come back, and we thought you might really be gone, one of the unlucky half, or worse. It was hell. It was hell that you were gone and we hadn’t even spoken in two years and the last time we saw each other I’d nearly killed you.” Steve’s face crumples as he says this, and Tony kisses his forehead, heart bursting.
“That’s because you have no taste,” Tony snipes. “Oh my god, why is it still here? Throw it in the lake! Morguna!” He claps his hands.
Tony has to marvel again at the wonder of it, that Morgan’s never known her father with the arc reactor. Never known Iron Man. Though she’s dipped in and out of the garage and seen all the gear lying around, she is wholly, blissfully unaware of him as somebody who’s saved the world. She only knows him as the person who’s popping another strawberry into her mouth.
to die of anything ending in -tion. If anything is going to bring him to his end, let it be the thought of Pepper, the memory of her voice.
He clears his throat. “Well, this was fun, glad we did this. But I gotta go. Come visit us some time, will you? The baby’s gonna be here soon.”
“I like meatballs and spaghetti,” Steve says, in a slightly dazed tone of voice, which just enriches Tony’s glee.
And all too soon everyone’s leaving. He waves goodbye to Steve and Natasha who are getting in their car, and as they speed off, vanishing down the path through the trees, Tony’s already trying to think of excuses to get Steve to come visit again. He can’t bear the thought of having to wait a year, or even a month, or even—
Steve looks miserable, which is frankly stupid because he was the one who turned up unannounced to broach this subject. “I guess it’s something I’ve thought about, on my part. But you and Pepper are happy together and I don’t want to disrupt that in any way. I just want to be present. To see you more often, to be around to watch your daughter grow up. That’s all I’m asking for.”
“If that’s the case, why are you still playing with it every night? I don’t think that shield is only about what Steve needs.”
It’s Tony’s arc reactor, the one that houses the nanoparticles for Mark L. Tony splutters. “You kept it?”
“Yeah, I know, she’s everything to me,” Tony says, feeling the sincerity of every word he’s saying just as he can feel his own frantic heartbeat in his ribcage right now. “But so are you. It’s funny how those two statements can both be true. Do you believe me?”
like. “We could even just get like some Kraft Singles and bread and just sit on a bench somewhere and eat those, how ’bout that. Just anywhere that’s not the Avengers fucking Compound.”
“You should be embarrassed,” Pepper says, gently jabbing him in the ribs with her elbow. “You made that ‘bad idea’ and then you kept it even after we moved house
“You’ve got a beautiful house, Tony,” Steve says, looking around very deliberately, his eyes sweeping over the whole of the living room. “It’s so peaceful out here. You could forget anything bad’s ever happened in the world.”
The anger comes, like an energy surge, and he’s talking and talking, lashing out with words like Vanko’s electric whips, but none of them are actually the things he’s wanted to say to Steve for the past two years, or maybe they all are—he’s played out their reunion in his head more times than he can count.
Outside, Pepper sits with Morgan in her arms. The sun slanting in at just the right angle catches her hair, a swathe of it flame-bright. She looks up at Tony approaching her with Steve. Steve, who seems utterly astonished by the sight of this baby, like he’s never seen anything so small. Steve, whose hair is the same shade as the champagne in the glasses Tony’s holding, and whose presence here on this porch with Tony and Pepper and the baby makes Tony’s whole world fizz with something like possibility, big bubbles of irrepressible delight.
Steve blinks but accepts it. “This… This family she’s found with us, it’s so important to her. And I think when we were divided, two years ago… That’s caused a great deal of pain and conflict for her.”
Something was thrown into him, sending him back to the floor. The thing, no, the person, was a dark blur. It moved away again, almost too fast for Steve to follow. He stayed on his knees on the ground, watching his hands. They were stained now, where they’d held the person. Stained dark with blood.
is, and Natasha is under strict orders not to accept his advances, just leave enough hints that she might be interested, to make him come back. You see, being on good terms with Stark is beneficial to us. I’ll only tell you because I know you care more about Natasha than Stark, but we’re hoping that he starts giving presents to her. Or that he decides to ally himself to the guild. We could use someone with his skillset.”
There was so much that Steve hadn’t understood about Tony before, and saying it out loud let it free, gave life to his thoughts, and showed him how true his words were. He couldn’t stop the words from tumbling out, they were more for him than the King anyways.
Steve becoming Nomad never really surprised Tony. He’s so attached to his freedom, his ideals are so strong, that he was bound to be disappointed in the government one day or another. What really surprised Tony, however, is that Steve never went back to being Captain America.
Steve hurriedly took a cloth that had been left by a fleeing person and wrapped Tony in it. There was still no sign of the armour, it had to have been destroyed. Steve would thus need to carry Tony all the way home, but how would he do that? It had been hard enough to drag him from the kitchen to the bathroom, and now he’d have to walk uphill with a shield and an unconscious man to carry?
James collapsed to the ground as if he was a puppet whose strings just got cut. Tony cursed again, getting down on one knee to check on James, who was unconscious. What had happened? What had the Witch done? Steve hurried over to help Tony carry James to the couch they’d been sitting in, putting the blanket around him.
“Cap? We lost you there for a bit. Don’t worry about the curse, all right? I’ll find a way to fix it, and Jarvis will help, it’ll be okay. But that means I won’t have the time to do anything but fight it, and I really need your help about the King. I trust you understand why it is of utmost importance that you convince him I’m not good for the job, yes?”
A whining sound behind Steve made him look back. It was one of the armours, speeding towards the fight. It raised its hands, a blue beam shooting out of them and hitting the Witch in her bad arm, giving Tony the time to fly to the armour and change back to a human just as it encompassed him.
It can’t come soon enough. Tony isn’t thinking about much else than Steve, these days. He knows what his essence, his life, tastes like. The metallic tang of the serum-enhanced blood is uniquely Steve. It’s crisp and fresh and bubbling with energy. Tony wonders if Steve’s mouth has the same flavour. Would there be the same aftertaste? If Tony bit his lip, let saliva and blood mingle, would it taste sweet? Would Steve like it? Would he encourage Tony to nip, bite, pierce his skin? Would he blush that same pretty, healthy, rosy shade he did in the gym? What kinds of noises would he make? Would he let Tony do anything he wanted to Steve? Would he submit, would he fight, would he take control? Would he surrender to his arousal, to his desire, to Tony?
Steve crouched, trying to get to eye-level with the animal, but as he dropped down, the dog grew, until it was standing on its hind legs. The fur fell away, the dog’s shape morphing and twisting on itself until it solidified into a man. A naked, shivering man.
He drinks the whole stash of pig blood he has there, guzzling it down until he’s so full he could burst. It spills out of the clear plastic bags onto the floor, Tony’s clothes, the tools nearby. Tony rips everything apart in his feeding frenzy. He’s foaming at the mouth, snapping tools in half, sinking his teeth into anything that will yield enough.
“Don’t you think it’s a bit easy to point Stark as the culprit here? Why would he even make those people disappear?”
Steve approached warily. Had the scarecrow managed to catch up to the castle once again? Why wasn’t it attacking James? And how was James even talking with it? But more importantly,
Steve’s brows draw together, his mouth trembles into a frown, and Tony realises that he’s lost feeling in his legs.
Tony doesn’t want to hear it. He knows he has a responsibility to work. He knows exactly how many people are waiting for him to show himself, to give them directions, to take the lead. He knows, better than Steve, better than anyone, how much is resting on his shoulders. Exactly how much he can’t afford to slack off. Exactly how disastrous him taking a day off would be.
“The first loop I remember is when I, when I suited up and pushed you and”—Christ, he can’t even say it—"and you. You fell.”
There was also the matter of what the man had said. Tony had been looking for Steve? But why? It didn’t make any sense.
He wouldn’t be able to stand it. He’d ask Steve for the coup de grâce, right in the middle of the crowd. Anything but indifference. Anything but emptiness where a decade of their lives should lie.
“This is loop number thirteen. I came to confront you about your betrayal and in the ensuing fight, you died. Then the time gem materialised in my hand, shattered, and I was in front of the workshop door again, but with one less teammate.”
Tony gathered his tunic to his chest, pressing slightly, as if he could push the marks away. He was looking at the floor, blinking silently. Jarvis was blue, a washed-out colour that could only mean he was grieving. Steve felt his own eyes prickles. Why did it have to happen? The conditions were supposed to be impossible to meet, yet they were being fulfilled one after the other. Was there even any point in trying to stop the curse? With the rate of success they had, it wouldn’t be a week before the curse was complete, before Tony would be an “honest mind”.
The armour touches down seconds before the armoured van transporting Steve arrives. Tony slips out of it and into the crowd as the van slows to a stop.
He did, and after twenty minutes of walking, he stood in front of an old and respectable mansion. On the front gate, he could make out the letters V and P intertwined in each other, and a subtle sign that read:
But if Stark wasn’t the cause of the disappearances, who could it be? Steve himself had fit the description of the men that went missing, and he’d been approached by Stark. But it had been the Witch of the Waste who had cursed Steve and forced him to leave town.
“If he’s out for the night, then I won’t be disturbing him. Besides, if I hadn’t come in, you wouldn’t have gotten the extra logs. Also, it’s very late, and I’m exhausted, and weak, and I’m cold, my legs are hurting and I think my heart is tired and I can’t even breathe properly, so if you send me out you might as well kill me on the spot, because I will not survive a night in the hills.”
And Steve had smacked him with a pan and with the shield both times he’d been close enough to the castle to even try to enter it.
Sir Coulson came running in, whispering furiously at the lord’s ear for a moment before running away as swiftly as he came. Lord Fury straightened up, eyeing the armour inquisitively.
When was the last time that Tony and Steve have been so intimate, touching each other from head to toe?
Tony had never heard of any avengers, or their mansion for that matter. Now what? There were two Tony Starks, who clearly lived different lives, and no way to explain why.
“Poor Janet’s heart was getting weak, you see, and I needed a replacement. She was useful, sure, but she’s never quite had the temperament needed to do the things I wanted her to do. She was evil, and cruel, but there was only so much I could do with her. You took care of her for me, good riddance. Your heart, though, Tony… I’ll be able to do great things with it. A troubled past, the right motivation, guilt, lies, it’s perfect. To think that you would have given it to me, had I accepted your offers earlier! You fall in love too easily, it’s always been a fault of yours.”
The castle didn’t stop its ascent, and Steve was forced to hurry to the side as the building clambered on, one of its claws digging into the ground where Steve had stood. Now that he was no longer facing it, he realised that it was moving with a considerable speed. In fact, it walked past Steve in little time, continuing its journey without acknowledging him. He saw a door near the backside and decided he would try knocking. And if no one answered, well, he could always try to force it open.
Iron Man smoothed a hand against the back of his head. He was obviously distressed, but Tony couldn’t guess why. He observed the two men in front of him. Cap was whispering something soothing to Iron Man, both of them seemingly having forgotten that Tony was there with them. He wondered if he should try to make a break for it.
Right, the war. Tony was going to weasel out who won it, even if he was pretty hopeful that the Allies hadn’t lost, judging by Cap’s clothing and the fact that New York was still standing proud. Tony also wanted to know more about Steve to see if he might meet the one from his own reality, because, well, he was a swell guy, and from his time, to boot.
His words came out as accusing, but that was how he felt. He didn’t want to scream at Tony, but now that he was thinking about it, Tony better have a good explanation as to why he hadn’t said anything.
It didn’t matter. He would have to lie to answer the questions of his nosy neighbours and customers, but he didn’t care about that at the moment. He cared about Tony, and the fact that he was yet one step closer to death, and that Steve had done exactly nothing to help. Quite the contrary, in fact.
Oh. So that was why he’d been so sure that Tony wasn’t Tony. God, they looked so alike. Apart from the weird hairstyle and moustache, they could be identical twins. No wonder that Cap had been so sure that Tony was his Tony.
He should move over the hilltop pass to get some protection from the wind, he realised. Judging by his speed up to now, it’d take him another hour before he’d be on the other side of the hill, just enough time before the last dregs of light would be gone.
He can’t remember if he ever specified how he wants to be dealt with when he dies. He must have updated his will after getting Extremis. He’s never wanted a religious ceremony, but he might have asked to be buried with his parents. That can’t happen anymore, naturally. He needs to be cremated, or sealed away, so that no one can touch his body.
He started the walk down to the next hill, his knees aching and protesting against the continued effort. He was still panting from the climb up the first hill, and his chest felt tight. Not to mention that he felt cold, despite the heavy coat.
It was polite knocking, at least, which almost reassured Steve. If it was the Witch, she would have destroyed the door already. Steve was almost entirely sure that it wasn’t her. He still gripped his shield tight.
It’d be so much easier if Tony could stop caring. If he could just switch his feelings off, for real, not just push them so far deep into himself that he manages to pretend he doesn’t have them. If he could look at Steve without having those feelings boil right back to the surface.
And Tony wants to lie, tell him he always knew, just wanted to test Steve, but he can’t lie anymore. Lies got him here, and he’s too exhausted to go on with them. What’s the worst that could happen, anyway? That he’d die? As if. Even death is only temporary in this place.
Tony slammed the faceplate down, because it was that or jump Steve, and ignored the hurt confusion on the Captain’s face.
That was… not bad at all. Kind, even. Steve accepted readily and was directed down to the workshop. There, a blue glow surrounded the handle before the door opened by itself. Steve didn’t stop to think about what that meant, that Jarvis was letting him inside the only space that Stark hadn’t permitted him into. There was a small flame flickering in the air, a part of Jarvis, most likely. Steve followed it into the workshop where it stopped above a peculiar contraption. It looked like a suit of armour, something a knight would wear, but at the same time, it was completely different. The colours, for one, were bright red and gold, alternating in an aesthetically pleasing pattern. It looked sleeker, too. More modern and fast. It glowed lightly. It was clearly designed for Stark, as it was too tall for Steve, but the flame seemed to insist he put it on. He stepped inside of it, slightly apprehensive, and jolted when it closed around him. Immediately, his heart began beating faster. What was he doing, climbing into magical suits of armour? It was as if he was asking to get cursed even worse, God.
So they're on speaking terms in this time? This whole situation is just getting more and more intriguing.
“I know what’s happening!” Stark exclaimed,”At least, it’s the best theory I have right now. Reed was telling me about his latest research into quantum mechanics and his suspicions that there might be multiple universes, and I think that you just proved him right. If you’re from another, parallel universe, then it makes sense that you are me and I am you. Reed is going to love this.”
“Mr. Stark, I’m here to clean up your castle. It’s in total disarray, and you need someone to tidy up, clean, cook, and wash everything that’s dirty. That’s why I’m here.”
They don’t need him to keep things running, anyway. He can delegate, he can, he can make things work. Just for today. Just a few hours, until he feels better.
They were almost constantly touching, frequently forgot about anyone else in the room with them, and shot each other longing glances. Cap lighted up whenever he put his eyes on Stark, and Stark acted like a protective puppy around Cap.
It was very late, but Steve still needed to arrange and present the new brushes he’d made that morning in the shop window, and he doubted he would be able to sleep, his blood still pumping from the near-death experience. It always calmed him to prepare the store for the coming day, arranging the brushes, stacking the canvases, drawing a little something on a sheet of paper with the charcoal to show its quality, sweeping the tiles one last time.
That didn’t really sound like the words of someone who was just looking for a roll in the hay. But when had Tony seen him before? Steve didn’t remember meeting him, and certainly not at an important part of his life.
Tony looked at him with wide eyes, then down at his hand that was splayed across the spot where the marks originated from. He looked back at Steve, face pale, and tried to stammer out an excuse, but he drew in a sharp breath, hunching in on himself. He staggered up, almost tripping over his chair in the process, and pressed his hand over his chest again.
It took an embarrassingly long time for Steve to realise that the man facing him was none other than the former Sorcerer Supreme, Stephen Strange.
“Promise me to never catch a star, okay? I’m serious about this, really. You have to promise me to never, ever catch a star. You don’t know what could happen to you, you have too little magical knowledge, it would end very badly for everyone involved. Trust me, the consequences are not something you want to be dealing with.”
it was, but it looked like a gigantic metal monster. The thing was groaning as its four legs carried it towards Steve. Smoke was spouting from several small chimneys, doors and windows and turrets were protruding from the metal and stone body. From some places, an eery blue light shone through, and the same light appeared to be pooling under the claws of the creature. The whistling and whining were coming from every direction at once, making Steve ears ring. Things that could be eyes but were as likely to be windows were mounted on the front of the thing, seemingly staring right at Steve.
The rock was—moving, for lack of a better word. There was inhuman shrieking emanating from inside of it, or was it beside it? What was happening?
The tricky part was putting all the things back in place. He did his best, but some of them had been on the ground, or in the bathtub, so he put them on the shelves instead. There was room, and it was better like that. Stark couldn’t complain.
He hadn’t done anything useful today, and next to him, Tony was exhausted from using his magic to help someone.
Tony decides to ignore what happened in the last loop, apart from the fact that Steve is apparently already inside the tower when the loop starts—and why is that a surprise, they all live here, for god’s sake—which explains why he was able to enter it two loops ago. Which means that if Tony wants to put distance between them, he’ll have to use one of his stealth armours, and fly carefully, lest he recreate the— he doesn’t think about it.
The first days with Steve were hell. Tony had been so high strung that he almost bared his teeth when Steve insulted him in front of the whole team. When Steve told him to back off, Tony wanted to push him right back, get into his space, and test which of them was stronger. It didn’t come to that, thankfully. They fought against aliens whose blood smelled like decay, Tony flew a missile into a wormhole, and suddenly he and Steve were friends and the Avengers were living in Tony’s tower.
“—I can’t risk going out the red door anymore, she would sense my magic in a heartbeat—maybe if I moved the—I thought my warding spells would hold up better than—what if she saw—why is she even—”
Jarvis was busy fending the shadows off, his glow brightening and dimming in a rhythm known only to him. He shouted at Steve, who was already at the foot of the staircase, to go faster and douse Stark in warm water once he was in the tub. Steve concentrated on dragging Stark without missing a step.
He wraps his arms around him, as if that will stop the biting of the wind and the wet burn of the snow.
The gauntlet is licked clean, the dull shine of the blood replaced with the glistening of saliva. Even the smell is gone, Tony’s done such a thorough job. There’s nothing left. He should have touched Steve for longer. Should have let the blood soak through. Should have offered Steve a ride home; he would have bled all over the armour. Tony shivers at the thought and tries to ignore the raging hunger for more.
Steve might see the predatory glint in Tony’s eyes, or he might mistake it for simple lust. Tony won’t tell him what’s really waiting for him. It’s up to Steve to find out what Tony is, and if he doesn’t realise before Tony makes his move, well, it’ll be easier to get a bite in.
He wasn’t really doing a good job of selling Tony short, was he? He should try harder, lie a little more, say something awful, even if he didn’t mean it.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. You’re okay. I know it’s hard. I know this isn’t, that it wasn’t supposed to be like this. But we’re here now, and we gotta make the best of what we got. You’re here, and I’m with you, and you can do this, okay? We all have bad days. The hardest part is getting out of bed. It’ll go smoother after, trust me. Shhhh, It’s okay.”
Well away from the castle, the armour gained altitude, flying properly now, set in a straight horizontal line with hands and feet pointed behind it. It looked forward and slightly down, and Steve admired the view. It was breath-taking. The grass swaying in the wind, the numerous lakes and ponds in the valleys, the small villages and towns, all passed under him, so far away that he couldn’t make out the people milling around. It was humbling, realising how small he was in comparison to the land, but simultaneously, it was exhilarating. Flying high above everyone, nothing around him save for air, the freedom was immense. He could forget everything up here, forget how weak he was, while he was flying and soaring through the skies.
Steve won’t let Tony skip the sparring. After a few shouting matches (except that’s not true. They haven’t had real shouting matches since the one on the Helicarrier. In fact, Steve and Tony get along well. Too well), the self-destructive not-so-insignificant part of Tony rears its ugly head and whispers that Tony might just as well accept if Steve’s the one to spar with Tony. After all, Tony’s been hungering after a more hands-on encounter with Steve. This isn’t exactly how Tony’s been imagining it, but it’s close enough. Tony accepts, and Steve marches him down to the gym to spar right this instant.
It goes against Tony’s nature. He wants to see people bleed, not patch them up. He knows that this isn’t what someone in their right mind would say. He knows his worldview is distorted, skewed beyond recognition. He isn’t the Tony Stark he was before Afghanistan. He isn’t even better than that Tony. In fact, when he hasn’t slept in a little too many hours, he thinks that he came back worse, rotten through and through where before there was still a healthy core deep in his chest. He thinks that between the shrapnel shredding his heart and his transformation giving him a new one, there is nothing left of the old Tony Stark.
Steve hadn’t, he was sure of it. He’d almost only used the Porthaven door while dealing with customers, and the hills door when he wanted some fresh air. He hadn’t seen any paper or spell, either. How had the spell then—
And it wouldn’t hurt the King not to know. Since Tony had just been appointed court sorcerer, it wasn’t as if the decision could still be swayed by anything Steve did or didn’t say. Which was why Steve kept his mouth shut, bowed again, and let himself be dismissed without complaint.
Steve turned back to miss O’Casta, whose smile had grown. Steve couldn’t understand how Tony could even be interested in a woman that unnerving. Joy, her name was, but she didn’t instil any into—
Tony spends precious time he doesn’t have looking at his sensors, trying to understand how much space he has.
Maybe Tony had been looking for him when he was still a strong and handsome man, because he was looking for his next conquest, and needed someone that lived alone. Steve would have been the perfect candidate for a night of fun: a good body, a lonely soul, and mutual interest. Not that Tony could have known that Steve was interested. But the other things added up. Tony had looked into Steve, maybe to make sure he wasn’t seeing anyone, or to find him at an appropriate place and time. And that was why he’d approached Steve in the alley with the soldiers. But that didn’t explain why the Witch had wanted to know about Steve.
“I’ve tried everything, but I still can’t take off the chestplate. Best I can do is lengthen the time between charges.”
James had gone back to sleep, likely needing to recuperate. After making sure that he had everything he needed in terms of food and water, Steve sat down at the table and started to draft his letter to Natasha.
“See? I don’t have anything to do with any disappearances, and I will never eat any hearts either, so you can calm down now. I won’t deny the seducing part, but you can’t blame me for looking for a bit of fun, can you?”
He’d been working for close to an hour when he heard the bell from the door chime, announcing a customer.
“I’m uh. I’m Steve Rogers. I needed somewhere to sleep and the door was unlocked, so I came in. Thank you for your hospitality.”
Did it have something to do with the curse? What was the last condition again? That he would have to become honest? Was that something Tony was missing, honesty? They weren’t physical things, which almost corroborated Steve’s earlier theory. But how would he know which thing was the right one? Should he try to find a hidden meaning behind Tony’s words? Listen to every word he said, notice everything that could be meant in more ways than one?
Steve’s eyes are half-lidded, his gaze fixed on Tony’s mouth. His body is thrumming with contained energy, but his hands are open and lax against the mat. His thighs flex around Tony. Steve is all power and strength, a mountain lion in a human skin. Right now, he’s giving that power over to Tony. He’s waiting for Tony’s next move, still and silent. The perfect image of obedience. Tony could devour him whole and Steve would only bare his neck to make the access easier. It’s a heady feeling. It’s so easy to imagine a similar scene in a different setting. Steve looking at him like that, surrendering to Tony, sprawled across Tony’s bed. Tony wouldn’t even need to cuff him, he’d stay still just because Tony told him to, using that extraordinary muscle control to move less than a statue. Tony would lick him all over, suck bruises into his neck and collarbones. He’d play with Steve’s nipples, get them nice and hard, until they were as red as Steve’s lips. Tony would nip at his chest, his stomach, his trembling abdominals, skip to the inside of Steve’s thighs, and Steve would just shudder and take it. He would make those high, needy, bitten-off noises. Tony would tease him until he begged for more, until he begged for a real bite, for teeth under his skin, for his blood to leave him. He’d plead for Tony to bite him, suck him, take him.
Tony glanced at Steve quickly. The electric glint in his eyes was gone, leaving them the usual deep blue. He licked his lips.
She knew who he was, because Stark had told her about him? Steve felt something warm in his chest. Stark was telling his friends about Steve. Steve was at least
“I swear this isn’t him. Please, trust me. I know it isn’t him. I can show you, I just need to get the real Tony Stark, I can ask him to come over right now, and--”
He hadn’t been fast enough to run away before the other soldier could load his musket, and now it was too late. From this distance, the bullet would hit him with deadly accuracy.
“The only way to stop them from consuming me is to break the curse. And to break the curse, I have to fight the Witch. But I don’t know if I can do it, so the only option I have left is to try to delay the curse as much as possible, at least until Midsummer Day. If I manage to avoid fulfilling the three remaining conditions, the curse won’t progress.”
He’d lost a good thirty centimetres in height. His face was gaunt, his cheekbones much more prominent under the skin. He’d lost his muscle mass, his arms and legs gangly and too thin to be healthy. His heart was fluttering, his breath came with a slight wheeze. He’d gone from a muscular and tall man to a sickly and short one.
He’s on the floor, bottle in hand, watching the smoke billow above him. In a few minutes, the fire will reach his room, and he’ll be dead. He wonders if the alcohol in his blood will make him light up, a bright flame that will consume itself in seconds. Or maybe he’ll suffocate before then.
Why couldn’t he be taller? Why couldn’t he have said yes to Tony’s offer when they met on that first night? It would’ve been perfect, both of them on a date, and with some luck, he would have spent the night with Tony, who had showed clear interest in his looks. It was a story out of a fairy-tale: a man in danger, another saves him, and they fall in love. Instead, Steve had rejected Tony, gone home, and gotten himself cursed by the damn Witch.
Tony sat down heavily, and while he helped himself to an apple and coffee, Steve tried to smell the air as subtly as he could. Tony wasn’t smelling like alcohol, which was a relief. He wasn’t smelling like anything but himself, and soot and grime. What had he done during the night? Had he still been looking for a cure?
He focuses on the problems he can solve, and doesn’t think about Steve’s unsurprised face, because if he thinks too long about it, his insides shrivel up and his knees get weak.
First, he had to put away all the bottles and products that were littering the floor and the edges of the bathtub. He had to hurry, because when he’d mentioned cleaning the bathroom, Stark had had an alarmed look on his face and told him that the bathroom was
. Do you know why I lured you here? Because this is the fastest way to have Tony come to my castle. Because once he knows that you’re my prisoner, he’ll fly as fast as he can in this little suit of his, because he can’t
Tony ran out again, his magic flaring blue around him, carrying him away from the flash. Not a second later, a black and yellow blur flew past the open door, in hot pursuit.
Did she know what Tony had given Jarvis? Steve didn’t know what to think. Why did so many people around him know what he was thinking, what he was looking for? And how would he even find out?
There was someone in the distance. Who was it? Steve needed to know. He started running towards the figure, taking greater and greater strides, until he was tall and strong enough to sprint towards the man, no, boy, standing still in the water. The boy must have been ten, his dark hair glinting in the starlight. He was holding a star in his hands, preventing it from reaching the water. It was jumping wildly around, light spilling from between his fingers. Steve was still running, but he couldn’t come closer. A star fell before him, slipped between his outstretched hands, fizzling out when hitting the water.
“You gave me my heart back, Steve. I’ll always be grateful for that. But now that I have it, and I can do what I want with it, my only wish is to give it to you. Will you accept it?”
Was Tony still going to Shield? It looked like he’d stopped as soon as he’d met O’Casta, but Steve hadn’t outright asked him. But then again, he hadn’t gone to O’Casta today. But he’d left through the black door. Did he want Steve to believe he was visiting miss O’Casta while he was courting someone else instead?
“This ends now, Tony. I’m bringing you in, and you’re going to tell me everything you know, and then the Illuminati will have to face the consequences of what you’ve done. No more special treatments. Hah. I should have made good on that promise the first time, instead of giving you the benefit of the doubt. I can’t
He wants to turn around and wrap himself around Steve, but he can’t move. His muscles are paralyzed, he’s gasping for air. He lies there, curled up, chest heaving erratically, and Steve is there, holding him close. A warm hand is in the middle of his chest, tugs him until their bodies slot together. It’s heavenly. Tony hasn’t felt this warm in months.
He doesn’t even have the time to ask why they’re breaking into his workshop when they could just have opened the door. No, Thor, Black Widow and Hawkeye are already circling him, and Steve stands there, asking him who broke first, and Tony can’t help but point out the obvious: Steve did, and he doomed them all in the process.
Steve is not a man that Tony can put into neat little boxes. He’s tried, but just when he thinks he knows who Steve is, a new side of his personality makes itself known. Steve is so much more than a soldier. He’s so much more than the man out of time. He’s devastatingly intelligent, emotional to a fault, and predictable until he isn’t.
And why exactly was Steve thinking that? It had nothing to do with Natasha, nor with anything important.
But it was unfair that Stark was so easy on the eyes. Steve had had a vague image of him in his head after overhearing the gossiping old ladies, but it had been of an older man, with greying hair and a long beard, not this attractive man.
He was woken up by the sound of a door closing. He blinked, tried to remember where he was, and sat up straight when he realised that James wasn’t in the kitchen. Had he gone out? Was there something wrong?
It sounded simple enough. Find a way to break the contract and get his body back. Steve had nothing to lose.
Steve gasped. It really was personal between the Witch and Stark. Somehow, Steve had forgotten that things could turn out this badly. After all, when he’d met her, she had threatened to kill him as well. But still…
Steve spluttered, trying to understand how they’d gone from Stark waking him up to outright teasing him, Jarvis joining in on the teasing, no less! He was a bit embarrassed that they were making fun of him, even if he understood that they meant well. But captain? That was taking the joke a bit too far, wasn’t it? Steve was hardly fit to be captain of anything in his current body.
“I’m not done, my dear. Now, what to do? I could kill you, of course, but that would make him angry. I just don’t want you to meddle, you understand. One would have thought that the mere thought of being the concurrent of the Witch of the Waste would dissuade you, but yet here we are.”
There was nothing human about Jocasta anymore. She was half fire, half metal. Her flesh had melted away, revealing a metallic frame that bore an eery resemblance to Tony’s suits of armour, if they had been the colour of silver, and pooling and melting in the fire.
Steve looked at Jarvis, who had a concerned expression (at least, that was how Steve interpreted the duller glowing of the fire). Jarvis turned to look at Steve and spoke quickly:
Tony thinks that the only thing that Steve’s been doing is shouting at Tony and bashing his head in, but he keeps the comment to himself. Best not to anger the man who has your life in his hands.
Stark came over to look and Steve handed him the paper with the first verse of the mysterious spell. Stark frowned, read the spell again, then looked at Steve.
Tony wonders what Yinsen would say to him now, lusting after Steve, ready to kill or be killed over a few drops of blood.
“Iron Man, you’re famous for giving people the benefit of the doubt. Why are you so suspicious now? We should try to find ways to help Mr. Stark get his memories back.”
And then there was a letter to the Avengers, that said that Steve wanted to be on his own from now on, wanted to embrace the Nomad title, wanted to travel the world and help other people and he’d loved his time as an Avenger but it was too intertwined with Captain America and he needed space and he would come back, but not for a long time, and please don’t try to find me.
It’s not all that bad. He has enhanced strength and regeneration to make hunting humans easier, and garlic isn’t dangerous to him, it just fucking stinks.
Steve wondered if they had progressed further since the last time he had seen them. He should probably ask Tony about them. And try to mend bridges after having told him right in his face that he was a liar.
The lab was even worse. There were all kinds of machines, several other Iron Man suits, and terrariums of ants, which was unexpected. Iron Man immediately set about scanning Tony with several gizmos. Every time the scans came out negative for whatever he was looking for, he huffed out a breath. Cap was on the side, alternatively watching Iron Man and Tony, sending them both increasingly concerned looks.
Steve needed to talk to him, ask his name, know where he stood. He wouldn’t let someone that was linked to the Witch court Natasha. Who knew what she had planned? But if the weredog had attacked Tony out of jealousy or protectiveness, well, that would be better. And if Natasha loved him too, there was a bigger chance that he was one of the Witch’s victims rather than an accomplice.
“I didn’t want to intrude, you and Tony were so excited to talk science. But, uh, I know some things about what you’re feeling. I’m from the 1940’s too.”
Tony’s getting sloppy. He needs to be more careful of what he says, lest he gives too much away to Steve. There’s no need to complicate things further. Besides, it wouldn’t be welcomed by Steve.
“I need to tell you— I fled from the Witch as soon as I could. She didn’t need me anymore after she cursed you, she knew everything she needed to know about you already. She just…left without me. I tried to go back to Natasha, I hadn’t seen her in so—so long. But I got stuck in the bushes, it’s hard to control my left foreleg—arm. You saved me. Thank you. I went back to Natasha, I had to tell her about the curse, about you.”
In the middle of the kitchen, Jocasta stood triumphant, Jarvis’ fire almost out behind her. She tossed James to the ground, where he was immediately restrained by a suit of armour. Steve tried to shake his own suit off, but it was like trying to escape iron bars.
When they’re both ready for sparring, they circle each other, both waiting for the other to attack first. Tony suspects that Steve wants Tony to make the first move, to gauge his skills, and react accordingly. Tony wants Steve to go first because then he’ll have a baseline of what a normal human should be able to do and dodge. Steve will go easy on him, and Tony needs that to understand how much of his strength he needs to keep under wraps. If none of them sets this in motion, they’ll turn in circles forever. Can Tony risk to attack? He’s watched Clint and Natasha, he can copy them. But would it be weird for him to be as strong as Clint? Or as fast as Natasha? Maybe he should tone it down. But not too much, because then he’ll come across as a weakling, and that is something the hunter in him bristles at.
The next time someone mentioned the name Stark, it was one of Steve’s customers, Mrs. Carter, a regular. She’d been a good friend of Steve’s mother, and she’d stayed a friend of the Rogers’ even after her passing.
The last words were uttered in a voice that wasn’t his own, a voice devoid of emotion, cold and dead. He’d stopped moving, and Steve and Tony with him.
Steve has disappeared inside the workshop, and the world is going grey around Tony, the colours bleeding away and dying before his eyes. In less than a minute, Steve is out again, furiously calling at Tony, looking everywhere for him, and the gem appears again, and Steve looks at it and scowls. He doesn’t look surprised. The orange washes over them both.
It was his turn to laugh at the flabbergasted expression on Stark’s face. Never let it be said that Steve couldn’t taunt back.
In some way, they’re killing each other. Tony was in the way of the bullet meant for Steve, and Steve’s collateral of Tony losing control of his life.
“Okay. I don’t like this, so I’m going to cast a little healing spell to make you better. Agreed? Agreed.”
Wasn’t this what Tony wanted, just a few days ago? Wasn’t this what he begged Steve to do? Wasn’t this what was supposed to happen? Tony’s always had a martyr complex, everyone’s told him so. It’s only fitting that he die like this. He wonders what the papers will say tomorrow. Will they say something about enemies reunited in death? Will they try to turn this into the ultimate sacrifice for liberty? Will they…
“She wanted my memories, wanted to know everything about the blond man Stark was looking for. Wan—wanted to know about Steve Rogers. She shocked them out of my brain, her stingers, the electricity, it was—”
He screamed in agony and rage as he got himself to his feet, using his shield to deflect her blows. He had to make it quick before he lost consciousness.
“He’s good at building things, his automatons, his suits, his spells, but he’s a coward, hiding in his castle. He didn’t even come to see you in person because he’s so scared of the Witch of the Waste, and isn’t that pathetic? That this man can’t even see the King? Because he’s working so hard on trying to find a way to save his own life. He tried to pretend that nothing was wrong, but when I confronted him, he told me, and I’m humbled by his honesty, even if he lied to me before. But I think it’s a defence mechanism for him. It’s easier to pretend you don’t care, let people believe the worst of you, than to try to prove them wrong.”
Tony’s design for the central circle was even more complicated, concentric circles filled with symbols and shapes that seemed random but were anything but. When they were done, the five circles lit up with a strong white light.
He turned to look at the castle, but the door he had just closed wasn’t attached to a monstrous building. Instead, there was a small shop window, with flowery letters painted on it that proclaimed it was
They were in love, Tony realized. They were in love with each other, but they didn’t know the feelings were reciprocated.
A thud from the stairs jerked them apart. James was heavily leaning against the ramp, hands gripping his head, panting heavily, groaning as he fell to one knee.
“Imagine my surprise when I answered the door one day and you were there! Beautiful as always, just waiting for the curse to sink into you. It had taken me so long to slip the first half of it through the door, but I didn’t even need to try with the second half, since you came to me! I was delighted, even more so when you started flirting with me. Here you were, oblivious to whom I was, and you were even trying to spend more time with me. I just had to play hard to catch, until you invited me home and I could take your heart.”
At first glance, the room around him bore a striking resemblance to the old gym in his family mansion. It had the same kind of wallpaper, the extra thick one that could withstand a little wear and tear.
He whispered the last part of his sentence, feeling the tell-tale chill run up his spine at the mere mention of the forbidden magic. If Stark dealt in that kind of magic, then Steve had to leave. Immediately. There was a good reason black magic was prohibited.
. The super-serum-enhanced blood, to be even more precise. The serum drives Tony crazy. It elevates the scent of Steve’s blood from enjoyable to tantalizing. It’s suffocating, it’s all Tony can think about. He wants to wrap himself up in the smell, follow it to its source, sink his teeth into yielding flesh, and
He couldn’t let the scarecrow in. He had done enough damage today already, and he would be damned if he let this happen as well.
Now that his mind was free of insidious whispers, Steve could enjoy the view of the city beneath him, glimmering in the sunlight. It was beautiful, the copper roofs reflecting the light in fiery orange, deep green, and almost black flashes. The wealth of the town was undeniable, everything glittered and shone.
The marks covered his whole chest, one tendril reaching as far down as the hollow of Tony’s belly button. Another was circling his ribs, yet another was creeping up the base of his throat. They were even darker, the ones nearest the centre of his chest almost black.
Tony just needs to play nice with Steve, make him think he's won. Tony wonders if he can make Steve fall for him. The groundwork's already there, a certain video of Steve talking to Tony Stark's body is proof enough. This Steve wants someone he can measure himself against. This Steve wants to have a Tony and shatter him into a thousand pieces. Steve is so obsessed with his own superiority that he hasn't recognised the bigger predator in the room. He's about to be devoured for his oversight.
Tony’s heart was lying unprotected on the ground, a metre away from Jocasta’s severed hand. Jocasta herself was scrambling for the heart, her shape morphing into something more animalistic to gain traction.
For a while, there was nothing but blue and twisting and pain, and Tony desperately trying to scream through empty lungs.
He wondered what Natasha thought about this. Did she agree with the guild leader? She was a very goal-oriented person, Steve knew, and was more calculating than himself. He didn’t know if he approved that about her, but he understood that where he could use his brute strength to intimidate people or win fights, she had to rely on her wits. She was whip-smart and wasn’t afraid to use it to outsmart others. Now that he thought about it, this might be right up her alley. He would have to ask her the next time they saw each other.
He left through the black door, Steve practically biting his nails as he realised that he was going to be alone in the castle with the very real possibility that the Witch would come knocking. There was Jarvis, too, but the fire demon looked as distressed as his master, the flames spluttering and changing colour, as if he didn’t know what to feel.
“I never loved you, Jocasta, because I was already head over heels for Steve. You never stood a chance.”
James was sitting at the table already, eating a…raw…piece of bacon. He had some animalistic tendencies left, then. Steve sat down, too exhausted emotionally and physically to bother using the pan. He wasn’t even sure he’d be able to lift it. He cut a piece of bread and tried to forget what he’d been dreaming about.
It was only fair that he wrote down everything that had happened to him, from the curse—right, he still couldn’t tell anyone about it. Maybe it was for the best that James had told Natasha—to meeting Tony, to somehow living with him and working with him. He couldn’t mention Tony’s curse, but he could say that he needed to help him. Natasha would without doubt interpret it as another example of Steve’s “heroics”, as she called it. She always teased him about it, that he couldn’t walk past someone in need without giving his all to help them. And what if he did? It was the right thing to do.
Steve liked the bakery. The people working there were always friendly, and if he helped with carrying the bags of flour, he’d get a free
Tony hurriedly went to his room to change into a white tunic and fitted black pants. When he came back, he smiled at Steve and said:
But where should he start? He had to understand who this spell was for, who the “me” was, what it was about, and what the second verse was. It could be a spell to help someone do something difficult, since the instructions he had to follow were nearly impossible to complete. Was it a spell for good luck? But what about the honest mind? Was it to discern who lied and who didn’t? If this was a lie-detecting spell, it would be useful on Stark, Steve mused.
So Stark was powerful. He cast excellent spells, had the best ingredients, was most likely a genius if the automatons were any indication. But he was underpaid and seemed to be okay with that.
Tony looks back down at Steve. He’s staring into Tony’s eyeslits, blood slowly seeping from his mouth.
He can’t realistically visit him every day in his cell. People would talk. This is the perfect opportunity to see him with his own two eyes as opposed to through a video camera lens.
You made me believe everything was fine, while this threat was always hanging over our heads. And you think you can just decide for everyone that it’s best if we don’t know about it? The
It wasn’t satisfying enough a taste, but the salty tang ripples through Tony. It’s more than he should know about Steve, and yet it’s not enough.
Stark was agitated, looking between Jarvis and Steve with pursed lips and unhappy lines in his face.
“You’ll find that a lot of what they say about me is less than true, miss. If you would like to spend some time with me, I could show you how wrong they are.”
They stayed side by side for a long while, looking at the flowers and the Waste looming behind. Tony was deep in thoughts, his frequent rubbing of his chest betraying what he was thinking about. Steve, for his part, was processing what both Tony and Jarvis had told him. Tony had used the same words as Potts when he described how Janet had turned into the Witch of the Waste. They’d both talked about a corruption of her heart. Was this what was happening to Tony? The marks did originate from the centre of his chest, near where his heart was.
They kept at it for a while, devising crazier and crazier theories about Tony, half of the words they used foreign to him. When they had gone through their frankly ridiculously long list of possible ways this wasn’t really Tony (for Iron Man’s part) or how Tony would have lost his memories (for Cap’s part), they nodded at each other, and turned as one towards Tony.
Steve won’t let it lie. He insists. Tells Tony he needs the practice. What if his armour is incapacitated? He needs to be able to stand his own, can’t he understand that he isn’t invincible without his suit? Tony wants to answer that the day someone gets him out of the armour will be the last day of that person. He’s itching to sink his fangs into anything, anyone, when he fights, and if he gets out of the armour, it’s game over for everyone. Including himself, of course, because then everyone will know what he is. He’s honestly surprised that it hasn’t happened already. Maybe JARVIS is making sure that the opportunity never arises. God knows that
He turned to face the late customer and tell them that the shop was closed. He was met with a petite woman with a dark brown bob and a yellow dress that highlighted her hourglass waist. She was flanked by a pale, brown-haired man, who had dull grey eyes. He exuded an air of misery, and favoured his left side, where Steve noted that his arm was covered in what looked like armour, but it had a weird shimmering to it, which hinted at magic. When the man saw Steve, he whispered something to the woman, who smiled.
They looked at each other, then back at him, and Cap said: “We’re in Avengers Mansion, in New York City.”
Speaking of, Cap was blinking owlishly at Stark. He swallowed, licked his lips, and, inexplicably, blushed. It took two tries before he could get a word out.
The first human blood Tony tasted was Obadiah’s blood. It was leagues better than animal blood. It was fresher, richer, tastier. Cow blood was to human blood like piss-cheap beer was to a decade-old single malt whiskey. There was no comparison to be made.
Stark was outright grinning now, looking between Steve and the frying pan as if he was imagining the scene.
It wasn’t much, but it was a beginning of a plan. It shouldn’t be too hard, he reasoned, especially since they knew what to avoid.
Why? It’s nothing—It’s not asking for much, just for a little while, just until Tony doesn’t feel like he’ll liquefy into a small pool of misery. Just a minute. Not even that. He just wants to feel something, anything else than this black hole of despair.
He walked out, taking in the fresh afternoon air and looking at the surrounding mountains. Behind him, the castle stopped, then turned around. Jarvis was going to follow him, was he not?
Stark was now just as red as Cap. They turned to look at each other, hope evident in their eyes, and Tony congratulated himself on a job well done as the blue enveloped him.
The super-soldier serum will be the death of Tony, or Steve, or both. The smell alone is divine. Tony can’t imagine what the taste will be like. He won’t be able to stop once he gets his teeth into Steve. He’ll suck and suck and suck until Steve dies or until Steve kills Tony. It’s inevitable.
“What’s going on, old buddy? I’m sure you and Mr.Stark can come to an agreement. I don’t want any of you to be hurt.”
Steve had been so sure that Tony had stopped with his courting when he’d realised that the curse had caught up with him, but he couldn’t be sure, could he. Maybe O’Casta had been worried because she hadn’t seen Tony in a while? Was she developing feelings for him? Had he managed to pique her interest?
Alerted by the sound, the boy turned to him, his eyes a deep, deep blue, and reached out towards Steve. Steve reached back, but he was falling through the water, through the blue and green and orange glow.
And yet, with his armour dead around him, cutting into his face, Tony wished for nothing else than to die.
“I have my sources, of course. Don’t worry, I won’t tell Stark about your identity, nor the curse. But you should be informed that anyone involved with him in any way becomes a person of interest to the King, and thus to Shield. All for the kingdom’s security, you see.”
And that’s the thing, isn’t it? Tony doesn’t know either. If all other teammates escaped the time loop, it means they weren’t relevant, and that this is something that concerns only Steve and Tony, since no one else has been forced into the loop.
Besides, he could always get used to his body as it was. He’d spent months in it already, and if he was careful, it wasn’t so bad. There was a distinct advantage, which was that people underestimated him a bit. Or fussed over him more.
much stronger than he looked, now that Steve could appreciate his muscles without them being covered in green slime. He had to be almost on level with pre-curse Steve. For some reason, that made Steve feel a little hot under the collar. Imagine what two strong, healthy bodies could do in the height of—
