As Tony was about to say something, Sam interrupted. “Yeah he gets like that sometimes,” he said sadly, “It happens when he remembers stuff, he thinks I don’t know but I do.”
“Uh, yeah, actually. I write comics.” Steve puts his sketches back in his bag and meets Tony’s gaze head-on. “So…”
“I'm ー I'm fine, JARVIS, promise.” Steve draws in a breath that does little to calm him before pushing himself to his feet. “Is anyone else up?”
His phone vibrates across the table, a loud dance that is annoying enough to cause Pepper to stumble in her speaking. She cuts a frosty glare in Tony’s direction before pushing on; he smiles apologetically, grabs up his phone, and hastily unlocks the device.
“He demanded a bath, didn’t he?” asks Tony after a short pause, but he makes his way down the hall anyway; Steve goes with him so he can answer Tony’s question without yelling.
Steve stares at him intently; Tony resists the urge to squirm under the scrutiny. Finally, Steve’s expression softens, and he smiles that sweet, understanding smile that Tony loves so much.
Steve jerks away from Tony, stumbling in his haste to separate their bodies; Pepper’s face is white with splotches of angry red high on her cheekbones. Her pale eyes are narrowed with rage. File folders lay in a jumbled pile at her feet, papers splayed out on the concrete. She takes a step forward, not seeming to care that her heels are wrinkling and tearing holes in the papers. Steve smoothes down his shirt, pushes his hair out of his face, ignores the heat in his cheeks as he meets Pepper’s furious gaze.
. Tony slips a hand between their bodies, thumb against Steve’s clit, varies the pressure and pattern, and Steve cries out brokenly. His walls convulse, squeeze Tony’s dick rhythmically, and Tony thrusts once, twice, three more times and comes; his vision goes hazy at the edges, but Steve’s face, sweaty and twisted in pleasure, is crystal clear, is the most perfect thing Tony has ever seen.
“I know, but hopefully Little Miss will make this easy on you. I’ll be back in a few minutes to check on you.”
“I usually am. Now, c’mon. We have successfully prevented a potentially fatal catastrophe. We should definitely celebrate, preferably by being naked in our bed for the next, oh, six to seven hours.”
He immediately gives chase, and Tony laughs breathlessly when Steve catches up to him just inside the bedroom.
Steve glances over to see Craig leaning forward, eavesdropping. “Ma'am, would it be all right if we spoke in privacy?”
No one speaks until the last bite of scrambled eggs and bacon are gone; Coulson pulls a legal pad from the briefcase Steve hadn't known he was even carrying, and everyone shifts in their seats, a minute change in the atmosphere. The time for fear is gone. Now it's time for business. Steve lets the others tell the story in halting sentences, unable to put his thoughts into words.
“Don’t be. You know me ー the futurist who tries too hard,” Tony bites out; the bitterness in his voice is sharp, venomous.
She hangs up before Tony can get a word in. He covers his face with his hands and laughs, because if he doesn’t laugh, he might just freak out some more. By the time he calms himself, his bots are gone somewhere around the workshop, and JARVIS is suspiciously quiet. Tony finishes the runthrough of video feeds, then calls it a night.
“I, I think we did that, yes,” Steve replies a bit breathlessly, and Tony starts laughing immediately.
. “My apartment is too quiet now. I, uh, I figured we’re friends now, and friends hang out, right? But if I got it wrong, which happens a lot no matter how much I'm loathe to admit it, if I'm wrong, tell me, and I'll leave, no questions asked.”
Bruce hands Steve a plate with French toast piled high. “Do you think – Well, won’t Fury be pissed about the deception?”
Tony sends a relieved smile in Pepper’s direction as she stops next to the table. “Steve’s still refusing to call you anything other than ‘Ms Potts’ in public.”
Pepper walks away laughing. Tony spends the next ten minutes being congratulated (and sending the well-wishers in Steve’s direction; “He’s doing all the work, really”) and making sure his partner isn’t getting too overwhelmed by all the attention. He hands Steve gifts one by one, watching as more and more baby-related items are opened: Boxes of diapers, multiple three-packs of wipes, outfits and onesies, blankets, bottles, pacifiers… Tony loses track of everything. Sam, Thor, and Natasha gather up the presents, take them to the penthouse, while Coulson and Tony pick up the wrapping paper from the floor. Bruce keeps Steve company, discussing all the information given in the pregnancy books.
finish that sentence,” sighs Steve. “I’m begging you, Tony, to keep the rest of that sentence in your brain.”
Tony steps off the elevator and straight into a waiting Steve’s arms. He allows himself to melt into the comfort of the super-soldier’s embrace, breathes in deep the scent of everything so purely Steve. When they separate, he drops his briefcase onto the floor and heads to the kitchen.
. He lifts his hips against Tony's, relishes the moan that reverberates from the other man's chest. Tony moves slowly, carefully, as he helps strip Steve of his clothes, as he removes his own, as he touches Steve with admiration and care. When Steve is crying out from sensitivity, from frustration, Tony lays on his back and gingerly lifts Steve to straddle him. Steve can't stop the gasp of pain when Tony’s cock breaches him, stretches him with a slight burning that eventually gives way to something much more pleasurable, and Steve moves over Tony, around Tony, rising and falling with an unsteady rhythm. Tony's hands are hot, solid, on Steve's waist as he assists Steve in the motions; his thighs press against the curve of Steve's ass as he snaps his hips up to meet each of Steve's thrusts.
“Now, with that, I must go. I have my duties that I am neglecting in order to explain myself. Congratulations again, Avengers. Remember that you
. He struggles to sit up before either of them can react. Unfortunately, Don gets his bearings rather quickly, shoving Steve back onto the cot.
Her brow raises in question, but she doesn't say anything about it. “Mind if I give him some honeydew?”
Steve glances at the notebook, a simple star printed on the red leather. An innocuous design, but Steve recognises it. They all do. Tony strides across the room, picks the notebook up, and immediately disappears down the stairs with it. Bucky doesn't relax, though. He's agitated, his body a line of panic and tension, practically vibrating. Tony comes back sans notebook and stops in front of Bucky. His hands hover uncertainly over the expanse of Bucky's shoulders, momentarily shaking a mere inch from the red Henley that Bucky is wearing, before Tony visibly swallows and lowers his hands to grip the others man's biceps.
"A literal goddess just gave us a penis-shaped candle and told us to burn it while we bang! What the Hell has our life become?"
. The slick drag of Tony against Steve’s insides has Steve panting for breath almost immediately. Tony moves slowly, pressing forward only once Steve has had a moment to get accustomed to the girth, and eventually, he stops with his hips against Steve’s ass.
“I can’t have kids. I’m not saying I’m not physically able to,” he amends when Steve opens his mouth to question it. “Last time I checked, I had the swimmers. But Steve, I’m not… I’m not the person you should have kids with. I work way too much, I drink too much. I go out and get myself shot and beat up while in a glorified tin can on a semi-regular basis. I own a multinational company which means that not only am I always gone – I mean, seriously, this is the second time we’ve had sex in over three weeks – but I’m also targeted for abduction or assassination, which means people I love are also targets. It’s bad enough that you and Pepper are my biggest weaknesses. I can’t do that to a kid.”
“Don’t – Well, actually, be sorry, because you jumped to the worst possible conclusion, so being sorry is completely acceptable.” Tony tightens his grip, nuzzling into Steve’s neck. “If I could make a suggestion, though? Ask outright, preferably without the judgement, and…I cannot believe I’m the one saying this, but don’t keep things bottled up, especially if it has to do with our relationship. We’re gonna have a kid soon-ish, so we better start working on our communication skills now.”
“Would you stop? Tony, when I was doing my research into finding you, I realised which building you were in. That means I realised who you are. So, yeah, I did a little Google search on you ー nothing invasive, just what I had to look forward to ー and I know that, no matter what, I want to be here with you.”
Steve waits until he hears footsteps going up a set of stairs, then opens his eyes. The ceiling above him is unfinished: Pipes and wire crisscross the underside of the boards. There are only two bulbs hanging from the rafters, but they put off plenty of light. Concrete blocks, painted a deep blue, make up the walls surrounding him, and the small windows near the top tell him he’s in a basement. Voices near the stairs, and Steve hurriedly closes his eyes again. He tenses when he recognises two of the voices.
"Nay, young Spider. 'Tis mine own fault." Thor looks away. "We neglected to tell thy the importance of wielding Mjolnir."
went on the field trip to the labs. And 14 of them went to the spider exhibit. 8 of them were there when the spider got loose. And 2 of them were next to it. One of them was bitten.
Tony stares at the device. Its never had this much power before. "Woah... how?" Tony asks, fumbling for words.
Tony grabs his phone, and dials Steve. He starts talking before Steve can even say hello. "Steve, Peter hasn't been eating enough because of his increased metabolism. He's literally going to starve himself to death!"
“Natasha, don’t tell me what to fucking do.” Steve glares with a horrible calmness in his voice. “My son will do whatever he god damn well pleases, and we’re going to back to him up. End of discussion.”
"It was me. I was testing you. See, Cap kept insisting that you needed to be able to defend yourself and such, and so I decided to test you, and see if you would need training. Congrats! It only took you about thirty minutes to decide to call someone for help." The archer explains, lying with ease. It makes him feel sick, lying to Peter. But he has to know what the boy is up to.
Right now, Peter is at the table. He's is tapping his fingers against it. He looks a mess. His eyes are wide and unfocused. His hair is a sticking out in all directions. He just... he looks
Peter shakes his head. "No. It's not here. Wait- did you just say it escaped?!?" He exclaims, jumping onto the ceiling.
The two of them head down to the school. When they arrive, the first thing Clint notices are the webs.
Shit. They want to make a Spider-army, don’t they? “Because a spider was mean.” Peter is going to be as vague as possible while still answering his questions.
Natasha ducks out of the way, and runs over to Tony. "You alright?" She asks, sending another jolt of electricity at the symbiote, who screeches once again.
The door opens. Fury is there. “Stark, what is happening? Who’s the Spider-guy? And why aren’t you reading my emails? Someone other than Thor has lifted his hammer, and I intend to find out who.”
Peter fidgets nervously with his shirt. Then, suddenly, there's a loud noise. Metal grinding into metal.
Steve smiles, probably having no clue what we're talking about, but enjoying us enjoy it all the same.
"Dude, nah. What, do you think I'mma go let myself get yelled at? No way, man. If Penis Parker wants to talk to me, he can do it himself. Later, asshole." Flash shoves the hero to the side, and walks away, confidence evident in his stride.
Tony is in his armor, blasting at a black-slime creature. As Natasha races into the fray, she tries to think of where she's heard of this.
“Besides, who am I to change and destroy people’s lives? Who am I to just do what I feel like because I have powers? Who am I to be Spider-Man?” Peter asks, not really asking for an answer.
Tony glares at him. "Peter is gone." Tears are streaming down his face, but he doesn't care. "I'm going to the lab. I'm going to find him." He shoves Steve out of the way. "I'll find him." Tony whispers. "I will."
"Steve... Peter is a super-hero. He invented his own tech to help him, like me. He ran away because of me. He came back because of me. He's too much like me. I wanted to teach him, make sure that he'd be better than me. But now... Steve, I don't want him to be the me from before. The weapon-building me. I don't want that for him. I... I want to protect him, but I don't know how. I'm as worthless as my father." Tony looks down.
“This is for you,” announced Tony as he headed to the altar. When he returned to his seat, he held an ornate box in one hand and the flowers in the other. “These are gifts, physical tokens of our gratitude for all that you’ve done for Steve and me. Without you, we would never have had this chance. So, thank you.”
Steve flashes a smile at the other man and digs into his breakfast. His plate is clear in record time; he thanks Bruce again, drops a kiss to Tony’s forehead, and heads to his art studio. Once he’s seated on the tall stool, he grabs the nearest sketchbook and soft-leaded pencil. The image is unclear on paper, just sloping lines and shadowy spaces, but he can see the finished product so clearly in his mind. Golden light slants in through the large windows, trails in increments across the cool wooden floor, illuminating the furthest corners of the room. He knows that if he looks up, he’ll see faces on the walls, his past and his present displayed together for him to always see.
His mood slowly gains a tripwire during the course of the first week, to the point that the only people who spend more than ten minutes with him are Eira and Natasha; even Havardr tends to while away his days in Thor’s quarters. Steve tries to not snap at the others, he really does, but his best is obviously not enough, because more than once, he finds himself apologising for being short and irritable with his friends.
ー is whisking eggs in a large bowl, the sound of metal against plastic slightly grating but still so familiar, the muscles in his shoulder and back rippling underneath the shirt he's wearing, and he's got his face turned to the right, smiling a soft, little smile that's melted on the edges with every positive emotion he could possibly be feeling right now, smiling that smile that Tony would kill to see but instead it's, it's aimed at…
he’d continually remind Tony whenever Tony mentioned Steve’s age), he finally managed to show up in Tony’s dream. He’d gone to bed later than usual, since Bucky had convinced him to stay up past the time Ma went to bed, so they could sneak back into the living room and watch some scary movie, so when he slipped into REM sleep, the darkness behind his eyelids slowly gave way to a thin strip of light. He could see shadows moving past, hear the sounds of hard soles of shoes against stone, and he realised that the soft glow came from a hallway and he was in a room. With a deep breath meant to calm himself down, he stared around the room, straining his eyes to see
“Because you're drunk. I-I won't take advantage of you like this. You can say you want it now, but you could wake up and realise it wasn't what you wanted. I won't do that to you.”
Steve doesn’t wait for Tony to comply, just grabs his wrist and places his hand. Tony feels nothing but the movements of Steve’s breathing. He sighs, closes his eyes again; he is nearly asleep again when his brain registers the new sensation against his palm. His head pops up, and he stares at Steve’s belly. The small rippling motion happens once more a moment later. He drags his gaze to his partner’s face.
Steve sends back a thumbs up emoji and settles into the couch cushion to wait for Peter to wake up. When he does, his skin is cooler to the touch, and he doesn't look so miserable. Steve makes him a piece of dry toast and bowl of chicken broth. Peter only manages two bites of toast and half the broth, but Steve counts it as a win and lets the kid fall back asleep.
“We’ll deal with them if they decide to make a fuss,” promises Tony with a shrug. “They’ve known about my relationship with Steve since the beginning, over a year ago, and nobody’s said anything. I don’t see why they would now.”
At least here, he can ignore the tiny, nagging voice in his head that is wondering what Steve is up to, and if he's going to sleep with that woman.
! No, oh god, no, Nat, I-I didn’t mean that I wanted a child with you. I could, would never ask that of you.” He pauses. “You can’t –?”
, he thinks even as he follows instructions. Tony runs his fingers through Steve’s sweat-soaked hair, murmurs praise and encouragement; his hand stays firmly in Steve’s through every push, every cry of pain, though Steve is certain there’s no way it’s not hurting Tony.
Darcy shrugs. “Need to get some cash somehow, right? I mean, working with Jane is great, I don’t have to do a whole lot of much except make sure she doesn’t croak because she doesn’t take care of herself and occasionally scare the asshats in charge of funding into not dismissing her just because she’s a woman, and we all know science is a,” she lowers her voice and puffs out her chest, “man’s world.” With a roll of her eyes, she sighs and continues, “But yeah, it’s great, but I needed a little more cash flow in my life. Aaaand who is this tall drink of water?” she asks, finally dragging her eyes away from Tony to land solely on Steve.
“Can we think about this?” Tony asks, much more quietly than Steve would have expected in such a tense conversation. “Cap and I just need to talk this all over.”
, fast enough after the Chitauri. That’s not even considering the way we were at each other’s throats before that.”
Happy merely nods in response. Tony grins then disappears, Happy's phone screen going dark. Steve turns, shuffling back into his apartment. He feels so foolish now, but he refuses to dwell on it – he just gathers up Peter's backpack and crosses to the couch, drops to his knees to gently lift the child into his arms. Peter startles, whimpering softly, his body twitching, and his eyes open just enough to look up at Steve.
, manages to twist and pull at the right time. He winces when the screen door slams against its frame behind him but ignores the echoing bang as he lets his body collapse until he’s sitting on the edge of the sidewalk.
!” brings his head up. He grins at Peter who’s tugging at the hand of the young woman escorting him down the hall. The child’s book-bag hangs from his thin shoulder by one strap, but it doesn’t seem to be slowing him down. As soon as the pair enter the office, the woman lets go of Peter’s hand, and he rushes toward Steve. Thankfully, Steve opens his arms in time to catch the four-year-old.
Her voice is causal, and the words are certainly innocent enough, but Steve still flushes a deep red. His brain recalls the package without his permission; he’s absurdly grateful that his dick can’t betray him at the moment. He turns away from Natasha, though he is absolutely certain she’s already seen his burning cheeks, and covers the paint pots.
a great man, Tony, and a damn good hero. You’ve done everything you can to make up for the legacy that Howard left you.”
“Surprisingly no. Just… I’m terrified I’ll end up just like Howard, always working, always gone, until one day I open my eyes to find that I’ve missed everything important, everything that really matters, and my kid hates me.”
“Nothing, this was dumb, ignore me. Food will be here soon. See ya down there. In the kitchen. For dinner.”
“Good morning,” says Bucky with a grin, and Tony drags his gaze up from the coffee to stare at the other man in silence for a few seconds.
Tony’s gaze drifts from Clint, finally lands on Steve, and Steve knows without a doubt that his cheeks are a furious shade of red. Phil gently pushes Steve’s feet off his legs, helping the blond to stand, and Steve makes his way to Tony’s side. The heat in his cheeks doesn’t fade, but he kisses Tony through the embarrassment. Steve sighs into the kiss, one that’s been five weeks overdue.
The nighttime air is warm, thick with humidity and the smell of dirt, grass, and oil. A light breeze blows by, bringing with it a touch of coolness. Steve gasps brokenly as he wraps his arms tightly around himself. Crickets chirp in the grass to his right; the noise is muffled by the heavy haze that blankets his mind. Something in him is clawing desperately to get out, to be seen and acknowledged, but he has no idea what it is. Bile creeps its way up his throat. He leans to the side and retches. His throat burns, his stomach heaves again, and he folds himself in half, choking on the air he can’t inhale properly. He manages to dig his phone from his pocket, and his fingers tremble as he turns it upright.
“With all due respect, Mr Parker, no, you really don't. There… There are things coming that no one person can handle, let alone a teenager who makes his webbing in the drawer of a chem lab table.”
“Yeah, is there any way you can schedule a meeting with the principal tomorrow morning for his parents? There's...somethin' they need to discuss with him.”
He sits on the couch in the living room, pencil in hand as his sketchbook rests on his knee. He scratches idly at his chin and stares down at the lines that cover the page. His brain fills in the colouring automatically ー the piercing grey-blue of Bucky’s eyes; the purple of the arrow on his left wrist; the vivid sharp red of Peggy’s lips twisted into a knowing smirk as she gazes up at him over her shoulder where the pale yellow and deep green of the masks peek out from the hem of her blouse, pulled down to expose her soulmark; the electric white-blue of the circle that rests above his heart almost dead-centre of his thin chest.
Steve skims over the menu before ordering a burger. Darcy nods succinctly and makes her way to the kitchen area, her long dark curls bouncing against her shoulders as she swings her hips to and fro with a bit more motion than necessary. Thankfully, their conversation isn’t stilted or awkward this time; Tony talks about Peter and work and Pepper (“This is bad etiquette, isn’t it, to talk about your ex on a first date with your current boyー it’s just a terrible idea, right?” “Tony, I already know about you and Pepper, which is why I know there’s nothing more than friendship and co-parenting, and were you about to call me your boyfriend?” “Don’t be silly, Steven, we’re not in grade school.”), and Steve talked more about the shenanigans of his youth with Bucky, how he stumbled onto being a comic book writer and artist, and his ma. Darcy leaves them alone for most of the date, only swooping in sneakily once or twice to refill their drinks and to whisper encouragement in Steve’s ear whenever Tony isn’t paying particular attention due to being engrossed in whatever he is saying. She sets a bowl of ice cream and two spoons onto the table before taking away their plates, and Tony looks around; Steve turns just in time to see Ben gesturing at them to continue the date.
Peter grins toothily up at him when Steve pulls the door open. “Hi! Today's the cookout, are you excited, because I am, I get to meet your friends and eat lots of food!”
. This feels like nothing Tony has ever had before, not even with Pepper, and he'd thought he'd loved her more than anything or anyone, though he was so wrong. This is everything Tony has never known he wanted, dreams he had never had coming true in the slow slide of their lips.
“N-Natasha’s,” gasps Steve; his back arches, bring Tony’s mouth closer. “She – oh, Hell, Tony – she taught me things, gave me all this for, for you.
“Uh, most likely Nadia, Pepper's niece. She's visiting on break from college, and Pete just loves her. She's good with him.”
>>There are approximately 39 known HYDRA bases within the continental US, an as-of-now unknown number in other countries.
“What? No, no one is. Well, they shouldn’t be, anyway. See, no, there’s Natasha, Bruce, Sam, Clint, Thor… They’re all there.”
doing, I'm really not, I just… I miss you, and you're not here a lot, so I keep missin’ you. I hate that this is all we've got.”
Tony hesitates but crosses the workshop to one of the computer bases. His fingers bring up multiple bright screens, and he moves them around a bit before he lets his hands fall to his sides. Neither man speaks for a long few minutes as Tony sits on one of the stools and drags a gauntlet and soldering iron closer to him. DUM-E, seemingly accepting the sad fact that he is no longer getting any attention from Steve, slowly wheels away with his claw hanging low to the ground.
“You love him, and I love him, and he loves us, and you said you’d only ever want to get married if someone loves me ‘nuff and Steve
“Only a couple months. I figured it out when Coulson gave me files to go over, help me acclimate to what the world has gone through,what the
“What's there to talk about? God, the déjà vu, I swear. Look, Steve, I never should've said something, really, I know this. I know you're with her, and… As much as it hurts, even I can admit you guys are a good-looking couple. I really should have kept this to myself, not made this awkward. I ー”
, Steven, stop trying to pretend you’re not. He likes to pretend he’s so brave and social, but he’s not, he’s skittish.”
It takes almost an hour, but eventually, Peter leaves significantly less panicky, promising that he will tell his aunt soon, the manilla envelope tucked safely in his backpack. Steve sends a text to Tony as he makes his way to the gym.
your home. And I realised… I realised I don’t want you to leave. I actually like having you around. You makeー you make my life easier and, well, better. Not because you help in the workshop, I mean, I like that you do, but that’s not why, and oh god, I’m fucking this up, aren’t I?”
The AI helpfully brings the lights up as Steve heads out of his room. True to JARVIS’s word, the others are in the living room within five minutes. All of them wear expressions that resemble exactly how Steve feels ー except for Natasha, but even she looks slightly shaken. She leans against Sam from their spot on the couch, with Clint resting his head on her lap; Wanda sits on the floor against the couch, her head bowed and Clint's fingers brushing lightly over her hair. Thor stretches out along the other sofa, and Bruce is curled up in an armchair, his hunched form making him look smaller than usual. Only Tony remains standing, after Steve takes a seat on the ottoman. Nobody speaks, but Steve can feel the confusion and fear roiling off of them in waves. Tony catches his eye, jerks his head toward the kitchen. Steve follows.
There’s a long pause during which Steve is worried his ma might be laughing at him. His worries are proven to be completely valid when she finally speaks, stifled giggles evident in her voice.
“Only until you realised all the harm that legacy was causing, then you put a stop to it. Tony, you turned the entire company around with one press conference, no matter how many people bitched and complained or how many points the stock dropped. You did the right thing with SI, and you became Iron Man to save people. If that’s not a hero, then I don’t know what is. You’re a wonderful, caring, intelligent, fiercely loyal man – not to mention, gorgeous – and you’re gonna be a fantastic father. That’s why Sarah is going to have both last names.”
“Well, he's why I'm calling. He was fine then started complaining of his stomach hurting. He threw up during snack time, and he's now running a low-grade fever. I've tried contacting his parents, but neither are answering, and Mister Parker has you listed as an emergency contact. So is there any way you can come pick him up?”
“Wow, someone’s sassy, did you not fuck me hard enough to get your sass out? And stop deflecting. What’s been on your mind lately? Tell me ‘nothing’ one more time, and I’ll smother you, I swear to God.”
Coulson’s expression doesn’t change, but Steve can see the amused glint in his eyes. “I didn’t schedule enough time to remind you of all the ways your sense of self-preservation leaves something to be desired, so unfortunately, Barton, you’ll just have to take my word for it.”
By the time he’s done showering and is dressed in less sweaty – but just as comfortable – clothes, Tony is awake and standing next to Bruce at the stove. He smiles widely at Steve as the blond steps off the elevator on the communal level, and Steve feels himself fall that much deeper in love; the two exchange soft kisses, their lips carrying words that don’t need to spoken aloud to be heard.
Steve’s breath hitches, and he wonders as he stares up at Tony, at his dark eyes hiding so much, how he got such an amazing, giving soulmate. Tony nods succinctly, slips his feet into his shoes, and crosses the room to step inside the waiting Iron Man suit. Steve calls his name just as the armour gets to the door.
It's then that everything goes to Hell. Glass shatters inward, screaming tearing through the thundering booming of the explosion. Steve ducks, fists wrapping in the king's jacket and yanking him down. But he is already falling, without control or grace, and Steve knows, knows without a doubt that this is the start of the chaos from the vision. The king is dead.
Photographs taken, everyone congregates in the reception area set up further down the beach. The next few hours are spent  dancing to a variety of different kinds of music, sipping on a glass of champagne, and keeping an eye on Peter as Tony and Pepper spin around the dancefloor. The sun dips lower to the horizon as time wears on; an occasional flash from the camera dazzles Steve, but he ignores it as much as possible, intent on making sure that Peter isn’t getting hurt or lost. Steve watches Pepper and Tony swaying to the music, talking quietly to each other, and he can see how they could have worked. They seem to be in such complete sync with each other, and even when Tony manages to annoy and frustrate Pepper, she’s yet to leave his side. It doesn’t matter that their romantic relationship failed, they’re still so close and compatible, and their friendship is enviable. As much as Steve loves the way Tony and Pepper raise their child and interact together, he’s selfishly glad they never worked out. He is thankful that he has what he has with Tony and Peter, and even Pepper and Phil. He smiles down at a dozing Peter leaning against his chest, presses a soft kiss to the child’s hair.
The kiss turns heated in seconds, and Steve lets out a low whine when Tony lifts him off his feet. The sheets that are suddenly beneath him are soft, smooth and cool, a complete contrast to how Steve is burning up from the inside out. His head swims with lust and desire; he keeps his arms wrapped around Tony, keeps them pressed together, ignores the hard circle digging into his sternum. This is so much more than what they'd had the night Steve had been drunk in his dreams, more real and just…
Tony gapes at Natasha, mouth opening and closing a few times. Finally, he manages to force out, “In my defence, we were a little preoccupied with the planning and figuring out how the fuck this was even going to happen.”
The car comes to a smooth stop outside the elegant cafe. Within moments, Happy is holding the door open, allowing Pepper to step out; Natasha is next, somehow managing to move gracefully in her form-fitting slacks and three-inch heels. Steve lets Happy to help him out of the car. Ice and snow cover the sidewalk, so Steve is thankful for the assistance, since he feels like his feet could slip out from under him with one wrong move. He follows his friends inside, shedding his coat once in the warmth of the cafe; the staff smiles politely at Pepper, greets Natasha with a “Good morning, Ms Rushman”, and pretend not to be staring at the curve of Steve’s belly. Once the trio is seated and has ordered their drinks, Pepper picks up her menu from off the table, opening it and scanning the options.
“Forgive me, Captain, but Mister Stark has programmed me to keep track of the usage of products within the tower. It has come to my attention that you have yet to open the hygiene products you requested at the end of your last cycle, yet, by my calculations, the latest cycle should have begun on the twenty-second.”
“Oh, shut up, Mal. Ain’t like I was too far behind. I had to make sure I wasn’t followed. Unless you want the goddamn Avengers stormin’ in here before you get that baby.”
Steve is roused from his slump on the sofa late the next afternoon by his front door opening. He turns his gaze away from the television set, and Tony grins as he closes the door behind him. Steve feels his lips move, twist, form into a smile on their own; he opens his arms, letting Tony collapse onto the couch next to him, and pulls the other man close. Neither man speaks for a few minutes. Steve is content enough to bask in the solid warmth that Tony provides.
It’s only two minutes later that Tony joins him, apologising profusely. Steve cuts him off with a kiss, pressing more insistently any time Tony opens his mouth to say sorry again. Finally, Tony gets the hint and rolls his eyes. He laces their fingers together and tugs Steve toward the stairs. The view now is much better ー every time Tony takes a step up, his ass is tantalisingly in Steve’s direct eyeline, and Steve has to fight the urge to touch. His ma raised him better than that, and consent is always the biggest turn-on. So he merely soaks up the sight as they make their way up three more flights of stairs until they come to a stop on their landing. Another kiss is shared, this one a teasing, playful kind of thing, before Tony pulls away and smiles regretfully.
Steve stares around at the family he’s found in this new century, smiling until his cheeks start to hurt and then smiling some more.
Tony glares at Sam. "Shut it, Wilson, or the next time you use your wings, you might find yourself being shipped off to the moon."
“Are you gonna tell Aunt May?” Peter asks quietly after a few minutes; his face is turned toward the envelope on the table, and Steve wonders how long it will take for the teen to get curious enough to open it.
Steve stares down at the sonogram in his hands, blinking against the heat in his eyes. He slides it into an elegant envelope, re-reads the letter.
Steve jerks awake to the sound of the occasional car passing on the street outside, dogs barking down the block, the air conditioning unit rattling in the window; the room is dark save for the bars of orange-yellow that filter through the blinds, and the blanket he usually keeps on the back of the couch for Peter is draped over his curled-up body. He pushes himself to a sitting position, wiping sleep from his eyes, and reaches for his cell phone. The clock reads 03:59, and the notification light blinks up at him. He unlocks the device and opens the message.
The visits slow again, coming only once a week. Tony starts looking wrecked, in pain, and he disappears at the smallest provocation. Steve worries about him, of course he does ー Tony isn't acting like himself, and Steve is walking on eggshells to find and avoid the landmines that threaten their time together. Tony doesn't touch him any more, doesn't sit close enough for the chance.
Bucky shakes his head with a grimace, his lips thinned into a flat line. Steve knows that Bucky cares, but it's not so easy to handle when Steve's already torn up inside. The last time Tony had met up with him in the bleachers of a stadium, the baseball fans and team having already left, he'd been skittish. His face had been pale and drawn tight with ー pain, maybe, Steve doesn't know, Tony refused to talk about it, and he kept making an aborted move toward his chest, hand scrabbling the thin air millimetres away from the front of his shirt before falling to his lap. He'd rejected any touches from Steve, scooting further and further away until finally, he'd got up, said a goodbye that felt far too damn final for Steve's liking, and disappeared, leaving Steve to stare at the space where Tony had been. Now there's nothing but an echoing silence, a painful gap where Tony should be.
As he pads down the hall and into the living room, the lights gradually become brighter, and JARVIS recites the weather forecast and the day’s schedule in hushed tones. Their calendar is relatively clear – one conference call set for later in the day (Tony) and a quick meeting with SHIELD (that Steve is sending Loki to, in his place). Today is going to be full enough without other responsibilities demanding his time or brainpower.
“No, sir. The fabrication units have completed the tasks given to them, and U and Butterfingers are in their charging stations.”
Tony turns an incredulous stare on Steve, jaw dropped, but Steve avoids meeting his eye. He’s well aware of Tony’s feelings about Loki; Hell, he even feels the same. The distrust and hatred towards the trickster god who wreaked so much havoc are valid emotions, and Steve has no doubts that, in any other situation, he would never involve him in any way. But this possible solution is contingent upon Loki’s involvement, the only answer he and Tony have gotten from anyone. He knows he should say ‘no’, but he wants this
“Aw, don’t worry, Mr Parker, he’s all yours. I’ve already got my eye on someone, and she’s not buff and blond.”
“Fine, it’s not a date with your neighbour. Honestly, Steve, just get an angel food cake or something. It’s not a big deal, I promise. Deep breath.”
Somehow, Peter finds out about the cookout and is beyond excited. Steve thinks that maybe Pepper was told by Tony ー they are still close, after all ー and let it slip to their child, and his suspicions are confirmed when she and Happy drop Peter off that Friday. As soon as Tony has his son in the other room, Pepper gives Steve a smile, moves around the kitchen like it’s not unusual for her to rummage around her ex’s apartment. She manages to find a box of tea in the back of a cupboard, sniffing surreptitiously at it before turning it over to check the Best By date; deeming it acceptable, she fills a mug with hot water from the tap and sets a bag in the cup.
Tony stops by Steve’s art studio one evening, fully expecting the pregnant blond to still be there like his text message said. Instead, all Tony finds is an empty room. He examines the latest bit of work on the easel, smiles at the obvious shape of the arc reactor, and asks JARVIS to locate Steve. The AI takes a moment before answering.
Steve lets her words sink in, nodding to show he understands. His hand moves without permission. Natasha smiles as his fingers play with the ends of her hair. She begins talking to his belly again; her hand follows the baby’s movements. Slowly, the tension drains from her shoulders, and Steve is happy to see she’s calmer than before. He isn’t sure why she’s so shaken up – there has been much worse said about her before – but he knows she’ll tell him if she wants to. Until, he will just allow her to continue talking to her unborn niece.
Between the manic gleam in Sam's eye and the only logical conclusion Tony's brain has been able to come up with in the last three minutes, Tony is absolutely sure he doesn't want to hear what Sam isn't saying and that he will absolutely hate it.
Tony and Steve just continued to stare at the door Dean must’ve left through. They both felt a sudden urge to protect Dean and keep him safe, but they didn’t know what hardships Dean was facing. ‘And they would probably never see him again’, they both thought.
Dean thought about why he freaked out and did what he did. He realised that he was angry. At his dad. At the world. At life. And he realised that going to shoot a gun wasn’t going to help in the long run.
His father didn’t bother to speak again before a fist collided with Dean’s right cheek. Dean stumbled but didn’t fall. This seemed to aggravate John because the next punch was harder. Dean fell to the floor, but on his way down, he hit his head on the wall and his vision started to blur. ‘Don’t pass out again,’ he thought to himself as he struggled to stay awake.
His dad started to kick him in the stomach. Dean prayed that he wouldn’t kick his ribs, because he probably wouldn’t survive that again.
“Let’s just double check JARVIS has everything documented and then I vote for a shower and a weeks worth of sleep.” Tony suggested as he wearily rubbed a hand over his face. He could feel a layer of grit and dirt on his face that he’d like to get rid of sometime soon.
“The Captain did enter briefly to bring you lunch but had to leave fairly quickly.” The AI answered not knowing how much more he should say.
Realising he couldn’t actually hold his mug any tighter for fear of breaking it, Steve guessed he couldn’t keep stalling any longer. He looked Natasha in the eyes and said
“I’m not sure how you know Natasha, and I don’t know if I want to find out but yes, I am in love with Tony.”
Hearing Natasha talk through everything she had observed was like a light bulb going off in Steve’s head. Years ago he had begun noticing these acts of kindness and love from Tony, but they’d been brushed off so often that Steve had stopped paying attention. If what Natasha was saying was true, there might be a chance for them. A chance Steve had stopped hoping for around mistaken love interest number three.
Not many people knew about Tony’s Aunt Margaret. Those that did knew that she’d been one of little Tony’s constants, a planet he could orbit around whenever she was in reach and whose approval and love were things that motivated little Tony in ways his parents could never quite understand. Between her and the original Jarvis, Tony had his compass points by which he could navigate the world.
At the edge of the door way into Tony’s workshop, Steve stilled as he heard Tony on the phone with someone. The voice sounded vaguely familiar but Tony had been known to have JARVIS pipe conversations out of the speakers in all parts of the tower if his hands were full so it wasn’t that surprising. What he was surprised about was the amount of emotion in Tony’s voice as he answered, this was obviously someone he cared about a great deal. Feeling more and more like an unwanted voyeur of such an unguarded moment, Steve quietly stepped away and considered if this was the final piece he had been waiting for. Straight after a battle when the team would normally be together, taking solace in each other and reaffirming their bond and Tony was on the phone with someone. Maybe Steve should finally take a hint that he and Tony weren’t meant to be together.
He knew that Thor would occasionally disappear and the first people would know about it would be that someone has taken a picture of the large Asgardian trying to squeeze into a tube seat or helping people carry their shopping, or a thousand other little things that helped make the world a better place but that weren’t particularly difficult for someone with godlike powers to accomplish.
Bruce and Tony’s science bro relationship was something that none of the other Avengers really understood but they could all recognise how special it was. Bruce tempered some of Tony’s more impulsive behaviours, and Tony helped bring Bruce out of his shell and flattered his big science brain. The two of them together were a formidable force, those not well equipped could find themselves lost in techno science babble in under five minutes, but they achieved great results.
Just then her phone let out a quiet text alert, and a quick glimpse let her know that there might be someone who could shed a little bit of light on what she’d just been given a glimpse of.
It was on one of his Tony sustenance trips that Steve felt his stomach sink. The door to the workshop opened as usual but he couldn’t see Tony anywhere. About to leave the food on the table and head back upstairs for lunch - Steve heard something. Setting the plate down, Steve stood still trying to work out what he was hearing and where it was coming from.
Steve could wax lyrical about everything he’d learnt about Tony and it would still take a few days to get through. There was so much about the man that just continued to make Steve want to get to know him more. So many facets to his personality that Steve found himself falling more and more in love with as time went on. He knew that it was getting a bit ridiculous. He had sort of been invested from the moment he’d met the man on the helicarrier before everything seemed to go so very wrong, but it had got stronger the more he got to know the man.
The team had lost count of the number of times they had seen the two finish each other's sentences, firing on the same wavelength in ways that made them look like the same person in two separate bodies. Whatever energy that was powering their breakthroughs was amplified as they bounced back and forth off each other’s intellect and ideas. Even with Bruce’s calming tendencies, it wasn’t unknown for the two to go on a 72 hour science binge with only coffee and Bruce’s favourite snack to keep them going.
“The results of the experiment have been documented, Sir” JARVIS’s voice interrupting Bruce’s nodding head and jolting him awake with a start that caused him to flush ever so slightly green around the edges.
“I can’t wait to tell people” Tony mumbled sleepily, eyes blinking rapidly as the heavy weight of too manys hours awake finally begun to take their toll. “You’re the best science bro a man could need Brucey-bear” he said whilst clumsily pawing at Bruce’s shoulder with one hand.
Bruce looked like he was an enigma wrapped in a mystery but really he was a man of very simple needs. Something that had obviously become a necessity as he spent years of his life moving and trying to stay under the radar. Give Bruce his favourite tea, the time to brew it slowly in his favourite teapot, and a skyline and he was happy. The added bonus was time in his lab and a chance to get away and have solitude if he needed it - especially as that was respected by all his teammates. Space to be himself and to not have to worry about Hulk was the key to Bruce’s happiness.
Steve figured it was only a matter of time before they announced what seemed completely obvious to him. Tony and Bruce were obviously in a relationship. The way they worked together and moved around each other could only mean one thing. Once again he’d missed out on a chance to ask Tony out.
The first strains of Peggy’s voice were enough to make Tony’s breath hitch but he was steady enough to respond when she spoke.
Seeing that her work was basically done here, Natasha climbed off the sofa and quickly left the room neither of the other occupants taking any notice of her as they sat close together on the sofa and gazed softly at each other.
“He’s just such a wonderful person Nat, how couldn’t someone already have snapped him up? I want him to be happy. Even on the days when it’s so obvious that he hasn’t eaten or slept for 36 hours, has worked himself into the ground, done upgrades for everyone, talked through things with Pepper, played with the bots, and had time to make it to movie night - he’s still one of the most stunning people I have ever seen. Why wouldn’t someone already be loving him?”
All this time spent with the Avengers, and the people who cared about and worked with them, was teaching Steve a lot. Not just cultural and social references, but about his teammates and people in general.
It took Steve a minute to recover from his tea going down the wrong tube, even super soldiers coughed if they breathed in tea instead of swallowing it. He lent back against the sofa arm and clasped his mug tighter between his hands.
Before Tony could move or say anything, Steve had muttered something and turned around to head for the stairs. Finally finding some strength to push himself up, Tony forced his head away from Bruce’s and looked up at the ceiling (an unfortunate habit he’d picked up from Steve) and pulled a quizzical face.
Tony recognised Bruce’s unusual vulnerability and pulled him into a hug as the lift moved between the floors. Just before the door opened, Tony went to try and straighten up to see if he could hold himself up under his own steam… The speed at which he tipped forward wouldn’t have normally been an issue but with both Tony and Bruce feeling decidedly sluggish it was a moment or two before they both realised one of two things. First, Tony had somehow managed to stop himself toppling over by just pushing his head into whatever part of Bruce was in front of him, and secondly that the lift doors had opened showing a slightly shocked, slightly disappointed looking Steve staring at them.
This year was to be no different but at the last minute a call to assemble came in and Tony’s plans to grieve quietly and alone had to be pushed aside for a while. The battle wasn’t too hard but it took longer than Tony would have liked, the call had come about 3pm and after some travel time, a villain that liked to talk way too much, and way way too many tiny creature-bots to round up it was gone 11pm by the time Tony was back and able to get out of the suit. With scant minutes of Peggy’s anniversary remaining Tony got JARVIS to pull up the first of PEggy’s recordings as he finished getting out of his suit and into a soft space to try and give some attention to this important moment.
Back in the workshop, Tony wandered out from the kitchen still singing the praises of this mystery person. Stopping short when he says the plate of food but no super soldier masquerading as a mother hen, Tony tips his head to the side -
Sitting bolt upright, he reached out a hand towards the woman opposite him. “He doesn’t know, does he?!” Steve half shouted, the very idea that Tony had known making him feel sick with worry. He couldn’t lose his friendship with Tony just because of a little thing like love.
Leaving Tony propped in the lift, Bruce walked as quickly as he could to raid the common room kitchen for his tea before getting back in the lift and heading to make showera nd sleep plans into reality.
Natasha let Steve sit quietly, watching him work through what she’d just said. Despite some people’s thoughts that Captain America could be reckless and would act first and ask questions later, she’d found that Steve Rogers was much more likely to think things over before making a decision. Seeing that process happen right in front of her, when it wasn’t a battlefield situation, was an eye opening and interesting experience for the spy. Eventually, after what had felt like hours but in reality had only been a couple of minutes, Steve looked up, wrinkled his brow and asked, “How could you know that? You rarely say anything without some kind of proof so you’ve got to feel pretty sure. How… how do you know?”
Tony shrugged, “Oh well, I’ll make sure to tell him thanks when I see him later. In the meantime can we get back to finalising this most recent breakthrough oh love of my life?”
Natasha liked to spend time reading, it was something that she could do for pleasure, that was entirely her own and that didn’t need to have anything to do with her past or her future or anything else. Just a chance to sit and find herself whisked away to other places or times, with characters that lived short but happily lives in her imagination.
Natasha can’t quite remember the first time she noticed that Steve had a thing for Tony. If she was honest there was some UST from the moment they first met but at that time there were bigger things to worry about and it was filed away for her to think about at another time.
I mean, he shouldn’t be surprised. There’s no way that he could keep up with the Genius part of what made Tony Tony. It was perfectly natural that someone who could keep up with his mind would be infinitely more attractive to Tony than anything Steve could hope to offer him. Still, until something happened that proved it conclusively - Steve was trying not to jump to conclusions. He’d done it twice before, once with Rhodey and then again with thinking that Tony’s declarations of love were for his new and mysterious partner rather than for his beloved AI. Something that he’d soon realised after he found his way into the workshop one too many times when Tony was high on a breakthrough and just spouting sonnets at JARVIS… who would have blushed if it was possible!
Natasha was ready and prepared to do anything she could to get these two soft goofballs to talk about their feelings together. Even if that meant sitting on Steve and calling Pepper to keep Tony from locking himself into his lab.
It was from there that Natasha started gathering more data. Steve was rarely obvious about his feelings but as time went on there were a number of moments that stood out. Apart from the time with Rhodey, she had noticed that Steve would stop wistfully looking at Tony (and even give him more space than usual) every time he thought he’d found out about Tony being in a relationship. There was the time in the workshop with JARVIS, the time in the lift with Bruce, the time on the sofa with Pepper, and most recently the time in the workshop with Peggy. Each time Steve’s emotional response got stronger and his determination to pull himself away from Tony got stronger. It obviously hadn’t really worked, they were teammates but also good friends and that wasn’t something you could just turn off. That said, the completely resigned face that Steve had pulled on the anniversary of Peggy’s death had made Natasha consider that she might have to do something. Especially in light of what Tony had admitted.
“Ok, thanks JARVIS. Let’s see if we can get to the lift and stop by the common room on route to the showers. I’ve run out of my tea in my kitchen and I might not feel like trekking all the way down when I wake up.” Bruce gathered Tony’s noddle like body and prodded him lightly to get his accent before slowly shuffling them in the direction of the helpfully opened doors.
Pepper looked up from stroking Tony’s hair when she noticed another presence in the room. Confident that JARVIS would have alerted her if it had been anyone harmful she relaxed and was about to call out a soft greeting when she spotted the changing looks on Steve’s face as he took in the position she and Tony were in and then added in the context from the news. The expression of relief that she saw just before he turned away was unexpected and made her wonder the reason behind it.
Whereas Tony had been coming up with ways to make Steve’s life easier for years now, even going so far as to finding old recipe books so he could recreate some of Steve’s childhood favourites, and then making sure that the common rooms were never too cold or that a blanket or two was always in reach of the soldier incase he started to feel a chill. Steve had barely noticed, mostly because Tony had shrugged off the thanks so many times, diverted attention away from the things he had done to make Steve happy and bring a smile to his face.
That Tony felt comfortable to gabble away at this ‘Rhodey’ as they stood wrapped around each other in the entrance to the common room kitchen was one thing. That it was obviously behaviour the man was used to could only be another point on the scorecard for romantic love interest. It hurt Steve a little, partly that he didn’t know about Rhodey but also that tony was never that physically affectinate with him. Now he knew why. But, he was on his best behaviour when he was introduced, wanting Tony to be pleased to introduce his partner and not worried about what others would think.
Dean pulled out his cheeky smile and replied, “Steve and Tony said it was okay as long as I don’t go to hard.”
Tony had stopped and turned at the sound of Dean’s footsteps. He watched as the teenager walked into the room and hesitated in front of the husbands.
They opened a door and saw the teenager, huddled into the corner of his room, tears streaming down his face.
Dean had decided to stay in his room, he was sat at the desk and had taken his hoodie off, as it had started to agitate his injuries.
Bucky seemed to be forcing his anger into a slew of curses directed at John Winchester while Thor had the same sad look in his eyes as Bruce, as he quietly mumbled to himself.
Dean decided to take a shower, even though he thought it would hurt his back, he felt like he needed one anyway.
Dean woke up to the steady beeping of a heart monitor and started to panic. If he was in a hospital that would mean someone’s probably suspicious and they would move again. He heard the steady beep become faster and faster. He shot up and jumped off of the bed, ignoring the way pain flared in his chest.
“Well, I know you didn’t ask for this, but I put his face through facial recognition to see if I could locate him,” The AI began once more.
When Dean tried to move a little to get a better view of everyone in the room, he accidently moved his back and white-hot pain shot through his entire body.
Dean kept punching and punching, ignoring the steadily growing pain in his back and his father’s voice in his head, in favour of letting out his anger.
The AI took a moment before carrying on with her explanation. “It is said in the file that the social workers left and came back the following day to try and extricate the boys, but when they showed up at the motel, it was empty, with a small splatter of blood across the carpet.” The AI finished with sympathy in her voice.
Thinking back to the scars and bruises littering the young boys skin left the team feeling the need to throw up.
John had actually been away for the past two weeks; he had finished up the local hunt and taken one a little further. So, Dean had had an alright two weeks.
The bullets all landed in a tight circle, with barely a few millimetres between each one. Dean shot the gun until his clip was empty and lowered his arms.
He was kneeling for about 10 minutes, throwing up on and off. He could feel sweat falling down his face and back, and he could also feel the body paint from last night still stuck to his body. That’s when everything that happened last night came back to him.
His vision started to blur around the edges as he continued to try and suck in air. He failed again. ‘No, no, no, no, I can’t leave Sammy.’ Were his final thoughts before he blacked out completely and fell to the ground.
He heard a series of affirmations on the other end and made his way towards Dean, who he noted was trying to get away.
He saw the team and Sam sitting around the long dining table, with copious amounts of basically every breakfast food you could think of. There were stacks of pancakes, plates of French toast, eggs, bacon, toast, various fruits and cereal. Dean had never seen this much food in his life and judging by the happy and excited look in Sam’s eyes, he was excited to dig into the food as well.
Steve was just reaching the end of his workout when F.R.I.D.A.Y sounded an alert and was calling across the tower that there was a disturbance just outside the tower.
‘Great, I can smell the scotch from here,’ Dean thought to himself. Dean tried to make his way upstairs but was stopped by his father yelling, “Dean! Get in here now!” Dean took a deep breath and made his way to the living room.
Dean turned to look at the super soldier sat next to him. “I freaked out and ran. Then got drunk, took a random pill and did a random girl,” he stated blandly. Tony’s lips tightened and he looked away from Dean.
“Listen lady, I don’t even know you. I don’t owe you or anyone else an explanation,” He said with a glower.
“I didn’t think it was a big deal, sorry. Besides, why aren’t you focusing on the fact that I woke up in avengers tower and they saw the scars, we’ll probably have to move again?” Dean shuddered at that and panic laced his words.
About forty minutes later, they left the bathroom, dopey smiles on their faces, hair messy and clothes skewed.
“It seems that Dean is having a panic attack after a nightmare, I thought you could help,” The AI replied.
Steve saw Dean’s face move down to his bare torso and panic flicker on his features. He also saw that it was gone as fast as it came, and a wall was built around him.
“I know it’s not a lot, but I wanted to get out the house without Dad waking up,” Dean stated coolly.
He turned to leave and on his way to the door, saw a picture frame on his desk of him, his mother and Sammy. He looked at it for a while and picked it up, removing the back and taking the photo out.
Sam was about to respond but he felt himself being led back to the tower by Thor’s strong grip, so he just let out a frustrated sigh.
Dean was still out of it when the elevator dinged and the group stepped out, Steve still pulling Dean along.
Bruce turned around with a sad smile, “We’re going to give you some more pain killers and you’re going to sleep for a while.”
“I know, but if you go in there and grab him, he’ll just freak out more,” Sam reasoned, “You haven’t dealt with this before.”
Dean walked over to the backpack he brought from home and pulled out his gun. Just the weight in his hand made him feel better. Hunting was one of the only things that made him feel useful, so the feel of the gun in his hand just felt right.
He was looking down at the new laptop he had found sitting on his desk. ‘Is this actually happening?’ he asked himself, ‘I mean come on, living with the avengers?’ He smiled slightly.
He started to walk away, but before he could make it far, Steve was overtaking him and stopping in front him, halting his escape.
Dean smiled awkwardly and put his gun back into his waistband. He started to head back to his car, but someone flew up behind him. Dean turned and saw iron man floating slightly just behind him. Before Dean had a chance to back away and just get to his car, Captain America was stood by Dean’s side, looking at him shocked.
Dean made his way downstairs to see Sam sat at the kitchen table, reading his biology textbook. He also noted that his father was passed out on the couch.
“T'Challa says he might know of a way to help Barnes,” he announces on a quiet voice. “We'll talk more about it once we're back at the tower.”
opened your doors for me. Clint had been compromised, and you went out of your way to give him a safe space so he could get his bearings in peace. Natasha went undercover in your company, got close to spy on you for SHIELD, but you didn’t hold it against her, just told her to get her ‘shapely ass’ unpacked then meet you in the gym so she could whip you into fighting shape.
“Were you going to tell me?” Tony's gaze is sharp, pinning Steve to his place, and Steve has to nod, he can't speak. “When?”
A storm rages outside of the large windows; only the occasional flicker of lightning illuminates the room, and Steve tries desperately to calm himself, to get back a semblance of control over the howling that's inside of him. But Tony's arms are warm and comforting, and the way he keeps whispering softly words that Steve can't hear over the thunder or his aching heart, brings all of Steve's emotions to the front, and he can't keep fighting them down. It’s too draining, exhausting, to not allow himself to feel something,
Steve hitches the towel tighter around him, makes sure it’s covering him even as Tony’s gaze rakes over his exposed skin. Steve rolls his eyes at Tony's leer, turns on his heel, and goes back to his room. After hurriedly dressing in a pair of cotton sleep-pants and a threadbare t-shirt, he rejoins Tony in the kitchen. The other man has made himself at home on the living room floor, scrolling through Steve's Netflix queue on the battered laptop that sits on the television stand.
Tony shakes his head before giving in to the insistent hands pushing him toward a sofa. He sits, glares at Natasha who shrugs and disappears through the people gathered. Pepper joins him within minutes; she has two plates in hand, passing one over to him.
And now it's been four days, and there's a fidgeting, nervous-looking teenager sitting in one of the chairs in the conference room. Steve watches the kid spin from side to side in the chair, foot tapping against the floor. Tony breezes past where Steve stands in the doorway and tosses a manilla envelope onto the table so that it slides across the surface to stop in front of the kid.
Peter manages to eat three and a half hot dogs, two handfuls of potato chips, and one-third of a large slice of cake before he starts looking a little nauseous. Steve takes the plate away from the child, handing him his cup of Sprite, and finishes off the chocolate dessert as Peter stares petulantly. Tony keeps his focus on Sam as they talk, even as Tony reaches for Steve's fork and steals the last bite of cake. The action causes Peter to giggle; he climbs out of the chair and rounds the table, clambers up onto Steve's lap. His eyes are dropping as he leans into Steve, and Steve runs his fingers through dark, sweat-damp curls, gently untangling the knots that have formed after hours of running around. It's almost anticlimactic the way Peter falls asleep with his cheek pressed against Steve's chest, mouth dropped open slightly. His soft snores catch his father's attention, and Tony stops speaking mid-sentence. Steve waves Tony's concern off, murmuring a quick assurance that he can handle this. And he can, and he does, but he's still thankful when Tony starts saying goodbye after another twenty minutes. Steve passes Peter off to Tony and stands, heading for the bathroom. Once he's done his business and washed his hands, he finds Tony standing by the door. The expression on his face as he rests his cheek on Peter's hair, eyes closed and his face relaxed, makes Steve's heart clench in his chest. He realises he's in far too deep to ever consider backing out now. Snapping a quick photo with his phone, he comes to a stop at Tony's side and lays a hand against Tony's lower back.
He races out of the labs, up the stairs, past the living area, and into his room. It’s kinda his safe haven.
Step two- find a place to lay low while the heat dies down. Can’t have SHIELD catching him- or the Avengers, for that matter.
Natasha rolls her eyes. “Lets at least find out what secret he’s keeping. Stark, with me. We have hacking to do.”
against lifting the hammer, but he doesn't care at this point. He has tripped over this hammer so much, its absolutely
Peter sighs, and puts his head in his hands. “Brock... why would you do this?” He asks aloud, not directing the question to anyone. There’s no one to ask.
Tony looks down. "Steve... he tried to repair all the damage that happened when he stopped the truck. He... according to Clint, he... he might be feeling guilty. Like he can't be a hero."
"Guys, can I just say, that Fury is yelling at me and telling me that he, quote, 'wants Spider-Man working for me by the end of the day, Barton!'." Clint informs the two red-and blue heroes.
Clint walks into the room, holding a broken bow and covered in decaying black webs. "Not a word." He warns Tony.
“All I was saying was that Fury might decide to shoot some nukes or-” Tony shuts up when he gets a look, and out of the corner of my eye, Natasha spots Peter seeming to melt into his father’s embrace.
He swings above the city, grinning as the chill wind cuts through his suit, the air whooshes by, the G-force kicks in, and the thrill settles in his gut.
"Remember what happened when you told your secret identity?" Clint asks, taking the captains side. "Oh, yeah! Someone blew your house up!"
"Sure!" Peter grins, jumping to his feet- and then the ceiling. "Race ya!" He calls, rushing out the door.
hiding something... but what could be so big that he'd have start noticing every single detail so that no one would follow him and find it?
Natasha puts a hand on his shoulder. Steve pushes her aside. Bruce walks up to him, an expression of sympathy and pain on his. "Steve... I'm sorry. I don't- I can't- Peter-" He stops. "I'll be in the lab."
"Well, get your head in the game. Its after Spidey." She snaps, hoping to jolt him into action. Nothing gets a parent more angry and ready to fight than realizing their child is in danger.
“Fuck you.” He says the words without even thinking, he didn’t even realize what he said until after.
The two heroes have been working non-stop on finding Peter. They've widened the area to look for Spider-Man sightings, too. But so far, they haven't seen a glimpse.
Tony smiles. "The dark brooding guy in a devil costume? Yeah, no thanks. I have a feeling he'd blow up the tower to get back at me."
Peter chuckles. "Got it." He starts to pull off his shirt, revealing the costume underneath. "Lets get this show on the road.
Clint holds up his hand. “Wait... is this the same Brock that you saved from being beat up earlier?”
Peter is a couple blocks away from the tower. He's in an alley. He changes into his suit, and he looks at what he can see of the tower. “Sorry, Pops. I know you didn’t want me to do this. But I don’t have any choice.” Peter sighs. “Because if there’s one thing I won’t do, its let my family suffer on my behalf.”
Peter smiles, and nods. "Welp, I've gotta go. Try to be nicer, okay?" He then swings up next to Clint, a smile on my face. One that isn't forced. Its been a while.
Its actually pretty obvious. Natasha drags Clint from the Spider-Man argument to tell him. She takes him to an air vent, where they can talk in private.
Fury ignores him. "I gave you all orders to bring Spider-Man in on sight, not to team up with him!" Fury snaps. "What the hell was that?"
Tony gawks at him. "Peter Benjamin Stark! Having increased metabolism means you actually need to eat more to equal the same amount as an average human, and that's not even factoring in all the exercising you do!" He exclaims.
Clint storms into the building, a look of outrage on his face. He walks right up to Steve. "Wheres Nat?" He growls.
keep looking over his shoulder every once in w while. After a few more minutes of this, he grabs his phone, and dials a number.
He blasts a web at a robber that he must've just stopped, but as he'd about to swing away in his typical fashion, the camera person runs up to him. "Spider-Man! Do you have a message for the public?"
Thor is in shock. Clint dropped his controller, and is just staring where Peter was a moment before. Steve is gawking at the hammer. Tony is pretty sure that Natasha is the only calm person in the room.
There's a flood of people behind him, but the watch beeps at him. "Flash Thompson recognized." It beeps.
Peter blushes, looking away. "Erm, well, from my calculations, I should be eating about three times the amount that I eat now." He confesses. "I just didn't want to tip off that I was... you know..."
Steve takes a breath. Natasha can tell he’s about to say something, but Peter speaks first. “Um... hate to ruin the moment... but what does Маленький паук mean?"
"Yay?" Peter asks. "But, guys, I can't just eat three times the amount I do now. Thats just... I dunno. Weird?"
And that's not even factoring in the chances that he'd get radiation poisoning, or turn into a hulk-like creature.
"Oh." Peter breathes a sigh of relief. "That's good. I thought it was gonna be a super villain, or something." He laughs. "Wow. Stupid of me, huh?"
Peter stares at his old friend, the guy he's known for what feels like a lifetime, the guy who taught Peter how to survive high-school and J.J.J, the guy who was once Peter's closest friend.
"One drink?" Tony begs. "Steve, please. I... I need this. I need to get all of this out of my head, I need to get rid of it."
Natasha smiles, something she doesn't do too often. “Hey, Маленький паук. If Fury comes after you, tell him to shut up, and call us. We’ll sort him out.”
Natasha makes it to the labs first. It'll take Steve and the others a minute to realize that something's wrong. Clint will be down in a few seconds.
“Yet, at the same time, more would die if I stopped. With great power, there must also come great responsibility. But, its not like I could just
Tony even got distracted while lying, and keeping up the lie. That's got to be a sign of something, right?
An idea sparks in Tony's mind. "Someone should stay behind and protect Peter." He decides. "Be it from Fury or Venom."
"To summarize, yay, you're an ultra-good person, cause you can lift the hammer. Yay!" Clint explains.
So, the suits clean, and so am Peter. Mostly. But now, he has nothing to do to distract himself from his thoughts.
His eyes flutter open. "Tell Clint I'm gonna keep bringing that up." Then, he drifts into unconsciousness.
"I'm under the impression that the Avengers teamed up with Spider-Man to take out the multi-verse dinosaur, am I correct?" Fury asks rhetorically.
Peter and Steve are alone in the living room. “I don’t want to tell him my secret identity, and he would make me if I join SHIELD, but it’s not like I can quit being Spider-Man... although maybe I should...” Peter trails off.
Clint nods. "Yeah. Makes sense. I'm gonna head back now, tell Steve that he should quit stressing. Talk to you later?" The archer offers.
Steve left the lab a minute or two ago, a little while after Peter went in. Clint walks up to him. "Peter's had a good day today. I think he's planning to remain Spider-Man." He informs the patriot. After all, Clint's pretty sure its true.
How is he doing that? How can he hide his emotions that well?Wait, back to the problem at hand. What does Clint tell him? That it was a training exercise? That'd go over well!
Peter takes a breath. Clint notices that he's uneasy. "We can always go with Natasha's plan." He offers.
As he's saying the last part, Clint walks back into the room. "My thoughts exactly." He takes a sip of coffee. He probably stole someone elses, as there's no way he could make it that fast.
"Not anymore, your not. Now, you're going to be doing my homework for me, isn't that right?" Flash snarls.
phone rings. He switches it to vibrate, and ducks even farther out of Peter's range of sight, answering it. "Hello?" He asks.
He jumps to his feet, destroying his fort. He attempts to shake the slime off, but it holds firm. “This isn’t good, this isn’t good at all.” Peter frets, starting to panic.
Natasha expertly flips into the air, landing a few meters away with grace. Her attack gives Tony enough time to get to his feet at fire a few blasts at the alien with his repulsors.
important to me. He... he helped my develop temporary cures. They wouldn't last for very long, and I could only do it once a day, but... Peter was a life-saver. He... made me talk to the other guy. He helped me with him. I just... I don't know."
Natasha sighs. "Bruce, we'll find him. Trust me." She assures, forcing a confidence she doesn't feel.
His Spider-sense tingles. Someone is watching him... but they don't have any intention of hurting him. Peter looks up. "Hey."
Steve smiles a small smile. Maybe no laser grids, after all. Heck, Clint might've done a better job than him at cheering Peter up. Clint grins, and gives him a thumbs up. Suddenly, he falls out of the air vent. "Nat!" He yells.
“What if you kept being Spider-Man... but didn’t work for SHIELD? I mean, its not like Fury could send
"Convince him to stand up to a bully... as Spider-Man. He saved a friend of his from being hurt by this guy. And... he asked the guy to be nice, and the guy agreed. I think Peter is starting to realize the effect he has on people." Clint smiles. "How important he is."
"Of course, sir." Jarvis replies. But a moment passes, and instead of getting the schematics, Jarvis says, "Sir, there is a winged man calling himself 'Vulture' attacking Queens."
Banner is in the labs, and Nat is training. Pops went out for a jog, and so, now, its just Clint, Dad, and Peter.
Tony storms into the room, and sits on the couch, clearly angry. He turns on the TV. "Look at this!" He demands.
Peter is sitting back in the warehouse. Hopefully, from the difficult and obscure false leads he set, he's thrown Clint off his trail.
Peter raises his hand against his will. Venom is in control, and there's nothing Peter can do to warn his family.
. He misses chemistry with Uncle Ben, cooking with Aunt May, studying with Gwen. He misses being the shy nerdy kid who couldn’t throw a punch to save his life.
He starts to trudge to bed. "G'night." He mumbles under his breath, not really caring that Clint won't be able to hear him.
"A device to help charge my arc reactor." Suddenly, Tony realizes what Peter gave them. "He made us stuff that we use daily to defend ourselves and save lives, and he made it better. He's trying to protect us."
Venom/Peter gives Clint the lopsided grin that Peter always gives when he's about to do something he shouldn't.
Probably. But, kinda a little late... especially since his Dad thinks Spider-Man is an idiotic amateur who’s going to get himself killed.
The symbiote shrieks, and another voice does too. Male. Teenage. That's all Natasha can pick out. She's never heard it before.
He misses Dr. Banner. He misses working with him in the lab, discovering new things and developing cures for the hulk.
Clint and Tony walk in. Tony is crying, and Clint is supporting him. "It's okay. Hey, its okay. He's okay." Clint tells him.
"This suit. Its just like my old one, but he hid a bunch of high-tech stuff in it. He had Natasha steal my suit in order to do it, too." Steve chuckles. "What about you?"
With his speed, he quickly knocks his legs out from under Clint. Then, before the archer can move, Peter grabs his bow and breaks the string.
If possible, Dad's grin gets even wider."Nope! Wish I did, though. The kids a genius. I mean, his web-shooter designs are amazing, let me tell you. See, he-"
your fault. Stop blaming yourself." He orders. Then, he adds something that might... might do something. "Not everything is about you."
Clint looks around, for any sign of where he might be. But if he's still here, he's as good as gone.
"Does a pack of crazy fan girl's count?" Peter laughs. "There are fanboy's, too. The funniest thing is, the guy who bullies me is the president of the Fan Club."
He sits down, pulling his mask off, and looking down at it. Its stained filthy with soot and grime from stopping the truck. His gloves are almost black with the stuff, and Peter can't help but think back to Venom.
Dad walks into the room, a grin on his face. "Peter, I see you chose to piss Fury off. I must be rubbing off on you." He chuckles.
"Hey, give this to Fury, will you? Oh, and video his reaction." Peter asks Clint, yawning. "I'mma get some sleep." His eyes are heavy, and he yawns again.
Peter misses Thor. He misses his booming voice, and how he’s always shoving his face full of Pop-tarts.
? Why didn't the bite kill him? Why did he not only survive, but end up with superpowers? Why did he become a superhero? Why does this responsibility of protecting and saving lives fall to him? Why?
"Erm... Fury came back, and he yelled at Clint and Nat. Fury is technically your guy's boss, and I didn't want him to break the Avengers apart. He also seemed to be causing a lot of problems for you guys, and I didn't even know what he wanted with me. I... I didn't want you guys to suffer because I'm paranoid." Peter explains quietly. "Now I know what he wants. I get it now. I... I won't do this again. I'm sorry."
"A couple black eyes, a bunch of bruises, um, I think I got a mild concussion once... " Peter trails off. "Just don't tell Dad and Pops, okay? They'd get so mad, and they might actually kill him..."
Spidey stands in the middle of the road, trying with all his might to stop a runaway eighteen-wheeler from crashing into a school.
"Peter, I want you to stay here. The symbiote is after you, so you should stay in the tower." Steve decides.
Peter hesitates. "I mean, why'd a villain go after me? All they'd do is annoy the Avengers, and that's not exactly a good insurance plan." Peter explains quickly. Too quickly.
Tony obediently follows Natasha, all while Steve is stuttering. “But... he... what? We should tell him! Guys, he has a right to know!”
Clint grabs an arrow, and knocks it. "Fire, explosives, or sonics!" She calls to him, jumping into the air and sending a jolt of electricity from her cuffs at Venom.
As soon as it does, a jock-looking blond kid rushes out the door. He has a smirk on his face, and looks like the type of kid who'd play foot ball.
Flash looks up at him. Peter knows from school that he's literally the president of his fan-club, but he's never met Spider-Man. Not in costume, anyway.
"Heh. Yeah. Having a mental breakdown and questioning why I'm even alive and why my life sucks so much will do that to you." But Peter has to agree with Clint though... he's been a bit of an ass.
They're everywhere. Holding the truck back, keeping buildings together, protecting the school, fixing pieces of the road.
Natasha enters the room silently from behind Venom. She makes eye contact with Clint, then sends a shock from her cuff’s at Venom.
Natasha follows Clint into the next room. Clint speaks before she can. "Did you know that Peter was being bullied? I tried talking to the guy, and he's a total dick!" Clint exclaims.
are playing Galaga. Well, minus Bruce. He’s in the lab. Maybe he doesn't like Galaga. Or maybe he just doesn’t like whatever the inside joke is.
Oh, yeah, apparently its some kind of inside joke. Something about a SHIELD agent playing it on duty when there was a threat of alien invasion?
Spider-Man/Peter took the monster down in minutes. Apparently there was some kind of fracture in time in another multiverse, and it bled into ours. Tony did
His enhanced strength makes it difficult to break his grip. But Clint twists his arm so that Peter can't keep ahold of him without breaking his own wrist.
Its onto his shoulder now. Agh! What the heck should Peter do?!? He doesn't want to be possessed and watch his body be controlled by an alien who wants to take over the planet!
Suddenly, Venom reaches out, seemingly against his will. There's a pause, a moment of silence. Then, Thor's hammer flies into his hand. Venom howls in pain. He slowly turns back into mush, and drips off of Peter.
"You'll what?" Peter asks. They don't have anything to threaten him with. He's making his mask stick to his face- its not like they can take it off. And they don't know who is family is, so they can't blackmail him that way.
Peter nods, and grab onto the archer. "Lets go." He starts to swing off, a cursing and terrified Clint clinging to Peter like he'll fall at any moment.
Tony chuckles weakly. "Have I been insulting him to much? Look, Pete, I'm sorry. I just don't want the guy to get hurt from his lack of experience. Also, he's giving hero's a bad rep."
Venom seems to realize what she's about to do right before she does it, seeing as he darts to the side, and tries to kick my feet out from under me.
Peters hand feels cold. He grabs a blanket, and build a mini-fort out of it, and a few spare pillows.
Peter smiles. "No problem. I had to get Natasha to steal your suit for a while to make the replica... so, sorry about that." Peter apologizes.
Apparently so. Steve drags him to the couch. Stupid super-soldiers. He makes the billionaire sit down. "Tony, you can't drown your problems in alcohol."
Steve looks at the new suit, then at Peter. As much as it pains him to take Peter into the field, he doesn't have a choice. Peter isn't just Steve's son, he's a superhero. "Suit up." Steve orders him, grabbing the new suit. "Meet me in the labs."
Peter is starting to wonder how often he's done this sort of thing. Weaving complex and elaborate lies.
Clint stops. "Tony doesn't think your useless, Pete. He was getting mad at himself, blaming himself for you running away, because of the things he said. He cares about you, Peter. He loves you."
“I kill everyone close to me. My parents, Uncle Ben, Gwen, Aunt May... anyone and everyone who gets near me suffers because of Spider-Man.” Peter states.
Peter sighs. The reason he keeps his identity a secret is to protect those he loves. Now, in order to do that, he needs to separate himself from those same people.
hack SHIELD, but Fury doesn't know that. He folds the note in half and walk up to Clint. Its almost midnight. Jeez. Oh, well. He can just sleep in.
"No... he... I should've... god, I insulted him to his face, I told him he was an idiot, I told him he wasn't good enough, I... god, Steve, this is my fault." Tony tells his husband.
Besides, he's looking forward to working with Dr. Banner in the lab, and Peters pretty sure that might be difficult when he's dead.
There's silence. Peter opens the door. "I hate you. Tempting me with vengeance against a guy who's been bullying me since first grade." He has a small smile as he says the words, though.
Spider-Man sighs. "And that's my cue to leave." He swings off, leaving a very angry and confused police officer behind.
was Spider-Man helping the Avengers fight bad guys." Peter shoots back. "What do you have against him, anyway?"
"Stark, you called him a kid. I'm going to ask this once, and one time only. Do you know who Spider-Man is?" Fury demands.
“That might be a good idea.” She agrees. A hulk incident wouldn’t help anyone, especially in a tense situation like this.
Steve hesitates a moment... and gives Tony a hug. He relaxes into it, seeming weak and helpless. "Steve... I... please. Please, just let me make it go away. I want it to go away."
Step four- avoid unnecessary contact with people. Wait... no. Peter still needs to be a superhero. So, basically, just destroy his old life.
Peter lands a few blocks away from the Tower, with that stupid grin still stuck on his face. Its too much fun not to enjoy.
Flash walks forward, along the street. Not too far away, Peter recognizes another nerd (and used-to-be-friend of his) that Flash frequently bullies.
The symboite drips off of it's host, and Spider-Man collects all of it in an air-tight jar, quickly sealing it.
"Peter, I got you some food!" Steve calls, coming into the room. He's wearing a tight, sweaty, tank top, most likely because he just came back from a run.
Being vague isn’t working. Maybe being ridiculously talkative will. “Um, so, I’ve got the proportional strength of a spider, I can climb walls (don’t ask me how), I have super agility and speed, I don’t die from web-slinging or feel woozy while upside-down, I have horrible luck, I have a super-healing factor that isn’t nearly as good as Wolverine’s, um, oh, I have my Spider-sense, erm, an increased metabolism, the awesomeness I mentioned, as well as the trouble magnet, super good looks, quick reflexes, and being super talkative.” Peter takes a breath. Whew.
"Wait!" He calls, probably too quickly. Peter turns around. "Um, do you want to help me? I could use another pair of hands." Tony offers.
“Well, did you notice that he was surprisingly good at picking up on small details? How he noticed you were following him?” She points out.
“No, actually. It was part of some kind of experiment. That’s all I know. It was some kinda cross-breed, but it was radioactive, too. I really dunno how it worked. I’ve tried to figure it out, but DNA is complex. Especially when you don’t know exactly what species to compare it to.” Peter explains.
"Not here." Natasha growls, and throw the heating device at Venom, more to catch his attention that to actually hit him.
Tony looks up, a small little smile on his face, although he's still crying. "You sure about that, Capsicle?"
. Because if there's one thing I know about you, it's that you are never going to go down without a fight. You stand here, and now." He grabs his shield off the floor where Venom dropped it.
Clint stands up, and locks eyes with Tony. “What is Peter not telling us?” He asks. “I mean, for some
Steve runs into the room, wearing the new suit that Peter made him. He quickly takes in the scene, and throws his shield at the symboite.
“Nothing. Dad, Clint and Nat were going to teach my how I could defend myself in case a bad guy tried to take me hostage to get to you guys. I didn’t tell you, because you’d tell Steve, and I don’t want him to worry.” Peter fibs quickly.
"Peter, we've talked about this." Steve sighs. "You don't have to give up being Spider-Man. You can-"
"Yeah, I can." Tony growls. "I can't do anything for him. And if I can't do anything, its like I'm not here. If I'm not here, I'm like my father. And I can't be like my father."
He fiddles with his web shooters. "I shouldn't be a hero. I'm just a kid with bad luck who had lost people close to him." Peter sighs. "Just a kid who can never settle down. Just a kid who can never win. Just a kid who always falls short. Just a kid... " He trails off.
Natasha snags some sort of heating source, switches it on, and attempt to press it onto Venom's skin.
Peter gets to his feet. "Who am I to live? Who am I to have this power? Who am I to change peoples lives? Who am I to choose one life over another? Who am I to be a hero?" He asks the empty space before him.
"What if I want to?" Peter asks sadly. "What if I don't want to be a hero? What if I just want to be regular kid who worry's about homework instead of super-villains? What if I don't want to be Spider-Man?"
It starts to spread and grow. If part of Venom is in one place, the rest of him can appear there. Great! Now if only Peter could think of something
Then he runs forward and attacks the symbiote and it's host with a new fever. Natasha helps him as well as she can, but the fighting-style that he's using makes it hard to get close.
Peter misses Dad. He misses how he’d let Peter help in the labs, how he’d give the boy that little smirk.
after you, and I’m thinking any agents that try to take you down would regret it.” Steve suggests. “I mean, if they figure it out, Tony could hack in and delete it. And, you could always be an Avenger. Unofficially, of course.”
“I still don’t understand.” Peter has a frown on his face, but not like the one from a moment ago. This is his thinking face.
Spidey scratches the back of his neck, and stands up. “Um, teenager. And, um, I guess I’ll be going now.”
Peter looks away. He can't look into Clint's eyes, with all the pain that they hold. "Clint... I can't. I... I just can't. I'm... I'm trying to figure out who I am, and... Dad was right. I... I'm not good enough. I'm an ametuer who just happens to have powers. I mean... who am I to decide who lives and who dies? Who am I to choose one life over another?" Peter looks back up at him, taking off his mask. "Who am I... to be Spider-Man?"
"And when we find him, we'll say hi and make sure he doesn't forget to eat." Dad has a smirk on his face, and Clint does too.
"Nonsense. Peter, it doesn't matter if you need to eat six times as much as me. Its fine!" Tony assures him.
"Guys." Steve walk up to them, and puts a hand on each of their shoulders. "Its neither of your faults. Stop blaming yourselves. And Peter- Welcome home."
Steve sighs, runs his hand through his hair. Suddenly, Peter runs up to him. "Hey, Pops!" Peter grins.
"We. Are you sure that you're speaking for everyone?" Peter snaps. "Dad sure as hell thinks I'm useless. Pop wouldn't let me in the field with a gun to his head. Bruce would only teach me to suppress them, and who can understand Nat?"
The screen changes to J. Jonah Jameson. "Spider-Man is a menace! If he had left that to a real hero, I'm betting he wouldn't have destroyed half the road! Who's going to pay for the-"
Peter nods glumly. “I’ll be in my room.” Peter sets the symbiote on the counter, and runs out of the room before anyone can stop him.
"Banner. He tracked your DNA based off your spider-abilities." Clint explains. He takes a step closer. "Pete... everyone's worrying about you. Tony locked himself in the lab. Steve yelled at Thor. Banner almost hulked out. Peter... please. Come back." Clint begs.
"I'm Peter's adoptive Uncle, and I'd like to speak with you about your behaviors toward him. And before you ask, he's not the one who put me up to this. He doesn't even know I'm here." Clint tells him.
Tony rolls his eyes. "Anyhow, Peter, could I see you for a sec? I wanna run over a new modification I came up with for your webs."
"Tony, no, your not. We can both protect him, teach him. Your not worthless. You're nothing like your father." Steve assures him.
"How did you...?" Clint sighs and shakes his head. "You know what? Never mind. I don't want to know."
Why him? Of all the people who all of this could’ve happened to, what are the chances that it would happen to Peter?
Peter yawns. "Kay." He acknowledges, not really listening. He's too tired to pay anything much attention.
"Yeah. That'd explain why he's so short, and why he looks like a twig. I mean, his strength is crazy when put in comparison with how tiny he is!" Dad chugs his drink.
! I just can’t. I’m sorry, and I know that people aren’t supposed to lift the hammer, but I just can’t. Please, just quit leaving the hammer in the middle of the walkway.” Peter walks out, without waiting for Thor to kill him or whatever for picking the hammer up.
"Yeah. I mean... Eddie was a close friend of mine, before and after me becoming Spider-Man. We just kinda... fell apart." Peter explains.
Tony sticks his head back in the room. “I agree with Steve, but I don’t want Natasha to murder me, so...”
Clint's outfit is a decent disguise. A simple light green shirt, solid blue jeans, a purple cap, sunglasses, and converse. No one even looks twice. No one even guesses that there's an Avenger just a couple feet away.
Peter waves it off. "Its nothing." He says quickly. "I let him do it, and don't fight back, in order to add to my 'weak nerdy kid' disguise. And it works. No one ever thinks I'm Spider-Man."
Peter snorts. Natasha needs to stop this before Fury figures out that Peter is Spider-Man. Maybe a more disciplined approach."Director Fury, Spider-Man isn't a threat. Why-"
It pains Clint to see Venom smiling that grin. That body doesn't belong to him. It belongs to Peter.
Under the message is a string of numbers. Steve sticks the note to the fridge door with a gaudy Las Vegas magnet he picked up at Goodwill three years ago. Quickly turning out the lights, he crosses the room, drops down into the armchair, and mutes the television.
“Clint, you take the non-fliers, meet me and Thor there. Cap, I promise, all we’ll do is keep a perimeter. We'll make sure he isn't provoked.”
“Yes. I told him to do it if he felt it was necessary and I’d support him no matter what he decides.” Steve takes a sip of his water. “Did you know J wasn’t talking to him?”
, he loves me lots, so why won’t you marry him?” Peter whines, sniffling, and Steve isn’t sure if the kid is beyond tired, and therefore more emotional than usual, or if he’s just a damn good actor.
“What about Delilah?” he whispers when they finally part for air, regardless of the fact he wants nothing less than to ask about her.
“And where were you last night?” Pepper snaps. “David said you and the team finished around eight last night. Even with giving you a couple hours’ leeway for a quick nap, you still should’ve been home by ten, eleven at the latest. So imagine my surprise when I get a phone call at two in the morning from a panicking Steve asking if I’ve seen you in the last few hours. Imagine my surprise when I try to get into your office at six o’clock only to be told by your damned AI that you’re not on the premises but ‘I can assure you, Ms Potts, Mr Stark is in good health’. Imagine my surprise –” Her voice rises, fills with rage. “– when Clint and I, after spending – what was it, seven hours? – running around all of Manhattan, decide to stop in so I could change my shoes before my feet started bleeding from all the blisters I’ve obtained during this absolutely immature game of hide-and-seek, and we find you
“Sure, sure, I can see it. You also have what looks like...melon in your hair, why do you have melon in your hair?”
“I wish you'd told me sooner, Tony. I wish I'd seen how much my relationship with Delilah was hurting you. I never meant to cause you any kind of pain.”
Steve exhales sharply but ignores the slightly mocking tone in his mother’s voice. “Yeah, him. Well, he said there was some sort of–of emergency and left his kid with me.” He pauses, tries to stave off the panic by taking deep, measured breaths. “What do I
“If you want me to leave, I will.” When Tony doesn’t respond beyond taking a large swallow of his drink, Steve tamps down on his frustration and continues, “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable in your own home, and obviously, you’re not exactly comfortable with the fact that your soulmate lives here, too. So say the word, and I’ll go so you can have your home back.”
begins. A sharp pain blooms into existence where his jaw meets his throat, and he’s having trouble breathing with the arousal that spreads through him like a wildfire. He thinks he hears Tony whispering an
“Oh, that bookstore’s great! Their selection is amazing, and their prices can’t be beat. I’m just coming from that hipster clothing shop down the street – my son didn’t bother telling me none of his pants fit any more, so here I am shopping on a beautiful Saturday when I’d much rather be curled up on the couch watching
Tony shrugs uncomfortably. He knew Steve would question the decision, but he hadn’t counted on feeling so awkward and clumsy when it came to explaining. He keeps his gaze on Sarah as he speaks.
dating her, so she can't be a bad person or anything, and she's definitely beautiful, and I know you're not dating her just for her looks. You have standards, I'm, I'm well-aware of that, so don't think I'm trying to imply that you objectify her or anything, because I'm not. But… Steve, I really don't like her. I hate that you're with her. I hate seeing you happy because you're happy with her. If you weren't with her, I'd be okay with you being happy, but you are with her, and ー and I hate it.”
“Okay.” Steve brushes his hair from his forehead with a sweaty hand. His heart is racing in his chest, pounding faster than he keep count of, but he needs this. “Um, well, I don't know how to explain how I know Tony.”
When he’d first heard that Howard had a kid, Steve had been so consumed by irrational jealousy that he’d thrown the file across the room and paced, fuming and glaring at the sheets of paper strewn about. It wasn’t fair, he’d thought, to have laid down his life for God and country, to have lost out on a future and Peggy and kids, only to come back and find out that life had just moved on without him. Even
