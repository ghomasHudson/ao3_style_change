“That’s right, pretty baby, just enjoy it.” Steve moaned when the plug slid free, leaving him clenching on nothing. Tony made no move to do anything else, simply standing there, watching Steve react for long minutes. Eventually he ran a single fingertip over Steve’s flushed cock and balls, tracing the satiny skin. “I’m going to figure out exactly how your body works, sweetheart. Every little thing that makes you crazy. And then I’m gonna make you lose your mind.”
Tony slid his fingers beneath Steve’s chin, gently tilting his face up. For a second, hope rose in Steve’s chest. Maybe Tony would let him slide. Take him to bed and forget all about the last few days. “You know, I’d be more inclined to believe that, if you hadn’t already promised it all before and lied.” Steve scowled at him and a smile broke across Tony’s face. “Ah, there’s my grumpy boy. Now, where was I? Oh, yes. Since you seem incapable of behaving, you are going to lose the rewards I have given you. It will be your responsibility to earn them back. If you can manage to behave that long.”
A shorter installment this time, but there wasn't a good place to break it up if I'd gone on further. Sorry it's been a few days. Real life has gotten a little stressful, which makes it hard to write. I'm trying to get back into the habit. As always, all mistakes are mine. I always respond to comments, and hearing that everyone is enjoying encourages me to keep adding to this little (epic) story. Enjoy!
“Clothing is a privilege, honey, and you haven’t earned it yet. It’s okay. Nobody’s gonna touch you, and they won’t mind. From what I understand, James was a difficult case himself. He’ll understand what you’re going though.”
“Okay, sweetheart, I’ve got you.” Tony adjusted several dials before flipping a switch. Steve screamed as pulses of electricity ran through his body, centering on that numb area. Only it wasn’t quite so numb anymore. Instead it was aching, throbbing with each pulse from the machine. He thrust down against the frame, pulling at the cuffs holding him still. It was worse than anything that had already been done to him, an all consuming pain that somehow registered as pleasure to his stupid body.
Tony rolled him onto his side, settling his arms in front of him and a thick pillow beneath his head. The plug was slid from his hole and he gasped softly as the alpha’s thick cock pressed inside of him. He moved slowly, giving Steve a chance to adjust, but he was already sensitive, unaccustomed to any type of penetration, that every touch was overwhelming. One of Tony’s hands wrapped loosely around Steve’s cock, providing delicious friction as each thrust rocked his hips forward. The other hand slid beneath his cock, stroking over the smooth stretch of skin where his balls used to be before pressing in and rubbing firm circles against the area.
"Yes, Sir." Steve felt his shoulders relax for the first time in two days. This was exactly what he needed. "Thank you, Sir."
Steve was placed onto a thick mat on the floor, the restraints on his ankles fastening to metal loops on the ground, his wrists releasing only to fasten together behind his back. His legs were spread wide, with no way to close his legs, but he was able to kneel up in a more comfortable position. He watched as Tony sifted through the contents of several cabinets before returning with an armful of items he placed outside of Steve’s line of sight. He rubbed his hands together almost eagerly. “Ready?”
“You are the sweetest man in the world.” Tony hooked a hand around the back of his neck, pulling him in so their lips could meet. The first kiss was gentle, more of a brush of lips than a real kiss. The second was firmer, followed by more, deeper. A slow exploration of the other’s mouth. It was tender, and sweet, but still intense enough to take Steve’s breath away. He had never truly let himself imagine what it would be like to kiss Tony. To feel the softness of his lips and the coarseness of his goatee scratching at his skin. When they finally broke apart Steve was gasping for breath and the room felt like it was spinning around him.
Steve laid there, body aching with denied need, Tony’s arms wrapped tight around him. He had never been happier.
Tony drew him up into his lap, one arm wrapped securely around his waist as he began kissing him again, mouth occasionally sliding away to press kisses over his cheek or down his jaw as Steve struggled to draw in breath. He moaned when Tony’s mouth slid across the curve of his neck, feeling hotter as it rubbed over his bonding bite. The feeling of teeth scraping over the sensitive skin made him shudder and clench inside.
"Yes, Sir." Immediately Tony's image was hovering in the air above the foot of the bed, making him seem larger, more domineering somehow.
"Good." Warm, soft lips brushed against his. Gentle, so very gentle. "Good boy. You gonna let me take care of you? Buy you pretty things, and dress you up so everyone looking at you knows you're mine?"
Tony paused, maintaining his hold on Steve, to glance over his shoulder at James. “What do you think, honey? Has he had enough, or can he finish this way?” He ignored the wail his words drew from Steve, waiting instead for James’ choice. Another reminder that he did have choice now. For himself and others. Tony hoped that if he drove the lesson home when the man was lost to pleasure, maybe it would remain lodged in his subconscious for the future.
"I know. You feel it every second, don't you?" He moved over to where Steve was still sprawled across the bed, let his fingers trace against his skin, barely brushing. "And fuck do I love you like this. Makes me want to keep you all locked up and desperate all the damn time. And you'd do it for me, wouldn't you? Just to make me happy."
"Yeah... Sounds nice..." Steve could feel his cock beginning to stir in the confines of the cage just from the other man's presence. From knowing he was going to play with him. The first throb of almost pain as the cage prevented him from hardening.
“Such pretty tears for me, Steve. Do you like this? Want to spend the rest of you life begging me to touch you, hoping that I listen? That I’ll be sweet to you when you really need it?”
“It’s an honor, Sir. I’m Phil Coulson, we spoke via the system last night. You mentioned you needed a more durable omega to fulfill your needs?”
Steve arched up against him, feeling pressure against his hole as Tony pressed inside him, moaning and clinging to him as he bottomed out inside of him. His walls clenched around the other man's length.
They watched in shock as the show began to unfold in front of them. The dominant, who was in fact their own Dr. Banner, put on an intricate ropework demonstration using none other than their former enemy Loki, as his model. The god was quiet and a model of obedience before the crowd. As soon as their performance was over, they disappeared into one of the designated aftercare rooms for a little while, leaving the two men speechless.
Laughter finally escaped Loki, his demeanor relaxing. "Very well. Steve. May I ask why you decided on our impromptu lunch date?"
“I most certainly am. And all night, too. Longer, if you argue.” He laughed as Steve’s jaw snapped shut. “Come on, baby doll. Let’s get something to eat. And then I’ll be nice to you for a while.”
Steve woke up with his face pressed against soft warm skin, which after the emotional rollercoaster of the day before, was a promising start. He slowly lifted himself off of Tony, meeting the genius’ dark brown eyes with a blush. “Morning.”
"Oh, such a good boy. Hang on a second." The restraints around his wrists and ankles released, and Tony curled him up into his lap, cuddling him and petting his skin. "You did so well, Steve. So perfect." Soft kisses were pressed against his cheek, his temple. "Is it too much? Do we need to stop, or take a break?"
“Then this is what we need to do.” Tony rubbed a gentle fingertip over Steve’s lower lip. “But it doesn’t have to be so mean. If you’d stop fighting me all the time, we could do it a different way. Nicer. Make it feel good. How would that be?”
Steve shook his head fiercely, unwilling to admit how much the helplessness of his situation was turning him on. A slap landed on his upturned ass, startling him, followed by a rain of blows, often carelessly striking the end of the plug. Steve whimpered, struggling against his restraints, however his hips also rocked back desperately to meet every blow.
"If I wanted excuses, I'd ask for them. You know what to do if it's too much, or too far. You didn't safe word. You chose to ignore me. Didn't even try to ask, like a good boy."
Rogers had been willing to burn the world down and tear anyone who got in his way to pieces for Bucky Barnes. Had lied, stolen, and betrayed everyone he knew in the future. So why hadn’t he actually protected him? Why had James been allowed to wander New York alone? Or been given even the most basic of mental health care? Tony knew the Rogues were in Wakanda. There was nowhere else for them to go. And it was a well developed country, technologically superior to most of the world. Which meant the resources were there. Which meant that Rogers had prevented them from being used. Probably with some bullshit impassioned speech about them only needing each other, and how getting back to the good fight would cure James of everything that was bothering him. The type of shit that people ate up with a spoon, that usually made Tony want to vomit. He made a mental note to send Shuri a nice gift basket. A consolation prize for having to deal with Rogers’ conceit and self-aggrandizement.
Breakfast was soothing in it’s normalcy, even if all the events surrounding it were beyond Steve’s ability to cope with at the moment. He accepted bites of bacon and fruit that Tony fed him by hand, feeling hot and flustered from the attention. Occasionally his cock would throb in it’s confines, causing him to shift on the bed, rocking the plug still buried inside of him. Each time he could feel Tony’s gaze on him like a weight.
Saturday afternoons were one of their usual downtimes together, but Tony had claimed he had a project he'd be working on until late evening and shipped Steve off to the spa to be spoiled. After his experience getting ready for the gala, he had discovered he enjoyed being pampered and polished. Being pretty for his boyfriend and dominant. And cosmetic treatments had come a long way since his days of performing as a part of the USO shows. The facial treatments and massage were guaranteed to turn him pliant and docile.
“Usually. You should have seen how hard James fought me before his surgery.” He pulled a small vial from his bag, handing it to Tony. “Here, use this. It’s a stimulant. Works like a charm. Omega’s are hardwired for pleasure. They can’t resist it.”
There had to be a trick. Tony's voice sounded too sweet. But it had been almost two weeks since he'd been locked up, and he was getting desperate. "Yes. Please, yes."
Tony pressed their lips together in a soft kiss, lingered until Steve was breathless. “I just hope you don’t regret it later. You could do better, sweetheart. I just took advantage of the situation. I wanted you so much, Steve.”
Instead Steve rolled out of bed and padded into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth, noticing that the toothbrush he’d used before was still sitting out. He dug through the drawers until he found a comb, and winced through taming the knots in his hair. When he finished, he could smell the tempting aroma of coffee, and followed it into the living room.
The knot continued to grow, stretching him, putting pressure on the same area the alpha had been rubbing earlier. The alpha’s cock seemed to lengthen inside of him, pressing slightly deeper as he rocked against him, hand flying over Steve’s cock. He gritted his teeth, trying to hold back, but it was too much. A scream tore from Steve’s throat as he exploded, ropes of come striping the tiles beneath him, squeezing around the cock and knot buried fully inside of him, body milking the alpha’s release. Searing pain radiated from the side of his neck as sharp teeth broke through the skin and bonding gland beneath it.
Tony couldn’t resist crossing the distance, tilting Steve’s head back with a gentle touch on his chin. “Did you have a good day, baby?”
“I wouldn’t want it any other way. I… Everything I’ve been carrying? It’s too much. I need a way to make amends. To be absolved. If you can give me that? I’ll be yours. I’ll do anything and everything you want me to. I just need everything else to stop.”
Tony is stretched out on the bed next to him, watching him move. Put on a show, an unhelpful voice in his head reminds him. “Please. Please, Tony. Please.”
Tony allowed him the moment of rebellion, taking the opportunity to turn the vibrations battering James’ prostate up another level. He was rewarded with a grateful moan, before he turned his attention back to the struggling omega. “You have three choices, sweetheart. You can safeword. You can put your little cock back in my hand and let me finish. Or you can keep this up and I will make sure you don’t get to release for the next week. Do you understand, Steve?”
For a moment he thought Tony would have mercy. Would allow him the pleasure after the pain. Steve’s muscles tightened, a shudder running through him. His breathing hitched as his orgasm crested. The hand stroking his cock slid away and a cruel stroke of the crop burned against his aching hole. The pleasure of his orgasm was ripped away, only an unsatisfying dribble of come leaking from the tip of his cock. All of the need and desire were still there, but he felt nothing.
When Steve's eyes opened, he was stretched out on the bed, head resting in Tony's lap. Gentle fingers combed through his hair distractedly as the other man read through something on his tablet. As soon as he felt Steve stir, he set it aside, smiling down at him. "How do you feel?"
Tony watched him, eyes filled with a dark pleasure, noting every tortured breath or muffled whimper. Cataloguing every reaction.
Steve pasted on a false smile, walked to the older Alpha’s side. Being that close to him was torture. Tony smelled woodsy, rich and decadent, and the scent would linger on Steve’s skin for hours, making him ache inside. Of course he never responded to Steve as an omega. Only a teammate, maybe a friend at best. Of course not. Tony Stark was known for only having the best. He’d never choose a broken omega who had the body of an alpha.
He didn’t have much to pack, had been traveling light for a long time. Bucky wrote a letter for Steve, saying all of the things that had been left unsaid between them for far too long. Left it in his room for him to find when he came back. Bucky said goodbye to Shuri, thanking her for everything she’d done for him. Then he left Wakanda for the last time. Made his way to New York, slowly but steadily, impossible to track. He had some amends to make.
It was cool against the heat of his body, but slowly began to warm. The first warning was a slight tingling from his passage as it squeezed around the intrusion, however slowly the tingles turned into a burning itch that Steve couldn’t scratch. His hips churned trying to get some relief with no results, the agony increasing as the lubricant continued to heat.
Tony shrugged, spearing one of the vegetables and studying it speculatively. “Not really, no. Especially not when I-“ He stopped, glanced at Steve and cleared his throat. “Never mind.”
Steve soon lost track of time. He knew days passed, based on the times the gag was removed to allow him to eat, and Tony dragging him to bed each night. The other man held Steve close, and every time he would squeeze his eyes shut, desperate for the oblivion of sleep. He was not that lucky. The pressure of the liquid weighing him down inside slowly decreased, but the cramping agony of the plug did not. The buzzing vibrator was his constant companion, turned off only when it was time for another attempt at sleep, but even then the unrelenting desire for pleasure didn’t stop. He watched his belly flatten with resignation, knowing it meant he was absorbing whatever drug he’d been filled with.
This time, instead of a crop, Steve felt a slick finger rubbing against his entrance. Taking the time to work the muscles into relaxing before slowly sliding inside. It was a strange sensation, his body immediately trying to force the invading digit out. Tony took the opportunity to press a second finger into his passage instead. He twisted them back and forth, occasionally sliding out to apply more lube to his fingers before returning. Getting Steve well stretched and wet. “Ready for the next step, pet?”
Steve moaned, began thrusting the toy in and out, slowly getting faster, the slick sounds of Tony's hand moving over his own cock behind him spurring him on.
Steve breathed into Bucky’s mouth, allowing him to swallow all of the soft sounds he made. The desperate little whimpers. He felt Tony’s hand slide between his thighs again, reaching for Steve this time. He wasn’t sure what he did, but Steve arched beneath him, choking out a loud cry, shuddering helplessly in Bucky’s arms. He heard a quiet humming sound begin beneath them, and Steve seemed to lose his mind, thrashing and crying out, body rocking up against Bucky’s, Steve’s still soft cock rubbing over Bucky’s stomach.
He screamed, again and again, as soon as his lungs could draw air. The pleasure ripping through him, showing no sign of stopping, as Tony continued working in his ass, the suction relentless on his nipples and cock. He couldn’t think. Couldn’t breathe. He released again, a peak in the unending pleasure, and the world went black.
“There you go. You have permission, honey. You come whenever you want to.” Slick fingers rubbed over his entrance and thrust deep inside of him. Each stroke stretched his sore hole and rubbed against his prostate, quickly building him to the edge after the earlier teasing and his night of denial. Steve moaned, trying to rock back to meet each thrust, passage squeezing tight around him. When Tony spoke, his voice was fond. “Greedy little thing. Is this not enough for you, honey? Do you need another?”
“See, that’s it. That’s it exactly. We spent all that time thinkin’ we were weak if we gave in, but nobody ever gave a crap if alpha’s followed their instincts. But we’re the emotional ones, and that’s where the problem was.”
"You're going to regret that, but I'll hold you to it." Suddenly the hand in his hair was gone and the grip on his cock was replaced with tight wet heat as Tony dropped to his knees and wrapped his mouth around him. It only took a few strokes of his tongue before Steve was crying out in pleasure, Tony swallowing around him.
Steve cried out again, only a few drops spilling with his orgasm. His balls were throbbing, wrung dry, and his cock was agony. Each touch of Tony's hand feeling like sandpaper scraping over the delicate skin. "Please! Tony, Sir , please!"
Steve turned glassy eyes up to look at him and heard Tony’s breath leave his chest is a soft rush. “Thought what, Tony?”
Steve moaned into the blankets as the clamps pressed deeper into his flesh, driving him crazy. He couldn’t still the movements of his own body, responding helplessly to the torment. Slick fingers pressed firmly against his hole, rubbing hard circles, and he rocked back against them desperately, needing them inside him. Two fingers breached him in a rough thrust, just enough to burn, and he chased the sensation.
Tony was quiet for a moment, processing. But his fingers continued combing through Steve’s hair. “And in your world, I’m an alpha?”
Tony eyes the wildly struggling omega, mouth turned in a wry smile. “I think there might be some resistance to that idea.”
"Alright." Steve carried their dishes back into the kitchen, put them in the sink, then returned to the living room. Tony was stretched out on the couch, a movie cued up on the television.
"I did promise you, Steve. Good boys get dessert." Tony reached out and grasped Steve's wrists, pinning them down beside his head. Finally he leaned forward and began to devour his mouth once more. The kiss was heated, and Steve's body felt like it was going up in flames. He wanted to cling onto Tony, to reach up and grip the lapels of his suit jacket, to hold on tight. But he couldn't. Somehow, he couldn't bring himself to break the grip Tony had on his wrists.
Tony smiled, refilling Steve’s mug and adding cream and sugar. “Far be it from me to ever stand between a man and his coffee. That’s just plain mean!”
“It turns out SHEILD only has access to one alpha high level enough to balance you out. Tony Stark.”
Not giving Steve a moment to recover, he slicked a thin layer of lube over his numb skin and fed him back into the cage. Another soft click was followed by the sensation of the metal tightening snugly around his shrunken cock. He whimpered, knowing the torture that was waiting for him when the effects of the cold had worn off.
The sound of a bottle opening was followed by slick fingers probing deep inside of him. Steve tried to shuffle away from the intrusion, but couldn’t move. One of the fingers pressed deep inside of him, rubbing against a spot high inside his passage. The feeling was uncomfortable, and grew more so as it pressed harder, prying him open. A wave of cramps ran through Steve’s abdomen, and he tried to make his words intelligible, demanding to know what the hell Tony was doing to him. The alpha ignored him, but it didn’t really matter. Steve knew exactly what was happening.
"Whatever I want, right? That is what you promised earlier, if I would just let you come. Which I did. Because I am a kind and generous man."
He let out a groan and turned his face into the spray, trying not to remember the time he’d spent standing in the doorway watching Tony’s clever hands manipulate holograms and machinery. Like a creep. Or a stalker. Because no matter what he did he couldn’t get the other man off his mind. Couldn’t stop fantasizing about what it would feel like to have those callused fingers running over his skin.
Tony's eyes narrowed, boring into Steve's. His lips slid into an evil smile as he gestured to one of the barstools at the counter. "Why don't you have a seat while I make us breakfast?"
He couldn’t stop screaming as the machines continued working over him. Every breath seemed to center the burning on that single spot. His omega gland. It had to be. He could almost feel it swelling inside his passage, robbing him of the ability to focus on anything else. Each time he thought he’d gotten on top of the sensations, his alpha adjusted one of the dials, and he spiraled away again.
When his knot deflated, Tony gently slid free from Steve’s body, fitting the plug snugly into him, trapping his come inside. He tucked the thick blankets over them, arms wrapping around Steve’s waist, holding him close. The lights turned out, leaving him staring into the darkness until he fell into an exhausted sleep.
Tony waved his apology away. “Don’t worry about it. I’ve finally learned the fine art of delegation. Besides, I have plenty of plans for my pretty little toy. As a matter of fact, there is something I’d enjoy. Something I’ve always wanted, but no one else has been willing…”
Steve nodded, allowed himself to be guided to his feet and led back to the bedroom. He felt wrung out and limp. Out of energy to fight for the day. Tony pressed him back onto the thick mattress, and he stayed there, too exhausted to move as the older man stripped, tossing his clothes onto a chair before climbing into bed next to him. His eyes lit up, glowing the same unnatural blue as before, and Steve felt his wrists pulled together, the cuffs fastening them in place. His ankles followed suit, leaving him bound and helpless.
He shook his head, clucking his tongue. “Not right now, Steve. I’m being nice to you. Taking care of you. Just let me.” Tony slowly finished washing Steve, letting the cloth stroke over his skin. Over and over until he was sensitive and squirming beneath the water, breath coming in soft pants. Finally Tony seemed satisfied. “Come on, stand up sweetheart. Have to get you dried off.”
Steve obediently slid out of Bucky’s arms and moved to stand behind Stark. Steve who had never obeyed a single order or command in his entire life. And why the hell was he calling Stark alpha?
"Well, we also talked a little about some of the other stuff we've been doing. Not in detail, but she sent me some websites to look at."
A smirk curled Tony’s lips, his voice mockingly sympathetic. “What’s the matter, sweetheart? Need something to rub up against? Get some friction on that poor neglected little cock of yours? It’s been how many days since you’ve been locked up?”
Tony followed him as far as the bedroom, sitting down on the bed and waiting as Steve readied the bath and came back out. Wordlessly, he held out a foot and Steve immediately slid to his knees, carefully removing his shoes and socks. Tony stood allowing him to strip the wrinkled business suit from his body, then moved into the bathroom, Steve following behind on hands and knees.
Steve did tell Bruce. As soon as he found him working in his lab. Then stood at the back of the room, smirking, as he gave Tony the most impressive lecture on responsibility, safety, and "not fucking experimenting on yourself" that anyone in the tower had ever heard. The other Avengers may have watched on a screen in the common floor living room. Natasha may have provided popcorn.
A few days after Tony’s promised punishment, Steve woke to soft tickling touches running over his body. He tried to turn away and was stopped with a metallic clank. His eyes flew open. Tony’s mischievous grin greeted him. “Good morning, sweetheart. Sleep well?”
When they’d finished eating, Tony studied him over the rim of his coffee mug. “What?” The word came out a little harsher than Steve had intended.
Steve clenched his hands in the bedding, struggling against the urge to touch his hardening cock. Tony glanced down, then back up to his face. “Go ahead, sweetheart. Touch yourself. Jerk off like you want to.” There had to be a trap somewhere, but he didn’t care. Steve immediately wrapped a hand around his cock and began stroking hard and fast, desperate. It felt a little smaller in his grip then before, but Steve pushed the thought from his mind as Tony sped his movements to match his pace.
"I suppose that's acceptable. This way." He led the way into the kitchen, gesturing at the small table in the corner. "Would you like something to drink?"
The toy stilled and he sobbed, soft broken sounds low in his throat. His skin felt tight and hot, like he was going into heat. Overwhelmed with the need for release, he babbled pleas for mercy, hoping his alpha would be kind. A hot wet mouth surrounded his tender cock, suckling gently, and he screamed. The pleasure from the touch was nearly agony. He begged for him to stop, to give him his cock and end the torment. Tony mouthed over him, licking and sucking, until he was wound up so tightly he was shaking with it. So oversensitive that he wasn’t sure if he could release.
The sound of Tony’s hand stroking himself increased in speed, his breathing becoming more labored. “Then I would have fucked you all night long. Let you come until you were spent, and locked you up nice and sweet before bed. That’s what you would have gotten if you’d been good.” Another groan, then Steve felt hot streaks of come striping his back, slowly sliding down his skin. “Fuck, that’s better. Now I can focus on you.”
The elevator doors slid shut, carrying Steve down towards the lobby. Away from the team that didn’t want him. Would never accept him. He ducked his head and hurried out of the building, not wanting to draw any attention to himself. Uncertain what to do now.
Tony turned back to Steve, flashing him an evil smile, watching him wince in response. “You heard the man.” He slowly increased the pressure until Steve’s eyes rolled back, hips rocking back and forth in small movements, no longer trying to free himself from Tony’s grasp, but unable to hold completely still. Tony stopped, finally satisfied, when the trapped cocklet was stretched painfully, filling most of the tube’s length and flushed a deep red color. With a sigh of relief, he finally released his own aching cock from the confines of his jeans, stroking his hand slowly over it as he stepped back, turning enough to watch both men fall apart at the same time.
Steve let out a squeak. The slaps were a little harder than usual. Normally the older man worked up to it, knowing he couldn't sustain that level of force for long. Today, he seemed to be having no problems. He writhed on his lap, arching back into the blows, feeling his skin warm. The pain driving his arousal higher, until he was rocking down each time, desperately seeking friction against his cock. "Tony, please? Please?"
"My good fucking boy. So pretty for me in his silk panties." His fingers slid between his cheeks, pressing and rubbing over Steve's sensitive hole through the silk making him whimper and writhe.
Tony nodded. “It’s alright. We’re figuring it out, remember? Good. So, while we wait for the breakfast Jarvis ordered to arrive, there are a few things I wanted to talk to you about.”
“Always.” He kissed one of the rosy cheeks before pulling back. “Now, how about I draw you a nice hot bath, and let you soak while I see about some real food. Your metabolism is high enough that I’m concerned about how long it’s been since you’ve had something solid.”
“Yes, alpha.” Steve whispered. Tears filled his eyes and his lower lip trembled, but he slowly stilled and arched his hips enough to place his encased cock in Tony’s waiting hand.
James immediately leaned back, and Steve sobbed through the denied release, only a few drops of come escaping. Steve shuddered helplessly for longer, body desperate to gain any pleasure from the encounter. Finally he stilled, and Tony motioned James to continue. This time James pressed his fingers inside Steve’s slick heat, causing him to jerk frantically at the restraints, trying to escape from the oversensitivity. “No! No, please! Please! I can’t. I can’t anymore. Please!”
The bed shifted as Tony moved away again, and Steve could dimly hear the slick sound of more lube. A moment later he felt something larger and slick pressing against him before sliding inside to press snugly against his prostate. A soft whine sliped out as his hips ground up into the air desperately searching for friction.
“That’s right. Such a clever boy I have here.” His hands gentled, sliding soothingly over the throbbing skin of Steve’s ass and thighs. “My good boy put on a very pretty show for me. Do you remember what happens next?”
Steve didn’t have time to respond before he felt the slight prick of a needle in the side of his neck. Tony was already setting the syringe aside when he tried to jerk away from him. The tight arm around his shoulders prevented him from moving. This Tony was stronger than the one he’d known, and infinitely more dangerous.
Steve felt like he was floating through the next week. Tony’s presence was overwhelming in the best ways, and he was always there. They became so attuned to each other that it made him want to cry. That was what he needed and was denied for so long. If he had his way, they’d never leave the penthouse again. But of course, the world never worked that way.
Tony leaned down, pressing their foreheads together. “I’ve never seen you look like this when you cry, Steve. Please tell me?”
A wicked grin spread across Tony's lips. "Is that what you want, Steve? For me to prove it? Is that what you've been waiting for?"
Steve smiled in spite of himself. “Let me finish! I was thinking about us, and how much I wish I had someone to talk to about everything. And then… It made me think of Bucky.”
"Don't worry. I'll take care of it. This is what's going to happen. We are going to finish breakfast, then you are going to go take a hot bath, for at least an hour. When you get out, you're going to relax, read or watch tv, until I come get you. And then I am going to make sure you don't have a single thought in your head for the rest of the day. How's that sound?"
Training has been incredibly boring with plenty of downtime, so it looks like I’m still on a role. Let me know what you think and if you have any requests for especially dark kinks for evil Tony. Enjoy!
It would be okay. As long as his alpha was close to him, inside of him, he could take anything. The thought was soothing for a moment, until he realized there were three devices. He screamed, clamping down internally as his sensitive cock was fed into the remaining tube. Steve’s hips jerked against the strap holding them down uncontrollably, the sensations racing through his body more than he thought he could take.
Moments later a wave of pulsing green light swept across the ground, pushing the constructs back towards their maker, forming a ring blocking him from view. Then, with a blinding flash, they appeared to burst, leaving a ring of slime on the pavement, surrounding the sorcerer who was bound and gagged on the ground. There was no sign of anyone else.
When Steve woke alone the next morning his stomach felt like lead. Breakfast was waiting on the table, but there was no sign of the other man. He continued to eat his meals alone for the rest of the week. Even when the gag was released, Steve was too afraid to ask JARVIS about Tony’s whereabouts. Tony spent most of his time working, or at least somewhere other than the penthouse. He directed Steve with simple commands, and kept him restrained on the far side of the bed each night. The only time he touched Steve directly was when he mounted him each night, with no gentleness and little care. Tony seemed so bored by the whole process that Steve was unable to find any pleasure in it either.
Steve strained against his bonds, trying to get closer, able to wrap his lips around the other man’s cock and feel it pulsing down his throat. “Let me… Let me help you. I want you. Now. In my mouth. Please. Tony, please!”
Breakfast arrived, and was spent talking, making plans for the day, and feeding each other bites of bacon and syrup drenched waffle. Tony inhaled most of the coffee before seeming ready to face the day.
"You can. You can if I want you to. And I want to hear you say it. I want to hear you beg me to let you come. To give you permission. Then maybe, I'll consider it."
Steve tried to answer but the words choked off when a quick succession of slaps landed over his ass and thighs, with careful attention payed to landing strikes on his plugged up hole. He writhed helplessly, never trying to get away. Tony must have been paying close attention, because the flurry of blows stopped, leaving him shuddering on the edge of release.
Steve shuddered at the low, dangerous tone in the other man’s voice. He felt another spasm deep inside his passage, and suddenly the numbness was gone, replaced instead by the most overwhelming pleasure he had ever felt. Each nerve felt like it was being stroked, every muscle locked up tight as the sensation built. It was similar to what he had felt a few times, when the dildo hit the right spots inside, but far beyond.
Unfortunately, it was short lived. The burning itch deep inside his passage retuned with a vengeance, resulting in Steve humping the mattress desperately. Over and over again he tried and failed to sate the need simmering inside of him. Eventually he curled into a tight ball, knees drawn up to protect his raw cock. Pressing back into the warmth of Tony’s body, he cried himself to sleep.
With nothing else to distract him, Steve became aware of the ache within his core. He shifted back against Tony, trying to elicit a reaction. He needed his alpha’s cock buried deep inside of him, scratching the maddening itch that wouldn’t go away. When that didn’t work, he shifted around on the bed until he could grind his hips into the mattress, rubbing his cock against the soft sheets. It was hard to get enough friction given his bound position, but eventually he pulsed against the material, closing his eyes in relief.
"Your punishment sweetheart." Tony picked up a small piece of metal and what appeared to be a clamp. He spent several moments attaching it to the cage around Steve's cock, fussing until it was positioned properly, before picking up a small remote control. He moved over to a chair in the corner, shifting it to give him an unobstructed view of Steve on the bed.
“I never told you to stand, pet.” Steve immediately dropped back down to his knees. He was rewarded by gentle fingers carding through his hair. “Good boy. You won’t be needing those again. The only clothes you will wear are the ones I choose to let you have. When I allow you to be dressed at all.” Cool metal seemed to flow around Steve’s neck, wrapping around his throat before solidifying into a solid band. It was snug enough to be a constant reminder, but not tight enough to affect his breathing. A small kindness. “Your collar will allow me to know where you are and what you’re doing at all times. It will also prevent you from leaving the property without my permission.”
Steve felt his stomach sink. As bad as his current situation was, he had no idea what would happen to him if his alpha were to die. Would he go back to the center or get passed on to another stranger? He didn’t realize his breaths were coming harsh and too fast until a firm grip on the back of his neck sent calm radiating through him.
Steve’s gaze drops, unable to look at the other man’s face as he answers. “No. Before the serum, I wasn’t even a beta. I was just a null.” He swallows the lump in his throat as Tony’s hands pet soothingly over his back. “I think… I was just too sick to develop right.”
The genius rubbed the back of his neck, embarrassed. “Yeah… About that.” His eyes lit up, glowing bright arc reactor blue for a moment before fading. Steve’s phone chimed with a text.
for pointing out some grammatical errors so I could go back through and correct them! As always, all errors are mine. I don't have a beta for this story, and I appreciate any errors I miss being brought to my attention so I can correct them.
When they were finished eating, Tony set the tray aside and pulled Steve over to straddle his lap, tilting his chin so their eyes met. “On a normal day, I would punish you for arguing with me earlier.” He held up a finger to stop Steve from immediately protesting. “But, you are not in any condition for that kind of correction right now, so we’ll make an exception. In the future, if you insult my omega or argue with something that is necessary for your health or wellbeing, you will be punished. Do you understand, Steve?”
A part of him had been hurt too many times and was waiting for the other shoe to drop. The rejection to come. By all rights, Tony should hate him. If for no other reason than what this world’s version of himself had done to him. How could he have tried to harm a man as kind and giving as Tony? And what happened when the older man got sick of taking care of him, of how dependent Steve was, and kicked him out of the tower? God knew he’d learned exactly what that felt like only that morning. Could he survive it again?
Work is still mind numbingly dull. Have another evil kinky chapter! Next one should be from evil Tony’s POV. Something to look forward to. Let me know what you think in the comments and I hope you enjoy!
“I’m stalling. Anyway. We make all the arrangements. I work myself constantly so we can have an entire month undisturbed. Just like she wants. But when we get there, we’re not alone. Her friend Ty is waiting for me the second I walk in the door. Chloroform. Knocks me out. I woke up chained in her BDSM murder basement a few hours later. The rest of the month honestly is kind of a blur. I was drugged most of the time. Not sure with what. There was a constant stream of people, mostly men, who all wanted a piece of me. They wore masks so I wouldn’t be able to recognize them.”
James sank to his knees on the cushion, matching his position to Steve’s. Tony settled on the couch, opening the first box. He took his time, partly to give everyone a chance to relax, and partly because hand feeding three people was an intricate dance that Tony was very new to. He already knew that Steve loved being cared for in that way, the real surprise was James.
Due to the amazing comments I have received requesting more chapters for this story, I have decided to continue it. Thank you for all of the encouragement. Once again, I have no beta, so all mistakes are mine.
He felt himself floating in a peaceful darkness. Soft orders to stand, the feeling of his clothes being peeled from his body, barely registered. Somehow he was on his back somewhere soft, eyes still closed. There was a sound he dimly recognized, and then Tony’s hand was on his cock, slow strokes up and down over the length. A moan slipped from his lips and he arched up into the touch.
Steve couldn’t breathe. He felt physically ill at the idea of hurting the man standing in front of him. How could any version of himself have done that? “I wouldn’t… I couldn’t…”
A soft gasp slipped out and Steve’s eyes closed. He could feel the warmth of Tony’s body so close to his. The words spoken in a low husky voice making him throb. “Tony, please…”
Steve woke up with a gasp, his body on fire. His cock was a high-pitched ache, straining against the metal of the cage, and Tony's fingers were buried inside of him rubbing relentlessly against his prostate. He moaned, rocking back against him, trying to force those clever fingers deeper into him.
“Oh sweetheart, you’re a fucking gift.” Tony’s voice was a low growl by the last few words, making Steve shudder helplessly again.
Every time the plug seemed to get heavier. His muscles tiring, unused to the strain, allowing the metal to slip free faster and faster. Until he was clinging to Tony, sobbing freely, begging for mercy, his entire body in flames.
“No. Not that I’m aware of. Can you explain it to me?” Tony reached out, almost as though he hadn’t intended to do it, and began stroking Steve’s hair. He sighed softly, let his head rest against Tony’s knee as he gathered his thoughts.
Steve took his time, using the toilet, washing his hands and face. He managed to find a spare toothbrush in one of the drawers and brushed his teeth, the small bit of normalcy making him feel better. All too soon he couldn’t find anything else to stall with and returned to the living room on dragging feet. Tony put a hand on his shoulder, leading him back into the torture room from yesterday.
Had Tony's eyes always been that dark? His tone always had that predatory edge to it? Steve's hands shook as he went through his cabinets, finding a vase and putting the flowers in water. Tony rested a hand at the small of his back, guiding him out the door and into the elevator. They were silent as they got settled into the back of the car and Happy started driving.
"I'm glad. I don't like you feeling badly about yourself, or thinking that there is anything wrong with you. You are everything I could ever want, Steve Rogers." He felt Tony shift slightly, glance over his shoulder at the clock. "It's after midnight. Your day's over."
When he came back to himself, Tony was still draped on top of him, pinning him to the bed. Gentle kisses were being pressed against his neck and shoulder. Steve wrapped his arms around him tightly, unable to do more than cling to him and tremble.
Taking his own pillow instead, he slid off the bed, ignoring JARVIS’ inquiries to curl up in the corner of the room, face buried to muffle the sound of his tears. He replayed every moment they had spent together, remembering every gentle touch and kind word. The way it had felt to be held securely in his alpha’s arms at night. What it had been like to wake up to Tony’s smile in the morning. Eventually exhaustion overcame him and he fell into a fitful sleep.
Steve sobbed, harder and harder with every release. The pain soon eclipsing the pleasure. Each time became blinding agony. His overworked body felt bruised and battered. When Tony finally released his soft cock, it looked bruised and swollen. The fingers slid from his passage, leaving him feeling empty and unsettled. He immediately began to babble apologies through his tears.
Tony slapped his ass with a small chuckle. "Alright sweetheart. Let's get you unlocked for our little game. Sound good?"
For a few seconds of stunned silence fell over the crowd before the questions came flying faster than before.
He gripped Steve's hips tighter, pulling him back into his mouth. The back of the briefs were wet, dragging against his hole with every stroke of his tongue until Tony dragged them to the side so he could lap at bare skin. Steve cried out, back arching, clenching desperately around Tony's tongue each time it stroked inside of him, rocking against him uncontrollably.
Steve eagerly fell back against the pillows, watching as Tony slid the chain from around his neck. He put the key into the lock and gently slid the cage free. His cock immediately throbbed to life, so sensitive that even the slight breeze of Tony's movements had him biting his lip and whimpering. "Tony..."
Steve then ran the gel Natasha had given him through his hair to lightly slick it back and rubbed a vanilla-flavored balm into his lips. Next, he pulled on a pair of blue silk briefs that Natasha had helped him pick out and carefully dressed in the tuxedo that had been delivered to him the day before. After checking that every detail was right in the mirror, he took the elevator up to the penthouse.
“Fuck.” Steve writhed against the bed, feeling the plug working inside of him, riling him up further. His body was screaming for relief, for a break. But the idea of not allowing his Sir to come, of denying his Dominant… It was worse. “You. Always going to be you, Sir. But I’m pretty sure you knew that.”
“Y’ say that like we ever did fair. I spent my fair share of sleepless nights waitin’ to see if you’d come home or if you died in an alley somewhere. You can stay horny for a couple.”
“I’m okay.” Bucky sniffed softly, drawing back from Bruce’s neck. “Stevie’s an old friend. Nobody’s ever frustrated me as much as the punk does, but he’d never hurt me. Not really.”
The problem was that Bucky was tired. Tired and so fucking broken it’d be a miracle if anyone could put him together again. Bucky’s Steve would have understood. A hundred years and a million miles ago. Would have known to offer Bucky softness and comfort. Like after Azzano. But that Steve was gone. And all this Steve wanted was the fight. Didn’t seem to know how to do anything else.
It didn’t take long for Steve to figure out what the purpose of the injection was. Arousal burned in his veins, the cage twitching in small movements as his cock struggled in vein to harden. The need was so intense Steve wanted to scream. Instead be begged in vain for release. Tony watched him with pleasure, a small smile curling the edges of his lips, as Steve gave into the urge to pry the metal free. Tony laughed as he struggled, pawing at the cage trying to find anything to grasp or pull with no success. It was seamless and smooth. As the unrelenting desire grew, Steve attempted to stroke himself through it in the hopes of even a hint of sensation penetrating the confines. Nothing. There was no relief. No mercy for him here.
Tony takes a deep breath before leaning back to look Steve in the eye. "I have a long history of pushing people away, and the ones I don't, they leave anyway. I've never been good enough for someone to stay."
It was like the vibrator Tony had put on his cage, less cruel but just as effective. His skin felt stretched too tight over his body, cock leaking profusely beneath him. The skin beneath Tony's tongue became oversensitive and swollen driving him crazy, building him higher, pushing him so close to the edge that he was sobbing from the pleasure. "Tony! Tony, please! Please! So close, I'm so close! Don't stop, please don't stop!"
“You will after I get done with you.” After one more rough squeeze to his pecs, Tony’s hands slid down his back, pressing him farther forward, balanced more precariously on his knees. Steve felt his cheeks roughly pulled and held apart, followed by pressure against his hole. He could feel the hairs of Tony’s goatee scratching at the sensitive skin around his rim, could hear the obscene slurping sounds he was making as he devoured Steve’s hole, tongue thrusting in and out, loosening the muscle. But he couldn’t feel any of it.
Tony pressed a second finger in beside the first, sliding deeper before hooking inside of him, finding Bucky’s prostate and beginning to rub against it furiously. He had to hold back a scream, cock jumping inside the cage. He sucked the cock in his mouth fiercely, feeling Steve bury his hands in his hair, trying to pull him away, sobbing from oversensitivity, but still pulsing on Bucky’s tongue. He could feel the orgasm building low in his gut, terrifying in it’s intensity. His body had been denied for over seventy years, but Tony was pulling it out of him in a matter of minutes.
Tony closed his eyes for a moment, savoring the instant agreement from the new and improved version of the most stubborn man he’d ever met. He opened his eyes, refocusing on the conversation. “I’m going to have Happy take you to a spa today. I’ve already scheduled all of your treatments. You’ve been played with hard lately, so today you’re going to get pampered within an inch of your life.”
Steve woke up the next morning, ankles still restrained, covered in dried come and lube. He stretched with a groan, knocking the vibrator onto the floor. It must have loosened from the wall and slipped out during the night. After rubbing his face briskly in an attempt to wake up, he retrieved the keys from his nightstand and released his ankles before gathering everything together to clean, dry, and put away for next time.
Eventually the cramping eased, turning into an inescapable feeling of pressure, overwhelming in it’s intensity. Steve continued to cry, hating what was being done to him with every fiber of his being. Dimly he became aware of his arousal, the vibrations slowly heightening it. He shook his head frantically, remembering Tony’s earlier words, knowing he would carry through on his promise, no matter how much Steve begged him to stop. His entrance clenched around the metal holding it open, Steve’s body tightening then releasing in a rush, slick dripping unchecked over the backs of his legs. He groaned, cervix still spasming painfully around the plug.
The dildo kept thrusting into him, not slowing or faltering for a second, as Tony kept stroking him. Oversensitivity made him whimper, pulling at the restraints, trying to move away from the relentless stimulation, succeeding only in clenching around the cock pistoning in and out of him. "Tony! Sir!"
"No baby. Not this time. But don't worry. I'll take such good care of you." He sped his movements, chasing his own pleasure, each thrust still slamming against Steve's sensitive prostate, until with a loud cry he came. Steve could feel the rush of come filling him up, his ass clenching desperately around Tony's now softening cock. He couldn't be done. He couldn't stop and leave him like this.
“Good. Shall we begin?” Tony settled back against the couch, one hand resting on the back of Steve’s neck. He could feel the tremors running through Steve’s body. Steve knew he was being set up.
“Now that we have him taken care of for the moment, I think it’s your turn gorgeous. Can you hold position, or do you want me to tie you down?”
A second later, he was dropping down on top of him, pinning him to the bed with his weight. Something was different. He didn't have long to think about it before Tony's lips were crashing against his. Steve moaned, clinging to him.
It felt like he was drowning in misery. His alpha didn’t want him. Couldn’t stand to be in the same room as him for long. Tony was still taking care of him, but it was the bare minimum, usually leaving everything to either JARVIS or his inventions. Steve didn’t know what to do. Tony had said he needed to earn back the privileges he’d lost, but he didn’t know how to even start when he never saw the man. Hadn’t realized that being held and called pet names were things he could lose. The apartment started to feel less comfortable and more anxiety inducing. Shadows in the corners felt ominous when the light began to fade leaving him alone. It grew later and later, and still there was no sign of Tony.
Tony stood frozen in the hallway, blinking down at the weeping man on his floor. Steve struggled to get his emotions under control. He needed to get away before he made an even bigger fool of himself. “I’m sorry. I’ll… I’ll go… Somewhere…”
"Of course, sweetheart." Soft kisses were placed down the side of his neck and over his shoulder. "I love you, Steve."
"Now why would I be nice to you like that, when you're being punished, sweetheart? Or did you forget?"
“I know. I should have come to you sooner. Forced my way in. Not waited until Buck riled me up enough to make me storm down here.”
"Good boy." He deftly unfastened the lock, sliding the metal cage off of him and setting it on the bed in his line of sight. "Alright princess, stand up for me."
“And finally, instead of asking your alpha for what you needed, you tried to take it yourself.” Tony’s hand slid between his thighs, rubbing delicious circles into the stretch of skin behind his cock, knowing exactly where to touch to make Steve shudder in pleasure. As soon as he was getting close to release, Tony stopped, leaving Steve panting and disappointed, writhing from the fresh surge of need pounding through him.
Steve’s head thrashed on the pillow, a pitiful whine falling from his swollen lips. Tony reached past Bucky, tapping the end of the toy. The sound of the vibrations increased, and Steve let out a wail. Fluid rushed from the tip of his cock, dripped from around the toy inside of him. He continued to shudder, making piteous sounds, though he made no move to stop Tony or Bucky from doing as they wished with his body. Suddenly Bucky was overcome with the need to feel Steve inside him, hold him in his mouth and be the one devastating him with pleasure. He leaned down, wrapping his lips around the soft flesh, sucking experimentally.
An angled bench rose from the ground, thick padding on the floor around the higher end. Silver manacles gleamed. Steve was pushed to his knees, then bent over the bench, wrists secured to the low edge, leaving his ass propped high. His legs were swept apart, secured both at the ankles and under the knee, keeping him spread wide. "Look at you. So pretty for me. You ready?"
"It... Definitely worked..." He panted, muscles clenching as he got closer to the edge. It felt so damned good, finally having Tony touching him, that he wasn't expecting him to abruptly pull out.  Steve groaned, hips still rolling against nothing, chasing the phantom sensations. "Tony, please!"
They ate breakfast sitting on the overstuffed sofa, which provided Steve with a welcome respite from the plug and allowed him to focus enough to eat. "Thank you, Tony. This is very good."
Tony tilted his face up so he could study it. “Why is it that every time you tell me something is fine, I’m absolutely convinced that it’s the furthest thing from? You don’t seem fine. You seem like you’re falling apart. And as someone with considerable experience in that area, I feel like I’m qualified to judge.”
Bucky lowered a trembling hand between his thighs, let it run over the smooth expanse of the metal. The head of his cock was entirely shielded from touch, only a small hole to allow the release of fluids. There was only the faintest hint of sensation through the small slits along his shaft. His entire cock was held securely, forced to remain soft and small, balls tucked back out of the way, held tight and close to his body by the metal surrounding them. Nothing could touch him, not even himself. He was safe. The thought made him burst into tears.
The smile turned softer, indulgent. Tony kissed him again. "That's my good boy. Good night sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow." He stood there until Steve unlocked his door and stepped inside. His fingers brushed against his cheek one last time before he disappeared back into the elevator.
It took a surprisingly short amount of time to capture the Winter Soldier. Part of that having to do with having mutants on hand that could drop through the ceiling and freeze him in place. The rest stemmed from the fact that this man wasn’t entirely the Winter Soldier. He was just a man. Scared and on the run, not knowing where home was. All it took was the mention of Steve to have him jumping at the opportunity to try to fix his scarred brain. To go through treatment to scrub as much of the brainwashing as possible from his tattered mind.
True to his word, Tony had left him shackled to the bedposts until he had returned with a beautiful collar he had crafted for Steve, made from the titanium alloy of one of the Iron Man suits. He couldn’t stop touching it, running his fingers over the smooth metal. It was slim, only about an inch thick, and could be adjusted at Tony’s whim. Another piece of him that was controlled by the other man. And he loved it. Even if he did have to put up with the smirks and teasing from Bucky.
Tong growled against the wet skin, the coarse hairs of his goatee rubbing over Steve’s entrance, making him feel sensitive and sore. He couldn’t get the words free, couldn’t even beg for what he needed. Tony was building him higher and higher. The alpha had to know what he was doing to him, which meant it was deliberate. Tony wanted him like this.
After his next, much shorter, heat, he practically demanded Tony leave the plug in place for several days. It was soothing, in an odd way. Not only knowing that he held a piece of his alpha inside of him, but being filled in general. Tony seemed to enjoy seeing his omega plugged, so it became rare for Steve to go without.
"I don't know, but I'm not complaining. Bruce? Call SHIELD. Tell them to send a cleanup crew. We are not taking this one."
“Good.” Tony dived forward, sucking Steve’s soft cock into his mouth. He arched up with a cry from the firm, demanding pressure around him, hips starting to roll up in small movements. Tony slid a hand beneath him, fingers rubbing softly against Steve’s entrance. His body jerked back and forth between Tony’s hand and mouth, so overwhelmed with pleasure that it took him a while to figure out what was wrong. Despite how amazing it felt to have a warm, wet mouth wrapped around him, Steve’s cock was still soft and small. He could feel the pleasure building, his balls drawing closer to his body, his muscles trembling. Steve struggled desperately to hold back his release, wanting to be good for Tony. To follow the rules he had set. But the demanding touches proved to be too much for him to bear. He cried out as he fell over the edge, Tony swallowing the come that spilled into his mouth, fingers rubbing harder against Steve’s clenching entrance.
A waiter filled their glasses with water and disappeared with a quiet assurance that he'd return quickly. Tony tilted his head to the side again, studying Steve like he had before. "Would you like me to order for you, sweetheart?"
Steve gave an agonized cry as the all encompassing orgasm he had struggled so hard to reach was ripped away, the pleasure evaporating, leaving him overwhelmed and sensitive, but still burning with need. Tony unfastened the restraints, gathering him into his arms and sliding them both to the floor, holding Steve tightly as he sobbed in anguish. James scooted over to join them, sliding his arms around Steve’s shaking body and tucking himself against Tony’s side. Tony continued to make soothing noises, pressing kisses over his brow until Steve had finally gone quiet and still. “There you are. Oh honey. You’ve been so good for us tonight. Just the best boy. And James.” Tony turned to press a gentle kiss to his lips. “You were so good for me, too. Both of you are just the best boys. How did I ever get so lucky?”
Long moments of silence stretched as Steve turned it over in his mind. Then James’ earlier words sank in. “Wait a minute! What do you mean, a couple?”
“So good for me. Even when I’m so mean to you. Okay, sweetheart. It’s almost time.” The plug cut off abruptly, leaving him disoriented. A second later the cage clicked and slid free. Instantly his cock was hard and throbbing, dripping onto the floor beneath him. He tried to move, to rub against something, anything. But Tony had planned this too well. There was nothing anywhere near his cock. Not even a hint of touch.
“And that’s really all you care about, isn’t it? Not that our parents lied to us. Purposely mutilated us in a way that could have fucking killed us! No. What you care about is being out of control. But you know what, Steve? We haven’t been in control a single day of our lives!”
When they reached their destination, he placed Steve on an examination table, controlling the restraints with a thought. Steve’s wrists were fastened flat against the table by the sides of his head. His feet were placed into easily manipulated stirrups, his ankles secured firmly in place. Once he was certain that Steve wasn’t going anywhere, he allowed himself the time to admire. He ran his fingertips over the fresh bond bite, watching him shudder. Further down to brush over a nipple, toying with it until it hardened beneath his hands. Pleased by the reaction, he cupped one of his breasts, kneading the pliant flesh.
Steve shuddered, hips rocking up to rut against the other man, felt the hard press of Tony's cock against his own. Which trap did he want to fall into tonight. It was always a dangerous thing when Tony offered him a choice. "I... I want to wait..."
"I said no. And because you're being such a disobedient boy today, I think you need to be punished. I think you want to be punished."
Steve shuddered, realizing as he did so that Tony had released him from the restraints at some point. He struggled to clear the fog from his brain, blinked several times as if that would help, before his attention was drawn to sunlight on the window. “Tony, it’s not bedtime.”
"It's okay. Almost done." Steve felt him carefully slip his balls through the tight metal ring, ease the tube over his sensitive cock, felt it twitch against the cool metal making him spasm and shake. The click of the lock snapping into place caused a fresh flood of tears.
“I’m gonna take care of you, sweetheart. I promise. But I think you’re a little too distracted by this to really enjoy my cock.” Tony cupped the cage, squeezing it gently. “What do you want more, baby? My cock or me to touch yours?”
Thor held him closer, relief obvious on his face, prompting the Avengers to put down their weapons. Tony stepped out of the suit, eyes glowing briefly as he sent it away. "In that case, glad to have you back, Point Break. We've got a lot to catch up on. You hungry?"
“Sweetheart. It’s okay. Everything is going to be just fine. Please. Please don’t cry. I can’t stand it.”
He felt Tony gently slide from his body, releasing the restraints and easing him onto his side. Cooling gel was rubbed against his hole, and pressed inside, causing him to writhe weakly, but easing the lingering burning. A soft cloth gently wiped the sweat and cooling come from his skin, followed by the welcome sensation of the cage being fit over his spent cock and balls. Steve heard the soft click of the lock, the chain being slipped over Tony's neck, the tiny sound of the key rattling against the arc reactor.
Loki hesitantly moved closer. "I am quite well here. Does that please you, or do I need to fear my recapture by your hands?"
Bucky nodded again, feeling the heat of Tony’s body moving away. When he returned, Bucky felt an ice pack pressed firmly along the underside of his cock. The cold burned, and he cried out helplessly, struggling within Steve’s tight grip, but Steve held him firm with absolute trust in Tony that he would do what was needed. Bucky’s cock throbbed in agony, the chill slowly seeping into the flesh, numbness spreading. His erection slowly wilted, and he felt a surge of relief that he no longer had to deal with that hard awkward thing attached to him. Bucky’s muscles relaxed as the cold continued to spread beneath Tony’s capable hands until his cock had softened completely. Only then was the ice pack removed. Bucky gulped in huge breaths, felt Tony rub his back, soothing him.
After Tony disappeared to work, Steve’s frustration overwhelmed him. He tugged uselessly at the cage before carefully exploring every inch of the metal with his fingertips looking for weaknesses. There weren’t any. Next he turned his attentions to the plug, twisting and pulling at the base in an attempt to work it out of his hole. Also no success. The more Steve tried, the larger it swelled inside of him, locking in place similar to a knot. But with a curved area designed to not allow any pressure on his omega gland or prostate.
Tony kept him there while he finished cooking breakfast for the both of them, bringing him a cup of coffee when the pot finished brewing. Steve took a sip, hoping for some form of distraction, then paused. Tony had added several spoonfuls of sugar, and a touch of cream. Just the way Steve liked it. "Thank you, Tony."
"Alright Tony." He snuggled down into his side, arms wrapping tightly around his waist, grounding himself.
“What is? The plug? No baby, that’s not a punishment. I… I went into rut. It triggers a lot of instincts, just like your heat. I wanted you claimed, inside and out.”
"Yeah. Thank you." He took the cup, carefully observing the other man, who seemed to be a lot more awake this early in the morning than usual. Tony looked good. Well rested. No sign of the normal dark shadows beneath his eyes. Steve sat up sharply, studying him closer. Improved sleep wasn't the only difference. The strands of silver at his temples were gone, along with some of the deeper wrinkles around Tony's eyes, and a large amount of the scarring on his chest. He didn't appear younger, only less worn. And last night, the way he had been able to manhandle Steve as if he weighed nothing. "Tony, what did you do?"
Frustrated, Steve tried to struggle against his grip. And found himself still held in place, just as Tony wanted him. Extremis had enhanced the other man more than Steve had realized if they were this evenly matched. "Tony...?"
The realization of how helpless he was, the power Tony had over him, was enough to push him over. Come dribbled from the front of the cage and slick gushed over Tony’s hand, leaving Steve trembling and overstimulated. Tony’s ministrations never stopped. He continued to milk pleasure from Steve’s sensitive body, bordering on pain, but never crossing the line.
“I said you could, sweetheart. I didn’t say I was going to help.” He sped his thrusts, roughly fucking Steve’s chest, the head of his cock appearing and disappearing from view, before he came. Stripes of white covered Steve’s chest and face. Tony slid down to the bed, relaxed and boneless. The dildo stilled inside Steve, full length buried inside of him. He couldn’t help the soft whimpers and hurt noises that slipped free. It was what he wanted, exactly what he wanted. But it was also too much. Too intense to survive.
“Go ahead gorgeous. Why don’t you get your mouth on Steve while he plays with his new favorite toy. You’ll love it. He tastes so sweet…”
Turning his back to the setup, he fastened the vibranium cuffs of the spreader bar between his ankles, inching backwards slowly until he could impale himself on the waiting toy. A deep groan tore from his chest at the feeling of being stretched open and filled. Before he became anymore distracted, he set the remote to a random vibration pattern, placing it out of direct reach on the nightstand. Then came a silicone cock ring, more of a deterrent than anything else, but it helped to keep the game from ending too quickly. Finally a set of sturdy vibranium cuffs were fasted around his wrists with a timed padlock. He was as helpless as he could safely allow himself to be.
He clenched around the plug, trying desperately to keep it in place, while Tony found an unending list of excuses to drag him back and forth across the penthouse. Over and over again the plug slipped free, no matter how hard Steve tried to hold it. Each time the older man would scold him then push him against a wall or over a convenient piece of furniture to tease him until he was about to come before leaving him desperate and wanting.
"Good. Good boy. I need you to pick a word for me. Your safe word. And if I hear that, everything stops, and we figure out what went wrong. Can you do that for me?"
And then Tony was talking to him again in that dark mocking voice that sent shudders through his body, made him desperate to please, to obey. "Look at you. So close. So pretty. You'd promise me anything right about now, if I'd just make it stop, wouldn't you? If I'd just unlock your pretty little cock and let you come."
Steve blinked at the assortment. There were pancakes, waffles, eggs, every type of breakfast meat, pastries and fruit. As well as coffee, tea, and several different juices. He turned to look at Tony who seemed embarrassed for once. “Tony, even I don’t eat this much.”
Tony watched him, waiting patiently for him to settle before speaking. “You took that very well, Steve. I’m proud of you. That was your correction for the attitude you’ve been showing me the last several days. You’ve been punished, and now it’s forgiven. But I hope you won’t forget the lesson.” Steve glared at his lap, refusing to answer. “Alright, I think we need a change of location for the rest.” He lifted Steve easily into his arms and carried him into the punishment room. Steve didn’t even consider trying to run, already defeated from earlier.
“Okay. It’s okay.” The alpha rumbled quietly, the sound vibrating through his chest, soothing Steve’s shattered nerves. He whined, trying to press closer, find the feelings of comfort and safety that he’d lost. “I’m right here. Everything is gonna be okay, sweetheart.”
"Yeah." He buried his face into the side of his neck, breathing in the scent of Tony's body. "How do you do that?"
"Alright." He could hear slick sounds from behind him, could imagine how Tony looked, rubbing lube over his thick hard cock. Getting himself ready to press into Steve, stroke inside of him, and make him scream. He felt the blunt head of Tony's cock press against his rim, and slowly sink inside, stretching and burning just enough to make him moan. He rocked his hips back, desperate to feel the other man as deep inside himself as possible.
Tony’s fingers sifted through tousled blond hair. “We’re okay, sweetheart. We can talk about the rest later. How about you just lay here and let me hold you?”
Steve shuddered hard, felt his body squeeze around the dildo buried inside of him, pulse against the metal imprisoning him. His response was breathy and soft. “Yes Tony.”
Realizing it was going to be one of those nights, Steve quickly rinsed off before stepping out of the shower. He dried off quickly, not bothering with clothes, before heading into his closet to retrieve the large box he had hidden inside. If any of his teammates knew about this, he would never live it down.
“Steve, I’m warning you. I will not tolerate anyone talking about my omega like that. Not even you. I don’t want to punish you in your hospital bed, but I will.” Tony’s voice was hard, demanding. A part of Steve wanted to roll out of the bed, drop to his knees, and offer the other man everything.
Tony watched him over the rim of his coffee mug, hiding a smirk behind it. They were barely getting started. "Steve."
"That's right, my good boy. You come whenever you want, and then I'll fuck that pretty little hole."
Tony laughed, guiding him to roll over so they could lay on their sides. "Pretty fucking spectacular, is what that was."
"Good boy. You can relax now." He felt slick metal at his opening, and then pressing inside of him. A thick metal plug, stretching him open, the tip just barely brushing his prostate when he moved. "Now you'll stay all stretched and ready for me, whenever I want to have you. Say thank you, Steve."
Despite Steve’s protests, Tony continued his ministrations, rubbing the gel into his gland, removing his fingers only to cover them again and return to work. Steve’s entire passage was soaked in it at this point, and throbbing without respite. He was moaning and writhing constantly, no longer able to control himself. Just as his body began to tense, passage fluttering around Tony’s fingers in pleasure, he pulled out, wiping his hands on the sheets.
He blew out a breath. “Alright. What I was going to say was that I didn’t really get hungry before. Especially not when I was going through chemo or radiation.”
That was what he wanted to do tonight. Keep his own arousal locked away so he could focus completely on bringing Tony pleasure. He wanted to be used selfishly for the other man's pleasure with no care for his own. That was what he would ask for tonight when they were alone.
"That's just how Tony shows he cares. It's who he is. I mean, if something makes you uncomfortable, say something, but otherwise just let him do it. And as for the other thing, if you want I can send you some links to a few reputable websites, so you have a little more information."
And because insomnia is still strong with this one... You get yet another chapter! Enjoy! Comments and requests are welcomed and loved.
"Me too." Steve moved over to the large desk and allowed Tony to grab his arm and tug him down into his lap. "You help."
Steve wanted to scream as Tony got up and walked out of the room. His nipples throbbed constantly under the pressure of the clamps, and he could feel his hole pulsing helplessly, the feeling of emptiness increasing with every second.
For the second morning in a row, Steve woke to a cock sliding deep inside of him. He could feel slick dripping down the backs of his thighs and tensed. However, the punishment of the day before was too fresh in his mind. He didn’t want to spend another day burning with arousal, unable to find relief. And although he would never admit it aloud, the alpha’s thick cock felt good moving inside of him. Something he had never allowed himself to experience. A moan slipped free when the growing knot began to tug at his newly sensitive rim, sparks of pleasure bursting behind his closed eyes every time it dragged over his tender glands.
The bed shifted as he moved away, rustling sounds from inside the closet, then the sound of footsteps moving back towards the bed. A drawer opening and closing, more rustling. Then the bed was dipping under his weight again, the heat of his body close enough to feel without touching. "How about we try nice this morning? Want me to be sweet to you?"
A wail tore from Steve’s throat as Tony began to spank him directly over the plug, forcing it against his prostate with every blow. Pleasure mingled with the pain, enough to make his cock throb and his skin feel tight, but not enough to drive him over the edge. He pleaded desperately as Tony continued, motions as unwavering as one of his machines.
Tony cleared his throat, drawing Steve’s attention back to him. For a second Steve thought he saw a flash of something blue from behind his sunglasses, but it must have been a trick of the light, because when he looked again it was gone. The waiter was standing beside the table, both of them staring at him. Someone must have asked him a question, but he had no idea what it might have been. “Whatever you want, Tony.” Seemed like the safest answer.
“Thank you. What a good boy I have here.” He chuckled when he felt the harsh shudder that ran through Steve’s body at the words. “I want to take care of you the right way. So, what does an alpha do when they find an omega they want.”
Steve let Tony ease him down onto the mattress. He removed the ring as gently as possible before disappearing into the bathroom. He was back a moment later, cupping Steve’s cock and lifting it out of the way, shushing him softly when he cried out in pain.
By the way, a comment was asking about the story of Bucky taking it from the Hulk earlier. Would anyone be interested in the saga of Bruce and Bucky, before this story takes place? Let me know! Because once they mentioned it, I couldn’t stop thinking about it…
Tony gathered him closer, arms wrapped around him securely. Making him feel warm and safe for the first time in his life. Steve drifted into an exhausted sleep, knowing in that moment there was nowhere else he’d rather be.
"You are doing exactly what I want you to." His hands slid down Steve's arms, releasing the cuffs before curling him into his lap. "Just like this."
“Yeah. We are. I promise. I’m sorry. I should have talked to you, not just assumed I knew what you’d want.”
Steve set the phone down, burying his face in his arms. All thoughts of work were gone, pushed away by the constant buzzing in his ass, strong enough to echo through the metal of the cage, driving him to distraction. Giving up, he pushed away from the desk and carefully made his way to the elevator and back up to the penthouse. If Tony was going to spend the day torturing him, he at least wanted to be upstairs in his space.
“Stop it! Stop threatening me, and calling me pretty names, and acting like you’re going to give a damn for longer than it takes you to fucking break me! Just stop it!” Steve could feel the flush spreading over his skin,  his breath coming in harsh pants.
Steve nodded, tears clinging to his lashes, blurring the room as Tony slipped out of it. A nurse came in within minutes to remove the IV and return his clothes. He dressed slowly, feeling uncertain and overwhelmed. He didn’t know what was supposed to happen next, could only hope that Tony did.
Steve blinked his eyes open, meeting the concerned brown ones above. A wave of emotion rolled over him, making his heart swell in his chest. “I…” He had to swallow before he could continue. “It’s okay, Tony. Not fun, but I can handle it. For you. For us.”
"I don't know, sweetheart... You did go tattle on your Dom. Apparently to another Dom. Got me in a lot of trouble..."
"That's right baby. You keep on doing that. Try to get some touch on your poor abused little cock. See if it helps."
Steve's eyes flew open, darting around the room, taking in the sunlight coming in from the wall of windows. He was in the tower, not the Valkyrie. He was safe. He shuddered, pressing closer to the warmth of the other man's body, allowing it to chase away the shadows. One of Tony's hands was stroking over his back, the other buried in his hair. "Tony...?" His voice sounded watery and weak.
Steve felt dizzy with arousal, slick leaking down his thighs, squeezing desperately around the toy still buried inside of him. “Yes. Please yes. Need you.” His head tossed from side to side restlessly. He couldn’t stay still.
Steve was eager to answer. Wanting so much to please that he didn’t see how easily he was being manipulated into agreeing to his own torture. “I don’t need to rest. I can do this all day.”
When he reached his floor, he shook off his daze and made his way to the bedroom, curious what his Sir had for his this time. On the bed was a small box, obviously professionally wrapped. Again there were no clues as to the man’s identity, but somehow that was a part of the fun. Steve sat down on the bed and carefully opened the present. Inside was a sleek metal plug, thick and just long enough to tease. His hands trembled slightly as he typed his reply.
He closed his eyes, let his head tilt back against the wall. "Yes..." Someone to let go with. To take care of him. To make him feel safe and special. "Yes, this is what I want."
Tony laughed. "I know. I'm so mean to you, but you take it so well. Are you ready for me to turn them on?"
"Come on. I've been thinking about you all day. Being stripped down, waxed smooth, polished up all pretty for me. I think I'd like to play with my sweet little toy for a little while. Would you like that?"
Tony kept his eyes on Steve, watching for any indicators that the sedatives were wearing off. “When would you be available? I don’t think it would be safe to take him out of the penthouse, so I probably need you to make a house call.”
He fell into the rhythm of Tony’s control over every inch of his body, drifting hazily. It was almost a shock when Tony finally came with a throaty groan, holding him down  buried deep until he was done. Steve’s tongue flicked over his lips when he finally slipped free.
Steve felt a fluttering sensation in his stomach that he quickly squashed. This man didn’t deserve his gratitude or his sympathy. He had taken him against his will, authorized medical procedures without Steve’s consent, and who knew what would happen to him next. There were no laws to protect an omega’s interests. He was completely at the alpha’s mercy. He forced a sneer onto his face, turning away. “All the better to control me with?”
Steve's only answer was a whine as he continued to struggle against the restraints, trying to free himself, make it stop. The burning came in waves, peaking and then lessening. It wasn't until Tony stroked him again that he realized why. Every time he clenched around the ginger, it increased, made it so much worse. When he relaxed, it got slightly better. "Oh, shit..."
Bucky laughed. “Yeah, well. I’ve been a POW for what? Seventy years? I wanted to see if I could still provide the Bucky Barnes experience.”
"Alright babydoll. Anything you want." Tony slid an arm under his legs, the other wrapped around his back, and stood with Steve in his arms, carrying him to the bedroom. "Such a sweet little thing I found myself tonight. And you're going to be so good for me, aren't you? Let me do whatever I want to you. Not that a tiny thing like you could stop me, isn't that right?"
He nodded in resignation, allowed himself to be led back into the living room. Tony settled him on the couch, grabbing a plate of sandwiches before returning to sit next to him. Steve was docile and distracted as he fed him. After they’d eaten, Tony laid them back on the couch and cued up a few movies, holding Steve close, allowing his presence to calm him.
Bucky sighed, settling deeper into the cushions. “Remember how anxious I used to get? How it felt like the world was spinning so fast I couldn’t draw a breath? You felt it too, right?”
Steve’s gaze flicked between the message on his screen and Tony over and over again, as several things slotted into place. His eyes grew wide. “Your new sunglasses. The really dark ones. You used them to hide your eyes. You used them to hide your eyes so you could control sex toys you sent me without me knowing it! In public!”
"Th- thank you." He picked up the glass of water and took a drink to clear his head. This was insane. What was wrong with him? He felt overwhelmed, almost drunk off the commanding presence Tony was radiating. This was a far cry from the casual nights they had spent arguing over movies and television, joking about Steve's preferences and all of the pop culture references he had yet to understand.
“Yeah. Sorry Tony. I was just thinking that I’ve been working so much lately that we haven’t really had a chance to do this much. I’ve missed spending time with you.”
“I know that. You can’t expect to always get what you want. And sometimes? I enjoy watching you suffer. Knowing you’re needy and aching? That I get to decide if you’ve earned it or not? I fucking love that.” Tony gripped his wrist, tugged him up and out of the bed. “Come on. You need to eat. Lunch and a movie. Maybe if you’re good, I’ll let you release again later.”
Steve was still handcuffed when he woke up the next morning. His hole ached as it squeezed around the plug still buried inside of him. Tony walked in as he rolled onto his back, trying to stretch sore muscles as much as he was able. The older man was fully dressed, and appeared to have been awake for a while already. Steve felt exposed, naked and restrained on the giant bed.
Steve stayed quiet. All he could think about was that morning. The look on Tony’s face before he left. “Maybe it would be better…”
“Yes Tony.” He flashed a small sweet smile that made Tony’s heart flip over in his chest before obediently turning and disappearing into the bathroom.
Panic surged through him, and Steve flung his arms around Tony’s shoulders clinging to him desperately. “No! No, alpha, please! Please don’t leave me! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!”
Had a few problems with this one. Apparently I’m really good at coming up with ideas to be terribly horribly mean to Steve. Less so when it comes to being nice. Either way, I hope you enjoy this story. I think there’s going to be a short epilogue and then this one will be wrapped up. I have several ideas to work on next, let me know if you think I should start with another A/B/O type or go for straight up masochist Steve Rogers!
Steve’s mind stopped at the mention of Tony’s cock. He’d do anything to feel it again, how perfectly it stretched him, filled him up. “You! You! I’ll always choose you!”
“Yes! Yes! Fuck me. Fuck me, please!” Bucky arched his back, fingers digging into Steve’s skin as he felt Tony’s cock enter him, press inside a little bit before pulling back, only to reach a little deeper with every thrust. It felt like absolution. Like being remade. No longer did he only exist to be a weapon. He could be used to bring pleasure to the two generous men in bed with him, offering him a place in their homes and their lives. Hydra no longer owned him. Tony Stark did. And he would fight to the death to defend what was his.
Steve found himself hanging on every word, sipping the champagne and drinking in every touch or smile the other man offered. Tony finally guided him to the back of the gallery where a large painting was hanging in the place of honor. It depicted a macabre scene of a Hispanic woman sitting at a table with human legs dripping blood on the floor and surrounded by images of death. Even amid the hopelessness, the woman's gaze was steely and determined.
After several hours at the spa, Steve practically floated into the penthouse, surprised to find Tony already there waiting for him. "Hey! I didn't expect to see you so soon. Did everything go alright?"
“You belong to me now, Steve. You will find that I have the right to do a great many things. Not all of which you will like. Now, are you going to behave, or are you eating your first meal in our home strapped to a board?”
Steve nodded, unsure if he was capable of anything else. The warmth of Tony’s body moved away, and a distressed sound caught in his throat. A moment later he could hear the sound of water running, cabinet doors opening and closing, followed by a triumphant cry. Tony walked back into the bedroom, and there was a sense of relief. He came back. He wasn’t gone. He didn’t leave him.
“Good boy.” The restraints released, the bands around his body flowing seamlessly back into the surface of the board. Tony helped him to his feet and guided him into one of the chairs. The cushions were soft, the material silky against his bare skin. The table was covered in a variety of dishes, most of which Steve couldn’t identify, but they smelled amazing. He sat still, watching as his new alpha filled plates for them both, only eating once the other man had started, waiting for the trick.
"Put in the order for breakfast. Exactly what Steve wants, all the trimmings, for both of us. Add coffee."
“Here, let’s get these off my good boy. I want to hold you while we have breakfast.” Tony unfastened the restraints from around Steve’s wrists, took a moment to rub the skin soothingly before pressing a soft kiss to each and releasing him. He slid into the bed, tucking Steve into his side and settled the tray over their laps.
"There we go." He heard the sound of a zipper, and then Tony was guiding Steve's mouth down to his cock, fingers loosely gripping his hair. "How do you want it, sweetheart? Fast or slow?"
Right as Steve reached the edge, Tony slapped his palms down onto his thighs, keeping them pressed down against the bed. His cock spasmed leaking come across his lap, the explosion of pleasure torn away. He kept him still as the last weak spasms shook him, jangling his nerves, causing tears to slide down his cheeks. "Tony...?"
Steve closed his eyes as he felt his cock throb in his pants. It was as though no time at all had passed between the moment Tony left him last night and right now. His skin felt tight, and his breathing sped up.
As he made his escape, Bruce caught his eyes, giving him a wink that made him flush a bright shade of red. It was an almost knowing look. But there was no way Bruce could have any idea what was going on with him and Tony, other than the fact they were dating. Obviously being unrelentingly horny was making him paranoid.
"I bet you can." Tony carefully set him down on the edge of the bed, as though he was afraid he'd hurt him by accident. "Such a pretty boy."
“I won’t. We’re going to lie here, and I’m going to hold you. I’m also going to enjoy knowing exactly how much you’re suffering. And then when you’re ready, I’m going to leave you here, chained to my bed, while I go down to the shop and make you a collar. Because you are not leaving this room until everyone out there is gonna know you’re mine. Understand?”
“Good. Let’s get breakfast. I’m starving.” Tony led him to the living room, where a thick cushion sat on the ground in front of the couch. “Kneel for me, omega. I’m going to feed you today.”
A dark chuckle vibrated against the side of his neck as the thick cock began to breech him, pressing deeper than Steve thought possible. “I thought I was the one fucking you, honey.”
A firm grip on his shoulder jerked him around to face Bucky. “What, were you raised in a barn? Be nice Stevie. This is Remy. He was part of the mission to bring me in, help me get home.”
"I told you. It's passed all of the preliminary tests with no issue. So, I... Instituted a long-term functionality study..."
Steve heard the sound of Tony's belt behind him, rocked his hips faster, but he couldn't really feel it. The metal covered most of his cock, especially the sensitive head. He could only feel slight brushes of material through the small vent holes and it wasn't enough. He could feel his cock trying to harden, pressing against the metal, throbbing painfully.
Steve’s mind drifted to someone he did know who felt like that. Bucky. Bucky who was always so strong and kind and loyal. Bucky who had never lied to Steve once in their entire lives. He said they had been wrong. That he was happy now. Steve didn’t want to admit he could be right. It would mean his entire life had been a failure. He had fought for nothing.
"There's my good boy." Tony pulled the chain from around his neck, and fitted the key into the lock, sliding the cage free. Steve's cock began to fill, his fingers clenching into fists. He had been restrained for so long there was an ache mixed with the pleasure that increased it in some way.
"Good. I'm going to play with you now. And you are going to beg and cry for me. It's not going to do you any good, but you're going to do it anyway. And after I'm finally done playing with you, I'm going to empty those pretty balls of yours, so you can stay locked up for me. Because no matter what, I will always take care of you. Do you understand?"
Tony smiled at him when they pulled up to the red carpet. "Ready? Let’s go." He slid out of the door with practiced ease then turned back to take Steve's hand and help him out of the car. Once he was on his feet, Tony offered his arm like he had at the penthouse. Without hesitation Steve slid his arm through and allowed Tony to lead him through the sea of flashing lights and voices calling their names and shouting questions.
Bucky nodded, letting his head fall forward again. He didn’t know what to do. Who to be anymore. Had come there to end it. And now that wasn’t happening. He felt so lost. “I understand…”
He tried to hold back the tears threatening to fall, turning his rage towards the one thing he thought he might have control over. Gripping the end of the plug he tried to pull it free, allowing any traces of the alpha’s come to leak out. Instead of sliding easily, it seemed to expand, lodging itself more firmly inside of him. Anger and grief battled inside of him, the tears finally sliding down his cheeks. He was helpless. Owned. And he hated it. Any chance of living a normal life was gone.
The material rubbed over Steve’s skin like a caress, making his stomach tighten with desire. The unfulfilled need from the day before seemed to flood back into him, especially when Tony’s clever hands began sliding over his body. Teasing over his bond mark, sending shivers down Steve’s spine. Sliding down his chest to knead at his pecs before flicking his thumbs over hardening nipples. Steve’s eyes fell closed as he arched forward, offering himself to his mate.
When Tony reached down for him, Steve darted forward, sinking his teeth into Tony’s hand hard enough to draw blood. “Ow! You little shit!” Tony jerked his hand free, glaring, as Steve bared his teeth and growled at him. “Okay, that’s enough! You wanna be put in your place? Fine. I can give you that. But I don’t think you’ll like it as much as you think.”
“It’s a miracle you’re still functioning, Cap. We’re not even talking about having to bench you, we’re talking about survival. And unfortunately, you’re so far out on the spectrum, we had to find a similarly placed alpha as a match. Which left us with a lot fewer options. Do you understand what I am saying to you?”
"Good boy. Do you like my little dungeon? After the first night you submitted to me, I built new restraints for each and every thing in here. Just for you."
“I made it just for you, sweetheart. Don’t worry, it’s not permanent. Just for tonight. It’s going to keep you stretched open for me, so first thing in the morning I can slide right into you, no prep needed. Fuck you hard, just the way you need me to, so you’ll feel me all day long.”
“I think that’s enough foreplay, sweetheart. I want to be inside of you. Now.” Slick fingers pressed into his clenching hole roughly, twisting and scissoring to stretch him enough for Tony’s girth. Occasionally rubbing hard against his prostate, making his muscles jump and a soft whine escape his throat.
It seemed like forever ago that they had found each other through SHEILD’s meddling. Steve didn’t miss the constant anxiety that went along with always feeling lacking, as though he would be abandoned at any moment. Tony had been relentless and incredibly patient, forcing Steve to accept that his affections were true, as well as give into the needs of his own body.
“Yeah. I get it.” Tony pressed a soft kiss to his forehead. “I’ll take care of you. You don’t have to worry about anything now. I’ve got you.”
The websites Natasha sent him to were informative. They also had Steve turning ten different shades of red in the privacy of his bedroom. Apparently people were a lot more open about their sexuality than they had been in the forties. A lot more. And at least Steve had names for the things Tony had used on him and done to him.
"Don't worry. You'll get yours soon enough." He pulled back with a final lick, smiling wickedly as Steve whimpered from the loss of contact. "I was just going to take off your cage. You want that, right?"
Tony smiled at him, making his heart flip over in his chest. As soon as he was released from the restraints, he collapsed off the machine, landing at Tony’s feet. Strong arms lifted him, carrying him into the bedroom, laying him out on the bed. He watched hungrily as his alpha stripped, prowling up the bed and over his body. Steve arched into it when he felt the head of Tony’s cock rub against his sensitive rim, moaning as he pressed inside where he belonged. The smooth glide of flesh felt better filling him than any toy ever could.
“Al-alpha…!” Steve was trembling, coming apart in his arms, balanced on the edge of another powerful release. He’d lost count of how many he’d already experienced. A single word stopped him in his tracks.
"That's what I like to hear." Slick fingers trailed down Steve's cock and over his balls drawing a soft gasp before rubbing gentle circles over his hole, not breaching, but working the muscles until they softened under his touch. "So sensitive for me. I love that. The things I can make you feel..."
He struggled with his uniform, trying to pull it off as fast as possible, not stopping until it was a heap on the floor.
Tony led them down the hall to the doorways of their rooms before reluctantly letting go of his hand. “You can stay in here. This is my room right next door. If you need anything…” Tony paused, uncertain of how much trust he was willing to extend to this man, then shook his head. This wasn’t Rogers. This was Steve. Soft, submissive, eager to please Steve. “If you need anything, you can come wake me up.”
When he managed to focus on the alpha, Tony was leaning forward in the chair, remote still in hand, the other stripping over his cock. He let the knot expand until Steve was completely gone. Even the slightest twitch send him careening into another release, body sore and aching, his passage unable to stop milking around the cock buried unbearably deep inside of him. At some point, Tony came, spilling across his fingers and onto the floor. The sight made Steve shudder, pulling at his rim, grinding the knot into his omega gland and pushing him over again. When it did finally stop, the knot retracting, the cock shrinking to it’s former size, Steve was exhausted.
"So why don't you tell me what you would like. As a reward. Anything you want. Tell me how you want to come, baby."
“Who the hell are you?” The words burst free before he had a chance to stop them. The man was tall and willowy, with deep auburn hair and dark sunglasses covering his eyes. He was wearing nothing but a pair of jeans so worn they looked like they could fall to pieces at any moment.
Tony let his gaze sweep over the unblemished expanse, looking for the swollen area beneath his ear that he’d felt earlier. That had made Steve whimper and squirm beneath his touch. He pressed his lips against the spot, felt the heat radiating from it. Smelled his scent. Vanilla and honey. It wrapped around Tony, building him into a frenzy. He wanted this man to be his. Only his.
Steve gasped, the air punched out of him at the words. His situation could actually get worse. This was worse. The man that he secretly lusted after in his most private fantasies, who’s scent could make him burn with desire for days, was being forced to take him. In a lifetime of unfair situations, this one was at the top of Steve’s list. “I can’t… I just can’t…”
“Yeah.” Bruce sat down on a stool and readied his supplies. When Tony removed the large plug, he slid a speculum inside Steve’s entrance, stretching him open and locking it into place. Steve whimpered, pulling at the restraints as Bruce rubbed and prodded the hard nubs of his glands. “Yeah, this is what we normally see as a result of this type of abuse. There should be more elasticity here, to accommodate an alpha’s knot.” Tony leaned over his shoulder for a better view as Bruce pointed to the different areas. “You can see where the slick glands are impacted. It’ll take some work to get them to start producing properly. I’m assuming you had to use lube to mount him?”
With a small smile, Steve went over and sat down on the loveseat next to Tony. Almost immediately the other man was curling up against his side, shoving a giant bowl of popcorn onto his lap, and rambling a mile a minute about how this was one of the greatest early sci-fi movies, and he was going to love it. Steve shifted slightly as his cock tried to harden at the proximity of the chatty genius and was suppressed. If there was another bonus to wearing a cage, it was that his body wouldn’t be able to betray him around Tony.
The fingers finally retreated. Steve closed his eyes, hoping they were finished. That he had been deemed unworthy by the alpha who had selected him. But he knew he was lying to himself. The sounds of a belt and zipper seemed especially loud in the quiet of the room. He felt the head of the alpha’s cock press against his throbbing hole. “No! I told you, I don’t want this!”
When he leaned back slightly in Tony’s arms, he felt his regular plug shift inside of him. His gland was no longer numb, throbbing madly from the pressure of metal against it. He cried out, grip tightening on the other man’s shirt, pulling him closer.
Tony tangled his fingers in Steve’s hair, gently pulling his head back. He kissed him. Softly at first, then more demanding, tongue sweeping into his mouth, claiming the space as his own. Steve clung to him, trembling so hard he could barely stay upright, whimpering into his mouth. He finally pulled back, leaving Steve gasping for breath.
Steve woke up warm and comfortable, still pressed against Tony's body. As he blinked his eyes open, the night before came back to him in vivid detail. The display at the gala just for his benefit. How right it had felt to put Tony's pleasure before his own, the other man's joy in taking him apart, and how sweetly he'd cared for him afterward. The mumbled words as Tony had fallen asleep. Tony loved him.
Bruce picked up his bag and left the room, closing the door softly behind him. Tony took his place on the small stool, giving himself access to both Steve’s cock and his hole. He opened the stirrups wider, spreading Steve’s thighs to give him less room to struggle.  The omega was crying beneath him, hiccupy sobs as he begged Tony not to do this to him. Resolutely, Tony opened the vial, allowing some of the liquid to drip onto both hands. He began rubbing it into Steve’s cock, paying especial attention to the sensitive head. The pleasure sounds slipping from his omega’s plush lips as he played with him made Tony’s cock throb in it’s confines, aching to be buried deep inside of him. Later, he promised himself, before returning to the task at hand.
