Steve met Bucky's gaze and couldn't help the smile. He simply nodded in response.
Bruce made Bucky promise not to move until he returned and went in search of a wheelchair. Ten minutes later, Bucky was being wheeled across the room. Bruce lowered the rail on Steve's left side so Bucky could reach him.
"I just hope we're not too late," Steve whispered to the empty room.
- Tony is in his twenties.
sustain have already been healed by the serum."
Sorry you had to wait for this chapter. I know it's shorter, but I've been wanting to get this out despite my currently crazy schedule. I didn't want you to think I wasn't coming back :)
"No, I can handle it. I'll let you know if I find anything though." Howard grasped Tony's face and turned him to meet his gaze. "Want to tell me what else is bothering you?"
Once clean, Tony snagged a towel off the warming rack and proceeded to gently dry Steve.
"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this ..." Tony sucked in a deep breath and fixed his gaze on his Iron Man armor across the room.
"How are they, Bruce." Tony looked through the glass in the door to peer at their two guests before leaning against the wall. Barnes had been awake for six days now, but Rogers had yet to show signs of waking. A fact which bothered Tony more than he would admit.
The traffic light changed to red and Tony used the chance to look at Steve. He saw the slight blush on Steve’s face.
“You said, you’ve been expecting us? Why?” It was Tony who broke the silence.
Steve put his shield back on his back and started climbing the ladders to get to the hostages. The large machines in the hall covered his progress, but also left him without a view on the battle. He didn’t like not knowing what happened on the battle field all the time, and what he gathered from Tony’s commentary of the battle didn’t reduce his worry. Apparently those tentacles proved to be very difficult to take care of, so Steve was relieved when he could catch a glimpse of Tony cutting one off with some kind of laser.
“Really, it’s that easy. Walk to the door, knock, and lay them on his desk.”
"Oh."
“No, but I expected something with a little more finesse and secrecy. You are said to be tactical mastermind.”
“Okay, Dummy start the coffee. Friday give me project ‘Cap DB’ on the screen.”
“Yeah, I believe you in my head, but I still need to do this.”
“The swooning.”
“You are the one looking for plausible and realistic. I would just shove them in there.”
Steve raised an eyebrow at him.
“It seems we are in luck,” Tony whispered.
“So, is this going to be awkward and in the end we will be avoiding each other and be terribly polite. Or …”
She snorted at the disbelief in his voice, but wasn’t surprised by it. Too often had he painted himself as god’s gift to women, thought that his money and his connections made him interesting and attractive. Almost never listened to her, regardless what topic. If she was lucky she received a condescending explanation why she was wrong. Whatever it had been that she found attractive once, right now she just wanted to leave.
“You okay?”
“You are wrong, it was my fault. I should have …”
"Can I come in?" Steve Rogers asked, in his hand a lovely bouquet of sunflowers.
“We are not.” Ori said.  “Just watch one interview with them. My grand-parents also have those stupid smiles when they talk about each other but they have been married for 50 years. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are totally gone for each other. I bet you.”
What he saw made his heart stop. Three tentacles had winded themselves around Tony and he could see Tony struggling in the armor, but he couldn’t move. Steve still heard him through the com, but that was just more or less heavy breathing with heavy cursing. With horror he watched another tentacle approaching the armor holding again a gun. It looked different than the guns they had been greeted with and a moment later he knew why it was different. It was an EMP gun and Steve saw the arc reactor flickering out and the sudden lack of noise in his ear was terrifying.
Smiling Zola went into her office and called Jamie.
“Thank you,” he whispered.
While they waited, Steve used the opportunity to snuggle up to him.
“Me, in the wilderness, without Wi-Fi, been there, done that, won’t buy the shirt.”
“Zola had to finish something.” Jamie complained. “You know, that she is never on time.”
They arrived at a Brownstone in Brooklyn of all places, no trace of the glass and steel that made Stark Tower so distinctively modern. Instead this house looked like the homes of Steve’s childhood and his artistic eye collected the wrought-iron window boxes, the carefully crafted decorations on the plaster while they waited for the garage door to open. Just as he was about to comment on the lack of high tech so far, the seemingly ordinary wall in front of them turned into a window wall to Tony’s workshop. It was not as spacious as the tower’s or what he imagined the Malibu house’s workshop must have been, but the tech he saw right in front of him looked still right out of one of those science fiction movies he had watched in the last few months.
“How could I not recognize my own code?” That was not what Steve had meant, he had felt more betrayed on Tony’s behalf that someone would do this to him, but before he could find the words to explain it to him, Tony already continued his explanation.
"Why?"
He shied back from following this thought to its end, knowing too well that he would probably return immediately into hiding if he thought too much about it. Instead he concentrated on the board with their selection of coffees although as always he ordered a simple black coffee. It was still early, but the morning crowd was already on its caffeine hunt. Luckily for him most of them ordered their coffee to go so he easily found a free table.
“The rescuing.”
“When he was so heavily opposed why is he still on the board.”
“You did. I can’t believe you did that. Can I say that I feel strangely proud?”
Ah, yes, he had never understood her sarcasm. Not her problem anymore.
And it was the ‘please’ that did it because Tony Stark didn’t beg like that, not in this serious tone. He took a deep breath, the air shakily leaving his lungs, and he did it again until he felt able to withdraw from the warmth of Tony’s hands, stable enough to take a step back. He could still feel Tony’s fingers on his face, wanted to take a step forward, but instead forced himself to stay still.
Tony gave the keyboard a final tap and the long lines of code disappeared from the screen and instead a picture appeared.
“Or as if you didn’t have any access to any Iron Man suits.”
Tony turned around with a start.
“Well, you can keep me company while I wait. Friday does most of the digital footwork; the only thing for me to do is checking the sub-routines and giving her new search ideas. And I’d say you can certainly help with the latter.”
But apparently it had been enough for Ori to recover.
“Captain Rogers was cold and asked for heating, Sir.”
Her head flew up. He looked at her with an intense gaze.
“Or is this something we will be regularly doing?” The words were rushed, tumbled almost together, but Steve understood the question loud and clear.
The roof was a clustered mess of chains and concrete blocks, three cranes and a cable winch as remains from when the hall still had been in function. There was not much cover so when the first tentacle came after him he took the hook from the cable winch and pierced it through the tentacle before releasing it. Tacle was dragged to the side of the building before he released the tentacle.
Before Steve could make up his mind Friday announced an incoming call.
“I really don’t understand what just happened,” Tony said.
“Do you think we should tell the others?”
“The pram was pushed in your way,” Tony said calmly and how could he say something so horrible so calmly. It took a moment for those words to really come through the cloud of self-hate.
“You are the boss – and we are there.”
“Yes, I have seen them.”
"I mean Natasha Romanov, Black Widow."
For a moment Tony wondered if he should press for more details, but then he had a better idea.
“I had enemies at least since I got the shield,” Steve argued.
When Steve woke up, he noticed three things. First, it was already morning, the early morning sun already lighting up the bedroom. Second, he felt slightly better, but this could also simply be caused by the third thing. He lay curled around Tony who was massaging his scalp carefully.
Steve blushed.
“What can I say? I try to keep a low profile,” Tony joked.
“No, you don’t want to know,” Tony confirmed.
Rhys looked up, her fingers tensing in the stuffed animal, her knuckles turning white.
"Yes it is," he argued.
“Cap!”
“The code in those StarkPhones and StarkPads is definitely not based on Ultron. The phones have a learning structure that adapts the phone’s privacy settings to its user’s needs. It can’t develop any further, there are several security measurements in place to avoid exactly this scenario. However, this was a special version developed for people who have a higher need of privacy like the president of the United States. The version we try to sell only uses a simplified code that doesn’t change.”
It was a delicious torture, slowly and delicate, but with enough variation to keep Steve right there on the edge. What little coordination he had left, he concentrated on getting Tony naked or at least touching his skin. He managed to rip his shirt, so that he had access to Tony’s collarbone and let his head drop on his shoulder, inhaling Tony’s scent and pressing open mouthed kisses to his skin. His fingers dug into Tony’s hips when a particularly delicious stroke brought Steve nearer to completion.
“I just wanted to go home.”
“What about you?” Steve looked at Tony. “Dr. Banner said lots of snuggles and Dr. Parker agrees. Do you want to act against medical advice?”
“As I understand it, the new StarkPad is based on the special edition of the StarkPhone we received for testing purposes last year?”
Steve felt Tony moving next to him and immediately put his arm around him.
“What do you mean, he’s taken?” Zola hadn’t heard anything like that. Although admittedly she was usually pretty late on picking up gossip.
'How on earth did Natasha Romanov know her favorite flowers?', she wondered. Apparently too long, since Rogers offered an explanation.
The first contact of Tony’s fingers around his cock let him shiver helplessly. He could sense the satisfied smirk on Tony’s lips but Tony’s thumb sliding over the tip and spreading the precum derailed the slight trace of irritation. Instead he tried clumsily to claim Tony’s lips again. Tony met his lips eagerly, but never letting go of his cock.
“Yeah, but they camped on the front lawn, figuratively speaking, they didn’t have anonymous sources.”
“You are messing with me,” Zola accused them.
“Unfortunately the GoFundme account was set up in the ‘mother’s' name, so there is no lead. At the moment I look into disappearances or natural deaths of babies in the greater New York area for this time frame and let me tell you that this is a depressing research. So far I turned up nothing. I’m also looking in everybody publicly demanding the Avengers to stop or pubicly supporting them.”
“Yes. I know a few things about guilt. And we are team mates. Or were, you know, whatever.”
“We probably should take this as a working theory. Okay, let’s head back to workshop. Until we come up with something, we won’t know for sure. Hopefully it won’t take long until we find something.”
“Wait is this the reason why you didn’t answer my texts yesterday? I’m revoking your best friend rights.”
Tony threw him a look and a small grin.
“How …?”
“It was an apology?” She offered.
“Yes, Mr. Stark.”
“That would be all, Ms. Robinson. I’ll be back in an hour or two.”
“I’m not the one with the Asgardian flu.”
Steve ignored him. “Several entrances, three levels including a basement, one large hall for machinery as I see it. Not the best place for an attack if we are only two.”
Steve tried to lift his head to look at Tony, but was held in place by Tony’s hand in his hair.
He saw himself mid-moving, cowl in place, shield in full swing and the pram right in its way. He watched the impact, the immediate destruction of the pram, the small body flying in the air. He could hear the swoosh of his shield, heard the scream of the mother, his own harsh breathing until the body hit the ground and it didn’t make a sound but all the noises stopped and everything seemed frozen in place.
“How is the patient?”
The lifeless tentacle sprung back to life and grabbed Steve and dragged him slowly over the edge. Steve tried to get up, to resist the movement but the tentacle kept him immobilized and Steve only managed to grab the corner of the roof to keep himself from falling, his finger nails drilling in the concrete. He tried to wrestle out of the arm, but he could feel himself losing his grip.
This chapter describes the death of a child, not explicitly but probably enough for anybody who is triggered by this.
“Don’t let Natasha hear you calling her a damsel in distress,” Tony grinned. “She would show you distress and you’ve kind of grown on me.”
“Hello, my dear Captain. It’s so nice to hear from you. I thought you would stay in the woods, but I guess you heroes must always do some rescuing.” Tony had never before heard the Avengers’ work described so contemptuously and that did include anything Fox News said about them.
“Do you have some paper and pencils?” Tony asked.
“Where have you been yesterday? You didn’t answer my texts.”
“Yes, but the only thing we have right now is someone targeting you specifically. Everything else could be coincidence,” he still argued.
Tacle pressed some kind of panel on his arm and the three tentacles holding Tony were released and falling down on the ground with a shattering noise, taking the lifeless armor with them. It was horrible, so, so horrible and for a moment Steve wanted to go down, wanted to check on Tony and it was Tacle starting to climb on the machines to get up to him, that spurred him into motion.
"Oh,“ he deflated. "I need to get those to Mr. Stark.“
“I’ve kind of grown on you,” Steve raised an eyebrow when Tony, now fully naked, made his way into the bed, pushing the sheets aside and crawling directly over him.
“You are leaving me for him?” He finally spoke again.
“They have one year being an Avenger under their belt, and it’s not as if you left your shield at the cabin in the woods.”
“Can I help you?”
Tony threw another glance in Steve’s direction, apparently checking his reaction.
“I’m just …“ She pointed to the door, but before she could make her escape, Mr. Stark hold her back.
Yeah, Tony knew this, too. All his instincts were telling him so, but he tried to be more careful about his instincts and better check everything twice. Still, the niggling feeling in his head was hard to calm down
“Oh, it’s you “, she just acknowledged her friend and looked back at the screen. “Sorry, I still need a moment, I got to finish this.”
Tony turned back to him.
The last kiss ended on his mouth and Steve’s heart sang. They hadn’t said ‘I loves you’ in the three months of their relationship but sometimes Tony would say things like this and kiss him so earnestly that made him sure those words weren’t that far away.
Tony loved it too. So, Steve kept it there on the tip of his tongue for the occasions where he was getting close with Tony.
Bucky ducked into Steve's private tent, glad for the chance to speak with his best friend. He, and the rest of the 107th, were required to be cleared by medical, and by the time they were done, Steve was nowhere to be found. He finally spotted Steve ducking into a tent a few minutes ago. "Hey, Stevie. Where'd you disappear to? The guys wanted ..."
"It's been a while since you've come over for dinner. I know your mother would love for you to join us tonight."
"Don't' worry, Stevie." Bucky grasped the back of Steve's neck and squeezed. "I'm going to take care of you."
Tony stepped out from the spray of hot water and began to towel himself dry. "They think I don't know what they're up to, but Dad must have noticed I'm not totally balanced. He and Mom tend to invite me over for pizza just so Mom can pull me out of my head for a bit."
"Have I told you today that I love you." Steve pressed a kiss to Tony's hair.
"Of course. And might I inquire, are you going to present the Captian with his gift tonight?"
"Where?" Tony flew above the compound taking out the last of the stragglers while JARVIS brought up the blueprints for the compound.
"Which is why ..." Tony rolled to his side of the bed and fished in the drawer until his hand landed on the little box he placed there earlier. "I want to ask you something."
"I have narrowed down their location to one of three places. They are continually bouncing the signal which has delayed pinpointing the origin." Jarvis explained.
The Avengers congratulated the couple. All but Bucky had observed the relationship from the start and none were surprised at the development.
"So good. Tony. So perfect. So tight. Not gonna last long this time." Steve murmured in Tony's ear.
Steve began to protest but was silenced with Phillips' raised hand.
Tony couldn't help but touch his own grey space which was beginning to show a faint shape at the thought.
"Looks like something ripped the whole limb off," Bruce muttered as he helped strap the two men to the gurney to get them topside. "If he's still alive, we're probably going to have to amputate what's left of the arm."
Steve considered the question as he stared out the wall of windows at the New York skyline. "I think I'm going to go to the art room and grab a sketchbook before heading to the den in my room."
"Our boy hasn't been taking care of himself has he?" Maria was fully aware of the fact both men in her life tended to neglect their own needs when working on important projects.
"If you'll allow me," Jarvis spoke up. "Access to the living quarters is restricted. One must pass security measures in place at the building's entrance, a security check, and biometric scans at the elevators. Only those with permission may access the residential floors, communal floor, and the communal gym. Each floor contains a foyer so one does not step straight into the apartments. At each apartment door, there is a handprint scanner, as well as voice recognition. Individuals may customize their security protocols with me. Information is kept on a secure server which only I can access. I am only authorized to grant access in the case of an emergency."
"Because what happened wasn't your fault. Why would he blame you for something out of your control?"
"You better!" Tony fiddled with the stones laid out on his worktable, searching for the perfect combination.
"Hold on just a minute. Are you telling me you pulled me out of sex with Steve for a suspicion?" Tony crossed his arms in frustration.
"Yes, Sir. Will there be anything else?"
"They gotta be here somewhere," Bucky muttered when they found yet another empty room.
Bucky ran his fingertips down the length of the arm, noting every detail. "This is incredible."
"Yes, Captain?" Jarvis kept his volume low so as not to disturb the second occupant of the room.
"Yeah, so?"
"I'm fine. It's just ... Steve would have been spared so much pain if this had been on his wrist when he was in the Army."
As time progressed, Steve found himself grateful Henderson's quarters were on the very edge of the camp, and that Henderson chose to gag him for the duration of their time together. Otherwise, the whole camp would have heard his screams.
"Why did they disappear? Did they know we were coming? Was it the plan all along? Not to mention the unanswered questions of what they were doing with the women."
"Jarvis, is there anything to watch on television?"
Sexy times ahead.
Steve stepped forward and placed his hand on the panel after only a slight hesitation.
"Stark?" Bucky's heart sped up at the name.
"No."
"Few hours ago." Bucky sidled up to Natasha, wrapped an arm around her waist, and kissed her temple.
Sighing, Steve grasped the offered hand and was pulled to his feet.
Bucky watched Steve as he slept. What had once been a peaceful sleep turned anything but in the last hour.
"Go on, Steve. Your turn."
Bucky snagged the garments from the foot of his bed and headed for the en-suite bathroom. He paused in the doorway and looked back, "Thank you, Bruce."
"Hold up, Stevie. There is still something we need to chat about before we go." Bucky settled on the edge of Steve's bed, and patted the mattress to encourage Steve to join him.
"I'll tell your mother to expect you at seven then?"
"No. Although, I do need to find out when the procedure is going to be." Bucky drew in a deep breath. "What I wanted to tell you is where exactly we will be staying."
"Do you think you're levels are back to where they need to be?"
Tony glared at the roof, "Sassing me again? Did Dad get ahold of your programing again?"
Howard consulted his schedule before answering. "I should be out of my board meeting by then."
"I'm gonna catch some shut-eye. You should too."
"Don't worry, Tony. I won't mention this to anyone, and if he asks about it I'll let him know I took care of it and leave it at that."
"Yeah," Tony began to dress in his favorite soft jeans and a graphic t-shirt.
Drawing in a deep breath, and releasing it slowly, Steve nodded, "You're right."
"Well, I guess that means we're done for the day. My office will be in touch to coordinate the surgery."
(See the end of the chapter for
Once in the kitchen, Steve contemplated the shiny appliance for a long moment before deciding to wash the few dishes in the sink, it was familiar and he could easily figure out how to work it, unlike the machine. Once everything was clean and returned to its rightful place, Steve headed to the massive bathroom off his bedroom.
"Yeah." Tony set his tools aside as the lock clicked open. "That's what I'm afraid of."
"My best guess? They couldn't stomach the fact that submissive took to the serum, came out like this, and is the only supersoldier out there. They probably didn't want subs to think they could gain power over Doms so changed his designation."
"It's really not that surprising. The landscape is changing all the time. You know, we don't really have the equipment for a job like this."
"Yeah. With the medical equipment we found, there is no way they were just doing medical checkups before selling the women." Steve blew out a long breath. "I guess all we can do is wait until Natasha finds what they have on the computer."
"Well, Howard Stark had a son, Howard Stark Jr. Who also had a son, Tony." Bruce passed Bucky the water cup again, pleased to see he could hold it on his own. Although, probably not for long until he regained more strength. "Tony is the one who dug you guys out of the ice and brought you here."
Steve swallowed hard as they approached the base. He wasn't looking forward to debrief, or what would come after.
"Yeah, sure." Bucky moved further into the room and noticed the open case on the table. His eyes widened in shock. "Is this it?"
"Good. Light." Steve blinked up at Bucky, his eyes wanting to close again.
"Henderson, meet Steve Rogers. I need you to punish him for disobeying orders and being reckless. Also, make sure he goes down for a while. I can't have an unstable supersoldier Sub walking around my base."
"You going to cum for me, Tony?" Steve kissed Tony's shoulder as he neared his own orgasm.
"Humor me?"
"Fuck no." Tony groaned in frustration. "Jarvis?"
"He was wearing this in the ice?"
"That's what we've got him for." Coulson pointed over his shoulder at Tony.
"On it." Tony taped out a couple of commands on his watch and the drone appeared from the depths of the plane. "Also, Jarvis says the explosives are not a threat. They'll need to be removed and disposed of, but they won't accidentally explode on us."
"Those are solid metal." Bruce observed. "There is no way that is comfortable."
Soulmarks consist of an image or shape on the left wrist, and the soulmates name along the inside of their left forearm. They start as a grey spot on the wrist which slowly turns into their soulmark. The names only appear after the mark has taken shape.
"I wouldn't suggest moving if I were you," Henderson stated as Steve felt a pressure at his slit.
"Not your fault ..." Steve sighed before squaring his shoulders as Phillips came into view and clearly spotted them. "Here we go."
"It is proven that time with one's parents does help balance hormones."
"First, call me Bucky. And second, I'm going over there with or without your help. So unless you want me injuring myself further, I suggest you help me."
"Get a life, kid." Tony threw open his door and jumped down to the snow-covered ice, pulling his thick coat tighter around him.
"Romanov, Barton, good to see you again." Tony greeted the two SHIELD agents as he came to stand between the pilot and co-pilot seats, placing a hand on the back of each. "Let's go see what they've found, shall we?"
The world and its problems melted away as the two came together.
"Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting."
"North side of the basement. There's a tunnel heading further north." Clint began to walk.
Bucky sucked in a quick breath. "They dropped you, didn't they. Those fucking bastards. Dropped you and didn't bring you back up."
"Well, you found me. Now let's go." Tony strode for the elevator. He did feel a
"Wonderful."
"Yeah, sure."
"Our search party found the wing of the plane sticking out of the ice in the Arctic. They're working on a way in now."
"They're alive?" Clint's brows shot up in surprise.
"Find something?" Coulson approached, looking down at Tony's feet.
"I don't think you quite understand. You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane."
Howard couldn't help the smile. "Well, my soulmark began to take shape the first time I met your mother. It took two months and five days for the mark to finish developing, and your mother's name appeared the next day."
"Why would the records say he is a Dom, if he's not?"
"Coming right up." Stark moved to the discarded package and opened the box, placing it on the floor beside Henderson.
Reluctant to leave Steve, but sure he needed at least a sponge bath, Bucky agreed. "Any chance I can shower?"
"My soulmate." Steve's gaze met Bucky's. "What do you think they'll be like?"
Tony drew in a deep breath, plastered on his trademark smile, and strode forward to shake Bucky's hand. "Good to meet you, Bucky. Shall we get started?"
"Yes, Sir." Steve dipped his head lower, the weight of almost losing Bucky almost too much to bear. He could still hear Bucky's screams, see him hanging on with one hand every time he closed his eyes.
"We can worry about that once we get back. We need to load up and get out of here. Can we start warming them on the jet?" Coulson asked as he followed the crew carrying the stretcher.
"Right. Close up shop."
Bucky looked around Steve's sparse tent. The dwelling held a single bed, a desk and chair, and a small trunk. He would need to get some supplies but didn't think he could leave Steve. But first, he needed to assess the damage. "Steve, I need to see."
"Yeah, I know." Steve sighed. "Didn't want to ruin the evening last night, and he was so happy this morning."
"You're delivery from Wakanda has arrived. Happy is putting it in your lab." Pepper looked up to meet Tony's gaze. "Would you like to tell me what King T'Challa is mailing you?"
"What is it?" Bruce, being neither a Dom or a sub, had never seen the device before.
"Then leave it urgently," Tony instructed as the doors to his private elevator opened to reveal Coulson had already made his way into the tower.
Once inside, Tony headed straight for the kitchen where he deposited the folders on the counter. He then ensured the fridge was fully stocked before peeking in both bedrooms to ensure the beds had been made and the bathrooms contained fresh towels. Only after a thorough inspection of each room did he allow Jarvis to take him to his floor.
"Rogers, you went against my orders, commandeered a plane, jumped into a hot zone, and attacked a heavily fortified enemy base. You put a civilian in danger and jeopardized the well being of America's most expensive science experiment with your stunt. Therefore, I have arranged for our strongest Dom on base to see to your punishment."
"I didn't even know Pops got his hands on any of that," Howard muttered as he went in search of the tools they would need to separate the metal from the leather.
"Thanks." Steve wrapped his right arm around Tony's waist and kissed his forehead.
"Need anything else, we'll be right outside." Gabe offered Bucky a small smile before leaving, ensuring the tent flaps were securely closed behind him.
"I know." Tony accepted Steve's hand and they both stood. "Kinda the point."
Bucky reluctantly pulled his gaze from the case. "Yeah."
"I'm not sure drawing blood is such a great idea." Steve was always cautious around those who wanted to study his blood due to the serum. It wouldn't do for it to get into the wrong hands.
"My pleasure." Stark slicked up one hand with a small bead of the lube and immediately pressed two fingers into Steve's tight hole.
"I don't know what you're talking about." The last thing Steve wanted to do was dwell on bad memories.
"Well, hopefully, you don't ever have to worry about that. I'm going to be here for you as long as I live. I can promise you that I will never willingly leave you. I will always stand by your side. I will always protect your back. If something happens, I will always come for you." Tony lifted up to his elbow. "I love you, Steven Grant Rogers. More than I ever imagined I could love another person. You make me better. You love me, encourage me, tell me off when I'm being an ass ... and the way you look at me. It's as if I'm the only thing in the universe that matters to you. No one has ever looked at me the way you do."
"You're a pretty rich boy who broke all his toys," Steve glared. "Like you're
"How is it that I can lose soldiers, good men, with families and morals and sweethearts back home, and then you…unattached son of a bitch that you are…can't manage to die?" Steve shoved Tony against the wall.
"Tony, I've been here the whole time." Blue eyes narrowed. "How tired are you? How much have you been drinking this evening?"
"You don't care, so why ask?" Steve rolled his eyes, the alcohol making his face flushed; it began making him mean.
Steve resisted the urge to touch himself, and instead willed his erection away. He needed to apologize to Tony. Only apologize, despite how tempting it would be to…nope, just apologizing.
"Hey, Cap!" Tony called out. The super soldier paused, but he didn't turn around.
"You are so flippant!" Steve growled, standing up. "I'm so fucking tired of your attitude!"
Tony snickered. "Good poison."
"Well…thanks; it's not the worst thing someone has done to me."
"Yeah, uh, good night," Steve went to turn around, but he stopped himself. "I would have done it, you know."
Steve grabbed the glass, pressed it to his lips, slung his head back, and drained the glass. He placed it back on the table, still appearing miserable.
"Um, you're welcome, I guess," Steve shuffled awkwardly.
"Cap?" Tony's eyebrows rose. Oh, the liquor was a bad idea. Cap was an angry drunk, he took a mental note.
"Done what?"
"Umm, Tony?"
"Excuse me?" Steve's lips were pulled back over his teeth, showing off the brilliant white.
He stood under the hot stream as he remembered Tony, just before he left. His voice, the low hum, "Fuck you." Normally he found language like that crass, though coming from the military he had heard it often enough. He had used it enough himself. But coming from Tony, in the context…he felt himself grow hard as shivers raked through his body. The memory of how close they had been, warm body pressed to warm body, their breaths, both smelling of Woodford, mingling in the limited space between them, made him regret not taking the playboy right then and there. Against the wall, on the floor, on top of the table- anywhere would have done the trick.
Tony walked into one of the multiple kitchens of Stark Tower. He opened the fridge, scanned the contents for a moment, and then proceeded to pile his arms full of food. At this point he wasn't picky; he hadn't eaten in days, instead choosing to lock himself down in the work shop. He hadn't accomplished much, but he found that solitude was better than subjecting himself to the outside world.
“I’m just rather curious,” Steve shrugged and smiled in Tony’s direction. “And I’m not going to try to pry it out of you or Rhodey, so don’t worry about that.”
Steve smiled a little in his tiredness before he stepped over to help with the bags. He was carrying almost double what I had in my arms, but I didn’t care. He could very well carry all of them if he wanted. I’m sure he was just trying to help my ego. How sweet.
But then again…
“Great idea, honey,” Tony exclaimed with a grin before the pair finally got out the car.
Jarvis woke me up not a second past four-thirty that following morning, but that didn’t mean I got out of bed at that time. I like giving myself a couple minutes of lying in the bed to wake up. What can I say? It’s relaxing for the morning.
“You goddamn idiot,” Steve strained as he cupped Tony’s cheek. “I tried-tried to keep you away. Because of this.”
me. I don’t like it, but I do have to say I’m impressed.
Steve’s stomach churned unpleasantly.
Tony gave it a look over before he set it on the floor next to his left foot. He couldn’t call.
He wasn’t expecting that to happen, not really. Sure, he knew Loki would spill some things regarding the loop, but he didn’t think Loki would take it that far.
“You are the genius.” Steve pressed one last kiss to Tony’s head before he let himself drift off to sleep.
“Turn the music back on!” Clint yelled from somewhere nearby with a cheeky grin.
. That couldn’t be right though. Right?
A grin spread across Tony’s face. “In that case, you should kiss me again,” He suggested with a twinkle in his eyes.
Steve came over to the table after a couple minutes, sliding into the booth as he set our tray on the table. “I didn’t know which lemonade you wanted so I just got regular to be safe,” He told me before his eyes widened. “Did you know they have just about every flavor of soda in that machine? It’s incredible.”
“I honestly have no idea what could cause that,” Tony admitted with a sigh. “At least, nothing done by humans. I could try looking at your brainwaves and neurons to find any abnormal activity. Do you know any magical being that would want to do this to you?”
He wanted us paired together? That can’t be right.
“No,” Tony’s brows furrowed. “Well, your brainwaves and neurons are all normal. That’s good. But that also means it has to be some outside force doing this to you, and that’s a lot harder to trace. Especially if we only have today. Or I only have today since I can’t remember.”
He wanted to enjoy this moment without thinking of the loop, but the negative thoughts slipped in anyways. Once asleep, he would wake up in his bed for yet another Thursday. For all Tony would know, none of this would have happened. It would just be any other ordinary day.
Rhodey held his hands up defensively before he started to back up. “Alright. You win,” He sighs, but I could feel there was more under his words. “You go and have a romantic getaway with Captain America.”
Steve looked at me with worry as he put his hand on my shoulder. “Tony, nothing happened. I just parked the car is all,” He explained with a gentle voice, probably so he wouldn’t spook me more than I seem to be.
“They are better,” He decided with a small nod, a thoughtful expression on his face. “They’re faster, safer, and a shit ton comfier. That is until you sit in them for hours at a time,” He chuckled to himself then proceeded to drive us back to the interstate. “Having Jarvis give directions will be a huge help too.”
“I can’t find him. I can’t—God, how are you supposed to find a trickster who could be anyone? Or anything?” Steve sat down on one of the benches and put his head in his hands. “I’ve tried to get your help on this, and Thor’s, and anyone who can help. For the past month of Thursdays since we realized it was Loki. But I haven’t even truly came close,” Steve tugged at the ends of his hair. “And Loki knows so now he—” He laughs bitterly. “Now he’s
“Yes, because I just go and get myself killed on purpose,” Tony replied sarcastically with a grin, though it dropped when he saw Steve’s sober expression. “Did that happen before in the, uhm, loop?” He scratched the back of his neck.
It wasn’t like Steve could escape to anywhere either. Tony could travel faster than a motorcycle with his suit – even if Steve’s motorcycle could go faster than others thanks to Tony himself. The suit, or Jarvis, could scan for his face in a crowd or whatever technological way that Steve doesn’t quite have the grasp of.
That caught Steve’s attention. He knew Tony – in this moment – didn’t mean it with any sexual innuendos, but Steve realized that maybe that’s what he needed. A release. Something to ease him until his next breaking point.
Steve sucked in a breath as one second came, and Tony couldn’t help but do the same.
“Anyways,” Steve spoke to get back on track. He wasn’t much for the small talk with me. “It’s very possible that he could be copying after your work and would easily recognize you, so I thought we could disguise the trip as one to get away from the superhero lives. Like a vacation without internet and normal contact.”
It was weird. Steve and I were bantering with each other and not arguing for once. Maybe it really was because we were on a “vacation” and we were loosening up. Either way, I’m not really complaining. I would rather get along with the guy just like everyone else than to bicker over everything.
Steve just sighed. “Tony—”
Tony rolled his eyes fondly. “Try not to sound so cocky, Rogers.”
Steve waved a dismissive hand in the air. “Long story,” He chuckled, though his soft smile and gentle eyes quickly morphed into a scold as he poked Tony’s chest. “You ratted on me.”
Steve snorted as he laughed. “No. You said that out loud, Stark.”
Steve got up first that morning. He felt it would be more awkward to stay in the bed, but he knew that he had to stay to talk about this. It wasn’t something that could be avoided.
“Steve, where the fuck are you going?” Tony crossed his arms, walking until he stood in the way of the motorcycle. “I know you don’t have a mission.”
Steve only rolled his eyes at my response, pulling away as soon as the suitcase was closed. “
Tony rinsed out his mouth before he trudged his way back to the bedroom, Steve following close behind. “I’m thinking eggs and toast for breakfast tomorrow. What do you think?” Tony questioned as he pulled on a pair of boxers.
An anxiety attack.
That someone was Tony.
Steve shook his head with a light smile as he wrapped his arms around Tony and leaned back against the back of the tub. “No, Tones. You made this ungodly mess, so we will clean it up together,” He stated firmly.
It was mainly a lot of subtle flirts thrown here and there – including stolen glances over Steve’s body – and the obvious flirts thrown his way.
“So, what? I’m supposed to honestly believe that you calling me drunk means nothing?” Steve deadpanned. “I’m calling bullshit, Tony.”
“Tony?” Steve called out as he ventured farther into the suite. He stayed in the middle of the room to avoid snooping. He may be drunk, but he was still respectful.
He knocked on the door hard and fast. He didn’t care at the moment if Tony would be mad for waking him up. He only cared that Tony was alive.
“Then let’s get going then, Cap. My car is still outside.” Tony squeezed Steve’s hand comfortingly before he pulled them away from the debriefing room.
The dream didn’t get everything right, and Steve began to allow himself to destress.
Tony laughed at that. “I think it was a little bit of that and a little bit of a man crush.” He grinned then winked to Steve. “Although I can’t say I don’t blame the old man. He had good taste.”
Tony flung the door open with a tired scowl. “Steve, what the fu—” He couldn’t finish what he was saying because Steve practically tackled Tony into a bone-crushing hug that he desperately needed.
Tony grinned. “It’s quite the sight, if I do say so myself.”
“As long as you don’t get yourself killed.” Steve leaned in for one last kiss, and Tony happily obliged.
. And it was Steve’s fault.
Steve bounced his leg as he thought. “Well, Clint is with his family, so he’s vacationing in a way,” He began to list off on his fingers.
There was no disagreeing with those sweet eyes Steve was giving.
With one hand braced on the edge of either door, Tony pushed them open simultaneously. It sounded like Bruce had been pacing and decidedly stopped once the doors opened. Except, it wasn’t Bruce.
So far, the worst that’s happened to him has been the knife hitting his eye. Steve didn’t know if he could handle seeing worse. It’s like no matter what he did differently during the fight, Tony got injured in some fashion.
Tony held Steve close, smiling softly before he pressed a kiss to Steve’s temple. “Well, now that it’s Friday and you love Friday’s a lot more than Thursdays, what do you say about making us official and going out to dinner? A real date an everything at a nice restaurant. And the next day can be the beach.” He looked down and grinned to Steve. “It’ll be our last first date.”
Tony pulled away first again, but this time to speak. “Alright. What do you want to do today?” He brushed Steve’s hair back while he began to hum.
He broke off mid-sentence and stood up abruptly, causing Tony to startle up as well. “Did you just have some sort of breakthrough or remember you left an oven on or something?” He arched an eyebrow.
“You’re too much for me, you know,” Steve breathed out softly and with a gentle fondness, though that went right over Tony’s head.
Last night was too fresh in his mind.
“Stop being so damn perfect.” Tony was joking, of course. He didn’t want Steve to stop doing anything he was doing. Which is why Tony kissed Steve again, and this time his passion was directed into kissing rather than talking.
As Steve pulled his shield from off his back, he heard the faint footsteps coming from behind him. He turned, and sure enough it was the same guy from yesterday. Steve couldn’t help the annoyed grunt that came from him.
As Steve walked off, Tony stared in worry. He wanted more than anything to talk with Steve and figure out what was going on, but he knew it wasn’t time yet.
Tony had been blasted with something that emitted force and it shoved Tony’s suit into the wall with a harmful force. Just as Steve was about to do something, Tony managed to pull his arm up and fire the repulsor at the guy’s head.
“Yes,” Steve spoke quietly. “Every other Thursday you just got injured. But I guess trying to go alone means either I will die, or you will.”
Steve nodded to himself as Tony countered him. He tried to prepare himself ahead of time for any possible counterargument that Tony could have. “I didn’t agree with them, Tony. We’d be like…an army if we had signed over the Avengers. The whole point of us was to be better than what any government could offer since we have better capabilities.
to be a good part?”
Tony’s eyes rolled and he grinned. “Is that supposed to make me feel embarrassed? Abashed? Sheepish? Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Cap. I can stare at you all day and whenever I please.”
Steve gave the crowd an annoyed look before he followed after Tony. The tension between them was radiating off in waves. They didn’t speak until they got into the car, which they weren’t far away from in the first place.
Tony laid his cheek on his arm and looked back to Steve as best as he could. “What was different then? Because that’s an awful lot of similarities.”
Once he saw Sam, Steve passed him up and – as always – called out, “On your left.” He looked back over his shoulder and laughed as he received the same look he had yesterday.
“Then don’t think about it,” I snap as I look back over to Rhodey. “There’s nothing to think about from either side of this. Just leave it alone.”
Sam shot Steve a glare, but the tugs of a smile on his lips overcame the heated look. This, without a doubt, carried on until they both stopped by a tree. Sam was holding his side as he sat at the base of the trunk, yet Steve stood above with just small little pants coming from him.
A lot could go wrong apparently.
Steve looked for an opening before he threw his shield at one of the weapons – destroying it – then punched the guy in the face. He fell down, and Steve fought with another before he was on the ground next to the other guy.
Steve was radiating pure anger, and the fact that Steve was acting so calm at the same time was blood-curdling. Tony met up at Steve’s side, his suit on but his faceplate open.
Steve went to say something back again once I started to talk, but then it clamped shut at the end of it. I guess he didn’t want to comment on it in some old, conservative opinion and then us argue this late.
So, when Fury knocked on my office door and told me I had to go undercover with Steve on a mission – well, one could imagine my dismay.
“You always think of everything,” Steve spoke with fondness before he pulled Tony into another heated kiss as they together stumbled across the floor to the couch.
Steve just sat back as he opened his third burger, knowing it was useless at this point to convince Tony of otherwise. JARVIS sent the email through. “You really didn’t have to do that, Tony,” He said sheepishly. “I know you’re a very secure person and you seriously don’t have to connect me with one of your accounts.”
I can’t be doing this. It’s not right. I rub a hand over my face before I step out the car as well, standing in front of the pump. I was just tired.
Bruce looked between Rhodey and Tony. “I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s avoiding us, but Tony, you have been blowing off the team more.”
Steve blushed and looked away, glad that Tony was too busy driving. “I’m curious about everything I missed.” Steve looked out the passenger window. “It feels all too foreign here. Maybe if this doesn’t work, I can spend everyday catching up over the past 70 years since there won’t be any consequences,” He joked, though he had a gut feeling that would be true.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony greeted with a warm smile as he sat upright on the bed. Shirtless. Though to Steve’s luck – while at the same time being unlucky for more than one reason – there was a bandage wrapped around Tony’s torso where he had been injured at.
Steve just shook his head as he slung his rag back over his shoulder. “We’ll just have to do this the old fashion way then, Stark. Are you up for it?” He asked after, and I swear on my mother I saw his lips twitch like he was going to grin. He might as well have.
The guy attempted to dart around Steve, but he quickly slapped the guy back with his shield. The dealer landed stuck in the nearest wall. If it were possible, stars would be dancing around his head.
“You tell yourself that, Tony. Whatever helps you sleep better,” He shrugged with a small grin.
Tony shrugged then took another bite of food. “Sure, why not?” He chuckled, but it was a soured chuckle. “There’s not really a chance for this person to like me back,” Tony paused for a moment before he looked into Steve’s eyes knowingly. “Is there?”
Tony dismissed Steve’s hand and stood up himself. “Got one of my cars ready?” He asked hopefully.
For the most part, we ate in silence after. Not our usual uncomfortable, tension-filled silences, but a regular silence. It was nice, especially as we ate.
“Right away, sir,” Jarvis replied and searched through the internet and databases in S.H.I.E.L.D. for the pictures. They were pulled up within seconds on Steve’s phone, and he groaned.
Steve flashed Tony one last smile before he turned around as he took another bite of his toast. Even if Tony didn’t feel anything, and nothing would ever happen between them, Steve could manage his crush if they continued as best friends.
Captain America lives in my tower.
. It was real.
“Had a good workout, I see,” Tony chuckled as he saw Steve’s appearance, though his nose crinkled up. “And smell.”
Steve couldn’t help but to laugh at the shorter man. “It’s just…different. Partying used to be different, and so did—well, everything, really.”
Tony didn’t argue with that, setting the briefcase down and stepping on it to signal the suit to attach. While he did that, Steve walked up to the door of the apartment and knocked on it. He stood there as he heard the voices go down inside, holding his hands clasped together in front of him.
Steve set Tony’s now lifeless body down as gently as he could before he stood. His back was to the arms dealers, and they started to back away with guns held up.
“Steve is there something you need that I can give you?”
“I just think there’s more to it, Tony. Coming from both sides.”
Currently, Steve was reading a book with Tony’s head resting on his lap as they relaxed in the living room of Tony’s suite. As Steve’s focus remained on the printed words, Tony’s focus was fixated on Steve’s face.
“Captain America,” Zola explained.
“Why are you so nice? You had to disappear. I did that. I made Captain America disappear,” she sobbed in his chest.
He sensed more than he saw Steve’s sarcastic ‘thank you’ and for some reason it made him happy.
“Maybe you could describe him to Captain America.” Out of the corner of his eye he saw Steve suddenly turning to him.
“Calling Dr. Banner.” Steve could hear the disapproving undertone, but apparently Jarvis had detected that nothing would deter Tony from this course of action. Once again he tried to turn around, this time mobilizing all of his strength. It was not much and by the time he had turned his head to look at Tony, the man was kneeling in front of the bed and looking at him with worried eyes.
“Or friends with benefits?” Tony offered and it stung a little.
"Widow?"
“Earlier?”
“Alright, we’ll ask your aunt Tasha for help. Happy now, you untrusting cookie-cake.”
“Only when Mr. Stark was there. And usually after hours. And here …” she gesticulated in the direction of the door “… here you can see him every day.” She sighed again. “Too bad he’s taken.”
“He is not,” Zola protested. “I’m not having this discussion again.”
Steve was already in their bed – and he liked the feeling of warmth every time he thought of a bed as their bed – and enjoyed the view. He had enjoyed it almost daily in the last three months since Tony and he usually spent their nights together – either at the Avenger’s facility, at the tower or most of the time at the Brownstone.
“Oh my god, Jamie, stop!” Once again Zola was thankful for her dark skin, at least her embarrassment wouldn’t be that obvious. Then she caught Barton smirking at her. Or maybe it would. To spies. And anybody knowing her.
“What is there to tell? We don’t have any proof that somebody is out there trying to destroy the Avengers. Look at me – Ultron. No one wants to see me back in the armor when there is a possibility that I created the need for it. Thor has things to do in Asgard. Bruce,” he shrugged, wondered a second about the right words, “also personal reasons. And we left before you. Rhodey was ordered back by the military. Sam is chasing Bucky’s bread crumbs. Clint was suspended. There is no pattern, nothing tangible.”
“So, you are not allowed in the kitchen?” Steve laughed. Tony’s disasters in the kitchen had become legendary.
“We talk to her after she gets home,” Steve decided.
“How?”
“It’s my own code.”
Steve gripped the hook harder, he could feel the draw of the chain pulling it back to its crane.
It took Tacle a second longer to realize what would happen, but he couldn’t move his tentacle fast enough. Steve watched as the chain tore right through the tentacle, leaving Tacle unbalanced. As if in slow motion Tacle tipped to the side until gravity set in and he started to fall. Steve jumped after him. In the last moment he grabbed Tacle’s arm; holding him. Tacle’s remaining tentacle hung lifeless below Tacle. Steve reached out with his other arm, trying to grab another part of Tacle, but the other man remained still.
“Yes. I couldn’t let something like this happen again.”
“Yes, you are.” And with this Tony pulled Steve closer to him, encircling his hips with his legs and threw both arms around Steve’s neck. Tony kissed him, deep and full of feelings and only the slight touch of heat. Steve wanted nothing more than to stay here forever and kiss a naked Tony in his arms, but then Tony whispered ‘take me to bed, soldier’ he was really happy to follow an order.
“Changed the department. Replacement still needs to be found.” She answered shortly.
Steve snorted. “There will be other afternoons. And As if you would have stopped after what we’ve just heard.”
“I knew it,” he exclaimed.
Steve stared at the pictures in front of him. One taken from before the battle, her and the pram, several mugshots of her and the last one clearly taken in a morgue.
He took one of the free newspapers intending to use it as a polite signal to be left alone so that he could plan his next steps, but an article about the Avengers caught his eye. He started reading it only to stop disgusted a few lines in when he learnt that Hawkeye had been suspended for his argument with the civilian. So now the Avengers were down to three with Natasha as the only founding member still active. And unfortunately Natasha was still no media darling, refused to play their games.
Apparently not.
“Beside the fact that you haven’t had a cold in 70 years.”
Yes, everything was packed, besides one thing. She grabbed one of her shirts out of the bag to wrap the picture frame from the side board. It had been taken at the beginning of their relationship and she was always reminded of the butterflies in her tummy and sunshine kisses. He had never understood why she liked this picture so much, claimed that he was barely in it. And in a way he was right. They were both framing Captain America, his arms resting on both of their shoulders. And although the Captain did nothing extraordinary, his smile almost shy, he captured the attention of the viewer. Despite the end of her relationship she wouldn’t leave this behind. A picture of Captain America was still worth something and the third person in the picture could easily be folded away.
“Do you want a tour or start right away?”
“Yeah, that’s why you lived in a cabin in the woods.”
For a moment he wasn’t sure if Tony had heard him and with a every second passing he felt more and more insecure. The other man was staring at him with an unreadable expression; before he suddenly crushed his mouth to Steve’s and then bolted upright.
“Two men on a bench staring at a grieving woman – not a good sign. A couple enjoying some time off in a park, way better.”
“The money, early access to groundbreaking tech,” Tony shrugged. “He is not the only one of the old directors that doesn’t like the direction SI is taking now but as long as it’s making profit they mostly keep their opinions to themselves. Also it’s not so easy to get rid of directors and besides, as I said, he’s got good contacts to the Senate and the military. I may be not in the weapon’s business anymore but I still like to sell some of the stuff I invented to the military. And Pepper claims he is sensible guy. But apparently even Pepper can be wrong.”
Zola was pretty sure it started the day Jamie came into her office to pick her up for lunch. There was nothing unusual about it, down to the part where Zola just had to finish this email until she was ready to leave. So when her office door opened she barely took the time to look up.
“You are impossible. You are an impossible standard for us to reach. No man can compare to you and no man should. They should see you as you really are. How could you do this to us?”
He laid the letter on a small container next to him. Tony flashed him a small smile before he took the letter turning it around in his hands as if to understand its concept. He read it and then spread it out on one of the desks.
“That’s better,” Steve sighed contently. “I think I will be up in no time,”
“Maybe,” Tacle answered. “But maybe I’d like to torture first.”
“Zola,” Jamie warned.
“You know him,” Steve concluded.
“Yeah, a spy and the media don’t seem like an ideal combination.”
“You are telling me you didn’t already? Now, I’m disappointed,” and Steve smiled too.
“Oh god, I wouldn’t want to work there,” Zola shuddered. “Anyway, as I was saying when I go in there they are always sitting on the sofa and simply eating and talking.”
“He didn’t do anything to me. Really, I swear.”
“Yes, and as I said, former Pentagon paper pusher. Has a hell of a lot connections. I guess that’s why my father went with the exchange. Tacle was one of those who protested the most when I closed down the weapon’s manufacture.”
“It’s not every day that you save the girl and prove her innocence to a disbelieving world.”
“What?”, Steve prompted.
“The smiling.”
It was definitely late morning or early afternoon, when Steve heard the door silently clapping. He opened his eyes and saw Tony putting down a steaming mug. Herbal tea, from the smell of it.
“We go in, find him, arrest him and give him to the authorities.”
Tony watched Steve standing in front of the tombstone decorated with a small angel. His head hang low and his shoulders were hunched and Tony knew that despite all of Tony’s evidence Steve still felt responsible for the death of this child. He hoped they would find the mother and learn something more about Cullen and the circumstances of his death, but above all he hoped that they’d find that he was right, that the kid had been already dead and hopefully hadn’t been murdered by Steve's mysterious blackmailer.
“Too bad.”
“Sorry, didn’t want wake you. I was just leaving some tea for you.”
“Hey yourself,” was all Steve managed as reply and he grinned in return when he saw Tony’s eyes laughing at him.
“Are you sure?”
“Ms. Robinson?” He addressed her. She probably shouldn’t be surprised that they knew her name. It was still unsettling.
Tony hummed in agreement before he asked.
It took long to find something. Right now they had spent the last three days waiting. Or in Steve’s case exploring the whole Brownstone and its amenities including a ‘Captain America proved’ gym as Tony called it. He had tried working out his impatience with activity like exercising or cooking, but soon had figured out that the best way to endure it was staying close to Tony. They discussed things seriously and bickered as old friends and it was so easy, so natural that Steve wondered why they hadn’t done this before.
