Warnings: some violence, childbirth, lots of pain, TEMPORARY (it's complicated) character death, angst, and whump. The childbirth isn't very graphic, I don't think? But lemme know if anyone needs me to mark it as a trigger.
“Then I don’t have to tell you that your bed-rest begins at the end of your next month.”
Steve purses his lips into a pout and looks away. He grumbles, "They're perfectly logical to have in our line of work."
“U’hoa?” Tony’s never heard of that one. “Is that like the ula kui?”
Reed groans. "Okay... so we may or may not have stolen it from a mercenary who found it buried in trash at a dump."
“Could’ve fooled me, Cap. I see now you never considered me your friend. Fine. Goodbye, Steve,” he replies flatly and turns to leave.
The doctor doesn’t answer and instead looks at the monitor where these two blobs have appeared that look a lot like babies. He’ll never get used to seeing them. His own beautiful babies.
“Rogers,” Fury spoke to the roomful of departing Avengers, “you stay.”
“Tony’s been abducted,” Clint mutters.
Tony just looks confused. “But what about my bedrest?”
Reed must notice his confusion, so he pipes up: "The
He doubts that they will. They definitely shouldn’t-- but Steve tries anyway.
On that note, Steve knew he had much to account for. He needed to own up to his failings, take responsibilty for his actions, and accept whatever consequences he was due.
"Stark International" is... intriguing. It's not that Tony had never thought to branch out, or even that he doesn't have contracts with other countries, but it's interesting that this Stark decided to change the company's name after his Vietnam--what? Not the Middle East?-- debacle. Though, as Stark tells it, his... accident... came from a land mine and not a missile. And then made a new company, Stark Enterprises, after Obie acquired the company--Stane International, really?--but Iron Man convinced Obie, or Hammer--it's unclear--to hand back over Tony's assets. And, also, Iron Man was a secret identity, which made it/him a separate entity. Ha.
the Tesseract?"
“Sorry. I was just… thinking.”
“He– I don’t know. You’re right, okay? I was just– I don’t know what came over me, but I had to protect Bucky.”
"What? What's wrong?" Jacey is immediately in front of him and checking to make sure he's okay.
Pepper would... No, he didn't want to think about her. She'd made it perfectly clear that this "break" that's been going on since before Ultron is not really a break at all. He didn't blame her.
"Pushing?" Confusion muddles his tone. "What are you- oh. You mean when you told me about Steve and the," his voice tightens and he spits out, "bond."
. He shudders. Then, he looks.
Until he remembers. Fuck.
“Steve,” and his voice is so soft and it’s a struggle to get the words to form, “I– did you read–?” He doesn’t have the energy to ask more.
Oh. And Steve suddenly understands everything that Tony had been trying to tell him and even realizes the implications behind Tony showing up to Siberia to help him and Bucky out. Steve is ashamed of himself. Again.
"What?" Steve says eloquently.
“Captain Rogers, boss,” the AI answers.
“Yeah,” he mumbles, “it’s been like that since I got my first check up during puberty and my first heat was… more difficult than it should have been.”
“Shut up, Rogers, I didn’t ask you. You and I will be having
Now the drinks keep coming, throw my head back laughing
“Respect you?” Tony raises a brow and scoffs. “Do you have a PhD?”
“It was a just a soul bond,” he shrugs.
“Lucky,” Tony snorts, “yeah. Real lucky. I’m pregnant and
perfect.
Tony meets his gaze and drinks the now-cold dregs of his latte. “What?”
“Gee, Natasha, didn’t Stark kick you out too? A little–”
“Yeah, the PTs want to rehabilate you to make sure there isn’t any lasting damage to your nerves or limbs. You’ll still be on bedrest, but it’ll be very lenient and you’ll be allowed to roam with supervision– just in case. Of course, you are free to leave as soon as the physician clears it.”
And, for God’s sake, the man sometimes even
"First: you must promise to not exert yourself unduly, even if that means waiting here on this couch until someone can come to assist you."
“Why are you talking about pie?” Another new voice asks, clearly very bemused.
“Hi, Jacey,” He smiles.
Happy reading~
It's hard to say it, time to say it
“Stark said? Why has Stark been lying all this time? Why tell me now? Th-this– to not tell me of my brother– I do not understand?”
, don’t lie to me! You owe me that much, at least!”
“‘Doom situation’?” Both Strange and Tony parrot back.
if this gets the idiots to listen, then go ahead.”
“He tried to break it,” his hushed voice cracks.
“Clint, Tony put Wanda on house arrest.”
Have you cried lately? No? Do you have enough angst and feels in your life? No? Well, ladies and gentlemen... allow me to rectify that problem with this overly emotional chapter that I had to cut in half because I got carried away. Here's 4,203ish words of feels and probably an OOC Steve.
She looks offended. “No, not at all. Do you know how many orders he broke while in the Army? He’s not used to any form of a chain of command that he wasn’t the lead of. He needs–has always needed–another perspective to get his head out of his ass. That’s why he and Barnes were such a great team. That’s why
Strange flicks his eyes away and doesn't really respond. Great. Tony heaves out a groan and rolls his eyes skyward.
He pushes.
“Clint?” Wow, today is just stock full of surprises. It must be a Wednesday.
Another contraction and Tony yelps and squeezes Jacey's and Steve's hands so hard they hear the fine bones grinding. The midwife immediately checks dilation once it's over.
“I’m serious, Wanda, Pietro isn’t dead. I don’t know how he survived, but Tony said he’s in Korea.”

Strange had arrived two days ago, which means it's only a matter of time.
Rogers stares at him.
Rhodey gapes. “Twitter,” he shakes a finger at Tony. “All my followers are hearing about this.”
“No,” she says and she’s gripping his hand now, “but I am a friend.”
how many of you do I have to mop up off the floor?
“Fucking JCTC. Fucking government assholes,” Tony growls.
Reed opens his mouth to protest, but then closes it. He moves his head in a way that signifies agreement.
Steve wakes covered in rubble with a massive headache and probably a broken arm and leg. He moves the chunk of ceiling that tried to flatten him off, and slowly extricates his aching limbs from Tony’s. That’s when he sees the piece of metal protruding through Tony’s left leg. He’s bleeding profusely.
“It’s ‘kay… ‘Eve… it’s. We nee’d to figh’, I think. I– Steve… if the,” Tony’s breath stutters and he just needs to say these two last things; he needs more time, “if the medics ge’ h’re… tell ‘em… tell ‘em I… that I. That ‘m pregnant, Steve. Ca’ you… ca’ you do tha’ for me?”
Tony's eyes blow wide as if to say 'what? who? me? never.'
Please

“Nothing you’re willing to do. Honestly, you couldn’t just sign a damn piece of paper to make everyone stay together? You all should be ashamed of yourselves. He’s done so much for you, given you
see ya'll soon, k?
He dons a ball-cap he'd acquired from one of the desks in the lab. He offhandedly plucks a pair of convenient sunglasses that happens to be sitting on top of the front desk as he makes his way out of the building.
“She was an omega, just like you, who had difficulty bonding to a partner, sexual or relationship wise. In fact, her case was so severe that she couldn’t bear to be with anyone sexually and her relationships often ended quickly. She had one small pack of friends that she bonded with, as well as with the three members of her family pack. It wasn’t until later in her life, when she came across who would be her future husband, that she bonded with him. They have a scale for bonds, Tony, did you know that? She only bonded that deeply one time, with one person. They call that a soul bond, Tony.”
Steve smiles and his eyes crinkle as he passes the cup over.

that right now. Not with her.
“Tony,” he calls out, “Tony?” He looks around and spies the engineer on his stomach on the floor. He’s bleeding from a gash on his forehead and his eyes are shut.
"Vision," Tony starts.
"Well," Tony looks back at the house. "I'd like to know that, too. Where am I, exactly?"

"Second: when I return, I would like for you to tell me the names of your children."
to, and really that’s the whole problem here, isn’t it?” If Steve had been willing to maintain a cool head and think through strategy like he’s so damn good at, then maybe he would have listened. But he’d been blinded by Bucky’s involvement and Ross’s eagerness to detain the Winter Soldier.
? What she’s seeing doesn’t match up. Not by a single, tiny iota.
"Vision, you could be the difference between them winning and them losing. It-- if it's not a bad fight, or if you win right away, then you can come straight back here and protect my ass like you want, okay? But, Vis, I just -- I need you to do this. Please."
It’s Steve.
"There's something else, Tony," the two men murmur.
Then he remembers that he's supposed to wait for assistance. However... a battle has just begun, so help is unlikely to come in the next five minutes or so. He'll have to assist himself.
“Who is it?” He groans.
“Christ! Sneaking up on people is not nice, Vision!” She exclaims.
“I figured you’d be here,” she calls out.
“What the hell was that?” Sam asks.
“It’s okay. I would have kissed you, too, but then it’d be because I love you,” and Steve smiles an honest and pure smile, the one that makes Tony’s knees go a little weak when it’s directed his way.
no, I was
“No, you didn’t. None of you did because Tony Stark didn’t want you to, and none of you sure as hell asked him. I bet you didn’t even know the financial toll SI and Stark’s own personal fortune has been subjected to just for taking responsibility for all the damages done to city property, as well as supplying the Avengers with all the weapons and gear they need.”
Steve opens and closes his mouth.
The strawberry-blonde stares down at her hands, notices the near-empty plane, gathers her stuff, and slowly walks out.
“Ella lived during that time, and she was one of the few to document her experience. She died some time after World War 2, I believe. It was reported that her husband, Tom, died days after her due to a broken heart and a broken bond. The syndrome was named after her, then, on the wishes of her family.”
Carol’s book, not shockingly, goes viral. Those bureaucratic assholes are not very happy, but Carol can’t really bring herself to care.
Tony just sighs and scrubs a hand down his face. Tony, Reed Richards, Stark, and Jane Foster had all gathered together in Reed's lab to discuss the parallels and the differences of their worlds. So far, it sounds like Tony's world is one nasty weather forecast away from being the most bad-luck-ridden universe these Avengers have ever had the pleasure of interacting with. And, yeah, Tony can see how two alien invasions, Thor's decimated home world, an evil robot rampage, and countless Hydra base boomings would lead them to that conclusion. A "villain" attacking is standard operating procedure as far as Tony's concerned. In fact, that's practically every Tuesday. Granted, his villain's are much less super-y and a lot more terrorist-y, so who's really got the short end of the stick here?
Tony doesn’t answer the messages. Ever. For his sanity.
“I just want you to know,” she says and bookmarks the page, “that I don’t approve of this tactic; running never solves anything, Tones. However... I’ll let it go on one condition.”
. I don’t think they were expecting all the media backlash from the very, very angry populace that their sole remaining hero had not only been arrested, but also
Vision sighs heavily, but takes Tony's words into consideration. He'll compromise here.
Her eyes sharpen and her gazes fixes to the wall at the end of the hall in a tenacious glare. She won't let this turn out the way 616 did. She won't.
Tony is suddenly not sad anymore, now he’s angry. He’s so, so angry. He just wants to hurt Steve back. He wants petty revenge and he wants to scream and to let Steve know the kind of pain Steve gave him. So, he shouts.
, Tony thinks. Why does Rogers stare at him so much? Surely he and Stark aren’t
“Steve… I… I… will… will you kiss me? For old times’ sake?”
And, If Tony asks really nicely, Steve will make him something to eat and watch terrible romantic comedies with him on the couch. Probably not the best movie choices, but Steve doesn’t seem to mind. It’s nice.
"No reactor?"
“Mad? How could I be mad when I just found out that my best friend really can have that family he’s always wanted?”
He’s at the door when the rumbling starts. He hears it before he feels it. “No,” he whispers, “not again.”
His therapy was going quite well, and he was learning a lot about new manners and etiquette in this day. He didn’t much care to learn about standard behavior in the 21st century. But, the doctor had explained, the behavior wasn’t due to lack of caring or compassion, but more fear of being met with disdain and ridicule. There was even a fear of being sued by people who’s lives you saved, which was a startling common occurence that Steve had met with disbelief and disgust.
"Which is...? Also, didn't Thor have the Tesseract?" The engineer rubs his chin and thinks.
Steve’s entire body looks like Tony just hit Life’s pause button. “What?” He squeaks.
“Mm?”
Wanda freezes and looks at Steve with distrust and disbelief. “This American jokes is not funny.”
ah yeah don't forget to subscribe updates are sporadic at best
By his expression of horror and disgust, she’d guess not. It’s been a long time since anyone has had certain
Tony tries not to grin at the small chuckle that escapes Steve’s lips.
“Good boy,” she chuckles, “But, as long as you promise to take your prenatal vitamins, follow this dietary plan to the letter, and get at least eight hours of rest each
to make him stop by using extreme, unnecessary violence. Why didn’t you just talk him down, Rogers? Why didn’t you try to get him to calm down, hm? Can you tell me that? No? Well, I’ll tell you why, Rogers, and it’s because you’re going through something called Bond Detachment.”
she growls.
He kind of feels like his brain is melting out of his ears when Jacey stops by for another visit.
jacey's secret comes out and the avengers start to work on their teamwork a little bit.
-ing things it really had no business amping up.
He sighs. Ever the psychologist, she is. “Just… it was about Pepper. That’s all. I was thinking… I’m glad she’s happier, now.”
"N-not s-surprised," is all Tony can say.
“... I knew…” Tony murmurs with his eyes downcast and looking so lost and
“Steve,” Sam sam folds his arms and glares, “Tony went there as a friend. You said he attacked you and Bucky.”
When the elevator finally dings open and Steve rushes to the panel, he remebers that he had to speak his code to the AI to be given access to the residential part of the Tower. He doesn’t even know if his will still work.
he won't
“I– I didn’t consider that. I’m sorry.”
“Is that a challenge? Bring it on!”
Tony shrugs and proceeds to brush his teeth about five times, complete with mouth wash.
"Uh. H-hey, Barton. What's up?"
"Yeah, yeah... 'be serious'. What's up?"
“I doubt it,” he mutters under his breath as she leaves.
"Could you break up the nest? I'm feeling a little... boxed in." He winces.
"Romania? I didn't--" Oh.
“My name is Jacey Kirk,” she starts politely.
“I did not know,” she whispers, horrified, “I never would hafe– it is a great
Tony takes a sip, “Ohhhh, my beautiful precious divine java…”
Rhodey freezes. “Tony,” he says warningly, “who is it?”
He’s got his answer.
in your world?" Like the idea is unfathomable.
He didn't want to get up. He was not comfortable, but far too lazy to move from his secluded safe-spot by the window to get up and retrieve the bottle.
“Nope,” Tony’s in a great mood now. Possibly because Steve cursed, because of Steve’s accent, and–oh right–because Steve defended him.
“Here’s your coffee,” the warm, soothing voice supplies.
Rhodey still doesn’t know or notice. Before all this, he might have been a little upset about that, but Rhodey’s dealing with the paralysis. Tony’s problems probably don’t even register. It’s okay, Tony tells himself, it’s okay. He’s fine.
Got a real good feeling something bad about to happen

The guy can barely stand the guilt of the people who were victims in Sokovia, let alone from his weapons when he still made them. You think he’d be capable of killing Barnes? Who, by the way, he knows is innocent and was controlled and forced to do everything.
It's as good an answer as any.
He should probably be angry that it took him almost dying, but he can’t find it in his weary heart to care right now. He doesn’t forgive them. He wont– he can’t. Not yet. Probably not for a very long time.
The doctor–not nurse–smiles back. “I would hope so! They don’t drag me out of bed for nothin’ these days, ya know!”
“Yeah,” the brunet scoffs, “some mate.”
. You create all these things for the public and for the team, and you make it look so easy. I think I was a little jealous, actually,” Steve laughs, “here I was from another century with only the ability to punch and figure my way out of a rough spot. But you… You invent and dream up all this stuff that I’d never even thought possible. I– I thought you were a better Avenger than me. That you were–and are–better suited to this day’s gadgets and gizmos than I.”
“I remembered,” Tony says quietly.
IDK when next ch is coming but prob soon. also. more feels to come.
He decides that he doesn’t have the right to speak to Tony yet, so he writes him letters instead. He tells Tony everything in his letters. All the way from his day to apologies to what the future holds.
"What? Is it something I said?"
I wanna feel just like this
*winces* next chapter is worse... prepare them feels everyone.
"You are in labor," the alien mutters with some amount of disgust and another emotion Tony is too out of to properly define.
“...’m four months pregnant, C-Cap. Y-you do the m-math.”
"Huh?" Tony can barely concentrate, let alone see straight.
"No," she shakes her head. "The placentas next."
Tony looks him straight in the eye. "I died."
“Yes, zat. Anyways, it happens with married couples. I zink. I do not know, maybe happens vith others?”
“But, Director–”
Is every Tony Stark doomed to never have more than one or two genuine friends? Why is it that all the blame is placed squarely on his own shoulders? Why...
“What’s this about, Captain?” Tony gets right down to business because he doesn’t want to be here any longer than he has to.
“You said what?” Natasha and Fury snarl.
"We-- I need to take you to Reed. He can-- he explain all this better than I can. Uh, by the way, why are you still sitting? Are you okay?"
“I don’t know, sugar, I don’t know. But, we can try. I’m going to help you through this, Tones, I swear it.” Her voice is solemn and soothing all at once. Tony wishes he loved her instead.
“Ross seems to be very angry, Boss, he claims he will come back with a warrant and a SWAT team if he isn’t let up.”
The paramedics are coming down the elevator, she sees. It doesn't matter. They're too late.
He sticks to the wall for extra support as he waddles his way to the nearest restroom.
“Got tortured, Jacey. Got… kidnapped. Again. And I thought that… I thought I’d moved
He even says stuff like: [
The man raises an eyebrow. “I have some questions for you, Mr. Stark, and you will answer them.”
“Yeah. Did you know, Steve, that he can’t take baths anymore? That he can’t stand to be in the shower for more than a few minutes? That he has nightmares every night about Afghanistan and about Obadiah Stane? About New York and the portal?” She’s only looking at him, but Steve feels as if she’s accusing him of something. Steve’s feeling a lot in those moments, actually. It feels like guilt and sorrow and self-hate. It feels an awful lot like he’s made a terrible, miserable mistake. It kind of tastes like vomit.
Rhodey and Helen watch the cars pull away. They head back inside and ask FRIDAY to put on the news. It's bad. The footage shows Tony being led away and the cars driving off. The two of them are staring at the TV in shock when something even worse happens. The car in front blows up and sets off a chain-reaction for multiple wrecks. Helen and Rhodey both pale. "Dear God, no, not again." Rhodey sounds agonized.
, which… wow. That’s one hell of an intense friendship. Tony resolutely tries not to be jealous.
Carol is not having the best of days. In fact, she's willing to sound awfully dramatic and cliché when she thinks it's probably one of the worst days of her life. First, her new job at NASA was going pretty well up until today where she gets kidnapped by a psychopathic alien. She wonders if maybe all these goddamn aliens are fucking crazy. Second, said kidnapping did not go well and she had to see her friend Mar-Vell get killed by the alien who kidnapped her. Third, she gets knocked into some weird ass machine that did something and now she feels weird. Fourth, she loses her awesome job at NASA because apparently she's supposed to have some kind of cosmic control over the aliens that attack NASA. And, her supervisors had somehow expected her to be able to deal with said aliens despite her being human. Needless to say, Carol is extremely angry and is writing her complaints in a journal. Maybe she'll turn it in to a book. That'll show those bureaucratic assholes.
He reaches the Mansion quickly. More memories. More awful, abhorrent memories of things he’s done. Things he now wishes he could take back. Though he supposes, in a way, they kind of have been.
“But you’ve smelled it before?”
pervert
“What?” Clint looks shocked now. Steve is too; he’s never heard Fury this angry before.
"Lawyers? That's funny. Captain America said the same thing."
“So, any news?” Sam pipes up after the king sits down at the head of the table.
Tony raises an eyebrow, but doesn’t argue. “Sure.” He slips on his underwear with the gown on, and then shimmies into his jeans. He pulls the strings undone and slips out of the hospital gown. “Oh.” He’s still got the IV and stuff in him. “Guys.”
“What are you saying?” Steve glances up sharply.The soldier looks confused. Like he hadn’t realized that before.
Jacey then tells him that they’re getting out of there soon, so would he please stop fidgeting.
Jacey opens her mouth, and then realization dawns on her face. Her mouth forms an ‘o’. Her eyes get very sad when she searches Tony’s eyes. “It’s… complicated,” she replies, “For some, it’s communication. For others, it’s compromise. For us… for us, it’s trust.” Tony notices, for once, that her eyes go a little distant and her body language closes off ever so slightly.
The placentas both come out easily. There's too much blood, and it's still trickling out of his canal. He's hemorrhaging, she knows. It's too late.
Arthur isn’t there to greet her. She didn’t really think he’d be, but sometimes she forgets that he’s… busy. She sits down in one of the seats in the terminal and presses her fists into her eyes. She tries not to cry.
I just want your kiss
Tony rolls his eyes upward.
“I’m so sorry for– how awful it must be. My best friend– he– I’ve known him for twenty years and I– I get it. It. It’s not easy, right?”

"I mean," she grabs Tony's hand and squeezes, "two weeks from today, you are going to make a choice. It won't be a difficult one, not for you, but it will... it'll impact your future." She's crying again and she can't say more because the Code won't allow it and her own curse won't let her interfere any more than this. No matter how badly it kills her to not be able to.
. We have to prepare!" Bruce twists his hands and his eyebrows are furrowed in obvious anxiety.
“Tony,” Steve sobs, “I’m so, so sorry.”
did that. Steve is the one who blew it all to hell.”
Almost like they're trying to dance away from realizing their own faults and mistakes they've made. Only to place them on Tony when the consequences require a checkbook.
“Great,” Tony spits, “either of you happen to be an alpha?”
The line rings and he chews Steve out for everything. He neglects to mention a few things, but he thinks the message gets across. He hopes. He's going to have a lot of explaining to do when they arrive. "Hurry, Rogers." He shuts his eyes and downs more alcohol.
“Pro’ly m’ pheromones…”
They shouldn’t have worked.
. Stop thinking about all the goddamn sex you

do?” From his tone it sounds like Steve knows exactly what Tony would do.

Tony barks out a loud laugh. “That’s me: Tony ‘Brutally Honest’ Stark. It’s not the first time I’ve heard that.”
“Yes!” The doc hisses and he sounds so frustrated it’s
can't because
Tony swallows, but nods.
Jacey just giggles, high on the endorphins of Tony's compiled nest pheromones. "Don't be silly! Steve~ join us!" She smiles broadly and just squishes his face into her chest and smothers him with her arms.
sorry -- i've had lots of life happening. like, shitty life stuff so I've been low on creativity and inspiration. In fact... i almost nearly deleted all of my works.
"Stand down!" One shouts.
“It started off as a long day. I was working a part-time job, and it was raining. I liked the job well enough, there are worse ones, you know. I’d had… well, little faith in myself at the time because classes were tough, and it felt like no matter how hard I tried I just couldn’t bring up that damn GPA. It was… a rough time in my life. I’ve never told you this before, Tones, but Arthur was my first relationship. I’d done dates before, I guess, but not many.
“Next you’ll be telling me you’re sexy,” Jacey’s eyes dance.
“Great. She alone?”
Tony scrubbed his face. God dammit. The not-scotch because, despite it being scotch it wasn't actually alcoholic (Tony was not an idiot and he knew what alcohol did to fetuses), tempted him from the bottle across the room.
. It makes sense, she knows, why Tony's been a little short with her lately. Omegas do have their ways of knowing something is being kept from them. In hindsight, it's probably why Steve and Tony fell apart when they did. Why the fights and the bickering just kept... worsening. She has to tell him, though. This... even though she's not supposed to interfere, and she won't - not really - but this is important and she can't see another loved one die. She can't.
Tony sniffs. “The overrides were… a… a hope. Hope that you’d change your mind, and I couldn’t... those codes represented the only family I’d ever truly had. Changing them meant that I’d have to face the music. I couldn’t bear to do it. I couldn’t. It was torture already having you always look at me and
. That's what got him blown up by his own missile, that's what got Wanda's family killed, it's what got Charlie Spencer killed. No. Tony would rather be left alone -- a verifiable sitting duck -- than let people down.
He smiles goodbye and lets go.
“I know.” Tony clenches his hands into fists. “How do I… How do I make it stop, Jacey?” His eyes are watery when he meets her gaze.
"How the time passed away? All the trouble that we gave
Okay. Good. Honesty, yeah, honesty is good.
Is he here to... fix something? No, that can't be right. Help? Maybe. Honestly, he can see how the SHRA gained support, but still... he's ashamed that no one called the unconstitutional card, or that no one argued to make a

that Tony and Stark are somehow deplorable people is very, very offensive. Tony lives with his guilt eating at him day in and day out; has tried to atone for his sins in more ways than one.

Tony jerks his hand away and gnaws on his lower lip, but Steve can’t read the expression on his face.

“Rhodey! It’s fine! Okay? It’s… fine. I’m fine. Let it go.”
"It's... it's a space ship," Vision utters with awe.

“I was getting used to it. Therapy was getting a little better right before it all went down. After we got out of Brooklyn, Steve forced me to keep working on it, build up strength,” Bucky explained, pushing the cart forward again. “Still hurts every now and then but… it’s manageable.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I never need rescuing, Mr. Rogers,” Toni replied, giving the blonde a look. “I’m perfectly capable of saving myself.”
“Who?”
"Don’t know. We were doing our usual rounds of the neighborhood when we saw people run out of the bar screaming. We were just walking in to check it out when those guys started firing." Natasha reported, leaning over the edge of the table to fire a couple of rounds.
“He’s right. It would be better for all of us. Just… try and get some rest. Sleep off the headache I’m sure you have,” Steve said, giving her a helpless shrug before he followed Bucky into the bedroom.
Howard continued on, and Toni was grateful he either didn’t hear the comment or chose to ignore it. “Steve needs to learn to handle these types of messes himself. The more power he accumulates, the more people are going to try and get to him. You remember what happened during your sixth birthday?”
Toni laid her head back against the stone again, nodding slowly. “Fine. Okay.”
She wasn’t giving into an apology first, still regarded him with that damned mask of hers. She wanted him to cave first, to test the waters before she made the plunge. And Steve could understand her hesitation, but Toni had been the one to hold the grudge first, and they could have avoided that argument earlier had she left his father out of the conversation. “I suppose some of the things were true. Perhaps that’s why they hurt us so bad.”
Bucky grinned, raising his hands in surrender. “Natasha got it for me.”
Tony felt weak in the knees, hands grabbing at the lab table to keep himself from falling over as Bucky tensed. Obadiah simple tutted, releasing his grip on Tony. “From now on, you two will be watched around the clock." He ordered as he moved for the door. “I see I’ve been going too easy on you. Well, I can fix that."
!" He hissed when Clint twisted his left rest sharply, earning a snapping sound.
He didn’t care to analyze that smile on Steve’s face.
Toni didn’t say goodbye when she left, and Steve made no move to stop her. She moved through the large house she had quickly become familiar with the past few days, her mind racing a mile a minute. While she doubted her father’s involvement with Bucky’s disappearance, it was still interesting to hear that the vehicle that probably transported the brunet was found on Stark turf. Was it truly just a coincidence, or was there a bigger plot at play here than just trying to hurt Barnes or piss off Rogers? What if someone wanted Steve to turn on her father?
“Both are excellent questions,” the woman chirped, tucking his knife into her pocket before she bent down to collect his backpack. “My name is Toni and I am robbing you.”
Steve scoffed, taking up his glass of water and turning his attention back to the whale stubbornly. “I have no reason to be thinking of Howard. I approved all of the contracts he sent.”
A clearing throat broke Toni out of her reveries, and she realized she had been staring at a display rack of sunglasses for the past five minutes. She looked over her shoulder, where the blonde one was settled on the floor before the only entrance to the store. His back was against the counter, fingers toying with the coil binding of his sketchbook- a fresh one he had happily found in the back of the general store. His boot was pressed against the unpowered ice cream machine they had pushed in front the door, as if he needed the peace of mind that the barricade was there. His blue eyes were trained on her, brow raised in amusement as he nodded to the glasses she held delicately in her hand. “I don’t think those are your style,” he teased, smile light and carefree.
“You were wearing that godawful suit that was about two sizes too large for you.”
It wasn’t until one guard dropped to the ground, blood splattered across the pavement, that Justin tensed, glancing around. Steve silently thanked that Natasha had the sense to use a suppressor on the rifle. He’d hate to alert the whole community of their activities. In the blink of an eye, the second guard stumbling back as a bullet pierced between his eyes.
blue eyes? Seriously? This is unbelievable.
“Hm, see, the funny thing is, Ross, is that we aren’t. Wanna know why? Because I have no intention of doing any of those things.”
stones, Tony. The ones from the legends?"
ago. I'm not even in the clothes I died in, what the fuck? And, you have a word like 'incursion'? Asking me if I've been drunk? Like, Jesus, I haven't been drunk since my
Tony considers the question that
Now he asks nicely, Tony thinks somewhat glibly. "Dunno, Squidward. Thought the Doc had 'em," he unintentionally responds.
“Your position against the SHRA… I get it, I do. To have your identities stripped away and to be told that you’ll be arrested for not signing; for protecting yourself… I get it. It’s horrible. But, on the other hand, in order to continue being a hero you have to sign and also hunt down your former friends and colleagues because the law says so. It’s a tough situation on both sides. However,” he says slowly, ”nowhere did I see it say that this document with all the Registered names on it would be readily available to the public.
an invasion. It’s an invasion of Wakanda. HYDRA and Stern are behind all of it. They’re going to take an army and bombard the country on all fronts; it’ll be an ambush. I have to tell T’Challa.”
"Hey," Tony said, nudging Clint and forcing him to meet his gaze. "You’re still a great big brother. And don’t worry, if Steve was actually taking advantage of me, I’d kick his ass myself. And the lovable lug he is, he’d let me."
working for him."
“He wants me dead,” Toni rasped, but it was more of a joke than a jab as she laid her head back and stared up at the grey sky above.
“Why? So Rogers can continuously postpone the meeting in order to avoid me? Where’s the fun in it if I can’t come by for a surprise visit and torment him?” Toni chirped, before giving the woman a look. “I’m kidding. Before you get all prickly, I’m here for a purpose. Contracts to deliver and what not. Trust me, I wouldn’t be here if my own accord.”
Bucky rolled his eyes as if exasperated by the question. “
“Of course you’d say that. There’s that blind faith in your father again, so desperate for him to approve of you. You’re telling me that he’s not capable of doing this? That he isn’t the only man in this city that I do business with who’s in a position to take me down like this?” Steve accused.
“We were engaged.”
Howard kept his eyes forward, but he smiled again as he sipped his martini. “I take it you’re aware of what I do, then. More than what the magazines and newspapers cover on me,” Howard hummed, finally turning to meet Steve’s gaze. His eyes were a sharp, electric blue. Just like his daughter’s, Steve noted. “And what do you do for work, Mr…?”
"What’s wrong with your neck?" Obadiah asked, dark eyes flickering to Tony to examine the movement closely.
Tony gasped for air, lungs burning and throat soar as he tried to twist from Obadiah’s grip. “I-I told them you wanted my weapons!”
Toni made an unhappy sound at that.
They were halfway towards the center when a hand grabbed Steve's shoulder from behind, throwing the blonde to the ground. A guard stood over him, hand covered in the metal of Tony's gauntlet weapon, repulsor giving a soft whine as it lit up. Before any shot could be made a bullet traveled straight through the man's temple, sending the guard crumbling to the ground. Glancing up, Steve met Rhodey's eyes on the far catwalk high above the machines and gunfire. Rhodey waved his rifle and Steve dipped his head in thanks before grabbing his pistol and standing.
“Sharon said you skipped lunch and dinner today.”
“amen”
So this wasn’t Stark’s doing, not that that was a thought that crossed his mind. But someone wanted Steve to turn on Stark. Why? For what gain? It would be better to pretend to be unconscious, to get as much information as possible, but if this fucker nudged him one more time-
After a moment more, Toni caved, sliding down to her knees before the board. “Fine. But only if I can be the car.”
"It shows." Steve hummed as he moved towards the entrance and gave the door a rough kick, sending it off its hinges to the ground.
Tony went tense, eyes widening as he turned to face Clint. “What?”
Well, that makes one of them. “Justin, I’m surprised to see you here. I thought you were away on business in Japan,” Toni hummed, taking up a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. She had only agreed on sending him an invitation under the presumption that he wouldn’t be able to attend anyways.
Steve snorted, crossing his arms and giving Tony a look. “Oh, really? You looked like you needed help. Or was sitting on the ground, handing over your wallet and getting shot all a part of your plan?”
As if she could possibly be interested in a man who thought so little of her potential.
“Easy, we’ll find something,” Steve assured, smoothing a hand down Bucky’s back before shifting towards Toni and leaning down to meet her eyes. “Are you feeling alright?”
“It’s what I feel I need to do now. I appreciate her warning and I understand it. If I’m going to address my concerns with Stark, I’m going to do it tactfully. I am going to make it a dialogue, not a trial. If he’s innocent, he’ll see that I just want help and am exercising caution. If he’s guilty, he’ll know I’m on to him.” Steve brushed past her into the bathroom, turning to face her as he gripped the door. “I need you to coordinate delivery schedules for the day, if you don’t mind. Get some of our men back on their runs so that we keep business moving.”
Ty snorted, taking a seat with Toni and stretching an arm out behind her along the back of the couch. “Only good things, I’m sure. I was recently featured on Forbes’ “30 under 30” list; it has a lot of the press buzzing.”
That sparked annoyance in Steve. How was he supposed to honor Howard’s wishes if Toni was insistent on inviting possibly traitorous friends into his secure estate? “And how did you get past the front gates?”
Apparently, my conception of mobs consists solely of booze 24/7.
Tony glanced up to Bruce, smiling widely. “Brucie, I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship.”
Tony snapped to attention as the lab door slid open and Obadiah strode in, smiling brightly to Tony. "Good afternoon, Anthony," he said brightly, setting down a plate beside Tony consisting of a chicken sandwich.
and…and…” Tony sputtered out, voice raw and rasping as he coughed.
Steve followed the instruction, sliding an arm under her shoulders and propping her up into a sitting position. Bucky took the strip of t-shirt, folding it under her broken arm and typing the ends around her neck to create a sling. “You know we can’t leave her like this, Buck. She can’t fend for herself with one broken arm, and that’s assuming she doesn’t succumb to the pain alone.”
Toni took a deep breath through her nose, blue eyes flicking up to meet the blonde’s- Steve’s. His name was Steve. That’s right. In the same moment she shrugged away his hand, turning her gaze away towards the dirt floor beneath her boots. The brunet- Bucky- snorted, zipping up his pack and tugging it over his shoulder. “We need to get moving. We’re wasting daylight and we’re going to need all the time we can get to hit the town and find food and shelter for the night. We’re basically out of food.”
Tony took a slow step forward before diving into his arms, closing his eyes and burying his face in Steve’s shoulder as the soldier wrapped his arms securely around Tony. “You’re still not forgiven,” Tony mumbled softly, curling his fingers in Steve’s shirt. “You’re on probation.”
“Fuck.” Steve swallowed, the bite feeling dry and thick in his throat. He glared down at the offending sandwich for a long moment, ignoring the fact that Natasha was watching him intently even as he took a second bite. He was grasping at straws now, and if
Bucky blinked, a smile slowly spreading across his face. “And we can put out an S.O.S.! Tony, you’re a genius," Bucky said, clapping his shoulder.
“Antonia, darling, I’m glad I found you,” the blonde cooed, taking up her hand and pressing a kiss to the back of it. “I wouldn’t have been able to forgive myself if I had gone the night without wishing you a happy birthday personally.”
Their plan was to hit the supermarket first and stock up on food and first aid supplies. Then they would check out the general store and the other small local stores in an effort to find new clothes and shoes. Hopefully, this town would provide them with more than enough to get them started on their journey north.
The phone on the corner of the desk chirped twice, and Steve had all of five seconds to pinch the bridge of his nose before the intercom crackled to life. “Your four o’clock is in the library, Steve.”
Natasha made a small sound in the back of her throat from where she was perched carefully at the top of the wall, watching as a patrol of guards and snarling dogs moved past. “We’re good. Get up here and take out the guards in the corner posts.”
Bucky gave the blond a mock salute before moving on down the hallway. “Play nice.”
Steve scoffed, turning his gaze away from the window to glower at Natasha. “You want me to pretend like my best friend isn’t missing?”
There it is!
Toni sighed, trying to run through anything on his agenda for the day that could possible piss him off. “Is this about Fury at the police department? I know dad’s been back and forth with him lately.”
“Tony, Im sorry,” Steve insisted, and Tony heard the soft thud of Steve pressing his forehead against the door. “I know I messed up, but I didn’t mean to forget, honest!”
A fluttering blue light bathed the ceiling and walls of the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life, mimicking the way sunlight dances on the ocean’s surface. One of the grand halls that comprised the American Museum of Natural History, Milstein Hall was known for its ninety-four-foot blue whale suspended in the air above the ballroom floor. On this particular evening, that floor was dotted with round dining tables for a dinner honoring donors and encouraging prospective investors. The whale model, despite its 21,000-pound weight, was arched delicately in the air as if diving deeper into the ocean. Its nose pointed towards the stairs leading to the second floor balcony while the rest of its body hung precariously over the dance floor. The watery lights, coupled with the shadowed mammal above, casted a dim, sleepy atmosphere over the room.
He received no response, Steve’s head in his hands as he kept his eyes on the documents and face hidden. Blows were traded, indeed. Bucky groaned, following Toni’s path out of the office and jogging to catch up with her down the hallway. “I don’t know what today’s argument was about, but you both put yourselves in this position with all this bickering.”
“My apologies, Anthony,” Thor said, letting Tony slid down his chest to the floor before stepping out of the way. “This is my brother, Loki.”
"No!" Tony said quickly, hands gently resting over Obadiah's on the pistol. "I can help him. Please. Just give me a little time and I can help him. He'll be good as new!" Tony pleaded, eyes drifting to look over Bucky's tranquil face. "
Bucky’s gruff tone caught Steve’s attention, and he turned to find his husband studying the girl in his arms with a furrowed brow. Her eyes were closed in a pained wince, but Steve was sure she was sleeping. How she could sleep with the rain and- no, he got it. Sleeping was better than feeling the pain. “Doctor’s office,” Steve agreed, touching Bucky’s arm and leading him forward.
"I don’t care, Loki. You will talk." Steve snarled, fists clenching as he stood straighter. “This interrogation is far from over. Even if it takes every single day, I will make sure you suffer slowly until you confess." Steve snarled lowly, his own fist connecting to Loki’s face.
Tony stood and followed after, humming as he passed through the doorway, moving around Steve into the hallway. “You two seem to really be hitting it off,” he commented lightly.
"No." Tony shook his head and looked down. “I’ve been acting so tired lately that Obadiah thought I needed an assistant."
Steve nodded, taking the chair across from the woman and staring down at his pizza. “I saw her this morning. She looked tired. Pained, too.”
Steve tensed and turned to glare at the redhead. “Eleven? You let me sleep all night? Nat, I have serious work to do.”
Tony looked up to Clint, crossing his arms. “No, this is our
“It’s only been a day, Steve. Give it time for word to get around, for people to trade information. We’ll hear something soon.”
Bucky shrugged as he peeled open the lid on one of the chili cans. “I think her belief in her family living is the only thing keeping her going. You’ve seen how people traveling alone in this work get. If they don’t have something driving them, they go insane.”
“Anyone can be little to you, big guy,” Tony huffed, making a strangled noise as Thor practically dragged Tony from his chair and hugged him tightly.
“I heard about your engagement,” Steve commented, taking a seat in the armchair across from them and crossing one leg over the other. “I believe congratulations are in order. When’s the wedding?”
Steve nodded. “You don’t know how many people in your organization are aligned with him.”
Steve’s shoulders slumped, and he bristled defensively. “You were just going to let me stew over here and throw a fit?”
"Good. Now where is his base?" Steve hummed, slowly circling around Hammer and waiting for an answer, but the second in command was already passing out from the pain.
“I blocked off the door when I left yesterday,” Bucky warned Steve as they came to a stop before the supermarket’s entrance. “I took the time to clear out the walkers yesterday; didn’t want any to come back before we did.”
“You are not going to kill her,” Steve cut him off with a pointed look.
“Then I guess I’ll be leading,” Toni hummed dryly, quirking a small smile. Looking over his face, she found no familiar features, nothing that indicated that they’ve met before, and that made her curious. “I don’t think I’ve seen you before- which is strange. After years of dinner parties and galas with New York’s finest, you get used to seeing same people. Who are you?”
Bucky rolled his eyes, following along two steps behind. “Yeah, I know you. Your moral compass is annoying as fuck, but it’s one of the reasons I love you, idiot.”
"They…they wanted to know what I told Clint when I contacted him," Tony whispered, glancing down. "Stane dunked me underwater until I told him. I didn’t mean to give in, it’s just there was so much water and I couldn’t breathe or fight and…and…"
And with that, Toni left the room the same way she usually entered one. Like a storm.
Rhodey smirked, pressing their foreheads together. “Fuck ‘em.”
A fist to his jaw was the only response.
“You too should really just fuck and get all this tension out of the fucking air,” Bucky muttered under his breath, only partially joking. The two were so blinded by their own stubbornness, they refused to see that they could possibly find the other attractive. At Toni’s incredulous look, the man couldn’t help but flash her a wicked grin. “In my experience, it’s a great solution.”
Donovan shifted nervously on his feet, looking down to the floor below. “The kid said he has nothing to do with Rogers.”
Steve scowled but stared down his reflection in the mirror as he straightened his tie. “They aren’t partners. She’s Howard’s little brat of a daughter, and he’s the weasel married to her.”
Howard nodded his approval. “They you’ll need to expand your skill set. I do a lot in this city, and diversifying my investments and planning my moves has made a world of change. Some of my best projects took years to achieve, between buying up land and manipulating the housing market. Importing and pushing products is only part of the game, and it’s a part that any lackey can play. What you want requires the strategy of a calculated businessman.”
Tony staggered back, finding himself looking straight down the barrel of a gun his own brother drew on him. Tony’s voice came out quiet, strangled with a mixture of horror and anger. “Clint?”
The guard looked the two over for the quickest of moments before he dipped his head and opened the door wider. “Mr. Stane was held up at his previous meeting at Citibank. He will be here momentarily, but he asks that you please wait for him in the sitting room and help yourself to a drink.”
Clint hummed, patting Justin’s head. “Loki held out longer than you did, asshole," he sneered.
my partner. What did you want me to do? Let you walk on out with our shit?” Bucky hissed, leaning forward and narrowing her eyes on the girl. “If it was up to me, we would’ve left you in that pharmacy on the floor.”
,” Steve hissed, motioning towards the bandages. “And I have complete faith in Dr. Banner’s work, but it’s too soon.”
He should have expected not to be alone like he wished.
Loki shook his head. “I was blindfolded as soon as I was in the car," Loki huffed. “I’ve told you everything I know." Loki huffed and leaned back into his chair.
"Fuck!" He cried, kicking it to the corner and diving behind the desk as the explosion set off, the blast throwing both him and the desk back with a loud roar. And then, there was nothing but pain and darkness.
"The guard, I did not see him," Thor hissed through gritted teeth, leaning against the wall of the hallway and huffing.
Bucky snorted again, poking at his ravioli. “Bunch of voodoo, if you ask me.”
Clint huffed, turning to the door and pushing it open where he was immediately met with gunfire. "We need to get him. I am not losing my brother again. Not when I am this close," Clint snarled, passing Bucky his second pistol as he moved into the hallway, picking off what guards they came by. "Natasha. Get me intel. I wanna know where Obadiah took Tony," he hissed.
“Why do I want to use the restroom?”
Clint frowned, typing his replies faster as he tapped impatient fingers on the table.
The popcorn bowl sat between them but Tony was all too aware of how close he and Steve were, his attention anywhere but the movie. Every now and then, their hands would brush in the popcorn bowl which led to Tony’s hint of a blush and Steve’s small smirk that had Tony huffing. The movie was terrible, proven by the fact that everyone was asleep halfway through the movie. Thor’s snoring was as booming as his voice and with one glance around, Tony confirmed that everyone was passed out. All except him and Steve.
By the time the sun has set over their small town, the trio had wheeled their shopping carts into the general store and had barricaded the entrance for the night. They had made out well during the looting, restocking almost all of their food and medical supplies. They had even managed to raid a few sets of fresh clothing from the abandoned apartments over the law office. They were now dressed in layers, which would prove to be useful as the summer weather melted away into a crisp and cool fall. Toni was the only one who hadn’t changed her clothes yet, deciding to wait until she could better move her arm before she tried changing her tank top. For now, she would stick with the thick flannel Bucky had giving her two days prior.
, but… she had to admit, things seemed to be going a little easier for them now that she had stopped actively fighting their help. Having them around to pick up her slack while her arm was wrapped up was proving to be useful and Toni was quickly beginning to realize that she’d need their help for quite a while moving forward. At least, if she had any hope of making any headway towards Ontario.
Steve’s smirk widened as Justin’s screams filled the small basement, watching as Clint broke the man’s index finger. “I’ll ask again, Hammer. When’s the invasion?" Steve growled, fist connecting with the second in command’s jaw.
. Toni took a breath and followed her fiancé inside, offhandedly thanking Raza on her way. It could be a coincidence, like Ty just happened to guess which way to go, driven by his hunt for alcohol. But Toni was losing faith; there were just too many coincidences happening. Her decision was made: Toni would ask Ty and Obie at lunch what they’ve been working on together. She could ask about their business together and push hard until she receives a satisfactory answer. Obadiah might stay strong, but Ty would slip up. He already has twice, she just needs a concrete answer.
The blonde laughed, dragging the handgun down Tony’s cheek to press it at the base of Tony’s chin. “Feisty. I wonder if the boss will mind if I play with you before I leave.”
Toni’s demeanor changed the slightest bit; Steve himself would have missed it if it wasn’t for the way her grip tightened on his shoulder. The warmth had disappeared from her expression, her blue gaze hardening as she met Steve’s eyes. Her smile was driven by insincere politeness, pearly white teeth bared as if she was threatening to tear the blonde apart. She stepped forward, now flush against Steve as she cocked her head up to press her ruby lips to his ear. “If there is one thing I hate, Mr. Rogers, it’s when people think I’m dumb enough to be manipulated.”
“Steve, you spent most of the day carrying her around. Take a fucking rest. I have no problem keeping watch, which obviously one of us needs to do,” Bucky assured, snatching up a thick blanket that was folded over the wall of one of the stall before tossing it to the blonde. “We were too reckless last night in the apartment sleeping at the same time. I’m not giving anyone the chance to fuck us over again. Dead or alive.”
Clint turned to Steve, who let out a slow sigh and gave Tony a once over, a thoughtful expression on his face as he nodded. Clint turned back to Tony and sat down, giving his brother a hard look. "For the past three years, I've been working for local mob. This is Steve Rogers, you'd probably know him better as The Captain." Clint said, pausing briefly to let the information sink in before continuing. "We run weapons deals, protection, robberies, everything for the good of the city. We deal with the guys who would rather see the city burn. That guy in the alley almost gave up valuable information on us to one of our biggest rivals."
He was moving down the sidewalk towards his house with four bags of groceries when he was shoved into an alley by a large man. He stumbled and fell to the ground, groceries spilling out as the man pulled out a small handgun, aiming down at Tony. Honestly, what was it with people drawing guns on him this week? Did he have a sign on his back that said ‘Shoot me’?
“Then let’s skip the making out and really have fun,” Bucky teased, though he planted a kiss to Steve’s haw and stepped away. “We won’t get any free time now, thanks to her.”
“I hate pancakes.” Came the immediate disgruntled reply.
“I’m sure,” Toni gave him a tired, polite smile. “But you have to realize that you can’t keep him locked up in this house forever. He’s frustrated, but I think he sees now that recovering is not synonymous with being useless. But once he’s healed completely, you can’t keep him from the field.”
“As you should be.”
“I’d like to keep all of it,” the blonde glowered.
Everyone bowed their heads, both thoughtful and defeated as they tried to figure this mess out. "What the hell is going on?" Clint snapped finally, flopping down into his seat. "Everyone's getting hurt or taken or disappearing and I can't fucking take it! My baby brother is in the hands of some sick bastard and our fucking house is exploding and our own men are betraying us and Bucky is fucking MIA!"
For now, Bucky would have to improve his day by topping off his coffee mug with a hefty tip of his silver flask.
Bucky huffed softly and turned to the club, kicking the door open. One guy? He could handle it and if things got to heated, he’d make sure to call Steve. He stepped into the now empty club, eyes roaming over the scene. The bullet holes from the fire fight the night before were still visible, but someone had gone to efforts to clean the place up to open again.
Steve frowned slowly, ignoring that irritating feeling developing in his gut that he really didn’t want to name right now. “Well I’ll go get them before there dinner gets cold,” Steve hummed, moving out to the lab and knocking on the door before pushing it open. “Dinners ready.”
Tony hummed as he followed the others into the house, watching with a bright smile as Natasha and Bucky flopped together onto the couch while Clint moved to Bruce, wrapping the doctor in a tight hug. Thor moved into the room, balanced on crutches but a smile in place none the less. This was where he belonged, here with his makeshift family. Away from the power-crazed men and the cold labs.
It was certainly no greeting, and Steve appreciated it. He wasn’t in the mood for pleasantries. “I’m not hungry. I have too much work to do and too little of an appetite,” he refused.
"Clint," Steve barked, pushing him back. “I hate traitors just as much as you, but he still is Thor’s brother."
Bruce nodded and immediately moved into the lab, heading to the main computer and pulling up the surveillance videos from the kitchen. “Steve! You’re gonna want to see this!" Bruce cried and Clint beat him there, leaning over his shoulder as the others filed in.
Tony looked up as the large blonde from the other night stepped into the kitchen, long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail with a small, black-haired man following behind him. The blonde’s eyes fell on the dining group, focusing mostly on Tony. “Greetings, little one!”
Letting out a shaky breath, Tony moved over to the screen, eyes studying for any sign of life. His breath hitched as he spotted Clint in the kitchen, sitting at the table with Bucky and talking quietly. Tony’s heart picked up a little as Steve entered, pouring himself a cup of coffee as Bruce followed him in. Tony gasped and pressed a hand to the screen, a smile stretching across his face. Bruce looked fine. Absolutely fine.
He’s pleasantly surprised when she does. “I was finishing my last year at MIT. Bit of a genius with engineering- among a lot of other things. I was home for Thanksgiving break when the virus got out.”
isn’t necessary. I’m doing just fine alone," Tony insisted, sitting straighter in his seat. He was doing just fine sitting in the lab alone. He was sure there were cameras on him but he felt better knowing he was in solitary.
Both Obadiah and Steve decide to get a few answers out of their captives.
“He controls the docks, Stevie. You get in his good graces? We can get your supplies into the city without the need of Odinson’s truck company,” Bucky assured, resting his hands on the desk before Steve, palms splayed out on the fine wood.
"I just hope the others are on their way," Tony whispered softly.
Steve sent a rough punch into Loki’s face, knocking him out before turning to Bruce. “Get our friend on the first boat to Europe. No money. Nothing but the clothes he has. If I ever see him in
things
,” Toni ordered, turned around to meet Ty’s shocked expression.
Clint stepped forward, fists clenched tightly but Bruce’s comforting hand on his arm was enough to keep him back. “You’re my best friend, Rogers. And you
“To be fair, Odinson was pretty clear that, if Jane were ever to get pregnant, he was gonna step back from business and keep a low profile for a while,” Bucky hummed, eyes scanning over the sports section. “Just because you want to keep your business flowing doesn’t mean Thor should keep putting his neck on the line with a baby on the way.”
“You’re gonna be deep shit if you don’t give the kid back his wallet,” Steve growled, flicking the safety of his gun off. “He’s under my protection. Now you have until the count of three to give him back his wallet.”
Steve listened to the sound of the shower starting. “I should fire you, you know.”
Phone call, then. Toni bent over the sink to spit out the minty toothpaste, rinsing out her mouth with a glass of water before she opened the bathroom door and entered the bedroom. “Who was that?”
Bruce put a hand on Clint's shoulder, giving him a soft look. "We'll figure this out, okay? Tony's smart, he'll figure out a way to help us find him. And I believe whoever has Tony, has Bucky. I think it's the same person behind all of this. We just have to find out who."
eyes. Bucky could tell she appreciated what he was doing now, making her feel less vulnerable after opening herself up. He was going to make a shitty joke about Toni’s presences bringing their group up to a total of four functioning arms, but Steve’s voice beat him to it.
Toni rolled her eyes, and shook her head. “The only person I need to count on is myself. Having a group would only slow me down.”
Realization dawned on Steve visibly, blue eyes sparking with interest. If Steve was able to get on Toni’s good side, she could put in a good word to Howard and Steve would be back on track in no time. “This could actually work. But how would I even cross paths with her?”
Steve tugged the phone away from his ear, whirling around to level Toni with a dark look. “Are you fucking serious, Stark? I don’t have time for the fucking contracts,” Steve hissed lowly, before turning back to the phone. “No, I don’t want the police involved, Nat. Only as a last resort.”
This made Obadiah from as he took the tablet, studying the surveillance video the agent had pulled. He watched as a man and women slipped into the door, moving down the hallway before the man gave the red-headed woman a boost into one of the vents overhead before he followed. “Well, it looks like the Captain has finally sent some agents from us to play with,” Obadiah grinned.
The sound of early afternoon traffic drifted through the apartment’s open windows, accented by the occasional breeze that filtered in. Toni moved from the bedroom at a quick pace, hurried hands twisting her dark curls up into a bun while her eyes scanned the living room for her phone. Two bobby pins were clamped between her lips, before they were freed only to help pin her hair in place. Ty was settled on the couch before the television, feet propped on the coffee table and a bored expression on his face as he examined the laptop perched on his lap. There was an emptied glass on the table beside his feet that had Toni rolling her eyes. “It’s noon. A bit early for a drink, don’t you think?” she asked, making a sound of victory when she located her phone on the corner of the bookshelf.
“-navy.”
Bruce huffed a laugh in disbelief, shaking his head and gripping Clint’s arm as the brother typed away.
“Steve’s house,” Bucky agreed, dark eyes watching the slight tremor in the brunette’s hands as she flicked on her turn signal. A moment of silence filled the car, the adrenaline of escaping such a dangerous situation giving way to an eerie calm filled with tension and fear. Gripping at his shoulder and taking a breath, Bucky pushed himself forward to look around the driver’s seat and get a better look at Toni’s profile. “Are you alright?”
Toni nodded slowly, glancing over his shoulder towards Steve at the table. She looked perplexed, deep in thought. It was a start. Satisfied with that he was off, taking the stairs to the second floor of the ballroom in search of his next target for a conversation not as polite as this one.
Rhodey readily caught her as she dove forward into his arms, standing up and lifting her with him. He turned to take a seat on the end of the bed, Toni settled in his lap with her face pressed into his shoulder. After a moment, a sob racked through her small body and Rhodey tightened his grip around her. “It’s okay to feel, baby girl. You know it is. Holding all this in isn’t going to help you. Nothing better for a clean reset than getting it all out,” he whispered encouragingly against her ear.
When Bucky moved his arms under Toni in an effort to lift her up, he was surprised to find the girl already half awake- well, her eyes were half-lidded, but she made no protest as Bucky pulled her up against his chest.
And Bucky actually thought Steve wanted to fix things with her. What a joke. This was the Steve she knew him to be, cutthroat and all about his business. The same Steve that used her to get to her father. Steve was a good guy? Steve meant well? Steve wanted to apologize? What a bunch of bullshit Bucky was feeding her. Probably something to keep her at bay while Steve continued to screw her over. “Listen, asshole, I don’t know what your fucking problem is, I just wanted the contracts,” Toni snapped, reaching forward and grabbing Steve’s arm to force the blonde to face her again. “Look, you want to be unhelpful and rude? Fine. Just point me towards Barnes so I can get this contracts for my father.”
"Just try to stall for as long as you can, alright? Will figure out a way to get a message to them," Bucky reassured. “Whether its through note or bribe or even a signal. I mean-"
“You’d like him, Tony.” Clint commented as he sat down with his own plate of pancakes. “Into all the science and tech crap you like.”
Toni resolutely ignored Ty’s mumbled “Yeah, who needs a son-in-law when you can groom street scum for business.”
Steve looked down, finding that Tony hadn’t moved from his sleeping position, but his eyes were open and looking everywhere but at Steve. “Hi,” Steve whispered weakly, biting his lip.
“You did attempt to rob us. Twice,” Steve admitted, taking her hand back into his and stroking her left forearm. “And then got hurt afterwards. Twice. You think that’s a sign?”
Toni’s eyes finally lifted from her lap, studying Bucky’s expression for a moment before trailing her gaze to his shoulder, as if she’d be able to see the injury if she looked hard enough. “Could hardly tell by the way you carry yourself.”
“Sure the Princess can handle it?” Steve smirked as Tony stuck out his tongue and crossed his arms.
. She wore a simple white blouse, neatly tucked into her black pencil skirt. Her crimson heels perfectly matched her lips and Ty’s tie, so coordinated Steve had to refrain from rolling his eyes. Toni’s soft curls were left down, cascading down her back in sweeps of dark brown. In her hand she nursed a glass of wine, blue eyes focused on Ty with a bored expression. She looked beautifully relaxed, but Steve knew better. He knew the lion that lie beneath, waiting for the first sign of weakness. “Some people would refer to it as being cultured, Mr. Stone,” Steve commented, taking pleasure in the way the smaller man whirled around on him. He stopped before the other man, offering his hand. “Steve Rogers.”
He could see the door when he heard Thor give a soft grunt and turned to see the foreign man slump to his knees, cradling his thigh that showed off a nasty gunshot wound. "Fuck, Thor!" Steve hissed, quickly shooting down the guard behind Thor.
“Good morning, Princess,” Steve greeted from the seat beside Bucky’s, glancing over his newspaper to smirk at Tony.
Clint gave him a look as Bruce scoffed. “An hour at the gym with you will have him sore for the rest of the week. None of you go easy.” He mumbled bitterly, obviously speaking from past experiences.
Steve tries to get a little more information while Bucky get's to know their guard.
“I brought you some of my old clothes,” Natasha commented, raising the neatly folded stack in her hands. “It’s been a long time since I’ve stayed here for anything longer than a few nights, but I was able to dig these up from the back of the closet in my old room.”
Steve frowned at Toni, confusion drawing his brows together. He had known this woman for three years and not once had she mentioned an interest in science or…whatever they hell they were talking about. Then again, Steve had never asked. He had no doubt in her business capability- she ran the entire business and charitable organizations that cover the tracks of Howard’s illegal profit, and that took serious finesse and ability. But for her to have hobbies? Genuine interests? Steve just never thought about it. Antonia Stark was proving to be less of the spoiled brat he once though she was, and more of an enigma every day.
Toni went still, jaw clenching as she eyed her father. He was serious, he really wanted to take on this liar as a partner. Toni could expose the man for what he did, but what good would it do? Howard liked his proposal, whatever it has been, and wanted him on board. And Toni was now out of favor for not catching the man sooner for her father like she had done many times before. The worry had disappeared from Steve’s eyes, as if he realized her predicament the moment she did. Toni had no choice. “You’re right. It was an oversight on my part to not bring him in sooner. I just wanted to make sure he was the right fit before wasting your valuable time,” Toni finally muttered, stabbing her fork into a strawberry with a cold glare locked on Steve. “But it looks like everything worked out, didn’t it?”
"You should be exhausted with how late you worked on Obidiah’s weapon every night," Bucky huffed, but his tone was gently because Obidiah was a sore subject for the both of them.
Tony huffed, anger crossing his face. “I have nothing to do with him or whatever the fuck he does.” Tony hissed through gritted teeth.
“Doctor’s office.”
“That’s where you’re wrong.” Bucky grinned toothily, and Steve couldn’t help the fond eye roll the expression elicited from him. “Because a buddy of mine let me in on a little secret: there’s one person that is able to sway Howard’s decisions. He actually takes their judgement more seriously than even his best advisors. You get to them, you can get to Howard.”
she’s more than that.
“Nice to see you in a good mood, boss,” Clint mumbled sarcastically, following after the man. As the whole group stepped into the alley, Tony made his move, moving quietly down the sidewalk.
Toni turned her attention away from the passing buildings and towards her father in the front passenger seat. His eyes were glued to the phone in his lap and, though his tone was nonchalant, Toni knew better. He was annoyed with the news. Toni shared a brief look with Happy when the driver met her eyes in the rear view mirror; his wink of encouragement did little to sooth Toni’s racing mind. “I think it’s a safe bet that you won’t. Steve seemed to be in too poor of a mood for conversation. And I would have asked Barnes, but he was, as I explained, taken.”
Steve regarded her for a long moment, jaw working furiously as he processed her cautioning.  She didn’t think her father would do this to Steve, but she also needed Steve to be aware of just how careful he would need to tread moving forward in his search for Bucky. Toni didn’t know why she felt the need to warn Steve against her father- shouldn’t she do the opposite? Shouldn’t she root for this kind of divide between her father and the man that used her? But then again, Steve would have hurt her in vain if his relationship with Howard broke down, and their business together did bring a lot of profit to the Starks. Yes, Toni was doing this for Stark Industries. That was it. “Leave, Ms. Stark. I have a friend to find and a business to tend to.”
Will the boss's interest in learning more about Tony hit a little too close to home?
Bucky huffed, tensing as his fists clenched. "They know you're here. That asshole of a guard came in here and took him. Said Obadiah was taking him on a little trip and hit me with his gun before I could stop him."
She could have just left Bucky’s pistol on him, but she had taken it to prove the point that she could. “I know you’re upset,” Steve started, holding a hand out towards his lover. “But take a minute and breathe, alright? We’ll figure this out.”
What he did
Clint huffed and moved over, pinching Bucky’s ear and pulling him to the far side of the mat. “You’re with me today, Barnes,” Clint huffed.
Clint moved around the house, shoving his clothes into his bag while Tony sat at the bottom of the stairs, staring forward. His hands were still shaking slightly, and he was desperately trying to get a hold of the situation. That man had broke into his house and practically assaulted all just to know what he was doing for Steve. Who had sent that guy? And why was he taking such an interest in Tony?
If Steve was surprised that he was there, he didn't show it because the man simply tugged of his bullet proof vest and worked at untying his shoes. Tony moved over slowly,  arms crossed as he met Steve's eyes. "You'll have to talk sooner or later," Tony hummed, taking a seat on the edge of the bed beside Steve.
"Are you sure this will work?" Steve frowned, taking a slow sip from his drink as he straightened the hat on his head.
“No, no, Steve. It felt fucking great to have the love of my life ditch me on my birthday for a woman he never even dated!” Tony snapped harshly, turning and slipping out of bed, standing.
“Because,” a voice started from the doorway, and Steve’s gaze flicked up to meet that of his second in command, Bucky Barnes. “I had Sharon set up the meeting an hour ago.”
Bruce shook his head with a grin, moving towards the door. “Tony is absolutely amazing Steve. You should keep him around,” he laughed, walking out of the lab to the kitchen.
“Thank god, we’re speaking English again,” Bucky joked, sitting forward in bed so that Bruce could secure the bandages behind his back. “I’m fine. Really. I don’t need everyone hovering,” Bucky assured, looking up to the doctor. “In fact, Doc, do you think you can leave me a few of those pain meds? I’d like to be ready for patrol tonight.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Toni glowered at the two, shifting back on her ass and leaning back into the couch cushions. “He’s not wrong. You did try and rob me,” the blonde piped up, scooping up a forkful of beans.
Bruce nodded slowly, rubbing Clint’s back. “It isn’t over yet, Clint. We’ll find him and Bucky and everything will go back to normal."
She was right, he realized. Even if he went on patrol tonight, there was no chance he’d gain any ground in this war by himself in one night. If they were going to win, they would have to play this smart and playing smart requires time. “I guess you’re right. Just because I’m stuck here doesn’t mean I’m not able to help.”
Justin huffed softly, shaking his head. “Everything. A large stone wall surrounds the place; the only entrance is the main gate. He has a group of guards with trained attack dogs that patrol the perimeter hourly. Alarm systems and spot lights are set up at each corner. Guards are posted at every entrance to the main house, except for the delivery door at the far left side of the back of the house. Stark and Barnes are kept in the lab, where an agent is posted to watch them after that stunt Tony pulled with contacting you guys. The lab is at the end of the hall in the west wing of the house, where a security camera watches them.”
Bucky hung up the phone, tipping his head back against the window. His head was killing him and his chest felt like it was on fire, but other than that? Bucky was willing to admit it was a
“I regret wearing navy,” she began cautiously, and Steve pointed ignored how Bucky raised his scotch glass in a mock toast in the corner of his eye. “If only because Ty’s been complaining about how dull we look. But I wasn’t here to make a statement anyhow.”
The tension in Toni’s shoulders relaxed marginally, and Bucky had the feeling she found his intrusion more welcome than anyone else’s. She straightened and turned on the stool, watching Bucky approach the bar with a small smile. “It takes very little to keep me going,” she joked.
. Maybe his time would be better spent trying to get a few minutes of sleep. Anything to build up his strength for the next time the lackey inevitably visited. Bucky’s eyes were already drifting shut, though it was impossible to tell whether he really got any sleep or not because he was jolted to full attention by the sound of the door of his makeshift cell opening. There was the click of a switch, and light once again flooded through the fibers of the sack over his head. One set of footsteps descended the stairs slowly, and Bucky steeled himself. “Alright, fucker. Let’s get this over with,” he spat out. He was met with a sharp inhale, before an all too familiar feminine voice met his ears.
Stubborn woman, so unwilling to admit any weakness. Steve’s grip tightened on the back of the chair and he took a long breath. “It’s alright to admit that I was harsh with you, Ms. Stark. Neither of us held back.”
“I brought you some tea. You look like you need something to calm your nerves.”
“Who are you?” he asked, brow furrowed in confusion as he glanced up to the rope restraining him again. “What do you want?”
“Not hungry.”
“She certainly acts like one,” Bucky muttered. Despite his harsh words, Bucky shrugged off his flannel shirt, sliding her good arm through one sleeve before folding the other side over her shoulder. He buttoned it once in the middle to make sure her sling was covered. At Steve’s raised brow, Bucky looked away with a shrug. “It’s to prevent her from going into shock. You weren’t wrong: she’s in a lot of pain and she’s going to be for a while.”
“Huh. Does dad know you’re helping out?” She supposed her father would be happy to hear that Ty was taking more interest in associating with Howard’s men and being a team player with the business.
It took Clint all of ten seconds to punch Loki unconscious and now, they were throwing the limp and bound body in the back of the car. The car ride started in silence, all three men too deep in there thoughts to speak. It was Bucky who finally broke the silence, shifting in the back seat to lean forward. “Who do you think has Tony?"
How could he have done this? How could he have let his designs fall into the wrong hands? Now, Stane would use his weapon to take down Steve and Clint and the rest of the people who had treated him like family. Tony growled, the repulsor’s glow growing more radiant as he clenched his fist tighter. Tony’s weaponized hand shot out, aiming for his reflection as the repulsor gave a small whine. A beam of charged particles shot out and in the next moment, the glass was shattering and splaying across the floor.
The first few buildings were private residences, something they could loot on their second or third day in this town. Then can the general store and a lawyer’s office, a small government building and- “There,” Bucky murmured, stopping before a brick building tucked between two restaurants. The glass was grimy and covered in dust, and one twist of the golden doorknob found the business locked. “Doesn’t look like it was touched in a while, if at all.”
Steve snarled at the thought, slamming the emptied glass down onto his desk. “It’s not that easy, Bucky. You think you can come up with another importer on such short notice?”
She had to ask him about calendar. She had to ask him about what he was doing last night. She sincerely hoped it was some small coincidence, like maybe the meeting was actually rescheduled again back to the original date. But it was unlikely, and what would Toni do if her suspicions were confirmed? She needed to confront both parties involved in this; if she wanted the full story, she would have to ask both Ty and Obadiah. Obadiah was obviously aware of whatever Ty did last night, and that was odd in itself. His entire relationship with her fiancé was odd; Toni swore they hadn’t met outside of her presence, and now their trading business advice? Something was very wrong here, and Toni knew her brain was already piecing things together, but she couldn’t acknowledge those thoughts yet. She needed to get them in the same room and feel them out, get a read on their dynamic before she decided what the truth was and whether something needed to be said to the two or to her father.
Letting them in on her destination and its importance had been a risky move, uncharacteristic for Toni and how careful she liked to be. But the brunet man had taken the information happily, not appreciative of the knowledge itself, but rather what the knowledge signified: a step towards trust. A step towards her acceptance of this group. And Toni had to admit, she appreciated his reciprocity. She had felt vulnerable after revealing so much to him, but he had returned the sentiment and it was… a good sign for Toni. A sign that they were moving past the ugliness of their first meeting.
Tony shivered at the feeling of Donovan’s chest to his back, fingers pausing in their work as he leaned away. “Obadiah’s weapon. Isn’t it obvious?" Tony snapped, hoping to discourage any more contact.
“It’s funny,” Steve commented, turning his attention back to the papers as his fingers slowly and methodically uncurled from their fists. “For a woman who has rejected her family’s business, you sure do seem eager to stick your nose into contracts and other dealings.”
Bruce flinched slightly at the image, slowly filing away the papers. “I know it’s hard on all of us. What with Tony kidnapped and Bucky missing. Things aren’t right. But we will figure this all out."
"I’ll be sure it doesn’t," Obadiah growled, turning Tony’s head to face the television screen, clicking a button on the his remote and suddenly, the camera feed to the gym, kitchen and living room have no signal.
His soft snoring followed her into the kitchen, and Toni envied his ability to sleep so deeply. Craved it.
He caught up to Thor in the center, finding the blonde connecting the last wires of the circuitry before nodding to Steve. "The explosive has been armed, Captain."
"One more word and I will have Bruce patch you up without anesthetics." Steve snapped, slowly moving towards the awaiting car that Rhodey and Dugan were immediately packing up in.
He feels like shit.
“And if Steve’s unable to save Barnes- if the trash is even still alive- then we’ll know he’s not worthy of your father’s guidance,” Ty chirped, smiling wider as he leaned his head back to its original position and covered his eyes with his forearm.
Ty moved his hand from her torso to tuck the tag of her t-shirt back beneath the collar. “Send Rhodes my regards, then.”
Steve’s grip tightened as he pulled into the driveway, glancing to Clint. “I promise, Clint. We wont quit until we find him."
And with that, he left the room.
Tony shifted uncomfortably, hands pushing at the man’s chest with the sheer hope that he could escape. The blonde laughed, grabbing both of Tony’s wrists and pinning his hands above his head. “It would be greatly appreciated if you cooperated. I just want to talk.”
signal," Tony called from where he was standing in front of a computer Obadiah left for Tony to make calculations with.
about what they put me through.”
"Now, now, you're in no position to be making demands," Obadiah cooed as he shoved Tony beside the helicopter, ignoring the boy as he landed against Obadiah's valuables and weapons that were packed inside. "You are surrounded."
Steve sighed slowly and scrubbed his face. “Alright. Here’s what we know: Tony is making weapons to aid Stane in an invasion, using the bombs and probably Bucky to motivate him. When is the invasion?"
Natasha took a breath, as if a parent dealing with a stubborn child. “I gave you a sleep aid. Just strong enough to knock you out.”
"Who am I?" The boss grinned. “Obadiah Stane."
Tony sat on the counter, nearly stunned as he stared after Steve, clearing his throat and straightening out his shirt as Loki stepped in. “Anthony,” was the only greeting he got as the man padded to the fridge and took out a bottle of water for himself. If Loki heard or saw anything, he never commented on it.
Steve nodded, folding his hands in his lap. “We do. And we should all start preparing for the backlash of foiling their plans.” He was quiet for a moment, before his eyes truly met Toni’s for the first time. “Ms. Stark, I-“
Clint watched as Obadiah's body crumbled to the ground, stepping back in shock as his eyes slowly found his brother's, whose shaky hands were gripping a pistol from the back of the helicopter. Clint huffed out a laugh, moving forward and pulling Tony against his chest, hugging him tightly.
Tony sighed, hands shaking as they dropped back to his side and he looked down to the mess of glass. Tony took a slow breath in, sliding off the gauntlet and looking down to his creation. He could do it. He and Bucky could fight their way out and escape. Or they could die. Tony sighed, shaking his head and moving to the lab door. Steve wouldn’t want him to risk his life on a last minute escape plan.
Clint snorted. “Then you dont know Tony,” he mumbled, passing Bruce a plate of waffles.
When Toni woke, it was to a splitting headache. She was sprawled across a dingy couch, hands bound by a cable tie synched around her wrists. She lifted herself up to her knees, reaching her hands up to touch at her left temple only to hiss in pain. “You’re probably going to want to leave that alone.” Toni’s head snapped to the side, finding two men settled on the floor by the coffee table. There was two paper plates on the wooden table, a small mound of what looked to be like beans heaped on each plate. A candle sat between her and them, illuminating the small room in an orange glow. The one was the blonde she had caught, and the other must have been his partner that nailed her in the head. Asshole. The brunet pointed a metal fork at the girl, talking around a mouthful. “Not that you didn’t deserve it.”
Obadiah let Tony down a long hallway to the final door, grinning over his shoulder to Tony as he swiped a key card through the locking mechanism. “I think you’ll be impressed with this workspace I’ve set up for you," he said as he pushed the door open.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky leaned in as Clint handed Steve a plate of eggs, nudging the boss. “Alright, now you know you have to tell me what happened,” he grinned widely.
The boss shook his head, disappointment heavy in his eyes as he stood behind the mugger. “I thought I told you to be careful, Lou. To not get caught in his territory.”
Looking up, Bucky spied Tony hunched over the lab table, face in his hands as his shoulders quivering lightly in the cold lab. Moving over, Bucky placed his hands on Tony’s shoulders, turning the man around so that they faced each other. In the darkened lights of the lab, Tony’s eyes gleamed. With tears, Bucky didn’t know. Tony’s shadowed face did little to hide the frown setting in as Tony turned his head to look away. “Tony? Talk to me, buddy.”
"I told you, kid, I got your back."
“That was the same case. I didn’t have anyone there to walk me through getting you back, and you were my child.” Howard finally turned from his phone to level his blue gaze on Toni’s. “I can’t hold his hand through everything. He can do this on his own. He wanted the territory and the power- and I don’t mind helping him through small disputes- but someone is clearly challenging him by harming Barnes. If he wants to make a name for himself, he has to make sure people remember it himself.”
"Thank you, Steven. I worked with Clint at the range just the other week," Thor said offhandedly as he checked the bag strapped to his back filled with enough explosives to take down a mall.
Bucky slowly pushed himself up, eyes wide with awe as he studied the replacement. Although it was nothing compared to his own arm, which Bucky was still pissed about for losing, he had to admit this arm was amazing. They way it synced with his nerves and did everything he wanted it to do. “But who…" Bucky glanced around the lab he was laying in, eyes widening as they landed on a sleeping brunette hunched over a nearby lab table. “Tony?" Bucky asked, rubbing his face.
It was well after dinner before Bucky dragged himself out of bed, having waited until he was sure everyone had eaten and gone their separate ways for the night before he ventured out of his room. He didn’t want to see anyone. More specifically, he didn’t want to see Steve.
“Tony,” Steve whimpered, tears filling his eyes as he tried to pull Tony into a hug but Tony stepped away.
Tony snorted, fingers fumbling with a wire for a moment. “And why would you do that for Steve?"
Steve looked like he wanted to argue, but he also looked relieved to be able to stretch his arms out. “We can see if there are any residences around here.”
Obadiah decides to give Tony a little push to start engineering weapons.
“No, you could’ve. But you chose not to,” Natasha turned for the door just as Steve stepped into the room, and Toni couldn’t tell if it was coincidence or planned on Romanov’s part. “I’ll be upstairs to see if Banner needs any help.”
This entire chapter is a flashback, which I will denote from now on using time/place stamps at the beginning.
If her father was a part of this, what would he do if he found Toni aiding Bucky? But that was just the long term issue; what the hell was she going to do now? Help Bucky escape? They’d have to make it past two men who seemed intent on keeping the brunet man captive. Raza, who was a trained guard hired by Obadiah to head up his security, and Ty, her fiancé. Her
, was guilty. He had been acting so strange lately that Toni wouldn’t put it past him to pull a stunt like this. The real question, however, was whether her father was in on this plan. Were Obadiah and Ty following orders from her father, or were they acting on their own? Had Steve been right? Was Bucky’s disappearance her father’s doing? Did her dad do this?
Bucky shushed him softly, sending a sharp glare at Donovan for the smug look the agent had. “It’s okay, Tony. Just rest,” Bucky murmured soothingly in his ear, fingers brushing through his wet hair.
“Sounds like a plan. Take the backpacks,” Bucky requested, curling Toni towards his chest and continuing on. “We’re coming up on a dirt road. Let’s see where it goes.”
“Much,” Tony nodded, slowly leaning back against Steve’s chest as he closed his eyes.
Tony huffed as he was pushed onto the roof of the manor where a helicopter was waiting to take off, blades spinning idly. Obadiah's hand was clamped tightly over his shoulder to keep him in line. "Where are we going?" He snapped to the older man, watching the sick grin that stretched over his face.
Tony doesn’t catch all that she says. Something about an oasis and death, but whatever. At the very least, he can tell she’s quoting something. “What?”
Touch me again
She gets what he's saying instantly. Luckily, Cho has foresight and always comes prepared for any situation. She digs in her bag that she left on the counter. "Here," she tosses a vial at him and he catches it. He manages to down it in one gulp before one of the goons gets close and forces him to his knees.
think about everything. He can’t. It’s not… it’s not even that he’s angry or hurt, because he is in every way a person can be, but it’s more that he can’t think about everything they could have had.

Tony contemplates his life choices. Has a couple of revelations. He learns of loads of new Avengers, and gets a history lesson. Not necessarily in that order. oh what a wonderful world.
The moment lost, Tony smiles sadly and lets it drop. He look at the new arrival.
“It was better for you not to think your brother’s safety depended on where your loyalty was,” Tony replies softly.
Steve wants to hug him. Wants to hold him so, so badly. But he can’t. He shouldn’t. It’s not fair to Tony. To… to touch him when Steve has-- when Steve has hurt him so badly. He doesn’t deserve it. Doesn’t deserve the trust Tony still has in him. He doesn’t
"Forever and A Day, My Love"
Tony's back to puzzled again. "I don't understand." His brow creases and his stress is abundantly clear.
He meets this world's Tony. It's both excellent and terrifying. Terrifying, because he hears about all the shit that's happened to him, and all that the team has been through. But... Tony is also jealous of Stark. The team has been together a long time, and there's a lot of trust there that his own team just hasn't had time to build. He can't believe Stark started hero-ing so
Barton doesn't sound like he hates him, which is another oddity occurring on this very, very odd day he's having.

anywhere." Tony smirks.
Tony is tired all of the time. It shouldn’t surprise him, really, that he feels like such shit. He’d spent a good hour freezing in that wasteland before FRIDAY had shown up with the chopper. He knew T’Challa had followed him, of course, he wasn’t an idiot and he had the best scanners in the world. What surprised him was that T’Challa had made nice with Barnes and helped the two supersoldiers escape while leaving Tony high and dry. Just
“You look good, Tony, for just having a building fall on you.”

“Rhodey…” Tony puts on his best puppy-dog face.
If so, Tony cups the porcelain cup between his hands and stares down at the still liquid, that would make a lot of sense. Perhaps he should confer with--
“Thanks,” the brunet’s brow furrows, “but you’re not… mad?”
“You are ridiculously silly,” she says.
angry at her or vice versa that they just sit down face to face. He said sometimes they just yell at each other for hours, but other times they talk or stare and–” Steve flushes bright red “–‘kiss and make up’.”
"Ross? What the hell? Where's your warrant? FRIDAY, how'd he get in here?"
“Thanks, Mom.” Tony grouches, but he still eats. His stomach twists a little bit, however he does manage to keep the meal down.
“It is Doctor Cho, Boss.”
“Incorrigible,” she mutters.
He doesn't like what he sees. His heart thuds in his ears and he clutches the sheets hard enough that his knuckles pop and turn bone-white. "Jacey, are you saying-?"
Jacey’s voice softens instantly, “

"I know... I know you're still mad at me from pushing too hard the other day, and I'm sorry--" She twists her hands together and dread is curling in her stomach into  a ball of nauseating knots.
She is understandably angry, so she goes to the gym where she knows Rogers will be. He’s beating up a punching bag when she arrives. She pauses and watches for a moment. It’s clear that he’s not at all paying attention or trying to better his skills. He’s taking out all of his frustration on the object and that’s all.
"Is that so? Where is he then?"
"We have the time stone, the reality stone, and the space stone. Vision has the mind stone, and the power stone is... off-world. There's only one we're not sure of."
Steve bites his lip and his eyes shift down in shame. “Not this time. I’ll even swear on my Ma’s grave.”
Steve’s eyes are going a little wild, and Tony knows he’s probably going to go on a rampage sooner than later, but he focuses on Tony’s face and answers the best he can. “Y-yeah. We all did. Tony, we all signed. Tony I’m so, so sorry. I didn’t mean to yell– I don’t–”
And stares and stares and stares some more.
Tony is 1000% done with this man's shit. "You are trespassing, Ross. Leave."
He’d thought that that was okay. He’d been alone before, after all. This… the team shouldn’t be affecting him this way. Why was it affecting him this way?
“I’d ask you to explain why you have pneumonia, bronchitis, sepsis,

fault? I didn’t understand it then, and I definitely don’t now.”
“Please,” the engineer begs softly.
“You’re not going into rut, are you?” Scott asks absentmindedly.
The door blasts open and Tony flies into the opposite wall with a hard thud. He doesn’t get up.
“But– Why would Tony–?”
She notices that he noticed. She shrugs and gives a wry, weary grin. “I’ve got issues too, believe it or not.”
“Coupla nice pair o’ shoes work for you?”
, that he’s sorry for Siberia and for not trusting Tony.
"'Spider-kid'," Tony chuckles quietly and shakes his head with amusement. "Yep. And Pepper, too, I guess? Technically?"
“What?” Sam stares at her.
"This-- this one is gonna be bad, Vis, I can feel it."
Jacey arches a brow and then her lips slowly quirk into a devilish smile, “Lemon, huh? Be careful what you wish for…”
He thinks of all the people he’s met and their smiling faces. He thinks of his little Avengers family that ended up just as well as his biological one. He thinks what the two babies he’d have would grow up to look like… if he’d have to grow used to Steve’s face on of them.
Strange looks confused and then looks at where Tony’s gesturing. “Oh, right. Of course.” The doctor comes over and skillfully pulls out any… inconveniences embedded in his body. It’s quick and not very fun, but Strange seems to be in a hurry.
"The what phone?"
sorry again for the delay. (i know it's been a long time; y'all are rockstars) i love you guys so much. please send me love!
He finds the emotion troubling, as he does most of them.
Life would do that to him. It liked roughing him up a bit, sending him through a nasty tornado and hoping to see if he’d come out in one piece on the other side. Sometimes he did. Sometimes… well, he’d come out.
“Jesus,” Tony gasps, “and you’re at
," Reed agrees, "How is it possible that you come from 13 years in the future? All the other realities we've encountered have pretty much been on the same timeline as us!"
Tony’s heart twists and his stomach fills with butterflies, and despite everything he knows–everything he’s afraid of–he’ll give Steve another chance. Not… not romantically. Not yet. Tony doesn’t know if he’ll ever be ready for a long-term relationship again, after Pepper, but he lets himself believe that maybe he and Steve could possibly be friends.
Tony flinches a little and stiffens.
"Cap," Tony greets and sips his latte.
“You’re not, though, are you? You definitely weren’t when Ross confronted us, and you definitely aren’t now. Give me some credit, alright?”
“The hormones,” Helen nodded, “they switched off. The inducers didn’t work.”
"We've tracked them all down," Reed clasps his hands together and looks distraught.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cho stares at the only number listed. She dials. She hears Rogers’ voice come through. “
["Hey, what's up? Do you need food or something? I just got done with my last patient, so I'll be--"]
The first thing Tony thinks when he wakes is:
Tony’s hackles rise and he stiffens. His mouth presses into a thin line and he plasters his paparazzi smile onto his face. “Sure thing.”
“Captain. You’re a strategic genius, I’m sure you can pinpoint the exact point in time when such an
"They do." To some degree. "It's just not very effective."
Well, a small smiles quirks up his lips, he did run her pretty ragged in the beginning.
“It takes two to tango.” Tony sticks his hands in his pockets and resolutely doesn’t meet her eyes.
“That’s why–– that’s why he didn’t understand what was happening. He didn’t recognize the bond, and when he tried to break it because the bond was
Doc McStuffins merely nods and walks closer. Tony tries not to flinch. “Did you just call me the name of a little girl who speaks to stuffed animals she thinks she brought to life?” The guy’s face gives nothing away, but his posture does. Tony definitely went too far.
“Tony,” Jacey bites her lip, “I know it doesn’t–– it doesn’t make anything right, but I figured at least an explanation would… help.” She can see that Tony really wants her to shut up about this, but he needs to hear it.
“Walk with me,” she says when he’s finally within proper talking distance.
“No,” Steve answers quietly.
Your breath on my neck

“... What are you trying to say, Jacey?”
Tony barks out a wet laugh at the matching tears sliding down her cheeks. “Arthur’s gonna get mad at me for making you cry,” he sniffles.
“Thanks.”
He hums to himself quietly. And, honestly, has the toilet always been so far? Or is it just because he's so massively fat now?
Jacey tries to keep a straight face, but she ultimately fails and bursts out laughing. “Oh, Tony… you really… you crack me up, you know that?”
“Oh, that’s right, Steven Grant Rogers, I know you were fucking him. I also know that you took bond-breakers without telling him and left him to suffer withdrawal symptoms without even knowing why. You’ve made me very, very angry, Captain.”
“Sin? What the hell’re you talkin’ about?”
They’re sitting in a good-sized conference room when T’Challa strolls into the room looking extremely haggard.
His eyes shut. He's... happy.
“Well, when man would hit on wife… husband would get mad and smell like you.”
“Yes?” The door opens and his head pops up from around the corner.
“Good,” Natasha smiles dangerously and slinks up behind the supersoldier in the blink of an eye.
Also, please please tell me if you think I'm even a little bit funny because I like to think I am-- but if it's more cringe-y or too corny PLEASE TELL ME it's killin me not knowing if y'all get my jokes or not.
The question makes Steve freeze because it made him think of Tony. Tony, who had helped him through his last rut not even a month ago. He isn’t due for a rut for another few weeks, and, for the first time in about a year, he’ll have to deal with it by himself.
if he thinks he’s in the right.

“Hm?” Reed looks back at him with a raised eyebrow. “You say something?”
“I… I don’t regret Ultron,” he says dozily, “I regret what he
” The laugh sounds bitter and angry and heartbroken.
“Thank God, I was so worried. Are– are you alright?”
“That’s good, Rogers. You have a lot of making up to do to Tony, and you damn well better not forget it.” Fury crosses his arm and says sternly.
Is that what you call it?! Betrayal after betrayal-- so caught up in his power trip and his new
“I hope not,” Steve frowns.
Tony’s smile is broken and forced. He thinks of Bruce. “You’re definitely not that kind of doctor.”
,” the Black Widow threatens.
“Well, you were busy. I understand. Listen, Rogers, I want to know what the hell it is you think you’re trying to pull here.”
Tony opens up the encrypted messages on his StarkPad for Bruce to see.
Steve shrugs with a little hopeless grin on his face. “I didn’t have you to help me pick which movies to watch.”
“I’m proud of you,” she murmurs with a small, sincere smile, “for making peace with that.”
. That’s hot.
“Mr. Stark,” a gentle voice beckons.
“Holy shit, that’s Tony Stark. What the hell is he doing here?” A gratingly young voice sounds somewhere.
“Stark, answers, or you vill pay the price!”
UUUUUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH shit
"You're talking about magic," Tony lifts an eyebrow.
“What branch?” Because Tony’s always been curious and not always the most tactful.
(cough cough areyoustillenjoyingthis? cough cough)
"I'm so sorry, Tony, I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you." He tries not to let his tears fall on the babies, but he doesn't quite manage.
I'm so so so sorry...
“Oh? Is that so?” Rhodey lifts an eyebrow and then he gets scared, “Wait, does this mean that my razzleberry pie rights are revoked too?”
He doesn’t deserve to be forgiven, he knows.
“The… other superheroes are there, right? At least, as far as Strange and I can tell, they are. Or were. Should still be, anyways, we’ve got… well, Strange and I found something. It’s big, Stark, and we’re going to need help.”
Thoughts?
"Yeah, yeah. Just... sleep," the genius grumbles and closes his eyes.
Rhodey recognizes the insignia on the men's outfits pulling Tony from the car before he can calm down. It's Hydra. Goddammit.
useful
His thoughts spin and he comes to a startling conclusion that sends cold dread clenching his stomach and tying his chest into a painful knot. Tony wets his lips and tries to breathe. Tries not to panic.
If Tony was flabbergasted before now he's downright dumbfounded. "Public nuisance? Assault? When--"
“What?” Tony rolls his eyes.
"It's Tony, Cap. Or, well,
This time it’s a frozen river beneath him. Pond? Whatever. He’s cold. He’s shivering and shaking and he’s probably going to get fucking pneumonia from this asshole. He’d been having a good dream too. It’s not fair.
Steve gulped. “Yes, sir.”
“... Not long. I– he was due back home– his term was up last week. I– well, a broken bond is… unpleasant. I apologize.”
Tony’s weight staggers him, so he falls to the floor with him. And he
“Everything. All of it. How you came to find out,
FRUIT PUNCH hahahahah i crack myself up.
“Once the angae wore off, and he more or less had his wits about him… he was appalled by his actions, and found he remembered only small snippets of what he’d done as if he was looking through a ‘red haze’, which is where the name comes from,” Jacey swallows. “Steve… Steve wasn’t born with any bond-receptors, Tony, because he was a beta.
"Oh, Tony! Good, you're awake! Tell Steve he can join the nest, 'kay!" She turns her head to the side to burrow her nose into Tony's neck.
“Stane,” he whispers.
Steve sits up straight. “Yes, ma’am.”
"Your Tony? What does that mean?"
sorry not sorry
He's downstairs sitting on the couch with Vision and messing with designs on his StarkPad-- the news is on TV, the sound is quiet. Vision belatedly looks up for a moment and his breath halts in his chest.
She closes her eyes and leans back into the chair. “Well, another secret is trying to figure out how the puzzle fits together. You’re two different pieces, and both of you have lives that make up hundreds more. If you can figure out how to make them all fit together, you’ll adapt to each other and become like two extremely efficient gears in a machine. It’s the solving of the puzzle that takes the most time. All the rest is just a bonus.”
That seems to be the final key to convincing Jarvis because the butler steps aside and lets him pass. Jarvis stalks off down the hallway, presumably to the kitchen, leaving Steve behind to fend for himself. He doesn’t blame him.
This is news to Tony. “He wasn’t always an alpha?”
She doesn't answer for a long, pregnant minute. "Don't be mad, okay?"
“I doubt it. That self-righteous, pretentious prick probably still sees it as infringing on his freedom and as the government controlling supers.”
“Maybe, but we both knew what would have come if we didn’t. You made sure that the worst wouldn’t happen, Tony,
“Well, Mrs. Kirk, I don’t think you’ve remembered it at all. That all sounds very far-fetched,” Tony rolls his eyes and grins sarcastically.
"Yeah," Steve agrees quietly, "'oh'."
“Well. It blew up a whole bunch of people, it’s unstable, and it’s a poor mimic for Erskine’s formula.”
She closes her eyes and sighs heavily. "There's no easy way to tell you this," she murmurs, "I'm... the universe is mysterious in some ways, yet predictable in others. The universe loves balance, so on occasion the universe will create a being or
“The Superhuman Registration Act,”
“Honey,” Clint tries again.
His wife screeches at him from the other line.
Tony's brain whirs.
Ant-Man looks up to Clint and then to Steve. “That was intense, man. You… well, you shoulda seen the look on your face.”
"Jacey!" Tony's eyes are wide and he's clearly surprised to see her. Jacey sees his belly and feels vomit rise in her throat and has to fight her emotions to keep tears from falling. Luckily, Tony doesn't seem to notice.
“... They are asking to speak with you.”
Stephen sighs heavily and eyes the metal case. "The... stones; gems, or whatever you'd like to call them."
“Really, and it didn’t occur to you to think about your kids or Laura before that? I received a phone call from her, Barton,
“Oh, Rhodey-kins…” She singsongs.
"Stark--"
"I will go," Vision finally speaks up, "on one condition."
“And, Stark?” She says with her back turned facing the door, “I– I really– thank you. For saving him. I owe you a great debt, and I did you a terrible disservice. I am truly, truly sorry.” She leaves.
in his chest, but it’s his fault. He’s made his bed… now he has to lie in it.
It. Is. Not. Possible.
“You can come with me, you know,” he suggests.
“Why?” Rhodey narrows his eyes. “Did he hurt you?”
“That you didn’t want him to know, it means you didn’t want to take advantage of him. That you want him to be happy even if it’s not by your doing.” It seems, Jacey realizes, that the man isn’t totally hopeless. For an alpha.

“Tony,” and that’s Rhodey’s exasperated voice.
So I've decided that this fic is long overdue for an editing spree-- e.g. the really cringe-y parts at the beginning and the less than cohesive timeline. Now, because this fic is HUGE, i'm enlisting help. So if y'all wanna help me-- or if you know anybody who'd wanna help-- go through this with a fine-toothed comb I'd be more than happy to accept it. I'll be adding in details and changing a few things here and there, but largely the plot will remain unchanged. Anyways, as of now (ch16), this fic will be placed on hold until everything has been fixed. When it's done, you probably won't have to re-read it, but I would recommend you do.
Clint folds his arms and nods sagely. “Huh. Okay… So… random fits of anger gonna be a thing now?”
Mostly I wrote this because I needed to blow off all my anger and feels and idk I needed a way to work it out, no idea where this idea came from actually, but I figure I'll share it because maybe it'll help someone else out with their feels/
Tony’s heart stutters and his breath hitches in his chest. Steve… he… why…? He can’t believe any of this is happening.
It's a few hours later and they still haven't tracked down Tony. Rhodey is incredibly anxious, so he starts drinking. Then he gets angry. He finds the stupid flip-phone in the drawer where Cho had probably put it back. He glares at the damnable black plastic for a while before he caves. He needs their help desperately. He can't let Tony suffer, especially not with Hydra.
I'm dedicating this chapter to Right_in_the_feels who left me a gorgeous long comment that i read over and over to get me goin' like a dozen times, but I can't seem to find it anymore. but, here's to you hun. i have so so much more to say to you than that, so if you wanna hear it come find me on tumblr!!!!

They fall into an awkward and uncomfortable silence for a while before Natasha says anything again.
A shiver of rage rolls through Tony and he grits out through a clenched jaw, “Not from
Tony rolls his eyes.  “It was, at first. It didn’t… it didn’t mean anything. But, then, well we started getting along. Off the field, and on it. I started noticing Steve, and not just the Captain. I started… wondering what it would be like,” he murmurs, “if it

You took my body and soul,
Understanding lights up Jacey's eyes and she hurries to acquiesce. "Guys," she taps annoyingly on all the sleeping Avengers' faces.
"Hm?" Stark looks over at Vision and then turns to the TV.
Whoah, something bad
And the reason is you"
“What? Yes? Okay, yeah, alright, I’ve got a bun in my proverbial oven. Can we not talk about it for, like, the next year? Please?”
Tony feels a little defensive. "Hey, Bruce was there, too, alright? And technically, I think Ultron created itself? Thanks to the mind stone's... nudge. But, yes, I was... experimenting. That much is true. I just didn't think it would work, and it wasn't supposed to, either."
“Nah,” Reed wrinkles his nose, “‘Cause then I’d be affected.”
“It’s fine,” Steve interrupts. Scott’s babbling makes him think of Tony. A lot of things are making him think of Tony actually. Too many things.
“Coffee?” Tony’s ears perk up and his eyes stretch wide open. “Jacey!” He crows, “You are an absolute angel! You are my
“Well… Steve and Barnes were ganging up on you. I imagine a broken rib was the cause of the collapsed lung. Pneumonia probably developed due to the lung and the cold. Then, because I know you, you probably didn’t have the pneumonia treated in time if at all. Therefore, bronchitis develops on top of that. The sepsis, however, is the most concerning condition. I’m guessing those scratches got infected despite them not being very deep.”
"Yeah." She clasps her hands together, trying to keep them from shaking. She closes her eyes. "I hadn't meant to push. I just... I thought you needed to hear it, even if you didn't
Tony sighs. "I know. It sounds crazy. There I was bleeding out on my own damn kitchen floor during a fucking alien invasion, no less, and my babies crying next to me, and then I shut my eyes-- I die-- and I'm sitting here on a sidewalk in front of my father's fucking mansion that I demo'd

Jacey raises a very judgmental eyebrow and goes into another long fit of laughter. “Twitter,” she says when she stops guffawing for a breath.
“I want the schematics, Stark. I want the formula and the equations; the blueprints, if you will. You know them, don’t you?”
goddamn motherfucking Stone all over again, “I’ll fucking kill him.”
“Tony, look, about Ross…”
A corner of Tony’s mouth lifts slightly. “That’s unexpected.”
Richards eyes bug out of his head. “Holy shit, this is news to me–to everyone–but, wait, why do you need alpha pheromones to make you feel better?”
That makes the engineer pause and consider what he’d said. Shit. “Nobody.”
“Yes?” Where was she going with this?
For a moment, tears choke Tony up a little bit. “Do you think,” he bites his lip, “you could help me do that with… with
, how easy it would be. How
“To Wakanda,” Reed blurts.
"Okay?" He sounds wary and confused.
After a few gentle proddings, the genius opens his eyes.
Steve finds Wanda in her quarters. She’s reading a book by the light of a lamp.
“No,” a sad note in his eyes that’s gone in a flash, “I– well. Things came up, I s’pose. I haven’t had much time lately.”
“Yes, dear?” He grimaces.
"Indeed," the alien's eyes narrow. "The stones, if you please?"
Steve, Steve, Steve. All about Steve. God, Tony needs to get laid.
after appealing to the government; what would he do? He honestly isn’t sure. He’s always hated politics; stayed as far away as he reasonably could unless something life-changing was involved. But, as a Stark, he’s always been fairly visible. More so after he revealed that he was Iron Man. Here, though, in this world, all the heroes kept their identities tightly kept secrets.
“Yeah,” Tony sighs out.
finally
“Hey, Stark,” Reed greets, “Strange went to go talk to some doctors. We should be outta here soon.”
A rumbling begins and Tony cuts himself off. He looks around the room and his eyes fall on Strange's hair.

incredibly bored in the remaining portion of his second quadmester and his final trimester.
dead drunk and/or on drugs at the time, so I just rethought her formula, remade it, stabilized all the... dodgy parts of the serum's genetic makeup, and overrode the version of Extremis in her body with that one. Why? Has Extremis been a problem here for you guys?" Tony taps his chin and eyes the other scientists in the room. They're all grimacing, and Stark is very obviously uncomfortable.
Steve twists his hands in his lap and looks at Tony with something like... desperate hope in his eyes. "
also, i'm about to get really, really busy so prob will be another month until i can update again sorry folks!
god DAMN that took for fucking ever to write. I am so, so sorry, guys this was truly difficult to get out for some reason... but, luckily, I think I'm back on track.
“Ah… well…” Cho shrugs.
His head hurts. It’s nothing new, not really, technically he’s had the migraine since Ross had shown up and crashed their Avenging party. It’s been coming and going, and he’s been popping enough Advil that his liver probably hates his guts again. Pun somewhat intended. It’s exhausting, though. He tries not to think too hard about it.
“Mm… almost seven months, I think. Why?”
And, well, Steve really has nothing to say to that because he had at one point thought poorly of Tony Stark. He also never properly apologized for that either.
Tony is still reeling from the revelation that there's presumably no second-sexes/endotypes here. What a very strange world he's in. Apparently, there's also a lot of supers here, therefore a lot more Avengers. A lot more. Jesus. Plus something called the... X-Men? Who are mutants? What?
“Can I ask…” He trails off and looks very uncomfortable for even asking.
Jacey looks down at her hand and when she feels something nudge against it she inhales sharply. "That's-- Tony..."
Tony chuckles and blinks away tears. He’s going to regret giving in to that moment of weakness later. If there is a later. He can feel his body going into shock and he knows that with this much blood still pumping out, he’s probably hit a major artery. He is bleeding out.
“Oh, right, you guys don’t know who that is. He was a colleague of sorts. Until he went… uh. Batshit insane?”
“Yeah. He… no, he said he’d talk to you later, but anyways… he told me that when he and Laura fight– when he gets
“Can it, Stark,” she smiles.
“Wonderful,” Tony rasps, “how long was I out?”
"You-- you knew?" Bruce whispers with no small amount of shock.
Tony is thinking about his babies and the word 'incursion' when Barton turns to him and asks, "So, what happened to you before you came here?"
“Aw, Rhodey-pie, it’s only because you’re a masochist,” Tony teases.
It’s Natasha. “I heard yelling,” she says softly, “what’s going on?”
Steve's mouth flaps like a fish, which amuses Tony to no end.
“What the hell did you think you were doing?” Fury’s clasped his hands behind his back and looks disappointed.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Tony is so fucking grateful for those dynamic-dulling nose strips. Without them, Tony knows he would have jumped up on Steve the minute he walked in the room and climbed him like a tree. Or, he contemplates, shucked off all his clothes and presented like omegas did in the old days. Both would have been bad, but
“Yes. Yes, it is. Hello, strange man in a cape, how are you?”
Tony takes a deep, rattling breath and mumbles, “Pietro… is… in Korea...not… dead… tell… W-Wanda, ‘kay?”
“Protect him from the papparazzi, always have his back, surprise him with the little things, and tell haters to fuck off. You’ll have to earn back his trust and his respect, Rogers, and that’s not so easy when you’ve broken it once before.” She takes a deep breath, “He’s always going to think you might leave. You have to stay and reassure him. No matter what.” Her eyes lock with Steve’s. “Do you think you can do that?”
“Alright, send him up,” he settles back against his fluffy pillows and lets out a world-weary sigh.
Tony screams again, and Strange flinches a little. The alien sees his chance and attacks mercilessly.

anyways, i can't say when for sure i'll be out of my funk, but thank you guys so much for being so so patient and kind. i really really appreciate it. really. if i'd gotten even one - errr - unfriendly comment I probably WOULD have deleted my account, but... i decided that because i appreciate y'all so much, I dragged myself out of my slump and told myself "All these ppl read this and commented on it... and LOVE it... this fic is NOT shitty.

“Shut up, Clint. Stark didn’t kick me out. I left.”
What is
to being an u’hoa half. Tony knew about the risks ula kui mates faced, so he shouldn’t be that surprised, but honestly… he is. He knows that ula kui mates can have some kind of empathetic communication if they’ve been together long enough, but an u’hoa pairing? Sometimes they can go so far as to nearly develop someting akin to telepathy with each other. The article Tony’s reading also says that in the case of one half dying, the other is 100% certain to follow within
“Possessive?” Scott bursts. “Oh my god, she’s right. You

“I don’t know, Tony. I think the study said something about your biology or hind-brain perceiving some kind of threat nearby, and thinking that the only way to stay safe was to be hidden dynamically speaking? It was usually an alpha male or a beta male that were the threats. Was there someone around a lot that fits that profile, Tony?”
Tony shook his head. He didn’t want to think about such things.
“I know about ‘em,” he waves a hand.
“I don’t know.”
She gives a small, apologetic smile and comes to stand beside him. “I am sorry, you know. For… for leaving you like I did. I should’ve known better.”
“Stark,” the man does sound a little angry now.
] It’s utterly maddening. Maddening, because Steve isn’t being presumptuous or flirty or asking anything of Tony.
“What is it?” She sounds exhausted.
“That’s…” The tension seems to drain right out of Steve’s body and he smiles nice and bright. “Thank you. That’s wonderful. I’m glad.”
“You don’t have to talk, but I just… I want you to listen. Please.” Steve’s head is bowed as he pleads. A throwback to Tony’s entreaty at the start of the war. He doesn’t deserve this chance, he knows. Hadn’t given Tony the same deliberation, but--
about Thanos.
They look stunned and even more extremely uncomfortable. It must be Tony's gift.
“Yeah,” Tony responds in a hollow tone, “I probably will.”
"There's been an attack in Scotland."
“And you suddenly needed to use heat-suppressors and scent-blockers again, right? I’m sure Pepper mentioned a potent smell?”
“I… I wanted to talk to you.” Rogers sees Natasha, “I hope I didn’t interrupt…?”
["Jesus Christ, Tony. We need to get you to a hospital, now."]
It is not often that Tony Stark is surprised, but when he is he's flabbergasted.
“J-C-D-C,” he waggles his eyebrows at their terrible inside jokes, and that sets them off laughing all over again.
Steve is not allowed to use 21st century slang, Tony decides. Even if he is technically quoting someone. Why? Because, quite frankly, Tony Stark is going out of his goddamn mind. It’s just not

Tony decides to address the elephant in the room: "What's the SHRA?"
“I– no, sir.”
Tony is immediately sitting back up again and looking at her with rapt attention.
“Tony?” Steve knocks on his bedroom door.
Tony had just said thanks and gone on with his day.
Jacey giggles. "How many parenting books have you read, Tones?"
No, Tony grinds his teeth, the man is being

friend.”
"Tony," Steve gently interjects, "we have no idea what you're talking about."
Dread curls deep in Tony’s belly and he’s afraid. He pushes through, though, and just nods with a lump in his throat. It’s probably his heart (he wouldn’t blame it).
Steve swats at him and sputters, "Th-that is-- you should't say stuff like that!" Steve's eyes glance down at his chest and his brow furrows.
instead of what he’s saying, Captain, do you understand?”
She sighs. “Alright. Go on.”
“Do you know who I work for, Stark?”
Natasha is silent by his side and says nothing for a long time. He knows she probably heard what he’d really meant. She closes her eyes and opens her mouth.
“Stuff it, McStuffins. You damn well know that I know who Stern is if you’ve watched the news at all in the last decade.”

I LOVE YOU ALL THANKS FOR BEING SO PATIENT
century, but well… she can see there’s no point. “It is unfortunate that it took you this long to consider my advice,” she murmurs.
“A husband? Wife?” Tony asks.
“I didn’t think so. God, how were you all so blind and ignorant? How does everyone see this as
Stop it. Damn it, Tony, get it
Steve manages to raise his head to stare at the omega. His eyes are wide with shock. "Tony..." he breathes. This trust he's been given... it makes his heart ache and fills him with guilt and self-loathing. Tony Stark is too good for him.
The camera follows his line of sight to where Tony is being dragged out of the wrecked vehicle from the massive pile-up, resulting from the explosion, by none other than Hydra. He’s unconscious and bleeding. He’s pushed into a small car and then the car is driving away.
“Oh, good doctor, what’s your favorite pie?” Jacey inquires.
He wants to. God, he wants to so
Betas, Tony decided, were lucky because they didn't have to suffer through heats or ruts to get each other knocked up. Though,  male omegas only had unwanted heats during puberty (female omegas got heats and periods for about five years—their puberty— before both stopped all together and became optional). Alphas got ruts about once a month, which meant an increased libido and aggressiveness.

“Oh, well how about that.”
Barton, please tell me he's not serious. I don't think I could handle it if even the iPhone hasn't been invented here yet."
The magic man shrugs and just settles against the wall while the rest continue arguing about
Fury looks like he doesn’t understand, which is rare considering all he must know.
, Mr. Rogers, is that the compiled list of names would have likely only been known by one person: the writer. And, from what I can make of the fine print, it sounds like Stark did some work on the SHRA behind the scenes in order to ensure that
The kid seems to realize it too. “Uh. What… just happened…?”
It's lucky, Tony thinks, that he's not been terribly symptomatic with his pregnancy. But, then again, it also feels like he's not been doing much for the duration of his pregnancy. However, at nearly six months pregnant and on bed-rest, Tony is starting to go stir crazy. Also, he's starting to ache everywhere. His back and feet are pretty much killing him regardless of what position he lays or sits in. Then, there's this awful kicking that feels like it's displaced every internal organ at least twice, and feels like he's got one massive bruise on every thing. His OBGYN, the kindly Southern doctor-not-nurse, who's name is Gavin Smith, tells him that it's probably because of Steve. Tony doesn't laugh at the irony.
Fortunately, Steve arrives and he's bursting out of the cab to Tony and Clint in what seems like the blink of an eye.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony grins wryly, “You? Apologize? That’s almost as shocking as you agreeing with me.”

"Bruce, wait, did you just say you were stuck as the Hulk for three years?"
Steve smells so good.
DEEP BREATH-- get ready.
“He’s unconscious. Stable, somewhat, but he’s lucky the sepsis was caught quickly. Honestly, I don’t know how he went on functioning normally like that.”
They both grin at each other and laugh.
Fury’s face becomes one of surprise. “That’s news.”
, so please can we get on with rescuing Tony now?”
“No,” the man’s smile is horrifying and makes every nerve stick up on end, “I wonder how the famous Stark will react to a little… isolation, hmm?”
"I'm sorry," Stark says, cutting Tony off mid-sentence, "did you just say
The camera is following the cars when one of them blows up. Steve feels a shiver run down his spine and cold dread wind in his stomach. He feels his heart stop when he hears the shout from somewhere off-camera. It sounds wretched, heart-broken, and
It’s so quiet, however, that Jacey barely hears it.
but was--what-- 'protecting’ us the whole time?”
Tony leans against the window and tries not to feel the cracks in his armor or the holes in his heart.
“So, this dude says to me, ‘I’d love to buy you coffee again,’ and I was like damn. That was pretty smooth. At this point, I’m so out of character that I think ‘fuck it’, and tell him it’s a date.
Strange's guilty face gives it away, and Tony sags further down into the plush couch. "Guys,
“Who’s–”
Ya'll wanna hear something funny? So, about february-ish I had written some stuff for this fic aaaaannddd I couldn't find it again. Naturally, that tanked my creativity because I was like IT WAS SO GOOD AND NOW IT'S GONEEEEE.
, so sorry, my bad. Does that about sum it up, Mr. Ross?”
Extremis?" Surprise colors his voice, like he hadn't thought the feat possible.
(also this fic was at like almost 140 pages before this chapter and that's... what? how did i write a novel without noticing?!)
Tony's eyes widen, and he's shocked.
Jacey. Thank god.
“No.” The supersoldier looks defeated and filled with self-hate. Tony doesn’t have it in him to preen.
Tony holds her hands and tries to communicate with touch that everything's fine. He... he may have a lot of regrets, but not this. Never this. It's okay.
Blank faces and blinking eyes are all the reaction he receives. "You gotta be shitting me. 3D printing isn't a thing here? Seriously? Jesus, how did I wind up back in the dark ages? Next you'll be showing me your NOKIAs!"

“No,” Tony says before Natasha can get a word in, and she glares. “We were just finishing.”
she’s doing it on purpose. “Right as I’m about to pay for my ultra-delicious-super-sweet-frou-frou coffee, he barges in and tells the cashier that he’ll pay for my drink to ‘show [me] he’s a gentleman, thank you very much, and not a pervert with an exhibitionist streak.’ Which is basically what I’d said to my friends.”
"What?" He attempts to sit up higher in the bed so that he's not laying down.
"Alternate... realities? Is that what you're saying? How could you possibly--?"
“Tony?” Steve looks alarmed. “Tony, no, stay with me.”
“You would have, if you’d all been sensible,” Widow hisses.
Tony… Tony didn’t want to tell Steve. Morning sickness was going to be a
“The team? Oh, you mean the Avengers. Why would you ask me that?”
"I don't know. Is that the press? What the fuck are they doing here?"
Tony stays quiet; brooding.
To say that Tony Stark was extremely disoriented would be like telling a rancher his cow was exorbitantly heavy. A completely and utterly obvious fact that most probably wouldn't even think to utter out loud.
Steve leans down and presses his lips against his former lover’s. “There.”
“What do you want?” She sighs and closes the book softly.
P.S. do yourself a favor and google what a gortle is. you'll laugh. i originally intended for it to be goose+turtle, but well. this was so much better.
, Shellhead-- and I’ve been a real shitty friend. Jesus, Tony, I’m so damn
He gulps and tries not to think about his leg or Steve. He fixes his eyes overhead and counts slowly.
p.s. i laugh hysterically at my own jokes. you'll see.
"They blame you," Tony says quietly with his eyes are downcast and his mouth forming a pained grimace. It isn't a question.
“I’ve got you a doctor’s note, honey bunch, don’t worry. You are only to participate in activities where you are sitting down, and exercise is to be extremely limited,” Jacey nods firmly.
Jacey cackles and snuggles into Tony's arms some more. "I'm not judging you," her voice is light and happy, "I think it's sweet."
“... I may have looked it up when I felt Steve fall from the helicarrier.”
“Good, you’re awake.” Strange walks in. “Here are your clothes. Get dressed; we’re leaving.”
"You should name them," she says quietly, brokenly, like it's any kind of answer.

Steve folds his hands together. “You’re strangely honest for a Tony Stark,” he finally mutters.
He’d almost cried right there until she smiled that one smile that looks like the sun. He could only smile back and promise himself that he’d never let anything bad happen to her.

“Your Highness,” Steve greets amicably.

third: this fic will prob have 17 or so chapters based on my current outline. which MEEEEAAANSSS: yes, we are almost done.
Strange clears his throat and coughs a bit, still avoiding Tony's eyes.
Tony blinks and is quiet for a couple of minutes while he tries to fathom all the possibilities that a name like that could entail.
Carol lets out a sigh. “Let me guess: you want me to claim I wrote everything in a fit of rage–no, of madness–and tell the world that, no, actually, I didn’t mean anything I said; it’s all

Well. That’s great. Tony continued searching and eventually discovered that an u’hoa pairing could begin the bond process through just a simple touch, such as a handshake or brushing of the fingers. Then he looks up this henkō thing, which, apparently, means that a previous bond has progressed into or become an u’hoa bond, usually from one of the other two types of soul bonds.
Steve’s eyes go soft. “You thought you were dying.”
Steve is quiet for some time. “

They all groan and make the bed creak under their combined weight. Once she has them slightly more alert, she asks them to kindly remove themselves from the bed because Tony would like his space now, please. The Avengers jolt out of their stupor so stupidly fast that more than one falls out of the bed. Tony tries not to laugh, but his efforts are rendered futile when Steve's foot gets tangled in grey sheets. Tony can't himself. He bursts out laughing. At Steve's consequential beet-red blush and pout, he has to hold his sides he's chuckling so hard.
“You didn’t tell him,” she whispers. And there’s the accusation Steve thought he heard.
“Oh, great. So you’re underage.”
“Ugh… food… can I just… not?”
Jacey rolls her eyes right back and swats at him. “So ungrateful,” she singsongs playfully.
"I'm... glad. That's all. Do you want help out of bed? You're probably dying for a
The road itself was overgrown, thick grasses spilling over the pale dirt and brushing at Bucky’s calves as he waded through them. Steve led the way, shoving back what he could for Bucky using the barrel of his shotgun. In his arms, Toni looked smaller than before. Her brow was furrowed and her jaw was clenched, the slow rise and fall of her chest the only indication she was okay. Bucky had to admit, going through a broken arm in a world like this was shit cards to be dealt, and the road ahead of her wasn’t easy. But she had handled it with strength and that was something to be admired, if she hadn’t nearly succeeded in robbing them of all their supplies. A broken arm was karma and Bucky refused to feel too bad for her. Bucky was so busy studying the girl that he nearly rammed into Steve’s back when the blonde abruptly stopped. “Hey, whoa. What is it?” Bucky asked, taking a step back before he jarred Toni too much.
The exam room had fallen into a relative silence- or as close to it as possible between Toni’s soft breathing and the shuffling of the zombie in the next room over. The rain now pelted a steady rhythm against the window, where Steve was peering through the blinds. With access to medicine for Toni and a seemingly untouched town for looting, Steve felt his nerves settle for the first time in days. Survival just became a little easier for the time being.
"He’s only twenty, Steve. You’re five years old than him," Clint hissed, eyes narrowed. "You can’t just take advantage of him!"
Bucky checked the gym while Clint moved to the kitchen, a deep frown setting in place. “Tony!" He called louder, crouching beside the shattered coffee cup on the ground. “Tony, answer me right now!"
“No,” Toni laughed. “No, that’s not what happened. The base was overrun during the evacuation, yeah, but dad made it to his plane in time. But I didn’t. Fucking tripped on the tarmac and missed the boarding before the plane took off.”
Bucky huffed as he lifting one of the rifles from Obadiah's helicopter with a grin. "Always am."
“She will,” Steve agreed.
Steve frowned and glanced over the table, seeing that the men were, in fact, escaping through the back door. He watched as Bucky picked off the last two men trying to make it through the door but it shut before he could get anyone else. One of the ceiling grates on the far side of the room was kicked out and Clint dropped down onto the counter of the bar. “They’re all gone."
"Are you feeling any better?" Bruce asked softly as he watched Clint walk into the lab.
Clint sighed, rubbing his face and slumping forward to rest his head on the table.This was not how he had planned his day going."Great..." he huffed, shaking his head.
"Who did you fucking work for?" Clint snarled, stepping forward as Bucky grabbed his arm, pulling him back.
. He had always been able to read her like a book. “I just…I thought I finally found one person who was actually interested in being with me for me. No scheme to get to my father, no… no grand fucking plan to keep me out of the way while they destroy my family and… and…”
