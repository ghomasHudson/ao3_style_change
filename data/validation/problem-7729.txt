He looks at the glossy-black Stark logo on the back of the phone, brushes his thumb over it, watches it change color with the natural grease on his fingertip. He upgraded recently, but it’s not one of the latest models. He doesn’t like the see-through screen in his office at the compound, and he doesn’t want one as a phone.
The gravel creaks under their car. The day is crisp, chilly, but the sky is blue and cloudless.
Steve pushes Tony’s robe down, uncovering his shoulder. He licks the bitemark, slowly, cleaning the dried blood there, and Tony feels soothed in more than one way.
Tony thinks.
Tony stares at the ceiling and thinks,
“Plenty of people don’t own a villa in the countryside here.”
“I did,” he says, and Steve watches him swallow around the confession, too fast and natural not to leave him ashamed, afterwards. “But we had a bad fight before you were born, and I was angry at your dad for a very long time.”
But it’s the worst.
“Steve.”
“‘Course it does. I’m a fashion icon.”
There’s concrete under him, snow and ice all around him for miles and miles and miles and Steve is gone and Rhodey is hurt and he’s alone and there’s no one to call for help, there’s no one, no one.
“Wha—”
And what’s one more partner for Tony, in the grand scheme of things, after all? He’s not saving himself up for anyone; that train left the station a
“The letter is from my mom. The last she wrote to Stella. Two days before her death. I guess she didn’t have time to mail it, maybe Jarvis forgot to do it, with the funeral and everything.” He pauses, touches his chest. “The necklace was my mom’s. It was one of her favourites; she’d wear it all the time. She had tons of jewels, infinitely more pricey, and yet she always... So I thought maybe it was something personal for her. Something that has to do with Stella, maybe, and their relationship.”
Steve cries, silent and still. Tony feels his tears on his skin. Steve’s pain is beyond words. Tony can sense it with his mind: he’s mortified, humiliated, disgusted with himself, and above all sad, but also relieved that he didn’t hurt Tony. Which is exactly how Tony feels about it, too.
“Not at all. This is so… god, I don’t even know. It’s flattering, and respectful. Poetic. I love it.”
Steve is back with a glass of water in his hand and he makes Tony drink it, and Tony tries to protest and not drink the whole thing but Steve looks at him and says, “Finish the water, Tony, please,” so Tony finishes the water because Steve said his name, and he said
“I’m going into a rut.”
“I really am sorry about before. I guess I have an image of you in my head and it doesn’t always align with reality. I’ve got no right to be jealous or act like I did. I wouldn’t have that right in any case. I’m sorry.”
“But what happens if they don’t?”
He sits up on the bed. His heart pounds in his chest. He looks to the side, and Tony is there, waking up, confused and sleepy, the light of the reactor shining through his t-shirt.
Steve leans forward and twines his fingers with Tony’s.
He’s rough, exhausted, barely keeping it together from pain, out of his own mind with need and arousal because fucking Tony right now is a matter of survival, and yet if Tony said
Steve nods, slow and thoughtful. He lets the silence fill the room for a while, and Tony doesn’t say anything.
“Buongiorno. Esci?”
“I’ll wait for you outside,” Tony says, because he can’t stay inside the chapel a minute more.
He fumbles with his hands between his legs. It’s slippery and too warm and his fingers, again, are not enough. He pushes them inside himself but relief, just like the afterglow of his orgasm, only lasts a minute.
Steve takes a ridiculous amount of pictures with his phone, of everything he finds even mildly interesting, and he catches Tony rolling his eyes a couple of times, but his expression is fond, not annoyed.
He looks far away, deep into the horizon, at the point where the hills meet the cloudless sky.
, didn’t you?” Rhodey swallows.
Except now he has a sagging body, and a cock that won’t stay hard for more than a few minutes.
Tony muses over getting up and maybe bringing breakfast in bed for Steve, but when he starts debating with himself if it would look too romantic as a gesture, and if Steve could mistake it for an acceptance of his feelings or a declaration of Tony’s own, Steve sucks in a breath, and wakes up immediately and completely, as he often does.
I had forgotten how strong pain can be when it lasts.
“Not yet. But maybe soon. I don’t know if we’ll see each other again, Stella. It’s going to be very dangerous. For us. The fight, I mean. And I’m just a man in a tin can. And what if we can’t stop them, they’re gonna destroy…” Tony breathes through his own panic. “But meeting you, talking about Mom… it’s meant the world to me. And I want to say thank you.”
“Stella, I don’t—”
“Don’t walk away from me, Tony,” Steve says, Alpha voice deep and domineering.
So, all in all, by the time he comes back home in the evening, he is
He wishes they could just talk. Just once. That he could apologize for real, looking Tony in the face. It’s made things easier, in the past. Worse too, sometimes, but Steve wants to be hopeful, now, since no one can see him in the darkness. He wants to imagine it going well.
And kisses him.
He takes a deep breath and pretends he’s not about to vomit from the smell of Tony’s blood.
“Then I probably shouldn’t either.”
He hates me.
Steve, following Tony’s lead.
Finally, an order. Something to grab on to, something that breaks Tony’s free fall into the hole of his own terror. His heartbeat slows down.
His scent has started to fade away from his pillow, and sometimes Tony sits inside Steve’s closet and closes his eyes, and he can pretend he never left.
She enters the room and sees her dads on the couch and doesn’t say a word. She just goes to them, sits between them, welcomed by open arms that only want to keep her safe and happy.
He tries to shake her off once or twice, but the cat keeps resting her paw on the back of his hand. In the end, he just lets her.
Tony moans. His back arches up in a spasm of pleasure, and yeah, there it is: Tony is getting hard.
The words travel inside Steve like a current, and he straightens his back with the shock they give him.
“Tony—”
What floods his heart next, though, is a hot wave of shame that cuts the air in his throat in the ugliest way.
That leaves Tony speechless for a minute. “Okay. What just happened?”
“It’s
He’s sitting under a tree in the middle of the woods, one of the roots digging sort of painfully into his butt, a ladybug crawling over the back of his hand.
Steve doesn’t look convinced. “I just don’t want you to take this kind of stuff lightly, because—”
Tony gasps, but no air makes it to his lungs, and his heart is a moment away from exploding in his chest.
“We will. Together.”
, and fell asleep while Steve was fucking him. And Steve is going to be worthy of that trust. He’s not going to disappoint Tony.
He glances at Steve now and then, gives him a lopsided smile, to which Steve doesn’t respond. He just watches Tony play, watches his profile and his hands, and thinks about who knows what.
“See them, you mean?”
It’s just a second, really, just a quick flash on his face, but Steve looks happy,
“Yes,” Steve says, voice cracking a bit around the word.
“Good weird or bad weird?” Steve asks, voice soft and perfect like only your Alpha’s can be.
, and Tony can’t help but smile at Steve’s excitement, because it’s honestly endearing.
The sight of Tony’s chest triggers a spike of guilt in Steve’s stomach, and he lowers his gaze to the floor. But he never finds revulsion in himself, none at all.
He doesn’t say the words with his mind’s voice, no, he visualizes them, witnesses them appear fully formed into his head, like an intuition, an epiphany, the unexpected breakthrough that makes you figure out the solution to the problem.
They reach the little river, and it’s not frozen over. Tony thinks that maybe they could follow the stream for a few yards, reach a place where the riverbed is wider and the water deeper, but he thinks better of it. This was the exact place, so it has to be here.
And there’s also the fact that Steve told Tony that he had missed him, revealing something himself despite the fact that Tony didn’t acknowledge it in any way.
Right. Because he is.
“Oh my god, Steve, come on. This thing is getting stupid. And we both know it’s not really for me.”
He feels so heavy. He’s aching all over. Deep inside him, where his muscles are wrapped up around his bones, there’s something painful. It twists in his guts, ravels his insides in an sickly way.
“Alright, gotta go. Good night, Steve.”
“Makes me crazy, Tony, y’know that? Your scent, your voice… These past few days I’ve barely seen you, thought I was losin’ my mind. Thought you didn’t want me anymore.”
the other way around, according to some messed up rule of submission.
It happens twice more. Tony isn’t gonna be able to walk for a week, and he couldn’t care less.
Still, Tony hasn’t shared the good news with any of his friends, and if anyone asked him why, he wouldn’t know what to say.
His mood brightened in the car—Tony could, slowly, bring him back from his desperation.
“Fuck, fuck!” Tony shouts when Steve has swallowed him to the hilt, biting his hand so he doesn’t come the second Steve starts bobbing his head
He has thrown up almost every day since the man imprisoned him. His throat isn’t faring so well, much less his teeth, and there are blisters on his tongue, coated with a disgusting white patina he can’t get rid of. The vomit is green and yellow and Tony stares into the toilet while he flushes it and wishes he could throw up his heart and die.
“Not at all. You’ll see.”
They sit on the little stone wall that delimits the tank, and while Steve works on his sketches, Tony taps at his phone, probably getting some work done.
“You said we wouldn’t have to walk much.”
“Hydra?”
to hate you, just for a little while, just to prove to myself that I was able to, that you didn’t really have that scary amount of power over me. That some of this was still up to me and me only.
“So,” she says while they’re all sitting at the table, “what do you want to know?”
“I am.”
Steve lets his arm drop to his side. His chest heaves with a sigh. He turns away, heading for the door again.
Steve takes one of the pillows on the couch, drops it on the floor. “Kneel on it, Avenger.”
I wear it.
His cock is now heavy in his underwear, so hard it hurts. He can’t stand the clothes on his skin anymore, and he tries to strip, but his hands are clumsy and ungainly, clammy, and he can’t grab the fabric. His strength is gone.
“So, how did it go? How do you feel?” Steve asks him after his first session with his therapist.
Alright, Father, I’ll marry him.
I’m here.”
After a while, Steve can't resist the curiosity to ask, “Anyway, how’d this woman know your mom?”
“I need you by my side, Steve. I can’t pretend that’s not true anymore. I need you in every possible way. Even as an Avenger.”
, or even apologize for not thinking about the effect that smelling the shirt up close could have on Steve. And it will kill Steve. He’d take anything, anything at all from Tony, even contempt, but not pity. Please, not pity.
There’s a bashful smile on Steve’s face now, his cheeks are very pink. “I did. And it was great, and I won’t allow you to take it away from me.”
“You don’t nurse her?” he asks, pointing at the baby bottle, and he doesn’t sound accusatory, just curious.
Tony is standing, talking to a very tall man dressed in a suit despite the heat, with short gray hair and very thick eyebrows. Tony touches his shoulder, smiles, laughs—bares his teeth, his throat. The man rests a hand on Tony’s arm to draw him close, and they hug, friendly and warm, for longer than Steve expects. The man hunches down, slides his hand down to the small of Tony’s back; Tony goes on his tiptoes, strokes the man’s shoulder blades. Steve watches Tony close his eyes, his chin nestled into the crook of the man’s neck.
Steve’s hand would slowly travel from Tony’s hip to his neck, and he would place it against Tony’s throat just like he did yesterday night, in bed. The thumb on one side, the rest of his fingers on the other. He would apply some pressure, more than Tony expects, but not enough to cut off his air.
“Oh, alright, then I—”
“Not what I asked.” Steve is careful about not pushing the subject too much if Tony doesn’t want to talk about it. He twirls his fork in his hand and attacks the piece of pie Tony put in front of him.
“What the hell did they do to you, I—”
“I—” Steve starts, but then he seems not to have a clue what to say, and he coughs into his fist, awkward.
Tony nods.
It will be brief, this respite. The next wave of the rut will be stronger, he’ll be less able to think. The succeeding one, he already knows, will be the one where he’ll lose it all the way.
There’s a long silence. Tony shakes his head. “I’m not there yet.”
Tony uses wet wipes to clean up as much as the situation allows. He dresses—sweatpants, a blue sweater. Boots. He turns to Steve.
He wishes he could climb into bed next to him, hug him tight against his chest. Protect him from whatever it is that doesn’t make him sleep. Protect him from Steve himself.
He remembers panicking. He remembers the control wheel bending under the terror in his fingers. He remembers watching the surface of the sea getting closer and closer. He remembers Tony sitting next to him, tapping the reactor to activate the suit.
They remain there, at the center of each other’s minds, Steve enveloping Tony and Tony enveloping Steve, folding and unfolding all over each other. A sense of protection stems from it, and it lulls them into a sleep-like lethargy. There’s nothing else to do except to let things flourish naturally between them. Let it happen.
“I— I am, actually. I’m very serious.”
And it’s a good thing. Because Tony doesn’t think he could bear to know that someone else has seen Steve look at him like that.
“Yeah.”
He sits up on the bed, and Tony rearranges his limbs to straddle Steve’s thighs. He hasn’t pushed him away yet, but he feels like he’s going to any minute now.
And yes, the waking up all the time is, you know, overall, to be expected. Because she’s a baby. But also, to be honest? What the fuck. Tony isn’t someone with the most impeccable sleep schedule, and yet he’s judging her, because there should be a limit to this kind of nonsense.
“Yeah, and trying to take me for a fool. You think I don’t know that half of Nat’s hoodies are actually yours?”
Tony wants him whole. Tony loves him whole.
A violent whimper shakes Steve’s shoulders, he squeezes his eyes shut, bends his head down to his chest so Tony can’t see his face. “If you d—”
T'Challa’s nostrils flare for a moment, and it’s a deliberate warning. He has too much self-control for it to be anything else.
“Nothing like that. Too many people passing by, back then. But we had our fun.”
“I’ve got you,” Steve says.
He breathes in deep, while what Tony said echoes through his head.
But before he can think or realize where he is and what he’s doing, Tony fires a heat blast from his gauntlet, and Steve crashes against the wall on the other side of the bedroom, emitting an inhuman sound when the air leaves his lungs with the violence of the impact.
“No,” Tony says, shaking his head, as if he could deny it by sheer force of will. “Dad was… I was a terrible child, always making trouble and he… he didn’t like me, but Mom… he loved Mom, right? He was a complicated man but… Mom always made it work. Right? Mom always—”
Except,
“And two minutes ago you didn’t want to lead the team at all.”
Under the shower, Tony can’t smell Steve anymore, and it’s good and bad at the same time. It’s as though he’s been held prisoner in a tiny box for a long while, and now he’s being released in a desert, big, yes, but too big. Too much.
He keeps feeling sudden little jabs of panic when he realizes he isn’t wearing the undershirt, then remembers that it’s fine, Steve knows now. He can still feel Steve’s fingers tracing the scar over his t-shirt.
“She would say I was her star,” Stella says, getting up from her chair and taking something from a drawer, “she said I burned so bright for her that I was her sun.”
“Mmh, go back to sleep, Tony, it’s early,” Steve mumbles, and closes his eye again, but he starts stroking Tony’s back, every time reaching lower and lower. Tony isn’t past wiggling his butt. Ha. Sleep now, soldier.
Steve is ashamed of how weak he is. The serum has never helped him with this.
“Changing the subject, typical—”
Steve scoops up some of Tony’s come with his fingers and brings them to his mouth. He licks them clean while Tony stares at him, the remnants of his orgasm still clouding his mind, and a smile blossoms on his lips.
Because he’s that now. He’s a dad. A father.
He’s despair and fury. He’s trying to chase a feeling I can’t give him.
But none of that had happened.
“I don’t know much, actually. It was during a mission. 2009, I think? Maybe before. Some doctor, no idea who exactly... Barnes was sent to kill him. Nat was sent to protect him. From what I got, Barnes’ brainwashing faltered at some point, and Nat… she helped him how she could, I suppose. He was scared, confused. They hid in a safe house for three days, guess that’s when they bonded, I don’t know. Anyway HYDRA found them. Nat ran, but they took him. And I guess they gave him a nice mindwipe and a new and improved brainwash to put him back to work.”
Steve’s warmth radiates off of his chest and onto Tony’s back. He’s not touching Tony, he’s very careful about not touching Tony.
They never actually broke up. Tony figured the punches (and the half-destroyed Leipzig airport) cleared things up enough on their own.
He’s free.
There’s a very long silence. Tony thinks Steve must have fallen asleep, but then he speaks, and his voice is mangled with tears.
Avenger. Not the leader.”
“Why were you on top of me!”
Steve decides not to push it. Tony can decide what’s best for himself. Besides, he won’t swim if his shoulder hurts too much.
now and then.
“Are you alright?” she asks, and Tony nods, even though they both know it’s not true. “I want to show you a place. It’s close,” she says, and starts walking to the side of the house, down the hill, into the woods.
Tony looks down at himself. “Not really, right now.”
, to say—
“Tony, concentrate on your breathing. Follow me, let’s breathe together, slowly, slowly,” Steve says, and starts inhaling deeply through his nose and exhaling through his mouth, and despite the fact that he can’t still keep his eyes open for more than a few seconds at a time, Tony does as instructed, and calms down a bit. “There you go, you’re doing great. That’s really good, Tony, really good.”
Tony licks his lips. God, how he wishes he could have some wine right now, take the edge off of whatever this day has been.
“I didn’t mean to do it.”
“You think that in ten years I never, even once, thought about it? We always knew what our bond was doing to her, abandoned like that. How many people do you know that didn’t stay bonded after having a kid? Or that split without breaking the bond properly?”
Tony gasps, softly, and takes Steve’s wrist in his hand, moves Steve’s fingers away from his chest.
“Really, though, Tony. You shouldn’t try to wake me up when I’m having a nightmare. Or at least don’t come too close. It’s dangerous. Maybe it’s safer if we don’t sleep together. I’ll take the couch—”
“I know.”
They stop walking when they reach a river.
“Well, he
“Why’d she tell you?”
If he wasn’t so unworthy of it.
“I don’t want to see you hurt.”
Sir, you are Iron Man, right?
And everything, all the drive he could have, the instinct of self-preservation, the spark of fight in him, all of it has been washed away by a man who looks like the love of Tony’s life. That man, that bad copy of the best man Tony’s ever known, kidnapped Tony and fucked him against his will for three months and five days now.
“I’m not, you know. A big fan of putting my head underwater. So. That’s… that’s a thing.”
Steve places his drawing in front of Tony and taps a finger on it.
There it is. The barely-contained Alpha rage. Tony’s already mourning the coffee table. He likes that coffee table. That coffee table is gonna be in pieces in a minute.
He focuses his hearing on Tony’s breathing coming from the living room, the conscious effort not to cry taking away all the energy he has left. Even in circumstances as awful as these, the knowledge that Tony is close and unharmed (even though hurt in different ways) lulls him to sleep. Or maybe he’s so utterly exhausted that not even anger or heartbreak or the serum pumping in his veins can keep him awake.
Steve sighs.
“I never hated you,” Steve says softly.
“Goodnight,” he says, friendly and somewhat cheerful.
Tony looks down at his feet and nods. No more secrets. No more fumbling in some dark room in the dead of night. No more pretending, no more telling everyone they’re just friends. Tony has always been worse than Steve at hiding it, anyway.
“Tomorrow?”
“Hey. So you
“Oh. You want to—”
When he’s finished he clears his part of the table, puts everything he’s used in the dishwasher.
“Thank you. Your opinion means a lot.”
Sometimes I get the urge to fight them off. I can’t take twelve men at once, not like this. Still, I get to see their surprise. It’s tinged with admiration.
Shit.
“I don’t know, I don’t… it’s been such a hard day, I don’t know…” he trails off, and his exasperation takes the form of a groan, and he looks like he’s already regretting what he’s going to say next.
“You sure?”
Tony didn’t even choke on the toothpaste. “Yes,” he said.
Which is good.
“You kissed me again and then it was over and I… I guess I missed the moment, I don’t know. But I almost told you and I keep thinking, what if… I keep wondering…”
“You,” Steve tries, but speaking is hard and his heart is going to burst any minute now. “You’ve decided?” he asks.
And then, obviously, there’s the sex itself, which is simply mind-blowing. Tony’s body is like a present to Steve, something made specifically for him and him only, exactly how he wanted it. There’s nothing he doesn’t like about the way Tony looks, nothing he would change. He could spend weeks with his nose in Tony’s gray hair, caressing his slightly round belly. He could lay on top of him, kissing him, for the rest of his life. He could get lost into Tony’s eyes and he would never want to find his way back home again, because that would be his home. Tony is his home.
“If you feel up to it.”
Steve is exhausted.
Because he can still feel this way, because he can still find himself in Steve, because he can still find Steve in himself, because not all their promises were wasted, because this thing between them was broken, yes, but Tony is a mechanic, and Tony fixed it.
Steve plants a hand on Tony’s lower abdomen and presses down; looks, enthralled, at Tony’s hole, leaking out more and more of Steve’s come.
The training is for the games. Once a week.
A rush of love floods Tony’s mind from the bond, so strong his eyes prickle with tears.
But then Steve stops.
If Steve could describe peace, it would look like here, now.
Tony thought himself past this kind of mistakes. He thought he was too old for them, too experienced, too strong-willed at this point of his life.
“How do you feel about this, baby? Me and Dad doing that? Hugging, and—”
, don’t go,” Tony says, all in one breath. “Please wait, just wait—it’s okay, I’m okay.”
He closes his eyes for a few minutes to think about Tony’s face, recall—with exact precision, the only one he’s capable of—the regular shape of his nose, the wrinkles under his eyes, his dark eyebrows, his thin lips. His neck, then, his shoulders, his arms—sinewy, full. His chest.
“Super good! I like it if we sleep all together. I mean, I also wanna sleep in my room. I like my room. But I like it if we sleep together. Sometimes. Can we do that?”
“I know you need it, alright? I know, and I’m trying, I’m—”
Put yourself in the other person’s shoes. See the world the way they see it for a moment.
“We are.”
“I just—”
“Salve, avremmo bisogno di due stanze per stanotte.”
Tony snuggles up against Steve’s body, presses his face in his chest, rubs at it with his cheek, and it tickles; it makes Steve shiver. Steve hugs Tony closer to himself, strokes his back, his shoulders. Tony lifts his gaze to look at Steve, small between those massive arms. It’s a long time before they avert their eyes, and even then it almost feels like a loss. What a strange thing, to become so dependent on something that you didn’t have for most of your life, on something that you had resigned yourself on having to live without.
Shit.
“Of course you are. You signed the Accords. T'Challa fixed it.”
“Please.” Tony modulates his voice to be louder than Steve’s, than anything else they’ve said so far. He grimaces, lets his frustration leave him through his nose. “Please,” he says, softer.
The first push of the blunt head of Tony’s dick is a heady mix of pleasure and pain that makes Steve go limp. He spreads his legs further apart, brings his knees up to accommodate Tony’s body into his. Steve has his arms above his head on the carpet, and Tony carefully circles one of his wrists and holds it down, hard. Steve feels something that can only be described as bliss rushing through him. He looks up at Tony and he’s very surprised to find that Tony is already looking at him. Steve gets lost in his eyes, it’s the longest and deepest Tony has looked at him ever while they have sex, and Steve is determined to make it last as much as possible, to use it to tell Tony all the things he can’t say with words.
“Help is on the way. Save your strength—”
He scolds himself, shaking his head. He should answer the call before Tony gives up and hangs up. After all this time with no contact, he can’t have Tony think that he doesn’t want to talk to him, that he doesn’t care. He’ll always care.
“I can... I know I can do more. I have to—”
“But you have a ridiculously short refractory period, right?”
“Shh, hey.” The kindest, kindest voice. “You hadn’t noticed how wet you’d got, huh? I could smell it since the first drop, all the way from there.”
The subject of the drawing is, again, Tony, in what looks like a museum, leaning with his back against a wall and fiddling with his phone. He looks annoyed and bored, caught while he puffs some air out of his mouth, the gesture ruffling the hair on his forehead.
The muscle memory is there, and his fingers are nimble enough over the keys, but the melody takes him straight back to that day Mom came into his room, excited for this beautiful song she had just discovered and wanted to share with him.
Not now, not again.
He can’t keep his mouth shut. It’s a litany of
He just stands there, wearing only his pajamas—arms crossed, feet bare, eyes lost in thought, mouth slightly open. He keeps very still, except for his breathing, soft but irregular.
For something like that maybe Steve would really kill him.
The other side of the bed—Tony’s side—is empty. Cold to the touch.
“She always wore lipstick. She never left the house without, and even when she stayed home she’d wear it often. She’d kiss my cheek and leave a trace. Sometimes I’d be annoyed by that. Now I’d give anything for...” Tony looks down and presses his lips together in a thin line, sets his jaw. “I don’t know why I’m fixating on such a stupid detail, but the book mentions the first time my mom wore lipstick in her life and I... I can’t—”
They spend the night together in Tony’s bed. He rests his cheek against Steve’s rib cage, and lets his strong, regular heartbeat lull him to sleep.
“Tony, I… I’m scared. It scares me when I hear you being self-deprecating, but you always play it off as a joke, and… I never felt like I had the right to tell you anything about it, after what happened. But now I… I felt it in my own mind. And it frightened me.”
A heartbeat.
He has thought about it. They have to spend the days in some way. Steve will enjoy it.
Steve waits a long time before speaking again, turning his thoughts in his head over and over.
Steve’s instinct keeps kicking in. He hasn’t felt it this sharply since before Sarah was born. The need to make it all better for Tony, to feel him as part of himself.
, Tony thinks, but feels bad about it.
He knows what he has to do to bring him down, and he’s ready for it.
They’re quiet during dinner. It’s not like they don’t have anything to say, it’s that there’s no need to say anything right now. Steve smiles, timid and hopeful, with his mouth full of the food Tony made for him, his eyes crinkling up at the sides, and that’s all that matters for now.
He feels like he can’t breathe and no, it’s not the heat.
“When are we going to Stella’s house?”
They’ve done it for years. It’s all they’ve ever done. On and off, on and off. Off and on again. Off every time the world was ending and they were at opposites sides of it. On every time they started a new team with renewed hope that this time,
“Agent Bell is in a coma. Fury has third-degree burns on his forearm. There was an explosion.”
He wants to bend Tony over and fuck into him and—
“You should use lube,” Tony has the presence of mind of saying.
“Uh…sixty-seven years. At least,” Steve deadpans.
And the weirdest thing of all, actually, is that Steve agrees.
Steve doesn’t know what’s happening. He’s distantly aware he’s doing things, but he feels as if someone else is moving, and he’s only watching this whole thing play out from somewhere else, unable to stop it.
Slowly, he gets up from the bed and walks to the window.
He breathes against Steve’s face, mouth open, and his heart feels like it might burst. He just killed a man and he feels euphoric; he’s never been happier in his entire life.
Did Steve just lie to him?
“Steve—”
Tony shuts the shower off, the suds still clinging to his calves.
Sarah moves to rub at her nose with the back of her hand. She doesn’t wake up, but Steve stirs and drags her closer to himself. His hand is so big that it covers all of Sarah’s front, chest to navel.
A jolt of fear goes through him, now. Steve just literally jumped his bones.
“He didn’t touch Mom, right? I was… he could… with me, it was, it was different, right? But he never hurt Mom, he never… I never—”
Steve leaves, and wishes the café wasn’t so crowded, that he could get back to Tony faster than this.
Tony takes off his glasses, throws them on the blanket, and presses the heels of his hands into his eyes.
He smells like a dream. Like a paradise, like…
Steve laughs. “Perfect. It sounds perfect.”
“Please, yes.”
“But even later, you didn’t tell me,” Steve says, and Tony is brought back to the present.
Tony twists on his feet and turns the oven on. He pushes the herbs in the mixer and presses down on the button, lets the loud noise it makes cancel reality for a few seconds.
Tony kisses him, deep and unashamed, his tongue meeting Steve’s in the most familiar way. Steve chokes out a muffled sob and Tony starts bouncing on his cock in earnest, setting up a punitive rhythm that makes the bed squeak under their weight, and—
“It’s better now, I don’t—”
Steve likes to think of himself as a brave man. Not always, maybe; he can’t be at the top of his game all the time, but in general, and despite recent mistakes, he likes to think of himself as someone who faces problems, instead of avoiding them.
And that’s it, really. That’s the moment. To hell with it.
“I do feel better,” he admits.
Steve inhales, and he doesn’t let the air out for a long moment.
“I’d better get going,” Steve said, walking towards the elevator.
“It’s nothing, really—”
“Shit. Sorry. Okay.”
“Bye, Honey Bear.”
“What did you just say?”
Steve drops to his knees on the gravel trail, tears streaming down his face, the hot air filling his lungs transforming into ice there—it seeps into his bones more acutely than ever, freezes him over.
When they step out of the plane, hours later, it’s still sunny in New York.
Tony draws his hand back, as if he’s been burned.
Steve takes his fingers out of Tony, carefully, and slicks himself up, for good measure. If this hurts Tony in any way Steve is gonna punch himself in the face. Steve rubs the head of his cock between Tony’s cheeks, hisses softly when it brushes over the rim. Slowly, timidly, he slides in. Tony spreads his legs further apart, drawing his knees up to his chest. Steve sinks into Tony’s body and is engulfed by the
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, taking a step away. “Do you want to shower? You can use the bathroom.” Tony watches Steve open a drawer, search in it. “I might even have some of your old cl—”
Tony looks at the side of Steve’s face, now serious, and realizes that Steve is, most of all, lonely.
“I know—”
The boy comes and goes. He’s busy. He hums a song while he works.
The gesture sets Steve into motion. He begins to dress.
The day is sunny and clear, and when he feels better Tony points at things in the distance to tell Steve what they are. He stands in the crenel between two merlons, and Steve positions himself just behind him. He can smell Tony’s expensive shampoo.
, Tony...” Steve pinches the bridge of his nose.
He stops jacking Tony off. He splays out his hand and uses the palm to trap Tony’s dick against his belly. He covers it fully, from head to hilt, and presses down on it, hard. He fucks into Tony one last time from behind, as much as the knot lets him without it being dangerous, and just enough to push against that one spot inside Tony that makes him see the stars. He stretches his hand just enough to roll the pads of his fingers into Tony’s balls, and past them, over his perineum.
“Bossy. I like it,” Tony teases while he does as Steve says. “Spoken like the true leader of the Avengers.”
Dinner proceeds smoothly from there, and Tony lets himself be proud of his cooking when Steve wolfs down everything Tony puts on his plate.
Steve looks at him, still doubtful. “You sure you’re gonna be okay without... I mean, two hours is a long time to spend empty during a heat, and you could need—”
Steve secures his grip on Tony’s hair, takes himself in hand, starts jacking off fast, never breaking eye contact with Tony. He thumbs at Tony’s lips to make him open his mouth again.
He’s okay. He’s fine.
“Yeah.”
“Oh,” Tony says, and he looks disappointed about it.
“Tempting offer, but the alternative is more entertaining. So, what are we gonna eat?”
When they’re stuck together and the initial edge of the knot has worn off, Steve opens his eyes and notices that it’s the middle of the day.
“Yes, sweetheart?”
No bite.
When Steve joins him in the kitchen, his eyes are red. He must’ve cried again, and Tony feels guilty about that. But it’s gonna be fine; it’s gonna be over soon.
A few of them come in my mouth. I wish I did not have a mouth.
“You’re totally doing it. I won’t fall for it.”
Tony looks at him, shakes his head. “It was HYDRA. Zemo. Ross. Lots of players in that game. But... you should’ve told me. You should have.”
“How do you mean?”
“Can you stop being so bitchy about it and explain?”
Steve smiles, big and bright, and then kisses Tony and fucks him a little harder and he says, “I’m here,” and Tony says, again, “Steve.”
Something uncurls and stings under Tony’s breastbone, and it takes him way more time than it should to recognize it as envy. He wants that too. He wants that too, so much. He’s sick of being alone.
“Doesn’t it go against yours?”
“Oh my god, Steve. Don’t tell me you—”
“I’m not.”
He just can’t do it.
“Remember the last time? Before you went to Nigeria.”
Steve parts his lips, allows Tony to drop the cherry in his mouth. He licks one of Tony’s fingertips, not entirely by mistake. He manages to not avert his eyes from Tony’s transfixed stare the whole time.
Tony follows the direction of Steve’s gaze, and his eyes widen in understanding. He pulls his shirt down to cover himself, and the gesture wrenches a whimper out of Steve.
A desert.
All these pieces should click together in Steve’s brain, but they don’t. He’s tired, and he—
“I just—”
It’s meant to be a joke, and that’s the worst part. Steve lets his arms fall to his sides, and doesn’t reply. He blinks back tears.
Just like he’s been to Tony.
“Maybe. Doesn’t narrow it down a lot.”
, and his mind is a hurricane of relief and love and something quiet that falls on them both like a blanket.
To reach the house they make their way through a beautiful front yard where Steve spots various fruit trees, a vegetable garden, dozens of different kinds of flowers, lemon trees in big terracotta pots. It looks messy, but in a rational way. It’s the irregularity of nature, of leaving things to their growth with only minimal influence. They grow with no plan, no foresight, maybe, but not without logic.
“Oh, baby.” Tears in his eyes.
“Natasha’s bra is on the floor,” Tony deadpans, “we can see it.”
“Let’s get back,” he says instead, but before they reach the house, Stella comes out.
He looks in the distance.
It’s a kid. No more than eight, Steve would guess, but he’s no expert. He has huge red glasses that cover most of his face, and a Wonder Woman t-shirt. He’s patting Tony’s thigh to get his attention. Tony crouches down to talk to him.
“What’s wrong, just tell me—”
Tony looks at Steve’s bed. He’s buried under the covers so much that only his hair is visible. And just, why? Why is Steve cold? It’s 100 degrees outside. There’s no air conditioning in here.
“You got anything for me to write with? Left all my toys in the house.”
“I am, actually. I was of Peggy too. Thought Howard was sweet on her… turns out she was even worse than me. She shot me once because a girl kissed me. Well, she shot the shield.” Steve smiles at the memory.
The sun catches in Tony’s hair, makes it shine, makes it look like silver, like white light. Like he’s made of stars.
“Yeah—”
“Makes sense.”
“You know, emotions… a lot of them, can’t be helped. We feel how we feel and that’s it. Nothing to do about it. But we don’t always act according to our emotions, do we? Sure, most of the time we do, and that’s normal. But sometimes… sometimes we go against everything our heart wants, and we follow the brain. We make choices out of logic, not feelings.”
Without wasting any more time, Tony rubs lube all over his dick and then makes sure Steve is still properly stretched. He pushes his forefinger into Steve, and—god—he’s already so tight again. He works the muscles loose with patience, tugs at his own cock with his free hand once in a while. He scissors two fingers into Steve, adds more lube.
he texts Rhodey.
“What.”
“God—” Steve says, and it’s a whine, a growl, a whimper, all wrenched out of him by Tony pushing into him again, in and out, in and out, in and out.
“Yeah.”
It’s been a tough couple of years, but they’ve made it to the other side. To the other side of the war, the other side of the destruction, the damage, the death, the two months Steve spent in the hospital that felt like twenty years to Tony.
Tony expects to have to convince him; he even has a little speech prepared. But he must look ready, or sound sure, or something else he can’t quite understand himself, because Steve nods and says, “Yeah,” and he’s never sounded so thrilled and he’s never looked so rapt about anything else in all the years Tony has known him.
He’s breathing regularly, slowly, still asleep.
But here, now. His body knows he can get all the food he wants and there’s no war to fight, so his stomach keeps making angry noises of protest. And everything tastes
“‘M sorry about… everything. Couldn’t say… earlier.”
He doesn’t mean it. Steve knows he doesn’t mean it.
Okay, then.
Steve sighs, heavy and sad.
It’s fun, doing this together, and it’s fascinating to watch Tony exist in this environment. His legs wrapped around the branch of a tree, his teeth sinking into the juicy pulp of a peach, his lips shining with it while he chews, unashamed, without any need to perform for anyone.
Steve doesn’t reply.  God, why is this so hard?
Steve wraps him up in a towel and leaves him in the bathroom, where Tony combs his hair and rubs his face cream into his skin. He hangs the towel on its hook.
After dinner, they settle on the porch chairs watching the last few rays of sunshine disappear beyond the hills, leaving the countryside immersed in a peaceful darkness only sometimes interrupted by fireflies.
, goes unsaid, but barely, and it’s bad enough that Tony thinks it.
At this point, Steve has been staring at the screen of his tablet for a good twenty minutes. He doesn’t know exactly what to make of all this new information, but he’s confused, and upset, and there are just too many things going through his mind.
“Yeah, most people think that. But no. During the 14th and 15th centuries the abbey was left in severe poverty due to famine, epidemics, a few raids. At some point a particularly stupid abbot thought,
Steve lets his head drop and sighs. He feels Tony’s body slip away from between his hands.
Everything inside the little house is white, except the floor, the oldest pieces of furniture, the few spots where the ancient stones that make up the little building have been left visible, and the turquoise tiles in the bathroom. Nothing is modern in style, despite Tony’s usual preference. For this place, he wanted something that wouldn’t clash with the rest of the landscape. He wanted something that would fit right in, as if it had always been there.
Steve is visibly reassured by Tony’s words, he takes in big gulps of air, opens his eyes slowly, he’s trying to calm down. Tony keeps him close to his chest.
“What’s this?” he hears Tony muttering. “Goddammit, Steve.”
“Before, I could do it just fine. Sure, my hand got tired in two minutes, but I could do it.”
Tony lifts himself up on his knees, lets Steve slip out of him, mutters, “This isn’t working, fuck everything, where the fuck—,” opens the first drawer of Steve’s bedside table and starts rummaging in it.
Tony’s mouth is distressingly empty, but he can’t close it immediately. His muscles are stuck, his jaw locked in position.
Steve’s whole world hangs in those few seconds of silence.
“Tony.”
Tony’s room is full of light, and the gold in Steve’s hair shines with it. He seems like an angel.
“Yeah, I– I don’t, I mean, I don’t have a strong preference, either way, it’s just that it– it can be– it can get too much for me so I–”
“We’ll… Come on, Steve, don’t say that. We’ll figure it out.”
He hears a few whirring noises, in rapid succession. Tony’s nanotech.
Steve lies down on his back because now he wants to watch Tony, kiss him, touch his face. He spreads his legs again, holds his knees up to his chest. Tony sinks into him even though Steve is far from stretched enough for it, but the lube eases the way and Tony’s determination doesn’t let him waste any time after he bottoms out. He just fucks into Steve, harsh and relentless, and he tastes like come and tears and how much Steve adores him.
Tony rubs his forehead. “Okay. Be careful after school, alright? Text me when you get home.”
Steve closes his eyes to keep himself from crying.
The room she prepared for Steve and Tony is at the end of the corridor. It’s tiny but luminous, with an ensuite bathroom and a small terrace. The furniture must be at least a century old. The bed is made, and there are fresh flowers on the dresser.
“Hey. Do you really think you’re ninety-eight?”
, he’s still so open. He’s so warm Steve feels like it’s burning. He’s wet and just
He’s unsure. He’s happy and relieved, but I see his smile fall, hesitant.
They touch him. They touch Tony in front of Steve.
While he’s in the air, Tony’s t-shirt rides up an inch or two, and Steve thinks he sees something underneath. It looks like one of the shirts Tony usually wears under the armor. He doesn’t comment on it.
Months pass, then a year, then two. They avoid the end of the world three times. The team changes: sometimes someone leaves, sometimes there’s someone new, but Steve and Tony simply stay.
All the time they wasted.
“I had an idea of her in my mind, I thought I knew her… Unhappy, her whole life. Steve. Her whole life.”
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over me—”
“I already asked Pepper. I’ll tell her exactly what it is when I’m back home, and I’ll tell you, too. It’s something about my mother. In case I die, I need you to help her do it.”
“Why did they put all those statues up there? All those details. Seems like a waste of time and energy, you know. No one can see them.”
would see him like that.
Steve shakes his head. “You have no idea how much I—”
There’s no trace of it. Nothing. As though it had never been there.
He starts to come into my room more often. He sits and watches me.
, he tells himself.
“Are you saying that my dick is small?” Tony jokes.
“Don’t pretend it’s not the same for you. You hate being called Stark, or even Mr. Stark.”
“Still early. We have more than an hour.”
He holds a t-shirt in his hands but stops before taking it out of the drawer. It looks suspiciously like Tony’s Black Sabbath t-shirt, the one he’d lost a few years ago, before Sarah was born. Before Steve ran away and came back.
He is exposed, utterly laid out, all of him, good and bad, successes and failures, shiny desires and embarrassing secrets, his mind scrubbed raw to find every cell that makes him, him, to catalog all the clues that lead to him, Anthony Edward Stark.
“Yes, and then the Chitauri, the way we did... I aimed the repulsors at your shield and you directed the beam against the Chitauri. Do you remember that? That was, it was, it was great, I thought it was great.”
“Okay, a bit.”
“St—” he tries to say, but Steve is somewhere else and replies only with a grunt. Tony could be many things right now—scared, sad, terrified, heartbroken, used, lonely, angry, melancholy, patronizing, witty, desperate—so he chooses to be none of them. He’ll let Steve finish, it wouldn't be the first time he waits for an Alpha to be done with him. He’ll let Steve finish; he’ll let Steve knot him while he keeps still and silent like a good Omega, then Steve will leave and Tony will pick up the pieces of himself and all his misconstrued hopes. It’s okay. It’s fine like this. Who would want to be Steve’s Omega anyway? It’d be a nightmare of unmet standards, Tony’s inadequacy dialed up to eleven all day every day. No, thank you.
Steve strokes his back, but Tony feels to him like he’s not really here.
Stella’s kind touch grounds him back into reality.
So. Weekend sex marathons are gonna be a thing in Tony’s life.
,” Steve says when he understand what Tony means. “I’m sorry. We can get out if—”
“And those, the new bruises, the way they hurt... it wasn’t the same, it wasn’t… it was too much, I couldn’t, I couldn’t breathe…” Tony’s chest heaves with a shuddering sigh. “But this one I have now, it’s… it feels good. It feels like the one from that night again.”
“What are you writing?” Steve asks.
They sit on the couch, and the cats snuggle up to them, then move out of the way, annoyed, when Steve, heavy, rests his head on Tony’s thighs. Tony trails his fingers through his hair and keeps them there, his hand still against Steve’s scalp, warmth radiating off of him.
“Ten years, Steve. We need to… how can we make it up to her?”
He thinks he feels Natasha’s hands on him at some point, she puts a fresh wet cloth on his forehead.
“I’m so sorry, sweetie,” Stella says with a small voice, placing a warm hand over Steve’s.
He fits there perfectly.
He adores Maria. He plays with her, talks to her, learns how to feed her. Tony teaches him how to change her diaper and how to clean her up properly. Steve is scared at first, especially when Tony tells him he has to hold her still to dress her.
Steve passes understanding through the bond, but Tony feels his regret too, his guilt. But there’s also hope. Steve has so much hope; he’s made of it.
He searches the guest house for signs of Tony, but finds none. One pair of his shoes is gone. His pants from yesterday too.
“Do we have anything for, uh…”
He thinks about what Steve said, about being in love and the future he dreams of.
Tony stomach flips at the suggestion. Well, he supposes they could. Steve sent him away, so he clearly doesn’t want Tony’s help. Which is fine. Obviously. Totally fine. Understandable, even. Who would want Tony? Who could desire a fifty-six-year-old Omega, bond or not? The mere idea is just laughable, honestly.
They don’t waste time in pleasantries. Tony suggests they get this done, so Stella can offer them all the tea and pie she wants.
“Give me sixty seconds now, fast as you can.”
“Ah. Thank you. For saying it.”
So, if Steve couldn’t do it before the mission in Lagos, then he’d do it after. He’d tell Tony the truth the moment they saw each other again.
And all he can give himself is a bunch of excuses: that at first their relationship wasn't the best, that he was scared he’d ruin it later, because how can you show up to someone and tell them something life-changing like,
“You alright?”
He tried to be Howard.
But there’s no more time, he can’t breathe, he can’t think, the ice is filling his lungs, the pain is—
, he thinks, while he feels like he’s breathing cold water that solidifies into ice inside his lungs, around his heart.
We think of ourselves as so much bigger than a mere t-shirt. But we never are.
Tony stumbles into the bathroom, closing the door behind himself. He doesn’t lock it. If he wakes up, Steve will hear what he’s doing no matter what, and he won’t disturb him.
Yeah. Fat chance.
Tony lets out a sob before he can do anything to stop it, and then he just lies there, horrified with himself. What if Steve thinks—
Steve walks behind him, slowly. He smells of his soap and his shampoo, enticing wooden scents that complement the perpetual sweetness of coconut underneath. The shirt Tony is wearing, not too elegant but different from his usual t-shirts, is so white it almost shines against his tanned skin. The sleeves are rolled up to uncover his hairy forearms, and the silver bracelets framing his wrists give him an air of strange nobility—their usefulness perfectly hidden by their sleek aesthetic.
filling Steve’s nostrils, the taste of his come flooding Steve’s mouth, Tony’s shout echoing through the empty workshop.
“No,” Tony says, and Steve closes his eyes so he doesn’t hear it, but that’s not how it works. “No. I’ll tell you tomorrow. I need to be sure. It’s important.”
Lust.
That’s when it dawns on Steve.
“I think I saw Sharon wear something with that name on the label once.”
“I understand. I’m not blaming you, I moved on too. I didn’t call to say that.”
He’s crying.
“Yeah. I remember. Thank you.”
“You’ve been away for almost twenty-four hours.”
He can’t think, but he needs to—
, and then,
Tony comes out of the bathroom. He’s towelling off his hair, another towel snug around his hips. Low. So damn low.
And I’m just... I never had the time to even really think about what I lost, to process it; there was always some crisis or some mission… But here, Tony, here is different. Everything is so quiet. I feel like I can think, finally, and, and I want to be an Avenger, I want... It’s important to me. I don’t know why I wrote that thing to you, it’s not how I feel.”
“Yeah.”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks. “Did something happen?”
“No, no, you’re right on time.” Tony shuffles in front of him, slowly takes one of Steve’s hands. His touch always feels electric, makes Steve hyper-aware of himself, of Tony, of their skin.
Tony’s mouth twists into something that isn’t quite a smile, that possibly doesn’t look as friendly as he’d like it to be, or as reassuring as he’d want. But still, Steve smiles back, tentative, while he looks at Tony with his big, sad eyes, full to the brim of all their kindest memories. The ones where they laughed, and spent time together willingly, and fought side by side instead of each other.
He still remembers this one time, a couple of years ago, when for some fortunate reason he got to bury his hand in Tony’s gray hair. All he did was to smooth it back with his fingers, but it felt so wonderful that Steve had to excuse himself and go to his room to have one of the most mind-blowing orgasms of his life, with his hand still tingling from the sensation of caressing Tony’s silver hair.
Tony sits up on the bed. “For what it’s worth, I did not want to kill him. Or you.”
He doesn’t want anyone to know he’s here, so he had the Stark Industries logo on the plane painted over. He let his stubble blur the edges of his goatee, his hair grow longer. He’s wearing a gray t-shirt, blue linen pants, canvas shoes. He has a duffle bag slumped over his shoulder.
Steve nods, tries to take big gulps of air, and he almost manages to succeed thanks to Tony’s soothing presence, his kind voice, before remembering that Tony hates him now.
Then, it happens.
“You’re not like
“I know, I feel like... I’m such an idiot—”
“Was it really you who sent Mom the tapes? We used to listen to them together, and play the songs in turn.”
Stella hugs Steve too, kisses his cheek just like she did with Tony, and whispers something in his ear too, but Tony can’t ear what it is. That’s alright, though.
It escapes Steve’s lips, like so many other things he shouldn’t have said; it slips away from his fingers like so many other things he shouldn’t have done.
“You don’t have to,” Tony says, even though he still can’t follow what Steve is saying.
“Thank you,” he whispers, and hugs Tony close.
“Square of Sources. As in, of water.”
“What if I hurt her?” he asks Tony, who is slipping Maria back into her onesie. He wanted Steve to try, but Steve insisted on watching Tony do it just one more time.
Tony tries to speak, to say that he’s sorry, maybe, but he can’t.
Tony is alive.
Maria Carbonelli was born on August 10th, 1937, in a big farmhouse in the Chianti hills. After the war, her father Antonio, the only one of the five Carbonelli brothers who didn’t work in the fields, had moved with his wife and daughter to the nearest city, Siena, where he made some money as a high-end tailor for ladies. Soon, he had shops in Florence, Milan, and Rome.
“That’s alright. Thank you for calling.”
When he nudges Tony’s hole with his middle finger, Tony arches his back and moans, but there are no signs of discomfort on his face, so Steve keeps pressing in, fighting for every inch, and after a while his fingers are pressed together inside Tony, so Steve moves them. In and out at first, just a fraction, just to see how Tony handles it. Then he scissors them, more and more, to get Tony used to the sensation.
How small your world becomes, when you feel so utterly alone. It reduces itself to the littlest things.
Steve slams the door shut and then presses Tony up against it face-first, grinding his erection against Tony’s clothed ass. Tony already feels wet.
“Yeah. I’m here, what is it?”
. Tony has a right to his privacy.
Tony opens his eyes for a moment to see Steve staring at him, wholeheartedly rapt, like he’s watching the best thing he’s ever seen in his entire existence, like he’s thinking that nothing ever could be better than Tony—
“Steve—”
“Where do you think we are?”
There are no Accords here, no Ross, no ultimatums. Everything seems so far away. So inconsequential. Where they really fighting about
His jaw aches. All of a sudden, he notices the pain, and it’s unbearable. He wants to scream, but he can’t.
Natasha snorts, while Bucky frowns in confusion.
“Also, I, uh. I don’t want to throw you out, but I need to make an important phone call. In private.”
Bucky and Natasha wait with him for Steve to wake up. It makes sense since they don’t know how violent Steve will be when he’s conscious again, but it makes Tony uneasy. There’s a voice in his heart telling him that this should stay between him and Steve.
He’s a kid. He should be in school.
It’s quick—Tony pulls away after only a handful of seconds. He bows his head and rests his forehead on Steve’s shoulder. Steve hears him take a deep breath, and the scent of Steve’s leather jacket must wrap around Tony’s heart and squeeze down on it because the next thing he does…
“Hey. Everything alright? What are you doing?”
He checks the time on his phone. It’s 4 in the morning.
“Wait here,” he says.
If I could go back… I’d do it all again, but better. I’d love him right. I’d love myself.
“I woke up… and you weren’t… there,” Steve says, words timed by the slap of his skin against Tony’s.
, at his dick, which is a nice new low—before he’s engulfed in anger and shame, both directed at his own stupid self.
Tony holds a bottle of water to Steve’s lips. He drinks.
“And I’ll need you. You all have been pretending I was delirious, or traumatized, or whatever the fuck else, but there’s something coming. Someone coming. For Earth. And I saw it. I saw the alien spaceships. I saw where the Chitauri came from. More is coming, Steve.
The arc reactor shines through the fabric. He taps at it, and heads for the kitchen. Steve is on the couch, typing something on his phone. Talking to Sam, maybe.
They use a branding iron on him. They put cigarettes out on his skin. He gags from the smell of his own flesh burning.
I feel watched.
On the other side of the bond—but it’s not really a side anymore, it’s all so confusing—there are Steve’s thoughts, mirroring Tony’s in many aspects, but without making an exact copy. Steve is more forgiving of himself, of his own reasons. He’s made some sort of peace with having been forced into an awful situation all those years ago, with having kept a secret out of fear, and he doesn’t hate himself for it, not anymore, at least, but the regret still burns deep into every recess of his mind.
She calms down after a while. Steve guides her face to his neck, and maybe he doesn’t smell like happy-mated-bonded-Alpha dad, but he still smells like
He rolls the leather of the kit over on itself and wraps the strap around it but doesn’t clasp it, since he’ll have to open it again later. He looks at the embroidered letters there, traces the J and the R with his finger. The only thing he’s got left of his dad. A man who died two months before he was born. He’s glad Peggy and SHIELD kept this for so long. He’s glad they gave it back to him when he asked.
Tony feels the knot grow inside him to full girth, effectively locking Steve inside him, and he whimpers one more time. He had forgotten Steve was so huge, especially when he’s like this.
He needs a huge knot shoved into him, he needs Steve splitting him open, he—
“Yeah.”
Tony must have his armor in one of his satellites, and the suit can latch onto the bracelets’ location to reach him. But it’s hard to think Tony will need to be Iron Man here. Would Steve have brought his shield, if he still had it? He doesn’t know. The idea of being Captain America ever again has felt unreal since Siberia. It feels impossible here, now.
Tony chuckles. Only a little, but... yeah.
No, no, he wouldn't do that. He wouldn’t. Steve knows his temperament, he knows his nature, he knows he’s not that kind of Alpha. He would never hurt Tony again, not willingly, but that’s the core of the matter: How can he be sure he’ll retain basic control over himself after this? How can he make predictions that would guarantee Tony’s safety? How can he, in good conscience, promise that they’ll both walk out of this unscathed when they’re so eager to play fast and loose with the ashes of their bond? He can’t; it’s too dangerous.
“Thank you,” Tony replies, invisible from inside the shower stall.
“Tony, I can feel what you feel.”
Tony dips his head down to kiss Steve, buries his hands in Steve’s hair to keep him in place.
He can’t reply with that, but a noise betrays him. It comes from a place that’s hurting deep in his chest, in front of his heart, right where the reactor used to cut him open.
“Oh my god, shut up.”
“Is this okay?” Steve asks.
The words bounce inside Steve’s mind. Does he want that? Of course he wants that, he’s been wanting it for years—
Tony simply looks at him.
Tony Stark knows very well that when you have as many ideas as he does all the time, not all of them can be winners.
Tony’s eyebrows are still knitted together when he shifts closer to Steve, planting his face on his chest. He lifts his head a bit and sniffs Steve’s throat; tries to go for inconspicuous and fails.
The words come out of his mouth before he can stop, before he even realizes he’s saying them. “I’m sorry about the other night.”
The box in Steve’s hand provides him with more comfort than its little size should justify. He’s grateful for it; in certain situations he never knows what to do with his hands.
He dreams of cutting Tony’s throat open with the shield, of watching the dark pool of blood expand beneath their bodies, of not caring that Tony is dead only because Steve is about to die, too.
He knows that nothing he touches here, now, can connect him to Mom. He knows this is not the same water, he knows the rocks have been scrubbed clean of any trace of Maria over the years.
“Okay, I’m cheating, because this is an old one. It’s about... it’s about New York, though, if that’s okay.”
It’s not good, because whenever Steve imagines tackling an issue with Tony, talking about something with him, he can already see Tony’s face hardening out of rage, until pain takes over.
Steve forces himself not to rise to the bait of Tony’s unspoken provocation, because as sure as he is of his words, he doesn’t know if he has the strength to fight Tony about this.
“Tell you what, why don’t you give me one of your sketches, huh? You got anything new?”
“This isn’t over.”
like that.
Sisyphus.
“At Clint’s—”
But this Maria, the one in the picture, wouldn’t wear that mask (that armor) for another few years. Not too many, though.
I stop screaming. I stop crying.
“Stark men are made of iron.”
He tilts his head towards Tony, and Tony looks up at his face, then rests his cheek against Steve’s bicep. “He’s gonna be fine. He’s gonna be fine,” he says.
“I will be when I’m clean.”
“I’m sorry we fought. That I didn’t tell you and we fought.”
He looks at Tony’s face while he sleeps and focuses his hearing on Tony’s regular breathing, on the steady beat of his heart. Steve’s eyelids are suddenly too heavy, and soon he can’t keep his eyes open any longer.
“Alright.
“Tony, slow down. That’s not what happened. If anything, you’re too much.”
“Not asking. I know you won’t. I’m not even earning it because I keep... I’m just saying. I dream about it. Can I, can I dream about it? Can I imagine it? Just, just sometimes.”
“Yeah.”
“Leave. Me. Alone.”
He ends up buying a little jasper falcon for Sam. In the car, he looks at it with melancholic eyes, and Tony realizes that Steve must miss Sam, badly, probably as much as Tony misses Rhodey.
He clutches the phone in his hand, careful not to break it. He’s always careful not to break things. The only time he wasn’t, he got Tony lying on the hard cold floor of a HYDRA compound, the arc reactor powering his suit shattered beyond recognition, just like their friendship.
“Yes.”
“I… What?”
Jen brings him a bottle of water when he’s in the lab almost every night, and sometimes she sits at the next table with a case file Matt Murdock asked her to please look over because he’d really love to hear her opinion on it. Tony thinks it’s an excuse to keep an eye on him, but after a while, he’s not so sure anymore. Jen was recently in a coma too, after all (they could be coma buddies. Ha. Isn’t that funny?), so maybe she needs him to keep an eye on her, too, but didn’t know how to ask. Whatever the reason for her behavior, though, Tony cherishes her company.
Now Tony is going to say something like
(But something good happened once. A couple of years before Thanos arrived on Earth, Tony was having an anxiety attack after a mission. He slept in Steve’s bed with Sarah, asked Steve to stay. So there is, actually, a small chance. A precedent, at least.)
Tony twists on his torso and searches Steve’s face with his eyes. Steve kisses him, and comes again while he does, moaning softly on Tony’s lips. “Me too,” Tony murmurs.
“On the bed,” he insists, and
It’s a cruel joke of the universe, the fact that he has to hurt Tony again to make him feel better.
Tony’s shoulder is close to his, but not enough that they could bump together, even by mistake. Steve can still smell Tony, of course, the room is full of his scent, but the intensity of it is completely different from what a shirt Tony’s been wearing on and off for three days would have done pressed to Steve’s nose. A firecracker and an atomic bomb.
“Scared, but you know how stoic she is. She put on her brave face and let everyone do their jobs. Not even Pepper could get her to put down her She-Hulk plushie for a single second, but she’s okay. We searched for you, but the trail went cold around Wainscott.”
is supposed to be, but at the same time he knows perfectly well.
“Of course. Careful, there—”
“Steve—”
They don’t get it. This is how I rebel.
Twenty minutes pass in absolute silence. Tony drives; Steve breathes.
“Really?”
“Enough.”
“No. He just feels guilty.”
“I never dislike your drawings. I’m not an expert, but they work for me, you know? Maybe it’s naive, the way I look at them. Sorry.”
But most of all, he saw this glint in Tony’s eyes during those three days they spent together, alone, at the Avengers compound. He saw it that night that Tony kissed him. That night when Tony pushed Steve to sit on the couch in his workshop and took what was his.
“Good morning, Dad,” she replies, laughter still in her voice.
He wants his mother back. He wants a drink.
There’s a baby inside him and he can’t let them down.
It’s different from New York.
No, actually, it’s more like... more like a brutal convulsion that goes through him once, twice.
There’s so much love. And so much regret.
“But you don’t need one. You don’t need to apologize,” Steve protests before what Tony said actually sinks in. Then, “The, the first time, though, is that, is that normal, or…?”
I was a sensitive child, Mom used to say. She meant it as a compliment, but he...
Tony wakes up way before dawn.
“I don’t… What does it feel like, for you?”
Tony stirs underneath him, but Steve relentlessly keeps going. He looks at the side of Tony’s face while he opens his eyes and blinks a few times. A little smile surges up to his lips.
“No,” Tony replies, and he doesn’t miss the way Steve stills, completely, immediately, for as long as Tony doesn’t speak. “I want you, I just… nevermind, it hardly matters now,” he finishes, because this isn’t the time to interrupt or explain.
Stella’s—Mom’s—words fall into silence. Steve looks confused but concentrated, as if he was trying to understand as much as possible but failed.
He doesn’t come any closer, even after he opens his eyes and lets all the air out. He doesn’t really do anything; he’s like a broken robot.
Tony emits a pitiful whine, shudders, but not in a way that tells Steve he wants him to stop. Steve sucks delicately, lets saliva trickle down past his lips, bobs his head up and down and feels one of the most incredible things he has ever felt, possibly even better than coming inside Tony just now: he feels Tony’s dick become hard in his mouth.
“Alright, enough with this nonsense!” Stella says, laughing. She points to a plastic bowl on the table. “Tony, be a dear and go out in the orchard, pick out some fruit.”
When Tony is ready, they go to the restaurant. They barely talk. Tony looks at all the wine exposed on the oak shelves, and tells himself that water is just fine with pappardelle al ragù di cinghiale.
But anyway, googling “having sex with an older man” was probably a mistake, Steve realizes. After filtering away all the porn (and just how much porn is there on the internet exactly,
Tony’s sure that in Steve’s mind, this is meant to give Tony space; make him adjust without forcing him to share the room with someone who looks like the man. It makes sense, but it’s not something Tony needs. The man and Steve couldn’t be more different for him.
Steve laughs. “You really think I’m an idiot, don’t you?”
It’s like the universe is encouraging them. Or punishing me.
“Yeah, I mean, there’s nothing to see, really.”
He distractedly thinks that he’d like for Steve to come closer. Maybe brace one hand against the door, next to Tony’s head. Steve would smirk, and then blush a little. Tony would lift his face towards him, slowly, and—
And Steve just lies there, still with so much disgust for himself and for life in general, because he was dreaming of his husband, of his beautiful, amazing husband being in bed next to him, kissing him, climbing on top of him, pushing inside him and making stars burst out low in Steve’s belly—but none of that was true, none of that was actually happening. It was just a dream. And now Steve is there, awake, alone, hard, and disgusted.
He needs—
Silence falls between them. Steve shifts on the couch, reaches to the coffee table to take one of Maria’s toys. He presses a button on it, and it makes a cat’s call. He presses another, and it’s the cow’s.
Steve is fucking him so deep, it would hurt if Tony didn’t need it so bad, if he didn’t need more. Each thrust is so hard that Tony feels it in his guts, in his stomach, and yet it’s barely enough.
“I… not really.”
He doesn’t really care. They can say whatever they want.
“Four hours and…” Steve checks the time on his phone, “forty-eight minutes. Congrats.”
“How are your ruts?”
“I’m sorry,” he says, “I should’ve told you. God, I’m so stupid.”
in his old-fashioned handwriting.
Anxiety rolls down Tony’s spine in a cold shiver. There’s a sudden weight on his chest, and talking becomes harder than a moment ago. “I’ll, I’ll do more, I promise,” his voice comes out small and whiny, it’s all wrong, it’s all completely wrong, “I’ll do better, I’ll be better, I’m sorry—”
“Yeah.”
Steve smiles.
Tony enters the kitchen a few minutes later, his hair combed but still wet, already curling at the sides. He takes some parsley from the porch, and minces it with garlic and hot pepper. It all ends up in a pan with some olive oil and the clams.
“Yes. Please.”
“You did this?”
Tony stares, his stillness betraying hesitancy and stupor. He mouths a barely-there “Oh,” more the sound of his tongue separating from his palate than a real word, and discards the shirt to the side. In the corner of his eye, Steve sees Tony’s chest rise and fall with words that are left unspoken.
“I was also jealous, because of my father, but that aside, I really did.” Tony continues. “You were perfect to me, in my mind. Captain America, pure and amazing. Spotless. Then we met, and, well... It wasn’t that perfect, was it? But still. The way I admired you, the way I grew to love you after things ended with Pepper—it took so little, from you. A whispered word, a simple thought you wanted to share with me, and I was undone. Gone. I couldn’t think straight anymore. It used to be like,
“I love you,” Steve groans against Tony’s lips while he comes, quietly.
Under the covers, Steve feels safe enough to cry. He shifts to get closer to Tony, hides his face against the reactor. He can see its light through his closed eyelids, hear its subdued hum. The scent of coconut. He can trace the ridged shape of the scar from over Tony’s t-shirt.
“It’s a rut. The worst he’s ever had. Possibly the worst anyone’s ever had.”
It’s useless. But I’m a prisoner, and as such I’m reduced to my past. Future does not exist. Not anymore. Not here.
God. And to think that he almost lost him.
Tony is still expecting a blow. Or at least screaming, anger, anything.
Tony makes his way down Steve’s body, shifts between his legs and takes off his pants. His white Calvin Klein boxers don’t leave anything to the imagination: Steve is hard and huge, heavy and red in his underwear. Tony touches it through the cotton after getting silent permission from Steve, and it’s hot and wonderful just like he remembered.
Tony’s breath doesn’t come in icy puffs of air here, it’s hot and ragged, interspersed with soft moans—he’s panting, but not out of fear. Steve’s hand doesn’t mean to bring pain to Tony, but comfort, and the hurt is an unavoidable side effect that is tolerated because the solace, the indulgence, are much more important. They’re not lying on the hard concrete floor of a HYDRA base where people got their souls stolen and broken and burnt into ashes, no, they’re on a bed; the sheets still smell of lavender fabric softener, there are flowers on the desk and trees outside, and the walls here have seen love and heartbreak, and only life’s cruelty, never man’s.
Steve grabs his hips and keeps him still as he lines himself up and thrusts into him. He lets out a grunt of relief, and Tony would snicker at how well his little game worked out but he can only let out a shout.
“You didn’t protest.”
“No, it’s fine—”
It should feel good, but it’s not just an attraction. It’s a craving, driven into him by a survival instinct that maybe made sense for cavemen who needed to perpetuate the species, but not for him anymore, not for anyone living now, and yet it’s still there and he hates it.
He doesn’t look at Steve while he says all this, but the simple fact that he says it at all is more than Steve expected.
Guilt still strikes Steve, but then it echoes in his mind, Tony’s voice saying,
“Yeah.”
But he respected Tony’s boundary around kissing, at least, that can’t be denied, he… he never forced Tony to kiss him and that has to… it has to count for something, right? Right?
Tony heads to the kitchen to break five eggs in a glass and start the coffee.
Steve goes very still. He dips his head low and presses his forehead against Tony’s chest. Tony wonders if he’s listening to his heartbeat. Steve exhales heavily, his hot breath grazing the skin of Tony’s stomach.
In the silence that follows, Steve says, “I miss you.”
Tony shakes his head, but doesn’t say anything else, and the awkwardness vanishes on its own in a few minutes.
“Mh?”
“Does... does it hurt? The reactor, does it, does it hurt.”
Tony tightens his hold just a fraction, adjusts Steve’s head, places a kiss on his jaw. “Tomorrow,” he says again, and this time it’s a promise.
“Okay—”
He doesn’t turn around. Steve stares at the nape of Tony’s neck and wonders if he’s touched it for the last time.
“You aren’t.”
He turns left, into a white trail lined up by cypresses. He parks the car in a clearing at the end. He gets out of the car to open the door for Tony, but he’s already stepping out on his own.
“There’s gotta be a way—”
Tony thinks about yesterday, the way he felt while Steve guided him into the bathtub with him. The warm water lulling them both like the most affectionate nanny. Steve’s hand, so big against his own. Steve’s skin never got wrinkled, not even after an hour in the water.
, more concentrated, more powerful, even, and Steve doesn’t want to taste anything else for the rest of his life.
He’s just put his sleep clothes on when someone requests access to the penthouse from the elevator. Tony grants it before checking who it is.
“It doesn’t mean—”
Steve’s hand moves fast on him, so fast that Tony is a mess in mere minutes.
“Yesterday, in Siena, when we were walking back to the car. When you weren’t, uh… feeling well. You said that. You asked me to take you home.”
“‘S never gonna happen again. Kissing. I know that. But I... sometimes I think about it. If I could. I wouldn’t fuck up again. If you... if you’d...  I’d be worthy of it. Of you.”
Steve just hopes she’ll reserve some of that kindness for her stupid parents.
He just wishes that at least the Bad Mornings would stop, because those are too awful. He doesn’t think he’s going to be able to survive a lifetime of those, no matter how occasionally they happen.
“Pepper loves the face masks, in case you’re interested.”
“You talked to Sam?”
“See what I mean? Dainty, and yet so manly.”
She is short and very thin. She is wearing a simple white dress with beige sandals. Her glasses hang on a pink lanyard draped around her neck. She has an apron on, and she’s wiping her hands on it.
Tony fills up two plates with tortellini and he sets them down on the table.
“I don’t know. It’s easier for me. I’d be the middle-aged sleazebag who gets to fuck the peak of human perfection.”
“I know that. I know that.”
Steve’s lips quirk in a sardonic sneer. He raises his eyebrows at Tony, says nothing, and thinks:
His hand hurts. His fingers aren’t enough and everything inside him burns.
An alarm blares in Tony’s head—his baby is crying and he’s too weak and emotional to take care of her. Stupid, useless Omega that he is.
About a week in, Tony hasn’t showered in six days, he’s covered in more baby vomit that he wants to think about, and there’s something dark under one of his nails. He doesn’t want to know what it is because it’s not motor oil and if it’s not motor oil then the options here are all things that make Tony’s skin crawl.
“I’m flattered.”
Steve loves watching Tony create things. He loves seeing him in ragged jeans and an old tank top, arc reactor poking out, glasses perched on his nose, streaks of motor oil all over him, his shoulders hunched low, concentrating hard on a piece of armor, on one of Clint and Kate’s exploding arrows, on a prototype for a machine that can and will redefine the medical field. But he loves it even more when Tony is like this: inventing, discovering, imagining things and ways to make them real. It’s beautiful, it’s breathtaking, it’s— hot as hell.
“T—thanks,” Tony chokes out, and he’s suddenly aware of how empty his mouth is. He wishes Steve would knot his mouth. They did it once, and he cried and choked on it, and his face ached for days afterwards. It was
Steve whines in response, and Tony wants to kick his own ass.
He thinks about the caves he keeps dreaming about, how alone he feels there without Steve, how strong the need to find him is.
Tony hopes Steve will never let him go. He hasn’t hoped for that in such a long time, and
Roses.
tattooed on one arm, a swastika on the other. NSDAP on his knuckles. The
“But if we disagree—”
My friends were with me, we saved it together. Listen, what's your name? Where's your mom?
Tony has lost track of time. He doesn’t really know what day it is. He knows Sarah is okay though; Bucky and Nat text him regular updates.
“That’s why the doctors said it was safer if I had the reactor again. Too much damaged tissue. They sent me back to the compound, with Rhodey. One night, all of a sudden I was feeling really bad, chest hurting, left arm numb. I thought I was having a heart attack. FRIDAY said I wasn’t, but I did the sensible thing and went back to the hospital.”
“I’m so sorry Tony. There’s nothing to do?”
Tony gives him a quick glance, like he’s ashamed of needing the reassurance at all, but he gifts Steve with his small lopsided smile, and then walks away, towards the apse.
“Oh. That’s good I guess… Um, do you feel any better now?”
Steve is breathing quietly next to him. He’s lying on his side, facing Tony, one hand tucked between the pillow and his cheek, the other resting on Tony’s hip under the covers. Tony looks at him, at how perfect he is. He is just— flawless. The sun hits his skin and makes it glow. His eyelashes are the most amazing shade of gold. That single wrinkle next to his eye is still there, unchanged. His lips are the same pink they’ve always been.
Tony kisses her cheek.
“Whatever. Almost.”
“Come on,” Tony says again, and Steve starts unlacing his boots.
He hugs me.
“Okay. I have a question. The relationship… is it non-negotiable? Like, if I forgive you, we have to get together then?”
Still. It happened again.
“It’s Wednesday night, Tony. It’s almost ten.”
“Mm?”
“They’re getting ready. And we aren’t. We need to. We need to get to work,
on the black and white display, and feel his heart rate go back to normal while he counts every single pixel it takes to spell out that name.
Well. All that was before Ultron. Obviously.
“Okay,” Steve says softly, with a resigned sigh. “I always ask too much of you. And I have no right. I have no right. I just wanted to say. Thank you.”
They’re distracted for such a small amount of time, but it’s enough for the man to rip a metal leg from a piece of furniture bolted to the floor and throw it at Steve’s head.
God, Tony smells like heaven. Steve wants to lick him, into him, he wants to feel his slick on his ton—
He rubs a hand across his face, pushes his hair back from his forehead. He catches his own reflection in the mirror and averts his eyes as fast as possible.
“Switch up the levels… Create a wider angle, Tony, don’t be shy with it…”
In the following weeks, Steve kind of goes through the motions when it comes to Tony. As usual, Tony acts normal with him, but Steve feels like some form of very delicate equilibrium has been broken, like Tony knows that
“I’m guessing the same stuff Sam told you.”
“I’ve lost my strength,” he manages to say. Reinforcing the room isn’t necessary; he can’t even get up.
“Mh-mh.”
“Okay, it’s just that… you never talked about it before, so I thought we weren’t supposed to talk about it, and…”
“So what’s different now?”
“Tony, I don’t mean to overstep your boundaries—”
, duh,” is her reply, and Steve and Tony exchange an amused look.
Steve doesn’t know what Tony has been doing these past ten years. How often he would masturbate, or how. If he even felt the need all that often. But before, while they were together, Steve always loved watching Tony jack off on top of him, and he would ask him to do it often.
Tony looks into his eyes, and he understands what he means without him having to spell it out. Of course he does.
Steve lowers his head to look at Tony.
It hits him suddenly, unexpectedly—until a moment ago he absurdly thought that he could somehow solve this. He can’t. Worse: there’s nothing to solve. Mom wrote those words ages ago. Mom is dead. Nothing can be done to make her life better. Nothing can be done to make her happy.
in his lungs.
It takes just this simple word for Steve to pick up the broken pieces of his pride. As bad as he is, he still helped make Sarah, who is the best, most perfect thing in the world. Something Tony and him made together. She’s
“Yes, what, what do you want me to promise?” Steve’s voice is concerned, and he sounds scared, too, but he’s trying to control himself.
, and Steve doesn’t need to be encouraged twice, he starts fucking Tony’s face in earnest, faster, still thoughtful of Tony’s comfort but that bar has been placed much higher now. In an attempt to gain some control over what’s happening, Steve pulls one of his hands away from the wall, places it carefully on Tony’s head and waits for a reaction. Tony’s eyes are closed again, and he jumps a bit when he first feels Steve’s hand in his hair, mostly out of surprise, but then he does nothing. Steve takes it as permission and grows bolder, grabs a fistful of Tony’s hair and
“The hell I can’t, I’m doing it.”
A loud
Tony’s eyes are closed, so he doesn’t notice what Steve is doing with his other hand until he starts tracing Tony’s bottom lip with a finger, making him open his mouth. Steve kisses him, slow and languid but demanding, shoving his tongue into Tony’s mouth, reaching so deep that Tony feels trapped by it for a moment, feels… held.
His slick fingers, clumsy and indelicate and harsh (perfect. So, so perfect), making their way inside Tony, pressing into him from behind. The cold desktop under Tony’s hands, the hem of the table digging into Tony’s lower abdomen while Steve pushed him against it.
He hopes that God listens to him, and grants Steve Rogers this one wish, the only thing he can pray for without feeling selfish and arrogant.
I liked him always. Always.
here, he’s doing this, that there’s something he wants.
“Someone’s been here! Since the Chitauri. Someone else! And they didn’t want us to notice, they… they hid their weapons! So they’d have an arsenal when they’re back… Who knows how many other bases… I… I need to do something—”
“I’ll warn you next time,” he says, and Tony doesn’t really need him to, but he doesn’t know how to tell him and it can’t hurt anyway, can it?
“Hey. Hey, look at me,” Steve’s voice is nothing but a murmur, but it latches onto something deep inside Tony, snatches the cap off everything Tony is trying to keep bottled up, releases all the tension at once: Tony’s eyes fly open and he stares at Steve, his mouth twists in a gasp, his breathing becomes ragged and shallow with pleasure, his body goes limp, melts in Steve’s arms.
, but—
“Sorry,” he says, lifting a hand to scratch the nape of his neck. He’s nervous. It’s weird. “I heard the news and… But I didn’t know if you… Sorry it took me so long to come visit.”
