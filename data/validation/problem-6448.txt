"Yeah, well, technically I make Pepper do that. And why are we arguing about this? I offered to be the woman here, jump on that, Mr Porter, before I change my mind and make you do all the steps backwards in high heels." Tony sounded exasperated, but he looked a little embarrassed.
"Yes," nodded Percival happily. "Remember? The hermit said that Sir Stephen would find the Grail because he was a maid and did not kill people needlessly."
Tony made a face. "Fuck them and their competitive patriotism. If it weren't my best friend going into battle in this thing, I'd have had it shooting Twizzlers months ago. They can shove their superior flag waving up their collective asses as far as I am concerned."
with every bit of wiring that comes out of the thing and he's on the verge of telling Tony to stop, just
"Oh God! Tony, please! Tony...." He broke off with a half sob on Tony's name and Tony tried to simultaneously retrieve his stomach from the vicinity of his boots and to will his instant erection down. Jesus fuck! Steve! He felt like he might spontaneously combust with the effort not to show any reaction when he noticed the demon looking at him from a bit of a distance.
.... He added a suit fetish to his list. Although it might be time to admit that the common factor in all his newly acquired fetishes, Steve-in-fatigues, Steve-in-capris, Steve-in-booty-shorts-swim-trunks, Steve-in-a-tux, was more along the line of Steve-in-anything rather than the clothing itself. He thought of Rhodey in fatigues: nothing. The thousands of men he'd seen in tuxedos: meh. And he couldn't honestly recall ever meeting men in capris before.... Steve in any of those outfits:
A few days later Steve and Percival found themselves being feted by a local lord, who wanted to know everything about their fight at the Maidens' Castle. After Percival's colorful recounting of their heroic deeds, there was much commiserating from the lady of the house on the atrocities suffered by the victims of the seven brothers. As if not to be outdone in the heinous crimes area, though, the topic eventually shifted to the imagined atrocities committed in the witches' castle two days to the east.
Tony's shivering woke him up several hours before dawn. The hut was warm and Tony himself was burning up, yet he shivered. Fever. Steve swallowed down the dread that rose like bile in his throat and wrapped himself around Tony. Tony whimpered and tried to burrow deeper into Steve's warmth and Steve was happy to let him, happy there was something he could do.
"Ooooh, that's what you were talking about with the French couple!" Steve looked delighted to finally have gotten that reference, when Kate and Leo were doing their flying thing. But then he looked puzzled. "There's no Captain Ramius in this, though, is there?"
"They don't. And the security check prevented us from bringing any obvious ones, so I'll need to get creative. It would look a little weird, not to mention blow our cover, if I showed up for dinner in the Iron Man armor, but I'll be damned if I go in completely defenseless."
to do something about it in the first place. He usually tried to fix his fuck ups for Pepper, but he couldn't even remember the last time he had done so for Rhodey and it wasn't like Tony didn't disappoint Rhodey on a bi-monthly basis at the very least. What was it about Steve that made Tony want to sit up and beg for affection? Why couldn't he just shrug it off and let it be? It was annoying as hell. If Steve was just as much of a withholding asshole as Howard had been then Tony should want nothing to do with him. Yet here he was wishing like fuck that he was back in his workshop because drowning himself in work was just how he dealt with feeling inadequate, thank you Dr. Freud. But since he had no workshop at hand, the irritation he was feeling had nowhere to go.
"Okay, stop it, Cap. You're freaking me out. You need to start doing that 'you disappoint me, Stark' frown now, or I'll be thinking I found bizarro Steve." But Tony was smiling just as hard as Steve as he said it, so Steve just answered:
He knew it wouldn't last and it doesn't. Tony bursts into motion and pushes himself away from Steve, who drops his arms with alacrity. He looks up at Tony, as the man stands up clumsily, trying to gauge his mood. But Tony just winces, gripping his knee and avoids Steve's eyes completely.
He was acutely aware that sparing your friends the worry of your approaching death meant that you had no one to celebrate with when you beat the odds. He stared through his window at the moonlit ocean and felt empty. He could drink himself into a coma, of course, but it seemed counterproductive to celebrate his beating heart by trying to kill his liver. He rested his forehead against the glass, the cool surface soothing his headache. God, he wished Steve was here. Wished he hadn’t cut off all contact. It had seemed the right thing to do when he was dying. Clean start for Steve, unencumbered by Tony’s train wreck of a life, it had been for the best. Besides, Tony had been busy, didn’t need the distraction.
"Of course you don't. Horrible hassle that would be. Fine, dig them out of that box in the attic that passes for your filing system and courier them over. As far as I can see you're getting a six figure salary to do dick all, Mr Bell, and you obviously don't give a fuck about the purpose of this fund, so while I am looking at these reports I suggest you make yourself useful and research some charities for me. I think... yeah, homeless veterans would be suitable. Send me a full report in a week." With that Tony broke the connection. If Tony had believed for a second that Steve would have accepted the money left in the fund, he'd have dumped it in his lap in an instant, but Tony knew him better than that. Steve probably wasn't aware of the problems veterans faced these days, but he was pretty sure he'd like such a charity.
It turned out he didn't have to. Hidden behind a boulder was a path that went up a crag in the rocks. Steve wanted to weep with relief. A path meant there was something at the other end. Shelter of some sort. And shelter meant dryness and warmth. He prayed it would be more than an abandoned barn. Clothes, food and fire was what they needed. He picked his way carefully along the path, the evening shadows heavy and foreboding.
"Mr. Stark, my name is Nick Fury, I am director of SHIELD and I am here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative. Please send away your bodyguard, so we can talk."
"And you're bleeding. Shit! You're bleeding!" Steve reached out a hand to his face and Tony backed up another couple of steps. Until his back hit a tree.
"Sure, they are not going kill us or anything. They are just going be silently disapproving of our 'lifestyle choices', or not so silently, if we get lucky. They are not going to like you."
The hostess led them to another table for eight in the restaurant, which was currently occupied by four young Japanese women in Cinderella dresses. They were friendly and giggled a lot whenever Steve smiled at them, but their English was so limited that they'd exhausted all the possibilities of conversation before ten minutes were up. And that was when their contacts arrived. Middle Eastern Guy cleaned up nice in a tux and the lady in charge had also made an obvious effort. He introduced himself as Abdel Bajjah and the woman as his wife Yamilla, and they claimed to be from Lyon. Once again, it was Tony who had to carry the conversation, but that was because Abdel also worked in a lab and was very interested in Corbin's research. No surprise there. Steve wasn't ignored this time, though, which was promising for not having to shoehorn him into the upcoming negotiations. Which Tony was expecting an invitation for any minute now....
He wasn’t surprised she’d noticed, but he was surprised she brought it up. He didn’t know if it was the alcohol or the long day or the intimacy of sharing the night air in a mostly silent town, but it seemed wrong to lie.
He found the hooked pole that he needed fairly quickly and then he stood on the altar to lower down the sanctuary lamp. He was fairly sure this would be added to his already not insignificant collection of sins, but he was already on the naughty list anyway. The lamp had a solid weight that promised excellent aerial velocity but it was very hot to the touch. So he left in on the hook of the pole and swung it slowly back and forth a few times to get a feel for it. It was a little bit like lacrosse, which he had played for about a nano second in one of his boarding schools. Where was Clint where you needed him, huh? Useless ass. Tony was a good shot with the repulsors, but actual ballistics he did better in theory than practice. The math of flying objects was lovely and elegant, if a bit simple for his tastes, but he was likely to only get one shot at this. When he felt reasonably sure he could do it, he yelled out.
Tony burst out laughing. He couldn't help it. "Comfort? Really? Well, you're probably the first person in the history of ever to turn to Tony Stark for comfort."
"So sorry, my dear, but no can do. It has to be the person with the strongest connection to our dear captain."
Without the armor, things were almost worse. It took ages to get anywhere on foot and then he had to do without the whispered translations (that were admittedly a little spotty) provided by JARVIS, who was sadly confined to the suit. Old English was fucking hard and his brain was wired to be more technical than linguistic, so he wasn't picking it up very rapidly. He was fairly sure Steve's eidetic memory had made the learning process much easier for him and Tony was a little jealous, but also relieved that he might be suffering less than Tony.
“I was trying to phrase it delicately, Mr Stark, but if you prefer me to be more blunt, I can. You collapsed in your lab, from hunger and exhaustion, and you laid there for 8 hours before I could be alerted and take the wards off your door. Then I had to call Madame Pomfrey back from her vacation in the Maldives to nurse you back to health. Which took three days. So this year you
"That is good. It's good to know what you are fighting for. Take a few more weeks if you need to wrap your head around it. But you need to come home."
They were coming back from a water break, when Steve all of a sudden pushed him into the men's restroom and into the handicapped stall. He flipped the lock and pushed Tony against the wall, his forearms bracketing Tony's head. His face was close enough to kiss and Tony couldn't help it, his thoughts went there and his breath hitched and his heart started pounding.
It wasn't until the next push that Tony figured out what the serpent was trying to do. The angle had seemed off this whole time, as if the monster wasn't trying to get
Rhodey looked at him, then looked at Steve, who was sitting across from Tony doing an uncanny impression of a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
Steve shook his head. It wasn't the weirdest thing that had happened on this quest, but he sure was ready to go home to the day to day weirdness he was more familiar with.
“No, no,” Tony said. “Wouldn’t have worked. Can’t have a matching set, that'd be too much.  This works. It does.” He stood himself next to Steve to invite comparison. Their robes were very different, even Steve could see that. But the hue in Tony’s robes matched a thread in the fabric of Steve’s and somehow the contrasting designs were okay when seen together. The tailors must have seen the same thing, because they muttered and grumbled a bit, but no scissors were thrown down in disgust and then Tony and Entwhistle left to do whatever they had agreed to do and Steve suffered through another half an hour of non-adjustments. All he wanted to do when Thistlethwaite finally left with a vaguely satisfied grumble, was flop on a couch and put his feet up. He kind of figured that was out of the question.
"I have," said Percival. "I am looking for it again, because my cousin said I failed to ask the right question when I first saw it and it banished me from its presence." He looked embarrassed.
"Yeah, that seems unlikely. Alright. Well, it will make for a more relaxed dinner, I suppose." Steve started walking again. Tony yanked him back.
“Well, according to McGonagall a transfiguration with that kind of mass discrepancy would run into continuity-elasticity limits and can cause reverbs onto the caster.” Steve wasn’t
Tony slammed back into the lab after Clint and Natasha had deposited him on the top of Stark Tower and called for JARVIS to set him up with a video call to Fury. For once, Fury didn't make Tony wait.
"What does the lord of the manor say on these occasions, Steve? So as not to cause any interstellar incidents."
It was one of Clint’s friends, alright, but not one of the obnoxious ones. This was the guy that was going to move into Tony’s room, once he’d moved into Bruce’s. Tony wondered again why on earth they had voted for a dude who wore suits as everyday attire, but then he recalled that the soft spoken man could quell Clint with just a look and a lift of his eyebrow and that had seemed an important contribution to the household dynamics at the time.
And it wasn't like he didn't want to, because honestly, he kind of did, right now, but he sure as hell didn't want Steve to think that he did. Because, really, all this friendliness and the sharing and, oh, let's not forget the waking up this morning draped all over a Steve who actually smiled in his sleep, all this had to be just a byproduct of being the only two sane people in a world full of crazy, right? But maybe, Tony thought, maybe they could use this experience to move beyond their endless bitch fests when they got back and build something more solid. Tony would like that. A lot.
“Thanks for ruining that for me. I had almost convinced myself to give him the benefit of the doubt. That he meant well.”
"Oh, Sir Stephen, your wisdom and leadership skills are unparalleled." Tony fawned, still giddy with relief.
It's a joke, but it's not a joke, because Tony looks ready to run. No, more like ready to kick him in the head and then run.
The next time he woke up, Steve was still sleeping, but he'd managed to mostly disentangle himself in the process, so Tony's extraction was more successful this time around. He snuck off to take a shower.When he came back a slightly flustered Pepper was trying to make a much more flustered Steve do the walk of shame.
He swallows Steve down with a greedy gulp and Steve throws his head back against the wall with a bang, barely noticing the hurt under the unbelievable feeling of the hot, wet suction of Tony's mouth. He cries out like he's been punched in the gut, his knees threaten to buckle. Tony's tongue curls around Steve's shaft , rasping over the frenulum as he starts moving up and down and Steve can feel that down to his toes. Mouth open, he silently pleads with the ceiling while moisture pools in the corner of his eyes and his fists bang the wall. Until a strong grip forces his hand forward and pushes the fist against Tony's head. Steve's eyes fly down, the sight of his dick sliding in and out of Tony's mouth almost undoing him. Tony seems to nod and Steve slowly unclenches his hand, sinking his fingers into the thick dark locks of Tony's hair. The luxurious feeling of it briefly distracts him from his straining cock, but then his hand cups the back of Tony's head and it fits perfectly. Tony moans and pushes back into his hand and Steve can feel the rhythm of it, of what he's doing to Steve. Of how he's sucking on Steve's dick like it's all he's ever wanted.
"We're not even-" Tony started, but lost his train of thought before he had finished his sentence. Jesus, Steve. Are you
Thor had left pajama pants, socks, a T-shirt and a sweatshirt on one of the sinks and Tony silently thanked the gentle giant, as she shoved Steve’s clothes in the washer and turned it on. The shower was still going, steam rising above the door and Tony willed himself not to imagine Steve’s naked body in there. Taking Thor’s clothes back to his room, he stopped by Bruce’s. Little Bruce was wrapped in a pink washcloth atop the hot water bottle and was eagerly sucking milk out of the giant pipette that big Bruce was handling deftly, while Natasha watched with an uncommonly soft expression on her face.
"You don't fight fair, Captain Solo." Who on earth was Captain Solo? Must be another one of those references he was sick of not getting. Whatever. He wasn't going to go back to bed solo. Tony dropped his head back against Steve's shoulder and Steve kissed him deeply and thoroughly, reveling in the feel of the rapidly swelling cock under his hand.
Tony was early for Steve’s sentencing, but he had wanted to make sure he’d have a seat. He knew the place was smaller and more utilitarian than you’d think. It felt much more high school auditorium than Law and Order courtroom. A military base in North Carolina should by all rights be classier, he thought, kind of like that ante-bellum North and South style, but they must have been on a serious budget here. He’d only seen the place once before when Rhodey had brought him in as a character witness several weeks ago. Apart from that, he hadn’t been able to see Steve or talk to him at all. Because Tony was on the witness list, and that meant he wasn’t allowed to be on the approved call or visit list. It sucked donkey balls, but Tony told himself he could go without if it meant Steve would be out sooner. Long term goals rather than short term gains, and all that jazz. Still: donkey balls.
They were. There was much rejoicing about Steve finding the 'lost' boys, that he valiantly grimaced through, and a lot of fussing over Josh's unfortunate fall and then Steve and Tony were following Cecilia and her charges back to the exit, once they had made it clear to her that she needed to not follow procedure in this case. When they were climbing up the stairs that came out in the underground basilica that they had started in, Steve finally had the opportunity to pull Tony aside. He turned on him.
But Steve can't. Not when Tony straddles Steve's legs and rolls a condom down his shaft. He wraps his hand around the base of Steve's cock, positioning it at his entrance. Steve's mouth falls open as he brings his eyes up to meet Tony's. Tony grins at him.
Goat Man is restless tonight. Steve can see his shadow passing by the trailer window and notices the almost imperceptible sway of the trailer as the man paces. Or whatever he is doing. Steve wonders why he doesn't go outside to pace, the evening is nice enough now and with the moon over the hills it really isn't too dark. But maybe he spends enough of his day outside with his goats and he craves the intimacy of his trailer at night. He's probably so used to the shabbiness that it feels like home in spite of that.
"I think the man is right. The fact that Bucky's a managed to hold onto even a shred of humanity after all that's been done to him tells me he's a stubborn motherfucker. If he doesn't want be social right now, he's not going to be social. Let's keep an eye out for signs that he does, though, and be ready to go then."
In the end, after a couple of days of doing nothing but spending time with his cats, he called his old house. The phone was picked up after only a couple of rings.
"There is no God and that man is evil," Tony complained and thunked his head against Steve's shoulder. Then he straightened up and grabbed Steve's hand to tug him up the dead baby stairs. Steve felt a little dazed still.
They continued washing with a little less touching. Bruce came back out of Tony’s room with a smile on his face.
This time it was much, much worse though. It had taken him a few weeks to even learn the language, for starters, because for all that it was supposed to be English, it really wasn't English that he recognized as such. He'd wandered around for a few weeks, trading manual labor for food and board while he was getting his bearings. Said food was another thing. No potatoes or tomatoes, no rice, no tea, no spices, it was weird. When he'd ended up at King Arthur's court he'd decided to stay put for a while. His prowess with his shield earned him a place between the knights, and since he had no clue where else to go, it was as good a place as any. But if he was making any effort to fit in, it was half hearted at best.
Arthur looked a little constipated, but Steve didn't care one bit. He was going to find Tony and get out of this place.
“What do you want, asshole?” He clamped the phone between his ear and shoulder while leafing through his thesaurus for the snidest synonym for ‘doesn’t know what he is talking about’.
Tony Stark.... Now there was a conundrum. He was Howard's son, no doubt about it. There was a physical resemblance of course, but also a shared devil-may-care attitude. Although Tony seemed harder somehow, as if he was used to not being liked, while Howard had been big on bluster and charm to appeal to people and get his way. For a moment Steve had feared Stark would recognize him from old pictures that Howard was bound to have had, but either Howard had never shown them to him or Stark had brushed off any resemblance to a man considered dead for 70 years as a coincidence. So far, Stark had mostly ignored him, spending the flight to Marseille immersed in Porter's papers and swearing at either his lot in life or Porter's questionable skills, Steve wasn't quite sure. There had also been some bitching about having to take a commercial flight, although he had been charming and nice to the flight attendants. Steve really couldn't see what could possibly be wrong with flying first class, himself. He'd had trouble not staring like a yokel at the insane luxury on board.
“No! Yes. They look fine. But the magic is ugly. They’re muggle motorcycles that have been charmed to fly, they’re not inherently magic. You even have to have to take them in every six months to have their charms redone. They haven’t been
After dinner, they sat together on the couch and watched Armageddon, while Tony finally got some work done on his tablet and Steve doodled in his sketchbook, not in least bothered by the ridiculous number of explosions on the screen.
“You up for it, Steve?” The whisper is rough, as the back of Tony's hand lightly brushes the pajama pants tenting over Steve's straining erection. “Is that for me?”
“First of all, it's not leather, you mouth breather. It is a fabric I specifically designed to combine maximum protection with maximum range of motion. It is fireproof, waterproof and acid proof and yet it breathes and wicks away sweat and--”
"Tony! Seriously! I am not dragging an easel and oil paints around Rome! I am not wearing a beret either, you idiot. I just need a sketchbook and some pencils and pastels. No, I don't need
It wasn't like Tony had meant to acquire a witch. No, he was out on an evening stroll, or rather, fly, to be more accurate. Now that he'd moved into Castle Aaargh, he needed people to know he was there. The more people talked about him, the further they spread the gossip, the better for his plans. And it was a lot easier to freak people out on purpose, than to try and not freak people out, really. He swooped low over some villages while having JARVIS blast Metallica's Seek And Destroy over the outer speakers. Judging by the screaming and running, it was doing the job admirably. He felt kind of shitty scaring the crap out of people, though. Watching the young and old and infirm run for their lives brought him no joy. So much for turning super villain in the near future. Maybe he could burn a barn or two, to change things up, when the screaming got on his nerves.
"Your concern for my well being is heart warming, Captain. Especially since you're barely acknowledging my existence otherwise. Truly, the cockles of my heart are tickled pink, or something."
"Oh fuck, you're all waxed," Tony groaned and planted his face in the crook of Steve's hip, where his beard made super sensitized nerves fire all over the place. He felt Tony inhale deeply and then the heat of his tongue as it licked a stripe up Steve's cock. When Tony's mouth swallowed him whole, Steve shouted something inarticulate. Never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined anything feeling as good as the combination of suction, heat, moisture and the pressure of Tony's tongue as it flicked against his frenulum. Holy mother of god, this would be over in moments. And that was... unacceptable.
Steve spent a blissful thirty minutes in a little art supply store that likely had not been redecorated since before Steve was born, laughingly fencing off Tony's attempts to buy him half the store's inventory.
true, there is no hope at all of debunking it. All of a sudden we don't have a trial of American Hero versus Misguided Bureaucrats, we have a trial of That Faggot in Spandex versus American Wholesomeness. And we'll lose two thirds of the jury right then and there." Tony grimaced, but didn't say anything. "I hate to say it, Mr Stark, but with your reputation, any contact with Captain America would sully his."
Tony lifts his face and Steve can hear him wipe his his face on his wifebeater as he shuffles closer on his knees. A foil package rips.
"Nothing! Everything!" Tony gestured around them, perhaps a little wildly. "It's is like we're in every single Christmas movie slash Romcom ever made. There's Christmas lights and snow and we're about to pick a tree together. We should be wearing Santa hats and then we should argue about what the perfect tree is and then we seriously overestimate our ceiling height so we end up having to saw about two feet off the tree and it will end up looking lopsided and we'll say it's perfect anyway and then you kiss me on the nose and then we'll have Chinese take out on the rug in front of the fireplace watching the lights twinkle in the tree and so on and so forth!"
“Sure. I think it was her deciding that he wasn’t worthy of your, or anyone’s attention, more than anything else. That’s how we found out. She was telling Jane all about this smelly homeless person who came to the door last week and rang her doorbell. Don’t worry, Natasha already reamed her out for being a judgmental little bitch. It was brutal. But you gotta admit he can look pretty rough, man. Anyway, he was here Tuesday last week. Thought you’d oughta know.”
Tony unwrapped the bundle on his pack horse that held his improvised saltpeter extraction device, to check on its progress. The bat guano would work when used in the raw, but if the saltpeter was leached out of it to be used pure, the resulting explosive devices would be much more powerful. He'd figured out a way to do it on the road, so they wouldn't have to stop for two days to process the bat shit, and that made the fact that their progress was being held up by these little encounters extra annoying. The sounds of metal striking metal came from behind him and he suppressed the urge to turn around and drool at Steve in action. It had become somewhat of an addiction, frankly, and one he needed to quit cold turkey. Another reason why these encounters were bad.
Steve was taken aback by the question. He realized immediately there was only one acceptable answer to this and only one shot to get it right. So he blurted it out:
, I don't know if the room is monitored but it's unlikely they have surveillance on the balconies. Although they're prime murder spots, really. Tip someone over the railing in the middle of the ocean and you're done.” He looked down at the water at least a hundred feet below and whistled. Steve winced. This water was much warmer for sure, but drowning was drowning and he still had nightmares. Stark looked critically at all the parts of the ship they could see. “Don't see anything obvious, I guess we'll take the risk... So the first thing we need to do is to figure out the security system and for that I need access to the ship's network. We'll need to find the internet cafe. Then I guess we'll have to wait for Hydra to make contact, and I fucking hate waiting. I suck at waiting. People start hating me when I have to do a lot of waiting. What is the plan for when they approach us?”
“The brain is all I got right now, Cap. No weapons, no armor, no data. I don't even have any tools.”
“I’m torn,” Steve confessed. “One part of me thinks I should just go now, this Monday, and get it over with. Another part thinks I should wait until you go too, after your thesis defense, after Steve’s had her kittens, so that we can leap together into the unknown.”
"Not much we can do till then. We might as well go and conquer that Rumba, Captain And Tenille. Nothing like a little 'making
“Well. Shit.” said Tony finally. Steve smiled and rolled onto his back. He wormed his arm under Tony's neck, so he could pull him close. Tony came easily enough.
“See, not that hard. More specifically, they say that she recently lost her husband, that she relishes her newfound freedom, but that she still needs external validation. How about that guy over there?” He nodded at a younger man in stiff, formal robes, who had a pale complexion and mousy hair.
"If the paparazzi spot us and post pictures of this I am never talking to you again. Just so you know."
"Friend Anthony!" boomed Thor as soon as they made their entrance. "Waes Hael! Health unto you and yours! Blessings onto your house and orchards! May your Yuletide be merry and bright!" Tony glanced at Jane, who was standing next to her boyfriend, with the rosy cheeks and the too wide smile of the mildly inebriated. She shrugged helplessly in return. In his fireplace hung a kettle that made the room smell like honey, cinnamon and apples, while making his eyes sting with alcoholic fumes at the same time. Darcy was ladling the steaming liquid into something that looked like a soup tureen. Everybody was looking at Tony expectantly. How the fuck was this his life? He looked at Thor, who was beaming down at him and then he looked at Steve who was doing the same. Good. All the big blond dudes were happy with Tony so far. Now he just needed to not screw that up.
"I don't think there is a hidden meaning in a large ball of yarn," she said, "And you're going to drive yourself nuts over those cards if you are going to start looking for hidden messages, Tony. Nuts-er, I mean."
He had been here less than twenty four hours and he already hated the Middle Ages. Loki/Pepper had been right. This was going to be difficult for him.
and good and gorgeous and perfect and making Tony fall in love with him. And angry at Steve because Steve was letting himself get shot at right now in Afghanistan of all places, while Tony still had serious issues with that country and even worse issues with terrorists shooting at Steve. Tony was also angry with himself for being so easy and following his dick and being so fucking needy for someone like Steve that he had fallen for him like a ton of bricks. Not to mention that he was furious at Fury, even more than was normal on any given day. He couldn't yell at Howard and he wished he could yell at Steve and he had been yelling at himself for days without it solving anything, so maybe it was time to give Fury another call.
“It's part of our itinerary on this ridiculous ship and a likely place to meet our contact. And not a likely place to be murdered, I might add. We can't skip it, Steve. It's not for another two days, and it's a class, we're supposed to be learning it,” Stark insisted.
, the Sinatra/Tommy Dorsey version, the other ones are just too slow. Although you're probably correct. I'll be singing and you're going to look pretty and maybe hum along. Do you know it?"
Unlike Steve’s, who was leaking abundantly, Tony’s cock was a little dry. Which was okay at first, because it stopped him from setting the world record for fastest hand job, but it became a little uncomfortable after a couple of minutes. Tony’s arms were pretty much trapped and for a few moment that was a conundrum. Then Steve took his hand from Tony’s dick and brought it next to Tony’s head.
Wow, Steve's hearing was truly phenomenal. And staying here till Judgment Day was not an option Tony would even consider. He wracked his brain to think of what they might have packed that he could use to light a fire. And then he smacked himself in the forehead. Duh.
“God fucking Christ, Steve, you are a work of art.” Tony digs his fingers deeper and Steve reflexively pushes back, wanting the touch. He thinks he feels a whisper of Tony's pajama clad erection brush against his crack and that stokes the fire even more. His dick is filling rapidly and his heart speeds up.
Tony was used to a little excitement whenever he arrived somewhere as Iron Man, and there were usually a few apprehensive ones among the crowd. But he'd never gotten a reaction like this. People were pointing and screaming at him long before he got anywhere near and then they all started running in obvious fear. All of them. Not a single person remained when Tony touched ground in the middle of the square. What the ever living fuck? He looked around him in astonishment as his brain desperately tried to process what he was seeing and make it add up to something that made sense in his world.
It changed things. Of course it did. For one thing, the post doc position he had secured for after his PhD defense, was now more of an option than a necessity. Theoretically he could buy a villa in southern France and do whatever the hell he wanted for the rest of his life. Except he couldn’t really. With the money and everything else came a sense of obligation to Stark Industries that he hadn’t even felt a smidgen of a week ago. Actually, that wasn’t true, he’d started feeling a little of that after the afternoon he’d spent with Steve, months ago, when they’d talked about hamburgers and all things American.
Good. Call him self-centered, but Tony was glad he wasn’t the only one not feeling it. Of course, Steve’s unhappiness could be totally unrelated to Tony, but the way he had tensed up at those questions said otherwise. He might be pissed at Tony, that was also an option, but one that Tony chose to ignore. As long as he was fucking dying, he was going to assume Steve missed him, just because he could and it made him feel better.
“For my sake, can you swallow your pride? Please, Steve? I love you, I don't want to lose you.” He squeezed his eyes shut and  gripped Steve’s hands as if that could hold him. He didn’t dare breathe.
“Draco, Harry, this is my friend, Steve Rogers. Steve, these are my cousin -several times removed- Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter. Two of a small contingent of people who prefer me alive.” Steve was at a loss for words.
Coulson came back in and turned off the tv. Silence descended in the room as the man made his way to Tony.
"You have plenty of adventure, oh virtuous one," Agravaine shot back, his tone implying that Gawaine was anything but virtuous. "Do you not remember that you cut off the Green Knight's head almost a year ago and you swore to have him return the favor a year and a day hence? You are due at his castle in two months and you do not even know where it is." He didn't add 'idiot', but Steve and everyone else could hear it loud and clear.
, while he made a mental note to look up dancers named Antonio Banderas. It was quickly explained that today they would learn the Quickstep first, then the Waltz and they would end with the Rumba. Dances like the Foxtrot would be covered during more advanced classes and apparently they had a whole separate session for other Latin American dances. They paired up.
Steve stopped himself from looking at Tony. Some conversations were best held facing forward. But Tony's paleness and poor cardiovascular condition suddenly made sense.
He choked down the hot wave of possessiveness that made him want to drag Tony close with fistfulls of his own jumper and never let go. Turning quickly, he left the room before Tony could spot the naked want written on his face.
He studied Steve's handsome profile and was struck again with how solid a presence the man had become in his life. As if they were meant to stand side by side to face their adversaries and even life itself, rather than the temporary truces they had had only when shit hit the fan. It was fucked up that they had to take this side trip into hell-with-hermits to really come to appreciate each other, but that was kind of par for the course for Tony. It had taken him a trip to hell-in-Afghanistan to realize there was such a thing as personal responsibility and a trip to hell-through-palladium-poisoning to learn that shutting out the people you loved was always a bad idea. Something Steve still had to learn, obviously, with the way he'd gone inside his own head in the last week or so. Tony felt a little smug at being ahead there, for about a nanosecond, until he realized that Steve was light years ahead of him in the personal responsibility department. Well, that's why they made a good couple, they complemented each other.
That was the moment Steve elbowed him in the side and urged him to come on. Tony blinked and took in the scene at the beach. The hermit had vanished, as they were wont to do, but the ship was still there, patiently waiting. Apparently they were to use it.
Right. Steve was covered in serpent guts and soaked in sweat and seawater. He stepped back awkwardly.
“I know. Start with that shed at 2 o’clock. It’s where they keep the drugs they use to finance this operation.”
And then the stranger was squatting next to Tony, holding out his hand to the kittens. Tony was looking down on his head. Broad guy, honey blond hair in need of a wash, a beat up leather jacket, desert camo pants also in need of a wash and he’d dropped a grubby duffel bag next to him onto the wet pavement. Weed seeker, then, except they usually had better packs.
When Tony was sixteen and flying home after graduating from his boarding school in Switzerland two years early, he got off his plane at a layover in Amsterdam and deliberately missed his connecting flight. He took a train to Delft and enrolled at the university there in both electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. Both were 4 year degrees where they assumed you’d done all the general education you ever wanted to do back in high school, so they got right down to business, which suited him just fine. His purpose had been two-fold. He had no desire to go to MIT, which was full of his dad’s cronies who would be more than happy to ‘keep an eye on Anthony’. That and he really wanted to piss off Howard.
Steve smiled harder and wrapped his arms around Tony from behind. "But so distinguished looking with the gray hair. Quite the silver fox."
Clint held the ball out to Tony. He hesitated in taking it. There was a weird vibe about the thing that he did not like at all. He glanced sideways at Loki. The god was still sporting that grin, but he seemed to have gone a little tense around the eyes. Maybe Tony was imagining things, though. The way he and Steve barely managed to be civil to each other, and that being an improvement over the way they met, there was no chance in fucking hell this particular portkey was going to work for him. He grabbed the ball.
Tony made a grumpy noise at that, but it wasn't long before his breath evened out in sleep. Steve pressed his face into Tony's hair and let out a shuddering breath. Of all the stupid things he had done in his life, falling in love with Tony Stark had to be at least in the top three.
He said turning back to Steve. Sliding off the table, he dislodged a piece of the armor that clattered to the floor. Tony winced.
“One would think,” Tony said, although as far as he knew the Fae could be notorious for being dead beat dads. “What happened?”
"See? It's just a matter of time. You have all the technology in this tower at your disposal, too, should you need it."
Now the man looks at Steve as if he is soft in the head and Steve gets a feeling he does that to a lot of people. In this case it is justified, since Steve doesn't want this man to come into his house, but here is inviting him in anyway.
“That is the salary you are going to offer Ms Potts to become your personal assistant once you return to the States. Believe me, she will be worth every penny.”
Maybe the wine had managed to buzz him after all. Because all of a sudden he couldn't stop his mind from slipping into a little fantasy in which Tony would wake up and tilt his face up towards Steve in a silent invitation. And Steve imagined accepting that invitation and brushing his lips over Tony's. Tony would be warm and pliable from sleep and his lips would be soft and Steve would slip his tongue into Tony's mouth and Tony would cling to him, like he'd done earlier that evening. And then Steve imagined his hand slipping under Tony's tunic and feeling the naked skin against his fingers while Tony kissed him and he had to forcefully make himself stop thinking about it, because what the hell? It was more than inappropriate. It was ridiculous. Especially since Tony would never kiss him like that.
Tony chewed on that silently for a while. When he felt he was able to retort with sufficient sarcasm, he said:
He cut off abruptly when Steve stepped into his personal space and looked down at him. Tony suddenly felt short of breath and his heart skipped a beat.
A fresh wave of tears followed. And a tale of how she'd been arguing with her elderly neighbor whose goat kept getting into her vegetable yard and eating the lettuce and how the man had keeled over and died in the middle of a tirade. His wife had accused her of hexing him and that had been that.
"Are you not sworn to protect the innocent? What kind of a knight are you? Your pathetic failure to live up your chivalric oaths on a daily basis does not--"
"I am afraid Bruce is making curry tonight," he said while shoving one of the hats onto Tony's head. Tony would have taken the stupid thing right back off, but it was blessedly warm, actually, so he decided he could suffer the indignity.
"Go wash in the creek," Tony told all of them, "You reek of week old fish guts." Steve groaned just as loudly as Bors and Percival, the idea of exposing himself voluntarily to more cold water was abhorrent, but so was the idea of waking up tomorrow morning covered in dried up gunk. He sighed and dug some soap, a clean tunic and a pair of leggings out of his satchel. Percival dragged himself up from where he had collapsed in the grass to go with Steve, but Steve had to kick Bors in the ass a few times before the man could be made to move. They stripped to their small clothes and washed quickly in one of the deeper pools in the creek. Then Steve rinsed out his clothes and beat them against a rock. He hung them over a branch and he was back in the water, almost done with cleaning his mail, when looked up to see that Tony had joined them. Tony smirked at his surprise.
"What are we looking for?" said Steve at his elbow, looking a little lost in the face of all the blindingly white Apple products. They probably burned his retinas.
Clint was looking at Tony as if he was not quite the sharpest crayon in the box. Which was patently unfair, because compared to all other crayons everywhere, Tony was wicked sharp. "Come on, Stark," he even sounded like he didn't believe Tony had just had a marvelous idea. "Surely you've figured out by now that we're not outsourcing Christmas."
They had made their way down into a small room that was called the King David chamber because of the frescoes when the kid pulled on his grandma's hand.
That unfroze Steve’s feet. He swiveled back in Tony’s direction and started stalking across the room. Fuck decorum.
In retrospect, Tony should have left Steve at home for the congressional hearings. Steve didn't laugh and eyeroll his way through those, like he had a t the expo. He was serious and grim, standing behind Tony. Tony didn't know if Steve thought the armor should be given over or not, but he obviously didn't approve of Tony's flippancy while denying them. Tony would have loved to tone it down for him, but there was more at stake here than Steve knew. It'd be out of character, for one, and if he started acting out of character, there'd be scrutiny and
"Right," he said cheerfully, when he opened them back up. "I'm starving. Are you starving? You must be starving. Food?"
The anger burned hotly for almost two weeks. It was a time in which he was phenomenally productive (as opposed to the Denial Days, which he had spent mostly drunk) and made breakthroughs in a number of projects. He added staple gun tasers to the armor, for one. He blasted a lot of grunge and metal through the shop, like any well adjusted man who had had his formative years in the late eighties and early nineties, but JARVIS was the only one around who could complain and he knew better. Especially after Tony had threatened to scrap him after sneaking
In retrospect, he could have made different choices all along. From letting Pepper book his ‘business trip’ months ago, to keeping Steve a secret from Fury and, most recently, talking to Natasha on the phone. He could have made different choices and then he wouldn’t have ended up joining the Avengers and flying a nuke through an interstellar portal with Steve’s voice over the com, tight with misery:
Ten days later, he dropped Steve and Rhodey at the Military Base in Schinnen. Steve was nervous, shifting from leg to leg as he eyed the guard house at the entry through the misting rain. Tony shook Rhodey’s hand and looked him in the eye.
“Nothing stays the same, Tony. That’s basic physics. And it’s really a good thing in the end.” She smiled reassuringly and then she was gone, swallowed up by the heat and noise.
He scrambles into the bathroom, away from Tony, who grumbles in protest as Steve's foot connects with his thigh. Steve kicks the door shut and reaches up to lock it, before he loses it.
“I wish…” He trailed off, not even knowing what all he wished for, except for everything to be different.
“You hear that?” said Clint to Natasha, with a smug look of satisfaction on his face. “I have a cat named after me.”
“Not that I would ever be desperate enough to use another man's sex toys,” Stark said, “But nothing that size goes anywhere near my ass, thank you. Those agate anal beads are more my style.” He gestured to the weird short necklace type thing that Steve had previously considered to be odd jewelry. What on earth were anal beads? And what was it with these 21st century people and their total lack of shame in talking about such private things? Blushing furiously, Steve started gathering armfuls of stuff and haphazardly stuffing it into drawers. The sex toys stayed in the suitcase that he unceremoniously shoved into the tiny closet. Only then did he dare look up and meet Stark's eyes again.
"They went outside onto the balcony." Tony's voice was soft in his earpiece while he poured himself some water, "Let's go get some fresh air, shall we?" They took their cups of water and strolled casually outside. Their contacts were standing close together near the bow.
Bruce looked up and smiled at Tony. “I think he’ll make it. I’ll bring him to you when I am done.” And he went back to feeding. Natasha followed Tony out of the room.
any more like a soldier out there? Do you think Del Porter has been any closer to being in the military than dressing like a stripper cop for Halloween? You can't just fucking
He sat on the stool next to Tony while the first chords of the long instrumental intro started playing. Tony was talking to the audience, something about Steve's acute case of laryngitis. The people were laughing. Had Tony just insinuated someone could lose their voice through too much gay sex? How.... ? Oh, right, blow jobs. Dan Savage had mentioned something along those lines. Steve felt his face heat up on cue. Tony was a menace. Steve wanted to slap him upside the head in retaliation, but it'd have to wait, because Tony was starting to sing.
gay Steve was, had they reconsidered. On the condition that he would do solo missions only and keep his identity a secret. Steve was so very, very sick and tired of being a secret. He was almost hoping Tony would blab it all over the news. But so far he hadn't heard a thing from Tony. Or even about Tony, who was usually in the news much more frequently than he had been in the month since he had last seen him.
In retrospect, Coulson shouldn’t have had a remote control in the first place. Tony didn’t even know he owned one, JARVIS was a hell of a lot more adept at finding him the channels he wanted to watch than that ante-diluvian piece of equipment. He wouldn’t put it past Coulson to have brought in his own, though. Half of the time Tony forgot that Coulson was even there, keeping an eye on him and reporting back to Fury on his progress, the other half of the time he was unpleasantly reminded. He’d suddenly see him in the corner of his eye, watching Tony like a silent spectre. Or a vulture on a wire. Or there’d be a sudden comment from behind Tony, that usually boiled down to a disapproving ‘what do you think you’re doing, young man?’ It was not even half as pleasant as living with Steve, that was for sure.
Steve nodded grimly. "Just do me a favor, Tony. Stay out of the way. You don't have mail and no weapons and you're not healthy and I can't focus if I am worried that thing is going to have you for breakfast."
"Nah man, there were like four Katnisses in there. Katness? Katni? I could recruit an army of Katni!
His feelings were a mess, he didn’t even know how to start making sense of them. Especially not as tired as he was. When the shower shut off, he hadn’t made any progress and when Steve came out of the bathroom in too short pajama pants and a too tight T-shirt, he didn’t move, only turning his head to look at him.. Steve’s hair was still damp and he’d trimmed the beard, but hadn’t shaved it. He hovered by the edge of Tony’s bed for a moment, while Tony watched him, waiting for an offer to sleep on the couch.
While he'd hesitated, the guy with the torch on the left had darted forward and lit the pyre. Flames started to lick up the branches and the woman started screaming for mercy. The unholy glee on the spectators' faces made Tony's fingers itch. There really was no satisfactory solution to this ugliness. In desperation, he yanked the pole out of the ground and lifted the woman up in his arms. She promptly fainted, as did a few people in the crowd.
"You're not that much smaller than me. You wouldn't even fit under my chin, like with that couple over there." Steve pointed out a particularly small woman pairing up with a rather large man.
"Aw, come on now, Tony. You're not going to tell me they hurt your feelings, are you? It's not like you are particularly patriotic or anything."
"Thank you, Sir Stephen," she said softly. "Thank you for asking the question that will allow the Grail to heal the king and heal the land."
"Noooooo, it's alright. This is fine." God, that was the least convincing no Tony had ever heard. In combination with the puppy eyes it was truly pathetic. Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony looked around the dark, spartan apartment that SHIELD database told him was Steve’s. He had had to double check, because absolutely nothing in here showed any sign of the man. No wonder Natasha had made a point of mentioning the apartment. Steve’s room at the Malibu mansion had been all bold blues, browns and burgundies. His walls had been covered with sketches, pictures that grabbed his attention in magazines and a couple of modern art pieces that he had relocated with Tony’s blessing. In contrast, this space was so beige and bare even Best Western hotel rooms seemed personable in comparison. He stowed the armor in a corner and sat himself on the ugly beige couch to wait for Steve’s return.
"Nah," said Bruce with a frown, "Apparently there is a 'eat one for every ten you decorate" rule and we've been busy here." He indicated the garland.
"The defrosting process is complete, Sir," JARVIS answered, "all internal tissues have thawed and Captain Rogers' internal temperature has risen rapidly."
Before he'd come to the end of his story, Tony started complaining about the lack of basic upholstery in this fucking era and what it did to his poor backside. They relocated to the bed, sitting side by side with their backs against the wall and finished off what was left of the bottle of wine. Tony waxed poetic about overstuffed recliners and hot showers and indoor plumbing and Steve noticed his eyes were suspiciously moist when he talked about coffee. Then they talked about motorcycles and airplanes and newspapers and phones and baseball (Steve) and electricity (Tony) and cinnamon buns and curry.
"I think you're right." Tony inspected a large staple he was modifying. "I think the only time we're going to see them is when they are going to try to take us out."
Steve abruptly gets up to perform an unnecessary oven check. Then he busies himself with setting the table. Usually he eats on the couch on Sundays, but that is obviously out today. He glances over to the couch, but all he can see from here is a tuft of dark hair sticking up behind the back of it. It looks soft and touchable and Steve wonders what the hell has gotten into him. What does this Goat Man have that has shattered Steve's illusion of being indifferent to sex, with pretty much nothing but a look and a bad attitude? Not that he can imagine acting on this new-found return of his libido, it is overwhelming enough even when constrained to his head.
out of trouble,” whispered Steve, trying to not broadcast what he was saying, although there were probably a dozen eavesdropping spells on them by now.
"Gruel was a Depression staple." Steve shrugged. "That was corn mush, mostly. This tastes better, less bland, bit of a nutty flavor." He resumed shoveling.
“Too busy inviting you somewhere more.... private?” Tony looked the young woman up and down. “Sorry, hon, I don't think you have what it takes to 'raise' his interest, if you know what I mean. Is that
That was the moment the crypt went dark. People screamed and Steve thought he heard someone cry. But several quick thinking people turned on their phones' flashlights and that made things quiet down a little bit. Steve pushed his way through the milling crowd towards the guide, who was asking everyone to calm down with absolutely no effect at all.
Steve can't say it. He can't tell Tony his mother has been dead for years. Because suddenly he sees the house through Tony's eyes, the eyes of a stranger, and he can't explain it. He doesn't know why the house still looks like his mother lives here. It never felt wrong before, but now suddenly it does. It kills his boner with extreme prejudice.
The impeccably dressed house elf popped up in a painting nearby. Steve wondered if paintings ever slept.
The reactor surged wildly and Tony was hit by a wave of nausea. Holding his new creation out of the way, he emptied his stomach into the grass. Fuckity fuck. That was worse than he'd expected. He'd be damned, though, if he was going to die here in a puddle of vomit while Steve hallucinated himself to death somewhere below ground. Probably damned in the literal sense of the word, the way things were going. He willed the reactor to stabilize and after a few excruciating minutes, it finally did. Tony struggled upright and took a deep breath. Then he put on his makeshift air filtration system and strode towards the chapel. Better get this done before he fell on his face again.
The crashing and grunting was almost upon them and still Galahad was fidgeting with the heavy spear. Steve cursed silently. Did he think the boar was going to do the chivalrous thing and wait for him to be be ready? This wasn't going to end well.
The press conference was interminable. For maximum effect, Pepper had brought Tony in first. He’d put on his public persona and assured everyone that he was completely sane and competent, cracked some jokes and managed to not even once imply that he was dying. The corporate espionage claims were obviously ludicrous and it would soon be clear where the late Ivan Vanko had gotten his outdated designs. He would be sure to let them all know as soon as it was. Blablabla.
"There's hope for you yet, Bruce. You can be my honorary girlfriend on the team." Natasha's voice betrayed one of her rare smiles.
Steve searched for a way to phrase his objection in a way that would convince these men and their piously passive mindsets. Sometimes he really still felt like an alien here.
He vanishes out the door and misses how Steve winces. Steve grinds his teeth against the surge of outrage that threatens overwhelm him just because Tony scorned his mom's toolbox. It's his mom's and-- and-- And he is being irrational. This is ridiculous. His mom's toolbox isn't a sacred relic. It doesn't even have a whole lot in it. Tony's toolbox probably
“Steve, this is Colonel James Rhodes. Former JAG. Now he is a civilian lawyer specializing in court martial defense. He is going to represent you.” He turned to Rhodes. “This is Steve Rogers.” Rhodes stuck out his hand and Steve shook it. It was only a reflex, Tony could tell, because Steve’s mouth was moving, yet no sound was coming out. He might have refused otherwise.
They toppled sideways onto the limo seat, as the tension started to seep out of their spines and staying upright got to be too much effort. Tony’s head ended up under Steve’s and he started to pull it back, but then couldn’t, because Steve’s lips started moving up Tony’s neck and they were warm and wet and firm and it was going straight to Tony’s groin. God, it had been so fucking long. Steve flicked his tongue just under Tony’s jaw and then moved up to softly bite his earlobe, making his breath hitch and his toes curl. Of course, he knew what this did to Tony, he knew all his weak spots, all the places where he was so sensitive that the merest caress would make him shudder and squirm. To prove his point, Steve pulled Tony’s shirt out of his pants, worming his hand under it and then he dragged his nails softly down Tony’s back, making goosebumps pop up all over his limbs.
Clint climbed onto a stool at the breakfast bar and started helping himself to coffee. "Oh, don't worry about that. Hanukkah fell around Thanksgiving this year. I am free to help you celebrate your Messiah's birthday. As long as I can stick to eating the food and you don't expect me to go to midnight mass or anything. And no caroling."
“Just because I am not drinking doesn't mean you can't drink, you know that right? I really don't mind. I thought you might want to, if you're going to sing.” Steve said earnestly. Before Tony could answer, JARVIS piped up in their ears:
“I'm aware. Ungrateful bastards. Putting me on top of the hit list after I built them those helicarriers. That was before I was aware, of course.” Tony shrugged. “I'm not blaming you. I'm just hoping to make Hydra pay some day for costing me my girlfriend.”
The land they passed through was deserted. No people, no animals, barely any vegetation. The houses were empty. It was unsettling at first, but as the hours dragged on it just became dull. They took frequent breaks to ease Tony's leg and to have him drink water, which was plentiful, fortunately. About mid morning they passed by an orchard. The apples that should have just been starting to ripen were old and wrinkled instead. They had to be last year's crop. Steve got some anyway, because the hunger was gnawing in his belly. He tried to feed Tony some apple mush, but Tony said his throat was too sore to eat and he wasn't hungry anyway. Feed a cold, starve a fever, so Steve didn't push.
"We are missing three people," Steve replied, "What is the procedure for that?" Not that he cared what the procedure was, he was going to look for Tony no matter what, but grandma was going to freak out about the twins.
Actually, Tony liked the smooth look even more, Steve looked younger and more vulnerable without the beard. He longed to run his fingers along Steve's cheeks and cup his jaw.
He finally filled one of the little bowls with his mixture and tied another one on top. He ran back inside with his mask on and checked that the manhole cover was still open. It was. The fucker really didn't have a physical form then. Which meant Tony couldn't kill him, but that was probably too much to ask anyway. As long as he could get Steve out. Meaning, as long as he could wake Steve up. He instructed Bors to hold the chapel door open while standing behind it and then he went back to the vent. He would blow up the entire fucking mountain if he had to, but really, in order not to bury Steve and Percival under rocks it really would be preferable by far if this worked like he'd planned. He eyed the vent hole and calculated the best place to wedge the bowl. There were way too many estimated variables in his calculations for him to be happy with them, but there was no way to help that. He gathered some dead grass to help along his makeshift fuse and then, with a little prayer, he lit it with his flint and ran for cover.
Steve winced. Then sighed. "I did. I'm sorry I did. I lost my temper." His face was uncertain, as if he was debating whether to go on or not. He looked down at Tony. "Do you know why?" Tony shook his head mutely. "Because I was already feeling very.... unprofessional about you, and you scared the shit out of me." He looked as if it pained him to say it. It probably did, the man had his own perfectionist streak a mile wide, even without Howard's help. Tony snorted, couldn't help it. God, they truly were a match made in heaven.
“It may be easier to part now,” he warned. “In two months time… it may be so much harder to say goodbye then, Tony.” He kissed him again, tongue flicking against Tony’s lips and Tony opened for him eagerly.
"No time, Clint! There are about a hundred of these guys on the ship and eighty seven of them could be stealing my armor right now, while you stop to pick these off."
“I’m not. I’m Tony Stark, I’m the one who is paying you. Thank you for coming all the way out here.”
“As if that was ever in question, Stark.” Steve managed to sound breathless and snarky at the same time and Tony loved that. Steve increased the pressure of his hand and thrust forcefully, sliding so fucking perfectly along Tony's dick it made him keen. “Just look at you. Jesus, Tony...” Tony lifted his head so he could look at the both of them sliding in and out of Steve's fist and the sight of it, the sound of it was too much. He couldn't hold back anymore. He dropped his head back on the pillow and arched up into Steve as orgasm slammed through his body. Steve followed right after, moaning loudly into Tony's neck and both their shirts got striped with come. He kept the presence of mind not to let his weight drop onto Tony's leg and managed to fall away to the side.
"Let's stick with Natasha for now. I liked being Natasha, I'd be happy to be Natasha among friends."
Tony interpreted his silence differently. He drug himself upright and impatiently pulled Steve over towards the dead bike.
"Did I just run into.... my alter ego in the atrium?" Steve waltzed into the workshop without so much as a peep from JARVIS.
Twenty minutes later they traded lazy kisses and hand jobs in the shower. Then they fed cats and had breakfast in on the couch in the morning sun. Soon, they were surrounded by cats, who came drifting back in after their own repast in the kitchen. They seemed to remember Steve, to his delight, and they vied for a spot on his lap. All except Steve-the-cat, who had a marked preference for Tony. When they had finished their coffee though, Steve rid himself of cats and pushed Tony back into the couch. Tony went willingly, wrapping his arms around him and sucked his tongue into his mouth. It was a while before they made it out of the house to take Stevie to the vet.
Later that night Tony fitted his new vibranium powered arc reactor in his chest and got a new lease on life. JARVIS congratulated him. No one else was there.
“Well.... not one hundred percent straight, buddy,” Tony muttered under his breath, then followed at a more leisurely pace.
They were met outside the door by yet another hermit. It had magically stopped raining, but Tony was still suspicious at how very bone dry this man appeared, with not even any mud on the hem of his robes. Something was definitely up with these people. The man started talking about how the creature had been a false Christian in life, yada, yada and Tony zoned out almost immediately, daydreaming about hot food and warm baths. He snapped back to attention when Greybeard started reaming him out for abusing the sanctuary lamp for unholy purposes and then he lost track again, not because of hot baths, but because the man was right. This time he'd had a handy source of firepower, but that wasn't going to do him much good in future situations. Without the suit and without any sword skills, what he needed was a reliable long distance weapon. The possibilities were laughable of course, but he hadn't been the world's biggest weapons manufacturer for shits and giggles. There had be something he could work with, even here...
“You have another squad of about 20 coming in at 4 o’clock. Blow up that bridge to slow them down and then get the communication center. It’s between those huts near the wadi.”
In retrospect, he should never had let Steve bring the shield to Monaco. Not that there had been a whole lot of 'letting' going on, truth be told. Because that implied that Tony had had any say at all, and that hadn't been quite how it played out. Basically Steve had mentioned he was going to bring the shield and Tony had made a protesting noise of the inarticulate kind and Steve had said: "It's my shield and I am not leaving it here because you feel the need to go cavorting with the rich and famous for a week in a ridiculous country." And that had been that. Except...
When they had taken a few turns in rapid succession in a direction Tony hoped was getting them closer to their cabin, he finally felt like he was coming out of the fog of that kiss. He looked up. Steve looked debauched. His hair was sticking up everywhere where Tony had ran his fingers through it, his lips -gah,that bottom lip- were swollen and red, he had beard burn all over his chin and Tony must have managed to pull his bow tie out, even if he didn't remember doing that. But his eyes were a little frantic and it seemed like he just could not settle on what emotion to feel. Tony sighed. No way Steve had missed how hard he was, it had been pretty obvious. This was going to take some fixing.
He'd just started to describe the glowy blue sphere when the door to the courtyard swung open and the twins came in with a bowl of freshly picked blackberries. Tony felt like cheering. Actual food! He snagged almost half the berries while the twins served themselves gruel and bickered over who had kitchen clean up duty today. Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony and Tony put a handful of the berries back. He manfully refrained from sticking his tongue out at Steve. The door opened again and in came Percival with two large buckets brimming with water, followed by Florrie who gave him a cackling smack on his ass for his trouble. Tony was impressed. The well at this castle was brackish, the sea being as close as it was, and the nearest fresh water was a good mile away. Iron Man had been on water duty mostly, but Iron Man was- Yeah, water was going to be a problem soon.
But he couldn’t help his gut clenching and from the corner of his eyes he could see Bucky’s jaw tense.
“Steve?” The voice is young. Female. Familiar. He looks over his shoulder and he was right. It's Wanda, his former therapist, sticking her head around the door of her office. He'd forgotten that she has open office on Wednesday afternoons.
"And you were afraid Tony would reject you. That he hadn't forgiven you and that he didn't want to be with you. If you stayed away, you could cling to the hope that maybe you had a chance with him."
“Don’t look so put out, honey bear,” Tony chided. “You’re the one that left us alone in a limo with blacked out windows. What did you expect?”
"I wasn't quite as pungent as you, but I was still ripe. And who knows when the next opportunity for a bath presents itself? Can I borrow your soap?"
century. Then Tony told his story as if it was the biggest joke ever and Steve couldn't help laughing throughout the recounting, even though it was horrendously obvious that Tony had been lost and lonely and frustrated, just like Steve. Tony's fingernails were cutting grooves in the soft wood of the table while he talked and Steve wanted to cover his hands with his own and make him look at him. To let him know that he knew that they were joking because it was easier, but that he also knew it had been fucking hard for the both of them and that he was just so pathetically grateful Tony had come for him.
“Or, I may skip the part where I try to talk to Fury, because he is just going to keep hiding whatever he wants to hide until he thinks I need to know, and I'll go straight to hacking into his systems again. Too bad that JARVIS doesn't have the bandwidth right now to pull that off. I really, really want to know what went down with Widow and Hydra this morning. Last night. Whatever.”
Unfortunately, that was the moment the serpent managed to accomplish the first part of the plan. The three knights stood panting and stared at the fallen tree of flesh stretched taut across the deck, the head and its vulnerable gills safely back under the water on the other side.
Tony could hear the thickness in Steve’s throat and felt his own tighten as well. He knew Steve knew he’d meant well, but, Jesus fuck, he’d had no idea that Steve was struggling with the
Then it turned into a blur of Rhodey going "Never mind!" And Steve apologizing profusely for Tony's lack of discretion and Tony cackling like a maniac, muffled by Steve's hand.
." She paused with a spoonful of granita in her mouth, which made her look disturbingly like a little girl with a lollipop. "Actually, the ones that weep for Jesus are the worst."
It was hard, because somehow Tony seemed to have decided that Bucky’s bed was better than his own and just started following Steve home at night. So Steve couldn’t even rub one out in peace. Instead he lay there in the dark listening to Tony talk about random topics and letting the sound of his voice wash over him until the Compulsion dragged him under. Then Steve would slink into the bathroom and jerk off furtively while he imagined crawling into bed with Tony afterward.
“Fuck, this Compulsion is powerful,” he whispered. It was. It only took another few minutes for him to be dead asleep, half draped over Steve. Steve sat there, stiff as a board at first, but gradually relaxing as Tony’s breath deepened. Carefully, he allowed his head to rest on top of Tony’s, secretly relishing the soft tickle of the dark hair against his cheek. The late night quiet made him feel comfortably mellow. He stared at the opposite wall for a while.
Seconds later the boar burst out of the underbrush and proved him right. Its attention drawn by Galahad's panicked motion, it headed straight for the hapless boy. Galahad didn't freeze, Steve had to give him that, but his spear wasn't ready and it hit the massive beast in the shoulder instead of the chest. The boar spun and the movement wrenched the spear out of Galahad's hands. Screaming in rage and pain, it went for the boy. On the other side of the clearing, Steve has risen as soon as it was clear the boar wasn't headed his way, and lacking his shield, he did the only thing he could think of. He hurled the massive boar spear at the hog. This type of spear was never meant to be thrown, but the upside of being dosed with super serum was that you were able to throw a wide variety of things that weren't meant to be thrown. The spear caught the beast in the side of the neck and yanked it sideways, pinning it to the ground as it went clear through. But the wickedly curved tusk took a sizable chunk out of Galahad's thigh as the boar went down, and the boy collapsed screaming in pain. The animal was screaming too, its hooves pawing the air frantically, still refusing to die.
It had been excruciatingly painful to sit on the stand and see Steve only twenty feet away and not be able to touch him or talk to him. Instead he’d held his eyes as he talked about how lost Steve had been when they first met, how Steve had barely known what country he was in, how dirty he had been, how hungry. About all the times Steve had run before he’d finally realized he couldn’t keep running. He also told them about the nightmares Steve had and the almost random explosions of anger. The whole time he’d willed to Steve to hear that none of that mattered, that he still was the best thing that ever happened to Tony, but he wasn’t sure if it came through. Rhodey had made it abundantly clear there was to be no hint of their not-so-platonic relationship, lest it would prejudice the more conservative members of the brass against Steve, so it wasn’t like he could put that into words. He was even afraid the jury might read it off his face and Steve had doubtlessly had similar instructions, so they sat there with wooden faces and burning eyes and Tony had gotten very drunk afterwards.
"She does?” Tony processed that for a couple of seconds, then decided that wasn’t the real issue here. “Let's go get lunch." Tony felt uneasy. What the fuck was Steve doing here? It’d been a couple of weeks and he was wasting his fucking time and talents hanging around with Tony.
"JARVIS! Get the Mark VIII ready. Get me the Captain America suit and did Natasha deliver the shield?"
"I am going to sleep," he announced to no one in particular. "I've had a long day. Thank you for letting me save your asses today, it's been a real pleasure." He was too fucking tired to deal with this bullshit.
Thankfully, Steve seemed to have misplaced his own dignity sometime during the proceedings too, if the broken voice was anything to go by.
Steve's head shot up. “Stark. Hi. Um. My security code still worked? So I hoped I was still welcome?” He had the grace to look a little embarrassed.
“To be specific,” J.A.R.V.I.S. piped up, “Sir said he would electrocute the next person who so much as dared to breathe in his general vicinity. I deemed announcing your presence to be potentially detrimental to your health, Captain Rogers.”
“Oh god, Steve, I missed you so much.” Tony swallowed down a lump in his throat and blinked furiously.
The dude in the helicopter said something else, and Tony couldn't even process what it was and didn't care to. But he saw a stubborn look pass over Steve's face and then a pleading one. His whole body was one big plea as he started walking towards Tony, holding out his hands to him.
Immediately something dark and rotting and vicious came snarling out of it and threw itself at Steve and Percival. Tony had no idea what it was. His nerdy knowledge base was much more scifi oriented than geared towards undead creatures, because the latter didn't come up with many interesting or even interestingly ridiculous ideas, so he found them kinda boring. And he obviously hadn't played enough AD&D in his days to figure out if this was a lich, or a zombie or a wraith or a ghoul or whatever. Whatever it was, it was fucking fast and seemed determined to claw someone's eyes out. More worryingly, it didn't seem to be affected much by the steel of the swords. It clearly didn't feel any pain and it refused to drop limbs that should have been severed by the force of the two knight's blows.
"Yeah, probably. And then he said 'good' and then Thor congratulated me on our joyous union and clapped me on the shoulder so hard he almost smashed my face into the table and Clint said 'thank god someone is going to be fucking Stark, he needs to get laid, thanks for taking one for the team' and -"
“But that's just it, isn't it?” Steve's voice was tense, heat smoldering in his eyes and Tony had to wrench his mind back from going to inappropriate places. “Now we're back and you've got all this back,” He gestured at everything around them, “and your friends and JARVIS and your fame and your workshop and your....
"Kick off your shoes." Steve complied as quick as he could. Tony slid his hands down Steve's legs, taking the pants down and leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake. He lifted Steve's feet, one by one, to get rid of the pants and slid his hands up along the back of Steve's legs, not stopping until his fingers were spread over Steve's ass. The press of his hands was warm and urgent through the thin fabric of his briefs, guiding Steve closer. Then Tony tilted his head and started mouthing up the bulge covered in red silk. The cloth was left wet and clingy and rapidly cooling in the wake of Tony's hot mouth, the contrast exquisite. Steve let out a shuddering breath that did nothing to help him calm down. He felt Tony's fingers flex on his ass and then they were pulling down the back of his briefs, stretching them under the globes of his ass, pushing those up, while the front of the briefs pulled taut over the head of his straining cock, adding one more sensation to jumble he was already failing to make sense of. He barely registered Tony's hand sliding over his bare ass, because that was when Tony reached the top of his shaft and closed his mouth over the head. Steve's knees buckled for a fraction of a second before he caught himself with his hands on Tony's shoulders and had to grit his teeth to stop himself from coming right then and there.
Vanessa stopped her assurances that she was fine and they should try that spin again when she caught his glare. She put her hand on Steve's arm and smiled. "Don't worry Mr. Porter, Vincent won't steal your man. He'd get fired for that sort of thing and he likes his job too much to risk it. He does like the silver foxes, though...." She looked at Steve, who probably hadn't relaxed as much as he should have. Tony wasn't
He pulled out the sketchbook he'd got in Rome. It was caked with Afghan dirt, like everything else in this shithole, but the drawings still stood out clearly on the smudged pages. Fountains, fountains, fountains, on the first few pages and then Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony.... Tony absorbed with his soldering iron, Tony frowning at his tablet, Tony lounging on the couch, Tony laughing out loud, Tony with ridiculous bedhead, Tony sprawled on the bed fast asleep after sex, Tony just waking up with a soft and private smile, before he had had the chance to think of something sarcastic to say, Tony with his hand on his cock.....
limit, dependent on the skill and power of the caster, it’s not set in stone, unless you’re trying to teach twenty adolescents at a time and you either can’t be bothered to find each individual limit or don’t want them to hurt themselves doing stupid-ass shit while you’re not looking. Second, mice to horses is going to be child’s play for you once you figure this out, I doubt mosquitos to elephants are going to be an issue for you once you get going. Your friend Sam, he may have to worry about mice and horses, but not you, and thirdly- No. Wait. Back up.” He held up a hand to stop himself. “Staying safely within the continuity-elasticity limit, do you believe,
"Nothing as Del and Corbin, sir. There is another kiss after the gelato place, in your current outfit. That one does not have your name attached, just a 'OMG! Squee! How cute!!!!!' on Tumblr" JARVIS sounded almost droll when quoting that caption, counting out the exact number of exclamation marks.
“Of course he is staying,” said Bruce. “There is plenty. There’s time for him to take a shower, too.” He turned to Steve. “You should get out of those wet clothes. You’ll catch pneumonia.”
"Babe me one more time and you'll have the list shoved up your ass, honey." Natasha gave Tony the same little finger waggle he had given her on the ice and strode off with a grinning Clint in tow.
And he pointed to something that looked like a dark blob against the dark waves for all that Tony could make out.
"I am starting to see that, yes. And Bruce said 'Tony is my friend. Don't make me angry.' And he may have gone a little green around the edges. Natasha just started sharpening her knives while she smiled at me."
Tony laughed. "You don't sound too sure. Now, that would be wholly justified if I were actually cooking anything, but thankfully for you JARVIS keeps the fridge stocked with pre-made meals. Let's see what we've got today."
"It's legal, if that's what you’re asking." Tony made a face. "Most conservative Christians still have a conniption about it, but we could get married in New York and New Hampshire right now, if you want."
He had no idea how many miles of tunnel were in this section of the catacombs and he had no map, how the fuck was he going to find him in this maze? What if he was running
“Tony. I just wanted to-” Steve was reaching into his jacket, but Tony yanked on his arm and dragged him inside.
Elaine led them to a large room that Steve immediately recognized as Tony's make do workshop. It was nothing like his workshop in the tower, of course. For one thing, it was lit by torches and there were no robots zooming about, but it had Tony's stamp on it nonetheless. He cleared a space on the giant table that was positioned in the center of the room and laid Tony down. There was still no movement and the light from the arc reactor was weak, though stable. Steve resumed his efforts to open the armor. Elaine was watching him from a small distance, but when he looked at her she just shrugged. No help there, then.
“Rinse your hair, Tony,” he managed and dunked the man's head forcibly under water. While Tony was spluttering, he made his escape.
Steve's nails bite into the palms of his hands, furious at having lost the opportunity to do this himself, at missing his chance to unwrap the man before him more slowly, to maybe run his hands under the towel relying on his sense of touch, before peeling the towel off, possibly with his teeth. Not that he would have had the guts and that thought frustrates him and shames him, because he wants to have the guts. It's even stronger than yesterday, this need to be able to show Tony that he wants him. But there is this fucking wall between what he needs and wants and his ability to act on it.
Everything pointed to that being a hopeless endeavor. The man was a superhero, a genius, a celebrity, mind bogglingly rich and from everything Steve had seen in the papers, a bit of a slut. The chances of him wanting to pursue a relationship with a soldier who was either deployed or stuck on a military base were nil. He tried to imagine asking Dr Redditch if they could take a break during test #376 so Steve could go see his boyfriend and he could just see that going over like a lead balloon. Not that Tony would be interested in Steve once this assignment was over. Their lives just didn't intersect. And even if he was, it had no future because Tony could never find out that Steve was the Captain America he so despised. And he would. There was no way Steve could keep lying to him. Right now he was lying by omission and lying under orders, but it was already grating on his conscience.
"Sir, Captain Rogers is trying to get your attention." JARVIS interrupted his mental merry go round. Tony shook his head. He had almost forgotten he had a passenger, even with his arm instinctively curled around Steve's waist. Not that he could feel it, the more was the pity. When he turned to Steve, the man was glaring and forcefully pointing downward. Right. Land. He supposed it'd be safe to land now. He glanced down and spotted a orchard, trees neatly lined up in the spring sunshine, the nearest rough hewn stone house a couple of miles away. As good a place as any to make plans.
Tony's eyes flew back to Cap's face. Nothing. He could see nothing. He cupped his right hand along Cap's jaw and turned his head back towards his own. There was no resistance to the motion. The skin felt cold, but was it dead-cold or just cold-cold? He brought his face closer. Had that been some random spasm of the heart muscle?
He is staring at a slightly shorter man with expressive brown eyes, who seems to be going through his own internal struggle to keep his temper at bay. Their breaths mingle heavily in the hot afternoon air and Steve imagines he can hear the man's heart thundering as loudly as his own in the protracted silence. Then Goat Man lowers his fists a fraction and Steve follows suit. Slowly, they both straighten up, eyes still locked. Steve feels like he ought to apologize, although he is not sure for what. He opens his mouth to speak when Goat Man lifts an admonishing finger and glares at him.
"Oh, he does. It'll be fine. Stark won't go haring off on stupidly dangerous quests anymore now that he knows that Cap will just plunge in right after him and possibly kill himself doing so. And Cap won't be so eager to sacrifice himself knowing that Stark will be right behind him. They'll have to keep themselves safe to keep the other safe. It's a thing of beauty, really."
“As I said. You’re both miserable. And it was getting in the way. So I figured the one obstacle I could clear up for you was tell him about your near death and how it got resolved.”
, Steve thinks, but "Yes," is what he says. And: "You could take a shower." What the hell is wrong with him?! He doesn't want this man in his shower. Except he kind of does, but in a totally unacceptable way. He hastily puts the clothes back on the man in his mind's eye, but that only leads to: "You could do laundry." Surely it is the heat that makes him feel like his head could explode any minute now. “You could turn off your generator.”
, exactly?” Exasperation was bleeding through. “You'd pretend that nothing happened so that I could pretend that nothing happened and I could go back to my regular scheduled life? That I would just stop feeling the way I feel about you? You thought I wanted out? Or did you want out yourself?”
The next time Tony had to fly off as Iron Man to go deal with some crisis he spent the entire flight to Serbia being treated to Steve's tactical analysis of the situation, which JARVIS conveniently displayed on Tony's HUD. He was in and out in under 40 minutes, with no damage and no casualties.
"Anyway, it looks more like they are arguing, than doing Titanic reenactments. Dammit, I want to hear what they are saying. JARVIS, any audio out here?"
She threw a toothpick at him. Tony triumphantly put it on his own pathetically small pile. On second thought, he put the toothpicks in his pocket as well.
"I suppose.... the fund would revert back to you to do with as you will. But I am going to have to insist on hard proof before taking such a step. I am sure you understand. Your father -"
“Good thing I came prepared then.” Tony digs out several foil wrapped packages out of his pocket and tosses them on the bed next to Steve. “How do you want to do this? Gonna open yourself up for me? Or you want me to do it?”
“SEVERAL MATRESSES. BLANKETS. POTS AND PANS. BOWLS. KNIVES. PENS, INK AND PARCHMENT. HAMMERS, WRENCHES.... AND GARDENING IMPLEMENTS.”
“How do I..... How do I be Del?” he finally managed, much more uncertain than he wanted to sound. “I don't have a clue how to do this.” Stark sighed and bowed his head again. He let go of Steve's shirt and that felt a little bit like a loss, but then Stark started smoothing out the wrinkles he had left in the pink -no, salmon- polo shirt and that was good. Yeah, that was really nice. Of him. That was nice of him. It took him a moment to realize Stark was talking again.
Tony's stomach swooped and his face flushed. Steve surely hadn't meant that as the plea Tony was hearing, but he couldn't help hearing it that way. Not while Steve was looking at him with that intensity. And maybe he
Horror washes over Steve as his brain comes back online with a clarity he hasn't felt in years. What the hell has he just allowed to happen? What the fuck is he doing? In his mother's house! With a stranger! A goat herd. And what the fuck does it matter? His mother is
He tried setting up some calculations in Lotus 1-2-3 and once again swore that, as soon as he had some actual time and resources, he was going to revolutionize mathematical software. But these were only rough preliminary calculations anyway, the real work was going to be done soon on the mainframe he had reserved time on. Between Lotus being cumbersome and having to pluck Clint off the keyboard and his shoulders, and dislodging Tasha from his pajama clad leg that she tried to climb like a tree, the first hour was a wash. But then the calculations had been entered and were plugging along nicely while he marked up some of the literature he was going to reference in his thesis. Clint and Tasha had fallen asleep in his lap, their limbs entangled and Tasha still gnawing dreamily on the drawstring of his pants. It was strangely peaceful and he got a lot done.
He had just about made up his mind to throw caution to the wind and rush the guy to get at the arc reactor, which was the only way he could possibly imagine shutting him down, when Whiplash was hit in the head by a metal frisbee. The man staggered back and then it turned out that the frisbee wasn't a frisbee at all, but Steve's shield, and its owner came vaulting over the fences to catch it on the rebound. Steve landed with the grace of a panther and quickly tossed Tony his suitcase armor, with a glare that promised words later, before bringing his attention back to Whiplash. Just in time to bring the shield up and deflect the nasty whips that were coming for him. Then he somehow managed to jump away sideways, yet over Whiplash's head and conk the ugly brute in the noggin as he did so. Whiplash had no choice but to turn and face Steve and that gave Tony the opportunity to slowly let the armor unfold to cover him. And it was
So it made absolutely zero sense that he was smelling fresh baked cookies down in the workshop. Gingerbread cookies, if he was not mistaken. Clint had mentioned his baking plans earlier this morning, but one did not hallucinate smelling cookies. Did one?
“Don’t be such a drama queen, Tony,” chided Draco. “At least a third of the people here wish you no harm whatsoever. And I am sure only half of the rest are actively disappointed last year wasn’t the start of your inevitable decline into substance abuse.”
"Yeah, he is a bit of an overachiever if you ask me. A wreath and some Chinese takeout would have sufficed for me, but it is hard to say no to those big blue eyes."
Oh man, that was going to be bad, if it was in the Prophet. Steve knew things were going to get really, really complicated, but, God, Tony was kissing him and rational thought was beyond him.
And part of it, to be honest, was just that he plain felt sorry for himself. Poor Tony, all alone so far from home, finally finding someone he thinks he can love and then fate sweeps him away. It wasn’t exactly Dying Young, but it still sucked. At the same time, he was wondering why the hell he was so hung up on a guy he’d seen four times. He went back and forth between feeling sorry for himself and feeling stupid for feeling sorry for himself, until he finally figured that he’d never know if he was just projecting or that there really was something between him and Steve. But what he did know was that some people you fucked and you knew deep down it’d never amount to anything and some people you slept with and it was full of hope and potential, even if you didn’t really know the person yet. So after that he could go back to just feeling sorry for himself.
“I kid you not! The demon is 30 feet tall if he is an inch and he is red like blood with icy fire shooting from his hands and feet. He flies in over unsuspecting, God-fearing villages and burns them to the ground. They say he eats unbaptized babies for breakfast! And he takes all their witches to his Castle of Sin where they worship the devil. You can see the green fires of hell dancing on the battlements at night.”
"Al... what?" Bell looked truly flabbergasted. Tony ruled him out as being in on any kind of conspiracy. Complacency and incompetence seemed much more likely vices.
"How the fuck are you even alive?!" The armor's speakers boomed and he saw Steve flinch and take another step back. Steve, who'd been friends with his
“That is the scary part, Tony. If I get used to that again, then I don’t know how to reconcile that with the other parts of my life. I gotta be… numb, to live my life. If I’m not just focusing on surviving, then I have to deal with the things I’m doing to survive. And with the why of it. And I can’t. I don’t think I can.”
Instead, Steve grabbed him by the back of the head and pulled him in. Tony stumbled forward and had to catch himself with his hands on Steve’s chest. Good start.
How pathetic was it that, even as a minimally sentient piece of machinery, apparently Steve’s defining feature was his need to be all up in Tony. And worse, that Steve-the-bike was getting farther than Steve could ever hope to get. Faintly nauseated, he watched Tony coo over his bike a little more.
"You know he is not worthy." She said it as if she was sorry and not like she was condemning Tony, but it still irked Steve.
Tony tried to catch Steve's eye, but the man was suddenly staring at his gruel as if he had found Jesus in it. Then he aggressively started eating again. Three bites later he looked back at Tony, face so perfectly bland Tony knew instinctively he was hiding something. He couldn't imagine what, though.
“I was trying to reach Captain Rogers, sir. I thought the situation could benefit from his analysis, but Ms. Romanov answered instead.”
He slowed and came to a standstill before he was even halfway down, though. The last few months had been exhausting. He had felt like a rope that was being used for tug of war. Or like a piece of taffy being pulled in two directions. And the pulling had stopped, but like the taffy, he had been left strung out and saggy in the middle. Then he knew he wasn't ready. He couldn't go and get in that car and join the Avengers. Yes, he'd wanted to and maybe he'd want to again, but right now he wanted to just.... disappear. Lay low, lick his wounds, whatever. With a sense of wonder he realized he could. He was a free man. He could do whatever the hell he wanted.
"Tony, I was thinking..." Steve sat up and swung his legs over the side of the weird bed. Now Tony really looked at him. He pulled his t-shirt down where it had ridden up his front. "I was thinking... Let's learn to dance today."
"Still," he managed, "I don't think it was like that. It was like... Like you feel about the Iron Man armor. Like I was something that he created and was proud of, but not like I was an actual person for him to like or dislike. Imagine if you had only one set of the armor and you had no way of making another one and you lost it. How long would you keep looking for it?"
“Okay. This is the plan. We’ll get going here in a minute and then we’ll take the bike to Stark Manor. I need to be there tonight, because I am hosting the traditional Midwinter Celebrations. It’s a big official event for prominent members of the wizarding community. I’ve just told Jarvis you’re coming too.”
“Tony, nobody reads a thesis, unless they’re in the committee or a poor, defenseless grad student that needs to suck up to you.”
“Liar,” grinned Tony. “You can’t wait to get me home for ninety-seven-off. After we sleep for 24 hours, anyway. And shower for two more. Also: food.
He was right about the rocks. In the end, he had to follow the coast for another half a mile or so before he spotted a small stony beach that would allow them to make landfall. Dragging both of them through the pounding surf that did its best to pull them back out to sea was the hardest thing he'd done that day. Considering the swim he just completed and the serpent he'd fought, that was a fitting testimony to his exhaustion. When they'd made it, he lay gasping in the evening light, grateful for every rock that was stabbing him in the back, but he only allowed himself a brief minute. As soon as he'd caught his breath he rolled over and frantically sought for Tony's pulse. His skin was cold as death. God, let him be alive. He needed Tony to be alive...
He dragged the burlap sack with his armor pieces off the pack horse and got out the helmet and the chest plate. Cursing the fact that he only had the emergency toolkit he kept stashed in the armor to work with, he started taking them apart. The going was much too slow for his tastes. Who knew how long Steve could breathe those fumes before they killed him? And what the fuck had possessed him to jump down a well with a crazy hermit in the first place? The naive idiot. The singing birds and babbling brook in the clearing he was in were mocking his sense of urgency and lacking a Steve to yell at, Tony cursed them heartily. It didn't help much.
reputation as a playboy.” Tony could just hear the hunger for dirt in her voice. He glanced back at the screen. Steve still looked relaxed, but Tony knew him well enough to spot the signs of tension in his posture. The twitch of the fingers, the flutter of a muscle in his jaw.
, to try and gain some kind of composure. Unfortunately, it wasn't an instant fix and the silence stretched. Steve dropped his duffel bag and set the helmet down on the other side of the bench. He leaned against the workbench a couple of feet away from Tony, but facing out, where Tony was stubbornly facing in, glaring at the bit of tech he was undoubtedly demolishing. He couldn't quite recall what it had been for, anyway.
Tony described the event with a bit more detail than he had used for the abbreviated version the night before. He left out the deep emotional connection that Loki had mentioned, though. It sounded stupid, for one, here in a mundane medieval kitchen, with the object of said connection being all professional and shit, while sitting at a roughhewn table eating gruel. He would like to ask Steve about it, about this apparent connection, but he couldn't imagine the man responding with anything other than denial and disbelief. And then Tony would be forced to explain what Loki had claimed and he would sound... like he wanted to be special to Steve.
Since lying was out, Tony went with the truth full throttle. "I would trade this entire fucking world for the blond one's soul." He was struck himself by
Steve rolled onto his belly and looked down at Tony on the floor from the edge of the bed. He stared at him until Tony quit laughing.
An hour later, Tony was drinking a warm coke at an outside cafe in N’Djamena. He was still in the armor, so he was drawing quite a crowd of onlookers, and the coke was disgusting, but he didn’t give a fuck at this point. He rubbed his hands through his hair, making it stick up in the sweltering heat. Then he took a deep breath.
He hurried back to the kitchen and put together a couple of sandwiches with the fresh bread and thick slabs of cheese and packed them in the old bread bag. When he went back to his room, Steve had finished tearing and was standing a little awkwardly in the middle of the room with his duffelbag slung over his shoulder.
Steve shook his head minutely, as if trying to clear it from the visuals Tony had just so callously provided. He stepped away from the changing table, a little closer to Tony, but not anywhere within touching distance. Tony felt another pang at that.
Of course Steve was a vanilla kind of guy. Tony had tried to convince him that Del would totally have opted for the pomegranate green tea smoothie with hemp protein, but Steve had looked so disappointed that Tony had ordered him the largest vanilla cone they had, instead. Although he had the girl put the boring ice cream into a waffle cone dipped in chocolate and rainbow sprinkles. One had to stay in character, after all. They wandered the deck for an hour or more, long after the ice cream was gone. Tony checked in with JARVIS who reported that he had checked arrest records of most Middle Eastern countries, but had not had any luck so far finding any matches for the guy they'd seen at the pool. Disappointing, but hardly unexpected.
Predictably, Tony whisked him away before he could so even so much as eye the couch. They traversed what seemed to be the entire length of the manor and ended up in a room so vast, so splendidly decorated, that Steve’s mouth fell open. He’d always thought that the Hogwarts Christmas decorations were the pinnacle of holiday extravaganza, but compared to Tony’s ballroom, they had been positively rustic. There was nothing homey about the room, though; it glittered in shades of winter, from starkest white to glacier blue. Enormous chandeliers dripping with icicles hung from the vaulted ceilings, giant snow crystals and fairy lights whirling among them. Snow covered trees with sculpted ice ornaments stood between the tall arched window, exquisite snow sculptures here and there. Everything was larger than life and Steve felt about two feet tall. He shivered, despite the room’s very pleasant temperature.
The sky had grown dark and it was snowing lightly by the time they reached what Steve had deemed NYC's best tree lot. Tony had been grateful for the warmth of Steve's arm during the walk because the temperature was dropping rapidly and whatever heat he had built up ice skating had disappeared a while ago. Now they were standing side by side, perusing the selection of trees, hands shoved in their pockets for warmth. It wasn't until they were ten minutes into a discussion of the merits of Noble Firs over Douglas Firs that Tony was struck by the complete and utter ridiculousness of it all.
“Goodbye, Tony. Thanks for everything.” He opened it. “You’ll have to catch that last cat by yourself though. I can’t come back this time.”
The ballroom where they were to have their lesson was surprisingly nice. It was two stories high, had big chandeliers, a gleaming wooden floor and it had doors that opened onto the deck located near the bow. About 30 couples were milling around waiting for the class to start, none of them standing out as obvious Hydra agents. But those seemed to have changed a lot since Steve's time, as Tony had pointed out. Monocles, black leather and heavy German accents were apparently out of fashion for the bad guys these days. The instructors came in, a very tan, glittery and sinewy group of men and women, and gathered the milling crowd.
"Wait! What do we do with the boar? It is rightfully yours, Sir Stephen. You made the kill." Gaheris interjected.
The anger didn't stop there though. He was also angry at Steve for not telling him his secret, even though he realized he was probably under orders not to. And angry at Steve for being all
The green flicker resolved into a ring of green fire somewhere on top of a hill, or building of some sort. And then all of a sudden it wasn't just a ring, it was an eye. It was the wrong color, but there was no mistaking it. It was the Eye of Sauron, exactly like in the Lord of the Rings movies he'd watched with the team. Galloping your horse in the dark was a stupid thing to do, Steve knew. It could so easily trip or step in a hole and break a leg and Steve could break his neck, but he couldn't bear going any slower now that he was one hundred percent sure he'd find Tony somewhere near that eerie big green eye. Percival was shouting at him as he fell behind, but Steve didn't stop. Percival would catch up and Steve wouldn't even particularly care if he didn't.
Steve stared at the contents of Del's suitcase spread out on the odd circular bed in the cruise ship cabin. Stark had mumbled something about the seventies wanting their swinger pad back, whatever that meant, and had disappeared into the bathroom. There were red roses and chocolate covered strawberries on the night stand. Steve didn't think he had felt this lost and out of place even when he first woke up in the 21
"Nah, man. He's still laying low. It means that my aunt thought I was getting underfoot and told me to skedaddle for a few days. I'm expected back for Christmas, though." He selected another piece of popcorn and stuck the needle through it. "Thought I'd come and see how my buddy Steve was getting through the season, make sure he wasn't moping lonely in a corner somewhere. Hah! Instead I find this!" He gestured expansively with a cranberry. "I must say he's performing beyond my wildest dreams. Got even you roped into his Christmas fantasy, huh?" Sam smiled widely at Tony, as if he was genuinely pleased with him. It was impossible to dislike this guy. He was the perfect partner for Steve, Tony thought a little sourly: upbeat, understanding and likeable. All things Tony failed miserably at even on his best days.
“Go see him. Go see the place he lives in. Then tell him that you’re sorry and that you’ll do anything if he’ll take you back and for the love of god, beg him to stop pining.”
When Tony resurfaced a little later, December 13th or 14th or so, he was met with pretty much the same scene, only Bruce was frowning at the paperwork now too, mug of green tea in hand.
"Well done, Sir Anthony. That was good thinking." Percival agreed. He was still breathing heavily. Steve, of course, wasn't. Too bad, said a small voice in the back of Tony's head that apparently had a vested interest in hearing Steve pant.
They read in relative silence until the dryer is done. It's not uncomfortable, actually, Tony cracks jokes about
So after the meal was cleared they followed the Bajjahs to a small bar with outside seating and a string quartet, near the stern. They selected a standing table in a far corner. Actually, the men did. Yamilla sat at a table nearby where she could view the men without taking part in the conversation. Tony was puzzled, since she had seemed the one in charge during the conversation they had overheard.
Tony turned to him with a smirk at those two lines, but Steve was hopelessly caught in the net of his memories. He was seeing the mess tent where this song had been playing on the radio one cold, rainy morning. Bucky's hand had been bandaged and he'd had trouble with cutting his food. Some of the other guys had been making fun of Bucky, some had been complaining about the food. One of them had commented on what a lovely summer's day it was today, indeed. Peggy had been talking to Colonel Phillips in a corner and she'd smiled at him. He tried to smile at Tony, but he knew it came out all wobbly and he could see the smirk fall off Tony's face.
“I’m good with wards, too, though,” said Steve, wondering if Tony’s assessment was true. It felt true. Mostly. “It just would have taken too long, considering the fact that you were being beaten to a bloody pulp by your diva motorcycle.”
It was the smile more than curiosity that drew Steve out of his bedroll. He sat himself next to Tony. "Want some help?"
He landed on his ass on a rug still holding Tony. He shielded him as best he could from the shock of the impact, but it must have jarred the broken leg, because Tony gave a sudden gasp. Shit. He scrambled upright to assess the damage and was confronted with the sight of a couch full of open-mouthed Avengers who obviously had not expected them to turn up in their living room all of a sudden.
"I never did." Gawaine said, still laughing. "I said God made the bees to provide us with honey, not that they'd happily give it up."
It felt as if he'd searched the same bit of sea for hours, but it really couldn't have been more than minutes -he hoped it hadn't been more than minutes or Tony would already be dead- when he finally spotted a glint of red and gold off to his left and a little above him. It was the gauntlet. To Steve's eternal relief Tony was still attached to it. He grabbed him by the collar and started going up. It was much, much harder than going down. He almost wished he'd taken the time to take off his chain mail before jumping in after Tony. Gritting his teeth, he struggled upward. With a great gasp of air he finally broke the surface. He looked around them. The ship was almost out of sight. No longer weighed down by the serpent it had continued on its way at a rapid clip and there wasn't a chance in hell Steve could overtake it, weighed down as he was. His only option was to swim to land, which looked to be a few miles away at least. He looked at Tony, who was pale and wan in the light of the cloudy afternoon, but he couldn't tell if the man was breathing or not. It couldn't be helped. He allowed himself one sigh of frustration and then he started swimming with Tony in the rescue hold.
"How come you're not doing the bracelet thingie and have it come to you, while I shoot some target practice?" Clint cracked his knuckles.
Tony’s new room was small and a bit dark, because his window faced north, but it looked out over a canal and it had ancient wooden floors and a gigantic custom made loft bed that he had to pay Bruce for. Bruce had purchased it from Clint and Clint from Natasha, and so forth, when they had moved up from the little room to a swankier room. Eventually, as people moved out, Tony would get that opportunity as well, as his resident seniority rose. In theory, anyway, because as it turned out everybody liked their living arrangements well enough that nobody had the urge to move for the next two years.
And with that Steve jumped over the railing. Tony and Clint watched him land, drop and roll onto the deck three stories down, swing himself over the railing there, and catch himself on yet another set of railing bars, rapidly closing in on the zodiac's grappling hook.
Then he had a mild conniption at the implications of using the word 'couple' without feeling an immediate need for disclaimers. And he felt the blood rise to his face when he remembered the nature of that second kiss. That had been... Oh dear lord.... It was so new that it was barely even there, but at the same time he didn't think he'd be able to uproot it even if he wanted to. If he were home, he would have run, not walked, to his workshop right now to lose himself in circuitry designs until he'd managed to forget how fucking awkward it felt to be the Tony Stark part of a couple.
Tony lifted his head, interest piqued. "Internal clock? Serum effect? How precise is it? Did they ever test it?"
Tony swore at her for a bit for good measure before he hung up. He swallowed the last of his coke and signed a few autographs. Then he told himself to man up and took to the air.
Before he could open his mouth to answer though, Phil looked over Tony’s shoulder with a mildly quizzical look.
“Right, right. Yes, we do. Come on, honey, let me run a couple of tests on you and then we go for a spin outside, what do you say?” The bike was virtually jumping for joy and Steve was silently wondering if he really was that obvious and if so, why hadn’t Tony called him on it yet and put him in his place? This was embarrassing.
“Go wait in the limo, Tones. Don’t fuck it up now. I’ll bring him to you when we’ve dealt with all the formalities here.”
A month passed in a blur of writing and editing. Then Clint called. Tony considered not picking up because he had the perfect underhanded insult, masquerading as a reference on the tip of his pen, but Clint started yelling on the answering machine, making all kinds of dire threats if he wouldn’t pick up, so he did.
Steve turned back to his outlook, scanning the surroundings for trouble, be it human or animal. He sighed again. Maybe Loki was right to move him here. Not because of the chivalry. There was a lot less reading poetry to ladies of the court than he'd expected. Maybe that was somewhere else. Maybe they flounced around in rose gardens reciting poetry in France.
They fought well together. Somehow Tony had known they would. Maybe it was all that exposure to Steve's tactical thinking as he had whispered Iron Man through missions, that made their cooperation flow so smoothly now. As if they'd been fighting together for decades. He knew almost intuitively what Steve was going to do next and the same seemed to be true for Steve. Tony was suddenly wondering why he'd been so adamant on being a lone wolf, before. This felt... good. Really good. Maybe they could still fight together occasionally once Steve was back in the role he belonged in.
century after a 70 year long nap in the ice. The fact that he had woken up in a military hospital on a military base had cushioned the transition more than he had realized. While the weapons had changed, and while the army was certainly much more 'inclusive' these days, with negroes, women and queers as combatants, the environment had been familiar and that had been comforting. Now he regretted not getting off base more in the year since had woken up.  He had failed to make much of an effort to adjust to this new century. He had clung to the service, like a baby with a security blanket, and it had been ripped away...
Tony sprawled back on the grass in an overt challenge. Steve gave him a look that he hoped would convey his displeasure. It must have been successful, because Tony shot him his patented smirk in return.
