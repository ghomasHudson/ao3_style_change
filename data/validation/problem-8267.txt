It wasn't that Tony wasn't worried that he had found someone else. Tony loathed himself way too much not to consider that a more than plausible option. He was
"The first time I traveled here, in your dimension, it was my sixteenth birthday. I have no idea what caused it, but one minute I was in my room and the other I was here. And I was so excited because where I'm from my Ma is… gone." he paused for a moment, overwhelmed by emotions.
He got up and wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. "It's stupid I know. I'm not nine anymore, I know it's just the Perseides and Swift-Tuttle comet and me being here won't actually change anything"
"I'm going out. Don't wait up." he informed him icily. He bumped Steve's shoulder and stormed off, away from him and his lies. He could hear him calling his name but he didn't turn back.
Tony stared at him. Then at the wires. Then he turned to Fury. Then back at him.
He made a turn, and with every mile his heart shattered just a little bit more.
Tiberius slumped down in his seat at that moment. “What do you want?” he asked, defeated.
“I don’t know, Natasha! I got caught up in everything and I just...I knew what was at risk but I didn’t care. Every moment I spent with Tony after that was nothing short of amazing.”
“Thanks for sharing such a sweet memory with me,” Steve began, thankfully sidestepping any mention of Howard's A+ parenting. “So does that have anything to do with why me in that sweater was such a turn on?”
“Can we just stop dancing around this, please?” Tony snapped. “I know that what I did was an asshole move, I know I fucked up, and I know I need to apologize to Steve.”
“You know, I used to love Captain Planet, but never in a million years would I have thought I’d be standing here in my twenties dressed as the Heart planeteer. It’s just weird because he was arguably the most useless team member, and I’m arguably the most useful team member at work.”
“What was I supposed to say? I knew you couldn’t see it, but it was obvious that the three of you were becoming the family that we’d always wanted Cora to have. I just knew that she would be better off with you and Tony having primary custody.”
It’d been a long day for Tony so far. He’d woken up earlier than anticipated, and found himself pressed against Steve’s back, arm flung over his chest. Tony told himself that would be his own little secret as he slowly took his arm back and put some space between the two of them. The unhappy whine that came from Steve would be another of Tony’s little secrets.
The brunet slowly leaned in to kiss the man laying in front of him, before resting his forehead against Steve’s. They sate there like that for several minutes, soaking up the bliss of finding out that their baby was a girl. Tony knew that there was no going back after this, but he didn’t care. Sitting there, one thought went through his mind over and over again.
“You know, like beer goggles but with heats- I don’t know. For all I know you’re just like… horny enough to jump anyone and I don’t want to take advantage. And you could probably do better anyway, pretty sure Bucky would be fine with this,” he says and Tony wrinkles his nose.
to be what gets Steve going, flipping them over so he’s poised over Tony before kissing him hard. Tony moans into it, legs curling up to Steve’s waist as he pins one of Tony’s hands above his head. He lets out a moan at that too, because that’s also a thing for him. Steve kisses down his neck, nipping at the skin there and Tony gasps, back arching a little into him. “You want me to use you? That something you like?” he asks harshly and Tony nods as words fail him. “
no. Unlike basically every dumbass alpha who whines and cries about unfair standards I have enough critical thinking skills to know ninety percent of that shit traces back to omegas being treated like ass. Wouldn’t be a problem to be small and thin if those traits weren’t associated with omegas and, you guessed it, the problem isn’t my stature its that we think omegas are weak and feeble-minded. Fix the omega thing and
being in the center of it assuming that’s what he wants in that moment, and during sex he likes to know he’s doing his job well. And Steve? Tony got him out of that absurdly prudish habit he had of being way too quite during sex.
“This is why you clearly mark containers, kids,” Tony says, snickering. “Poor bastard. Sounds like Bucky though.”
his lab. Dummy is entertaining and there’s heating that isn’t Steve’s body heat. Also there are no tents and no stupid teenagers that decided to tag along with friends of friends and okay,
“Yeah, but they don’t show you from my perspective. On the bed,” Steve instructs. Tony rolls his eyes fondly but listens, crawling onto the bed and laying across it. It’s a fuck of a lot better than whatever Steve decided was sleep material worthy before this. That had felt like lying on a damn
right. Shit could have been a horror movie prop. I thought that thing belonged to a zombie. To say it needed medical attention is an understatement, that shit needed amputation. Which Rhodey did
, and Bucky’s hips stutter to a stop as he presses in as far as he can go. His moan is muffled as he bites into Tony’s shoulder and the pain is almost too much and Tony’s back arches into Bucky as he throws his head back.
Across the room Steve has paused what he’s doing, watching with a slightly open mouth and obvious arousal. “Better hurry up,” Tony tells him in a low, almost husky tone. Steve picks up the pace looking around and Tony figures he must find the box he’s looking for because he hears him shuffle things around for a moment. He doesn’t pay attention to where Steve is until he feels the bed sink and he looks over. “Gunna fuck me now?” he asks and Steve looks him over, eyes focused on Tony’s fingers in his ass.
Rhodey looks fully prepared to drop kick Tony and he doesn’t care because he’s got a
“Only you ‘n Bucky,” he tells him.
“Can I ask you kind of a weird question? You don’t need to answer it if you don’t want, god knows I get dumb questions about being black all the time and-” he probably would have continued but Tony knows pretty much exactly where its going and he also knows Sam isn’t a douche bag.
“You’re arguing semantics? Really?” Tony asks.
“One, you’re a bad liar. Two, should I tell Steve you don’t actually hate each other because he’s worried,” he says.
Bucky stares up at him for a long moment before he shakes his head. “Fine, you two like strange shit. Leave me out of it,” he says.
Tony lets out a soft noise of pleasure as he drops Steve’s hand and clings to Bucky’s waist. “
“I’m not,” Tony says honestly. He doesn’t know where he is, point against him. And he’s currently tied to a chair, which is a point for him if he can wiggle a knot loose. He’s also being held with a bunch of computers so he assumes this is some type of security spot in wherever he’s being held, which is flat out stupid of his captors but it does suggest there’s no other place to put him. Which means he’s either in a small location, there’s something dangerous in all the other areas, there’s someone or something important in the other areas that aren’t to be disturbed, or these people are dumber than a sack of hammers with no heads. Any of those are pretty valid options.
, Bucky,
“Well, its Tony,” Steve says in way of an explanation. “He’s always good for us.” He takes another step closer, effectively pinning Tony between Bucky’s body and his. “You look nice like this,” he murmurs, running a hand down Tony’s chest until it hits Bucky’s hand, still at his waistline. His breath hitches for a moment and he’s not even sure what he’s meant to anticipate out of the simple contact between the two, especially when they seem more intent to tease him than please him.
“Come on baby, let me have it,” Tony tells him, whispering in his ear, “let me fell you in me.”
“Your enthusiasm has weird ways of presenting itself,” Steve tells him as he leans in and kisses him, fingers trailing up the inside of Tony’s thigh.
“Yeah, baby?” he asks, mimicking Steve’s words earlier.
. You know, Howard Stark’s prodigal son? Weapons developer?” the person continues when DipFuck doesn’t seem to get the point.
Tony complies, shifting so his knees are under him and lifting his ass into the air, head still on the mattress. Bucky makes a small noise of appreciation, hand settling onto the small of his back for a moment before he pulls away again. Tony lets out a soft huff and Bucky laughs, “won’t be gone long,” he tells Tony.
“I own mirrors, you know,” Tony says.
any fucking coffee in this hellscape. Or maybe Sam has reason to keep quiet, he doesn’t know, but it’s Sam who breaks the silence.
“Actions, hmm?” Steve asks. Tony nods and Steve grins before looking back down at him, if only momentarily, and lifting his skirt a little. Tony lifts his hips to help him out and Steve lets out a small noise of appreciation. “Guess I can do action,” he murmurs before leaning into Tony’s space and licking at the head of his cock. Tony gasps a little as Steve takes him in, working his way down at a torturously slow pace.
,” Steve says, cheeks flushed and breathing heavily.

, Steve. Please, want you,” Tony says, a desperate edge to his voice.

Steve looks him over and yeah, he’s not exactly focused on Tony’s weird bed hogging but Bucky doesn’t really care. “What the

Rhodey nods. “Cool, we’ve established that you’re as stupid as they come can you stop being like that and like… move in with literally anyone else?”
med he needed. Which happens less to him than it used to, but it’s still a semi frequent occurrence. Granted its not as… well,
Tony grins, “I’m adorable,” he says.
“Tony, fuck, I-” Steve says, sentence falling short as he abandons it in favor of fucking into Tony. He’s so close now, Tony can feel it and
“Outfit, not Archibald. Gotta go, honey bee. Call you later,” Tony tells him, blowing him a kiss before he ends the video call.
Steve draws in a shaky breath and slowly presses two fingers in. Tony’s fingers tangle in the sheets, grip tight as he breathes in sharply. “You okay?” Steve asks and Tony nods.
“Wait, can you ride me facing that way- I, uh-” words fail him for a minute as his cheeks turn more red.
“Tony you need to get your stupid ass
be stuck in Florida, the STI infected dick of America,” he says, shuddering.
He leans in and noses at Tony’s neck. Tony shifts so Steve has better access and
“Shoulda worn it when I had exams. I’ve never failed anything,” he says. Not true, he failed high school English several times because who gives a fuck what a metaphor is and that’s not an important subject anyway but MIT classes? Total breeze- there’s no way he’d fail classes in which he’s smarter than the people teaching them and yeah, he should have just brought the uniform over just to tease Steve over an extended period of time. “Coulda fulfilled that fantasy of yours a long time ago,” Tony says, “coulda made you wait the whole month for this,” he points out.
Tony looks
,” he says, panting slightly.
, Tony,” he says, face pressed into Tony’s neck.
For a long moment Steve just stares, taking in Tony’s artfully arranged body, laid out by Steve’s own imagination, and sharp grin. When it becomes apparent Steve isn’t going to move Tony shifts a little, prepared to go to him, but he holds up his hand. “Don’t move,” he says in a low, almost husky tone. “I want to take this in,” he murmurs. Tony settles back into position, happy to play along with this game at least for now.
“Yeah. Also its like these idiots have never seen a dude in a skirt before. Do they not watch Ru Pual’s Drag Race? I thought literally everyone watched that,” he mumbles. Technically he doesn’t really cross dress so much as adopt a more androgynous look that he thinks better reflects his feelings on…
, shit Steve-” his words cut out as he opts for a more wordless appreciation of their efforts. He moans, toes curling a little as Steve finds the right spot, still holding Tony’s hip so he can’t grind back like he wants to because Steve’s awful in the best of ways.

“Tony I don’t think I owe Bucky an apology because he slept with my significant other. If anything I should punch him out,” he mumbles.
room to judge,” Tony tells him in his best condescending tone. He knows it works too because Asshole looks down and frowns like he can’t see something wrong with his clothes. Tony makes sure he gives him a pitying look for it when he looks back up at him too.
I’ve wanted this for months,” he says as he presses into Tony. He arches his back, one hand tangling into Steve’s hair and the other finding its way to Steve’s ass and grabbing it, pressing Steve further into him. Steve moans, “

of Sam reaching across the frame, and its only his disembodied hand that appears in Tony’s line of sight, and smacking Rhodey up side the head. “Don’t be judgmental,” Sam tells him. “He’s slept with less people than you,” he points out.
Tony grins, “you’re gunna be fucked anyway. Lie back,” Tony tells him. He goes to turn around but Steve speaks up before he gets far.
“Well I’ve waited this long, you can wait two more damn seconds,” Bucky tells him. Tony hears a drawer open and Bucky fumble around in it for a moment before it shuts.
Yeah, Tony knows. Bucky still looks confused though so he fills him in. “Stark Industries, weapons designer. Pretty involved in all things military. I’ve been around explosives for longer than I can remember and I’ve always been good at making them. Like I said, its not hard to do if you know what you’re doing. And the Christmas decorations were glass balls, shrapnel is useful to deal with people who aren’t in the immediate blast radius.”
“So what? Living like a poor person sucks and I think I did fine. Now I get to live like a normal person and not be jammed into a tiny apartment,” he says primly.
guns. Stark might be the best as far as weapons go but even the damn Model 1873 from the Civil War would be better than the shit he’d been handed. At least those
He doesn’t expect Steve to reach out to his hips, gripping them tight and changing the pace immediately, moving Tony’s hips the way he wants them to move and oh holy
how much you want me. What’s the point in tormenting yourself with temptation when you don’t need to?” Tony says, head tilted to the side.
“Guess so. Tell him to avoid drooling when he comes by,” Tony adds and he smiles a little but Steve can see the strain there.
“Sure you are, but that doesn’t get rid of the paint smell and it’s drowning the you smell out,” Steve tells him, nipping at his jaw.
. Bucky must not think its permanent though or Tony suspects he would have just gotten rid of the problem- him. Morita has suggested he’s done that at least twice so Tony figures Bucky expects Steve to get over himself except he looks surprised that he’s shared a moment with Steve so now he’s not so sure.
Turns out the music being
“Tony, I-” his words cut out as he moans, nosing at Tony’s neck as he tilts his head to the side for Steve. “I’m-” he starts but words fail him again.
.” Tony tilts his hips up again, a silent invitation for Steve to continue. Steve sits back a little, one hand settling on his thigh while he carefully teases at Tony’s hole with the other. Tony moans, head bending back to expose his throat a little. “
Ah, so he heard, presumably from Pepper. “Brooklyn,” he says, just to throw him for a loop.
“Oh don’t give me that, obviously I’ve been to Brooklyn just not for an… extended period of time. Its nice though,” he says though he’s biased. Obviously Steve’s not dragging him around to shady areas though he’s sure Steve frequents them often, part of the job probably.
“Stop that,” he tells Steve. “And stop ignoring it when I say I love you, its fucking rude,” he says, obviously annoyed.
“Shouldn’t be. You’ll do whatever we want, won’t you baby?” he asks and Tony nods.
to do here and its due tomorrow so he should like… deal with that. Tony, he figures, will find some kind of solution to his problems because he’s weirdly good at that. “You don’t like… happen to have suppressants lying around do you?” he asks and Steve snorts.
“Come on, being the reigning champs of dumb white friends is fun,” Tony says, “you love it.”
acting like a giant jackass. You were the one who brought up that you and Bucky share everything, which seems to be true from what I’ve witnessed. And
Bucky swears under his breath. “Well that explains why they locked you in a room full of guns. Frankly I thought you were going to use
Steve steps in close, running the tips of his fingers along the waistline of Tony’s jeans. “Okay, this isn’t going in the wrong direction but its not going in the right direction either,” Tony says. “So free me and kiss. Or more, preferably more. Please,” he adds, trying to appeal to their nicer nature. It doesn’t seem to do more than amuse Steve and Tony can’t see Bucky’s face but those two probably share a brain so Tony assumes he’s also amused. Which,
not sleeping with your sleazy best friend. I don’t know if he’s got diseases and I’m not finding out by sticking his dick in me, thanks,” he says.
Tony rolls his eyes. “This isn’t my first rodeo sweet cheeks. I’ve gotten out of tougher situations than this.” He doesn’t really expect to be punched in the face but that’s the response he gets. Fucking assholes. “Do you honestly expect me to find that scary?” Howard has hit him harder than that and even if he hadn’t being beaten to a pulp hurts like hell but it’s not scary. Granted he doesn’t think they’d every figure out what he
“You this enthusiastic when you fuck too?” Bucky asks and Tony huffs out a laugh.
He grabs the lube, cursing himself out for not at least managing a quickie with Steve at least a couple times in the last few weeks because then this wouldn’t be so much of a problem but
“Yeah?” Steve murmurs, “tell me what you like.”
“My apologies Bucky, our god damn half asleep boyfriend didn’t consider that empty apartments, no word of a move, and postit notes with addresses on them look like a fucking kidnapping situation to anyone with a half a brain let alone two people who worked in the CIA,” Steve says. There’s a brief pause and Tony thinks for a moment he might get peace but then Steve sighs. “He’s not going to listen to you,” he says, but sticks the phone to Tony’s ear a moment later.
“Okay first of all, I’d have to get paid to be a prostitute and
He wouldn’t, Tony knows that for sure. “I know you wouldn’t do anything I don’t want,” he tells Steve. “You can experiment, if you want.”
“Don’t you hate being hit on all the time?” Rhodey asks.
,” Tony says, snickering.
The good news is that the beginning and the end have good comedy so you'll still have a good time even if the middle is like that 'he a little confused but he got the spirit' gif.
had fevers that ran the same temperatures that omegas deal with though apparently omegas do better with the temperature rise. He’s not entirely sure how true that is.
“Yeah?” Steve murmurs.
He pulls his fingers out slowly, smiling at the results. “Here’s what you’re gunna do for me,” Steve tells him, pressing his fingers back in. Tony bites his lip, throwing his head back a little. “First of all not that, I want to hear you. Wanna see you. So don’t fuckin hold back on me,” Steve tells him. “Now, what you’re gunna do,” he murmurs as he pulls his fingers out again, leaning over Tony. “Is finger yourself, open yourself up for me and I want it to be good too. Give me a show,” Steve tells him.

Steve looks like a tree full of lemons has been shoved up his salted ass but Bucky’s not about to miss out on this. “We’ve partaken a few times,” he says, smacking Steve’s hand away when he tries to smack him. His hand ends up being smacked by Tony anyway and he goes from looking like a scorned cat to a scorned grandmother. Bucky grins, shaking his head because Steve really did bring home a winner. He’s one hundred percent sure there’s no one else like Tony out there and Tony is the one for him. Even if he has to put up with Steve’s stupid ass.
He lifts a hand from Bucky’s chest and presses Steve’s hand in closer so it sits around his neck and Steve gasps softly behind him and Tony can
He grabs Steve’s shirt and hauls his ass closer. “In the last three days I have been kidnapped, waterboarded for several hours, punched in the face, violently strangled, and I accidentally caught myself in my own blasts
He looks Tony up and down and it’s so
He nods, a little lost for words at the moment. Instead he focuses on Bucky, the way his hand is moving, his own pleasure as his hands grip the sheets. Foreplay isn’t always his thing but this is the kind of thing he’s always enjoyed. Mostly he likes the attention of it, Bucky’s eyes on him as he watches Tony’s reaction but there’s the fact that Bucky knows what he’s doing too.
“Come on baby, you know you wanna cum. S’okay, want you to,” Tony tells him as Steve shifts his position to sit up, changing the angle that Tony’s sitting at and he moans as Steve reaches around, under the skirt, to jerk him off. His other hand remains on Tony’s hip, guiding his movements and its rough and sloppy but
Steve nods and kisses him, “oh you have no idea,” he almost growls into Tony’s mouth. He moans, curling a leg up Steve’s side to try and draw him closer. Steve shivers, kisses dipping back down to Tony’s neck as Tony noses at Steve’s jaw.
interested in me. Have I lost my touch?” Bucky tells him no, Steve’s immunity tells him yes.
,” he says fast, words blending together.
, yeah. Again,” Bucky tells him, breath coming faster now.
“I swear its like everything about you was tailor made for me,” he says, leaning back in and scenting Tony’s neck. He moans, curling his fingers into Steve’s hair and arching his back into him. “Yeah that’s it Tony, let me hear you,” Steve murmurs, sucking at a patch on Tony’s neck. “Tell me what you want,” he adds, teeth grazing over Tony’s jaw.
Tony snickers, “I can deal with that, at least as long as you aren’t a jackass,” he murmurs as he leans in and kisses Steve.
He rolls his eyes, “not like you didn’t want it,” he points out. He’s not a savage either, he at least knows how to read a damn room and for a bit there he thought Steve was fucking immune to his damn
Tony, do that again,” Bucky tells him.
“You brought it up apparently and I’m not about to turn that down. Might if I don’t get some semblance of my bed back soon. There’s no damn reason for him to take up this much space.”
He’s been told his eighties meets hippie dipped in black is a weird look but he likes the flow-y skirts and Steve’s vegan ass can eat it, leather is great. “Unlike some people I prefer style,” he says, giving the ill-fitting jeans and T-shirt the guy is wearing a disdainful look.
. I don’t have patience for whatever bullshit you’re trying to pull so how about you get with the god damn program and communicate like a fucking adult,” Tony tells him, sounding strangely like Rhodey. Is this what its like to deal with himself? God he hopes not because he’s annoying if so.
When they get to the right spot though he’s shocked when something
Tony grins, “great.”
Tony nods, “mhm. Yeah, s’good,
Tony though, he remains forcefully ignorant to Steve’s attitude as he reaches out to Bucky despite being perched in Steve’s lap and he really shouldn’t push it with Steve at this point, he
“Not sure, depends on what Pepper’s doing,” he says. “You?”
“That’s hilarious, wanna have sex?” Tony asks and Steve blinks rapidly because
“You asked him out yet?” he asks and Steve might toss Bucky through that window himself.
Steve laughs a little, “keep riding my dick like this and you just might be,” he tells Tony. “You feel fuckin good,” Steve tells him, “
“I lasted just fine, thanks,” he says in his own defense.
Tony’s breath is coming fast and he’s having a hard time concentrating through Steve’s touch because it’s
“You’re more than tempted if you wanted Steve out of the house
He tilts himself up to see what Steve’s doing and Steve shakes his head at him, “you’ll feel all the action,” he tells Tony, reminding him of the first time they slept together, except their positions are reversed and there’s no Bucky here at the moment.
He drops a hand to Steve’s on his waist, twining his fingers with Steve’s. Steve squeezes them a little, a small moment of intimacy that Tony appreciates as he presses back into Steve and Bucky’s hands. “
“But I have complicated feelings on that,” Tony says for him and Sam nods.
He’s surprised when Steve deposits him at Bucky’s door, “stay here,” he tells Tony as he looks down at him. He resents that he’s
Given the look on Steve’s face he’s it’s a thought of the past anyway. “That shirt mine?” he asks and Tony barely resists the urge to roll his eyes.

Tony looks over at the window and starts laughing. “Remember when we met and I opened the window only to find that it doesn’t open all the way and made that like… really blasé comment that they must not want us to commit suicide in the building? Your
Steve flips him off and leaves in a huff and Bucky rolls his eyes. He figures Steve will get over it.
“It literally falls under the ‘B’ in BDSM!” Bucky says in his own defense.
Steve shakes his head, “only you,” he murmurs. “Get up. This room smells like paint and the half finished wall is irritating me,” he says.
. “Sorry, its just that you looked absurd,” Steve tells him, shrugging a little. Tony flips him off and goes back to rooting around in his bag for a few moments.
no, I love gluten but if I get even a
Steve looks over at him and grins, “so what was the rest of that story?” he asks.
to his tastes so isn’t enough to make hanging out with annoying drunk high schoolers fun but that doesn’t mean Tony doesn’t have his own plans. Rhodey frowns on screen, tilting his head like he’s going to get a better view that way when Tony would have to change the way his phone is held to get that result. “What are you wearing?” he asks.
He pulls Steve in for a kiss, “jealous, hmm?” he asks and Steve nods.
Steve snorts, pulling him in close and pressing his face into his neck. “Is that how you think this works?” he murmurs, hand sliding up his ass. Tony sucks in a breath as Steve presses his fingers back into him. “Sure about that?” he asks as he curls his fingers and Tony gasps.
? Oh my god, if you’re talking about Nat, Wanda, and Peggy I’m dating any of them and the rest are all Nat, she likes disguises it’s a long story. I don’t think I’ve dated anyone in like… too long to remember.” Last person was Peggy and that… he’s not entirely sure what happened there but they’re still friends so.
Steve and Bucky exchange a look and burst out laughing.
Rhodey snorts, “they’re your age, why are you complaining?” he asks like Tony acts his age. He doesn’t, never really has. Downsides of growing up a genius and in the public eye though he’s allowed himself to fade a bit from public view the last few years. His thing is science over celebrity but he’ll make a comeback when he feels like it.
“Come here,” Bucky says and Tony walks over, letting out a surprised noise when Bucky pulls him in close, spinning him around and pinning his hands over his head. Steve gives him an appreciative once over and how do they do that? Just make a bunch of plans without doing more than looking at each other? It makes no sense, like witchcraft.
“Always,” he tells Tony, standing up and grabbing his hand. Tony’s pretty sure Rumlow mumbles ‘gross’ behind them so he flips him off for good measure.
appreciate me saying. It’s funny now, but I was concerned then- his poor penis was a medical emergency. Anyway, we went to the hospital and clearly little Rhodey recovered just fine, and I do know this because I was on Dick Checking Duty for like a month and
much shorter than Steve still even with the heels, though it does make for a pretty image. “Stay,” Steve tells him again as he backs up, eyes on Tony the whole way to Bucky’s bed. Once he hits it he sits down, keeping his eyes on Tony for just a moment before he scrambles up the bed, looking behind him to see where he’s going before he turns back to Tony. “Come here,” he says and Tony grins.
“Fuck off, Rumlow,” Steve says, appearing from behind Tony with some sticks. Tony wrinkles his nose because he’s been reminded he’s in nature and he
“Do I
He moves a little faster, picking up the pace slowly just for the satisfaction of feeling both Steve and Bucky get antsy. “
He considers changing his answer but no one would ever accuse him of being smart outside of engineering so he doesn’t. Instead he reaches out and curls his fingers in Bucky’s hair, pulling at it a little. “Mm, pretty sure I’ll like whatever it is you do,” he says, grinning when Bucky moans into his neck.
,” he tells Tony as Steve pulls away.
They lapse back into silence for a long few moments. “Can I ask a question?” Tony asks and Sam sighs, looking like he regrets this already.
Bucky looks confused, “what are you talking about?” he asks.
of all things as he presses two fingers into himself. “That’s it,” Steve tells him, “just like that. Little faster for me, Tony. Yeah, there you go,” Steve murmurs as Tony picks up the pace. Its been a long time since he’d done this, feels better when other people do it to him but the look on Steve’s face is worth the effort. He’s poised over Tony, watching as he fucks himself with his fingers, mouth slightly hung open as his fingers flex on Tony’s thighs. Tony moans softly, unable to help it as Steve licks his lips.
“Low iron, bruises easily. And god help me if I don’t wear sunscreen. If you think cherry tomatoes are red you haven’t seen shit.” He made that mistake exactly
anything else to sit on but no, he’s stuck on a log. “Its not that bad,” Steve murmurs in his ear like he genuinely thinks that’s true.
? Absolutely
Bucky’s hand slides down his back and over his ass, squeezing it a little and Tony moans, trying his best to press back into the contact, further onto Steve’s fingers. Doesn’t work too well with Steve still holding him and he’s considering a way to thwart that when Bucky reaches around Steve’s hand and presses another finger into his hole. “
Steve procrastinates his drawing by watching Tony root around in his bed side table presumably for suppressants. He doesn’t seem to find them there so he swears, grabbing his backpack and shoving his entire head into it. Steve can’t help but laugh at the image because Tony looks ridiculous but he must not appreciate it because he pulls his head back out and gives him a
“You think I cut gluten out of my diet for fun?
“No, no. Don’t hide from me,” he murmurs. “S’okay. This… this is fuckin amazing Tony, so fuckin good. Been dreaming about you dressed like this basically since I met you,” he tells him. He bites his lip again and Steve lets out a soft huff. “Stop that. I wanna see you moan. Be good for me,” he says and Tony sucks in a breath, barely resisting the urge to bite his lip again. “Like that,” Steve murmurs as his hands slide back down to Tony’s thighs. “What made you recreate this, hmm? Just me?” he asks.
you feel fucking perfect.” He pulls away for a half a second, looking at Steve over Tony’s head and honestly he thinks that’s kind of rude and he’s not even
Also, I'll probably add stuff to this universe because I like it and I think its cute.
Bucky shrugs, “wouldn’t be much of a loss,” he says a bit too casually. Tony’s sure both of them have killed people, downside of the whole mob thing, but he also hopes the circumstances were
He crawls backwards onto the bed, watching Bucky walk closer, eyes roaming neatly over his body. “Like something you see?” he asks cockily.
He lets Steve set the pace, slower than he’d like but its good. Behind him Steve moans softly as he presses in further, “
It works because he considers it for a moment before he squints at him, “how do you even know this is a thing?” he asks.
“You like to be marked?” Steve asks and Tony nods.
“I… what?” He’s got nothing better and yeah okay maybe,
“Yeah, this isn’t normal even for middle class people. Pretty sure every apartment I’ve ever lived in can fit into this room,” he says. Tony twists to look around, trying to gauge square footage.
Steve reaches over and yanks a strand of Bucky’s hair, resulting in him sitting straight up and giving Steve a confused and slightly horrified look. Tony sighs, “you’ve known each other for
He unbuttons Steve’s pants, “get these off too,” he murmurs and Steve laughs softly. He leans back in and kisses Tony softly.
Bucky laughs, “did you hear that? Somebody’s got it bad,” Bucky murmurs.
too much space.
Tony, however, looks confused. “You have a new girlfriend like every week,” he says and Steve’s eyebrows shoot up.
The door opened and Steve sheepishly came in, looking like a lost puppy.
In the post-confession silence, Tony felt like someone had brushed away the clouds that had obscured his sight. Now that everything was clear, now that Steve could stop with the secrets and the lazy excuses, they could truly be happy. There was just one thing he still needed to know.
"We have to eat something, while we're up here" he explained. Tony's eyes softened. His heart grew three sizes.
"Steve, you don't have to do this-"
deeply offended" said Tony. Steve bolted upright again, nodding with a miserable expression on his face.
Since the blip -- god how he loathed that name. it made it seem like what thanos did wasn't the most brutal genocide in earth's (the universe's, really) history-- anyway, since the catastrophe, New York had been significantly quieter. Not calm, never calm, just quieter. There were much less lights, the sidewalks weren't full of busy people every moment and the decadence that had claimed almost every place was also taking a bit of the Big Apple. It was still the city that never slept, though. Stubborn motherfuckers, the new yorkers.
“With a third person involved,” Bucky says. “So it doesn’t count.”
Steve leans against the wall, laughing. “Did he not go to a reputable piercer?” he asks.
long and you manage to try and torment him by doing something he considers a huge turn on?” he asks, frowning at Steve, who quickly realizes his mistake. “God you’re being dumb,” Tony mumbles, settling back into Steve’s lap and pulling Bucky back in again.
blood. He can file that under yet another thing he shouldn’t find attractive that Rhodey would more than likely ‘white people’ at. Unless he’s got a thing for pretty white guys in al black with questionable blood on them but he doubts it on account of Rhodey is a reasonable and practical person.
Tony moans, “please Steve, want you in me.
, Buck. Wanted to fuck you for months, show me how it feels,” he tells Bucky, trying mostly unsuccessfully to press back into him.
if you’re not inside me in the next five fucking seconds I will spontaneously combust,” he says. He’s serious about it too, he
“Flip over,” Bucky tells him voice firm and
Tony shrugs delicately, “maybe,” he says like this is something he’d come up with on his own. It is, actually, except sans the white because he hates white. He’d be in the rich burgundy of the shoes he’s wearing if he had his choice. The color looks nice on him, hence why he chose it for the shoes. But, in this case, it’s not his imagination run wild that’s led to this; it’s Steve’s.
?” Because he’s confused if Tony’s implying what he thinks he’s implying.
“Oh I know that’s probably not true,” he says and Tony gasps when Bucky presses two fingers in him. “But I’ll take your appreciation here.”
“Fucking
,” he adds, not entirely sure what he’s begging for at this point.
because apparently it’s his sole goal to piss him off right now.
“I agreed to date his friend too,” Tony throws out jus to make sure Rhodey wins this competition because so far he’s the reigning champ of dumb white friends and he’s not about to break that streak for him or Rhodey.
Tony rolls his eyes, “please, you’ve been friends your whole lives. He’s not going to be so mad that your friendship is genuinely in danger.” He’s seen them together, whatever kind of relationship they have it’s not the kind that’s easily shaken. You don’t know someone that well, become
“Do you really want to kiss me that bad?” Bucky asks and Steve wrinkles his nose.
“Asthma,” Steve says.
“I know,” he and Steve say in sync.
Tony, who has a visible fever, lets out an annoyed sigh. “No, I feel like ass,” he mumbles. He walks over to his bed and falls on it, face planting into the pillow and that’s about when Steve gets a good whiff of him and he sighs.
Steve laughs, “you’re not the only one who likes teasing,” he tells Tony, grinning at him.
Tony would call him an ass for it but he gets the absolute
“I mean it kind of is. So you’re stuck with some small minded children, you

out of these fucking clothes.” Steve hesitates for a moment, one hand moving to the hem of his shirt and pausing there for a moment. Tony has no time for that though so he reaches out and pulls the shirt off himself, tossing it aside. Its not like he hasn’t seen Steve shirtless before but damn he looks
Even handcuffs put him off because, as he once told Tony, ‘I’m not a criminal, Tones, why would I want to be cuffed?’ No imagination with that one as much as he loves Rhodey. Then he ended up with Bucky anyway so it didn’t matter, and by the time Bucky’s more conventional tastes came to light he had Steve so its fine. Would have been even without Steve, honestly. Tony loves
. To. Have.
Steve gasps, burying his face into Tony’s neck and moaning. The hand he’s got on Tony’s hip tightens as he noses his way up Tony’s neck, scenting his softly and it’s not nearly enough. “
The comment earns him a soft laugh, “oh yeah, I’m gunna fuck you with it. Then you’re gunna beg for me to fuck you,” he says.
When Sam sees him he looks surprised probably on account of Tony being a known night person. Its not as if Sam’s never heard him complain about morning classes so he figures he’s earned the right to look surprised. “You look annoyed,” Sam says and Tony wrinkles his nose.
damnit. It’s his best friend duty to care. “Is that like, normal?” Tony asks because Rhodey is like one of five alphas he’s met that don’t suck and come on, he
, that’s good.
Steve lets out a soft noise of discontent, “but I want to touch you,” he whines and Tony rolls his eyes.
Sam looks at him like he’s especially stupid. “Yeah alright, I fold. You’ve got the dumbest white boy,” he says, walking out.
“Seriously, Buck?” he asks and Bucky shrugs.
obvious he wants to figure out what the big deal is and Tony’s pretty tempted to take matters into his own hands at this point. Its not like Bucky’s stupid, he
, feeling of you two inside me. Yeah, that’s good. You can move, s’okay,” Tony tells Steve. “Always take care of me,” he murmurs as Steve shoos Bucky’s hands from his hips so he can control Tony’s movements.
“You need real problems,” Rhodey mumbles and that’s fucking rude.
Steve snorts, “baby your slick is everywhere, bottom of your foot included I guess.”
“That’s nice. Can we get back to the subject at hand?” he asks, giving Steve an irritated look.
man should be that excited to see a normal looking penis,” he says, shaking his head.
Steve’s breath hitches and Tony hears Steve open the condom package. “Jesus fucking Christ,” Steve says, words tumbling together. “You should see yourself like this, skirt ridden up around your hips, fingering yourself open like that. On display- for
of your ass, make peace with my relationship with Bucky, and Bucky, come here,” he says, reaching out and wiggling his fingers. Bucky shakes his head, smiling a little as he comes over and takes Tony’s hand when he gets close enough. He seems surprised when Tony yanks him onto the bed and Steve, little
Tony wouldn’t have even needed that if Steve gave him the time to respond. He crawls into Steve’s lap enthusiastically, positioning himself and Steve right before sinking down onto his dick. They both moan as he does. “Ride me,” Steve tells him, voice harsh in his ear. Tony shivers and starts to move slowly, drawing it out a little as he drapes his arms around Steve’s neck for balance. “Don’t fuckin tease me Tony, move faster,” Steve tells him and he lets out a soft noise of pleasure as he picks up the pace. Steve grabs his hips, moving him the way he wants and Tony lets him, adjusting the way he moves to the way Steve wants him to. “Fuck yeah, that’s it Tony. Fuck me good, just like that,” he says. “You’re so good like this,” he murmurs, “feel fucking amazing on my dick.”
“No, its Bucky’s,” he says. “Don’t look at me like that obviously it’s yours you twit. Would kinda ruin the image if it wasn’t,” he points out.
This, he’s good at and he knows it. He’s had enough practice and even so he took plenty of time figuring Steve out. He knows how to fuck him the way he likes, how to shift his hips just right to get him to moan the way he is now. “Shoulda worn this a long time ago,” Tony murmurs.

this chapter was hard won. It took me
done and it’d be funny if not for Steve’s confusion. But when Tony gets out of bed and walks over to his, grabbing his notebook and tossing it aside in favor of replacing it in Steve’s lap with himself so he can’t say he’s complaining. Tony leans forward and Steve has no fucking clue what to do here because this is unexpected and it shouldn’t be, he guesses, on account of Tony knowing nothing of subtly and he runs on being far too bold and blunt for his own good. So this seems like a normal thing he’d do but Steve still didn’t expect it.
Archibald,” Rhodey says. The look on their faces when it happened was priceless too. Archibald because he was freaked out that Rhodey knew his name when he’d never mentioned it and Rhodey because his attempt at picking out a Standard Rich White Guy Name ended up being a correct guess.
Well, at least he already knows Tony’s M.O. Not that he wants to do that either, he’s not a morning person. He’s not really an afternoon person either, he’s a whenever he feels awake enough to interact with people kind of person. “So? Deal with it,” Tony mumbles.
Tony looks kind of impressed as he slinks out of the bathroom. “I didn’t know you knew that.”
Tony laughs softly in Bucky’s ear, “baby I
They sit like that for a long moment before Tony speaks. “Quick question, why the hell is there slick on the bottom of my
“Bucky’s a fuckin adult he knows how to use the subway get back here,” Tony mumbles.
yeah that’s good,” he says, breath hitching as Bucky hits the right spot. “I… M’getting close,” he tells them.

Steve rolls his eyes fondly, “give me a damn minute,” he tells Tony, looking around at the damn boxes and oh come

Tony moans as Steve’s hands dip into his pants, feeling him. He moans, pressing himself into Steve’s hand for more friction but he’s a bastard and he pulls away
finds scary but still.
“Kinda why I never said anything about my thing for it. Didn’t want to take it too far,” he murmurs.
Turns out its neither of those options and he ends up being strangled harder which like, not particularly cool but its not like Tony’s hands are currently available to fight himself free not that he thinks he’d do a good job of it. He’s always been better with defense than offense. Not that he can do much of
“I swear you have no idea how gorgeous you are,” Steve murmurs, pressing his face into Tony’s neck
The best he finds is a bunch of cleaning supplies, some Christmas decorations, and that pile of crap guns he’s supposed to fix. He picks up a Christmas decoration and frowns at the ball, wondering what the hell his life has become. What the hell is he supposed to do with cleaning supplies, useless weapons, and

When he doesn’t move after a moment Tony prods him, moving the hand that’s not currently pinning his wrist down to his ass. Steve sucks in a breath when he feels Tony, “shit, you
Bucky pulls away, releasing his hand and pulling out. Tony makes an irritated noise, “Buck-”

Thankfully Tony relaxes though, “oh thank
“Sometimes… people aren’t interested in you,” Rhodey says and Tony throws a peanut at him.
Tony laughs softly, “don’t really tell many people that. They tend to take it as ‘I can do whatever I want now.’ Knew you wouldn’t.” Even in his using Tony for his own pleasure he managed to put Tony’s pleasure first mostly.
,” Steve whines at him. Tony elects to ignore him and kisses his way back down Steve’s neck, sucking at the skin there and Steve wiggles underneath him. He loves when Steve’s like this, desperate and a little needy. Makes everything better for Tony, him being like this. Tony’s always liked attention,

“We uh, didn’t expect you to fly home over it,” Steve tells him.
They lapse back into silence for another few minutes before a light bulb goes off in Tony’s head. “Hey, you two assholes never even kissed again! I’ve been
the water, despite being pretty hot, get cooler and he sighs, turning off the damn tap so he can drag his ass back to his bed preferably.
“Want you to move faster,” he tells Steve, urging him along. Steve complies, picking up the pace as he moves to kiss Tony, moaning as he does. “Yeah baby, that’s it,” Tony tells him. “Feels good,” he murmurs.
He knows that’s at least partially true because Steve seems to entrust all things fighting to Bucky though Tony wonders where Bucky got his experience. And Steve for that matter, even if he happens to know from talk that Steve largely prefers defense to offense. Not exactly all that different than himself. Tony shrugs though, “I happen to be smart in other areas, not talented in being able to beat people up.”
For a moment Bucky pulls back and Tony’s sure he’s going to abandon this but he doesn’t. Instead he abandons the idea of leaving Tony because he grabs his hips hard and pulls him into a kiss. Tony lets out a noise of surprise but goes with it, arms twisting tighter around Bucky’s neck as one of Bucky’s hands dips lower, curling his hand over Tony’s ass and squeezing. He lets out a soft moan as Bucky presses him in closer that way, kiss frantic and overdue as he seems to desperately try to make up for lost time. Tony allows Bucky to control the kiss, nipping at his bottom lip and kissing his way down Tony’s neck like Tony will disappear if he doesn’t do it all now. He tilts his head to the side to give Bucky better access and Bucky breathes out a soft moan.
that, pay attention,” Tony tells him, nuzzling at his jaw. “Wanna feel you stretch me out, hear you when you cum,” Tony murmurs.
but whatever. Point is having a dong doesn’t mean you can’t rock a skirt and he thinks he looks better in most in them. Not to mention male genital structure means skirts make more sense than pants but whatever.
Rhodey frowns, looking around presumably at Tony’s surroundings. “Where are you?” he asks.
“I’m tempted but uh-” he cuts himself off, clenching his jaw like he can’t even bring himself to turn Tony down.
“Can’t leave this one hanging,” Bucky says from across the room like he doesn’t have ulterior motives.
“Fucking right I did, have pretty much since I met you but that’s not the issue at hand here. In the shower,” Steve tells him, prodding at him again.
Tony, however, sits up straight and swears and this happens every month but it’s not usually this far gone by the time he realizes and takes a suppressant. Not that Steve minds, not really, given that Tony can’t exactly help it. Not that he’d mind anyway, Tony always smells nice but usually there’s a chemical undertone to it, results of artificial scents, but his natural scent is nice too. Not that Steve would ever tell him that because unlike
He wrinkles his nose as Bucky starts yelling about being worried. “M’not dead,” he mumbles and then hangs up, dropping Steve’s phone on the floor and pressing his face back into his chest.
Well, okay, it
who likes mornings. They remain silent for a long moment, mostly enjoying each other’s company in silence or maybe that’s just Tony not wanting to talk without morning coffee because there
why he didn’t say anything? Yeah, that wouldn’t be a problem. Tony only does what he wants when he wants anyway and he’s always been like that.
“Thank
Tony wrinkles his nose, “oh please don’t tell me you’re one of those, I had high hopes,” he says.
“Am I not distracting enough?” Tony asks, head tilted to the side.
“Okay well its not my fault that you two are you know,
He throws back his head, panting as Bucky sets a punishing pace. Bucky takes advantage by leaning in and kissing his way down Tony’s neck, teeth grazing his neck almost roughly as he moves down the column of Tony’s throat. With his free hand Tony tangles it in Bucky’s hair, fingers keeping a loose grip that still makes Bucky moan.
“The fuck kind of attempt at wingman is
He’s sure Bucky’s got a whole list of stupid reasons why this could be a bad idea. “Yeah, something tells me Steve wouldn’t be happy about this,” he murmurs and Tony snorts.
, like that Bucky,” he murmurs, babbling a little. He can hear Bucky’s breathing pick up too, the small little noises of pleasure he makes and that’s even fucking better. He loves it when he and Steve do that, let out these unconscious moans that let him know its good for them.
Steve shakes his head, standing back for a moment and grabbing one of Tony’s ankles, uncrossing it from where it was resting against his other foot as he pulls Tony’s leg to the other side of his hip. He looks good there, between Tony’s legs. Steve clearly likes the image too, and it must be a pretty one, debauched omega wearing his shirt looking just a little rumpled in stockings and heels and all.
Steve rolls his eyes, “I’m
“Always so damn pushy,” Steve murmurs. “Can’t just let me appreciate you like this, spread out for me. Always gotta hurry me along.”
For a few moments Steve remains silent. “I don’t think sex positions belonged in that list,” he says eventually and Tony, bless him, looks quite like a scorned cat.
There’s a layer of suspicion in his voice, but its not out shadowed by his admiration. Tony sighs, “my father is Howard Stark, if that tells you anything,” he mumbles, clenching his jaw. He’s not surprised when its Steve who reacts first, jolting a little and jostling Tony as he does it.
- figure it out its always good,” he murmurs, leaning forward a little to give Steve better access to his hole. “Like-
“Maybe not, but I’m not exactly a shining example of an alpha. I’m

, think?”
Again, he wonders if this is what its like dealing with himself. If so Rhodey is a goddamn hero and Pepper deserves a metal because if he is this emotionally obtuse all the time he would have thrown himself out a window.
,” he repeats, pulling Tony’s hand away from his ass. He lets out an annoyed moan and Steve laughs. “Don’t give me attitude,” he tells him. “I know what you need anyway hmm?”
He moans at that, pressing his face into Steve’s neck and earning a sharp moan out of him too. “Scent me,” he tells Tony, tilting his head to the side. Tony noses at his neck a little, kissing up the side of his neck and sucking at the skin there before he rubs his cheek along his neck. “
is turned down. The hell gave you the impression I wasn’t?” Sure shit isn’t his smooth talking and easy relationships, he’s got none of either of those things.
“Mine,” Steve says and Tony nods almost frantically.
He gives Tony’s ass a light smack, “you and your damn impatience,” Bucky murmurs. “Give me a damn second.”
in bed ever again,” Tony tells him.
“Bondage is tame unless you’ve got some impressive stuff going on, Buck. Just accept that your tastes in sex are plain. Nothing wrong with that, Tony doesn’t seem to mind any,” Steve points out. He doesn’t, not really, though he does with Bucky was a little more open to some things. But that’s why he’s got Steve, who seems to have a much more ‘I’ll try it once’ kind of attitude. He probably would have tested a bunch of things out on Rhodey if Rhodey weren’t more vanilla than Bucky.
“I assume your other eye works fine so can you see my interest
I’m okay, so okay. Move baby, wanna feel you,” Tony tells him. Steve nods, shifting his position so he’s got one arm above Tony’s head balancing himself as he looks down at Tony. Then he starts to move, slowly at first and Tony gasps softly, biting his lip to hold back his reaction some.
“Thought so,” he says as he pulls away, earning an upset noise out of Steve. “Don’t be greedy baby, I’ll take care of you,” Tony tells him. Not like he doesn’t always- he’s gotten good at reading a room and Steve’s not shy once he’s interested. Steve clasps his hands together above his head, giving Tony something of a desperate look and that’s cute. He reaches out and traces a finger along Steve’s jawline. Tony’s got no idea why his classmates hadn’t shown any interest in him before, and it took Tony time to convince Steve of his beauty, but he managed. He’s always liked a challenge and frankly doing everything he can to convince Steve he’s gorgeous really wasn’t much of a hardship to him.
He tosses a gun aside, irritated that he’s been dunked into this and he’s a little surprised the gun doesn’t blow up or something. For a long moment he considers his options and he might just shoot himself out of pity at his situation if he weren’t positive the fucking guns would jam. Major problem with Hammer anything, it only works like thirty percent of the time. So instead he decides to fuck around the room because what else has he got to do? Fix an unfixable design? He can only get rid of design flaws if the entire design isn’t a flaw to begin with so he figures he might as well make the best of his time and fuck around. Probably going to get him tortured again but whatever.
Tony pouts at them both but he’s at least getting what he wants out of it so he complies. Steve snags the back of his shirt and pulls him back, “without this,” he murmurs, lifting it over Tony’s head and tossing it aside. Tony turns and leans into Steve, standing on his toes and wrapping his arms around his neck so he can kiss him. Steve smiles into the action, nipping at Tony’s bottom lip.
Bucky pulls away and Tony lets out a whine, “bedroom,
, yes, Bucky,” he moans, burying his face in Bucky’s chest. He and Steve work him open some more, moving together in a quick, seemingly practiced way though Tony knows that’s probably less planning an experience and more knowing each other freakishly well. “Yeah, Bucky. Like that, just like-
Bucky pulls him into a kiss, moaning into his mouth as the back of his legs hit the bed. Tony pushes him gently, dropping Steve’s hand to do it, and Bucky sits down, nuzzling Tony’s stomach as he does. Tony runs his fingers through Bucky’s long hair as Steve comes up behind him, hands settling on his waist. “How is it that I always end up naked first? And this time I had lots of clothes on so that’s no excuse. Get naked,” Tony tells them, reaching down to lift Bucky’s shirt over his head. He can hear Steve toss his behind him and he pushed Bucky onto his back. “Pants. Off,” Tony instructs.
“What… where did you even come up with that?”
Steve took a step forward, smiling as he extended his hand. “Hi, Ben, I’m Steve, I’m the assistant coach with Tony at Midtown High School. This is my first ever meet up and I’m excited to see what everyone’s been working on. Did you bring any bots with you today?”
Tony took in all that Steve was telling him. He wasn’t sure whether to find some of these things absolutely terrifying or unreasonably adorable. He settled for some strange combination of both once he realized he had zoned out and was missing vital information.
Steve looked at Tony, confused. The brunet rolled his eyes, then gave Steve a lopsided smile as he pulled up a stool for him. “Take a seat and watch while I work on building and programming this,” Tony said, pointing to what he was holding, “and then we can get some scraps together to build the actual bot.”
“So normally I would tell you to go in there and do that Pepper thing that gets him to do stuff,” Rhodey explained, standing outside of he and Tony’s dorm room.
He knew his mom didn’t want him to break his back working to keep her taken care of, so he quickly continued before she had a chance to argue.
“Ow!” he whined, licking over his quickly swelling lip.
“Aye aye, Captain,” Tony said, giving a small salute before heading up the stairs to the master bedroom. Once he got to their room, he took stock of the setup that Steve had. A small glass for water throughout the night and a copy of the latest book he was reading sat atop the left bedside table. Tony found the simplicity of Steve's nighttime habits to be unbelievably endearing. Especially when he himself pulled out his Stark Pad to keep bedside, in the event he wanted to continue working on anything from the comfort of his bed.
With all that said, most alphas and omegas could coexist peacefully, with the exception of Tony and Steve. More often than not, people just assumed that Tony was adamant on asserting his dominance, while Steve was adamant on asserting his position as an equal. Neither ever wanted to budge on their ideas, and it always came down to their team pleading with them to agree to compromise. It was a tough way to work, but together, Steve and Tony created some of the most amazing graphic design concepts their clients had ever seen.
“So...it seems as though you and Steve are getting rather chummy,” Pepper said with a fond smirk.
He turned around from the task at hand to see Steve standing in the workshop with some food.
“Enough!” Steve roared as he turned to throw the axe he’d been holding. “What is this, fucking Mambo #5? You don’t have to list every failed relationship I’ve ever had. I get it, I’m a fuck up when it comes to choosing people to love. Can we just get back to throwing sharp stuff at targets and stop putting my love life under a fucking microscope?!”
“How…How are you so sure I’m not sorry for what happened?”
“I…” Steve took a long breath. “I think you should leave. If you fall asleep then Cora might see you and--”
In the handful of weeks they had been together, Steve and Tony had done all of this before. Making out, hand jobs, blow jobs, even sex. But Tony had always been the one to bottom. They’d talked about it, and Steve had expressed interest in wanting to switch roles at some point. Tony just didn't expect that point to be right now.
“Hey ma’” Steve spoke softly.
“Hey!” Steve yelled, flat on his back in the snow.
Pepper teased.
“Yeah,” Natasha said nodding. “We’re doing this. Now.”
“Well, since you were busy and you weren’t feeling well, I decided to bring you back some soup. And before you ask, it’s not chicken noodle, it’s Italian wedding soup.”
Tony stood and smiled down at the smaller man.
“No!” Tony screeched. “Fuck me.”
“Then what were you two laughing about when you came back into dinner?”
“Fine. I’ll text you in a few,” Carol spoke before hanging up abruptly.
“As hard as it is to believe, I actually do have a life outside of
It was this fact that kept Steve coming back. For all the grief and stress working with Tony gave him, he really did love his job, his team and the work they did together.
“Fair point…” Tony offered, not wanting to fully admit that his friends were right, “How about this, next weekend I’ll set something up, ok? Is that enough to get you guys off my back?”
Tony sat in the driver's seat, clutching the steering wheel so hard his knuckles were white. He and Rhodey had been driving back to Midtown High for all of 15 minutes, and Tony couldn't help the antsiness he felt, waiting to get all of the thoughts he had out in the open.
Once in Steve’s living room, Tony tried to take in all of what he had just learned. Coraline, “Cora” as Steve affectionately called her, was Steve and Peggy’s year and a half old daughter. They’d decided after their junior prom that they wanted to lose their virginities to someone special, but thanks to a lack of any real planning in terms of birth control, Peggy ended up getting pregnant. They’d both taken a year off between high school and college, which explained why Steve was nineteen at the start of his freshman year.
“Was I that bad of a boyfriend?”
Steve looked at him, worried.
“You weren’t answering any of Nat’s calls or texts. We weren’t sure if you were okay,” Bucky said, using his flesh and blood hand to scratch above the elbow of his metal arm.
Tony started focusing less on Steve’s words and more on his face. The way his eyes grew wider when he put emphasis on a word. The way a little dimple appeared in only his left cheek when he spoke. And fuck, when did his lips become so perfectly kissable? Tony was aware he was staring; he just couldn’t bring himself to stop or to care.
“I just don’t know that you are. I feel like I’ve had to practically twist your arm to get you to do anything SI related, and that was when you still worked here!”
“Well… yeah, why wouldn’t I?” Steve asked, taking his seat after securing Cora in her chair. “This is such a special day, ‘cause without it, we wouldn’t have you. We just wanted to show you how glad we are that you’re here and how much we love you.”
“I’m a pretty firm believer in the notion that sometimes we need to acknowledge and celebrate the selfless acts we do. You might not always want to draw attention to all that you’ve been through, but it’s okay to acknowledge that you’ve done something amazing. That you’re
perfect for you. I’ve literally never seen anyone love someone else as much as he loves you and Coraline. And the way you two look at him? Christ, Steve. He would have given you the world if you had let him. Hell, he’d probably still do it.”
Howard clenched his jaw at that, and instantly, a chill went down Tony’s spine. As a kid, he knew that the second Howard clenched his jaw, trouble was on it’s way. As an adult, he was fairly certain that gesture still meant the same thing.
.” Tony said, voice seething with mock anger.
“Who’s the doctor?” Tony asked, looking over some of the forms the omega was filling out.
He said, quickly moving both of his hands to the shower wall. Steve wasn’t necessarily opposed to getting himself off. He was in the army after all; at one point his right hand was his best friend. It was the fact that thoughts of Tony always seemed to creep into his mind right before he jerked off. As a last resort, Steve decided to go for a run. He took his sketchbook so that he could stop at different spots to draw what he saw. Drawing never failed to clear Steve’s head, and he needed that clarity more than anything if he had any hope of figuring out what to do about Tony.
“Hey, before you go,” Steve started, “ I just wanted to thank you for looking out for Tony.”
Tony responded with a smile of his own at Steve's words and the blond couldn't help the butterflies he felt in that moment.
Steve helped the alpha up into his chair, before bringing his seat a little closer.
The saving grace of all of this, though, was the fact that Steve knew he wasn’t going to have to go through this alone. Upon finding out what had happened, his friend, those he had known before his pregnancy as well as those he’d met through Tony, rallied around him, to remind him that even though it didn’t feel like it, he was loved. Initially, he had been wary of Pepper, Rhodey and Carol, suspicious that Tony had asked them to spy for him. But he quickly came to realize that they were there for him because they genuinely cared for him and Mason. Whether Tony was happy about that or not was beyond him, but frankly, Steve didn’t much care. He had bigger things to worry about now, than the alpha’s happiness.
“I don’t
Steve returned with two drinks in hand, giving one to Tony with a little nod. Tony examined the glass, noticing the carbonation bubbling up around the ice cubes and lime wedge. “Good?” Steve asked, quietly.
“Yeah…”
Tony fondly grinned. “Let’s just open the presents, Steve. She’s not going to stop until we do.”
him.”
“‘There’s no place more private here than a car in the parking lot the night of a school dance’. Honestly, that’s been the best advice I’ve gotten since starting my job here” Steve laughed and shook his head. “I didn’t think…” he began, but groaned in frustration before starting again.
Tony's mouth fell open as he moaned through his release. Steve mindlessly wiped his hand on the pants he wore as their breathing began to settle.
“I’d like that,” Steve answered, the smile evident in his voice. “G’night, Tony.”
“Thank you for sharing this with me, Pepper. I really appreciate it,” Steve said, walking her to the door.
Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head.
“God, Bruce, I can’t believe this,” Tony spoke, looking absolutely stunned by this epiphany.
“Just...how nice it would be for Tony, Bug and I to be a real family. I mean we both love  this baby with everything we have, but…” Steve trailed off.
“Listen, you’ve been cooking that little cutie for six and a half months, and you hadn’t given any thought to what you wanted the nursery to look like?” Pepper asked, during her daily stop at his office in the morning.
“Hey, Rhodey?”
“That's an understatement if ever there was one,” Steve said around a small laugh. “I did notice that you really seemed to like the sweater on me…” he said, nervously.
“Yeah, the first day we met, I may or may not have Googled you to find out a little more about you.Admittedly, I tried looking you up on Facebook and when I couldn’t find you, I turned to Google. Almost immediately I found articles talking about you, your father, and Stark Industries.”
Tony grabbed the red head by the arms to look at him now. She tried to avoid his eyes for some time before she finally sighed.
All Steve could do was give a simple nod.
A shudder passed through Tony’s body, as he slowly but surely got his brain to function enough to push Steve’s hand away. He was panting at this point and it took a moment before he could form words again.
************
“And what, pray tell, would be so terrible about being married to me?” Tony asked, crossing his arms.
“It’s great to finally meet you, and let me say, thank you for your service,” Steve spoke, shaking his hand.
Steve busied himself getting ready, and by the time he stepped out of his room, showered and fully dressed, he heard his friend knocking at the door. Steve took a deep breath to collect himself, before letting Bucky in.
It dawned on Steve as Tony tried to backtrack his way out of this conversation, that the brunet thought he was declining the invitation. As Tony continued to stammer on, Steve reached out to rest his hand on top of the one on the table in front of him.
His friends all looked at him, then at one another.
“You’re saying a lot of really great things about me right now, and though I would prefer to let this continue, I’m going to have to stop you and say that I accept the position.”
Day in and day out, Tony managed to wake up and make it through the work day. On his first day back, he got a lot of confused and curious looks, but just flashed his million watt smile and brushed it all off. He threw himself into his work, holding conference calls, going over proposals, and just generally trying to keep as busy as possible.
“And you don’t think I’ll measure up?”
, both men felt content in knowing that life would be a beautiful, hot mess of an adventure, as long as they were together.
“Yes, very much that. I just don’t really know where we stand and I mean...I’m more than happy continuing on the way things are if that’s what makes him comfortable, because really I’m just glad to have anything with him. But I also kind of just wish we could define things. It’s also just so weird experiencing all of this. I mean, I was the only kid my parents had so of course I wasn’t able to witness them go through this, but, I’m slowly starting to  understand the appeal of having a bond mate.”
"Oh please, Steve, give it a rest. I know I'm a pain in your ass. To tell you the truth, I was wondering when you were gunna give up on the whole "kill him with kindness" shtick cause you're a lot more fun when you're sassy. Anyway, the whole team is dressing up as the kids from Captain Planet and they all want you to be the Captain. So, what do ya say?"
The two of them sat there in silence. Steve had just laid out a lot of things on the table and Tony didn’t want to deal with any of it.
“Love yew, daddy,” Cora squeaked. She and Tony both waved as Steve disappeared around the corner. When he was gone, Tony carried her to the couch.
“Hel-eck yes,” Tony corrected himself. No swearing in front of the B-A-B-Y.
“Steve,” the blond said, offering his hand.
“Glad we’re on the same page then. If you’ll come with me, I’ll give you a tour of the school and introduce you to the teacher you’ll be working with.”
Steve sat in his car trying to tell himself to take a deep breath. It was his first day of work as a P.E. teaching assistant at Midtown High, and he was beyond nervous. Luckily, he had a few days of administrative work before the first day of school the following week. Enough time to get his bearings before having to throw a bunch of students into the mix. This was Steve’s first time working as a teacher, let alone spending any real amount of time with a bunch of teenagers.
“Oh, I’m going to an engagement party on Saturday night,” Steve said, taking a sip of his strawberry shake.
Peggy sighed, wiping at her eyes before she continued. “Haven’t you wondered why I’d been having her stay with you more and more? I mean, I honestly did need the help more often than not, but Steve she was miserable without you and Tony. She’d come home and talk for hours about how much fun she’d had with the two of you, and how much she loved Tony. There would be days when she’d go absolutely insane when she found out that she wouldn’t be seeing you guys.”
It was hours on the couch before Steve finally fell asleep, but when he did, it was fitful and uncomfortable. He woke up with a crick in his neck and an ache in his shoulder. He dragged himself off the couch, grabbing his phone in the process, to send a text.
“We...we really shouldn’t do this here,” Steve said quietly, gesturing for Tony to lower his voice.
“Um, not that I don’t trust your judgment…Pepper, but don’t you think that this is a task better suited for Rhodes? Someone who’s known Tony longer and someone who he trusts?”
to see Natasha sitting there with a large mug in front of her.
“Yeah I...I dunno, I guess I’m just feeling a little nervous,” Steve spoke, getting back to the work at hand.
Heuheuheu.
Sam and Bucky exchanged a look as Steve stood to go to the living room. They followed behind and, as requested, dropped the subject of Tony entirely. As they geared up for a day of hangover recovery and ‘80s action movies, Steve promised himself that this was it. He’d allow himself to feel sad for the rest of the day, but after that he would be done with Tony Stark for good. It would be easier said than done, but it was a promise he intended to keep.
“I… I understand,” Steve answered, wringing his hands in his lap.
The blond sighed and gave his friends a weak smile.
in our group would be helping?”
It took Tony a moment before he was able to find the arc reactor. Once he did, he tapped his finger on it.
“Steve?” Tony asked, clearly startled by the small gesture.
“That look is for the idiot that’s sitting in front of me. I can’t believe you still haven’t asked the guy out. He clearly likes you, just do it!”
"But Steve--"
“More,” he begged.
“Hey, what’s up?” Tony asked, trying to seem a lot more calm than he was.
“I never drink on an empty stomach,” Sam answered before sitting at the edge of the bed, “plus I only stuck to beer while you and Buck tried to empty your apartment of every single drop of alcohol available.”
“You did?”
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked somewhat frantically.
“Ok, Tony, start from the beginning and tell me everything.”
to foot the bill?!”
“Tony, great to see you,” Thor said in a booming voice, pulling Tony into a hug.
Steve had to take in a few deep breaths before he just nodded and took the soda gun from Clint to fill Tony’s drinks. As he made his way back to the table, he silently kicked himself for never considering that this could happen. The restaurant was right off campus, so of course Tony would eventually stop by. What truly scared him was the fact that Tony had ordered two drinks. The rational side of Steve knew that he was probably there with any one of the many friends Tony had. But the irrational side of him, and apparently the louder side, was terrified that he was on a date with someone else.
Steve just shook his head and smiled.
“Have you been talking to Pepper? Because that’s a very Pepper thing to say,” Tony said, raising his head to question Steve. “If so, ignore everything she said about me… unless she said good things. In which case, believe everything she said.”
“Tony...are you serious?” Carol asked, wearily, “You have three full size bottles of Grey Goose per guest, not to mention you practically bought out all of New York’s alcohol supply.”
we’re talking about. You can keep buying all the gifts you want but none of that will mean anything, especially not to Cora, once you’re gone.”
“Wait what? Where are we going?” Steve asked practically running to catch up. Once he got to the car, Tony stood with the a piece of fabric in hand while holding the door open.
“You’ve known the whole time, and that didn’t impact the way you treated me or what you thought of me?”
“Why?”
“Oh uh...it’s...definitely going,” Happy answered nervously.
Tony came from an extremely wealthy family, one that currently owned a huge government contracting corporation. The alpha didn’t like to talk about his background, mainly because of his volatile relationship with his father, but also because he didn’t want to become a target. He knew there were people in the world who would see him as nothing more than a bank roll if they knew where he came from. For that reason, Tony only let a select few know about his family.
Tony gave one quick nod before looking up at the woman in front of him.
His finger hovered over
Once they had a moment to themselves, Tony pulled Steve aside. “I don’t know how the fuck you did any of that, but thank you!”
“I am not just some random off the street giving you my meaningless opinion. I am your best friend, telling you that this is a reality, this is
“We gonna get
“Babe, I think we’re literally the first ones here, what’s the rush?” Steve asked, looking at his boyfriend fondly.
“Where’d you even find this guy?” Natasha asked, looking at Steve.
"Maybe. Also Clint is an idiot."
“Like a
“There are a lot of guys here, you’re going to need to be a tad bit more specific,” Clint said around a laugh.
As Bucky left for his room, Steve and Natasha cuddled up on the makeshift bed that they’d put together earlier. While his eyes were closed and he began drifting off, Steve couldn’t help but wonder what the next day would have in store for him and his new confusing but amazing family.
“I’d like to wake him up if we could,” Steve said, still looking at the bot with something like pride, “just to make sure everything still works as it should.”
“Checkout is at noon. Enjoy your stay.”
, your hole feels amazing, sweetheart,” Tony ground out through his teeth, trying to keep himself calm.
“Did you do all of this yourself?” Tony asked, looking around at the candles and the nice dishes set out.
Once he was alone in his office, Steve took a deep breath. He spun around in his chair to face the window behind him as he placed his hands on his small belly.
As Tony continued poking around with some of the circuit boards connected to his little bot, he heard a knock on the door. “Come in,” he said without looking up. After a moment of silence, he looked up to see Steve standing there, looking at him with a small smile on his face. “Uh...hi,” Tony spoke, feeling his cheeks heat a bit under the blond’s gaze.
Steve’s hands seemed to move lightning fast, as he poured lube into his palm, but the second he took his and Tony’s cock in one hand, everything slowed to a screeching halt. Between the smooth velvety feel of Tony’s cock both in his hand and pressed firmly against his own, Steve had to will himself not to come right then and there.
“It means I don’t know what a relationship with you would look like, but I’m willing to figure it out if you are,” Steve spoke, clearly terrified that the brunet might suddenly reject him.
“What would you suggest I do then, oh wise one?”
“Such as?” Tony prompted as he began dishing out the food.
Steve walked back to his room, confident that with Natasha’s advice, he could change Tony’s mind.
Before Tony knew it, Happy had pulled up to the cabin.
He didn’t need to look down at his phone when it vibrated to let him know that it was Tony asking to be buzzed in. He hit the button and unlocked the door, positioning himself on the couch in a faux casual manner. God, he probably looked as fake as he felt.
Upon exiting the elevator, it dawned on Steve, that not only was he about to see his crush’s apartment, but was he about to see where
“Steve, that’s--”
Before Tony had a chance to respond, Rhodey walked in. He quickly dodged the sock that Tony hurled in his direction.
“Honey, I’m home,” Tony sang, making his way through the living room. Steve poked his head out of the kitchen and gave a huge smile. “Hi sweetheart, go put your bags down and come join me for dinner in 10.”
“Are you sure?” Bucky asked one more time.
“Would you mind keeping this just between the two of us?”
“Am I here for you to break up with me?”
"If by something else, you mean a literal gift from God, then yes, I am something else."
Clint opened one eye to peek at him before speaking. “The beauty of having a TA is that
“I’m just surprised it took you this long to see it. I would have let you go; all you had to do was ask. You could have told me that I wasn’t what you wanted anymore. You deserve to be happy, even if it’s with someone else. But three months Pepper? You went behind my back for three months…”
“So...you’re not trying to date...
“I mean...you don’t,” Nat answered, giving a small smile. “Guess we’ll just have to wait and see.”
“You’ve got a deal.”
Steve looked puzzled momentarily, before realization hit. “Oh, this! I found it in the closet when I first got here. It was nice of you to get me something for this trip,” he said around a bashful smile before digging in to the meal in front of him. Tony tried his best to eat his dinner and listen to his boyfriend’s conversation, but all he could do was stare at Steve in that sweater...in
Tony sat there quiet, praying that Rhodey couldn’t see the red creeping into his cheeks. The arc reactor was something he didn't like to talk about or even draw attention to, and yet people always ended up asking about it. Thankfully his students knew better than to ask about it yet somehow adults were hit or miss between those who could leave well enough alone and those who just wanted to be nosey as fuck. No matter which category they fell into, people at least always noticed the reactor. Tony had nearly perfected his ability to catch people taking a glance at his chest, trying to sneak a peek. He hated it more than he’d ever let on.
? Steve didn’t want to continue the conversation, knowing he wouldn’t be able the deal with the hurt of possibly being let down in the future.
The next morning, Tony was a bit nervous walking into work. Though it was a teacher work day, and he knew Steve wouldn't be there, he dreaded having to see their friends. There was no way their friends hadn't heard about the massive blow up that he and Steve had and now knowing that he was wrong made everything ten times worse.
“Don’t forget to take protection, Stevie,” Bucky teased, trying to keep a straight face. “STDs are real and despite what you might think, you
“Like I said earlier, I’ve been under the weather, so I feel like soup would help. But I also always have to get spring rolls whenever they’re on the menu. They’re my absolute favorite.”
Steve smiled down at him sweetly before giving a single nod.
That wasn’t going to work. The more he thought about it, nothing was going to work, so Steve resolved that once this was all over, he’d explain what happened, he and Tony would have a good laugh, and things would be back to normal. Except for the fact that once he started thinking about the alpha he couldn’t stop.
"Stark...Tony, I...I am so sorry," Steve offered, face turning red. Tony just waved him off and gave a smirk.
Tony kept his eyes on Steve’s belly, only looking into the omega’s eyes when he laced their fingers together.
“You’re a stubborn bastard and an asshole a good portion of the time, but you are a good person, Tony. You’re kind hearted and you look out for others. You put your heart and soul into the things you care about.”
“All I’m saying is that I don’t want you to get hurt. From one alpha to another, I know how hard it can be not being bonded--”
As if on cue, Steve felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He pulled it out to see the text from Tony.
Tony couldn’t help but smile wide at that. All he’d wanted was to give Steve and Coraline the absolute best. He may not have been able to spoil them as much as he would have liked, but at least he was able to put a roof over their heads.
“I say you’ve got yourself a deal.”
“That didn’t mean that I didn’t like you. Oh god, you have
“I’m sorry, nugget, but you can’t help with this one,” Cora’s face transformed immediately and her lip started to tremble as her eyes welled up with tears. Steve scrambled to find a way to fix what he’d done. “Uh… how about this, we’ll make Tony’s birthday cake, and you I’ll let you decorate it.”
“Good, cause we couldn't bear it if our little Stevie got hurt now could we?” Bucky asked, ruffling Steve’s hair.
“Deal!” Natasha agreed, all too excited.
“Glad you were able to make it, I’ve had a lot of fun too,” Tony said, honestly. “And who knows, maybe I’ll whisk you away again some time.’
“Anything for you, sweets. Now come on,” Tony laughed, pulling Steve along to the skate rental area. Once they paid for their skates and got them all laced up, they stood at the entrance to the rink.
“Tony…” the blond let out around a gasp, “I need you…
“Pansexual.”
“Well, I guess we should put her down for a nap then,” Tony spoke around a laugh at how adorably tired Mason seemed.
“Two,” Tony continued.
The blond moved to shut the door in Tony’s face, but the alpha stopped it with his foot.
“Mmm-hmm,” Tony answered, once again swallowing Steve down. The vibration from his throat is what finally pushed Steve over the edge. When he was done riding the aftershocks of his orgasm, he shakily cupped Tony’s face with his hands and guided him so they were face to face.
“Oh haha Tony, you don’t have much room to judge. Your ‘music’ sounds like a cat being mauled by a lawn mower.”
“Threefourfivesixseven,” Steve counted, running up the stairs, stumbling only once in his temporary blindness.
“Well… It’s about Tony.”
Tony stood in front of him, smiling nervously. “Hey there sweets,” he said, before leaning up for a quick kiss. Steve wanted desperately to turn it into something deeper but he thought better than to do so when he heard shuffling from behind him.
,” Tony said, moving away to sit on the couch. Steve just smiled, shaking his head and went back to the kitchen table to finish his work.
“Hey! I am not!” Clint whined, looking around the table at Bruce and Natasha for their agreement.
“Ah, I made one of my favorites. I figured comfort food is never a bad way to go so I made a maple bourbon pot roast.”
Bucky just shrugged and stood up, leaning to give Natasha a kiss, and the omega a fist bump.
Steve turned towards Tony with a sweet yet nervous smile. “I know you've not always had good memories of Christmas with your family,” Steve began, rubbing a thumb over Tony’s cheek, “so I wanted to start anew, to hopefully turn Christmas into a day that you look forward to.”
“They asked that I not tell you they were waiting for you,” was all Happy said before they continued the rest of their ride in silence.
“I, uhm…” Steve began, just as Bruce walked into the room.
Steve moved to pick Cora up from the floor, and nuzzled her forehead as she wrapped her arms around his neck. “You ready for bed, nugget?” he asked, brushing some hair out of her face.
Rhodey looked at him, clearly surprised by that answer. His face softened a bit the moment he realized that Steve wasn't putting on a front, and he let out a relieved breath. “That’s good to hear,” he began. “But all of that...
“God dammit!”
Tony waved him off. “It’s okay, honestly, Steve. I get it. Thanks for hearing me out, and I guess I’ll see you around.”
The small smile Steve had on his face fell immediately at the invitation.
“Oh, so that’s why you’ve been spending so much time with me.”
“Too?” Tony asked, throat going dry.
He turned toward the door, only stopping to sigh once again before turning to look at Tony and Steve. “I really do wish you had been less of a disappointment.” Then he was gone.
to someone.”
“She’s down for a nap right now, but she should be waking up within the next hour or so. There’s a brand new bottle of her juice in the pantry if she wants any, but please try to make sure she drinks some milk today. I’ve left plenty of Graduates snacks and meals for you to choose from. She’s going to tell you she wants to eat the hot cereal for dinner; seriously she’s going to
“Not a problem, but please let go before you crush me to death…” Sam choked out. Steve jumped back quickly, shrugging in apology.
“I get it. Thanks for your concern. But…” Tony sighed. He was really about to do this. “But I want to be a part of your life and your life comes with Cora.”
Ty took a long sip of his water, drawing out this interaction far longer than necessary.
As Steve stood there, patiently waiting for a response, Tony couldn’t help but notice how good the omega looked wearing what seemed to be his favorite dark blue cardigan.
“My dad is rich.”
It was going to be perfect...or rather, it should have been perfect. The day before they were set to leave, a major issue with a mechanical component produced by SI occurred. Steve was happy to wait for everything to be resolved, but Tony insisted the blond drive up ahead of him, expecting that he’d meet him the following day. What he hadn't expected was to be neck deep in the repair work necessary to get SI back on track with their production schedule. So here he was, three days into their week long getaway, finally making it up to the cabin.
“Well, when you put it like that,” Tony responded, meekly.
“Tony, I’m a pretty light sleeper. There’s no way I’d sleep through you talking, right by my ear mind you, let alone you rubbing my belly.”
Tony and Stark Labs arrived in D.C. three years ago, and Steve had been pinning over the inventor ever since. It felt like such a school boy crush, just fawning over the gorgeous genius who clearly had no clue that Steve even existed, a thought which sparked a question in Steve’s mind that left his lips before he could think better of himself.
“Oh, well Mr. Stark isn’t here today and I usually spend my free period doing stuff around his class. Could I stay here with you just for today?”
“Hey,” Tony said, chastising himself internally for such a lame greeting.
“Sir, Tiberius Stone has arrived,” JARVIS said.
“Goodnight kiddo,” he whispered.
Somehow, it had never occured to Tony that how quickly they won their matches would have a significant impact on anything, let alone on the bots themselves. His mind was suddenly swimming with new ideas and possibilities. “If I pull up the clips, could you point out the instances where we could have scored and how we could have done a better job?”
Pepper searched Tony’s face for any signs of emotion. Her heart sank, the second that she saw a look of understanding and anger.
In the beginning, it felt as though he was mourning the alpha’s death. Once he had slammed the door behind Tony, he felt his entire world shatter. He had reached out to Natasha for comfort, mainly because he knew he couldn’t handle being alone, and once she arrived, he cried for what felt like days. Steve actually ended up taking off some time from work to wrap his mind around what had happened, and to begin to build himself back up, because as much as this hurt, and God did it
Steve sat in bed, staring up at his ceiling in the darkness of his room. He’d woken up twenty minutes before his alarm was set to go off, leaving him nowhere near enough time to go back to sleep, but enough time to just lay there and think. Today was the first day of what was to be considered his new normal. He’d wake up, go to work, then at the end of his regular work day he’d be starting his new job, bartending.
“Yeah, I don’t know what it is, I feel like maybe I got food poisoning, but I’m really not sure.”
When Tony looked up, he saw the massive grin on her face. “What?” he asked, slightly terrified.
Without preamble, Tony withdrew his tongue and plunged two slick fingers in its place. Steve sucked in a gasp at the intrusion, feeling deft fingers stroking his inner walls.
about alcohol makes me want to,” he said, pitifully taking a bite of his toast. “Thanks for the food, by the way.”
That was, until she picked out the most hideous neon colored boots known to man. Steve couldn’t even believe that someone had thought they were a good idea to put on the market. Well, he supposed it worked, considering his daughter was standing at his feet, the boot in her hands, whining.
“Not really. You see… The other night when we were supposed to do our team bonding…”
Steve nestled himself under the covers, letting the warmth of the blankets wash over him as the exhaustion from the day started to set in. “Good night Tony. Thanks for everything,” Steve muttered. As his eyes began to feel heavier and heavier, the last thing Steve remembered was hearing the click of the light switch.
“No, Natasha, he didn’t take advantage of me.”
Bucky barked out a laugh at that.
Tony shook out of it then, and stood aside to let the man in.
“Peter, you’re a wonderful kid, and great save by the way,” Steve laughed. “All you have to do is be yourself, and I'm sure Mr. Rhodes will think you’re just as awesome as Mr. Stark does.”
“One,” Steve said, getting his hand on his string.
“I love you,” Tony whispered. Steve kissed the top of his head, pulling him in tighter.
Steve looked shocked for a moment but closed his eyes and took a deep breath to center himself. “Can I be completely honest?” He asked
“Hi,” he spoke, pulling out the chair across from her.
getting to know the gang!”
“What do you know about love? You’re a child.”
“I’ve made a mess of all of this, I know that. But please trust me when I say I’m going to spend however long it takes making up for it,” Steve said, more to himself than Pepper. “We’re completely starting over this time, and I want to show Tony that I love him despite who his father is, and how they’ve treated him.”
“Ever heard of Stark Industries?”
“Steve?” Steve looked up and saw one hell of an intimidating man looking down at him.
“So...what you’re saying is I should have gone with four bottles of vodka per guest, and dipped into New Jersey’s supply of alcohol as well?”
Steve couldn't even bring himself to say bye to enable before he left. He took a deep breath once he knew he was alone.
Coraline stood with her feet planted firmly on the ground and her hands on her hips. “Who dere?” she asked sternly.
Steve removed his pants, then looked to Tony, expectantly. When Tony looked at him, confused, the omega gave a fond sigh. “You always say this shirt makes me look like a present, all wrapped up, so I wanted to give you a chance to unwrap me.”
“Do you like it?” Tony asked, now sounding unsure of himself. Steve just pulled him in for a gentle kiss before answering; “I absolutely love it.”
“Excuse you, what was that laugh?!” Tony asked, trying to sound offended.
“The one that’s coming into the restaurant right now?”
After being discharged from the Army, Steve didn’t know if he’d be able to truly find happiness in his work ever again. Being in the Army was truly all he’d wanted for so long, and to lose that over something so stupid as breaking his femur while longboarding during his off time, had absolutely crushed him. But standing here, daydreaming about what new possibilities lay ahead of him, was genuinely the first time Steve truly felt like maybe he was meant for this. Maybe there was something else out there for him other than being in the Army.
“Great! Just take a seat right here, and someone will be out to speak with you shortly.”
it, Steve. It’s like a hotel only we’re going to make it so homey and Cora has her own room and there’s this jacuzzi bathtub that’s big enough for the three of us to fit in and we can teach Coraline how to swim and--what?”
“Wait, what gave you the impression that I didn’t want whatever it is you were thinking you wanted?” Tony asked.
“Oh man, okay, I think I’m good now.”
“Hi, I’m here for an interview at two,” Steve said to the hostess at the front. She nodded, giving him a warm smile.
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Tony admitted.
Steve took Tony’s hands in his own. “Now, I swear to you that I am not pressuring you but if I’m sitting here drinking this bottle of wine with you and I don’t let you have too much, would you?” Tony stared at the bottle, clearly torn. God he wanted to.
Steve pulled his scarf up, covering his bearded cheeks and mouth from what he could hear was a strong and likely bitter wind. He followed Tony in silence as they made their way outside to slowly but surely navigate through the worsening blizzard across the street. It took a bit longer than Tony initially predicted, but the second they entered the warm lobby of his building, both men let out a sigh of relief.
“Love you too, Tony.”
Steve, humiliated, reached down to pick up his daughter to leave the shoe store. Once she was off the ground, she was a loose canon. She was throwing her limbs about, punching and kicking at Steve, still screaming.
“Hey babe,” Tony said, shaking out his hair and shedding his jacket. “It’s raining like a mother fucker out there.”
“I can smell the carbonara, which means you messed up and you need our help,” the blonde said, stepping into the house.
a chaperone. Why would we ask you to ask around, when we can do that ourselves?” Clint asked and Nat smacked him on the arm. “Ow!” Clint yelped, rubbing his arm. “I was just asking a question.”
“Well,” Tony started, nervously, “I said I’ll support you and I mean it. If you want to keep this baby, then we’ll just have to try our hardest to be the best parents this kid could ever hope for.”
“So,” Bucky said, throwing his chopsticks down on the table and rubbing his hands together. “Who’s up for some Cards Against Humanity?”
“With my face down here?” Tony continued to rub up and down Steve’s cock.
“Everything is okay with Tony,” Pepper assured, answering the question Steve hadn’t asked. “He actually doesn’t know I’m here. I got your address from Natasha the other day, and just wanted to talk to you.”
Howard just looked at her, disdain seeping through his expression.
Tony couldn’t help but smile at that. He was still nervous as all hell, but it didn’t hurt to hear that Steve had been thinking the same thing.
“Yeah, and?” Steve asked, trying to play it cool.
“Wait!” Steve exclaimed rushing to his coat and pulling his phone out.
“Not at all, what’s the question?”
“I don’t know what song this is, but play this one and go from there,” he said looking back towards the road.
“So, even though I’m terrified right now, I understand what you’re saying and why you’re saying it. I’m genuinely glad that Tony has someone like you in his life to protect him.”
“Well, if you say he’s a good guy, then we’re happy for you. We’ll have to meet him, of course to make sure he’s not just fucking around and all.”
Pepper studied Steve’s expression, before offering a sincere smile.
The pair of them walked out to wait with the rest of the group in the living room. Steve could feel the uneasiness between Natasha and Bucky almost immediately as he noticed the piece of paper Bucky was scribbling on.
She’d become an uncharacteristically picky eater.
In that moment it truly felt like they were the only two in the room, but Clint quickly brought him back to reality.
. In such a short explanation, Tony seemed to let Steve in on something that he didn’t much like to share with others: the fact that he wanted to be where he was
“Both, I think. She never acted like this before, so I’ve either got to believe it has to do with all of these life changes or that the terrible twos are a real thing and they’re hitting her, hard. But I just…” Steve trailed off, thinking back on his exchange with Cora earlier, feeling tears well up in his eyes.
“Steve, are you sure? We don't have to right now if you aren't ready,” Tony offered, trying not to sound condescending.
Steve smiled wide at Pepper as she waved goodbye before closing the door behind her. He wanted to think that Pepper believed his words, that she understood that he meant what he said about making up for his actions. But he knew it would take some time for her, for anyone, to truly believe that he was in this for the long haul. As he received the text from Tony saying that he was downstairs to pick him up, Steve promised himself that no matter what, he would do whatever it took to make sure that above all else, Tony knew just how loved he truly was.
She gave Steve a look of disapproval, but upon seeing that he wasn’t going to budge on this, she rolled her eyes and shook her head.
“Are you sure you want to watch this?” Steve asked for what felt like the hundredth time.
"Glad you could make it," he offered softly, moving aside so Tony could come in.
“What’s wrong?” He asked, timidly.
“Alright, well I’m going to head out, but if I don’t see you guys beforehand, I hope you both have a great holiday.” She gave both of them a hug before seeing herself out.
Steve just pointed a shaky finger towards the door to their left before pressing himself up against the brunet’s side. He began to move his hips, looking for any type of friction he could get. Tony took both of his hands and slammed Steve up against the wall, soliciting the most beautiful whimper he’d ever heard. He took in the omega’s face, his red swollen lips, the blush that tinted his cheeks. Tony was losing his mind at the sight but it wasn’t until Steve muttered a desperate ‘please’, that he felt something inside of him snap.
“We, uh… we broke up.”
“ID?”
As Steve drove, he thought about what exactly he’d want to say. Memories of the past few weeks flooded through his mind, yet somehow the most prominent ones all involved Tony.
“Babe, you asked if we could wipe the slate clean. When I said yes, I meant we were wiping it clean of
“You seem like a kid on their way to Disney right now,” Clint observed.
“Look, you’re clearly not going to be able to live like this forever. At some point, you’re going to have to realize that you have legitimate feelings for this guy and do something about it. Because as much as I love coming over here for free food, I can’t keep watching you run around like a lovesick puppy trying to figure out what to do. Just ask him on a date and quit bothering me about it.”
The rest of the evening consisted of conversations about the meet up and plans for the robotics team over sushi. Steve talked about strategy for the team’s first robotics meet, animatedly waving sushi with his chopsticks.
“Go ahead and answer it,  honey, we’ve got all day, so I don’t mind.”
“You were doing so well. Why did you stop?” Cora squirmed in her seat. “You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want.”
“I said leggy
“Secondly, you have a great point. Just know that I’m only giving in to your terroristic demands for the sake of saving the beautiful face that the good Lord blessed me with.” Rhodey rolled his eyes, no doubt regretting ever becoming friends with the brunet in the first place. “If you
“That’s not what I’ve been doing there. There’s a bartender that I’ve been going there to see…”
“No Tony…”
Bucky gave a small nod, before standing to leave. Tony immediately closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, in an effort focus his mind on the task he was on before he was interrupted. He then heard his phone buzz, with a message, as if the world was trying to tell him that he needed to take a break. Tony smiled the moment he saw that the message was from Steve.
Steve leans in and noses at his neck, “yeah gorgeous, you are,” he murmurs and Tony shivers. It’s a little odd to hear Bucky’s nicknames for him out of Steve’s mouth but he’s not complaining either. Its kind of hot in its own way. Steve pulls back a little and smiles down at him, “you ready, baby?” he asks. Tony nods, watching as Steve sits back on his heels and looks him over for a moment.
Of all things he doesn’t expect
That’s kind of complicated but Tony decides to do his best. “I like seeing you like this,” he says and Steve’s eyebrows draw in a little. “Shh. I like getting you worked up, teasing you. Like it when you lose control a little, take what you want,” he tells Steve, leaning into his space and kissing him. “Like it when you use me for your pleasure. Thought this might get you there faster,” he murmurs against Steve’s lips.
For a moment they remain like that, catching their breath before Steve speaks. “You’re gunna keep the uniform, right?” he asks and Tony rolls his eyes.
“Bossy,” Bucky tells him but he complies, somehow making that action look attractive.
“You too,” Tony tells Steve, half turning to face him.
“Good,” Bucky tells him, fingers tightening a little around his neck before he lets go and presses a kiss to Tony’s shoulder. Tony reaches up and tangles his fingers in Bucky’s hair, pulling at it. Bucky moans into Tony’s shoulder, “
,” Tony says, voice sounding a little desperate even to his own ears. He hears the way Steve’s breath catches for a moment and the way it picks back up again when he leans back into Tony’s neck, leaving sloppy kisses down it before pulling away. Tony makes an irritated noise and Steve huffs out a laugh.
that’s good. “Yeah, Tony?” Steve asks in his ear, nipping at the underside of Tony’s jaw.
“Room. Now,” Steve tells him, giving his ass another swat. Tony shakes his head, looking at Steve as he shakes his ass a little. It results in another swat, “get going,” Steve tells him.
Tony rolls his eyes, “you can admire the view when you’re fucking me,” he tells him.
Steve doesn’t look impressed. “Why, exactly?” he asks.
“No, I’m pretty serious, I’m tired of his bullshit. I’ll be back,” Steve says, grouchy in a way Tony has learned it entirely owed to Steve not wanting to leave his side. He leaves pissy not that that’s entirely unusual when he’s pulled away from Tony.
“Look, if I wanted to fuck on a rock I would. But I don’t, so I got you a new bed. Deal with it,” Tony tells him, reaching out for Steve to come closer.
“Skin?”
you are good like this. Wetter than normal and I didn’t even
“Come on baby,” Tony tells him. “So close. Cum for me, wanna feel it,” he murmurs and pulls Bucky’s hair again,
Steve pulls away and Tony makes an annoyed noise at the loss. Steve shakes his head at him and runs his hand up the inside of Tony’s thigh before reaching over and running his fingers through Bucky’s hair. Bucky tries to pull away but it’s too late. “Asshole,” Bucky tells Steve. “Do you know how hard it is to get slick out of your hair?”
Tony wrinkles his nose. “You say that like that’s an actual improvement,” he says.
“Is this your excuse to stare at me ass?” Tony asks and Steve snorts.
“A garter belt?” he asks, pulling back a little to look at it.
,” Bucky tells him, teeth grazing the side of his neck. “And you’re always giving me all these looks, almost feels purposeful. Like you’re teasing me,” he murmurs.
Sam shoves Rhodey aside and sticks his face in the screen. “Double digits?” he asks and Rhodey shoves him back out.
has gotten into you?” he asks, baffled.
too soon.
someone maybe warn a guy,” he says.
Tony lets out a long groan. “
? Have you even been in Brooklyn before?” he asks, confused.
While he focuses on that Tony tosses and turns on his bed, trying to get confortable or something and his smell is getting stronger not that Steve says anything about it. Poor bastard looks right pissed and Steve can’t say he blames him. He’d be pissed off too, if he didn’t have the
“You want me?” Steve asks and Tony nods almost frantically.
This is probably the most selfish Steve has ever been in bed not that Tony minds much. This was for him, after all. “I take it you like my new look,” he asks as he walks over. He takes his time walking over to the bed.
Steve, because he’s a fucking idiot who sometimes only hears what he wants to, looks surprised like Tony hasn’t said that like five times in the last three days. At least once he stopped sounding like a dying weasel every time he talked anyway. Though, to be fair, Rumlow did pay for that with his life and Bucky didn’t make it pleasant either.
, not their sex life. Well, he loves that too but that’s not why he’s with Bucky.
“Baby, we forgot Bucky!” he says, sounding panicked.
Behind him Bucky swears softly, free hand ghosting over Tony’s hip momentarily before it disappears. He feels Bucky tease him, gently prodding at his hole and Tony moans. “Come
anyone else. Please, for the sake of my sanity, grow one more brain cell and stop being a dumbass. Its only fun when you’re the dumbest white friend,” Rhodey tells him.
“Mhm,” Steve murmurs, “what is it that you want, exactly?” he asks as he curls his fingers and Tony’s brain short circuits for a moment.
It takes a long while for Steve to move, walking over slowly, taking Tony in as he goes. He stays in position, letting Steve get a good look at his fantasies come to life. As soon as he can reach Tony he trails his fingers down his leg, hand curling around the inside of his thigh as his thumb brushes against the top of the stockings. He doesn’t take his eyes off Tony’s face as he does it and for whatever reason that’s attractive to him. “You looked through my notebook,” Steve states, not asks.
, you’ve got no idea,” Steve tells him. “Never felt anything like it,” he murmurs.
“Well, I mean Steve happens to be a Howling Commando but other than that I’ve mostly told you everything,” he says.

“Me too-
but also.
“First of all that’s not true, second of all that is not advice Rhodey.” He’s fine with words and he’s better at showing interest, its not like he’s subtle.
They’re tangled together in the sheets, Tony tucked into Steve’s chest. “Didn’t know you had a thing for being used,” Steve murmurs, fingers trailing up and down his spine.
black girl I have ever seen in my life and Rhodey was pissed because you can’t pick someone up after they’ve seen your dick like that. He almost abandoned me when I got her number but in my defense she happened to be interested in robotics and knew a lot about it, its not my fault we had overlapping interests.” Plus it turned out she was a lesbian and dating Hope van Dyne at the time so its not even like either of them had a chance. Rhodey totally had no right to be mad about it.
off glare because Tony is reaching out to him and he’s not going to say
Basically he’s a slut, Tony knows because he’s heard the stories. And he hadn’t exactly been brought around as a significant other so much as an extended tryst so his idiot ass planned for fooling around, Tony realizes. He rolls his eyes, “well maybe you should have considered that
, which would worry him if Tony didn’t stumble out the front door looking a little worse for wear but obviously fine. He spots them fast and rolls his eyes as he shuffles his way over. “God, took you fucking long enough,” he mumbles as he pitches forward into Steve’s arms. He turns, and for the first time in months, exchanges a look with Bucky and they both know exactly what he’s asking.
“Intestines?”
! Don’t you look at me like that; you were the one who decided to give me the option you can suffer with the consequences of your actions. Stop that, get that damn look off your face I can care about multiple people at once, I do it all the time. Just because Rhodey is my soul mate doesn’t mean I don’t love you too, my love isn’t a finite resource, it’s a chemical reaction in the brain that can be repeated with many different people over a lifetime. So stop looking all
His comment gets Rhodey back on track though because he frowns. “Hey yeah, how’d you get there and who the hell is Steve?”
Tony that feels fucking,
Damn Bucky and Steve exchange another glance and Tony knows those looks, he sees them frequently and no way. There’s no way they’re going to kiss each other, they’ve stated a billion and one times they’d never do that because they’re jerks who want to ruin Tony’s life. There’s no
Steve laughs and kisses him again, “well, good to know you have your wits about you,” he murmurs against Tony’s lips and that’s good, he’ll admit. But his heats have never affected his brain enough to make his reasoning foggy. Does to plenty of other omegas, usually if they have other health problems, but for him it just makes him impatient with any kind of waiting around. Hence crawling into Steve’s lap the way he’s wanted to for months but hadn’t really had the guts to.
“Mm, no you’re not,” Steve agrees as he kisses down Tony’s neck. “You dressed up because you like the attention I give you but you don’t let me touch you just to tease me. You like pushing me to the edge, making me beg for it,” Steve murmurs.
He’s polite and gives Bucky his second before he shifts, lifting himself a little to see what’s going on. He doesn’t anticipate Bucky reaching out and gripping the back of his neck again, forcing him back down again and he moans loudly, a surprising flush of pleasure rolling over his body. “Oh you like that, hmm?” Bucky asks as Tony pants, fingers tangled in the sheets again.
baby,” Steve tells him, bracing himself back over Tony. “You feel so good,” he murmurs into Tony’s neck.
of there what the hell are you doing?” he asks.
“By a fucking
“This better be good,” he mumbles as he falls into Steve’s chest, wrapping his arms around him and mostly attempting to sleep standing up. “Bucky has called me thirty eight times. Jesus Christ, something probably happened,” Steve mumbles. Tony is sure Bucky’s just annoyed at being left at the airport so he says nothing as Steve calls him. “Oh Jesus, Bucky calm the hell down,” he says when Bucky answers the phone yelling. Tony can’t hear what he’s saying but also he’s not listening. “Breathe damnit, and explain why you’re screaming,” Steve tells him.
He lets out a soft whine at the loss of Bucky’s hand at his neck but he can’t complain when it finds its way to Tony’s other hip and Bucky starts fucking into him in earnest. He moans, fingers tangled in the sheets hard as Bucky guides his hips, moving Tony the way he wants. “Bucky,” Tony says, unsure of what he even wants but feeling the need to voice it anyway.
“Good. That was probably the best orgasm of my life,” Tony tells him. “Happy to hear it was a joy to witness.” Bucky snorts, shaking his head at Tony but he says nothing.
“Do. You.
Poor Steve looks half gone and defeated, “okay, okay,” he mumbles and Tony grins.
Sam sticks his face back into the frame. “Got any secrets he tried to pay you to keep quiet? Because I guarantee I have more money than him,” Sam says.
Tony throws his head back and starts laughing. “Oh my
it but he also recognizes he doesn’t need to not to be a dick. And one time he admitted that he’d adopt Tony’s fashion if he though he could pull it off but he was pretty wasted and Tony’s pretty sure he forgot he said that. Rhodey could never pull off Tony’s look though so its probably best that he doesn’t try.
He leans down and kisses Steve slowly, not letting Steve take the desperate control he wants to just to tease him more. Steve makes a soft noise into the kiss, trying his best to hurry things along without hands but Tony pulls away a little every time he tries. “
“You don’t look worried,” the tall guy with the dark hair says. Ward or Rumlow, he isn’t sure which Bland Villain White Guy is which and he doesn’t really give a fuck.
"Must have slipped my mind" he murmured. He was sure Steve had never told him about an exhibition coming soon.
. He told himself.
gets so lucky to end up with someone like
"I called you at work half an hour ago. Natasha said you weren't there." Tony interrupted.
"I'm gonna go grab us some ice-cream" he said, determined. Tony looked up to him in confusion.
"I'm sorr-" he started.
"I know, I'm so so sorry, but I had a mishap at work and--"
"Yeah."
"Steve-" Tony attempted to come closer to comfort him, but Steve stopped him.
"When I was a kid my mom used to take me on the roof every 10th of August. She would tell me that it was Saint Lawrence's night and so we had to look for falling stars and make a wish everytime we found one" he smiled, that sad nostalgic smile that appeared on his face every time he thought about his mother. "When I was nine I found 6 of them. I was so euphoric" he chuckled.
He felt like several performing monkeys were banging their dishes in his brain. He slowly regained consciousness, opening his eyes.
Steve nodded. "Terminal illness. But she's fine here. Actually, she told me that the Steve from this dimension died of the same illness she did in mine. So it was a miracle for us both that we found each other. I don't know how I could have faced life without her." A tear was escaping Steve's long lashes.
Rhodey gives him a dirty look, “lets not act like I’ve slept with a million people, Tones,” he mumbles.
Its so worth it to watch Rhodey’s eyes pop out of his skull as he stands up, walking away from the camera for a moment before he returns. “Tony,
“Couple times. So much better that way,” he says, arching into Steve as he runs a hand down Tony’s side, settling it on his hip.

“There
he’s good looking so what’s Steve’s deal? Steve’s damn horn dog best friend asked him out before he did. And its not like he has no opportunities they
He’s sure he does but when Steve gets off the bed Tony props himself up on his elblow. “Um, hello, you have unfinished business,” Tony reminds him.
Of course there’s a target on Tony’s back, Steve’s always known that but he seems to fly surprisingly under the radar with people he’s not exactly on good terms with. That’d been almost strange at first, but Steve had pretty quickly realized it’s mostly due to the fact that Tony doesn’t often find himself in places Steve frequents. Or places Bucky frequents for that matter. Though it seems people have figured out his routines anyway and it hadn’t exactly been hard to guess where Tony was being held. HYDRA likes to think they’re more intelligent than they are, not that Steve really expects intelligence out of Nazis.
Oh my
“Love the way your cock feels inside me,” he tells Steve. “Drives me fuckin wild.”
, Steve.”
about this and he’ll be happy to deal with his arousal on his own. He shifts himself a little, spreading his legs just right before reaching between them and pressing a finger into himself. Yeah, good, but not enough so he adds another. He moan softly as he fucks into himself, shifting his hips until the angle is good.
“Well don’t take forever,” Tony tells him. “You know I have a small attention span.” He doesn’t, not for this anyway. He’s always liked being the center of attention and he’s discovered that he
,” he whines in an attempt to appeal to Steve’s polite side. It works because Steve’s fingers tighten around his throat just a little and Tony can’t help it, he cums with a loud moan, hand curled over Steve’s. For a solid ten seconds he swears he loses touch with the world until the pleasure fades enough for him to notice Steve breathing heavily onto his shoulder while Bucky looks satisfied, but confused.
He doesn’t though, he turns back around and comes closer if a little more slowly than necessary. Tony figures fuck it, what’s the worst that can happen with this? Steve was the one that brought up Bucky to begin with and yeah he’s a little territorial but he made his bed, he can deal with what happens when he shits in it too. So he walks over to Bucky, hooking his fingers into his belt loops and pulling him close. Bucky looks away, resembling a child with their hand caught in the cookie jar.

wants Steve’s hands on him right now.
Steve snorts from across the room. “‘Normal person,’” he mumbles, shaking his head.
like it rough so stop looking at Bucky like that Steve,” he adds before he drops his head down again, dead to the world in seconds.
“I’m not going to say I told you so,” Steve tells Bucky, grinning at him over Tony’s head.

“Yeah. Dumb ass white guy making stupid comments so I jokingly said ‘shut up, Archibald’ except the dude’s name was
, yeah, okay,” Bucky murmurs and he presses in. Tony lets out a long moan, pushing himself back onto Bucky. “
Bucky snorts and starts laughing. “So you’re a gun snob too. Good to know,” he says, walking over and leaning in for a kiss. Behind him Steve tenses and Tony thinks its about time he gets over whatever the hell his issue is with this.
“Yeah baby, you can touch me,” he says.
“I think you can do better than this, baby. I know you’re holding back,” Steve tells him. “Show me the best you’ve got.”
good right now. Tony reaches out, running his hands down Steve’s chest, almost feeling compelled to do so. Steve’s got an odd look on his face as he watches Tony’s actions, watching carefully until Tony hits his belt line and he decides to make quick work of that too.
“Wait,” Bucky yells, “
. Exams. Still, he grabs the lube and manages to get some onto his fingers, rubbing them together to warm it a little before he reaches back. Steve lets out another gasp and a small moan as Tony cirlcles his hole before pressing a finger in a little.
a change of pace.
“Uh huh. Still, this is nice,” Bucky murmurs, slipping a hand under his shirt and feeling the skin there. Tony lets out a noise that’s half impatient, half interested and it doesn’t do more than make Steve laugh softly.
Tony grins, “wouldn’t you like to know,” he says. He stole it; actually, not that it was hard. But Steve mentioned he had a thing for cheerleading uniforms and Tony’s always aimed to please. Also, Steve’s school’s color scheme isn’t shit so why not? He can deal with red, black, and white and the uniform looks adorable on him to boot. Works well with his eyeliner and couldn’t-give-a-fuck attitude.
“And the explosions?” Steve asks.
“Once, we got
“He was the one who brought it up, he did this to himself,” he points out.
He does, in fact, know how hot it is and he said it on purpose because he likes Steve like this, half wild and chasing his own pleasure. “Yeah,” Tony murmurs, tilting his head to the side. Steve takes the bait, nosing at Tony’s neck immediately as Tony runs his hands up Steve’s back. “You wanna do it?” Tony asks and Steve moans into his neck, teeth nipping at the skin there.
“I have no communication with him for a week and a half and he gets abandoned in a foreign country by his asshole father, turns to
lingering around but for now Steve isn’t really concerned about it. “It’s been awhile,” he says as Steve settles his hands back above his head. Its sweet that Tony didn’t even have to tell him what to do.
, please. Wanna fuck you bo-
to convince someone to fucking write the damn prescription, he might as well make the most of it. And Steve smells good, he always smells good, but he smells especially delicious now and now that he’s not confused about the whole situation here he’s pretty enthusiastic about the kissing thing. Tony figured his earlier admission to having been turned down plenty might mean he’s inexperienced but that doesn’t seem to correlate.
So he ignores his instinct to not piss Steve off even when Steve gives him a
weird preferences and he totally should judge Bucky for being a selfish lover. “This better work,” he mumbles and Steve grins.
, that’s it Tony. Just like that,” Bucky tells him. “
” Steve’s words are cut off as Tony lifts himself up some and falls back down again. “Lean forward a little, want that skirt to sit a little higher- that’s it,” he murmurs as Tony sits forward some, balancing himself out before he starts riding Steve in earnest.
“Baby I
“Not being turned down enough didn’t seem to leave you big headed,” Tony says like this is a real opinion he has.
Tony lets Steve do all the work mostly because he looks good doing it and also he’s talking to Rhodey. “I knew you wouldn’t last,” he says and Tony rolls his eyes.
Still, the only benefit to these trips, and it’s not

“Name one thing worse than this,” Tony asks, turning to face Steve. Normally he sort of forgets to think when he’s this close to Steve because who wouldn’t, Steve’s gorgeous. But at the moment he’s more preoccupied with his hatred of all things camping. If he sees a single fucking wasp he’s leaving.
“Well what the hell, explain yourself! How the hell did you get back to New York? And why are you in

“Don’t know if you’ve noticed, but you’re kind of drop dead gorgeous,” he points out.
may have hit a button or ten.
“That wasn’t eventful, that was poor decision making on my part,” Bucky says.
“No, I haven’t and you’re going to leave him alone Bucky Jesus,” Steve mumbles, letting him in. He knows immediately that Bucky isn’t going to listen and that’s his problem because Tony’s not likely to say yes.
“You stop that,” Steve tells him. “Or I won’t fuck you later.” Tony pouts but Steve allows it, laughing a little before turning his attention back to the way his fingers are moving inside him. “You look good like this baby, all wet like you are.”
a benefit, is calls home to Steve and Bucky. Usually Bucky’s got some new weird story, occasionally Steve has a cause or ten he’s decided to take up- point is that something interesting is always happening.
He wiggles out of the space between Steve’s legs, ignoring his disappointed noise of protest, and crawls over to his bag, rifling through it for a few moments before he finds what he needs and crawls back. He does a quick glance around and yeah alright, it’s a bit of a tight squeeze for space but he’ll manage. “Here,” he says, throwing a condom at Steve and laughing when it lands on his forehead. He makes a surprised noise and pulls the packet off his head, shaking his head.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed but you two decided that it was a good idea to go out of your way to
Steve’s hips buck up on their own accord as he moans. “Can I-” he starts, lifting a hand and Tony shakes his head.
no,” Tony says, reminding himself of Rhodey again and he’d be proud. Usually Tony is the stupid one but- oh, maybe
Steve moans, “fuck, keep talking like that and it’ll be sooner rather than later,” he says.
thinks he’s irresistible per se, its that the sheer amount of people trying to get in his pants tells him that most of the time people find him attractive. Including Rhodey and he’s mostly immune to every other charm Tony has. “I’m just saying, most people think I’m attractive so I don’t get what Steve’s deal is,” he says, shrugging.
Most people wouldn’t, given his usually aggressively independent nature. “Mmm, we all have something that’s a little surprising about us. Do that again,” Tony tells him and Steve’s teeth graze his neck again, teasing him. Tony lets out another moan, pressing himself back into Steve’s body.
“That what you want?” Bucky asks. He only considers that for a split second before he nods.
Steve carefully pries his fingers off his shirt and pulls him back into his lap. Tony allows it because he figures it might get him somewhere so he relaxes into Steve. Also, he’s fucking sore and he doesn’t have enough energy to keep up that level of fight. For a long few moments Steve says nothing and Tony’s about to get annoyed all over again when Steve finally talks. “I love you,” he murmurs, almost too low to hear over Bucky’s shower.
, ends up dating a
That gets a laugh out of Bucky, “oh believe me I will,” he murmurs, hand sliding up Tony’s crack, fingers brushing against his hole. Tony shivers, trying to raise his ass a little more as a silent invitation to Bucky. “Responsive,” Bucky says, voice soft but approving. Shares that with Steve though that’s about the only similarity so far.
“But like… you don’t suck,” Tony says, confusion clearly continuing.
Bucky hauls him back into a kiss, messy and hard as their teeth clash together for a moment before they find their footing. Doesn’t seem to matter much to Bucky, who’s clinging desperately to Tony’s hips before he pulls away and spins Tony around unexpectedly. “Bedroom,
He grins, making his way over to Bucky and wrapping his arms around his neck, drawing him in for a kiss. Bucky makes a surprised noise but goes with it, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist and pulling him in. Tony’s pleased to report that he’s a good kisser too, rougher than Steve but Tony doesn’t mind that much. “Well shit,” Bucky says as he pulls away, “that’s a better ‘welcome home’ than I got from Steve.”
close to them, and have it shaken by something you suggested to begin with. Whatever feelings Steve’s got he’ll get over them. Tony would know, he and Rhodey have the same type of relationship and they’ve been through a hell of a lot, most of it related to him being a jackass and Rhodey’s still around and they’d still do anything for each other.
“You’re the one who thinks you’re irresistible or whatever so if you’re that confident then you should have no problems with this,” Rhodey says like that’s a totally transferrable thing.
“Actually I think the STI infected dick of America might be a guy named Brock Rumlow,” Tony says, nose wrinkled again.
He examines his nails for a moment, painted a pristine black that he likes, “maybe I’ll tease you a little more. I kind of like seeing you like this,” he says and the noise Steve makes is
“That’s for being a jackass now apologize,” Tony tells him.
and he shakes his head, silently admitting that Steve was right about whatever it is Steve was right about. “Hel
“Yeah, ditched my morning classes. Rhodey’s in town,” he says and right, Steve’s heard a lot about Rhodey but at this point he thinks the guy might be a myth. He’s never around though apparently he’s in the military so that should explain that. Steve sometimes wonders if Rhodey is an extended lie Tony made up to get people to back off him. Its not really often that Tony uses Rhodey as a fake boyfriend but from what Steve has gathered they aren’t actually together. Assuming Rhodey exists.
short and he doesn’t know what the hell Bucky and Steve are silently deciding but he knows he’s going to like it.
“That’s the face he always makes when he’s about to turn someone down,” Steve says. “Sorry man.”
Good answer. Tony crawls out of Steve’s lap, appreciating Steve’s eyes on him as he goes, and stands. Steve picks himself up, spares the wall one more glance, and then turns to Tony. “I don’t know where I’m going and clearly you mapped out where everything is,” he says. “Lead the way.”
Uh, since when does he
“Really want it now,” Tony says.
“I hope you know that you’re the fucking worst,” Steve mumbles, picking him up and carrying him off to bed.
“Yeah, obviously, but I’m not a savage. I know how to control myself,” he says. So Tony smells delightful, that’s not exactly his business.
to get caught in a blast or two it just worked out that way and he knows his shit. He’s got bruised ribs but its not that bad, he’s had worse. He supposes its probably kind of fucked up that Howard has done more damage than actual explosives but in Howard’s slight defense the explosions weren’t really that large.
good as soon as Steve starts moving his fingers the way Tony wants him to. “Like that,” Tony tells them, “yeah, little faster-
“No, I’m dying if dysentery,” he says as he flees the scene, waving an arm around behind him in a sad attempt at a goodbye.
Bucky’s arms curl around him, one hand slipping under his shirt and caressing his hip bone. “What do you want, baby?” Bucky murmurs in his ear and that has no right to be that attractive.
Steve can’t help but start laughing harder because that’s probably one of the funniest things he’s ever heard. Tony, on the other hand, looks confused. “Tony, all I’ve
“You sure?” Steve asks and Tony huffs.
Steve’s at his wits end but he’s not the only one with feelings. So Steve didn’t expect a real relationship to come of this, neither did Bucky. But Tony is… well, he’s so
Tony rolls his eyes, “this wasn’t pushing limits, this was having living standards. Now come here,” he says, pulling Steve into a kiss. Steve laughs softly into it, nipping at Tony’s bottom lip as he runs a hand up his leg. Steve pulls away and Tony makes an offended noise, “you can’t go yet, you just got here,” he says, pouting.
“Look on the bright side,” Rhodey says. “Its not Florida.”
“Archibald incident?” Steve asks, obviously not paying much attention as he tumbles in looking annoyed.
He opens the button, pulling down the zipper slowly. Steve doesn’t mind, watching as he does it thoughtfully. Tony decides he doesn’t need further instructions either and goes right ahead, pulling Steve out of his boxers and stroking him. “Eager,” Steve tells him, shaking his head. Tony just grins because yeah, he is. “Get on my cock,” Steve tells him, prodding him forward.
“Please, leave him anywhere for five minutes and he’ll have some weird ass tale to tell. Except you, you’re not weird, just surprising,” Steve tells him, wrapping an arm around his waist.
Clearly Bucky forgot about that because he’s got the memory of a sieve but thankfully he’s got Steve around to remind him of important things like this. “No, its weird,” Bucky says and Steve pinches the bridge of his nose.
For a moment he looks annoyed too but he seems to realize something and he best fucking voice it because Tony doesn’t have the patience today. “I… I’ve never actually been with someone I loved before. Cared about sure, but love? Never really felt like it was in the cards for me.”
,” Steve murmurs and Tony laughs.
“I can’t believe you sold him out that fast,” Steve says.
“Steve,” Tony whines, fingers twisted in the sheets.
Though at the moment he’s got bigger things to worry about because he happens to know that Steve’s managed to drag Bucky home and Tony figures he should make a good first impression. The knob twists all the way and Steve slips in, offering him a small, sheepish smile as he does so. Behind him Tony figures is Bucky and yeah alright, Steve’s hot but his best friend is hotter and Tony may have just agreed to the deal of a lifetime he
?” Tony asks, enunciating his words and okay, at least Steve’s half busted ear isn’t lying to him.
,” Steve moans, “you feel
can do that but not Tony? Double standard.
“Get the hell outta there, he doesn’t know shit. Keep your damn mouth shut,” Rhodey hisses at him.
“I’ve got glaucoma in one eye and what the hell is that supposed to mean?” he asks, catching up too late to the implication that Tony’s interest should have been visible to him before this. Assuming he’s drawn his conclusions right.
Tony huffs out a laugh because that’s more scientific than he thought it’d be but then Sam
his thoughts on that. “Do it,” he tells Steve, “Choke me.” Steve crowds in closer, hand flexing a little against Tony’s throat as he fucks into Tony faster. “Steve,” Tony whines, hand still over Steve’s. “
Tony knows what he’s actually asking. If he likes any of this at all, because Steve cares about that kind of thing. He shakes his head, “not exactly,” he tells Steve and he raises an eyebrow.
Steve looks over to Bucky and shrugs but he knows them well enough that it’s not an agreement to do what Tony wants. “You seem kinda wound tight,” Bucky tells him and uh,
“Don’t get myself involved in situations I’m not enthusiastic about,” Tony tells him and Bucky laughs.
Its not that
“Fuck, Bucky,” he murmurs. Bucky knows what he’s asking because he reaches down, hand sliding into Tony’s pants til his hand reaches Steve’s and he moans into Tony’s mouth.
“You two don’t get to torment me like that. Kiss. Again,” he tells them.
“Do you ever have patience?” he murmurs and no he doesn’t but especially not
“I actually like him so I think I’m going to stick around for a bit until I get bored or married, we’ll see what happens first,” he says.
would you choose Bucky?” he mumbles. Steve has other friends, Tony knows this because he’s seen them so why
“Fuck camping and
“Not what I’d call it,” he mumbles and Tony snorts.
He’s in that ridiculous party phase collage kids seem to go through and Steve has no idea how that has any appeal or maybe he just hates everyone Bucky gets drunk with, he’s not sure. Either way he’d rather show up at Nat’s but then he’s got to deal with Gamora and there’s nothing
Bucky doesn’t know what to make of Tony’s aggressively forcing Steve to like… deal with their relationship. He also doesn’t know what to do with the face that Steve’s like… okay with it, at least on some level. He’s not happy with the whole thing but he’s not exactly shy about telling people to stuff it either. Just because he’s head over heels in love with Tony doesn’t mean he’d be an exception. He’s got no problem telling Bucky to stuff it, even if its usually with looks these days.
brought up Bucky too so you should apologize to him for not considering that feelings can happen and not planning for it either. Honestly,” he mumbles, shaking his head.
By the time Steve comes back Bucky has stopped worrying about his reaction and started to worry that Tony’s bed hog habits are a permanent thing. He’s taking up the entire bed minus the corner Bucky has staked out for himself and the guy is fucking tiny, even
“Tony,” Steve moans, “so good like this,” he murmurs. “So damn-
“Not that I know of,” Steve says.
“You ever done that before?” Steve asks and Tony nods.
got this done! Sorry it took 80 years, but this is a long chapter and its mostly smut so hopefully that makes up for it!
“Fuck, Tony you’ve got me,” Steve tells him. “Had me since I walked in on you bent over your desk trying to find a plug.”
I was worried I let my guard down too soon,” he mumbles, hand pressed to his heart.
, yeah- fuck me right. Move a little faster- like that,
Tony lets out a long, annoyed groan. “Oh my
and you managed to make chlorine gas. The hell kind of knowledge set do you have?”
see that’s not the whole reason so he gives him a
When he opens the door to the hotel room he’s in he’s surprised to find his grandfather on the other side of it looking worried. “Are you okay?” he asks and Tony rolls his eyes.
Bucky bites his lip, still unsure but he’s looking at Tony now with something that’s a little more than temptation on his face. “Pretty mad,” Bucky says.
Bucky snorts and starts laughing but Steve looks offended. “Come on, he’s not wrong. You were the moron who thought jumping out of a plane with no parachute was a good idea and I had to rescue your idiot ass,” he says, referencing an event that sounds like it would give Tony a heart attack. Possibly literally. Actually, kind of sounds like something he would do and then give
not as difficult as you made it,” he tells Steve, who laughs
Rhodey rolls his eyes at him though, “I don’t have advice, man. Just ask him out its not that hard.”
“If you saw yourself in that skirt you’d be impatient too,” Steve tells him, damn accent of his making a reappearance.
, I’m still here,” Tony tells them, waving a hand around.
Tony laughs a little, moaning softly as Bucky hits the right spot. “Better than mine too,” Tony tells him and he’s not short on imagination.
“Pansexual doesn’t necessarily orient itself around a gender the way ‘gay’, ‘straight’, and sometimes ‘bi’ does. But I kind of prefer queer over that- its nebulous and ill defined, which is kind of how I feel about my gender and sexuality as a whole. Easier to chose a poorly defined label than a badly fitting one,” he says.
“Consent dumbass. And honestly I think I’ve made my interest clear.” He has good communication skills or so he’s been told.
“I already altered it to fit me so yeah,” he says. Someone had to get rid of those stupid built in underwear.
impatient,” Bucky says, “give me a minute to admire the view.”
“Alright,
Steve, because he’s intent on being an asshole today, continues to play dumb. “Still don’t know what you’re talking about,” he mumbles, not even looking at Tony and he’s got no patience for this.
the flaw,” he says, nose in the air.
, they are done making plans here its Tony’s turns to make plans they’ve proven they’re mean about planning. He can’t believe they pulled this shit while he was halfway across the
Rhodey rolls his eyes, “I already know all I need to from his name. This is like the Archibald incident last year,” he says as the door to the tent unzips.
“No on account of we’re camping and I thought this looked fine with these,” he says, gesturing to the black ankle length boots on his feet. They’re flat, which is why he chose them, and still wholly inappropriate for camping but they’re the closest he has to appropriate shoes for this kind of thing.
Tony laughs and flips the camera showing Rhodey the familiar skyline. “I’m in Brooklyn and you weren’t misinformed by Pepper.”
“Too long,” Steve agrees. Yeah, Tony had exams the month before Steve- university schedule- and then Steve had his exams so they’ve mostly met up for short periods of time before one or the other had to study for something.
“Fucking little prick,” the guy snarls, grabbing hold of Tony’s throat and squeezing. It’s a weird first reaction, he knows, to start laughing however strangled it comes out, but he’s long ago figured out that strange reactions get people to back off because they don’t know what to make of them. Either that or he’s about to get punched again, he’ll wait and see.
-” his words cut out as Steve hits the right spot and- “Steve I’m gunna cum, I-” Tony’s words drop as Steve moves his wrist just right and he reaches behind him, settling one hand on Steve’s hip and the other over the hand Steve has on his hip. “Fuck, Steve, I-” he stops talking as his pleasure becomes his priority and he moans, grinding himself down on Steve’s dick as he cums.
, like you were suffering,” Bucky mumbles. “Come on, let’s go,” he tells Tony, picking up his hand and pulling him off. Tony reaches out for Steve, snagging his hand as Bucky drags them both off to the bedroom.
Long story he’ll make short for Bucky’s sake. “I looked up his porn habits and also he’s made comments about us enough to put the pieces together. Literally only took him five seconds to mention it the first time we slept together,” he points out.
“Needy,” Steve accuses like he doesn’t like that about him. But he does at least comply with Tony as his fingers trace along the now loose beltline of his pants briefly before he reaches down, brushing his fingers against Tony’s hole and he lets out a small gasp as Steve moans a little.
“I won’t,” Bucky says.
,” Steve yells from the living room and Tony sighs, pulling his ass out of bed and stumbling his way to the living room.
“Don’t leave me hanging baby, I wanna know,” he says. “Wanna know what about this is good for you.”
that difficult to calculate the angle a punch is coming in at and the force they’re more than likely coming at you with and then dodge it. And apparently no one taught HYDRA to maybe not leave massive openings in their stances. Shit, I know about four things about beating the hell out of someone properly and I know
Tony’s a teenager too but he’s also in university so he feels he doesn’t count.
porn history is alphas fucking I’m going to assume the level of success we’ll get is high. Especially considering it appears he goes out of his way to find people who look like us.” He did his research and he’s offended Bucky doesn’t seem to think he would. Besides, its porn history. Its not like it was a hardship for him to go through.
too. Not that he planned that, the in between parts of the sex bit make them not worth his while if he can help it. And he can do the sex thing any time so frankly the entire thing is just a pain in his ass, figuratively of course.
So when Steve walks in he’s more concerned about Tony’s ability to grow but only when he wants to take up every available inch of bed space rather than the anger that makes itself known on Steve’s face as soon as he spots Tony spread out. “The hell is this?” he asks, gesturing to Tony’s body taking up
“And you skill with hand to hand combat?” Bucky asks softly, appearing at the door looking surprisingly good considering Tony’s pretty sure that’s not
He watches Steve consider fighting him on it for a moment, but abandons it in favor of Tony. Steve shakes his head, “always gotta push the limit, don’t you?” he murmurs.
Yeah, alright, how was he to know his roommate was ass deep in depression humor. Usually he only hears it out of Bucky so it’d thrown him off and also Tony had to stretch to reach that window and he’d been distracted by it. Threw him off. He’s about to tell Tony that when a knock on the door sounds and Steve sighs. Probably Bucky. Tony gives the door a weary glance and disappears into the bathroom.
me Tony,” Steve says. Steve’s pace gets faster as his hips shift to meet Tony’s and he grins, wondering how fast he can get Steve to cum.
, okay, Tony can do that. He complies, rolling onto his back in what has to be record time before Bucky is on him again, grabbing a wrist and pinning it above his head with a harsh grip. It hurts but Tony finds he likes it, moaning as Bucky presses back into him fast and hard. His other hand falls to Tony’s hip, gripping it almost as tight as his wrist as he fucks into Tony almost harshly.
, Tony,” he murmurs, fingers tightening around his hips.
“Honey,
brought this whole Bucky thing up, you didn’t even react badly to it when you brought him home that first time so what the hell changed?” And what changed fast enough for Bucky to pick up on before anything meaningful ever came of it?
“God you’re so good like this,” Bucky tells him, “always feel fucking amazing wrapped around me. Lean back a little,
Tony grins, “Am I now?” he asks.
“Who the fuck let you leave whatever lab you were cooked up in?” Tony asks, looking hilariously baffled. Helps that the rosy tone that his cheeks have taken on really only contribute to his current look of confusion. And also his general beauty.
“He works in a restaurant, they have good food and he gets it for free,” he says and Tony can
“Just because the choking thing is… weird doesn’t mean I have plain sex tastes I’m normal. You’re the weird ones,” Bucky tells them.
“Lets see what we can do about that fantasy of yours, hmm?” Tony murmurs, grabbing Steve’s wrist and removing his hand from his ass. Steve makes a disappointed noise but he can suck it up, Tony likes the idea of making Steve beg for it. Looks like he’s half way there already. He leans forward, placing Steve’s other hand above his head as he kisses him. “You’re gunna keep your hands up here,” Tony tells him as he nips at Steve’s bottom lip, “while I ride you.”
“I know it is baby,” Steve tells him, nosing at his neck. Tony tilts his head to the side, giving Steve access and moaning when his teeth graze the skin of his neck. “
“No. Fuck me,” Tony tells him and he’s glad he gets a good look at Steve face when he says it too because he’s never quite seen him make that face before and he’s always liked being a special snowflake.
do that again.
when my feet go nowhere near my ass?” he asks.
“Need you,” Tony tells him and Steve nods.
Steve drags his ass off his bed and goes to the door, finding Bucky behind it looking pleased with himself. “Can you like, not drool on Tony its weird,” Steve tells him in place of a greeting.
Tony carefully balances himself out with his hands on Bucky’s chest and moves, teasing them a little as he lifts off some and sinks back down slowly. He does it again, watching as both Steve and Bucky’s breath hitches. “Faster,” Bucky tells him, tapping his thigh. “Come on, wanna feel what you can do,” Bucky murmurs.
, Bucky do that-
?” he asks when the two don’t say or do anything. Steve turns to give Bucky a
Oh my good god this was like pulling teeth but you bet your sweet asses I finally got this damn thing done! I'm tired as hell but I got it done! Also, once again (or rather continuously) AO3 is doing that weird thing where it conjoins the italics words to the word before or after it. I combed though it but if there's weird italics attached to words that's why.
