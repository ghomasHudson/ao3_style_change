Tony looked back to Steve. Steve’s eyes were so grey now. They’d lost that intense blue that Tony knew and… admired. Tony looked into Steve’s eyes, and past his own masked reflection he saw ninety years of hurt and loss and exhaustion. Well, thirty years and some change.
Tony chuckled. “When is it not?”

Jarvis did not answer.
been their friend too.
“I don’t know, Hap, it all seems pretty damn clear to me!”
from the back of the lab told Tony Jarvis was done teasing him. One of the suits thudded over. The dusty pink arms of the MK Fifty-Six, or Sweetie-Pi, lifted Tony off the ground princess style. The AI even quipped,
He heaved a sigh. There was no indication that’d he done so past the brush of static out of the suit’s speakers.
Tony wanted to be proud that Pepper adjusted so quickly to a potential threat- didn’t miss a beat! Unfortunately that pride found itself overshadowed by unyielding rage. “You know, about that- it’s real easy to keep a low profile when you get tossed out like trash after having what I’m convinced was a magic stroke! But enough about me and my garbage friends, how are you ?”
“It’s just- do you really think it’d be a good look, having one of your suits carry you into the hospital? The hospital you’re already admitted to?”
“You know how it goes- had a stroke, got thrown in the lab, then everyone forgot about me and fucked off!”
“Don’t yell at him for being the adult here, Tony.”
could lift you if I wore one of the suits.”
It did none of those things. But Tony was too busy to notice.
He should
“Well I don’t need your help.”
“The last time I saw you I jammed my shield into your chest.”
“Are you sure? Because for being a genius, the last few decisions you’ve made have been pretty stupid,” Happy snapped. Tony glared at him. As an afterthought, Happy added, “sir.”
Happy could not lift the suit. “I’m gonna call Captain Rogers,” he wheezed, letting the suit drop the scant few inches he’d managed to lift it.
able to save her drink from Tony. At least she was alright though- thank goodness he hadn’t fallen more to the left. Tony waved her concern off.
Tony growled, pushing his armored face deeper into the plush sheets. He was probably ruining them, laying here in the suit and clutching at them with his metal plated fingers. But that was okay. Tony ruined things all the time. He was good at it.
He shook his head pulled away. Reality righted itself once more- but that only meant he could see that Steve had joined the party. Ugh, what, did he slide down the whole in the floor? Real classy.
“Did you tell him we need that paperwork from 2008?”
In the elevator, Happy paused, finger hovering over the ground floor button.
Happy frowned, cocking his head to the side. “Six feet?”
“Happy, I swear to god if you’re pointing a gun at me I will fire you so fast your head will spin.”
“Tony! Oh my god, are you alright?”
Happy decocked his gun, or at least, for his sake he better have. Tony heaved a sigh of relief. He listened as happy hurried over. Tony felt sweaty hands scrabble at his shoulders.
“No!” Tony bit out. “Keep going!” There was a lull in the pain. It creeped back up his body to sit bubbling behind his eyes. There, see? He could do this.
“Your. Body. Tony. When you passed out we took you to the
“Yup! Next question, how tall are you?”
“Yeah. I guess it is.”
“Well, Pepper is five nine, but you see my point.”
Happy’s sweaty hands grabbed at his face. The man’s worried face filled Tony’s scope of vision. Poor guy was all red. “Tony! Tony, talk to me, are you alright?”
“Yeah, that’s prob’ly fair.”
“I’m sorry?” Tony looked to Happy, but the other man only gave vague gestures with his hands, as if to say ‘don’t ask me.’
“If it affects how we enter Stark, how we land, how we proceed from here,” said Natasha, “then it has everything to do with this.”
“What?”
help!” The suit’s palms spat heat and flame as he jolted to an upright position. Standing on the bed like this, Tony could look down at Steve instead of up.
“Not now, Jarvis-“
There was Happy, and there, on the ground was... his suit.
A little girl with tears streaming down her face raised her hand.
He hadn’t tried it again.
“Five eight, without those hooker boots you wear all the time.”
Tony bristled at Steve’s fatherly tone. “How did you even get up here so fast? Did Happy show you the way?” He shook his head and tsked. “Can’t get good security these days.”
Tony wanted to kick himself. “So. Wizards,” he said, trying to backtrack.
“Aw fuck me,” Tony groaned.
Oh that was rich. Of course the great Captain America would see Tony’s desire for alone time as evidence that he was some damaged little boy who needed an adult to make things better. If he could have, Tony would have rolled his eyes.
the suit and touch his very existence. Tony shuddered. He was going to be sick! That hand slid from shoulder to back. He could see the movement flash before his eyes in great rippling galaxies. The person touching him said his name, and Tony could taste the voice on the back of a tongue he couldn't feel. It tasted like honeysuckle.
Pepper gasped. “Tony? That’s not…
“Tony! Don't you dare stall.” Pepper’s face was completely red, and Tony worried she was about to have an aneurysm.
“You left me in the
Tony would have grinned, if he could. “Jarvis! You are quite the sound for sore ears, you know.” Tony liked to think that Jarvis would have grinned too, if he could.
No, no,
The other man pouted. “Hey hey hey, you try babysitting a bunch of superheroes, see how easy it is for you.” After a minute, he looked up, staring at something Tony couldn’t see. A grin spread wide across his face, something that immediately worried the genius. “Hey boss,” Happy started.
Pepper made a soft, hurt sound. Tony could picture her brows pinching up in the middle, eyes getting glassy with angry tears. “I’m at the hospital
“The connection will linger for a short while after the Gift,” the alien told him after a considering pause.  “Then, it will fade. By the time you are back to your home, you will not feel it anymore.”
There was a long pause, and he wondered if for once, Tony had actually beat him to sleep.  “Go to sleep, Shawshank,” Tony whispered from above.
“Nothing happened.  Not—not like that. Like what you’re—it wasn’t like
Steve dutifully bit into the meat, then reached for the waterbag, taking a long drink. Down the path, he could see Captain Rhodes returning from relaying the new orders to the battalion commanders, Clint’s horse trotting docilely behind him.  Clint himself walked some distance behind, eventually stalking into camp and dropping his pack next to the fire and gazing balefully at where Rhodes hobbled his horse next to the others in the soft grass by the stream.
Tony’s pace sped up, battering at Steve’s hole, and then his thrusts faltered, and his body seized, slamming into Steve once more as he spilled his seed.  He chased the feeling with a few more shallow thrusts, emptying himself inside Steve, then pulled out and dropped back onto the edge of the bed, breathing hard.  Steve watched him scrape a hand through his damp hair, leaving it in a mess of curls pasted to his head, then looked up at Steve.  His mouth opened, then closed, and he drew in a long breath, face going soft.
“Hey, hey, whoa, chill out, man.  God, you’ve got your back up today,” Brock said.  “Didn’t mean anything by it.”
“Tony…it’s in a basement,” Steve observed in frustration. He watched Tony look around his workshop, as if seeing it for the first time, and maybe it actually was the first time Tony had looked at it through any lens but that of a loving creator, inhabiting the space he was meant for.
. I really dig the whole vibe you got going, man. So cool. Lot of people say I look a bit like you, you know?”
Tony nodded, once, and his hand left Steve long enough to pull his boots off.  They hit the floor with twin thuds.  He was tugging his shirt over his head when Steve managed to clear the cobwebs from his head and sit up to help. He pulled Tony’s shirt off and tossed it to the floor, then framed his hands on Tony’s stomach, moving them slowly up the curve of Tony’s chest, over his nipples and across his shoulders, then down his arms.  Tony held himself still, breaths coming in shallow pants, eyes wide on Steve.
Except, of course, that he decidedly wasn’t dead or really anything worse than famished at the moment, and that was only because he hadn’t gotten up and eaten whatever it was his Alpha had prepared for him.  If he told his mom that, she’d freak.  Which, admittedly, made it almost worth calling her.   If she asked him how he was doing, and she would, of course, he could lie or admit that this whole thing didn’t entirely suck, which might make her feel better, and he wasn’t ready to be that generous just yet.
“That’s--what? That’s...you can’t just...I’m not--I’m not telling you, Jesus, that’s... “ Steve trailed off, shaking his head and breathing out a shaky laugh.  The man had to be joking.  He was joking, right?  This was some rich guy’s idea of a prank or something.
To be fair, this probably wasn’t going to end well either.
“This is good,” Steve said, wiping his mouth after finishing nearly half the burger in one bite.  Tony signaled their waitress to bring another.  They had both shucked off their tuxedo jackets and ties, and Steve had the sleeves of his crisp, white shirt rolled up to his elbows.  Tony had just unbuttoned the cuffs and shoved his shirt unceremoniously up his arm.  Both of their fingers were shining with enough grease to clog an artery, but as he leaned against the back of the booth, spreading his arms wide, he realized he hadn’t been this relaxed in…well.  In a while.  “Have you…have I, I mean, do we…” Steve stammered, cutting himself off abruptly.
“You know what I think?” Tony asked, warmth blooming in his chest.
It shouldn’t hurt so much. Not by now.  He didn’t even like it, though he thought, maybe, maybe with the Stranger, it wouldn’t be like with Tyber.  His throat closed and his eyes watered, but he managed to get to his feet and walk out of the cave on stiff legs.  The man called out something to him, but Anto couldn’t possibly go back. His shame, the bitter disappointment, it was too much.  He wanted nothing more than to sit at Jhrvis’ hearth and arrange his plants and powders and not think about how he was so disgusting that even a man of the Others with no other option didn’t want him.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, feeling his fist close around the drive T’Challa had given him.
Tony sighed, pulled a face, and scratched at his head, then nodded a bit and looked up at the alien.
“Steve?” Tony said against the top of Steve’s head. Steve drew back and his eyes snapped to Tony’s, then immediately dropped down again. Huh. That was…oh.
“I love you, too, Winghead.  You know that, right? I do.  I have. For so long.  I wanted to tell you, I did, God, it about killed me to lie to you, you have to know that,” Tony husked out.   He could hear the sirens getting closer and the flash of lights between the alleyways was already sending stripes of red and blue across the street.  “I’m sorry.”
Tony was quiet again, his eyes distant as he looked out over the pond, fixed at some faraway point that wasn’t Steve.  “It’s not...
“I’m sorry. About tonight,” Steve said with a grimace.  “I wanted it to be fun, a night out for you.  Someone like you, you should be…out there.  Having a good time.”
“I guess,” Steve said with a shrug.  “It’s okay.  They’re pretty good about hiring veterans.  Sam found it for me.”
“Steve,” Tony breathed out, long and low, like chant or a prayer, almost a hum, and Steve knew it for the answer it was.
“I like how you show your gratitude,” Tony said.  The look was gone, a smirk that didn’t quite meet Tony’s eyes replaced it.  “Please, feel free to express your appreciation—“
“Bruce shares some of your wildly inaccurate thoughts about the way of the world,” Tony told Steve with a side-eyed look.
“I meant to leave you alone. I did.  I tried.  But, I--I couldn’t. I worried. Constantly. The War--I intended to help, regardless, but...I had to be near you, at least as much as I could,” Tony admitted, grimacing as he pulled Steve closer to him, his hands coming up to cradle Steve’s face.  “Only when you were here, where I could keep watch, where I could see you settled, was I finally content. I thought it was the Claim. I told myself it was something I had done wrong with the ritual, despite my efforts,” Tony sighed, “but, I think it was, perhaps, something more.  Or, it became something more, those years during the War.  Do you remember, my Captain?”
“Thanks, Agent Paz.  I’m sure SI would appreciate the opportunity to compete.  Tony, he’s got all these amazing ideas.  You wouldn’t believe some of the things he talks about.  It’s all way above my head,” Steve said, giving the agents what Tony thought of as Steve’s aw-shucks grin.  Tony clamped his mouth shut and narrowed his eyes, watching Steve charm the agents through things like requisitions and cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangements like he was shilling used cars.
what the black canvas meant, at least, Tony thought with a frown.   In a way Tony could understand that didn’t make him feel like an idiot for not instantly seeing it that way.  Steve would have gotten all enthusiastic about it, probably.  Told Tony about how it was like one of Tony’s black holes or something.  Something that made sense.  Steve was good at that.  He’d always liked that about Steve.
Tony took the chain from his mouth and laid it across Steve’s chest with gentle, careful hands.  He was coming down.  Sinking, Steve thought, though the word held little meaning.
“Tony,” Steve broke in, reaching a hand across the table and placing it over Tony’s own hand, which was fisted into his napkin.  “I’m saying, I’ll give you a key.  Okay?  You should have a key.”
He wasn’t even sure what was a lie anymore and what he just wished were not true.  Maybe it didn’t matter, not now.
None of it made any sense.  But, the memories, the feelings, the seemingly random thoughts, they were all familiar enough that Tony’s mind parsed it into something.
“Jesusfuckingchrist,” Tony managed, his head tipping back until he was staring up at the blinding overhead lights, a deep, quaking moan torn from his throat.  Steve’s whole body thrummed with energy at the sound, his own cock a matching version of Tony’s, leaking fluid over his stomach and thighs and onto the mat beneath him.  There was something about having Tony like this that sent a heady surge of power and protectiveness through Steve. Tony and his tactile hands, always touching, making Steve feel alive, driving out everything else, his watchful eyes, seeing so much and not nearly enough, and here he was, hands immobile and eyes forced to watch only his own reactions.  Because he trusted Steve.  It was more than Steve should have, really, this faith that Tony placed in him, when he couldn’t fully return it, not yet.  He couldn’t take that chance.
“Tony, they aren’t going to arrest us,” Steve said, putting his plate aside and leaning forward in his seat so his elbows were on his thighs.  “Can you trust me on that?”
.  It never will be.  You want something that cannot be, Raj’Inama.  He is the King, and you, me, all of this, everything you see, all that you eat, all of it, belongs to him.  He asks nothing save that you care for him, which you do!  You do, I know you do!  And yet you—you refuse to just—ugh!  Why must you make everything so difficult?”
“Pepper, my dearest one, tell me why your morning was strange,” Tony asked dutifully, head cocked to one side while he waited.
. This world. These people.  This way you can barely tell who is your enemy and who is your friend on any given day. This thing they call freedom and mean freedom for
“I mean it,” Steve said, watching Tony’s face relax.
“Let’s pretend I’m not kidding.  I mean, you know who I am.” Stark shrugged lightly, mouth pursing.  “What would you say?”
“My brother’s spell was intended for me, to take my knowledge of the aether, and what it can do, and steal from me the truth that he sat the throne in our Father’s place,” Thor explained, sounding grim.  “Our Captain threw his shield and deflected Loki’s spell at the last moment, or that would have been my fate. Now, I fear, it is he who must suffer this violation. As Loki has escaped to realms unknown, I can only hope there is some aid for the Captain to be found on Asgard.”
I started this as the Thank You Fic for the prompt request for something from the Gift With Purchase Remix story and then abandoned it to go a different direction, which ended up as the Bonus chapter that is already posted.  For whatever reason, I decided to finish this the other night.  So, here you go.  Angst-rimming.  Its a thing.
“What I get out of it?” Tony bit out.  “I get—“ he broke off, grinding his teeth together in an effort to keep the words in.  What did he get?  He got the devil you know, he supposed with a dull pang that seemed to shake through his whole body.  The one sitting next to him, who had at least made a show of trying.  “It would be an honor to be your Omega, Captain,” Tony said stiffly.
, more real. He didn’t know how to explain it, but couldn’t shake the feeling.
“It’s not about fixing you,” Steve argued. “It’s not. Nothing’s wrong with you.  You just need…a little help, that’s all.  The new arm, it’ll make things easier, right?  Be more comfortable than that one we got before.  Let you do more.  Be more independent. You can, I don’t know, maybe try a job again.  Get out of the apartment more.  You wouldn’t feel so different, you know? Sam could--”
“I was frozen in ice for seventy years, and I swear that car ride was longer,” Steve replied, face falling into a loose grin.  Tony watched as Steve’s throat bobbed as he swallowed, eyes flicking up and down Tony.
It was weird, right? Right, Tony told himself, turning it all over in his mind. Not that he was going to complain. If Steve didn't want him, well, then great. Awesome. Perfect.
Steve didn’t really have anything to say to that.  Bucky had hated this whole idea from the moment Clint brought it up.  And it wasn't like Bucky was exactly wrong, after all. It was a terrible idea.  Hadn’t he decided last night that he was done with this?  He had to admit that he was less sure of that than he had been when he’d agreed to it on the phone earlier with Ms. Romanov, now that the moment was upon him.  But…it had been okay last night.  Better than okay, if he was honest with himself.  It was hard to admit enjoying something like that, but he couldn’t deny that when Ms. Romanov had said Tony wanted to see him again, something sharp and hot had spiked through his chest, settling low in his stomach.  He was pretty sure it was anticipation.
He wanted Steve.
“Tony…” Steve started, a frown tightening his jaw.
“Ummm,” Steve slurred out, blinking slowly down at him.
“I assumed.  Alright, Mr. Rogers, you’ll get a text from me right about...now,” Ms. Potts cut in over Steve’s stammering, and sure enough, Steve’s phone pinged.  “That will be an NDA. Non-Disclosure Agreement.  Do you know what that is?”
“Beautiful,” Tony said, then braced one hand at the back of Steve’s neck and one hand at the place where his arms crossed behind his back and eased him down until his forehead touched the carpet, leaving his ass in the air. Tony’s hands spread him apart, and Steve’s whole body tensed as he felt the first puff of warm breath against his stinging hole. He squirmed a bit, the chains tugging at his nipples, but he couldn’t help it. A high-pitched, desperate cry leapt from his throat.
Was he really going to do this? He pulled the baseball cap lower over his face and hiked up his jacket collar, looking up and down the alleyway. It seemed deserted, save for a few homeless people standing around a barrel and a city bus lumbering by a couple of blocks to the right. There were a lot of rusted cars and parts off to one side, and he could hear a dog’s occasional bark from there, though it never appeared from its hiding place. It was oddly disconcerting, feeling this alone, even on the outskirts of the city. He had no reason to think this was some elaborate trap, not when Tony suggested it in the first place, but he couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched now that he was here.
“Where did you get that?” Tony demanded, the words sticking in his throat.  “Let me guess, it arrived anonymously. When? Last night, right? Son of a—” he broke off with a tight grimace.  “Look, that isn’t what it looks like,” Tony protested.
believe that some things couldn’t be bought, even if he’d forgotten that for a weekend.  He wanted Tony to believe that, too. Tony deserved to believe that.  Maybe more than anyone.
“But?” Tony prodded. “Come now, I have missed your counsel of late, my soldier. I know you are hardly shy with an opinion,” he smiled.
Tony looked over at the time display again.  If he fell asleep right now, he could get…well, actually as much sleep as he wanted, seeing as how he didn’t really  have to get up in the morning.   Perk of being a billionaire. Except…maybe he wanted to get up.  Early, like.  Right around when someone returned from their morning run, say.  He would apologize, again, for last night.  Offer to make it up to Steve.  Something all friendly and non-hetero-threatening, Tony thought with a small, wistful smile.
“No. No, Tony, it doesn’t bother me.  It’s amazing. It looks like something from Kandinsky,” Steve said.
“Steeeeee—eeee----eeeeeee---eeeeevvvve,” Tony chanted, swallowing air.  His mouth was suddenly full of saliva and he had to wipe it across the back of his hand.  Then, Steve was pushing his lace-covered tongue inside Tony’s hole, inside him--God, shit, fuck,
The King was hunched over the table, drawing something on the parchment, then stretching out his arm to scribble something on another piece, seemingly engrossed, again, in whatever it was he was doing. He would sometimes get up, almost in a frenzy, and rush over to do something on the gear or the cannon, then return to the parchment spread in front of him.  Sometimes, he simply turned and looked at the apparatus sitting in his workshop for long stretches of time.
“Stay back! I know what you are,” Steve shouted, making the sign of the cross as much out of habit as any belief that it might help.
Thank you to everyone still hanging in here for this fic and to anyone new brave enough to try a WiP that has been a WiP for this long.  I am slow, but I do finish things eventually.  This is actually Part I of this Chapter, but I decided to split it up because it was getting long, even by my standards.  Part II is about halfway done, so hopefully not too far off.  With that said, please enjoy!
“I missed you,” Steve breathed out, looking down at him.  Tony felt Steve’s fingers curl into his hair where he still cradled Tony’s head with his hand, nails scraping over the nape of his neck.
What did it matter?  He was getting himself worked up over nothing. It was one night. One night, for crying out loud. Just do it. Get it over with. Quit being such a prude about it.  It was just sex. So, let it happen, and then...then, he could get back to Brock and they could...have this money and be happy.  Everything would be better once Brock wasn’t worried about money all the time. Of course, it would. That was a lot of stress on anyone.
Steve turned before he could see Tony’s reaction and walked to the bench by the mirrored wall where his bag was sitting next to bottle of water.  He didn’t want to see concern on Tony’s face. For some reason, he just couldn’t look at that right now.  It isn’t the hard blow that breaks you, he thought, as he sat down and grabbed the water bottle.  It’s the soft touch, he thought.  That’s the one that gets you.  He could almost feel it, skimming over his skin, feather-light and heavier than anything on earth.  He couldn’t handle that right now.  Not from Tony.  It was too close to what he wanted to be so damn far from what he could have.
his clothes.
Subtlety, thy name is Tony Stark, he thought with a grimace.
“Figures,” Rhodey said.
“Wasn’t she, like, psy-ops or something back in the day?” Sam asked.
“Fine by me,” Steve replied.
“Tony, a pleasure,” Professor Thorne said, turning to shake Tony’s hand, which Tony remembered to do after Steve nudged his shoulder.  “I’ve heard so much about you.”
He was sore, that much was true.  Moreso than he felt like admitting to Tony, but it wasn’t bad, and in a strange way, he liked this vestige of last night that his body seemed to carry into the morning.  Each stab of pain, each moment of discomfort, it all carried a memory of pleasure along with it, all tied up in his head, the way his mother’s ball of old strings of yarn got so twisted up together, you couldn’t quite tell where one color ended and another began.  His muscles pulled where they had been stretched and tense last night.  His nipples ached and even just the touch of the water on them was enough to make Steve hiss when Tony helped him into the bath this morning, but it wasn’t terrible.  Greyish bruises, still faint, but there, darkened his skin where the chains had been. His limbs were a little stiff at first, but the warm water loosened them.  Other parts of him were tender, too, he thought, as he felt a deeper pang of soreness when he shifted his position, but, overall, he felt…good, he decided, letting the word drift around in his mind, vibrating aloft on some kind of pleasant hum that echoed in his head.
“Excuse, Ma’am,” Steve’s voice said. And really, he just had such a nice voice.  Tony could listen to it all day.  They should talk more.  Why didn’t they talk more?  Maybe on the island. “Director Fury had your call, um, ‘hacked,’ I think he said it was.  I’m sorry for the intrusion.”
“Tony didn’t have a reservation for his birthday at that restaurant!” Barnes yelled back, earning a hard tug on the shoulder of his jacket from Nat.
Steve nodded lamely, then dropped his gaze to the floor.  When the man—when Kirk, who was standing here in Steve’s crappy apartment, looking amazing with his wide, brown eyes and soft curls, too-tight jeans and AC/DC t-shirt—said it out loud, the half-baked scheme Steve had cooked up in his head the night before sounded ridiculous.  He’d been desperate, because Professor Martin had pulled him aside after class and warned him about the grade.  A failing grade was bad enough on its own, but it put his scholarship at risk, and if he lost that, there was no way he could afford the tuition.
“No, no, it’s--it’s fine, Tony, I...I guess we were a bit old-fashioned,” Steve said.
“This is my stop,” Steve told him.  “Thanks for breakfast. And the company.”
t was nice that Tony seemed to like it, though. He got his arm under Tony’s and ran his hand up and down Tony’s back.  He had a nice back, Steve thought idly.  He tightened his hold and bent his head to kiss the top of Tony’s, quick and almost clandestine, just because he could.  His hair was almost dry now, soft and fluffy except for a few stray damp strands.  Tony sighed again, his fingers tracing a small pattern against Steve’s ribs.  He threw one leg over Steve’s.  That was nice, too, Steve decided, letting out a yawn, though he was still too keyed up to sleep.  Instead, he replayed the evening in his head for a while.  It all had a dreamlike quality to it, even now, but Tony was real and here, and that was so, so nice.
“Look, Steve? Steve, I appreciate the gesture. Okay, that’s a complete lie,” Tony amended at Steve’s skeptical look. “I’m annoyed as hell, but whatever. You don’t want to do this, your loss, but whatever. Not really a big deal for me one way or the other, to be honest, except that Pepper, who is the one that really runs my life, is going to be pissed, and that along with basically having to swim to get to your shithole of an apartment? Steve, I have to tell you, that makes me not particularly pleased with the evening.”
“You don’t owe me—” Steve began.
“After the manager said he’d heard from Rhodes about making an arrangement,” Steve continued.  “I wasn’t sure if I wanted to at first, except I did kind of want to. I kept thinking about it. About you.  From Bagram, and then everything after. From—well. Let’s say I hadn’t been exactly an impartial observer of your career for a while.  I wanted to do it, even then. Probably not for exactly what Sam would say were the right reasons, but I did. And, now, I think maybe I want to for the right reasons. Not because I owe you.  I do, but not, ah. Not with this. I just thought it would be nice. Kind of—kind of an end to something. And a beginning of something else. I hope, anyway,” Steve added with a low shrug, mouth twisting with embarrassment.  Tony was watching him carefully, biting his lip. “You did say the uniform would look good on your floor,” he reminded Tony after Tony’s uncharacteristic silence continued.
He took the last few steps quickly, letting the surge of momentum carry him to the bedchamber’s door.  It will not be so bad, he told himself as he raised his fist to knock.  Lord Pierce—Alexander—is a good man, still handsome for his age, and this is nothing, really.  A simple act, over and done.   Perfunctory, his mind supplied, and he felt his gut twist.  He closed his eyes and drew in a breath that felt cold against his spine.  I can make it. You’ll see.  It’ll be fine.
“I’m done,” Steve said again, the words coming out flat and tired sounding, and he saw Tony flinch.   Steve let out a long, deep huff of air, and looked down at his feet where his toes dug into the blue mat.  He was in Tony’s house, using Tony’s gym, wearing clothes Tony had bought him and lashing out because Tony kept giving him things he didn’t want to need.  Truth was, he was using Tony just as much as Tony was using him and being pissed at Tony about circumstances beyond his control was not only unfair but using Tony in a way that Tony, of all people, didn’t deserve.
“It’s not a game of supersecret telephone.  Okay, it is.  Gross oversimplification, but anyway.  The telephone message, in this case, is a bit of technology called an arc reactor,” Tony said, seemingly apropos of nothing, his mouth flattening into a thin line.   It took a moment for Steve to catch up to what Tony was talking about, partly because he was just absurdly grateful they weren’t talking about Afghanistan anymore.  “My dad had the original idea.  Years ago.  Power source.  Very impractical at the time, though.  I’ve…made some modifications.  Think of it like…splitting the atom, let’s say.  Can do very good things with that kind of energy, and very, very bad things.   Guess which side of the coin they want it to land on?  I have the only functioning prototype in existence, and they want it, but it…it isn’t something they can just grab from the safe.  At the same time, killing me would, let’s just say, definitely put that bit of technology way too close to public for their comfort,” Tony responded after a beat of hesitation.
Two weeks since The Event.
“Fifteen,” Tony corrected.
“I can—whatever, I can—Steve, just tell me, please, please, I need—“ Tony stammered.  His stomach clenched.  He was doing something wrong.  He’d messed up.  Something.  Something wasn’t right, dammit, he’d screwed this up, somehow, though, God only knew how--
“You’re lying to yourself if you really believe that,” Bucky said.  And there was too much truth to that for it not to sting.  “You’re playing at dating this guy for Christ’s sake, but that’s not what this is, Steve.  Next thing you know, you’ll be going for long walks on the beach together.”
“Tony,” Steve said, reaching up to pinch the bridge of his nose.
“Alright.  Good,” Coulson replied carefully.  “I’ll just see myself out.”
“We’ll take that,” Tony said, taking a bag from Rhodey’s outstretched hand.
“I know,” Steve sighed.  “Go to sleep, Tony.” He ran a hand down the back of Tony’s head, earning a murmured hum, and a soft kiss to his shoulder before Tony shimmied closer to lay his head there, in the curve of Steve’s arm and drifted off to sleep.
“Which tells us that this black hole is significantly more massive than any other,” Tony finished triumphantly.   He didn’t quite do jazz-hands, but, under pain of death, he wouldn’t entirely swear he didn’t do them, either.
“I’m not saying a word,” Steve laughed, shaking his head and holding his hands out in front of him in a placating gesture.
, Steve had asked.
“Cam worries about a lot of things,” Tony replied. “I promised him a bird.”
The numbers, Steve thought.
“When I’m stripping?  Yeah,” Steve replied.  “I have to, I guess.  Just, let them have that.  That part.  That’s what they want, so, just let them have it,” Steve shrugged, feeling a fissure of disquiet run through him as they both fell silent and watched the world slowly circle past.  The pod’s sound system cycled through another Elvis ballad, though Steve recognized this one as ‘Love Me Tender,’ despite hearing only the first few chords.
He scrubbed his hands up and down rapidly over his face and let them fall to his sides. He hated this unbalanced feeling, this confused, unsure litany of questions that filled his head with static. He hated not knowing what to do, how he was supposed to act, what to expect. At least at home, he'd known the rules. He'd ignored a lot of them, fair point, but he'd
“Good. Good, Steve,” Tony soothed, bringing a hand to the back of Steve’s head to press it against his shoulder again. Steve’s body sagged in relief, muscles going languid beneath him as the tension seeped out. No wonder he’d woken feeling centered, Tony realized. His calculations had said they’d have a little more time before they reached this stage, but who the hell knew how the serum affected things? Which meant he needed to get up and get himself going so they could get to the island before Steve’s Heat really hit. And he was going to do that. Any minute now. Really.
That would have been wrong.  Huge invasion of privacy.  Probably illegal.  Definitely not something worth mentioning, that was for sure.
Discussions about what they could do quickly led to deeper, longer discussions about what they should do.  The Avengers may be Earths’ Mightiest Heroes, but Steve knew they couldn’t spread themselves too thin or get too involved in the political side (“You might have thought of that before dropping three Helicarriers into the Potomac.  Not very laissez faire of you,” Tony had reminded him.).  But it was hard to turn a blind eye to a world filled with people needing help.  It was Steve’s job to make those calls, but he valued Tony’s input, mainly because Tony didn’t pander to him, didn’t take what he said at face value just because he was Captain America.  Tony argued.  Tony shouted.  Tony made it hard.  But those choices should be hard, and Tony made him earn it every time.  He honestly didn’t know if he could do it without the certainty Tony gave him.
“Tony, I’m not you, but I’m not an idiot, either.  I know what the schematic for a missile casing looks like, and you had one sitting on your desk by the water bottle U grabbed,” Steve told him, making Tony blanch and nearly choke on his tortellacci.  “I know you think I’m pulling your leg, but I do actually have some inkling of what it’s like to be told you can’t do something you know you can do just fine if they’d give you a shot at it.  Or…well, maybe I couldn’t have done it just fine.  They were probably right, about me, at least, but I know how much I hated being told I couldn’t.  I also know how well I listened.”
Maybe Steve would like a nice differential equation.
“I have not lost all my hair, and I never had a sense of amusement,” Peran replied archly, face stiff.  He broke into a smile then, shaking his head.  “Go on with you, then. Don’t keep him waiting. He’s been in a mood all day, worrying about this one,” Peran finished in a gruff voice, jerking his thumb at Steve, though his eyes were bright with humor.
His eyes must have managed to convey something along those lines, because Tony grinned, dropped his hand and tipped his head back with a laugh.  He turned towards the inn, where the proprietor waited to greet him as he had every royal who had ever stayed there, kneeling down and offering Tony a tankard of ale and a plate of salted meat and bread, which Tony dutifully plucked a few bites from, took a drink, and proclaimed it a good place to rest for the night.  The crowd loved it, cheering loudly at each turn.  Steve heard an old man explain to the young boy with him that he had once watched the King’s father do the same, and then Cam was urging him along towards the door. He saw Tony look back over his shoulder once, then disappear inside the doorway.
.  Non-convulsive seizures.
“You flatter me overmuch, General Ross,” Tony was saying as he tipped his goblet towards the General. Steve’s gaze flicked over to Tony. He tried to rein in his wayward thoughts and focus on what Tony was saying.
“You would do that?” Steve asked, so astounded by the offer that everything else simply fled from his mind.
“Hey,” Steve started and then stopped because he really wasn’t sure what he wanted to say.  ‘Thanks for holding my hand’ seemed oddly intimate.  ‘Why did you run out’ probably too revealing.
“Retreat is often the better part of valor, they say,” Steve shouted at it. It ignored him.  “Yeah...well, I was never much good at that part myself,” Steve muttered, earning a huffing snort of apparent agreement from the creature.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, a yawn swallowing back the last part of the word.  “Bed was kind of lumpy,” he shrugged, reaching down to cup Tony’s cock in his hand.  He grinned up at Tony, who spluttered out a laugh and drew one leg up, rolling slightly to lean down and capture Steve’s mouth in a kiss.
“Thanks, man,” Rhodey said as he stuck out a hand to grab the plastic bags filled with hamburger buns and various condiments, paper plates and an industrial-sized bags of chips. One of Steve’s neighbors, or one of Tony’s tenants, depending on how you looked at things, had volunteered to make a run to the store when Pepper realized that Tony’s attempt at grilling lacked some key components.
“The car, it wasn’t a—what did you call it?  Guilt?  It wasn’t that,” Steve said.
“Really?  What’s for dinner?” Bruce called out.
“Your legs collapsed getting out of the car four minutes ago,” Steve reminded him.
Steve looked up to see Tony and Happy standing in library entrance, Tony’s face as mask of utter rage, eyes glittering, mouth a hard line.
“Well, he didn't really spend it. I got it all paid back eventually,” Steve replied with a tired, blank tone.
“Lots of people have it way worse.  I don’t know why I’m even…being like this,” Tony finished, scraping a hand roughly through his hair.
“I am,” Tony replied, fingers tapping on the edge of the chair. “You said you needed me for something.  That it was important.  So, here I am.  Ready to assist my friendly government spy agency in any way I feel like.”  Tony nudged the suitcase armor that was leaning against Fury’s desk with his foot, just to be sure Fury understood where he was coming from.
“Sugar Daddy’s here!” he heard Clint yell from his position on the sofa in front of what looked like Bachelor in Paradise, and Steve was rather appalled he knew that.  Bucky, sitting next to him on the sofa, cuffed the back of his head sharply.  “Ow!  Watch the hair, dude.  All I’m saying is that I end up with freaking Grandmother Willow, who, no seriously, get this, puts her teeth in a jar by the bed, and that one ditches his client, which usually earns a visit from the Not-So-Nice-Saint-Nick, and instead ends up with Romanov all gleeful, which is just plain scary and wrong, and Tony Stark’s driver picking him up.  Life is not fair.”
Good becomes great, Steve let out a sigh. What a crock of shit.
It was early afternoon, and the sun was glaring, impossibly bright, over the mountains.  Bulbous, slow-moving clouds dappled the landscape with shadows that clung to peaks and hillsides, and crept across the valley below, darkening large swaths of land before moving on and letting the light back in.
Shellhead hummed, low and trilling, then let out a huff of air, a soft, yet strangely sad, smile on his lips.
“You literally tripped over me this morning.  I’m living on your couch,” Steve reminded him.
“Yeah,” Steve said, though a frown had pulled a crease in his brow.  “Everything’s changed.  Feels that way, anyway.  Sometimes.  Everything’s changed, except me, I guess. I’m the one who still keeps looking for something familiar and getting disappointed when it isn’t there.  It’s better.  Now. All of this.  Of course, it is. A lot of it, anyway.  I know that.  So much has improved, sometimes, it’s hard to get my head around how far things have come.”
The room suddenly felt hot, stifling almost. Steve’s skin prickled.  His breath caught in his chest.  His heart pounded, so loudly, he was sure the King must hear it.  Pressure snapped low in his belly and surged down his cock.  His lips parted in a small gasp.  The King glanced up at him, nodded his head back and forth, mouth curling into the beginnings of a smirk that looked far too knowing.
“Of course, he does,” Tony nodded.  “Lists are good. Useful things, lists. Keep things organized.  This, in particular, is a good time for a list, since I’m literally asking for a list.”
Don’t waste it. Don’t waste your life, Tony reminded himself.  I’m trying, he thought, but God, does it always have to hurt so much? He lifted his eyes to Steve, trying to convey something of how sorry he was, how much he regretted everything that had happened, but Steve wasn’t even looking at him.  His eyes were darting around the room, looking at anything that wasn’t Tony. His jaw was working, like he was grinding down on whatever he wanted to say, gnashing the words between his teeth.
“Is that what we’re doing?  The best we can?” Steve barked at her, then slammed his mouth shut into a thin line.  “Sorry.  I didn’t mean—it isn’t you.”
Tony leaned down, breaking the invisible surface, and parted Steve’s lips with his own.  Steve’s mouth fell open with a soft, strangled moan, and Tony’s tongue swiped inside, hot and deep, pressing against Steve’s own.  Tony urged Steve’s mouth wider, and the kiss turned hot, insistent, Tony’s tongue plunging deep to explore, then drawing back and flicking the tip over Steve’s, teasing, licking and nipping along Steve’s lips, even tugging the bottom one between his teeth, sharp enough to sting. Steve groaned again, throat full of gravel, and craned his neck forward, straining his arms where the chain rattled against the loop on the headboard, keeping him in place.  Tony suckled lightly at Steve’s lip, almost as if in apology, then released it and huffed out a warm breath of laughter against Steve’s mouth.
Steve watched the two of them long enough to see the woman reach up and gently stroke the man’s cheek in a way that made something in Steve’s chest twist painfully, then he turned and headed for the door without looking back. He didn’t go directly back to the Tower. They were probably getting ready for the party, but if he went back right away, he had no idea how he would manage to be in the same room as Tony, let alone talk to him. Instead, he drove his bike aimlessly around the city for a while, until the sun went down and the lights came on, using the time to try to clear his head and think about what he wanted to say to Tony. Not just about what happened in the room, though he supposed he had to fess up to that in case someone did figure out who he was, but about everything.
“I like to tinker. A hobby,” Tony demurred.  Tinker, Steve thought, shaking his head. He wasn’t sure what it was that Tony did, but it could hardly be called tinkering, he knew that much.   “The Raj’Inama must put up with my occasional distractions, but you need not do so. I know the length of our visit is, regrettably, short,” Tony said smoothly, though Steve had little doubt that Tony would have happily spent weeks ‘tinkering’ with Lord Rand’s mining equipment, but not if it meant having to enjoy more of the Ridge’s hospitality. “Let us see this mine of yours, Lord Rand.  I haven’t visited since I was a boy, but I remember it being like nothing else I had ever seen.”
"Nine days," Bruce replied, and Steve could hear a lot left unsaid in those words.  "Steve, you and I both know the power of the serum.  Can you please try not test its limits again?”  Bruce asked, though there was a trace of what must have been true worry still tightening his voice.
could just take my car with me,” Tony threw back.  “Still think I’m just going to snap out of this or whatever’s going on up in that head of yours?”
“Um…” Yinsen frowned, speaking haltingly to the Omega until he started nodding his head in seeming understanding. “He...I believe there are some things--yes, some things he wants from inside the keep. Things he says belong to him.”
“I need to go,” Tony managed to husk out.  Move, he told himself.  Move. Why was it so hard?  He isn’t going to do anything (he could).  Just move.  We’re in public (we’ve been in public).  I can just scream (but then they’ll know).  Know what?  I shouldn’t be here.  Why did I stay?  Why did I tell him to stay?  I could’ve just told him to leave.  He offered.   I told him to stay.  I
“Slaves are always hungry,” Cam stated in the same matter-of-fact tone he used for hard truths that Steve didn’t care to hear.
A footnote. In a journal article from the sixties. Not even a peer-reviewed journal, just something that aspired to it. That was all he had been able to find. Doctor Simon Brewster, PhD, speculated that there could be an occurrence when a mate dies in utero, before the mark forms in whatever part of the DNA controls it, but after the bond develops, though Doctor Brewster carefully noted that he could find no record of such a thing actually happening. Maybe no one wanted to know about it. Why would you? It wasn’t something that could be cured. There were no colored ribbons, no fundraisers, no pink vacuums or catchy bumper stickers. What would be the point?
“Be right there, Maria,” Howard called out, his gaze sharp on Tony.  “Whatever it is you’re thinking, don’t.  That’s your problem, Tony.  Always trying to figure something out instead of just letting those who know better handle things.  Well.  Not this time, do you hear me?  We can’t lose this chance.  I know you’re thinking you can make the Captain change his mind.  And yeah, you could do that,” Howard said, voice low, like they were conspiring, like this was, in any way that mattered, a group effort.  “But, and you listen to me, boy.  There is no outcome here where you skip merrily home and go back to your little “inventions,’” Howard sneered, the way he seemed to have to in order to get the word out whenever he applied it to Tony.  “Your books and those online courses you think I don’t know about.”
“I’m not--he’s not--we broke up.  Well.  I broke up with him.  Broth,” Steve blinked, then let out a shaky laugh.  “
“Look,” Tony said, and pointed towards the window.
“Oh my God.  The gift certificate to go ATV-ing for my birthday,” Rhodey burst out suddenly, slamming his hands on the counter and spinning around to face Tony.  “You literally sent me to a place where I could go on an actual three-wheeler.”
“Gentlemen, if you wouldn’t mind,” the woman, whom Steve assumed was some kind of hotel manager, added with a sweep of her hand that clearly meant ‘Get the hell out of my lobby,’ though that thought was also conveyed fairly effectively by the uniformed security that dotted the way to the hotel exit, Steve noted.
“If I hear my familiar name on your tongue again, I’ll have it cut out,” Tony interrupted.  “I asked you a question,” he reminded her in a low voice.
“See?  You shouldn’t mock the badges,” Happy said.
“No shooting the other Avengers,” Steve admonished as he opened his book back to the page he’d been reading.
” the voice asked.  “
Maybe giving back the check had been a terrible idea, he sighed, slowing for a moment and running a hand through his hair.  There had been a time, during the early part of his Army days, when everything seemed so clear and easy.  Making decisions, even the hard ones, wasn’t something he struggled with, at least at first.  And then…
“Tony,” Jarvis said again.  “This doesn’t seem—“
“That’s it, Steve, that’s it, take it, take it Steve, take me, come on, just
The star was getting bigger now.  A big, bright, fast-moving dot. Two trains leaving the station. The thought had a strange, haphazard sort of familiarity to it, but he couldn’t place it.  He should probably get out of here, he realized as the star got closer. This could be dangerous. He should leave. He should go, but he couldn’t move, not just yet--God, he just needed a minute to catch his breath.  Just catch his breath. Just a minute. This is a very important minute, he thought.
“Everything’s put away,” Steve said from behind him, startling Tony from his reverie.  He switched the water off and darted a look over his shoulder.
“Well, in theory, anyway, portals, bridges, wormholes, whatever you want to call them, they aren’t really like roads, with people staying in their lane. They’re more like those revolving doors…once they start to move, they go in all directions at once,” Tony told him.  “You can go through, but anyone else can step on as it spins, and there’s nothing you can do to stop that without stopping the whole door.  But, problem.  Once its open, once its spinning and has people moving through it, that gets a lot harder to do.  A lot. You’re working against the movement—the energy—of the door, which is going and wants to keep right on going, because that’s what it does.  That’s all it does.  You can’t just wedge something in there and stop the energy. That would just stop the door from spinning, but it’s still open, see?  You’d have to—I don’t know—like, collapse it in on itself.  Basically, spin it so fast, it falls apart.”
“Depends on your definition of ‘okay,’” Steve admitted after a moment’s hesitation. Tony’s head whipped around in the darkness, trying to find the slightly darker spot that would define where Steve might be. There was something wrong about the pitch of Steve’s voice, like it had lost a bit of timbre, and Tony felt himself instantly go on alert.
“You got him a pony, didn’t you?” Steve asked with a sigh. He already knew the answer.
Almost thirty-six hours.  Thirty-six hours since he’d knelt in the sand, first and last time, he thought with a grudging surge of pride.  Knelt there in the liquid heat of it, in front of a path of bloody footprints the desert had already swallowed, and let Steve tell him it was going to be okay.  Thirty-six hours since he remembered what safe felt like.  Like Steve’s arms, strong enough to break, but always keeping him from breaking, the rough scrape of Kevlar, the smooth points of a star, he caught the edges of out of the corners of sweat-stung eyes.
He was not expecting Obadiah Stane to be sitting in one of the chairs in the small living area, sipping a goblet of wine and leafing through one of the old ledgers Tony had provided for Steve’s amusement.
“Well,” Tony croaked out, when he could finally make his mouth do more than gape open and closed like a fish.  “That’s one way of putting it.”
“Well,” Bruce started.  “This…it is pretty intense at the beginning, I know.”  Tony nodded vigorously in agreement.  “You do sort of get used to it, and the euphoric feeling you’re having will fade with time, though it is surprisingly easy to have that resurface.  And there will be times when you won’t feel it, and yes, you’re right, that…that can be devastating.”
“Hey!  Hello!” Tony called out again.  “Someone wanna---someone wanna tell me what the hell is going on!?!  Hello! Anyone out there? I’m kind of--I could use a bit of a--
“And I will love you with all of my being, forsaking all others. My hearth shall be your hearth.  My table shall be your table. The children of your name shall be the children of my name. I bind myself to you, in this life and the next.  So, as I say, it is done,” Tony repeated, his voice surprisingly full and steady.
“Well, other than picking me because of my stellar non-verbal communication skills, you have to have something in mind for SI, right?” Tony prodded.  “When Howard—Dad—retires or, I don’t know, loses the ability to speak in a tragic autoerotic asphyxiation experiment gone wildly, karmically wrong.”
“Just…” Tony began, sounding wrecked and out of breath, like he’d run laps. “Just stop speaking words.  Just stop.  I can’t… you…Jesus, Steve, you’re killing me, you are literally killing me.  I’m going to die right here and DUM-E can officiate my funeral and please don’t read that stupid poem about the clocks,” Tony choked out, resting his head against Steve’s chest and shaking it back and forth slowly.
“That was one time,” Tony barked accusingly.  “One time.  That thesis defense killed.  Fluidic Elastomer Actuators in Soft Robots?  Come on, how could I—okay, fine. No dance.”
, they’d said.
“Don't start on the Yoo-hoo's,” Steve warned, the corners of his mouth twitching up.
He doesn’t want to be alone, Tony realized, grasping at the insight like a lifeline.  That might be the only thing stronger than Steve’s worry that he’d be some kind of burden to Tony.  He’s kept me with him, all these years, Tony told himself. He won’t let me go now. He won’t.
“And what’s your new husband’s name, Mr. Stark?” the other investigator asked, turning around again in his chair to look at Tony.
Behind him, he heard the sucking whoosh of the doors opening, and turned, finding himself facing a tall man with shaggy blond hair in a white tuxedo jacket and black tie, holding an unlit cigarette in one hand.
“Called, wrote, sent smoke signals, had some carrier pigeons shit out a message on his car, you name it.  Guy is the worst building supe I’ve ever seen.  I have half a mind to get some guys from work to come out and take a look,” Bucky responded, frustration evident in his tone.
It didn’t really matter, Steve supposed.  What was done, was done, whatever his stupid scenarios he might fantasize about.  Besides, Steve was fairly sure he wouldn’t have left even if Tony told him the money was off the table.  Not that he was ever going to mention that to Brock. He should probably feel guilty about that, but every time his mind edged toward guilt, he just remembered something else about the night.  A flash of Tony’s eyes as he watched Steve in the helicopter.  Tony’s laugh.  The way his hands skimmed over Steve’s skin, reverent and carnal at the same time.  He’d wanted Tony, and it had been
“Tony,” Steve rasped out.  A wet cloth was wiping whatever lingering mess there was from his face, chest and hands.  It, too, felt glorious.  Everything felt better. Sharper.  Clearer, yet it managed to have a hazy depth to it as well, as if Steve could see a little
“We did,” Tony said.  “We figured out that you were going back in time to get the Tesseract.  Only one that made sense. Which meant, you didn’t have it, so you had to use something else. I had just figured out my tiny, little, miniscule palladium problem.  Issue. Whatever.”
“Oh, God,” Tony moaned.  “Oh, God. I’ve stepped through some time portal to 2005.  Why does the ringing in my ears sound like Coldplay?  Should I buy Pepper a shrug sweater?  How will I know I’m a good person without my LiveStrong bracelet?”  Tony groaned and covered his face with his hands.  “No Wi-Fi?  Seriously?”
“Tell me how you feel,” Steve said.
“Why would I make a suit of armor that couldn’t fly?” Tony shot back. “Wait, that’s
Tony led them down the path, which wound around the side of the mountain and then spiraled up to its modest peak. The forest dropped away, and the path took them out to a cliff that jutted from the peak and overlooked the city.
would be lucky to have you. But I need to know. Are there any more secrets? The suit, the… royalty… is there anything else?”
Steve found it odd that he called the queen by her first name, but he shook off the feeling of disquiet and laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “You made the right call, Nat,” he said. “Once we’re close enough, we can send out a transmission. Give them a warning.”
“How could you think that?” he asks, his voice wretched. “That I’d ignore you like that, that I wouldn’t— that I don’t—”
But not even the shame was enough to deter his libido.
That was right. There had been a battle, and Tony had no idea how long he’d been sleeping since then.
Tony did not say anything else, and before long, they had both been pulled in opposite directions – Steve to wrangle his crew, and Tony back to Rodos and a host of Stark tacticians. And Steve did not have a chance to speak with him again before their enemies were upon them.
“Well, the first thing you have to do is be brilliant,” said Tony. Peter was already uncuffing him.
“But a dating app? Surely you don’t need
Life on a ship was hard; life in transit, never anchored to anything, was hard. Tony had never complained, but looking around at all Tony had given up – from the material luxuries to the friends who were clearly worried sick about him – Steve could not imagine what his run-down little ship had to offer a man who could have all
“I trust you,” said Steve. An expression of surprise crossed Tony’s face before he got his features under control. “Where do
But Peatra said, fiercely, “
Steve sighed, hauled him to his feet, and guided him into an empty chair. The Stark looked around at him with a startled grin that swiftly turned into an appreciative once-over.
So when Jan asked, “Where to, Cap?” a month or so after their crew gained an extra member, Steve hardly had to think about his answer. It had been gnawing at the back of his mind for too long.
It’s a long time before they separate; at least, that’s how it feels. What finally forces them apart is the sound of the coffee mug falling off the couch and shattering.
Later came after Tony’s tearful reunions with Peatra, Jo, Rodos, and Hapi. Later came after Peatra initiated diplomatic contact with Kree leadership but told them, in no uncertain terms, that the identity of Iron Man would not be handed over for any price. Later came after a very strange dinner on the floor of Tony’s old workshop, the only place where they were certain not to be seen; Tony sat there, surrounded by his old family and his new one, and felt just about happier than he’d ever felt in his life. Later came after he’d loaded some of the things he’d had to leave behind when he’d first fled Stark onto the Nomad – his bots, some specialized tools, a few keepsakes, as many photos as he could get his hands on.
“Good?” Steve asked. “Ribs hurting?”
Steve tilted his head toward her. “You are, too,” he said.
“Sorry about that, Captain,” said Tony, abashed. “I misread the situation.”
They docked in Xandar’s spaceport without issue. As they unstrapped their seatbelts and headed to the open hatch, JARVIS deployed the ramp that would allow them to step off to the ground.
“More obvious than all that, even,” Natasha said pitilessly. “Don’t worry. Stark is even more blatant than you are. But he hasn’t made a move, either. Tell me why.”
Steve knew enough Xandarian to get by, and while he only understood about half of Tony’s response, he got the gist. Tony was vouching for his crew and offering their assistance to Xandar as friends and allies.
Steve shut his eyes, briefly. “When… when did he…?”
“You didn’t!” said Tony. He patted gingerly at his ribs, which Bruce had wrapped with compression bandages. “I stretched the wrong way, that’s all. I’m fine.”
Toni’il wasn’t meant for this life, cloistered away in a palace. He needed to be part of the world, really part of it: creating things, helping people, making the universe a better place. Peatra would take good care of Stark – the best care, in fact. But Toni’il had exhausted what challenges this tiny moon could offer him. He’d learned all he could learn here. It was time to move on.
something is wrong- and that’s a big if- taking off the suit could exacerbate it. I’d rather stay in one piece, at least ‘till we make it to the tower.”
… … … …
“Fine. Then at least let
The AI could not bring Happy a mirror- he did lack a physical body, after all. Still, Jarvis did one better. He pulled up the lab security feed. It materialized right above Tony’s face so he didn’t have to strain his eyes. How considerate.
“Wait, am I naked?”
Tony groaned, looking up to see Pepper and Natasha sitting at the island. Natasha had a mug in her hand- looked like she had just saved it from Tony. Pepper had a large brown patch of wet on her blouse. Looks like she

“Don’t even say Rogers.”
began to away, and it felt like any minute he would sink into the floor and cease to be.
… … … …
Steve shrugged, then winced. Must still be tender in spots. “You don’t have to do that, Tony. I don’t want you getting into trouble for me.”
Oh yeah, he'd been dying.
Stark Tower was the best place to deal with this problem. He’d take his private jet back, offering a ride to Steve and Natasha. And Sam whats-his-face. It would have been rude to leave the guy stranded in Italy, even if Tony still didn’t know quite how to feel about him. Besides, it’d be easier to get his hands all up in those wings with Sam nearby.
He left to go looking for a place called Stark, and for its prince.
Most of the crew had woken before him and were assembled at the table already. He managed to mumble something resembling a good morning and did not register whether or not they responded. It wasn’t until he’d drained half the mug that he noticed the looks on their faces.
“Maybe,” she said. “We’re working on it.”
Others in the lab were glancing furtively at Steve’s Mark. He saw the flicker of revulsion in their eyes when they processed its alien assortment of letters and sounds; some of them even frowned at him before he tugged on a shirt that covered it up. Steve focused his attention on the first doctor.
“It’s an impressive piece of machinery,” Steve said, diplomatically. “I admire it from— from a scientific perspective—”
“Because of your soulmate.”
“Sprung it on me?” Tony repeated, incredulous. “Steve. I took you star-gazing. I willingly help you
He’d docked the Nomad on Stark. He’d done the requisite restocking, maintenance checks, and fueling up the ship had needed. He’d made sure his crew was fed and watered and gave them free rein to go roaming about the city for a few hours. And he’d learned that his soulmate was dead.
“That’s been over for a while.” Tony smiles a little sadly.
small, and body-safe?” Peter asked, thrilled. The boy had his priorities in order, Tony thought.
“But it doesn’t matter,” Steve said into Tony’s neck as the water ran over them. “I can be with whoever I want, and he’s gone anyway.” He looked up at Tony from under his lashes, one of his hands stroking Tony’s jaw. “I would still want you. Either way. I can’t imagine not wanting you.”
Steve wasn’t going to die. That was ridiculous.  Steve was great at…whatever it was Steve did.  No need to panic.  No need to worry that he would end up with some old, balding geezer who smelled like Preparation H, popped little, blue pills, didn’t draw him robots and bought him nice watches.  Definitely no reason to panic.
Steve, and his box of memories, and his terrible life that he managed to be happy with, and didn't that fucking hurt like a sonofabitch? If Steve had wanted the money more than Tony, why so God-damned fine with how everything worked out? Why the gushing...pride—and God, did that not make sense, but there it was—pride over the Tower? None of it made sense. From the first moment he encountered Steve on the street, the whole thing had been wildly off-script, and no one, not Nat or Barnes or even Thor, seemed to be playing their parts.
“I’m really not,” Steve replied wearily.  “Please. I just need one set of plans. They’re not…anything you can use.  It’s for something that, uh, never even worked. I don’t want to—to make this more of a situation than it is.  But, I need those plans, Tony. I can’t leave here without them. Peggy will get them back to you when…when we don’t need them anymore, I’m sure.”
“Huh?” Tony said, pulling his head from his hand and blinking at Steve.
“Bet you’re going to tell me,” Steve replied tightly.
“Tony, you called me back to talk about a relationship website?” Steve asked.
He wasn’t going to say it, he really wasn’t.  He was going ask Bruce to pass the biryani.  It just came out, “Where’s Tony?”
Calm. Gentle. Good-natured.
“Yes, well, I’m often told I’m rather clever like that.  For a mere butler, of course,” Jarvis replied, with a slight shake of head and proud jut of his neck as he adjusted his perfectly straight tie.  “Until next time, then.”
now.  He didn’t need to do anything.  He didn’t need to think.  Tony would take him, use him, fill him up, and that was good, and he could just hover here.
“What the hell, Tony?” Rhodey demanded brusquely. Tony winced and drew the phone away from his ear. “You’ve got cops and Feds all over the hotel. I’m watching you perp walk out of the police station on repeat on CNN. They’re saying you tried to bribe Stern? Fox News has you selling weapons on the black market, and God that picture they’re using is the one from Bali in ’09.   You look like shit. They wheeled Stern out and put him in an ambulance, by the way. Got some paparazzi swearing you decked the guy. Now they’ve got ‘copters following it like he’s OJ.”
like you, have I told you that,” Tony said, shooting Steve a slightly bewildered smile.
“Let me know how the ride homes goes tonight,” Rhodey called out in a muffled, sleepy-sounding voice.
Could dark forces be harnessed for good? He didn’t know.  Such things were beyond his ken, though Steve doubted the old Reverend would think so, but then again, he hadn’t been quite the man of the cloth that he presented himself to be, had he?  Whatever was here--whoever was here--it almost mattered not to him, as long as he finally knew. If it be the Shadowman come to take him away now, at this late stage, so be it, he supposed.  He would almost welcome such a foe. Even if he fell, at least he would be doing something. It was better than the half-life he had been living.
“Ah, you know. We gotta…” Steve began, waving a hand up and down, apparently to indicate that the Army required him to look like patriotic spank bank material.  “But, you.  You, ah.  You look really great.   Color,” Steve said, blinking at him owlishly, a slow blush creeping across his cheeks.  “Color’s great on you. The blue.”
Tony nodded jerkily and walked over to the refrigerated storage unit on unsteady legs, though the floor beneath him had stopped shimmying as Clint leveled the jet out.  He punched in his code and leaned forward for the retinal scan.  Unless you lived on the Hellmouth, probably a bit more than your standard bloodbank security, but Tony had designed the system himself.  You didn’t just leave Steve’s blood sitting in the cooler, after all.  Steve’s blood, he thought, dully, looking over his shoulder at the pool of red under the medical table.  Someone had stepped in it where it puddled beneath the medical table.  There was a bloody shoe print off to one side, and another lighter one next to it.
“So,” Tony said, this time leaning far more carefully against the chair and looking down a few times with a blinking, wide-eyed glance just to be sure he wasn’t going to slip off again.  “Don’t you just look like a bad coping mechanism waiting to happen?”
a machine, Cap,” he said. “Doesn’t matter what it’s made of as long as it runs.” He turned to Peter. “You have something to write with? I can show you how I did it—”
“Just— just give me a second,” he said. He blinked dazedly at the ceiling, and then his eyes slid over to Steve – who still had a pair of fingers in his mouth, tasting of lube and Tony’s ass and Tony’s semen. “Damn, Steve.”
enjoyed the unibeam, that was for sure.
. “Oh, you’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” Tony growled.
Sure, Tony got that. After all, when you were friends with Tony Stark, being paralyzed from the waist down didn’t mean you couldn’t walk. You just needed some… help. “For being the head of security, you’re pretty bad at securitizing- shouldn’t you know who all is gone and who’s here?”
Steve surprised Tony by laughing. “I’m sure he’ll thank you for that.”
“And Romanoff! And, you know, their new friend.” Happy gave Tony a stern look. “Boss, it’s been almost two years. You were gonna have to deal with him sometime anyway. Besides, they’d know more than me or Pep how to get you put back together.”
It had been a mistake to say anything about that. “What I
Tony snorted. “What, did Captain Senile mistake me for a dead nazi?”
Tony had a smart remark already cocked and loaded- and then it hit him. “Ugh, of course! Jarvis, you can pilot the suit- why didn’t we think of that before?” The AI was quiet for a moment, and Tony prepared himself for the alien feeling of movement without his input. He waited thirty-four seconds, watching the HUD’s internal clock. Nothing happened. Twelve more seconds went by. A little warning flashed across the screen-
Tony ignored that. “Alright, now how tall is Pepper? Or Rhodey? Or the president?”
Tony huffed. “That’s exactly why we’re not going to tell them!” The other man stared at him in disbelief. What was he expecting Tony do? Grovel on the ground and beg his ex friends to help him out of a mess he’d gotten himself into? “I mean it, Happy, not a word! This is none of their business, alright? I’ll figure it out myself.”
Instead, he moped on the bed and watched the flickering lights of his HUD. Heart rate too low, water consumption too low, food consumption too low, organs beginning to suffer- he scoffed and turned to lay on his side. Of course the readings followed him. Each one reached out like a sharp accusation. You’re dying, you’re
Tony made a sound of disgust. “Goddammit- it’s me, dumbass. Code 2008, password keep a low profile, I swear to god if no one gets me off this
“Then tell them to stop worrying, I’m fine. In fact, I’m better than fine, I’m positively radiant! Tell him, Jarvis.” Jarvis chose to stay quiet. Traitor.
“Then you ripped one’a my wings off.”
Tony and the Secret Avengers head back to Stark Tower.
Recalescent light blinded Tony. The white pain exploded like a balloon full of ink, and Tony found himself painted head to toe in suffering. Something screeched in his ear, grating like nails and glass and knives
Tony could have grinned- a mean, sharp grin. “Hiya Pep! Howzit hangin’?”
Steve frowned then, shoulders tensed up. “If you’re bringing us back to turn us in…” Steve trailed off, giving Tony a hard look.
Pepper was quiet. Then, “Happy? Who is that?”
“Everything okay there, Hap?”
“Happy, I’m not going to embarrass you by answering that.” Tony sighed, looking up at the ceiling. “Jarvis, in all seriousness, could ya help me out here?”
Yeah, ‘cause that made Tony wanna leave the jet even more.
Tony gave Happy an expectant stare. Yeah, Happy, that look said, who is this? The head of security sighed. “That would be Tony, ma’am.”
that skin. Even so, Tony knew he was in trouble.
Jarvis said. He sounded neither apologetic nor tired.
been sleeping, hadn’t even felt tired.
Tony hummed in thought. “Sure. Yeah, go ahead and try.” Seventeen seconds went by. Tony felt the phantom of a frown on his mouthless face. “J? Everything all-” bright flashes of pain popped behind Tony’s eyes. He grunted, faintly aware of his body seizing up. The suit quivered on the ground, rattling like a dropped coin.
“No, don’t bother her. She’s got better things to do than come pick dad up off the floor.” Tony snorted, meaning to shake his head. Oh yeah, still paralyzed. “Besides, she’s off in Europe somewhere with Wanda. By the time she got here, we’d have already figured something else out.”
He would never admit how that steely gaze of hers made his skin crawl- at least, it usually did, when he could
“Jarvis!” Something in Tony’s chest burst. Relief flooded him like thick tar, coming so quick it almost hurt. He stopped trying to move. “Jarvis, something’s wrong. Where are the others?”
Jarvis cut in.
Tony wakes up alone in the lab after passing out. He and Happy soon discover what's happened to him.
help you.”
Despite the snark, the worry in Jarvis's tone was clear.
“No!” Happy sighed, pinching his nose. “Ugh, Jarvis? Any way you can get me a mirror?”
“Then ‘facially recognize’ my ass!”
Someone touched his shoulder. He
“Too late for that,” Tony said. It came out flatter than he meant, not in the joking tone he’d meant. He knew Steve had heard it too when the other man smiled sadly.
Happy sighed, nodding. “Sure, sure, fair enough point. Guess I just forget about, uh, all that, sometimes.”
With a scowl in his soul, if not on his face, Tony rolled his wrist and reached for the arc reactor. His hand hit a barrier. It wasn’t a solid line he couldn’t cross. Instead it felt more like the reactor was buried in thick sludge that he couldn’t push his hand through even with all the strength of the suit.
He looked at the feed- and didn’t speak.
“Tony, I would understand if you’re nervous around me.”
Nitinol rubbed against nitinol as Jarvis carried Tony to the elevator. It made Tony’s missing teeth itch. With every step, Sweetie-Pi’s chassis grated against Tony’s arm. A particularly loud scrape made Tony wince. “Yeouch, be careful! I can feel that, you know.”
Tony grunted as Happy rolled him onto his back. The world of grey whipped away to reveal- the lab ceiling? “Did you assholes toss me into the lab after I passed out?”
“Good job,
“Rhodey?”
“Little over twelve hours. Just a catnap, really.”
“Wait, Tony no- is that really what you think happened?”
Someone shouted. Tony was half sure it wasn’t him. And then the pain disappeared. Not all at once- more that it evaporated. Tony could almost see the white vapor rising from his body like steam from water. He panted, despite not having lungs.
Unfortunately, that hadn’t worked.
“Sam?”
for lack of a better word, in case his connection to Jarvis was interrupted. All he had to do was twist the rim of the arc reactor like a combination lock and boom, the suit would unfurl like a flower to bless the world once more with Tony’s visage.
Tony wished he could soothe that hurt away- and shook his head again, as if he could shake away his feelings. “I’ll tell them the truth. That it’s none of their damn business.”
Great, everyone was against him. Tony sighed. “Happy, who all has worn an Iron Man suit?”
“And now we’re here,” Sam finished, looking down. Tony followed his gaze to where Steve lay in a hospital bed, looking pitiful in his dotted gown and plethora of tubes. “He’s gonna be pissed you cut up his suit.”
Tony laughed. Happy gave him an incredulous look. “Alright, alright, this ain’t a petting zoo, Hap.”
Then,
If Pepper was surprised to see the ‘Secret Avengers,’ she didn’t let on. Much, anyway. Tony could see, even from the back of the line, how pleased she was to see Steve and Natasha again. Oh yeah.
Patatina means little potato in Italian. A couple searches around the web have told me this is a common term of endearment for children, and since it's so damn cute I had to use it. If you speak Italian and know this term is wrong, please correct me lol.
“But you know they would.”
He looked like the Captain America that had stood between Tony and the man who killed Maria Stark.
“No no! Patch her though, J! I got a few questions for her too!” Tony snapped.
” His limbs remained unmoved. “
Sam had eventually been forced to go back to his own room to sleep. Natasha, who’d come in somewhere around hour seven, had shared a few words with Tony before falling asleep in the chair Sam had vacated. Tony wasn’t tired. He also wasn’t sitting- the hospital chairs wouldn’t be able to hold the suits weight. So Tony leaned against the wall, monitoring Steve’s vitals.
Tony yelped as he fell through the floor like a hot knife through a pat of butter.
Besides. At least in the suit, Tony wouldn’t have to look Steve in the eye. Not really.
The other man frowned, but pulled back, sitting heavily on the concrete floor next to Tony. “Please let me call Rogers.”
“Tony? Are you alright? Or did Miller hurt you?”
He shot up from his pavement crater, head on swivel. There! A crowd of people surrounded Steve, gawking, crying. Tony hurried towards them. “
“And how tall am I?”
“The key word there being
“No!” Tony sighed. “We can figure this out without him. Come on, I’m a genius, I’ve got this.”
,” Tony groaned. His other hand was still busy with Tony’s balls, weighing them in his palm, squeezing them, pulling back to stroke the soft, wrinkled skin with the pads of his fingers.
None of the crew seemed particularly impressed by the fact that he’d been a king, which was a relief. The only time anyone had come close to bringing it up was when, the night before they were due to take off, Steve had said: “You know, Tony, if, um, if you decided you wanted to stay behind, we’d understand.”
“Rat? That’s harsh,” he said. “Just think of me as… a souvenir. A very shiny, very pretty souvenir from the greatest moon in the galaxy.”
“As soon as I found out about your… your Mark,” said Tony, “I was going to tell you who I was. I didn’t know about soulmates. But I knew that— that I wanted to be yours. I just didn’t have
probably our closest extraterrestrial cousins in terms of biological makeup,” said Bruce. The Stark lit up.
There were no such restrictions on Steve. He could have slept in the lavish room Peatra had opened up for him. The room contained a plush bed with a mountain of pillows, his own bathroom made up of flawless white marble and featuring a shower big enough for five Steves to share, and a massive window that looked out on the city.
“We are.”
His fingers dipped under Tony’s waistband.
The merchant shrugged. “There’s no law against ignorance. Besides, Queen Peatra has bigger things on her mind today. We all do.”
“A lot of ships don’t even
“If we can find the parts we need right away, a few hours,” Peter said.
, Steve recognized in his speech, too.
Steve barely remembered returning to the ship, collapsing onto his bed, and putting his head in his hands. He’d sat like that for far too long, spine curled in an arc of pure misery, before he made himself lie down and take a nap. He’d woken perhaps an hour later, feeling no better, and hadn’t moved.
Steve snorted.
Okay. There was a tiny bit of jealousy.
“Back early,” Tony says. “I guess it went well?”
The dome opened, just as it had when they’d steered the Nomad down into Xandar for the first time. It was automatic, set to part every few minutes and remain open for several more, unless the control center went into lockdown. The view from
“Why do all of you hate Centuri-Six?” he asked.
“Why did you bring us back to Andromeda?” he asked, a tremor in his voice. Andromeda was Tony’s home galaxy; it was where Stark was located.
“I know they’re trying to kill us,” said Tony, “but you have to give them points for style.”
But he wasn’t cold: he was in a real bed with nice clean sheets in a temperature-controlled room.
And Steve had said: “Of course not! I just wondered if
“Oh?” Steve had asked. “Trouble at the palace?”
“Right.”
“I’m not sore,” Tony said. “I want you to fuck me. Come on, Captain. Show me what you’ve got.”
