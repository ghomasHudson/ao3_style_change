Steve's eyes widened. "What? No! I'm just-"
"Turn off the monitors!"
"You're right," Steve replied with a sigh, "I've gotta talk to him anyway. We're going to make sure you can cheer again."
The intern quickly pulled away, realizing he was still at work, still being a doctor,
"Go fix it. Whatever it is with Sharon, you better fix it." Natasha folded her arms.
Steve entered quickly, shutting the door behind him. He smiled to see that the table had bed sheets over it, and plastic cutlery surrounded the plates of hospital cafeteria food. There were two plastic cups with grape juice, and a pen light stood as their makeshift candle.
Pepper stood up, silently putting on her scrubs and adjusting her lab coat. She hated how heavy the tears in her eyes were; she felt like a goddamn fool.
More awkward silence hung in the air. There were about a million things that Tony desperately wanted to say, wanted to scream, wanted to bellow at the top of his lungs—
"I don't get what you want from me!" Sharon exclaimed. "You want us to be there for you, but then lash out when I try to see if you're okay? That's some high school shit, Rogers. I don't have time for that. Let me be your friend or leave me alone."
Out of the corner his eye, Steve could have sworn he saw the doctor pausing before carrying on with her exam. She hushed everyone as she waited to hear a heartbeat from the pregnant woman's abdomen. A weak, slowing heartbeat echoed through the trauma room.
"I'm just excited for surgery, that's all." Tony winked, laughing when Rhodey rolled his eyes this time.
Cheeseburger meowed loudly, pawing at Steve's ankles. The soldier picked up the kitten and cooed. "I missed you, too! Looks like Tony played nice after all."
"You asked me if I loved you." Tony sighed. "Did you get the note?"
Steve shrugged and continued his scrubbing. Tony nudged him a little and grinned.
As he stepped into the elevator, Tony joined him as well. Immediately a smirk grew on Tony's face, and it was just so goddamn enticing, Steve had to force himself to stare at the flyers on the walls.
The engineer tried to get to the bathroom as quickly as his could, forcing his muscles to push despite the fact that he was aching like hell. Just as Tony turned on the faucet to flush his face with cold water, a familiar blond stood behind him, arms crossed again.
“That’s not what I meant.” Tony felt so damn sleepy, and the world was beginning to fade again. The intern looked puzzled, and Tony couldn’t help but smile and reach out to him. He swore he was touching Steve’s face before he finally fell asleep again.
Whatever. They'd only been together for just a few months. They were just dating, and it wasn't like Tony was his boyfriend or anything. At least, Tony hadn't mentioned anything, so, it was nothing.
James rolled his eyes again and chuckled. "Alright, let's go make sure none of the interns killed anyone just yet."
A cutesy, secret note would have made him happy; coming back to his locker at the end of the day and knowing that Tony had been thinking about him would have made him feel better. Any fatigue from that day, any losses that day, anything that would have brought him down would have melted away, knowing that he would be seeing Tony and teasing him about his God awful handwriting.
Tony downed his scotch and returned to the drink cart.
"No promises."
Steve was adorable. Well, he was more than adorable—last night proved that—but there was just something about him that intrigued Tony. He barely knew the man, but still, he felt something stirring whenever he knew the intern would be around. He seemed kind, and the way Katie had been babbling about him confirmed that, too.
The sunny expression on Tony’s face faded as Bucky approached the station with lab results from one of their patients. The soldier was one of the poor souls assigned to neurosurgery that week, and he absolutely dreaded making conversation with the man.
Mr. Bautista shook hands with Steve, grinning with pride. "
Natasha slumped down beside him. "Was it good? Was he hot?"
"Because I don't want to be your friend."
Tony would chuckle as he saw interns and residents passed out in the hallways, desperately trying to catch up on sleep before waking up and reporting to their superiors the next day. He did not miss the tireless hours he worked before becoming an attending; the thought alone made him yawn.
Sharon snickered. "It's eleven a.m. What happened to you?"
Steve sighed. "Can we skip the party now that you and Nat made up?"
Alex smiled. "Thank you."
“What the hell is your problem?” Steve growled. “This is a party, Tony!”
“Did you hide all the coffee?!”
"I need to see the competition," Katie insisted, "I need you to help me work these damn TVs."
(See the end of the chapter for
As he wandered the store, he encountered Bucky and Nat. The pair were giggling softly to each other, hushed and adorable. God, it was almost too cute to look at them; they were bonding in the goddamn soup aisle. He hated the twinge of melancholy he felt as he watched them. They were in their own little world—just the two of them.
She nodded. “Fair enough, Rogers. Let’s get back to the pit before the nurses eat Bucky alive.”
"Steven." Her voice was firm. "Are you okay?"
Steve felt like running out the door. He didn't want to hear this, not right now, not with Tony looking perfect and being sentimental and sweet. No matter what he felt, his feet were glued to the floor.
“Yeah, I remember.” He’s grumbling, but seeing Steve grinning so widely like that, he doesn’t stand a chance. He’d do just about anything for that boy.
she thought to herself.
"Let me get my laptop from my locker. We can stream some movies and stuff," Steve said with a smile. "Maybe I'll rent a movie online for you. My treat."
"I was never going to tell anyone." Bucky blinked in surprise. "Why would any of the guys care?"
Nat and Sharon stood beside Bucky; Nat let herself lean against him just a little. Sharon squeezed his hand. "You did everything you could. Don't keep thinking about it."
Bucky stepped forward. "Tommy Evans, eight, born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Corrective surgery had been done when he was an infant, but he's back because of some fluid build up around his heart and arrhythmias."
"He's your ex," Eva said simply, "and I'm the one you're with now. That's why he was being an ass."
She was also hoping that it was helping Steve move on. She felt a little guilty about it, but she was sick of the friendly coffee her husband was getting every damn day.
much better than what he had going in New York.
"Give him time," Steve repeated, "and a little extra love."
She placed the ring in the palm of his hand and closed it. "It wouldn't be fair of me to keep your mother's ring. It's time I give it back to you."
Steve was lucky to get such a nice apartment. It was a lot of space for one person with no roommates. It was a great apartment, but right now, it was
"I just want you to feel better."
"If we're just waiting for a transplant...is there really anything else we can do?"
"I missed you," Steve breathed between kisses, "I had a long day..."
"I'm sorry. Can you just hear me out?" Steve leaned on her a little. "I'm sorry I was such a jackass today and in the ER. I'm just freaked out already because of Tony, and then I overheard a phone call that made it worse."
"Steve, wait."
intern in particular on their knees, actually." Tony laughed again when he saw that Steve had reddened in about three seconds. "Rogers, I'm kidding."
Steve raised his brows and laughed in disbelief. "Seriously?"
to do one, Steve," Sharon snapped. "if he doesn't get this chest tube he's gonna stop breathing really fast."
"You said
The winds and rain outside were loud enough to be heard within the walls of the hospital. Some of the patients and their families were cautious, as if the building was ready to be blown away at any second.
Steve examined her arms and chest, noticing that her IV and wires were disconnected. He sighed in irritation, reconnecting them. He felt like strangling her, but he held his tongue. "Why did you page 911? Do you know what that means? I thought you were dying all alone in here. 911 is for emergencies."
Tony crossed his arms, biting his lips to stop his laughter. He knew he'd get a rise out of Steve for ganging up on him with his mother, but he did not want to miss out on this. Not with the flustered expression and the pink that Steve wore so well on his cheeks.
Steve rolled his eyes. "Ma, I'm sorry. I'm here now, right? Your favorite son, who could have gone home right after his shift, came up to say hi."
"She has a subdural hematoma," Tony explained, "And you're going to scrub in with me. Nice work, Dr. Rogers. You saved this girl's life."
The intern returned to the party, which seemed to have dwindled quite a bit since the remaining residents and attendings were called back into work. He noticed that his friends were also gone, a curse of being a surgical intern—one night off is never truly a night off. The only person left from his group was Eva, somber and looking lonely amid the doctors and staff she did not know.
"Dr. Blondie. Saving me every time," She said softly. She peered behind him, noticing the other interns who looked both terrified but amazed. "Hey. You brought a whole gang with you."
He was speechless, so shaken, that he could barely register Pepper kissing him once more on the cheek and leaving the lounge. It was so odd, seeing the ring he had given her years ago, promising her his life. He expected to feel free, happier.
“I found my inspiration.”
Steve leaned over and pressed a kiss to his cheek. "God, you're such a sap when you're sick."
"Do you love her?" Steve asked quietly.
Geez. He was just a kid playing dress up. He should not be allowed to do this. Steve let his eyes close for just a moment. Just as his own heart rate settled down, there was a gentle knock on the door.
“Shut up, Rogers. I know you love me.”
fucking evening. He immediately grabbed himself a scotch and stayed at a corner table, away from the bustle of the party.
He wanders the halls a little, eventually finding the source of the melodies. The brunet sitting on the bench is so absorbed into the music, and again, Steve finds himself smiling in adoration of this mystery pianist.
She gazed up at him, eyes so blue, eyes so lovely. The sound of her voice, hushed and quiet enough just for him made Tony nostalgic. It wasn't too long ago where he'd yearn for her voice at the end of a long day. She placed her arms around his waist, her body now pressed right against his. Tony felt dizzy.
with him, but it was so damn complicated. Out of all the hospitals in the city, Tony had to work at the same one as him.
"... you had your reasons, I had mine...this is my choice...I'm
The intern nodded quickly, drying off his hands before running off to the neuro ICU to check on Katie. The teenager was just waking up from anesthetics, and she smiled affectionately when she saw Steve.
"Say, let's go harass some interns," Tony said quickly, "it's been a while since we tortured some newbies together."
Once the meeting ended, doctors returned to their respective floors. Tony waited for a few minutes before he was greeted by Dr. Rhodes.
"Buck, look." Steve shined the light on her eyes again. The soldier looked grim. "I think she's—
"We should get back." Eva stood up and grabbed her purse. "I've got that flight back to Hartford, remember?"
He didn't mean for his words to come out so harshly, and there was a pang of guilt when he saw the tears in Pepper's eyes. There was a moment in time, seemingly a lifetime ago, where he'd hold her and apologize for what he said. But that was a lifetime ago in New York, when they were younger, happier. All he could do was give a curt nod before driving off to the hospital.
Yeah. He was a bit of a nerd.
"Steve." Tony's voice was so broken. "Just stay, please?"
Tony Stark could be one hell of a brat when he was crabby. While the neurosurgeon was known for his usual charm and dazzling smile, the finalization of the divorce left his temperature incredibly short. The charm he could muster was always reserved for his patients no matter how horrible his mood was; very little patience was reserved for his residents and interns. The only intern Tony seemed to cut slack for was a particular blond. This did not go unnoticed—at least, everyone else noticed but Steve.
Steve laughs heartily, and the sweet sound warms Tony’s heart. The way Steve’s nose crinkles, the way his eyes shine after Tony says something silly and stupid like that,
Up until the last hour of his shift, everything was running smoothly. All the babies were updated on their charts and medications were made, and Steve was just about ready to update the night nurses about his patients when Andy's vitals tanked.
"She was fine," Steve repeated, "She was just fine! I checked on her, God, I don't know, fifteen minutes ago? Dr. Potts—"
Eva raised her eyebrows and bit her lip, hoping to stifle her laugh. "Um, thank you, Steve."
There was a bit of comfort in having people who didn't judge him right away. Ever since he had come out in high school, there was always a bit of judgement, especially among his male friends. Whether it was deliberate or an unconscious decision, it still stung. Sure, coming out got easier as he grew up, but it was nice to have friends who immediately accepted him.
Tony held his tongue on the car ride to the vet. He wanted to be annoyed, but that effort was pointless by now. He would do anything for the kid, and honestly, seeing Steve baby the kitten made his heart swell. Maybe it'll be fun having a pet. As long as it doesn't piss everywhere or scratch up the hardwood floors, they'd be good to go.
A hot stranger. An extremely hot stranger, who was so far out of his league and someone he'd never see again. Last night was still foggy, but he'd be lying if he told himself he wasn't curious to see what another night with the man would entail.
when Pepper did this. The small talk thing, trying to act as if absolutely nothing had happened. Maybe it was intentional, maybe it wasn't, but it was still annoying.
much. Tony takes a deep breath. His face falls to see blue eyes blinking rapidly and shining with tears.  “Oh, Steve, don’t cry, I—”
He knew that the divorce was coming. Since the overnight shift and his encounter with Tony, he knew that the divorce was happening. Truthfully, Steve was surprised at how anyone else in the hospital found out. Ever since he had spoken with the neurosurgeon, he decided to keep quiet. The other interns were oblivious until they heard the rumor from another intern under Pepper’s service. Everyone knew that the end was coming, even Steve. Still, there was something so startling to see Pepper’s name on the OR board, seeing her name without the Stark at the end.
Steve knelt down and held her hands. "You need your rest so you can be there for your baby when it counts, okay? She's alright for now. I won't let her out of my sight, and when I need to go home, I'll ask the nurses to page me too."
i'm sorry for a bit of a delay. school's been kicking my butt—more to come this winter break! :D
"You know each other, how lovely! My Stevie just finished his first shift here. I was just waiting to hear all about it," Sarah replied.
It was Tony's turn to get a little red this time. "Unless you totally hate the idea. Which I get it, it might have just been a fling to you—"
The cardiothoracic surgeon tried not to show it, but she was ecstatic that her patient received a heart. Her eyes lit up when the brand new heart beat inside Tommy's chest. Bucky felt sick, knowing that the heart inside that chest belonged to a little girl who was playing with dolls just this morning. Kissing her parents goodbye before school. Seeing them right after soccer practice. Crying out for her mom before she died.
, not Dr. Calvin Klein.
Steve laughed. "You guys can keep calling me Steve, it's okay."
“I don’t even know why you’d bring her here anyway,” Tony continued, slurring on every word, “this is for staff only. Is she staff? No. But somehow she’s here, just like she’s always here bringing you coffee or food—“
“Listen—“
"Hey, it's okay."
Dr. Stark had been trained to steer from the whole truth. They weren't supposed to lie to their patients, but sometimes, bending the truth turned out better for their recovery. Omitting certain details also proved to keep families sane, too. Parents worried less about their children, letting the surgeons focus during procedures rather than having to update them frequently during surgery. Patients had quicker, better recoveries instead of coming back due to complications. It wasn't full on
"I want to be friends," Steve whispered, "But I don't think that's a good idea."
"Can you listen to me while I'm trying to be sentimental and make you feel better? Please?"
“I want to. I miss you, Steve.”
Tony found his focus. "Because I'm still in—"
Steve likes to stay up long enough to see Tony fall asleep, watching his chest gently rise and fall. He never minds the wait, he never minds staying up late and watching Tony tinker away in the lab. Seeing Tony next to him like this—he doesn’t mind losing a few hours of sleep.
Bucky sighed. "I know. I just feel weird. I don't know."
"Hope everyone's all caught up on their appendectomy procedures," Natasha added nonchalantly.
And so the blonde reluctantly follows his favorite coffee addict into the kitchen, giggling as he reveals the secret stashes of coffee. Steve really isn’t a coffee drinker, but as he watches Tony, with disheveled hair and and beaming over a fresh cup, well, he can’t help return the grin.
Steve Rogers had graduated from the top of his class. Shadowing medical professionals and doctors since he was a teenager. Excellent grades, a fine student. Plenty of research conducted in both in undergrad and graduate careers. Medicine had become part of him. He didn't like to boast, but he was good. He was focused. He was
Steve emerged from the shadows of the kitchen, nearly startling the daylights of his husband and the distraught teenager. He held two mugs of steaming hot cocoa and handed them off.
He had made up his mind the night he kissed him; no matter what he felt for the neurosurgeon, it was over. Until that pretty ring was permanently off Pepper's finger, Steve was done. No more moping about Tony, no more dreaming of his cologne, no more staring from nurses' stations or through the OR galleries.
"Ew, Barnes, get your coat in laundry!" The redhead shoved him a bit. The soldier nearly fell off the gurney, much to the others' amusement. Bucky shrugged off the lab coat and threw it on the floor, groaning tiredly as he returned to the gurney.
Eva was pretty. Tony decided that after yet another cup of the fruity cocktail that the hospital was serving. She was pretty, the kind of pretty that Steve deserved. He probably would have dated a girl like her in college, for a little while at least.
Steve choked on his sandwich. "You told
Tony held his hand out, revealing the missing ring. "Pepper gave me this today."
She quickly brought smiles to whatever group of people Steve had introduced her to—not that he was surprised or anything. Eva could always fit in easily among different people without any brief moments of awkwardness or silence. It was always the opposite for Steve—he always needed a bit of a push. She was the people person between them. Nonetheless, he liked that she brought him out of his shell a little.
Joe obliged at first, but after several shots, he noticed the soon-to-be intern needed to be cut off. Steve downed the last shot and hissed as the tequila burned his throat. He smiled sleepily at the bartender, holding up his glass.
Their relationship confused the hell out of the interns. Their jaws dropped upon seeing Steve and Tony chatting away at the nurses' station. It wasn’t one of those moments where they were forced to be polite to each other; the pair seemed engaged in a friendly conversation.
"I think Katie burst an aneurysm," Steve said calmly, "She said that she fell a while ago. She might be bleeding into her brain."
"You're sixteen. Be good and boring now so you can be not good and not boring when you're older."
Peter eventually left the tower to get to band practice, bidding Tony and Steve goodbye. The blond eventually made his way to the kitchen, with Cheeseburger on his heels, eagerly waiting to play some more. Tony followed suit, wrapping his arms around his husband's waist. The kitten mewed jealously, pawing at Tony's ankles to get some attention from the super soldier.
Steve bid goodbye to the rest of the interns, but he wasn't leaving the hospital just yet. He made his way to the labor and delivery unit, where a very exhausted nurse was waiting for him. The woman's eyes widened when she saw the blond coming toward her, and she opened her arms wide.
Sharon stood frozen in her stance as another resident wheeled Jackson away to the OR. Steve walked over to her, putting a hand on her shoulder.
Steve tried to keep a straight face. One early morning, before Bucky arrived in the locker room, he had overheard the girls talking about the soldier and his inability to "make a move." They immediately hushed when Steve walked over to their lockers, and instead smiled on and gossiped about the nurses instead. So yeah, he knew, but he wasn't going to make it easy for Bucky.
Eva smiled once more. "It's good to see you, Steve. You look good."
“I’m sorry?”
Steve sat down on the hospital bed, trying not to focus on the smell of Tony's cologne as he sat down beside him. He unwrapped the present carefully and found a picture frame inside the box. The photo inside was a brain scan, one he hadn't seen in many months. Steve instantly recognized the photo—the scan of the subarachnoid hemorrhage that he diagnosed on his first day.
“Mornin’.”
"You're too big for this couch. Sure you're comfortable?"
"Anyway, I'm gonna get back to charting." Steve fumbled around with a pen. "Listen—"
His life was so different compared to Steve's. Tony had no problem going to school or affording to stay in a home, and he definitely had his pick of whatever school or program he wanted to get into. Tony knew he was privileged; hearing about Steve and his success only made him grow fonder. Steve had fought for everything he had in his life; he was a good man.
Saving lives. Actual, human,
"I heard you the first time, now leave."
“FRIDAY, do you have any secret stashes of coffee?”
"Thanks again, Rogers. He's still recovering in his room," Dr. Rhodes said, "scotch is one hell of a drink."
The neurosurgeon frowned. "Can you listen for once? Didn't you hear me? Pepper and I are over. Steve, I want to be with you."
Steve sighed. "Tony—Dr. Stark—you just...you make me nervous, okay?"
"Spent a lot of time around babies. My mom works in labor and delivery." Steve took the charts and updated them with the baby's vitals for that morning. He hoped that Pepper would take the hint and just leave, but that wasn't the case.
Steve wanted to say. Still, he let Wilson yell at him. He wasn't trying to get his ass kicked right now. An ass-kicking from Samuel Wilson on the first day did not seem pleasant in the slightest.
Steve’s leaning against him in the truck, nuzzling his face against his neck. It was the last day of summer, and Steve insisted they went to the drive in theater before Tony left for school.
For a few minutes, there was silence. Steve immediately wanted to take back what he said; he felt his heart racing and his hands getting clammy. He felt like a fool in the seconds, minutes, and what felt like hours for Tony to respond.
"Then leave."
"You're lost."
Sharon didn’t miss the beat of silence nor the attempt to get back to work. She gave him a knowing look. “You miss him.”
Bucky and Natasha were sent to run labs some of Pepper's patients, so Sharon and Steve were left in the NICU together. The baby that Steve was taking care of was tiny, born at twenty-five weeks. The little girl's eyes weren't even open, but somehow, the child gripped Steve's finger while he gave her an exam.
After throwing some cold water on his face and pulling himself together again, Steve went back to the labor and delivery unit to find the other interns. They must have been ordered to do other tasks by residents because when Steve returned to the station, they were no longer there. Steve updated the nurses to page some of the other interns in case Dr. Potts-Stark needed anything.
There was a tired look on her face for a moment, and her eyes fluttered to a close. Immediately, her body shook violently.
“Can’t stay here. Pretty boy like you would be
Sharon waited a few moments after Steve slipped out of the ER before creeping behind the nurses station to see if anyone met Steve out in the hallway. As if on cue, a grumpy divorcé joined her friend, already wearing a smile despite coming fresh out of a long surgery. Sharon could barely stop herself from gasping, and the sound was loud enough to wake the slumbering soldier laying next to her.
Steve pursed his lips. "I...I gotta go. I'm going to update Alex."
don't tell anyone, especially not the other guys around here. It's the first day and I don't want anyone else finding out. Especially Wilson. Not only would he tear me a new asshole, he'll find twenty different ways to torture me."
“Penny for your thoughts.”
“Buck, we all had dinner with Eva the other night!” Steve exclaimed. “And she’s coming to the hospital holiday party this weekend. I am very much still with Eva.”
Steve took a breath, praying he wouldn't vomit right in front of the chief resident. "Clear!"
"She's doing great so far," Steve reassured her, "I can see if another doctor can come down and talk to you later tonight."
"And did you love me?" Steve paused for a moment. "You don't have to answer that right away. I know it's complicated."
The blond smirked. "I bet it wasn't the only thing you noticed in the locker room."
"For last night," Steve replied, "and leaving you again so soon today."
Steve looks up and smiles, eyes level with Tony’s now. “Just making sure I get what I want.”
"No. Howard didn't like pets. My mom always fed one of the stray cats that came by our apartment every once in a while."
“You are so not fine,” Rhodey muttered under his breath. “
The soldier stood up and went to his locker, changing back into street clothing. The girls returned soon after, updating them about Tommy's surgery. His stats immediately improved once he was back in the room.
“You need to get up and just go out,” Rhodey pleaded, “they probably have scotch at the party.”
"I can see that."
"Dinner and
a lot. Like you said a while back, this isn't a fling. This isn't just a short-term thing for me." There was a beat of silence as Steve mustered up the courage to keep going. "I'm in this for real, i-if you want me to be."
They weren’t friends exactly—that clearly didn’t work the first time—but they weren’t
He grinned, and he texted back right away, saying that he'd be on his way there. First, he chased down Bucky, throwing him a spare set of keys so he could get into the apartment. The soldier promised that he'd take care of the apartment until Steve got there and reminded him not to be late. Then, he made his way to find Tony.
Now that he was panicking and running out of time, it was almost on cue as Tony gently knocked on the door. Steve cursed under his breath and tried to get whatever trash that was laying around out of sight. He took some of his clothes that were laying on the couch from earlier this morning and threw them into his room before running to answer the door.
"Stevie, honey, have you met Dr. Stark?" Sarah could barely hold back her smile. "I have a mother-to-be with some head trauma after a car accident, Dr. Stark just took the best care of her after craniotomy last night."
"It was right under your nose the whole time, Stevie."
"Even though I love your babbling, I was wondering if I could treat you to breakfast." Tony chuckled into the phone a little at the silence on the other end. "Before you faint, let me tell you that I'm an amazing cook, I will not be reaching into your pants, and I'll even settle for just a sweet kiss on the cheek once I leave."
fucked."
Seconds, minutes, hours, days,
Steve is far too occupied in finding the sweet spot on Tony’s neck to notice that Tony’s fingers are in his hair; his determination ends in success when he hears the brunet sighing in content to the kisses on his neck.
"Dr. Wilson hasn't slept in two days, so this is our present," Sharon explained, "and your distraction for the day."
The tunnel was silent for just a few moments until the inevitable rouge spread across Steve's neck and cheeks. They groaned in exasperation.
The holiday season wasn’t exactly as exciting when divorce papers show up on your front door. Merry fucking Christmas.
The tiny kitten mewed angrily upon seeing Tony putting his shoes on and grabbing his keys. Cheeseburger stood in front of the doorway in an attempt to keep the engineer home.
Her eyes were open. She was talking. The monitors behind her were going off like crazy, reading that she was dead, but here she was, speaking and breathing and living.
"Did you end up catching the surgery?"
"You're quite the superstar in this part of the city," Tony teased, "it's adorable."
"Something wrong?"
Pepper carefully let her fingers intertwine with Tony's, trying not to smile as his fingers immediately curled around her hand.
Tony thought to himself.
Steve immediately felt his face get hot and laughed nervously in response. "I think I'll take it easy this time. Can I have a beer?"
to bed—"
“You’re always up getting coffee so damn early in the mornings! I just wanted you to stay with me.”
Bucky and Natasha were covering neurosurgery afternoon, and Steve and Sharon were called down to the pit. The work in the pit was not particularly interesting that day—minor procedures and diagnostic scans kept the duo occupied. Their system of keeping the ER from overflowing with patients worked well for several hours until there was an abnormality in one of the CT scans. Sharon noticed her friend staring too long at one of the scans and joined him. She frowned when she took note of the abnormality.
boring."
"Because these babies are brand new, with brand new hearts that could get sick." Steve removed the stethoscope from his ears. "Did you need something from me, Dr. Stark?"
Steve sighed. “Go away, Tony.”
Rhodey didn't even need to open his eyes. "Tony, you better have a damn good reason as to why you're waking me up right now."
"I have to check on some patients, dear." Sarah put her arms around her son. "Just...don't give up so quick."
The interns all shifted around silently at first, exchanging nervous glances. Sharon was the one who finally spoke up.
Tony nodded and took another sip of a drink, feeling more immortal than ever. Steve instinctively wrapped his arm around Eva.
"Oh, my
"Go home and shower. Y'all stink and look like hell." Wilson actually smiled for a split second before checking his watch. "My interns, pre-rounds tomorrow at five a.m. Rounds are at six. Enjoy the day off."
He shouldn't have said anything to Tony last night, not while he was simultaneously pissed off and missing him all at once. He shouldn't have said anything at all that night in the ER, saying anything about being his friend or not letting him feel alone. He shouldn't have mentioned at all that he had missed Tony, not because it wasn't true, but because he was afraid of what else his feelings might make him do. Hopefully, the scotch in his system was enough that it would cloud Tony's memory.
"No, keep talking. I'm bleeding into my brain," Katie grumbled, "I deserve to know about the messy love lives of my doctors."
The brunet pouted his lips. "Don't make fun of me when I'm sick."
"He's right," Sharon replied, "they're going to announce who's doing the solo surgery."
you, for fuck’s sake. It was nice to have you back, even if it was just to be my friend.”
A smile crept on her lips, and for a moment, Steve swore that his heart had skipped a beat. She brushed the hair out of her eyes and laughed when she saw his face grow beet red.
"He loves you too, you know," Steve said, "he'd love if you played with him more."
But that was before.
Steve hadn't been to Joe's in years. A lifetime ago, when he turned 21, him and some high school buddies came to celebrate during the holiday break. He remembered a very unsuccessful night of trying to pick up girls—maybe this time he'd get lucky.
"Her pressure bottomed out," Natasha explained, "the next thing we knew, her heart stopped."
“I love you, Tony.” Hearing those words leave Steve’s mouth never gets old. Ever.
"Tones—!"
He paused, confused. "What?"
The blond pouts. “Tony, I”m being serious.”
"One more thing. He's an intern." Tony sighed. "I know, I know. It's against the rules,
Steve shook his head, pushing her away. "We're trying to save a dying girl."
"You can't mope over him forever," Sharon said, looping her arm with her best friend's, "we just want you to be happy."
The moment of peace was brief, and the echoes of the monitor brought them back to reality. Across the station, Katie's vitals immediately crashed and seizing began.
"Pepper." Tony finally choked out. "You're here."
Sharon's fight to keep quiet finally broke as the other two snickered together. She giggled a little and sighed, shaking her head. She mouthed "sorry" to the blushing blond, laughing when she was met with a wink. Steve wasn't really embarrassed anymore; eventually he laughed with them. It was nice to take a break from the constant pressure of saving lives. It was nice to just take a goddamn breath.
Sharon turned off the sound on the monitors, growing panicked at the fact that the stats were gone. Steve knelt down to the boy's height and smiled.
After a momentary blackout in the hospital, the lights flickered on quickly. Dr. Fury and Dr. Rhodes were right about backing up all the files, because all the computers needed rebooting after the blackout. Nurses and interns scurried around the hospital looking for charts and files.
Of course he'd use the landlord card. They owned the damn building that they were staying in. Tony and Steve allowed everyone else to have pets, so why couldn't they take in this little guy?
Tony laughs in disbelief, settling back on the bed next to Steve. “That’s cruelty, you know. I need coffee in the mornings.”
"I'll be fine," Tony insisted, leaning up to kiss Steve's cheek. The blonde retreated for a moment and smirked.
"Hi."
sex," Steve insisted, "I'm actually getting to know him a little. He grew up in New York. He used to play lacrosse like all the east coast elite children did when they were growing up."
"Oh, honey bear. Did the west coast take all your joy?"
, it had been too long. Too long since Pepper had really kissed him like this, kissed him like she meant it, kissed him like it was the end of the world. Sure, there would be nights after galas where they'd spend the night like this, but she or Tony were already tipsy from the alcohol they served. It hadn't felt this real, this exciting in such a long time. Lab coats were flying off, scrubs found their way to the floor—
Pepper's arrival made the gossiping worse. Now that knew about Steve and Tony, the drama was just that more interesting. The entire cafeteria was buzzing, and the interns tried their best to distract their friend.
"Right!" Steve grinned. "I-I said it would be fun to have a party, we all deserve it, right? A-and Bucky is planning everything, I guess. You guys are invited, obviously."
"Sorry enough to carry you back out to the car."
"I—I meant to call—"
Steve chuckled. "Yes, Tony. I like you
One last time to remember what it felt like to love Tony before saying goodbye.
Steve barely looked up from his charting. “There was a car pile-up because of the snow. Everyone who’s sober is working now.”
Steve immediately returned to where the interns stood, grabbing Sharon and Natasha and pushing them to the front. Sharon glared at him, jabbing him in the chest with her elbow. It stung, but it was better than having to talk to Tony. The man was gorgeous even after answering trauma consults in the ER.
Steve nodded. Bucky stood up angrily.
"Wilson is in surgery," Sharon replied, "we need to do a chest tube on him. He's bleeding into his chest."
"I meant to warn you," Wilson said, "you do not question Carol Danvers. She's one of the best in the country; she knows more than you ever will."
The brunet slammed the binder shut and handed it back to Bucky. “I want hourly results on her status. You can page me in surgery if need be. Get her ICP down or you’re not scrubbing in.”
"Why are you smiling?"
Steve gulped. "S-sir?"
He spotted some of the interns from the mixer, gathered at one of the booths. They seemed to have created their own little groups already, and Steve didn't feel quite comfortable just jumping in and joining them. The blond decided to take a seat at the bar, smiling at the same bar tender who served him his first legal drink.
Damn. Steve really got lucky his first night back in Chicago.
“I just wanted to be nice,” Steve replied after a while. The words somehow felt like a lie coming out of his mouth, but he wasn’t sure why else he cared in the first place. “He’s having a having a hard time and feeling lonely, and I didn’t want him to feel that way.”
"Really," Tony replied, "better act quickly, 'cause it seems your friends have a thirty second head start."
"Page Dr. Anthony Stark from neuro," Dr. Wilson began, "and, uh...Rogers. Take...let's see here...Katie Stevens...to get a CT."
"What is going on with you?"
“Don’t you have anything you’d wear to a party and not like you’re going to head in for a staff meeting?”
"I need to go. Charting. Dr. Wilson is probably looking for me too." Steve forced a smile. "I'll see you around, Tony. Stark. Dr. Stark."
After profuse gratitude, the young hero pulled his mask back on and continued his work, promising to be back in the morning before he went to school. Peter gripped Tony in a hug once more before swinging away to save the city.
"Why aren't you running the company?"
But Steve wanted one
Natasha and Bucky burst into fits of laughter, with Sharon trying to shush them but failing miserably.
Tony drops his bags, pressing his lips against Steve’s. It’s fervent, it’s bittersweet, it’s Chapstick and coffee, it’s completely fucking
"Every nurse at the station bats their eyelashes at you and dreams of what it'd be like with you in the on call room. And those are just the nurses. The other interns are practically on their knees."
Steve's brow furrowed. "We might be called in tomorrow, you know. A day off is never a real day off for interns. You guys know that."
"Oh my
"Laura Peterson, 32 weeks pregnant, in a car accident this morning," the paramedic explained, "fetal distress on the monitors—"
"I didn't tell Steve anything." Saying his name out loud made Tony's heart ache. "I was planning to tell him soon, to explain everything."
“Thanks for the coffee, Rogers. I owe you next time. Have a goodnight, guys.” The neurosurgeon gave a friendly wave before leaving the hospital.
Now that Steve was a doctor, it felt different to be on the other side of the glass. Visitors and patients alike passed by, admiring the youngest people in the hospital. They captivated people of all ages; everyone loved newborn babies.
Steve chuckled a little. "Hey there, sweet girl. You're strong."
Natasha sighed. "I meant to only tell Sharon, but Bucky was still lurking around in the library..."
"Talking to me like I'm still yours." Steve swallowed back the knot in his throat. "We're not...you're married."
of the truth. So technically, there was no harm in what he said.
“Some party, huh?”
Pepper had suggested counseling. Tony insisted they wouldn't help, and that was clear as day as they sat on opposite sides of the room with a rather uncomfortable marriage counselor.
Wilson stopped in his tracks. He wasn't usually surprised to see this much skin in an on-call room; people did a lot of crazy shit in the hospital. Seeing who was naked in the sheets in on-call room was what startled him. Steve locked eyes with his bosses and immediately froze.
"Bye Dr. Stark! See you later!"
It was
"Oh, Rogers, we'd be denying everyone a party!" Bucky winked. "All the morning nurses will be pretty upset at me if we canceled. I also promised booze, and no one wants to turn down drinks."
“You know so much about me already,” Tony said coolly, “you seem to know everyone here, and you’re here at a staff party. I’m assuming you work here.”
And just like that, the intern left without a word, without a smile.
"People are screwing in the on-call rooms and the supply closets all the time." Tony said softly. "I'm sure you're not the first intern who fucked his boss."
She looped her arm with his, silently hoping that her friend wasn’t too upset. Steve squeezed her arm right on cue, a silent acknowledgement for her apology. Steve was glad to finally get back to work in the usual chaos of the pit.
Friends should not be giving each other heart eyes over shared cups of coffee, but, to each their own, right?
The corners of her lips turned upwards slightly. "No lame shit. It better be good. And get me some jello."
A real chance at scrubbing in a major surgery. They couldn't wait.
Steve rested his head on the desk. "He's just so pretty, Sharon. I can't talk to him."
The perfect distraction for lingering feelings for an ex-boyfriend was a party.
"Going steady? Steve, you guys are dating!" Sharon exclaimed. "That's the most old-fashioned termed for dating in history."
"Rogers suggested that we have a party for all the interns!" Bucky wrapped his arm around Steve, pinching where Sharon couldn't see. "Isn't that right, Blondie?"
Steve's heart skipped a beat.
"I like tequila sunrises," Natasha teased.
If he had been with them, he probably wouldn't have taken shots to ease his nerves since he was alone. He wouldn't have been alone in his thoughts, secretly terrified of killing a patient because it felt like everything he'd ever learned was leaking out of his ears. He wouldn't have been distracted and taken a a gorgeous stranger back to his apartment, and he wouldn't be dreaming of another night with that same gorgeous stranger.
"Alright, here's the medicine," Steve said finally, handing him the pill. "And I put some lemon in your water, make sure to finish it."
"Rogers. Good to see you...resting."
"Alright. Play nice for the next two days and I'll tell Steve you were a good cat," Tony said gently, "if you're a good cat, they'll spoil you even more. They'll probably kick me out of here so they can buy you a cat throne or something."
They stood across the room from each other, a war zone between them. Felt just like home, the way they were fighting. It was as if Tony never left New York in the first place. Before Pepper could respond, there was a gentle knock on the door.
She turned to Tony. "Thank you for picking me up. It's nice to get to work together."
He could never guess what was about to happen next. Every plot twist, every unsuspecting detail that turned out to be major evidence in solving the crime, he never thought to expect it. When he still lived with Sarah, she'd constantly tease him for the look of surprise when they revealed who the culprit was.
Great. Now they have a damned cat.
Tony’s heart melts. “I really like it. You’re incredibly talented, you know. I think my drawing skills are limited to drawing stick figures.”
Tony sighed. “What are my odds of me being able to get out of this?”
more one night stands.
Cheeseburger tilted his head, as if suddenly interested in the idea. Tony nodded and continued, babbling on and on to the kitten, who seemed pleased with all the attention and ear scratching.
The sound of the drill going into Katie's skull unnerved Steve at first. He'd seen videos of the procedure being done, he was used to cutting up cadavers and seeing the anatomy. He shouldn't have been so surprised seeing Katie's brain, but he was still in awe when the organ was exposed.
"Looks like we're stuck together, Dr. Rogers."
"What the hell, Tony? Did you know she was coming? What is going on? What are you going to tell your...intern? Fury is calling a meeting once the trauma settles down. Did you know? Are you okay?"
Tony never really had pets. While he was growing up, Howard never really allowed animals inside the house, so he just got used to the idea. So, Tony Stark didn't have any pets.
Steve adjusted the saline flow to the patient’s arm. “Lay down, Tony.”
"The NICU nurses were right about you," Pepper began. "You're a natural."
"I'm trying my best here," Pepper urged, "to be civil. I'm trying my best because I know Tony...well, I'm doing this for Tony."
Bucky and Natasha returned with more books in hand, and the atmosphere changed as they continued their studying. There was only an hour left until Bucky needed to scrub in. Dr. Stark's craniotomy was scheduled right after.
"Stuck in the elevator with Dr. Calvin Klein. Is Andy okay?"
Again, Steve was probably just being dramatic. He tried to remember that when Tony handed him a cup of coffee. Steve liked his coffee light and sweet, something Tony always teased him about, since the neurosurgeon always took the coffee black. Tony didn't kiss him, not here in the hospital, but he let his hand brush against Steve briefly before backing away.
Bucky groaned. “Sharon, what the hell are you being so loud for?!”
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony’s voice is teasing, but he looks fondly at the super soldier.
Sharon gave a sheepish smile when Steve whipped his head around to glare at her, too. "You can totally trust me, Steve. Not Bucky and his loud mouth."
Unfortunately, his daydreaming was cut off by the last person that he wanted to see—Dr. Potts-Stark.
Steve turned back to him, beet red and embarrassed. "I'm sorry, I'm just—"
There was a bit of a truce between the two of them. There were no more withering stares from across nurses' stations, no passive-aggressive comments, no petty calls at 4 am to clean the ER. Both could occupy the break room for coffee and exchange pleasantries. Hell, they were catching up with each other now.
of other activities to follow, yes."
"I...I need to leave," Tony panted, "but you are making it
was nice. It was hot, but I was drunk, so I'm hoping what I remember was hot." Steve shook his head again when he saw her jaw drop. He fucking knew it. "Listen, I didn't want to say anything but you asked—"
He smiled. “Nothin’. You’re pretty and I like watching you talk.”
"Interns are pretty much always on call," Steve explained, "that means you're stuck with me for the night anyway."
"I want to fix this," Pepper urged once again, "Tony, we both made mistakes—"
"Steve." The handshake lingered for a moment before the newly named stranger was heading out the door.
“I’m done talking about this for tonight, okay?” Steve wasn't smiling anymore, and his voice was on the edge of shouting. “I
Pepper quickly wiped the tears from her cheeks and handed the intern some charts. "Dr. Stark and I will meet you in the patient's room. That'll be all, Steve."
Steve wasn't so embarrassed now. "You think I don't know that? You think I'm actively trying to fall for a guy I can't have? I know. Believe me, I have spent days and weeks thinking about that."
"It's just a cough," Tony insisted. He stood up—slowly, since his muscles were absolutely fucking
it just hurts. It hurts like hell, knowing that the boy he loves is going to be across the country.
“Works ‘cause you love me.”
Tony remained glued to his spot on the couch, arms crossed. “Scotch is more fun to drink alone.”
Without another word, Tony left to speak to the teenager, who was just as eager as ever to be examined before surgery. Steve stood speechless at the nurses' station, dropping every single file and scan in his hands. The nurse who directed him to radiology earlier that morning giggled.
Steve was just finishing up stitches on one of the pit patients before Dr. Rhodes peeked behind the curtain.
“I should have done this half an hour ago,” Steve says, pressing his lips to Tony’s forehead.
He wanted to hate her. He hated himself for it, but it was true. He hated that she had Tony first, he hated that she complicated the one good relationship he had in a while. But that wasn't true at all; if anything, he complicated what she had first. He hated that she was perfect, that everyone loved her immediately, and he hated that he felt like a high-schooler plotting his revenge against his sworn enemy.
"Uh, good morning." There was a bit of a sheepish smile on his face as if he was a bit embarrassed to be found half-dressed in a stranger's room. As if he had any reason to be embarrassed, looking perfect enough to go shoot a commercial or another underwear ad after a drunken encounter with someone he didn't know.
Before Tony can protest, he’s cut off by the swift motion of Steve sweeping him off his feet. Tony sighs leaning in against Steve’s neck, eyes suddenly heavy with fatigue. He can feel Steve laughing a little bit as he becomes drowsy his arms.
Cheeseburger mewed impatiently, ready to have his favorite food. The engineer sat next to him, breaking off tiny pieces of the burger for the kitten.
"Can I speak to you for a moment?" The grin on Tony's face was so sincere and so inviting, it was no wonder every woman in the hospital was falling at his feet.
Sharon frowned and left the station without a word. Steve groaned to himself and hung his head in his hands. He barely had time to mope before his pager went off, ending his afternoon of charting to go man the ER.
"What?" Tony growled.
He hated the way his chest tightened when he finally looked Tony in the eyes. He hated the fact that he missed Tony as he stood right before him. He hated the fact that he wanted to forgive him. He hated that Tony looked so sad, even though he should have said something beforehand.
“Tony, this is Eva,” Steve began, “Eva, this is Dr. Tony Stark, one of the best neurosurgeons out there.”
As they entered the hospital, all staff were gathered around the main staircase. The chief of trauma, Dr. Rhodes, and Nick Fury stood above everyone, waiting for everyone to settle down before speaking.
The intern locker room was crowded but oddly quiet. People were mingling, catching up after last night's mixer—an attempt for the attendings, residents, and interns to get to know each other—but other than that, there was a weird silence. Some tried to hide their fear, others didn't; it was their first day as doctors. The thought alone actually made Steve nervous.
"You were right, Steve." Tony looked so proud of him, so much so that Steve wanted to just melt into a puddle. Did he have this effect over everyone, or was Steve just particularly weak to his charm?
Christmas decor lined the hallways of Chicago Medical Hospital. There was a bit of snow sprinkling the streets, too; there was usually something magical about the way a city glittered during the holiday season. The holiday wasn’t due for a few weeks, but with the decorations and the snow that dusted the rooftops, everyone was ready for Christmas.
Steve stepped forward, taking the present into his hands. “You know, I feel bad. I don’t have a gift for you.”
"Missed you at the bar last night," She said, adjusting her coat, "we saw you, but it got really crowded. Did you get out okay?"
Steve paused. "Have you even done one yet?"
"Yup."
"What? She would normally find that kind of shit funny!" Bucky stared at the interns in disbelief. "Oh, come on, you guys."
Sharon looked at him curiously. "He said something about a party. After he bugged me about Nat, he told me that I should go to your place tonight."
But now it’s awkward. It’s awkward and pathetically sad and
"Pep, honey..."
Tony hated that he noticed Steve smiling and laughing. He especially despised the fact that his heart ached upon the realization he hadn’t made him that happy in a very long time. God, he couldn’t even remember the last time he made someone laugh—really laugh, enough where their stomachs hurt and their faces were sore from the smiling. He wondered if he ever made Steve that happy.
"I'm not the superstar, my mom is," Steve explained, "She helped them out when they were starting their store. They didn't have insurance back then, so she checked in on them when they needed it. Because of that, they helped babysit me when she had to take extra shifts. I practically lived here with their two daughters."
"Well...you can call me and we'll plan one. A real date."
Wilson clapped her on the back before going into his own surgeries. "That kid is your responsibility today. Check on my post and pre ops, and remember: Tommy Evans is the one patient you can't kill today."
Steve panicked now that he saw the deadly expression in Eva's eyes. "What? No! I'm just explaining what happened—"
"Hey. You have me."
Bucky sat up and sighed. "They don't tell you about this. The shit that hurts so bad you can't breathe. It's horrible."
The worst of the torrential storm subdued, but only heavy rain still fell from the gray skies. The technology in the hospital seemed to be up and running, and there was finally a calm among the staff. Steve, however, felt like a zombie. He made his way into the gallery of the OR where Andy was finally receiving her surgery. Sharon glanced up to the gallery, surprised to find her best friend after his disappearance.
Steve nodded, scrubbing his arms and fingertips.
Tony nodded. "You should open it. It's not fancy or extravagant, or anything. I also don't have a gift receipt, so you're stuck with it."
Eva leaned up on her toes and kissed his cheek, a silent acceptance of his apology. "I'll tell you how you can make it up to me back at my place."
Before anyone could respond, Natasha grabbed Wilson's charting and left the station with a huff.
“Well, there’s a number of things we can try—"
"He was drunk," Steve replied.
Soon, Steve returned with the coffee, soup, and a snack for Bucky once he finally woke up to chart. Sharon silently fought a battle in her mind, wondering whether or not it would be right to just interrogate Steve while they were mostly alone. She decided to keep quiet until Dr. Stark passed through the ER on his way out. The energy in the ER immediately changed, and Sharon could have sworn Steve perked up upon hearing the neurosurgeon’s voice. After updating the night nurses about pages, Tony waved over to where the interns were sitting.
She was met by Steve Rogers once more, surrounded by a couple other interns that were officially assigned to the case. Steve was holding Alex away from the incubator, which was now wide open as one of the interns performed CPR on baby Andy.
"What the hell did you do?"
"You can go home," Steve blurted out, "you had a long day, after all. I can page whoever is on call so you can go home instead."
excuse. Tony should have thought of that before.
All eyes were trained on Steve now. The intern raised his hand, then extended it to Pepper, who was holding hers out.
"I don't know why you don't want to talk to him," Natasha said, "It's
"Oh, hi, Alex. I'm sorry to wake you."
"Charge again or she definitely will die, Rogers!"
He took a step back, admiring his work. Fury nodded in approval, saying something which Bucky couldn't hear. He couldn't focus, and all he could think about is the fact that he pulled an appendix out from someone's body. He did it. He could have screwed everything up, but he didn't.
Steve nodded quickly. "I'm just fine, sir. I'm sorry about the delinquent charts. I'll get right on these and the post-op notes as well."
“I’ll take whatever soup they have down there,” Sharon replied.
Bucky leaned over and popped the food into his mouth, laughing as Steve rolled his eyes. Sharon leaned against Steve, swatting Bucky away from the french fries. Natasha laughed and threw the crusts of her sandwich at the soldier.
“Yeah, well, I need you in the mornings.”
"I don't have a life," Steve teased, "I haven't properly had a day of doing nothing in months. I'm starting to forget what my bed looks like."
"This is heaven, right? This is the good place?"
"You always say...boyfriend-y things to me. You've got to stop." Steve fought to keep his voice steady, but it was cracking the way it always did when he was on the verge of tears. "It's...God, Tony, it's
Steve hung his head in his hands. "Please,
Their conversation was cut short as the ambulance soon wailed loud enough for them to hear. The duo soon rushed to the ambulance bay, meeting the interns and the paramedics. Tony stopped in his tracks once he noticed that Steve was one of the interns on the case.
Part of him wondered what would have happened if he had just moved to California for medical school. His heart ached too much at the thought.
The two women put on their best smiles, batting their lashes and holding their hands together as if pleading in prayer. Steve shook his head and chuckled.
"Please leave." Steve's vision was blurrier now, and he felt so goddamn embarrassed as he felt tears falling from his face.
But Steve had slipped through the rescue team before he could say anything more.
Steve paused upon hearing her voice. Hearing the sound was something out of a dream, emerging from his foggy memories. He finally got a chance to look at her, noticing her dark curly hair and the deep brown eyes behind her glasses. Looking at her suddenly brought back memories of undergrad and medical school, late nights at the library and drinking absurd amounts of caffeine. The sight of her nearly knocked the wind of out him.
Surprisingly, the neurosurgeon looked stumped. His brows furrowed together, deep in thought. He looked downright irresistible—Steve hated that he found himself staring with the female interns.
But it was his first day at work. His first grown up thing. Medical school was a trial run, just a bunch of scalpel-hungry children with stethoscopes around their necks playing dress up. Today was an actual day. With actual patients. He prayed to some being up in the heavens, begging for a good day.
"I don't mind waiting, Steve."
The drive-in theater was a fun memory before—now it’s the place where his heart is going to break for the first time.
Tony couldn't keep the smile off his face. Thinking about Steve, the way he blushed and the way he reacted to being asked out—the rush made him feel like a teenager again. Maybe there was something there. Something beyond a one-night stand.
"I asked Rhodey to make you come in here because I wanted to say I'm sorry," Tony began shakily, "For everything."
Tony sighed. "It's a little better now."
"Goodnight, Rogers."
"Oh."
The rest of the twenty four hours seemed to pass in a blur. The interns ran to the blood bank, charted and did scut for Wilson, checked the vitals on the hospice patients, checked on non-emergent patients in the clinic; everything their residents didn't want to take care of, they did.
Their first date. The second date. Their first fight. Their second fight. The day that they moved in together. Their first Christmas at the apartment. Decorating the house for Halloween. The day Tony finally asked her to marry him. The day they got married. The first night of their honey moon. They day they finally bought a place in Manhattan. Their first anniversary. The second anniversary, the third anniversary, the fourth—
The little boy's eyes opened, growing wide upon the realization that he was in the hospital. He sat up quickly, spitting up blood and trying to get up from the table. Steve lunged forward, stopping the boy in his tracks. The monitors started going off, only scaring the boy even more.
The message was clear, apparently, as she quickly moved off him in protest.
“I thought you didn’t dance,” Ashley sneered viciously, every bit of the sweet-girl facade gone.
"You must be the newest Stark," the British man growled at the girl as he folded his arms across his chest. "Your daddy and I go way back."
She was having a bad day, to say the least. The stupid train was late this morning so she was late to class with yet
Unable to hold back any longer, Bucky surged forward and pressed his lips against Clint's. He tasted exactly as he remembered, soft and lush with hints of coffee. And the feeling of him kissing back made the supersoldier whimper deep in his throat. He's not even ashamed that he whimpered again when calloused hands moved to gently cradle his face. Bucky moved to deepen the kiss, curling his tongue inside the perfect mouth he remembered. The one that belonged to him. Just like he belonged to the archer.
“Tony…”
The pair came in together before the brunette made a bee line for the coffee pot. Steve turned to Emerson looking at her collection of ingredients, smiling at the bag of chocolate chips not-so-subtly left directly on the stove. Em followed his line of sight and smiled as well, pretending suddenly to have interest in the ceiling.
“Did I ever tell you that your Dad said ‘no’ the first time I asked him out?” the super soldier smiling when he felt his son chuckle.
“Wade Wilson…” Peter growled at the man, not surprised when his husband quietly added “Stark” to the end of his name. Wade had actually taken Stark for his last name when they wed, no hyphen or anything, just making Wilson his new middle name. Told Peter not to take Wilson, since they and all their kids could have the same last name.
“Love you Jo.”
He smiled at the two as they pulled into park and walked into the small but charming shop.
Hair tangled and hanging in her face, with an imprint on her cheek from the outline of Tony’s watch, she made eye contact with Steve before smiling brightly at him. He returned the smile before tucking some of her tangles behind her ear and away from her eyes.
One that almost inspired him to skip out on the massage in favor of having some afternoon delight with his mate. But alas, the two had to enjoy relaxing massages for an hour until he could see his pup again.
"You feeling better Thumper?" the brunette asked her, noticing how she curled up further into Steve's embrace.
“You said you hurt your ribs, you have those below your breasts as well as behind them. You are obviously injured and I’m a paramedic–”
?" Steve choked a little on his food as his husband glared at him. It didn't help that his kids were laughing along with him while the genius just pouted. He took pity on his husband as he offered a change in subject.
Yup, Tony thought to himself, growing up way too fast.
“You did use your power. Your power of wit. Which I think your Tati would agree is fair game,” Clint said with a bright smile and a chuckle, getting one out of Daci as well. “Well I’m glad to hear you only used your words this time. And of course you have two parents, kiddo. I’ve loved you for a long time.”
"You've got yourself a deal, Bambi," his Dad said as he extended his hand. Peter smiled as he reached his own hand out to shake it, only before his Dad pulled the teen back into his parent's embrace.
“Shit,” she muttered. “I must’ve left them at Susan’s.”
“How is it different?!”
“We could sue their asses, that’s not
“Emerson,” he called after she took a few steps towards the kitchen. “Your brain is betraying you, so you must trust your heart. You have a great one, little sister, trust it to tell you the answer. I love you and I know you will figure it out. And to answer your question, your Pop mentioned something about fresh salted caramel cookies?” She couldn’t help but laugh, rolling her eyes affectionately as she turned to walk to the kitchen.
“Auntie! Up up!” Lilli said, suddenly appearing next to Emerson, tiny hands flailing. She reached down for her niece, lifting the toddler up to sit on her lap, struggling for a second to balance the two on the unicorn tube.
“How was school Joey?” he asked the teen as she stood up to carry Peter around the kitchen piggy back style.
“Hey hey, let me help with that,” an all too familiar voice said as Hawkeye came into view. He smiled down at the superhero whose face mask was half-up his face.
He loved singing Beatles songs to his kids. Other artists he saved for Steve, like Marvin Gaye or Genuine.
“I’m done listening Joey,” he said in exhaustion as he rolled his eyes and started walking to her changing table to grab a diaper. “And you are putting on this diaper, young lady.” She frowned but didn’t move to try and out run him
“I...I distracted Daddy while he was driving! It’s my fault Steve -”
But today, he'd finally meet Wade.
“Hey, I’m not a stooge,” Leo said with an adorable pout.
His brother smiled at him as he hugged his daughter close.
“-and hey, maybe you could come out of retirement and-”
“That is enough, Josephine,” Steve growled out at her. She looked over at him, angry tears spilling down her cheeks as she stared down his fiery blue eyes.
Incredibly irritated, he left his own note in case she should come back to call him asap before grabbing his keys and leaving.
He took Lucky to the park, sitting under his favorite tree as he watched his pup fetch a stick. Instead of bringing the stick back to him, he ran with it straight past him. Clint turned his head in confusion, before he saw James approaching him.
"Yeah I have a picture of what I'm thinking of," Emerson spoke up with a smile, dancing a little in her chair next to a grinning Miles.
“So any time I talk shit about myself you’re going to kick my ass?”
Steve absorbed that information, feeling a little bit of emotional whiplash to realize the Omega he had a crush on didn’t just abandon him - but rather had a pup to take care of. A pup whose age suddenly confused Steve…
“Peter, what did I tell you about hopping on Pop?” the sleepy blonde asked. Tony fumbled around for another pillow as he covered his ears, ignoring their son waking them up so damn early –
“Of course I’ve had second thoughts! I’m still human after all. I’ve also had many doubts about literally every choice I’ve made in my life. I’ve had second thoughts about the serum, being Captain America, being an Avenger, being a leader...a husband and yeah, most recently a father. There are a lot of hard days, days I want to rip my own hair out. And yes maybe even one or two where I've considered getting on a motorcycle and never looking back...but I also wouldn’t trade it for anything," Steve finished with a sincere smile, feeling his heart warm at the thought that of his family.
By Monday afternoon, Natasha had cornered him in the station’s supply closet.
“Benjamin,” he replied as a smile spread across the girl’s face.
"Yeah well," Steve responded, "it's her hair, her Dad's the one whose going to throw a temper tantrum."
get to decide who your family is; sometimes it’s by blood and sometimes it’s by those too deeply and madly in love with you to not get attached. Hell, I wouldn’t even be with Steve if it weren’t for you…” he teased with a smile. She snorted in laughter as she saw Steve cross his arms in offense.
“Oh! Papa! Porky no lassos?” That took the blonde a second, before he curled over in laughter.
As his husband went to the fridge, Steve went to the cabinets to grab a small cup, smiling when Tony opened a bottle of apple juice and poured it before taking the cup from the blonde’s hand to let their son sip. He watched father and son with fondness for another moment, thankful for their moment of peace before the inevitable explosion that was nap time for his kids.
“Not at us, but he also didn’t tell me what Rumlow said to piss you off so much.”
gay uncle to the point that he killed himself. When he was fifteen and your mother was seventeen. And then, months later when your mom found out she was pregnant, her mother – your grandmother – kicked her out of the house. She moved in with me, Bucky and our mom in a shitty two bedroom apartment until you were born. And your grandmother, mind you – not the one that cried the first time she held you and spoiled you every day she could – but your
“Oh my god, shit I-” Tony said before he was interrupted, wondering if maybe he had been twisting it in his head.
He waited for Emerson to leave the room before hiding his face in his hands, afraid it might split open from the amount of smiling he was achieving. He quickly got up to go find his husband, ignoring the drawing pad that fell to the floor.
, do you understand? You’re the reason my childhood memories came back to me. Remember when we had to bathe in the river after hiding in the mud? Helping you with your hair...reminded me of my ma doing my hair when I was your age. Taking care of you...it always grounds me back to the moment. Seeing your face...cub it makes all of those years HYDRA had me worth it. Te iubesc pe fiica mea,” {
Steve reached forward and grabbed the man by his hips before yanking him back onto the bed with him. He wrapped his arms around the smaller man and kissed his neck.
"Well I guess my work here is done," Rhodey spoke up with a choked laugh. Tony sat up with a now sleepy boy to bid his friend farewell.
“She got off the plane yoU MONSTER!” his man-child cried out before climbing into the passenger’s seat.
"Came to save me?" Emerson offered as she saw Shuri's cheeks blush a little pink.
“I told you I was teasing you.”
Moving and standing in the now open doorway, he switched from awe to anger. Three pairs of eyes turned to him as he stepped into the room.
“And for the record, I also wanted you there so you and your little brother could’ve used each other for comfort while both being spoiled by May. Did that thought not cross your mind?” he asked angrily. She shook her head in response, unable to think of anything to say to that.
“I want you to fuck me tonight,” Bucky said quietly, just as the limo pulled to a stop outside the hotel.
And on cue, Emerson and a sleepy looking Peter walked in to join them. Emerson maneuvered the older brother to sit by her younger one, stepping back and choosing to remain standing by the pair.
“You’re not developing a crush, are you?” Steve asked jokingly, hoping to break the build-up of anxiety in his stomach, really considering all of this.
“Second grade,” she whispered reluctantly.
“Yeah, I guess so, I was 8 when he said it. But he also gave up art school to be a paramedic for me…”
"I haven't said anything," T'Challa said in defense, smiling as they noticed the pair approaching them. "Gentlemen, have I said anything about my sister's crush on your daughter?" he asked with a smirk before grimacing in pain when his sister hit him in the stomach. Tony and Steve smiled at the pair and how flustered Shuri suddenly looked at the confession.
Tony turned to his husband who was frozen in place, feeling his instincts take over as he ordered his assistant to relieve Pepper of Peter duty so she could take care of the PR nightmare.
He pushed away any doubts and for just this moment, let himself be happy.
Speaking of the devil, the blonde was opening the door to the bedroom as Tony reached for the handle. Steve was dressed in a t-shirt just a little too small for his broad chest and sweatpants. And if it wasn’t for the murderous look on his face, he would’ve been turned on by the sight.
“I’m teasing!” Brock offered. “Can’t take a joke…”
EMERSON
"What are you and your brother - whose teaching my daughter witchcraft, by the way - doing on Earth? I thought you said you were busy with the nine realms for a while?" Tony asked as he sat next to their daughter on the couch, keeping Miles in his lap. Steve sat next to them, giving Thor the seat by his brother.
"Excellent, Em, meet us at the elevators while I go get your Pop," he said as he started to go back to his room.
“He did?” their mom asked in shock, as if she was hearing this for the first time. “Well that sounds like a mean Daddy, doesn’t it?”
“We met in college, we were lab partners and he tried for the entire semester to get in my pants. Wouldn’t let him though,” she said with a laugh as Jo joined her. “He was never really my type. So we ended up being friends, but we lost touch after college. I saw him about five years ago at a party, we were both incredibly drunk and ended up sleeping together. Found out I was pregnant a few weeks later, panicked and called Tony. He said it was up to me but he’d support me either way,” she smiled again thinking about it.
"Hey! Quit scarring your family and come eat!" Clint called, interrupting the two who broke apart and saw just about everyone staring at them.
“I missed you,” he whispered before gently kissing the blonde man. “Me too, Tony” he returned, smiling into the kiss. Tony stopped abruptly, sitting up slowly – somehow only slightly hung-over – and not making eye contact with Steve.
“I KNOW the love of my life left me, then maybe died, apparently survived and has been running around in red spanx busting drug rings. All without telling me. Am I missing anything?” he probably didn’t look intimidating, wrapped in a hospital gown. He was still shorter than Wade but stood his ground as he looked at those stupid sunglasses.
“So do we have a deal? I’ll keep him on a leash, I promise,” he finished with a wink to Joey. She smiled at that, the blonde huffing in disbelief.
“Fury found out about me and Vi and fired her. Did you know?” he asked, anger beginning to brew again at the thought that maybe somehow
“I think he needs more babies on him,” Bucky said with a smirk, gently lowering the six month old blonde boy to sit on Tony’s chest. Wanda gently hugged the baby boy who was babbling away while Tony glared at his husband’s best friend.
“Do you wanna get this over with or do you need a lecture to realize how stupid it was to drive while under the influence? When your father died from–”
His eyes rolled at her antics; she was sounding too much like Tony for the blonde’s comfort.
“What?” she asked.
Mostly he was just glad he wasn’t facing the end of that barrel.
“I think he could turn me,” she said absently, smiling when her Dad burst into laughter.
"Yes," Emerson replied coolly. "An old friend messaged me a few days ago, her name is Jenny and we used to, well, we were there for each other in a dark time. And anyway, she messaged me that I have a little brother. He's five years old and his mother died a few months ago. She was...a friend to me and Jenny. Like a street mom," she added with a small smile. She took another breath before continuing.
She felt his hand gently take hers, interlocking fingers before rubbing his thumb across her hand in comfort. She turned to smile at him, thanking him silently for the gesture, before resting her head against his shoulder. The second she felt him kiss the top of her head, the door opened and her name was being called back.
Clint had another year of school left before graduating and Bucky was shipping off to god knows where.
“If he gets me an iced coffee instead of a hot latte again I am breaking the truce we have on pranks,” she said stubbornly after a dramatic sigh.
“Here baby,” Steve said to the boy, only rolling his eyes when he caught his husband giving Peter three cookies. He gently placed the bag against the boy’s head, noting his husband was considerably less grumpy than he was earlier when he offered the blonde a smile and helped the boy hold it to his head.
company. My Aunt Peggy made sure of that, because she’s a badass.” During Tony’s rampage, because he talks with his hands, he’d let go of Steve’s hand and hadn’t even realized it.
“Speaking of, I should probably head back,” the woman said with an apologetic smile. She leaned over and kissed her Tati’s cheek before turning her attention back to Daci. “It was great meeting you, I look forward to seeing you more often.” Daci remained silent as she watched the tall blonde leave, frowning when she saw the smile on her father’s face.
"You're asking a kid to like a bad guy, it's not going to happen and it's why I decided we'd never tell him." The light bulb went off in the arachnid's mind.
Which to be fair, it did, but it also felt amazing.
"You don't know what the end product is going to be? Man you are a braver daddy than I am," Pat teased as he fastened the apron around Miles.
“Oh crap, it’s the office. Hang on you two I’ll be right back,” Tony said, kissing Steve’s cheek before leaving the kitchen to take his call.
“But you didn’t abort me. And now… now I’m with a loving family…who will probably kick me to the curb when I tell them…” she said with sudden defeat, partially turning to walk away from this.
Steve closed his eyes tightly as his fists copied the action. He stopped when he felt his fingernails begin to draw blood, hands opening up as he tried to get a hold of his self. He quickly sat back in his chair when he felt his body begin to literally shake with rage.
“What? Like there isn’t enough room for her? You two don’t have enough money to support her? – he starts counting off on his fingers – I finally won’t be outnumbered? I can use current references in this house without waiting for a “quick google search” he threw his Pops a sideways glance.  We can make fun of you two behind your back you know I’m really not seeing a downside to this…”
A wave of gratitude washed over him as he settled his daughter in his arms before they drifted to sleep. She had been a savior not only with Peter but with their little family as a whole. He was truly blessed and hoped she felt the same. Not just because she could access resources under two rich superheroes, but because she felt she deserved the love and attention Tony and Steve gave her freely.
“Fuck,” she said in pain, wiggling in her seat as she tried her best to regain control of her muscles and ignore the pain from her wrists. She looked out the window as they pulled up, frowning at seeing other students she recognized arrested for drinking at school.
She stole a glance at him, glaring at the ridiculous man who covered his mouth to keep from laughing out loud.
“If you like them, you should ask them out,” Steve said simply, shrugging his shoulders as if he hadn’t thought about various double date ideas.
The smile on Steve’s face grew at the sincerity of his son’s statement.
“No, but I know Mr. Stark’s family. I’m one of your dad’s interns, he brags about you guys a lot.”
“It’s pretty awesome,” she admitted, not sure if she could do this everyday but still proud of herself for trying. She watched with a smile as her Daddy walked over to them, sitting himself on the edge of the tub near her Tati.
"Well, that's still no excuse to go in to Daddy's lab late at night. And without adult supervision," the blonde added, getting a chuckle from his kids.
Howard released him as he tried to stand up tall, though when Tony finally sat up, he realized just how short his father was in comparison to future his father in law. Steve suddenly appeared by his side, grabbing his arm to help him up as both their fathers had a stare off.
“Tony?” Steve squeaked out, still in somewhat disbelief. Tony...Tony was the one he had saved as a kid? The first (and apparently only) boy he kissed?
“Oh, I’m…” she could feel her cheeks blush as she thought about Helen, “…good.”
The two men stared at each other a moment longer before Tony laughed, leaning over to his husband.
Hulk eventually nodded and stomped his way over to her, clearly trying to downplay his excitement. When he settled down with his back against the gym wall, she made a decision to climb into his lap with a couple of books in her arms.
Another wave of inner peace rolled over him, so incredibly thankful for his friends who made this so much easier on him.
“Damn Banner, way to wear the pants for once,” Clint spoke up, voice slurred.
Her uncle bought it, a deep frown forming on his face. He nodded in sympathy before turning to leave. She followed him, mind racing as she shut the bedroom door.
“I think you should go back to your floor before your Dad finds out you left and gets more upset.” She couldn’t help but glare at him, not even attempting to protest as she quickly made her way back to her floor, a strong grip on Wolf. She couldn’t hear Steve anymore, walking into the kitchen to find her Tati talking on the phone in a quiet voice.
“Why would you be friends with someone who doesn’t love stuffed animals?” Cara said teasingly as the man in question walked up to them.
An Alpha who didn’t think with his knot. One who saw he had a pup and instead of running away, had called his boy ‘cute.’ Even suggested their first date be the three of them.
Blinking a few times, he got up and went to answer the door. Surprised to see his parents standing there with matching smiles, holding several bags.
Holy shit he was
“Need a hug, kid?” he said with a smirk, arms still outstretched.
“What happened
“I GOT CONDOMS IF YOU NEED THEM,” came her final retort.
“Jo, ice pack,” Steve said with a smile, poking her in the arm with the frozen bag to get her attention. She giggled a little, keeping her head back as she used her hands blindly to grab the ice pack, gently placing it on her ‘crotchal region.’
The wheels in his head began clicking in to place, seeing where she was going with this as he shook his head ‘no.’
Steve walked to his side of the bed before climbing in with his love. He had to maneuver some of the blankets and pillows in order to see him, but was finally able to see his face and began lightly petting the beautiful man in front of him.
Here’s the thing, he’s known Sam for a long time. He was the one who helped him become an EMT and studied with him to become a paramedic.  He’d always been kind, occasionally calling Rumlow out for being ignorant and never before tried to pressure him to date – unlike his other coworkers. Sam knew his situation better than anyone, having been there for Steve more times than he ever gave him credit for. So really, he shouldn’t have been nervous, but there was still that flutter of anxiety creeping up inside of him.
Bucky was lying on his back, shirt off with Jo sprawled over his chest, rising and falling with his chest as he breathed in his deep slumber. Since he saw the opportunity for it, he quietly pulled his drawing pad out, sat on the couch, and proceeded to draw the picture in front of him.
“I’m sorry,
“I was just grabbing some grant proposals for my Dad, got curious.” He gulped when Wade just continued smiling at him, stopping about two feet away from him. Eyeing him strangely.
“Oh sorry James,” Clint said, eyes still on Bucky. “Jack’s argument is more solid,” he said before hoisting the boy up and holding him upside down again.
“Hey Harley, Steve’s here and he’s going to make us dinner!” The boy glanced at Steve for a moment before turning back to Tony.
He easily pushes the metal out of his way, climbing out with such ease it’s intimidating.
Face covered in chocolate cake.
A knock on the door interrupted them.
She rested her head on his shoulder as he hugged her close, glad to see she was actually exhausted from everything.
“Seriously Tony,
“Explica-te,” he growled at her. {
“Skootch,” he said to Peter, who took the hint and moved to make room on the bed for the larger man. “You don’t have to nap with me, but you can at least lie here quietly,” he said as he cuddled up next to Peter. Once he readjusted the blanket, he reached into his back pocket and handed Peter one of his Dad’s tablets.
who was already under the knife. Instead you got yourself detention, went out, drank alcohol, and fucking
“Love you too,” Tony said with a blush, grabbing his mate’s hand and leading the two to Harley’s room. Tony gave his mate a smile and leaned up for one more kiss before letting go of his hand.
"You don't want to see my new outfits, Papa? Daddy promised a cat walk," the little boy said sadly as the tension quickly sizzled in the room.
“I’ll make us some sandwiches for lunch,” Steve offered as he gently pushed Harley off his lap, getting up and smiling when he noticed Daci following him. “You gonna help me make sandwiches Daci?”
,” he said as he leaned forward to claim those beautiful lips. He felt Steve smile against his him and let out a small laugh. The genius was unable to resist grabbing both sides of his handsome face to kiss him fully –
“I’ve met your Aunt Pepper, she would totally kick my butt if I was ever mean to you,” Steve agreed, doing his best not to smile at the boy’s face. “You deserve someone nice too, Harley. I hope you do tell someone if I’m ever mean to you or your Daddy.” Harley was stunned into silence, deflating in his chair as Tony rejoined them.
“Okay, so I lied ONE TIME, you have to let that one go…”
The woman was already there, sitting at a small table and smiling at the teen as she made her way over. Joey sat across from the woman, only offering a small smile in greeting while the waitress brought them both waters.
He hadn’t been able to sleep since he’d talked to Obadiah. The man told him he not only had ‘no control over his son’ but that he was also looking into retiring…which could mean Ty could take over Stone Inc.
“Vigilante business isn’t all autographs and hero worship, my friend. Especially for a goddamn infant,” Wade snapped at the teen, making Peter breathe a sigh of relief. He had almost forgotten how protective Wade had become of both Emerson and Miles since they married.
"Why? What do you need help with?" he asked as he started to stand up and stretch.
“Bon qui qui?!? How could you NOT –”	“I HATE EVERYTHING, you’ll quote this for weeks –”
“Ah, so you eavesdropped on a piece of a conversation and twisted what your husband said to mean he’s leaving you?” Tony’s jaw dropped. It literally dropped.
“He’s here to kill Jackson,” Suzie answered for them, trying to sneak more cake under Bucky.
“No, unfortunately. She moved to Australia with her husband. But that doesn’t mean I ever stopped loving her.”
“No.”
He just filed it away for later, the whole killing that stupid Alpha thing.
“Alright then,
“Call my boyfriend one more name,” James growled out, clenched fists vibrating at his side.
“Yeah, me,” Steve said with a warm smile, reaching over to brush some of the blonde hair out of the pup’s eyes.
“You know, now that you mention it Peter, I’m suddenly painfully aware of this overwhelming feeling of…loss of innocence,” she said while clutching her hands to her heart dramatically.
The brunette of course had to ruin the sweet moment for him, asking; “¿porque no los dos?”
“No, what is that?” she asked curiously as she ate a little strawberry.
, so I wouldn’t go crying to my
“I should get going,” he said breaking the silence. “I’ve got some toddler-proofing to do before tomorrow.”
“Don’t apologize, I thought it was sweet,” James said, causing Clint to look up at him in betrayal. But the man was unfazed by his glare, just leaning down to kiss the blonde on his nose. “It’s called a shovel talk, babe. I already got one from Nat, remember?”
…” he whispered the last few words out, suddenly thinking that maybe detention was a lie and she’d just went to drink.
“Oh goody, there’s the Rogers in you. Speaking of which…” he began seriously.
He nodded before leaving the Commander’s office, going to find Sam. He was on the couch, looking like he was waiting for Steve.
“I did?” Steve asked skeptically.
“My son was just born can you give him a few minutes before you pimp him out?”
“You wanna stay for dinner, Jim? We’re making tacos,” Steve said when he noticed the time. It was a little past five in the afternoon and Tony suddenly wondered where Barnes was.
That wasn’t necessarily new, asking to bring someone over. Usually his friends wanted to come over to see the Tower and it’s not like Steve doesn’t have any extra art supplies lying around. He typed his reply.
“He threatened my husband in his own goddamn office! How is that not enough?!”
“Aw, Lilli, of course we’ll all be princesses!” Steve said easily, not seeing the problem.
“I’m sure whatever picture Steven painted of me was not in any good favor. But I was recently diagnosed with late stage breast cancer. I found you so I could get to know my only granddaughter…and warn you since there’s a genetic component to it.”
“Papa can I get on your shoulders too?” Peter asked when he saw Daci. The blonde quickly obliged, settling the boy on his shoulders before pushing the stroller along. Daci turned back, hoping to see her father just as excited to see the wolves, but only frowned when he was laughing at something Vivienne was saying.
“Peter, I understand. But either of you could’ve yelled for help. Instead of damaging property and exposing your powers to the world or anyone that has a camera phone,” Tati said directly to her. “Luckily it doesn’t really seem like anyone saw how it happened, and Vi is awesome enough to go back into work on her day off to cover for you. Dammit Daci this is the kind of thing that gets us kicked out and back on the run again!”
“Oh come on, Steve’s a big boy, I think he can handle himself,” Clint said as he sat up next to him.
“Possibly, but where’s the fun in that?” the shorter man asked with a smile, closing the door behind him but not moving to join the noise.
“Here,” Tony said with a smile, handing over a thick engineering book covered with dust. Steve reached his hand out in confusion to accept it, when Tony suddenly pulled it out of Steve’s reach. “This is not for you to keep, only for you to borrow,” the brunette reiterated before handing the book over.
Sure enough, a bearded blonde was photographed walking out of a Manhattan restaurant. A man Jo had never even heard of, but apparently was some millionaire named Tiberius Stone.
“So she did fake her own death?” Peter asked, getting another ear flick, eliciting another yelp in pain.
“Oh I am well aware, still got the burn marks to prove it.”
“Steve…” Tony began.
“We already told Josephine neither of you are welcome back,” the shrewd woman he once though decent said.
"No, your family has been planning this for months. I told you before there was a possibility that I couldn't go," Wade retorted as he hastily threw clothes in the black suitcase he took everywhere.
“Buck, come on she’s a kid,” Clint said on her behalf.
“Cause I’m epileptic and it causes seizures,” she said quietly.
“Just your ugly ass,” Clint smirked at his brother, smiling when the idiot only chuckled in response.
She was going to get safe and out of the way so Spiderman could investigate. He ran to a nearby alley to quickly shuck his outer layers, pulling his mask on quickly when he heard the shouts escalate to threats. He swung to the rooftop to get a better look from up top, noting with relief that the pedestrians nearby had started to disperse and move away from the altercation.
"Alright J, I'll be right up," the genius responded before turning back to the bot. "You, go power down, I don't trust you around all this stuff." The bot only chirped in response, not moving. The man looked at the bot a moment longer, staring down the hunk of junk before it chirped in defeat and moved to follow orders.
“It absolutely is!” she shot back quickly. Tony cocked his head to the side, wondering…
She could tell by the dips on her bed that they were both here to talk to her.
“It’s a soulmate bond,” Tony said quietly, almost hoping too quietly for Steve to hear. A part of him wondered if they were just in the honeymoon phase and Bruce was wrong about them being soulmates.
“Can it wait until I’ve taken a shower?” the blonde asked, pushing past his husband as he heard the sounds of his grandkids attacking his youngest in the living room.
” Tony muttered just as Isaac momentarily stopped his attack to look offended at his blonde grandfather.
He was actively avoiding the mansion, which didn’t even feel like home anymore. Not that it ever really had. But one night he snuck in, able to tiptoe past his father’s drunken/glass throwing rant to grab a bag of clothes. If he was to show his face, there was not a doubt in his mind Howard would take his anger out on him.
“That’s not happening, doll,” James said quietly, causing Clint to finally look up at him.
“-or. OR. You could stay here, with me,” Clint slurred as he scooted closer to hang his legs over the side of the bed.
“Well well well, beauty, brawn's
“Yes baby?”
kid. Not yours and not yours,” Tati added angrily while pointing his fingers at Clint and Steve in turn. With his hand still gripping her arm, he pulled her along towards the exit of the zoo. She could hear the two men calling after them but was too focused on the metal grip on her arm.
"Dad, tomorrow is Saturday," the boy countered. Tony reached over to check his phone, hating himself a little for losing track of the days. He considered what Steve would say, then remembered that he wasn't here.
“That’s the male lion, male lions have manes and act like protectors. But they’re really just lazy, the ladies do most of the work.” She heard both Clint and Steve chuckle at Peter’s explanation, though she didn’t see what was funny.
“Joey…” the brunette said sadly.
Their yoga session ended when Jarvis alerted them that Peter and the twins were here.
, the man mouthed at Em, who smiled and nodded in response.
It was funny. Clint had sworn to himself a long time ago he’d never have kids. But this whole situation felt weirdly intimate and domestic, something Clint only assumed happened in Hallmark movies.
“What the hell did I do?” he demanded.
“Families come in all shapes and sizes, kiddo. I feel like we’ve talked about this…”
She woke up first, blinking herself awake as she noticed her father still sleeping. She decided to try for the hundredth time, shifting a little in his arms and immediately waking him. With a pout, she untangled herself from his arms and stretched her arms above her head.
“Guys, clothes back on,” Steve said trying not to laugh again as the kids shrugged before doing as told. His brother had his lips pursed together like he was about to ask a question…but still stared in fear as Steve couldn’t help laughing again.
“The best night of your life, huh?” he couldn’t help but ask, smiling when the Omega huffed in frustration. “For what it’s worth, that was the best night of my life too. I’ve been thinking about you everyday since…”
He’d always hated that man.
Instead, she went to her old friends, who helped her achieve her goal of drinking alcohol, which did in fact calm her down…until she ran into Cara. And her
“Nice to meet you, DUM-E,” he said with a smile, which turned into a laugh when the bot chirped happily and Tony groaned loudly.
It's been thirteen days since his husband was called off on a mission, evident by the genius' nocturnal work in his lab. He had finished with another set of electric weapons for Natasha when he was interrupted by a certain robot. DUM-E tried to hand Tony a screwdriver as the billionaire shooed him away for the third time in the last five minutes. They were interrupted as Jarvis addressed the man.
“What the hell?” he asked the so-called ‘genius’, gripping his fist angrily and ready to fight if necessary. Steve must have sensed that, as he made his way closer in case he needed to defend his husband.
"Yeah, but you're my favorite sister. Just like Peter is my favorite brother," he said matter of factly before biting into his food.
“You can catch me up later, she seems okay for now…” Tony said tiredly, shifting the sleeping boy on his stomach a little.
“Everyone in high school is two-faced, Xavier.”
“What crawled up your collective asses? Tough shift?” the man asked more sincerely as Sam waved and made his exit. Steve took pity on the guy, and seeing as he was the only one left, felt kinda obligated to answer.
“Sorry, right, not what we’re focusing on. I also obviously don’t care that you’re not blood,” he said, smiling as he heard her hum happily. He kissed her head before continuing.
Did she miss the physical aspects of her wife? Of fucking course she did.
“Oh, I’m not sure you can
“See, now you’ve gone and insulted the host in his own home. I do not like that word, nor do I identify as that. I’m...what did you call it Bruce?” Thor asked as he turned back to the awkward little genius, fidgeting in place and obviously uncomfortable being in the spotlight.
“You girls have a nice evening,” the man said before turning away from the group. Tony felt the tension in his body dissipate as he watched the man make for the exit.
“Do you remember anything before that, Peter? Before your dads adopted you?” Both Tony and Steve looked curiously at Peter, waiting for his response.
His thoughts jumped to the worse possible solution, that Wade was in love with someone else and was waiting for the right time to leave Peter. He was so caught up in his own head, he hadn't noticed Wade was waiting with a tray of bowls for Peter to respond.
When he saw who was inside, his legs nearly gave out from below him.
“Damn, you got me there,” he said flatly, “but…you know she’s not gay, right?”
“Yeah, but…” his Dad said before trailing off in thought. He stared at his shorter parent for a long moment before asking.
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, the universe often liked to prove him wrong.
“You were never in the circus, silly goose,” Bucky said to Clint, gently patting the sober man on his head.
“I love you too,” he assured the panic-stricken man, kissing him again and relishing the smile pressed against his lips. He pulled away to look down at Peter, sure he’d have his two cents to add, only to find his eyes closed.
“I’m sorry about Ashley, Tony,” the blonde started, throwing Tony off a little.
She turned around and sure enough – Staci and her bitches were walking up to her. Cara was hanging in the back, looking like she didn’t want to be a part of this.
“Because I just don’t like cunt, okay?” Steve said seriously.
Maybe she could fight this, she was too old to be getting a spanking…
“No of course not! JARVIS said he made it to his bed. He had crutches and everything, don’t give me that look,” the brunette said with a pout, getting Steve to drop the glare that had settled on his face. And also wonder what Bucky was still doing here.
Joey tightened her arms around him, so fucking thankful he understood. When she really fucking needed him to, he was with her and on her side. Saw the truth and just how terrified she was.
They decided to watch a movie until she woke up, the three cuddled close in the living room as Peter made his way over to sit on Steve’s lap. The blonde looked incredibly surprised and happy for the change in seating, shooting a glance at Tony who was practically melting at the sight. He leaned against Steve, unbelievably happy with his life in this moment.
Shuri looked further concerned as she reassured the quiet teen.
“T’Challa,” she greeted the man after sipping her drink, turning to her favorite General and saying, “Okoye, always a pleasure to be in your presence.” T’Challa only rolled his eyes at that, though a smile was on his face.
“You know I do, cub,” Tati said with a frown, pulling his hair up into a bun as she watched him get ready in his bedroom. “I’ll only be a few hours and then when I come back we’ll head to the gym, okay?”
“I see…” she heard him say, unable to focus her attention on anything else. She heard a yelp coming from her Dad, turning around to see her Pop had swatted him for also staring at the god.
A future he could really see happening for once.
“Yes, call the school if you don’t believe me! I did get detention from my stupid English teacher! I thought…I just…needed a second before babysitting again and then time kind of got away from me…”
“Can we have it when I’m sober?”
“Wha’s wong Unca Tony?” she asked as her Papa walked over to join them.
“Master Peter, Happy is waiting downstairs with the limo,” voiced the AI.
She offered to carry the boy up the elevator, where Tony legitimately offered her a well-paid babysitting position. She looked like she was considering it as they made their way to the living room, laying Peter down next to them to let him sleep a few more minutes as they ordered food together.
“Because,” he started, not stopping to see if Steve was following them, “you could use that time to cool off and seriously think things over.” The blonde tried to not look offended as he quickly caught up to them and begrudgingly got in the backseat behind Joey.
STEVE
“Bambino, come join us in the parlor while Jarvis finishes up lunch for everyone,” his Mom said as she grabbed his arm, squeezing it slightly as she led them to the other room. Harley played with his designated toys Howard had bought him while his mother pulled him along and sat the two down on the couch.
“Holy shit, Jo! That was incredible,” the genius said in excitement, picturing the event and wondering if someone recorded that as they slid into the back seat.
“Daci...you think your Dad needs a...partner?” Steve asked, doing his best to keep the laughter out of his voice at this entire situation. He could tell the five year old was taking this very seriously, if the glare on her tiny face was anything to go by.
“Well, for one Tony dumped him and two because we’re eating dinner and that’s rude?” the teen said incredulously, hands up in confusion.
“Thor I need lightening! Tony, hey can you hear me?” Steve yelled as Thor flew in a moment later, using his hammer to summon lightning and start up the reactor again. Clint suddenly appeared by his side, eyes on Daci who had stood up slowly.
“Oh. See…I thought it was cause you secretly wanted to fuck my dads…?” Jo teased back, the other two turning to the poor boy whose dark skin turned pink at the confession and brown eyes shot wide open.
And when she reached the other side, she simply turned around and kept going. There were times she felt like she couldn’t breathe, but she kept her breaks short before persevering. She wasn’t sure how many laps she had made, losing track of time when she realized she was no longer alone. And she learned that from the feet dangling in front of her underwater. Pulling up out of the water and taking her goggles off, she saw her Pop sitting on the edge in front of her, smiling down at her.
“Uh huh, Jo, how’d it go with your teacher?” he asked the teen.
“I just wanna–”
“Those are tigers. Their stripes help them hide from their prey so they can sneak up on them. They’re also one of the few cats who swim.” She let go of Clint’s hand to put both of hers on the glass, mesmerized at the sight of the tiger yawning and showing its big teeth.
Until, that is, he walked into the living room.
“-Children are present!” Steve interrupted her in a high pitched voice as the redhead unceremoniously shoved the archer on the couch next to Daci.
“Hey baby,” Tony said with a tired smile as he gently wrapped the boy in a hug. She saw Steve sit next to the two of them on the bed before turning to look at her. He offered a tired smile and a nod in their direction, silently asking her to join them.
“Love you Jo,” Steve added.
“–what about your new science buddy? The one who also went to med school?”
“Hey buddy!” she said with a smile, the tiniest hint of fear in her chest.
big sister and Steve had to resist every urge to punch a wall…while he was still in a hospital.
“Crying already? How pathetic. The Avengers have made you weak. You will learn your place once more. You are a clone that we made, child. You’re not even human. A creature that was built to destroy under command and nothing else.”  The crying only increased as did her desire to have her father come save her. Surely by now he realizes that Vivienne was part of HYDRA.
They saw their old friend sitting near the cracked open door, her eyes sad as she looked up at the approaching fathers. The red head slowly stood up and gave the fathers a silent shoulder-shrug head-shake combo before giving them privacy to try.
Later, after some afternoon delight, they went to tell Jo she’d need to watch her little brother this evening.
“Oh heck yes! Nat and Clint let me do anything I want, unlike
“Okay, I’ll go grab wolf,” she said before racing off to her room. Wolf was sitting on her bed, she grabbed her before making her way to her father’s room. Her Tati was waiting for her, a smile on his face as he pulled the covers back. As she climbed in with him, she squeezed wolf close to her chest and nuzzled against her father.
She avoided looking at him, knowing he could read her like a damn book.
“How could I not??” the shorter man asked while pointing at it. This prompted the blonde to roll the magazine up and swat the man with it. Tony yelped and jumped away, which made Steve reach over to snag the man by his waistband and yank him back onto his lap.
“Do you ever talk to the King and Queen about it?”
“How do you feel about taking the throne?”
Tony gave him a playful glare.
The talking stopped for a while, and a comfortable silence fell over them the last couple miles to the lake. Tony smiled when he saw it and stopped Jarvis. He swung his leg over and got off of his horse, tying him to a tree that was nearby. He didn’t want Jarvis to run away, not that he ever did run away, it was just precaution. “Well,” he said, “this is it.”
Tony took a second to think about the question, and shrugged. “Sometimes, I think.” He said. “Seeing as my brother is only ten and parents are always too busy, it does get pretty lonely.”
Steve nodded back and looked back out to the scenery. He thought it was beautiful. The way everything just sort of blended together and harmonized. He wished that humanity could be the same way. He didn’t understand why the human race always found it necessary to belittle others and make them feel worthless. In nature, every little leaf and piece of dirt made a huge difference in the area, making it seem perfect and aligned. “Do you ever get lonely?” he asked, still looking at the environment.
Tony sighed and rested his head against Steve’s shoulder. “I can’t just do that.” He said softly. “As much as I wish I could, I can’t. I am the prince. I’m taking over the moment my parents die. And, even if that’s twenty years from now, I have to do it. My brother would be way too young to take the throne.”
The prince smiled gratefully and nodded. “I’d like that.”
“Don’t you have a room for that?” Steve asked.
Tony jumped and turned around. “Oh, it’s you.” He said, obviously relieved that it wasn’t one of the towns people sneaking in again. “Good morning, Steve.” He said with a smile.
“That’s what my room should be, but it’s not that at all. They always send people in and out of my room for reasons that are unknown to me.”
“How many times have I told you to call me Tony?” he asked, his voice light and playful, as he swung his leg over and situated himself on the horse.
Steve looked at Tony, smiling. “Maybe they did.”
Steve bit his lip, thinking and weighing out his options. Finally, he sighed and smiled. “Okay.”
“What’s what like, Steve?”
“I’m going to take Jarvis. He hasn’t been out for a while.” Tony kissed his mother on the cheek once more and bowed politely to his father before heading to the stables.
“You never did say why your parents sent you all the way here from England.” Tony said casually, keeping his head forward, but letting his eyes wander on the scenery.
Tony nodded happily. “Yes, sir.”
“To know what it’s like to have nothing, or close to it, and to know what it’s like to have to work for something.” Tony sometimes hated being a prince. He hated having people be nice to him just because they had to, not because they actually liked him.
Tony nodded, really hoping his friend was right. He wanted to please so many people, but he knows that pleasing one person, is upsetting another. It was a no win situation, but he wanted to let everyone win. He wanted to make things equal and fair for everyone in the kingdom. He knows some of the rights that his parents took away from some of the people, but if he gives them back, then he’ll upset his parents and their memories. Tony just sighed, and stayed calm. Having his friend so close and supportive was helping get through one of the hardest times of his life.
“Which horse would you like to take today?” Steve asked.
Tony nodded. “Get Ares and come along. It’s a bit lonely riding without someone there to respond to my ramblings.”
“I mean, Tony.” Steve said, the faintest blush on his face.
Tony shook his head, leaning in close. So close that there was no way his intentions could be misread. “Stop me.” He said softly, looking from Steve’s lips, to his eyes, and back again.
Steve gave one nod and a bow. He turned and found Jarvis’s stall. He untied the horse from the pole and put a saddle on him. He walked him out to Tony and smiled. “Your highness.” He said, holding the reigns out to him.
Steve caught Tony staring at him and flushed slightly, a small smile coming to his face. “What is it?” he asked.
“Yes, mother.”
Steve kept his head forward as well, and shrugged. “I guess they didn’t want to deal with a seventeen year old boy.”
“But you’re unhappy, Tony.” Steve said, resting his head back on the other’s shoulder. “You should be happy. What good it is to live if you’re not happy?”
Tony lifted his head and looked into Steve’s eyes. Searching them for something. Anything, really. They’ve been friends, really good, really close friends for a very long time and, even though Tony was expected to take a bride and start a new generation to rule the country, his heart was hoping for something else. His heart was stuck on a boy with blond hair and crazy blue eyes.
Unfortunately, every good thing comes to an end.
“Good morning, mother.” Tony said politely, going over to her and kissing her on the cheek.
Tony followed Steve up to the rock, sitting next to him. It wasn’t a very big rock width wise, but it fit the both of them on it. “Just about. I try to come as many times a week, or even a day, that I can. I don’t think I’ll make it through the day without coming here at least once.”
Tony turned to look at Steve and returned the smile.
It was a beautiful place. The trees were as bright and as green a tree could get. The lake was still and serene. The only real noises were those of the animals scurrying through the bushes and on the ground. There was a rock that protruded out into the lake, making it a nice sitting place. Trees surrounded the small area, making it seem even more private and hidden. As far as Tony knows, he’s the only person that comes here.
Tony shook his head. “Not yet, mother.”
The morning was colder than usual, and Tony had left his cloak inside. He wrapped his arms around himself and continued walking down the dirt path, his boots crunching the minerals below them. He reached the stables and quickly went inside.
The prince smiled triumphantly. “Very good. Would you like to join me?” he asked.
Tony wasn’t sure how to answer. “I guess it’s always nice to have people respecting you and not talking down to you, but, at the same time, there are always those people who will despise you and wish for your death.” Tony stopped talking, to think a little more and guide Jarvis around the bend. “Sometimes I wish I were a servant, though.”
Steve ran a hand through Tony’s hair and kissed the top of his head. “Don’t worry so much.” He said gently. “You’ll do great. Just go with your instinct. Whatever your first choice or thought is, stick with it, because it’s probably the right thing to do. You’re going to be an amazing King, and you won’t be king for a long while. You have time think about everything.”
“If mother and father find out, I’ll tell them it was my fault you were away from your post and your unfinished work.”
Steve smiled, finding that to be a rather cute quality about the prince. Steve knew the thoughts were wrong, and that he shouldn’t be thinking that way about someone with great power, but he really couldn’t help it. “Well, if you ever want company again just let me know and I’ll be happy to join you.”
Steve climbed right up onto the protruding rock, dangling his legs over the water. “And you come here every day?”
Tony felt like there was more to the story, but he was never one to pry. He’d ask questions, but when he could tell the other person was uncomfortable or upset, he’d just drop it and let them continue whenever they were ready. He did want to lighten the mood though. “I think they knew you’d find your best mate out here.”
Steve just nodded and looked back to the dirt road in front of them. “What’s it like?” he asked.
Instead of stopping him, like Tony had thought he would, Steve brought a hand up to cup the side of Tony’s face and pulled him in the rest of the way until their lips connected in a soft kiss. That kiss was enough to send Tony’s heart racing. Their lips moved together in a fluid motion, as if Steve had been waiting for this moment. And maybe he was. Tony was always too scared to say anything. But here? In his private little corner of the world? Nothing else existed. Nothing else in the world mattered except for him and Steve. He wanted it to stay this way, not having a worry in the world.
“James?”
Steve looked at Tony in disbelief. “Really?” he asked. “Why on Earth would you want that?”
“I know, Steve. I know. I just… I don’t want to disappoint people. What if they try to kill me because I do something they don’t like? What if they raid the castle and then try to hurt Rhodey?” The prince sighed and closed his eyes. “I just… I don’t know; I don’t know if I can lead an entire empire. I can barely set my own life on track, let alone thousands of other people.”
Steve stayed quiet. Of course he wasn’t happy, but he didn’t have a choice. He was uneducated, at least not in the way Tony was educated. He was a servant and the son of a locksmith. His future was set for him before he was even born. He was born into lower class. He wasn’t meant to be successful, but he’d be content with that which was given to him. But Tony, he had a chance to make a huge difference. Once the prince was king, he could do anything he wanted. “Well… not exactly, but that doesn’t matter.” He said. “I wasn’t meant to be happy with my life, but you have a chance to make a huge difference. You can change the laws, making things that weren’t legal, legal, and vise versa. You could be an amazing King and make history as more than just the son of a tyrant King and a materialistic Queen.”
Harley had adopted the role of protective older brother flawlessly, occasionally going so far as to growl when strangers tried to coo at the baby.
“Her first word? My...just now?” she asked as things clicked into place. Tony nodded and the girl felt guilty about joining them. “I’m sorry, Tony, I can go,” she said as she began to stand up to leave. But Tony held his hand out and stopped her.
“Kiddos, they’re called
“Sweetheart JARVIS told us you’ve been down here for hours-”
Tony answered them as politely as he could, looking at his Alpha who was cringing throughout the conversation. The Omega himself was still experiencing a bit of emotional whiplash, but tried to push his feelings aside to help his mate feel better.
“–Steve please just shut the fuck up.” Sam said with his eyes closed, Steve looking offended back at him. Sam finally opened one eye, checking to see Steve did what he asked before speaking more – this time in a much kinder tone.
“Could I...go show Clint this?” Daci asked to no one in particular, working on retrieving the various arrows. Tony looked over at Steve, who smiled and shrugged back at the man.
They sat like that for forty minutes before Peter’s cries began to finally die down.  After realizing Peter had cried himself to unconsciousness, the three began to slowly extract themselves. Steve bent down to pick Peter up, tucking him into his bed with the same gentleness as when he was five. He stood to find Tony and Emerson in a half-hug, the pair looking sadly at the tortured teen.
“Barnes.”
"Alright, well, what do you suggest then, smarty pants?" Wade just smiled at him before rolling his eyes.
“Just be gentle, Steve. He’s not made of glass and is full of the best kinds of pain killers. In fact, call mister sass-mouth out if he tries to milk this too much,” she said with a wink. Steve laughed along with her, knowing they had worked together before this…and also knew his husband well enough to know that man has a
“Wait…this is the same Cara you fell in love with in first grade?” the blonde asked slowly.
"I think so," she said as she held the kitten to her chest. "Now I just gotta think of a name for him."
Strucker.
“You want whipped cream and chocolate shavings?” Steve interjected, moving back to the counter that had the ingredients.
“Counter offer. Sex first, drop it later.”
Tony shifted a little to lay his head on his husband’s shoulder, smiling as the man responded by gently kissing his face a few times.
They sat quietly for another few minutes, Steve again waiting patiently for her to make the next move.
“What? You’re gay?” Miles asked as he rubbed his arm.
“Sweetheart I don’t think this is something you should be worrying about. That’s kind of adult stuff,” he said, immediately grimacing when he saw the offended look on her face.
She was good with a gun, but no adults like to watch her shoot them.
"Alright Miles, I think it's time to relinquish the litter," the brunette said as he offered a hand to the youngest. Miles pouted a little before carefully putting each kitten down. He made sure to do it slowly, sticking his bottom lip out as he looked at their Dad in hope. The genius raised a brow at him, getting a laugh from the others. The five year old rolled his eyes as he grabbed his dad's hand and joined the family making their way out.
have learned that from Peter…but he was in enough trouble and she didn’t have much time. She took the opportunity to send a quick text on the ride down. She was eternally grateful Steve insisted on being prepared – remembering the extra pairs of socks and shoes in one of the closets downstairs. When the doors opened on the ground floor, she quickly finished dressing before she made her way onto the nearby street, feet not stopping.
She’s tied in a chair but her eyes and mouth aren’t bound and she licks her lips as her eyes find their intended target. The owner of the cologne smell and the man who experimented on her.
And then, the worst pain she had ever experienced commenced. He was stronger and taller than her Dad had ever been.
“Daci, Petey, come on. We’re going to eat at the restaurant here before seeing the other animals,” Steve said as he pushed a stroller still filled with Harley towards the restaurant. Peter and Daci followed the others, frowning at seeing Vivienne and her father already seated waiting for them.
“If he was good enough, he’d show up on time,” his knight in shining fucking armor - currently sporting the sports jacket Tony had bought him along with a deliciously tight pair of dark blue jeans - said apologetically, stepping up to the empty seat. “Sorry I’m late, babe. Traffic was hell,” Steve added to the silent group, Tony trying desperately to resist the urge to blow this man right here in front of everyone.
“Yeah, guess I gotta catch up to you guys,” Tony said as he downed the whiskey without even making a face.
“Thank you, Banner,” Steve snapped, not feeling guilty as his genius friend – who is also not a parent – made his way out of the room.
“Seezer?” Peter asked adorably, Tony immediately kissing his cheek in reassurance.
“Steve!” Tony hissed as Steve looked back at him confused. He had every right to be angry right now. Tony shook his head furiously, maintaining eye contact as Steve felt himself slowly relent.
Bucky pushed the food aside and sprawled out next to his boyfriend, the two lying quietly while staring at the clouds above. The silence lasted several minutes as they sat in comfortable silence, until his boyfriend quietly broke it.
They trained for half an hour before she asked to spar. Which was also a lot of fun. Clint was well trained, Tati had read her his file. And if the last half hour was anything to go by, he had a lot of experience with hand to hand combat.
“I dreamt…” she began before turning to rest her head on his shoulders to be heard more clearly, “I dreamt that Stone guy killed you. He blew up your car. And…it was just like in Dad’s dream when…I couldn’t do anything to stop it.”
He’d only been in love once with his high school sweetheart, Peggy, who died two weeks before graduation in a horrific car accident. It’s what made him decide to enlist instead of going into the art school he had gotten into. He regretted it later when his brother enlisted with him and broke both their parents’ and their little sister’s hearts.
“You got me…a pokeball?” he asked incredulously.
“My parents will be home this weekend. Also I’m not throwing a party just so you can make out with Rumlow.”
“Tony’s fun,” she countered again, this time getting a smile from the blonde.
“Barton will be alright, he’s a lot tougher than he looks.” Bucky snapped his head towards Fury, wondering when he had gotten here. The older man offered him a small smile as Bucky actually gave him one in return. “I want to apologize about Vivienne and inform you we found a few other HYDRA moles after what she did. You did good work Barnes, you and your kid are officially under SHIELD protection and I hereby immediately promote you to official Avenger status. Welcome to the team.”
“Nicely done, Daci,” Clint added with a matching smile, coming to stand next to the redhead. Daci blushed once more, feeling a little awkward and standing up off Bruce’s lap.
“The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen - ”
she thought to herself as she noticed Isaac was suddenly out of the pool, somehow sans floaties and running to the deep end where his fathers suddenly noticed, panicked and screamed to swim to him just as he jumped in,
He was left with Nat and Clint, as the other medics had left, who looked almost as pissed as Sam had seemed. He wondered how much time he had before Fury possibly fired him to find out exactly what happened, when of course their radios went off and they had to leave for a call.
Emerson tried to stage-whisper back but kept breaking with giggles, shaking her head, “WHY would I want to know that?”
“Nat! Five year old right next to you.”
Steve moved an arm to wrap around his husband's shoulder, the genius leaning his head on his shoulder as he reposition his daughter on his lap.
“Our son,” Tony breathed out, before taking on a more serious tone, “who will never date Wade…”
He was sitting next to Sarah and Helen, drinking coffee with the ladies Sunday morning while Steve and Joe had gone fishing. Aunt Peggy was out of the country for the weekend and he was thoroughly enjoying spending the weekend at the Rogers’ home. He had opted out of sweating in a boat with two grumbling men in favor of leisuring around with his grandma and future mother in law, who was getting better and better everyday.
“I would counter the opposite…” Steve felt his blush spread to his ears and a smile quickly spread across his face.
“Alexandra, we call her Lexi. She’s in college on the other side of the country,” the older teen said. Clint turned back around and was pleased to see the brunette smiling back at him. “So,” Bucky continued, “are you going to tell me the real reason you’re here?”
“You’re right about that, but by the time I get there it won’t be a multi-million dollar weapons company. It’ll be a multi-
married. As in,
“I will,” Daci said with a big smile before running to the elevator. “JARVIS take me to Dr. Bruce’s lab please.” The sounds of roaring got louder and when the doors opened she flinched at the glass that flew by. “Hulk?” she called out, stepping onto the floor and noting all the broken glass.
“Oh, I’ll talk to Pop about it tonight,” he assured her, failing at ignoring the several other pings coming from his phone.
“I’ve got my sources,” she said after swallowing.
actually a good thing. And so was living part time with Wade. And doing Spiderman full time. Totally not ‘yell worthy,' right?
The tired dad smiled before he sat near her on the bed, noting her red rimmed eyes and tear tracks left on her cheeks.
They bid their teammates goodnight when they got off at their floor, Steve taking the opportunity to pinch his husband’s behind. Tony squealed adorably when he did so, turning to glare at the man who suddenly took interest in the ceiling. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see his husband’s hands go to his hips and a pout on his face which made Steve’s face break into a smile.
The adrenaline had worn off as panic and pain set in. And then he heard a groan coming from his left.
With a confident smile, she spread her arms out in invitation, smiling when he returned the smile and quickly squatted down to hug her.
“My parents lied to me,” she snapped at him.
“You too,” he said with a small smile, stepping back and standing awkwardly.
The strong but coiled body around her almost instantly relaxed at that. More cuddly bear and less murderous octopus. He rocked the two for a moment as she felt her body mimic his, relaxing more easily into the hug.
Plus she
“Harley, do you want to come sit on my lap? Maybe let your Daddy breathe for a bit?” Steve asked, surprising Tony as his Alpha sat on the chair behind him.
“Joey, why don’t you take him to your room while I fix you two a snack?”
"So you do want me?" the child asked quietly into Tony's shoulder, the billionaire quickly wrapping his arms around the boy in reassurance.
“Did you know she was alive?” she whispered, praying that he wouldn’t say yes.
Finding none, she took a deep breath before doing as he said, pulling her sweater back up. She didn’t dare pull her pants down, opting to use the cream once they left.
Tony had a flash of anger course through him, taking a deep breath to calm himself down. That asshole could have had this the whole time. Instead he fled like a coward, waltzing back in when he damn well pleased.
“No,” Harley said with a smile, getting a chuckle from Daci and Peter and a groan from the adults. Her Tati came over and sat by her side as the couple kissed their boys in goodbye and made their exit.
until you feel better, okay?” the brunette reiterated, taking turns to look at both of them. Steve glared at him a little, his husband well aware of his anger issue when it came to his family’s protection.
“It’s a date,” Tony said with a blush, taking a step closer to the handsome teen in front of them. The blonde smiled at him and licked his lips, which was all the invitation that Tony needed. He stood on his tiptoes as he grabbed the man’s face with his hands, kissing those absolutely perfect lips.
son strongly dislikes the idea of the little peanut...but I know for a fact he’s going to love this baby almost as much as we will. Harley just needs time, my love.”
He directed Tony to the cemetery Bucky was buried at.
She had made friends with one of her Dad’s coworkers, an eighteen year old that had just started in construction. He was super chill and nice and hung out with her sometimes while Dad was at work and Steve was away in art school.
Peter’s fingers clenched into tight fists, anger spreading through him. Emerson quickly stood her ground.
"Run that by me again," the super soldier said as he started to unwrap the tape on his hands. His husband had interrupted his workout, but not of course before gawking at him for a few minutes before interrupting him and his punching bag.
,” Clint said with a raised brow, smiling when the girl ran back inside. James’ hand came into view as he helped the blonde stand up on his feet.
“-wait, what? Steve what does that-”
“Woah, do I...fuck am I really that hot?” Tony asked with a smile, laughing when his boyfriend groaned in annoyance. “No, but seriously could I commission you for something? Or would it be too weird to have you draw yourself naked? I mean, the image that comes to mind only requires two full length mirrors…” Tony rambled before Steve cut him off in his favorite way ever. He smiled into the kiss as the blonde took the sketchbook away and pushed the brunette back against the bed.
"I don't want to wait anymore," Clint said excitedly. "Come on, let's go get hitched," he added, grabbing his fiance's hand and leading them away.
“Look, it’s down to two pieces of jewelry, suffer with your best friend a little longer.”
Happy was waiting for them outside as he gently guided his still quiet husband to sit in the backseat. Once inside, Happy started driving them as Steve pulled his phone out to look at the pictures again.
If they wanted to have a conversation then dammit they were going to start it – eternally grateful Tony eventually began.
, she thought to herself, looking over at the stack of children’s books the Starks keep down here. “Or I could read to you?”
Of course he was making it up in his head.
“I need to practice, you’d be doing me a favor,” she spoke up again, walking over to the books and wondering if he’d fall for it. He was looking pretty sleepy and maybe if she could read to him he’d fall asleep and turn back into the doctor.
“No but you’re going to tell me anyway,” he muttered.
“Thanks for the ride Happy,” she says before shutting the car door and heading towards the elevator. She hates people. Doesn’t understand why her new fathers were trying to get her to “trust” more. Those stupid girls from her class tricked her into inviting her over; a promise of friendship in exchange for – gossip? She bitterly thinks of their stupid and unoriginal questions – about people she considered “uncles”…not to mention said questions were sexual and completely gross in nature.
“He’s right,” Steve’s voice startled the both of them, turning to the blonde who had a sleeping husband fully on his lap. He didn’t realize the others had been listening in to their conversation. “Daci, we’re all just happy you’re back.” Thor and Bruce also offered them a smile.
Steve found himself smiling at that.
“Xa–”
Thanks for reading! <3
“Yeah, can I...can I talk to you for a second?”
“And yet you always wake up happy,” Tony countered, smiling at the adorable pout his son gave in response.
“He’s done it before…but I didn’t think…he moved to Scotland…” Tony said as he brought his hands up to his face, unable to continue.
"Nice try kiddo, but you have school tomorrow."
I was changing your dirty diaper. And when you made me read Green Eggs and Ham so many times I started reciting it in my sleep?” he took the time to pause, glad to see her smile at that. “Your first word was ‘dada’ but you know what your third word was? Seeb.” She laughed a little at that, curiosity reading across her face.
“- drugged you. Yeah. Nat told me.”
An idea started to roll in her head, but before she could think further her father was hugging her and kissing her on the top of her head before following the others towards the elevator.
and telling her in person like Steve had asked.
"M'not a baby," she slurred as Tony waved goodbye to Bruce and followed Steve and Emerson back to the elevator.
“Have you...been thinking about this a lot?”
“Ya know, every since you two started calling me that I catch myself doing it all the time. At school? My feet tap against the desk. Breakfast time? Tapping the stools! Watching a – stop laughing!” she declared with a smile, the super soldier trying to catch his breath.
“Out of all of that, I think I’m most offended by him calling Leo a sissy,” Pete said honestly, smiling when his husband threw his hands up in agreement.
He finally released her, turning her around to face him as he rested a hand on her shoulder.
a third party might help…” He laughed a little at her deep sigh and small huff.
“Daci?” he asked his girl, hating himself for the blood staining her hair. She still had a pulse - thank God but she could very well still be the soldier. Just because blunt force trauma snapped him out of it didn’t mean it worked the same for her. But Buck knows he’d die for this girl, so he remained protectively over her and assessed her body for other injuries. “Take Clint back to the quinjet,” he said solemnly, well aware Steve would oblige his request. It wasn’t safe to move Daci yet and Clint needed immediate medical attention. Plus...if anyone should save his daughter it should be him. He got them into all of this mess.
“We discovered we have a soulmate bond,” Steve clarified, loving not only the change in atmosphere from hard to soft,  but the warmth of love he had for his mate. His soulmate.
“Hi there little one,” Clint cried out, not caring of the free flow of tears as the puppy began to wake up and started licking his face.
"Wanna wave bye to your Uncle Rhodey, kid?" Tony asked the boy who quickly complied. His friend gave the genius a knowing look before showing himself out, having mentioned to Tony beforehand he couldn't stay long. The genius carefully stood up with a suspiciously still child, wondering if he was asleep before moving him around to check his face.
Peter joined him on the bed with a stuffed lion in his arms.
"Thanks Flower," she said after pulling him in one more time to kiss his cheek.
“I have a favor to ask,” Buck said bluntly, continuing when she raised a brow. “Can you help me keep an eye on my boy?” he asked, nodding in the direction of the blonde taking his first shot. “You know, make sure no one - including Stark - molests him?” She laughed a little before responding.
The blonde couldn’t help but smile as he heard their son cheer in the background.
Which obviously is not in any way the worst thing in the world, but the men had selfishly relished in the idea of more alone time together. Plus their jobs were hard enough on Peter, who knows what the idea of that could do to a little boy who'd just lost his mom. He might not even like the idea of living with two gay men or he could get backlash at school - not to even mention the backlash from the infuriating media. So he and Tony talked and talked and talked finally deciding to wait to meet the boy before making any decisions.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Bucky asked, more in exhaustion than any real anger. If the tables were turned, he doesn’t know how he would tell Clint….
“Please tell me you haven’t been hitting on the nice paramedics,” Pepper said as she stared at the ceiling.
It was a warming sight and a pleasant distraction from missing her wife.
“Dat’s bad Unca Cint! We don’t say shut up,” Harley suddenly spoke up, pointing an accusatory finger at the archer.
Peter was finally able to snap out of his shock enough to run after him. He was surprised by the boy’s speed, only catching up to him down the street.
“– I’m sorry!” she blurted out, interrupting him. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion at her outburst and continued as she rambled.
look that always had his genius admitting defeat.
“Alright, fellas, lay off the poor girl. Lord knows you two poke her private life enough as it is.”
When Peter didn’t respond, Tony stole another look in the rearview mirror and frowned at the sight. Pete looked on the verge of tears.
“Sure,” she said with a shrug of her shoulders, still getting rid of the sleepiness as she watched him walk to the bathroom. After she took her own turn in the bathroom, the two made their way to the elevator and up to the Starks’ floor.
“I didn’t think juniors were allowed in the senior lab, Parker.” He said it with a smile, so he was hoping he didn’t come in here with any malice.
Those gorgeous blue eyes shined bright with his smile, taking the phone to look closely at the picture. He gently pulled his other arm from around Em to feel the back of his head, smiling further at the realization.
“Buck…you okay?” the blonde asked with concern. His brother looked in the direction of the bathroom, waiting to hear running water before responding.
“No, no of course that’s not a deal-breaker,” the genius said in reassurance, counting this as the perfect time to admit his own secret.
She pulled her ragged dress back down and hurled herself up off the filthy mattress, feet making contact with the cold concrete floor. She looked around the room before her eyes fell on a window near the door. She didn’t have time to think as her legs moved for her. Not caring if they could hear her, only knowing that she had one shot before one of those perverts came back to continue this cycle. She was able to slide it open, ignoring the squeaks it made. Her feet made contact with grass when she heard the door open and then the roar of those monsters. She ran. Not looking back, not caring that she was barefoot and some of the trail was rocks, she ran and ran and ran until she reached her destination.
“Tony!” Morgan interrupted them with a shout, causing Tony to freeze around her. A laugh escaped her chest, pulling away from the man and laughing harder at the betrayed expression on his face.
His husband knew that too, which was why he was currently growling at the super soldier. Steve ignored him in favor of sitting on their bed and patting the comforter next to him. Tony leaned his head back and groaned loudly at the ceiling, getting a chuckle out of the blonde.
He pulled his phone out to send the text and it didn’t even make it back in pocket before he got a ding in response. ‘Pick me up at ten’ was all it said. Bucky needed new friends.
“Sure, Clint. If you remember this conversation when you’re sober then we can continue this discussion,” Bucky deadpanned as he reached a hand out in invitation. The shorter teen took his hand and moved to stand next to him.
EMERSON
But she’s done this before, and now she’s been put on the internet – just as Steve had warned her not to. She wasn’t even guilty and her Pop would probably lose his job over this.
Thor was quite the spectacle to the young girl. He had come by for breakfast, rummaging through the pantry for his stash of pop tarts, not noticing the teen staring at him in awe. Steve hadn’t been aware of his arrival and was surprised to find he had simply showed up to the Tower one Saturday morning. Emerson had woken up first and was thoroughly surprised by the Asgardian in the kitchen. When Steve had joined them shortly after, he was utterly surprised to see the two laughing and finishing off a second box of pop tarts.
“Well, then
The feeling in his gut only worsened when the tall youngish stranger and his two friends made their way over to them.
“Because…because your mother never forgave me for your uncle’s death…and then when she found out she was pregnant…she swore you and I would never meet. And your dad kept her wishes. By the time I found out what happened to your father…it was too late.”
"Oh honey you don't think you guys are American royalty? Besides, how beautiful can she be?" He watched as Emerson pulled her phone out to show the young hair dresser a picture of Shuri, as the woman comically winced at the photo.
“And when she died…well…it didn’t work out with Jerry. So I was angry. Because my baby was ripped away from me – the only thing that gave me hope. And that’s when I heard you confess. You had nightmares and talked in your sleep. I found out about six months after she died, heard you saying it one night. So I scrimped and saved what I could and – with the help of some friends and…lovers…I faked my death to get away from him. And you,” she paused to choke out a sob, taking a few breaths to compose herself before continuing.
“Sorry Clint,” the teen said against Tony’s shoulder, “but Natasha taught me how to properly kick a man in the balls.” The red-headed medic looked pleased, Tony able to read her last name “Romanoff” on her uniform. Before Clint could counter, they heard Steve walk in to join them as the officers bid them farewell.
“My mother is on standby if you need any help, though I’m sure Pepper is more than capable of handling it,” she shot him a smile, which he maturely returned before sticking his tongue out. “I also wrote down his pediatrician’s number in case that rash comes back.”
“Whatcha making?” she asked.
“Like it? It’ll prevent you from misbehaving. Which, speaking of,” the man paused to actually tsk-tsk at her, “I believe we taught you better than that, girl.”
“That being said…” Wade said in betrayal, looking everywhere but at Peter.
“What?” she asked because what on earth was he talking about? “No,” she answered before turning over to bury her face in the pillow again.
"Oh don't be so immature, Tony. I got your messages and came to check in on our son." Tony could feel his anger spiking as he shut down his work to face the asshole. Both so he could focus his anger and also in case Ty had ulterior motives for coming to his workshop.
“I…that’s kind of a private conversation,” Cara said nodding to her best friend beside her.
"What are you doing crazy pants? Trying to break every bone in your body? That was really dangerous and you should never, ever do something like that again, okay? Just because I jumped doesn't make it okay for your tiny self to jump and end up in the hospital, do you understand me?" Wade finished a little more calmer than his initial panicked reaction. Peter felt his eyes get a little misty when Miles quickly nodded before throwing his arms around the man's neck.
“Hey, what’s wrong kiddo?” Tony asked kindly, looking her in the eyes with concern. She looked back at the bath and sat in silence a little longer before Tony spoke again. “You know, after Afghanistan I wasn’t able to let water touch my face.” She looked back at him after that, having forgotten about Afghanistan in his file.
"He's fuck-face's kid?" Tony asked incredulously, ignoring the glare from the two.
“Invisible?”
“-you’re not getting out of babysitting, Barton. Up and at’em,” the older brunette said, shaking his free hand at the other man again. Clint stole a look at Daci, who was secretly hoping he’d join them, before grabbing the man’s hand to stand up fully.
Maybe...maybe the two would even go to prom together.
Joey paused, still hugging him close as she regained her balance. “And there’s nothing wrong with being spoiled in hugs. It just means you’re adorable and loved. So anyone that tries to make fun of you for being spoiled? They’re just jealous they don’t get as many hugs as you, Peteroo,” she finished with a loud kiss to his cheek. He giggled again and tried to escape.
DUM-E rolled up to him with a glass of water, the ever helpful bot. He looked around his lab before taking the glass and downing it like he had the scotch.  His smartass remark he had prepared for the robot was quickly interrupted by the dizzy feeling followed by the quick collapse to the ground.
,” he finished in Romanian. {
She grabbed her father’s hand as she joined the others in the elevator, wondering when she'd get to hang out with Hulk again.
– which is why I invited him over for dinner.” She didn’t have time to be surprised at that, as he continued with his little speech.
“She didn’t know about me using Oscorp labs, Dad,” his son said with a groan.
“I know you’re struggling with your identity, with knowing who you are. Your past and present collide and it fucks with your PTSD.” He sat back to look at her, wiping some of the tears from her cheeks with his thumb. “Everyone your age struggles with knowing who they are, but you have the added lifetime of trauma you’ve experienced in your first fifteen short years. I know… I know what it’s like struggling with accepting your past. Wanting to put it behind you with every fiber of your being. What it’s like to be hurt by those meant to love you most,” tucking some hair behind her ear.
And before he could count himself lucky, shit hit the fan.
He collapsed onto the floor before screaming.
“–but that’s the thing, Pop! I didn’t! It was second-hand smoke…on an open field,” she explained in her defense.
“Uno!” she shouted as she placed her second to last card down, skipping her Uncle Rhodey. Sam smiled realizing it’s his turn before frowning, realizing Em was about to win. He took a long moment to look at the numerous cards in his hand. Glaring at the cards before turning to glare at the three people waiting on him; before again turning to look at his cards.
Joey extracted herself from Tony to run to Steve, who stretched his arms and embraced her with a “hey baby girl.” He rubbed her back as she began to calm down. Steve eventually looked up at Tony with a small smile.
“What do you think? Should we just bring these into the living room to eat?”
But right now, she was actually genuinely concerned for her mental health. She had just finished grad school but wouldn’t have gotten through it without her wife. Shuri was her rock, and always knew exactly what to say or do to help her. Not that her parents hadn’t been great…but the love of her life was the love of her life for a reason.
“Well, well, well, do my eyes deceive me? Is that little Ashley Sanchez?” The ring leader in question was sporting a hideous face tattoo and had a wannabe thug vibe to him. The two behind them laughed at his comment, which Peter assumed was some shitty joke. Emerson stood frozen staring at the three, obviously knowing them.
The same parent who was always straight forward and honest with her. Who apparently decided to tell his five year old son first.
"Is that the one?" Miles asked as he somehow held the other five kittens in his arms.
my moves,” Tony flirted back, following the blonde back to the dance floor.
“Huh, so you’re not just a nice knot to sit on…”
[You sure Pepper won’t mind?]
Thoughts of not rushing this flew through his head before exiting his ears. He didn’t even text him a heads up, just running up the flight of stairs to knock on the blonde’s door.
“What? You don’t think I know my own company?” he asked as Jo felt her eyes widen in shock, which only earned a laugh from the adults.
“Just working,” Steve said with a small smile.
"Whatcha drawing, Picasney?" came the voice rough with sleep. Steve smiled at his brother before turning the picture around for him to see. Bucky hummed in approval before glancing back down at his daughter with a smile on his face. "How was school today, punk?" his brother asked as he carefully stretched out below the still sleeping baby girl.
Yeah he was probably screwed. But, like his dads reminded him months ago - he was an adult now. Old enough to make his own decisions.
“Why do I feel like you were a carnie in a past life?” he asked the teen, whose cheeks immediately blushed at the question.
“Yeah well, you’re more important than work. And I thought you could use a cuddle bug right now,” the brunette said as he put his tablet on the nightstand to turn to the blonde. Steve, for once in immediate agreement with his husband’s plans, curled up behind the man to spoon him. His big arms wrapped around the smaller man’s body like an octopus.
“Yeah, which is why I said red. Told you its ninja mind trick time,” Sam said confidently.
“Yeah,” she answered, looking down at her lap.
"Let's go," Clint said, looking up at the love of his life, the man he'd be married to soon. James grabbed his hand with a smile, leaning over to kiss Clint before reaching down for Lucky's leash.
“I’ve thought about taking classes, but no I wouldn’t go back to art school, I love my job too much,” he said as he turned back to put the finishing touches on his picture.
“Miss? Is everything alright?” the AI spoke up when she made no move to leave.
“Tony, you are incorrigible,” his husband complained with his eyes closed, only getting a laugh from the brunette in bed.
Steve,
“What do you want?” she asked sharply, not caring about the hurt look on her face.
“Put your arms above your head, placing your hands on the back of your head and try to sit up straighter. This will allow your lungs to open up more, physically forcing you to breathe more easily.” She followed the AI’s instructions, interlocking her fingers behind her head and kicking away some blankets so she wouldn’t feel so confined.
“Could you get this for me Pete? I’ll pay you back when we get home.” Peter looked down at the book, The Essential Writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. His furrowed brow and frown turned to a surprised smile as he looked back at his sister, laughing and taking the book from her.
She quickly looked around, frowning when she found the source of the injury behind her. Above her headboard there used to hang a picture of her and her Dad. It was missing – most likely falling behind her bed. It left evidence behind with a slight indenture in the wall from the force of swinging her arm back.
He quickly turned in anger, glaring at the two pieces of white trash in front of him, laughing at his expense. Hunter and John Walker, twin football playing seniors whose intolerance has only grown since they joined his grade two years ago. They had always tried to tease him but were terrified of Wade. Now that he’s out of the picture, they apparently saw the first day of school as the opportunity to officially bully him. They were also unaware of Peter’s recent
“Technically Harley won, since you fought dirty,” Pappy said to Steve before turning to the smaller blonde. “And you, you ready to tell me what got ya so angry?”
“In Tasha’s purse,” Clint answered easily, shrugging his shoulders as well. Bucky chuckled and shook his head fondly before addressing him more seriously.
“Daci, ready to go see some wolves?” Steve asked, walking over with his kids and giving her father a weird and angry look before smiling at her.
“Oh, well...he has a few jobs right now,” he answered truthfully, aware he’d never really been able to lie to his Mother. “He works part-time for his grandfather’s gym and part-time teaching pups art at the rec center.” His Mama hummed before continuing, which Tony counted as a temporary win.
“You two are incorrigible,” she said teasingly, getting up and walking out of the room.
His eyes immediately found his teenage brother as a weird sensation suddenly vibrated through him.
“I haven’t really thought about it,” Peter said obviously lying.
“Mhmm. Just cause Dr. Seuss does it doesn’t mean you get to. Your dad and I need a minute to wake up, then we’ll come make you a big breakfast, okay buddy?” Tony could hear the small groan but smiled when the boy climbed off the bed and left the room. He felt Steve once again shift to lie on the bed behind Tony, removing the pillow from his head to plant a kiss on his cheek. The genius was glad when the taller man immediately settled behind him, arms wrapped around the brunette’s waist.
