Steve sighs at Tony’s mischievousness and boops him on the nose. “Just be careful, alright, Tony?”
“Shhhh,” Tony says, hushing him. “Now tell me what’s yours and Steve’s verdict on Project Befriend Loki. Pretty alright, I’m assuming, given I just saw her walk freely in and out of here.”
“No,” Tony said petulantly, tightening his hold on Steve’s waist.
“So,” Tony said with a grin when they parted. Steve reached out and cupped Tony’s face, which was surprisingly warm and red, despite Tony having only taken sips throughout the night, not to mention his normally high tolerance for alcohol. “Shh,” Tony said. “So it’s finally going through my system.”
Tony stops short with four feet between them.
I’m still following up on all the people who Obadiah supplied Stark weaponry to when everybody thought I was dead in the desert.
“Fine. Show me.” Steve gestures with a wave and saunters after Tony, who’s bringing up various screens and statistics from his battered leather chair that's been patched up with crosses of duck-tape.
“Yesss,” She can almost hear the fist bump that comes from the other end. “How many points is that worth?”

how long I’ve wanted to get you alone?” Tony breaths, his voice dropping an octave or two and rasping from the back of his throat. Steve’s not sure if he wants an answer. Steve’s not sure he

“Because you love me?” Steve asks watching Tony make a show of considering it.
He waits, not ready to give up the amount of skin contact, he rubs his cheek on the inside of Tony’s thighs that flinch oversensitive to touch. They stay that way until he feels the tension drop out of Tony’s body.
“I panicked Tony,” Steve puts the bottle down on the desk and starts wringing his hands instead, because
he says, the heat from the bath making him hazy, watching Tony through eyes he’s barely keeping open, leaning into his hand like a cat that’s being scratched behind the ear; he hadn’t even realized he had a headache until Tony’s ministrations stopped it buzzing in his temples.
Tony sniggers against his lips at the thought.
Tony's lips disappear from his as quickly as they came, Steve finds himself staggering backwards in surprise and looking down at a blushing Tony as fireworks start to light up the city. “Err… Happy New Year Captain?” Tony shrugs, Steve had never known him look so unsure of himself as he went to rub at the back of his neck, forgetting that it was damn near impossible when you were still in armour. “Well, I should, you know…” a very pink eared Tony doesn’t even bother with an excuse before he goes to leave. Steve panics and grabs for his arm.
He gasps going back in for another round, rasping his days’ worth of stubble against Tony’s beard.
“You don’t have the monopoly on bad dreams Tony.” It comes out all sniping and sharp edges, not how Steve intended it at all.
Let it be said that Steve Rogers was no fool. He had seen through Tony from day one, every stolen glance and lingering touch they had shared. He hadn’t told Tony why Sharon left him, he had wanted to; felt it on the tip of his tongue when he woke up with Tony sat next to him in bed in the strange limbo between consciousness and unconsciousness where anything seems possible.

go South, they can be civil to each other. Steve will brush off every smirk, every snide comment. He can’t leave it the way it is.
. Steve’s gazing down at him and Tony thinks he could be looking at something painted on the Sistine Chapel roof because – Steve Rogers - he’s a living work of art.
“What do you make of this?” Natasha passes a print to Sam, it’s high quality taken within the last ten years at least, “there are chains on the

that makes the last tentative grip he had on his self-control slip,
The whole scene depicted is unsettling, something about it creeps at the back of Steve’s neck and makes the hairs stand on end. A few downed security staff that look stone dead on the floor in-between an endless sea of filing cabinets. They weren’t dead, oddly nobody had been badly hurt. There were so many variables that didn’t quite add up enough to make sense, and the whole situation had put Steve and Tony back on the same insomnia cycle.
Tony laughs in a shrill uneven pitch, raking fingers through his hair. “I’ll tell
“You’re a bad liar Captain, you always have been.
Because it’s all so broken and Tony’s got Steve’s shield propped against his desk and all he wants is to throw the damn thing out, but it’s all he had left now.
He’s in the smart lighting, the glass balcony over the quinjet bay, the automatic doors and the ostentatious coffee machine.
He watches as Tony’s brow furrows and he starts to pace. Steve has no idea how he’s walking around, he’s still there dumbstruck and dazed against the kitchen counter because it’s the only thing holding him up. “Some files? Do we know what was in them? Right. Yeah, of course, it’s late. No. We’ll deal with it tomorrow.” He hangs up the phone without a goodbye.
He starts to lose his rhythm, kisses are forgotten and he drags Tony in against his chest, clawing at his back trying and failing to stop himself coming. He buries his face into the juncture of Tony’s neck, and muffles the noise that accompanies the rush of heat through his entire body and the sudden, urgent release of pressure that makes his ears ring and his vision swim, he chases the feeling and thrusts until he’s got nothing left to give.
It hits him like a car, makes his body jerk, and every muscle momentarily seize. Talking and breathing, who needs that anyway, he’s gone blind he’s sure. Steve’s made him come like a horny teenager on prom night. He’s still pulsing making it pretty obvious -
“No,” Tony repeated, but he wasn’t as good at controlling his body language while drunk. The sudden tension in his shoulders and arms was a dead giveaway. “Not everything is about him. Why should it be? Who is he, really, that stupid old man who went and -” He choked. “-
Natasha ignored Clint and inclined her head towards Thor. “You have saved him, Thor. You can take this round for Bruce, if you’d like, and eat the Jelly Bean of Indeterminable Flavor since Bruce doesn’t drink. Bruce can spin the wheel for you.”
“Ahh, indeed,” Thor said, and Clint turned to Natasha in triumph. “We have been playing the venerable game of Never Have I Ever, have we not? Apologies. I have been…” Thor glanced over at Bruce and his gaze softened when he found Bruce already looking at him. “... pleasantly distracted. Seeing as I have indeed jumped off a distance greater than twenty-five human feet, I will drink now.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, as Tony declared, “I resent being called a dumbass, though I do have a fantastic ass!”
Steve glances over the ballroom of the Tower, tastefully redecorated with Pepper’s help to transform it from a room left to gather in dust into a ballroom that is elegant, beautiful and still somehow intimate and comfortable. There are around forty people in here, chosen with the help of JARVIS and his database of anyone Tony offhandedly mentioned wanting to reconnect with or was wondering how they’re doing. Steve then invited and sponsored them to come to New York City to celebrate Tony’s birthday.
Tony glanced back at Steve with a wide grin spilling into laughter, so beautiful and bright, and Steve couldn’t resist darting forward and pecking Tony on the lips. Natasha raised an eyebrow and Clint rolled his eyes as he turned away. “Thor, Bruce, a little help here?” Clint asked.
“You do that,” Natasha responded dryly, before grabbing Clint by his shirt and heaving him over to his bean bag chair. She deposited him on it, chest down and head hanging off in case he threw up. She went over to her spot by the fireplace, picked up her glass of champagne, and took a sip as she walked back to the bean bag chair and took a seat next to Clint. “Now, where were we?”
“Lucky, Brucie Bear,” Tony said, before looking at Steve expectantly. “Steve? Mead or champagne?”
Tony froze in Steve’s arms. “Nope. Absolutely not, no, I
Thor understood though, eyes fixed on Bruce’s face as he talked, nodding and inputting his own thoughts occasionally in the same dialect, but mostly just listening with a soft smile like he would be content just looking at and listening to Bruce all night long. Bruce spoke with a small smile accompanied by little animated gestures that he’d stop as soon as he noticed them but which Thor encouraged, and with every input and encouragement and continued interest that Thor showed, Bruce’s smile widened just a little and then so did Thor’s.
Thor took the tankard of Asgardian mead that he had brought back to Earth and poured himself a generous glass, grinning as he chugged it down. Clint groaned in the background upon Thor’s nonresistance against what he saw as Natasha’s cheap shot. “Natasha is a fine warrior indeed, to have taken so many of us down in one swoop. A toast in your honor, may I?”
“Wait, JARVIS,” Steve says, alarmed and scrambling to collect himself, right before it connects.
Steve can almost feel the smile against his ear. “Love you too.”
“But yes,” Tony whispers against him, eyes soft, “A thousand times yes,” and Steve smiles.
The cupcake vanishes just before it hits him.
“You’re not in your right mind right now, Tony,” Steve said helplessly, unsure how to reject Tony’s advance without hurting his feelings.
“What’s Tony making this time?” Steve asks, head tilted towards the ceiling to indicate his question towards JARVIS. “Or better yet,” he amends as he steps closer to the kitchen and the undertone of baked goods becomes overpowering. It was like walking into an industrial bakery working vigorously to reach the deadline of the biggest order of its lifetime. “How much baked goods has he made already?”
When Tony pulled back, there was a satisfied smug sparkle in his eyes that said he knew exactly his effect on Steve. There was also a sweet smile lingering at the corner of his mouth and at that, Steve could only wryly smile back.
He nearly spilled the contents of his glass as he slammed it against the carpeted ground and flipped himself to a sitting position in one move, leaning towards Natasha with great intensity. “There’s no way you made it to the ground-floor shootout unless you made a jump like that!”
,” Tony finally manages with utter betrayal. “Why - I know we label the alcohol and juice for kids very clearly and this isn’t - Steve!”
Steve’s smile faded, and so did Natasha’s.
Steve just wanted to see Tony again. He just wished he had told Tony.
“Alright, alright, thirty seconds to the start of the race,” the announcer says. “Three laps around the track, the first one back wins. We have a nice camera here to judge if it ends up being a close call. Now on your mark.”
At Natasha’s words, Clint made a face like he had bitten a particularly sour grape. He twisted in Tony’s direction for help, but Steve squeezed Tony’s hand warningly before he could open his smart aleck mouth. There was a mild look in Natasha’s eyes that Steve wouldn’t dare cross, much less than want Tony to.
“I loved you, Tony, I really did,” he cried, violent sobs wracking his body. In the background, the breaking news ran, as it had for the past two days. “Forgive me, Tony, forgive me. I didn’t mean to.”
“Hello, Sir Knight-on-the-Bike,” Tony greets, his lips pressed against his ear.
Bruce held up his spun wheel and the jelly bean that he chose, trepidation in his expression as he looked at it. A great weight seemed to have slid off of him when he tossed it into his mouth and nothing happened.
A group of racers is just stepping off when Steve arrives at the track. “We’re just going to watch from afar and make sure Tony’s safe,” Steve says, as much for JARVIS as it is for himself. “Do you see them, JARVIS?”
“Guilty as charged,” Steve admitted with a small smile, tilting his head in acquiescence at Natasha’s clever trap, before untangling his fingers from Tony’s to take a sip from his glass. The wine of Tony’s choice slid against his tongue like liquid nectar and down his throat. Steve had probably jumped out of the quinjet without a parachute one time too many, though in his defense, he knew his serum-enhanced body could handle it.
he still had the habit of looking up whenever he talked to him.
Tony pulled away from Steve and looked up. His eyes were red, his face was a mess, but his expression was serene, kind. He didn’t say anything as he disappeared in pixels.
“So can,” Tony insists, argumentative and apparently not least worried about the once-wanted criminal in his kitchen. “You try it then.” He chucks the cupcake he was holding overhand across the room to Loki.
Steve fell to his knees in the white replica of the room and took off the glasses. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, which Tony had started working on the morning after that night, and which enabled him to hijack the hippocampus to clear traumatic memory.
Well, when he puts it like that...
“Okay, okay,” Steve hears Tony say, as dozens of rows of cupcakes and three baffling trays of muffins covering every available surface come into his view. Tony is standing at the center, holding a cupcake with a bite taken out of it. “So more butter definitely helped keep the moisture, but now it also tastes a little more tough, which I said was going to happen, so
. I did not expect you to invite Loki or for Loki to willingly come talk to you, and she wouldn’t tell me anything even though it’s my birthday!”
Perhaps Steve is giving Tony too little credit. He does seem to be doing well with Project Befriending Loki and Wringing Out The Secrets To His Magic, as he has told Steve after the time he saw Loki in the kitchen. Tony has been most upset that he couldn’t shorten the project name to a nice acronym.
“Never have you ever?” Natasha said with eyebrows raised.
“Hey!” Steve can almost imagine Tony protesting, peals of laughter following him as he zooms after Loki.
“Do you have a fever?” Steve asked, trying to push his panic down, even though he couldn’t remember Tony ever mentioning or displaying any signs of sickness and his symptoms aligned with a reaction to alcohol more than anything else.
“You said something, Stark?” Natasha asked, smile welcoming and warm. There was a glint in her eyes.
Thor, Natasha, and even Bruce gave him a deadpan look. “Okay, okay, I see how it is. I’ll show myself out now,” Clint said. “I see I’m not welcome here.”
“I’ll be happy to, Bruce,” Thor said. He looked at the small jelly bean, dwarfed between his warrior-calloused fingers, with grim determination, most likely recalling all of Bruce’s past horrified reactions whenever he chose wrong, and then tossed it into his mouth and chewed.
“Of course,” Tony says softly, glibness sliding away. He leans up and kisses Steve on the cheek, his goatee scrapping gently against his skin. “Anything for you,” he says. Then, Tony grins. “Now how do you feel about some cupcakes? Preferably by the dozen.”
“I know,” Steve says quietly. “ Can you please help me tell Loki thank you for saving you? I -” Steve swallows. “That was really close.”
“Good,” Tony says, and Steve replies, “Good.”
“Why Tony?” Steve says, and Loki gives him such a disappointed and withering look that Steves couldn’t help but laugh. “I know there’s nothing between you two,” he says before Loki could give him a verbal tongue lashing. “I’m talking about your friendship. I asked Tony about it, but he kept joking about it and wouldn’t give me a straight answer.”
“Ah, that explains how little and slowly you drank tonight,” Clint interjected with a mischievous grin, from one troublemaker with no sense of self-preservation or common sense to the next. “So how is it?”
Steve hums in agreement and then, recalling Loki’s suggestion to let Tony try his drink, takes a sip of his untouched glass of champagne curiously. He smiles when its content touches his tongue, and then, noticing Tony’s fixed gaze on it, passes it to him. Tony takes the glass with a fond thankful smile and Steve watches curiously as Tony takes a sip.
“Anytime,” Pepper says with a smile, clinking their glasses of champagne together. Steve smiles at the third clink he hears, mechanical and clear, which could almost be excused as part of the music currently playing. They drink and talk, and at some point, Pepper glances down at her phone and then up at the ballroom entrance and stares. Steve follows her gaze and spots Natasha walking in, beautiful and elegant in her black dress, looking just the slightest harried from hurrying back from a mission. Pepper and Natasha’s gaze meets across the ballroom, almost as though in a fairytale, and it is unmistakable, the way their expressions simultaneously brighten at the sight of the other.
“But Steveeee,” Tony whined, but Steve wouldn’t budge.
“Super cute,” Tony insisted at Natasha and looked up at Steve for validation when Natasha refused to indulge him. “Right?”
“Reminder that this is
They are just finishing the second lap, Loki in the lead, when several stories of a skyscraper plummet from the sky.
“JARVIS!” Tony hissed, as Steve said, “Tony,
Steve sighed and tilted his head up towards the ceiling, ignoring the inviting wink or smile that Steve knew was blooming across Tony’s face. Despite the many times Tony told Steve that contrary to popular belief, JARVIS was not confined inside the ceiling because he was
. Nope.” As soon as Natasha turned away, Tony whispered to Steve, “Thank you for stopping me before.”
Steve nodded, both because he couldn’t deny Tony and because he was right; Thor and Bruce were cute together. Tony beamed at him, and over his shoulders, only Steve noticed a slow smile curled acrossed Natasha’s face as she watched Thor and Bruce. Noticing his gaze, Natasha placed a vertical finger before her lips, her smile unwavering as she tilted her head in Tony’s direction, and Steve hid a laugh.
“Yes,” he breaths out. He looks at them. “Don’t let go of each other again,” he says, and then runs towards the opposite direction of the race track.
The sheer thrill of Steve seeing him like this, being happy with him.
it was so… ordinary? Well, no, obviously that wasn’t the right word, but… Lying there with Tony, watching the evening slowly melt into night, letting Tony play with his hair while they talked about absolutely nothing… At the time, it felt so familiar and natural, like they did this every day. Steve hadn’t felt anxious about it ending, he’d not felt especially overwhelmed that it was happening at last, he’d not thought about what he was
...But he knew he liked it here.
“Okay, good,” Tony added quietly, not really talking to Steve anymore. Already turning to walk over to Bucky, desperately thinking of how to push past this awful event…
It also occurred to him, in some distant way, that he
“I simply meant-”
...Tony
The fundamental satisfaction of being good for Steve-
“Why would Steve murder you for coming here?” Tony asked, his voice unnaturally level.
And yes, he left another dramatic pause.
Until he found himself wondering what Pepper would think, if she saw his drinking this amount of sweetened caffeine at 6am.
At least
Jesus, he might even have been blushing.
“…Well, I know why you’d be mad about that, too-”
Tony reached for the pill, the way a drowning man reaches blindly for
And then Steve put a firm hand to the inside of Tony’s thigh, and the sensation was so intense that Tony moaned, and tensed into it. Steve carried on pushing his legs apart, that determined confidence radiating from him like the forcefield around a magnet.
“Well, he was wrong-”
…Oh God, he’d fallen in love.
“And, I mean, I don’t mean to sound…” Stape carried on, with a sigh. “But – this company
And then there was the tiniest little groan from the body of the floor.
“No, I really don’t think she knows what that is” Steve agreed “But she’s lying about everything else.”
Tony looked at Steve again. He was smiling, sadly.
He didn’t think for a second that Steve had done
The space was long and narrow, with a door at either end, as well as the one he’d just stormed in through. A row of empty office chairs sat at one long desk, lit only by the white static on the bank of television screens – so, they hadn’t managed to get the cameras back online yet…
...Mostly.
But not tonight.
“Okay, so, what are they like?” Rhodey started, excitedly.
The fear that it was selfish to want for himself, when his love for Bucky was being put to the ultimate test - the guilt that came before he could even consider something beyond ‘making Bucky better’
To begin with, there was the physical reaction. It was like an emotional muscle memory, and instant wall of conflicting recollections and associations that flashed up the moment he saw her-
Which made this the first time Tony could acknowledge that Steve had an effect on him, in just that simple human way. To realise that maybe some of these new ideas and feelings were simply the result of
Maybe he would have the space to see that the whole thing was a disaster, an impossibility – that he’d seriously dodged a bullet by getting out when he did.
“Oh, God, Steve,

, than that…
trust for me, now.
“Well, for what it’s worth, we think this project would benefit from your input,” he smiled, in a perfectly friendly manner that set Tony’s teeth on edge. “And - this is just me - I think this might be your chance to make a real, positive change to the world, which I know is what you really want.”
Steve
“Do you tell
…or maybe he imagined that, or assumed it later…
…Okay, sometimes, made him feel better.
“Careful about being too polite,” Tony warned, playfully. “You’ll end up stuck with all the charity invitations…”
“Oh, but you have to say it now,” Tony teased, kindly
“It would be my best recommendation, if you want to feel most like yourself,” Freddie confirmed. Steve felt his jaw clench.
Which he would’ve said out loud, if he weren’t too stunned to speak.
And, with that, Tony realised that Steve wasn’t some incomprehensible concept or mythical creature. That he
on the ground around them-
Steve felt the way Stape tensed, the sudden air of urgency in the room.
Not that his day needed any embellishments.
He loved Tony. He’d never loved Tony as much or as simply as he did right now. Just hearing Tony talk that way about himself, knowing he felt that badly, that he’d been so hurt-
the dark satisfaction that stirred, at that.
“Okay.” Tony whispered back, not even bothering to visualise the corridor in question – just trusting him. “I’ll spray her, you scare her.”
this felt special, maybe he could hold on to it - maybe even get to
“No!” he warned again, stepping into Steve so that he could use him as a human shield, talking to Peter over his shoulder…
“Well, firstly, I need a plan for answering
He looked up just as an Avengers response van swept into the lot, and then came to a dramatic stop just beside them. Tony allowed a little ripple of relief to flow through him –
In spite of which, Steve was still somewhat surprised when he sat down and flicked through the first few pages - and found that it was immediately reassuring, actually.
In the end, it was

shut down, and cry, and let go of all those awful feelings.
So, Tony slid both of his hands under Steve’s shirt, running the flats of his palms along Steve’s sides – letting himself feel every inch of Steve’s skin, not flinching away from any of the things it made him think. That was… dizzyingly liberating. To just be allowed to feel, to not have to worry about hiding it, not thinking about denying himself or having to repair anything afterwards or having to hate himself for this.
Tony couldn’t bear the thought of arguing with Steve about all of this. Or, rather, he knew he wouldn’t be able to bear it, if it actually happened… He knew, if either of them snapped right now, he wouldn’t really get to say any of the things that kept him up at night. Steve wouldn’t listen, or understand, if Tony tried to explain why he was so hurt. He wouldn’t care. Tony had accepted that, the day he’d received Steve’s letter. When he’d read the line ‘…

… If he lost Tony, he… God, he had no idea what he’d do.
And there was a stab of pure panic right in the centre of Tony’s chest, as his brain leapt to a single conclusion-
“Don’t worry, I’ll go through everything very carefully, and I’ll give you a chance to ask any questions you might have” Janine assured them “And, just to make sure you know – you can
… I mean… Part of me thinks it might be worth considering it as a route in. That it might be useful to know what’s going on inside SHIELD. Maybe even find another Hydra base, since you’re still so edgy about that bunker,” he paused to squeeze Steve’s hand reassuringly, and kept hold of it as he continued, “And, more than that… If this much has changed, then we can’t be sure of anything that’s going to happen, right? I mean, the way you tell it, Loki was drawn to earth's work on the Tesseract, or used it… if that’s already changing, then we have no way to be
No desperation to hold onto this moment. No fear that it would be his only chance.
In fact, it wasn’t until he was actually standing at the gates of Camp Lehigh, breathing the familiar smell of Spring 1970, that Steve realised that he

“How much did they pay you?” Tony enquired.

“Yeah, Peter named it, not my fault” Tony explained, dismissively. “It can be connected via almost any conventional port, and then infiltrate any system it’s connected to. Essentially connecting

“Not just some people. You help lots of people,” Steve corrected… nervously. “And it just… makes me think…” And then he took a little breath – which Tony found unbearably endearing – and added, more firmly, “I should be doing more, maybe.”
He screwed his face up, and threw up a total barrier to that imminent tidal wave of thoughts. He
Then came the wave of friendly memories and heartfelt regrets, none of which he’d built a defence for yet, and then a twist of confused sadness, like trying remember a bad dream-
Tony ran a hand through Steve’s hair, bidding him to lie close again, immediately soothed by the weight of Steve against his body.
And Steve didn’t know whether any of that would find its way into his cycle of recurring nightmares, or if there was still more to hit him, or whether it would be as easy to get over next time…
that…
Images of a potential future with Tony, being able to take care of Tony and make Tony happy… it being okay to need Tony, to let Tony take care of him. Daydreams about kissing Tony, and falling asleep curled up against Tony’s chest, and baring his neck for Tony…
“Steve,” he whispered, his hand subconsciously reaching up to him, even though his body was still too heavy to move. And then he saw Steve’s eyes flash with such naked, vulnerable hunger, and there was an almost painful twinge as Tony’s cock made a valiant attempt to respond – far too soon.
Steve had always been ashamed to want too much, when other people had so little. Always embarrassed to ask for anything, even in his own head. Even if he

Firstly, my apologies, but there will be a slight delay on the next update of this fic. To make a long story short (ish), half my work got pinged by the covid app, everyone had to rearrange their rota at short notice - including me picking up some random night shifts, which has fully blown my sleep patterns 😆 - and as such my schedule changed at the last minute. The good news is that I have a holiday right after that, so I'll be able to catch up again in time for the following update (and, all going to plan, get loads of writing done, so that might even mean I'll be able to update faster after that) But, in the short term, the next update is going to have to get pushed back to Wednesday the 6th of October. Sorry!
He carried on remembering, as he filled the other pan with water, and washed the rice. Mrs Ken and Mrs Sastry. Mickey and Kenny and the little O’Brien kid, who used to run up to Mrs Ken’s stoop with him, mouths watering at the prospect of a warm meal. The nurse’s uniform that his mom used to wear, and her worn out leather work shoes. It had been so long since Steve had thought about any of this. Since he’d felt that happy nostalgia of thinking back to something he’d forgotten he missed… and liking it.

Neither of them even bothered to pretend they were trying to avoid this – that they weren’t both excited about it, completely separate from their professional reason for being here.

And then Steve came to a clumsy stop, sitting with his back against the corner, Tony leaning over him,

You came for this anyway.” She gestures to the file that Natasha has spread out on the desk.
“What did you expect?”
“You better be going in to apologize,” she says tucking a stack of envelopes underneath her arm. Steve winces, it made sense that she would know the whole story already, she was Tony’s confidant and closest friend, “Just to be clear. I’m doing this because I need him to get over whatever it is ASAP. Natasha and yours’ little stunt unearthed something else that requires his attention,” she glances up flashing Steve a tight half-smile as she taps keys in rapid succession.

Natasha’s smile widened.
Loki rolls his eyes and shakes his head at Tony, ignoring the pointed
As much as Steve wants to run to Tony and see for himself, he has a responsibility to the people right now. They aren’t fighting an enemy, this is a search and rescue mission. Meeting up with Tony won’t help, they need to spread out and making sure no one else gets hurt.
Overhead, the announcer speaks. “Hello, hello, dear racing fanatics and audience. As you all have noticed, for the next race, we have a very special guest. Give it up for Tony Stark, who’ll be racing in his Iron Man suit, against his guest called Loki, who Mr. Stark assured us will
“Captain Rogers, care to have a drink with me?” she says, and Steve stares. He and JARVIS have screened forty people for the party and he has personally invited each and every one of them, save for one. He doesn’t recognize her.
He walks around, taking the opportunity to talk to other people beyond when he initially invited them to the party, and just when he thinks about rejoining Tony, a woman in a sleek emerald and black dress stops in front of him.
Tony fishes out his phone. “I’m going to give us all comms to wear the next time we have an event in the Tower,” Tony says. “I’m not used to big brother JARVIS via text messages; overheard announcements or whispers straight into your ears is where it’s at. Jot that down, JARVIS.”
“And yet I recall a certain race,” Loki says, not a hint of laughter in her voice and yet there it is dancing in her eyes, and Steve feels his face warm. He’s really never going to live that down.
“Thank you, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says. Steve thinks he caught a hint of excitement in his voice.
Steve recalls Yinsen, the man who changed Tony’s life, saved it at the cost of his own, and reshaped Tony into the man he is today.
Steve let out a breath, nearly choking with relief. Steve doesn’t know what kind of expression he has on his face, but the father and son pair are staring at him with concern.
s and
“Tony!”
Steve let out a breath. Tony was right, Steve was even the first to admit that he jumped before. He could worry about Tony’s safety, but he could not hold him back from making his own choices. “I’m sorry,” Steve said, and Tony shook his head.
“Oooh,” Tony said to him in a loud conspiring whisper, like a child watching two adults throw obscure barbs at each other with avid interest. Steve placed his hand over Tony’s mouth to hush him, and Tony let out a smothered laugh and pressed a kiss to Steve’s palm before settling down again.
“Should you be watching another woman so intently while your beloved is a mere half ballroom away?” Loki says without glancing back at him, though her tone is noncommittal.
“Indeed, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS intoned from the speakers mounted discreetly in the ceiling. It was almost like talking to the building itself. “At the time, Sir already had utilized nano bots to enable the suits to home in on whoever it was coded for and be deployed on command. It was well into its testing stage when Sir had made the leap of faith. There was certainly no need to worry when the suits’ success homing rate was at a solid 75 percent.”
“Thank you, Thor,” Natasha answered, ignoring small commotion Tony and Steve were making. “But maybe later.” She glanced at him through her eyelashes, head tipped down almost demurely, Steve would say, if it didn’t seem more like a lure of a trap. “The goal here is to get other people plastered, as you’ve realized, Thor,” Natasha said softly. “Getting me plastered right now certainly won’t save Bruce from his fate.”
“Arg!” Bruce winced as he fell, clenching at his own head. Thor immediately hovered over him, hands opening and closing like he wanted to do something but didn’t know what. Bruce’s skin flashed green for a second, but then he took a deep breath in and then out, and the moment passed.
It was late, eleven pm, nearly midnight. JARVIS had lowered the lighting in the house to a mere five percent of its capability, leaving the lights of the New York City skyline to glow like stars in space through the glass walls of Stark Tower that stretched from floor to ceiling. The fireplace in the wall burned like the sun behind the heat-resistant glass, casting a warm glow over the Avengers sprawled in front of it and sending their shadows into a slow dance across the rug-covered floor.
Bruce accepted Thor’s extended hand, his eyes widening just a little as Thor effortlessly pulled him up to a sitting position, before he looked away with a smile. “Thank you, Thor,” he said, looking back at him with wryly quirked lips. “Though, if anything, I think I bumped into you.”
Bruce was saying something to Thor, audible to Steve only because of his serum-enhanced hearing, and even then, he couldn’t understand what Bruce was saying. He was speaking in another language, something South American, Steve wanted to say, maybe a specific region’s dialect, but he couldn’t be sure.
Tony would have said with a chuckle,
The piece of building crash landed, cratering the earth below instantly. Debris and dust exploded outward. Steve can’t hear anything, can’t breathe. He’s running for the race track as everyone around him screams silently in slow motion and tries to evacuate. His eyes are glued to the spot where he has last seen Tony, a flash of bright red beneath the blast.
“Amazing,” Loki says dryly, “there’s no difference at all.” He raises his hand with the cupcake, and Tony warns, “Don’t you dare -”
It sounds significantly less sarcastic than Loki probably intends, and she realizes it too. She glances back at the ballroom and Tony is nearly where they are.
“Sir is at the starting line with Mr. Loki,” JARVIS says. “It seems like they intend to race each other. If you head a hundred paces to your right, you’ll be able to see them better.”
Natasha waved him off. “Go. We both have dumbasses to take care of.”
“Thank you for saving my son!” A man appears, pulling the kid into his arm. “Are you okay?” he asks the kid, checking over him desperately. “I’m so sorry I let go for a second.”
“JARVIS, what’s the situation? Did you call for backup?” Steve asks, finally regaining some semblance of control.
“Never have I ever jumped off a building higher than twenty-five feet without gear or equipment,” Natasha said, finally looking up from where she was idly running her hand through the plush rug. She picked up her glass and gave the amber liquid in it a swirl, a slow conspiring smile inviting them to share an inside joke on her face as she looked in Steve’s and Clint’s direction.
This wasn’t even the queasy feeling that occasionally got the better of him, when he tried to think of the influence that
The first time he’d
“I still think you should’ve said you had a date tonight” Bucky muttered. Steve snapped to attention, and shot him a not-very-subtle glare. “What?” Bucky asked, faux innocent. “Just because Nick says you don’t have

He didn’t know why he should want to pick it up again, seeing as he could already visualise it perfectly… But something about it pushed him to his still shaky feet and powered him through those few floaty steps to the work bench.

Tony felt his vision darken at the edges, all of his senses growing sharper and narrower, focused entirely on Steve. He recognised the ache that began to pulse in his jaw. He swallowed hard, a strangely familiar, rich, sweet taste…

And then he felt Tony’s hands on his shoulders, bidding him,

“But you would attack me now, wouldn’t you?” He challenged. “Verbally, at least. You’d shout, and swear now – an expression of your emotions. Not an argument. And that will have no effect on me, I’m afraid. I’m beyond social ideas of shame and superiority, now. Put simply, I have no concern over whether you’re better than I am, or what you think of me.”

The feeling of release was dizzying, flooding straight to his head. The world exploded into white, and for a fraction of a second Steve thought he might actually pass out-

Steve repeated the question in his head.
And, to make matters worse, he really couldn’t read Tony’s reaction. Steve felt like he could find every emotion, from elation to visceral discomfort, if he looked from a subtly different angle…

“Hey,” Sam hissed, from a few dumpsters down the line. Tony looked over to see him crouching, peering between two of the bins, waving for Bucky and Tony to join him. “There’s a back door,” he explained, moving aside so that Tony could see for himself.
By the time Steve had finished the story it was
He knew he should be relieved at that. And, in fairness, there probably would have been a lot more guilt and panic to deal with, had Tony said something else… So, that made it a comfort of sorts, he supposed…
And then he felt his arms go limp, and belatedly recognised the sound of Tony unclasping the cuffs.
And then the elevator stirred again.
Steve had spent most of that time thinking through the familiar cycles. Anxieties and fantasies that he’d run through so many times, it was like he’d worn grooves in his head – which just made it easier for every train of thought to run that same way.

Tony, in the last six months… being so hurt, and not knowing how to be. Not being able to reconcile a life’s experience with something he just felt. Telling himself that he couldn’t be hurt and shouldn’t be hurt and could never show that he was hurt…
And, by the time Tony’s head appeared again, Steve could see that his amusement was bubbling up to that tipping point again too…
“So, don’t think about it right now,” Steve offered, almost eagerly. That tone a kid uses when they think they’re winning the argument,

Tony gave his palm an amazed little smile, and then glanced back to the Bunsen burner, still roaring nonchalantly in the middle of the desk. With his uninjured hand, he reached over and turned the gas off, and then gathered up the fragments of whatever it was he’d been working on – unrecognisable, now that he’d angrily thrown it across the floor. Then he cast a final glance over the various pieces of body armour that he had laid out on his workstation, and decided it was probably a good time for a little break.
“Because - your father had… He had more samples of the super soldier serum with him, when he died,” Steve managed, finding it so hard to force the words out that they seemed to tear his throat on the way up - but he carried on with it. He
That heat grew, spreading through the small of his back. His cock throbbed hard, as all of his fantasies of the last few days came back to him.

He felt awful for making her worry all day, and upending her plans.
But, at this point, Steve wasn’t really thinking of it as a

Tony breathed a heavy sigh, and propped his elbows on the desk, and let his head fall into his hands. The temptation to give into that instinct was growing by the second…
Maybe he

he could say would make things worse than this.

Steve stopped, watching anxiously as the punching bag rocked violently against its restraints, feeling strangely distant from the pounding of his heart or the burning in his lungs. For a few seconds, the only thought in his head was,

And with that revelation came the raft of memories and fantasies that had stirred just below the surface for days.
Eventually, the physical need for oxygen overwhelmed his excitement, and Steve was forced to stop for a minute. Nervously, he glanced up to check Tony’s reaction… and felt that same nameless
Tony looked at Steve.
She broke off with a gasp then, raising her eyes skywards, like she just wanted to give up on the whole thing,
“We need to get up to the third floor.” Tony explained fluidly – pointing in the other direction entirely. “Well, actually, we need to get up to the fourth floor, but, you know, third floor first.”
He ran his hands over Steve’s chest, pushing his shirt over his shoulders, as Steve sat up just enough to help him, exactly in tune with Tony’s movement.
“Oh! You should go to an assembly!” Possibly Trish announced, and her girlfriend rolled her eyes.
“Because this way around is weird and uncomfortable?” Steve guessed. A laugh bubbled over Tony’s lips before he could stop it, more surprise than amusement, and he had to hastily drop his face into his hands.
He liked that he
Before he’d even opened his eyes, there was that awareness… and, for a second or two, it was
He pulled the office chair back and fell into it with too much force, causing it to slide back in a fashion not exactly in keeping with the mood. Irritably, he pulled himself forward again, suddenly filled with an energy that he was still too dizzy and weak to do anything with.
In this chapter, Tony will tell Steve (in a reasonable amount of detail) about the night that Obie turned him, and the trauma he lives with as a result. This does delve into some reasonably heavy themes, and contains dialogue that may be upsetting to people who are uncomfortable reading about emotional or physical abuse. It also describes what Obie did as a non-consensual, intimate, physical assault. If you have any squicks, triggers or concerns regarding these themes, I would urge you to read the end notes before you continue.

...So, what did it matter if he kind of wanted to?
…Which was another potential enlightenment he’d have to pencil in for another time.
And then Tony remembered himself, and shyly dropped his eyes.
Until at last Steve tensed against him, burying himself deep inside Tony and letting out an anguished moan as he came. Tony felt his stomach tighten just hearing that sound, too overstimulated and overwhelmed to process the spike of arousal it sent through him. He whited out for a second, a dead weight against Steve’s still heaving chest.
“No,” Steve murmured, with a shake of his head.
That Pepper was
And something else as well.
There was barely the ghost of a smile before he added, “but it’s more comfortable than the clothes I came out in, so I might just stick with this ‘till we go home.”
Steve’s day had been perfect anyway.
And shifted
He’d even come up with a list of questions - which he’d repeated to himself so many times that the rhythm of them had started to irritate him.
“Well… Most of the notes I have on his recovery are from Wakanda, where they
“Ur-hur…” Steve cuts off with a yawn and pulls Tony’s arm across his chest.
Behind closed doors, it’s all clothes being ripped apart, muscles, sweat, bed sheets being destroyed and that one time they did it in Tony’s workshop and Steve put a dent in the metal bench.
“Yeah… Absolutely,” Tony pushes away. His eyes dart around the kitchen, looking at anything but Steve, “I should -
Apart from the occasional snort of laughter from Sam at the juvenile graffiti that covers the walls, they walk the rest of the stairwell in silence. When they arrive, the top floor’s no better than the rest, no windows, a singular fluorescent strip light hanging awkwardly off the ceiling and insistently blinking on and off. It wouldn’t have provided enough light for the whole corridor even if it had been functional.
“What’s going on here Steve? I don’t… Look,
Tony for it?”
“Oh…” Tony fidgets, “I’m sorry to hear that… You OK?” Steve shrugs, opting to change the subject rather than answer.
He came back around from his thoughts realizing his feet had carried him to Tony’s workshop.
he doesn’t really care
Tony would almost look smug if his eyelids didn’t droop when he looks up at Steve waiting for his reaction.
It leaves a bad taste in his mouth, and it’s enough to make Steve restless, falling into a bad sleep that’s plagued with flashing images mixed up with memories; he can hear Bucky again, screaming this time, but he’s in a labyrinth of corridors made from filing cabinets the locks warped and broken like the ones in Howard’s warehouse. He skids around corners on his bare feet shouting:
He wasn’t going to give in to this feeling. He could be stronger than it…
He eventually pulls on a pair of sweats, muttering a little pep talk to himself, that
“An old friend’s visiting,” Her face warms, then drops a little, “Paying her last respects to Coulson.” She says bowing her head at the somber note.
“Fury would have called if it was something we needed to attend to.”

and Steve gags at the fullness in his mouth because the angle’s all wrong, he chokes again and feels the saliva leaking out the corner of his lips. He adjusts his position slopes a shoulder and glances up, there’s eye contact, something they hadn’t had in the kitchen, Tony looks down a mixture of awe and desperation in his eyes.
Steve is tuned into every sound;
I think we all know where this was going...
There’s a hand splayed on the small of his back, Tony’s steadying himself and Steve notices for the first time how his breath is grating, and he feels a twinge of selfishness in his chest because all he’s done tonight it take; he quickly forgets all of it when Tony adjusts his angle. Steve tosses his head back and gasps, tries to speak against the sound of two bodies slapping against each other, the jangle of his tags and the repetitive creak of the bed.
he says breathlessly.
“What’s the matter Cap?
Tony gapes at the sight, he knew Steve was big everywhere but…
Tony’s circulating like the socialite he is; Steve’s not seen him short of company once tonight, not that he’s jealous, he’s had a crowd of people buzzing around him all evening at this ridiculous SHIELD Gala they’ve all been dragged to. It just makes it hard to keep tabs on how many times he’s seen Tony snag a glass of champagne from the passing waiters, not that it’s his business how much he does or doesn’t drink, more of keeping an eye on Tony was a tough habit to break, even more so now that the lines of friendship were being crossed–enthusiastically, energetically and…
“I’ll send you a copy,” Natasha negotiated, and Steve chuckled.
“I’m sure you had enough for tonight,” Steve says, pressing a palm to Tony’s alcohol-warmed cheek. “JARVIS?”
“Sorry, bud,” Tony said, turning to Clint, convincingly apologetic except for the faint notes of laughter waltzing in the background of his voice. “I would have helped, but Cap vetoed. Blame him, not me.”
“But Steveeee!” Tony whined like a child, and Steve pulled him closer, trapping Tony’s arms beneath his own, and pressed his lips against Tony’s ear. “No, Tony,” Steve said, and smiled as he shuddered.
Tony shoots down the race track, leaving only a streak of red in his wake. One second he is at the starting line and the next he is ten meters ahead and gaining. Meanwhile, Loki vanishes the moment the race starts, disappearing without a trace only to reappear a few meters ahead. It’s like watching a glitch in real life as Loki teleports down the race track in a burst of green, ramping the tension when he supposedly falls behind only to reappear near Tony a blink later. It keeps the audience on the edge of their seat, and Steve doesn’t even notice they finish the first lap until the announcer broadcasts it.
“Sir would say it depends on his mood and the position of the stars,” JARVIS intoned from above and Steve laughed.
“I’m going to call it a night after this,” Steve said when he thought it had gone on long enough.
“Well,” Steve says, making a show of sighing as he gazes up at Tony, who’s eyes sparkled with amusement, “petition for a kiss at least?”
Steve raises an eyebrow. “He’s racing with the suit?” he says, and JARVIS replies with dry amusement, “For science, Sir insists.”
“It’s not up to me to approve,” Steve says, even though he knows what’s coming next.
“But I’m a genius billionaire philanthropist, Stevee,” Tony said, throwing his arms up to Steve’s shoulders and almost hitting himself in the face. “There’s nothing I’ve never done.”
“Petition for another nickname?” Steve requests without much hope, hoisting Tony up so he’s more comfortably in his arms. He tries to look past Tony to Loki, but Tony wiggles in his arms and Steve gets distracted.
Tony yelps and Steve makes an aborted movement to go to him, but then Tony says, “Haha, very funny.”
gesture at Thor, and he handed Clint a cup of mead with relish. “To the stripper pole in the middle of Tony’s private jet!”
There are other people that need help.
Thor’s smile, broad and friendly, only widened with Natasha’s. “I had to try to save my love from those indeterminable foul beans, Natasha.”
“Calling,” JARVIS says, and Steve jolts.
, with barely hidden laughter in the morning. He pulled the blanket over Tony and tucked him in. “Go to sleep now,” Steve said, kissing him on the forehead. “We can talk tomorrow morning.”
That’s a whole 25 percent chance that your suit might not have caught you when you leapt and -”
Steve covers his face with his hand and sighs. He says, knowing Tony knows and must have considered this already, “Tony, I really hope you know what you’re doing, interacting with Loki and inviting him
“Right,” Tony says, unconvinced, “because two super spies, one awesome scientist who can go
The moment the content touches his tongue, Tony yanks it away as though burned, spluttering speechlessly. He stares at the glass in abject horror.
“Yup. If you’d never, drink. If you have, watch others drink and laugh. I’ve done too much as a genius billionaire philanthropist to lose at this game.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. “I didn’t plan to interfere, I just wanted to make sure you’re alright.” The image of the piece of building crashing into Tony is still vividly fresh in his mind.
Roombas can’t nod, Steve knew, but if they could, he was sure that was what they were eagerly doing before leaving the room again.
“Tell me why you jumped?” Steve requested, and Tony smiled his showman smile, beautiful and glamorous, and no less sincere for that.
The relief on Loki’s behalf and the pride on Tony’s that hit him surprises Steve, but only for a brief moment. Steve still doesn’t know what Loki’s purpose in approaching Tony is, if there is indeed one, and he definitely won’t let Loki get away with it if Loki intends to harm Tony or New York City, but nevertheless, he’s glad to see that Loki seems to be doing better.
Clint’s lips reluctantly kicked up to a smile. His shoulders, previously bunched with tension, lowered as he reached down to pick up his abandoned glass, and they did not come back up as he lifted his glass and took his penalizing sip for the round.
Tony tilted his head up, breath washing against Steve’s ear as he whispered like a secret, “I like it,” and Steve’s ears and face flushed red.
“And nothing,” Steve silently finishes with her, meeting her eyes, and her lips quirk.
“But Captain Steve Rogers stalked me for my safety!” Tony says with a laugh, even as Steve groans and buries his face against Tony’s neck. “How many other people can say the same, hmm?”
Steve jolts as they part, recalling Loki in the kitchen.
It was the cool glow of Tony’s arc reactor that Steve was paying attention to, however. Tony was sprawled against him with his back pressed to his chest, and from Steve’s vantage point over Tony’s shoulder, the arc reactor glowed so bright it shone upwards like a beacon, illuminating Tony’s face in sharp clinical blue. It should have made him ghastly, ghostly, but with Tony’s easy smile and loose-limbed ease as he took small sips from his glass of champagne throughout the night, all he felt was real and solid in Steve’s arms.
“Right, a Level 7 out of 10 threat,” Steve says under his breath. “Which is why we’re here now.”
“Yes, yes, birthday boy,” Steve says, fond, taking the glass of sparkling apple juice from Tony’s hand before he tosses it. He absentmindedly wonders if Loki was also drinking juice before, since the glasses didn’t look any different, and smiles at the thought. “C’mon, I didn’t get to dance with you yet.” Steve takes a step back until it is the proper distance and then bows low, extending his hand out. “May I have this dance?” he says, just as the music segues to one perfect for slow dancing.
“I resent that,” Tony murmured against Steve’s shirt. He hiccuped. “I’ve never been in more of a mind right.”
“He would’ve,” Natasha agreed, same sharp smile on her face, and it was all-too obvious that this was a battle Clint had lost even before he began to wage it, “if he could. But I’m not talking about that now, am I?”
Tony looks up at him and grins. “Yes, I love it, thank you,” Tony says, cradling Steve’s face with both hands. He swoops up and pecks Steve on the lips. “Does this mean you and JARVIS approve of Project Befriending Loki and Wringing Out The Secrets To His Magic now?” He makes a face at the mouthful of the project name. “Remind me to really change that name,” he mutters, before continuing with a twinkle in his eyes, “Or was inviting Loki here another supervised play-date?”
And so the night went on, until only Tony, Steve, and Natasha remained. Thor and Bruce had both retired for the night, Bruce when he thought he could not eat another disgusting jelly bean without Hulking out, and Thor because it seemed like even gods’ alcoholic tolerance had a limit. Tony was more than a little tipsy at that point, Steve was beginning to feel sleepy, and even Natasha looked a little pink. Clint had thrown up once throughout the night and at that moment, Steve had never seen anything as horrifying as a mob of Roombas descending on Clint’s vomit. Natasha kindly thank them afterward and they somehow managed to fetch and deliver a glass of water to Natasha for Clint on her behest.
Steve shakes against Tony with laughter. He struggles to get enough breath to talk, but it isn’t enough a solid minute later that he manages to say, “Loki gave me that.”
Loki finally turns to look at him, lips quirked less insincere and more amused, and says, “Why did you invite me, Captain? So many changed neon ‘You’re cordially invited…’ signs without even knowing if I saw it.”
“... I think it best for you to see for yourself, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS replies, and Steve laughs at the pause in JARVIS’ words that speaks volumes in itself as he rounds into the kitchen.
“Thank you, but I had enough for today,” Steve says, which is the truth. He doesn’t think Loki would try to put something in his drink, of all things, but he isn’t a fan of drinking too much, even if he’s not affected by it.
The race is on again.
“I’m fine, good as new, nothing the suit can’t handle!” Tony says. “But yes, I’ll let him know, though I can never live it down now. I’m heading to the site of the explosion and Loki is redirecting the falling debris, though he’s grumbling this is not his job. I’ll catch up with you later, alright, honeybun?”
“Get set.”
Steve hesitated for a second, before saying, “Is this about Howard?”, even though he already knew the answer.
, Tony had said. His heart ached.
Steve heaves a breath, like he’s surfacing for the first time, except he’s still drowning. Someone is speaking into his ear.
Tony notices. “Bet he’s gone already,” he says, waving a hand in the air. He pats Steve’s arm and Steve lets him go, planting him back on the ground. “Our friend Loki isn’t much of a people person,” he says, turning around to face the kitchen and confirming his suspicion. “Or hmm, I don’t know if he would call us friends. Fellow scientists-slash-baker?” He looks at Steve for help.
“Ooooh,” Tony said, wiggling his eyebrows at him and Steve ignored his suggestive tone.
if he’s surprised, an alien god-slash-prince, and a Super Soldier isn’t dangerous at all?”
“JARVIS, what do you think of Loki?” Steve asks the next time Tony hangs out with Loki. Tony invited Steve to tag along before he left, probably because he thought Steve would feel better if he was there to supervise and see for himself that Loki has no ill-will towards him. Steve passed, however, not wanting Tony to feel obligated to let Steve intrude into his friendship for Steve’s peace of mind. Despite that, worry nags at him. “We both know Loki looks bad on paper, but even so, Tony seems to trust him. Do you trust Tony with Loki?”
Steve’s heart and mind came to a screeching halt, any previous good feelings evaporating in a flash, leaving him terribly cold. “You did it before?” he asked, and he didn't know how his voice ended up sounding normal when all there was in his mind were horrible images of Tony falling to his death. Steve would have been okay; he had his serum to protect him. Natasha had her training, and Clint as well when Tony couldn't get there in time with his Iron Man suit to catch him. Thor had Mjölnir and Bruce had the Hulk, but Tony? Tony was terribly vulnerable, very human and susceptible to being hurt.
” Tony’s body slumped against him, as though he couldn’t hold himself up anymore. “I never told him goodbye. I never told him goodbye. I hated him, but he was my
best of three, but so far” - an image of the track appears on the big screen, red and green zipping across the line in tandem, but the red just a touch ahead - “Iron Man is in the lead!”
“Don’t -” Tony directs to JARVIS, just as Steve’s and Tony’s phones vibrated. “Traitor,” Tony mutters, as Steve fishes out his phone and raises an eyebrow at the number JARVIS texted him. “
Steve pulled Tony close to him, as close as possible and then closer, crushing Tony against him, and Tony did the same, arms and body trembling from the force of his sobs, each holding on so tight as though afraid the other would disappear. “I love you, Tony,” Steve said. “I love you so much and” - the sun was slowly coming up, illuminating the room with clarity - “I’m sorry.”
Steve looks back at the race track. The dust still hasn’t settled. “You need to evacuate,” Steve says to the father and son, just as JARVIS says in his ear, “Sir is fine. Loki teleported him out of the way last second.”
“Shit, I thought she left already,” Tony laughs, throwing his arms around Steve. “Hello honeybun, how are you doing? Please tell me all the juicy tea
Tony tucks away his phone and leans against Steve. “They grow up so fast nowadays,” he says with the shake of his head and a slight smile.
The Iron Man helmet clicks around Tony’s head, and then finally, “Go!”
“I’m fine, Steve,” Tony said softly but firmly, willing him to believe. “Don’t do this. All of us have said that we’ve jumped before, Steve, that’s just part of the job. We’re still here with each other, drinking and relaxing, and that’s all that matters, right?”
“Multiple jets, I just want to say,” Tony continued.
“I will,” Steve says, glancing across the room and catching Tony’s eyes. His eyebrows rise when he sees Loki by Steve’s side, bemusement followed by utter delight. Tony crosses the room, heading towards them like a child who caught sight of the cutest puppy he has ever seen, and Loki suddenly looks awkward like she wants to run. “Can I just ask you one question?”
Steve caught Tony’s hand just as it was untangling from his own to reach for his glass. “What are you doing?” Steve murmured against Tony’s hair, catching a strong whiff of grease from Tony working on his motorbike a few hours prior. “It’s not even the next round yet.”
“And he’s out,” Natasha said wryly. Her lips quirked as the four Roombas from before zoomed up to Clint’s body, circling it with great curiosity and chitter. Natasha stood and walked over, and the Roombas parted before her, lining up like soldiers before their sergeant. “Thank you for your service, but it’s not necessary for now. We’ll call when you are needed.”
“My pleasure,” JARVIS says, and just before he hangs up, “Happy birthday, Sir.”
“Didn’t seem to have trouble thinking of something before,” Natasha murmured, but Tony “Shhhh”ed loudly, as though to drown her out. Natasha rolled her eyes and exchanged a look with Steve.
Tony laughs. “Yeah, I know, though I did invite you to stalk us openly. You can’t say I didn’t.”
Both of them stare at each other for a long moment. Steve doesn’t know who broke first, but it doesn’t matter. Eventually, like the inevitable, they crash onto the dance floor, hand in hand with each other’s laughter in their ears.
“Are you okay, Bruce?” Thor asked, offering a hand to him. “My apologies, I did not mean to bump into you.”
Tony looks so happy, so confident the way he gets when he’s in the middle of an experiment, that Steve just wants to walk over and sweep him off his feet.
Tony grinned as he poured Steve his champagne.
“Petition denied!” Tony announces with a gleeful flourish, raising an arm as though in rally. It almost whacks Steve in the face. “Nicknames for Sir Knight-on-the-Bike is a monarchy!” he asserts, leaning close until all Steve can see is Tony’s face and his beautiful eyes.
“Good to know, cause we have a play-date coming up and we didn’t know if we needed to reserve extra seats,” Tony says, winking. Finally, he says, “Thank you, JARVIS. You can go back to your big brother duties now.”
Tony hits the first speed dial on his phone and puts it on speaker. It connects and JARVIS’ voice filters out, “Jotted down, Sir. Yet another item onto a long list of unfulfilled projects.”
On the screen, Tony raises his hand, revealing the cupcake. He grins and bites half of it in one go. “All in a good day of work, perfecting a recipe. Now if only the stupid KitchenAid didn’t
“Tony,” Steve said softly, placing a hand on his shoulder. His shirt where Tony had plastered his face against was slowly getting wet. “Tony? Tony, look at me.”
The Iron Man suit materializes around Tony like a second skin. Next to him, green light sparks to life around Loki in crackles of lightning, and at the sight, the crowd
“Guys, congrats on your newfound relationship, but let’s focus here,” Clint interjected. Bruce’s face flushed pink while Thor looked on him fondly. “Ever jumped off a building higher than twenty-five feet without any gear or equipment, ‘tasha asked. Well, you’ll have to drink now. Cheat shot, right?!”
Steve’s heart stops, the world slows as a piece of broken building bigger than the Hulk falls towards the track, Tony heading right into it after throwing in an extra burst of speed to catch up to Loki right before the finish line. He won’t be able to get out of the blast zone in time.
“Is she allowed to do that?” Tony whispered loudly to Steve. “Just change the game like that?” Natasha turned to him before Steve could reply.
“A corporate skyscraper on 8th Avenue belonging to Hammer Industries exploded. It seems like something they were testing went wrong, causing parts of their building to collapse,” JARVIS says, his steady and familiar cadence calming the drumming of Steve’s heart. “Mr. Odison is in Asgard, Agent Romanoff likewise on a mission. I alerted Agent Barton and Dr. Banner, they’re on the way with your shield.”
“A prize for the Captain,” she says dryly and walks away, her hair swaying against her back. She has two glasses of champagne in hand by the time they make it to a corner of the ballroom. Steve gets a sense of deja vu as she leans against the wall and extends one of the two glasses towards him.
“Sir, as Captain Rogers has repeatedly affirmed and I concur, you can befriend whoever you want.” Tony gives a nearby security camera a skeptical look and before he can remind them of The Race Incident again, JARVIS continues, “Based on Mr. Loki saving your life at the race, we have reduced his threat level to Level 4.”
“Hello, sweetheart,” Tony’s voice comes into Steve’s comm, and Steve has never heard anything sweeter that moment. “JARVIS was telling me you guys were doing some stalk-bonding today?”
of all things?”
“I just wanted to make sure he’s safe,” Steve groans, covering his face, even as he feels a chagrin grin spread across his face. He has been teased about this one time too many by the Avengers already to truly feel embarrassed and upset by that. He glances back up after a moment, still smiling. “Thank you for saving him. I asked Tony to pass it to you, but I never told you myself.”
“That’s dirty, Steve,” Tony said, slipping an arm free of Steve’s hold to reach back. Tony's hand enveloped the base of Steve’s neck and Steve went, leaning down to meet him halfway as Tony leveraged himself up, despite knowing it was probably nothing good, not with that mischievous look in Tony’s eyes.
“I’ve had better, no offense, Thor,” Tony said. He grinned a little lopsided. “Though, boy, is it strong. The last time I felt this drunk was back in my early MIT days when I spent the whole night drinking.” Tony yawned. “Anyway, since I’m getting sleepy and Steve is getting frowny, we’re gonna have to wrap this up.” Tony rolled his neck. “Last one standing wins. Never have you ever installed a pole in the middle of your private jet.”
“To answer your initial question,” Steve says, straightening and moving the conversation along, and right on cue, both Steve’s and Tony’s phone vibrated with a text message.
“They’re adorable, aren’t they?” Tony mock-whispered to Natasha. Natasha glanced over at Thor and Bruce, who both jerked up upon Clint calling them, and then heads that were already close in proximity collided.
. “Sorry, too corny?”
Going with the idea that Steve hasn't worked out Bucky killed Tony's parents yet, just in case there was any confusion. Enjoy guys! :)
Now they’re not lovers.

“I think we’ve found your energy pull Tony.” The detail of Steve’s face that’s exposed looks decidedly pale. Tony nods in response.
Steve finds his nerve again,
He ends up back in his workshop, seething and gulping scotch neat from the bottle, it stung that Steve would go to such an extream, he’d watched the recording one more time, just as a sadistic punishment for himself, it definitely wasn’t Steve or Natasha that slinked through the cabinets like smoke.

By the time the third automatic door slams in his face Steve is pissed,
The bottle gives a snort when he coats his fingers; it’s the only noise aside from two ragged sets of breathing; Tony tosses it aside, it bounces into the drapes making them flutter and throws moonlight across Steve’s body, casting him in a perfect luster, so perfect he could have been carved from stone. It’s glinting off his tags that have stuck to the gloss of sweat that’s beading on his chest, it catches him off guard and he freezes, eyes raking for longer than they should “Tony,

of modern technology, but for Steve – he lets it fall into a clattering heap of red and gold.
Tony sidles closer, Steve’s hand that was gripping his elbow slides up his arm and circles muscles that flex on instinct, he lets go of Tony’s wrist; lets him move his hand up and down, flinching every time Tony rolls his foreskin back to the point where it's almost painful and the cold metal of his watch catches the bare skin of his stomach where his shirt’s come loose.

He’s already out in the corridor by the time Steve catches up with him, he looks perfectly placed amongst the modern art décor and orbs of light hanging from the ceiling. Steve swallows’ anticipation; a quick glance behind them confirms they’re alone before he presses his hand to the small of Tony’s back, fingers rubbing over the purple silk of his waistcoat and steering him further from the party.

Fourteen hundred hours. On the dot, Steve’s been standing there for the best part of half an hour, hands stuffed deep in his jacket pockets clenching and unclenching his fists, driving his nails into his palms. Swallowing doubt and nausea that he wasn’t coming.

“What? Tony, listen there’s something important I need to tell you. The team that was cataloging the files found something… something important…
he whispers testing the air before he’s close enough to catch his teeth on the skin behind Steve’s ear.
She saunters over to a desk positioned in front of one of the windows. Natasha glances over at Sam whose busy giving one of the largest dog beds that she has ever seen a cautious appraisal.
Or a last-ditch attempt?
what’s not fair…” He trails off as his voice loses its power, blinking at Steve owlish and lost. “I thought we were… I mean we could of…” he chokes stepping forward so far into Steve’s space that a deep breath from either of them would mean their chests touched. He’s so close he can see the bloodshot pink of his eyes and the unkemptness of his beard that was a few days past due a shave.
He loops his arms under Tony’s knees feeling his bare thighs quiver against his cheeks and under his touch, Steve’s hands finally settle on either side of Tony’s ass as he moves him into the position he wants with Tony’s legs resting on his shoulders. The angle’s better, but the sound’s muffled the usual mechanical hum of Tony’s workshop drowned out and all Steve can hear is the erratic breathing that comes from above and the slight creak from the workbench below every time Tony shifts or jerks unexpectedly.

"Hi.” He
The skin feels chaffed where he’d clung to Steve’s jacket like he was desperate, pressing the serrated zip into his fingertips.
“I’m hanging up now. I’ll see you tomorrow.”

Tony watched the footage rewind. It’s late, he still a little drunk - enough that it's making him fuzzy, and after his tryst with Steve, his body feels like it’s unspooled and too relaxed to concentrate. He leans on the railings for support, vaguely aware of Steve shuffling up next to him, he smirks to himself.
is implied as he turns and sashays towards the exit; brushing off a few would be admirers on the way with a wave of his hand.
He kisses him again and Steve feels his lips swell and tingle, his whole-body melts and the tension drops from his shoulders when Tony dips his tongue between the seam.
Steve leans down with an arm on the desk to get a better look at the screens, dangerously close to Tony who deliberately lets his chair rock back on busted bearings, he can catch the scent of metal polish and the heady tang of the black coffee Steve likes to drink-Tony’s pretty sure he’d drink it straight from the percolator if somebody didn’t stop him.
I could have worked something out.” Tony folds his arms in front of his chest squaring up to Steve, making the considerably taller man shrink back.
“Steve,” Tony clears his throat,
“I’m alone.” She said squinting at the shifting shapes.
He knows it’s a power exchange; Tony Stark loves the fact that he can reduce Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, AKA THE Super Solider, to putty in his hands with a few well-placed sweeps of his articulate tongue, hell he wouldn’t put it past Tony to put it on his resume, and damn if right now Steve isn’t completely OK with all of it, encouraging it even – after all he was the one who wore his tags… He doesn’t even try and stop his hips from bucking when Tony works a hand under his balls.

The footage cuts to a different angle it’s centered onto a display case lit by a green exit light. The moment hangs and there’s nothing. Then the same swirling shadows blot out the view. They solidify and twist up into something human in front of their eyes.
He was more than Steve thought he deserved, they’d been in each other company a little under twenty minutes and he was already fixing all things Steve didn’t even know were ailing him.

Minor panic over, Steve rubs the sleep from his eyes as Tony stands.
Tony goes limp and pulls away, moving back to sit and wipe his hair out of his face. He hears Steve whimper before he watches him roll sideways. “I-told-you-” He smirks still winded and catching his breath as he crawls up the bed. “You wouldn’t be able to move once I was finished.”
“Umm, everything alright Cap?” Tony asks because he thinks he should. His chest starts to go tight when Steve doesn’t answer. It’s to do with

I mean, I’m not sure I can hold my breath all the way to the top floor.” Natasha looks behind her, Sam was smiling his gap-toothed grin and shaking his head. “You know Cap didn’t tell me what we were going to get… I mean it doesn’t matter, I’m up for heavy lifting and all that. I just don’t know why you need me here?”
he goes with whichever way Steve pushes or pulls him.
“Steve!”
“I heard that.” Steve pauses. “It’ll be kicking and screaming in a minute, I don’t care if I wake the whole tower, you’re going to get some sleep.” He steps closer to Tony around the counter.
“Tony I- “
“Don’t. Don’t look at me like that,” Tony says shakily getting down from the bench, slowly retrieving his clothes, his voice a rasp.
Tony looks like a Forbes centerfold parading through the crowd in his navy pinstriped suit. The way the dimmed lighting darkens his features into something exotic and exaggerates the white glint of his teeth every time he flashes his signature Stark smirk. He keeps catching Steve’s eye, he’s somehow managing to do it from ten feet away over the rim of his champagne flute, giving him the:
“Not all the time,” they both turn to look back at Ilona. She makes a ‘gimmie’ gesture for the photograph, “That’s not where they kept him, he was here,” she points to the cell disappearing out of shot. “This one-” she says tapping where the chains meet the floor, Natasha already knew what she was going to say, “-This one was

drinking, why do you even care?”
as any iota of sleep evaporates from his lover in a rush of blood to his groin. Steve never ceases to be impressed at how quickly Tony Stark can go from apathetic to emphatic when there is something that he wants on offer; and tonight, he’s made sure he’s got something Tony wants. Awake and pressing himself against Steve a hand runs over the chain around his neck as he feels something rock solid grind against his thigh.

The animal in Steve that had been hovering just below the surface doesn’t just stir this time, it roars up, stops him from even looking for that one good reason to say ‘no’ and walk back out, instead, he utters the word
The air sat heavy and humid all day, Steve spent the best part of it pulling at his uniform to get it away from his skin. Any extended amount of time outside and it sucked the moisture right out the atmosphere, “Breathable fabric my foot-” He mutters subtly adjusting his pants because he’s pretty sure he’s lost track of where he
undressed Tony in his head, popping buttons off his shirt, feeling the delicious give of his skin under his fingers and hearing him moan-
he’s pretty sure that if the penthouse had neighbors, they would need a cigarette about now. He’s glad they don’t have neighbors, Tony doesn’t want anyone to hear the Steve that curses like it’s the only vocabulary he knows, who begs and pleads – that’s a side of Steve Rogers reserved for only him.
The derelict warehouse swims out of focus, and Steve squeezes his eyes shut, let his body shake as the tears fall into Tony’s hair.
and sleeping with him comes at a premium roughly the cost of his dignity.
Tony tastes tingley-sweet, it’s the champagne, it rolls off his tongue and his lips onto Steve’s. Tony tastes expensive, Tony smells expensive, he’s managed to reach around him and open the door of the closet pushing him back, his head connects with the hanging light sending it swinging, his foot catches a mop bucket and at that point, Steve reminds himself that Tony

He says and doesn’t finish, his whole body shaking in Steve’s arms when he seats him in his lap. His skin’s clammy to the touch and he’s so pliant,

his voice dropping low and his fingertips stretching out and tracing the shape of his lips before pulling down on the bottom one, he tucks his thumb under Steve chin and tilts his head up, and Steve opens his mouth. He lets him in, he hollows his cheeks and sucks until Tony’s fingers scrape at the back of his throat. He flattens his tongue and laps against them, the same way he would if it was Tony’s cock instead.
Steve trod careful, needlessly light footstep to the kitchen, he could hear whoever it was rattling around in the fridge, humming off-key to themselves until they startled at the automatic ‘swoosh’ of the door.
” he steps directly in front of Steve, rolls his shoulder and braces like he’s about to catch a pass from a quarterback. “Okay. I’m ready, give me the lecture.” His lips quirk up at the ends, and Steve rubs the bridge of his nose.
“I’m sorry, I… I didn’t mean for this to happen… I asked Natasha to help me find him after the helicarriers and he disappeared,
He lifts and pushes at Tony’s hips in one smooth motion, sitting him up on the bench as he gives a weak protest and shifts, arching a little straighter at the sudden shock of metallic cold on his bare backside.
The scraunch of the service elevator grate draws his attention, the muttering that follows, echoing through the vast emptiness of the derelict warehouse that was the decided meeting place. It’s apt really and it suddenly occurs to Steve as he listens to the approaching footsteps, that Tony suggested it out of spite – some poetic representation of what they had become,
of possessive. “JARVIS?” Tony cracks an eye at Steve addressing the AI. “Remind Tony to do laundry tomorrow.” He chuckles and gets a swift elbow to the ribs from his little spoon. Steve tightens his grip, but Tony manages to twist around to face him.
He wraps Tony in his arm, enveloping him in a stacked tricep; the flat of his hand running down the swoop of his back and resting just above the curve of his ass. “You’re naked.” He manages as Tony shifts and kisses along Steve’s jawline, at his pulse points, down his throat, all while he still toys with the dog tags, running up the chain and sliding fingers underneath it, tangling his hands in then tugging.
you have to leave this alone. There’s too much emotion there. I think the whole tower has heard you not sleeping.” Steve glances away with a blush coloring his cheeks, confirming her suspicions that something was going on between him and Tony in the wee hours. She chooses her next words carefully, “You don’t have to say anything to him you know,
“Time’s up, Captain,” Loki says, tossing her hair back. “I’ll see you around.” She pauses for a second, before saying, “You should give Tony your untouched drink. I’d hate for it to go to waste.”
When Loki continues to hold out the drink, Steve finally takes it, though he doesn’t drink, instead opting to watch Loki sips her champagne while gazing out at the ballroom. She seems thoughtful.
Steve excuses himself and makes himself scarce.
Loki looks young, all of a sudden, dressed in modern clothes that Steve is sure Tony is going to swear up and down is in fashion nowadays. His long hair is tied in a ponytail, a wisp curling just above his eyebrow, and his eyes are soft. The vitriol and hurt that Steve recall reflecting so vividly from them are no longer there.
“Love you too, Capsicle,” he said, right before he leaned forward and drew Steve down into a dizzying kiss. There might have been a few whistles and chuckles, and maybe the sound of a camera snapshotting, but all Steve could focus on right now was Tony’s warmth against his.
“Noooooo,” Tony cried, slumping against Steve. Steve placed a steadying hand against his back. “Waiiiit. There’s something. I think there’s something.”
Steve snapped his mouth shut, unable to say the rest, unwilling to imagine a world where Tony could have died and Steve wasn’t there to help. A world where Steve wasn’t there to save him and Tony wasn’t by his side.
Tony cackled. “Oh, this is the best,” he said, as a Roomba, after cleaning the spill on the floor, attempted to climb up Thor’s leg to reach his dripping shirt. The rest of the Roombas circled Thor eagerly, ready to pounce on the next drop of Asgardian mead that would fall to the rug from his shirt.
