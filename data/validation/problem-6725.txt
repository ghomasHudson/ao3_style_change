Tony slammed against the door once more before going silent. Despite his silence, they all knew it wasn’t over. Tony’s mischievous nature turned deviant when he was in rut, and the silence could no more be trusted than his tantrums. If anything, he was probably looking for tools to take the door off its hinges.
Tony’s kept up with SHIELD in the months after Vanko, unbeknownst to them. His infiltration is lazy, JARVIS glossing over the salient points of whatever SHIELD is trying to accomplish. There’s something in there about unlimited, clean energy, but the details are so finely wrapped up in encryption that he doesn’t want to alert anyone by brute forcing it. Besides, he’s about to go live with his own arc reactor powered tower in New York. Something he’d never give to SHIELD to reverse engineer.
It’s easy to gather up the necessary supplies in the kitchen: fruit, cheese, and juice to drink. He brings this to Tony, who is still curled up in the nest, though he’s started to doze just a bit.
He gets a nose straight into his crack for his impertinence, and he yelps, wiggling forward and pulling at the ground with his hands.
“You and me baby, we’re the future.” Tony’s lips curve up into a sly smile after he speaks, and he tilts his head in askance before he latches onto Steve’s lips like he’s parched for them. Tony kisses like there’s no need to breathe, lips and tongue working over Steve’s mouth. Invigorated by the destruction around them, Steve takes it all in, letting Tony plumb the depths of him, letting him possess Steve. He wants Tony to crawl inside of him and make a dark, tender nest there.
No one notices that he can see, and he thinks that this might be doable for the long-term. Once he’s done with his dish, he pays, grabs the bag, and makes his way to the tower.
It’s a marvel that he doesn’t slip into a seizure or otherwise pass out. Instead, he’s preternaturally aware of everything going on around him. Every prick of the needle and each hand that’s plucking at his extremities, removing pieces of the suit from him with blunt scissors and quick tears.
Steve’s resignation at not being able to help Tony does nothing for the appearances that Tony keeps making in his head. It’s worse, with the rut, as the stink of it fills up the hall. Steve envisions Tony on Steve’s bed, legs rucked up around his head, all that energy channeled into the sweet cries that leave Tony’s mouth. Steve is never going to hear them, and the realization hits him with juddering harshness.
“You’re so perfect around me. I could have you like this daily, so pretty and darling,” Steve pants, stuttering in his pace, huffing out little breaths over Tony.
Steve feels cold. He’d been in the ice before, felt the touch of grime on his skin until it sank in and glazed his soul. This feels like shackles. Like steel armor that locks around him and refuses to let go.
The two alphas look between each other, and the sparks that used to be the friendship Tony had seen initially start to shine through the cracks.
Slowly, his hands lift away from the nuke, the suit going dark. He gazes out into a great nothing filled with so many more Chitauri than he could have possibly imagined. The nuke speeds on, oblivious to its change in scenery or trajectory.
It doesn’t take long for Tony to give in and join Steve in the kitchen. He’s as drawn to the conflict as he is afraid of it.
“Steve. Yeah ok. Um.” Which is just his luck, because out of all the Avengers, only Steve had a problem with Tony selling himself for parts and information. A really big problem, to where they hadn’t truly spoken to each other in months. Tony didn’t genuinely know what made Steve upset about the whole thing beyond the fact that it was yet one more part of this situation Steve couldn’t control.
He’s almost finished, musing that this is the third time this particular cog has been busted in the arm—from whatever Bucky is doing that’s causing that—when the door opens again.
“Lies. Bald faced lies. One, I can find someone else, and two, I did not pick you—” He needed to stop himself, to escape this. He wanted to rend the Captain to pieces. Push him into making throaty growls on the side of his neck, see what other noises he could wring out of this Alpha.
God, even Fury is here, wearing exactly what he usually wears. The man is deep in conversation with Agent Hill, who looks rather fashionable in an emerald getup.
“I can’t stop you. But just remember this country is a democracy, Tony. If Stern has enough people in his pocket for a vote, which I don’t think he does, but if he does, you could be looking at being forced to give them possession of the suit!” Stern’s pockets were big, but not that big. There was only so much money in the world, and Tony had a lot of it. It wasn’t a sure thing, legally keeping the suit, but he had better than Vegas odds. Illegally? If it came down to it, he’d make his tech useless before they stole it.
“No! Just. Let’s wait out the symptoms, ok? Please. And maybe get Bruce?” Steve abruptly stops and lets Tony slink back to the ground, and Tony is so grateful, because if Steve saw his erection, surely he’d think so poorly of him. Though another part of him desperately wants to know if Steve is at all interested. Plenty of aliens have enjoyed fucking him. He’s eminently fuckable. If Steve asked, he’d bang him like a screen door in a hurricane. Maybe he should let Steve get a look.
After that, Tony debuts his new security system without as much fanfare as he could muster. Yes, he went on the daily show, but honestly, the fact that he’s created an army of bot cameras that he’s connected to as if they’re limbs on his body should be news everywhere. No one has tech as half as hot as he does.
And when he reaches it, he grips Tony hard, slamming his cock in as deep as he can before he starts cumming. Steve’s cock shudders and jolts through Tony, undulating as spurts of hot semen fill him full to bursting. Over and over again he feels the sweet heat of Steve’s spend in his very veins, and just as he thinks he’s filled up, he feels the knot seal him in. Whimpering, it stretches him in the way Alpha toys never could, until Steve’s cock must be swimming in the hot liquid inside Tony.
“You’re so pretty like this, Tony. I’ve always wanted—well, you’re hard not to want. But this was something else. You’re like an angel.” Complimented, his wings titter and shake themselves out, preening. Tony stared at Steve, wide-eyed. All it took to get Steve to requite the unrequited was to grow a pair—of wings. Tony was stunned.
“You’re beautiful like this, slick and ready for me. Are you ready Tony? Say it for me.” Steve’s hand slid down Tony’s ass, fingers first, cupping his hole with the calloused heel of Steve’s palm before sliding down to ensconce his balls in his hand while his fingers gently squeeze at Tony’s cock. Steve kneels behind him, tightly coiled power. Steve’s hands are all over him, moving and pressing, horrible and wonderful.
“If you ever let go of your control enough to come at me, it would be obvious it’s not an accident. You’d do my work for me. But hell, maybe I should let you, so they can lock you up.” It strikes him then that Nat might no longer be a friend. She’s on Tony’s side though. And that’s the side Steve is also on.
Tony begins to turn around, but Bucky crowds up behind him and places his other hand on Tony’s opposite shoulder, both sets of fingers rhythmically squeezing at the muscles there.
There was no point in asking who the anonymous alpha was, because Tony was going to find out. He didn’t even care about going in blind. He would, and he’d leave a message for himself with JARVIS about who it was. They’d hit him with the serum that made you forget, but it wouldn’t matter. Nothing ever stopped Tony when he was determined enough. Then he could go back to filling his vast spiritual voids with tech.
“You taste so good. Perfect Omega, going to take care of you.” Steve whispers against his neck. Tony has never been so thrilled to be called Omega in his life. It would be lovely to hate it, to despise that Steve is here only because he needs to save Tony, to preserve the balance of the Avengers, and the world. He wasn’t entirely full of himself, but he understood that a Tony Stark sized hole would be impossible to fill. So maybe he was the person Black Widow said he was.
It’s a massive mistake; he’s tossed bodily through the air, the power from his gauntlets reverberating back towards him. A muffled, but loud boom echoes through the city, and Selvig is tossed off his feet as Tony works at stabilizing himself in the air.
“Come on dude, I have friends to get back to. Can we not do this?” Wolves aren’t supposed to attack people. He’s read that somewhere, he knows he has.
“Hmm. Don’t whip the batter too hard now.” She considers him in that unfathomable way she usually does as she stills his hands with her own, before letting go and leaving the room.
“We’ve known each other for years and have been through some difficult times. He’s not had an easy time of it. This is for his own benefit, I promise.” Afghanistan and Tony’s other brushes with death should have never happened, but Steve can only help soothe the symptoms now, as soon as Tony is his. The nightmares that Tony lies about will die down with the stabilizing presence of an Alpha. Tony’s terrible eating and sleeping habits will be curbed and kept in check with an Alpha command. Even SI will benefit from this. And Steve, well, he’s going to do everything possible to ensure Tony loves him.
“Is everything a joke to you?” It stops him in his tracks, if only for a second. Does Steve not know he’s teasing?
is going to do. He has no idea what it is, but it’s not a wolf. His whole body shivers and he reflexively swallows.
Tony watches every bit of motion, all of the rippling of Bucky’s body over his own, Bucky’s arms pressed hard into the bed at Tony’s sides as the man rocks into him before snapping his hips forward. And his eyes, oh his eyes. They’re pinioning Tony in place. He feels buried by them, the sharp-dark blue of them in the low light stabbing at Tony’s heart. Despite what Steve has said, Tony knows with a surety he can’t explain that Bucky means to stay with him. That he means this.
“I think you do like it. I think you want me to do things to you, yeah?” Bucky’s fingers make their way inside the loop of the towel, loosening it gently while Tony gasps and flaps his mouth helplessly.
But Bucky is right. He has to be, because there’s no way Tony would ever agree. And Steve supposes he should get Tony to be on board with this. Even if a designation change would be the most prudent choice for Tony.
“That’s all of what you just said!” This is getting out of hand. Steve’s motivations just happen to coincide with what is the most sound decision for Tony.
“Not ok, not ok with that.” Yes he was. The idea of Rhodes wrapped up in Tony’s armor felt right. But he wasn’t going to let Honey Bear get away with thinking that stealing suits from friends was cool.
Sam’s gaze pierces Tony’s soul, like Tony is a mess of wires and Sam knows just how to untangle him. “If you hurt him, there isn’t a force alive that’ll stop me from getting to you. You know that, right?”
He whites out in a haze of feeling, the tidal wave of it crashing over him, burying him deep into his pleasure. He collapses over Tony, cold sweat prickling at his skin and sliding his chest across Tony’s back.
“I showed him that I was the best option for him. If I wasn’t, would I bear his mark?” Steve knows this is the truth. Tony is written into his skin, his scent, his very bones. He knows they can all smell it, the veracity of it.
Inside there’s a round table where a few omegas are sitting, chatting with one another. They go on alert as soon as he and Natasha enter, eyes sharp with assessment. Steve is reminded of the omegas in the church basement. Their faces look like they’re waiting for something. Waiting for an alpha to prove he’s just like all the rest, and hurt them. It breaks Steve’s heart to see so many omegas living in fear of what an alpha can do.
“Suck me off, alpha.” Steve immediately gets down on his knees in front of the nest and crawls towards Tony’s groin. He feels powerful, like he can do and be anything for Tony. Hooking his arms under Tony’s thighs as he rests on his chest, he pulls Tony down just a bit to angle him just perfectly at Steve’s mouth. Tony squeaks as he moves, legs flopping open helplessly.
It’s redundant, but Barton warns him about the speeders who are riding his ass, hard. They can’t bank, so he ends up smashing them against walls on a sharp turn through a tunnel.
“You could use SHIELD’s heat service. We know the efficacy of the pills you take. Where do you think they came from? You have months at most before you go into a heat that could kill you without an Alpha, without a change in suppressants.” Tony stopped at Fury’s words. Without turning around, he spoke.
“I tried to protect you, even with the suit, all I’ve ever wanted was to protect you. And I know you deserve better—”
“Like what you see?” And there’s that voice again. The one that makes him want to pant and bend over. Which is how he knows that neither of them could want him. Tony is and has always been a slut. And sluts don’t get beautiful men who want to date them.
The time that one of the first Kaijus in Sicily snapped a claw off right next to Tony’s body, almost impaling him. Or when they both passed out after taking a direct punch to their container, bodies tumbling and hitting the wall. There’s been worse times than this.
“Good times for you. Disappointing for me. Steve is traditional. He wanted to wait.” At that, Steve finally makes it there, Tony’s drink clutched in hand. He passes it to Tony, who takes a large gulp from it, and if Steve doesn’t feel the same way right now. Alcohol has little effect on him, but he drinks his cocktail anyway, the taste doing something for his self-control.
“I wanted to apologize for being a horrible partner to you. I’m sorry. The things I did, which are numerous, were unacceptable. I thought I was doing right by you, but I was wrong. I want so badly to make it up to you, for us to be able to work past it, but I understand and respect if you can’t do that,” he pauses, knowing what he has to say next, and hating it. “If you want to, we can divorce. I’ll claim infidelity on my part.” His throat is so tight from the admittance, he wants to choke on those words. To bring them back and never have said them. But Tony deserves a clean slate. A chance to break free from all Steve has done to him.
“He’s just been bonded, so his next heat would normally come on strong, but his body thinks he’s in danger, so he’s going into stress-induced heats designed to get his alpha to take care of him. We see this in domestic abuse cases all the time, where an alpha aggressor abuses their omega partner less if the omega is in heat. A protective measure.” Steve is horrified. He didn’t think for a single moment that what he was doing would cause this. The beta woman is staring at him, her eyes hard. It dawns on him that she thinks he’s been abusing Tony. He hasn’t–
“Why should we forget? I’ve wanted you too. It’s taken me so long to get there, to realize that every time I thought it was you making me mad, that it was actually just how much I wanted to be more to you. If you mean it—if you mean it Tony, I’d like to be more. I’d like you to be my only.”
is not capable of lifting them up on its own power, but instead starts attempting to peel away their layers with its undignified scratching.
“—respect me? You can’t stop criticizing every move I make on the field. Just last week, you glowered at me like I’d stolen your tiara at the beauty pageant when I went into a collapsing building to save some people
“What? No! No, you’re so good, you’re doing so good for me. Baby, please?” Steve tries to catch Tony’s eyes, to no avail.
Steve pulled off of him, and Tony mewled, helpless. There was a yearning in him, vast and raw, eating him up inside if only Steve would sate it. Steve’s eyes were black, even in the glow of the repulsor light, his eyelashes a shadow on his face. Even still, Tony could see him surveying the scene before him, the slump of Tony’s weeping cock against his stomach, the obscene mess that Steve had painted on his cunt, and Tony’s naked need written on his face.
He hears Tony before he sees him, and the omega comes into the living area with a big grin on his face. It’s something he hasn’t seen before, and he’s thrilled to the bone to have Tony here and happy. His omega should always be happy. Steve should feed him more. Maybe Steve should learn new recipes from this era, like the Mexican food Tony likes to order sometimes, or the Thai. He doesn’t like spicy food, but he knows Tony doesn’t mind it.
“Ok Tony, I’ll see you later.” Steve strides out of the lab with a broad smile on his face and the refreshing determination of once more having a purpose.
“Please,” Tony begs. To stop or to make good. Bucky’s hands are like warm water cascading over his body, and he feels like an animal in fear, ready to snap or go limp beneath its keeper’s grasp.
“Six, thank you.” It continues like that until all twenty-three slaps have been delivered, and Tony is whining and humping at Steve’s leg. He’s not going to punish what seems to be a natural reaction, but he’s not pleased by it either. His omega is wanton, immodest. But ultimately an omega should be able to want their alpha, so he’s got to let this slide.
Steve grunts as his orgasm hits him, his cock spilling out over the floor, twitching. Tony yanks his fingers out and comes around to stand next to Steve’s face.
It is remarkably beautiful, its hair a dark brown and its eyes a light gold that belongs in a sunset rather than set into an animal’s face. It shakes itself like a dog and stands tall in front of Rhodey, not thirty feet away.
“Tony is everything. If I have to become the CEO of his company to protect him, I would do it in a heartbeat.” Steve doesn’t think it will come to that, but he doesn’t have to think about it to know the depths to which he would go to ensure Tony’s happiness. He’s come this far already.
“No, lunch.” JARVIS. How could he forget about JARVIS? He hasn’t revealed anything yet, so he’s as safe as it gets. He measures his own heart rate increasing, and he knows Bucky can also hear it with his enhanced abilities. Steve wants Tony in all the wrong ways, but he’s down in this now, committed, even if he has to look elsewhere to make what needs to happen, happen.
“It’s going to be ok Tony. I promise it will.” Steve’s hands are at Tony’s hips, his thumbs stroking the soft flesh interior to the bones that jut out into Steve’s palms. It feels intimate, and Tony tries to back up, but Steve holds him fast.
“You’re forbidden from going out, even if your friends pay, until you figure out how to cook for yourself. I can’t believe this needs saying, but you’re circumventing the very consequences that will teach you how to take care of yourself.”
Steve enters him in one long stroke, pressing and pressing until he’s seated fully into Tony’s sweet, pink hole. It astounds Steve how Tony can take all of him, his cock being as thick as it is. He feels like he’s hardly in control of himself at the moment, and he pulls out and slams into Tony with a grunt.
“Yeah, Steve. Anytime.” And then Tony makes his daring escape by scurrying out of the room, leaving all of what just happened behind. He’s trying a new thing; leave before you get left.
So he lets it out, his face twisting and crumpling up, his lips pinched with grief over his life, his lack of choices, over every hard thing he’s ever had to endure or overcome. Images of Pepper, Obie, Rhodey, his father float up as he closes his eyes against reality. And lastly, comes Steve. The man who tentatively walked into this room and gave Tony objectively the best sex of his life. Steve broke him into caring, into wanting.
mad, but maybe Tony is right and he hasn’t seen the explosion yet. Thor and Banner add their piece while Cap is glowering and looking pointedly away from Tony, so he throws his arm around the other man.
Tony is sweating, the booze pouring off his skin in the way it does when you marathon drink and then take a short break to catch your breath. He thinks they notice, but he doesn’t really care.
“Yeah. It’s time to get ready. I’m cutting it pretty close with my heat, but it’s still a good idea to go.”
“Stevie, what are you getting yourself into here?” Terror strikes Steve then. Bucky’s going to think awful things of him if he finds out what Steve is thinking. He’ll think Steve is being nosy and maybe self-interested. But because Steve is here, and even though he isn’t committed to telling Bucky his innermost thoughts, he will anyway. That’s what they are to each other, and it means the world to Steve. Not betraying that principle is more important than the morality of the kinds of thoughts he’s having.
Most omegas ceded nest protection to alphas, but there was a small subset that took the duty of caring for the nest to its fullest extent. Steve was one of those rare omegas, though not surprisingly, who considered it their sacred duty to physically defend their home. And Tony, he loved it.
Steve would never stop Tony from working. Never take his money. But he sees how his limiting Tony has been just one form of mishandling.
“You know what? I’m sorry, I don’t want to get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye. I’m gonna say I’m a bit hungover, I’m not sure if you’re real, or if—” Tony said.
“This is beyond you, metal man. The Tesseract belongs to Asgard and Loki will face Asgardian justice!”
It changes everything. Suddenly the position isn’t so much about beating Tony, but something else far more sinister. When Steve’s hand slides down and his fingers curl into Tony’s waistband, Tony knows instantly what Steve wants.
“Steve, that was fucking amazing. Are you going to eat that? What is it? Oh, did you get any garlic bread? You gotta try that next time–”
“Yes, Rogers. Ok, Rogers. I’ll get right on that, Rogers.” His tone drops into a lower register every time he says Steve’s name.
“Is that so?” It doesn’t come out sounding like a question. Steve is inscrutable, his body painted with sweat and slick, muscles in stark relief from dehydration, as beautiful as Tony has ever seen him, achingly so.
“I think what I know is that Tony shouldn’t be messing around with half the things he does in his lab, and that if something has come back to bite him, I should be there.” He tries so hard, but it comes out biting and sharp, too emotionally invested.
The door creaks under his hand, the familiar sound of it soothing. If there’s one thing that’s true of all dimly lit, questionable bars, it’s that they often squeak at the hinges and look perpetually dirty. The sound is safe, familiar, the ambiance wrapping him in like a dark cloak.
“How will your friends have time for me, when they’re so busy fighting you.” The hooked end of the staff tinks against his reactor, blue energy spiraling up the end of the metal to burst out ineffectually at his chest. His sigh of relief is loud in his ears. Tony never thought he’d be grateful to not have enough of a heart to mind control.
Steve is petting up and down Tony’s sides, being so reverent and gentle, while Bucky pinches at Tony’s nipples and grinds his cock into Tony’s backside. It’s an overwhelming amount of sensation and Tony moans, feeling indecent. Steve captures his lips, sucking down the throaty sound, and pries Tony’s mouth open with his tongue, seeking entrance.
“Stop it. Just stop. It doesn’t matter how I feel. I won’t take advantage of you.” Tony backs off, slowly, stepping backward and to the side. Steve trembles with relief, his cock pressing so hard against the seam of his pants, he might burst.
Steve all but lunges for the bed after tossing his suit jacket aside, sidling up to where Tony is and plopping down next to his omega. He wants to hold him, to open his arms, and let Tony sink into them, but he waits for permission.
“I would, if they had advice about how I can get him to cooperate. I don’t suppose you have any on how to get an omega to do what they’re supposed to do.” Steve picks at the side of his cowl below his ear. The hair gets damp and matted there, and he dislikes how it sticks to his head, slick with sweat.
, you love being stuffed full, don’t you? Maybe I’ll have to let Stevie have you again if this is how you are when you have two cocks working you over.”
me. Make me take it. I want—I want you to fill me. Please? Please, please, please, please.” Tony’s breath is punched out as he rides Steve. Steve can barely hold himself back anymore already. Every cry from Tony’s lips drives Steve to new and greater heights. His balls are clenched in desperation, the need to fill Tony taking him excruciatingly higher. Tony is so slick and wet and hot inside. He feels himself start to grow inside Tony, and he throws his head back at the mind-bending sensation. Pleasure roars between them, coursing and flowing back and forth like some underground river.
His omega needs him, is crying for him, and he wants so badly to strip Tony and give him what he’s calling for right here and now.
“Nat! Watching him in that bed, shaking and shivering, no, I didn’t feel good at all. I really do want to change. I don’t want to harm Tony, please. Just help me, please.” He ignores that he felt unaccountably aroused by the meer scent of Tony in a false heat. How Tony’s body drew his own in like a moth to flame. That’s his secret shame to bear.
“But you don’t smell like me.” It makes Steve nervous. He should have asked if he could scent Tony before they left. He’d all but forgotten it’s a thing he could do. It’s not like he didn’t know these things about omegas, it’s just that now that he’s come around to wanting Tony, all of it seems so new and fresh.
“Good omega. So very good,” Bucky croons as he lowers himself down on top of Tony, pressing into the come on his stomach and bracketing Tony’s face with his arms. His body is almost wet and it’s sandwiched between the two men, who, for the moment, are not posturing at one another.
Sunset isn’t deterred. He’d call it brave, but what it’s always been is a serial disregard for the boundaries of others. As if she sees the wall, and thinks that its existence offends her, and she must scale it to see whatever is on the other side, even if there’s bloodletting in the process. Moth to flame, once again she walks towards Tony’s castle of emotion, sticky hands feeling for a way in.
“Tony, that’s disrespectful.” Tony throws down his toast and swallows around what seems like a large lump of unchewed food. He bolts up and strides over to Steve, his body filled with serpentine, tempting grace. He’s still wearing his several day old clothes, but it doesn’t matter. Steve feels the telltale tightening of his pants and takes a step back.
And then there’s Bucky, who, without so much as a by your leave, indicated his interest in the kitchen the other day. Which he doesn’t know how to feel about that. Bucky thrills him whereas Steve grounds him. Steve is sweet where Bucky is pure hedonism. It makes him feel guilty thinking about either one of them in a romantic capacity even though he daydreams of both of them on the daily.
Like a machine, he turns on his senses, the world flowing into his awareness like a comforting embrace, eyes looking for sharp movements as he breathes in deep. Steve is everywhere in the kitchen, all over the counter, the pots and pans, the cabinets. It’s
“Tony! Who’s your friend?” And like that, Steve is there, his golden blond head a counterpoint to the rusty blond streaks in Ty’s hair. Bigger than most alphas, Steve intimidates. He makes other alphas ill at ease. Ty is not immune, and the man takes a step back, removing his arm from Tony, before doing the polite thing and shaking Steve’s hand. Steve, who knows very well who Ty is, beams at him with his best politick smile and shakes the hand.
“Fine, just, fine. We’ll revisit the subject another time.” He takes a deep breath. “In the meantime, I’m releasing you from your budget and you can also go where you please, but just, please let me know where you are. I’d also like to go to one of your events with you.”
But when he gets home, Tony isn’t there. He’s not to be found in his workshop or his bedroom. Steve thinks he’s going to call Pepper when the elevator opens and Tony walks through.
“Tony— ah god, so beautiful when you cry for me, so good. Gonna fill you up sweetheart—” Steve is barraging him now, the V-line of his groin slotted perfectly between Tony’s slick-soaked crevice. He can feel the powerful muscles behind him, working in a staccato on Tony.
When the Captain is down to just his briefs, he palms the bulge of his cock, lightly gripping it as he watches Tony from underneath his lashes.
With tentative movements, he crawls onto the bed, shucking his clothing as he goes. Tony kneels on all fours and breathes out a long and heavy breath. Snatching up the plug, he reaches behind him and circles his fingers around his entrance. He’s wet, practically dripping, ready for Steve to claim him. He wants to feel Steve’s knot stretching him open again, pounding in and out of his hole, wants to feel Steve’s tail brush up against the side of Tony’s ass, hips brushing with each thrust—
“Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?” He throws his playlist on the Quinjet to distract from the fact that he’s grabbing all the data on Loki that they have on file. He slams Loki to the ground with repulsor blasts before landing in front of the man and drawing out every weapon the suit has.
“I’ll tell you what. I’m going to finish my drink and my fries, and then I’m going to get up from this booth and pretend we never had this conversation. Clear?” His friend shoves the last of his fries into his mouth, gets up, and does just what he said, the door clanging shut behind him.
He also wishes Extremis didn’t dominate so much of Tony’s biology. He’d like to see the sweat beading on Tony’s neck, the fine flush that Tony gets when he’s unsure.
“I promise the latter, but not the former.” Bucky’s expression is wicked delight, and he leans down to peck a kiss on Tony’s check. Steve follows him, smile still pasted on as he plants one on Tony’s other cheek.
“And if you find someone you like enough to spend your heat with, you won’t regret it.” Tony sucked in a sharp breath, trying so very hard not to begrudge Pepper’s satisfaction with Happy, a calm Alpha who saw Pep through her heats that Tony hadn’t scented as being all that compatible, but damn if he didn’t wish that were the case. Happy smelled like warm blankets and breakfast food.
“It’s partially true. The part about Tony’s disappointment and how selfish you are being.” Her smile is cutting.
“Because you want me there.” Now is that a flirtatious glance that Cap is throwing his way? Quite possibly. Tony didn’t know the good Captain was even capable of flirting. Bantering, yes.
He feels fevered, and for a moment, he’s back in the cave in Afghanistan. It washes over him, silencing his internal needs like pouring tar onto a machine.
“I’m sorry, I fucked up. I never meant to imply that you weren’t—ok—whole, without those things.” Nat looks soft in this light, and he can see it now, the gentle curve of her jawline, the baby softness of her forearms that’s been sharpened by effort. She hides so well, in plain sight. She’s an Alpha, a beta, and Omega, and none of these things at all.
It’s Tony who breaks the embrace, arms dropping to his sides, a bashful look upon his face. Tony has always been a beautiful olive tone, and with the hormones coursing through his system, he glows. It’s enough that Steve pulls him back into his arms again. Steve intends to keep Tony for a moment, and give him a peck on the cheek, but Tony turns his head at the last second.
Steve reached out again and draws his hand along the alula, down to the primary coverts, ending in a long tug on Tony’s primaries. It gave Tony a full-body shudder and no small amount of sheer panic.
However, if he’d never gone into heat at all, never been kidnapped and held in Afghanistan, he wouldn’t be here, spending the last of his time with Pepper like this. He’d have figured out his heat situation a long time ago.
When he turns around to look for the team, Natasha and Clint are nowhere to be found. Iron Man flies gracefully down somewhat near him, as it’s the only near clean spot to stand on, and drops to the ground, his feet doing a little running step to deal with the momentum.
Steve is silent. This is the crux of the matter with Bucky. Steve is no expert at navigating the line between telling as much of the truth as he can without dooming his cause.
He zips off without waiting, assuming that the Cap ‘n crew are behind him. It’s not like Thor needs to hitch a ride. They can’t wait for Banner either, but Tony hopes he’ll show up in time.
“If we work together at all, I’m sure I will find new and less pleasant reasons to hate you. But I suppose that’s my fucking life now.”
When the woman steps in, his blood runs cold. The first thing he notices, the very first thing, is her empty expression, eyes unblinking, lips parted as her jaw hangs slack from her face. Her outfit is stained with splatters of red and it runs in rivulets down her legs to her uneven shoes; one of the heels is broken off. It’s the blood on her teeth that shocks him into action.
“Are you even sure that’s a good idea? You’ll hate every second of it. You already hate me, so just imagine a room full of me, except it’s mostly alphas and betas, so I suppose you wouldn’t mind me as long as I wasn’t omega. Ok, yeah, fine. I’ll get you a suit. It’s in a little less than a week.”
Tony’s drunk when the screw-crew files in. It’s in the evening, a sweet little dinner date in Stark Tower. And Pepper wasn’t here. But this super-accountant beta was, with his beta spokesperson, and their token Omega. Wrapped in neat little packages were white cloths, seemingly sterile, but truthfully covered in the groin sweat of alphas. And yeah, the sex-ccountant said it had just been a basic swipe over the glands, but come on, if given the chance, alphas rubbed their balls on anything and everything.
“Who am I kidding. If I want your opinion, I’d give it to you. Now suck. Whatever you get on there is all you get for lubricant before I fuck you. You should thank me.” Iron Man pulls out of his mouth, saliva dripping down Steve’s lips and over his chin.
“Something like that. I’m looking for two women who would have been around here in the mid to late 30s. I have names, but not exact ages. Just looking to see what happened to them. If they got out, or—didn’t.”
“I don’t think he wants to be left alone.” There’s a smug little smirk on Bucky’s face as he stares Steve down, and Steve’s nostrils flare as he grimaces.
It turns out Hammer did completely deck out Rhodey’s suit in useless weapons, as if many unusable guns were better than none. It helps then that the armor can repel most of Rhodey’s shots.
He slams into the ren-faire blond with all of his repulsors at maximum, skidding the man across the forest floor.
Clean clothes on, she hauls him up by his elbow, and drags him out the door. The fluorescent lights are brutal after the dimness of his room, and he blinks several times, trying to discern where they’re going.
“Ok, yes. I love you. I love you, Tony.” Tony grunts, crowds himself close to Steve, and comes. Steve feels every filthy pump of the other man’s cock, the warm sluice of fluid a balm on the fissures inside his body.
He’s laying there on the cold ground, covered in pine needles and feeling sorry for himself, when he hears shuffling in front of him. The noise is somewhere between him and the fire and he reflexively tenses, waiting silently for whatever it is to reveal itself.
He’d only synthesized a type of hormonal suppressant when he was fifteen, which was highly illegal. But when his neck had started tingling with sensitivity, he knew Howard would barter him to the highest bidder if he found out that Tony wasn’t a beta or an alpha. It was enough incentive to do a crash course in chemistry at MIT.
“Iron Man, we’re on your three, headed northwest.” He swoops through the streets, running up the avenue with multiple bogeys on his tail. They fire as he pirouettes through buildings, and he tries to get them to aim downward at the ground, rather than the buildings around. It’s hell. Tony doesn’t know how many people are dying right now as the Chitauri relentlessly pour out of the portal.
And then there’s Steve. Tony wants Steve too, and as Bucky starts moving towards him, Tony thinks of running to Steve’s room and asking for protection, even if it means that Steve will want to claim Tony right after.
He’s hunched over like that, hands crossed behind his head when he hears shuffling into the room. He looks up to see Tony standing there, wrapped in a blanket, staring at him.
“Kneel. Show me how sorry you are with your mouth.” Tony reaches up to caress the side of Steve’s jaw, fingers trailing over the edge to rest on his lips, one forefinger sliding between them to break the seam of saliva and enter the parted flesh. Steve feels every glance of Tony’s skin on his, the slow drag of his fingers over stubble and the soft wetness of his own mouth tasting the flavor of Tony’s skin.
Steve jolted, as though shocked by the sudden conversation.  His gaze drifted for a moment, but soon enough it refocused, landing on him.  "What do you want?" he asked softly.
"Hmm," Ma replied, clearly unconvinced.  "I suppose I was hoping it'd be different today, especially when you came home yesterday without having gotten into a fight…"
Eventually, though, it seems like Tony is ready to move on, because he pushes his hands away, reaching down to untuck Steve’s shirt from his pants.  “Thought you wanted me to touch you,” Steve says.
Finally it was moved, and Steve had to stumble back to catch his breath, arms aching a little.  He didn't have long to rest, though—a cluster of four or five biters were practically on top of him now, and he sent the shield flying, kicking as hard as he could afterward to knock the closest biter off of him.  Then he threw himself at them, pushing the biters off the track as the train came bearing down on them.
He swallowed, reaching forward to touch the glove.  “So, uh,” he said awkwardly.  “If you could change my friend Steve back into a human, that would be really great.  Thanks for your consideration?”
Stark didn't respond for a long moment.  "You should get some more rest," he said at last, dropping the conversation.  "I'm going to catalog and pack our things, and tomorrow we'll start heading south."
Steve blanched and shook his head.  Then his eyes lit up, and he started tapping his paw on the ground in a… familiar rhythm.  “Do that again,” Tony said when he stopped, and Steve obliged.  Yeah, definitely familiar.  Son of a gun, he was using Morse code. “Deer,” he repeated.  “Okay, wow, that would have been really useful yesterday.  You should do that more.  Anyway, what, you want to hunt deer?  They have deer here?”  Steve nodded again.
No answer.  Which was a shock, really, because the snow was covered with footprints, suggesting at least somewhat recent activity in the area.  Steve stood there for a while longer and then turned away, about to give it up as a lost cause when movement from the forest caught his eye—a human, it seemed.  A woman, even.  She was dressed warmly, but her clothes were stained with blood and her gait was lumbering and awkward, suggesting some sort of leg injury.  Not wanting her to strain herself more than necessary, Steve rushed to her side, reaching out to take her hands.
"Sure."  Tony dug out the small jar and offered it to Cap, who took it and peered inside.  "It's not much, I know," Tony added.  "Looks like it'll only be the size of a ring, and we only have a third of it right now."
"I—" Cap began as he got up, but Rhodey motioned him to scoot back toward the group before he stood fully.  When he moved, it became obvious that the tile he'd stepped on was slightly sunken—his weight must have triggered the trap.  "I don't have a good excuse.  I'm sorry."
Freed now, he manages to roll off the raft, landing in the water—and Christ, suddenly the wind is back with a vengeance.  But instead of leaving just yet, he pulls out the ring again, and then he takes Steve’s hand and slips it on.  “I l-love you, Steve,” he tells him one more time, voice no more than a whisper.  “I’ll always love you.  I-I’ll always be yours.  And I p-promise you I’m g-going to fly, a-and I also promise you—I a-also promise you we’re going t-to meet again.”  He hauls his upper body back onto the raft enough to press one last, fleeting kiss to Steve’s cold lips, and then he makes himself let go.
The other man’s frown only deepened as he knelt down, as though that would somehow make him see what Tony was seeing.  “Empty space could mean a lot of things,” he said.  “It could just be an underground spring.  Or maybe lava flows.  I’m not digging a hole so we can fall into lava.”
He glanced at something behind Steve, and by instinct, Steve whirled around, but it was too late—there was another man standing down the hall holding something, and the next thing he knew, there was a whoosh, something sharp—a tranquilizer dart?—coming at him.  He blocked it with his shield in time, but another one had already struck Tony, who crumpled helplessly to the ground.
Reality crept back into Tony's thoughts, and the urge to smile disappeared.  "I heard an explosion go off," he said.  "I wanted to find Jarvis."
Tony tunes him out, and for a moment, he stops thinking of Steve, his mind turning instead to his future.  Running a company with Howard and Sunset.  Designing weapons that can explode and pierce and kill.  Never again making a single decision on his own.  Maybe leading a life his father will finally be proud of.
"You don't recognize me," the other man said, as though reading Tony's mind.  "You ruined me, and it didn't even matter to you."
Stark sighed again, shaking his head.  "Because we already looked into it.  Once you turn, you start… rotting.  All the bits of your brain responsible for high-level thought just… waste away.  There's no going back.  And I know what you're going to say next, so—"  Stark cut off, getting up to put all the candles out.  "Look outside, Steve."
"Maya, it's over," Steve replied wearily.  "Tem is dead.  The stadium is burning down and we're surrounded by biters."
Except then she breaks up with him, and as if on cue, the rest of his life falls apart.  His armor is used to kill innocent people.  The mansion is burned down.  The Avengers are forced to disband.
.  How many people lived on the East Coast in 1945?  God, didn't New York City alone have at least a few million, even in the 40s?  Were all their lives really going to be in danger if Tony didn't do something about it?
"We'll have to cross the Housatonic sooner or later," Tony sighed.  "No, let's just go back to the Merritt now.  Just… keep an eye out for any biters that are close by.  We're going to need them."
Steve stared at him in horror.  By now, he'd fully accepted that sometimes they had no choice but to kill the biters, and that in any case, they were already dead in all the ways that mattered.  But this—this was excessive.  "There
“Of course I do.”  Of course he didn’t.  What did Rogers think, that he had a map of this place tucked away somewhere?  Not that he wanted Rogers to think otherwise, really.  If he knew just how clueless Tony was, no doubt he’d bodily haul him up and take him back to the airship, and that was the last thing Tony needed, regardless of how mentally pleasing the image was.  Best to fake confidence.  “Just follow me.”  At the very least, he knew they had to go in
Steve is blinking rapidly at all this, seemingly trying to take it all in.  Finally, he manages, his voice weak, “Is there anyone on the ship you
Tony exhaled, closing his eyes and leaning back against the tree trunk he was seated against.  "You were right," he said.  "I did open Pandora's Box.  And this is what came out."
When the pyre finally burned itself out, Steve gathered up everything that hadn't turned to ash, and he carefully placed the pieces into a shallow hole he'd dug earlier.  It was one of several—he'd made a hole for each of the dog tags he'd collected during the journey south, and then he'd buried each of the soldiers one by one as the fire had roared behind him.
Tony laid damp and shivering on the pile of thin blankets that served as his bed afterward, watching Yinsen stir something in a pot over a fire and keeping his breathing in time with the motion of Yinsen's hand.  It was mildly soothing, and at this point he would take any comfort he could get.
“There are things I couldn’t say even in front of just Jan and Hank,” Tony admits softly as he lets his eyes shut, pretending for a little while that Steve is sitting in front of him listening, alive and well.  “Things I couldn’t say even in front of just myself earlier.  But this is my last chance, and if I don’t say these things now, I know I’ll always regret it.”
He stalked off, and Tony sighed, closing his eyes and tipping his head back against the lockers.  Maybe he was in the wrong. Ty was his friend here and now (and they were
“Sorry, Steve,” he said, taking a deep breath and resting his fingers against the gem in his chest.  “But you’re much more important to the world than Iron Man.”  And he pulled the gem out.
Damn it.  Steve hurled his shield straight at the biter currently struggling with Stark, throwing it off of him as Stark blinked in surprise.
had mattered to him.  And that… that was pretty much a minor miracle, really.  Tony had never been able to imagine that a person like Cap would ever think that way.
His mouth tasted of cotton when he awoke, and it took a few moments for him to come to the realization that there was literal cotton in his mouth.  With some effort, he forced his eyes open, seeing white walls that looked blue in the darkness of night and a large shape folded into a chair beside him.  "Tony?" he tried, but speaking was impossible—there was something over his mouth, and he couldn't spit out the cotton.
Tony really needs to learn one of these days that unbridled drinking does, in fact, come with consequences.  Then again, would knowing that stop him?  Probably not.  Still, he thinks as he tries not to squint
The first finger goes in all the way, and the second and third go in a little faster after that.  Soon enough, Steve is arching away from the leather seats, sweating and trying not to writhe as Tony curls his fingers, smirking down at him.  “Do you like that?” he purrs, fingers moving inside him.  Steve whimpers.  “God, you’re so gorgeous like this—I should get a camera and record you; I bet I could play it all day and not get tired of it—”
The pain was immediate.  His whole body seemed to shudder, and suddenly breathing was much harder than it should be.  Still, he managed to grab hold of the gauntlet, pressing the gem into the empty indentation with shaking hands and watching as the whole thing lit up.  Then he turned back to look at Steve, who was still regarding him with shining eyes as the last of the sun disappeared from view.
They took off.  It wasn't long after that when he could hear the pelting of bullets hit the ground—they'd been spotted, clearly, though the planes were still too far away to be accurate.  It was nonetheless enough to make Tony's pulse jump, and not for the first time, he was grateful that the coil of orichalcum was there to keep his heart beating, no matter how fast it was going.
Tony.  The name stirred something in him, fuzzy memories of a half-remembered dream over a decade old.  He'd known a Tony, once. No, even more than that - he'd
Tony pursed his lips.  "Didn't Rhodey give you the talk on how you shouldn't be feeding my ego?  Because this is feeding my ego."
“I know.”  And though Tony seems to be enjoying the banter, he’s apparently getting antsy, because the next thing Steve knows, he’s on his back while Tony’s leaning over him, his eyes dark.  “I’m also impatient and demanding.  So are you going to touch me or not?”
Steve's mom - ugh, Tony definitely needed a better way to refer to her as in his head, because just calling her "Steve's mom" wasn't really working for him - looked down at the offered plate, lips twitching.  "Very fancy," she said as she reached forward with shaking hands to accept it. "I already know this is going to make me all better." But then her gaze shifted toward Tony, turning stern. "But if you get sick, I'm not going to be very happy with you."
pull out were more photographs.  "This is an inscription found in Qufu.  See these two characters?  Same tiger-circle combination as the oracle bones from Yinxu.  And what's more—"  He shuffled the photos to display still more examples of the oracle bone script.  "These are other instances in which the characters for tiger and/or circle appear.  But these are written differently.  Simpler.
He was in the middle of imagining a heroic-looking cover when Steve burst into action in front of him, letting out a ferocious roar and pouncing at something.  He looked in time to see what he assumed was a deer try to leap away before being swiped at with one massive paw—it went down in a heap of flailing limbs, then disappeared under Steve’s mass.  After a moment, Steve pulled away, and the deer was quiet and unmoving, blood dripping from its neck.
"You heard her," Cap said, holding his hand out for Tony to take.  Tony did so, pulling himself up with a grunt.  There was some pain in his side, which from a glance looked like an arrow had grazed him, but he'd worry about that later.  Better hurt than dead, in any case.
“Yeah,” Steve whispers right back.  “T-the lifeboats will be b-b-back in a moment, once the s-ship is gone…”
“What?”  Steve looks down at himself as well.  “What’s wrong with these clothes?” he asks, sounding just a tad bit defensive.
"No," Steve said, immediately shying away, even if it made him stumble over his own feet.  It'd been a long time since he'd felt so uncoordinated.  "Let me."
Steve looked at him.  Tony thought he could see something in his eyes—it looked almost like sadness, and Tony found himself terrified that Steve might be able to read him, to know what was going on in his head.  That was the last thing that he wanted.  Steve liked him.  Tony didn't want that to change.
Tony's gaze turned to him again, his expression a mix of confusion and cautious hope.  "What are you trying to say, Steve?" he asked softly.
So Tony continued on, making his way toward the sunlight he hadn't seen in weeks.  Not much later, the enemy finally gathered its wits enough to begin to rain fire down upon him.
The revelation dropped on him like a heavy weight, and for a moment, Steve could do nothing but stare at Tony blankly.  His fault?  How was that even possible?  Why would Tony ever partake in something so terrible in the first place?  "I don't understand," he managed at last.
.  And if dinosaurs were here, if they could somehow exist in this land out of time… then surely something magical could be here too.  He just had to find it.
When Steve starts putting on the suit jacket, Tony turns away again, hastily shoving everything back inside before shutting the armoire and turning toward him.  “Need help with that?” he asks when he sees Steve fiddling with the bow tie.  Without waiting for an answer, he jumps over the couch, bringing his hands up to help him secure it around his neck—and
"They're people," Steve hissed back.  "We're in this together."  Before Stark could dissuade him further, Steve stepped away, lowering his shield.  "Hey," he said loudly to the trees around him.  "We know you're here.  But it's alright.  We're friendly."
.  But it’s not enough.  It’ll never be enough.  Tony had wanted forever, and in the end, all he’d gotten was a fraction of eternity.  And now—now this is it.  After this, he’ll never be able to spend another moment with Steve Rogers.
Steve still doesn’t show him what his words say.  He keeps his watch on at all times, even during lovemaking and in the shower—Tony’s own fault, really, for giving him a waterproof watch.  Then again, Tony can’t blame him.  It’s not like Tony ever feels inclined to show Steve his own words, mostly because that would require looking at them and being reminded of Sunset.
It was worth it, he thought, to have to survive in a world like this for the chance to know Tony again.
The others managed.  Tony didn't know how, but they got him to calm down, and then Wasp reached forward, placing a gentle hand against Steve's shoulder.  She was touching him, her palm against his body, something Tony had longed to do for years. He could do it now, but he was still frozen here, and anyway - he didn't deserve it.  Not after what had happened. It was one thing to have found peace when his worst mistake was lost to time and the currents; it was another when it was right here, staring him in the face.
Tony shrugged to himself.  Well, if Rogers wanted to stay up for no reason, that was his prerogative.  But Tony was going to sleep.  “Good night,” he said.
There were still several rows ahead of him, enough that he couldn't jump over them.  And the old routine of dusting the tiles and translating them hit a snag at the translation part—he was now surrounded by tiles that he could see but not read, and Pepper had been unable to find any matching characters in the documents she'd brought.  In short, he had no idea which tile was safe.
Huh.  “So what do you want?  Captain America?  Cap?  Steve?”  Rogers nodded enthusiastically at that last one, and Tony laughed.  Apparently, almost dying while in his presence put them on a first-name basis with each other now.  “Okay,” Tony said.  “Steve.  What now?”
Steve was interesting.  Tony had spent enough time as him to know that there were some subjects he wasn't as strong at (to put it delicately), but he always seemed determined to keep learning.  And even for the things that were clearly over his head - like the microbots Tony was working on in his spare time, or the programs he was writing for his compsci class - he still wanted to hear Tony talk about them, as though he'd picked up on the fact that these were things that Tony
And Tony knew that he was feeling what Tony could feel rising in himself again: there was his pulse.  There was that beat that carried the memory of Steve. It was erratic, but it meant that he was still alive.  Against all odds, he was alive.
“Do you remember what you told me earlier?  About the percentage display in my chest?  You thought I was going to die if it reached zero.  And you were right.  If the repulsor pump stops, so does my heart.  But I lied about it, because I was desperate.  I’ve been everywhere, Steve.  I’ve been traveling the world for years.  If it weren’t for the war, I would have kept looking.  But I was at the end of my rope, and I thought here… here would be my last, best chance.  And that if it failed, then it wouldn’t matter if it reached zero anyway.  Because without something to fix it, it’ll be zero sooner rather than later.”
“Can I get a rain check on that?” Tony replies, and he flies off into the air before Steve has a chance to reply.
—but the other man is already pulling down his pants and underwear, and Steve lifts up his hips, making it easier.  He just—he can’t help it.  He hasn’t gotten any in a
Steve doesn’t reply for a while, but then he leans forward and pinches Tony along the jaw.  “Hey!” Tony yelps, jerking away.  “What was that for?”
He scrambled out of his chair and dove for the closet, pulling out the briefing materials he'd just stashed away before grabbing the pencil on his desk and starting to write.
one of his first questions was to ask about Tony - God, what could he even say to all of that?  He knew what he
Cap furrowed his brows at Tony.  "Just to be clear," he said, "you blame yourself for both Rhodey and Jarvis.  And probably Pepper, too."
"Good night, Mom," Steve managed.  He stayed seated in his chair as she straightened, blew him a kiss, and left, taking the lavender scent with her and leaving him feeling an odd mix of emotions.  Disappointment, because after waiting the whole day to see Tony's Pa, he was left empty-handed. Relieved, because if he were being honest with himself, he'd been a little scared of the prospect.  And sad, because… Tony's Ma had looked sad. Tony seemed to think so highly of her, Steve couldn't help but just… want the best for her. And it didn't really seem like she had that. He wanted to cheer her up.
"Tony? What are… what can I help you with?" Maria asked as she stood up, and Tony bit the inside of his cheek and hope the woman didn't notice his strained smile, '
Deep breathes; Tony could only take deep breathes as he tried to calm himself, wondering what he was going to tell Angie… Tony, a major part of him wanted to take everything he owns and make a run for it, ignoring the house and the town and the people living here, if only Tony had more freedom… he should have left the country the first chance he had, maybe then he wouldn't be stuck here helpless and not knowing what to do.
Steve gasp as he finally reached the hospital, getting out of the car while Bucky was still parking, ignoring the Alpha's shouts for him to look out as an ambulance rushed in front of Steve making him freeze until the car passed him before he continued his run, ignoring how his friend was ordering him to calm down and stop before a car hit him this time. And how can Steve calm down when his husband was in the hospital?
"Oh, God, are you hurt?" Tony panic when he saw the tears sliding down Harley's face as he starts muttering '
"The Burn!" Tony called out as he starts laughing like no tomorrow while shooting two bots avoiding the other three that turned to him and rushed to attack, but Tony grin happily when a Shield sale through the air and hit the three bots, ripping their heads off of their bodies. "Hello, gorgeous." Tony said as his eyes fell on Steve, which caused the Alpha to give a smile in return and throw his Shield at another bot that was coming to him.
Tony… Tony, really wanted Steve to ask him out, he really wanted to go with the Alpha on a date, he knows that the Alpha is different from any other Alphas out there; he knows that the Alpha won't stab him in the back. But the Omega know for sure that the Alpha won't ask him out, that he was waiting for Tony to ask him, which made Tony more flushed then he can handle, how in the name of God was he going to ask Steve on a date? The Omega had never been asked, and it made Tony bite his lip with a flushed face, a smile taking over his face at the thought of Steve saying 'Yes' to him, and it made Tony's heart flutter at that, at Steve being his Alpha, and maybe, in the end, being his mate.
"Peter!" Tony cried out as he tried to run to the burning mansion, only to get pulled away by Peggy and Bucky as the two of them tried to calm him and make him stop thrashing; not something that will happen, not until Tony has his son in his own arms. Tony should have stayed in the mansion, he should have stayed to protect Peter and Steve, but he didn't, he didn't, and now the two of them are in the burning mansion, probably dead. "Peter!" A sob left Tony as he tried to make Peggy and Bucky let go of him, but it wasn't working, the two of them had a strong grip on his armor, restraining Tony's movement.
Steve closed his phone and stood up; he stretches his body, hearing the cracked coming from his back making him wince. He looked around the room until his breath hitches as he saw a Beta heading toward them. Steve power-walked toward the doctor which gain Howard's attention, the older Alpha gasped at that and stood up from his chair, waking up Maria and Angie in return. "How are they?" Steve breathed out when he stood in front of the doctor; the doctor looked at Steve and squeaked, he then calmed down as he saw Maria and Howard run toward them, Peggy and Angie not that far behind. "Well?" Steve snapped he knows he shouldn't have done that, but he was too worried to care about manners right now.
With a cry Tony came across his belly and Steve's chest and feeling the muscles contract rhythmically around his dick, Steve spilled himself in that hot and wet passage, his teeth locking on Tony's neck where his bonding gland was, which gained him nothing but a cry and a smaller orgasm from the Omega; Steve rocked into Tony to draw it out for both of them until they were both too sensitive.
He failed so spectacularly that the evidence was sitting in front of him, in the form of a stick with a positive line, glaring at him from its place on the table, informing him how much of a failure he was that he fell for the lies of someone he once considered a lover and a friend.
Going inside, Steve paused when he saw James curling around himself, holding his head with both of his hands as he was lying on the floor, his breath coming out in short gasps as he choked on a whimper that wanted to leave his throat, and Steve didn't know what to do, should he rush to the man or should he call Tony?
Two hours later; the two of them finally arrived at the mansion, both of them relaxed and content. Steve couldn't help but smile happily when he saw Bucky's face more open and relaxed since he started living with him and Tony, and it made Steve feel like he was able to accomplish something good. The two of them truly enjoyed their day out, exchanging funny stories and moments that happened a long time ago, Bucky finally opened up to him and told him about the art he used to make and about his days in the military, it made Steve truly happy that Bucky was getting out of his shell.
Steven hummed as he came toward Tony taking the book from his hands and flipping through the pages a little with a thoughtful look on his face. "It talks about Ragnarok, its Asgard history." Steven said as he closed the book, making Tony squeak and look at Steven then at the book.
In any other situation, the shock on Tony's face would have been funny, but not today; today was too much, too much to handle that Steve felt like he was going to bend with the weight he was forced to carry. "I… I wanted… I thought I… I thought I could protect the two of you, so I stayed in the lab trying to…" Tony's voice was small when he said those words, but even then, Steve didn't want to listen to them, and he didn't want to hear one of Tony's futuristic delusions.
"Of course you would do sweetheart… now come and put some sunscreen on my back," Tony said which made his husband perk up like a puppy and rush toward Tony, causing a smile to twitch on Tony's lips. Turning on his stomach, Tony let out a content purr when his husband's big and strong hands start running over his back, giving him a massage while spreading the sunscreen.
Tony hummed to himself as he finally finished tidying the living room, and the doorbell ringing made him jump and rush toward the door, he pauses a little to tidy himself and ruffle his hair a little, then he stopped when he noticed what he was doing, which made him grumble with a flushed face and look throw the peephole, smiling when he saw that it was Steve and Peter, which caused him to open the door the smile still painted his face. "Good morning, Steve, bambino…" Tony said as he opened the door, getting a small smile from Steve and wave from Peter who was carried in his father's arms, yawning a little as he hides his face in his father's neck.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, Fluffiest fluffs, a little bit of sadness, cuteness! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
"Yes, it was true, but at that time, he had an off and on relationship, I did confess though, but something happened, something big, that made us separate… we married when he was fifty-seven, by that time, I didn't care that much about having sex, and I know that my husband couldn't keep up with me even when he wanted to and because of that he always got frustrated by not being able to do so, but I never cared for that, I loved my husband enough that I forsake any sexual pleasure for his comfort and happiness… if Rogers really loves you as you say, then he will understand, and he won't touch you until you think that you are ready for it, and not doing it just because he wanted it." Steven said while looking at Tony in the eyes wanting the Omega to understand how important it was.
Tony glared at the Alpha, who was carrying the children in his arms when they latched into him, causing them to give a loud shriek of laughter, the movement in his arms made him look down at Peter who was looking at Steve with like he wanted to go in and participate in the fun, glaring at the other pups with a pout on his face, lips wobbled a little as he hides himself in Tony's chest. That made Tony bite the inside of his cheek and look at the room once again glaring at the Alpha hoping that he will burn by the power of his glare alone, no pressure, huh? What a fucker.
Nebula's mission this time was easy, it was far easier than she had thought; find the witch who cast an ancient spell on the Space stone the day of the invasion. A mission that was far easier than Nebula thought her father capable of, especially when he was still bent on punishing her for failing to invade earth that faithful day.
"I don't know, are you sure you can handle me?" Steven asked, worrying about hurting Peggy. She only gave him a challenging and mysterious smile, which made the blond step in the boxing ring, sending a challenging smile.
"I said... me and Tony are courting." Steve said which made Peggy snarl and take a step toward the Alpha which made the man back away from the raging woman who was glaring daggers with her eyes, Tony was shifting uncomfortably in the back trying to make himself smaller than he already was and Steven didn't even know what to do or feel at this point.
Steven ended up saying which got an enraged scream from Margaret, but the Omega didn't give it a mind, he just stood up and went deeper into the cell raising the fabric the Iron King left for him a relieved smile twitched on his lips when he saw that they were pants and tonic with leather shoes, he then wore the pants under the dress, grumbling to himself when the dress got in his way, which Steven ended up ripping it to be able to wear the pants without some frilly fabric getting in his way.
Steve turned his gaze toward Tony, giving the Alpha a tired smile; his Tony was still foolish after all these years, the Alpha with the biggest heart there is. Steve never ever wanted to be one of the reasons that will cause Tony pain and hurt; he always wanted his Alpha to be happy, he wanted Tony to smile and grin and laugh and have the life that he always wanted and deserved, even if it meant that he will have to leave Steve in the end. Steve just wanted Tony to be happy.
"But this is grandma's home Mr. Stark, am not running away!" The pup said which made Tony blink at that and turn to look at Sarah who was hugging the huge Alpha, that made Tony blink and shook his head turning to the pup with a smile.
It was past eight and Steve and Tony chatting about this and that, Tony was pleased that Steve told him a little bit about himself, which the Omega did the same, sharing with the Alpha a few stories about his adventures in the neighbor and Winnie's attempts at matchmaking, which ended up making the Alpha laugh like it was no tomorrow. "Please tell me Winnie didn't try and set you up with Bucky." Steve pleas with a smile, face flushed from laughing.
"I know some of the stories… old man Philips always talk about the Shield." James offered, still too distracted to tell Anton any information of use. "I know the Shield was a present to Mama, someone gave it to him as a thank you for saving them… old man Philips said the Shield with the star was the weapon Mama used to fight with the Hydra king when the monster killed my grandmother; old man Philips even swore on Odin that Mama was nearly succeeded in killing the Hydra king before he was betrayed and nearly killed!" James whispered his words full of awe and adoration, making Anton wonder how much of the child's words had truth to them.
It took Tony a few seconds (Minute? Hours?) Before Tony finally, regain control of himself and when he finally did, he couldn't help but let a loud shriek of '
"It does not matter, he is here now… you should know, foolish king, an oath breaker is not welcomed in any land he travels to, and misfortune will follow them wherever they settle," Steven stated, taking a small stone beside him and throw it in the lake, gazing at the ripple that was caused by the stone dropping in the lake. The king shuffled beside Steven, making the Omega close his eyes and letting out a tired sigh. "Just ask the question on your mind, your movements are annoying me," Steven opening his eyes and gazing at the lake once more.
By the time, Tony's knot had gone down; Steve had managed to doze off. Steve felt the draw of sleep pulling him further as he snuggled closer to the man beneath him. He knew that at some point they'd need to talk this all over, but Steve couldn't hold back a smile as he looked up at Tony.
It made Howard wonder, but he was glad that Tony had finally found the happiness he was after; it made Howard glad that Tony could finally smile and laugh without the weight of the world on his shoulder. It made Howard relax when he sees such a loving Alpha treat his son like he was the Alpha's world.
All in all, everything was good, everything was perfect, better, much safer than it was a few days ago… or at least that's what Tony liked to convince himself. Tony doesn't know if Rhodey and Pepper knew or suspected that something was amiss in the house or in the town; Tony knew that the past few days were hard and strained on everyone's nerves even when everyone was trying to hide the truth.
"His name is Peter." Steve said which made Jarvis give a small smile, picking the blanket that slid from the pup in his constant movement and covered him with it.
Today is the day… Today is the day and it had finally arrived; the big day that Tony dreamed about for years. Disbelieve, hope, joy, fear, wonder, and most importantly love, all swirled in Tony's heart and mind, causing him to be left breathless as his mind went wild with hope. Tony could only gaze at the mirror in front of him, his eyes wide with wonder as he took in the sight in front of him; the white suit hugged his body like a lover's embrace bringing out the best of him, the hair that was styled in a way that made him a perfect mix of feminine and masculine, the light makeup highlighted his eyes, and painting his lips pink, the pretty flowers in his arms, the glowing skin… Tony couldn't believe this was him.
"What… do you mean?" Anton asked, fearing the answer to that question; Jamti did nothing but close his eyes, whispering the word '
The pup blinked a little and then shrugged. "I lost him!" The chirp in the boy's voice held so much cheerfulness it made Tony nearly faint when he realizes the pup had run away from his father and now his very much worried Huge/Scary/Alpha father was searching for him… the universe really wanted Tony to die.
"It's simple, I can have my son, my heir, marry someone of your… background." Mr. Carbonell said which made Steve contain a hiss as he heard the older man spit the last word like it was some kind of poison.
"Idiot…" Steve murmured, trying not to wince by his scratchy voice, he just tried to clear his throat as best as he can and swallow some saliva, trying to moisture his throat. A smile twitched over Steve's lips when he saw Tony nuzzle his head in Steve's hand; a groan of annoyance left Tony as he let out a yawn. Tony's grumbling informed Steve that he was going to wake up any minute now, causing Steve to feel his heart speeding up at the possibility of seeing his Alpha after what seemed like a long time…
"It's OK, sweetheart, come here." Tony smiled as he opened his arms, which caused Peter to sob and rushed toward him, hugging Tony tightly as he shook. "Harley, you too…" Tony gazed at Harley offering one of his arms to the boy as he waited for him; finally after what seemed like forever, Harley slide down the couch and into Tony's arms holding tightly as he let out small sobs. "It's OK, nothing bad happened, it's just a glass of water; I am just glad that none of you are hurt," Tony reassured the kids, kissing the top of their heads as he let out his calming pheromones, humming gently to the boys until both of them calmed down. "Now that you two calmed down, why don't you go and wash your faces, I will come and serve dinner after I clean the glass, OK?" Tony asked, getting a nod from both Harley and Peter as the two of them let go and went to do as ordered.
Rhodey licked his lips trying to remember furrowing his brows until he realized the missing link… he should have known… "In 1999, Howard came to Tony about the presentation in Japan, he practically ordered Tony to go, saying all the while that if the Alpha did it right he will be officially the CEO, Tony didn't care about that, but the money he will get will be what he needs so his plan will go into action… when he returned after a month the Omega had already left, took his clothes and possession with him, and Tony said he saw his ID sitting on the table the one that said he was a Stark, not the fake one he made Jarvis make him, his father came into his apartment after an hour of Tony's return telling him about how the Omega practically blackmailed him for money… I should have believed Tony when he told me that the Omega wouldn't do such a thing, but I just thought it was like Sunset's situation all over again and brushed it off… Tony searched for the Omega for two months after that, until he received a letter from him… I don't know what the letter said exactly but I am sure it said nasty things because shortly after that he starts drinking and sleeping around…" Rhodey said looking at his feet trying to think of what's going to happen, wondering if the Omega was dead, wondering if the pup was dead or was giving to another family, or worse.
"What?" Tony asked when he turned his face toward his friends, both of them looking at him with small smiles and wistful faces, making Tony a little worried about the way they acted like, but both of them just chuckle and shook their heads. Angie chooses that moment to return with their food, coffee for Pepper and Rhodey, and orange juice for him, glaring at him darkly until he swallowed down the juice in a single long gulp, grimacing at the sharp taste and hating how Angie walked away with pride.
Tony couldn't believe what his ears heard right now, all these years thinking that Steve left him, thinking that Steve was disgusted by him, all these years... after all these years Tony finally knew the truth, after so much pain and heartache and feeling betrayed, it was all one of Howard's mind games, his Steve was out there, his Steve was struggling for years without Tony, his Omega was pregnant with their pup, a pup… a child that was part of him and Steve… Tony let a sob at that. "JARVIS, search for Steve Rogers, use face recognition if you have, just find him as soon as you can." Tony's voice cracked as he ordered the AI to find the Omega, he needed to find Steve.
"I refuse to marry that harlot or that bastard of a brother she has! I am the king! I decide who I will mate and have children with! Everyone knows that my actions with Hamar were justified especially when I am the law!" Anton growled at the piece of metal he was working on; probably daring it to say otherwise, daring it to return Anton's words with mockery and refusal, and hoping secretly that his friends will have his side in this, which they all were, but there was no refusing the elders this time. Anton knew it was past his marriage time, everyone reminds him of that, that every year passes without marriage his judgment became doubtful in everyone's eyes; Anton knew that he should have married years ago with all of their friends when his age was twenty. Anton knew he shouldn't have waited for the Omega who ended up breaking his heart, because of that, Anton probably knew about everyone in the village being disappointed with him living a loner life with no Omega to care of him or his babe, to give him stability in life.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness a lot of it, maybe a little bit of violence, a near-death experience, and Tony losing his mind! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"That'll be messy," Carol said.  Steve could tell she was trying to tease from the way her lips curved upward, but there was real fear in her eyes.  "I guess you would've offered something smaller if you had it."
But Starks are made of Iron, and so she covers her wounds with an AI that coaches her through breathing sessions after an attack. She hides her weaknesses with a watch that can turn into a gauntlet and the best security system humanity has to offer and JARVIS constantly scanning the area for potential threats.
It seems like a good way to leave things off; pleasant and cordial with no room for an argument or tension and a hopeful prospect for their next meeting.
She gets changed in record time, pulling on a pair of overalls and tying her hair into a ponytail before making her way down into her workshop where Steve is stretched across the couch, earbuds in and concentration completely on the tablet he uncomfortably holds.
“Sleep is for losers Cap. I have better things to do.” Tony’s words would have had more bite if not for the absent-minded way he’s rubbing the reactor, and Steve knows enough about the device to keep quiet.
Without thinking, he cups her face and rubs the wetness off her cheeks, “Toni,” his tone is sad and imploring and he doesn’t even know what he’s asking for.
Toni rolls her eyes, “Patience Barton, give me a couple more hours. I’ll get them to you by tomorrow.”
He’s about to tell her to give Howard Stark some respect. About to defend the friend that helped him when no one else would. But Fury tells her to take a seat and she does, carelessly propping one foot on the table as they go through the situation.
She’s smart; he’d give her that. He doesn’t understand one word coming out of her mouth but the others seem impressed and he marvels at the fact that she’s learned this all in one night.
And they’ve danced this dance so many times that it doesn’t quite resonate to Steve when the building – fourteen stories of heavy rock and marble – crashes down like a house of cards and there is no euphoric sound of victory or blaze of red and gold and life anywhere in sight.
But then it's dark and she’s lying in bed with an ache on her right and a larger ache behind her rib cage and she can barely see the letters on her wrist but can feel the words on the tip of her tongue and she nearly died and she may die tomorrow or the day after because the world she lives in is merciless and cold.
She wants to laugh, tease him about his poor use of language, haul him close and kiss the fear out of his eyes. She’s never seen fear in his eyes. She doesn’t really like it.
She’s cordial and inexplicably distant and Steve presumes it's for the best; all they ever do is argue with each other anyway. The only reason he’s here is because Fury threatened to kick him out if he didn't leave SHIELD.
“-orry, Sorry. I thought – I thought that was what you meant when you said feelings and I kind of assumed because – wishful thinking I guess. Can we just forget this happened and-”
“What you doing up Cap?’ Tony asks softly, concerning bleeding through the words without explicit permission.
The muffled curse isn’t quiet enough for Steve to miss and Tony gives him a distracted excuse and full reign to do whatever and go wherever and ask Jarvis if he needs anything before he’s running out of the largest gym that Steve’s ever seen his tone placating as he speaks to Pepper Potts over the phone, “Pepper, light of my life, holder of my...”
She grabs his SHIELD given phone out of his hands and holds it with her thumb and index finger as if it were a disease, “What on earth is this? Nope. You are not allowed in my tower with this kind of garbage.”
“Shortest straw has to get Tony out of the lab,” Clint says, putting down the video game and making his way towards his best friend.
He scans the large expanse of a gym and makes his way to the punching bags, all six hanging at a reasonable distance from one another next to the weights, “So you help us as well.”
Natasha looks at him and Steve looks at Tony. It’s Tony that responds, “Cap, you and Widow take care of that. Barton, I need you on the roof. Clench up.”
Steve feels the beginnings of a smile start to form at the comfortable, familiar sort of bickering that has slowly integrated into his life. The smile falls flat when Natasha, still watching Jarvis’ feed from beside him, slowly speaks in a voice that cannot be described as anything but bone-chilling, “Stark, that building is going to collapse.”
Steve’s hands are as terrified as his words, she blinks her eyes open, trying to focus her feeling into the way he cups her jaws, running his other hand through her hair in a motion so erratic, she’d like to humour herself and pretend it's desperation she’s feeling.
He regrets not looking when he hears an amused huff of laughter and the two fall into the comfortable silence that’s slowly becoming their new normal despite the fact that it puts the fear of God into Steve.
He doesn’t expect the loud, resonant laugh that belts out of her and she clutches her stomach and points at him, “Holy shit that’s crazy. I mean its one thing to know your dad’s an asshole but I thought crazy was pushing it. I guess Howard wasn't off his rocker after all.”
And maybe Pepper and Rhodey was the universe’s way of apologizing for giving her such a shitty life and maybe she’ll love them more than she’ll love anyone but she curses their existence for a split second because they burst into the room with reckless abandon and all but throw themselves at her, fretting over the hallow in her cheeks and the stitch on her skin and the fear that they felt.
It's only three years later, as they’re drinking at a bar and temporarily being relieved of their respective duties as wingman and wingwoman that an extremely drunk Toni shows a semi sober Rhodey the writing on her wrist.
Her curiosity is the only reason why she enters the code for the workshop and walks towards the steaming plate of pot pie, a hasty note scribbled on paper she didn't know she owned.
Tony’s eyes hit the heavens before piercing him again, “You never do Rogers.” Steve feels his spine stiffen slightly and he’s about to retort with something that could potentially ruin this whole thing but Tony keeps going, “Besides, all they want to talk about is how we could make more money than we already are and it's not as if they don't know I'm playing candy crush under the table.”
And it’s this idea of looking out for your teammates, the responsibility he has as Captain and certainly not the exhilarating prospect of seeing Tony for the first time in hours, that prompts Steve to get up from his seat and make his way to the elevators, “No need, I’ll do it this time.”
It feels like she’s in a flurry of constant movement after that, despite being advised to do just the opposite and her two best friends watching her like a hawk to ensure that she abides by the Doctor’s instructions.  She gets a heavenly soup made by Natasha, and the most gentle hug Thor is capable of, and Clint lets her win Mario Cart and Bruce promises to blow things up in the lab with her after she gets better.
She just rolls her eyes, “Ya, I know. Aliens are real and you can't shoot lasers from your eyes. My whole life was a lie.”
The door is unlocked when he walks in and the music is obnoxious and loud but it stops a second after he enters.
He carefully guides her to the couch that he occupies more than she does and hears her mumble as he’s laying her down, “M, br’ke pr’mise to Pep.”
He can feel her eyes on him as they’re brainstorming and, with the anger still fuelling him he asks her, spite clearly evident in his tone, “Can I help you?”
Then the light that’s the arc reactor flickers back into existence and is followed by Stark’s gasp of breath and his eyes, auburn and gold and everything in between, snap open and suddenly there’s life in the empty street paved with destruction and everything seems right in his world for a moment as Tony Stark, with the suit that’s coloured red and gold like a phoenix, and an arc reactor that shouts
, with its bursts of sarcasm and attempt at crass humour and its ease in calling out Steve’s bullshit.
Steve Rogers has decades worth of grief etched into his still-thawing heart and loss tattooed on his forehead and perhaps that is why, when Tony Stark’s Iron Man descends with chaos outside a museum in Germany, all too flashy colors, and too loud machinery, and emotionless faceplate and weapons and destruction, it reminds him of everything wrong with this century.
He stops in his pursuit for the kitchen when he hears the undeniable sound of metal on metal and it should be concerning, his blatant unconcern at the suspicious sound coming from the kitchen at three in the morning but Tony’s tech is secure enough to keep out SHIELD despite the constant efforts to get in; he doubts anyone could get in without Tony knowing.
She looks at him hopefully and she looks so young, and so lost it tugs at his heart painfully, “Yeah?”
Three-year-old Toni eyed the black ink spanning across her mother’s pale wrist, spelling out the words
She still wakes up choking on water, wakes up with blood on her chest, wakes up with Yinsen’s last words on her breath and Pepper’s dead body on her mind. At night, she’s still trapped in the cave, still hooked onto a battery, still dying from palladium, still dying at the hands of her father.
And she closes her eyes and sleeps with no nightmares, with no red on her wrist and hole in her heart. She closes her eyes and sleeps with the promise of tomorrow, the promise of love, the promise of the kind of happy she’s destined to feel with Steve Rogers.
Tipsy enough to imagine that the universe might think she was enough, perfect even, for a man like Captain America.
She’s out like a light shortly after and he’s sitting in his room, flipping through the sketchbook he was given, noting with a newfound realization that somewhere along the line his drawings stopped varying and started becoming all Toni.
The screams and shouts and absolute chaos is simply white noise, and she can feel herself starting to drift away slowly, welcoming pain; her dear old friend.
Maria Stark, whose greatest weakness might have been the undying hope she held safe in her heart and the kindness she breathed through her lungs, held onto her daughter’s wrist, thumbing the red letter gently, “Your soulmate, Toni, hasn’t been born yet, that’s all.”
She thinks that Steve Rogers deserves better than to wake up in cold sweat and have sleep taken away from him. She thinks he deserves to rest peacefully and be immune to nightmares but she doesn’t get to call the shots.
The room is thrust into a silence she cannot discern and she wants the ground to open up and swallow her whole when Steve Rogers just looks at her unblinking and then at her wrist, obscured by the hospital band and then back at her and she wonders if she could blame the morphine.
Her lashes nearly brush her cheekbone, curling up at the ends and her lips constrict into a small pout. Her arms and legs are flailed in different directions and her hair is tousled and wild, much like the woman herself. He’s managed to capture Toni’s state of absolute peace as she sleeps, the glow of the reactor giving her a more ethereal look. He realizes that there’s a constant weight hanging over her shoulders that ceases to exist when she’s deep in her subconscious.
He looks away from their reflections on the glass doors of the elevator to Tony, whose eyes are a little wider, stance a little looser, mask a little more cracked and waits for something, anything. When nothing comes, Steve just turns back to face their reflections on the glass doors of the elevator, acutely aware of Tony’s hands unsteadily flailing around in small motions, incapable of staying still. The thought brings about a small tug in the back of his sternum he’d like to call affection.
He doesn’t realize that his wrist is burning until Natasha closes the portal and the aliens are gone and so is Toni.
“Some days I dream about Obie trying to rip the reactor off, some days it’s the hole in space. Sometimes it's my dad.”
But then she takes off the suit that she hasn’t taken off since she went to work and lets her hair out of its bun and washes off the makeup and removes the silver bracelet that Jarvis had made for her, the words
He has no rage in him to punch the sandbag, no anger that will result in a maniac trance of punch and hit and destroy and he finds himself leaving the gym and getting back into the elevator, calling the name without hesitance this time, “Jarvis.”
Pepper and Rhodey just nod uncertainly, and she’s expected the concerned looks from them, expected the slight sympathy and the not so slight protectiveness.
The mission was relatively simple; someone had managed to steal SHIELD’s most classified weapons and the Avengers were called in to neutralize the threat and retrieve the weapons.
Moments later, Rhodes dragged in a protesting Tony Stark before watching him eat the Panini Clint had made an hour prior, before accompanying Tony back to his workshop.
2011; She signs the last of the documents that would officially make Pepper Co-CEO and retires home, ready to change out of her dress and into a robe to get the sleep that she so desperately needs after two days. She pulls out her earrings and unpins her hair, wiping off the red on her lips and taking off the bracelet on her wrist and freezing.
Tony’s waiting for him on the other side of the elevator doors, dressed to the nines in a suit that possibly cost more than an average paycheck, sunglasses perched on top carefully styled hair and nimble hands dancing over the thin phone screen.
He supposes Jarvis’ answer was intentionally supposed to reveal the buyer of his gift as there is only one person who authorizes what Jarvis tells them and doesn’t.
Meals are usually eaten at everyone’s own time and preference but one day of Colonel Rhodes walking into the tower while the rest of them sans Clint and Thor are lounging in the communal living room changes things.
Perhaps she should have accounted better for the weakness that was her heart. Perhaps love is this burning feeling that settles into her every vein and induces screams she cannot scream, breaths she cannot breathe.
Until one, masochistically suicidal in his opinion, reporter, shoves through the crowd and shoves a microphone in Toni’s face, now devoid of a faceplate.
She looks at him from beneath her lashes and he tries not to notice her flushed cheeks or her lips that’s right there because
1987; She builds her first circuit board at the age of four. It's intricate and she had spent hours and hours of careful construction. She shows her father and he smiles at her for the first time.
“Whatever you say, Cap,” Natasha’s voice has a hint of something knowing and sly to it and if he didn't know better, he’d think that she expected this all along.
The voice jars him like no other, and the instinct that’s been nurtured into him ever since Wars and Erskine and Hydra that screams
The corners of Tony’s eyes crinkle and Steve’s half tempted to run to his room and grab his sketchbook and pencil so he won’t forget the contours of Tony’s face when he’s nostalgically happy, “Ya, I guess I would. And then I’d have to go to SI every day to see him and Pepper will have a heart attack.”
The questions are inconsiderate and rude but Steve supposes Toni’s used to it, he’s seen worse things written about her in articles that the genius brushes away without a mere thought and so Steve just follows her lead like the rest of them and stares straight ahead, drowning out the many questions.
He turns his wrist and feels his heart stop pounding as the red is no longer red but black and, in similar writing, there is an
So she chews on her waffle, and keeps her hands tucked firmly under her leg, “Turned black about a year ago, got an extra letter as well, a t beside the S. The good Captain came out of the ice twenty-four hours before that.”
Against better reason, he blurts out the first thought that comes to mind before Tony can spin on his heels and fly away, or take out the phone from his pocket and leave this orbital, “Gym. Is there a gym?”
She supposes that if she were to tell anyone first; if anyone were to figure it out, she’d prefer it to be Pepper and Rhodey, the two people that mean the world to her.
The AI’s response is immediate and not at all what Steve expected, “Of course Sir, I shall relay to Ms. Potts that you are experiencing a delay due to Captain Rogers needing your assistance and that you offer your sincere apologies for your unpunctuality.”
The reactor isn’t shining, and she isn’t breathing and her eyes are closed and for some reason, Steve’s heart is in his throat and his lungs burn until the Hulk roars and he sees the amber flecks that burst in her eyes and then Natasha and Clint are helping Toni to the tower where the SHIELD agents take over the remaining parts of the crisis.
Movie nights become a regular thing with Clint and Coulson stuck together on the loveseat, Thor and Bruce comfortably sitting next to each other on the two cushioned sofa on the opposite side and Tony, Steve and Natasha occupying the large couch in the middle.
Later, after she’s slowly explained the science behind his shield and the magnets, he goes to his room, opens the sketchbook and starts drawing.
“Intervention,” Natasha walks in while Bruce is putting finishing touches on his curry and holds three straws to Steve, Clint and Thor.
He doesn’t get to check the reason for the burn because Toni’s falling and she isn’t stopping. He has a moment of panic because he doesn’t know how to save her but he doesn’t need to because the Hulk does and Steve rips off her faceplate.
Being Captain America makes him forget about the red on his wrist and the hole in his heart. He becomes a comedic act and allows himself to be prodded and poked by several scientists trying to replicate the serum that apparently died with the only man that believed in him.
He’s got his hands wrapped around the sniper’s neck. His hand is stained with his soulmate’s blood, his soulmate that’s breathing through a tube and he squeezes harder, watching the man turn purple and his eyes roll back slightly.
Tony grabs something from a drawer and places it on top of the bot’s claw, arranging it so that Steve can see the words hastily written on the plastic cone, “Cleaning Duty.”
And perhaps it's because the engineer has been on his mind ever since he woke up, perhaps it's because the engineer has been on his mind quite a lot nowadays but it takes Steve a moment to gather that Tony Stark sitting on the floor of the communal kitchen – pieces of what used to be the microwave and toaster surrounding him on the floor, scattered in a disorganized mess that makes sense to no one but the genius – is not his imagination.
The Avengers live in her tower and she makes sure to avoid the communal area where she knows they all prefer to stay and although she avoids them, she makes sure to keep the fridge restocked with Clint’s favourite yogurt and buy twice the amount of Poptarts and purchase more couches and chairs.
After more shifting around uncomfortably in his spot, while Tony simply looks at his phone then at Steve before awkwardly switching back to his phone, Steve clears his throat and hopes that he doesn’t sound as nervous as he feels, “Is there a place where I can put my bags?”
The third time, she’s awake and the pain meds are reduced to the bare minimum and Steve Rogers is yelling at her about recklessness and how she nearly died and her stupidity and
She walks in with another kind of armour; high heels and sunglasses and painted lips, and seats herself on the chairs, both feet on the ground and mouth going a mile a minute talking to Bruce who has somehow returned to his former self. Fury tells them that Stark has provided them with her tower where they, all the Avengers would stay in order to be a team; a real one.
She doesn’t realize that the far right corner of her workshop now belongs to Steve until weeks later.
So she spends her days tinkering in the lab. She goes to fight clubs with Clint and Natasha, blows things up with Bruce, explains television to Thor and hides in her own tower from Captain America.
“I built him when I was sixteen.” Tony’s voice cuts through the silence moments before they’re scheduled to get off the elevator and Steve stares at the man for clarification.
It's only when he’s punching through the fourth sandbag that he sees it and stops, causing the bag to swing to his face violently and he knows if it weren’t for the serum, he’d be sprouting a purple eye.
Steve Rogers falls in love with Tony Stark one creation at a time; falls in love with the kindness, compassion, and absolute generosity that shines through the pieces of metal, the lines of code, the shards of glass.
He places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, soft and gentle because the man deserves nothing less and ignores the tingling that’s slowly working its way to his spine, tugging Tony until he’s on his feet and barely a breath away.
Tonight is harder than most. Steve wakes up in cold sweat and a scream clogging his throat and a mental image of Bucky Barnes falling off the train and then Bucky Barnes turning into Tony Stark flying a missile into a wormhole – this time, however – he doesn’t make it back down.
Still, he gets under the covers and stares at the dark ceiling as he does until boredom becomes too much for him and he’ll walk around this massive building for hours until he tires and falls asleep on the couch and wakes up an hour later.
This time, Toni Stark walks down the steps, her flowing green gown circling her as she studs in her silver earrings. Her lip is painted red and her hair is curled and flows gracefully down her back and his blood rushes south when he catches sight of the two slits in her dress that travels all the way up to her thighs.
The reporters started to swarm once the crisis was resolved and because of the very little damage, they managed to effectively block the pathway between them and the Helicarrier.
She grabs the heels that she dropped on the ground and calls out to Steve as she half-jogs to the elevators, “Great, the doors are unlocked for you, make yourself at home, I’ll just change out of this and meet you there.”
He’s awoken at two in the morning, not by images of Bucky falling off a train or of Toni never coming back from the wormhole (a recent addition to his nightmares) but because of Jarvis, “Captain, Ms. Stark called for you down in the workshop.”
The arc reactor that’s flickering dangerously as the nurses and doctors rush in an out of the room where Toni Stark lays motionless and still as if the universe thinks that it can stop the girl with motion in her veins and movement in her lungs.
She feels the corner of her lips tip up when she’s clearly caught him off guard but then, after rubbing the name –
And he notes, with mind-numbing panic, that Tony must have seen the other pages – the ones that make up the rest of the book – of Steve’s drawings of Tony; Tony in the morning, Tony during movie nights, Tony in his three-piece suit or in ratty sweatpants. There is love in every line and curve, love that a blind man can't miss and Steve braces himself for the imminent rejection, the pain of losing the one person that means almost everything.
But then Stark grins a grin that is a small upturn of one corner of his lips and only visible because Steve looks for it and says, “Ya. Sure. Gyms there. I'm housing a bunch of beefed-up Neanderthals, of course, I would put in a gym. Gyms on the forty-ninth floor. We can go there right now. Coulson mentioned your tendency of breaking punching bags so I designed some of my own,” Steve feels a blush travel up his spine and, judging by the way the smirk on his face widens, it doesn’t get past Tony, “Let’s go test out which is stronger, my brain or your brawn.”
“Steve, this-” Tony starts and his voice, soft and slow, jolts something in Steve that he’s decided was better off unbothered and the words tumble out of their own accord after careful precaution to keep them locked in.
He smiles at her in thanks and she pretends the butterflies creating havoc in her stomach doesn’t exist.
Tony gestures away the holograms on top of the table with an articulated movement of his hand and focuses the attention that was previously on the robot at Steve. The smudge of engine oil on his cheeks and the grease staining his arms are still there and Steve supposes that this is part of what makes up Tony Stark; the man behind the crass humour and expensive glasses and tailored suits with a paparazzi smile.
The Russian’s lethal is out like a coat and he lets his anger, the anger that he’s taken great precautions to reel in, do the same. He follows her through corridors and around corners, despite an aching, screaming part of him yelling to turn around and go back to Toni.
She chases the taste of his lips, eyes still closed and she feels her heart stop when they brush her forehead, tender and sweet and something no one but Ana Jarvis and Pepper Potts has ever done.
He knows, as he makes his way down to the thirty-fifth floor, that he has been the only one that has yet to be invited to the lab. Natasha and Bruce have been in there several times and Clint had gone twice to test out the modifications to his new arrows. Even Thor had found himself in the room once, appeasing Toni’s childish curiosity and blowing things up with his lightning.
Thor’s response is jovial and Steve relaxes as Natasha pulls up the feed from Jarvis, well aware of Thor’s idea of ‘good’ “We are all well Captain. I must say that this was a battle well fought.”
Tony’s lips are warm and soft but demanding and bold and Steve’s brain short-circuits for a split second because
So, in a decision that she hopes Edwin Jarvis would be proud of, she hops onto the counter and ices her wounds, asking Natasha, “Any ideas for guns after Leoglas’ arrows are done?”
Steve looks up from where he was pointedly staring at the tips of Stark’s shoes to the man looking at him with a closed-off posture and a slightly uncertain expression.
“They don't Sir,” Jarvis’ voice infiltrates the large gym they just walked into, and Steve lets go of the notion that the AI only spoke when spoke to, “According to conversations had subsequent to investment meetings, they are very much under the impression that you are entertaining yourself with pornography.”
Rhodes had sighed like an impervious parent, asking Jarvis while making his way to the elevator, as if expecting the answer, “How long since he ate?”
He meets the man behind the mask and is disappointed at how far he falls – incomparable to the pure energy that was Howard Stark, the goodness that was Peggy Carter, the selflessness that was Bucky Barnes. Tony Stark is crass humour and snarky nonchalance and scratching at wounds without any regard for feelings and impulsive brashness that could cost many lives.
The redhead recovers relatively quickly, quicker than Rhodey and stammers slightly before composing herself, “Are you sure?”
He’s out the second his head hits the pillow and he only gets an hour but he counts his wins and tallies up his losses and counts last night as a success.
“Put your shield on the table.” She props herself up on the stool and drags the shield towards herself, flipping it over and picking up some kind of machine the Steve doesn’t understand the purpose of.
“Ms. Stark, I would recommend some sleep as you’ve been awake for thirty-two hours straight. Preferably in your own bed instead of the workshop cot this time.”
She shrugs noncommittally and he drapes the blanket over her, looking down at DUM-E who rolls towards its owner before looking back at Toni’s tear-filled eyes.
made of nothing but algorithms that is somehow capable of sarcasm, capable of kindness and humour and caring and his fists start to loosen.
He doesn’t have time to contemplate the oddity of the situation in the kitchen because his ears are filled with the sounds of several instruments at once and, after Jarvis opens the doors for him, he’s thrust into the chaos and absolute beauty that is Tony Stark’s lab – Tony Stark’s
She doesn’t know where it pierces, only that her entire body feels as if it burst into flames and she chokes on a sob as white dances through her vision and she can feel just how heavy the arc reactor is.
She begins joining group training sessions and coming up for dinner. She begins to help Clint booby trap the hallways and laughs with Thor when they see the video of the Captain punching a wall after the ceiling burst with confetti. She suggests watching movies every week to catch Steve up and to introduce Thor to earth.
He only returns to his room after the sun goes down and he’s signed forms, trained with Natasha, attended three debriefs. He opens the door with the kind of resolve that crumples as soon as he steps foot into the plain area because he knows sleep is a losing battle.
“You’d miss him though,” Steve notes softly, and with an undercurrent of certainty in his words that are based on a one-minute observation.
“I can’t” The words are a harsh whisper in the quiet of the night with only the moon as a witness and Steve is too pained at Tony’s admission to bother feeling surprised at his sudden urge to kiss the pain away.
She knows he can feel her smile on his skin and she tips her head and waits until his lips descend down on her, as she finds his wrist and circles it with her fingers, whispering I love yous through the kiss.
“Tony created you.” It's more a statement than a question, but Steve figures that Tony Stark would have created an AI with the capabilities of reading between the lines and Jarvis doesn’t disappoint.
He’s met with silence but he keeps going, “Sometimes I see you,” The sharp gasp that comes from his right is only audible because of the serum, “Sometimes I see you flying into space and never coming down. Sometimes I see Tasha or Clint with holes in their head and sometimes I’m back in the ice and everyone’s calling out my name but I can’t answer because I can’t breathe. And it’s too quiet and too dark and I can’t sleep.”
She cries when Yinsen dies. Cries when she pulls his sleeve and sees his soulmate’s name, full name, written in red cursive letters. She promises him not to waste her life and she kisses his forehead and whispers thank you during his last moments. She holds his hand until the last breath leaves his lips and his heart beats its last beat.
And the pounding in his head and the ringing in his ears don't go away until he hears the cough of a man that means way too much in this life and a hoarse but present, “I'm okay, I'm okay. Ease up on the cavalry, I’m all good.”
The cameras show up twenty minutes later and little Antoinette basks in the affection her father is giving her; ruffling her shoulder-length hair, praising her genius, calling her his daughter.
Romanoff rubs her wrist worryingly, the wrist that he knows, because it was in one of the many files he was given to read, spells the name Clinton in messy scrawls; the same Clinton that is being mind-controlled by the God of Mischief they have locked in a cage meant for the Hulk.
He’s seen the Iron Man suit and the Stark tower and a whole lot of Tony’s genius inventions including Jarvis, but this – Dum-e – this is a tangible item that is comparable to a child, more so when Tony ignores his hologram and addresses the bot.
“In Asgard, we have two soulmates. One is the one you fall in love with and one is the one that breaks your heart.”
Jarvis gathers her out of the room, holds her when she cries and then sneaks her a cookie before bed.
His mouth moves but makes no sound and this would have been the part where she laughs, except she cannot because she just told him that he was her soulmate and he’s not saying anything back and
She huffs under her breath and makes her way upstairs, sucking gently on the moderate-sized burn wound and pausing in the kitchen where everyone is seated and staring at her.
As long as he has Tony Stark, with eyes as bright as life and hands as miraculous as creation, Steve Rogers knows that everything will be alright in this world.
Tony stops in his quiet murmurings of the gym equipment that Steve secretly itches to use and gasps in a theatrical mock outrage, “And you never told me, J?”
“Steve. Steve. Captain!” Natasha harshly yells into his ear and he drops the scum carelessly, allowing himself to be ushered out of the room, only faintly hearing Barton tell the man who is the reason Toni is lying on a hospital bed, motionless and still, “So, do you want to confess or shall I call back the good Captain again?”
He brushes back the strands of hair that obscure her face, falling for her a little more when she burrows herself into his hand, “Yeah.”
“Hey,” He rubs the back of his neck, presumably at the embarrassment of getting caught and she wonders how often the man comes down at odd times of the day and how she hadn’t noticed, “Your back.”
Her voice is loud and boisterous, creating a ruckus before she even enters the room with the God of Thunder that had stepped outside for some air.
, he thinks, and is momentarily confused because this suit is everything that the one in Germany wasn’t. The red and gold is no longer flashy and bright but rather scratched and marked and dirtied and the loud whirring that induced annoyance has disappeared and left behind silence. The faceplate is thrown away somewhere and exposes Tony Stark’s bleeding bruised face; eyes closed and mouth shut and they’ve won, but the world seems
Natasha, sensing the tension there, gets up and tugs on the woman’s chair, eliciting a whine from the engineer, “Hey, Tasha.”
1935; Steve Rogers signed up as a test subject for Project Rebirth, and walked out of a medical capsule a different man. Everything, from his stamina, senses, looks and height had changed.
She admits that Afghanistan was a poorly calculated error on her part. She admits that she should have stayed in the van, but then decides that nothing would have changed anyway.
She finds the ice and smiles at Banner who provides her with a plastic bag. She takes it graciously and is prepared to leave when she remembers pot pie and waking up after sending a nuke to space and being surrounded by people who looked like they care.
He opens the door and she’s momentarily distracted by the lack of shirt and the onslaught of muscle and skin and warmth and tousled hair before she meets blue eyes that she remembers were the last thing she saw before she let the pain take her and she focuses.
There’s the now-familiar clicking of heels on the tiles and Clint’s accompanying whistle and he, along with everyone else, turns around.
Instead, he tugs on his arm and propels him forward, making a silent ascend into Tony’s floor and carefully maneuvering the engineer into his room and onto his bed. He lies there, stiff and tense and Steve knows that as soon as he’s gone, Tony will make his way into the workshop where he will play loud music and fix up a car until he needs to go to work tomorrow morning.
It’s only when one of the many reporters inquires about the red mark visible on her wrist that Toni has her first experience with the cruelty of the world, the brutality of the people in it.
Stark stares at him intently and the way brown eyes bore at him as if they can see right through him makes Steve wonder if this whole thing was a bad idea, if he should have just stayed in SHIELD.
“Hey guys,” Clint calls over comms, “SHIELD found the lunatic that made these things. We wanna handle it?”
1998; She meets Rhodey at MIT. He’s the only person who doesn’t underestimate her ability because she’s years younger and a woman. He’s the only one who doesn’t care that she’s Howard Stark’s daughter or that she has a thick band around her wrist that’s supposed to display her soulmate’s name.
Stark caught his expression and grinned, even though Steve couldn't help but notice how his every emotion seemed to be tinged with exhaustion.  "Yeah, west," he repeated.  "We're in Mulgrave, on the eastern end of Nova Scotia."
“What are you going to do?” his father snarls, gripping him so hard it hurts.  “Are you going to go back to him?  He’s nothing!  He’s a stain, a smear, worth less than grime underneath your nails—”
Steve didn't know what the writer meant about this being a dream, because Steve was quite real, thank you very much, but he kept reading.  It went into more detail about what had happened -
Tony pulled something from his pack, handing it to them.  "It's a slim chance, but if you can find the cabin that Steve and I stayed in, it might work for you three.  It's marked on the map here."
And no matter what Tony tells himself, that’s exactly what he wants.  He wants to find his missing soulmate and just spend the rest of his life with them after hanging up the armor.  He wants an amazing pal like Rhodey or Steve, but minus the part where Rhodey’s off doing military things all the time and Steve is dating other women and plus additional romance and sex.
"Huh," Tony replied, a little absentmindedly.  Okay, he might have taken a second to peek into the bag to admire the shield, and maybe, just maybe, there was a slight possibility that that second might have been a lot more than a second.  "Sorry."
The airship glided lower.  Tony pulled the lever and poked his head outside, letting out a sigh of relief when he saw Cap not too far from him.  "Hey!" he called.  "Free ride.  You interested?"
ride like the wind.”  God, it was a good thing he had plenty of aspirin, because he didn’t want to think of how much this would hurt if he hadn’t been drugged.  Gingerly leaning forward, he awkwardly clutched at fistfuls of Rogers’ fur, which was coarse and bristly in his hands.  “Okay.  Giddyup, boy.”
Tony rubbed his forehead.  "I don't know," he eventually answered.  "It might have been bad luck, but there's no reason Japanese planes would be flying over that area normally.  So maybe it was him.  And if it was—then that means this guy has known where we were, fast enough to either meet us there or get there in advance.  I'm getting the feeling that hoping that he
And then that was it.  One of the most brilliant, witty, caring men the world had ever known, and it was almost like he had never existed.
Steve just smiles, then turns and leaves.  It isn’t until he’s gone that Tony realizes that the other man slipped him a folded piece of paper, though he doesn’t want to chance looking at it now, not when both Howard and Sunset are glaring daggers at him.  But so long as there are other people around, Howard dares not raise his voice, so sitting with them is at least tolerable.  Finally, though, at some point they’re all immersed in their food, and Tony unfolds the note, reading it.
"On it."  Cap vanished, presumably heading off to the room where suit was currently hooked up, charging.  His heart could power it, but it certainly didn't hurt for it to have its own power as well, especially for what he was planning.
Steve tried not to wince.  Oh right, there had been a reason they'd gotten onto this tangent in the first place.  And honestly, she was right - he didn't remember. He had no idea what Ma was talking about.  But could he actually
Stark stepped forward and offered his bag to her.  "So take this and spare yourself the trip," he said.  Steve blinked, and for a second he could see the old Tony shining through, the one Steve had fallen for in the first place all those years ago.  Stark glanced at him, his face unreadable before he broke into a wide smile.  "What?" he said.  "I can't resist a pretty face.  I'm talking about Danielle, obviously."
"I've felt better," Tony said, because that was certainly true.  He thought about it.  "But I've also felt worse."
For a moment, Tony just stood there, completely frozen.  What the hell had just happened?  Steve had been here one second, and then in the next he’d just… run off.  Why?  Because Tony hadn’t agreed to
And besides, even if Steve is, what does it matter?  He thinks of Happy and Pepper, Hank and Jan, Firestar and Justice.  Happy and Jan are dead.  Firestar and Justice have broken up.  Their fated words were no guarantee of happiness.
Ignoring the burning in his side as best as he could, he forced himself back up onto his feet, groaning with the additional ache that had come from kneeling in the suit.  Then he brought his arms up over himself, protecting the more vulnerable parts of his armor from a fresh wave of gunfire. And then, once that was done, he charged forward, screaming with pain and rage and desperation as he fired his own weapons.  Left, right, forward, left again - one by one by one he took every single target out until there was nothing left but flames.
“Oh.”  Well, it’d be awkward if Steve hugged him again, so he just holds still, face red.  “Anyway.  I think you deserve better than what they’re giving you.”
At this, Tony lets out a wanton moan, thrusting into him, and for a moment, Steve can’t help but palm his erection, feeling it press into his hand.  Tony wants this badly.
"Like what?" Steve asked, not sure if it would be anything he could bear to hear.  Tony, to his surprise, motioned for him to turn around, so he did, unable to deny him anything.
are the long-lost Captain America, and your friend is—was—CEO of Stark Enterprises, and the hero known as Iron Man."  She gave Tony a searching look.  "Given your lack of metal suit, though, maybe you are not Iron Man anymore, either."
It was up to Steve, now, to make sure his legacy remained.  Up to Steve to ensure that his contributions weren't lost.  Steve was alive where so many other people weren't, and it was because of Tony.  He couldn't let it be in vain.
Tony focused his eyes enough to see the shield propping the sabretooth’s mouth open partway, Rogers doing his best to keep it there as the beast thrashed and roared.  Somehow, even with it writhing on top of him, Tony recognized a need for more power, and so he grappled quickly for the cables located in each gauntlet, opening his shirt and plugging them into his chest plate.  From there, he managed to hold his arms up steady, shooting twin beams straight into its mouth with everything he had, lighting up the entire area as he did.
They have their highs and their lows, but when they find Captain America frozen in a block of ice in the Atlantic Ocean, Tony knows right then and there that this is, and will always be, the greatest day of his life.
"Steve, I'm fine as long as I don't take the reactor out for an extended period of time," Tony said placatingly.  "And if you'll remember, you haven't seen me take it out a single time."  Steve searched his memory, realized that Tony was right, and relaxed a little as Tony continued, "So don't bother your pretty head over it.  It's just something I think about sometimes, that's all."
Steve stared at the fabric.  He knew what was under there, but he couldn't believe it.  "No," he said.  "That—it's a cut.  Right?  I can stitch it.  Let me stitch it."
Before he could think twice about it, he ripped the drawing in two, then four, then threw the pieces away from him as hard as he could.  But air resistance kept them from going very far, and instead they fluttered quietly to the ground, landing near his feet. Gentle. Soft.  Just like Mom. Just like Steve.
Rhodey raised an eyebrow at him, clearly unimpressed by his lack of response.  "Do you want me to go get him?"
"Yeah," Tony panted, letting his body relax.  God, that had stung.  But he'd felt worse, and this was pretty small potatoes in comparison.  Talking to Cap made it more bearable, at least.  "You didn't answer my question."
There was a long pause.  Tony looked over the edge of the roof one more time, then got up and made his way to the center before sitting back down, Steve silently following after him.
The ship was darker than he would have thought, thick plumes of smoke obscuring the flames, which, from what he could tell, were mostly concentrated near the front.  He avoided that area for now, keeping as low to the ground as he could, eyes peeled for any sign of Jarvis.  This had all been a trap, he thought dimly as he picked his way past overturned furniture.  The Nazis had known they were looking for the ring pieces and they had known that if they came here, Tony and the others would have followed.  He wondered if the last piece had ever even been in this place.  He wondered if it mattered.
He was wrapping Steve's leg with the gauze when the door opened again, and the woman walked in carrying a tray with two glasses of what looked like hot water and some cans of bologna and peaches that she'd already opened for them.  "I see you are getting settled," she said.  "I brought food."
of him, for God's sakes.  Adaptations had been made of his heroics during the war.  He headlined a comic book.
Together, they lift their heads and look.  The ship is pointed upward now, floating for the time being, but it’ll probably start sinking any second now—Tony groans and squeezes his eyes shut, burrowing against Steve.  He can’t watch this.  It’s already bad enough hearing the screaming of everyone around him, and he doesn’t even want to think about how much worse it’ll get when those still on the ship hit the water as well.  “It’s so c-c-cold,” he says.
"Do you see that?" Cap asked, standing close to the window and peering outside.  "There's a plume of smoke that seems to be coming a few miles off the shore."
At this, Tony hesitated, debating whether he’d rather lose his dignity or continue to lay down next to a dead animal, then decided to hell with his dignity and nodded.  In response, Rogers slid his hands underneath Tony’s body, hoisting him upward and carrying him back to their igloo.  He laid him down afterward, movements surprisingly gentle as he shone the flashlight over his chest.  “This looks bad,” he murmured softly.  He set the flashlight down, then rummaged in his pack, bringing out something Tony recognized as the first-aid kit.
Tony let out another humorless laugh.  "No.  No, it wasn't.  How he got bit doesn't actually matter, because that wasn't the worst part.  If you have to know, he was trying to help someone who was already beyond help.  In any case, we even watched him die and turn because he didn't want us becoming killers for his sake—even though he'd known that between me and Rhodey we'd killed hundreds of biters already.  And that—that wasn't the worst part, either.  After he turned, we did kill him.  And we buried him because he was our friend.  And that still wasn't the worst part."
Carefully, Tony replaced the papers where he'd found them, then put the uniform back into the closet.  Then he made himself finish his soup - not because he was hungry, especially after a revelation like
something, but he’s not sure what.  Their faces are so close, Steve can make out all the different shades of blue in Tony’s eyes, even if the only lighting is coming from a dim lamp from a few feet away.  He really is beautiful.  Beautiful and smart and clever and funny, and yet, even with all those qualities, he’s still—he’s still hurting, and all Steve wants to do is hold him close and soothe that hurt away.  “You deserve better than what you have,” he finds himself whispering.
His hands went still, his gaze blank as he stared into the mirror without really seeing himself.  They had, hadn't they, he thought dully. And it… it made sense. Ty and Tony were friends. Attractive friends.  And, apparently, friends that were maybe attracted to each other. Steve had seen some of the media from this time.  That sort of thing wasn't encouraged, exactly, but it wasn't forbidden the way it was in his own time.
," Tony replied.  "It's dangerous to expect too much.  But… I don't know."  He offered Steve a smile.  "I found you.  Other things don't seem as hard anymore."
But then he remembered his own voice telling him how strong he was, how he knew Tony would always pull through.  And even if Steve was gone, he still mattered, and Tony needed to make his faith worth it.
"Only one way to find out, right?" Tony asked.  Before anyone could raise an objection, he stepped forward, planting himself firmly on the tile.
," Steve repeated, mildly horrified.  A third job just so he could see the doctor?  She was already exhausting herself with two. "He didn't hit my head.  I mean, besides the eye. Don't get another job." Ma let out a soft huff, clearly displeased, so Steve continued, "Don't do it, Ma.  If you do, I'll never see you because you'll be working all the time."
Tony's mouth just about fell open at that, and for a moment, he could do nothing but stare blankly at the other man.  "Your idea," he repeated at last.  Captain America… had known about this mission and actively wanted to participate?
They were, to be honest, all descriptions Tony didn’t give a shit about.  War hero?  Please.  Maybe it’d be impressive if Tony weren’t a war hero too, but he
—is pushing him forward, urging him toward the lifeboat.  “Get on the boat, Tony,” he hears Howard say.
“I bet,” Tony murmured.  It hurt too much to tilt his head up to watch Rogers, so he just gave up, relaxing back against the ground and trusting the other man to tend to him.  After all, it wasn’t like he had a choice, and if he was really being honest with himself, well.  It—it was kind of nice, having someone tending to him who didn’t seem to be bothered by his metal chest plate, unlike everybody else.  For once, he didn’t have to hide what was, in the end, a major part of him.  “Well, I’m grateful.  Thanks.”
Tony blinked the sleep away from his eyes and nodded to himself.  It was a Steve day today. That was fine - Tony had had some plans for the next time he was Steve, and now it looked like he'd have his chance to implement them.
"Sure," Tony said, so flippantly Steve was positive Tony was just joshing him.  "I love myself.  That extends to loving the way my heart sounds.  Why wouldn't I try to hear it whenever possible?"
He’d finally found the soulmate he’d convinced himself was just a myth for so many years, and he might as well have been the one to pull the trigger on him.
"I don't want to get you sick, Stevie," she said, punctuating it with a weak cough.  "You stay on the other side. There should still be some bread on the counter if you're hungry."
with you?" Ty demanded after practice, snatching the book out of Tony's hands and snapping it shut, turning it around to look at the cover.  "What the hell is this? More history garbage?"
He let it drop, though.  Now that his wounds had been cleaned and re-bandaged, he was hopeful that he could get something done instead of lying here uselessly.  "Hey," he tried.  "Could you pass me my notebook?"
"Jessica," supplied the woman, who shook their hands as well.  "And here's Danielle."  She tilted her arms, exposing a slumbering baby swaddled in blankets.  Steve was impressed that she had apparently slept through the whole exchange.  She glanced at Stark.  "And you are…?"
Cap still looked suspicious, but he went over to Tony's pack, digging out the notebook and bringing it over.  Tony accepted it with his good hand, glad that Cap hadn't thought to pull out the pen he'd stuck into the spiral of it.  "Thanks," he said.  He felt like he was thanking Cap a lot, but he did have a lot to thank Cap for.
Then Steve heard coughing.  He looked and saw that Tony had gone still, his eyes wide and his hand clamped to his mouth.  Even as Steve watched, he could see Tony's shoulders begin to tremble, and then he was coughing again, his throat sounding like it was in complete agony.  "Sorry," Tony gasped out in between coughs.
So he wades in deeper, heading into the adjacent room—he figures he should probably check the more flooded rooms first before he’s unable to go into them at all.  There’s another key cabinet in here, but all of them are once again brass, and a quick check of the drawers floating around the room proves to be fruitless as well.  Okay, he thinks.  So this room is a bust.  Maybe—maybe the next one.
Steve opened the door and was immediately beset by a biter, but he was able to flip it to the side before it could do anything.  The immediate vicinity was otherwise clear, and after making sure Stark was behind him, he started running down the hall, shield out to shove aside any further biters that were coming their way.  It wasn't long until they were standing in front of the cafeteria doors, but the biters visible through the glass panes made it plain that there was still a fight ahead of them.  "We're gonna need to clear a spot so Jessica can get down safely," Steve said.  "Maybe if I lure them out—"
Silence.  Tony slowly lowered the shield, looking over the rim.  Steve was seated in front of him, looking confused again.  When he caught sight of Tony, he quickly padded over to him, blue eyes questioning.  “Oh, thank God,” Tony breathed, setting the shield down and wincing when the pain in his arm flared up again.  “Jesus.  Steve, are you okay?”
While they were talking, Cap had silently moved further into the room, staring at the far end.  The distance was too great for Tony to make it out clearly, but he could see enough to tell that there was another skeleton there, this one on a raised surface.  Given its prominence, it was obvious that this was the person the tomb was built for.  "Not a guy," Tony said, blinking as the notes he'd read from Li Ji came together.  "A woman."
It starts getting worse after a year of his son's death, after Tony start the drinking, no one found him without an alcohol bottle in his hand, if he wasn't working himself to death in finding a way to open the company he deludes himself with, then he will drink himself to death, as much as his friends tried to talk him out of it, as much as they begged him to go to a therapist, as much as they begged him to stop drinking, Tony didn't listen.
"Steve!" Tony choked out as he tried to stop his laughter, for Steve started to tickle him and make noisy smacking kisses. "Stop it you heathen!" Tony squealed, trying to stop laughing before his sides hurt, trying to pout and fail because his heart was pounding in happiness when he heard his Alpha's happy chuckle.
"I am not dancing with a woman; I am dancing with Tony," Steve stated as he took his position once more, waiting for Bucky to get ready for another dance. Bucky pout at the words Steve spook, sending a glare to Peggy who was smiling smugly and recording the whole thing, the look on her face was that of a cat who was enjoying herself as she toyed with the canary in her grip.
"Tony Carbonell." Tony finally said with a sad smile, remembering his mother's sacrifice for him, his words made the man hum and waving Tony when he gave him the money, telling him to get moving already if he wanted to reach the town before dark, which made the teen give a small smile before rushing toward his car, shaking all the way when he rushed out of the gas station, feeling like someone was following him but there were no cars behind…
It had been six years since Tony brought the baby home with him; the boy was a lovely addition to the Addams family with his monstrous side and similar line of thinking to Tony. He was the perfect boy Tony and Steve could ever want or need; a baby that gained the love of all the Addams Family and the Avengers, especially Serpentine (When Serpentine approve of someone, then the whole family welcomes them… mainly because she was terrifying even more than Grandma Addams) who threaten everyone with pain and death if they hurt her grandbaby.
"It doesn't matter who I am, Mr. Stark wish for you to read this letter and come with me." The man said which made Steve frown and snatch the letter from the man's hand; his face became dark as he read the name Howard Stark and he growled at the Alpha thrusting the letter in his chest.
"Mr. Stane, so nice of you to join us… let the torture begin!" Steve chirped happily, not even giving Stane the benefit of a long villainous monologue that Steve seemed to prefer when dealing with unpleasant garbage; Steve just gave a sharp smile that has razor-sharp teeth in it (Since when did Steve have any fangs?) and raise what looked like a knife with rusted blood.
"I will, Papa, I promise!" Peter chirped happily, causing Tony to sniffle as he tried to stop the overflow of emotions taking over him at how grown up his baby was! Kids grow so fast! Tony still remembers how they found their son six years ago like it was yesterday, and today his baby was going to school!
"Can you come here please? I want to tell you something very important." Steven's eyes were soft as he gazed at the small boy, that was trying to make himself look smaller than he already was; it was a few seconds of the boy fidgeting before he walked slowly toward Steven's bed, standing near the Omega. "I want to say thank you, Petrus, for helping me when no one did." Steven said to the boy, causing him to flush even more and lower his head, not knowing what to say.

Tony fidget nervously as he waited for Steve outside of the Omega's house, heart pounding in his chest while his hands were sweating from being a nervous mess, today Steve finally decided to give him a chance to prove himself, he accepted going out with Tony on a date, just the two of them… now as much as Tony adore his son, his amazing, smart, and precious son, the Alpha still wanted to have a few dates with Steve with just the two of them, mainly because there are some things that are not to be told in front of their son, and another because Tony doesn't want his son to witness his humiliation if the Omega decided that Tony wasn't worth it and throw the pasta dish on top of his head.
daughter? Because the last time I checked, only Steven Goddammit Rogers has the same blue eyes as her!" Tony shouted, ignoring the looks that Peggy and Bucky were throwing at each other than at him.
Before Wanda succeed in perfecting her spell to make the Avengers relife their worst nightmares, Steve manage to snap from his shock, pulling a sliver of the Space Stone's power, mixing the power of the stone with his pure magic before attacking the witch, throwing her away from the Avengers making her slam hard and dent the wall behind her. Taking this as his chance Steve purged all of her tainted magic away from the communal floor, clearing the air around them and the Avengers' minds at the same before they fall prey to her magic.
As Tony's consciousness slowly begin to move back to reality, he seemed to finally register Steve trembling slightly. Without really thinking, he pulls the covers tightly around them. But Steve is not trembling out of cold, of course, but it was the only thing Tony probably can think of to do. He hummed at Steve, a soothing, primal rumble. His spine jerked occasionally as his knot swelled inside Steve, locking them together.
So Steve entered the room and closed the door behind him, after taking a big breath, taking the scent of engine oil, dust, metal, and something sweet… something that made his breath leave him, which made Steve turn around to take in the room, he had to thank the serum for his night vision, a thing that he never told anyone about in fear of him turning out to be a dancing monkey… again…
"Well, there was that one time, when she pushed Bucky toward me, he ended up tripping on top of me and believe it or not, kissed me even." Tony's choked at that into his tea, looking at Steve while mouthing the world 'Lying' with wide eyes. "No really, I still remember the shriek Bucky let after he flows away from me; he ended up enlisting in the army three days later." That got a laugh from Tony as he leaned on the back of the couch looking at the Alpha with sparkling eyes, giving a shy smile when the Alpha's eyes darken a little and an amused smile took over his face.
"Don't look at me like that Barnes! It was your boy who asked me out!" Tony's words made the room around him become so quiet, like every sound was sucked out of this universe, and it made the hair on Tony's body stand on end, especially when his teammates looked at him like they were getting ready to kill him and rip his body to pieces, later feeding it to the dogs… a look like that seeing it on Barnes and Natasha, even Clint's face was normal… but for Bruce and Thor to actually look at him like that? OK… Tony needed Jarvis to fire his suit; he was going to Malibu and fuck Fury and his 'The team needed to stay together' shit!
Steve felt the nervousness coming from the Omega and the Alpha, both of them avoiding looking in each other's eyes as they didn't know what to say, that made the smile on his face to slip a little and to think of something fast. "So Natasha, how is it going with you courting Clint?" Steve said which made Natasha looked at him fast with eyes widen in shock, the betrayal shining in her eyes as she heard Angie chocked out a 'What?' Peggy, on the other hand, realized what Steve was doing turned to Natasha who was avoiding Peggy and Angie, the news wasn't that shocking to Peggy as she felt like there was something going on between these two.
Reaching his room, Tony gazed at the mirror with shocked eyes, taking his body it, there was no blood, no wounds, no scraps that he got when Ty throw him on the ground, what greeted him was miles and miles of healthy glowing skin, no wound or even his old scars surrounding it, not even the dark bags under his eyes.
"You are so cruel; you practically made us wake up at 3 a.m. who in their right mind wake up at such a time! I know I should have never helped you with J, remind me again, why aren't we taking a plane home?" Rhodey whined as he starts shoving a forkful of eggs in his mouth which did nothing but makes Pepper roll her eyes and give a tired sigh grumbling about idiot boyfriends.
"Mama! Papa is mean! He won't let me play with Harley, please talk to him." Peter whined rushing toward Tony and hugging his waist tightly, sending the older Omega the most heart breaking look a ten years old can manage. Now if only Tony was immune to those eyes… unfortunately or fortunately, that look was not working today, not when Tony's heart was scrapped raw after the shock he endured when he saw Harley.
"Shush now, Buck, I told you my treat, do you really wanna say no and leave me alone? Do you have it in your heart to cause a pregnant Omega to cry?" Steve asked with wide eyes, causing the Alpha to snap his mouth shut, and to Steve amusement, Bucky was pouting, his pout lasted even when Steve was going through the clothes, he managed to get Bucky a lot of shirts he seemed to be comfortable with, a few pair of jeans, a few formal button-down shirts and a lot of underwear and shorts and few other things that he thought the Alpha will need, and that was only the first shop they went in, which made him thankful about the shop offering to deliver their purchases for them, it meant that Steve will have a lot of time taking Bucky to other shops.
"Yo, Rock of Ages, I want to know why are in my house? It is rude to show up without an appointment." Tony asked with narrowed eyes, already feeling too tired to snap and exchange harsh barbs with the newcomer, Tony just wanted to go and hide in his room, until it was time to go and see Steve's grave (Tony and the Avengers managed to host a respectable funeral for Steve, burying what Tony managed to gather from the stardust Steve left behind him) and cry until his heart stopped hurting.
"What?" Tony snapped after opening the line, hoping that the person at the end of the phone would be able to feel the anger that Tony was radiating off him… Tony could have been cuddling his amazing Omega now! Kissing him and kissing him until… Well, maybe Steve will even accept for Tony to bed him! But now he was forced to answer a call he doesn't even want to answer. Tony though, frowned when he realized that it was his aunt who was calling, and his face paled a little when he heard the situation they were in. "I will be there in 15 minutes top." Tony said shakily as he closed the phone, looking at Steve wanting to explain but the thing is he doesn't even know what to tell the Omega about his dilemma.
"I… I want to see them." Tony pleads with Steve, that made the Alpha pause and smile at the Omega, Steve stood up and went to the door, he opens it and look outside to see that everyone was waiting in the uncomfortable chairs they pulled out of somewhere.
“Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, it’s an engagement ring! Did that mean…?” Pepper couldn’t even finish her question, but the shy look on Tony’s face answered the question burning in her mind, causing her to squeal so loudly and bring him in a tight hug that nearly wrangled out every breath he had in his body.
Steve looked at the sobbing Omega with a lost expression, he doesn't know what to do when he came from the pup's room only to see the Omega start thrashing and crying out, and when the Omega starts screaming which attract the attention of everyone that was sleeping. Steve tried to calm the Omega gently, only for the Omega to start crying and begging to see his pup. Steve swallow at that and gaze at Howard who was looking as lost as Steve felt, but one look at Jarvis who stopped the doctors that rushed, made Steve nod in determination. "Shh, it's OK, Tony we are going to go and see the pup, just calm down." Steve crooned; making the Omega let a sob at that.
"Bye, Ma." Steve said his goodbyes just like the sunrise, making Steve glare at the sun, blaming it for cutting his session with his mother sooner than he wanted. Steve then stood up and head to the mansion. He had a lot of things to think over, and one of them was how to win Tony's heart without changing…
Only when Steve's eyes fell on Tony, did Steve's body finally relax from the tension that he didn't even know sized his muscle. His Alpha looked like hell, with dark bags under his eyes and pale face and shaky hands, even while sleeping, his Alpha's hand was holding his tightly, trying to stop his shaking and failing at that even when he was unconscious.
The creature though, paused when he saw the sleeping man curled up in the porch swing, which made the creature's breath clouding the air in short, shallow gasps, and the creature straightens up and changed his destination to the sleeping man. The creature looked a completely human with the narrow waist and broad chest, its arms taut and muscular the same could be said for the legs that were covered in dark pants, its hands and legs black with mud. But what set him apart was the flare of shadowy tentacles that appear and disappear every time the lights fell on them, they were thick and dark and sleek. They wind along the grass, as they helped the man stand up, tapping against the stones around the fire pit, and curling around the creature's legs.
Steven closed his eyes tightly pulling his son toward his body, hoping that the babe's scent will stop his shaking, and the tears that were trapped behind his eyelashes… what will happen now? Will the Iron King take this as a chance to make Steven do what he wants? Will he take his unborn babe as a hostage? Threatening Steven and his friends if the Omega didn't do what the man wants? And Steven wouldn't even be surprised if the king did that, after all, this was the way that kings this day work, and if the Iron King did that, then Steven wouldn't even be that stumped, after all, the Hydra King did use the same barging, he took so many innocent people, slaughtering and raping them in front of the Omega that was too dangerous to even stand near, hoping to weaken the Omega's will or at least soften him a little with fear… but the Omega always snarled at them and thrashed like a beast in the cell they have thrown him in, refusing to bow to anyone… until those wide teary eyes gazed at him, filled with so much hate and want for revenge, thirst for the blood of a king that took the only family the pup knew…
Unfortunately for him, his father came to visit him, he had called the ambulance and Tony ends up getting his stomach pumped, he could have gone without Howard screaming at him though.
"He was taken from us…" Howard said with hitch breath, it made Steve look at the picture one more time than handing it to Howard who took it and caresses the picture gently. "He is out there… somewhere… I just have to find him, Steve." Howard said with a cracked voice, making Steve put his hand on Howard's shoulder and squeeze gently.
"I am going to talk with the doctors for a bit, Becky; can you watch Steve for me until then?" Bucky asked Becky, which ended with the woman sniffing and giving a confirming answer; Steve's breath hitched at that, praying desperately for something to happen so the woman would leave him alone unsupervised. It seemed that whatever God out there did pity Steve, because not a few minutes later, the baby in Becky's arms started to cry, screaming and shrieking when Becky tried to calm her son. After several minutes of the boy not calming down, Becky left the room, probably trying to change the boy or feed him.
"You are going in the wrong way my queen; have the king not send someone to escort you?" The Alpha asked as he nodded to the Omega to follow him making the Omega pause a little at the man's words before he starts walking.
Grinning to himself, Steve put the letter back in the envelope, his heart pounding more wildly in his chest as he turned the key, making the engine give a loud purr as it came to life. Tony was nice enough to extend an olive branch in Steve's way, it was only the right that Steve do the same; this was Tony, after all, when the Alpha knows he did something wrong, he will desperately try to make it right.
But then somehow there’s a red and gold blur in the sky and Steve doesn’t even know why he’s surprised; this was the man that built some kind of revolutionary technology along with a prototype Iron Man suit in a cave with nearly nothing.
With the broken pieces of the circuit on the floor beside her bed and her slightly cracked heart, Antoinette pulls back the sleeves of her shirt and stares at the red ink for a long time.
Fury points to everyone at the table introducing them, “You know Natasha and Coulson, I see you’ve already met Thor, this is agent Hill, that’s Bruce Banner and that is Steve Rogers.”
The silence is mocking him, scratching at the wounds he’s opened and trying to draw blood so Steve rises from the bed and squints to find the little sliver of light under Tony’s door.
She turns her wrist and feels her heart stop pounding as the red is no longer red but black and, in similar, eloquent writing, there is a
The mark on her wrist is nothing but a fleeting thought. She’s got weapons to destroy and a company to run and things to make.
