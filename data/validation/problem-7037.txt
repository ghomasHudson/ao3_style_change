“You okay man?” Sam asked over breakfast a few hours later, looking up at him in concern as he moved his cereal around the bowl and made no effort to actually put any in his mouth, “you seem kinda… spaced out.”
“Some sort of adhesive qualities to his skin, from what we can see,” Tony jumped in, and when the team all looked at him blankly, he waved a hand. “He stuck to Steve’s arm and wouldn’t let go.”
“Yeah, we were expecting you at Zeke’s last week, we came all the way down especially!” One of the other girls called, and Steve had to step back as the gaggle of people enveloped Tony from all sides.
A billion thoughts were swirling through his mind, nearly overwhelming him. He kept replaying the words:
Steve broke away, brushing their noses together. “I can guarantee that everything you’re thinking is wrong,” he said with a small smile, “because you are remarkably good at coming to the worst conclusions, and I'm excellent at giving the wrong impressions.”
The Avengers found them on the battlefield, side by side, chest to chest, still holding onto one another’s hands as they lay amongst the rubble of the world they’d just saved.
The wheelchair he was in was fucking irritating and meant he was restricted to only really working with small bits of machinery and little projects, but the Doctors had said he’d be able to move to crutches soon, which would make everything a lot easier. He had a few projects that he could work on despite that though, so he quickly delved into them, trying to keep his mind focused.
“Look,” Steve said, shuffling around to face Tony more, “I appreciate… everything you’ve done for me, Tony, I really do. I just- I can’t go to hospital. I can’t. They
He sighed miserably. “Hurts,” he heard himself whimper, and some part of him was a little mortified to admit that, but the bigger part just wanted it all to stop.
“Just…” Tony sighed and then stood up, pushing off the table, “just come on, Ty, let’s go watch Loki rip the metaphorical heart out of Bain again-“
He jumped in surprise as he felt Steve’s arms snap away from his own face and curl tightly around Tony’s biceps, shoving him back so he hit the wall. His head thumped lightly against it, not enough to hurt, but enough to know that it could. If Steve pressed a little harder, he could.
He turned Antonius around, so they were chest to back, his hand drifting down to the edge of the shift. “I want to do everything to you, but for now, I need to be in you.”
reason to - and instead of speaking to me about it, took it upon himself to wrench him by the ear till he cried. So I did what was necessary.”
“Peter don’t!” He bit out as he pulled him clear, but the step had clearly been too close and the snake’s head snapped out, it’s mouth gaping as it bit him, catching a flash of bare skin between jeans and sock.
“You are my friend,” he told Tony, who seemed to relax at the words. “I am dealing with a personal concern, nothing more.”
“Oh God, sorry, it’s Tony.” He held out his hand to shake and Steve gripped it firmly with a large hand, and Tony could feel the warmth through his gloves.
And maybe this could be enough. What they had now. Maybe they didn’t have to have pups or be together in the same way other married couples were, even though Tony longed for the hot intimacy of their first night. They were married in the eyes of God, and they clearly both cared for one another.
“Then maybe just tell him that. You think it was easy having those conversations with Natasha when she told me that she'd never be able to have one? And I was fine with it, because I loved her and I figured, there are plenty of orphans out there who need a family if we decided we wanted to be more than just a family of two. But it took a long time for her to believe me and not feel like she'd be taking away a future I might have wanted.” He shrugged. “Talking’s important.”
“Sorry we had to cut your road trip short, Captain Rogers,” Agent Coulson said, looking up from his folder. “I’m sure there was more of the country you wanted to see, but I’m afraid this takes precedence.”
“That’s the hope.” Sam agreed, though the little pleased smile told Steve he’d appreciated the confidence. His expression went soft. “I find myself anticipating their arrival a little more everyday.” He seemed lost in thought for a moment, but eventually put his foot into the stirrup and mounted in a smooth movement. “Now get on the horse and let’s go. Phillips’ guys said they’ll handle the prisoners.”
“No problem,” the man said, as he stepped out from behind the desk. “You’re not the first to be enthralled by Jemison. She has a gift.”
Tony covered his face with his hands for a moment, weighing the potential humiliation, but then walked over to his closet and opened it. The door swung open to show the mini-collage of photos of Steve before the serum from Camp Lehigh, his military records, and rebirth taped to the inside. He looked up at the ceiling feeling the heat crawling into his cheeks.
“No,” Steve said softly. “I said I didn’t like what you were becoming. You were being chipped away bit by bit by Stane, he was making you more and more like your dad and I could see that you hated it, but you kept at it anyway.” He sighed. “I may have said yes when Natasha suggested this, but it doesn’t mean I haven’t followed what you’ve been up to. Stopping weapons development, expanding on medical and clean energy. You’ve been doing great, Tones.”
Tony’s mind flashed back to the night in the saloon. How frantic he’d been to be with Steve, even as he’d been almost too tired to think straight: a driving need, even through his fear.
He wondered if maybe one day the Sheriff might permit a visit. He’d been open to most things so far, but then maybe accepting your omega’s family (or close enough) to visit for a few weeks might be too much.
And what could Stíofán say to that? That because he was a buck, it was his place to make sure they were safe? He had a feeling that wouldn’t go down well.
So that’s what a Cap speech sounded like. Tony felt a little dazed. “You know, you’d make a killing at motivational speaking.”
“Hey!” Steve called,  grabbing a paperback off the stack and throwing it with precision. It struck the man’s hand hard as he swung around to face Steve, forcing him to drop the gun with a yelp. Steve followed up with a second, this time hitting him in the stomach and causing him to double over, groaning in pain.
“Oh my god!” Maria squealed, running across the porch. She leapt into the waiting embrace laughing as she was spun around.
No dramatic crash this time - just Steve calling his name and Tony turning to see him carrying his bag, a work laptop, a coffee, and a large stack of files that were precariously balanced under his chin.
“I appreciate it. He’s my whole world, I couldn’t-- thank you. Viz and I run the telegraph office. He’s a real whiz with morse code you know? If you ever need something sent, come on by. Free of charge.”
That made Tony a little uneasy for a second. It’s not that he didn’t take Peter new places, he did, but the idea of it sometimes still gave him a bit of a spike. The curse of having a kid who was too adventurous and saw pedestrian crossings as suggestions, cars as friends he hadn’t met yet, and happy to touch any and everything he found on the ground. Also, it didn’t help that Tony’s genius brain ran through scenarios even without thought, even when it wasn’t unsafe. But, he wanted to go, and Steve wanted them there, and Peter needed to go to new places. There wasn’t another option, and frankly, he didn’t want to do anything else.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!” Tony muttered as he tried to bring the broom under control, the city was becoming more obvious now as they plummeted, rain soaked and heavy, and Tony leaned, trying to send them to a safe spot. He could see the slight rise of the hill the bakery was on and aimed for it. He pulled up hard to slow their speed as they got near, and the shift in force sent them spinning. Tony grabbed Jarvis and tucked him safely into the cage of his arms and closed his eyes as they braced for impact.
Tony fell asleep on his chest almost as soon as they were horizontal, and Steve wasn’t far behind - even the worry that he might awake to find Tony shivering with his skin aflame unable to resist the pull of sleep. He nuzzled his face into Tony’s hair and drifted off, praying for good news come morning.
Steve didn’t pay much attention to proceedings after that. He clung to Tony, letting himself be led, and it wasn’t long before he realised they were back in the tower, Tony taking him through to his room and pushing him gently onto the bed.
Tony’s words seemed to spook him, he clearly hadn’t seen Tony behind the shelf when he’d entered. Instead of answering he raised his arm, the cuff falling back to reveal the gun in his hand.
Steve wandered over to his closet and pulled out his duffel. He threw in some clothes, some toiletries and finally his sketchbook and a few supplies.
They’d been at an Avengers Fundraiser, one of the few times Steve didn’t mind playing a dancing monkey if he was honest. At least the money was going to something useful.
, Steve mouthed shirt still covering half his face. But one look from the bartender and he sheepishly stood up, brushing himself off and helping Bucky up.
“You horny bastard,” Stíofán baaaaa-d, happy to tease the hell out of Bucky even while knowing he was a huge hypocrite given how he’d picked his own mate. Unless Tony’s personality was in his ass, Stíofán didn’t have a hoof to stand on. But he wasn’t going to let Bucky know that.
For all he’d decided to win a bride purely out of lust, that was no longer the case, he could admit that.
The hand looped through the thin straps of his right shoulder, then his left, and soon the soft material slipped down, revealing the whole of his chest. He felt as though his face must be on fire: never had he been so naked in the presence of an alpha. He had to turn his head away, unable to look him in the eye. He’d never felt like this before. Hot and needy.
Tony looked around the party with a sense of loneliness. He should be having a good time. It had been a good year for Stark Industries: he’d gotten their new line of medtech out before the deadline, and now he was able to celebrate with his employees at the annual Stark Christmas Party on the top floor of a five-star hotel. The canapés were delicious, the drinks were flowing, and yet Tony felt like his smile was plastered on. He bantered, he chatted, he flirted a little in some cases, but it was all hollow. Unfulfilling.
Steve’s jaw dropped. “Oh my god!” He looked down at the bike, his grin widening till it almost split his face. “You’re amazing.”
His reaction was completely out of his control, as Tony felt himself freeze, heart pounding as he stared at Maybe-George for just a moment before he realised his mistake. But it was too late, it had been obvious as fuck.
“You don’t know that! It could get worse, you could--” Stíofán swallowed. He couldn’t say it. Couldn’t face the idea that he might wake up and Tony wouldn’t be here with him.
The bouncer came in from outside at the bartender’s gesture and grabbed the man by the arm. “Take him down to the station, cops can lock him up.” He turned to Steve. “Thanks. Next round’s on the house.”
He walked, his hand trailing over garden walls, and breathing the salty air as he got ever closer to the coast. He counted down the numbers on the mail boxes, arriving at the address on the envelope he held as the street opened up to a wide view of the sea.
“I said I’m fine,” Steve managed, averting his eyes. “If you might leave me for a spell? I’m...hungry. I could use a bite to eat.”
Sam nodded, still looking at Tony, but as Bucky turned to go he saw Sam’s hand out of the corner of his eye brush over Bucky’s forearm where Tony would bet every dollar he had his words were printed. It was soft, intimate, and so second nature it made Tony’s heart ache.
“I didn’t stop loving you,” Steve suddenly blurted and Tony’s eyes widened in surprise, his heart skipping a beat. “Just because I couldn’t watch you become everything you hated didn’t mean that leaving you hurt any less.”
Steve let the warmth of the praise for his omega flood over him, even as he leaned on the side of the building with a raised brow. “I seem to recall saying no gun tricks.”
He jumped when Steve suddenly coughed, gripping his arms to keep him from turning over. “Hey, no, stay down. I’ll call med-evac, you just -”
“Senior. Then my dear old dad took over the company and had me. But, uh, you’ve remained a fixture of the Stark family.”
“Yeah but I know. And I'm sure Tony knows too, he was just real het up over the situation, quite rightly, and if you guys had had a chance to talk before we left, then I'm sure it would have blown over by now. But I mean he's had four days to cool off, so I'm sure he's not mad anymore”
He did, but for all he loved to fly it was just a normal part of being a witch. Hearing Steve talk about it with such longing was such a different experience. “If I get my broom finished, maybe I can take you flying.”
The man in blue’s expression hardened. “I thought your boss wanted him to make weapons. He can’t do that if he’s dead.”
Tony scowled. “Steve only wants to talk to me because he’s obsessed with flying. You said so yourself.”
He wished he’d had a chance to get Anthony’s likeness so he knew who he was looking for. Brooklyn Junction wasn’t a big town by any means, but they were the nearest station for the surrounding areas, so the train could get a mite busy.
Tiberius looked like he was pissing himself. “No! He can’t— I didn’t—“ he took one more look at Tony before he made a run for it, having to pass Stíofán to get out. As he did Stíofán kicked him, sending him sprawling painfully to the ground. He grunted but scrambled to his feet and was gone.
Tony shook his head, then found himself turned gently onto his side and drawn back to lie in the curve of the alpha’s body, an arm lying over his hip.
Tony shook his head. Well, that wouldn’t do. Stíofán scooped some of the figs with his spoon, dropping it into Tony’s own bowl. “Have some.”
And then they’d had a moment, just a small one, where they’d talked, and he’d revealed hidden parts of himself to Steve, and he’d been so close, so close to saying-- well, it was for the best, really, that’s Mrs Aberforth had interrupted, before the delight of the evening had made Steve’s tongue loose in a way he couldn’t take back.
“So um, there’s an art fair tomorrow, and I’m showing some of my pieces. I was wondering if maybe you and Peter wanted to come? I meant to ask earlier but I didn’t know if you’d want--”
“I’m glad to hear it. We don’t entertain as much as we used to, and I find from time to time that I miss it.” He gave Steve a look. “You really must come again.”
Word of his success at the Barton farm spread, however, and Tony found himself inundated with requests. He filled his schedule quickly, heading out early in the morning and coming home late in the evening, with any free time spent helping in the bakery.
He heard the bang of a door and turned to see Mr Barton heading his way. He waved politely, walking to meet him at the gate.
What if the Sheriff was hurt? Surely one of the deputies would come to tell him? Unless they were hurt too.
Steve came to lie beside him, looking very smug, but for once Tony couldn’t fault him. “Did you like it?” he asked, his tone suggesting he knew the answer already.
Steve beamed, opening the gate and inviting him in. Tony stepped through, finding a well kept garden and cottage, along with a shed nestled in the corner. It was very pretty, and Tony found himself relaxing at the sight of a herb garden, filled with all the sorts his mother liked to use in her potions.
The bartender nodded and returned to behind the bar, already starting to pour glasses of beer from the tap, as everyone else put the tables to rights and took their seats. Bucky turned to speak to Steve, giving him a punch on the shoulder as Steve rolled his eyes. Then he caught sight of Tony over Bucky’s shoulder, and a surprised smile spread across his face. Tony felt his heart flutter a little. The guy sure was pretty.
Stíofán was the best fighter there, so it was easy for him to move through the rounds until he and Ivor stood, awaiting the signal to begin.
When he could wait no longer, he started to thrust, slow and steady, the warm fleece so soft beneath his hands, heightening the pleasure.
“I did,” Tony confirmed, his voice sharp and full of fight. “This man thought our son had stolen something - not that he had
And that idea was nice too, but he found he wanted to look. He curled his hands around Tony’s arms and rolled, pulling the doe on top. “You going to stay awake this time?”
“Ow,” Steve managed, but it sounded clear and strong, and Tony breathed a sigh of relief as he looked down at him, his glasses wonky but undamaged on his face. “The ground hurts.”
“Thank you. Really, when I say you’ve helped I mean it. It feels safe when Peter’s with you. I feel like I can relax outside my own house for once.”
The hand drifted higher, dragging up his thigh, until a tentative finger brushed against his opening and he gasped.
The alpha tipped his hat obligingly. “No trouble at all. You enjoy your day now.” And walked off towards the ticket office.
“Yes I know!” Tony snapped, and then immediately felt guilty. “I’m sorry Jarvis. I don’t mean to be a dick.”
“Or something,” Steve agreed, a grin covering his face. “Let’s go. We don’t want to miss out on a table.”
He turned away and went to the bedroom, where Tony could hear the sounds of a bag being unzipped. Tony wanted to go after him, apologise and stop him, tell him not to go.
When he glanced back Steve was looking more relaxed and Tony felt a shimmer of hope that maybe he hadn’t blown it after all.
Tony looked sheepish. “Uhhh I made it automatic? If you address it by name it’ll listen to the order and process it for you.”
Tony opened his mouth to make Steve’s excuses and let the man leave, but to his surprise, Steve was eager in his agreement.
“Just my usual fee,” Bruce replied, sounding amused. “It’s my job to look after people, same as yours, Sheriff.”
Stíofán groaned. If they were still preparing it was very early. He gave Tony a nudge. “We have to get up.”
“A disappointment? Tony, I hurt you, made you cry. You didn’t like it. We don’t have to do it when you don’t like it and it causes you pain.”
“That would be nice,” he finally managed, feeling a thrill when Tony’s face lit up in a smile. “I really appreciate that.”
“Dodger!” Peter cheered. The dog growled at the snake, keeping himself between it and Peter. He made a few warning nips at it, barking the whole time.
Until the ten masked men had burst in the doors, waving guns and shouting “this is a hostage situation.”
“Tony,” Steve huffed, feeling frustrated. “I know you're upset, and you’re right to be. But we live in a small town. Sometimes we have to exercise a little diplomacy to make sure it doesn’t come back to bite us.”
The thing about living in New York was that even a walk to get lunch could turn exceedingly dramatic. And potentially fatal.
Tony winced, thinking of their warm, cozy townhouse, with its large walk-in shower in the ensuite. “That sounds rough. Are you looking for other apartments?”
“Sure I did,” the alpha said, looking at him seriously. “Couldn’t have any of those vipers talking about my omega like that, could I?”
Steve had been bright red, but he’d gotten with the programme quick, pulling Tony against him and getting very handsy. Tony had loved it.
Probably because he was under a pile of guys all wrestling on the floor trying to put each other in headlocks. It didn’t look too violent, but it wasn’t friendly either.
There was a clang and a shout, and Stíofán turned just in time to catch Tony as he launched himself at him, his arms around his neck. Stíofán hugged him close, burying his face in his hair for just a second, as he felt the doe tremble.
“A blob. There’s no other way to describe it. It’s big, it’s destroying the city, and we need to stop it.”
“It’s what witches do,” Tony shrugged, petting Jarvis when he jumped onto his shoulder to comfort him. “And I can’t call home. Then I’ll have to tell them it’s only day one in my new town and I’m already failing.”
“Wait, Steve, wait!” And then there was a tug on his case, and the zipper gave way. Steve looked back to see Tony, wide-eyed, the case hanging open and his shield visible to every onlooker on the street.
His eyebrows shot up his forehead. “Is this- Steve!” He got up and leaned out the back door. “Steve, come here quick!”
As he pulled the garment on, he felt the squirmy feeling in his stomach ramp up. He felt the soft linen slide across his skin, and as the nightgown settled on his frame he saw the pleasing line of lace frame his collarbones.
He felt a sob rise up in his chest, but he pushed it back. Jarvis hadn’t raised him to be a quitter after all. Maybe he wasn’t any good at...that, but he could certainly be an asset to the house.
Well, that was enough of that. If he kept on he’d have to excuse himself and that would be embarrassing enough.
Maria looked at them critically before choosing the top bunk. “It doesn't matter too much. I have to do this all again in two weeks once rotation is over.”
“Rogers. But just Steve is fine,” the blond adonis said an easy smile on his face. “And that’s Dodger.”
The pull of gravity shifted, and they soared up, almost hitting a nearby building as they did, and crashing to the ground in an untidy heap. It hurt, but nowhere near as much as hitting the ground properly would’ve. Tony rolled to his knees, eyes flicking around frantically for Steve until they landed on him a few feet away. “Steve!”
He looked at it: the last tie to his family and the life they expected for him wiped away with the scratch of an ink pen.
Stíofán huffed but picked up his tools to get back to work. He had to put in the labour if he wanted to earn a bleat.
He opened his mouth to change the topic when there was a loud crash and Bucky’s voice shouting over the noise, “oh for fuck’s sake. Not again!”
“Yeah I hear you,“ Sam agreed. “I'm sure Natasha's raging just as much as Tony that I took off without a word. You know how much she hates that.”
It was a little awkward at first, but eventually, they got into a rhythm. Tony would build his broom, Steve would work on his motorbike. They’d talk, listen to music. Sometimes Tony would stay for dinner with Steve and his Ma, other times they’d go into town and Steve would show him the best places to eat. And of course, the place they visited most was the dirigible. It was getting closer and closer to its maiden voyage
“Yeah, he wanted… well he wanted me to follow in his footsteps, all the while resenting me for being smarter than he was. It was..tough. Then, when my mom passed away, we had nothing keeping us together. I wanted to do something else. And Jay,-“ he looked up to meet Steve’s eyes, “he was our butler, but he loves me like I’m his kid. He’s always been an amateur collector of books. He loves them, and he showed that to me. He wanted to pass on the passion.” He grinned gesturing to the shop. “It worked. So I sold my company shares and bought this place.”
He could hear their footsteps approaching and he knew he should stop before they got there. But as he started to pull away, Tony reached back and grabbed his tunic holding him in place. “Harder, please!”
“You have ten seconds to drop your weapons and surrender,” the newcomer said, with the commanding tone of someone who expected to be obeyed. “I won’t ask again.”
There was the sound of skin hitting skin - a series of thuds and grunts - and Tony pushed himself up to peer over the counter.
Barnes darted out of Steve’s reach with a laugh. “Chill Stevie. You put a ring on his finger, I don’t think he’ll be put off by finding out his alpha has all the class of donkey.”
“Famous last words,” Steve mumbled, wincing when Bucky boxed him in the shoulder. With his metal arm. Ouch. “Fine. What did you have in mind?”
nothing.” Tony was close enough that Steve could breathe in his scent with every inhale, and it was making him feel a little dizzy. His stance was casual, unaggressive, but the pheromones he was giving off screamed protective, and Steve couldn’t help but revel in it.
Steve was hit by another squall, the wind making him slip until he was left gripping tightly to the very end. Tony could see the strain in his arms, and he swooped in, making another go for Steve’s hand.
! I can’t believe you made me wait to find out what happened after they became trapped by the iceberg.”
It was an odd thought, one he hadn’t really let himself have until now. But, he liked it here. It was quiet and peaceful in a way he hadn’t felt in years and the people here were kind to him, offering their friendship to him not even knowing who he was or what he’d done. They treated him like Steve, and that meant something to him, not to be weighed down by expectation and just able to be a guy people liked talking to.
This reality was particularly hammered home for Tony as he and Steve walked to get lunch on a cool September afternoon at some small family-owned place Steve had discovered.
“It’s alright Steve, you’ll be safe here. There’s food and drink in the bags there, and heat aids in the drawer. You need anything, just ask JARVIS, he’ll sort it out.”
Peter would play with Dodger until they were both tired, and Steve and Tony would sit and chat for a while. Eventually Tony started to bring coffee for both of them to keep away the winter chill, and the heavy smell of coffee mixed with Steve’s rich cologne was starting to become his favourite scent.
“Never say that again: that title is so dumb. I can’t believe that became a thing. Who told the Mayor it was a good idea?” Tony suspected it was Rhodey, though he didn’t have the proof - yet - and? Sam’s casual whistle didn’t help.
Tony huffed. Perhaps there was some truth in that. “I just don’t want you to be disappointed. But it’s not just about you. I want another one too. Peter’s getting so big. I want to hear another first word, see another first step. I want Peter to have a sister or a brother, so he isn’t alone like I was.”
“Shhhhh!” Tony said, slapping a hand over Rhodey’s mouth - or trying to, but it was more of a flail. “He might hear you.”
Tony didn’t bother to look back and simply took off at a trot as he headed for the way home. He could feel tears ready to fall as his mind tried to cope with the worry of the day and the anger he felt, but he pushed them back. The walk seemed less frightening this time around, though it didn’t stop him from flinching when a coyote crossed his path with a flash of yellow eyes.
He could see the dirigible in the distance, and he tilted the broom towards, the steering easy and effortless.
There was a loud rumble overhead, followed by a sharp crack that hurt Tony’s ears, and he looked up to see the edge of the Oscorp Tower, breaking off as smoke poured out the side. There were screams as large chunks of concrete and glass rained from the sky, and the people around him started to run, quickly turning the street into stampede.
, Tony thought, and then mentally shook himself. That was a ridiculous thing to say, and totally creepy. They were friends, just friends, and they’d only know each other for a short while. Instead, he managed the much toned down. “Well, you’re welcome anytime. We'd be happy to have you.”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “That is...surprising. Like, really surprising. I sort of assumed you’d be a chick magnet.”
He got rather good when all was said and done, and he bragged shamelessly in his letters home to the Jarvises and Pepper.
And so Stíofán found himself telling Antonius the whole story. How he’d left his Ma to take goods to trade to Londinium with his best friend Bucky. How Bucky had gone back to the room they’d rented but Stíofán had stayed hoping to win another
“Means this freak show was good for something at least,” Steve said a little dejectedly, and Bucky clicked his tongue, looking from Steve down at the camera in his hand and back again.
Tony sighed internally, trying to lock onto what Steve was saying and respond appropriately. God, but the guy was so hot though.
By the time they hit the main street, it was an easy flow of chatter and Tony was feeling better as time went on.
He braced the car against his side, his free hand reaching to tug the man free and clear before he let it drop with a loud thud.

They could offer him all the pretty does they wanted, nothing would make him complacent. Though he had to admit, the smell of ready-to-mate doe on the breeze was delicious. He could well understand why they considered it a temptation. There were a lot of lonely nights in the
“Hey jerk, she lives off that tip. Hell, she deserves a lot more than fifteen percent for putting up with your ugly mug.”
Ana smiled at the Luis story, and she and Edwin told him a few stories from their own trips over the years. “...and then a seagull flew into him and he jumped so high he tossed his sandwich over the edge of the canyon!” she said laughing, even as Edwin looked put out. “You have never seen a man so desolate over a ham and cheese sandwich.”
“Sounds about right,” the newcomer said, giving the pushy alpha a look. “Seems to me that it’s time you moved on. And don’t let me catch you ‘chitchatting’ like this again.”
Steve huffed but stretched out on the low sofa obediently. He lifted his leg to rest his ankle on the back, revealing more of the lace panties. Promising.
Steve slammed them on, the bike coming to a halt and floating in mid-air, and Tony sighed in relief.
, he didn’t want him anymore? For all he’d been confident in front of Pepper, he despised the idea of having to return home in shame, a scandalous divorcé.
He went to Fury in the morning, determined to get it done, in case Tony tried to change his mind. He could be very determined when he wanted to be.
how angry it makes me that you could fucking believe that bullshit, even for a single second? Are you out of your
When he leaned back again, Tony’s eyes were shut and he was taking in a shaky breath. He waited a few seconds until he could see the electric blue of Tony’s eyes, and then grinned brightly. Couldn’t help it. He felt excited and nervous and
him anymore. He goes out every night with his friends and comes back home a little more altered, and I can’t stop him. I’ve tried. But I can’t. He doesn’t want my help. Doesn’t think he needs help from anyone.” Thor’s face turned sharp as he shook his head. “Thanks to our wonderful parents, Loki learned self-sufficiency at a very young age. I grew up looking after him, but he grew up being the one that had to be coddled by his big brother. Sometimes I wonder if he always hated me as much as he does now, but just never showed it.”
Two minutes after he’d seen Peter and his classmates pass by, he watched a few other familiar faces as they wandered down the corridor. Not the good kind of familiar, either. The ‘why the fuck are you taking up my line of sight you fuck’ sort of familiar.
“Fuck, your guy’s filthy fucking rich,” Bucky’s eyes were at his hairline as he stared at the little Stark Industries logo in the corner of the tab, “and also an heir to one of the biggest businesses in the world.”
“if I hadn’t, I might not even have let you in the door,” Steve told him wryly, and Tony stopped at that, opening his mouth as if wanting to argue before realizing that Steve was probably right.
“Of course I do,” Tony found Steve’s hands and pressed his own over the top of them, “do you know how much this outfit cost?”
Tony was still glaring grimly at Bucky. “I don’t actually feel in the mood to listen to you verbally piss all over your territory, thanks-“
He watched Tony look rapidly between his friends and Steve for a moment, before swallowing and cutting Steve off with an uncaring wave of his hand. His eyes were cold.
“I should have let you try and help me when you offered, I was the one who let our relationship fall to pieces—”
Silence fell once more, heavy and thick. Steve wanted to say a million things. Wanted to say that he didn’t deserve Tony’s admiration. That he would do it all over again in a heartbeat if he had to, even if this time Tony left without him. He wanted to tell him that leaving him in the first place had been the biggest, most stupid decision of his life, and he’d never wanted to hurt Tony to the extent that he had.
Steve smiled wryly. “Steve Rogers Original?” He asked, and when Tony laughed, it felt like music to his ears. All he’d seen of Tony these past 24 hours was a heart-breaking sadness. Laughter was a welcome change.
Tony made a face and raised his hands. “Well there you go,” he replied quietly before tugging Steve’s hand, the touch gentle, “come on- let’s get you sorted.”
Tony blinked rapidly, eyes flicking all over Steve’s face, caught between staring at his eyes and his mouth. Eventually he just spluttered a little and nodded, mouth opening and shutting uselessly as Steve leaned into him. “I- uh- I mean- I… yes. Obviously. I- yeah. Yep,” he eventually managed to get out, his voice a few octaves higher than usual.
She laughed sweetly, patting his cheek. “See, this seems to be proving far more effective than any of the other methods,” her voice was full of delight and triumph, and he wanted to spit at her again, but his face wasn’t listening to him. He couldn’t stop crying. It was all he could see, right there, right in the front of his mind, his hands around Tony’s neck-
baby, don’t cry, please, it’s okay, I… I know. I know you want to sleep, I’m sorry I didn’t notice sooner, I was a jerk. But why the hell haven’t you told anyone? Do you black out? Is it making you sick? Are you hallucinating yet?”
“I was thinking, and considering the current situation, maybe I should just remain here. Seems like a pretty good call. But uh, you can do whatever you need to do.”
“Oh I thought maybe you’d left,” Steve said from behind him, looking sheepish. “But you wandered into my studio.”
The alpha’s friends stood up from the table, more than resting a hand close to the weapon on their belt, clearly looking to start something. “You want to avoid a beating, Sheriff, I suggest you take care of you and yours.”
His sleep was broken, and he woke often, always checking Steve still slept soundly. He was going to make sure he got better.
Now that the battle was over, Tony set to finding Steve. He hoped that he’d just been pushed to the side and was further along.
Tony hung up, took a fortifying breath, and stepped out. To his relief, Steve was still asleep, and so he snuck over first to the bookshelf. He grabbed the action figures and funko bobbleheads tossing them carefully into his laundry basket. He mouthed ‘sorry’ to the Cap plushy he’d had since he was a kid and tucked him in too, grabbing a pile of discarded clothes and dumping them on top to hide the evidence.
were not coming into his house, and he would see them off before his husband returned home. He wouldn’t have Steve face them alone and unwarned.
Tiberius opened his mouth to respond but snapped it shut when a bowl of mush was placed in front of him.
Tony wasn’t even sure when things began to change. He had been attracted to Steve from the start obviously: the guy was a snack, made all the better by his hidden depths of snark and a fierce belief in fairness that took Tony by surprise.
“What happened??” He sounded a tad hysterical – he could hear it – but he couldn’t seem to get it under control. Steve was carried inside a room, the doctor directing them to a bed to lie him on. The last thing he saw was Steve’s pale face before the door closed behind them.
Tony hated to admit it but it made him feel better, and he left the shop not long after, his belly full and his mind finally quiet. He followed the directions, carrying the covered basket and wishing not for the first time that he had his broom. Being a grounded witch was tiring, on top of being embarrassing.
With the alpha’s help, he and Tony secured the ropes around the axle and led the horse carefully forward until the weight was suspended. “If the cart shifts forward, he’ll be made into jam,” Tony told Mr Barton quietly. “It needs to be still.”
“You old romantic, you,” Tony teased, but he could feel the heat in his cheeks nonetheless. His car pulled up, with Happy in the driver’s seat, eyes boggling at Tony in Steve’s arms.
“Great! I’ll come pick you up at 7!” He put Jarvis down gently on the ground, and headed for the door. “See you tonight!”
But he’d set this up awhile back, and the guy was still hot in a kind of dickish way so he hadn’t seen the harm. He was definitely regretting it now.
“Can’t sleep in this chair all night.” He wanted to get Tony lying down and comfortable, maybe get some food in him. He still looked exhausted.
The deputy looked suitably surprised. “I see, well that sounds as sensible as anything I’d suggest. How will you--”
The doe whined at that, though Stíofán couldn’t tell if the thought was pleasing or shocking. “I can’t wait to have you suck me, those pretty lips brushing over my dick, it’ll be incredible.”
“Well, don’t spend too much time feeling sorry for yourself. When you’re my age you want to be happy with the life you led, not weighed down with regrets.”
“Scarlet fever. You’ll need to keep Peter away from the other kids once we send you home. It spreads easily.”
Stíofán paid careful attention to both nipples watching Tony’s reactions with interest. He wished he had more time to get to know them, but it was getting late, he would need to sleep soon, as much as he’d like to stay in this moment forever.
“That’d be nice,” Steve agreed. “But if it doesn’t happen, there are still so many things that will happen in our lives that make them special. You can invent more for Rogers’ Industries. We can travel. I can learn some of the new dances from back East, take you dancing in the fancy ballrooms in San Francisco. You and I can make love down by the river till we’re old and grey. And one day Peter will have his own pups, and you’ll have grandchildren to watch over. We will have a thousand chances for happiness, and I want to spend all of them with you.”
“This is Alpine.” Bucky held up a carrier where a white ball of fluff meowed pitifully. “I was hoping you might be able to help her out.”
Tony flushed, unsure what to do. “No no, it’s very good. I’m just a slow eater is all.” His stomach rumbled in protest.
Of course. Tony went to the bed, stripping the bed of the linens and uncovering the mattress. He’d seen Ana do this too, and so he dragged the heavy mattress outside. The sweat poured from his brow by the time he was done, his fingers sore from grasping it and his arms tired. He threw it over the fence outside, and taking a stick he’d found, he began to beat the dust from it. He opted to leave it air and returned inside. He considered cleaning the sheets immediately, but he knew that would take most of his time and decided to leave the washing for another day.
“Of course I did! You think I’d see you in trouble and not drop everything to come over here and--” His rant was cut off as Steve hauled him down by his robes, kissing him soundly.
But then he’d gotten pregnant, and it had been such a relief. His body worked like it was supposed to, Tony reassured himself, and he could give what he and Steve both wanted so bad.
And on the other was a very familiar omega wielding a wooden spoon, with an equally familiar child behind him, clinging to his legs and his eyes red from crying.
“Yes, I’ll send you a pic of my room once we get there. J.J’s in the shower, but his stuff’s by the door so now we’re just waiting for Pops to get back.”
Mrs Rogers had given great instructions for latticing, and he’d managed without too much trouble. He clapped his hands excitedly.
He stayed close till he felt the muscles unlock, letting Tony stand on his own two hooves. “What did I just say?”
“Not much. Crime scenes. Government secrets.” Steve had no idea what his face looked like, but when Bucky met his eyes he snorted. “Come on, it just means I can work a camera. And I can totally take sexy pictures. How hard can it be?”
If there was an alpha who could resist that sort of temptation, Steve would like to shake their hand: they had to have a will of iron.
Tony could feel the blood rushing to his cheeks. This was so awkward! He hadn't seen Steve since the incident with the party, though Steve had tried to see him, Tony knew. He’d just always managed to be out when he’d swung by, as Sam made sure to tell him. But here he was now, standing in front of Tony wearing the cute glasses and an oversized t-shirt, looking shocked.
Stíofán let his hand slide forward until it was resting on Tony’s belly, unable to resist the flicker of hope that this might be the time they added to their little family. A doe this time maybe, with Tony’s dark eyes, since the bucks had taken so much of Stíofán’s colouring.
thing to do was for you to go to the rendezvous point and warn the crew. And I begged you to do it, so you wouldn’t be captured too. But you stayed. You picked me up and hid us in those caves and you kept me warm when the temperature dropped. I remember thinking, when I was tucked up against your chest by the fire, that you must genuinely care about me under that rigid posture and those calculating words of yours.”
“Please Steve,” his breathing was coming a little fast, and he kissed him, rough and desperate. “Please.”
There was a jolt of lightning across the sky as the dark clouds moved ever closer. He could feel a prickle of worry working its way up his spine as the first few droplets of rain began to fall.
He’d heard horror stories of children getting high fevers and rashes. Pups could die from that, he knew.
“Christ. I expect you to be the height of gratitude for the rest of the day then. Your pops and I aren’t that bad.”
He pulled Hugh out, giving him to Bucky before tugging Peadar out, feeling his heart stop when he felt how stiff the kid was. Had he hit his head on the way down?
Steve nodded his agreement. Natasha's life before Sam had been difficult, and she still found it hard when their work took them away. Steve knew from Sam that it left her unsettled and irritable, with little to distract her, and that Sam hated to be the cause of her distress.
The diner had been grateful and their waitress, Angie, always had a treat for them whenever they went back.
Absolutely not, Tony thought, and started walking off, looking forward and ignoring the calls behind him. As he heard Steve get closer, he mounted his broom and launched himself up into the air.
This had to be some kind of sign that Tony was meant to climb this man like a tree. He looked even better in the tight t-shirt and dark jeans he wore under the apron, and Tony unconsciously ran his tongue over his bottom lip.
“Wait, hold on.” Tony felt his heart suddenly pounding as he parsed through Steve’s words. “You did that for me?”
He walked back until he reached the cordon, checking the medical tent that had been set up to check over injuries. No sign of Steve. A tendril of panic started creeping up his spine as he considered the aftermath of the battle. What if Steve was in amongst that mess, yet to be discovered?
For a moment, Steve looked like he might actually try. But then his shoulders slumped and he sighed. “Where are you even going to keep it?”
She picked up her burger and started to eat. She loved Sam’s burgers, they were her favourite. She hoped they had burgers as good as these on the West Coast.
He expected to find it hard to fall asleep, given how little of it he’d been doing of late. But when his head hit the pillow, it smelled faintly of Tony - spicy and masculine - and he found himself breathing it in and relaxing into its soft embrace. His eyes fell shut, and he was out before he could think anymore.
He stripped the tape off, wincing at the tender skin and rinsing the wounds clear in the bathroom. They’d be gone in a few hours, and then he’d come back here and do it all again.
The group turned to face them, and Tony felt his grin stretch as they took in the new scent. “Sheriff, Mr Rogers, how nice to see you,” Murphy said, mouth twisting in irritation. Tony wondered if he’d been interested in Steve once upon a time before bonding with the Pastor.
Steve’s heart was pounding like crazy as he rode Nomad out to the canyon he knew Hodge’s gang liked to frequent.
Peter shook his head, brown curls tumbling into his eyes. He’d need his hair cut soon. “Mr Rogers isn’t here. How would I know what to learn?”
All of which had let to this moment, where Steve had gone on a fool’s errand to try and forget his feelings, so that he might behave himself and act like the respectable teacher he was instead of losing all sense of propriety every time he heard Mr Stark say--
“To be honest, it sort of threw me out of the mood,” Stíofán admitted, gesturing to his now flaccid cock. “It was strange to see.”
Tony frowned. “I don’t understand,” Tony said, hand coming up to press against his stomach. “I haven’t had a heat in six.”
Of late, however, Tony had become aware of an...attachment. It had started without his notice at first.
terrorising downtown L.A. appeared. It moved, absorbing cars and street signs and dissolving them inside its mass. He watched as a fire hydrant seemed to melt as a tendril of it wrapped around the base. Fuck, that was going to be nasty.
The horn sounded loud, echoing across the stadium as the crowd roared. The morning’s entertainment was over, and it was time for satyr-to-satyr combat. The line up before the consul was familiar, the large grey centaur sitting in a box high above them, the weapons handed out to his preference.
J.J’s hand gripped hers behind their backs. “Yeah, Dad. They’re one of the best Med Schools, you know that.”
Clint grinned. “Thank you. She runs like a charm. I can’t wait to show her off to the neighbours.” He looked up at the sky worriedly. “You sure you should be flying? You could stay here tonight if it’s dangerous. We have a spare room.”
He didn’t wait for Tony to say anything, just moved past him, even though it felt like he was being torn in half. Cap was needed, so it looked like he’d be leaving Steve Rogers back here in Cedar Grove.
The sheriff shuffled in, removing his shirt and breeches and putting them away. He did it slowly as if to lengthen the task, and Tony found it oddly endearing. The alpha was nearly naked, too warm for him to wear much to bed, and Tony covertly looked his fill.
The Sheriff, it turned out, was a prattler. He was pointing out things to Tony as they went, talking to the horse that Tony learned was called Daisy, and shifting around as he guided them to Tony’s new home.
“Thank you!” Scott said, a wide grin spreading over his face. “You just saved us like a thousand bucks. How can we thank you?”
The man looked up at him dazed for a second before looking at the car. “Well, that was a spot of good timing,” he said, an English accent framing his words. He glared at the jack a moment. “Damn thing. Well, thank you young man,” he said, wiping a hand over his brow. “My wife would have been livid if I’d let the roast burn.”
“Sure are. They’re wanted for robbing a stagecoach. Shot the driver and the passengers, then killed two lawmen who went after them. Nasty business.”
“Please,” Pierce smirked. “You think I don’t have an exit strategy? After I got up here, one of my men went to wire the doors with explosives. If any try to enter they’ll be killed, and it’ll take hours for them to send anyone else. We’ve got all the time I need.”
Tony’s jaw dropped and Steve went bright red as he flailed for napkins. “I meant to say sorry, oh my god.”
“Damn proper Deputy! I can’t get low enough in it, and explaining will take too long. Slice through them, quick smart.”
Steve grinned, though his cheeks were still red. “I should let you get back to work. But thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to work here.”
The chair scraped loudly as Tony stood up. “You’re an asshole. I may find all of this--” he flapped his hand around. “--soulmate stuff obnoxious, but to mess with someone’s head like that? That’s disgusting.”
Sam snorted. “Oh right.” He slid the buns into the oven and closed it, putting the oven mitts to the side.
Steve took a big breath and let it out slowly. “Don’t mistake this for lack of pride, but next time you think about helping someone, I’d appreciate it if you kept yourself well away from anything that might crush you.”
It should’ve been embarrassing, but all it did was fill Tony with a hot glow. He tugged at Steve, who let himself be pulled until he was atop him again. “Come on then darling. Time for you to make me your husband for real, hmm?”
!” Tony cried, pointing at the man in front of him. “My luck cannot be this bad. What could I possibly have done to deserve this?”
“That nonsense in there. That man hurt our child, and you excused it all away as a misunderstanding?!”
Not that Steve would be interested. Taking on a child as well as a partner was a lot to ask, and Tony understood that, but that was fine. Besides, he was too busy for romance, working for R&D for Stark Industries and being a single parent, so a harmless crush was just nice to fantasize about.
“Yes sir,” Steve agreed, wanting to fight but knowing it was useless. He had to go, and no amount of wishful thinking would change that. He had a job to do. “Nicest place I’ve been.”
One overpriced cab later and Tony arrived at the hotel that was hosting the launch, happy to see that at least the set up was done and looking great. He checked to make sure the guest list was up to date, spoke to the caterers and made sure the prosthetics had made it without any damage.
He stripped off, dragging out the small heater Sam had left him, sending a tendril of magic to give it a safe boost. He hung up his clothes to dry, noticing now the huge bruise on his hip, and his head started to ache from the chattering of his teeth. He crawled beneath the big heavy duvet on his bed.
Steve sighed, leaning forward and resting his cheek against Tony’s shoulder. “S’pose that’s fair,” he muttered, “I
He raised an eyebrow, scarlet in the face. His hand was shaking a little, but there was the same determined look in his eyes that he kept for battles.
“Fine,” he said grouchily, wishing he’d brought his tablet so that he could fiddle (and maybe track the activity in the top five floors- just to keep ahead of the game, you know.)
“I’d like that,” he said with a nod, and Thor looked surprised for a second- as if he’d expected Steve to reject him in his moment of weakness, “I, uh, I’ve been trying to give myself an excuse to ask someone to come along all day, but…” he puffed out his cheeks and then blew sharply, looking sheepish, “pride and all that. Don’t really want to have to ask for- well, anything, really.”
There was a short silence, and then suddenly three loud claps rang through the air. Steve jumped, looking up for a second, but Tony didn’t seem to be directing them at him. “Everyone- get out. Go find another room- this one is occupied,” he announced, and the couples broke off, looking disgruntled by the interruption. However, they all slinked off after a few seconds, leaving Steve and Tony alone in the vast kitchen.
“No, but I do have common sense. And right now, I think I’m a bit more objective than you are, Scrappy Doo—”
His lack of concentration was paid for, however, when he missed a move from the Pyro and ended up in a molten-hot chokehold. Tony’s eyes bulged and he felt the heat instantly, his temperature gauge rocketing. As far as enforcements went, the neck-plates weren’t that thick in order to ensure maximum dexterity. They were enough to stop a regular man, or even an abnormally strong man from being able to constrict him, but they weren’t so great at holding up against the immense temperatures being inflicted upon them.
“D’you like being the center of attention? Do you think being with Tony’s gonna make you famous?” Pepper added, taking out her phone and beginning to tap something.
In answer, Rumlow waved his hands emphatically. “Who do you think sold you out, Stark? Who do you think gave us your coordinates when you were holed up in that little alley in Santa Barbara? Think we just found you by accident? Luck? Think we captured your precious Stevie and tortured him for answers?” Rumlow chuckled again, shaking his head. “Tony, Tony, Tony… Agent Rogers was working for us all along.”
Mr. Wilson paused, hands flexing on the wheel. “So this was because of Tony? Again?” He sighed. “Steve… it always seems to be him that’s leading you to make these choices, and maybe—”
Bucky looked grim. “Steve- why the fuck were you going out drinking with Tony Stark? Did he pressure you? What-“
Steve immediately lost interest in the conversation, instead turning on his heel and pretty much throwing himself out the door, uncaring of his friends’ laughter.
She pursed her lips, nodding at Bruce as the man got to his knees next to her leg and then began to check her ankle. “I think that AIM have been experimenting with superhumanism,” she said, “SHIELD suspected that for a while, but we never got any concrete evidence, and I didn’t connect the dots. Not until now.” She nodded her head over to the lifeless LMD on the floor next to her. “I think that Peter was created by AIM. I think that, for whatever reason, the woman who brought him here knew what was going on, and wanted to help him. And I think that AIM hunted her down and forced the location of his whereabouts out of her before they killed her. Now… now they’re determined to get their one successful test subject back.”
“Hey, hey, what?” Moving in that Unhumanly fast way of his, Steve crossed the room and settled his hands against Tony’s shoulders, squeezing tightly and looking down at Tony’s face with distress written across his own expression. “Sweetheart, you’re shaking. Why are you shaking? Why would you think I don’t want to be with you any more?” His thumbs brushed delicately over Tony’s shoulders, skimming the skin at the collar of his shirt. He pulled Tony over to the table and then sat him on a chair before pulling up one for himself and then sitting right in front of Tony, their knees brushing. Then he settled his hands around Tony’s, which were bunched up in his lap. “Talk to me,” he said. “What’s going through your head?”
She crouched, hand still gripping his hair. “You do realize that you’re in the same facility where your little pal Bucky was conditioned, right? You do also realise, that all the equipment that we used on him is still fully functioning, just ready to be used?” Her face moved to his ear, warm breath against his clammy skin. “How do you think Tony Stark would fare against a Steve Rogers under HYDRA’s control?”
He wasn’t an invalid any more, no matter what his idiot best friend thought. Just because his Goddamn mom had gone and gotten herself killed didn’t fucking mean he had to become some helpless kid all over again, because he wasn’t, he wasn’t
Tony froze in the doorway, resisting the urge to put a hand up and cover it. That’d be suspicious. Not that- not that there was anything to be suspicious about. “You’d be surprised how dangerous it can be when you mix DUM-E and large wrenches together,” he said in the end, grinning lopsidedly and ignoring the way it made something in his heart break just a fraction. Bruce frowned, and Tony rolled his eyes. “Yes, before you ask, I have iced it. It’ll be fine in a day or so. Anyway, enough about me- what’re you working on?”
His mind raced in terror, the immediate answer of affirmation almost spilling straight out of his mouth. He wanted it to stop. Those dreams… those dreams felt so real, he could feel the coolness of the metal as it was crushed between his fist, Tony’s heart in his hand. The thought of living through something like that again made him want to vomit. Or just die.
“Well, I’m glad you were just making out with your boyfriend as opposed to dying horribly,” Thor said, patting Steve on the shoulder fondly and then turning to Bruce, “now we can return to our jenga game in the cafeteria!”
The jet was on its side, but Steve still hung onto the chair thanks to the seatbelts. He couldn’t hear or see anything going on outside, and he wasn’t sure whether that was a good thing or not. After a cursory check to see whether he had any broken bones, Steve set about getting himself out, yanking off the belt and then making his way over to the emergency exit at the side of the jet.
Tony sighed in resignation, realising he was probably not going to leave this room dry. “Alright, you get that out of your system,” he muttered, rolling up his shirt-sleeves and then flicking water back at Peter, who only cackled harder, smashing down on a pile of bubbles and sending the suds flying everywhere.
“I went on a date yesterday,” John blurted, fiddling with his glasses and then looking around the room. Steve nodded encouragingly at him, and John seemed to take strength from that, because he pushed forward. “First one, after my husband… it was nice. He was called Riley and it was his first date too. He cried while we were served our salad.”
- he didn’t know what Bucky’s mind had concocted in the panic between Steve going missing and coming back, but it was obviously not good, and needed to be put to bed as soon as possible.
Across the room and sat on his ass helplessly, Steve’s head jerked up, eyes wide and horrified. “I didn’t even touch him,” he whispered, “he just… I was sat here trying to, to prepare myself, and then he grabbed my hand and- and now he’s stuck!” Steve lifted his hand, showing the splayed out palm that Peter’s fingers appeared to be sticking to as if glued in place. He was giggling to himself, clearly unfazed. “I don’t know what I did Tony! I was just sat here and now I… he’s stuck! I didn’t-”
Steve sniffed, shutting his eyes and shaking his head. “I… God, you wouldn’t believe me even if I told you.”
“Steve, even I think you’re a little more likeable than that, and I’ve known you for years,” Peggy told him gently, wiping the streaked mascara off her bottom lashes and using the other hand to pat his cheek.
Tony’s forehead wrinkled. It seemed like a bit of reach to him, in that moment. “Okay, maybe you’ve got a point with the movies,” he said, “but… but the rest, it’s just… it’s just lighthearted. No one is making fun of you, Steve. And they… people dress up as all sorts. Cats and cops and nurses and stuff. It’s not always…”
“I’ve always hated Zeke,” Sam muttered, wiping his bloody nose on his sleeve, “felt good to put him on the ground.”
“With all due respect, sir, shut the fuck up,” Steve snapped at him angrily, forgetting where he was and who he was talking to for a second. Beside him, Tony just sighed, and when Steve looked at his headteacher, the man’s single eye looked ready to pop out of his head.
, do you really think I’d…” He broke off, looking more than a little heartbroken, and Steve suddenly realised how bad that must have sounded to Tony, who was always so worried about Steve thinking the worst of him. If, somewhere along the line, Steve
“Yeah. Well, my employer said they had reason to believe that there was shady business going on in there, and wanted me to see if I could find anything. I was only supposed to tail one of the higher-ups for a little, see if he was up to something. But… but the deeper I got, the more I had to know. By the end of the month I was tailing a dozen different guys, tapping phone calls—then I broke in.”
“How are you… how are you feeling,” Steve asked, his voice hoarse. He refused to acknowledge what Tony had said. None of this, here, was about how he was feeling. It was about Tony. “Are you. Are you doing okay?”
He blinked, feeling that familiar hand as it settled on his shoulder. Fuck, he was awake. Or was he? He couldn’t tell. His face was wet. Crying.
“I’m getting a strange sense of Déjà vu here,” Tony said, unlatching his helmet and then turning around to raise an eyebrow, “are you going to need help getting out of your helmet again?”
He and Tony were a fluid power, fighting and communicating and battling as one. Natasha and Clint still spent most of their time at SHIELD base, and Thor tended to gallivant wherever he pleased, but seeing as Steve had ended up shacking up in the Avengers Tower, Bruce had ended up following suit a few months later, and the Tower had quickly become their base of operations.
“No, he isn’t.” Tony stood up off the couch and leaned over to the coffee table, grabbing his phone. Steve realised he’d changed clothes since he’d last seen him; now he was in something comfier and less bloody, which was nice. Steve watched him curiously as he flicked through his contacts and then lifted the phone to his ear, wincing as he did so. His shoulder was obviously still sore.
“I… great!” Steve couldn’t help the tint of excitement that leaked out of his words, and he grinned, “my place, just turn up whenever. We’re not doing much- just movies and pizza and knowing Clint and Natasha, probably alcohol. There’ll be a few people there. It’ll be good. You’ll- I think you’ll like them all, they’re nice people, I swear! Bucky too, he’s sweet, I promise, you just have to warm up to him,” Steve slid off the bike, barely holding back an excited little bounce of his feet as he walked backward toward his house.
In his sleepy haze, Tony instinctively rose up and pressed his face against Steve’s palm, a half-smile forming across his mouth as he hummed happily. Steve’s stomach twisted- and it was almost funny, the fact that Tony could still give him butterflies, all these years in.
Tony snapped his head back to the pair in surprise, watching as Clint’s face contorted into one of delight and he punched the air triumphantly. Peter was smiling up at Bruce and clapping his hands together as best he could while Bruce nodded and confirmed, in his usual manner, “Yes, that’s me, Bruce Banner at your service.”
“I’ll do it,” Steve promised fiercely, gripping Tony’s waist and rocking them back and forth, “I swear I’ll make it up, and I’ll book us a whole week away if you want, to make up for our anniversary- we can get the best hotel you want, have a candle-lit meal and everything, and then I’ll take you back to our room and lay you on the silk sheets and-”
It appeared to do the trick, because the man laughed and then walked forward again, hands coming up to the glass as he breathed onto it.
“How did you and Thor become friends, then?” Steve cut off his rambling with a question, fingers curling around Tony’s hand and wiping at the insistent patch of grease with a gentle touch.
She raised her eyebrows to that. “Oh, and you’re one to talk about people being pretty damned obvious with their feelings, are you?” She asked wryly. When Steve simply gave her a blank look, she just sighed. “One day you’ll take your head out of your ass, Steven. On a completely unrelated note- I’d just like to say thank you.”
He was sweet, smart, funny - he liked to tease Tony, which never failed to leave them both laughing at the end - and he was talented. He could draw schematics like an expert, and he clearly had skills in design. The bike was a testament to that: Steve making modifications that had Tony impressed, planning them out in intricate detail. Tony had found him more than once brushing a hand over the bike’s frame, telling it how well it was going to do and how it was going to zoom down the streets so fast that Steve would feel like he was flying.
“No sir,” Jarvis replied from the bed, stretching his back in a long arch, his claws digging into the duvet to hold him in place. “You’ve been packed for a month. I hardly think anything would’ve moved.”
“Pfffft, Stíofán,” the first voice said, and Stíofán could recognise it now as Tiberius. The other Buck had been making comments often, whenever he thought Stíofán was out of earshot about how unfair it was that he’d been the one to win Tony, how if anyone deserved it was him. He spent a lot of time looking at the doe during meal times too, but so far it had been envy, nothing more overt. Until now it would seem.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “If I didn’t know any better I’d say you’re just trying to see me naked.”
“Don’t be. I liked it. I liked it a lot.” Tony gave Steve a wink. “I just think I’d like it better if next time we did it somewhere a little more private.”
Panic forgotten for a moment, Tony poked his head around the corner, looking at the man who had served him bent over to inspect a large oven, while another guy stood by looking stressed and holding a tray of unbaked dough.
His face was hot with shame, and he twisted the end of his tunic in his hands. “I -” His eyes burned and suddenly he couldn’t be standing here, in front of this man. “Please excuse me.” It came out near a sob, but he didn’t wait to see the alpha’s reaction. He took off to the bedroom, closing the door tight behind him.
Tony recited his order, and when he was told the total, reached into the pocket of his robe for his money. All his fingers brushed up against was the inside of his robe. He frowned, digging more desperately. He switched pockets, checked his jeans and dug through his bag. Then he froze. The hand on his robe during the chase. Fuck, his wallet must’ve fallen free. Oh god. He had no money.
The kids nodded, Hugh in particular looking interested at the prospect of someone new in the village. “So tomorrow, will you be good for your nana while I help with the building and your Ma works with Rhodey?”
Steve flushed. “No! Not like that — just I would see you sometimes. That’s all.” He looked away awkwardly, and Tony felt an answering flush on his cheeks.
Looking at the two other alphas alongside him, Hodge visibly made a decision, and Tony’s heart was in his throat as the man released the omega and reached for the pistol on his hip. His arm came up, the gun readying to put a hole in Tony’s husband when suddenly Steve’s arm whipped into the basket, and there was a dark dust explosion, which sent Hodge into a flurry of coughs. The two omegas got clear, moving to a safe distance. Steve wrenched the pistol from his grip and pointed it at the now grubby trio who were still spluttering heavily.
“World’s largest ant colony,” Luis said, his chest puffing with pride. “My friend Scott made them a little city to live in. It’s rad.”
“You have to know the cops know something’s wrong by now. You’d be better off getting out before they charge in here and arrest you and your flunkies.”
“Hello, I’ve heard a lot about you,” he told her, accepting the hug when it was given and inviting her to place her hands on his belly, a pleased smile on his face.
He got up, stripping to his skin and hiding his gown away out of sight. He slipped back under the bedding, pulling it over himself so no skin below his neck could be seen. Then he waited.
But when he tried to make his excuses, Tony simply nudged him towards a chair, telling him to hang around, and he put Jemison in his lap to hold him in place. He spent a nice afternoon in the quiet bookshop, perusing the books that were piled near him and listening to Tony talk to suppliers and customers. The waitress from next door, Darcy he found out, kept bringing him ever more complicated drinks, smiling when Tony whined at the lack of special treatment for him.
Tony stormed over as the worry and panic melted away leaving only anger, reaching out to tap the man on the shoulder with slightly too much force.
After dinner, Ana tried to get him to stay but he politely declined. He needed to be back on the road. Ana hugged him and told him to visit again and Edwin walked him out, giving him a little pack of leftovers he hadn’t seen the older man put together but was grateful for.
J.J stepped out of the way, just in time to dodge Dad sweeping her up and clutching at her like she might disappear.
He felt the raw panic swell in his chest like a bubble, pushing tight against his ribs. No, that wasn’t going to happen. Not to his child.
, so you must be awfully busy.” Tony felt his blood freeze. They could tell that?? Had everyone been talking about how he’d been failing his alpha in his most basic duty?
“That. Was. Amazing.” Tony breathed, and Steve smiled hopefully. “You just saved that girl. With a peanut!”
Steve mounted it excitedly, revving the engine. “She’s purring like a cat, so smooth.” Jarvis meowed from the stairwell, and Steve laughed. “Well, like a Jarvis I guess.”
“Wow,” he breathed. The walls were covered in pictures of fighter jets and sketches, as well as bits and pieces that were clearly prototypes. Whoever used this shed, and Tony was starting to suspect he knew exactly who, had spent a lot of time studying planes and sketching out plans for their own one.
As Tony put the mugs in the sink he let himself imagine what it would be like to have Steve there all the time. Someone to help with Peter, keep him safe, long dog walks in the park, cozy nights on the couch together with Tony tinkering and Steve sketching, family breakfasts on Sundays, and a warm body in Tony’s bed and a chest to rest his head on.
They’d ended up tucked into a corner after, Tony pointing out a few people of interest and telling Steve all the best and most salacious gossip, sending the man into bouts of laughter.
Stíofán turned to face the obstacles before him. A wide pit of snakes, their hissing rising like a cloud of noise. The six
He had finished his meeting and walked out onto the street, deciding to take in some air before returning to his horse. As he wandered past, he caught sight of Mr Rogers sitting on a bench near the churchyard. Thinking he might say hello, or perhaps offer to escort him home, he made to walk over but as he approached, someone else appeared, stopping him in his tracks.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief, carrying his items to the counter and trying to control the red in his cheeks. No way the shop owner didn’t hear them carrying on.
“If you think that just because he’s your mate he can do what he wants, then you’ve got another thing coming! You don’t want to seem unfair, do you, Sheriff?”
When he returned, he found the kids had come in from play and were curled up next to the doe. They’d obviously realised he was unwell, as their usual excited chatter was absent.
“Because you outstrip everyone in your class in the first 6 months and he’s so impressed he just has to meet you,” Dad cried, throwing his hands in the air.  The
“I want us to mate,” Tony told him, trying to keep his voice low and intimate, but making sure he couldn’t be misunderstood. “I want you inside me.”
“Did he touch you?” Steve asked worriedly, even though his omega had apparently hogtied one of the most dangerous men in the territory.
He saw Mr Barton step forward. “I got one of my draught horses here, Mr Rogers. I’ll go fetch him and the rope if someone will grab the other items.” He looked at the crowd expectantly. “I’m sure someone will volunteer.”
“Some people think everyone should have options,” Steve said evenly. He could already feel his hackles rising, and the last thing he wanted to do was make a scene. Tony had been very clear that events like these were important, not just for charity but for the goodwill and publicity it bought the team.
Sure, the advice he’d gotten from the older omegas in town was that it took time and that not conceiving during the first couple of heats was perfectly normal. But it felt like it should’ve happened. They'd been trying - boy had they been trying. He would confidently say he and Steve were easily the most enthusiastic couple in the town.
Tony fell into bed that night, face buried in the pillow that still smelled faintly of Steve’s heady cologne.
“Oi, Aengus, quit thinking with your cock and come watch your spawn. They’ll be digging up the wheat next.”
He stepped forward, planning to take it out on Hodge, but Tony put a hand to his chest. “Leave him. He’s tied up and he can face the judge.”
Steve shook his head. “No. Bucky needed help, it didn’t feel right to leave him. I, uh— I’m an artist now, properly I mean. I haven’t made it big yet but I’m getting pieces displayed in some of the better galleries, doing some commercial work on the side. Just like you said I should.”
His mind worked fast thanks to the serum, taking in the lower half of someone beneath a car, the straining jack beneath the frame close to breaking. He hit the brakes with a screech, off his bike and by the car parked in the driveway just in time to take the weight of it as the jack gave way.
He’d trailed to bed when Steve had suggested it, letting the alpha handle the last of the chores, though he couldn’t think of sleep now. He wanted it. He wanted those big hands on him, holding him in their strong grip, but so careful and caring at the same time. He felt the ache between his legs as he imagined it, imagined Steve taking him, pushing inside him, and making him feel as good as it had that first time.
That voice. Tony could bathe in that deep, smooth rumble. God, he clearly needed to get out and date more if this was his reaction to some hot guy.
“I appreciate you throwing me under the carriage, Mr Rogers,” Sam said cheekily, giving Steve a look that said he wasn’t buying it for a second.
He caught Steve rolling his eyes but offering his arm nonetheless, and as he took it, he propelled them forward, making his way over to the group of omegas chatting on the corner. When he reached them, he fanned a little harder. “Good afternoon.”
“Prepare for arrival!” The door to the carriage banged open as the guard walked down the aisle. The alpha’s hand snapped away. “We’ll be arriving in Brooklyn Junction in ten minutes. Please prepare for arrival.” The train’s whistle blew, punctuating his point, and the other passengers started to shuffle as they repacked any loose items.
Steve laughed and settled back on him, one hand drifting down to line them up before he pushed in with a slow, tantalising thrust.
“Even better,” he grinned. “This might be my first almost proposal, but I understand they often come with a show of one’s affection,” his expression turning sly.
“Oh, ha, no it’s the first time we’ve hung out here. My buddy and I, that’s him there, actually, no ignore him, he’s a dork who still thinks finger guns are cool. We’re celebrating, thought we’d try this place since it’s got cheap beer.”
John grinned, starting another story, and Tony inexplicably sat on the arm of Steve’s chair sliding until he was braced against Steve’s shoulder. Steve could feel him up along his arm, and he felt the urge to wrap an arm around his waist and tug him onto his lap. He managed to curb the instinct, his fingers twitching against the armchair. Instead he just let himself enjoy it, Tony so close to him, while the gentle ramble of John’s voice filled the air.
Tony was in a pretty good mood as he carried the coffee and snacks towards the conference room, humming to himself as he went. He pulled out his phone to check his emails, so he was distracted as he neared the elevators, trying to read through the latest report on the arc reactor project.
“Here, let me--” He brushed it away, watching the heat rise in Steve’s cheeks again. “You ah, go red a lot huh?”
“You see? They won’t dare try again for a while. But I believe that moves my timetable up. You tell me how to access the plans and schematics for the latest Stark weapons now, or I’ll start shooting.” The look on his face told Tony the negotiation period was over.
And I will find your mother and she will welcome me with open arms and the kid and I will live in paradise for the rest of our lives and eat only milk and honey, yes.”
“Good. Now, I’d better clean you off. You got heated in the night.” Tony kept his tone even. He wouldn't blush. This was an essential task, nothing more.
“I didn’t do nothing. It’s that damn horse of yours!” The man said to Wilson, looking angry. “She bucked me off.”
Steve shook his head. “You already are. Even if we could never do this again, you’re the sweetest, stubbornest, smartest, toughest, most beautiful omega I could ever ask for, and you light up my life just by being here. I love you more than anything.”
It was quick and perfunctory, despite the town clerk spending the first few minutes elbowing the Sheriff in the side in glee, and the local preacher being called in to conduct the ceremony.
Curious, Tony thought. He dressed, pulling on his robes and styling his hair, before heading down the stairs and into the big house. He was enveloped by the familiar smell of freshly baked bread and sugar as he stepped inside, trailing through to the sitting room before coming to a stop.
“Papa!” a little tired voice called, and Steve felt his chest fill with something he couldn’t describe. Peter was sitting up against a few pillows, a smile on his face, and Steve took a seat next to Tony, taking the pup’s hand when he reached for him.
Peter nodded but looked longingly at Dodger. Tony felt a little bad, but-- “Come on, we’ve taken enough of Steve’s time.” He had a sudden thought. “Oh god, I hope you didn’t have anything to do! I’m sure you weren’t expecting to spend half an hour with a random kid.”
“Cops are coming,” Rhodey said, coming over and resting a hand on Tony’s shoulder. He looked at Steve.
All hell broke loose, the gang going for him and Rogers swinging desperately. Tony couldn’t do nothing — the guy would get beaten to a pulp. “Hey! Quit it!”
“I wish I could believe that. I really, really do,” Tony said, looking at him, his chest feeling sore. “Only, last Monday you told me you were in Washington, and Pepper saw you downtown. You were talking to some redhead. She was sure of the day too, because it was the same day the Avengers fought that sea monster thing, and she got stuck in traffic. So, I guess the redhead was just some client too then?”
Strange. Vulcan and human couples were not common, but they were not unheard of. S’Teve’s own mother was human, living happily on Vulcan with his father. Theirs had been a diplomatic arrangement at first, though his mother assured him it had become love over time.
“Well now,” the Sheriff said, looking smug. “Looks like yours is the most popular dish at the table. Supper’s only just started and it’s all gone. Thank goodness I get access to all that fine cooking at home.”
“Your call,” the man said, and with barely any effort at all, he flicked the man sideways, sending him careening out the broken window, the guard screaming as he plummeted.
The rest of the afternoon was somewhat of a blur. Tony ended up in the restaurant drinking coffee and exchanging notes. Miss Foster was very knowledgeable, and Miss Lewis was still learning but contributed plenty. She also had read several of the novels he and Steve had finished, and so offered a lively conversation about the authors.
“And on a scale of one to ten, how successful do you think it was?” He wandered forward, eyes straight back to where they had been five minutes ago- on Steve.
Slumping onto his bed with a sigh, he pulled off his jacket and slung it carelessly into the corner of the room, toeing off his shoes and then hauling them onto the bed heavily. He knew that he wasn’t… he didn’t care about being rich or whatever, but he just wished that sometimes he had enough money to at least
Bruce said nothing. He was as lost as Steve. He asked a few short questions while Steve stroked his hand across Tony’s chest, but that was as much time as Steve could spare. For now, he had to get his other friends back into the relative safety of the cabin.
Tony whined in dismay as Steve let him go, and let himself sink back into the pillows to watch Steve as he lifted his hand and opened up his palm, dragging the chain he was holding around Tony’s neck and then letting it fall- landing right on the centre of the arc reactor.
But Steve shook his head rapidly. "No, no, we can't do that. You wriggle in your sleep, and I'm heavy. We could accidentally... squish it."
Peter grasped a little tighter at his Pops’ shirt and in return, his Pops gave him a gentle kiss on his hair. “You… you mean that?”
“This isn’t your fault either,” Steve murmured, “this is because your dad is a piece of shit on legs.”
He froze where he stood, watching the last person exit the room until he was stood rigid in the empty kitchen. The fear was starting to crawl up his throat as he became aware of the real consequences of all this- Iron Man was what had gotten him into the team in the first place, what everyone had been drawn to. That was the real asset, The Avengers’ heavy hitter, their aerial support. Without Iron Man, it wouldn’t take long for them all to come to the realisation that Tony himself didn’t have much to offer.
Steve froze against the sink, toothbrush halfway to the rack as he turned his gaze on Tony. “I told you to shut up about that,” he said, demeanour totally changing from the relaxed way he’d been talking to Tony just five minutes ago.
“I don’t belong here,” he murmured, “this isn’t my world any more. If I go back now, I will fix everything. But as things are… well. The world can’t live without him.”
“You won’t,” Steve promised, “I’ll come straight back. Tony, if we can get the stones… if we can grab that gauntlet, then there could be a chance that we can bring everyone back. There could be hope.”
“Uh,” his mouth came out with, looking down at his hands curiously. The sketch of Tony grinned back up at him; hands mid-motion and hair scraped back from the memory of fingers that had flattened it down seconds previously.
One shake of the head. Tony shrugged. “Don’t worry- just hold on and enjoy the ride, sweetheart. I won’t crash, scout's honor.”
He wondered what was going to happen to him when he finally made their tempers break. When they finally got sick of his shit.
But his hand stopped an inch away from the button, and he sighed as his brain immediately made the connection. “Susan.”
Bucky raised his hands, stepping back slightly. “I promise I’ll do my very best to try wind my neck in in future.”
a gentleman,” he said, taking the outstretched hand. Steve didn’t seem fazed by the teasing, however- just smiled at him and then pulled them over to the elevator.
things again, rather than just go through the motions. And he’d… and there was Tony. He’d found Tony, somehow, and that was… more than he could ever have hoped he would get, really.
Steve looked down at him, fondness and worry and love and concern all warring in his head as he continued to stroke through Tony’s hair. When he looked up, he saw Bucky watching them, the same sort of concern mirrored on his face. “He alright?” He asked quietly, careful not to disturb the sleeping boy, “he was really tense when he came in. You two talked it out, right?”
Steve’s heartbeat was its own sub-division of drug. Fast-acting, calming, an easy way to numb all the panic. And it didn’t cause him liver failure if he took too much of it, which was a nice plus.
Again, he got a vague shrug. Tony took another lick of his icecream. “Howar- my Dad’s leaving for work tonight, so I’ll go back then. It’s no big deal.”
And of course, every time, Tony rejoiced in setting fire to the letter they all signed and sent to him, and then going out on a very public date with Steve the next day. He really did wonder why they still bothered.
When they arrived up in the kitchen, they got a variety of cheers and ‘The Geniuses Return!’. Of course, Tony got his ‘your face looks like it got hit by a truck’ comments too, but he quickly passed them off with the same excuse he’d given Bruce, and soon it was forgotten in favour of dinner. Steve arrived back home about half-way through, and although his face looked pinched, he still smiled at them all and then kissed Tony on the forehead as he passed to get his plate from the side. Tony smiled with his good side and didn’t think about why there was now a good and a bad side to his face. Didn’t matter.
His friend just looked at him worriedly, but ultimately he respected Steve’s wishes as the boy trudged up the stairs, glancing down at his ugly second-hand shoes as he went.
Again, Tony was quiet, save for his antsy shuffling. Steve watched him worry at his bottom lip and twist his wedding ring around and around his finger, deep in thought. “What do we tell Maria?” He said eventually, “how are we supposed to just… ‘hey sugarplum, Daddy and Pops are going on a trip for a little while, and we might not—we might not make it back, but—”
“I am,” Steve nodded slowly, a small smile on his face as he looked up at his best friend, “I promise.”
Steve felt his face crease up as he took in that information. That was… absurd. HYDRA couldn’t have grown within SHIELD—there was no way they would have been able to do that under the radar. Fury had an iron grip on the whole organisation, and Steve knew without a doubt that that man would never be one of HYDRA. Rumlow, possibly- but just because he was an asshole didn’t necessarily mean he was capable of following HYDRA ideology, come on.
“You’re in hospital in New York,” Bruce pushed along, obviously sensing Steve wasn’t going to answer him, “you were temporarily taken hostage by HYDRA, during which they attempted to do some sort of mind-alteration that was similar to that of Bucky’s. It reacted badly with you, though, and you broke free, dealt with your kidnappers—”
Tony harrumphed and folded his arms. “Yeah, unlikely,” he muttered, sharing a look with Steve. Steve just smiled at him and shook his head fondly, eyeing up Thor as he tipped the entire box of cereal into his mouth, creating a mountain big enough that the God could hardly even get his lips around it. “Thor, why are you even eating cereal at 4 in the afternoon?”
Walking into school the next day wearing the marks of his earlier confrontation sure earned him a few concerned stares. He was pretty certain his face was a little more purple than what most considered normal, and although Nat had done her hardest to cover it with makeup, the discoloration still showed through obviously. He didn’t care much; he’d dealt with it enough before- but he ducked his head down and tried to avoid the curious eyes anyway. He didn’t exactly fancy trying to explain that he’d had his ass handed to him by a bunch of strangers wanting money.
it didn’t mean anything. He knew it- it wasn’t even a big fucking deal, and yet here he was, undoubtedly fucking blushing for the eight millionth time-
“Tony?” Steve asked curiously, and Tony’s heart plunged right down through the floor as he watched the other man step out, “what are you... wait, why do you have a suitcase?”
Rocket laughed, loud and raucous, and then leaped off the top of the mound of rubble to join back into the fray. Not long after, Steve followed.
Hell, what was Steve even thinking? The rest of the team were probably going to be just as bad. It was going to be a nightmare.
The group was fairly small- only Ty, Zeke and two others that Steve didn’t know the name of and didn’t care for either. But the rest of the kids who were loitering in the halls still smelt the potential for an altercation anyway, because suddenly everything seemed to get a bit quiet, and eyes began to turn in their direction. Steve, for the record, didn’t look away from Ty.
They arrived back home three minutes and fourteen seconds later, and Steve was already opening the door for Tony before he’d even undone his seatbelt, offering his hand once more. Tony couldn’t help but laugh, rolling his eyes a little. “Why, Captain Rogers, you’re
so fucking easily, and all it takes, clearly, is a little bit of mind-whammying and I’m gone! You shouldn’t… I just don’t understand how you could trust me. I’m a killing machine, Tony. Look what I did to all those soldiers in the facility. What I almost did to you.” His voice ran dry and cracked down the middle, and he held Tony’s gaze as the man just looked down at him, eyes intense, filled with so much that Steve hardly even knew where to begin trying to unravel it all.
“Ah,” Peggy said, “that’s not good.” She paused, and then added, “you want me to go and smack Bucky across the back of the head again?”
Scrambling off the bed and grabbing the first shirt he could find- Steve’s, it turned out- Tony walked over to him, wringing his hands together. “So,” he started, “I may have started a website concerning bringing awareness to Unhuman life and culture after you’d left earlier. Cool name, I’m calling it Project BADAUSS- Baseline Allyship and Defence Against Unhuman Social Stigma, although I might change the name. Is it too long? I feel like it’s too long. Anyway, it was – It was a spur of the moment thing, but I just… there’s not enough information out there, Steve. We as Baseliners are choosing to be ignorant of shit that affects you every day, and it’s not right, and I want to change that. And not just in a… not just because I’m your boyfriend, but because someone needs to. And I know what I’m doing. I know who to talk to, where to spread the message. I want this to be a useful resource to anyone even remotely curious, and I want it to be the one thing on the internet that isn’t fucking filled with anti-Unhuman rhetoric, and…” Tony trailed off, looking at Steve’s face to try and gauge a reaction from the other man. But he was just getting a vacant stare, like Steve didn’t know what to do with himself.
“I’ll ask Tony to reimburse you when I find him,” Steve said with a tight smile, rolling his shoulders and holding back a wince. Thor’s eyes narrowed slightly, but Steve turned away and started walking in the direction of where he’d last seen the others heading, before they’d become shrouded in snow and forest. “Go get us some help. Call JARVIS when you can, get him to send a drone down, deep-scan the mountain. We’ll find him.”
He paused in his steps for a moment, stumbling over his feet as he caught sight of a group of kids- few years older than him, college, maybe- hanging by a parking lot in front of him. He knew instantly that they weren’t any good. Years of practice had given him a pretty decent indicator of threats like that.
She said it with conviction. If Tony didn’t know her so well, he’d think she believed what she was saying.
That was the crux of it. That was why people got violent with him. They couldn’t handle him, because he was loud and abrasive and rude and just took everyone’s love without ever giving jack shit back. No wonder so many relationships he’d been in had gotten violent.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8… on and on and on, the steady thrum of a pulse against Tony’s ear. He’d started sleeping against Steve’s chest after that whole fiasco with the cardiac arrest, and the constant pulse was like a lullaby, helping him drift off with the knowledge Steve was safe. He was okay.
And I get if you’re mad at me, but when I’m with you it’s like everything else in my brain shuts off and I don’t have to worry anymore, because you’re warm and you smell nice and- yeah. Sorry, sorr-”
Tony slumped. He hadn’t... God, he’d been so caught up worrying over himself that he hadn’t even stopped to think about that. Goddamn it, Steve.
He remembered the phone call he’d had just a few minutes ago, the words on a loop in his head. “Please,” Thor had said, voice quiet and
“I understand,” Tony told him with a small smile, “I...I think my mom would have liked you a lot too, Steve.”
The table fell silent again. The atmosphere was heavy and bleak, all of them thinking about their friend back in Thor’s apartment, his future rapidly becoming bleaker and bleaker as time went on. Clint proposed that they all go over there to visit, and everyone quickly agreed to it, all of them wanting to show some sort of solidarity. Steve loved them for that. He was tired and angry and helpless, but seeing the unwavering kindness and loyalty of all his friends in action still managed to get a little smile on his face, and he left for next period with that slightest feeling of relief still on his mind.
He’d never thought of it like that. Never even considered, for a second, that Steve’s grumpiness was anything other than surface-level irritation that could be changed with some well-placed chocolates and pumpkin-themed socks.
, Peggy," Steve rolled his eyes, "and I do... well, I mean I try to post pictures of him. He just doesn't like them- says he looks bad, and I'm not gonna post them if he doesn't want them up. Obviously."
“I’m gonna miss my flight,” Tony whined, looking up at him with an attempted glare. It didn’t really work. He looked far too cute, with his nose and cheeks both pink from the freezing cold and his wool coat zipped up all the way to his mouth, shrouding him in fabric. He extracted Steve’s arms from around his waist with leather-gloved hands and took a step back, wrinkling up his face when he was subsequently exposed to the harsh wind. “God, why do you have to be so irritatingly warm?”
He floated, for a few happy seconds, in a place where nothing was burning. Where his world was a calm gentle ocean, and he was sat next to Tony, Maria on his lap. He smiled at both of them, and tried to remember what it was that he was missing.
He thought Steve might look at him a little strangely for that admission, but the man just sighed in relief and stood up, nodding. “Me too,” he whispered, “God, come on. JARVIS, pack up in here for us, will you?”
Steve stumbled forward, and he still had to get popcorn, yes, but he felt that was not a priority at that moment as he reached for Tony’s arm. “Simple misunderstanding, Tony. It’s fine.” He looked around the room, before nodding over the TV. “Now who the fuck paused Die Hard? Turn it back on and drink your mead, guys.”
for you, you must know that,” he said dramatically, lifting a hand to his forehead while he fell back and pretended to swoon. Steve, of course, simply caught him with a roll of his eyes.
Steve quietly informed Tony it was ready, and Tony looked back up. Steve appeared to have gone to all the effort of dragging the couch around the room in order to put it on Tony's side, as opposed to the much closer side that belonged to Steve. He didn't mention it, though. Just nodded and then walked over in the darkness, very gently placing the child down against the soft pillows of the couch. He winced when the little boy's hands twitched and his face stirred, but luckily he didn't wake up. Tony sighed in relief, slipping his hands away. As he did so, the blankets that had previously been swaddling him slipped away, exposing the child's little sleep-suit and a yellow stickynote that had been placed over his chest. Tony frowned, plucking it off.
honest with himself—he wasn’t even sure whether he’d ever quite stopped loving Tony in the first place. He’d crushed it down, pushed it away, but looking at him now, everything just came right back. Every feeling, every butterfly. He couldn’t stop it. No matter how much he looked at Tony and hated who had become, he still… he still-)
Not even a second later, Steve heard the door fly open. He had the good sense to roll under the bed as quietly as he could, holding his breath and feeling uncharacteristically afraid. He wasn’t sure why- Howard Stark was a pretty scary man, and he looked like he packed a punch, but he also had no idea Steve even existed at that point, so there was no need to try and stop his breath hitching. Maybe it was because of the way Tony acted around him- the fearless boy, the daredevil, the best fighter Steve knew- scared shitless of the guy Steve was in the same room with. It was a daunting thought.
Steve just looked at him with his big blue eyes, an indiscernible emotion there. Tony watched his fingers flex by his side, like he was resisting the urge to raise them. He settled for a smile instead. “Don’t overstretch yourself,” he said, “just… let your brain work itself out on its own, kay? Give yourself a well-earned break.”
Tony ran anxious fingers through his hair. “Didn’t want to wake you either,” he mumbled, “figured I’d go up and just… check whether or not you were awake? It made sense at the time.”
Tony caught him just as he was about to turn the corner, and this time when he said his name, it was more a breathless yell with the starting sound of an ‘S’, due to the fact Tony had begun sprinting the length of the corridor in order to catch up with him. Steve turned, looking at him in mild terror as Tony careered forward, shoes leaving little bits of mashed potato as he went. “Tony, what are you-”
The chair scraped across the floor as Tony stood up once more, making his way over to the couch where Steve was lying. “Oh, I wouldn’t dare,” he responded with a fond roll of his eyes, “Steve Rogers’ word is law, after all.”
Steve climbed clumsily onto the back seat, still feeling a little dizzy from the mix of alcohol and nerves. He really hoped he didn’t fall off. That would suck. “How long for?” He asked through the helmet, hands going around the grab rail in front of him.
He realised his desk was still turned around, facing the workshop entrance instead of the opposing wall. He doesn’t remember when he did that- at some point after Steve had walked in and punched him, maybe. He should turn it back around.
The tubes were stark white, but the harsh light threw up a faint shadow within them- one that seemed worryingly human-esque. Steve continued to move forward, checking for threats as he went along. The silhouettes weren’t moving much- seemingly hovering, but Steve couldn’t be sure.
Steve’s head jerked as his brain recognised the voice immediately, and he watched as none other than Tony Stark himself marched forward, coming up behind the two guys currently doing their best to fit Steve into the locker. A strong hand curled around the first guy’s shoulders, and then Steve felt a sharp relief of pressure as Tony flung him off Steve and into the opposing wall. The second one backed off in surprise, putting out his hands as a show of peace.
Above him, Steve paused for a few seconds, and then lifted his head, a beautiful smile on his face as he said “hold on. I’ve got something that’ll make it even better. Stay here.”
Steve lurched up, looking at Bruce with wide, humiliated eyes. “Sorry,” he choked, “I shouldn’t be here, I just… I wanted to see him so, so badly but I
He expected to have to argue or possibly bribe the insatiable girl, but instead she just nodded sagely, squeezing his arm. “My lips are sealed. I want you two to get together too bad to try and ruin anything.”
“Hey, don’t slam on your own kind, Steve, not everyone likes to cradle rob like you do.” Tony batted his eyelashes and waved to himself, and then they were off again, this time bickering about who was technically the cradle robber and who was the cradle robbed. They must have gone through this conversation a hundred times, yet they never got the definitive answer. Personally, Tony didn’t care—he just enjoyed watching Captain America wave his hands around and try to describe the logistics behind him being more fitted to the role of sugar baby in their relationship rather than cradle-robber.
Tony caught his eye as he made his way calmly down the corridor, and his face lit up at the sight of him; stepping out of Heather Whateverthefuck’s way to instinctively move toward him. Steve couldn’t help but crow a little bit over that- point 1 to Steve.
“Sweetheart,” Steve’s tone changed- no longer scared and panicked, but soothing. Gentle. He wasn’t far away any more, he was in the room with Tony.  “Sweetheart, it’s alright. You’re completely safe.”
Nodding thankfully, Steve hurried forward and grabbed the pass before speeding out of the room and heading down the corridor. He reached the corner and turned, feet making an obnoxiously loud noise as they scraped against the dirty white tiles.
All he wanted was for things to go back to the way they’d been before, but his body wasn’t seeming to get the fucking memo. He kept…
Steve blinked, taking a moment to process the sharp turn of events. Before he could sink into it, though, Tony broke away quickly, fingers trailing up Steve’s neck and then cupping his jaw between both his hands.
Thor just made a face and then waved his hand, “it was my pleasure, Steve,” he said earnestly, “and you- well, you listened to me moan more than I listened to you. Sorry about that.”
Steve turned his head, looking at him drily. “I think it would’ve been more along the lines of ‘hold onto that one, Stevie, you idiot. He’s the real deal.”
Anyway. He had other people too, which was where he was headed right then, actually. Thor had invited Steve and all his friends over for the night, and everyone was going. Natasha would probably be sulky for most of it, seeing as her boyfriend wasn’t going to be available to engage in any heavy petting with her, but Steve didn’t doubt she’d get over it.
“You know, I would not ever say this unless I was incredibly monumentally drunk,” Clint declared as he watched the two of them from his position on the floor, “but man, I wish I had a relationship as sickening and disgusting as yours.”
They went to bed that night, and Tony pondered bringing it up to him. They’d never talked about marriage before, per se, but it had always just been somewhat unspoken. They talked as if they would stay with one another forever. Steve called Tony his ‘sure thing’ in that unbearable Brooklyn accent that he teased Tony with when he wanted to be overly sappy and dumb. It wasn’t a big stretch to make, right?
Sparing one last glance behind him at the quickly-emptying corridor, he pursed his lips and then hiked his bag higher onto his shoulder, making his way over to class. He made a pointed effort not to think about Tony even once, for the rest of the hour- quite possibly focused harder on his history teacher than he had in about seven months. Tony Stark most certainly did not take up a portion of his thoughts. He didn’t mean that much to Steve. Seriously. He didn’t.
Tony quickly smoothed his face over and smiled, that horrible brittle one that made Steve want to argue relentlessly with him, just to bring out some semblance of an emotion on his face instead of that
He reached Sublevel 5 a few seconds later and opened up the heavy door as quietly as possible. When he stepped into the long metal corridor, more corpses came into view, and Tony took a minute to process the level of damage that had been done here. He often forgot just how much harm Steve was really capable of- how the soldier could see bullets as they flew past and decapitate people with a single punch. But here, in front of him, it was made startlingly clear.
Steve sighed and then lay his head back onto the cushion so that his gaze was on the ceiling. “Sappy things,” he admitted easily, before poking Tony in the underarms and huffing as Tony yelped and collapsed back onto his chest reflexively. He wondered what Tony would look like, away from all the glitz and the glamour of their New York lives. Whether he’d let his hair silver out a bit, whether he’d stop putting in contacts and start just wearing his glasses. Obviously though, whatever happened, he would still look just as beautiful, of that Steve had no doubt. Tony was incapable of
Steve watched him go, following after his brother with a disorientated stumble. Then he turned back to Tony. “How are you feeling?” He asked, cocking his head to the side and trying to shove everything else aside in order to just focus on Tony. “Little better?”
Steve opened his mouth, but then they both heard the door open quickly and the footsteps of someone running into the room, and both of them froze in their vent.
Zeke stepped forward again and Steve braced, absolutely fucking ready to punch the bastard’s lights out- but they both paused when someone yelled at them, and Steve let his eyes flicker to the source of the sound for a moment, and then a little more than a moment as he realised it was Tony who’d made the noise.
The other boy swallowed a little nervously, but he smiled. “Yeah,” he said, “I just… you know, I fucked up on the first time ‘round, yeah, but- I’m older now, and I’m going to have to go to college somewhere after this shitshow we call highschool is over, so I figured I might as well, you know? I don’t… I probably won’t get in, not when they have my records, but I know some of the professors and they kind of understood, at the time, why I was pulling the shit I was and-“ he broke off, taking a quick breath and then shrugging. When he looked back to Steve, there was something unquestionably grateful in his bright blue eyes. “You made me think I wasn’t quite such a failure,” he murmured, fingers brushing back Steve’s hair again, “that maybe I could… be who I am. Do what I actually enjoy. Or something.”
In the distance, he heard the revving of an engine, and for one glorious moment he thought it might be Tony’s bike. But the sound was too low, too heavy to be that of a motorcycle. It was some sort of sports car, by the sound of it.
“‘Kay,” Steve conceded contentedly, before flopping down across Tony once more and pillowing his head against Tony’s chest, “back to sleep now.”
Steve followed her out of the car, shutting the door quietly as he did so. “It’s not crime. We work here.”
It took Thor a moment, but then he took a sharp intake of a breath. “Ty?” He asked. Steve couldn’t help but grin darkly as he turned his head back to Thor.
to work, actually- except I’m being unfairly distracted by truanting menaces who won’t leave me alone.” He raised his eyebrows and then grabbed his pencil, waving it convincingly in Tony’s face.
The thought made him huff in the ghost of amusement, which in turn caused the driver to glance warily at him through the mirror. He supposed that was warranted. If he told anyone at SHIELD he had occasional conversations with the disembodied voice of his dead friend, he’d get a psych eval and then subsequently a firing, for sure. But that was just between him and said disembodied voice, wasn’t it? He wasn’t crazy, anyway. He just… knew what Peggy would think if she heard him, and sometimes put a voice to those thoughts.
His head jerked up, only then realising he’d curled it into his hands in the first place, and he took Tony in as the man leaned over him on the bed. He was panting a little, dishevelled and tired, and he was clutching two pots of jello in one hand while the other settled itself on Steve’s shoulder. It looked as if he’d run straight from the canteen, just like Bruce had said.
“Oh, fuck off,” Tony began, before pausing and then grabbing Bruce’s hand in order to add an extra inch to the distance, “
He shut his eyes and then told himself to stop his current train of thought. They’d had discussions about this before. Tony knew that it was just… it was just in his head. Mostly.
Tony looked at them, a little confused. They didn’t look much like the farming folk he’d seen come to town to deliver goods for market. Too bookish for farm labour. His confusion must’ve been clear because Miss Lewis laughed.
Steve huffed. “Well, I can’t blame you for liking Cap’s muscles I guess,” Steve said with a self-deprecating smile and Tony felt his heart clench.
“I’m awful at pool,” Steve replied, self-deprecatingly. “But if you don’t mind playing against a clumsy fella like me, I’m game.”
He brushed a hand over his tunic and put his handkerchief away. He checked the temperature of the stew in the pot with a careful hand before tucking the tea towel back into place.
Tony put him to work dusting the high shelves, and Steve was pleased to find he caught Tony watching him more than once.
He thrust his hips up making the doe groan. They moved together, the pleasure building as they shifted, the feeling in his belly pulling tighter and together. He knew what he wanted to hear.
“Right,” Stíofán offered, still feeling a little bewildered. “Maybe we could wrap your head in padding or something so you don’t keep knocking it on the floor.”
Steve picked up his bag and turned to Tony. “Course not. You’ve been so good to me, I can’t thank you enough.”
“Well let’s not get too carried away,” Tony grouched but underneath it, he sounded pleased. “I would’ve thought you’d want a break from the crying and being woken up at all hours.”
“Steve just has…a bit of a chip on his shoulder is all. He was always to do what we did, enlist and fly, but his health problems meant he couldn’t. So, he’s always been a bit? tetchy. A lot of the guys around here give him a tough time too, so he’s got a bit of a short fuse if he thinks someone’s picking on him. It’s not personal.”
“Mr Rogers! This art is amazing, you’re so talented!” Jan gushed, gesturing at the painting. “Surely yours should be the star of this show.”
“S’Teve, come on. I thought we were past this by now. We’re friends, or at least I thought we were.” He reached out to touch his shoulder, and S’Teve felt the flare of emotions coming from him. Worry, frustration, but beneath it, sadness? A tendril of hurt was winding through all of it, and it made S’Teve’s face twitch.
“You as well.” Tony’s smile was all teeth, and he reveled in the victory. “I was just walking my alpha to work, and I figured I’d let you know I’m planning to have afternoon tea at our home a week from tomorrow, and I’d love it if you’d join us.”
Tony shook his head. “I haven’t got the tools or equipment. Or the space really. I’m only just starting to get some decent money off my magic, and I can’t ask Rhodey and Sam to give up more space.”
“Shall we-” The sheriff shoved his hands in his pockets and averted his eyes awkwardly. At least Tony wasn’t the only one who was nervous.
It would not do, then, to show how it affected him, lest he ruin the enjoyment of the act for his alpha or make him think his new omega had passions beyond pleasing him or starting a family. Better to keep quiet. He buried his face in his alpha’s neck to hide away.
“Not a client, a guest. Come down. They’re in the sitting room.” Then he closed the window behind him.
Tony felt a rush of denial, not wanting to be separated from Steve. He wanted to protest, but he realised that the deputy had played him, gently shepherding him out to the street.
Tony made a note on his tablet with a smile. “Alright, how about you pull her out and I’ll take measurements?”
“Sure I do. You’re my best friend and a great guy. And somewhere the perfect person is just waiting for you to say the words they’ve been waiting their whole life to hear.”
“It can’t be that hard,” Tony sniffed. “You simply heat the right balance of metals, which you have to be careful with because some take longer to become liquid, you create moulds for the style you want---”
“Apologies, Captain, it seems one of the support pillars has -“ JARVIS voice fizzled out as the lightbulbs overhead popped and everything went dark around them.
Steve felt a nudge at his ankle and looked down to see a kitten currently trying to nibble his foot. “That doesn’t explain the cats.” He leaned down to pat her, but instead she leapt up and began to climb his arm. He winced as she clawed onto his shoulder, but melted when she started rubbing her cheek against his clavicle.
As she got closer, he could see the look on her face and he felt the bottom drop out of his stomach. “Nat?”
“Of course!” He answered way too loud. The job sounded easy enough. The man, a farmer named Mr Barton, had a tractor that was running poorly and he’d heard Tony could work wonders. “I am going to nail this. I swear. Your tractor is going to be the smoothest ride in the state. When would you like me to come?”
He flipped the shift up, revealing the plump cheeks Stíofán had known were hidden away and the bright fluffy tail that wagged as he looked his fill. Stíofán’s cock was throbbing as he felt below the tail for the hot, wet entrance he knew would be there. It was tight, virgin tight, but so slippery with slick, and he shoved two fingers in, enjoying the squeeze of the internal walls, as the doe clenched around them. He was big, he knew that, had seen plenty of the other satyrs when they trained and fought. It would be a lot to take. That thought made his cock twitch.
He tucked Tony into bed, tucking the furs around him and putting a hand on his forehead. “You don’t have a fever.”
“I’m perfectly capable of carrying it myself you know,” he told Steve, who hefted the groceries easily with one hand.
It was in desperate need of a clean, so Rhodey and Sam had offered him the couch for the first night. Tony barely had the time to appreciate the softness of the cushions before he had dropped off, sleeping soundly till the sun came up, the soft light flitting through the curtains.
Steve could feel the heat in his cheeks now, his permission apparently not needed, as he stared at the doorway Tony had disappeared through.
Thankfully Edwin chose that moment to return with dessert, and the awkward moment passed without further discussion, which Steve was grateful for. He tucked into his dessert, the taste instantly reminding him of sitting around a small table with Gabe, Bucky and Dum Dum, fighting over the extra custard and trying desperately not to spill food on the embroidered tablecloth of the nice yorkshire woman they were staying with, and whose manner suggested to Steve that ruining her things would lead to immediate eviction.
“How do you want to handle it?” Bucky asked in his ear as they got on their bellies to stay out of sight.
Tony was very intelligent for a human; he talked fast with his voice and his hands, and managed to get the ship out of danger on a regular basis.
“Three?” Steve’s face was adorably confused and Tony couldn’t help the smile that spread over his face as he drew Steve’s hand to his belly.
“If you like that sort of thing,” the third omega with short strawberry red hair and a pointed nose said, sounding unimpressed. “There were plenty of pretty blond omegas in this town, but instead he chose some tan, dark-haired minx from out East? Shocking.”
Emboldened by the wave of happiness he was feeling, he scooted over, lifting his leg to straddle the Sheriff’s waist, and leaned in to kiss him.
Steve snorted. “Go on, you. Get that sweet behind out of here before we really do scandalise the town.”
“Uh huh,” Steve teased. He expected Tony to clap him on the shoulder and take off, job done, but the alpha just sat there a moment, looking pensive.
He slid a tunic over his head and then he left, slipping out the door. He got a lot of jealous looks as he went, and he couldn’t help but puff out his chest. Obviously, they’d heard loud and clear that Antonius was his. He returned to the room, two hearty bowls of mash and more wine in his hands.
From what he could see, a man with dark hair seemed to be in charge, speaking into an earpiece on the other side of the room.
“I love you. I love our pup. I’ve got everything I need. Anything else is just the cherry on top. I don’t want you thinking that I’m not happy with what we have.”
Steve cleared his throat. “So um, can I convince you to come eat lunch with me, or do I have to start digging through my pockets for some cash?”
Free to finish, Stíofán gave a dozen more messy thrusts before he finished, curling around Tony and burying his face in the curls between his horns. When he had caught his breath, he pawed around for a rag, wiping them down and tossing it aside for washing. As he laid back, Tony curled up on his chest, tugging the furs to their shoulders.
“Maybe,” Stíofán agreed, though he didn’t offer anything more. It had become clear in his mind that there was no way he would leave Rome without Tony. He had fallen in love with a bright spark, and leaving him here to be extinguished was too horrible a thought to even be entertained. But he was still to discover a way to do so.
He pushed open the door, balancing the tray of coffees and pastries on one hand. “Sorry, I’m late, you know how it is, when your name is on the building, you stop caring about schedules.
Steve huffed. “I never understood why you wore them anyway. You’ve got a fine figure and seems to me to be more trouble than it’s worth. My ma never wears them: says ‘omegas were given lungs for breathing same as alphas, so why would anyone squeeze the life out of themselves?’.”
“Oh right,” the guy said, shoulders slumping. “I shouldn’t have done that. Just because I saved you doesn't mean I’m forgiven.”
How could he even be considered by a man like that? A poor constitution, low birth, and far too opinionated to be anything but a hindrance in Stark’s circle of acquaintances. Steve wouldn’t even have an education if the gentleman his mother worked for, Mr Erskine, hadn't taken a shine to him as a boy and paid for his schooling. Of course, Steve was sure Erskine’s plan was never that Steve fall in love with one of the wealthiest men in the county, and have his heart broken every time he remembered Mr Stark could never love him back.
He looked at her, then groaned softly as his leg flared up in pain. “You should’ve stuck to your guns ‘n gone to the Bahamas,” he muttered, remembering their conversation earlier that month.
“I don’t know what the fuck your problem is,” Steve hissed at Bucky, pushing him back again and feeling Bucky relent a little that time, “But it stops
Steve wished that his birthday didn't fall on the day of American Independence. There'd be far less fireworks if it didn't.
Tony frowned, watching Peppa Pig as she and her friend tried to learn how to whistle on the screen. "Is Steve around?" He asked, hearing their negative grunts this time.
sang- when he did, it was usually just humming old war songs or those abominable pop tunes that played nonstop on the radio. This- this was different. It sounded... ethereal, almost. Like it had been around since the beginning of time.
Tony opened his mouth, gearing up to reply, but the words never came. Instead, he just slumped a little, sighing. The blank look came back to his eyes, and Steve regretted what he’d said instantly. Tony’s reasons were none of his business- and after all the effort Tony had gone to for him that evening, he really had no authority to be getting high and mighty about Tony’s tone. He was probably just stressed, and Steve didn’t blame him. He knew he was a goddamn handful on a good day.
“Bruce,” he said, looking up at the other man as he stood on the opposite end of the room and continued to fiddle with his tablet, “you can go now, thanks.”
His hands were shaking, and he could feel his eyes prick. In the space of one conversation, he’d managed to ruin everything.
Following Tony’s orders, Steve didn’t hang up. Just tucked the phone calmly into his pocket and then raised his fists.
Steve’s fingers curled nervously around Tony’s, and all other thoughts swiftly dropped out of his head as he looked down at their joined hands. “Is this okay?” He whispered nervously, and Tony could only laugh in disbelief, squeezing their hands together and tugging him forward with a huff.
He folded his arms as he watched Steve turn away from him, moving to the desk where he pulled open the drawer full of medical supplies. From there, he took an ice-pack, breaking the beads within to activate it before walking over to Tony and wrapping it gently around his stinging hand. He was calm, collected, He didn’t look at Tony with anything other than mild concern and a level of understanding that tended to terrify Tony if he thought about it too hard.
“Hey, shhhh,” Tony moved his head and kissed his moving lips gently, “it’s alright. You weren’t. You wouldn’t. We both know that.”
, Steve Rogers, personally for this." She groaned and turned around, facing the ceiling just as Bucky pushed open the door with a tray of snacks. Mainly icecream. She glared at him when he smiled. "You know, I'm starting to get sick of you, Barnes," she declared sulkily.
, you’ve no idea how hard I’ve tried,” he laughed humorlessly and then shut his eyes, taking a deep breath.
“I’m still in love with you.” The words were falling out of his mouth before Steve even knew what to do with them, and they cut Tony’s little speech off rather effectively as the man just stared at him. Steve figured he might as well go all out now that he’d started though, so he pushed through the fear. “I never stopped. And I will… I’ll spend the rest of my life making up for the things I did, okay, I swear—I know it’s gonna take time, we have… stuff, baggage that we need to talk about, but… but I want—”
In that moment, Steve knew without a shadow of the doubt that he wanted Stone dead. And Steve was going to fucking kill him himself. Nothing else mattered. No other thought or doubt even flickered into his head. He saw that guy, stood on the other side of the corridor, and he saw red. The anger, the rage that he’d been keeping down, it bubbled over, straight off the precipice and rocketing out of him like a tangible wave.
“You lay a finger on him, and I will fucking kill you,” he said simply. “You have my word on that. He's
“You’re very welcome- it is a pleasure to have you back in the building. Sir’s sleeping patterns have become increasingly irregular since your departure, and from my initial scans, so have yours. It will be nice to bring some balance back into the world.”
He felt the vibrations through his fingers as evidence for Tony’s next laugh. “Nice to make your acquaintance, Steve Rogers,” he said, amusement obvious in his voice, “I’m Tony. Now do you mind telling me where you live?”
The communal floor was dark when he wandered in; bathed in the gloomy shadow of night that was slowly fading to morning. It was raining heavily outside, as shown from the heavy clouds that hung above and the incessant pitter-patter of drops against glass. Perfect weather, if you asked Tony. He found the noise soothing.
He got started with the ring design that same morning, curled up in the wicker chair at the front of the porch and watching Steve chop wood a few yards away, those glorious abs sticking to his thin wifebeater as he sweated from the exertion.
He looked up, and Tony stared back down at him for another moment before reaching down for Steve’s hand and then pulling it up, looking at the ring sat comfortably on his finger.
. About anyone except your precious little pet project-“ Ty pointed a vicious finger at Steve, who rolled his eyes and then stepped forward, going in to shove him again. But Tony got there first, smacking his hand out of the air and then propelling him back violently so his back hit the lockers.
“Yeah,” Tony said instead, settling in against Steve’s chest with a small smile, thinking of bubbles and giggles and a soft sense of longing at the sight of the man he loved holding a tiny little baby whilst they both slept peacefully on the couch of their home, “yeah, it was good.”
With a wince and a muffled curse, he sat up on his elbows and looked to the source of the noise. On the couch, the baby was wriggling and squirming, face scrunched in discomfort as he fisted his hands and bawled his eyes out. It was loud and piercing and it sounded like the damn kid was dying. He sat up straighter, feeling as Steve did the same on his other side. "What the fuck?" He slurred, still halfway between conscious and asleep.
Steve just rolled his eyes, walking over to the desk where they’d chucked the ears earlier (too difficult to manoeuvre). He put them back on his head and then leaned against the surface of Tony’s desk. Tony sat up, attempting to wolf-whistle. Due to the fact that he had never wolf-whistled before in his life, however, he gave that up pretty quickly. “A vampire playboy? It’s like all my dreams are coming true at once.”
Steve glanced over to him, shaking his head fondly as he rounded the corner which led to the stairwell. “You know, I’m pretty sure that would be a big job for anyone else.”
LMD’s were good, but from what Tony knew about them, they were also controlled by an external source, which meant they were being transmitted instructions from somewhere. If Tony could find the right frequency to disrupt the connection, he could fuck with the instructions going through to the LMD’s system and, hopefully, shut the thing down.
Pops managed to collect himself, though- walking forward and smiling as he reached out to squeeze Peter’s shoulder, before heading to the cupboards and grabbing a mug. “You had a good day today?”
“No, that was last month,” Sam corrected, “I think this time it was because Nat didn’t like one of the girls Clint had met and so she… had words with her.”
He wasn’t sure how many times he said Tony’s name. Until words wouldn’t come anymore. Until his voice had given up. The bathroom was as dark as the bedroom. He sat and stared at the rim of the bathtub for a few hours.
Helen made a brief call, undoubtedly to one of the team, because all she said was, “He’s awake. Yeah. Yeah, okay.” And then hung up again. After ordering him not to mess with the healing process and ruin her excellent work, she walked out of the room and left him to his own devices, presumably to go and do something else revolutionary and way cooler than what he was going to be stuck doing over the next few days. He really hoped to pick her brain one day. He probably needed to work on making her like him first, but after that, they’d have some amazing conversations, he just knew it.
They got Peter tucked into his crib without any hassle, and then he and Steve quietly set about getting ready for bed themselves, both of them already sleepy and lethargic. Tony briefly thought about trimming his beard in preparation for the board meeting tomorrow, but ultimately decided he couldn’t be bothered and then fell into bed with Steve as soon as he’d pulled on his pajamas. Wordlessly, Steve pulled him in, skin swarm against Tony’s mouth as he leaned forward to press a kiss to whichever piece of the other man his lips connected with.
He let the break pass him by, eyes mostly shut against the table and hand laid out flat for Tony to mess with as he talked to the others. He heard Thor join them at some point, but aside from a hefty pat on the shoulder, he just left Steve to it.
“What, make vague and intensely threatening comments?” Bruce asked him, looking at him from his blanket-fort and pulling a face.
They didn’t waste time. Both of them were unsteady on their feet as they exited, desperate to leave the somewhat crushing space of the workshop filled with all that horrible knowledge. Tony had never been afraid of information, but looking through those files had just felt like the potential for a fresh horror each time, and it had made him more scared than he probably should have been. He wasn’t even sure why it had all reacted so badly within him; objectively, he knew that he’d seen worse- more foul human acts, more gruesome scenes of torture. Relatively speaking, it was mild. But maybe because Peter was with them now, and he was a baby, and like Tony had said at the very beginning- he had a duty of care, it just made everything feel so much more horrific. To think of him in that horrible place… it was like a nightmare. One that Tony could only hope to God the kid would never be able to remember.
He shuddered violently, feeling the clammy coldness of his own skin. It was over now. Done. Finished. Peter was here, and he was safe, and that was what mattered.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said again, tilting Tony’s head back upward gently with his two fingers. His eyes were tired, but full of life. It was enough. “I know it must have hurt you to watch that.”
“We can make a new fort?” Steve said, looking around the room questioningly, but all his other friends just groaned and waved tired hands. They hadn’t moved from the areas in which they’d all been trapped by the cave-in, and so all around the room people were simply lounging around, half-buried and too tired to care. Steve glanced at his watch, and realized with surprise that it was 3am. They’d been messing around for hours, and he had barely even realized.
He’d survived death before. He could do it again. Tony was stronger than that, and Steve just had to have faith in him.
Steve spotted it immediately, but lost sight of Tony as the plumes of dust shot through the opening it had made. He heard himself call out in panic, but aside from that, it was as if everything else had gone silent.
“He’s not even going to be at that party,” Steve blurted irritably, “he said he’d- he’s going to be over here at my place.”
Clint’s head turned. “What?” He looked warily at the group of faces staring him down. “Have I fucked up?”
Steve couldn’t move, all of his limbs pinned in place. Someone told him to breathe, and he ignored them. It felt like it would be too loud in this room. Instead, he kept his eyes fixed on the helmet in front of him, still beeping away, proof that someone, somewhere, had managed to get a message through across the cosmos.
Turning around and dropping a few of the bags, he hitched his backpack up and then continued on his way. It made his back ache like shit, but it was the least he could do for Mrs Wilson. And anyway- she’d asked for baking stuff, which inevitably meant cookies were on the way. And Steve
It took Steve a second to open his eyes- a second in which Tony’s mind flashed briefly through the tiresomely familiar
you guys distracted me, I knew he was coming, holy shit, get down here and help me hide!” Clint hissed, looking around wildly at the half-opened suitcase and then kicking it back under the bed.
The grin slid off Tony’s face, and was replaced with an involuntary scowl. “I told you, Steve- kid prodigy, I never liked any of that stuff-”
of it. Hell, she stuck around despite it, if anything. One of the handful of people who like me when I’m sober, I guess. Thor, too- we met whilst we were both depressingly sober. And- and you! So I mean, it’s not… it’s not everyone. It’s not.”
Tony just sighed, in the end, and let Steve attack his face. “The worst,” he mumbled, although the way he leaned into Steve’s touch suggested otherwise.
Tony was crazy. That was the only explanation. Blowing hot one moment and cold the next- Steve just couldn't fucking work him out.
“Sir is dead.” The words were the ones of every automated program, but the grief held underneath them was that of a child who had just lost his father, a life, a whole reason for being.
This couldn’t be happening. They couldn’t have failed him so soon. They’d promised to look after him.
The words were nothing but a whisper in the room, and Bruce’s face fell like a stack of bricks. He looked up at Clint rapidly. “Call him, now,” he commanded, and with a wordless nod Clint scarpered from the room, the door swinging shut behind him. Steve’s whole world felt like it was spinning off its axis; he couldn’t see, couldn’t breathe, this couldn’t be happening-
“They stay. Please,” and fuck, Steve was asking him, he was asking him to keep them, like Tony might somehow reject them for whatever reason.
“We’ll need to sit him up in order to put his shoulder back in place,” Thor said beside him, and Steve nodded, his hands gently cradling Tony’s head and neck while Thor helped Tony into a sitting position. Tony hissed in pain again, good hand going to his head. “Fa male,” he said softly, “Vorrei sdraiarmi, per favour,”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat, everything that he’d been practising suddenly leaving his head in one fell swoop. Tony was in his engineering gear; a tank top and sweats, hair mussed, and there were a pair of welding goggles around his neck, like Steve had caught him mid-project. He looked just as beautiful as the day Steve had left him.
Except when he looked up, he saw Steve sat at the desk, looking at him with cold eyes. He looked tired, Tony thought. A little ill. “Where the hell have you been?”
Since his mom’s death, you see, Steve’s subconscious had a tendency of being a real bitch to him. Night terrors and bad dreams had plagued him a lot, during the first few months, leaving him sleepless and terrified of what he would see when he shut his eyes. They’d died down a little since then, but Steve still suffered from them from time to time.
particular conversation. My fault- should’ve remembered it doesn’t matter how far away you’re stood, it’s useless if he’s got something in his hand. Nice tumbler of whiskey thrown at the wall just here,” Tony circled the space an inch or two away from his head, and Steve just stared in horror. He realized his knuckles had turned white against Tony’s hand.
Today it was dad who greeted him. He was sat with a coffee in hand and tablet in the other, idly tapping at the keys and trying to keep his eyes open. Peter knew he hadn’t been sleeping well- it wasn’t exactly hard to tell. And although they never spoke to him about what they did with the avengers, Peter could guess that that had been the trigger for all the stupidity lately.
“Steve?” Tony turned to him and raised a hand, shutting his eyes for a second. “Can we just try it? We have no reason not to. And it’ll take some of the responsibility off our shoulders. He’s not solely our concern. We all agreed to take him in until we can put him somewhere else, and it’s time everyone else started pulling their weight.”
He clenched his jaw and bumped her with his shoulder. “Let’s just get this over with,” he muttered, slipping in behind Natasha as she scanned in with her keycard. Since it was so early in the morning, most people would be at home, and only the night guards would be on duty. That made it a little easier, he supposed.
Instantly, a small part of Steve began to freak out. “What?” He asked, sitting up straighter. “Tony, what is it? Are you okay?”
When they did end up getting back to the Tower, the penthouse floor was still abuzz with activity despite the relatively late hour. Steve and Tony shared a sigh when they realised that Peter was still up and sat on the table, banging a crayon uselessly against a white sheet of paper. Around him, the rest of the team were milling about on various bits of furniture, and Clint, of course, had taken residence on the top of the fridge for a reason that everyone had long-since given up trying to find.
you, I said, ‘Steve, baby, this won’t go well’, and did you listen?” He waved to the onions. “No. And now it’s all ruined.”
“You, uh- you gonna take them or…?” Tony asked, cocking his head a little, and the gesture was oddly familiar- like he was trying to work Steve out again.
She threw a bunch of twenties in his face. “You’re on pizza run,” she said simply, snuggling down further into Bucky’s arms.
. He was tiny and small and vulnerable and they’d done all those horrible, awful things to him while he’d screamed and cried and—
What happened to me, was never your fault. You did everything you could. I didn’t… I didn’t know you were so affected- I’m so sorry. It wasn’t your fault. It
“Yeah, that’s what they all say,” Clint muttered mutinously under Steve’s feet, “’nd then you end up waitin’ for ‘em in the park only t’ see ‘em ten minutes later with some other guy, laughin’ away-“
Steve heard all the words, but his mind focused in on Tony’s eyes—the genuine sadness and longing there. He really meant that. Steve was fast losing track of what was real and what was fabricated by that point, and he felt almost dizzy with it. This had been something he’d dreamed of, in those weak moments when he’d let himself think about it rather than just pushing it down and away. He’d wished for this. A reconciliation. A chance to just talk to Tony, now that he was a little steadier, a little more able to process his emotions. He’d pictured the way he’d do it—get down on his knees and beg if he’d had to, and Tony would shake his head and get down to his level with him, hold his face in his hands, tell him
“You are kind and you care-“ Steve’s voice got louder, and he followed Tony relentlessly, standing on the bed and ducking under a low-hanging light to avoid a second concussion, “- and you look out for people even when you don’t need to-“
Steve groaned, walking easily with Tony toward the group of people, who quickly started scattering, yelling and moaning in despair as they watched Steve squeeze his hands against Tony’s ass.
Just as he heard the voice that told him to come in, Tony’s own mixed in with it, thrown out absently as the boy turned back to his phone and started typing lazily.
Pushing his shoulder against the door of the conference room, Steve pulled the trolley inside and then wheeled it over to a corner. There was no lock on the door, he realised—but that would be okay. Rapping a knuckle against the lid of the trash compartment, Steve informed Tony he was free to leave the confines of the trash. “Are you sure this is going to work?” He asked, helping Tony’s fragile body out and balancing him as he swayed. “What if the signal extends out of the building as well as into it and your arms can’t link up to your suit?”
Tony clenched his jaw, knocking a knuckle against each locker he passed absently. "Is any of this really any of your business, Steve? I thought I told you to stay away from me."
Tony chuckled darkly; the first sign that he’d been following the conversation at all. “Yeah. Literally,” he mumbled,
Steve already felt sick. He looked behind him, over to the guest bedroom where Tony would be sleeping, then back into the living room. Last time he’d been here with the whole group, they’d built a pillow fort. Tony had told him he was reapplying to MIT. Things hadn’t been perfect, but they’d been good. Tony had been happy. Now, how the hell was he supposed to apply to MIT? How could he turn his life around when he’d just lost the only semi-stable thing he had in it?
The last period of Friday finally rolled around, and with it came Steve’s usual post-week exhaustion. School had always been difficult on him and his body- he needed the weekend’s rest more than he needed air, some months- and this one had seemed as if it had taken double the time to come for some reason, which had been fun. The past five days hadn’t been the best on record, either. Sleep refused to come easy, and everything felt far too disorganised in his head- the weight inside him feeling more prominent than ever.
That spurred another laugh from Tony as they both ran up the stairs. “Good,” he said soundly, once he’d reached the top, “bit of adventure never hurt anyone, in my opinion.”
“Because—look, it’s not even an official rota, you touched him last, you do the diaper, that’s the rule—”
“I wouldn’t care if you’d used to sleep with three people every night and the entire school had told me as much,” Steve mumbled into his mouth, feeling Tony wind his arms around Steve’s waist and tug him even closer.
“Good morning,” the bulky computer that was strapped into the seat said cheerily, an orange circle in the middle of the monitor pulsing with every syllable the AI spoke, “if you wouldn’t mind unhooking the wiring from the dashboard and taking the computer up into Thor’s apartment so I may be reunited with Sir, that would be greatly appreciated.”
“Very well,” JARVIS conceded in the end, and Steve thought briefly of how the otherwise perfect AI had developed the one most fatal human flaw—trust. “But please, Captain. Do not do anything rash. Causing pain won’t change things. Revenge won’t stop what happened.”
He started shuffling out from under the bed, but just as his head poked out, he heard Tony suddenly move up above him. His legs landed into Steve’s vision, and then his knees buckled and he crouched down, not so much looking at Steve as he was looking through him. His face was blank as he pushed Steve’s shoulder backward. “Stay there,” he whispered, “stay, he might come back. If he sees you he’ll try and- just stay there.”
Steve stood rapidly, hands clutching at his hair. Everything that had happened, had happened because of him. Because of Steve. He’d been so damn full of himself when he’d spoken to Ty that day; so fucking uncaring of the consequences his actions would have for Tony. And this is what had happened because of it.
He blinked rapidly and felt the tears slip silently down his face as he worked over Tony’s face. Thor came back a few minutes later, but he was empty handed, and he just shook his head. “I couldn’t find any butterfly bandages,” he said, “I got a roll of cloth bandage, but it’s not—”
“Smooth,” Rhodey offered, tossing a napkin at him. “Do you know how ridiculous it is that I know his civilian persona at a glance?”
“Yeah, and that was before I realised you were a pool shark, and that you’d use your stupidly good aim to save people from creeps, and actually swear like the soldier you are.”
“Well everyone knows a sire will lie about their kid, everyone’s trying to show off.” Stíofán picked up the spade to keep mixing. “Tony couldn’t cook at all when he got here. Ma had to teach him and I still do a lot of it when he’s at the forge.”
The thought that Peter might get hurt - or, heaven forbid, might die - made his insides want to shrivel up in grief. And even the notion that he might have to tell Steve they had lost their baby, that Tony hadn't been able to protect him, was too much to bear.
“Come on through.” She opened the door, waiting for him to kick off his boots before leading him down the hall and into the room Bruce used for examinations. The door was ajar, and as he pushed it open, the scene that greeted him made his heart clench.
Stíofán didn’t like the sound of that. What if Antonius started eying up other Bucks in the yard? Seducing them with his doe eyes and soft curls, and well-trimmed beard.
“You might not have been,” Tony protested. “You might have been gutted like a pig, and I wouldn’t have known until it was too late.”
When he reached the courthouse, he discovered Hodge and his gang had been sentenced to thirty days in the county jail, and Bucky and Sam offered to escort them over. Tony found himself feeling relieved. It was only thirty days, but perhaps this would be enough to dissuade those criminals from returning.
He decided to walk back from the meeting and get a bit of fresh air, and as he did, he passed an open doorway that smelled like fresh coffee and pastries.
He’d left the room and thought about the stupid fucking cocktail for the rest of the day; the ghost of its tang coating his tongue.
Tony. Okay- okay, so Tony had answered. Now what? What was Steve supposed to ask him? He couldn’t exactly tell the guy to come over and pick his ass up again- for starters, he didn’t even know where he was himself, and secondly, he wasn’t sure Tony would be up for going through that a second time. The first one had been stupid enough.
Tony tutted smile playing on his face as he watched Steve take a sip and savour the taste it left in the back of his throat. “Pace yourself,” he warned, “that stuff’s strong as shit.”
. Wanted to feel Steve’s hands on him, taste his kisses. Steve could even bite him, if he wanted. Tony knew people did it and loved it. And seeing as Steve mainly took animal blood and then substituted the rest of the nutrients with vitamin supplements, that’d probably be great for him as well as Tony.
Which was true. Steve had definitely been with him through the thickest of thicks and the thinnest of thins. But for all Tony knew, this could be the final straw. Reasonable enough- a video of Tony in a raucous threesome was currently circulating the internet, and that was something Steve Rogers should
Tony yelled, and Steve rolled instantly, turning to face him- just as a horrifying crack tore through the floor.
“Just do your homework or something,” he suggested, whilst Steve scoffed loudly and obviously to his left, “they’ll be done sorting their shit soon- you know Bucky, he can’t hold a grudge for shit.”
“Oh,” Steve blushed a little before pushing Tony in the shoulder when he saw the man’s face. “Shut up, I told you, I’m no good at this!”
his mind working, see him learning, figuring out perspectives and spatial coordination and distances. It was… incredible, in a simplistic way. Tony almost felt awed.
Peter considered this for a moment, before nodding and giving both of them no other warning than a giggled, “cash me!” before he dropped into Steve’s waiting arms.
“I am not sure!” Thor said jovially, his voice about ten times louder than usual, which was saying something- “but it certainly seems to have worked!”
Tony sat slowly onto the couch, grinning up at Steve with a little embarrassment. “I’m feeling a slight sense of déjà vu here,” he admitted, “although to be fair, the memories of this room the first time around are a lot blurrier.”
Tony scoffed, removing Steve’s hand to speak. “Believe me, this would be my pleasure. I’m pretty sure Fury’s out for my head this week anyway, so I need somewhere to lay low. Don’t sweat it, Rogers, I’ve got it all sorted.”
Tony shot him a look from the side, mouth turning upward as his fingers squeezed gently around Steve’s. “Oh sweetheart, I ain’t ever had a kiss like
Steve glanced Tony’s way, and Tony just shook his head minutely. “And now what?” He asked sharply. “You just go home, get a letter of recommendation from AIM, eat Chinese?”
Steve paused, feeling Sam’s own offer fall into a very similar category to his Dad’s the previous evening. The whole family had done far too much for him already. Steve wasn’t going to bother them with more.
Steve gritted his teeth, fighting against the pain as he bucked his hips and dislodged Rumlow. He felt a fresh wave of warm blood spill down his side, but ignored it. For now, all that mattered was winning this fight. Stopping Rumlow. Making sure Tony got out.
“Call Steve,” he muttered, sliding the coffee over to Thor and then backing away, “he’ll probably be getting up for his run about now-ish anyway. He might help calm Peter down.”
Except he’d been alone. and usually, no matter how mad they were at each other, Pops and Dad had always talked to Peter about this together.
“Ugh, why so many questions?” Tony huffed and folded his arms, “my plan will not get us killed, Steve, I promise. And if it does, then it’s most certainly not through choice.”
Steve looked at him for a moment, and when Thor caught his eye they both gave one another a tired smile. “Rough day, huh?” Steve asked, glancing up to the dark sky.
Being on his phone and adding in the occasional comment to Nat and Clint’s bickering eventually led to him flicking through his gallery absently while waiting for a response from his friends. The sight of his files, now filled with pictures of Steve, and Steve’s face, and his soft smile squished up next to Tony’s, was enough to lift his mood considerably, and he started to smile to himself as he curled up in bed and went through the ever-growing folder dedicated to his relationship.
Unfortunately, Steve knew him well enough to see that. “I love you, Tony,” he said softly, “and you love me. We’re
Steve looked at him in confusion for a few moments, before the light dawned in his eyes and his mouth dropped open in delight. “Oh!” He said again, much happier that time, “oh yeah! So does that mean we’re already married?”
Thor beamed over at him, patting him on the back. “Surprisingly well! The Wrecking Crew are fools, but they certainly offer a strange form of entertainment for a Tuesday morning.”
“Probably,” Tony said, “although in my defence, I was happy to just die on that mountain with my love forever un-confessed like a 17
Tony shrugged, running a hand through his wild hair and then winking. “Well where the hell is the fun in that, Steve Rogers?” He asked, before hopping off the ledge, his hands curling around the drainpipe that ran beside Steve’s wall. Steve just watched, coughing out a shocked bark of laughter as he surged forward and stuck his head out of the window whilst Tony scuttled down the wall as if it was the easiest thing in the world.
Steve had always loved that sound. He always worried one day it would stop, too, but for now, Tony was very much alive, and his heart still beat. Steve could hear it for himself. It was a truly beautiful noise. The sound of life. The sound of everything Steve held dear, encompassed into one person currently drooling lightly against his ribs. He’d told himself to stop worrying so much over the other man after the whole embarrassing ‘I thought you were having a heart attack and crashed through your glass wall in order to try and save you’ debacle- but still. It was so deeply ingrained into Steve by that point in their relationship that he wasn’t entirely sure he’d ever be able to stop. Tony’s body was beautiful- the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen, even- but it was also fragile. Steve wouldn’t be forgetting that fact any time soon.
With a gruff nod, Tony waved him in and signalled to JARVIS to turn the music down, keeping his eyes on the circuit board balanced in his lap. “To what do I owe the pleasure?” He began, quirking an eyebrow and picking up a screwdriver.
Clint was the one who apologized, in the end. He wouldn’t hear Steve try and get in first- which was both satisfying and frustrating.
He sighed, picking Peter up. It had been six very long days, by that point, and he could feel the way Steve had tensed up a little on the table. Tony didn’t want to have this conversation right now. He’d do something uncalled for, like get upset over it. It wasn’t even a big deal if Steve refused to interact with Peter, and always gave Tony funny looks whenever he did. It wasn’t important that Steve got snappy whenever one of the team made jokes about Peter being a new addition to their ‘happy family’.
His hands paused their tapping when another was placed over them, holding them gently and quietly calming the erratic movements.
Tony smiled down at him, and Steve shut his eyes again as he laid back into the pillows. He knew he probably looked a mess- unlike Tony, he wasn’t so good at waking up perfect- but right now he was too blissed out to really worry too much about it.
It was built like a sort of tent, with sheets that knotted into one another strung up like a pyramid, all the way to what looked like the light fitting in the roof. They’d found fairy lights from somewhere, and they were hanging down in the middle like vines, lighting the place up in a golden glow. The floor was a fluffy red rug, but there were so many pillows and beanbags in the middle that Steve could hardly see it at all. The pillow on the outside seemed simply to be insulation for the main blanket-tent, blocking out any of the light or view of the outside world.
“He said Bruce’s name!” There was a short pause where someone else—possibly Thor—spoke, and then Clint huffed exasperatedly. “Okay, well, he missed out the ‘R’, so it’s not like, Shakespeare or something, but he was definitely pointing at Bruce when he said it! I’m telling you, the kid’s a genius. Fuck Xavier, we’re definitely gonna get him into MIT or Harvard or something—”
“Why are we keeping diapers in the condiment cupboard?” Bruce asked as he walked into the kitchen with an incredulous look on his face, “also, I don’t know how to put one on. You’re gonna have to do it.”
But he had. He had gotten hurt. Because at the end of the day, this had been a boy, looking at the ugly power of his father’s rage, and just wondering what the hell it was that he’d done to make his own dad hate him so much. Steve saw the look in Tony’s eyes when he talked about Howard sometimes. Saw the pain, the childish frustration. Under all the resentment, under all his cold indifference, Tony had only ever wanted his father to be proud of him. To love him.
It was quite honestly adorable. Although maybe Steve was slightly biased. But who the fuck cared, really?
Tony blushed and shrugged nonchalantly, turning toward the school again. But Steve tugged him back, an almost nervous look on his face as he rocked back on his feet. “And, uh. I think about you all the time too. So.” He lifted a shoulder absently before setting up walking again, his hand squeezing around Tony’s lightly. Tony smiled, knowing it was probably stupid to feel that happy at such a simple statement, but screw it. He was only intelligent when it came to robots. And Steve was no robot.
“Seriously, don’t worry about it,” Steve laughed gently, “Bucky shoved you into the concrete the first time you met him, so I figure this is fair. They- they must care a whole lot about you.”
