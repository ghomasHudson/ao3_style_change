“Hardly anyone knew I even existed. That I was his son, Pepper. Businessmen and other packs would think I was just another worker and point out our similarities. When it seemed that they were growing suspicious, he moved them away from me or I would conveniently have big projects to complete. He didn’t care. He was ashamed and wanted to hide me away.”
“Alright, Tony, just calm down.” Sam stepped forward, a hand on the omega’s shoulder. “We’ll make sure they’re safe.” Tony nodded, turning away from the deltas and walking down the hallway again. Sam turned to Clint and shrugged. “Maybe pregnancy has made him cranky.”
Steve crouched down to Peter’s height. “Honestly Peter I can’t say. But my pack are looking and helping anyone they can find. We won’t give up. It’s just important that you’re not in danger anymore.”
“Most omegas would be scared that he would hear them.”
The room next to him had a female inside. She was sitting on the floor, back up against the wall the male was looking at. She looked around the same age as him and had long brown hair. Her clothes were also the same and had the same bandage around her right hand. Her mouth looked like she was talking, and Tony was unable to pick up on her lip reading and his hearing, even as a shifter, wasn’t able to pick up through the glass panes.
Carefully, Steve picked the omega up, hoping not to wake him. Tony mumbled something to do with ‘not going to sleep’, but that was all. Steve sent Loki a small smile before taking Tony back upstairs to their room. The blonde laid Tony on the bed, pulling the blanket over him, to which Tony mumbled something else before rolling onto his side.
“Are you sure about that?” Rhodey’s eyebrows rose as the omega chugged the bottle of rum.
She pawed at the door, poking her head out to look around the corridor. Fire turned back to Tony, tilting her head slightly to indicate it was clear. Tony shifted too, clothes ripping off, before padding over to where the feline shifter stood.
“Tony... Bruce has gone if you just want to talk to me.” Pepper remained glued to the door, listening for any signs of movement. She could hear very faint sniffling and wheezing. “Can you give me a number at least?”
“I’ll help you.” Tony smiled, slipping off the counter.
“Fuck.” The omega muttered, his head throbbing and glanced down at Steve who was still asleep, trying to recall what happened last night.
Steve continued to look out of the window from Agent Coulson’s office. After the meeting with The Director, the pack, along with Agents Coulson and Carter had gone back to his office, to try and think of a plan. Steve was still hung up on SHIELD not helping out. They couldn’t use SHIELD equipment and if they were to stay anywhere it would have to be through their own money, as it wasn’t an official SHIELD mission.
“Everyone but you?” Tony shrugged. “Now, before you can complain about how shit I am at keeping secrets, I’m going to hit shuffle play, and whatever song plays, we have to dance to, and it will be our song.” The brunette looked up at the blonde with a shy smile.
Eventually, HYDRA got what they wanted from the two omegas. The shifter DNA strands that would make the two human siblings into shifters, just like them. The two humans were in the next room over, so both Tony and Fire were able to hear everything. The shouting. The screaming. Tony closed his eyes, swallowing. He didn’t want to hear this.
“Peter.” Steve sighed, crouching down so he was at eye level with the boy once more. “I just want you to know because you seem like a smart boy, that upstairs and outside is going to look really scary, okay? But I’m going to make sure you’re safe and then I’ll look for your aunt and uncle.”
“I’m good.”
Okay, I am so sorry it has been like over a week or something since I last updated. I didn't get anything done when I went away and that mixed with work and general laziness, procrastination and Netflix, this week hasn't been great for writing. But I'm getting back into the groove. I hope you enjoy this chapter! I think the next one will be in a couple of days so I can catch up on myself.
Reasoning: I wanted another female character, and an alpha female, that Tony could befriend. I later realised that I could have used Carol Danvers, but hey, maybe she could make an appearance? Brooke’s fur is a creamy-white, similar to her hair colour.
“You have children?”
Only himself and his father had access to the omega’s bank and knew the details and JARVIS of course. If Obadiah or any other members of the Stark Pack tried to touch his bank, one, JARVIS would tell him, and two, he’d sue their asses. He knew they wouldn’t though, as Stane loved Howard’s business, Stark Industries, way too much to risk losing it to its rightful inheritor. So, Tony would take as much as he could, it was his business and could prove it in a heartbeat. It would mean Stane and the whole pack of greedy shifters would lose out and would probably go to prison if Tony was feeling vicious enough.
Tony ignored Steve, pulling him away from the blanket so they were standing on the grass. Without saying anything, the omega took Steve’s hands and placed them on his waist, smiling up at the alpha who looked like a deer caught in headlights as he stared at his hands.
“I think with some accessories you could really make it work.” Fire tilted her head. “Style your hair a little bit?”
Of course, that didn’t stop the alpha from telling the story of how Tony got into a stranger’s car and frightened the hell out of them. The car had been exactly the same as Rhodey’s, the only difference was the driver who as a middle-aged white woman who screamed when Tony had gotten into her car saying, ‘I’m about to kill someone’. Yeah, he was lucky she didn’t call the cops. The stories continued as they ate, from the time a bench took out his front teeth when he was five to getting stuck in a child-swing in his mid-twenties and the fire brigade had to reuse him, along with a variety of drunken moments from when he was in MIT, so the omega just went along with it because there was no way he was getting out of it
“You’re such a child.”
“You’re so weird.” Tony shook his head. “Also, ‘Sparkles’?”
“What?”
“I’m going to check on Bruce, come on Clint. Leave Sam to nap.”
Clint places a hand on the pad again. “Hawkeye.”
“Technically no, but I made the bomb,” Tony smirked at the archer. “Did the other’s think it was Clint?”
“You ready?” Steve asked, holding out his hand.
Bruce kept an arm around Tony as the two of them walked away from the bar, the omega shaking. The delta looked him up and down, concern brushing over his face at the omega’s obvious fright. He may have been tough inside, but that was clearly an act to stick up for himself.
Positive.
“Steve would jump off a cliff if Tony told him to,” Sam stated, making the omega blush.
Tony left the lab, hurriedly walking to the elevator, pressing the down button repeatedly as if it would speed it up. The doors to the lift opened, the omega stepped inside, where another agent was already on her way down to the ground floor.
Steve had been doing some research on pregnancies. While he knew the basics, he’s never actually known anyone that’s been pregnant before, so he had no one to go to for advice. While most human pregnancies last thirty-seven to forty-two weeks, shifter pregnancies tend to be shorter, especially with males, only lasting thirty to thirty-five weeks. So, Tony would be over halfway through his pregnancy by now.
There was no reason for the blonde to come to SHIELD HQ today. Natasha and Clint were only dropping off their mission report to Agent Coulson as the WI-FI was, once again, down in the packhouse so they couldn’t send it by email. Bruce had left early that morning to start work at the SHIELD labs and didn’t have the time to look at it. The pair were going to say a quick hello to him too. Steve had insisted he come along because he hadn’t seen Peggy in around 2 weeks and wanted to check up on her again. It did look weird, Steve knew he was going to get teased by Clint, especially as he could have just come another time and texted her his friend as suggested but he was desperate to come today. What the beta and delta didn’t know that their alpha was here for another reason too.
Nat smirked over at Clint who gasped.
“You don’t look good. Do you need to sit down? Have some water?” Bruce asked, concerned as he walked over to the omega.
“Coming to dance?” He offered out a hand, grinning wide.
“I know what it’s like...” Bruce gave a look of sympathy “Why don’t we have a chat over some coffee?”
“I’m listening,” Tony replied, head-turning to face the blonde.
“Hello?” Steve sniffed, he could catch a scent of a wolf shifter behind the door, but it was harder to make out in his human form and with the door blocking it. “I’m here on a rescue mission.” There was no response, but Steve heard a clang from behind the door. “I’m coming in, stand back.”
“No, I think you always have the potential.” She kissed him long and deep. “You just need to find the right motivation.” God help him, he would never get used to Pepper saying things like that!
Tony shook himself from that thought. This was the main reason why he needed to stop this bullshit! He was never his usual self whenever he was around Steve! The man was like a typhoon that could easily sweep him away if he let his guard down. He was a Dom of Dom, he needed the control.
Note: Steve never saw the footage, he let Tony think he did to spite him which totally backfire on him. If Steve had known what was in the footage he would never do it, he would have respected Tony for resisting torture and defeat his adversary.
“Look.” Tony said, “I know that you’re probably over the moon about having a Bond with someone.” His eyes met Steve’s and they were burning with an indefinable intensity. “But I already have someone and I would really appreciate it if you would keep the bond thing a secret.”
Steve had gone right through the core of it, surely as though he had sliced Tony open and laid a finger to his beating heart. The brunet could feel his anger rose now, liquid and hot in his chest.
The ten rings must have tortured him, Steve knew what happen to hostages during the war. And yet, Tony had flown back to the place that haunted him to rescue a village from the Ten Rings not long after that.
“You know what, when all this was over, you could find someone better. Someone who would listen to you, did whatever you say? Bend over for you whenever you snapped your fingers.” Tony said, long and low and dark.
"Cap?" he heard Natasha said, and he realized with a heavy heart he had to make the hardest call of his life. His heartbeat hysterically, it going to explode in his chest. There was only so much time they had to close the portal before the bomb would backfire to New York. Tony would have died in vain if Steve allowed that hole to stay open. No matter, how much he wanted to die with Tony he couldn’t let other people die.
Steve's discovery of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Phase Two planned to use the Tesseract to create weapons made anger bubbling within him. Fury had breached his trust. He was the same as Loki wanted to weaponize the Tesseract.
The cry that slipped past Steve’s lips so filled with agony, with the overwhelming explosion of pain that stole his breath, his senses and his strength. He sank to the road beneath him, dying inside. He could felt it, like a slow wave of destruction raced through his heart, ripped it apart piece by piece before struck at his very soul.
They spent every Thursday afternoon doing anything she wanted, and he would massage her shoulders after a long day work, which usually got her into a good mood for sex.
From the beginning
Cap sighed in relief that Tony was safe and sound. Tony closed his eyes and didn't move when the clomping of footsteps nearer and stopped beside him.
Bruce put the scepter aside and shouldered past towards the computer monitor. “Sorry, kids. You didn't get to see my party trick after all.”
Had Captain America ever been held hostage, beaten, broken and tortured for three whole months as he did and still managed to defeat his adversary and escape? NO. Tony Stark would never be a hero nor was he fit to be an Avenger, but he was proud to state he was a much stronger protector than Rogers and had survived more than the jackass in front of him ever did as a civilian!
The man looked a little surprise, but Steve didn’t care if he found out about him and Howard, not when Howard might be dead.
Thor who hadn’t joined the fight laughed out loud at them “You people are so petty. And tiny.”
Angry, Thor swung and raised his hammer, brandishing it threateningly.
Steve looked around, finding said lever across a big gap of air space
One of the areas in which Steve's abilities were enhanced was his sharp hearing. But even he was unsure whether he was only imagining that Tony murmured "I am so sorry." as he walked away from the door.
His armor was completely unresponsive now. Tony's breath caught in his throat, his lungs struggled for breath and desperation pickled inside him as he had no air circulating. His heartbeat hysterically like it was going to explode in his chest. Time ticked by as Tony’s conscience faded.
Silence. He could see the other scientist didn't believe him.
Steve sputtered for a second at that. "I'm sorry, did you say…"
“So, Steven tell me more about yourself,” Anthony’s voice was velveted soft, lazy with provocation. But his gaze wasn’t lazy it was predatory, like an animal on the scent. “What do you do for a living?”
Tony tried to back away but was prevented by an arm pulled at his hand, pulled him closer. A whiff of Steve’s scent swirled like kisses around Tony’s head, made him light-headed. Steve framed his face with both hands.
Tony felt a little relieved that it wasn’t a drunken slurred, Howard wasn’t drunk. It was usually worse whenever his dad was drunk. But the relief was short-lived.
He glanced fearfully at Pepper who mumbled something incoherent as she rolled over in her sleep next to him. He shamefully glanced down at his stomach and legs; both coated with semen and sighed.
Tony grunted when Steve's fist connected with his face. Wiping the blood away, with the palm of his hand. The guy’s punch barely touched his skin, and Tony felt his hackles rise, Rogers should have been angrier than this!
The first day in Avenger Tower
One fan said Tony is like a baby goat who keeps trying to make friends with puppy Steve by head-butting him, but Steve does not understand that that is how goats show affection.
Steve glared harder this time, tired of Tony's blasé attitude to everything, even important and dangerous things.
Seconds later, ‘Shoot to Thrill’ blasted out of her speakers and filled the jet’s cabin and drowning out the voices below.
Steve and Tony instinctively met each other’s gaze. Steve was looking at Tony, with all of his being focused on him as if he was the most precious thing in the world. The protectiveness he saw in Rogers’ eyes caused deep burning happiness. He mentally kicked himself. ‘NO, STOP IT, Rogers just stuck in his 1940 century mentality thinking Omega was the weaker vessel, and in need of big, manly alpha protection. Fuck that! I am Iron Man; I don’t need Rogers’s twisted gallantry.’ His traitorous heart still beating like a jackhammer.
The next time she saw her husband Howard looked at her like a child looked at his favorite toy that had broken and it hurts, it hurts so much!!! She would never be able to forget that look.
Thor stepped forward and addressed Fury with thunder-like fury. “Your work with the Tesseract was what drew Loki to it, and his allies.” His voice was sharp as he warned. “It was the SIGNAL to all the REALMS that the earth was ready for A HIGHER FORM OF WAR.” Thor said trying to make Fury understand what they were getting themselves into.
Despite his determination, Steve felt tired like a rock cairn over hot lava, and any prodded at the rocks would spill molten stuff down his insides.
That memory was more vivid than ever. Steve’s beautiful hurt eyes, Steve’s acceptance, Steve’s love, he remembered it all every day. The pain of the memory made him lose himself working more than ever. He got several charities going to reconstruction projects to rebuild half the damn city. He immersed himself into repairing the Mark VII and took a look at the alien tech. Tony invented some anti-Chitauri tech. When he planned to repair the top floor, he got the idea of renovating the tower to be the Avenger base.
Steve cursed, he couldn’t see any sign of his soulmate but a stream of fire in the dark sky. Every fiber of his being screamed at him to go after Tony.
The blond paused outside the door, still torn apart by the possibility of Fury keeping secrets, decided to do a little investigating himself.
Maria called him early in the morning, less than six hours after she'd left. His annoyance at the caller turned to overjoy when he saw who calling. They spend every minute possible together.  Howard held her hand, opened doors and pulled out chairs for her. He told her he appreciated that she made an effort to look good for him.
Maria confronted her soulmate and called him horrible names. She told him he’d broken her forever. Why? She kept asking him. Why?
Tony's heart broke for him... but he held firm. He doubted that Rogers was even thinking straight. The stupid bond was clouding his mind just like it clouded Tony's. There was no way Captain America would even consider someone like Tony let alone became this desperate for him. He was stubborn and disrespectful and uncouth and just not good enough.
There was another tick of bizarre quiet.
“Steven Thorne.” God, this man captivated every libertine nerve in his body.
Call it escapist, but after shouldering so much on his shoulder, he would like to go home and let his partner dominate him, that was how he and Howard had worked out.
"YOU need to step away." Fury told him, moved forward in a gestured that Bruce knew too well. Fury and Black Widow prepared to restrain him, inching their hands down to grab their guns.
Pepper rolled to her side. Her whole body facing him. Her hand found him and laced their fingers together.
Even after a millennia,
Chapter by beizanten
It was a lot like his old apartment only much bigger. He smiled at the thought Tony had been keeping a tab on him. The wooden furniture only lightly finished, but the bed was soft and fluffy, warmly covered in a dark blue duvet. There was a small couch he liked the look of. The book shelves by the desk were fill with all manner of books -novels, biographies, anthologies of poetry, even books on genetics and robotics pass. There was a large blackboard for him to pin up tactics and different training scenarios.
Hill looked distinctly more irritated than before. Suppressing a huff, Tony moved the conversation back to its original topic.
It took him many months to let his guard down enough around Pepper to see him without his shirt on. Her smile was so blinding Tony thought he could still be able to see it, even with his eyes closed.
He raised his right arm over his chest, shielded the arc reactor just. Sure his arm would bruise from the impact.
Steven found Tony’s nipple with his mouth, and he shrieked as he came, trembling around him, forcing Steven’s growling release- his knot pumped out waves of sperm for a long time until he was drained, beaten. Anthony shuddered and moaned. Steven staggered, kept his balance but just barely.
Pepper and Rhodey are positive alphas in Tony lives. But Pepper is female. Female Alphas usually calmer and more restrains.
Nearing the coordinate supplied by his AI, he saw a crowd of people and a jet hovers overhead. Tony looked down towards the front of the crowd and of course, the so call alien god adorn in emerald green battle armor, complete with gaudy golden helmet horns and magical glowing scepter battling a man in a blue spandex uniform-Captain America. Because hey, let’s just hang out while an alien with superpower and a super-soldier battling nearby while a jet hovers overhead ready to shoot. And Pepper said he had a survival instinct of a moth…
Tony Stark 16-17 years old
Bruce looked at Steve too now.
A tension creeping into every inch of the Omega’s back. He was angry at Rogers for treating him like he was fragile and at himself for falling for the stupid ruse. This was absurd he wasn’t the weak Omega who used to cry when his parent punished him anymore. He had come too far from that, had emerged a strong Dominant. He was the untamable Omega who Alphas had tried to control, use or break him and had failed miserably…
Thor’s jaw twitched. Tony continued “Doth Mother know you weareth her drapes?” he gestured at Thor’s clothes to emphasis.
His enhanced senses caught the sound of a press of a button. Armed guards, wearing uniforms he didn’t recognize walk into the room and Steve quickly went on guard. He shoved past the nurse, fought the guards, and punched a hole into the wall before escaping through it.
Bruce withered under their looks, sighed slightly, looked down at the desk and removed his glasses before wiped them on his shirt. "A warm light for all mankind. Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube." Bruce started, looked up at them finally.
At that moment, Bruce who was looking at the monitor noticed something about the Tesseract. It was right next to the Hellicarier.
Never looked down on Omega, some of them can be more cunning and ruthless and more fiercely competitive than an Alpha since well, the world is harsher on them. Natasha used his sex (very high-level Omega) as a weapon to help her on her spy, Tony also used it to get more people to donate to his charity foundation so it not without upside.
The elevator opened and Steve saw Tony in a suit. Roger’s of the chart’s Alpha scent invaded Tony’s senses. The heat at the core of his body made his legs weak. Tony fought to compose himself.
It was unusual for an Omega to be involved in any form of business. Steven liked him more and more. “28, how old are you? It doesn’t matter. I just wanna know?” he mimicked.
21 Steve's road trip to memory lane part 1
Tony was happily playing with his toy car. Since his father had broken the one Jarvis brought for him and forbidden his caretaker from buying him any more toys Tony had made this one from the materials he could find inside the house. He mused that he could have made a much better car if he could get into his dad’s lab, so many materials there.
"Sounds exhausting." Tony said, tapped the screen.
Maria and Howard, in the early days of their relationship, had once been deeply in love at first sight. Maria remembered so clearly the day she met Howard, he walked into the room and she felt this wave of energy. The force of the bond caught and held their senses, something inside them sang with glee. It was like some part of them that had been asleep for their whole life woke up with a jolt. Both of them whimpered. Maria just knew he was supposed to be in her life.
“It appears that the ship was sinking, sir.”
Desperately, Steve pulled himself along inch by inch, grabbed the railing, and yanked himself onto the platform. He crawled as fast as he could while bullets came up from below and fired off another round at the enemy while trying to get to the red lever.
‘THIS GUY...’ Natasha rolled her eyes, Stark hacked the plane just to play an intro? He should install a PA system in his armor.
Tony tapped away at his computer screen, looked up at Bruce, "If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops."
Tony huffed a laugh "Between the people in this room which one is A) wearing a spangly outfit and B) of no use?" He said a bit harshly, gestured to Rogers. They glared heatedly at each other until Bruce piped up from the corner.
He felt proud at the note of surprise in Coulson’s gaze at how good Tony was at acting. Fake it till you make it, was one of his mottoes. Though this wasn’t entirely an act as he could tell how much Coulson wanted to visit his cellist ‘friend’.
The morning after Steve returned from his trip, the blond got a message from Natasha told him Tony and Pepper’s relationship was over and the rest of the team had moved into the now Avengers Tower.
“Is this not your natural state?” Loki walked through the crowd. “It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power…” Loki's eyes glanced over the kneeling humans, all too afraid and lowered their eyes or already done so “for identity.”
Feeling the bond again, he brought up an entire wealth of emotional baggage Tony believed he had buried long ago. He thought he had subdued the bond when all those dreams stop, years ago.
But somewhere over the span of 3 years, Howard frustration about failing in replicating the super-serum, searching for Captain America and revolutionize the arc reactor triggered it, things changed or rather Howard did and he started to feel dissatisfied.
He’s all and he’s more (from the movie Old guard. I think it is fitting for Steve and Tony)
Bruce had held himself off from everyone, not wanting to get close, both for the protection of other people and himself. He didn't saw what Tony saw in him, something special and admirable. Tony saw someone who had a powerful, almost uncontrollable, internal drive yet was able to keep it in check. As a recovering alcoholic, Tony knew about learning to control yourself and how hard that could be.
His achievement was impressive. Steve wondered if he could keep up with Tony in a conversation.
Looking at himself in the mirror, his eyes fierce, he said, “I will not-I repeat-I will not make the same mistakes my parents did. I will not waste my life over some national icon, and I will not let stupid bond rules over my life! I am strong, much stronger than a stupid bond!” He was too old and too smart to get beaten by the like of this.
Loki looked flabbergasted before gathering himself. "... If it's all the same to you.” he shifted his hand to support his back and let out a small sound of pain. “I'd like that drink now." Loki smiled a bit sheepishly before looking warily at the tip of Hawkeye’s arrow, the man looked like he would just love to shoot him in the eye. Tony, just being Tony, chuckled at Loki’s antics.
“He gives up the Cube and he's all yours. Until then…” Tony said, flipping his mask down to show he meant business. “Stay out of my way…” he turned his back and strode away, grumbling under his breath as he went “Tourist.”
ABO characteristic
Fury wasn’t finding a particularly receptive audience, so he switched his tone to be more placating and hold out his hand as he explained. “The world's filling up with people who couldn't be matched, they couldn't be controlled.” Fury said while facing Tony. The head of SHIELD gave him a hard stare as if willing him to understand.
Flashback
His soul-mate, friends, his HOME were all dead and gone.
“It wasn’t degrading when everything I said was true. You want to defend him, defend this! Howard Stark thought ending the war quickly was just enough reason to give nuclear bombs that devastated two cities. Do you know how many victims there were? The acute effects of the atomic bombings killed 126,000 to 246,000 people. Most of the dead were civilians. INNOCENT CIVILIANS that had no say in the matter as they were run by a dictator/empire and probably DIDN’T WANT A WAR in the first place.”
"Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag…" Tony started. Steve cut him off at that.
“We all did.” eyes grimed, Thor cradled Loki’s neck gently, lovingly while his other hand on his brother’s shoulder willing his younger brother to understand. “Our father...”
Guilt gnawed at Iron Man but it would do him no good. He forced it behind him, entrailed and twisted like vipers. “I’m sorry, Steve. I have to do this.” Steve heard him as loudly as a ticking bomb.
Tony wasn’t always a Dominant Omega. He made himself into a Dom after getting free from Howard. Just like Steve prefer to be submissive Alpha in bed to relieve his tension after a day of being Captain America.
His head was dunked and hold down under cold, murky water until his lungs burned with a brilliant red pain and his vision diminished and grayed out and he stopped jerking around. Being pulled up, he was allowed a moment to take a few deep choking breaths before being pushed under again. All of this happened while he had a chest full of electronics caused the upper half of his body to hook up to an electrical current when water splashed on the exposed wires connected to his chest. He had fought back his screams, but it tore from his throat. Even when he was barely conscious, he still told them to fuck off. He had defeated his adversary and survived after three whole months of being held hostage, tortured, weak and helpless.
“Got it.” Tony confirmed, looked at the screen.
Without letting himself think about it further, Steven brought his mouth to his. The kiss was instantly deep, instantly seeking. Anthony drank him in, absorbed his scent.
Steve assessed him, and his guards.
Steve looked at Tony seriously, already in action mode. "Put on the suit!" he urged.
This wasn’t the world he left behind. It was so strange and new, and wrong. It was like being thrust into Howard’s vision of the future…
Tony forced himself to continue, to not waver in the face of Roger’s pain. Sometimes he really hated himself. “I only love Pepper.” And he did, he loved Pepper deeply. Even if one day she grew tired of him and left, he would always love her, as long as there was a breath in his body.
“As you wish, sir.” and Tony could’ve sworn there was a hint of warmth in his electronic voice.
Disclaimer: I do not own anything.
“Mommy.” Tony called softly made his way to his mom. There was anger, a burning fire in Maria’s eyes. But it was fueled by pain, and Tony wished so badly he could fix it somehow, there must be a way; Stark’s men are excellent engineers. His mom ignored him and make her way straight to the bar drinking straight from the bottle. She finished a whole bottle and had another.
Tony treated Natasha and Clint with a professional attitude despite or because of what Shield had over him. Steve wondered what the mysterious video entailed. Did Natasha and Clint knew what SHIELD had over Tony’s head, did they approve?! He sure hoped not. Whatever it was must be bad to make Tony’s reacted like he did during their argument.
“I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth... and the other guy spat it out!” Bruce admitted. “So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk!” Bruce's voice got angrier as he looked at Romanoff, who seemed unnerved.
“Happy?” Steve’s head tilted slightly.
“You’re the crazy one who can drink that stuff without a mixer.”
“Can you come and get us?” The archer spoke up again.
“Of course it is, I thought of it.”
The pair walked back to the packhouse, avoiding the fallen tree from before so the journey was a little longer than before. Tony still had to ask Pepper and Rhodey if Steve could come tonight and then had to get ready for the meal too. Steve shifted back into his human form as they exited the woods, going over to the chest and taking out his clothes and putting them on. He also took out the omega’s clothes for him before placing them in front of the wolf. The alpha kissed Tony’s head, scratching behind his ear gently before turning around so Tony could shift back and get dressed. Tony laced his fingers with the alpha’s when he was finished, Steve turning to face him with a smile. The blonde led the brunette inside, grinning as they stepped into the kitchen.
“No need for that.” Brock tutted. Three loud bangs went off from down the hall, making Tony flinch. “That’s what happens when you try to escape.”
“So, my science bro, what are we doing today?” Tony asked, feeling better after his shower and coffee, and sat down on the sofa, his legs lifting onto the coffee table. Getting to work would take his mind off a certain wolf that he really didn’t want to think about ever again, which was also a massive lie the omega kept telling himself.
“Black, one sugar, please,” Tony called.
“Yeah, I do.”
“SHIELD is sending us out, there’s been a Hydra attack on a small village, a community pack of around 20-30 shifters, just outside of New York. The Directors want all of us, including the twins, to fly out now. We’ll pick you up from the roof of HQ.”
“So do I, Stevie.” Tony ran a hand through the alpha’s locks. “Go on, before you get in trouble.” Tony gave a pat to Steve’s bum just as the alpha left, laughing once more.
“Rogers!” Steve’s head snapped up to the direction of the drunken call of his name, spotting three figures running towards him.
“Background music.” Tony’s thumb hovered over the shuffle play button.
“Like what?” Peter asked.
“You’re so mean to him.” The omega shook his head with a smile, grabbing Steve’s hand.
“I can-” Steve began but was cut off.
“I told you I’ll be working more. I have some big projects at the moment, and I’d like them to be done as soon as possible.” The omega moved away from Bruce and brushed through everyone at the door and over to his coffee machine.
“W-what's his name?” Tammi asked out of nowhere, looking over, but not directly, at Tony.
“Pepper and Rhodey are taking me to this Italian place, Bella Italia.” Tony smiled. “I think they would have killed you if you didn’t let me go.”
“So where is the pack? Steve?”
Tony went to turn, to find a different route, but more guards came up behind him. They pointed their weapons at him, backing him up into a corner. Tony couldn’t fight them off. He couldn’t risk a thing while pregnant. The omega let out a whine, lowering down to the ground as more guards surrounded him. It wasn’t long before Brock came running over.
"Pietro only gets halfway and I can only old mine for a few seconds before I shift back." She continued. "Do HYDRA think that having you here will help us?"
“But when -wait. What?” The alpha looked up at Tony.
“Why didn’t you tell me?!”
Steve smiled softly, following Peter as he walked around the quinjet, looking it up and down in awe.
“They’ve gotten much better at coping with the loss, especially with having a new pack around.” The beta smiled small, looking at Tony once more. “But there are still rough days. Especially days like today, we all understand. We’re here if they ever want to talk.”
Steve shared his dessert with Tony, smiling softly as he fed the omega the brownies and ice cream. Soon enough everyone left the two wolves in the dining room, Bucky and Natasha last as they took the dirty dishes into the kitchen to be washed.
The ride to SHIELD HQ was pretty much silent after that, the only noise was the soft music coming from the radio. Steve held Tony’s hand the whole way back, the latter resting his head on the alpha wolf’s arm, his eyes closing to get some much-needed rest on their short journey. Once they arrived, the pack was in movement again to get set up and ready to go out on their mission straight away. Steve helped Tony out of the van before grabbing his shield and hooking it onto his back.
“I’m sorry but I don’t think that we have any spaces available today.” She smiled apologetically.
“Okay, let's get us some food, huh?”
“Hey, Tones, listen to me. I know I’m a doctor, but I’m not that kind of doctor.” Bruce joked lightly, running a hand through the older male’s hair.
Two voices responded with the same word, causing Clint and Sam to look at one another.
Steve walked down the halls, sniffing, trying to find the double agent. He went up a flight of stairs, looking in a few rooms. Rumlow could have escaped by now, but something within Steve just had to look. The blonde paused, sniffing as he passed a door. Tony’s scent. It was so strong as if he was on the other side of the door. Carefully Steve opened the door to the room, stepping inside.
Beeping came from the basement, the pack looking over at the stairs as the bots flew up, flying in sequence around the pack before coming up behind Tony.
“Yes please.” The omega nodded. “Have you got any whisky? If not, I’ll have champagne or even wine.”
“Hey, that’s Steve’s line.” Bucky laughed, smirking at the alpha, causing the rest of them to laugh, including Clint.
It was worth it to see Steve smile, nodding fast before going over to the omega. Tony smiled back, taking a sip of the hot beverage. Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist, holding the omega close as he nuzzled into his neck.
“Natasha, Clint and I have made plans for it already.”
After finishing eating the cake and thanking everyone for going to the trouble of surprising him, he and Steve left to go up to their room. He quickly sent a text to Pepper and Rhodey asking if Steve could come tonight, which they both fine with. Steve had helped Tony get most of the confetti out of his hair before the omega jumped into the shower and began washing.
“This is an emergency Pepper!” Tony whined, phone against his ear as he stomped his foot like a child.
“Steve?” Natasha called, turning to face the blonde who was still looking out of the window. Everyone else turned to their alpha.
“Alcoholic.”
“Shit,” Clint repeated, causing Tony to burst out laughing. “Damn you’re big.” Tony narrowed his eyes. “Wait. That didn’t come out right you’re not even that big you’re just bigger than last time. Fatter- wait.”
“Because I’m Bruce’s friend. It won’t be anything else.”
“When was your birthday?!”
“I still can’t believe you smoke.”
“Well, it worked. Now you shouldn’t lose it.” Tony shrugged.
“At least I have a buddy now. I think the others get bored coming out here and standing with me.” Bucky lit up a cigarette as Tony took out a pre-rollup he had done earlier. He was a genius after all.
“We should get going. We don’t want to miss dinner, though it’s Clint’s night so no doubt it will be some form of fast food instead of an actual meal.” Bruce finished off his coffee. “Plus, Steve will want to see you as soon as possible.”
Loki Laufeyson: Beta Snow Leopard
“Oh no, Tony has to go home. You lot have had enough fun tonight.” The alpha shook his head, briefly looking over at the three wolves that had pouts. “No ganging up on me, this isn’t fair.”
A gasp left the omega’s lips. “No more hanging out with JARVIS. You’ve become way too sassy.”
The pack were all set up and all in the car, well minivan, ready to leave for SHIELD by the time Steve was ready. Bruce had shown the omega to his seat so he could ride back with them. Steve would normally drive but Clint decided to do it so Steve and Tony could be together with Natasha and Thor in the front with him. Bruce took the window seat in the middle row, Tony sitting beside him with the seat next to him left free for Steve. Loki, Sam and Bucky took the back seats.
“You and me both.” Fire muttered. “So, you’re pregnant?”
Steve let out a sigh of relief upon seeing the sleeping omega, head on the island table, arms sprawled out, hair ruffled as if Tony had been running his hand through it repeatedly. The omega had one of Clint’s arrows in one hand, a screwdriver in the other. A blanket was draped around him, causing the blonde’s eyebrows to furrow.
“I’m really confused.” Tony yawned, rubbing one of his eyes. “Why were you worried?”
“Or else you would just drive.” Natasha finished off Bruce’s statement.
Time soon passed and over half the food had been eaten, most of the champagne had been drunk, mainly by Tony, and the alpha and omega were cuddling up to one another. Tony let out a content sigh, fingers tracing random patterns on Steve’s chest as his merry thoughts swirled.
“I missed you too.” Steve held the omega close, leading him over to the bed. “What made you create the bots?” Steve asked, looking at one that had landed on the bed.
“I love you, you know that, right?” Tony smiled, looking at the alpha.
Tony nodded, taking the folder from the delta and opening it up to peek inside. He took out his new ID card, taking note of the papers inside, potential pieces of information and contracts, before putting it back on the table. “I’ll check it out later, let’s get to work.”
“Still want to play?” Both their heads snapped up to look at the omega, Tony bowed again to them and they returned it. “Just try not to scare Steve anymore.”
“Okay.” Natasha sighed. “Tell me where to bring him.”
“Excuse me?” Brock sounded offended, turning to Tony.
“What do you mean?” Panic settled into Steve. Tony hadn’t come home.
“Sorry about that man. I guess I am a little bit overprotective of Tones here.” Rhodey held out a hand as Tony cuddled into his side, snorting at the expression of ‘a little bit’.
This was Steve’s problem with being such a relaxed alpha. He didn’t like to have too much control and power over his packmates. He had seen too many alphas be harsh and abusive to the shifters that should be regarded as family, which led to their pack being fragile and fearing their alpha. But sometimes Steve was too carefree with his pack, which lead to moments like this happening fairly often and the pack ranks blurring. The deltas, Clint especially, wouldn’t always listen to those higher up. Not even Steve’s own betas would from time to time. Thor, who was an alpha, tended to listen more to Steve than any of the others, with Nat and Bruce being close behind when they weren’t messing with Clint.
“And you’ll be waiting a lot longer for your stuff that way. I’m fine. Don’t worry about it.”
Tony laughed at that, watching as Natasha and Bruce went to help Clint with their takeaway order. The three of them brought in the food, the smell filling the room making Tony’s stomach growl. The omega sat up, shuffling away from the alpha so he could get his food.
“Tony, you only need to be yourself. Everyone loves you. Even Natasha and Loki, though he hasn’t admitted it, I know he cares deep down somewhere.”
Realisation suddenly hit Bruce to why Steve was being so strange. He had been around an omega wolf all day, he must have Tony’s scent all over him, and Steve was just reacting in the way any other unmated alpha would.
“I really tried to get rid of the smell.” Tony frowned. “Rhodey and Tyler have cuddled with me.”
Steve blushed fiercely, trying not to think too much about the omega being a different reason why he was hot and sweaty. There had been a few times where Tony had sent a few suggestive texts and each time he reacted in the same way. Last time it was in front of Bucky, which had the beta laughing so hard he fell off the couch as the alpha tried to hide his embarrassment and semi-hardon.
This one is quite short but I wanted to leave it there for now. I'm loving everyone's little theories.
"Well I have a pretty strong theory, I just need to know the answer to one question."
“No, but seriously, Steve, soon I won’t be able to use stairs anymore. I’m eighteen weeks pregnant now and I’m shattered.”
All of the holograms shut down immediately, Tony grabbing DIEGO and his jacket and shrugging it on. He turned the bot on, DIEGO beeping at the brunette. The omega left his workshop and went next door to Bruce’s lab, knocking once before popping his head inside.
“You eavesdrop all the time on the pack.” Steve pointed the wooden spoon at the redhead.
“Let me help.” Bruce sighed, going over to help Tony take off his shoes and placing his discarded accessories on the bedside table as the omega’s laughs subsided. “I’m going to get you some water and then I have to go.”
“I-I’m fine.” The brunette was taken aback as the female alpha helped him up, dusting him off.
“Bacon?”
“I’ll sort it.” The alpha looked over at the receptionist before turning to Tony. “Follow me.”
I found pictures of the animals that I have based everyone on, and I was wondering if you would want me to post them (as an extra chapter at the end of the book) or if you would rather leave it to your imagination. I'm not sure if I'm going to describe any of the other's in wolf form yet, so if I don't that might be a good chance for people to see them.
I have finally decided to update. Oops, I'm sorry for it being so late. I hope you enjoy it!
“And you know he’s cranky,” Sam replied, lying back down.
“At this point, I might just let her.” The beta laughed before there was a loud crash, causing Thor to stir but not wake up.
“This was a mistake.” Steve groaned, hitting his head on the table.
Steve kept silent, causing the omega to sit up, grabbing his phone and the champagne bottle. Tony chugged on the last bit of champagne before scrolling through his phone to his music app and pulled up a romance playlist, shrugging as Steve looked over in confusion and concern.
“I-I had selective mutism at the time, I couldn’t speak to any shifters except a few omegas and some humans, due to my traumatic time being around alphas and betas… I was also diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I had frequent panic attacks which could happen at any time, anything could have triggered them. One time I had one in the toilets, I was alone, and I thought I was going to die, but then someone was there to help me, it was Brooke. She helped me through my attack and took me back to the hospital building just behind SHIELD. Even though I couldn’t speak to her, she visited every day for weeks, even if we just sat in silence for hours. Eventually, after a few months, we would have whole conversations on note pads, I just couldn’t believe how kind this alpha was to me and one day, as she was leaving, I just said, “thank you”, subconsciously on my own. Brooke didn’t make a big deal about it, but the smile on her face said everything. After she left, I realised after knowing her for six months, I was falling in love and it caused me to have a panic attack, the biggest one since I was rescued.”
Bruce nodded. “Yeah… He seems pretty interested in Steve too.”
“Can I get you a drink, Tony?” Natasha asked, turning to the wolf next to her.
“You heard my mate. Get out of our house.” Steve stood up from his spot, going around to Tony’s side.
“We can just send the Hulk running through the walls.”
Tony poked at his pasta. He was alone in the SHIELD cafeteria after having his therapy session. It had been three months since Tony had a panic attack in his workshop and two weeks after that day, he had started therapy sessions twice a week. At first, Tony was scared and didn’t think it would do him much good. But as the sessions went on, things got easier and it was nice for him to offload.
“I have no idea what you’re on about, Miss Potts. I am always punctual.” Tony retorts back.
Steve looked hurt at that. But it was the truth.
Bruce slowly opened his eyes, squinting at the harsh light of the room. He had fallen asleep at Tony’s place. He knew he shouldn’t have but the delta felt guilty to wake up the sleeping wolf, and in all honesty, he was just too comfortable to move. Looking down at the dark brown mop of hair on his chest, the beta let out a huff as he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. It was most likely what had woken him up in the first place. Careful not to wake up Tony, Bruce took out his phone to see Clint’s caller ID on the screen and answered it.
Bruce arrived back at the packhouse a lot later than planned. Time passed by so quickly with Tony around. After lunch, the pair had made their way up to Agent Coulson’s office to confirm the omega’s stay, on which he asked to work closely with Bruce, which shocked the delta. For years, ever since his accident Bruce had shifters of all types avoiding him as much as possible. They could sense there was something different, something wrong and unnatural with him. It was a shock when he was asked to form the Avengers pack. But Steve had insisted he joined the pack after working with him. Agent Coulson had told the alpha about the scientist, yet he didn’t treat him any differently and took him in as a delta in his pack.
The wolf was just about to leave the room when there was a knock at the door. Looking over to the door he slowly walked over and opened it up. He had no idea who was going to be there. Maybe a guide so he can find room 4.12? Most likely. There was a blonde female human standing in the hall, a smile on her face.
Tony hadn’t done any work since they started at half-past nine that morning. The omega kept coming into Bruce’s lab, now he had his workshop, just to pester the delta about Steve and fuss over tonight. So, Bruce ever so kindly told him to leave, but maybe not so kindly and possibly with a swear word that had Tony shocked that Bruce would ever use that language.
Strucker didn’t seem convinced.
“I probably shouldn’t.” The omega gave a dry laugh, letting the bot fly over to Bruce. “I’ll see you at home.”
Tony spun around, growling up at the dark-haired male. The omega looked tiny whilst standing in front of the alpha, he was around half a foot taller than him, and poked a finger on the man’s chest with each word he spoke, his face fierce. “You. Don’t. Touch. Me.”
“He shouldn’t have to worry.” Tony frowned as Bruce gave him a look. “Hey, I’m moving in, I have a right to be panicky.”
“You are now, Brucie.”
“I’m sorry Steve. No one should have gone through that.” Tony ran a hand through Steve’s hair. He hated to think of what that must have been like. Losing both parents at a young age and then a group of guys that took him and his best friend in too. Steve had been through a lot but was still out there helping others with SHIELD and formed an unlikely pack.
Clint was the first to strip down, Tony kept his eyes down on the ground, he didn’t dare look. He wasn’t allowed in his old pack and he didn’t want to push his luck with this one. Tony glanced up hoping that everyone had shifted now. There were two wolves now, chasing once another, who Tony deduced were Sam and Clint as Loki and Bruce were still fully dressed and Thor was shirtless.
“Clint, we want him to join the pack, not scare him away. Dinner would be a nightmare.” Nat spoke up, not looking away from her phone.
“I can’t give away my secrets Brucie.” Tony giggled, swaying a little.
“Pepper…” Tony sat up with a sigh.
“Steve? Come on Rogers!” Bucky called as he stepped through the automatic doors to the cafeteria. After no response, he called again “Steve!”
“Thanks, magic boy.”
He had no idea why he was so wound up by the situation. In most cases, he could just brush it off, pretend things are fine and keep a level head about things. But not this time. It wasn’t that big of a deal too. Steve had just wanted to make sure Tony was safe. Alpha’s had done worse to their mates.
Steve heard the front door open, head-turning in the direction towards it. It’s was almost 7 pm, meaning Bruce and Tony would be back from work. He sniffed, frowning when he couldn’t smell the omega’s scent.
Steve and Tony had ice creams the same colour as each other's eyes and I both hate and love myself for being that cheesy.
“I’m not going to banish you from seeing me Tony. I like you way too much to do that. I rushed over here to see you because I missed you so much.” Steve gave a small smile.
“It is a day for celebration!” Thor grinned, picking up Bucky with ease, and moving the beta out of his way so he could get to the cake. “Tony must cut the cake so we can eat it.”
“You’re twenty minutes out from the edge of the city, Sir. It’s a thirty-minute drive back to SHIELD HQ.” The AI responded.
Bucky and Pietro left as Steve turned to the door. The blonde knocked on the door, listening out for any response.
“Wow, you really love that shield, don’t you?” Tony laughed. Steve looked over in confusion before walking over to Tony. The omega opened a drawer and taking out a glove that he ‘borrowed’ from Steve earlier in the week. Tony handed the glove over to the blonde, Steve staring at it in confusion.
“Come on.” Rhodey picked up the omega despite his protests. “I’ll get you food on the way back.” The alpha bargained, which made Tony stop wiggling around.
The three of them walked inside, everyone else was drunk, or at least halfway there. There was a mix of humans and shifters. Tyler led them through the crowd, walking into the kitchen where there was a range of alcoholic beverages littered across the countertops. Tony had brought his own, a bottle of rum, but it probably wouldn’t last the night. Rhodey and Tyler both went for a can of beer, Tony opening his bottle and taking a swig.
“Hey everyone.” Tony smiled. “This is James and Tyler.” He pointed to each of them.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice was serious.
“I’ll stay in the quinjet if you want, I can be back up. I’ll be fine.”
Clint cancelled the episode of Rick and Morty, causing Thor to pout as the delta scrolled through his Netflix list to put on the movie. Tony smiled, playing with Steve’s fingers as the movie began, the tale of the ring began. They were around forty minutes in when there was a knock at the door, Clint pausing the movie to get up and answer.
“I have no idea. Do you think he's run away?”
“No stripping.” Rhodey teased, an arm wrapping around Tony’s shoulders.
“Cap, Loki and I have found two bodies. HYDRA agents.” Bucky muttered.
The evening soon came about and the omega had shifted into his wolf form to go for a walk. He wasn’t planning to be out for long. Probably ten or fifteen minutes at most, just for some alone time.
“Widow, is Strucker still unconscious?” Steve spoke down the comms.
“What’s wrong?” One guard asked as the two of them ran into the room.
“Well if you keep being good, I might surprise you with even more stuff I can do,” Tony smirked, stepping into the elevator.
“Omega.”
“Oh.” Was all Steve could say. He was going to question it further, but maybe at another time, when Tony wasn’t quite so drunk.
I didn't forget about Bruce! I just didn't want him to get into a fight because you know, anger and all.
Tony blushed, ducking his head down at the compliment. “It’s okay. I know we can’t help it. It’s a pain in the ass.”
“Access denied.”
Rhodey was the first one to stick his hand out. “Rhodey. Tony is my best friend… He’s like a little brother to me.”
Fur colour: Brownish (summer), Greyish (winter) with dark black rosettes and spots covering his head, back, legs and tail and a white underbelly
“Steve?” The brunette called out hesitantly. “JARVIS? Anyone?” Tony sniffed the air, unable to pick up a familiar scent, but picking up an unknown omega.
Steve stepped back, allowing Tony to come face-to-face with Bruce’s wolf form. The omega managed to swallow a gasp, looking up at the wolf. Bruce’s wolf form was bigger than Steve, around the same size as Thor. His fur was grey but had a slight greenish tint to it. Tony remembered that Bruce mentioned something about radiation which explained the colour. Hulk, as Steve had called him, leaned in closer to Tony’s face, sniffing the omega. Steve stayed at his side, ready to interject if needed.
“I had Bruce bring home something that would smell of the omega, just to see if Steve would continue to act in the same way and confirm mine and Tasha’s suspicions” Clint grinned mischievously. “Stevie wants some omega lovin’.”
“Ugh, don’t remind me. I’m
The female omega spotted Bruce in the hallway, he was leaning against Tony’s door, knocking on it. As she approached, she could hear him trying to talk to the other omega through the door.
“Well, I’m in.” Sam grinned, to which Clint leant over and high-fived him. Bucky nodded too.
“I think you should know that we were also the SHIELD agents that were sent to rescue you.” The delta smiled small, shuffling closer to Tony.
“Let’s go home, yeah?” Steve placed a kiss on top of the omega’s head. “Clint?”
“My babies.” Tony grinned, as the five small red and gold robots hummed to life, beeping and chirping at their daddy as they swarmed around him.
“How does he sleep through so much but he’s never in any danger?” Bucky shook his head. “I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Oh.” Tony’s eyes widened a little, looking at the beta.
And pizza is what they had. The bots had settled down now, Steve Jr sitting on Tony’s lap as he ate a slice of meat feast pizza, eyes glued to the screen. They were watching Jurassic Park and were at the part of where the T-Rex is about to attack. Tony had come to the conclusion a long time ago that if his children were this dumb, he would let them get eaten. A T-Rex is coming and you’re flashing a light and screaming? You’re just begging it to eat you at that point.
Tony was just a few places in front of the alpha, laughing at the two agents before laughing at himself as he tripped over a rock. Steve took a deep breath before speeding up to catch up to the smaller male, smiling at him softly.
“Details.” The omega waved a hand.
Sam groaned. “Aren’t those movies four hours long?”
“You’re my favourite.”
“He’s not here.” Steve shook his head. “I’ve been here since four and Thor has been here all day. He’s not been here. Where is he?”
“I am not annoying.”
Tony nodded. “I found out just before I was kidnapped. I was going to tell my mate when I got home but that’s going to have to wait now. He’s going to be going crazy.”
It wasn’t long before Sam and Clint ran into trouble. Sam had shifted into his wolf form to take them out up close, Clint firing arrows at them from a distance.
“Hey yourself, beautiful.” The large male reached out to touch Tony again as the omega moved back.
Tony took a tentative step forward before tilting his head up, a hand going up to cup the back of Steve’s neck and pull the alpha down into a kiss. Steve’s hands found their way to Tony’s waist, his grip tightening a little as the omega played with the hairs at the nape of the alpha’s neck. Tony pulled back from the kiss, giving a quick peck to the alpha’s jaw before tucking his face into the male’s neck.
“Steve, I love you too.”
The blonde alpha nodded. “I understand.” He sent Tony an apologetic smile. “Maybe another time?”
Tony shrugged. “Fine, just miss getting to hang out with her all the time.”
“I don’t want you to feel pressured to do it.”
“I didn’t realise how much SI needed you, Tony.”
“Just a lemonade, please,” Bruce said, looking at the bartender who gave a nod before preparing the drinks.
“That’s fine Tony. Where are you going?” Steve asked.
“Okay, time to stop.” Tony finished up and tidied up his space, knowing Bruce would kill him if he left it as he would have done normally.
“You’ll let me come back to work?”
“Let him go.” Steve stepped forward.
Tony looked over at the back door, wondering what Steve was doing. The omega looked over at Bruce, who only shrugged in response, unsure on what the alpha wolf was doing too. The two of them walked back to the chest, Natasha and Bucky had both shifted now.
“Thank you, JARVIS.”
“And no one else in your pack?”
“Steve, we really don’t have to do anything.”
“Come on, little omega. Don’t reject it. Come back with me.” He was blonde and had blue eyes, like Steve but he wasn’t anything like him. His scent wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t as welcoming and amazing as Steve’s. This alpha wasn’t as attractive and would be okay for a one-night stand, but the omega wasn’t interested.
“Please don’t. I don’t want to talk about it anymore, I just felt strong enough to tell you, but I don't want to go there again.” Steve only nodded in reply, pulling Tony against his chest once more, tucking the omega underneath his chin. Tony let out a small laugh. “I was meant to be comforting you.”
“I’m shifting!”
“It’s not that much different from your usual quinjet,” Clint said, flipping some switches, frowning when the lights didn’t turn on as supposed to.
“Suit up guys, SHIELD has called us all in on a mission. We need to meet up at HQ. I’ll see you all back down here in five.”
“We good to go?” Bucky asked, walking over.
“Oh, thank you.” The alpha’s cheeks reddened. “But why are we still whispering?”
Tammi: Omega Wolf
“Tell him I’m on my way,” Steve replied, taking one last look at Tony crouching besides Peter, intensely listening to the young delta talk about the stuff he had tried to make before and all the stuff he wanted to make now.
“Steve.”
Tony let out a groan as Steve stepped into the room, putting down his mug. This was going to be fun.
Tony shook the thought away as Steve walked over, showing him to a car. He was Bruce’s friend and just invited him over for that, there was nothing more between the two.
Bucky gave Sam the finger before smiling at Tony who was looking at the pair amused. “Come on, we’ll give you a short tour.”
The restaurant was split into two halves, just like Clint had said. One side was the restaurant side and the other was like a bar/club. A wall split the two in half, with doors having 21+ on them. There was a bar that was a circle in the middle of the building, half on the restaurant side and the other half on the club side, splitting the two but allowing the bar staff to move from one side to the other to handle both customers. The club side wasn’t open yet, but as soon as it was, Tony was going to have a look.
“They call me Cookie.”
The alpha let out a grunt, shifting a little. “What time is it?”
Tony left SHIELD HQ and made his way around to the back of the building so he could get to SHIELD Medical. He walked straight up to the desk, biting his lip as the receptionist looked up at him, pausing from her typing. She was human, the name 'Suzie' on her name badge.
Tony and Pepper talk about Tony's past.
The delta cheered as the two of them left the motel. There was a petrol station next to the motel which sold all sorts of food. The two shifters walked inside and started grabbing snacks to keep the eight of them going. They wouldn’t be staying here for much longer and they could ger some proper food to re-stock the Quinjet once they took down the HYDRA base.
“Yeah, you’ll probably only need this floor,” Sam added on. “The basement is for training and upstairs are just bedrooms and bathrooms.”
“We’re lucky that we got one of these. They’re much better.” Tony noted as the other wolf sat on the opposite side, looking around the bar.
“It would be rude to blow-off dinner,” Tony replied.
“Tony.” He held out a hand for Anna to shake, which she did before introducing everyone else.
Steve nodded. “I was going to go over there after I speak to Fury, to see if I can find anything.”
I'm back! Not gonna lie I hated writing this chapter. I've come to the conclusion that I cannot write action to save my life, so I don't like this chapter at all. I am sorry. I literally re-wrote this chapter from scratch seven times. I'm really not exaggerating -one time it didn't even save too so you know, a waste of time. I apologise now for the shockingly bad chapter. I really don't like it. I have also been doing uni work -which I hate so yay! And have started on like four new stevetony fics that I said I wouldn't do until I finished this one but here we are. I'll write a bit about them in the chapter notes at the end to see if anyone would be interested.
“You guys go ahead. Get whatever you think we will need, supplies included. Nat, Buck, I trust you to handle it. I’ve got to make some calls.”
“I didn’t want anyone making a big deal out of it. It’s just another day.” Tony shrugged.
“It’s been some time since I’ve had a good night out.” Natasha shrugged. “Let’s do it.”
Thank you for all the kudus, reads and comments. I honestly can't believe how much attention and positive feedback I have received from this as it is my first fic and all.
Steve was over the moon with happiness.
Howard betrayal hurt so much that there were days Maria could barely function. She was a mess. She wished she could rip her heart out of her chest
Tony just nodded.
Tony realized it too and quickly jumped to his friend’s defence. There was a difference between being cautious and trying to force someone to remain calm if anything that route could lead to the opposite.
Part of Tony arching to prove Howard was wrong about Captain fucking perfect, that Rogers was just as pig-headed as most male alpha Tony had the displeasure of knowing- blinded by ego, sexist, controlling and treated and Omega like a possession instead of a living, breathing person.
Now he needed to plan the defensive measures and fortifications of the tower upgrade. Pepper had suggested he put the bracelets-linked to Tony’s bio-signature that would call the new remote armor-in strategic locations around the Tower.
He had seen the reflection. The man in his dream looked like him but much taller, with night-black hair, and ocean-blue eyes that brimming with happiness and love... Not him!
"I guess we'll find out," Tony challenged, walked back across the lab to his desk.
Anthony felt their bond pulsed between them, raw, real, and with roots deep enough to wrap around and penetrate his brain, heart, and some deeper part of him he couldn’t name. The force of emotion flowed between them like an impossible two-way river. Warm fluttered and spark spread like wildfire through their body and set off fireworks in their curiously empty skull. Like Ambrosia, it addicted his mind, body, and senses completely.
Steve flipped a couple of switches that were flashing rapidly. "Okay, the relays are intact," he reported. "What's our next move?" he asked, shoving the panel back into its original place.
The alarms blared as the storm started picking up. Only a moment later the plane shook as a heavy thump smashed onto the ship from above their heads.
The paintings were a jewel in their own right. The old paint still bright and gleaming as if it was enameled. They also had a tempura panel.
Steve could hear the smile in Tony’s voice as he finished Bruce’s sentence. "Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect."
It took a while before he let the reality sink in. The real reason Howard, his father gave him so much pain was never because he wasn’t good enough. It was because he knew…he fucking knew his son who was from the lowest caste, an Omega, would outshine his skill at a young age and he hated it. Hated it so much that he taught a child that physical blows hurt but words could wound for a lifetime and shown him how much he didn’t deserve to be loved all before Tony reached kindergartens.
Steven growled with animalistic zeal and drove into him. The sensation echoed, a feeling like penetrating and being penetrated at once, and both of them moaned. Steven rolled his hips. Every point of contact between them was exploded with sensation. The heat of Steven’s pleasure buzzed through Anthony and set his veins on fire. His bare chest was hot against Steven’s bare chest. How the hell they became bare. He didn’t know. He didn’t care. He couldn’t think. Grasped his hair in both hands, he arched against him, taking him, squeezed around him.
Steve explained to Tony that he didn’t know what the dreaded video entailed and just pretend to know so he could… well, so he could hurt Tony. “I was in a really bad place but it didn’t excuse what I said.” Steve’s eyes were burning with an indefinable intensity. “I am sorry.”
“We are! The model lock and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we got a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.” Bruce said calmed and evenly, pointed to another monitor.
They ran past Maria, who was trying to keep the bridge as calm as possible and heard her speaking through the earpiece.
Bruce laughed at that, disagreed. "Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve." Bruce lowered his eyes. "It's a nightmare," He said with resignation, misery and bitterness, shook his head slightly like he was trying to get rid of a bad dream.
Steve looked shocked but his eyes glimmered with newfound hope. Fury couldn’t help but felt sorry for the guy because chances were Stark would hate him on principle.
White hot-triumph race through Steve, Tony looked like he had shot him straight in the heart.
Before he even realized it, he found himself heading to the lab Tony working in. Tony made his blood boil with rage, but he also made him want, made him feel alive again. He needed to see what the other half of his soul was up to. He wanted to be near Tony.
At 30 years old, Maria Stark was one of the most beautiful, high-level Omega around and the object of envy of other Omegas and Betas. After all, she was the Omega who captured the heart of the great Howard Stark. Captured, past tense because pictures of Howard and his mistress made it to the front page of the news.
Beta by: Virgilia Coriolanus
“Irredeemable man,” her voice simmered with indulgent affection. “I know you’d make that joke,”
Steve scowled “The bond is…”
Tony broke the chain Howard had over him when he was 17. What he didn’t see is the chain Obie had on him. Leading him to continued Howard weapon business despite never liking or has any attachment to weapon. No Tony love making things like circuit board, as in computer, car engines, robots and A.I. If he had been anyone else’s kid, or allowed to make his own choices, he would’ve gone the route of Steve Jobs, or Bill Gates. He never really cared about weapons.
There was a hint of worry in her voice, “These guys come from legend. They're basically gods.”
"And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster." Tony gripped tight to the other man’s hand, the gleamed of interest so evident in his eyes. It took a moment for Bruce to realize Tony wasn’t mocking him.
This was wrong, it wasn’t something he expected from his father when he showed him his first artificial intelligence Dum-E.
Bruce tried to bring the situation away from another pissing contest, directed his comments to the captain.
"You know damn well why!" Rogers yelled molten fury turned his eyes from rich velvet to sharp jet. "Back off!" A raw, real growl ripped from his throat with animalistic fury.
Steven Thorne was one of the best Impressionists. Tony read his biographies. They were largely about his career as it took off once he became one of the Impressionists. It was mention that he was married to a notorious Omega. The paintings of his twin-flame and later husband were dismissed as being unimportant compared to his later works. JARVIS had traced the owner of both of the paintings. He ordered his A.I. to buy those paintings.
Even all the perfume in the world couldn’t sweetened his hands. The only thing that help him slept was helping and saving people and atoning, atoning and keep atoning his sins in every way he could think of.
Loki just laughed raucously at him.
Hot anger dropped into Maria’s stomach like a bucket of coals. Tony saw his mom grab his dad’s arm only to be slapped hard. Losing her balance, his mom fell on the floor.
Ecstasy soon evolved into horror as he realized that something was very wrong with the way Tony plummeted towards the ground, he was not slowing down. He must be unconscious or otherwise unable to stop.
Sighing he got up, carefully getting out of bed, tried not to wake his deeply asleep lover. He went lazily to the shower, showered and dressed then took an elevator to his lab. Turned on the coffeemaker, he asked JARVIS to play his usual music.
Unfortunately, he was also an untameable playboy who became infamous for his tendencies to party, drink and had been in many headlines as a virile domineering omega that commanded the attention of multiple alphas, omegas, and betas alike. Tony had a reputation as Manhattan’s biggest Omega slut.
Tony tried to overpower Thor's strong punches, only served to get his wrists ensnared in his stronger grip. The blond squeezed hard around Iron Man’s left arm and buckling the shapes and electrics inside.
"What's up, Rogers?" The soldier walked toward him with determined strides, got into his personal space. Steve’s nearness setting fire to his skin.
It was like they had six senses on what each other would do in battle and could work seamlessly with each other during missions. Steve, annoyingly made a habit to check the team for injury after a battle, and thanks to the blasted bond Steve could sense when Tony was lying about being okay.
(See the end of the chapter for
The two scientists carried on staring at each other for a moment. "Nothing?" Tony asked despite already suspecting the answer. He figured that if the guy had enough control to go for, over a year, without incident in areas most people would stress out in, he would stay in control.
Natasha “I'd sit this one out, Cap.”
Eventually, the guards boxed him at familiar streets of Times Square that glimmered with a colorful, unfamiliar facade.
Steve still felt uneasy by how easily Loki had surrendered.
Steve’s laugh was harsh and bitter as he began viciously ram into the new punching bag, trying to tire his emotions out, to wring them out of his heart. “I failed to protect Bucky.” there was a ripping sound coming from the bag. A thin trickle of sand was flowing out from a hole where his knuckle had been slamming into.
‘I had subdued the bond once when I was just a primary school student. I can, I will do it all over again!’ He ignored something inside of him, telling him it would never be like it was before now that Steve was here…
He got what he wanted, Rogers’ true color, and it was so much easier to do what he needed to do now. The odd and tangled emotion he felt must be a relief. It couldn't be a disappointment.
The night Fury informed Steve of his true soul-mate.
“A Twin Flame soul-bound.’’ Tony forced out because Pepper deserved to know the full truth.
There was something left for him in this world after all…
Tony rocket-sheaded into the electric-blue tear in the sky to the darkness beyond.
It pained him to see the little things Tony would do for Thor and Bruce like making a cabinet in the kitchen wholly dedicated to the various flavors special brand of tea for Bruce and Pop-Tarts for Thor.  He even prepared a zen garden and a green-house for his Brucie-bear. Not to mention making time to play chest with Bruce and watched period dramas with Thor despite his busy schedule. All this coupled with the fact that most of Tony’s past lover was... Beta made Steve wondered if Tony would prefer if his soulmate was Bruce instead.
Steve recognized them from when Coulson had shown them on the way to the Helicarrier. Seeing them on the table, stained with blood made his body felt numb, another good man died because of war. He reached and picked one up, a card with a picture of him as Captain America. It was a reminder of the only thing he still had, and everything he had lost. To the surrounding agents, he appeared to be sitting stoically in his seat, but inside, his soul was weeping earnestly in agony.
Her admission pricked him. "What was that supposed to mean? We were dating. We were together. You were meant to be angry. Why weren't you angry?"
Then he pushed past the last pair of shoulders, drew himself close to the Omega. His soulmate’s scent was powerful, the ambrosial smoky-woody-floral smell that had bypassed his brain and went straight to his cock.
Sorry Tony was harsh but to be fair a lot of his hurt was cause by Obie and Howard and they are both alphas. And Obie is a high level Alpha-and in this universe the more high level the alpha was the more they usually sought to be top dog. Not that being Alphas are bad-Tony just had bad luck with relationships and sometime friends ex Tiberius.
22 Painting of the past
“Don’t.” Tony cut him off. “Just don’t Rogers. This can never work out.”
“Kneel before me.” Loki stamped his scepter on the ground and his and the other Lokis’ scepter glow. You could hear several screams but the rest of the crowd remain still as a stone “I said…” his voice laced with anger.
A mask-less Captain America and helmetless Iron Man stood in the back keeping an eye on their captive while Black Widow flew the Quinjet.
Just the thought of it made him felt ill. He had enough of the bond for one lifetime. He had lost both his parent’s love because of it, had become the object of their hatred and disdain because of it. And now that stupid bond tried to come between him and Pepper. NO fucking way he would let that happened!
Howard being a multimillionaire and a legend in his field, Maria was induct into a life of comfort, fame and luxury of every women dreamt.
He… Anthony looked older and fully dressed in the second painting. Anthony’s eyes shone with great contentment, his face was plump with goodness and the happiness of an Omega who had ended up with everything he wanted. Tony briefly wondered how he looked right now.
Tony’s voice, his scent, and his touch seeped into Steve’s soul, filling the emptiness in his heart.
There was nothing conscious of Steve's decision to follow his soulmate. He simply did, obeying his primal imperative.
Genre: Romance /Angst
“But you know what; you didn’t deserve the title Captain America or the best superhero ever. You weren’t 1/20 of the man I once believed you were! I knew men that don’t have the serum but was ten times the person you were!” Tony spat acidly. “You openly call other’s ethics and morality out as a sham when you couldn’t even see your flaw! ” a real hero would never agree with Shield keeping a video that could ruin all his effort for a much better world let alone rubbed it all over his face!
No matter how progressive Howard said Rogers was, he was still a 1940 male alpha and there was no way an ultimate alpha would ever take the lying down after being riled up by a mere Omega especially one who would be in his team and didn’t even made the team the first cut.
Tony’s eyelids fluttered as they started to open revealing oceanic blue eyes that held Steve's entrance. His incredibly beautiful husband stared at him with such a loving gaze and planted a sweet kiss on his lips. “I love you”.
“Why? Why couldn’t I be enough for you? This wasn’t the life you promised me.” Her voice was broken.
“Put on the suit...” Steve said again, and it was starting to seriously piss Tony off. Forget about having Rogers broke his bones; he was SO KICKING HIS ASS!
All his love and his desperation for Howard's approval turned into anger and resentment. It suddenly made perfect sense. Howard would always love Captain America because he was the product and symbol of his genius. He would always hate Tony because his son represented everything he hated, his genius being replaced by better future generation and his gene failure in producing an Alpha and produced an Omega instead.
Tony didn’t pretend to be a hero. He knew he would never be one. He was just a man with a mission, trying to redeem himself. His life post-Afghanistan was all about putting to rights everything he had done wrong. But Rogers had openly called Tony’s ethics and morality out as a sham and that was when he lost any shred of guilt or pity he still had for the soldier.
“Let's go a few rounds,” Steve challenged, shoulders braced, he was practically spat with fury.
Tony Stark turned to face him with a deceptively innocent smile. “Uh... kind of been wondering the same thing about you.”
Steve frowned at that, not sure how to answer. Tony nodded, thought Rogers might be coming round to their line of thought.
Howard didn’t answer her and tried to walk away.
Tony was bristling. 'How is that not offensive? It stings Bruce even though he tries to hide it.'
“See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could." Fury went on. He turned to Tony who still turned away from him. “Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea." Fury let out each word as if he was weighed them. “… In heroes.” He let the sadness leaked into his voice again as he finished, looked at Steve.
Tony's pulse roared in his ears; beating like dragonfly wings. Instinctively Steve found the key to unlocking the repress desire and longing in the brunet. Tony made inarticulate frenzied noises, all of his passion unleashed and uncoiled at last. He was kissing Steve like a magnet springing to steel, irresistible and natural as the tide.
"That's not the point." Steve replied quietly, trying not aggravated the brunet.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice sounded like a prayer.
Natasha and Fury’s hands itched down to grab their guns again.
Feeling sick with guilt, really Pepper didn’t deserve this. Tony got soundlessly to his feet and moved to the bathroom, cursed, and took a shower.
“Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr. Banner back to his...”
The downside they usually consider as boring and less desirable/sexual attractive/Sexual charge as mate compare to Alpha or Omega.
Howard made him believe that he would never be smart enough, never measure up to his expectation, and never, ever be good enough for his father.
He walked closer to the screens, scrunched his brow before covered one eye for a moment and raised his eyebrows.
Pre-serum: average -54% alpha
Steve remained calm. This wasn’t the time for verbal jousting; he would clear it out with Tony when everything calmed down. "He got the same blood on his hands that Loki did." He took a step closer.
But Steve wasn’t listening anymore. He hastily grabbed his shield and dashed towards the hatch. He leaped out of the Quinjet after his wayward Twin-soul. Now, why did this felt like a dejavu?
"I think it's about the mechanics. Iridium, What do they need Iridium for?" A new voice said, the tone soft, calm and a little insecure… Doc. Banner.
“24.” That was surprising, Anthony looked like he couldn’t be older than 19. He must have rejected plenty of marriage offers. Omegas especially male and high-level ones usually married before they even reached 19.
"So you're saying that the hulk... the other guy saved my life?" Bruce looked down and sighed softly. He wetted his lips nervously before he spoke again. "That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?" Bruce asked, looked up at Tony again.
‘Don’t you leave me, Tony. You will not leave me.’
Tony and Natasha: Dominant high level Omega
Then the dream promptly turned into… the DREAM every night...
Tony continued, liking the look of Steve’s face even as the bond railed against him. Then he smirked and delivered the final blow to Roger’s humongous pride. “You would rather be my dead father’s soulmate. HAH, I would RATHER GO CELIBATE FOR LIFE than even entertain the idea of being with you!” Rogers would break more than a couple of his bones for this!
Steve’s expression was surprisingly soft, tender. His stomach filled with newly awakened butterflies, a strong fluttering that felt so familiar. Just looked at the perfection that was his husband - hell, even thinking the word husband- made his heart fluttered like a hummingbird tried to escape its cage. If he didn’t already know he was dreaming, he would pinch himself.
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ¬ DAY
Suddenly she heard Stark's voice from the Quinjet’s comm “Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?”
Thor glared, smirking darkly as he swung his hammer round to gain traction. Before it could build momentum Tony shot a blast into the Asgardian's chest with a relatively weak repulsor blast. He didn’t want to seriously hurt/kill the Alien prince and started an intergalactic war.
“Doc. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.” Fury said sternly to Stark as he walked in.
Maria had severe bleeding after childbirth and was given a hysterectomy to save her life. All she could focus was that she could never give birth again. She had failed Howard. How unlucky was Maria to be among 0.05-0.1% of woman to fell victim.
To put it simply, both file and video of Tony Stark showed him in a very detail way as, having a god-given genius but he was a self-destructive, self-obsess asshole, who didn’t follow orders and couldn’t work well with others. Tony had defied the government and the army on multiple occasions that he should have been put to jail or charge for treason. ‘Iron Man yes… Tony Stark NO.’
"You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart." Tony didn't look up as he was talking, tapped the clothed arc reactor with his fingertips.
Loki looked so shocked to be told that. He just bared his reasons why he was hurt to the oaf and the best Thor could give him back was "imagined slights"?!
That was the first time he finally admitted to himself that there was no going back to how things used to be with him and Pepper. Did he have no other choice but to give in? Before he even considered that, there was something he needed to know. He was a man of science.
(See the end of the chapter for
It felt like being shot multiple times. He heard a bark of harsh, humorless laughter then he realized the sound coming from him. He wiped at his tears, the horrible laugh still hadn’t stopped. It had never been the same again after that. He couldn’t forgive Howard anymore!
The sick fucker must love to have seen him bleeding and screaming! Howard must be imbecile for admiring this sadistic, brainless gorilla who couldn’t even see his flaw! Those two should have been soul-mate instead, a match made in HELL.
“The guy's all over the place,” Natasha Romanoff mumbled to herself as she watched Steve and Loki fight from her aircraft
Thor’s hammer soared into his grab. Loki watching them fought each other with a big grin on his face. Thor sensed his brother’s eyes on him and their eyes met. Impatient ran through the Thunderer, he was going to end this fight as soon as possible!
Is this guy for real? “You would bottom for an Omega.” He blurted out skeptically. “What about Alpha’s pride?”
But the fight was far from over. Loki tried to strangle Steve from the back before spinning him off again for another meeting with the concrete. He fell and his head hit the pavement hard, bringing stars to his eyes, and his teeth gritting in pain.
Pepper was quiet for a minute. Tony wanted to reach out to her, comfort her. But he was the one who had caused her to be in pain.
"Stabilizing material." Before Tony continued, he turned to Agent Coulson and whispered "Listen to me, pick a weekend, I'll fly you to Portland. Keep love alive."
Loki shoved him viciously, strode forward and looking at the dark sky. "I've seen worlds you've never known about, and I have grown, Odinson, in my exile. I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it…”
“But I suppose you don’t know that. You might have missed a couple of things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.” Tony spat acidly, ignoring the voice of reason in his head telling him to stop, just fucking stop!.
"Tony!" Steve surged forward as if to go after him.
"You know, the last time I was in Germany…” More people began to stand as Steve wandered forward. He smiled, their actions fuelled him on. "And saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing."
“That’s great.” an eyebrow raised from Anthony, his expression skeptical. “I mean I hate how everyone pretends that Omegas are something to be cherished when they just want to breed them and force them to dedicate their whole life to just being a housewife and househusband.” he said, with a fervor that surprised him.
“I can make you come again in 15 minutes.” Tony's voice was caramel in coffee. With his free hand, he took hold of her waist, pivoting her closer “So can I?”
Chapter by beizanten
Hands were greedily searching to give and to take pleasure. He arched against Steve, offering, challenging, crying out when the blond sought and found each secret until his breath was on fire in his lung and his body a mass of sensation.
They couldn’t stop thinking about each other.
Once outside, he ran along the street in bare feet, came to a screeching halt as he looked with horror, wondered at how much the world had changed. A sense of panic whirled inside of him, as he looked around in a circle at the sights of almost familiar buildings and street signs, yet cars like he had never seen before and light--moving images like movies, only in color. It was almost too much for his mind to comprehend, to keep up with what was going on around him.
A few moments later, Iron Man came across the nuke headed right for midtown and turned immediately to follow it.
His lips parted beneath his lover's and a moan escaped his throat. Steven’s warm hand on his back sent ripples of pleasure cascaded down his spine. That hand pulled him closer. So close, imprinted Anthony’s body to his —it was as if Steven intended they would never be separated again.
Millimeter by millimeter, Tony’s head emerged, little eyes and chubby cheeks and tiny ears and scrunched nose and pouty lips and as his chin passed. Maria stopped her herculean effort and heaved several breaths, eyes going wide, “Holy shit!” The pain flared up and she wanted to run away although she’s trapped in the moment.
“But you are a hero, a soldier; shouldn’t your purpose be to fight for the love of your country, for the world? Would you rather for the world to be inflamed and for billions of people to die?”
"Yeah, this was a team." Bruce snorted.
“I’m not leaving her for you, Rogers.” he said with an icy, knife-sharp calmness that made Steve swallowed. “I am not going to let a stupid bond dictate my life.”
There was also the problem with his nightmares. The slightest noise would rouse him from sleep. But Pepper being the amazing woman she was, never complained once about his nightmares waking her. She understood that Obie’s betrayal had wounded him deeply and ripped his fragile and wary trust to shreds. She calmly talked him through those first few disorienting moments until his breathing calmed. Then she pulled his arms around her as he drifted back to sleep.
Steve’s body was pulsing with an electric charge. He contained his enthusiasm it was enough that Tony was alive and safe. He needed to wait until Tony was ready or it would only backfire.
“Captain America was on threat watch?” Bruce said disbelieving, both arms crossed over his chest.
The bond was fucking with his brain as always. Tony had been inside that man’s head in all of his dreams with ‘Rogers’ ever since he first saw the Captain on Howard’s trading cards. He saw what that man saw, felt what he felt… and wasn’t it fuck-up because the guy didn’t even exist!
Tony’s words were like bullets embedded into Steve’s heart. The Alpha felt his ire ignited like canon fuse.
“I am sorry for what happen.” Steve's voice was both gentle and firm "But right now we gotta put what happened behind us and got this done. Now Loki needed a power source if we could put together a list..."
Those weren’t the actions of an asshole.
It wasn’t what Steve wanted to hear, but like an angel's breath sent through a parted cloud that apology.
“But….” I don’t want to make weapons, he swallowed the words. His wrists were broken the last time he said it. As if hearing his thought, Howard looked angrier if that was possible.
I think Tony seems to be the kind of socially awkward person who can talk to women but doesn't know how to do that around men.
Tony gazed blankly at the dried and brownish blood stain left by Phil's body for a long moment. He couldn’t help but think of Steve’s words.
Note:
They said some soulmates were connected to their other half even after their soulmate’s death. Since he woke up in the future, Steve had been having terrible nightmares of being frozen in time, trapped in ice while his home, the city he grew up in, and the world he wouldn't ever know again, moved on without him.
Pepper knew exactly how he wanted the company to run. He trusted her with his company and his heart. Not an easy feat for him.
Tony Stark said “Last night.” Hill raised her eyebrows.
“Shut up!” Tony was pushed hard and toppled to the floor. It hurts!
"You know, I should probably look into that." He said, moving over to one of the suspended computer screens and tapped on a few icons. "We'll know Fury's game plan once my decryption program finishes breaking into all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files." Tony said casually.
He downed all of it in one go before he pushed the empty glass away and opened the file with sweaty hands. Moment of truth!
For the first time since he woke up in this time, Steve slept soundly until the afternoon.
Nick Fury continued. “We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, the location of the Cube, Banner, Thor... I got nothing for you.”
The heat rose again, more potent, more powerful, a wave of burgeoning heat, it swamped them, swelled crashed and rolled through them. Tony kissed him as he wanted and intended to devour every sensual inch of Rogers and while Rogers' heart sang, his senses gloried.
Then he felt it, a presence. The pull stronger than it ever was before. T-tony… Tony was nearby. He could feel it in his soul. He glanced over to Loki and noted that he was just as confused and thankfully not sprinting over to Steve, so he allowed himself a moment to tilt his head back and looked up to where he felt the presence the strongest. The sky…
He had vowed to himself that his duty as Iron Man would always come first.
“What is Phase 2, Nick?” Tony questioned. Before anyone could answer, a loud thunk sounded and all eyes went to Steve who slammed an assault rifle he had found on the ship on the table in front of Fury.
(See the end of the chapter for
Loki appeared in front of them “Kneel before me.” When the crowd ignored his order, another LOKI appeared, blocking the crowd. Several blue lights flashed around them, all taking on the form of Loki. They all grinned as they raised their spears, encircled the crowd.
The nurse froze in fear, now she knew her game was over.
Tony held back a shudder and tore his eyes away from Rogers. Why did he let JARVIS persuaded him to give the tour in person again? He should have just order JARVIS to do it. ‘Because you really missed and cared about him’ his traitorous mind supplied. He wouldn’t let a stupid bond rule over his life… especially after it had cost him his best relationship. The Omega hated how easily Steve undid the control he had spent 13 years and more perfecting. He needed to corral Rogers’ siren-like allure.
“You dared thought you could just walk into my life and expected me to leave the only good relationship I had and the Alpha I loved for you!” There was something sharp to his tone, like the tip of a butcher knife. “Who the hell do you think you were?! You didn’t own me, Rogers, I could be with anyone I wanted, and I chose Pepper!”
The whole universe instantly compressed down to their kiss, to the way they shared breath. Something in Anthony sang with glee, his senses raced, razor-focus felt every blissful touch of skin and lips on his.
Tony Stark is the first Omega who not only becomes a CEO of a multi-billionaire company he is the one who advance the original millionaire company into a multi-billionaire.
Steve was sure his entire world was spinning wildly out of control. Pain seared along his skin. "Why are you doing this?" To his humiliation, tears welled in his eyes.
He came to stand beside Steve at the window, watching, accessing, a scowl on his face.
Of course, she would, Pepper was like the shadow that was too loyal to abandon anyone. Tony’s lips curled into a genuine smile. “I loved you. Pepper, you were one of the best things ever happened to me.’’ He stroked a thumb across her knuckles.
… His real soul-mate.
End flashback
Instantly a grin lighted up his face. He finally got to meet his soulmate. Tony definitely knew how to make a first impression.
Flesh met flesh drawing twin moans from each of them, mouth met mouth, and sending shock waves of pleasure through both, desire met desire, driving out of reason.
Tony sighed. “I had good memories of him too.” The only thing he missed about his father was when they worked on the Roadster together. That was the only time that Tony spent with Howard when Howard was almost nice and he knew his father’s attention wasn’t on what his son should be doing or could be doing, but solely and completely on Tony. Just Tony. For those small increments in time, Tony had the attention he so desperately needed from Howard.
Deep down she had suspected that Howard had an affair with he had lose all interest in sex with her lately, but she had glossed over that, she didn’t want to believe that Howard would do this to her. God knew his workaholic and the alcoholic tendency was bad enough! How could Howard did this to her?!
How Tony could ignore him when Steve was acutely aware of him? His expression, his shape, his scent. They were Twin-soul, Tony had to feel their bond so why only Steve seemed affected.
Later that day Clint buzzed his apartment and gave him his new uniform.
At first he was discreet about it, not wanting the media to catch a whiff of it. He had an affair with his hot secretary.
Tony looked defiant for a moment before he forced himself to calm down. This wasn’t the time to argue, he needed to appeal to Captain America. “We needed to stall him, Captain. I could buy us some time.” The one who said this wasn’t the sarcastic billionaire anymore but Iron Man. The Super-soldier gripped on him tightened. “Captain.” he pushed. “Think of the civilians at risk.”
"It's good to meet you, Doc. Banner.” Tony said, as seriously as he’s capable, "Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled." He grinned.
"That big; ugly..." Steve paused, noticing Tony's glare “…Building in New York?" Not quelled by Tony's persistent glare from across the desk, but Steve at least had the decency to look contrite.
Tony had to squash forlornly the impulse to touch Steve, to check on his injury. He blamed it on his Omega instinct. The Captain seemed fine.
But Tony being Tony only faltered for about a second before glared daggers and smiled challenging at him. “MAKE ME.”
The force of it transfixed Tony, caught and held his senses. It was some part of Steve and Tony that had been asleep for their whole life woke up with a jolt, like it had just been waiting for each other's touch to spring back to life. Both of them whimpered. It felt familiar and so deeply right like he had done this a million times. Fingers tangled in Tony's hair as Steve drank him in, absorbed his scent. A hand moved down his backside, sending electric currents up and down his spine, and pulled him closer. So close, imprinted Tony's body to his --it was as if Steve intended they would never be separated again.
Tony wasn’t a hero, but at least unlike Rogers who had been genetically modified and had been spoon-fed his fame; his armor was an extension of himself, the product of his raw talent, blood and sweat! He built the first miniaturized arc reactor –while carting around a car battery attached to the magnet filled a giant hole in his sternum -and his first suit with scrap and salvage in a fucking cave in just a week!
Trying to pacify the Super-Soldier, Fury holds out his hand and headed toward Steve, imitated a placating gesture. “Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're—.” Fury attempted to explain.
Steve couldn't help grinning back. "Did I ever!" before pushing past Tony through the elevator’s door.
Rogers wasn’t better than him. The man was an excellent fighter he would give him that much, but from where Ironman was standing, Captain America was very underwhelming. Why cared if Super soldiers were like a drop of water in the middle of the desert when his power-set had him totally outclassed by most super-heroes and super-villains? Captain America was an excellent fighter with a low level of superhuman strength, senses, healing ability, immunity to poison, stamina, speed, and an obsolete vibranium shield, but not much else.
More surprisingly, instead of walking on eggshells around Doctor Banner like the rest of them, Tony was smiling warmly at the other scientist, laughing, inviting him to his home. He never thought Tony could be so, nice, and friendly, and it pissed Steve to no end that he wasn't like that to Steve at all.
Fury, Phil and Happy: High level Beta.
“Tony...” When Tony’s side of the comm went dead, Steve screamed internally before shouting into the comm, as if being loud enough would get through to Tony. Still no response. Tears fell from his eyes, he felt like he was suffocating like something had a grip on his lungs and wasn't letting go. He struggled to bear the overwhelming pain and fear he might lose his Twinflame. This feeling of helplessness, it was far worse than when he lost Bucky.
Great hero, yeah right, maybe in 1940! Back then there weren't any other superheroes so of course, he was a legend. He was simply born at the right time and place!
The Helicarrier tilted dangerously to one side causing several agents to fall down the hole.
He could see dark, furious rage directed primarily at him, his dad’s face contorted to something ugly and frightening.
Before Thor could stand up properly, Tony launched himself toward him and punched his head. Thor stood, facing Iron Man. He snarled into Thor's face, raised his fists and getting in a hit as Thor raised his hammer.
Steven was half-breathless under the unmistakable lust in his eyes, his heart pounded… by the sudden turnabout and how bold and unrestraint Anthony was… not a typical Omega.
"We're not done yet." Thor interjected grimly, gaze turning back toward the half-destroyed top of the tower where Loki was. This was of grave importance, it wasn't time to rest yet.
Her breath quickened, fear palpable in her eyes “I already told you.”
“Oh, my God!” Bruce looked up, horrified.
There definitely a big misunderstanding between them. Now Steve thought back, it all started when he mentioned about the stupid footage. “Tony, I…”
Tony rubbed his forehead, for a moment, blinked rapidly as the buzzing in his head intensified. The genius began to realize that something was wrong.
Just a few more seconds before the bomb exploded…
But of course, Captain Bigot was too proud and arrogant to recognize that, which was such a 1940 century alpha thing to do that he shouldn’t have been surprised. After all, Rogers came from the same generation as his bastard of a father and Obie.
He had been unconsciously comparing Pepper with Steve even though he barely knew the guy. He had only interacted with the super-soldier for three weeks. In that time they were too busy stopping Loki, helped to save the victims and rebuilding the city. They didn’t even have time to get to know each other properly.
When he returned from Afghanistan Tony Stark could have just sat back and lived out his life quietly but no, he made the conscious decision to change his entire life, and sacrificed billions to stop making weapons and pursued what he knew was right… and he kept to it even after Obadiah Stane (one of his closest friends) tried to kill him for it.
It only made him loved her more every day.
“Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day.” Tony panted, voice croaky and body tired from all the exertion. “Have you guys ever tried shawarma? There’s shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is but I want to try it.” Tony babbled on with his all-too-famous lack of seriousness before looking to the Hulk. "You ever try shawarma?"
Hot anger dropped into Maria’s stomach like a bucket of coals. She grabbed his arm only to be slapped hard. Losing her balance, she fell on the floor.
For a second Steve looked hopeful and it hurt that Tony had to reject him again. The deep parts of Tony arched for him the most. Not just his body but his soul. Some parts spark. Others melt. It was a flux of chemistry and catastrophe. He needed to close his eyes to Steve’s beauty and his ears to his charm. But most of to turn himself into an impenetrable fortress to resist their pull of their bond
Steve quickly agreed to try shawarma. He didn’t care if he didn’t even know what shawarma was or that Fury would be angry that they didn’t report immediately. His relief was overpowering and almost too much to handle at the moment.
Through the bond, Anthony felt Steven tension towered like a flame, burned him. He leaned back, arched to him.
Took away his armor, sure, but unless his adversary planned to remove him from the game entirely, he would always be the most dangerous thing in the room. He would just build a bigger, better armor and defeat them.
Her verbal abuse grew more and more frequent as she fell into depression with the passing years. In her drunken ravings, she spewed whatever poison she managed to come up with at Tony from day to day.
There was still something amiss… The thing kept crawling in his brain and he tried to grasp it… If the palladium core in the arc reactor was poisoning Tony, shouldn’t overuse of the Iron Man armor only worsened his condition and quickened his impending painful death. Yet, Tony continued donning the armor to save people. That was amazing! But it still felt like something was amiss… He felt a dreadful feeling inside… he decided to let it lay.
Bruce looked over at him, swiping monitors on his screen. "Yeah, I'll read all about it." He said as he returned to his calculations.
Tony felt their bond pulsed between them, raw, real, and with roots deep enough to wrap around and penetrate his brain, heart, and some deeper part of him he couldn't name. The force of emotion flowing between them like an impossible two-way river. Warm fluttered and spark spread like wildfire through their body and set off fireworks in their curiously empty skull. Like Ambrosia, it addicted his mind, body, and senses completely.
Co-written by me and Kathryn
The brunet, although Steve couldn't see, made a withering look. "See that red lever?" Tony demanded.
Anthony gurgled what was supposed to be a growl, his eyes rolled into the back of his head as his back arched, the pleasure doubling.
"I remember a shadow…” his eyes pained. “Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!" Loki replied, raising his voice at the last words.
Steve should feel like the happiest man in the world with that news but he remembered how much Tony loved Pepper. He texted back “Was Tony okay?”
“Excuse me…” Nick Fury fixed Thor with his one-eyed steely gaze, his voice was sharp and angry. “Did we come to your planet and blows stuff up?!”
"Mr. Stark." He greeted, hoping he didn't sound off. 'Wonderful, now he will think I don't like him…'
Chapter 12: Tony meet Bruce
He was stunningly impressive. He was tall, well over 6 feet, with broad shoulders and a tapering waist. There was something elegant in his stance. Elegantly attired in a black evening coat, pristine white shirt and cravat, and black trousers. Everything about him from the breadth of his shoulders to the length of his long legs seemed to perfect proportion with his height. But it was neither his willowy figure nor his stunning face that left him breathless and stupid. It was his soulmate’s soul. It shone in his oceanic eyes like sunlight on diamonds, gleamed on the very glow of his butternut skin.
Loki raised his hand in a gesture to silence him, his voice was icy but there was sadness in his features “YOUR. FATHER.”
"I would pull it." Steve kept his voice calm despite the fast pounding of his heart. Anxious to keep his soul-mate safe from the rotors, Steve leaped like a cat across the gap, head to the lever and stand by it.
As a natural breeder, Omega had a stronger sense of smell than Beta and Alpha so they could sniff for any (sickness?) in a potential mate. As in genes, the more dissimilar the pheromone is the more genetic-suitable a pairing is according to science experiment using flies. Just like a woman in the human world, an Omega or other castes’ woman is 10 times better at reading people than male except Tony he is not that good at reading people. That is what he needs Rhodey for he is much better than a woman in reading people watch Teen Iron Man. Rhodey suspected something fishy with one of the main villains from the start. While Tony gets duped by another villain like the ice villain. It is funny that Rhodey is the one with the six-sense considering he is well male and Alpha.
Tony quickly enlightened him. “I’ve got a nuke coming in, it’s going to blow in less than a minute.” Tony said, tracked the missile’s trajectory. The nuke quickly approached oversea, towards the city. He glanced upwards towards the portal, a spark of an idea bloomed in his mind. Then he increased the power of his propellers, twisted in the air and brought himself upright, speeded upwards after the nuke.
Pepper looked so worried. Worried about him. She deserved so much better. “Pepper, we need to talk.’’ Tony managed through what felt like a mouthful of sawdust, of chalk, of razor blades. This would be easier if he had alcohol in him but he couldn’t drink in case he couldn't stop. Letting go of Pepper was one of the hardest things he had ever done in his life but he couldn’t postpone this anymore. Delightful creatures like Pepper are not meant to be trapped and that was all he had been doing especially since he couldn’t stop emotional cheating on her. Pepper was perfect, she was everything he ever needed in a lover but since the blasted soul-bond his mind couldn’t stop comparing everything that was Pepper to Steve… and that was inexcusable. Pepper deserved so much better… then the mess he had become.
Now that was the most thrilling thing he ever heard. His head felt light and his legs wobbly: who would have known a man could get drunk in a lady’s good opinion.
God, Bruce had tried to kill himself. Tony's heart ached for him. He knew how painful life must have been for someone to kill himself. He hadn’t actively been trying to commit suicide after Jarvis and his parent’s death and during the palladium poisoning, but he had gotten damn close.
He was 28 and finally ready to settle down. Being with Pepper was joy and comfort, intermingled in an electric tangle he had never felt before in his life. His only regret was that it had taken a few years to realize how strongly he felt for her.
Maria’s slumped back into her pillows, exhausted, tears running down her face. She felt emptiness, utter relief.
‘It was a nice smell but not nearly as nice as Steve’s pheromone.’ Tony unconsciously thought. He winced internally. This scent used to lull him to sleep, but now it a reminder of the hole in his life… the hole that shouldn’t be there. What had the soul-bond done to him? His life and relationship had been altered.
“How does Fury even see these?” he asked with a slight tone of incredulity.
The words cut him deeper than he had thought possible. Rage had ridged his face and neck crimson like his flesh was on fire. It was his turn to level Rogers with a disgusted; scornful glare. “Fuck you.” he grounded out, released lips that were pursed so tightly they were turning white, balled his fists together to avoid launching a punch. “Who the hell do you think you were?” Tony's eyes glittered in anger and he hissed angrily like a snake.
Tony’s body half covered by the sheets, hair over his face, eyes closed. Watched the Omega now, he couldn’t imagine being without his husband, he loved him too much.
He and Doctor Banner seemed in sync and it grated on Steve’s nerve.
Senses spun as Anthony focused entirely on their kiss. The pleasure built, whipped through Anthony, around him, spiraled through his senses as he melted into his lover.
She struggled at home with insomnia, pain, night sweats, bad reactions to her medicine, and extreme fatigue. Still, the sense of emptiness remained so visceral it was as if she could feel that part of her womanhood was missing, almost like she imagine an amputee felt phantom limb pain. She also wept without apparent cause on several occasions.
To Tony Bruce wasn't a monster just a man, a genius man with the unique ability to turn into something much stronger. He was testing his boundary to figure out how Bruce worked and how in touch he was with the Hulk side of himself. It felt teasing and childish but so utterly human and he couldn't remember ever got to enjoy this with anyone since the Other Guy showed.
As if being splashed by boiling water, Tony startled out of his reverie and jerked away from him. Their perfect moment melted away in the face of Tony’s rejection and Steve’s heart ached for it.
Hill looked at him sceptically. “When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?”
He could give them all different floors and provide each floor with enough necessities there won’t be any reason for him and Steve to interact beyond the call of duty.
The reaction was immediate, Steve turned to face him… the confusion was written all over his face
This was his father’s greatest creation, the perfect soldier his father praised to heaven and back? To think Howard abandoned his own soul-mate; treated his family worse than dirt for this!
They reached a trashed hallway, debris, and metal scattered everywhere.
The bigoted alphas in his board of directors would use it to question Tony’s ability to make all the important decisions for Stark Industry so they could sell weapons again. The media would have a field day about Tony being a loose Cannon, ranting how an Omega especially one with PSTD was uncut to ever be a superhero. The public would question if he was mentally stable enough to don Iron Man. The military would use it as an excuse to take his armors from him. And it would risk Rhodey’s job seeing as he had vouched for Tony. He couldn’t, he wouldn’t make more trouble for Rhodey, not after the palladium poisoning debacle!
Such mighty punch for a slender man but Steve quickly got back up. He hurled his shield at Loki who simply bated the shield aside before dodged Steve's first punch then countering with his staff as it cut across the air.
Note: Tony distrust Alpha especially male Alpha in general because of his bad experience. And he is not exactly fan of Omega either since during school and university rivalry for hierarchy among an Omega is common to get a better mate. And they resent Tony for being popular despite skipping many year because he is rich and a very high level Omega Causing him to be an outcast among fellow Omega while growing up.
Many great leaders/heroes are Alphas but many great villains are also Alpha
‘Except for Obie.’ His mind supplied bitterly. ‘Who would have thought a beetle that could tear hardwood was trapped in flower petals that were so soft.’ A voice echoed in his mind. ‘Who was that?’ He shook his head to snap himself out of it.
Howard set up a birthing area in the master bedroom and got them nurses.
Steve desperately tried to catch on with Tony’s science talk, wanted to help and showed Tony that he wasn't useless. It was like the Omega was talking in a different language and half what Tony said went over his head. He felt like an idiot and even more 'out of time.' He registered that Loki needed a power source.
"And you're doing a marvelous job with that?! The humans slaughter each other in droves while you idly fret. I mean to rule them, and why should I not?" Loki asked, looking at his former companion.
He had fought tooth and nail for his country, fully willing to die to protect everything he loves. But it wasn’t he who dies, it was everything else!
A small part of Loki felt relief because he thought Thor would despise him when he found out his true heritage. He should have known that his single-minded, witless oaf of a brother would surprise him. A bigger part of him, however…
