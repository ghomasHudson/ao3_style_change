“Don't strain yourself Stark, the beast's spell will rid itself of you soon.” He held the hammer up threateningly at the centipede, and it wriggled away back into the containment cube it had escaped from. Steve nuzzled against Tony affectionately while he wrapped an arm around him to keep him close by. He couldn't quite piece together why Thor had barged inside in such a way thanks to his still sex frazzled brain. Steve did know that he felt tired...so tired...he could sleep for days sort of tired.
“I don't really want to talk about it Nat.” Steve replied as he wiped his face with a towel. Natasha stood on the mat waiting for him.
“I don't know yet, but I'll make one up, and another and another if I have to.” Tony took a few steps backwards towards the door, abandoning his original plan of going for a run on the treadmill. “Until we find the solution to this problem of yours.”
“Don't...Tony please don't. You don't have to say anything I know what I did and I can't tell you how-how sorry I am for what I let happen to us.” He couldn't bring himself to look at Tony he couldn't fathom the expression of broken trust in his team-mate, his friend, someone that had put faith in him as the leader of the Avengers. Steve had failed him and he knew it.
Only it didn't go away, if anything it only intensified. The avengers had been called in for a mission. A bomb threat in Chicago with several hostages. The Avengers went in and managed to subdue the criminals and rescue the civilians but Iron Man had gone in to attempt to diffuse the bomb before any went off. Steve felt the ground shaking around him as he looked up and watched in horror as the building before him collapsed...the building Tony had just flown into. Steve rallied Tony on the comms, but all he got was static.
Steve turned his head and just gazed at Tony in the dark, how tired he looked how utterly defeated he appeared in that moment. Steve felt it too. Perhaps they could find some solace together despite the tremendous loss that weighed heavily upon them. He reached over wrapping an arm around Tony and held him close. They had survived, they were here together and somehow they would find a way to continue forward.
“Yes I do...” Steve replied with a smile and trailed his fingers down past Tony's waiting cock, skimmed lightly over his sack and further to his tight hole. Steve pressed the pads of his fingers against the puckered skin and gently rubbed, coating the flesh in slick lube. Steve pressed several kisses to Tony's neck as he teased and prepped him. He gently probed with a slick finger and eased the digit past the ring of muscle to ease Tony's channel open. Tony exhaled slowly at the slight burn of penetration. It had been some years since he had taken a man to his bed. Tony's body was hot and tight around Steve's finger, he pumped it in and out a few times before pulling out to add more lube and then pressed in two.
“Fuck.” Tony cursed as his body tensed and he came messily onto his hand and stomach. He fell back against his bed and felt the creeping shame as soon as the glow of orgasm rapidly faded. It had been years since he had felt turned on by another man, and at this level of intensity as well. Tony wondered if he was experiencing some sort of mid-life crisis that for some reason resulted in himself lusting after a young and viable man. Tony got out of his bed and walked to his bathroom to clean himself up. He wet a towel, wiped away the evidence, and returned to his bed for some much needed sleep. Tony put the incident behind him and believed now that it was out of his system he could move on from it.
“Tony-Tony I'm gonna come, fuck- fuck I'm coming!” Steve gripped Tony's hair harder, and forced his cock into the man's mouth as he came, hot streams of his come poured down Tony's throat. He let Tony pull off to catch his breath, and before Steve had even recovered he hauled Tony onto the bed.He pushed Tony down onto his back to kiss him roughly. He could taste the bitterness of himself on Tony's tongue, and it only turned Steve on further. He kissed Tony for several minutes, and ran his hand over Tony's chest and palmed him through his pants, rubbing Tony's cock. He was hard, almost painfully so from being confined in his pants.
“Yes.” Steve admitted, his voice muffled against Tony's heated skin. “Another time. I promise I will tell you anything you want, but right now I-I need.” Steve ran his hand down Tony's chest and he nodded in understanding.
“Never asked for details I'm just saying to fix it so you stop moping.” She readied herself and slowly began to prowl around Steve once he had joined her again on the mats.
“Why don't we let life decide for itself?” Tony's block slipped as the nanobots failed around his arms and melted away. Thanos got a grip on Tony's left arm and held him in place.
“I've missed you so much...” Steve whispered and nuzzled him. “I didn't realize until it was too late what I felt. Walking away from you was the hardest decision I have ever made.”
It was good, it felt so good. “Ah yeah right there, don't stop please, please!” Steve begged as the centipede continued its assault on his body. Steve writhed beneath the creature, holding his own legs open, his fingers digging into his flesh. He felt the tension building, the increasing pressure in his balls as they grew tighter against his body. Close he was so close, winding up tighter and tighter teetering right on the edge of bliss. The release was nearly explosive, Steve threw his head back practically wailing in his pleasure as his cock pulsed with fresh streams of come. It spattered up across his chest, and abs, but the centipede didn't relent on its stroking, gentle fucking, its legs only tightened the pressure around Steve's oversensitive cock and milked him of every drop.
When Peggy came home later that day, she could smell the glorious scent of the co-mingled perfume, though didn't realise what the smell was at first. She eventually lifted Steve and Tony together and figured out that the smell was both her favourite perfumes combined.  She started blending her scents more and more after that.
Once she stopped travelling on so many missions, and started staying at home more, Steve and Bucky got to come out of the travel case and hang out on the shelf. But Steve was lonely. Bucky had started a relationship with Nat, Peggy's Red Star rouge, so he wasn't around much, as he often rolled himself off to spend time with her. Steve's sturdy triangular base and thick glass, which had been so good for travelling, meant he couldn't explore the shelf as much by himself.
“Well” Tony leaned back on his bar stool, with a thoughtful expression on his face. “If that was your first time, I'm looking forward to seeing how good it can get as you learn more. Want to go back to mine for some one-on-one tuition?” The eyebrow waggle was back.
Once they had finished, and it was safely attached, the first thing he did was hug everyone, so happy he could pick Morgan up again, and wrap Peter and Harley in his arms once more.
"Today, when Peggy picked me up, I tried to throw my perfume weight to this side of my bottle, so that she would lean this way with her hand, and it worked! I'm finally over here.”
F.R.I.D.A.Y managed to make the windows opaque without being reflective. No-one could look in, and he couldn’t see himself. He could hear muffled voices talking outside, but didn’t pay them any attention. Curled up in a ball on his couch, his focus was turned inwards.
Steve put his head in his hands while Tony was talking. Now that he mentioned it, Steve had the faintest stirrings of recollection of showing off his paintings when they had got back to his place last night. The memory had be pushed out by the double whammy of the sheer sensation of having sex for the first time and the potent alcohol in his blood stream.
He wasn’t sure how he felt about this. On one hand, he was glad the new bottle (Tony — he had learned his name through the vitamins’ gossip) was settling in, and being used. But on the other hand, he felt more lonely than ever, and now slightly useless. The new bottle would never like him now, even if they ever got a chance to meet. What could he offer, now that he wasn’t fulfilling his function?
He also spoke to Bucky, learning from him about how to deal with the loss of an arm, how to cope with a mechanical arm, what feedback from the arm he had, and how it could be improved.
This bottle was on the other side of the gulf of the sink, and was facing away from him. Steve feasted his eyes on the sumptuous round shape of his bottle and bulb, the flirty flick of his tassel. Then he realised he was being rude, staring. He flushed, turning a dark purple colour, and shuffled his bottle around so he wasn't staring quite so directly
“It was April,” said Peter Parker. When everyone looked at him, he flushed red. “What? She just couldn’t get a handle on her fear during the snake challenge.”
Tony looked. The attendant was bringing out his tire replacement tools: wheel chalks, jack, tire iron, stuffed unicorn. The first three items he quickly placed in the appropriate spots. Then he lovingly set the stuffed unicorn down to watch the proceedings, giving it a gentle pat on the head.
“It’s okay if it does,” Steve said, and something in Tony’s chest loosened, not a heart thing exactly, but heart-adjacent. “Come here and lie down next to me. We don’t have to do anything.”
“Our play is—ouch! Leave it alone! Our play is to say fuck it, get back in the van, and wait till morning,” said Tony. “At least in the morning, we can see what the hell is tripping us—” (here, Sam and Scott both nodded), “Biting us—” (Peter winced), “Standing right in our path invisibly—” (Clint lifted his wadded and bloody t-shirt briefly from his nose), “or
“You know, sometimes, getting laid out flat by someone you don’t see coming isn’t such a bad thing,” Sam said gently.
are,” Sitwell informed him, then returned his sharp gaze to Tony’s grin. “What’s gonna happen is you’re gonna die and my Domo ass is gonna go to jail for fuckin’ failure to keep you from doing it.”
Steve looked at the group, at the expressions of horror and worry and concern. Most of the group were subtly shifting so their backs were arrayed around Tony, a phalanx of protection; Thor’s expression was darkening rapidly; even Clint was crossing his arms at Steve. Natasha was unreadable as always; only Sam was looking at Steve with something approaching compassion. Steve made a flash decision, the kind he was starting to suspect would be his life’s specialty. “Can you stand?” he asked Buck, whose right eye was swelling shut.
“Ugh, that was Marie Crats, a daughter of one of my mother’s high society friends. I hated when she would come over because all she would do was torment me. I’m pretty sure before we sat down she tugged me by the ear until I toppled over and then when I tried getting up she shoved me back down.”
“Oh, Doll” purred Bucky lowering his head so his nose brushed against the back of Tony’s neck and bringing his arms around to grab Steve’s hips. Trapping the genius between them. “The feelin is mutual.”
“What Bucky is saying, is that we have feelings for you Tony. We’ve had feelings for you for a long time, but we were too scared of what you’d say.”
A hush came over the group as the anticipation of what adorable thing they were going to see their genius do. If this movie was really around the age when Tony was two it was going to be priceless. It took a few seconds but then a picture blinked onto the screen and a woman’s voice, definitely Maria’s, was heard as she seemed to be walking down the hall.
Tony blushed sinking down until just his nose was peaking out of the water. Many people had this idea about him that he was this crazy rich playboy that had slept with anyone he ever looked at. The real fact was that he, Tony Stark, was a virgin. Steve, Bucky and Tony had been dating for the last five months and they hadn’t gone beyond kisses and light touches. The soldiers could sense his unease and were being absolutely sweet and going Tony’s pace.
“Don’t worry Tones, we can help. Come here baby,” cooed Steve, not waiting for Tony to move and simply held him under the arms and lifted him onto his lap, exposing his cock to the air. He shuddered and blushed.
“Antonio! Marie! My darlings what fun. You are both growing as artists everyday. Felicity, come, I’ll walk you to the door.” said Maria, taking her friend by the hand and began leading her to the study door.
The soldiers, watching Tony’s every move, smirked at their adorable lover. Tony had been so shy. When they had first tried to move things up a step, Tony spluttered and uttered an obvious excuse. They chucked it up to new relationship nerves and didn’t push the topic. Their boy would let them know when he was ready. But oh- oh, seeing him laying there vulnerable, naked and wet. They couldn’t help themselves. They needed to touch.
“Nuh uh baby,” scolded Steve lightly, as he grabbed onto both of his hands. “What did we say last night? You’re beautiful, don’t hide yourself from us.”
“Oh no, big guy, we weren’t friends. Nor were we ever friends. She tormented me for years and I’m pretty sure our mothers were crossing their fingers we’d fall madly in love and get married.” Tony visibly shuddered at the idea
“Oh my god. Ooooh my god!” shrieked Clint. On screen was a very little Tony. The boy was standing on a stool that had a small rail around the back. Keeping the small child from falling onto the floor. Baby Tony was grinning from ear to ear, wearing only what seemed to be a childs sized apron that looked even a little too big on him. This Tony was definitely younger than the Tony they saw on the ‘Tony Twos’ video. He looked to have a very fine layer of hair on top of his head and his cheeks were definitely chubbier.
“And that the sexual tension and pinning looks can finally end.” replied an amused Bruce. The supersoldiers chuckled while Tony blushed furiously.
“Yeah baby doll, you looked so sweet, seeking pleasure in your sleep, using Stevie to get you there.” murmured Bucky against Tony’s ear, making Tony squirm.
“It’s a little too late for ‘should have’ Cap.” Natasha replied. Even for her, a woman who was trained to not show emotion, especially in high stress situations, looked deeply distressed by the events that just transpired. She would never had wanted to hurt her friend so badly.
“A nice cool bath will be useful right about now. It’ll cool his body down.” Bucky reached up to hold Steve’s face with his hand, knocking their foreheads together gently. Bucky smiled, “Don’t worry Stevie, I’ve had a lot of practice looking after sick people.”
Tony was completely overwhelmed. He never thought he could have this, that his boyfriends would be, not only ok with his inexperience but by the looks of it, severely turned on by it made Tony feel a little more sure footed. His pace, they said. He didn’t even know where to start!
“No more buts!” yelled Tony making Steve snort. Tony rolled his eyes at his immature lover. “Go brush your teeth and then we can try again.”
“Y-yeah?” Tony stammered and whimpered still slightly distracted by Steve’s hot mouth leaving a trail of marks along his shoulders.
“I’m ready mistro,” drawled Marie. Little Tony glanced over and smirked as he quickly slid his hands down the keys.
“Steve, if we let him sit down there for God knows how long who knows what’s going to go through that head. We need to make this right and we need to do it now. Not later.”
“Ditto,” replied Bucky just as wrecked and awed at what they were witnessing on the big screen. In glorious HD was baby Tony, laying down in what looked to be a swinging basket of some sort. His big, expressive eyes were staring right into the screen, or more likely the person filming behind the camera. Steve was pretty sure the woman’s voice that he heard belonged to the one and only Maria Stark, but he wasn’t sure, and Steve swore he could just about count the his bottom eyelashes. They were so long and if Steve wasn’t enamored before he was completely lost to the cuteness. A quick look over at Bucky and the rest of the group confirmed that Steve wasn’t the only one who had fallen under the spell of baby Tony.
Steve kissed Bucky again. “Yes Bucky, yes. I’m ready I want the same thing as you do. Let’s make him ours.” Bucky leaned in the last couple of inches that separated them and placed a sweet kiss on Steve’s lips.
“Are you shittin me!” Bucky’s voice was almost an octave higher than his usual gruff baritone and he had both hands in his hair, gripping tightly.
“Oh my god!” screamed Tony in mortification. “Bucky! I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to shove you off the bed! I just, we were just...and you’re mouth was just on my-I can’t kiss you with that kind of mouth!”
Steve was the first to speak up, “This was wrong. We all knew it was wrong but we didn’t think about how Tony would feel. We should have asked.”
“What the FUCK is going on here?” yelled a sudden voice. The Avengers all winced as they knew all too well who the voice belonged to. Tony Stark, genius, friend, and extremely pissed off Iron Man stood next to the elevator his face twisted into something awful, his posture radiating fury.
Tony sat back up and leaned his head back, closing his eyes and just luxuriating in the warmth of the water and air of the room. Steve and Bucky had left for a mission four days ago and he missed them terribly. Since they were gone, Tony had the whole penthouse to himself.
“Was? Stevie he still is adorab-” Bucky choked off the last word realizing what he was about give away.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony squeaked, not expecting the sudden touch, or how good it felt. His hips seeming to move of their own accord. Tony moaned.
Steve pulled off just enough to whisper, “Go ahead baby, let go, I can take it.” The cool air of Steve’s breathe against his cock made him shiver hard. Steve renewed his ministrations, this time paying extra attention to the head of his cock. With Steve’s words of encouragement, Bucky plunged deeply into Tony, licking and tasting, making Tony scream. Steve hummed around the length in his mouth and tongued at the slit. That was it. Tony was done.
“That is a wonderful idea! We absolutely must show Jarvis.” declared Peggy. Leaning down she took Tony’s small hand and began leading him out of his parent’s bedroom to go look for the family butler.
Just then a small brunette boy came stumbling into the scene. The small boy was glaring at the little girl, who continued to smirk. The boy reached the piano and turned, showing his face to the camera.
“Once? Thor, you may be a God, but do you need your eyes checked? He’s still adorable.” argued Steve
Tony whimpered into Bucky’s mouth as he plundered and took. His tongue mapping out the spaces of his mouth, making Tony weak. Tony reached his hand up to grab onto Steve’s neck when he felt the larger man begin to suck a mark where neck meets shoulder. Nibbling and sucking the soft skin.
“Tony, man, it was my fault. If you have to be mad at anyone here be mad at me.” Clint apologized. Seeing how much this was affecting his friend, guilt had quickly taken hold of him. He had not expected for this to go sour and had only expected some light teasing but not this. Never this.
Tony cut himself off as Marie stopped singing and on screen the camera zoomed in on little Tony as he began to sing
“Looks like you like it sweetheart, that’s beautiful Tones. Keep at it Buck, his cock is twitchin like crazy in my hand, he’s so close.”
Feeling that warmth bloom once again in his chest for these men, Tony leaned up leaving a quick peck on Steve’s lips followed by Bucky. Tony was about to voice his appreciation for his super soldiers when he was interrupted by a loud excited voice.
“Cheese pease!” Another bowl was placed in front of little Tony. This one clearly filled with cheese. Baby Tony took small fistfuls and dumped them onto his creation, getting sauce all over his hands. Again, not doing a super great job at spreading the ingredients.
“Ugh, if he keeps getting more adorable with age I’m not sure I can keep going without some sort of medical assistance. Bruce quick! Check my vitals, I feel faint. The cold grip of death is upon me and it’s all Tony’s fault.” Clint groaned from the sprawl he made on the floor. At some point he had melted onto the floor from the couch due to the cuteness Tony presented.
“Oh…” Bucky turned to his partners sitting on the couch cheeks pink and a sheepish smile on his face.
The father and son disappeared around the corner when the first wails assaulted their ears all of the avengers growing tense.
During Tony’s rant he failed to notice the giant grins adorning Steve and Bucky’s faces. Or how they quickly turned to smirks as the small genius was quickly working himself up into and embarrassed panic. Nor did Tony notice the men walking closer until they were almost chest to chest and chest to back. Effectively making a Tony sandwich.
Tony mewled loudly when Steve’s large warm hand almost engulfed his entire cock, giving long slow strokes. His lips taking their place back on Tony’s neck.
Tony whined again when he heard the sound of splashing water and feeling two large bodies mold up against his. Tony was too scared to open his eyes, even though keeping them closed wasn’t helping him pretend to be brave.
Howard didn’t stop in his stride towards the boy and the boy began to shrink further and further into the ground.
“Steve!” Bucky and Clint both shouted. Steve paused, chin over the bar, “Yes?” Steve responded drawing out the end in wary confusion. The two of them together looking so frazzled and with shit eating grins on their faces spelled trouble. No one had expected the explosive bromance that resulted during Bucky’s recovery. It had been six months since Bucky had returned to Steve and had come to live with all of the Avengers at the tower. Steve had been worried for Bucky and for the safety of a few certain people such as the archer and their local super genius that they might do something to accidentally provoke Bucky which would then result in a fatal stab wound. Luckily for the residents of the tower Bucky recovered almost ridiculously fast, perhaps thanks to the serum. In fact Bucky took to all the avengers in equal comradery. Steve was happy for Bucky. Steve was absolutely ecstatic that Bucky and him had fallen back into their old relationship. He loved seeing the man he loved interacting with the members of his new family. Bucky fitting in almost seamlessly.
, Mister Ross, I will use one of Tony Stark’s many confiscated tasers on you until you are drooling onto the linoleum, and then I will teach a class
“Aren’t you supposed to be the genius?” griped Barton, but unfolded the map across his lap and held up his iPhone with the flashlight app on. “So, apparently, New Haven is in Connecticut.”
“Look at that muscle tone,” said Clint. “He has some, still. None of these other people do. He must have started out with a lot of it.”
Steve’s vision went black, his stomach plunging as he pictured Bucky—those eyes—turning to grin at him in the empty classroom—those five minutes in the laundromat—their second kiss just five hours after the first because they couldn’t wait again—those eyes. Bucky, turning to him in the empty English classroom, that Thanksgiving with the windows open and the scent of the fir trees and the knowledge that everyone else had already cleared off campus and it was just them, they’d done it, they’d found a way to be alone together.
“Nietzschean! I like it!” said Scott, panting right behind Clint. “Hey guys, what are the odds there’s gonna be like a big drinks machine on the top of this building?
“Sounds big,” muttered Steve distractedly, reading the same explanation of molar weight for the third time with no appreciable meaning seeping into his brain. Giving up, he tossed the textbook aside. “How’s the projector going?”
“This water’s green,” Steve said before he could stop himself from sounding like a hopelessly finicky invalid. He hasn’t been finicky—or an invalid—for a long time, but, somehow, being around Tony Stark makes him feel that way all over again.
echoed some voice from deep inside Steve, in a calm clear tone like a great iron bell. It was a deep, placid, resonant certainty—a truth, impossible to ignore. And yet Steve wasn’t afraid—because underneath that thought, there was another note, ringing, chiming out, creating harmony with the first thought:
“Thabz hard attacks,” said Clint thickly, around a swelling nose. “Seriuzzly, Dony, what’s our blay?”
Steve carefully pincered the iron and set it back in its holder, but not before it had seared an inch-long divot into the cheap synthetic carpet. The plasticy fibers, melted into a black, gluey mass, emitted a noxious stench—Tony and Steve looked at each other in dismay for one moment, and then the fire alarms went off.
Tony looked around at the circle of blank faces. “See, the looks you’re looking at me with tell me that I’m right. You all need a vacation. Everyone, in this room, needs to get away for a while. Ideally, to a private island. Luckily,” he said, uncorking a bottle with his teeth and talking around the cork, “I have one of those. Actually, I have two or three of those—Friday, how many private islands do I have?”
“In Norway,” Thor said thoughtfully, “Many people change their nature at a point in life. My brother was briefly my sister once, and my father was very displeased.”
“Can we all agree that at the very least, there has to be one fresh fruit or vegetable in order to constitute a salad?” Scott was saying. “Come on, guys, I feel like I’m losing my mind here.”
“Yeah, well, as it turns out, he couldn’t,” Tony griped, following Sam through the door of the convenience store.
Natasha stepped up to Thor’s broad shoulders and drew a line with her fingers to the crest of each shoulder. Then, quick as a flash, she was standing and balancing on his back, graceful as a circus dancer; she reached up, found purchase on the rusty ladder rails, and pulled the entire clattering apparatus down to the level of the loading dock, stepping lightly from Thor’s shoulders to the ladder at the moment it landed. She wiped her hands with an expectant look at Tony. “Are we climbing or talking?” she said innocently.
“Twenty percent of the fuel costs, was that not common knowledge?” Tony asked, and when Scott turned pale, added, “Kidding, kidding. Jesus. It’s on me. Thanks for coming. Didn’t bring the squirt with you?”
“I’m pretty the god of sex doesn’t dress like that,” said Steve, gesturing at Clint’s ensemble, which today included a purple t-shirt, three sizes too tight, that had ridden up and exposed a fair swath of Clint’s belly.
“...Since I woke up...at first it was a lingering feeling, but as time went on it got worse. After I got out of quarantine I tried to...” Steve couldn't say it, he dropped his gaze from Tony's as the shame enveloped him. “I thought maybe if I got it out of my system it would go away. Then I found out I couldn't get off. I rubbed it raw trying, I used other methods and nothing ever got me there. It's been weeks and...I can't...” He trailed off.
“Don't apologize, that gives us something.” Steve reassured her. He looked over the grief stricken faces of his comrades they all were still looking to him for guidance. Only Steve had no idea what to do, he was at a loss. Nothing could have prepared him for a war like this. They had given it their all, every one of them he knew had fought with everything they had and they lost. “We need to reconnect with anyone that could be left, that includes Clint, Scott, anyone we knew from our days in Shield.” Steve stated. They needed something to go on, a little bit of hope that he had a plan. “Rocket you think you and Thor can contact your team?”
Steve groaned against Tony's lips letting the man claim him, craving more, whatever Tony wanted to give him. It had been so long since Steve had been kissed, especially like this he couldn't think if he had ever been kissed quite like this, charged with such fiery passion he couldn't get enough of. Tony pulled back letting Steve catch his breath, but he only leaned in to trail his lips over Tony's neck, leaving soft kisses down over every bit of skin he could reach. Breathy sighs escaped Tony's throat as he let himself fall into the moment, the touches, the sensations of Steve's soft caressing lips over his skin. He tilted his head giving Steve a better angle and more access to him.
“Come on Soldier...don't keep me waiting.” Tony said with a low growl. Steve captured Tony's lips in a heated kiss while he flicked open the bottle and poured a generous amount onto his fingers. “You know what you're doing?” Steve adjusted his weight so he wouldn't crush Tony and settled between the man's legs.
“What the fuck is wrong with me?” He asked aloud in the dark not actually looking for an answer. After a few more minutes of wallowing in self pity Tony forced himself up and entered the bathroom to clean himself up. He wiped away the come from his abdomen and cock with a wet towel, tossed it into the dirty laundry and returned to his bed. Sleep didn't come easy as his guilt weight heavy.
Steve slowly lifted his gaze to Tony who was staring at him with a serious expression. Tony Stark wasn't typically a man that had these emotional talks, and he rarely spoke so highly of Steve without adding some clever joke at Steve's expense. Yet here he was taking the blame on himself, taking responsibility and actually apologizing for what had happened. Steve had been so wrapped up in his own guilt he never thought that instead of Tony feeling victimized that he would feel like he had been the sexual predator. “But...I let it happen to you. I didn't even try to stop it I encouraged it. I wanted...I-I wanted...”
“Gah-! That's the worst part!” With a sigh Tony relaxed back onto the reclining chair with Steve still nearby. “Okay...you were a good assistant.” Tony admitted with his eyes closed. Letting his body finally return to a state of normal.
Tony chuckled lightly, this was fun Steve playing along like this if only they had been this civil before "Initially I wasn't planning on it, but I usually keep an open mind should any prospects come up." Tony gave Steve a bit of an extended look, taking him in, his eyes trailing down then back up. "So you play hard to get I like that." Tony ran his finger along the rim of his glass. Any minute now he suspected Steve was bound to get flustered and call this off. Tony would keep pushing he wasn't about to be the first to break the charade.
It gave Steve a sort of pride to know that this could be the comparison that Tony used for all his future encounters. Steve was striving to be that unobtainable first experience. To be the one that Tony would forever remember, and always look back on fondly. Steve thrust his cock harder into Tony's tight channel, a moan escaped him from the pleasure of it. “Tony...you're so tight God! You feel so good, so good!” Steve chanted as he continued his steady rhythm and there was the quiet sound of skin slapping skin as Steve's thighs, and hips continually bumped against Tony's rear and back of his thighs. Tony tried to ignore the wet sound of Steve's cock sliding in and out of his ass, but in the quiet of the room and between his and Steve's moans it was difficult to try and ignore.
“Fuck, Cap, you can just manhandle me anyway you want?” Tony breathed as he positioned his hands and knees beneath himself and raised his body up. Steve's breath was coming out labored and rapid, he didn't reply he just needed to bury his cock into Tony's perfect supple ass.“Steve?” Tony looked over his shoulder when he hadn't gotten a reply. He saw as Steve reached down and wrapped a hand around the base of his own cock to help guide himself, he shifted his hips so the head pressed right up against Tony's hole. Tony hung his head and squeezed his eyes shut as he prepared for the inevitable discomfort of initial penetration.
Holy cow! I can't believe this got so much positive response?? No seriously....I can't believe it. Everyone who left a comment asked me to continue so I'm going to do my best! And I was also convinced to add some angst. There is some off screen abuse around the end of the chapter FYI. This chapter and parts of the next one, yes I said next, will be a little angsty but I'm (pretty) sure it will be tooth rotting cuteness from there. I also got some suggestions for this chapter and I kind of mixed a few? Just a little bit. Well...hope you guys like it!
“Ditto” Steve and Bucky said together. Tony grinned shyly up at Steve and then over to Bucky, blushing sweetly. It was still crazy to think that the soldiers thought Tony was adorable and had the same feelings as he did.
Before Tony could finish his command the door to his workshop opened and in walked two very large, very buff, very hot, and very worried looking supersoldiers.
Tony looked at every Avenger, making sure to make eye contact with each one, seeing the regret clearly shown on their faces. “Well” said Tony, “I suppose I can’t stay mad forever, and everyone was having a good time. Just promise me you’ll never do this kind of thing to me again. I was really hurt.”
Clint slid the video into the player and scurried back to sit next to Natasha. Everyone got comfortable as the screen went from black to show what appeared to be a study or music room. Two women, one obviously being Maria were sitting next to a piano sipping tea idly chatting to one another in hushed tones. A muffled argument was heard off camera, the sound of children’s voices getting louder and louder.
“F’ast! We! Need! Dough!” screamed the boy. Jarvis placed a pre baked pizza crust in front of the boy, making him bounce in excitement.”
Soooo?? Have I lost my touch? ( I hope not) The song Tony sings if you didn't know is called Scaled and Arpeggios from the Aristocats. Look it up. It's cute as hell.
God, did he miss them. The stress was getting to him and the best way to relieve it was snuggling up to his giant beefy boyfriends. Their hugs were like magic and made everything bad go away. They’d kiss him sweetly, drag their fingers through his hair making him mewl. He loved when they did that. It always turned him into jelly. Bucky would hold him and Steve would slowly move in to ki-
“It’s-it’s not little! It’s aver-aaaggeeee!” squealed Tony as he felt the hot press of Steve’s cock against the swell of his ass. Oh god, that felt-too big, it was too big how was he supposed to take tha-
Steve headed to the bathroom as soon as he had grabbed the bottle of ibuprofen hearing the tub turn on. Steve walked right through the bedroom and into the bathroom stopping and anxiously waiting for orders from Bucky. Steve wasn’t as used to caring for sick people as Bucky was. Steve was more used to being the one being cared for. Bucky always seemed to know what to do. Always staying calm. It was mostly thanks to him that after his mother died that he stayed alive at all. Speaking of Bucky, Steve shook his head to rid him of the memory. Bucky currently was sitting on the ground his legs crossed, tub running and Tony firmly sat in his lap. Hearing Steve come through Bucky looked up from checking the temperature of the bath.
“You dressed like the Captain and looked for your Bucky Bear, you were young Sir, merely two years it seems. Perfectly acceptable behavior.”
Bucky sighed thumb stroking Steve’s hip, “I do too, but what we’re doing is what’s goin to get him better. Just be here for him Steve and you’ll help him more than you think.”
“Alright young sir, it is time for your morning nap, let us take Bucky Bear and your shield and go lay down. Adventuring is a tiring job.” The camera turned off and the screen went black.
“Yeah, but, it’s-it’s embarrassing!” squeaked Tony, refusing to move his hands away from his face. As if hiding would make this all go away.
Steve and Bucky. Bucky and Steve. There was a thought. A very distracting thought. Life starting out at the tower had started off rocky for everyone. There was a lot of healing to do all around. Given time, things healed and a tentative friendship began between the original Avengers. Steve and Tony began getting along like a house on fire. After getting past their old hang ups about the other they realized they had a very similar sense of humor and liked hanging out with each other. Tony could have sworn there had been even some budding feelings between them. Until Bucky came back that is. But even with the introduction to the unstable ex-assassin and learning what happened to his parents, Tony couldn’t even be mad. It wasn’t surprising when the two soldiers got together. Tony had heard rumors growing up about them. He was happy for them. It was just hard seeing them together for not only did Tony still have feelings for Steve, but he had quickly developed feelings for Bucky as well, what with his rugged good looks and sharp wit that could match his own. He knew though, that the feelings he had towards them were not reciprocated. Plus they were in a relationship with each other. There never was nor will there ever be room for Tony.
The avengers mouths dropped. One minute Marie was trying her best to sing when little Tony began playing all out like a true master. Way beyond the skills of a normal four year old. Clearly their genius was multi-talented. Maria smiled adoringly at her son. Clearly she loved hearing him play so beautifully as well.
“Can we take a vote and unanimously agree that this is by far the cutest shit any of us have ever seen?” asked Clint
“What?” asked Tony. The pure innocence of the question broke Bucky, laughing loudly at his lovers expense.
Steve and Bucky settled down soon after, closing their eyes both of them almost asleep knowing their loved ones were safe and in bed.
“Damn straight we did dollface. You gave us a damn fright,” Tony looked chagrined, “But damn, am I glad to see those beautiful brown eyes staring back at me.” Bucky reached up to rub his thumb underneath Tony’s eye smiling fondly at him. Tony smiled shyly back.
“We love you too baby,” Steve and Bucky both said. Both of them leaning down to kiss Tony sweetly, Tony having fallen asleep, safe and protected against his supersoldiers.
Steve was silent, his mouth gaping open. Did that just happen? Did he just watch his long time crush rescue his Bucky Bear and pretend to be him? Tony had mentioned that he had been a slight Captain America fanboy when he was younger but he hadn’t realized it has started so early. Bucky wasn’t lacking in affections either it seemed. The boy on screen looked absolutely horrified when he was informed his Bucky Bear was maybe trapped in the blankets. Speaking of Bucky he stole a glance over to his boyfriend turning quickly turned to face him for the sight Bucky presented was a little concerning.
“Nuh uh sugar.” Bucky tucked his face close to Tony’s. “You gave us permission an we just callin it like we see it.”
“Adorable” Bucky finished, “I was saying you’re adorable and you’ve always been adorable and you always will be Tony.”
The supersoldiers continued to sit and watch their debatably awful action movie, laughing when one of the main characters had gotten themselves trapped in a choke hold, while Bucky ranting about how there were at least thirty different ways he could break out of that, Steve a giggling mess next to him, when the elevator pinged to alert the arrival of someone to the penthouse.
“Come on baby doll” Bucky cooed “We’ll make you feel better.” Bucky scooped Tony out of Steve’s lap, placing a kiss on his sweaty forehead when he whimpered and headed in the direction of their shared bedroom and ensuite bathroom.
After a few more minutes the men pulled back, just enough for them to breathe, but not far enough to let go of each other. All three were breathless, not sure who would speak first.
Tony kept touching himself though, getting bolder, acting as if he were teasing Steve now. Tony was running his fingers over his skin, along his chest, over his thighs, grazing his balls and cock. He bit his lip and whimpered ever so quietly as he toyed and played with himself. “Is this too much Steve? My lord? I can stop if you want me to...if this makes you uncomfortable.” Tony said in a strained voice.
Tony gave a brief chuckle of amusement. "That's fair enough, I suppose an introduction is in order." He held his hand out to Steve's "Tony." Steve eyed Tony warily for a moment and then took his hand.
“Avenger...” Thanos' voice boomed above him. “this is the fight you cannot win, not against me.” With that Thanos threw a punch with his other fist straight into Tony's chest plate and sent him reeling back once more. The HUD within the suit flickered before his vision, and the intricate knitting of the armor began to dissipated from around Tony's hands. It moved up towards his forearms, revealing the fabric of his shirt underneath.
As the pleasure waves receded Tony pulled out, and stripped the condom off himself. Tony didn't look at her, he couldn't bring himself to look at her as he stood up from the bed, still panting slightly to catch his breath Tony walked out on her and shut himself in the bathroom. Tony normally wasn't so callous, and he rarely left a bed partner unsatisfied, but he couldn't pretend that everything was okay. He couldn't even come until he thought about having sex with Steve and that was an alarming realization. Tony turned the shower on and tried to scrub away the dirty feeling.
“Steve.” Tony groaned and angled his own hips, drawing his legs up around Steve's waist to draw the head of his cock against his waiting hole. “Fuck me...please...” Tony begged. Steve felt almost dizzy with want and hearing Tony begging for him in such a way. Steve had to comply.
“Captain America? You let Captain America help you through the heat? Oh Tony back in his day a heat was reserved for bonded mates!”
“It's a weakness and a reminder of all the shit I've done.” Tony replied almost aggressively and jerked himself back and away from Steve's hands. Steve stared blankly at Tony for some time his brows knitting together in disapproval.
It had become a near nightly ritual now he would masturbate and think of Steve Rogers, and since then other things had been making Tony feel hot under the collar besides the stealth suit. He could now add dress uniform to the growing list of material he used in his private inappropriate fantasies. Tony, in retaliation to his traitorous body returned to the event, had himself a hard drink and found his conquest for the night.
“I-I'm sorry please come in.” Steve finally found his voice again and he stepped aside to let his guest enter. The concubine didn't say a word, but walked gracefully into the room. “You-You can go ahead and sit there. Just make yourself c-comfortable.” Steve felt himself stammer slightly. He hadn't known what to expect from a male concubine and so far he felt thrown off kilter. This individual was gorgeous in ways that Steve had never known to be possible for a man.
“Fuck!” Steve cursed alone in his room while shutting his sketchbook in irritation. This was wrong...it was so wrong, but Steve couldn't ignore the heat of arousal growing inside. This was becoming a problem and he knew it. Steve wasn't new to the concept of homosexuality. He had grown to accept it many years ago when he had been a teen and cuddling up to his best friend during cold winter nights. They had never talked about it, but Steve had spent more than a few shameful nights stroking himself to the thought of Bucky doing things to him that men only discussed as appropriate for dames.
It became a near nightly ritual as Tony jerked himself off to thoughts of Steve Rogers he wore the gloves of the uniform to better enhance the fantasy. Tony kept the gloves and fashioned a new set for Steve as there was no way he could allow himself to hand them back knowing what he had used them for. Tony contemplated on what he should do about his problem, his obsession, he could quit the Avengers and move far-far away and possibly his infatuation would fade. Only he had too many responsibilities as Iron Man for that to be a viable option.
Here there was no deadlines, no bosses, no directors of organizations, or board members to impress. It was Steve and Tony and they could make the rules. After dinner that night they managed to get up the stairs while pulling off shirts, kissing, hands exploring each other as if it were their first time. Sex with Steve was always like a new experience for Tony, the way the man made him crave his touch, his lips, hands, cock. Tony had never yearned for anyone as he did every time they fell into bed together. Steve was always efficient in opening him up, knowing all the right spots to kiss and nip as his fingers slipped into Tony's body to distract from the burning stretch.
Steve didn't hesitate, his cock was hard again already he was hungry for more and eager to come again with Tony buried deep inside of him. Steve picked up the lube from the side table and poured out a generous amount onto his fingers, he was already wet and lose from Tony's fingering so he used the lube to coat Tony's length. He slathered Tony's erection in slick from base to tip, and was careful not to grip too tightly. He didn't want Tony coming just yet.
Tony shook his head, this wasn't a place he wanted to go, it was still too raw too fresh of a wound to prod just now. “It wouldn't have mattered what we did, Strange saw the outcomes and all but one...but ONE we lost!”
Steve had drawn himself back up to full height and turned, his hands resting on the front of the belt. “Stark, can you give me a hand with this?” Tony had snapped his jaw closed and gave Steve his a-typical disinterested expression, but approached the computer console anyways to assist the Captain. He pushed the inappropriate thoughts to the back of his mind and believed that would be the end of it.
Steve took each step carefully, listening and scanning the lab space. His eyes caught the broken glass of the containment cube that Tony had constructed to hold the centipede. Great. Steve tightened his grip on the shield in preparation to either throw it, or use its edge to cut the creature in half. There was the soft noise of skittering across the hard floor right behind him, taking a breath Steve prepared himself for battle, and spun around ready to throw when- a cloud of something erupted into his face.
Tony lifted his head up and looked into Steve's eyes. “I meant about...you saying next time? That you want there to be a next time?” Steve blinked. It had all just come out in the heat of the moment, but now that he thought about it. Yes. He wanted a next time. After watching Tony experience such an intense orgasm Steve wanted to give him that again.
Steve closed his lips over the taught, peak of dusky skin and sucked gently. It was immensely gratifying to get his mouth on that delectable skin. He flicked his tongue over Tony's nipple, blew his hot breath over it and nipped and tugged the golden hoop with his teeth.
“God Tony...” Steve groaned as he pressed more small kisses to the man's shoulder. He gave Tony's nipple one last small tug before he ventured back down to play with and tease Tony's ass. Steve plunged two fingers in with little resistance at all and worked a slow steady rhythm of pushing and pulling out. Tony's breath was coming out harsher, more strained as Steve worked him open. Tony tried to keep himself quiet, but the methodical slide of Steve's fingers in him grazed along his prostate, and Tony couldn't suppress the soft grunts and hums of pleasure. “That's right Tony, just enjoy it. Look at how beautiful you are.”
Steve didn't care where it had just been, he opened his mouth for the centipede's appendage, licked up and down the length of it, the texture smooth and slick over his tongue. There was the fullness of Tony's cock sheathed in his ass stretching him, the head a constant pressure on his sweet spot. Steve's own erection was hanging heavy between his legs, throbbing with need. The centipede clicked its pincers in excitement while Steve continued to suck on the protruding phallic length, enjoying the feeling of being filled and having something in his mouth. He rocked his hips feeling Tony drive deeper into him, but he wanted to rut and rub his own cock against something. Maybe the centipede would wrap its legs around him again and let him just rut into its soft underbelly.
“Close, so close Tony!” Steve was shifting his own hips, rocking back against Tony's own dick as if he couldn't get enough. Tony watched as the Captain's ass enveloped his own cock, the slick wet slide and slapping skin, the perfect globes of Steve's ass cheeks ramming against the top of Tony's thighs. It was pornographic. Tony had never imagined that Steve was capable of acting like this. He flexed his arms and tugged on the bindings of the centipede's webbing. Tony wanted to reach down and spread those cheeks so he could watch his cock sliding in and out of that stretch dripping hole. Tony's hands itched to slap Steve's rear and make him gasp, to make it hurt in that dirty oh-so-good way.
Steve worked Tony's belt off and unzipped Tony's pants and pulled his cock out to give him a few firm strokes. Tony gasped and arched his back, groaning as Steve touched him he hadn't expected this, Steve willingly touching him, wanting to pleasure him.
“Why not? Hasn't Pierce suggested that they are available to you? You won't have to pay for a model, and they will be just as attractive if not more so. Also they won't care if they have to disrobe and sit for awhile.” Sam suggested with a nudge.
“Hey respect your elders young man.” Steve teased. “We wizened old men have lots of factual real world knowledge.”
“Please-please, alpha I need you.” Tony practically whimpered. He felt the waves of intense need burning within him. His cock was throbbing he needed to come so badly. His balls felt tight and ached with tension. Steve reached down and rubbed the tips of his fingers over Tony's wet hole. He was already open and ready for him....he didn't even need any prep. He was loose and waiting.
"A good time” Steve replied his voice dropping low as he shifted his leg for Tony in invitation. "Play your cards right, I could make your night." Steve's eyes flared with challenge he wasn't about to back down and give Tony the win. Two could play this game, and Steve was determine not to give Tony the satisfaction.
At first Jarvis refused him entry. “Apologies Captain.” Jarvis informed him politely. “But sir does not wish to be disturbed at this time.” Steve nodded.
"Oh...I promise Steve I'll make it good. So good." Tony resisted the urge to nip Steve's neck, he leaned back pulling his hand away. They were in public, and this was just a game, certainly they would part ways once they left the bar. Maybe have a laugh at the entire thing and go their separate ways once more. Tony stood up, pulling out his wallet and paid their tabs. Steve stood up with Tony left the bartender a tip and they walked out together.
“I prefer alone Cap.” Tony declared and spun back around in his chair, and hunched over his work bench. “I work best that way.” he added and returned his focus to his project. After several minutes Tony sensed Steve was still there and glanced back at him. “...seriously? something you need? You are weirding me out right now.”
It was a relief when Jarvis notified him to meet Tony upstairs in the penthouse. Steve entered the elevator feeling apprehensive of what was about to occur. Part of him was still suspecting a permanent removal from the Avengers. The talk Tony had with him early that morning had only been to temporarily placate him, only Steve couldn't picture Tony to be the sort of individual to pull something such as that. As the elevator rose up Steve inhaled deeply and breathed out nice and slow to calm his fraying nerves. There was also the chance Tony had discovered a solution, and all of this would seen be behind him.
“Always a kid to me.” Steve had that typical lopsided smile of his as he leaned back on the bed looking at Tony. His gaze flicked over to the bottle on Tony's desk and he cleared his throat. “Speaking of age I am certainly aware that drinking laws have changed in the past 50 years...what's with the sauce?”
“Oh? Oh baby...” Tony pulled him into a sloppy kiss. “You thought about this? Having me? Fucking me? Please Tell me Steve, tell me how much you wanted me.” Steve buried his face against Tony's shoulder...as if he wasn't wound up enough as it was now Tony was starting up on dirty talk? Steve didn't know how much he could take of that. He needed to come and soon.
Steve took a step closer to close the distance between them and reached out towards Tony. The engineer flinched back slightly but Steve didn't move away. He touched the metal of the arc reactor and traced the triangular line of the design. “...I said it's beautiful Tony...” Steve's eyes didn't stray from it as he closed his palm over the arc reactor. “I thought I lost you...like in New York. When I saw the light was dim I-I was afraid...but when it's lit up like this, when I see that blue I know you-you are okay.” Tony didn't know what to make of this situation as it felt too intimate for simple team mates. It felt too personal and Tony didn't like moments like these when there are feelings and emotions. He didn't do that stuff as it only led to more disaster, but Steve's palm was warm and comforting and he hadn't let anyone touch the arc reactor since Obadiah had nearly killed him for it.
“Are you in heat?” Tony just bit his lip seductively as he reached his hand down and gripped his own cock. He gave it a firm stroke up, precome dribbled from the tip and down the length. Steve inhaled sharply and he felt a throbbing so intense in his cock he though he might come in his pants.
Tony shuddered from the sight. Captain America, sucking on Tony's metallic hand. This was a piece of his tech something he had created, and Steve was loving on the thing as if it were just as good as any real flesh and blood piece of him. A part of him wondered if Steve possibly had a bit of a fetish for his armor. Steve bit at the digit playfully then lifted himself onto his arms, he loomed over Tony for a moment then leaned in planting a light kiss on Tony's lips. He then kissed his way down over Tony's jaw, and neck and down over Tony's scarred chest.
Steve drew what he though or at least what he could see of the arc reactor. He didn't quite understand his fascination with he device just that he wished he could get a better view of it. He kept his drawings classy and tame when in Tony's workshop, but when Steve was alone in his room he found himself fantasizing about more than just the blue light in his teammate's chest. Steve would focus on Tony's chest...what he imagined it looked like. The black tank tops Tony wore provided a good view for Steve to draw his shoulders and arms which were well defined in shape and muscle as it had to be hard work piloting the Iron Man suit, but Steve found himself wondering further. How defined were Tony's abs? He had a slender waist and a shapely behind (not that Steve had noticed...nope.) Steve imagined Tony's hip bones and that V shape that angled and drew the eyes right down towards a man's groin.
As they had continued their conversation Tony had abandoned the bottle and was laying across the bed with his head in Steve's lap. Steve was upright with his back against the wall and was idly stroking his fingers through Tony's hair. They had done this many times before when Tony had been younger and having nightmares Steve would sit with him and stroke his hair to soothe him to sleep. It simply grew into a regular occurrence for them.
Tony shook his head and instead plunged his fingers in again, working them in and out with vigor. “Not yet baby, unlike you I can only go once. I'd hate to leave you all needy and unsatisfied. Trust me okay?” He took extra care to hit that spot that made Steve wail and writhe beneath him.
“So I take that and go on my way?” Steve asked with diminishing hope. “and then what? Report to you if it worked or not?”
“Yes-yes anything you want.” Tony panted and with a hard thrust he drove his long thick cock into Steve's slick, and tight channel. “Ohh-Ohh Steve, fuck you feel so good.” Tony groaned.
“Of course Steve! Do you have any idea what this actually does?” Steve had opened his mouth to reply but thought better of it and sighed. All he knew was that it kept Tony alive, but he had no idea how. “When I was captured in Afghanistan one of my own missiles exploded nearby and pelted my chest with shrapnel. This stops it from reaching my heart.” He tapped it. “...then my business partner wanted me to build more and I refused so he took mine and left me here to die. Fortunately I had the spare I had built in the caves and I managed to get it implanted in time. This isn't some technological marvel that everyone makes it out to be, it isn't pretty, it isn't a blessing, it is a fucking curse that almost got me killed on more than one occasion.” Tony exhaled sharply and ran a hand through his hair. He kept going, kept talking because it was like the floodgates had been opened and he was letting loose all the insecurities he had so carefully hidden away.
“You used to say you kept a bottle on you in case you found something that could use greasing I developed the habit in case you ever needed it. Of course that was before but I just never took it out. I...never intended it for this purpose exactly but I figure we might as well just use it.” Steve said with a shrug.
“You... You... You…” The words seem to be lodged in Steve’s throat, and he swallowed roughly. “I thought we had a connection. I gave you my virginity last night and you just left money on my dresser like I was some kind of floozy and disappeared into the night!” As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he blanched. He hadn’t told Tony last night he was still a virgin, and hadn’t intended to tell him how. He had wanted to seem more sophisticated and experienced than he actually was.
Tony had been a force of nature when they finally got back to Steve's place, his hands and mouth running all over Steve's body, and encouraging the same from Steve, though he did listen when Steve had requested slow and gentle (at least for the first time) even though Steve hadn’t told him the reason. Steve had fallen asleep sore in places that he hadn’t been sore before, a smile on his face and wrapped in Tony’s arms.
Tony’s tassel reached out, but then stopped before he touched Steve, almost like he didn't have complete control over his appendage.
Steve stewed on all of this during his morning, and every movement that jolted those sore spots, which had seemed like such a benediction last night, now just made him see red.
Tony blinked down at the bills, now strewn on the bar, then up at Steve in confusion, then his eyes widened in recognition. “What did I do?” The slightly startled response seems to provoke Steve's rage to apocalyptic levels.
Steve snorted out a small laugh, then looked at Tony who had been watching him with a small grin on his lips. “Tony, I can’t begin to apologise for what I accused you of,” Steve started.
Steve flushed indigo again, and dipped his depressor slightly in greeting, as the other bottle’s tassel waved slightly in return
When Tony had asked Steve to leave with him, Steve had agreed, and had made the decision for them to go back to his place, though he had never done anything like this before. He had felt such a strong connection with Tony, such an intense feeling of rightness being around him that he decided to roll with it. And after all, at this point in his life he also didn’t want to wait any longer to finally make love with somebody.
Suddenly, Steve felt the waves of his perfume crest inside him and came crashing down. His depressor pressed down deeply and a mist of perfume shot out, covering Tony, who shuddered violently; and his bulb compressed, covering Steve in a fine mist of his own.
When Tony woke up, warm and snug and comfortable with Steve, he reveled in it. He forgot for a brief moment, why he hadn’t been able to have this for so long, until he tried to reach up to brush Steve’s hair out of his face, and it all came flooding back. He could practically feel what his arm was meant to do, could feel the texture of Steve’s skin, and the comparative roughness of the beard he was re-growing. Except he
It took Steve several days to realise — he had been too caught up in being enamoured — that Peggy hadn't used him once since the shiny new bottle arrived.
Steve started to put a plan together … well a plan might be wording it a little strongly. He was going to go to that bar every night until he found Tony and he was going to give him What For!
Rhodey encouraged him (or threatened to kick his arse with his leg braces) to talk to a therapist, to see if Sam had a recommendation from his VA days, talk to Bruce about about how he coped with his changes, but to talk to someone so that they could try and help him cope with his new issues, providing some of the same support that Tony provided to him when he lost the use of his legs.
They clinked together in a kiss, which soon got more and more heated. Their bottles rubbed against each other while Tony's bulb ran all over Steve, especially the dip in his bottle above his base.  The friction was delicious. They were both getting worked up, their perfume sloshing and sliding inside them.
He had thought that the evening before had been wonderful. He had met a handsome stranger at a bar and they had hit it off. After several hours of drinking & flirting, the subtle touches and innuendos had started to become more blatant on both their parts.
Tony was holed up in the workshop again, but this time he wasn’t alone. Rhodey, Peter and a visiting Harley were all inside with him, with a video link to Shuri. They were poring over the schematics for Bucky’s arm, and how it was connected to his neural system.
“Papa Steve,” a plaintive little voice drifted up to him, “When is Daddy going to come out of his workshop?”
Steve froze. What should he do? Should he introduce himself? Should he ignore the other bottle, since he had taken his job (not that that option was ever seriously on the cards)? He rocked minutely from side to side as he tried to figure out what he was going to do, so absorbed in himself that he did not even realise he was drawing steadily closer to Tony every second with a gentle shuffling-clinking noise.
Tony interrupted his spiralling thoughts with a brush of his tassel against the glass of Steve's bottle. "Likewise. I've been wanting to meet you since I got here. Seeing you stand sentinel across such a large chasm, so close but so unreachable; hearing the good things the others said about you, about how you tried to protect them in the travel case; how pleasing your scent was... well it's been tortuous, to put it mildly.
The painting of the bridge with Stark Tower in the background that had sort of kick-started this whole this, hung in Pride of Place in Tony’s workshop, where he could see it all the time. Next to it, was a slightly newer piece of art in a shadow box. It looked like money flying through the air, coming down like it was a snow globe, frozen in time. If viewed closely, it could be seen that this was actual currency. There was a handwritten note peeking out between the bills. Steve and Tony thought that it was fitting that the painting, note, and money that had caused such confusion, but had played such a vital role in bringing them together, be kept together as well.
Tony had said that he was often at that bar and had seemed familiar enough with the staff members that that at least seemed true.
And then… one magical day, it happened. Peggy was in a rush to get out of the door, and after spritzing herself with the perfume from Tony’s bottle, she put him down on the same side of the sink as Steve.
“I thought you might not still be interested, and I didn’t want to seem like an inexperienced, unsophisticated hick. I loved everything that we did last night, and I’m glad it was you.” Steve had been absent-mindedly fiddling and stacking the bills on the bar while he was talking to help negate the embarrassment, and he put them in his pocket, now that he knew it was all for one of his paintings.
Steve rested his forehead against the blacked-out windows of the lab, trying to get through to his husband again. He filled Tony in on how Morgan and Pepper were (Pepper said co-parenting without the co-parent was stressful, even if Steve’s step-daughter was the sweetest little girl around), how the recovery efforts were going (slowly), how the world was starting to adjust after everything that had happened (“not great” might have been the correct words to sum that up).
Steve had been Peggy's main perfume forever. His robust glass design meant he was able to travel with her, always adding a certain
One day, Steve woke up to the sound of a slight moan, a puff of air... and then a clink of glass on ceramic. He opened his eyes, and saw a gorgeous red and gold bottle, with a black tail, tube and tassel.
Tony’s face ran through a gamut of emotions, racing through confusion, incredulity, smugness, reminiscence, before settling back on confusion. “For starters, who says floozy anymore? Actually no, for starters, what do you mean you were still a virgin? How on earth did that happen? Or not happen as the case may be? Secondly, I didn’t disappear into the night as you say. I had appointments and meetings today that I couldn’t get out of, and I told you that in the note I left you and also left you my number. I was commiserating that I hadn’t heard from you today, as I didn’t have your number and didn’t want to wake you. And let me tell you me, having actually to use a pen and paper... You should be honoured instead of standing there all insulted. And thirdly I didn’t leave the money for the sex. I’m not that sort of man. If I am having that sort of sex its all very upfront. I don’t just assume anyone I pick up in a bar is a sex worker, and leave them money. What sort of man do you think I am?”
Before Steve could look at the note, Tony went on. “The money was for the painting I bought off you last night. Do you not remember that? The one with the bridge with my tower in the background.”
Lifting him gently, he carried him to their room and laid him on the bed. He stripped Tony efficiently, ducked into the bathroom to wet a washcloth, and wiped Tony down where he could to help him freshen up a bit, and then dried him off and slipped him between the blankets.
“Shh, baby doll I know,” he cooed, “God, if I could make this less shitty I would, but this is for your own good.”
Bucky groaned, “Oh please sugar, honey, my mouth, say yes. Lemme use my mouth on ya. I’ll make you feel so good.”
“What Clint means is that we are happy to see that you three finally talked things out.” replied Natasha
