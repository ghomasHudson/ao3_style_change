Let’s get something else straight- me and Captain America are not and will never be friends, mostly because the man is an insufferable, self-righteous pain in the ass with a serious hero complex. He’s a good leader and exactly the kind of person we need to lead the Avengers, but that doesn’t mean I have to like it.
Steve xxx
Atleast let me come pick you up before the police do!
Tony,
Dear Penny,
You can't leave the clone in the hands of Shield. 'There if you need it'? What happened to 'It will never see the light of day'? Shield will use it at the first opportunity, and besides dancing on the grave of our friend that thing is massively overpowered and not afraid to kill. You can't leave it with them.
Penny
Honestly, me giving Pepper the company wasn’t really part of the break up. I was pretty sick at the time, kind of in a bad place, and I felt terrible about what I’d done to her. It seemed like a good way to thank her. A multi-billion dollar company is a good gift, right? She’s a better CEO then I ever was, anyway. Much more business-like. And I just can’t pull off high heels.
I know, Sue spoke to me. How is Johnny doing anyway? I guess I don't really understand... if you think something is right, you don't stop believing that just because it gets tricky or dangerous to defend it. Then again, I guess she basically raised him. Maybe I'd feel differently if I had kids. Anyway, no-one is going to have a big angry mob. This is a democracy and they're going to get the chance to vote on it, what is there to even riot over? We're just keeping them informed about the choices, even the wrong one. :P
Sue is a hero, and if you haven't noticed heroes have a tendency to not stay out of a fight even when it might compromise their personal safety. Plus her son is the same age as a lot of the kids who died, I imagine she can't help but worry about if he had been at that school...
Have fun (or as much as you can) and I'll see you in a few days.
Why did you tell Jarvis to wait 24 hours before alerting me that James was missing? Have I lost your trust so completely you don't even trust me with him?
Dear Tony,
I can't believe you dyed your hair. How long is that going to last? I quite enjoyed the whole secret hook-up thing. We should do it again sometime.
Steve Rogers, on the other hand, is growing on me. This is something I only recently realised so I’m trusting you to keep it on the down low, but Captain America is very much a character for that guy. He only wanted to help his country, he never wanted to be a symbol. I think he takes it way too seriously, honestly. He’s the kind of guy that likes to take everything on his shoulders and then angsts like a teenager about it, but in the ‘I’m trying so hard to hide my pain’ way that makes you just want to punch him in the face. That said, he is also a sarcastic
You probably shouldn't have done that to the police. You know I need to hand myself back in sooner rather than later, and that won't help my case.
You can't blame Steve for being a little cautious about mechanical help after what happened. Maybe he is worried about you trying to force peace and causing another Ultron.... Or maybe he doesn't want Robots to help, maybe he wants to worry.
I've only held him once. The kidnapper has probably held him more than I have. Help me find him, Jarvis. You think more like Natasha than I ever could, you basically are her thought process. She must have some way to track him, something we can use. We just need to find it.
Penelope Parker.
Do I need to put a five-foot rule between you and Steve? He’s so sweet and innocent I’ll have to protect him from your wily advances. I will bite you.
Natalia is on my side (though she is claiming I stole her hair style. Please my hair is like 3 shades lighter than hers!) and so are the Fantastic Four since Johnny was attacked.
Penny,
It'll all be okay Steve, they are just coming down hard for now to show they aren't playing around.
Steve xxxx
Well I am throwing up a lot, but that is normal at this stage. Apparently the soup is good for me and the baby, helps it grow up strong or something. Personally I'm not sold on the science, but it tastes good so I'll eat it.
As for the suite, it’s yours as long as you want it. Steve didn’t stay there long; he went off to Washington for a while and I converted them to guest rooms then. I didn’t want to change it back when he came back to New York, so he’s staying on one of the upper floors now.
Tony,
Miss you,
I'm sorry I ran away from you, when we ran into each other the other day...it is gonna sounds stupid...but I don't really want the first time we meet in person to be when I'm dressed up like Spiderman...
I know you'll sort it out. I know you'll do the right thing. I trust you.
Yeah, well, tell him if your ‘birthday present’ is his dick it’s coming off.
Here, My number is ##########
How does it feel, Captain, to be the one defeated? To have let your family down so dramatically? To have your nation despise you? I wonder, what will you do when you're desperate? What will you become?
Steve....would you feel the same if our child had been at that school?
That said, I think we have a few things we need to talk about before we get back to normal. A lot has happened the past few months, and I don't think we can just sweep it all under the carpet. We'll both need a bit of time.
Penny,
Penny.

Natasha,
Third, your house is safe now if you want to go back. Besides, superhero or not, you’re still technically a minor. Your aunt can’t just go off for a fortnight in Florida and leave you on your own.
Any ideas where I can find this Atkins? There has to be something better than just blindly running around town, trying to find her and avoid the law...
[beat]
He is already in. You showed him how to bypass my systems.
See? That was gossip. I can gossip. Who says I don’t understand teenage girls?
I feel like you are trying to imply I'm missing something....are you seeing someone else or something?
Bruce is Bruce Banner right? I've read his research, it is amazing! It was a shame what happened to him. Do you know if he is going to start doing research again? I think he had some really great insight before the...incident.
Dear Penny,
The shutters are totally necessary, that’s what lockdown means. And do you really think I’d use something as flimsy as plain old steel? :P Give me some credit. You’re staying there and you’re staying safe until we get back. I’ve sent half the Iron Legion back your way just in case Loki and/or Osbourne tries anything.
P.S I didn't say anything weird while I was out did I?
P.S Aunt May thinks any boy I talk to is a potential boyfriend. She's been trying to set me up with Harry since I was 8.
Well after the first teacher quit, I told Aunt May I didn't want to do any more. I think she wanted me to try again, but Uncle Ben told her they shouldn't force me. He started showing me how to fix things after that, which was useful, since our appliances broke a lot and we couldn't always afford to replace them.
Love you,
Look, I have to ask something and I'm sorry I have to, but try not to get mad. I know you're working for the government now to bring down 'rogue' superhumans. I know I'm probably top of your list. So I have to ask, have you told them we're in contact? Are you going to use these e-mails to try and find me? Sam said you can get my location from them. I'm hoping you won't. I miss you too much already, I don't want to hide away from you completely. Not when you're having my baby.
P.S If you are getting annoyed now, I don't know how you'll cope when you get to Frozen.
Penny,
Tony,
My Mom was called Mary Parker, I put a picture in the envelope to help you remember. I guess I can understand why you might not..it was a long time ago after all.
I'm glad Johnny's okay. Really though, Sue would be better off just remaining neutral if she's that worried about staying safe. Still, just so you know, anyone who wants to come on my team has to swear off violence related to the debate. We can't do much about that 'mob mentality' you think exists, but we can at least stop supers fighting amongst themselves. This needs to be a proper discussion done in a mature way, otherwise what's the point of me being here and you being there, probably not eating or sleeping nearly enough? :P
Steve,
I appreciate that you were trying to look out for me, I really do. But I'm not helpless! I have some experience dealing with bad guys and even more dealing with teenagers. You need to trust I can handle things sometimes okay?
When asked whether she thought Rogers was treating his wife in the same way, Atkins admitted she was unsure. 'It's likely he's tried during the struggle for dominance,' she said, 'But he may have been afraid of being discovered, with his wife being so in the limelight'. However, she refused to rule out the possibility that physical or emotional abuse had taken place in the relationship, stating that 'it may explain Stark's 'sudden change in attitude' as she went from swinging party girl to wedded wife.
Well Spiderman hasn't been around long, I'm sure he'd have helped stop the attack in New York if he had had his powers back then.
You are in a big trouble when I get home Mister.
Loki is my friend, and yeah he has done some stupid and creepy things but those were mainly down to him either having to hide from you, or not being able to trust you to help. Except the spiking the Punch thing, but I hit him pretty hard for that!
Dear Hubby,
Well, now I feel like I’m just trashing Cap’s image. But whatever, I’ll carry on. Maybe shy isn’t quite the right word? He gets stage fright and he’s pretty introverted, he’s nowhere near as friendly as he pretends he is in public. The truth is he’s a total dork who snorts when he laughs too hard. And I’m like 99% sure he snores.
I'll ask her to talk to Captain America, maybe she can convince him she is alright on her own, or atleast get him to take a break and catch up on Disney films. It is sweet that he is worried about her, but he doesn't have to be. She has everything under control.
And can't you see it's starting already? I told you, registration would mean the government deciding who the enemy is. How many actual threats have you dealt with lately? Or are you too busy rounding up your old friends and throwing away the key to have bothered? Something is messed up, Nat, when you're being told priority one is to chase after the people trying to help.
I didn't tell her, she just wanted to thank you and since Steve lives here too, she thought it would be rude not to invite him. She might have worked it out honestly, but if she has she hasn't said anything.
Penny,
With all my love,
Tony,
With that in mind, I really do think you should take Steve. Especially with King of the Dicks being so creepy right now. I’d feel better if someone was with you, honestly. Besides, he told me he didn’t dance with anyone at his own prom and that’s just tragic. Also, I find he’s a pretty handy media shield when I want to do something under the radar. They love him. So if ever the paparazzi gets too much, you can just go ‘Look! It’s Captain America!’ and flee. Think about it.
I know you are mad, but what were we supposed to do?! You can't pick and choose which laws you follow Cap, that is why we don't kill villains even when they deserve it! If we let un registered heroes just run around doing what they want, then what would have been the point in setting up the act in the first place?!
Penny
Penny,
Third, I am very good at lying. You don’t need to worry about being found out.
Mrs Stark has asked me to inform you if James is out of her care without explanation for more than 24 hours.
Steve xxx
Problem is, it’s a two way street. If you don’t want me to have any authority over you then I only have the tiniest bit of responsibility towards you and I don’t have to justify myself to you. Especially when I was only trying to do something nice for you. And you got a kick out of it, so at least there was one time in your life when I made you happy for a while.
Oh. Well I guess I can come if you were doing it anyway, just ignore the birthday thing. Am I allowed alcohol though? I mean I'll only be 17...
P.S It was either Iron Man or Spiderman.
Love you forever,
I will have to keep campaigning for the other people imprisoned under the terms of the Act, you realise. But I promise, nothing to land me back in jail. I'm done fighting, time to be selfish for a change. From now on it's you, me and James, and if anyone else needs help they can only have it if it doesn't endanger our family life. It's about time I put you first.
I can't wait for this conference to be over. I only ever used to come to these things to drink and pick up guys. Without that it is just reeeeally boring...
Steve
Natasha,
Grey is Tony, blue is Steve
NATASHA: ...Yeah, well...You could come home anytime, Steve.
Last week, lead psychologist Norman Skyers changed the way we view the Cap/Iron Woman split when he revealed the secret body language between the two suggested this fight was less about politics than it was about procreation. Now, however, a colleague in the field brings a different perspective to the table.
It makes me nervous when you have a surprise. Just tell me it's not another giant stuffed rabbit.
Nattie,
I'm guessing you are in a relationship too, and that your boyfriend likes Peanut butter ice cream, so that is why you had that...
Penny
You don't cook for yourself? Do you have a chef or just order a lot of take out?
Anyway. What I'm supposed to tell you is that we finally found Loki. Actually, he was there when we went to take out King Dick. He had Harry with him, it looked like he was trying to set up some trade or blackmail. Anyway, he saw us (Well, Thor) and high tailed it out of there. So you know, still a sleazy coward, just saying.
Anyway he knew the risks going in, we discussed it at length and he spoke to his Aunt before the press conference (turns out his parents aren't divorced, they died when he was little. Poor kid lives with his elderly aunt.) So you can stop making out like I manipulated him now!
Steve,
I can't believe you got Jarvis to shut down power to my lab! What if I'd been testing a suit?
Dear Penny,
Trust me, I've been shoved in enough lockers over the years to know where I stand. I'm smart and I'm not pretty, basically the perfect storm of unpopularbility. I don't really mind...I'm sort of used to it now...
What I want to know is why someone took pictures, and why your dad had them, and how whoever broke in knew what to look for.
I'm not drunk. Peter is enforcing you no drinking rule. Though he hates me now, so hey maybe you can get him to switch sides again. How nice for you.
The couple insist this separation is just for the period of campaign, in order to avoid any accusations of bias or corruption. However, we have to ask- is it a sign that politics have finally poisoned this marriage made in Superhero Heaven?!
(See the end of the chapter for
Penelope
Tony,
Speaking of dating, how are things between you and Steve? I know you said he was thinking of moving to Washington...is that still happening? I'm sorry I didn't ask before...
Penny
Anyway maybe it is a good thing if someone steps in and tells him to stop. I mean he is only a kid, and this is a dangerous job. He should be worried about homework and girls, not whether a guy with metal arms it gonna snap his neck next time he rescues someone from a fire.
Did I mention I miss you? Though it's nice not having to make breakfast for a change :P
The thing is, your father knows much better how to help you than I ever will. I will always be here for you, but the press and super-villains and alien creatures... what do I know about things like that? I know you want to use your powers for good. I wish you didn't, because I want you safe, but I also know we raised you better than to sit by and do nothing if people need your help. Your Uncle Ben would have been just the same. And I can't help thinking that by bringing you out to Florida, I only helped that monster to take over. I'm so sorry.
Perhaps, for most people, one taste of heroism would be enough, but since that first rescue Nomad has been seen offering his unofficial assistance more than 20 times. Each time, he has left any criminals behind for the police before fleeing, quickly losing his pursuers. Nomad's main powers are said to be his strength and speed, leaving some to suggest that he is not super-human at all but merely very athletic. However, Ms Fernandaz is adamant that Nomad is indeed an unregistered superhuman, saying 'He's a hero. Normal men can't hold up a building that's falling down.'
No-one said anything about you manipulating him, I'm sure he wanted to do it, I just think it was irresponsible to let him. Still, you're ahead in the polls again now, so at least it's worth him getting his head kicked in, right? Seriously, I hope you've got some extra security sorted for the school until this dies down; I'd sleep better. Poor kid is caught right in the middle of all this- and you're right, he's not even old enough to vote in the referendum when the time comes.
So seeing as Spidey keeps running away from me, Cap’s going to give it a go. We think the guy might just be a teenager, so we want to keep an eye on him. Put in a good word, okay? And now back to making my ‘Suck What/Who’s Dick?’ mixtape ringtone!
0800 1111 is an accurate number for Childline, a UK charity able to provide help and counselling to anyone aged 19 and under 24 hours a day. They'll help with any issue, and not only is it a free number- it won't be shown on any bills if dialled from a landline. Please reach out to them if you need help or just to talk and stay safe, guys! :)
I like your hair. It matches your armour. But you don't look quite yourself, so don't keep it too long.
Steve,
He killed HUNDREDS of people. He almost took out the Hulk. He nearly killed Steve. He tried to unleash a NUCLEAR BOMB. He’s also
Tony,
Tony,
I can't wait for you to come home. I've got a surprise for you when this is all over <3
Don't you dare drink to deal with this. I know that's what you do when you're upset and I know that's what you're doing now. But I'm telling you, don't you dare. Not only is it irresponsible when you have James to think about, it's downright disrespectful to Goliath. Not to mention Thor. He's gone and you act like you can replace him with some horrible artificial thing!
And teenagers would come to any party if it’s an open bar. Your friends are talking to you, right?
Sexiest woman alive (also know as Natasha Stark)
Penny,
P.S. If his present was his dick, it is coming off.
You are in so much trouble when I get home!!! I don't know how to discipline kids but I'm gonna work it out and then so so much trouble! There’d better be a damn good explanation!
NATASHA: Eugh, I still can't believe that. For the record I also didn't seduce him to my side.
I will fight this. I'll fight you if I have to. I'm not letting you lock up good people for no reason without even a trial!
I was supposed to say, but by now you’ve probably noticed a suspicious lack of Avengers in the Tower. Well, we don’t like to broadcast to the world when we empty the place out, but we have business… here. Wherever here is. In the middle of, I-don’t-know-Europe-probably. The wifi is terrible, were sleeping in barns or pop-up Shield bases, and Hydra is crawling EVERYWHERE. So all in all, I am only giving this place like one star on TripAdvisor. (The food is surprisingly okay for a place essentially run by a Nazi science cult).
I'm not sure how I was supposed to send the letters to your home when I don't know your address, it isn't exactly public record you know.  If it was I imagine it would be swarming with fans every day.
Penny,
But I guess I want to be there for you and James. So thank you.
Miss you. Sam keeps telling me off for moping. We're watching a lot of dumb action movies.
“The worst thing about this super-separation is the unbearable sexual tension. Half the time I wasn't sure if they were going to tear into each other's politics or just tear off their clothes!”
I'm fine! Or I will be once I have James back... I'm gonna snap that Sin's neck!
Love Capt. Steven G. Stark xxx
It's the last debate in two days, which means five days till I can come home. Let's focus on that.
Seriously though. I guess so far- so far!- this Loki hasn't done anything too evil. So it's your call whether you want to trust him or not, I'll let you judge for yourself. For what it's worth, I still think he's up to something. But maaaaaaaybe it's just the normal 'something' that all teenage boys are up to. Including Vision now apparently. Weird.
Love you,
STEVE: I think he wants you.
That aside, not everyone can reveal their identities. If you do this, you're putting lives at risk. Our friends and colleagues. Please, the vote is tomorrow. I'm asking you not to do this. It's not too late, Nattie.
Natasha.
Penny.
Why are you always asleep when I want to tell you stuff? Come on, aren’t teenagers supposed to be nocturnal? Get it together.
I'm not gay if that is what you are asking, just making an observation. The boys certainly think Lucy is pretty anyway.
Dear Penelope,
[STARK, A. laughing. Fade out]
So how does he do it anyway? Is it an illusion? Shapeshifting? Because honestly a shapeshifting Loki is the last thing I want to worry about. Well, after whatever the hell he was planning to do with Venom after he got it out of you.
I don't really remember too much about my Mother. I sort of remember the big things, like that she used to read me a bedtime story and would never let me sit in the front seat of the car (she thought the back was safer in an accident), but I couldn't tell you her favourite colour or what food she liked or anything like that. I guess we got on well, but I was only a little kid, I'm pretty sure all little girls adore their Mom at that age. Maybe it would had changed if she hadn't left me with my Aunt and Uncle and gotten killed.
One more thing. If I was a proper dad and not just a biological one, I’d tell you to go to Xavier’s School. I’d want you to be safe, because losing you would probably be the worst thing I could imagine.
He nearly killed all the Avengers. At once. Including his brother, who is just about the strongest there is. You might be good, kid, but you aren’t better than all of us combined.
Natasha,
No siblings. Plenty of people have made the claim, but you’re the first where the test came back positive. I don’t think legal was quite sure what to do with you. Paternity tests we’re used to, they have my sample on file because it happens at least once a month. It’s kind of a pain.
Dear Laura,
The rest of it, we'll just have to wait and see...I think it'll be a while before public opinion turns back in your favour, even now they've shown it was all propaganda by Sin, so we'll just have to hope that the jury haven't been swayed and remember you for the hero you are.
The obvious answer, of course, was that when Natasha Stark first developed her suit, she was free and single, whereas now she is a married woman. The change interested Skyers and prompted him to carry out an in-depth study of the couple, examining their body language and tone of voice in joint and individual interviews. With the recent coverage of the debate, he had plenty to choose from; and the conclusions he comes to makes for very interesting reading.
It'll be okay Steve. I won't let them put you away for life, even if I have to keep making appeals until you are free again.
Not guilty- as it is believed anti-registration forces joined Rogers of their own accord; and that Rogers pleaded guilty simply in the hope that anti-registration heroes currently in custody would be released.
We're just arguing in circles here. The problem is, this whole 'war' is getting out of hand. Our teams clashed again last night, and I can't tell my guys not to fight people that are trying to drag them off to jail for not following a law we don't believe is right.
Natasha,
I love you. I'll see you at the motel later?
How is James?
Natasha xxx
Dear Penny,
You were meant to come home and see your surprise...
Well I do aim to please. Maybe I'll go blonde next, match my cockatoo husband :P
You know it isn't fair to leave me behind when I totally stopped your evil robot from hurting Dr Cho. I could help and you know it!
Also, apologies for the disruption to updates last week. This week updates will return to the usual Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday!
Anyway, I’m gonna get a few hours sleep and then we’re having a photo shoot, so, you know, find something nice to wear. And maybe don’t watch the news. But seriously, we need to get a better picture of you out there than your year book photo. Uggh.
How are you doing on your own anyway? I know you look after him all day, but it is harder when you don't get a break. How is he doing with the bottle? He seemed a little fussy with it before I left...maybe we should go back to breast feeding when I'm back. My breasts would certainly prefer it..they are aching like hell... Not sure how I'd have coped without the breast pump.
Second, I'm scared of leaving James with you, and that's the honest truth. Even though I know you love him, even though I've only met him once, even though I'm on the run, part of me wants to come get him and it's getting harder to convince myself not to. So that's where I'm at.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm done. I thought I knew you... I thought I knew who I was in love with. I might have disagreed with your politics, but I still loved you. Only now this isn't politics any more, is it? This is right and wrong and you're on the wrong side. So now I don't know what to think.
If it's tied to your emotions, maybe you should stop worrying about being a monster, huh? Because I promise you you're not.
Okay, one, don’t flatter yourself, Miss Relative-Strength-of-a-Spider. The lock down was never designed to keep people in; in fact I deliberately made it so it was easy to get out of from inside. In case, you know, I ever got locked in with a psychopath. If you’d been outside trying to break in, do you really think the shutters would have pulled apart so easily? Don’t make me laugh.
Steve xxx
Pen Pen,
I don't really remember much about my Mom, but I'm pretty sure she named out toaster something... No idea about the teeth thing though.
So that was my evening, how is it going with the Hydra base?
You have to talk to them. You have to stop this. Otherwise I will.
Penny.
Don't worry, I wasn't expecting some grand romantic tale. I knew I was born shortly after my Mom got married, so to be honest I was worried she'd cheated on my Step Dad. I'm glad she didn't.
Penny,
Look, I would just tell you straight if I didn’t want you on this little road trip, but the point is, someone needs to man the base. I don’t want Loki or Hydra or any weird guys in goblin masks making this any worse. And if you must know, it was Cap’s plan, not mine. I wanted you with us.
Steve,
P.S I'm not sure about the ethics of putting a turn off switch in someone's body....
[beat]
I, on the other hand, am very jealous of your skirt and intend to get up close and personal with your legs myself as soon as I get to the hotel tomorrow. Then I'm going to move on to the rest of you, and not just using my eyes.
I'm embarking on a prison break. You can add that to your list of things to talk about when you get back.
But if you don't want to see me, then maybe we could just keep writing for a while? I do have some questions afterall...Like do you remember my mother at all?
I've got a meeting with some members of the Government tomorrow. I think they want me to help with the registration process.
It looked to us like Loki had been using the basement. That’s what he said, anyway, and we found bedding and stuff rolled up in a corner. I wouldn’t put it past the creepy little dude to have been perving though, in which case, yes, it is totally justified to remove his eyes with kitchen utensils. Excuse me for pointing this out, but he must have been in your room sometime to find your letters. So yeah, go ahead with the maiming. Also, showers with multiple heads are amazing and you are a poor underprivileged girl to have never tried one before.
What? That isn't fair! All my friends go to Midtown, I'm not transferring just to run away from Loki!!
The plan is to stay out of prison, but it's not to stop doing what's right. If we can't just go to Shield and get the clone, then we'll find another way. What if we told the papers about it? Most people would have ethical concerns, right? And we've seen first hand the damage these articles can do, maybe it's time we turned it to our advantage.
So I don't want to say I told you so, but I totally did. I said if you went for Loki he'd go underground, and now you have no idea where he is. If you'd left him, he'd still be at school and we'd at least have some idea about what he is doing.
I will attempt to activate them from here.
I never said I minded people finding out you are my Dad, I thought you didn't want people to know you had a kid.
P.S. You weren’t going to go to prom? But everyone goes to prom. Just buy a dress and put it on my tab or something.
So it's possible, just possible, that I may have been interrupted last night while I was doing the update. And then it's just possible that I went to the circus and in the process forgot to post the last chapter of yesterday's section. My apologies.
You locked me in the tower, for what could have been days! What was I supposed to do?! And you know, really you should be thanking me for discovering such a big flaw in your security system. Better I found it then some bad guy right?
Five guys burgers are the best! There is no contest :P
Loki is in blue, Penny in grey
Tony,
I thought you were sixteen?
You do remember I have spider powers right? I don't need an escort! If you are worried about me I'll just webswing home, it is way faster.
A couple of my guys have had a bit of trouble, mainly it seems to be when they around a crowd of people. All it takes is one person to make a comment and suddenly there is an angry mob.
Well I'm pretty good at building things, I built my webshooters after all, and designed the web fluid.(I can't remember if I mentioned that my spider powers don't include the ability to shoot webs, I had to add that part myself.) But I guess over all I prefer Chemistry and Biology. I'll still take a look at MIT though, who knows I might like that place best whatever I take.
is rattled. But we’re fine.
Now that's established, can we please try to remember what Melissa said about 'stupid' being an 'unhelpful word'? As I'm sure you know, marriages can be lost or won depending on the amount of unhelpful words. (Did you ever notice that Melissa only went into the useless textbook babble stuff when we went too deep into the superhero stuff? I guess even therapists have their limits.)
Stark,
Sam said he got spat on again yesterday, and that he had to break up two different fights between powered people. Things are getting a little heated out there. I'm doing the rounds of the team today, reminding people we're settling this democratically and you don't beat someone up for having a different opinion. I hope none of yours got hurt. (Even if they are wrong :P)
Anyway, STAY AWAY FROM LOKI. I don’t know why I have to say that so much, but do it. Skip school if you have to and get out of there. It won’t be coincidence that he’s there, I assure you.
To be honest, Pen-Pen, we were planning on some ‘revels’ anyway. So you can either come and have cake and presents or you can come and pretend it isn’t (almost) your birthday. You can still do the happy families stuff with May when she gets back.
Jarvis-
Why can you never trust me?
It’s been a really weird day.
you don’t need Spyder man to make yourself feel it. You shouldn’t anyway but there you go
NATASHA: Of course I did, I'm not all that heartless.
You'll need to talk to Aunt May, I'm not leaving home without her.
Seeing as you don’t seem to be getting it, here is a clear and comprehensive list of people you should be avoiding:
NATASHA:
Penny.
I'm sorry about Jarvis, I know he was your friend. I told Steve to hug you.
Oh don't worry about me sweetheart, I know how to put a disguise together. You do like red heads right? <3
I tried spiking my hair up a little in the front like the kids do, just for you. Tell me what you think. (Picture attached)
P.S You say that like we don't have robots to vacuum.
Steve,
Mary Jane told Harry where I was staying remember? It isn't like he is spying on me. I don't need to go to a safe house! Super Strength remember?
I don’t know who Spiderman is, but I can guarantee he is not as cool as me. So good choice, nice to know you have some common sense.
Steve xx
Gwen isn't romanticising Flash. She doesn't think we should go out, she just thinks we should clear the air and then maybe he'd stop picking on me and we could start to be friends. I told her I don't want to talk to him and I don't want to be his friend, but she just thinks i'm being stubborn.
The last time we saw Harry, Harry was with him. Now we don't know where Harry is. Do the math.
I remember Sam. I asked him about his wings, but he didn't seem to know much about the technical details. He said I could look at them sometimes, if I promised not to touch any of the mechanics.
I told him there wasn't a problem, so that seemed to make him feel better. Plus he gave me a hug, which was nice ~~
Osbourne (Elder and Junior)
P.S That Atkins bitch sent me a letter offering me therapy, so we could talk about your abuse. Do you think it is still covered by doctor/patient confidentiality if I book an appointment and then just slap her?
(Make a Wish letter enclosed)
Steve,
Natasha. Xxx
Don't worry about Peter, I pulled him out too. He is in the spare room.
Good luck on your mission. Come back safe.
Steve xxxx
Aunt May has agreed to Vision going with us, mainly because I don't she is able to actually say No to Captain America. You know, her Mother was one of the dancing girls in Cap's show? Apparently he took her helmet to goes save a bunch of solider in Italy or something, Steve seemed to remember her a little anyway.
Tony,
Steve xxx
P.S It wasn't his dick
Sorry that must all sound really weird, I'm just kind of interested in the psychology of it. I think if I was ever a super hero, I'd see it as being too separate entities, like a dual personality but...not crazy. I imagine that would make it easier to compartment your life into different sections, Hero life and Civilian life. But I guess if I did it i'd have to have a secret identity, where as you are just out in the open.
Steve xxx
You like peanut butter cups? In that case, would you know anything about the peanut butter ice cream that’s gone missing from the freezer?
Another thing. Did you work out how Sin got into your dad's old mansion to get those photos? She may not be manipulating you any more, and I know Strange says Faustus won't be able to influence you again, but what's to say she won't show up and attack you again at home? Please be careful. Let Peter stop a bit longer. He's pretty handy when it comes to a fight. Also, he makes good cookies and terrible jokes.
Dear Steve,
Blue is Lucy, grey is Penny
Dear Tony,
Dear Tony,
You are nuts, you know that? You're messed up in the head. Harry GASSED you. You were out for days. Then he threatened to reveal your identity. You know where he was, when we picked him up after your letter? Half way to the Bugle. Some friend.
I miss you.
I didn't find anything at her office. It was totally empty, no furniture or anything. I checked manually and with a scan for secret or concealed entrances, but nothing. Sam went to see the realtor Atkins hired the office from and they said she'd only taken out a month's let, signed the papers last week. For the address, she put mine. My address from 1943, before I shipped out. The block doesn't even exist any more. But whoever she really is, she knows a lot about me.
Maybe you should try talk to Wanda about Steve.
'You can see it in the way he cuts questions off before the speaker is finished,' Laura confided, referring to the Captain's open Q&A at New York University yesterday. 'Particularly when the speaker is a woman. You can also see it in the way he squares up to his wife in the debates- this is a show of dominance. Remember this is a man who started his career as nothing more than military propaganda but who seized control and insisted on having things his own way. He was also raised in a time that sadly believed women ought to 'know their place', in a very traditional background. There have been tensions in the relationship ever since they got married, and now we see them coming to a head.'
You don't need to come down. I'm fine and you are busy, so i'll just start packing some of my things.
Penny
Bacon tastes better off a Bunsen burner. Fact. And like I know what kitchen appliances I own. I’m not even totally sure where my kitchen is.
I'm going through all the records Shield has on old Hydra bases. If this bitch is Red Skull's daughter, than maybe she is holed up in one.
But I doubt you care about that right now, I think you are probably more concerned about why I didn't show up with the others at your little prison break.
So no. No he is not coming to the party, especially when people are after him. Let’s file that under bad ideas and move on.
Penny,
I'm not moving to some suburban neighbourhood with a picket fence, I don't care what your fantasy is. Where the hell would I put the lab? Underground? I'm not a mole Steve.
He didn't mention Harry...I sort of assumed he left him with the Avengers.
Natasha.
P.S. Don’t tell Steve about the Ultron project. If I try to explain it before I can show him exactly what Bruce and I are trying for, he’s going to be all sucky and dumb about it.
'I was just starting to get my confidence back after he turned himself in,' one twitter-user wrote, 'But I guess he really doesn't stand for justice at all #confesscap'
I noticed the writing...but I don't think I wanted to believe it. She could have faked it...somehow...make it so you wouldn't trust me...
Look all I was saying was if you want to keep us a secret you need to keeps the amount of lies you tell to the minimum. The more you tell the more you are likely to get caught out and then people will be suspicious about why you were lying in the first place....but I guess it came off a little snappy...so, sorry.
Tell May not to worry. I’m not going to do anything. Spiderman might though. If he’s not your friend, you really do need to tread carefully.
It sounds like you and Cap are pretty good friends, that is nice :) Though I think I'll keep your theories to myself...Cap sort of has a lot of fans amongst the girls at school. If I told them any of these I'd probably be more of an outcast then I already am...
So it sounds like you had it half under control most of the time. You didn't kill anyone, but you did beat the crap out of like three different criminals you went after. Two of them are okay, one of them is still in the hospital.
I guess that makes sense, we only go down the basement to do laundry and that is all Aunt May. I'm banned from using the machine ever since I turned some of our bed sheets red...turns out I shouldn't just shove my suit in there without looking. I've hand washed it since, though it takes forever.
Penny.
I love you, I love you, I love you. I don't know what will happen now... hopefully they'll just continue with the trial. But they will probably add escaping onto my list of charges. Would they accept it as exonerating circumstances if I prove that I was just trying to rescue my son? Although, no-one believes he is my son, do they? They think I'm your abusive husband and that when I left you decided to father a child with a teenager. A teenager who we now owe about 5,000 favours, by the way.
I'll dye it back in a little while, but not before the papers get their fill of “OMG Stark's ' 'Red Hot' new look!”
Don't worry, Aunt May will be on photo duty. She seems pretty excited that I'm going to a dance for once. She even helped Pepper pick out a dress, and by help I mean argue about which colour suited me better. I didn't go with the red and gold one, just in case you told Pepper to recommend it. That is a bit too flashy for me. I went with blue instead, blue suits me :P
It's alright. At least they're letting us send letters.
I’m not sure Spiderman does have it all under control. If she’s just out for revenge, she’s doing it for the wrong reasons. Understandable, maybe, but if the police catch her there will be trouble. I don’t think she’s going to get Cap to back down.
Tony,
I can't do this alone.
Natasha,
As for the bet, you have a deal. I warn you though, I'm going to be turning on all the USO-buy-some-war-bonds-cause-we're-broke-tour charm, not to mention the hi-I'm-a-national-treasure-apparently stuff in the debate tomorrow. I think by the end of it even you'll be on my side. :P
P.S. I admire you too, Spidey.
P.S You sent Spiderman? Really? Is he old enough to drink himself?! You are lucky his Aunt's Chicken soup is so good...
And honestly, maybe Loki has taken over your mind. It would explain all the stupid lately.
And as for Osbourne, we don’t know what he can do yet. Just because he thinks his son was at prom with you yesterday doesn’t mean he wouldn’t slit your throat as soon as look at you. This is the guy that tried to out me at thirteen to win a contest, the guy who ratted you out to the papers, who is keeping the ACME My First Villain kit locked up in a pretend-y liquor cabinet! Why won’t you ever listen?!
Penny
Steve,
play the piano. What he does is painfully hen peck out Three Blind Mice and something he insists is called ‘Dashing Away with the Smoothing Iron’. Apparently he used to trade his cigarette ration for lessons during the USO tours. I think he was conned, to be honest. Anyway, I demand that you have a rematch on the arm wrestling and video it, so I can remind him of it when he is being insufferable with the whole ‘Leadership is a burden but I’m going to boss you all around anyway’ act. That guy drives me nuts.
Tony,
Steve xxxx
Oh yeah I'm totally gonna answer the phone when I'm under the influence of a truth potion! I barely made it past Aunt May!
Obstructing the course of justice
Penny
Penny
Come get me soon.
Steve xxx
They won't talk to me here...
He has your eyes.
What about the people around them Steve? Don't they deserve protection?!
Osbourne senior is safely locked up, don't worry, but for all we know he was training up his son as a nutty protégé. Just look out, okay? And tell your friend to be on the watch for suspicious characters. Poor girl is probably having a hard enough time being the new girl without being overshadowed by you.
Fury isn't going to keep her forever Tony, just until she isn't a danger to herself or anyone else.
Why are you still even talking to that jerk he sold you out to his dad! And stay away from Flash too.
NATASHA: See you soon.
Take this, you might need it. Good luck, soldier.
Natasha
I also believe that Mrs Stark's current state of unconsciousness may caused by a form of hypnosis. It would also explain why she did not seem to register James' absence for so long.
For the record I'm I got to meet you too. And I get to act like a kid sometimes, I'm a teenager :P
of you. Don't you think that skirt was a little short for national television? Or was that the plan? Blind them with your amazing thighs so that they ignore the flaws in your argument? :P
Though i'm sure I could find some use for a couple Cap clones ;P
I'm not really sure what I want, but I would like some sort of relationship. You know I'm 16 right? Not 5, there isn't really a lot you could do to mess me up at this point, I'm pretty much fully formed.
I’m guessing you’re pissed with me now. Well, congratulations, that’s what having a deadbeat for a dad is all about.
He was probably just a little intimated when he saw you, I mean you are a pretty big deal. I'm sure he didn't mean to be rude.
Penny
He said he just wanted to know Spiderman's identity because I 'saved his life', and since I wouldn't give up the information willingly, he decided to spike the punch. He wasn't being evil so much as an ass, and I'm not sure where is he because I left him at the Prom. Didn't want to go spilling any more secrets so through it was best to ditch.
Natasha.
Really? An internship would be amazing! Though I'd feel a little bad getting one just because I'm your kid, maybe I could just apply or something? I'd guess you wouldn't want people knowing who I was anyway.
I know that is bad, but what was I meant to do? I was like being peer pressured into being his friend! Anyway isn't there some saying about keeping your friends close and you enemies closer? Well it was like that.
(See the end of the chapter for
I know you don't agree with Fury's decision to take your Daughter in, but threatening to blow up one of his Helicarriers is just going to land you in a cell down the hall.
Steve,
Doesn't mean there aren't some out there. They were no positive tests before me after all :P
Dear Ever Sexy Wife,
Penny.
You know I'd come home if I could, but I need to keep them safe too. We have to think about what sort of world we want our children to grow up in, and I can't in good conscience let them grow up in a world where superhumans are branded and controlled like some sort of dangerous animal. I have to see this through to the end, so they can grow up free and without fear.
Steve,
P.S I thought other than your place, the only floors above me were R&D?
I asked Harry about his Dad, he says he's been ill the past couple days, but with what I don't know. Harry didn't really go into detail, and I know it is best not to push when it comes to his Dad. Oh, Mary Jane kind of let slip about you being my Dad to him aswell by the way. Sorry, I know you didn't really want him to know. I asked him to keep it quiet for now.
Darling, I think you've been with me long enough to know it is impossible for me to not get a room full of people to love me, specially when the majority of them are old white men who seemed to enjoy my skirt ;P
P.S. Just so you know, Clint won't walk me home anymore. Atleast not until I admit that In n out burgers are better than Five Guys (Which they aren't!)
Penny
Dear Mr Stark,
I hate it. It is too small and too...normal. There is barely room for my Lab! I'm having to have it put in the basement >:(
P.S I'll try and get a recording, but I'm not sure I'll be able to do it without Cap noticing.
My team wants to fight you. I don't know what I can say that would justify stopping them, except that when they say they won't kill anyone that's what you said too. I know you didn't mean it to happen.
I want to meet you, so bad. But I really need to work on what I'm going to say to the press. I don't care if it's a man or a woman, if someone is endangering lives I'm taking them out. I didn't kill her, she went to trial. It should be on record.
Penny,
There’s not really anything I need to ask. Anything you want to tell me? Ask me? You could tell me what you’re going to do with the 50k, if you like. You realise that’s not college money. I’ll send college money when you get to it, so you and your aunt knock yourselves out. Go on vacation or something. I like Paris in the spring time :P
Penny
Fine, let me tell you what the consequences are.
Still, do you at least believe he’s up to something now? It’s not even like he was going to Asgardian jail, he was just going to stay there with his brother. Besides, innocent people don’t run, let alone send threatening notes. Just be careful. Wear the pin I gave you at all times, understand? And call the Avengers number if there’s any sign of trouble.
Tony,
NATASHA:
Well it isn't exactly ethical, but technically it is my job to encourage registration, not hunt down those who won't sign up. If anyone finds out I'll just say that I was avoiding the bad PR that would come with arresting my own husband. People are meant to trust me, not think I'm a heartless bitch after all.
P.P.S It is pretty hard to make no comment when you are being asked the same thing A MILLION TIMES! In the end I just started saying 'it's complicated' and then moving away as fast as I could.
Well I can't do that and I can't do this either. If your Pigheaded cause is more important than you family then fine!
Natasha xxx
So, I'd like to take you up on the offer :)
Tony,
P.S. You would be an excellent mom, if you wanted to be. Do you?
Chicken soup? Are you sick? You need to be careful. Anyway, Peter might be young but he was eager to help out, plus he felt guilty enough about screwing me over during the campaign that I know he's going to take his job seriously and watch you like a hawk. Just think of him as a live in Intern/babysitter.
His rib is broken. It'll heal, but he isn't comfortable.
Atleast if they need him for something they might not kill him. I don't know what i'm going to do if they hurt him...i was supposed to be looking after him...
Are you really going to disappoint a poor teenage girl?
Congratulations on the birth of your son. I hope he is doing okay and that you'll both be feeling fit and healthy soon.
Penny
None of their opinions matter, Penny. They'll print inflammatory stuff just to sell papers. Just let them get on with it, seriously.
Penny.
You already gave me $50,000. I think you are good on presents for a while.
Speaking of being 'out'... just how pretty is this Lucy girl anyway? You know I was joking about the bad influence thing. I'd hope I'm the worst influence on your life, just saying. Anyway, I'd much rather you dated a girl you liked rather than Loki or Dick Jr. Neither of them have shown up there, right?
Those plans weren't meant to be used that way, but Pym is part of the team the Government set up and when he suggested it...I didn't put up a fight.
P.P.S. Also sending a tracker badge. Pin it on when you go out snapping the Spider-tool and it’ll activate if you get into any trouble. I don’t want you getting mugged walking around the streets at night with an expensive camera looking for criminals.
I promised Harry I go over and help him with his study, but I can swing by the lab afterwards. Say around 8 tonight?
Anyway, the 'fee' for his services was the right to go on one date with you without my 'interference'. That doesn't mean you can't say no when (s)he asks. Say no.
I miss you so much. I'm starting to wish we hadn't started this.
I'm calling your aunt and telling her exactly who 'Luke' is. Did you forget all the corpses he left around?! Hundreds of people?! That's more than 'a little misguided'!
My background check on Dr Atkins shows no sign of her beyond a year ago. I believe she may have planned to get close to Mrs Stark in order to kidnap James from the start.
Apologies for the late update today. I'm a silly. XD
P.S. About Osbourne’s indestructible liquor cabinet. Was the glass in it clear or blacked out?
Penny
Dear Ms Parker,
I've been thinking a lot about what you said over the last few days.
Penny
Someone has to force peace. It's never going to happen on it's own.
Dear Nattie,
P.S Captain America called me Penelope today, so maybe you aren't that great at lying :P I don't mind since he only seems to know my name, but don't let him talk to my Aunt okay?

'Steve has made a mistake,' she said. 'People may have been sympathetic before, particularly as he gave himself up and was ready to serve the cause of justice. Now, I don't see any way he can avoid a jail term.'
Tony,
I love you.
Oh wanna know something cool? I'm stronger than Cap :P or atleast I can lift more than he can. I guess the serum gave him enhanced strength rather than super strength, where as I'm pretty sure I have the relative strength of a Spider. I'm not sure though, I’ve not really tested how much I can lift or anything.... but yeah long story short I beat Cap in an arm wrestle :) He wants me to try against that Thor guy next.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it. When I was growing up, people always said 'my wife is having a baby' because she was the one carrying it. I sort of feel like I'm taking more credit than I should if I say say 'we'. But still, if it's what you want, I will next time.
What, didn’t they teach people to read in the 30s?
And I thought it went pretty well. You have to admit, more people seemed to support me at the end than did at the start. We're on our way to a normal-sized house, darling.
JARVIS: Ms Stark? Apologies for disturbing you, but someone has attempted to use the Captain's security override to enter the mansion
I do not look like a cockatoo. You just can't handle this level of cool.

Fun, huh? Maybe we should have a big row in public, keep them happy.

After some technical difficulties, I think I have worked out how to update from the tablet! Which means new chapters even from the mystical land of Cornwall, huzzah!
P.S The men might have liked it, but the skirt was totally for you <3 Just a little reminder or what is waiting at home.
Steve,
I told you Osbourne was up to something :D I know I said I’d stop saying that, but hey, after finding some definitely-dodgy villain-esque equipment hidden away, I get to gloat. I’m done now, probably.
maybe, if it's what the people want, we could have some more controls. Laws. Maybe people could be prosecuted for irresponsible use of their powers. Only being made to reveal their identity if they have to. I mean, Captain America could go on trial as easily as Steve Stark, right?
Steve says we’ll come to dinner. So thanks, I guess. Do you need us to play straight bff or will she survive the shock of us being a couple? (Although, Cap is depressingly strict on PDA. Even if we don’t she probably won’t notice.)
STEVE: Then let me say goodbye to my son.
As to the house, we'd put your lab out in the shed, obviously. Never known you to chicken out of a bet. But then I guess you know you're wrong this time, right?
Spiderman onto her side? After being a staunch ally of Captain America at the beginning of the pre-vote campaigns, Parker did seem to switch sides rather quickly. Let's face it, he wouldn't be the first boy to have his head turned by a pretty face; and he wouldn't be the first handsome young man to be connected to Ms Stark. Perhaps it was news of his impending fatherhood that prompted him to move into the mansion.
Penny,
Even if this war is all over tomorrow, even if we get all our guys out of your prison tonight and overthrow this act, I don't know if I could come home to you right now.
Penny,
Anyway, do you mind if we wait until after the vote to go public with it? I don't want it to look like a publicity stunt, or risk taking away any more from the main issue. I swear the papers these days are more interested in making up lies about the state of our marriage than talking about the issue itself.
NATASHA: Then come back when you have some real ideas.
Nomad was first spotted two months ago, entering a burning building after the firefighters had been forced to withdraw in order to rescue a mother and two young children. According to the mother, Julia Fernandaz, 34, the ceiling above them collapsed but was held up by Nomad long enough for them to crawl to safety. Fernandaz described Nomad as at that time hiding his face with a scarf and winter hat, suggesting the covering was very likely improvised and the rescue done on a whim.
You know what really gets me, though? The nurses called and said they'd even been turning up trying to interview Peggy. She barely even remembers who I am!
Penny
Nattie,
I miss you. And I can see the bump, even if no-one else has noticed. You look beautiful.
Nattie,
In a shocking turn of events, Steven Rogers, aka Captain America, has today turned himself in to the authorities. It is believed that this is a direct result of the death of hero Goliath earlier this week. In a pre-prepared statement released to the press shortly before his surrender, Rogers had this to say:
Steve,
Just don't say...or imply anything bad about my Mom okay? It isn't like she is here to defend herself....
But you are wrong, you must understand that by now. Please don't do this, Natasha. A few years ago, you wouldn't give up your iron man suit up to the military and now you want to hand it over to the government? We'd become federal mercenaries and you know it. If you want people to be accountable, let's do it right and do it ourselves. They can answer to the Avengers.
P.s I won't fit in the armour when I'm fat.
STEVE: I still don't like the idea of federal registration and control, especially not now, after all this.
STEVE: ....get rid of negative zone imprisonment. Please. I should be here, I want to be here!
P.S. Sorry, but with banter that lame you’re capped at an 8. You were too busy trying to do a ‘man voice’ to think of any actually witty responses, weren’t you?
You should have told me as soon as she wouldn't tell you where James was.
Nattie,
BABY:
STEVE: I have to disagree.
Natasha.
As for James, you know stopping him from being cute is physically impossible, right? He just is cute. Or, he is cute at least 80% of the time when he isn't screaming. And he's fine with a bottle, you know he's fine with a bottle, he uses a bottle every day while you're at work. He's also displaying the 'Three Signs Your Baby is Ready to Start Solid Foods', so we might try that later.
Steve,
Shut down isn't good enough. Unless it's sentient, unless it's actually alive, you need to destroy the clone.
Dear Natasha,
Of course, it’s entirely possible that it’s just Hawkeye going through one of his periodic goofy image changes. Although, you can usually spot those by the fact they use a freaking bow and arrow. He’s a master of disguise, seriously.
Dear Natasha 'Likes to Constantly Remind People of Her Sexiness' Stark,

P.S. You don’t have to call me ‘Mr Stark’. My friends call me Tony.
I can...
that you didn’t have long left. I didn’t actually lie, so really, the misunderstanding is his fault. Besides, you got a kick ass recording, Steve got to do a good deed, I got a good laugh, it was win/win/win, right?
I’ll give you a heads up about Avengers’ missions when I get one. We usually have to move pretty fast. I don’t have much time to write right now either. Clint’s flying the jet and Steve and Nat are trying to coax Thor into letting them bandage the wrist he refuses to accept is sprained. Jocks, right? Meanwhile, I’m supposed to be finding the next target. Shouldn’t be too hard, Hydra is not particularly subtle.
No one is experimenting on me, don't worry. You know how I told you I knew Harry Osborn? Well since we go to school together, his Dad let our class go on a field trip around one of his labs. They were doing some experiments on Spiders and one of them got out and after it bit me I got spider powers. I think it was radioactive or something.

Parker, a high school student, is 16 years old and therefore technically legally allowed to consent to sexual intercourse. He has also moved into the Stark mansion in recent weeks, where he and Mrs Stark are alone and unsupervised, apart from Parker's elderly aunt. Although she is more than old enough to be his mother, is it possible that Natasha Stark

That aside, I hear he’s going to do some training with Spidey. It’ll be a little while before you can do it at the Tower though, I need to reprogram the training room. I’ll do it when I get chance, okay? Soon, for sure; I just have my hands full with the Ultron project right now. Your mom didn’t leave any of her notes round the house, did she? Anyway, in the meantime I guess you can do it on rooftops or whatever, right? It’ll be ready for you soon.
I'm not sure she'd feel comfortable dropping by Avengers Tower yet either.
Natasha,
Natasha Stark was taken into hospital late last night for what is believed to be pregnancy complications and the early onset of labour. She was accompanied by May Parker, who has been living with her for several months since her nephew and ward Peter revealed his identity as Spiderman.
I know you think I’m overreacting, but better that than underestimating him.
I've been re-reading Sin's note. She wants me to suffer from this, that sounds like her main motive. Chances are, that means James is still alive because she'll want to pull some big stunt where I'll see it.
Steve,
. Attached are the names and pictures of everyone he killed while he was here. Eleven of them were SI employees, just going about their business in the tower that day. If you really think Loki is different, if you really, truly, honestly believe that, I want you to go through each and every fucking one of them, look those pictures in the eye and pretend you’re explaining to them and their families why you’re trusting the scumbag that killed them. Explain to them, because I sure as hell don’t get it. I bet you don’t get to the end before you’re sick.
I'm more worried about you getting lonely without me. I'm cooped up in a small apartment with my best friend, you're the one rattling around in an indecently sized mansion all on your own. We seriously need to downsize. How about this? If you win the Registration debate we keep the 15 bedrooms, but if I win we get a nice normal sized house that won't take approximately three days to vacuum? Come on, Stark, let's make this more interesting :P
(Cap tells me Shield is looking into it, though. I’m just not allowed to join in because apparently I’m ‘biased’.)
Don't worry. I'll take good care of you daughter.
I'm eating and sleeping fine! Have you been talking to Jarvis? He is filling your space of making a big deal out of nothing when it comes to my health.
I don't really have any ideas for boys names. Just not Howard.
That was sweet of you.
Thanks a lot Asshole, now we are moving to Florida!
Just invite some friends along, okay? It doesn’t have to be a big deal. Although it doesn’t sound like those girls are being particularly good friends right now. I thought you said Gwen was smart? Listen to me, kid, this Flash asshole? He can’t abuse you for years and then act like it’s all romantic because he likes you. If he likes you he should have, you know, been decent to you. I would tell him to get lost, preferably violently. And tell Gwen to stop romanticising dickheads before she gets hurt.
It doesn't sound like you have the healthiest diet...if I don't eat Aunt May guilts trips me, and she is pretty strict on how much we can have take out. Maybe you should try a home cooked meal now and then, even if you aren't the one who cooks it.
It is the Captain, ma'am.
Whether we should try to deal with our disagreeing politics or avoid the arguments

Tony,
He better not do anything cute while I'm gone! He already crawled while I was at work, if he looks like he is going to walk you better stop him! Give him a cookie, a new toy, I don't care! Anything short of pushing him over, I want to be there for his first steps :(
But seeing as I know you'll say that's too wishy-washy and a fantasy, what if we recruited some new members for the Avengers? Peter's proved himself pretty handy. Maybe we should have him around more permanently.
Tony,
P.S. Sending you a vintage MCR tee. I thought it would match this new aesthetic you've got going on.
I don't really mind her being here, she seems pretty cool for an old broad. Plus she cooks, so that is a plus. Without you here i've mainly been on take aways lately.
Don’t be jelly? Is that seriously a phrase kids use now? Really? And I’m not. I can have Steve hugs whenever I want, and then some. Just saying~~~
This is ridiculous! Since when has anyone cared what Beetle has to say?! I've hit that bitch twice as hard as you ever had and she deserved it!
Penny,
I've told you, I'm fine. Just a little sleepy.
Natasha.
Dear Mr Corbett,
If the crib has Wifi we can attach the Stark pad and let it watch Dora the Explorer when it is being fussy. But fine, I'll give it a once over and make sure it'll last, I'll probably add a few improvements to whatever we buy anyway.
And I’m pretty sure Loki was involved. He shows up at the Tower for reasons unknown, apparently does nothing when you’re busy inhaling hallucinogenic gas, and then disappears the same time as Osbourne? Come on, kid. And let me see this so called ‘birthday present’. I bet you $10 it’s a nice hallucinogenic gas bomb, pre-used.
Im drunk right now but it’s your fault because you’re going to
Enjoy bff-ing with Cap. How nice.
It is as of yet unclear what effect this will have on the consequences of the SHRA. Despite Rogers' call for peace, many believe it is likely that his anti-registration forces will continue to resist, particularly now some are calling Rogers a 'martyr'. Natasha Stark, Rogers' estranged wife and figurehead of the pro-registration movement, could not be reached for comment.
You’re 17. Making mistakes is basically your job. If it makes you feel any better, when I was 17 I had four girlfriends at once. And they all found out when drunk-me decided inviting them to an orgy and referring to them as my ‘harem’ would be a good idea. (Hint- it wasn’t.)
Well I'm pretty sure he wasn't involved! He knew I was going to arrest Osbourne, why not just stop me before I took him in? Plus he wasn't the one who hit me with the bomb! That was...someone else.
P.S. Not you too. I buy Steve a Wii and all he wants to do is collect fossils. (I guess he identifies with them :P) Anyway, he just completed the collection last week. He’s very proud.
Finally, please find enclosed details of a 2% stake in Stark Industries shares (an equivalent stake to members of the board). At the time of writing, shares are valued at $2,003. On your eighteenth birthday, your stake will automatically increase to 25% if you have not previously sold your shares.
But no matter what arguments I make or how many times I re-read your points in these e-mails, I just keep wondering, what if you're right? What if James did inherit the serum? Is that what we want? For him to be marked and watched by the government his whole life? To be enlisted when they think they need the extra power? At least in the war, we knew who we were fighting and why, we knew it was the right thing to do. There was a clear enemy. But now, things are a lot less black and white. He could be made to do anything, so could you. And even if they never called on him, they'd be keeping tabs on him the whole time. Everyone would know who he was and what he could do. He'd never have a choice about it.
jerk. There are usually elbows involved. What I’m saying is, the guy plays like super dirty because he doesn’t see it as cheating. Ask him to rig the deck when we play cards, though, and nooo, that’s super dishonourable. It drives me crazy.
I also looked up the Ultron project. It was something I started while my Dad was still calling the shots, automaton soldiers and guards. To be honest, it was more about seeing if we could- I was building on what I’d already done with the robot arms, to see if we could form an independently operating body. It got shelved when I took over the business and had more important stuff to focus on, especially as we hadn’t made much progress. It seems to have some potential though, I might go back to it. So thanks for reminding me, I guess.
'Women for easy sex'? Did you seriously just write that? Do you maybe want to re-phrase that in a way that doesn't make you sounds like a misogynistic prick? Bearing in mind you, you know, SLEPT WITH MY MOTHER!
Your uncle’s death wasn’t your fault.
Natasha,
I'll see what I can dig up on the trial, it might not be my Dad who buried everything. The Government probably didn't want it out that a Nazi spy got onto American soil either. There is bound to be something somewhere.
