“What’s happening?” Clint asked.
Tony didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted- just just wanted to stay there in Steve’s arms and hide from the world, but he knew he couldn’t. He separated from Steve, looking up at him with wide sad doe eyes, “I.. I was kidnapped…”
It was a slow day at the coffee shop. Steve was at one of the tables, wiping it, when his best bud, Bucky Barnes announced his presence loudly, followed by his girlfriend Natasha. They were still in the honeymoon phase, having broken up and come back together multiple times. Steffens rolled his eyes at their entrance, “hello, welcome to coffee bean, can I get your order?”
Tony knew this story, having heard it from his father, but he listened dutifully. There were details he hadn’t heard before, and it calmed him to hear about what really happened to Bucky Barnes. Tony’s heart broke all over again when he heard Steve talk about how his best friend fell to his death on that fatal train ride.
Tony was entranced. He felt like someone else. The tingle of fear that was not his own, misplaced anxiety, and
“Hey, Tony,” Steve greeted.
Steve sighed, turning around with an unreadable expression, “alright.”
Steve muttered filthy promises into Tony’s ear, “if I had my way- which I do- I would be fucking you on every surface of this prison, the walls, the bathroom, in the showers, on the breakfast tables, in the halls, on the fucking field, midst the flowers were you belong, show everyone you are mine, that your gorgeous ass is all mine and only mine.”
“Three months- you and your brother look exactly the same! You can’t tell me you weren’t thinking of how that could-“
Tony smiled and Steve could see that it was false, “of course, why wouldn’t I be?”
“Uh?” Those doe eyes trained on him and he felt like he was in cloud nine, “Did you ring it up?”
“Good,” Steve kissed him, then, slowly, excruciatingly slowly, he pushed all the way in, until his cock pushed against Tony’s prostate, and Tony felt full, head high in the clouds.
Tony continued not to speak, mulling over Steve’s words.
Steve was shocked, “you couldn’t be more than 6 when you presented.”
“Tony. Tony, honey, love, are you alright?” Steve asked, stopping with his cock sheathed deeply within his lover.
“Yeah,” Steve said, “yeah, he was considered a nobody. But he was a somebody in my eyes.”
A loud slam alerted Steve’s attention to the front door.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed, “I’d like to hang out.”
“Tony,” Steve continued in that soft tone. That pitying tone that Tony hated.
It did nothing to help his situation.
“People talk to me so they can get on my brother’s good side, well, here I’m telling you that won’t work!” Tony shouted.
“Fuck off, Stark.”
The room erupted into chaos.
Steve pulled his fingers out and Tony whimpered, doe eyes wide, glazed over. Steve lined himself up and pushed forward. They both groaned, Tony shutting his eyes, a rogue tear sliding down his cheek. Steve watched his sub intently, voice hushed, “color?”
A lot of snide smiles and more than several frowns watched him.
“Then you have to call me, Steve,” Steve said, before saying a little shyly, “I’ve actually liked Tony Stark for years… but… I never really thought I had the chance with him. I’m just a guy from lower Brooklyn. Not the dating type.”
Steve coughed, “yeah.”
“Are you waiting for someone? I saw you sitting by yourself with two cups-“
“Because people are always trying to get something out of Tony Stark,” Rhodey sighed, “even if it’s for his own good.”
“We have nowhere left to turn, my prince. We have no allies, all the houses are aligned against us,” the dark skinned Fae replied respectfully.
“The way the sub brutalized his dom, damn, your sub wasn’t throwing any punches.”
Steve kissed Tony, squeezing his shoulders, brushing against Tony’s nipples, his waist, and finally his hips, “tell me if it gets too much. Are you familiar with the stop light system?”
“This is not me choosing your future, this is me looking out for you,” Greg smiled, “meet up with her, bed her, you don’t have to marry the girl but you should at least stop being a virgin at 32.”
“I’m here, daddy,” Tony said quietly, “I want you. I want you to cum inside.”
“Does that mean I get the gig?” Tony asked, hopeful.
“-alive! Fucking heart rate is picking up-“
So when he got the job at coffee bean, he nearly sobbed out of joy. Finally, a job as a barista at a well known fast food chain! And who could say no to free coffee everyday?
“I-“ Tony rasped, tears rolling down his cheeks, “fuck.”
“Please, I need to know,” Steve’s voice was shaking, “how long does she have to live?”
“Hello!”
Tony was nervous.
“I know you,” Steve said, choosing his words carefully, “what are you doing here, creature of the light?”
“I’m heading out to the gym,” he yelled back, walking out of the house. Steve was angry, angry at Ransom, at the world for forcing the love of his life into such a situation. If Tony married him- if Tony gave him a chance, he wouldn’t force Tony to give up on his dreams- but Tony didn’t marry him. Tony didn’t even see him as a potential partner. Steve was angry, irrationally angry. So he pushed all his frustrations into working out at the gym.
“Tony didn’t tell you about his true worth, did he?” Natasha continued, “before he became Obadiah’s sub, he had a strong background in science and mechanical engineering. Obadiah, the fool, didn’t know Tony’s true worth. But the Mandarin does.”
“I have my spiders,” Nat answered obtusely. Steve couldn’t help feeling like this was the most that Natasha had ever spoken to him and if she wanted to keep her secrets, he’d allow her this.
“Why? Hasn’t the Stanes done enough? Everyone knows they sell their weapons under the table“ the blonde sub, Clint, said conversationally, “they never cared about who they hurt as long as they get to line their pockets-“
“Alright, baby, anything for you,” Steve kissed the top of his head.
The customer, Steve, smiled, and it lit up his whole face, “gosh, I never thought I’d see you again. How have you been?”
“Fuck no,” Clint said through spluttering laughter.
“-reward of $10,000 being set up by the Central Park Zoo for anyone who catches the elusive lion-“
“Yeah, I want you to take care of them while I’m gone,” Ransom said, “none of your playboy nonsense, Steve. If you have anyone over- and I mean anyone- if I hear from Tony that you are fucking random people at my house-“
“You… bulldozed half of the continent to get your best friend back,” Tony recited softly, hugging himself. He heard this tale from his father.
Tears clung to Steve’s lower lashes as he brought the despondent Tony into a hug.
Steve took the nearest stick like weapon and charged into battle-
“Very funny, Mr. Rogers. I’ll be seeing you,” the professor said, as he walked out of the hall.
“Steve…” Tony said quietly, savored the words rolling off his tongue, heart haywire.
Tony swallowed harshly but said nothing. The meaning was left heavy in the air.
Steve closed his eyes and sighed. He hated when Bucky was upset, but he’d do it all again if the circumstances were the same. He’d also knew that if Bucky was in the same situation, he’d do the same also… but he wasn’t, so-
“Why, I get-“ He tilted Tony’s face upwards, leaning down close enough to kiss, “a pretty sub.”
Tony grasped for words, “I- I’m not Iron man.”
“I’m glad you did,” Steve said.
“Rhodey, do not dare-“
“you… have conditions?” The golden haired man smiled in the dark, “I don’t think you understand the gravity of the situation.”
Tony couldn’t stop staring at him. He was blonde, from his head to the tips of his beard, golden lashes watching the cage in concern.
“I was always… selfish before I met your brother. I wanted to further my career rather than stay at home and start a family. Your brother-“ Tony fumbled with his T-shirt, “he taught me how wrong that thinking was. How omegas were made for a home life. For family. We’re not supposed to be getting frivolous things like careers.”
“Fuck off, punk,” Steve growled before catching Tony’s mouth in his own.
“Come on, son,” Tony intoned, “you don’t want to miss your big day do you?”
“Where are my prison clothes?” Tony asked softly.
Rogers stopped, whispering to himself, “you don’t even call me by my first name.”
“Only so much… I couldn’t… he doesn’t understand…”
“Sounds like Hydra,” Steve said with a frown, “and what did Clint claim? That I’m your only hope?”
“Cap-Steve,” Tony stumbled over his words, shaking like a leaf.
It was supposed to be a routine check up.
“Why is this such a big deal, Tony, you knew that Professor Stone was never going to pick you. The bastard always favors Alphas over Omegas,” Rhodey sighed at his best friend’s antics.
“Promise?” Tony asked, eyes wide with trust.
Tony snarled and fought against Hammer’s grip, but it did little to stop the dom, only egging him on.
“There’s only one…” Tony said, looking away, “Don’t pawn me off to someone else after I dropped.”
He just- he’d like to toy with me. Bring my hopes up, then dash them completely- he- he-”
“Bucky-“ Steve sighed.
“I’m brilliant,” Tony spat out like it was a curse, “in ways that my father or Greg never was. But…”
But if there was one thing that could pique Tony Stark’s interest, it was trouble.
“I want you. I want you,” Tony begged.
“I bear you no ill will, lord Rogers,” the Fae said, “I seek your help.”
Steve kneeled down to the child’s level, smiling wide and bright, “why yes.”
“Ok,” Steve hugged his mother, “we’ll get through this.
“Tony? Talk to me, what happened? Was a customer rude to you?”
Through the armour, Natasha also felt the Iron Man pause for a moment, "I don't know what you're talking about."
Toni casually handed the clerk her credit card, her eyes narrowed as if she was trying to read everything in his mind, "A date for coffee? Yeah, how about right now, go to Stark Tower, I promise there's no place in New York that has better coffee than my place."
After kissing her for a while, the man withdrew from her body and lazily squeezed all over her body. As she watched his hand wiggle twice and go back towards that little slit, the girl hugged his arm and pouted, "It hurts, it really hurts, look it's all swollen, let's not do it, okay, I'll make it up to you using somewhere else, I can use my mouth and suck it out for you, as many times as you want, okay?"
Tony put some more pressure on her and now Phanie collapsed on top of him, Tony stretched out his arms and wrapped her firmly in his arms, "I said call me Tony," and deliberately lowered his voice to her ear, "Will you marry me?"
The Stark's birthday party was always more of a big business dinner with a lot of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Steve was held tightly by Toni the whole time and he saw Natasha and Clint and was secretly glad that no one but Nick Fury knew who he really was.
And at 29, Steve's career is flourishing, still short of the opportunity to prove himself once and for all, but it's well on its way up. Thinking that Bucky is going to use this as an excuse to introduce him to another date, Steve explains repeatedly, "It's not that I've lost the ability to love since I broke up with Peggy, I just haven't fallen in love with another person yet." Seeing that Bucky didn't accept his argument, after wishing Wanda well, he quietly left the wedding venue.
The girl repeated "Steve" with affection, but never opened her eyes. The man thought she was going to say "Captain" and was slightly surprised, but seemed so taken with her voice that he didn't bother forcing her to open her eyes. "I like it when you call me by my first name, and you won't have to call me Captain anymore." Steve satisfied himself by running his eyes around her face twice and leaning down to bury his face in her long brown hair and sniff it before whispering in her ear, "I'll fuck you until you can't look at anyone else through me or think about anyone else anymore, and you'll only have me in your eyes and heart."
Natasha couldn't help but scream out at once, "Fuck you old capsicle, you couldn't turn me over when you stuck it in! I'm not a sex toy!"
So he left New York temporarily and came to Boston alone to live like a normal person. He grew his hair long, grew a beard and did his best to widen the gap between his appearance and the well-known image of Captain America. Pretending he was a street painter, a bachelor who barely broke even, a good neighbour who was happy to help others.
"Later Bucky questioned me with great regret, 'Why did you sneak out behind my back! Toni Stark! Just that Toni Stark who played the all-American dream girl at 18 was there, you could have definitely gotten a better audition from her if you had left ten minutes later! '" Mimicking Bucky's exaggerated tone, Steve, who later found out about it after being with Toni, said, "I really didn't know what I was missing at that point."
The prophecy came true.
"Yes, yes, so helpful and supportive Iron Woman, isn't it my turn to serve you now?" With some force, the girl was pushed down under him.
"Nat I can't..." Steve's clenched fist dropped to his side and the corners of his eyes seemed to have moistened a little, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, how could I..."
Natasha rounded the corner to hear these words. In the old days, Captain America had attracted many girls too, but Iron Woman had never worried about it. Because she knew that Steve cherished her and loved her, and at this point she was nothing more than a long-term bedmate for Captain Hydra, and the baby was nothing more than a tool he used to keep her confined to him, and might not be able to hold on to his remain responsibility. If one day he did get bored, he would only abandon her without hesitation. It was the fact that she could never refuse those eyes that had put her in this dilemma. If one day he were to abandon her for someone else, she wouldn't know how she would continue to face him after he returned to normal. Captain Hydra rarely spoke of his love to her, and the few times he did, it came out of his mouth in bed. At this point Steve's love for her was merely possessive, a master's love for his toy, but how much of it was true to his former self? She stood in the corner thinking that it would be better to take him home soon, and wishing that Bruce could work out a solution tomorrow.
Maybe it wasn't a one-night stand?
The man smiled, "No need, I've just finished a very long holiday and I'm leaving here tomorrow, so maybe I'll be living out of my home again for the rest of my life, so you don't have to think about paying it back."
The battle was as arduous as ever and it wasn't until late afternoon that the day's exertions were over for the avengers. Watching Iron Woman rampage as if she cares nothing about her own life, Steve felt a little more of a different emotion than his former fear for the lives of his teammates.
"Actually, we've broken up!" Steve blurted out, Tony froze and nodded, "Yes! They've broken up and we're the two true lovers!"
"Don't be in such a hurry to hang up, I think my discussion with Agent 7 has almost come to a conclusion." Another heavy thrust mixed with some inaudible pouting and low laughter, "You don't have to go out on tomorrow's mission, from now on you take over everything Agent 7 does." Steve hung up after dropping those two quick words.
She thought again of her intentions when Steve had asked her to marry him, to start preparing for a new life once they were registered and married, but now was definitely not a good time, and while she had vowed to bring Steve home, she was also prepared to meet him six feet under after pulling out the hydra if Steve didn't survive it. She couldn't have been prepared for that in this situation.
"You can ask Jarvis, my AI butler, any questions you have, just don't remind me it's all fake. See you tomorrow Mr. Evans," Toni waved this off and hurried off.
Natasha raised her leg and stomped on his chest, but Steve was unmoved, as if he would not stop until she said something.
He held the girl in his arms and then heard her low voice, "Want to do it?"
Before Clint could question the two men, they disappeared in front of him, leaving him with the snack scattered all over the floor.
The girl sighed inwardly, she was afraid that Steve would feel too guilty remembering the time he had been brainwashed, so she had begged Bruce to hide that memory for him, even though Bruce had warned her that hiding memories were different from Hydra's brainwashing techniques, and in order not to hurt the captain, the effect would only be greatly reduced, not necessarily when he would remember, only Natasha hadn't thought that her hard work wouldn't last a day against Captain America's quadruple recovery power.
There was only one final question, "Will you patronize again?" The two tacitly left this blank together.
"I know I have to listen to the little bastard the other way around. Haven't you been slacking off a bit on Pepper's back today?"
"Scott. As you wish. I'm fine with you even you want to tear the roof off the building."
And Bruce.
She walked on in a daze, not paying attention and bumping into someone.
Having just cleared out the remnants of Hydra, Natasha Stark, Iron Woman, stowed her nano-armour in the reactor on her chest and set out to find her fiancé, ready to tell him that today she had not been reckless at all, but had struck out exactly as Captain America had planned. Perhaps after asking him for a kiss, she could immediately fly back to the building with Steve for a hot post-battle sex.
Captain America answered her with action.
The day he went for the serum injection, a patch of skin on his wrist started to glow and Howard later told him that it was a sign that his soul mate's name had appeared. The name hadn't quite appeared yet and he just held his wrist and watched as Howard said to Peggy, "Peg, look at him, the serum injection will indicate his soul mate, maybe him becoming a super soldier is a sign of leaving you."
The strings that had been taut for four years broke instantly, "You can't ...... I can't ...... I can't live without you, and neither can Morgan." Steve held his love's cheek in trembling hands.
He wrapped his arms around the girl and kissed the top of her hair, "How about I make you dinner, a BBQ on the beach?"
Steve slowly approached the fallen armour in a defensive stance with his shield raised, Natasha mused that she hadn't been able to beat Steve in her previous combat training and simply withdrew the armour from her head, "Steve, it's me."
As expected Steve gave that "Toni no" look, "No, Pepper has repeatedly told you that your heart can't afford that and you can't ride the roller coaster."
Steve had heard Pepper say that Toni had a heart surgery before, so he would make sure she didn't drink too much coffee or stay up too late. And late at night, when she was haunted by nightmares, she would dial Steve's phone. He would listen to her nightmares and anxieties on the other end of the line until she finally fell asleep to the sound of his song. On her evenings off, Steve would take her through the streets in search of the delicious snacks that only the locals knew. Toni, on the other hand, recommended Steve to a director who coordinated with her in his new series of films before Steve knew it.
Steve, who had already given twice, was no longer obsessed with the speed of his thrusts, but took his time with each thrust to feel the girl's body's passionate welcome towards him. He admired the girl's lustful expression in the mirror and, still not satisfied, inserted two fingers of his right hand into her mouth, pushing himself deeper and deeper with each thrust, uttering a meaningless whisper like "fuck" with satisfaction.
"It's far, eighty bucks can be a lot worse. I'm going to New York."
"So, Captain America's not having an easy day either huh?"
One day, Phanie finished washing her clothes and practised her sword in the backyard. Although her memory was gone, her body instincts did not disappear so easily.  She had a keen sense of someone peeping from the shadows, and with a turn, the tip of her sword stopped in front of the man's neck, "Who are you? Why are you sneaking around the Prince's residence in the middle of the night?"
"Can't understand how the old guy can have the energy to face a long day after the run."
Grant's voice seemed magical and she didn't really seem to be in such a hurry to get back to New York to upgrade her armour. Natasha had grown up working with machinery and had no knowledge of art, except for people who wanted to get investment from her and talked about how masterful their work was. This was the first time she had become interested in art.
It was the old capsicle that bothered the team today.Natasha muttered to herself as she summoned Jarvis to locate the captain.
"But you said your name was Toni."
"My last name isn't Evans, my full name is Steve Rogers."
Toni shook her head but replied something else, "It would have been better if it had been winter, that might have been a good way to end this, it can be a way we get our hair white together."
Toni's breath sounds tickled his ears and neck, "Now you know it's not. Want to do it?"
"Can you take me on the Ferris wheel? At least you can see the view from up high, just spare me as an old man who's afraid to ride roller coasters, okay?" Steve immediately changed his expression like an innocent puppy, which defeated Toni, but bargained as if she was losing out, "I'll reluctantly agree with that, but I'll have a cone, no, two of them."
After the weekend was over, the kids were sent to elementary school. Without the children to buffer, Steve found the next couple of weekdays to be super awkward. He was a freelance artist who spent most of the time working at home, doing digital work and Tony was a stay at home omega, so they crossed paths more than once.
“What? I-“ Steve spluttered.
echoed in his sensitive ears.
Their tongues played lazily, Steve whispering against Tony’s lips, “I’m going to insert another finger.”
“Steve Rogers rings any bells? Captain America?” Greg’s smile curved down, “I don’t want you to have anything to do with him.”
“Oh god, that’s rough,” Bucky shook his head, smile intact, “I don’t envy you.”
Steve stopped, whispering against Tony’s lips, “do you trust me?”
He was happy.
The dom wiped his face, “out.”
“Let’s go out and let the Captain dress in peace,” Reed said responsibly.
Tony’s heart dropped. Intel. Steve Roger wanted intel on Greg. Greg was right.
“Please,” Tony said quietly, defeatedly, “be good to me.”
“Mr. Rogers.” The portly man asked, “it is a pleasure to meet you.”
“Stop,” Tony screeched. Tony was crying now, tears streaming down his hard doe eyes.
“I’ll take things from here,” a soft voice with a Brooklyn lilt said.
But Steve couldn’t.
Tony wanted to say Steve was wrong. How could Steve say that when his own father couldn’t see the potential in him?
“Bucky? You came back so early,” Steve left the couch, television still running.
“How would you like me?” Tony repeated, not even hearing the question.
“And Obadiah was in his 30s. He… was kind before our marriage. He would give me gifts. Spoil me in all the finest gifts he thought a sub would want. I didn’t want any of it, but my future was sealed. I had no choice,” Tony said quietly, “after I graduated from highschool, we wed immediately. He- sex- it was always painful. He didn’t care if I was interested or not. He just got what he wanted, whether it meant punishing me for small slights, chaining me up to the bed posts for days, naked, blindfolded, and crying. He didn’t care.”
“Please, daddy, please,” Tony whined.
Sexy times 🥴
“Tony, James, you got your ten,” Sharon said. She was extremely strict that they didn’t work during their breaks or before their work time began.
It was a normal day in NYC.
“Greg set me up,” Tony sighed.
Tony nodded slowly, eyes glazed over. He didn’t look quite there.
Tony never regretted adopting Peter but his father’s words were a weight he’d rather not carry.
“Hey buddy, the park is closing,” Tony yelled as he and Peter walked up to the man.
That night, while Rogers was brushing his teeth, Tony reached inwardly for the courage to ask, “why are you doing this?”
“Oh, Steve! You there? Can you help me with something?” Tony asked joyfully.
“I’m not here for your games, Rogers-“
Tony wasn’t listening anymore, his whole world was crashing down on him. He had escaped one prison for another.
“S-sure,” Tony said, hoping he wasn’t flushing up a storm.
Steve didn’t know what to say. To be fair, he was shocked. But if this was better to spend time with the love of his life? Which reminded him, he turned to Tony, “you forgot your danish.”
“No! You fucking kidding me? He’s like a little brother to me,” Rhodey explained.
He stared up at Steve like he held the world in his hands. He was beautiful, adorned in dark expensive clothes. He had jokingly said he’d come with a white dress, fuck the gender norms, but Steve quickly pushed away that idea with a kiss.
“Why?” Tony asked timidly, wide brown eyes looking into cool blue.
“Spot any cute omegas, Stevie?” Bucky asked, waggling his eyebrows at a cute omega girl and guy sitting at a table. They giggled at his antics.
Tony’s mood soured. He turned and kissed his husband, a frantic, sinful kiss, full of wild fervor. At the end of it, he closed his eyes to hide the tears, whispering against his husband’s lips, “come back to me.”
After hours of waiting, after the prison guards changed shifts several times, Rogers went back into the cell and sighed, turning on the water to wash his face.
“Hammer broke a cardinal rule,” Rogers said calmly, before meeting Tony’s eyes directly, “No one touches one of mine, for that, he will be punished.”
Tony gave Steve one quick nod before turning.
“What’s wrong with my outfit?” Steve frowned. As much as he wanted to get out of the wet gear he was found in, it was also one of the remaining familiar things in his possession. He felt oddly protective of it.
“Tony!”
The young boy pulled the blanket higher over his face, “dun wanna.”
“I know who you are,” Tony chewed out, cursing his brother for putting him in this situation, “I should go-“
“No,” Rogers said softly, “I like hearing you talk.”
Tony turned off the radio.
“Call me when you find anything out about Ransom,” Tony said quietly, not even looking in Steve’s direction.
At the end of the week, things changed.
“Tony,” Romanov said in a tone used to calm the frightened animals, “can you please tell us what happened to you.”
“Nothing,” Bucky quipped.
Rogers looked down at Tony, “I always wanted an excuse to punish that bastard.”
“Language,” Steve and Morgan said at the same time.
The whole field went quiet as the other people stared, many doms trembling in fear.
Tony lowered his head in shame.
“I can see that pretty head of yours ticking,” Rogers said, “what are you thinking, Tony?”
“I’ll do my best,” Steve smiled back.
Iron man was quiet for this rant, stoic. Steve glanced over at the man in metal armor, “then how do you know so much about me?”
“I do,” Tony gasped, wrapping his arms around Steve’s bare shoulders and dragging Steve back into a harsh kiss.
“You didn’t actually punch back when you had the right to. I attacked you and your friend first and you didn’t fight me. You let me hit you. Either you are the stupidest alpha in existence- which I highly doubt, or you have strong morals. I respect that,” Rhodey said. He didn’t mention that he was kind of desperate as well to get Tony into a good relationship that could get him out of the contract with Obi. He didn’t think any Alpha would be ready for that kind of commitment before he actually fell in love with Tony. Besides, if this alpha was not what Rhodey thought of him as, he could always kick him to the curb.
Then Sharon appeared in the room, “You guys are off for- What’s happening?”
“No, I’m alright,” Tony said softly, even though his coat was soaked through with ocean water. He looked about the room, eyes wide as he took in the sight of white roses- his mother’s favorite flower- scattered about. It seemed like there was some kind of ceremony going on at the moment, “sorry if I’m intruding on anything.”
“Come up on stage,” a professor said.
“Um… thanks… what’s going on here?” Bruce asked.
Howard slammed a fist into Tony’s face. He fell to the floor like a sack of potatoes. To stop himself from sobbing, Tony bit his tongue so hard he could taste blood.
“I’m sorry- I promised Ransom that I’d watch over you, if you want me gone-“ Steve blundered until Tony held out a hand.
“My poor boy,” Obadiah’s voice was full of false pity.
As Steve neared the Robot, the Robot tore off it’s own face plate revealing a sweating, panting pale faced man underneath. The man had startling brown eyes that stared up at Steve with an emotion akin to fear. He tried to sit up and failed, “you- you have to get out of here! Any minute and the chatari- the aliens- you have to warn-“
“You here with me, baby?”
Steve ignored his friend, “what do I have to do, Mr- Rhodey.”
“Ty! Hurry it up!” Someone yelled from outside the room and Tony let out a sigh of relief until the blonde guard squeezed his ass and whispered in his ear, “I’ll visit you, sub bitch.”
“I think I’m going to catch some z’s,” Tony exaggerated a yawn, “good night, Steve.”
“Why?” Tony asked curiously.
Tony pulled his chin out of the man’s grip. The man chuckled at Tony’s small act of defiance, “it’s your choice, Mr. Stane.”
The arms unraveled from around them as Tony quickly tumbled out of the bed to the floor, grasping at his chest.
“Aw, darling,” Steve drawled in thick Brooklyn, reaching out to wipe the tears from Tony’s eyes, “it couldn’t be your fault. You shouldn’t be carrying this weight. You’re just an ordinary civilian.”
Tony turned back and sighed, “Steve-“
Steve swallowed. So this was the end.
“Who is this? How did you get this number?”
“I love it, Steve, thank you,” Tony said. He turned to hug Steve. Steve felt almost complete with Tony in his arms.
Steve would just call him and talk about anything and everything. The changes Steve observed about the world when he drove across America, the cuisine, the cultures that surrounded him, and Tony would listen. Sometimes he’d add in his two cents when Steve asked a question about how something worked, but most of the time, he’d just listen.
“Steve! What are you doing?! You’re not going to make it!” Peggy’s voice was but a whisper that Steve had to decipher in the roar of the beeping signals and racing wind.
“What?” Rogers asked, eyes wide.
“The doctors found something… some lumps,” Sarah looked up at Steve with a small shaky smile, “but they say it’s stage 2. Not a big deal. The doctors are going to do some additional tests but they say not to worry too much.”
He didn’t think so when he went for the showers.
He watched Tony walk down the stairs. He couldn’t help wondering how much more Tony would shine if he was allowed to. If he wasn’t under Ransom’s shadow. Steve shook his head, it wasn’t for him to decide. Tony could take care of himself. He didn’t need Steve. He chose Ransom. Steve needed to remember that.
me! Live a little!” Bucky snapped.
“Please, please, please,” Tony begged.
Iron man looked distinctly uncomfortable at that, a little observation that Steve filed away for later perusal.
“Steve… Steve Rogers,” Steve said.
Tony frooze for a second. Thank god for the red light.
Steve dodged quickly, “I still think you should get one. Just to be on the safe side.”
“Who was that?” Steve asked after the third drink. He barely felt it but Greg looked like he was drunk from just the sip.
“What about you! Are you Iron man?”
“Those rules don’t apply to me,” Rogers said with a sigh.
“It’s been three months already…” Tony said softly, lower lip trembling, “he’s not back.”
“Steve,” Bucky said, sounding remorseful.
“Y-yeah,” Steve sighed, “what are you watching?”
“I understand,” the man said, bored, “I’ll let Maria know. You’ll be given to a dom who’ll force his will on you.”
“Maybe…” Tony began, “there is someone.”
“-not leave to Valhalla just yet. We require you on this mortal plane.”
Tony laughed and it was ugly with misery, “what about me?”
Tony went to the interview in a shirt and slacks. It was the nicest thing he owned after his dad kicked him out of the house and out of the will. It was the only thing he always wore at interviews. He put on a charming facade, hoping that this time, a manager would hire him.
As he got ready for his first day, he had to dig into his clothes pile to find a suitable shirt and pants to go to work.
When Tony spewed a bunch of engineering jargon, Clint raised his hands up, “forget I asked.”
“But I’m stupid, I’m naive,” Tony snapped, “everyone I’ve ever trusted betrayed me- I- I can’t trust myself. Greg is there for me. I don’t need anyone else.”
“I will,” Steve promised.
“Nothing, nothing, Greg,” Tony said, standing in front of the closet protectively.
“Tony- oh god, Tony, no, it’s not like that,” Steve backpedaled.
“Take a good look at your sub, Steve,” Natasha said.
“Oh god, I- fuck, way to kick a guy while he’s down, Buck,” Bucky sighed to himself, “I’m sorry can I try again?”
He didn’t remember much about his childhood other than the abstract feeling of neglect, but he remembered the day his father found he was an o. He was immediately sent to boarding school right after, as if the Stark elder was ashamed of keeping his omega child, his heir, in his own house.
“Don’t worry about it, Maria.”
“We should give him a change of clothes. We can’t let him walk outside with a huge American star,” the robot- Iron man grouched, “Jan, can you get him something?”
The dom shoved Tony into Roger’s chest. Rogers caught him with a careful grace. The dom smelled like freshly grounded coffee and safety. Tony wrinkled his face. Why?
“Tony-“ Steve began but Tony cut him off, “we can’t meet anymore.”
Tony whipped his head to stare at Rogers. God, Rogers looked so young. They all did.
“I’m proud of you brother,” Ransom said, “take care of Tony and my kids.”
“I-“ Tony had to think about Peter’s safety first and foremost, but… damn his bleeding heart- “I have a guest house on my property. You are welcome to crash there till morning.”
There was a gorgeous young man standing in front of the lion cage.
Rhodey let his friend mourn his life not yet lived as they laid on the grass on campus.
“I didn’t want to do it!” Tony snarled, loud enough for the entire table to hear. All those nights, all those years begging Obi to stop, all the beatings he endured, the unjust punishments. The drop he was forced into to divulge his secure codes. His secrets. His dreams. His weaknesses. “I- I didn’t want-“
After kissing Rogers on his own accord, Tony expected things to change between them. Rogers proved him wrong time and time again. The dom seemed to like waiting, but if Tony tried to show any interest while they were wrapped in each other’s arms in bed, the dom would stop him.
After some time of spying, sleeping, and working, one night, while he was watching Tony’s house forlornly, having had a bit much to drink- surprisingly, Tony was the first to approach. Tony walked over in the dead of night, dressed in a light cardigan, pajama pants, and fluffy slippers, holding his head high. He looked radiant and Steve shied away when Tony spotted him.
“Come on, Tony,” Greg tutted in frustration, “you have to choose someone who can give you a family. Someone kind, honest, loyal-“
That just a week ago-
“Steve,” the stranger said.
At the name, all the color left Tony’s face. Sounds became a slight ringing in his ear and he sat, mutely, in his seat.
Rogers looked down at him with a vicious kissed bitten smile. Tony felt powerful in Roger’s arms. Powerful in a way he never felt before.
He tossed and turned, unable to get a good night's rest. He never was, not after Pepper passed. But tonight was especially harrowing, with the constant howling of wolves outside his window.
“You have super powers?”
Tony didn’t believe in fate. He didn’t believe in a deity. He believed in the real, in the solid, in science.
“More, daddy, I need your to-“ Tony whined but Steve was one step ahead. He took Tony’s cock in his hand, and began rubbing it, squeezing, and playing with the weeping head, urging it to completion. Tony cried out as he came. Steve came not a moment later, inside his lover. He bit down at the long column of Tony’s beautiful neck, rubbing and nuzzling the mark.
“Good, I’ll meet you then.”
“Yeah… I can’t really talk about it to anyone…” Rogers smiled ruefully.
“Fuck you, Greg,” Tony snarled. It was half hearted and they both knew it. Greg did everything he could for Tony but he still couldn’t help resent his brother.
“A dom tried to have a go at him,” the quiet dom said, “this will only be the first. I’m sure Hammer wanted to test the waters.”
“The guy, he looked just like you,” Steve said.
Tony was getting ready for work when he heard a knock on the door.
“I-“ Tony’s mind went blank. That was true.
“You can come home with us!” Peter piped up.
“What?” Tony asked, outraged, “what about me?”
“Reed,” Iron man sighed, “if you would.”
“I think that’s enough, Clint,” Rogers grouched, sending Tony several worried glances which Tony ignored. This was all becoming too much for Tony, but he couldn’t leave before his dom was done with his food or he’ll face the consequences.
Tony gasped softly at the vulnerability in Steve’s voice.
But under that nervousness, Tony was rippling with excitement. From his brief conversation with Steve, he felt this connection. This universal click that he had felt with no other person. He had felt… complete. Like this was meant to be. Like this was fate.
Steve stiffened, “what?”
“What?” Steve asked.
Immediately, Steve internally celebrated, then quickly squashed the thought. How could he dare celebrate his brother not coming back from war? What kind of sick fuck was he?
“Thanks, Steve, truely,” Tony said, “this made my day. No, my week. Thank you.”
She left for the restroom.
He was late. And when he was late-
Steve poked the man on his fleshy cheek to see if he would wake, which unfortunately, he did not. Steve waited, scanning the area for any signs of threat. That’s what the man said there would be after all and Steve would prefer his hands to be free to defend the man if need be. After a moment of utter silence besides the occasional sound of woodland creatures, Steve turned back to the man, saying gruffly, “I guess you were wrong.”
“Age,” the man asked.
“What are you doing here?” Rogers asked, taking the seat opposite him.
Tony just looked up at Rogers with a blank expression of acceptance.
“I know this might all come as a shock,“ a man in full red gear said, “it certainly isn’t easy-“
“I’m getting deployed.”
“I won’t be repeating myself. Leave,” Tony’s AI said coldly.
Rogers dragged Hammer by the collar to the middle of the square, saying quite calmly, “everyone listen up.”
“Anything for me,” Tony smiled softly, closing his eyes as Steve continued at a slower pace, fighting the urge to claim his lover. Tonight wasn’t about what Steve needed. That’s not what Tony needed. Tony needed him to show his love. And damn everything, Steve was going to give it to him.
Tony’s eyes widened, “yeah! It’s just- it’s not for me. Ransom helped me see that.
He shivered, waiting for the final blow, when the alien let out a disgruntled screech and he was roughly pushed to his feet, “Greg, are you alright? Where’s your suit?”
Tony didn’t know why he felt so drawn to this man. He looked at Steve, eyes half closed, “I-“
“Sir, she’s gone.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” were his lawyer's last words to him.
“I hate to say it but, without Howard Stark, the Avengers probably would never have been formed,” the man in purple- Clint Barton grouched.
“What man-“ Tony asked before seeing the same handsome man as before.
“I’ll get a blueberry muffin,” Natasha said.
Steve leaned forward and kissed him fiercely, “I’ll never let anything happen to you.”
“Woah, woah, woah, where are you going, Stevie?” Bucky asked.
“I don’t believe that,” the chatty blonde sub said, “they say the Stanes had a happy marriage. Everyone knows that.”
“Yeah,” Tony swallowed, “that’s me.”
“Not everyone has the billion dollar parents to cover all their college bills,” Bucky quipped.
“I know,” Steve said.
“When I was young… I had a best friend. He was also kidnapped… by hydra,” Steve said, brows furling with the memory.
“Four years,” Obi said before he turned and left the room.
“Oh he’s fiery. I bet he’s a real treat in bed,” the dom leered, “I’m sure Rogers wouldn’t mind if I had a go at him.”
Tony’s mind hit a blank; he lowered his head, “I can’t think of any.”
“After Stane’s death, the mandarin took the opportunity to corner the weapons market. He bought out the crashing and burning Stark Industries and took over the weapon’s game. All in a matter of months,” Natasha said.
Steve waved as Tony drove away to the dealership, where he spent several grueling hours working behind cars and out of sight. During the breaks he took, he was too tired to contemplate even calling his son to check up on him.
“No,” Fury answered her, “Sergeant Barnes seems just as confused as we are, but…”
“Hang in there, shellhead. We’ll get you to a hospital.”
“Genetics,” Greg smiled a secret winning smile, making Steve flush, “he’s my twin.”
“Yeah, sure,” Steve said dumbly, still looking at Tony rather than typing up the order. He didn’t even notice Bucky chuckling into his hand.
“What about Nat?” Steve asked.
Tony chewed his lower lip, “green.”
“Huh,” Steve said quietly, smiling back. He walked towards the bed, “are you sure?”
Steve sat beside his once best friend. The friend he’d tell everything to. All his secrets. He reached out to touch Bucky’s hand, “Buck-“
He set it on the kitchen table wrapped in gaudy wrapping paper after the kids had gone to school. When Tony walked into the room, his eyes widened at the present, “what is that?”
Tony flushed crimson and the group continued their bantering.
“Fuck you!” Tony snarled.
“Uh, let me show you around,” Bucky said.
“Don’t open the door to strangers, don’t leave the house, don’t eat too many sweets,” Peter said all in one breathe.
“Good night,” Steve said with a small sad smile.
When the bell rang for them to start their day, Tony jumped out of the dom’s reach like a skittish animal. The dom just looked at him with a handsome rugged, sleep deprived face, yawning, “morning.”
“A present for you,” Steve said, “a thank you for letting me crash in your home for three months.”
“You sure you can sneak it under Anthony Stark’s voluminous nose?” Clint asked.
“Shhh, it’s ok,
“What took you so long,” Clint grouched.
There was an uncomfortable silence between them as Bucky continued to watch whatever it was on screen.
It was pathetic how much he loved Tony Stark, but he couldn’t help it. Once Ransom introduced his boyfriend to Steve, he fell hard for the doe eyed, fiery omega.
“As long as what’s not Natasha?” Nat asked.
“What do you mean? It’s not the weekend, we don’t go outside unless it’s the weekend,” Tony said softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I didn’t mean it like that and you know it!” Iron man snapped.
“Bucky, it’s not like that-“ Steve sighed.
“What- what do you mean?” Tony asked, bewildered.
“Stark? As in Stark Industries, Stark?” Steve said, brows raised.
“Yeah, Saturday,” Tony answered mindlessly.
“Iron man works for Anthony Stark, as a bodyguard,” Reed explains.
And Tony knew it too.
“I’d advise you to leave the premises immediately, Ms. Romanoff.”
Steve joined him, kissing him softly, languidly, letting him control the pace. Yes. Tony could get used to this.
But Tony didn’t.
. It’s alright,” Sarah cooed, “we’ll get through this. We’ll get through this.”
“Bucky,” Steve said in his disappointed voice.
Greg stepped towards the front door and sighed, “Tony… when did you start keeping secrets from me. I’d never use your work against you. You know this.”
“I know enough,” Steve said.
Peter let out a pitiful cough that Tony saw through immediately, but… “aright. Since it’s your birthday, I’ll let you stay at home. But you better be ready to go to school tomorrow,” he said, kissing the top of Peter’s head.
Steve had never seen anything like it.
“J,” Tony gasped, holding his false heart.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, I’ll take care of Hulk. Clint, Nat watch over Tony.”
“The market,” Steve answered, “you should go out and see it, you won’t believe-“
Tony nearly dropped his phone again, “what?”
Tony stayed in their cell, hiding behind the beds and curled in on himself. He wasn’t always this skittish. He used to be loud-mouthed and brash, a sub the media dubbed the ‘wild child.’ Obi put an end to all of that. He put an end to a lot of things.
“I will, I’m the best uncle you’ll ever see!” Steve puffed up his chest.
“-owns the company. And probably the zoo too. That’s why we got in for free. Daddy owns a lot of things.”
“Twen-twenty five.”
There was too many people in the way, Steve had to fight to get through.
Another guard, someone who didn’t even look at him
“Hmm,” the other dom, a man with scraggly dark long hair, said. This dom was the first to look directly at him today. It was nerve wracking.
Natasha grimaced as she listened to the tone of the woman on the other end of the line. And Steve had no intention of answering, but instead landed a slap on the girl's hip. Natasha froze, not really expecting such an idea from him. The pinch was very satisfying for Steve and he let out a long, sultry moan.
Tony sat up at once, "How do you know that?"
The first man she saw when she woke up asked her kindly what her name was and where she was going and how she had been injured so much, only to find that she could not remember the answers to any of these questions.
"Fuck you old capsicle, if you dare to say a word about leaving me! Do you not want me anymore!" Natasha finally stifled her tears, "You big fool, I just begged Bruce not to let you remember that because I was afraid, I know you'd feel guilty and sad and think about leaving. Look at me!" She reached up to wipe the tears from the corner of Steve's eyes and forced him to look straight at herself, "You never hurt me, I love you Steve, you came back, I did, I brought you home, nothing could be more important than that, and if there's any compensation, it's that you never leave me again."
It was as if a million threads of fate had tied Tony to those infinity stones, and for four years every attempt he had made had ended with that snap, waking up with no part of his body hurt, but no part of his body not aching.
Natasha Stark was not a little girl to be protected, she was Iron Woman alongside Captain America. He was also bound to do more than pampering her, but to live and die with her. They would rely on each other, understand each other, and grow old together, Steve thought aimlessly as he held Natasha in his arms as she drifted off to sleep.
Steve seemed to have a much deeper look in his eyes again, "Almost recovered?" "Pretty much, I'm fine, just a little sore now and then." At this, the man finally smiled for the first time in those days, "Finally, I think it's time you had the energy to do something else."
As she watched the last train back to New York leave, Natasha muttered a series of No's followed by a few unintelligible curses. She walked back the way she had come, distracted by Pepper's voice in her head, reminding her of how the CEO of SI had ended up in this situation.
"If we're at home, I'd like to change that painting in the hall."
Steve gradually loosened the restrictions on Natasha's movements, though fearing she would overwork herself, the girl was only allowed to work half a day, and the rest of the time she was basically either Steve out with her for a walk or she was wandering around the base by herself.
Three days later.
The schedule for the film was generous and one of the main reasons Toni chose the film was because of the relaxing working hours. Four years ago long periods of drinking and sleepless nights had kept her heart a little overloaded and she had to have an operation and go through a long period of recuperation. After agreeing with Pepper, they chose this relaxing romantic comedy as a small transition before her official career comeback.
The woman on the other end of the line seemed to have a lot of questions, her voice hesitating for a moment before she asked again, "Captain?"
"Long day huh?"
"Nat! Don't change the subject!" Captain America was flattered, but didn't want to let the girl's temptation stop him from pursuing the truth.
Grant moved for a moment to regain his senses and then pushed her away slightly, "Can I ask you the name of your soul mate?"
Clint sneaks out in the middle of the night in search of a midnight snack, and by the faint light of the fridge, it's a shock.
Well here's a hint from the plot I should know who you are. "Miss Stark. yes, no one in New York doesn't know you. It would be an honor to get an autograph request from Miss Stark."
"What are you doing here?" Natasha's dazed look annoyed him a little. "I was just passing by..." Natasha rarely whispered so softly and it tickled the man's heart as he grabbed the girl's hand, "Let's go back."
Steve reached for the crystal ball the Wong had left on his desk and the gruesome scene of the battle came to him, he saw him fighting Thanos with Tony and Thor, saw himself picking up Thor's hammer, saw Danvers thrown out by the power of the stone, saw ......Tony snapped then his reactor went off.
Even though he hadn't thought about this whole thing about the two of them, Tony wasn't going to reject him outright at this time when he was showing his vulnerability, "You know I can't look you in the eye and say no, but I haven't decided to say yes either, just give me a little more time."
"My friend Bruce says captain and Iron man have broken up and moved on to Tony Stark. Are you aware of this, Ironman, and why is Captain America in two relationships?"
"How could I?" Captain America hadn't really expected to hear that answer, he had actually knocked up the girl he loved before getting married, well at their usual frequency that wasn't really that unbelievable. But he couldn't believe that Natasha had carried their child for so long that he hadn't made the girl his lawfully wedded wife like a scumbag who had abandoned his wife.
Natasha didn't think so. Having just dumped a bed partner for a plane ride, she didn't believe she could have a soul mate, she thought she had made enough bad decisions to not have the name. Secondly, she couldn't understand how this seemingly ordinary trip could be the pivotal event that would affect her life.
Toni was breathing too hard to keep up with him, so she moved her lips to the back of his neck and hugged him tightly. And Steve secretly found that even without this damned piece of the deal, he didn't want to turn her down at all. "When you said coffee, I was wondering if I'd really come for coffee." He hugged her back tightly, praying that he could give her a little more security and the feeling of being loved that she wanted.
Day 4
Toni gave up all at once, rolled off her legal husband and stomped him, "Go put your son to bed!
Steve said it lightly, but Toni could hear his sadness and was trying to think of a way to revive the mood, "I'm only five years younger than you ......" only to be interrupted by Steve's voice, "Look, we're at the top."
"I remember. It's a deal." Natasha said and went back to her room without waiting for a response from the team.
The call was answered, "It's Captain, have you come around and now want to give me a lecture on the assignment schedule?"
"That's easy, I'll just find a random prestigious family and ask them to adopt you as their daughter, there are plenty of people willing to be the future queen's parents."
Steve got up, his blue eyes full of dismay, "How did you ......"
"Yes?" not sure if it was an illusion, Steve thought he heard detachment in the AI's voice, "Captain Rogers?"
Natasha was dazed and confused as Steve held her, thinking that it was finally over, when she regained consciousness she realised that she had been placed in a kneeling position in front of the bathroom mirror. The man came on top of her from behind, cupping her chin as he did so, "Look in the mirror, baby." On one side he gave her a couple of sloppy touches before thrusting in again.
"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe Captain America isn't as bright and honest as everyone sees him?"
She really wanted to be back in New York right now, in her lab, or at least anywhere that had Jarvis. There were at least ten new ideas screaming in her head right now that she wanted to experiment quickly. But now she'd missed this last train of the day and still didn't want to call Pepper.
Steve rolled the girl onto her back and dropped delicate kisses on her lips and cheeks. There was still something missing. The man mused and carried her back to the bed, sitting himself on the edge of the bed while having the girl kneel in front of him, facing the big guy who had somehow gotten hard again.
"Friday said you woke up with a nightmare this morning?" Tony asked as he handed the milk to Steve who had returned from his morning run. Ever since he had Morgan, Tony had given up that round-the-clock routine and would even get up on time in the morning.
I don't want to lie to her, Natasha said to herself in her mind. But she won't understand me. Only by devoting all her time to something more meaningful, whether it was perfecting her armour, dealing with emergencies, or surrounding herself with people to get more opportunities to help more people, would she feel that she wasn't wasting her life.
Steve pushed down the unease mind and took a deep breath, "Can you not tell Toni about this yet? I'll talk to her about it after this is over. You wouldn't want her to miss anything, would you?"
The moans and sobs, and the sound of his palms on the girl's body, drifted out of the window, asserting her ownership for him.
Steve took her left nipple and sucked it hard, while cupping his hands around her right breast and rubbing it hard, and Natasha heard the man on her chest whispering something indistinctly in between the sucking and nibbling.
I'm really in love with you. "But you're hurt,"
It was Phanie who spoke first, "Your Highness ......, I really don't understand why you would hide your identity from me and ...... "treat me so well that I would think that way?
Since he had woken up in a time that was not his, he had rarely felt truly alive until the night he met her in Boston, after his heart had beaten for her briefly and passionately, when he had frozen his heart once again. And at that moment his heart found a new impetus, and he thought he would never forget those beautiful  eyes. "Toni......," he murmured as his fingers rubbed the picture on the file like he was gently stroking his lover's hair.
Although Toni was the one who didn't want to come in the first place, it was Toni who had the fun later, dragging Steve over and over again on the roller coaster. It wasn't until later that the super soldier was a little confused, "Don't you fly in the sky every day? Why would you like to ride a roller coaster so many times, it must not be as exciting as your life as the Iron Woman."
Natasha thought wistfully about the power of brainwashing, to not only turn Captain America into Captain Hydra, but also to make her fiancé, who at first blushed at the kiss, do such things so boldly, while holding Steve's head, but not pushing him away.
Peter, who had seen the scene through the glass door, sprang to his feet in shock, Captain America's return kiss aborted, and the CEO of Stark Industries, the Tower's owner, woke up.
It was Phanie's voice, and she and Pepper were the only ones in the whole house who dared to talk to him like that. The man under the covers squirmed twice and fell back to sleep again.
Steve wondered how he managed to remember that time again in this climax moment, and how much he had to talk to dispel the girl's insecurities. Oh yes, it was his love his feelings, he thought with a little distraction from the unspeakable relief, the same love he had then when he saw the girl's eyes redden at the moment as she buried her head between his legs and choked.
The girl blinked and reached down to open herself up, "Little slut's hole wants daddy's big cock, daddy, come on and love me."
It was another battle. The adrenaline rush is most intense on a smoky battlefield.
Perhaps his fighting on the battlefield could protect ordinary people like Toni from the cruelty he faced, Steve thought as he watched her back from the station door.
He learned that the most prominent building in New York was the Stark Tower, owned by Howard's daughter Natasha Stark, the unearthly genius who had appeared only as Iron Women these years. He looked at the pictures of the gold and red armour on the news, remembering his time with Bucky, with Peggy, with Howard, all those times he couldn't go back to, and closed his phone after a moment's wandering.
Toni stared at him and frowned, "What did I say the other day when I was drunk? You don't have to go through the motions with me, it's over."
Until Toni got up and sat in the dining room to enjoy the breakfast service brought to her mouth, she still looked puffed up from the wake-up call, either saying the omelette was salty or not wanting to drink the milk. She leaned back calmly and sipped her coffee, watching Steve go about washing the dishes and clearing the table, finally feeling refreshed, "What time did you get up?"
Maybe he could make an exception for the night and cum on her chest, Steve thought as he pulled himself away from her by the hair on the back of her head, before Natasha was once again lowered to the floor with her back to Steve behind her. "So wet after only a few licks," the man whispered in her ear, patting her ass again nastily, satisfied with the temptation of that pussy opening contracting sharply before pushing his desire slowly and firmly into her tight, wet deepest part, "How is it that I've fucked you so many times and you're still so tight?"
Natasha said to herself that she could have handled those without him, but shrugged and said thank you anyway.
Not many days later he met the man again actually confessing his love for Natasha, and his girl just laughed and shook her head, "I think you've got the wrong idea, I really just admire your talent." The man refused to stop there, "Toni, you're just saying that because you're afraid of the captain, aren't you? He's... How could he do that to you, I heard him. You're not going to fall in love with him, are you?"
Natasha felt that today Steve seemed a bit of a maniac, sucking on her tongue as if he wanted to swallow her whole. Before she knew why, her wrists felt cold and she was handcuffed to the bed in a sideways position.
The night before he was picked up by Agent Romanoff and taken back to New York, he almost thought he'd met the one. The girl's beautiful eyes had almost given him the rare thought of being capricious for once. But he couldn't. If he were really just an ordinary man, he would have given up clinging to that name once again and believed that the person in front of him was the love he longed to pursue that had nothing to do with a soul mate. But he couldn't. He was a warrior who would return to battle tomorrow and should not and could not bring an ordinary man into his uprooted life.
"Don't tell me you don't know who I am."
"Yeah, but the old man at least has quadruple physical strength, Iron Man is the one who's had a really hard day. Want to get down and I'll give you a massage?"
Steve pushed so hard that he didn't notice and slammed the girl's head into the head of the bed. "Ow!" The knock caused Natasha's whole body to contract, surprisingly pinning Steve to cum.
"Only noon ......" It had been years since anyone had waited by her bedside to get up, Toni struggled to open one eye a crack before reaching out and pushing up the golden head, "If you don't have anything important I'll just sleep longer. "
Against Natasha's thoughts, the man in front of her spoke, "Excuse me, you should still want this, but I think it might be broken."
Steve rose slightly and stretched out his arm to reach for the glass of milk on the small table next to the bed, which had been prepared for the wounded girl in the bed, who did not like milk, so there was still most of it left, and Steve lifted his hand and poured it over Natasha's body.
Toni knew when a wink would make her look churlish, so she put on that innocent look that no one but Pepper could resist and whispered, "I'd like to see it."
Steve's breath caught and he couldn't hold back any longer, stabbing his long, thick cock into the deepest part, Natasha didn't adjust well and let out a steep pout. "It's only been three months since I've been in there and you're already so thirsty again? You're getting really good at bed screaming."
Back in Toni's office on the top floor, before he could enter, his quadruple hearing allowed him to faintly hear Toni arguing with someone, another voice whose owner seemed to be Miss Potts. ...... is just so pathetic... . to lie to myself about getting over ...... how to deal with ...... sooner or later it will ruin ......"
"No one gets used to the vitriol, Toni, I want to stand by your side, we'll beat the rumours and vilification with a stronger relationship, marry me, will you?"
The man turned his head and when he saw her, he came over quickly, "Miss Stark."
They landed in Boston. That hotel had been bought by Stark Industries, and that room was no longer available for public accommodation. Only because that room contained one of the SI president's favourite paintings that she couldn't bear to take away.
A week after the film's release, the studio released a blooper reel. Toni watched the line where she laughs during the dating scene dozens of times, each time closing her computer sighing at how stupid and dumb she was, only to turn it back on a moment later to watch the internet analyse the proof of how much Steve had fallen for her.
The man couldn't help but laugh as he held the large, not yet fully ejaculated cock irrigating the girl's depths while he moved a good chunk of her towards the end of the bed and felt her head again, "Does it still hurt?"
The girl had mixed feelings at this point, first relieved that it was only the pill and not a communicator or something that had been found, then immediately nervous at the grim look on the face of the man who was now towering over her. She had prided herself on knowing Steve when she had convinced her good teammates to agree to her coming undercover, and she thought she had caught his new temperament over time, but at this point she really didn't know what kind of reaction she was going to face from him.
The man ignored the girl's cries of pain at first, just pulling himself halfway in and halfway out and then quickly into the deepest part of the warm tunnel, until he heard the girl's moans with a hint of petulance in them, and then slowed down a little, nibbling and sucking on her tongue, deploying both her upper and lower mouths at the same time, while saying vaguely, "Just bear with it a little bit, you'll feel great soon. "
Toni lazily opened her eyes and looked at Steve who was waiting by her bedside to wake up, "How did you know?" Without waiting for his answer, Toni closed her eyes again and stretched out comfortably, "Oh yeah, everything about me is on the internet, you can even find pictures of me like that on the internet if you want." Then she reached out and rubbed Steve's blonde hair into a mess.
Pepper had just managed to say, "Are you out of your mind?" when the redhead, Agent Natasha, knocked on the door of the Iron Woman's room with a serious expression, "There's a video I think you need to see, everyone's here."
"You did paint me beautifully, and the painting makes the mansion look like our home, only we didn't get familiar with each other well then, and it's too rusty for the two of us."
He noticed that one of Toni's hands had started rubbing the corner of her shirt again, a small gesture she only did when she was nervous, "You, don't get me wrong, we can still be good teammates can't we? I've got nothing improper to do to you......"
At Tony’s silence, Steve put his hands in his pockets, “I’ll see you around.”
He tried not to make multiple trips to the market if he could help it. He had little to nothing to trade and the currency they used was so foreign to Steve that it hurts his mind to think about. It didn’t help that the people at the shops looked at him with pitying glances, knowing him as the mountain man who rarely spoke, so he tried to be as self-sufficient as he could.
His heart was at peace.
“One of us should stay behind to watch him,” Iron man said.
“Sorry for not introducing ourselves, you have to understand that we are in complete shock that we found you at all,” the red man stated, before laying a hand on his breast, “I’m Hank Pym.”
“Exactly!” Sharon said with a gorgeous smile, “I’ll leave you in James’ care, sounds like the school rush is here.”
“It’s fine, Captain, we know how difficult the situation is,” the woman- Jan Pym said.
At the name, Tony instantly lost all interest in kissing. He instead leaned his face into Steve’s chest, breathing softly.
Peter looked blearily up at him with wide tearful eyes and Tony’s heart broke, “can I not go today? I feel sick.”
Tony held the phone in one hand and the receipt in the other. He had apologized to Sasha and canceled on her, knowing that he would not be able to stop thinking about one particular man. The man he wanted to call when he got home. He weighed the pros and cons of calling Captain America.
“And submissive,” Tony deadpanned, “you might prefer it but not me.”
“You too,” Steve said, “remember that Tony.”
“I didn’t know you were here,” Tony said almost apologetically.
“And you’re taking this ‘
“Oh,” Rogers said, before rubbing the back of his head, “sorry, the common future colloquials…”
“I killed him,” Tony answered, hugging himself, “I was never going to be free if I was in the other dom’s grasp. I took my chance. I- for all the years- my father- Obi- I was never going to be free. I just wanted it to end-“
“What’s the problem?” Clint asked.
“Go ahead and open it,” Steve urged.
“Don’t pity me,” Tony snapped, “I got what I deserved, didn’t I?”
“If you do…” Rogers said, holding his back to Tony, “I won’t stop you from pursuing him.”
“You really believe that,” the dom with scraggly hair growled.
Those bright blue eyes looked lost under those sunglasses, “Tony?”
“What happened,” Rogers asked, his tone chilling.
“You never minded me skipping out on meetings before,” Tony grouched.
“Please,” his voice cut off. He was shaking so hard a stray breeze could keel him over, but a hand on his shoulder reminded him that he needed to be strong. For Peter. He would be strong, “If someone, anyone has any information on the…” he couldn’t say the goddamn word.
He was on stage. Performing.
“Steve-“
“Oh, yeah, yeah, of course, sorry!” Steve apologized, quickly going back to the screen and blanking, “what was that again?”
Tony flinched, angry tears spilling, “you didn’t seem to think that when I made adjustments to the phone model you were having trouble with!”
“Quiet!” Natasha snapped, staring at the screen.
Greg took in Tony’s winded appearance, “what are you hiding, brother.”
Tony's breath was ragged when Steve appeared, not five minutes later. Jarvis let him in.
“Alright,” Steve said quietly, “do you all have powers?”
“Absolutely not,” Tony snapped automatically.
That was when a loud
Rogers stared at him like he couldn’t believe what he was hearing, “used you?”
“I don’t know! I fought my way into this goddamn playhouse and this is what happens! Ugh! I’m always the supporting role! The side character! The goddamn love interest! I just want to be the main character! Just this once…” Tony laid down on the grass, “is that too much to ask?”
Tony hesitated, but Steve didn’t take it personally. He knew it would take time. And he was willing to wait their whole lives for it.
“It’s good to meet you, Dr. Banner. Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled,” Tony said quietly.
The packed his pitifully few things and left the house in his van.
and the table cracked. Tony stared at the table before Rogers stood up, “excuse me.”
“Fuck, shit,” Tony grasped his heart, breathing running ragged. For a second, a brief second, he felt the memory of sand in his mouth. It was enough to push his false heart into high gear.
Tony reached out and wrapped his arms around Rogers, kissing his dom hot and heavy. His dom released small huff of surprise. He relied on all the tricks Obi liked, licking the inside of his dom’s mouth, swinging a thigh around Roger’s strong hips and hooking the dom closer, rubbing himself on Roger’s strong cock. And his dom seemed receptive towards Tony’s advances, touching his chest, his lithe waist, squeezing his ass.
“I taught him well,” Bucky smiled.
“It’s necessary,” the guard explained through the buzzing in Tony’s ears, “so the sub nor the dom drop. Don’t worry, we give fresh sheets every-“
I changed the perp of Tony’s sexual harrassment from random Arron dude to Hammer. It just doesn’t make sense as Arron so there’s that. That’s the only retcon I made. Other than that, enjoy the new chapter.
“Depends… on what you want,” Tony grouched, standing at the side of the room and hugging himself.
“Four years…” Tony said, voice hollow.
At his innocent question, his room became tense and uncomfortable.
“Steve,” Tony said softly, “it’s alright.”
Off in the distance, an older woman was jogging up to them, “Tammy! Tammy, come here!”
“Oh, no, never. I would never,” Steve said, flustered.
“My darling,” the thousands of melodic voices said, “please, look at me.”
“You fucking stuck up bastard, hiding behind your friends. You think this is how a real alpha acts?” Rhodey snarled.
Tony leaned against the window of the prison bus.
Until his brother filled the role of iron man and shot up to the sky.
At the word, Steve’s eyes shot open. His vision was hazy, only able to discern red, gold, fluttering red, and strange grays. He blinked, quickly adjusting his sight to the strange visage before him.
“What?” Tony gasped, confused.
What the seven hells? What was this?
Greg spread his arms wide, “billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist.”
“What chu doing, Uncle Stevie?” Morgan asked innocently.
“Is daddy going to be ok?” Harley asked.
“This is a warning,” the quiet dark scraggly haired dom from the lunch table said, “you touch Steve’s sub and you’ll face the consequences.”
“Ye-yellow,” Tony rasped out, heart racing.
Steve smiled softly as Tony hummed something, walking out of the room.
“Daddy, I can’t sleep.”
Until one night, when he said his goodbyes, getting ready for bed, and a woman appeared out of nowhere.
He picked his omega up in his arm, wrapping Tony’s legs around his waist and carried the omega to the bedroom.
“He needs human contact, Captain Rogers.”
“Alright,” Tony said softly, “but, I have conditions.”
“Damn, Stane got you wrapped around his finger,” Natasha said with a small smile.
“Would you, god of sea and sky, take this son of the earth to be your lawfully wedded husband for all to see?” The gruff older voice asked.
Tony was almost used to this new normal. Where things weren’t expected of him and he was allowed to go as he pleased, do as he pleased. After that demonstration, the other doms in the prison were almost afraid of him, going out of their way to avoid him or let him pass. How unexpected that he’d find more freedom in prison than in the real world at large.
“We don’t know what happens behind closed doors,” the red haired sub said.
Tony never felt comfortable crying in front of anyone, but he knew Rhodey would never judge. Rhodey hated Tony’s situation and would change it in a heartbeat. But it was already set in stone. Rhodey knew that Tony would rather die than give up his freedom, which was why he monitored his best friend as much as possible during this last year. It fucking sucked because it felt like he was monitoring Tony’s last days of freedom. Because once Tony was in Obi’s clutches, he’d never be free again.
“You have to do something about your sub,” Bucky stared at Rogers with shrewd eyes, “everyone wants a taste of Stane.”
Bucky chuckled, “I see you’re still gone on that pretty omega.”
“We need to examine each prisoner before they are given them,” the guard drawled.
When Tony unwrapped the paper, his eyes widened in shock, “is this… a starkpad?”
For the next couple of days, Bucky shadowed Tony, quietly telling him what to do and how things were done. He taught Tony how to man the register, how to get the food items ready, how to clean, clean, clean- everything had to be cleaned ten times over- and most difficult of all, how to make the drinks.
“Forgive me,” Steve said softly over the roar of sounds around him. He was almost certain Peggy couldn’t hear him. He couldn’t even hear her voice anymore. But it didn’t matter.
“One day, Obi was considering signing me over to him. He was bored of having me, you see. He was eyeing a new sub in his office. I was… broken in his eyes. He would be doing the dom a favor by signing me over to him. I was… I saw red…” Tony felt his eyes glaze with tears.
“I’m fine, Steve,” Tony said, staring into Steve with glazed dark eyes, “I- I never thought I could be happy.”
“Guards!” Hammer spluttered, banging on the prison doors, “let me in!”
“How would you like me?” Tony asked, eyes dull and lifeless like the light it once held was sucked out.
“Oh. That’s Tony,” Greg continued, “Pep! When are you going to let me in your pants?”
“I’m going out,” Bucky leaned away from him and stood up, slamming the door on the way out.
It was Steve’s turn to look confused, “me?”
Tony stared at Rogers, confused, “love… Bruce?”
“Have you…” Tony asked, looking away, “have you heard anything about Ransom?”
“Of course,” Reed said.
“Haha, very funny,” Steve heard that melodic voice say as Tony grabbed the drink then walk out of the store. Steve looked down at the brown bag with the danish and froze. In that spit second, he made his decision. Steve took off his apron.
Tony even thought he saw a grand portrait of himself in one of the rooms, though he was quickly ushered away.
Tony felt numb as he fell into bed.
“It was years ago… before all this…” Tony waved half heartedly around, “but…”
“What does that even fucking mean?” Bucky asked exhausted.
“Green,” Tony whispered back.
This man couldn’t be serious. Stark Industries was widely known as much as Tony was, but Peter explained it to the man as Tony’s hackles raised.
“Thank you so much,” the man said with a smile that made Tony’s face grow hot.
After Steve hung up, Tony looked down at his phone and realized that his phone was on no caller ID mode. He shouldn’t show up. This smelled like trouble.
“A cursory scan shows no sign of abnormality, Captain,” his old AI said, “a more intensive scan is required-“
“Good,” Bucky said before snatching a sanitized dish towel and heading off, “holler if you need help.”
Perhaps when Ransom returned, he would give a stern talk with his brother on how to keep his omega happy.
“We’re here. This is your new-,” the guard said, frowning as she looked at him, “are you alright?”
“Oh! Ransom- honey, you’re-,” Tony jumped, turning around.
“There are things Greg isn’t telling us… and now Steve Rogers has taken an interest in you. Things are just not adding up,” the redhead said, “there’s something… about you.”
The blonde haired man just shrugged and went to the sink to brush his teeth.
“There’s nothing wrong with an omega chasing after what he/she wants,” Steve said.
“Iron man, I don’t think-“
“Sorry, that’s my mom, bye! It was nice to meet you, Captain America and Captain America’s friend!”
“Hello, how can I help you,” Tony said brightly, giving his best customer service voice.
“Thanks, Steve,” someone else said from far away.
Tony smiled and, even though his face was blotchy from crying, Steve couldn’t help see how beautiful it was, “thank you, Steve. You’re such a good man. How have you not found someone yet?”
Rogers laughed and it was bright and light, “that’s classified information. If I tell you, I would have to kill you.”
“You love him,” Buck said almost incredulous, “you still love him.”
He was on his nth girlfriend, bringing her to meet Ransom and Tony, when Tony took him aside, “Steve, I worry about you. When are you going to settle down and start your own family?”
“I’m going to go,” Steve said softly, turning to go back to his van.
” Steve blew a raspberry in the giggling girl’s stomach.
“Then we can do this. We just gotta make sure Tony doesn’t know we’re teaming up.”
“Because there is someone in you. Someone wonderful, strong, gorgeous. Someone I could get lost in. Someone I could love fiercely with all my heart,” Rogers confessed passionately, holding Tony’s face in one hand. Tony leaned into it, anticipating a kiss, “but he’s not there. Not yet.”
It felt like a finality, one he couldn’t bear to think about, maybe it was the booze talking, so maybe that’s why he blurted out, “I’m sorry.”
Tony looked at each avenger carefully, there was something wrong here. Something really wrong, “what going on, Fri?”
“Do you believe his loyalties are for the Avengers and not this Anthony Stark person?” Steve asked as he put on the bland faded green pants. It didn’t fit him quite right but he wasn’t picky. He was glad to be out of his wet uniform and in some fresh clothes if he was going to be honest.
“You know,” Steve said, “you’re the first person I’ve told that… I miss my past…”
“Come on,” Tony said gently, shaking Peter, “you have to get to school.
“Where are you going, Daddy?” Morgan asked, eyes wide and sad.
After a while of small orders which Tony could handle, Bucky turned to him, “I’m going to take care of customer support and clean the handle and outside tables, can you handle things here on your own?”
Steve brought his mother in for a routine check up at the doctors when they randomly asked her if she ever had a mammogram.
“Why did you talk to me at the coffee shop?” Tony demanded.
He stripped down to his underwear and waited to be handed his prison clothes, until the guard told him, “continue.”
“-shouldn’t be possible, he’s been in the ice for 50 years-“
Whatever he expected… he had not expected to see a large lion sprawled on the sofa of the large guest living room, looking up at him with sad blue eyes.
“Cap, what are you doing! Get back into battle!”
“You did that on purpose,” Steve growled, angrily.
Rogers did nothing, continuing with how he acted before this whole debacle. Thankfully, Tony was only harassed minutely. What the dark haired dom did to Arron was enough to deter any other doms from doing the same.
“Makes me wonder why Hydra let the Starks keep such an enormous collection of Captain America memorabilia,” Reed said, contemplative.
That night he scoured the internet for everything he could find on stage 2 breast cancer. The outlook… looked good. It seemed survivable.
“Why does Uncle Steve always watch papa?” Morgan asked Bucky with all the innocence of a child.
Tony felt bad that he couldn’t remember everyone’s names but he tried his best. It was hard honest work and Tony found himself enjoying it at times. The only thing he didn’t enjoy about the job were, surprisingly, his breaks.
Silence.
“It’s good to know Captain Sweatpants has a sense of humor,” a man in a ridiculous purple suit grouched.
The first thing he saw was the blonde hair, a crown on top of a tall, impossibly well muscled man with a handsome face and bright blue eyes. Those cold eyes that sparkled with amusement as they watched Tony, his rabbit heart beating fast.
“The mandarin? You mean the language?” Clint asked.
“Nothing’s going to happen to you,” Steve said genuinely.
“Welcome, as you say, back to the world of the living!”
“Holy-“ Steve jumped in his seat on the bed.
Steve turned back, hating how hopeful he felt at that very moment.
“You owe me a fuckin’ explanation,” Bucky snapped.
Tony went back to his quiet normal life.
“Can we see the penguins next?” Peter asked, tugging on Tony’s sleeve.
“What’s wrong, mom,” Steve stood up from where he sat at the kitchen table. It couldn’t be-
“Well, not anymore,” Tony said quietly.
Steve stared at Tony’s wide, tearful doe eyes, at a loss for words.
“Tony, Tony, hang in there for me!”
Steve stared down at his lover, recalling the sick things Tony had said about how he was being given over to men when he didn’t want to be.
Tony looked up to see Greg flying over them and Rogers sprang into motion.
”If you would come in and follow me,” the man said quietly, looking up, “looks like it might rain.”
“Steve,” Tony looked even more uncomfortable, “you’re drunk.”
“Hammer, I’d like to talk in private if I may,” Rogers said.
There was a certain rhythm to the friend group as well, because that’s what Rogers saw the people in his group as, equals. Even the subs. The loud mouthed chatty sub was Clint Barton. The quiet dom was Bucky Barnes. The red haired sub was Natasha Romanov. A blonde dom named Thor and his switch brother Loki. And there was a switch that would occasionally join them. His name was Bruce Banner.
He had been living with his parents and, while his mom doted on Peter, his father would point out all the mistakes Tony made when he raised his son. His father didn’t even like to look at Peter, reminded that his stupid son adopted a child rather than going for the normal nuclear family option.
“Everyone, out,” Rogers commanded, his voice sharp.
The entire table went quiet.
“Tony,” Steve took five strides into the apartment, kneeling before him, “what happened?”
Steve… well, he looked like shit. At least as much as someone like Steve was able to. Eyes sullen, hair astray, stance hunched, both arms wrapped around his own torso. There was no guilt on his face, of course there wasn’t, but he was looking at Tony’s reflection in the glass with an intense sort of regret.
There was a short pause before Tony found his voice, but nothing could keep the disbelief from leaking into his voice. “Honey—it’s not a character fault that you’re willing to help. You came here to do good—”
As Steve looked at each of them more closely, it became clear that some were more battered than others, but at first glance, nothing seemed too serious. Natasha had some smaller scratches on her face and Sam was kneading his left leg with a pained expression. Bruce stretched his arms, his bones popping with the movement, then wrapped the warming blanket more tightly around his bare chest.
Steve had things to say to that, but decided to refrain. Perhaps Stane was more perceptive when he cared to be. That wouldn't be surprising. "Thank you, Ms. Potts."
,” Tony said with feeling. His lips moved down to Steve’s nipples, sucking one of them through Steve’s shirt, as he fisted the hem of it and pulled it out of his pants. He brushed another kiss across the skin of his chest, pulling the shirt off of him. “You’re so perfect,” he breathed with a look of awe.
His life was beyond screwed up.
“People are gonna die, Buck,” Steve said very slowly. “I can’t let that happen.”
"Of course not," he said, trying to keep the statement from coming out forceful. "And you?" It was a strange thing to ask, he mused. He rarely found himself tumbling into bed with someone without being a hundred percent sure he wanted to be there.
“We’ve been together for almost three years now. Are you still happy? Crazy murder robots aside, I know I work too much, and I know Extremis bothers you, and I just… can’t stop wondering if you still want this.”
Tony offered a little wave with hand, which was enough to break Steve from his daze. The air between them was suspended. He heard Tony breathing. Watched the curve of his mouth as he smiled at him. “Surprise,” he said.
Steve licked his lips, trying to keep a stoic face.
God, it was hard to believe they’d all been this happy once.
Steve swallowed thickly and said nothing as he tracked Stane’s movements.
When Steve finally stepped into the bedroom, he felt as though he was walking into a tomb. The upper part of Clint’s house was so quiet, he could almost hear the dust fall behind him as he moved. There was a very persistent pain in his gut—a strange combination of both sadness, and the beginnings of familiar pangs of separation. It really only had been that one day, since he and Tony had been close, but it already felt as if he hadn’t touched him in a lifetime. And Steve had never coped well with being apart from Tony too long.
It was a strange feeling to admit that, no, there wasn’t. Not in such a short amount of time, anyway. “Zola’s AI is constantly rewriting itself. It’s not a code I need to crack once, it’s… a Million different codes that are already gonna be invalid once I’m past the first barriers.” He sighed with frustration. “It’s not
“Please don’t,” Tony choked out, trying to grab for Steve’s hand. “Not now, we don’t have a plan for this.”
“Lucky guy,” Tony said, smiling too.
* * *
“We might be the first humans who’ve ever seen these,” Steve said at some point, because he just couldn’t stand the silence anymore. He glanced at Tony. “Isn’t that crazy?”
“Says the man who thought I’d strangle him and still sat by my bed and patted my poor head all night. How’s that linear?”
, Steve thought, and felt himself freezing. That was… he had no idea where that thought had come from, and he fought hard not to let the shock over his own words show. “That’s… that’s a relief,” he said instead.
“I’m sorry,” Tony murmured, trembling. He was
Bucky looked calm as he took in his surroundings, but there was a tremor in his metal arm he couldn’t quite control. Steve could detect the scent of fresh sweat on Bucky’s skin, and it was obvious how nervous he was. Bucky was opening one of the books now, for once not all that wary about his surroundings. That was a good sign, Steve thought; that Bucky wasn’t on edge all that much anymore.
“Look,” he said and held up the phone so Tony could look at the display. “That’s us.”
“If we ever want to defeat Thanos,” Strange said, “we need the combined force of all heroes, and you know it. If the Avengers hadn’t fallen apart before he came here, if we had been a united force, we could’ve beaten him. Now it’s too late.”
Thus, his fist came towards Tony’s face in slow motion and Tony struck it away. Steve threw another blow and Tony countered. It became a slow dance, weaving back and forth, a smooth, intricate motion.
“Stay safe,” he murmured against her mouth, and Natasha drew back, smiling at him.
The first rays of the morning were creeping out over the horizon, causing Steve to look around suspiciously. “Here,” he muttered as he skidded to a stop at the entry of some abandoned factory.
It took over a minute before Tony found his voice again.
it’s the safest place for him. He should have people around him who care. And people who can put him in his place if need be.”
The robot’s head twitched, once, twice, then the sound modulator in its helmet clicked, and Tony could hear his own voice through the room’s speakers:
to look different, didn’t it? Immediately, Tony wondered how his future looked like. 2022 sounded so far away, and yet… it were only four little years.
Tony raised Steve’s gaze with fingers on his chin. He smiled and kissed him deeply. “I’ll miss you, too. So much.”
“She’s alright,” Steve snapped. “Calm down, Bucky.
“Steve?” Tony prompted with a gentle voice.
Hearing his son laugh was the most amazing thing.
It was then when his eyes zeroed in on the white star on his shirt, and Steve thought his eyes almost bogged out.
“It does,” Steve agreed, more calmly. “There are times I miss Peggy for that.”
Steve smiled as he pressed a kiss against Tony’s forehead. “Secret’s safe with me.”
particular news to Barnes sure as hell was Steve’s job. “You’re welcome here, is what I’m saying. And if you don’t mind, I would prefer we don’t talk about my parents. Ever.”
Downing the content himself probably wouldn't be a good move right now.
“I don’t need anything from you!” Tony snapped and brushed past him with reddened cheeks. At that, there was nothing else to say. No objections to voice—nothing but a dry understanding. Over Carol’s head, Rhodes pursed his lips and sent Steve an apologetic look.
Pepper nodded, continuing, “I have to say, though, you’re not at all what I thought you’d be. Not the sort of people that Tony used to…” She frowned, sighing and shaking her head. “That’s not what I mean. I mean that… well, you’re different.” She paused. “You’re nothing like Indries.”
will know.”
“It’s not false modesty when it’s true.”
Sharon reached out for Steve’s hand briefly and then she was gone, Tony’s hold of his waist unwavering.
“We forced his hand, because Ross forced ours,” Rhodey said, then sighed. “I said a few things to Steve I shouldn’t have.”
“You look so good like this,” he said, arching up. Steve’s mouth was molten perfection around him. And just to have his lips around him—his tongue swirling, massaging him as he drew him in deeper, and deeper still, until he brushed the soft back of his throat—that was everything. “Steve—if you keep that up…”
Steve stepped closer—even closer—every part of them just barely touching. “Tony…”
“Because,” Clint continued, “we knew what knowing about him would do to you. We like you, Steve. You were a bit like a lost puppy back then, but we liked you right from the start. You were our friend, and we
Steve swallowed, then nodded, as a small smile rose to his lips. “Alright.
was a thing now. Steve smirked. “Shut it, whatever—Bucky does need our support, and I have done everything in my power to have him free of charge, you
, on the other hand—”
As it was, Tony wouldn’t ask about it, and he figured neither of the two would give him some pointers, so he’d just… keep this on a professional level. Show Barnes the schematics, take his measurements, deliver the prosthesis in a few weeks, and that would be it.
In any case, he’d have to tell Steve, and today was just as good a time as any.
“I know, I know, he makes you happy. But—that thing in him? That ‘Extremis’ thing? I’ve not been around long, Steve, and I see how much space it takes up in his life. Even when he’s here, he’s also… not here. It’s weird. And you can deny it all you want, but I see how much it’s eating you up. When you came back home from that mission, you practically had to drag him inside because he wasn’t paying attention.”
Rhodey sighed. “Well. I’m going get some coffee,” he offered.
* * *
There was a long beat as Steve took him in, heavy emotion storming his eyes. “Of course,” he said quietly, but Tony knew he didn’t like it.
A sigh coursed through Steve’s body. “When I realized I was into you, I think I was more wigged that I wasn’t wigged,” he explained. “Everything… since knowing you, I’ve changed so much in such a small amount of time. And I want more of that. You challenge me, you want me to do better, you’re all I want from here on out.”
“The serum they used wasn’t identical to mine,” Bucky mused. “Their aggression levels often made them lose control over their actions. Maybe they didn’t survive the Cryostasis. Or died right after.”
"Cute couple, aren't they?" Natasha chimed in, eyes sliding from Tony to Steve and back.
* * *
, come on—don’t say that,” Tony said on a fake whine. “Everyone thinks we kept our names, remember?”
Steve tossed him a wink. “Just how I like you.”
“Locate and contain?” Bruce echoed, voice bathed in worry. “I thought we’d decided we’d try to—”
Then he sighed and rebuked himself. He was being pathetic and whiny. Mostly because he hadn’t even
Knowing was one thing. Understanding was something entirely different.
“What,” Tony countered with a soft, resigned voice. “You volunteering?”
“Couldn’t sleep,” Barnes said, then crossed the threshold. He walked towards the other end of the couch, but stopped before he sat down. “Can I?”
he didn't say.
To just not wreck his brain over this mess for a few goddamn hours… it sounded heavenly.
“It seems they are travelling with Agent Rumlow near south side of the city,” JARVIS went on. “Coordinates are being transferred to the Quinjet as we speak.”
Rhodey held up a hand, a deep frown etched on his forehead. “For God’s sakes, Tones, just say it.”
“You look captivated,” he said quietly. Steve only startled slightly at the sound of his voice, and looked at him curiously.
“I never heard you play,” Steve said, feeling a bit bad that he’d never asked. He’d seen old photographs of Maria and little Tony sitting at the piano together, but it had never once crossed his mind that Tony might still be able to play.
“There is no other option—”
“Lovely,” Tony commented, smiling. He took Ian with him as he walked up and down the room. His eyes fell on the door leading to the reading room, and following a sudden thought, he walked into it.
Tony’s eyes were full of pain. “Where I am—
Tony nodded. “That, too.”
Steve glanced to Tony, who only smiled softly. “Peps has a rather liberal definition of the word ‘insist,’” he replied. “I mentioned we were home, and she announced that she would be stopping by today to size you up.”
"You wanna help me out of this?" he offered without even thinking about Tony’s proposal much, gesturing at his uniform with one hand. He didn't want to waste a minute longer on this than he absolutely had to. The notion of a shared shower was just too tempting, so without even waiting for an answer, Steve stooped down to unfasten his boots and shake them off, before straightening up and sending a questioning look in Tony's direction.
It was… it
Tony nodded, though his body was still tense. He felt him clench and unclench around him, then wiggle his hips a little.
The sense of urgency was unbearable, and Steve found himself carrying Tony the rest of the way to the shower. He wanted to feel every part of Tony's body, press their forms together and find how they fit together, rub his palms along every curve and hidden place Tony was sensitive in. He wanted to know everything. How Tony liked to be touched and how he liked to fuck. But he wanted so much more than that. Having seen Tony waking up that morning weeks ago, Steve knew sex alone would never be enough.
that,” Tony said, a little smug now, moving upwards so the head of Steve’s erection nudged against his opening. “Go on then, before I can change my mind.”
Tony swallowed, his eyes still staring at him, but Steve could see he was already on the verge of escaping into Extremis again. “It did. I’m just… tired. Haven’t slept properly in a while. Guess the last weeks took a little more from me than I thought they would. Just too much going on.”
“Hurt?”
“Mostly, yes, but…” Tony paused, frowned, then said, “Imagine it like that: They’re opening their door, and it leads to a corridor with lots of different doors. So we need to be the only other open door at the far end of the corridor, and we need to be open at the exact same time, otherwise there’s a good chance another door accidentally opens and the two of you land in, I don’t know, 2040.”
“For giving us another try, after the Accords.”
” Tony laughed. “You and your Death-on-Wheels? Yeah, I don’t think so.”
Natasha made a noise of discomfort and turned away.
“You like this,” Tony gasped, as he pulled back to look up at Steve. “God, how you look…”
expressions flickering across Tony’s face.
With slow, quiet steps, Steve followed Stane and the steady clicking of his cane through the dark labyrinth that was Stark Mansion. If he’d thought its outward appearance was the impressive part, he stood corrected now.
Tony was a whirlwind of words that kept pouring, one thought after the other, not letting Steve's still hungover brain catch up. He didn't really…
Then again, that wasn’t how they worked.
“You’re gonna do this the old-fashioned way, aren't you?”
Steve paused, wanting so badly to hug Tony, it was almost physically painful. “Thank you. I—I really appreciate it.”
“Steve,” Sam called on the next beat. “There’s someone approaching.”
Around them, a crowd had gathered, snapping photos of the three of them. Only now Tony realized that Fury had, at some point, brought some distance between them. Fair enough, he thought. His disguise would likely not stand a chance once a photo of him was published online.
And Steve Rogers… had never been a possibility.
Tony bit his lower lip and refrained from commenting on that.
…not worth him.
Steve pulled back only slightly, resting his brow against Tony’s. “We shouldn’t stay here.”
“To Stark Mansion.”
changed everything.
Another crack, this one louder, and as they whirled around, the portal was quickly reaching its maximum size. If they hesitated any longer, they’d be stranded here for good.
It seemed Tony’s life had become a walking contradiction. Only a few years ago, he’d been a playboy and he’d known nothing in the world could ever come of it. He’d only showed up at these kinds of events to drink himself stupid before banging whoever came home with him. Then he’d met Steve, who had reshaped his world, giving him new hope. And now he was that kind of guy who had butterflies in his stomach while he was slow-dancing on some gala with his husband.
“Yeah,” he breathed, barely hearing himself over the rush of blood in his head. He gasped at the first touch of Steve’s finger, then closed his eyes when he slowly pushed the digit inside. The following minutes were a steady flow of moans and grunts, of erratic movements of his hips, and fingers that were clawing at the sheets beneath him.
“Uh, thanks?” Tony asked, then frowned. “You realize we’re supposed to fight each other?”
[J.A.R.V.I.S.] [chat_server:46954]
Natasha smiled, satisfied. “Good choice.”
“It’s gonna be great Tony. This is… a completely new step into electrical-engineering, into aerodynamics, and… science in general. Who can say that about their project? Just give it some time.”
he thought, then steeled himself and walked through the doors.
There wasn’t enough alcohol on Dad’s green earth to drown out the harsh light of reality. And fuck it, Tony had tried. In the last few hours, he’d taken shot after shot, which only seemed to have the reverse effect. He couldn’t get drunk. Being the devil, getting drunk was a commitment of both the body and soul. He had to immerse himself in a
"I'm alright," he said, pulling slightly back to look at Tony's face more easily. He looked… shaken, but back to normal mostly. "Thanks for that last minute save."
“‘m n-not Jake G-Gyllenhaal. And I’m n-not gonna get s-sick and die,” Tony stuttered.
“Of course,” Peggy said. “Not much use with me, has it?”
What had seemed a cute, funny idea, was now more daunting than he'd expected.
Steve flushed but didn’t break eye contact. “Yeah, I want it.”
. That’s what this is. I forgot how that even looks like. Why do you look happy?”
They stood no chance. No chance at all. He elbowed one hard before choking him, then punched another with his shield. He blocked the swing of the third merc, kneeing him so hard in the gut, he fell down and didn’t get up again, before throwing number four into the railing. The metal links clamored loudly with the impact. He made a feeble try to stand up again, but Steve only took a step back, and watched as one of Clint’s arrows embedded itself into the man’s thigh, sending him to the ground.
“No detours.”
"You can tell me, you know," Steve said, trying to find the right way to coax Tony to tell him what was wrong. "We're on the same team…"
Tony rolled over and opened one bleary eye. “Can’t you let a man die in peace?” he grumbled.
Tony flinched in surprise, however, when Ant-Guy was suddenly right behind him. He shot a repulsor blast at him, but the guy ducked and it shot straight towards Clint instead. The beam pierced straight through the air, and hit Clint’s arm.
The day after Tony had kissed Steve, the kid had all but exploded over the mass media with his breakthrough A.I. code. For a whole week, Tony was about everywhere, in the newspapers, as well as on television. Steve had been a little apprehensive at first, worried that Tony might seek revenge, now that he had his fame to lean on, but the blow never came. He kept his mouth shut, and Steve would have liked to say he was relieved but…
… Tony’s life had been at stake so many times, and it sure as hell hadn’t felt like a cartoon.
“Exactly.”
time they’d been here. When an army had waited at their doorsteps, when Earth had been mere seconds from its final destruction.
They arrived at the building shortly after that, and quickly headed into the Tower.
He surely wouldn’t talk to Tony about any kind of
Steve felt his heart swell with warmth. And if nothing else, he resolved to never underestimate Tony’s love for him again. “So, this is it… you, me…?”
Steve’s hands abandoned Tony’s hips and grasped his arms again, holding him fiercely as the waves crashed over him. Tony was quivering against him. Shaking almost. And when Steve looked down, he realized that Tony must’ve come too, if the slightly damp stain on his jeans was any indication. And slowly, allowing a few moments to tick by, he opened his eyes, finding Tony’s upon his.
Steve looked to Sam, then Natasha, then back down on his hands. He shook his head.
Books were obviously not Barnes’ forte, no matter how many Steve secretly deposited in his room; but the way he was surrounding himself with the new media was liberating. Two days ago, Bruce had brought him a tablet, and Barnes seemed to handle it with ease. He had probably learned all about new technologies in his training, but never had the freedom to simply explore on his own leisure.
“I forgot how stubborn you can be,” Tony mumbled against his lips, as they wrapped both of their arms around each other.
[J.A.R.V.I.S.] [chat_server:46954]
. There was obvious doubt in Steve’s eyes, but all of that was over-layered with so much damn stubbornness, that Tony knew his next words before he ever opened his mouth. “You need to let me try. I might not get another chance.”
* * *
, and not his almost-naked body, the teasing amusement was back full force.
It was almost peaceful now—everyone was likely preparing for the visitors—and the dread Steve had often felt when he walked past the many portraits on the wall was merely a faint echo. The mansion was just that: a mansion. Nothing haunted about it.
Tony would end up coming for him, after all. With a swallow, he shoved the chip over his shoulder and into the empty slot. Steve’s heart hammered. A tight, anxious feeling wound its way up his chest as he worried, like he did every time, that this wasn’t going to work, before—exhale, relief—there was the softest of clicks and the lock released.
“Oh, you do,” Jarvis said gently. He was about to turn around and leave, but he seemed to decide against it in the last moment, instead he once more put a hand on Steve’s shoulder, squeezing it lightly. “I know Anthony isn’t an easy man to deal with and you’re still very young. But he is a good man. Try to remember this, for I know living here will put you through a great deal of trials.”
. Steve’s eyes almost bogged out as Howard walked straight towards him. His hair was gray, his face wrinkled, only his eyes were exactly as Steve remembered them. Brown, and brilliant and so similar to his son’s that it was startling.
Steve paused, rubbing a hand over his forehead as he felt his cheeks heat. Yes, definitely lovers. Just—
Ultron growled as he tried standing up again. It was then that Steve spotted his eyes flickering between black and red, and the small spasms in his arms. He looked pained, as much as his robotic features allowed—pained, and a whole lot distracted.
There was no time to spare for hesitation anymore.
And, well, he was also really desperate.
A choked moan left his lips. “Nat…”
A man Tony didn’t know waited for him there. He sat alone at the huge-ass oval conference table and Tony saw him paging through the latest Accords version.
Tony’s head had tilted as he considered him. “Are you alright? You seem… I don’t know. Like something’s bothering you.”
A breathy gasp left Tony’s lips when Steve touched him. He moved against his hand before he could really help himself. Half of his mind was still busy processing the words Steve had returned in kind, because while he’d known, hearing it for the first time—as cheesy as it sounded—was something to be memorized.
“I was only half joking,” Tony murmured, thinking back. “It was never apples and sunshine with us, but I guess it all turned to shit when I built Ultron.”
“What... what’s been happening while I’ve been gone?” Steve asked.
“Real?” Steve continued as he kissed down Tony’s throat hungrily. The one hand that wasn’t still holding Tony up came to rest on his arc reactor. “Feels real to me.”
Eventually, Tony lifted the plane in the air, inspecting it before handing it over to Cooper. “There, better than ever.”
“You scared me,” Steve mumbled against Tony’s lips, and he looked as troubled as Tony had ever seen him. “The vision,” he continued, as he pressed their foreheads together. “The vision Wanda Maximoff showed me, it was exactly that… you going rogue, doing what Ultron told you to do. I knew I needed to kill you and I couldn’t. I
Steve shook his head, a small smile curving his lips. “Trust me, you don’t wanna know.”
Steve walked a few more steps before he realized he’d walked towards the west wing the whole time. Right into Indries’ room.
He smiled weakly. That had not been what he’d had in mind for this day. There should’ve been kisses and a real fucking date, for once, and now he was—what—persuading Steve that being with him wasn’t a good idea?
Bucky opened his mouth to say something, clearly seeing through Natasha’s scheme, but she simply ignored him and made to stand up.
That was… irrelevant, Tony guessed, but good to know, anyways. But then the guy was clapping a hand on Steve’s shoulder and making to stand up.
He needed Tony to say his name.
“Steve…” Tony breathed, and there was now a palpable tremble in his voice that had Steve step closer to him.
“Don’t worry, you look great,” Rhodey complimented him. He turned and prodded Tony’s arm. “Say something, man.”
“There
Tony closed his eyes briefly. Now that he was looking for it, Extremis could feel the new presence surrounding every known space in his head. It was not unlike communicating with JARVIS usually felt like—a steady omnipresence buzzing at the edges of his mind—but this was bigger, and… it was growing,
Natasha grinned deviously. “Nah, if I wanted to make money with compromising photos of you, I’d have started years ago.”
TS 9:43 P.M.>Where the fuck are you?
you’ve seen it all, and
Steve had a point with that, Tony thought as he closed his eyes briefly. It just didn’t change the fact that the Accords would happen no matter what, and they needed to find a way to keep doing their job.
“It’s been sixteen years for them,” Steve reminded her with a shake of the head. “And anyway, I don’t know much about them, they were kinda… reclusive. I wouldn’t know where to start looking.”
The words had a lump form in Steve’s throat, and he couldn’t find a way to answer properly. He knew—
“Drop your weapon, Captain.”
Steve’s heart leapt in his chest. “I’m so sorry you had to go through all that,” he said. On a second thought, he let himself sink down on the bed, taking Tony with him. They lay down next to each other, face to face.
what I meant,” Tony said on a chuckle. “Fuck you, Rogers.”
“Sure,” Tony said. “Your room’s still the same. It hasn’t changed since you left.”
The deaths.
“But… how?” he breathed.
Bucky huffed but didn’t deny it. They all knew he had a sweet tooth.
“What? You thought that explaining that it was necessary and we were all just too dumb to understand it was going to make me feel better?”
Once… once all of this was over, he would talk to Bucky, and finally tell him that… no matter what, his parents' death wasn’t on him, and that—that he was his friend. Not a guy he had to deal with because he was Steve’s chosen brother, but because he wanted him around. In his team, in his home, at his side.
. There it was, the big number. And for a whole day, he’d gotten to kiss Steve whenever and wherever he’d wanted to. It had been perfect. The perfect birthday.
Steve’s head arched slightly against him when he released a long moan, a smile tickling his lips. Tony cupped him with pristine tenderness, thumb rubbing circles into his sensitive skin with shy reserve.
“Heya, Cap,” he said. “Can’t sleep?”
"I'm counting on it," Steve heard himself say before he could think better of it. It was… too much, wasn't it? He glanced briefly at Tony but couldn't quite read his reaction. He was smiling absently with the fork in his mouth, but that was all. Steve took a steadying breath then and turned to dig in. He couldn't deny that he was pretty much starving at this point.
Steve did not realize that Natasha and Nick left until he heard the bells at the door chimed and then they were left alone.
Tony felt bad for soulmate, if he has one he added bitterly, he wonders if they have a birthmark on their chest right where his reactor sits. And the only reason why he thought about his soulmate is because the reactor that is saving him, is also killing him. It turns out overtime and constant exposure to palladium is actually toxic to humans. Tony thought about trying to write an article about it, most science papers still claim that palladium isn’t harmful to humans but Tony know that isn’t correct anymore.
When they broke apart they looked each other in the eyes, trying to catch their breaths. Both of their faces were flushed and Steve could hear his heart beat in his ears and he wonder if it was pounding hard enough for Tony to hear as well.
Everyone was born with a “tattoo” or that’s what Steve and the other kids called it. This tattoo is more commonly known as a soulmate birthmark, though it’s very common that the birthmark actually looks like something realistic rather than just a random mark. Most of the birthmarks resemble an important event that happened to the significant other and sometimes they didn’t make sense until the story was told. Though it was rare, these birthmarks can change as the story changes and if the birthmark disappeared it usually meant so did your soulmate.
Steve felt the blood rush to his face and his heart started to soar. He recalls all the times people told him that being touched by his soulmate would cause a feeling that was so unique and would never be able to replicate. Steve decided to sneak a glance at Tony, seeing that Tony’s eyes were closed and his face was flushed. They continue to sit like this until Tony sighed and moved his head off of Steve’s shoulder. Steve felt his whole body become cold and he desperately wanted to bring Tony back to him. Tony heaved himself off the floor and left without a word.
It was not until a random Tuesday, did they finally interact. Steve was in the gym again, warming up before going at the punching bag. When Tony entered the gym, Steve froze in his movements simply watching Tony entered and settling himself on the floor beside the bench where Steve’s bag sat, it was not until Tony made a hand gesture that Steve realized Tony was giving him the okay to continue what he was previously doing.
Natasha had given Steve a weird look when she saw how his birthmark had changed over the last few days. She had asked him about it but he said he didn’t even understand what was happening. He had no way to hide it and when Nick saw it, he was not amused. Steve and Natasha were ordered to wait inside while Nick got Tony down from his bird’s eye view to talk to them. They heard the bells chime as Nick guided Tony inside where they were sitting.
It seemed that Tony had collected all of Steve’s busted knuckle scars he had gotten over the years and that’s when Steve made the connection that his birthmark was Tony’s reactor that sat in his chest, right at his sternum. Hindsight is always 20/20 because it made sense why Natasha had actually requested Steve come with them, why Natasha had given him weird looks and why Nick wasn’t amused with his soul mark. It was because his soulmate was no other than Tony Stark, the child of a man Steve respected but would be totally happy if he had the change to punch him in the face at least once.
One day Tony noticed it didn’t seem like he had his multi-tones to him anymore and he couldn’t help but be relief but in its place his knuckles seemed to be scattered with freckles. Tony brushed it off though, it was better than being cold and not tanning evenly.
Steve thoughts were interrupted when Fury sent a message saying he would be joining Natasha and himself on a mission to talk to Tony Stark. Steve rolled his eyes but moved to get ready. He had never actually met Howard’s kid, S.H.I.E.L.D has had a few field days with him and it turns out that Tony might have some of the same Stark charm that Steve remembers.
After a week long mission with Tony, Steve was desperate to see him, be near him and continue their unspoken routine. Steve felt drained from the mission, it was hard, tough and innocent lives were lost. Steve wandered around the compound, not wanting to go to his room because he knew his thoughts would be able to run free. Before Steve knew it, he was outside of Tony’s lab and he heard the door click as it unlocked. STeve entered cautiously, not wanting to scary Tony if he was deep in work or thought. He saw Tony working on his computer, without looking up Tony motion to the stool beside him. Steve left out a sigh as he sat down and without thinking he rested his head on Tony’s shoulder. STeve felt Tony stiffen under him but he relax after a few moments and went back to work on the computer.
Steve had a weird soul tattoo, it did not resemble anything and more recently it had been worrying him. The birthmark started at his chest, right where his sternum is, it was a solid purplish-blue color that was in a perfect circle and it had branches stretching from it. Most of the branching followed his veins and more recently it was growing. The birthmark that could once be easily concealed was getting harder to hide with just a shirt. The branching now went up his neck and even started to show up on the left side of his face. Steve started to hate it before he had thawed, he just had the circle on his chest but now this was getting ridiculous, what on earth was happening to his soulmate for this to be happening.
Steve slowly turned to look at Tony and before he could get the first word out, the waitress came by to fill their coffee cups and as for their orders.
Not wanting to think anymore, Tony put on his armor and left his house. He managed to land himself at his favorite donut place, he moved to sit inside the donut sign and enjoy his donuts in peace but Nick Fury decided to have other plans.
Before Steve knew it, there was a pair of lips on his. Steve gasped softly, eyes fluttering closed and kissing back instantly. It felt as though electricity was running through Steve’s body. Steve could hear ringing in his ears, see fireworks behind his eyes and his soul-mark glowing with warmth.
Part Two of Changing Soulmark.
After a long wait, here is part twp. The excuse I have is I'm a college kid and my writing laptop is still in the shop and I've been lacking inspiration for it.
Steve’s eye instantly opened and took a deep breath, this was the first time Tony talked to him that did not deal with a mission. Steve looked up at Tony under his eyelashes.
Steve was frozen when he saw the man before him, Tony had similar vein pattern up his neck as Steve did but Tony was avoiding all eye contact with him. Tony focused on Natasha and Nick, the only time Tony looked at him was as he gasped as Natasha gave him a shot of Lithium Oxide. Steve watched as the vein look disappeared from Tony’s face and neck, Tony eye furrowed and immediately looked at Steve’s hand that rested on the table then his own.
Steve was suddenly lowered onto the bed with a "don't know what to say" expression, and not quite satisfied with his reaction, the girl made another fake-like gesture of baring her teeth. The man grinned and gpt his upper body up to give her a kiss on the lips before settling back down again, "Let's see how good you are, then."
