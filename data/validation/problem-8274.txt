...the phone message was forgotten in favor of cuddling with Peter, and across town in Brooklyn Heights, Steve kept staring at the note on his phone that said the message had been
“Where do you work?”
“I’ll have a day off at some point next week.” The Omega said after a moment. “I know that’s almost three weeks since I saw you, but it’s about the best I can do. I had to beg my boss to keep my job, I can’t risk trying to take a day off too early.”
okay?” the Alpha got close enough to scent the misery hanging around Tony’s shoulders and she crooned under her breath at him. “Oh sweetheart, what’s wrong?”
“Then let me see.” Tony wiggled off the Alpha’s lap and back to his own seat, picking up the boxes of clothes while Steve picked his plate back up to finish his food. “Steve, this is six boxes! I only picked out a couple outfits!”
Tony couldn't think past the way Steve's muscles shifted beneath his fingertips or the way the Alpha's rosewood scent layered hazy
********
“So we should do cash.” Steve finished. “I’ll break your allowance up into each date that way you aren’t ever putting effort out here without being compensated. How’s that?”
“Yes.” More sure of his decision by the second, Tony ignored Bucky and took Natasha’s hand to lead her to where Peter was playing with Peggy. A day ago, an
“Be nice.” Bucky repeated and patted his friend only lightly on the back. “You can kick my ass later, if you wanna fight I’ll even let you get a few swings in before I start protecting my face, but
thing he wanted to do was ask Tony what the
“It's alright.” Tony whispered, and the Alpha groaned something unintelligible, set the plates aside and sat back down so he could frame Tony's face in both his hands and kiss him harder. A strong arm went like steel around Tony's little waist, the shirt rucking up his back and making Tony gasp all over again when calloused fingers swept over a strip of bare skin.
“Okay baby, just let me hold you, come here--”
“Oh.” Steve’s eyes widened, heart beat quickening at the offer. It was always up to an Omega parent to introduce a child, even in traditional relationships with an Alpha parent present it was
alright? Head over heels done. Stick a fork in me, I was all sorts of
“And he’s--” awkwardly, hesitantly, because Bucky wasn’t sure he really wanted confirmation of what he already pretty much knew. “Three? That would’a made you seventeen? That’s-- that’s like your first heat, right? Got knocked up first time around?”
“Do you like it?” Steve grinned, all too pleased with the sight of the Omega poking around in his living room looking simply
. “I came back eventually though. New York is home, I couldn’t imagine living anywhere else.”
The Alpha just didn’t
“Do not--” Steve’s voice
“Maybe we can change the schedule after we know each other a bit better.” he offered, and that was only a
you want, I just wanna spoil th’hell outta ya, treat you right and listen to you sweet talk me when you get all blushy and gorgeous…”
“Oh Tony, he’s gorgeous.” The Alpha swallowed, then swallowed again when the words came dry, his throat suddenly raspy. “Honey, he’s-- he’s perfect. He looks just like you. What a beautiful little guy.”
“Maybe next time.” He stayed leaning into Tony’s space only the slightest, giving the Omega plenty of room to encourage or reject him. “But could I kiss you this time instead?”
Three hours later, he was standing in front of a block of ice, approximately 8x4x4 feet, with rough edges that were only just starting to melt off and become clear enough to let Tony see the frozen remains of the world’s first and only supersoldier. Only the heaters in his suit or armor kept him warm. A block of ice this size radiated an incredible cold into the room.
“Stuff, huh?” Stark looked slightly amused, taking Steve in from top to bottom. There was a hesitance to him, but something else seemed to win out.
“I want to retire here.” Tony told him, still in Steve’s arms, but both of them neck deep in the pleasantly warm water.
“Everything…but, my upper back around the ribs and the lower back. Neck too.” He cut himself off and Steve had a feeling that the man was in need of a full-body massage, more than anyone Steve had ever treated. If his client wasn’t so skittish, Steve would have suggested as much, but he understood that this had to be Stark’s time, and that his priorities were what counted, at least this time around.
And so, Tony sent everyone away to continue their own research while he waited. He stood and watched as the water dripped off the block of ice. Dark thoughts clouded his mind as he couldn’t stop his own resentment from bubbling up again. This was the man he’d been measured up against all his childhood. And for what? What kind of a father compared a child to a grown man?
When his phone rang, and a female voice asked to speak to him about the NDA it took him a moment to remember. He had paused at the entrance to a subway tunnel to take the call and had to shift his bags around awkwardly, trying to balance his grip on his massage table carrier bag, his backpack and his phone so he could hold it while he spoke.
He turned to face Miss Potts. In her heels, she wasn’t much shorter than Steve. Her long hair was in a sleek knot and the dress she wore made it clear that she’d come straight from work.
Steve kissed the back of Tony’s neck, lovingly nuzzling it, his hand sliding over his front to come and rest over the thick scar tissue on his chest, protectively cradling Tony’s artificial sternum where the skin grafts had come out slightly raised. Tony was so much healthier now, thanks to this operation and Steve was so grateful he was feeling well overall now. The last year with the reactor had been rough, and physiotherapy was an ongoing effort, but Tony was doing so well. Steve couldn’t be prouder or happier.
“I told Pepper; I don’t want this.” Stark said quietly where he stood at the entrance to the corridor, looking at Steve with something bordering on mistrust. He seemed ready to bail. “You can pack up and go, you’ll be paid for your time on your way out.”
“I’ll pack up for today then. Would you like to re-book right now, or do you want to call me?” He asked.
Steve turned them around, pushing Tony down onto the bed and covering Tony’s body with his own, barely missing a beat before he picked the rhythm up again.
Steve loved Sam's body. He really did. Not in a romantic or sexual way; they'd never been like that, but after years and years of exchanging massages on a quid pro quo basis, Steve was more familiar with Sam's body than he was with his own.
“I need your help. You signed the agreements. You can’t tell anyone. If anyone offers you money, no matter how much, you can’t take it. You come to me and I’ll give you more, no matter how much it is. If someone threatens you for it, you tell them lies and then you come to me and I’ll take care of it. I’ll pay you 10 times your normal rate.”
“Okay. I’ll start with your shoulders and work my way down. I think.” Steve decided. “Are you okay with that?”
“I don’t care, this is making it worse. You look like a nightmare.” Tony was torn between laughing and feeling deeply unsettled, and it showed.
Dropping his bag in the nearest seat, he rushed to hold Tony, hugging him as tightly as he could.
He opened his eyes when he felt Steve’s head pull away from his neck, and he knew Steve was looking at him, it was like he could feel his gaze, loving and familiar.
He stood and waited, watching the blood drip slow and steady into Rogers blonde hair.
“Well Ma’am. I have a client in Harlem in an hour, but I could come down right after that. Say… uhm…. 4:30?” Steve offered after consulting the clock on his phone.
Not much later in his spiral down the Tony Stark rabbit hole, Steve came across a newsreel that played the ransom video that the news stations had regurgitated on a loop for days at the time of the kidnapping. Stark’s chest was bloody, bandages wrapping crisscross around his rib cage. It was hard to see details in the grainy footage, but there was an injury to his upper front torso around his sternum. Was that what was still plaguing him now?
“Have you seen anyone about it?” Steve asked, reaching out for the man’s arm and gently leading him to sit down on the sofa with Steve. “Someone like me, or even your regular doctors?”
Something about the kiss, and Steve’s arms wrapping around him made Tony calm down. Everything would be fine, Steve would get back to normal. They’d bounced back from much stranger predicaments than this.
It had been a full two weeks since his appointment at Stark Tower when his phone rang again. Steve had saved Miss Potts’ number just in case and was glad for it when his phone rang at 7AM and he sleepily rolled over to glance at it.
“Rogers. I don’t know if you can hear me, but this is the spookiest thing I’ve ever seen, just so you know.” Tony said quietly. There was nothing he could do for the man, he could only watch and wait, still unsure what would happen if Rogers woke up. Decades in the ice could have done untold damage to his brain. He could wake up severely mentally disabled. He could be dazed, violent. There was no telling what Tony was going to face when the trembling stopped.
He did the same neck treatment for Miss Potts when she was on her back a few minutes later that he’d done for Stark too, leaving her smiling and stretching like a happy cat by the time Steve was done with her and washing up.
“That sounds even better.” Steve agreed, scooping Tony up in his arms, delighted at Tony’s laugh.
“Thank you, Miss Potts.” He said instead. “That’s amazing. Any table works, you just choose one that’s comfortable to you.” He said.
Steve’s arms felt so good around him, Tony could almost put the strange sensation that had confused his eyes and head so much out of his mind. That was, until he opened his eyes to smile at Steve happily, just to find absolutely nothing in front of him.
Tony seemed almost cowed into calming down. Steve felt for him, he really did. It was obvious the man was scared, and he wasn’t in a good enough condition to fight anyone Steve’s size. The last thing he wanted was to intimidate Tony in any way.
So what was it?
“He’s part of us now,” Harley agrees, nodding along to Maggie’s unexplained point. “The two of us have become a three.”
Tony closes his eyes. Braces. “Anything,” he promises. “Ask me anything. Ask for anything. But first, there’s something I have to add.” He opens his eyes again, catches Steve’s, smiles lopsidedly. “My kids made me promise.”
He makes sure Dad and Harley eat all of their meals. He learns how to cook with Steve so he can make Natasha her favorite cakes. He laughs way too loudly at Bruce's chemistry jokes.
(Figures Maggie would attract a literal superhero for backup. She’s got every single Avenger wrapped around her little finger already. Might as well start collecting New York City’s various Vigilantes of Questionable Motive and Character, too.)
“Harley,” Steve says slowly while Harley braces for more ‘don’t do illegal stuff like your superhero dad with whom I’m hopelessly in love’ bullshit, but what comes next is Not That. “Have you considered that Peter may not want your help? Or even if he wants it, won’t accept it?”
, he thinks glumly.
act like we’ve tracked him down. Brooklyn’s home base for me, makes sense that I’d be there.”
“What, you were perfectly fine with him sleeping in a mafia hideout?”
2. Harley
Peter is just...so painfully young. He's smart, way too smart for his own good, and he likes being smart. Steve notices he doesn't wield his genius like a weapon in the way that Tony and Harley do. Instead, Peter just likes learning. He likes maths and sciences, especially the sciences, and wants to go to school to make advances in the medical field that will save lives. He thinks reading chemistry and biology books is fun.
“It’s—” Steve’s eyes, wide with worry Tony is just starting to register, dart from Tony to carefully take in Maggie and Harley’s anxious, angry faces. Steve frowns as his gaze returns to Tony. “It’s not my place to say. You can come see him, I’ll explain everything—but I need the kids to wait here.”
Cap had a good reason for running out like he had the world to save. Tony’s sure of it.
Peter would rather die than stop being Spider-Man.
"Yeah," Maggie agrees. "He's surprisingly a huuuuuuuge nerd."
"Ew, history." Harley's nose wrinkles. "The worst subject."
“Double names, really?” Harley rolls his eyes. “And no, I did not hack the security feed. But Peter told me where he’s living when we were playing basketball the other day. His foster parents are shit and he would rather live anywhere else than with them. They don’t care as long as they get a check.”
“I’m gonna be
“—Three boys stole her art portfolio, and she tried to fight them off, and then Peter—” Harley turns, looking to introduce Peter.
So, he stays out of sight when they arrive.Peter gets leftovers by sneaking it when everyone is working on homework or in the rec room, and Captain America is nowhere to be seen. He avoids the little girl who plays with the other boys and girls her age, playing with hair and working on art and trying to organize a self defense class. Peter avoids the kid his age, with a kind smile and a protective stance when he's around his sister, and a slight wariness when it comes to Captain America. He avoids them because, if they're looking for him, there's no way it can be for anything good.
“Okay, so ground me, take my debit cards until I learn my lesson, whatever,” Harley says, not even bitterly—the hypocrisy going on here is all kinds of ridiculous, and it’s just as thick from Steve “Regularly Disregards Every Kind of Law and Authority in Search of Truth” Rogers as it is from Tony “Hacks the Nearest Database Out of Habit” Stark—but he’s on a mission. No-last-name Peter, Maggie’s Knight in Shining Armor, is Peter Parker. Peter Parker, twice-orphaned foster-care runaway. Peter Parker, star student at Midtown School of Science and Technology. Peter Parker, homeless. Peter Parker, Spider-man.
“It’s more nuanced than that, Pete,” Steve sighs, ready to defend.
“Nah, they didn’t really want to fight,” Peter says, rubbing his neck and blushing again. Harley is looking him over with that look he gets when he’s solving an engineering problem. Harley really likes engineering problems. “Anyway, I should really get going—so glad you’re okay, Maggie, keep up the art, you’re amazing—”
The kids mob him before he’s made it out of the elevator. It goes like this: a rush of giddy, squealing joy (okay, only Maggie’s loud about it, but Harley’s got that grin he always tries to hide spread all across his face). A pause of blank confusion. Dread dragging down all of Harley’s happy angles, and:
Mystery Kid turns around. “You okay? Sorry I didn’t get here sooner! I mean of course you’re not okay, no one should ever deal with that crap. But are you hurt? Anything scraped, sprained, bleeding?”
“Whoa, this is
Harley’s eyes are thin, shoulders hunching angrily, defensively. Tony sees the months of hard work Steve has put into earning Harley’s trust slipping away, just like that. “The hell happened? Dad?”
6. Maggie
“I don’t know,” Steve says miserably. “He was barely conscious when I reached him. Out cold by the time I’d brought him here. He was—Tony, he was curled up in this alleyway, shaking and—and soaked in his own blood—”
“Bullshit. No one wants to be hungry. Cold. Alone.”
” Steve says, laughing and kissing him again, his cheek, his neck. “Yes, Anthony Edward Stark, you perfect, glorious genius, yes to you and the kids and—Tony, the question I had for you—”
Peter.
“So it might take a few weeks. The key here is that we
Mystery Kid hesitates, then shakes it. “Peter Par—just Peter.”
“You know what I chose? The opposite. I lived alone, desperate and miserable, and drove Bucky mad refusing everything he tried to give me.”
“He was amazing,” Maggie gushes. “There were adults walking by and they did
“Look,” Harley pleads. “Look, this kid—he needs help. He helped us. We owe him, right? Does it really matter how many government agencies I hacked to find him?”
“...Pizza?” For a moment Peter looks like he’s going to change his mind. He sounds hungry. Actually, now that Maggie’s calmed down and really looking, he looks hungry. More than it’s-been-a-long-time-since-lunch hungry.
“Because we have to do something!” Harley throws his hands up. “He’s put on some weight since we started bringing food around, but he’s still too skinny and he’s still running around the city in pajamas, and he’s still a dummy, and we still need to help him.”
With their leader down, the sidekicks close in together,and maybe this kid really
"Trig, Brit lit, gym, and American history," Peter trails off.
“I’m okay,” Maggie whispers. At this totally ridiculous time when the bullies are gone and her art is mostly okay, while facing her handsome rescuer with his kind face and big, concerned puppy-dog eyes —she bursts out crying uncontrollably.
Tony didn’t have the heart to tell Steve he’d wanted to refund the piece and use the money at a clearance sale for kids winter clothing, and only nodded instead. “Okay. Thanks.”
for a good tip.”
Tony nearly choked when Steve shoved his face right into his ass, when the lace tore beneath Steve’s teeth and a thick pressure swirled at his hole. “F-fuck!
. “And it’s not very cold tonight, so it could be fun.”
“Pretty Omega.” the female Alpha was a solid six inches shorter than him, but she still cupped his chin and stared into his eyes as she asked, “How are you? Is our dumb friend treating you alright? Are you eating enough? Sleeping okay? I would like to see the baby, but I will wait until you’re ready to introduce him to me. Just know I have actual piles of toys in the car for him if that day ever comes.”
“You said he won’t even stay the night.”

, kept spilling, kept emptying his balls into Tony’s center and Tony cried out once, twice, put a hand to his stomach as he started to feel heavy and
“You’re a terrible human being.” Tony scrunched down further and tried to disappear. “Why are we even friends?”
“Hi sweetheart.” Steve’s cart was overflowing with absolute non-essentials, the ball pit and a children’s pool that wouldn’t be usable till the spring, an assortment of toys and what looked like the world’s biggest box of M&M’s, a dozen books, a 32 inch TV and a bluetooth speaker for Peter’s room so they could play his favorite songs from their phones.
This was a
“Okay then, I withdraw my previous question about why you aren’t
? I was definitely kidding, I can’t believe you even signed up for that thing. Let me see!”
The Alpha gave up any pretense of looking for his current target-- the dude was a scumbag today, he’d be a scumbag tomorrow, right?-- and settled into his spot across the street from the diner to watch as Tony and the other Omega Clint went through the rest of their day.
“I love you too.”
“Check on Pete and then come to bed with me? Stay the night with me?” Steve scarcely dared

but they were still technically strangers and this was still a sugar daddy arrangement so--
He stopped when Tony’s mouth opened in surprise. “--annnd there I go saying dumb stuff again, right? Let me try and start over.”
“You coming back to bed, Tony?” The Alpha caught a break in Pete’s non stop chatter and held out his hand for him. “Come over here and hear about his dreams. They were
“That seems very enthusiastic for a dish washing kiss.” The Omega giggled and wiped the suds off his nose. “What was that for?”
“Okay.” The Omega hesitated now. “Okay well if we’re being

on the other side of the phone, as if the reassurance of Steve caring was enough to make him melt. “I’m okay. Honest. The uh-- the text was a work emergency but it turned out okay. I just got sick and I’ve been sleeping a lot and trying to rest.”
about the Brooklyn apartment so when Steve got an odd text one day on his way home from a three day mission, he was understandably mystified.
. “Still good?”
“You’re not having a good time, are you?” The Alpha said suddenly, and Tony jerked himself back to the conversation.
“When Dad told me to get rid of the baby, I chose Peter.” the Omega set his water bottle down and clasped his hands together tight, anxious. “And I had no idea just how hard the world was for single Omega parents. I had no idea. The Sugar app was a last resort, I didn’t know how much longer I’d be able to keep my job with having to take so many days off when Pete got sick over the winter and I needed a back up plan.”
. Maybe if Steve was just looking to get laid those sort of photos would have appealed to him, but he wanted company and he wanted a friend and someone to spend real time with and maybe it was wrong and judgmental of him… but the Alpha didn’t think he’d find that particular person beneath the username
“Come here.” Steve discretely worked the condom off his still sensitive length and tucked it into the ruined scraps of Tony’s panties, pulled his pants up enough to cover himself then picked Tony right up off the floor. He stood in one easy motion and cradled the Omega blanket and all up to his chest bridal style. “I know it’s barely ten o’clock, but I’d rather lay in bed and talk half the night than sit down here half dressed. That okay?”
“Yes,” Steve said.
“I don’t know what happened,” Bruce says, shaking his head. “The dynamometer in my lab registered a massive energy surge so I came to have a look. I walked in here and he was just...like that.”
“Those are physical. Mentally, how are you doing?”
Four armor piercing bullets had shredded Tony’s insides, perforating a liver, tearing his spleen apart, and grazing one of his kidneys. The fall out of the sky had shattered a few ribs, bruised his back and caused several hematomas. Peter had been there to see all of it.
“Mr. Stark?”
“I don’t have to,” Steve says. “You already know it needs to happen Tony. You just have to say yes.”
“Auxiliary power kicked in,” he mumbles but Steve ignores him, fingers fumbling for a way to stop the bleeding.
“You’re really good at all this stuff. The clothes, the toys. Just being with him.”
“I literally have no idea what you’re talking about right now.”
They linger through dinner, though it’s obvious fatigue has sent in for everyone. Steve’s shoulders slump a little too much, and he shifts uncomfortably in his seat again and again. When Tony accidentally catches his eye, Steve turns away quickly, flexing his jaw like he’s swallowing a grimace of pain. No one protests when Steve excuses himself after the last plate has been cleared.
“Oh good lord.” Steve rushes over first and grabs Peter by the waist with one hand, giving his little bottom a boost with the other. With Steve supporting him, Peter puts arm over arm, face screwed up in concentration until he makes it across. He turns around and does it again and again, until finally, he jumps off and runs to Tony, hugging him around the legs.
Tony leans against the dining table, meeting Steve’s eye. “I stayed here. I stayed here and let you and Peter run the rescue.”
The team takes to having a child around not just seamlessly, but with barely concealed joy. There’s anxiety sure —Peter not being Peter is cause for concern—but the four-year-old version of Peter is too cute to resist. After Sam’s done hurling him up in the air, Tony gets him dressed and ready for Natasha to take him down to the simulation room.
“Oh.”
“It didn’t bother me the she was flirting with you,” Tony said after they’d polished off the pizza and he'd brushed the crumbs off his hands. “Well, it wasn’t the only thing.”
“You hungry, kiddo?” Tony asks. Peter nods against his chest. He could have the kitchen send something up, but he rips open of a box of macaroni and cheese instead.
“We don’t know anything. We don’t know why this happened, what his body’s going through. He’s my responsibility, Steve. I’m not sticking the kid into a goddamn quantum tunnel on a whim.”
In the dusk, Steve’s jaw jumps just a little.
Tony bits his tongue, stops himself from saying the hundred, dirty, filthy things that want to come pouring out of his mouth right now, like how he wants to keep Steve like this forever, on the edge of coming, his mouth so open and wet that all he can imagine is pushing his own dick inside.
“It’s no one’s fault.” Steve holds his gaze, but there’s a waver in his voice. “It’s part of the gig, right?”
In his mind, Tony had always imagined that Steve slept ramrod straight -- on his back, hands folded across his chest -- as if he were still encased in ice.  He watched as Steve turned away from him, his body curling into itself. He looked so defenseless Tony felt a sudden, wild urge to stay up all night and stand guard.
They fly back in silence, until it’s time to land. Sam slaps him on the back, and Natasha gives Rhody a squeeze, and they school their expressions into neutrality as they step off the plane, trying to forgot what they’ve seen.
“I had the staff come in and put it all in storage,” Steve says, leaning in the doorway.
“No.” Tony slams his palm against the table, making them all jump. Even Peter looks up from his coloring. “No. Figure something else out. We’re not sticking him in that god damn unstable environment. It’s too risky.”
“Baby,” Tony says softly, and Steve practically sobs, frustrated and desperate. “Come for me,” he says and Steve leans up and smashes their mouths together, almost in pain.
“Yes,” Steve says, rubbing his eyes. “As a warning, never let him drink an entire can of soda.”
When Peter finally looks up, only Tony is still staring at him from the balcony.
“Always,” Tony said. He reached up, straightened Steve’s tie, and led them out to meet the rest of the world.
“Can we have pizza for dinner? Cheese and pepperoni?”
“Where the hell are you going?” Tony balks at being the only adult in the room, but Steve doesn’t answer, just gives him a little wave on his way out.
The entire thing took 10 minutes, maybe less.
Tony tries to commit every moment of the day to memory, from the thunder of Peter’s feet across the floor, to the way his hair constantly falls into his eyes, to the distinct way he has of screwing up his mouth when he brushes his teeth. There are hints of the 17-year-old in everything he does and Tony can’t separate the two in his mind. This is his Peter, the one he’s always loved unconditionally, so he blocks any thoughts of the next day from his mind. For once, he does what every therapist he’s seen has suggested, and stays in the moment. At the playground, he keeps his mind on the bright sound of Peter laughing as Steve pushes him on the swing. During lunch, he watches tiny hands grip a grilled cheese, and thinks of nothing else. When Peter doesn’t want to nap, Tony lies down next to him, and they take turns naming the planets that he has FRIDAY project on the wall.
Steve took it, stood and removed the rest of his clothing. He shrugged off his shirt, stepped out of his pants, fully naked before them for the first time. Until now, all his sexual encounters, all three of them, had been quick, furtive attempts under bed sheets and the cover of darkness. Now, he stood up straight, unable to hide, and tried not to blush as Tony gazed up at him, trailing his fingers along the backs of his thigh, placing a kiss in the hollow of his knee.
“Yeah, keep going.”
A drawn out, “Steve, fuck,” is all Tony manages before the first spurt of come hits Steve’s face, dripping along his cheeks and jawline. Still fisting himself rapidly, head thrown back and eyes closed, Tony spills all over Steve, marking his face and chest. Rendered speechless for once, Tony twitches weakly as Steve takes a few experimental tastes of his spent cock.
Steve waits a beat before answering. “Yeah. It did.”
“You took down the Latvian ambassador because she talked to him for too long.”
May nods and pushes back her chair. She picks up a startled Peter and squeezes him tightly, kissing his face and hair. “I love you very much, you know that right Peter?”
Keeping some space between them, Tony brushes the fingers of his other hand along Steve’s abdomen and cups his erection through the towel. Steve lets out a soft exhale at the touch, a good sign that Tony takes as permission to keep going. Tony rubs him slowly through the thick cotton, waiting to see if Steve tenses up again, or if he decides to pull away and end this right now. When he doesn’t, Tony reaches through the gap in towel, touching soft, hot skin. He strokes him lightly with this fingers, teasing or soothing he’s not sure which, before pulling away again.
To his surprise, Stark made no move to leave the room, having wandered from the massage table to the sofa where he seemed to melt into the cushions with a visible sense of relief.
“You don’t have to. This is time for you and your body. We’ll only do stuff that feels good.” Steve replied easily.
“It’s alright, you can let go, sweetheart. There’s a million more where this comes from.” He assured Tony, trying to coax him into letting go, into trusting Steve to keep him. He loved that Tony tried so savor the special moments, but sometimes he did it so frantically like they might be his last ones. Steve could feel this was one of them.
The mansion, so Tony had told him last night, had been finished this week.
“Can we set up a standing appointment?” She asked after a few minutes. “Tony, then me. My schedule is a little unpredictable, but I’m usually home at this time of night.”
“We can definitely do that.” Steve promised turning around when she stopped moving and finding her perfectly ready for him. She knew the drill.
“Certainly. Hold on, let me just pull up my calendar.” Steve said, pulling his phone away from his face to open the app. The calendar was barely open in front of him before she started telling him her availability and he scrambled to keep up with her.
The military’s attempt to capture a failed supersoldier serum experiment at Culver University was legendary. What lengths would they go to in order to try and claim the real deal.
Tony’s breath came out in a shuddering staccato as he tried to get himself under control. Steve could feel him willing himself to believe what Steve was saying. He didn’t move, didn’t say another word.
Tony’s stomach dropped and it took a few moments for his mind to catch up with his body’s instinct of dread. There was blood oozing from the wound the torn skin had created on his scalp. Slow and sluggish.
“Sure thing, I’d be happy to.” Steve assured her. “We can set up a three-hour time slot, and you two can just let me know how you want to split it?” He suggested, starting on her other foot.
“Steve, was it?” The man sat down, facing Steve.
“There.” Stark gasped when Steve dug his fingers into the occipital region where the skull met the neck, a common point of pain for anyone leaning forward too much, like Stark was doing. “You got it.” Steve smiled, massaging out the tension there. “If you want to lay down on your back later, I can work these muscles over more.” He offered but didn’t push for it, and Stark didn’t respond.
No wonder Tony had dreamt of this place.
“Right, animal instinct.”
“Hi Miss Potts.” Steve smiled, draping a towel over Tony that covered him up to his midriff.
The rest of the night was a blur.
He was given the all-clear and one of the guys asked Steve to follow him. He thanked the receptionist and stepped into a small elevator with the man. A minute later, the double doors opened into a gorgeous apartment. It was probably the single nicest place Steve had ever seen. Beautiful, but comfortable. The living area he was facing had floor to ceiling windows out into the city. The sofa was so large and cosy-looking, Steve wanted to faceplant into it.
Stark nodded, drinking the water slowly as he continued to watch Steve.
When he received the call about it, Tony thought it was a prank.
He loved the way Sam almost deflated after that. The worst of the tension was gone, the rest of the work was just for pleasure and maintenance now.
“That’s it, don’t stop now.” Tony coaxed, pressing a kiss to Steve’s temple, his arms wrapped tight around his husband.
Unlike Stark, Miss Potts had all the patterns of a desk-worker, just like she said. She was a fit woman, but no amount of yoga or pilates could completely keep the pains of too many hours in a high-pressure job at bay.
“You said take it off!” Steve reminded him, both exasperated and amused as he dropped his pants to the ground as well.
“Oh fuck…” Tony said softly, standing up and getting closer. There, in Rogers’ temple was the slightest of twitches mirrored in his cheek. Then the trembling started, and Tony realized some ancient self-warming mechanism was being triggered, even though the man was firmly unconscious. Tony brought the heaters closer, uncertain of what else he could do. The rest of the ice cracked, and Tony pulled and tore it off the legs of Rogers’ uniform until the man lay trembling on the slab he didn’t belong on.
Much like Steve, Tony was a city boy at heart, but with a life like his, Steve wasn’t surprised Tony missed his oasis of calm.
“This is a bit of a reach, but if you can hear me at all, make some sort of sound, will you?”
It was why, when Tony asked to pick Steve up in DC on his route back from London, Steve had agreed immediately. It was why, when Tony had asked Steve to tell SHIELD he was taking a week off, he hadn’t even questioned it. He’d said yes, wholehearted, and agreeable. Whatever Tony had planned, Steve understood that he needed it. He got in the car Tony sent, he carried his bag onto the airfield and onto the private plane Tony was waiting on.
“Right, thank you, Ma-Miss Potts. I’ll be there.” Steve promised. The line went dead and Steve stared at his phone for a moment before putting it back into his pocket and lugging his massage table down into the subway system.
“I know. I can’t wait to see this.” Steve agreed, moaning when Tony sunk his hand into his hair to pull him up into a kiss. He closed his eyes, when he couldn’t see anything, Steve felt so much closer than the open and empty room he saw with his eyes open.
Steve had heard Tony reminisce about how beautiful and peaceful the place was, how much he missed the beach and the sunshine, the quiet and the sea breeze countless times.
“Tony, I don’t want you to do that, especially not because you’re scared. I’m not going to do anything that you don’t want me to do.” He repeated. “That includes tattling your business to other interested parties, no matter what they put on the table.” He assured him. “Your body and everything we do here, that’s not up for discussion or sale with anyone else. I promise. I wouldn’t.” Steve told him softly, holding the man’s gaze. “Please tell me what’s hurting you so I can help you properly.” He said, having long understood that he wasn’t given insight into the true root of all that ailed Tony.
“You’re amazing.” Tony corrected, leaning up to kiss him.
“It’s all good, you’ll see. The war’s over. You’re coming home with me.” Tony promised.
“Jeez-“ He startled, closing his eyes and resting his forehead on Steve’s collar. “Sorry, this is just so weird.” He explained.
“You can set up here.” The security guard told Steve, indicating a wide-open area between the cocktail bar and the sofa area that was set low into the ground a few steps down.
“Good morning to me.” Tony mumbled sleepily and Steve looked up to see him, smiling with his eyes closed, like a happy cat napping in the sunshine.
“You make that man of yours call me sometime next week though.” He joked. Bucky had been busy, properly busy the past two weeks. Steve missed him, but he couldn’t deny how much of a difference that new job at Stark Industries made to Bucky’s self esteem and happiness. He was actually glowing with it. Steve wished he could ask Bucky what he knew about Tony, not that Bucky was likely to have met him.
“I think that’s a wonderful idea.” Steve said. “Any chance there’s room for me?” He asked, understanding that this was exactly what Tony was offering.
The morning sun was shining onto the bed now, soaking Tony’s skin in warm sunlight. They’d left the glass doors that led onto the terrace wide open last night. Steve could feel the warm breeze coming in, shifting the thin white curtains out of the way beautifully and giving him a perfect view of the endless ocean beyond the terrace.
With his hands on the man’s shoulders from behind, he used his thumb to create a little leverage to make him sit up a little straighter. He could feel the man exhale somewhat sharply. That wasn’t easy for him then.
Steve packed up the table, feeling a pang of sadness to be leaving that he didn’t quite understand.
Steve remembered press pictures from a while ago, Tony Stark had been a vibrant man, tan and extroverted with a big smile on his face; a man who spent time in the sun with pretty girls or boys hanging off his arm. He couldn’t see that man in front of him now.
Tony wondered if he’d been aware of being alone in the cold on some level. He wondered what that would do to a person. He rested his hand on the man’s forehead, smoothing out the lines with his thumb. “You’re okay, just take it easy.” Tony kept assuring him.
“But I can’t just walk around naked, Tony. I’ll get cold.” Steve protested.
“How about we go swim instead?” Tony suggested. “The water looks amazing.”
No one actually expected to find Captain America.
“Sir, with all due respect, I’m already here now. I’d be happy to help you with anything at all.” It was abundantly clear from his slouch that the man was in pain. There was something tense about him. Steve could tell from his posture that it had once been good, but Stark now found it hard to hold himself up straight. It had only been a year or so since his temporary disappearance, but the time had aged him rapidly. There was grey in his hair and his skin looked pasty in a way that spoke of a life lived inside.
“Would you like me to cover your eyes- “
Discretion was important to Stark though; Steve was sure of that. Otherwise, Steve was sure, it would have been some PA and not Miss Potts herself calling Steve for his services.
The sight that greeted Steve under the man’s shirt was almost indescribable. He didn’t know what on earth he was looking at. A round metal device was inset in Tony’s chest, raised only slightly out of his scarred skin. Steve understood what he’d seen last week, the slightly odd shape under Tony’s shirt. It was covered in duct tape, which made the entirety of his chest look like a massacre. The skin around the device was scarred deeply, still red in a way that often happened in skin that was moved around a lot during the healing process. This wasn’t a section of the skin that ever really stopped moving, Tony was breathing, that was enough to keep it red and irritated. No matter how Tony’s muscles were attached to or under it, there was simply no way they weren’t being pulled at by this device constantly. Steve wondered how far in it went. He wondered if Tony’s ribs were connected to it or floating against it. Tony had said he didn’t have a sternum, did that mean it filled that entire space above his heart?
“God please don’t be alive…” It was an unkind thing to think, but Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for all the implications a living Captain America from the 1940s would have.
He started to work on the muscles in Stark’s shoulders, working through his shirt and house coat, not using too much pressure, feeling his way around the man’s reactions. He knew he was getting it right when Stark leaned back into his touch ever so slightly, seeking out more pressure subconsciously. Steve adjusted his touch and started really working on his shoulders and neck.
He smiled when Tony took him up on the offer. Cool hands encircled Steve’s wrists, firm but not squeezing as Steve set to work feeling around the device, pressing only ever so slightly to get a feel for how the muscles were running, identifying knots and tight areas. What he learned over the next couple of minutes was that Tony’s entire chest needed work, and that it was probably going to hurt no matter how tender Steve was with him.
He worked across the man’s collar and out into the top of his arms. There was a good amount of tension there, muscles coiling too hard. Steve would bet he slept curled up on his side, protectively shielding his chest on instinct. He felt the man’s breathing pick up as he followed the muscles from collar to the center of his chest, not quite touching the device, but getting close to it.
Tony nodded, looking up at him. Steve couldn’t look away from the man’s eyes now that he had a chance to look. They were very expressive. Tony was an incredibly handsome man, even with months of neglect.
“Gonna fuck you till you get hard again,” Tony says. He moves inside Steve with slow, deliberate thrusts, each one aiming at and hitting his prostrate, until Steve’s hands are grasping at his waist, whether to urge him on or slow him down, he can’t really tell.  All of it is too much, his body already sensitive and overwhelmed, but he reaches up for Tony anyway, crushing their mouths together as Tony worms a hand between their bodies. He takes Steve in his hand and begins to stroke him. “That good, baby?” he whispers into Steve’s mouth, thumb flicking over the head. Steve should say
Natasha had been right, everybody needs practice, he just didn’t think she would tell Stark about it.  Why had he even said yes when Stark had delicately but deliberately floated the idea?
“Actually, it doesn’t work that way,” Tony said. He walked quickly to keep up with Steve’s pissed off pace. “Technically, we’re here as liaisons. They can kick us out, yes, but disbarring, that’s not really…”
“Can you read to me?” He thrusts a book at Steve who examines it with mock seriousness.
Tony balked.  “I...What? It didn’t. That’s not why…”
Tony sighs and twines their fingers together, careful not to squeeze Steve’s bandaged hand too tightly.
“Tony, we have to make a call.”
Tony’s never been a kid person, hasn’t —well, not until recently anyway—felt any kind of paternal stirring or need. Now though, he looks at Peter’s little legs and lopsided ears, and affection wars with a sense of panic. He’s about to ask FRIDAY to look up the best nannies in New York when Steve pushes through the door, hands full of shopping bags.
“Captain Rogers!” His voice booms across the room. He shakes Steve’s hand vigorously, congratulating him on his escape like Steve just won some kind of Ninja Warrior challenge. “Never a doubt you could do it, Captain.”
It hasn’t actually occured to Tony to ask. What Steve remembers and what he decides to share are likely two different things. For all the boundaries he’s already violating, prying along that particular road seems a step too far.
“What does that word mean?”
“Hi,” he managed.
“I should go,” Tony says. He heaves himself off the sofa with great effort, draping a blanket over Steve before heading back to his own room.
“They’re not hookers Rogers, they’re escorts. Or sex workers. Things have changed, there’s no shame in it. No one is under duress,” he said. “Just take the edge off a bit, get some practice. See what you like.”
Tony dims the lights, slips off his shoes and props himself up next to Peter, who immediately snuggles into his side. They read Where the Wild Things Are, Tony’s voice dropping naturally into the rhythm of the words. Peter’s attention is rapt and he giggles when Tony uses his monster voice and there’s a soft blossoming of warmth inside his chest, unlike anything Tony’s ever experienced before. Tony knows about love, has fallen in and out of it a few times in his life, but this is something deeper, something unswayable. He’s always been protective of Peter, felt admiration and pride at watching him grow, but feeling the soft rise and fall of his chest so close to him makes his heart ache in a different way. Makes him wonder how anything he’s ever done for Peter could be enough.
“I like my drawing very much, Peter. Thank you.”
Steve grunts, his eyes slipping shut as Tony cards his fingers lightly through the back of his hair.
Pulling away, Kara traced the tips of her fingers across Steve’s mouth, rocking against his thigh slightly.  “Not a bad start,” she said, looking over his heaving chest, taking in the slight perspiration that had broken out along his temple. There was a high flush climbing up his chest, working its way up to his cheeks. He already looked debauched, lying there with his shirt unbuttoned, hair askew and the outline of his cock visible in his pants.
“I know that’s the trade off here, with what we do. But watching you both—” He has to stop and clear the emotion from his throat. “Watching you both struggle to breathe was not an experience I care to relieve ever again.”
In his head, Tony’s already retreating back into his work, mentally running over the notes Hope and Bruce have sent him. He hugs May goodbye and turns back to his desk, so focused on trying to solve the problem at hand he’s almost startled to see Peter staring up at him.
Tony scoffs, is about to tell Ross to go fuck himself, when he sees the look on Natasha’s face. It’s clear she’s already conveyed the message.
“This is gonna feel good, Rogers,” he said before swallowing him down.  Steve had snapped his hips in surprise, fingers immediately winding through Tony’s hair.  Tony sucked him off quickly, pumping his hand along the base of Steve’s dick while the head hit the back of his throat. Steve came with a series of choked groans, his come flooding Tony’s mouth.  Tony swallowed what he could, let the rest drip obscenely out of his mouth. After, he crawled up Steve’s chest and kissed him again, making it wet and messy, so there was no mistaking what they’d just done.
“Among other things,” Tony said, angling his eyes directly at Steve’s crotch.
“A little. He’s a tough kid, Tony, he can take a lot.”
“Let’s go to bed, alright?” he tries. When Steve still doesn’t move, Tony tugs just a little at his elbow and nudges him towards the bathroom. “Shower first, OK. You gotta rest.” He rustles up some clean underwear, sweats and a t-shirt and leaves them by the sink while Steve rinses off. He doesn’t linger, but his eyes drift to the shower stall, where Steve is standing, shoulders slumped under the hot water. It would be erotic, almost, if everything about didn’t radiate sadness.
The serum had changed everything, and somewhere along the line, he had become serious and taciturn, saying only what needed to be said. It was born out of necessity he thought.  If the Army had taught him anything, it was that the less you spoke, the more men respected you.
“It’ll work,” he says, so sweetly, so sincerely, that Tony almost kisses him right then. Not because he believes Steve but because Steve so clearly, desperately also wants to believe it.
“How are you feeling?” Tony asks.
The thought pops in his head as he exits the training simulation for the day, and Peter races by him towards Tony. He catches both their reflections in the glass, his face the exact opposite of Peter’s wide, effusive one. From the corner of his eye, he watches as Tony places both hands on Peter’s shoulders and gives him a fond, enthusiastic shake.
Tony nods, eyes frozen where Peter should be. “Come on, come on, come on….”
“It’s not cute,” Tony mumbled. “It’s a professional courtesy. This way I don’t get stuck next to the ambassador from England and he doesn’t have to make small talk with the French attorney general. I’m just preventing social awkwardness.”
“Steve,” he called. “It’s me. Let me in, please.”
“It’s too risky. No way.” Tony dismisses the idea out of hand, his jaw tightening.
“See, that’s better, right?”  Putting down the drink, Tony kept a minimum of space between them and moved his hand back to Steve’s shoulder, kneading out some of the tension. His fingers were firm but light, rubbing slow circles along the back of Steve’s neck, trailing his fingers through the short hair at his nape.  It was nice, Steve had to admit.
He doesn’t add that they have staff to run errands, that stores do online delivery and feels a rush of fondness, imagining Steve picking between colors and sizes, his brow furrowed, considering seriously if Peter would prefer dinosaurs over jungle animals and in the end just getting both.
He was dressed to go out, his daytime suit replaced with dark slacks and a cream button down shirt with just one too many buttons open.  If he was surprised to see Tony squatting in a room that wasn’t his, he didn’t show it. “Did you get kicked out?” he asked. “I had you getting kicked out the first night, honestly. Nat has you getting kicked out on night two.”
He sounds serious, like whatever he wants to say has been weighing on his mind for some time. Tony catches Steve eye, who just shrugs.
“It’s alright,” Tony cuts him off, and clears his own throat. He’s not interested in making Peter feel any worse than he already does. He keeps an arm around Peter’s shoulder and settles them onto the couch, body sagging into the cushions. He’s been standing for too long, but he waves away Peter’s worried look.
“I know,” he says, voice muffled against the side of Tony’s chest. He digs his fingers into the fabric of Tony’s shirt, trembling just a little. Tony curls his fingers through Peter’s hair, holding him back just as tightly.
For a second, he thinks Steve will fight him on it, but he obeys, settling face down on the bed. He turns his head to the side, arms curving around his pillow. Tony pulls the thin sheet down a little lower, just past the low curve of his hips, so it exposes Steve’s lower back.
“Captain Rogers to see you sir,” FRIDAY announced.
As the sun sets though, his mood starts to falter, the nearness of tomorrow more of a reality.
“That all?”
Tony kicked off his shoes and made himself comfortable as Peter recounted his day. The depth of Peter’s excitement and the genuine awe with which he experienced the world never ceased to amaze him. He let Peter’s voice wash over him, his effusiveness crumbling away some of his sour mood.
“It’s OK, I got it,” Steve says. As they leave, Peter places his feet on top of Steve’s and grabs hold of his outstretched hands. Steve does a Frankenstein walk, his legs moving stiffly out of the lab while Peter giggles uncontrollably.
“You almost died,” Steve said, burying his nose in the short hairs at the nape of Tony’s neck.
He looks at Peter, bent over the desk Steve put together, concentrating on a drawing of some kind, his brow furrowed in a distinctly Peter-like expression.
This is what Pepper had tried to get him to understand and he had failed her over and over again. He squeezes the back of Peter’s neck, makes himself promise that he won’t make that same mistake again.  “OK,” he says again and squeezes Peter, quick and firm, before releasing him.
“Something like this...it shouldn’t be possible. Not really.” Bruce runs a hand through his hair, mouth still agape.
“I’m not mad that you got hurt,” he says, voice shaking. “I’m mad you didn’t follow orders. You don’t care if you get hurt.”
“You’re being an idiot.” Steve snapped at him again, his shoulders bunched up around his ears.
“I know.” He keeps his eyes fixed on Peter, who’s making his way across the monkey bars. “Do you dream about Manila?”
Steve captured his mouth and pushed his tongue along the flat of Tony’s mouth until he was desperate for air. “Do it,” he said. He twined his fingers together with Tony’s and let Tony set the pace for what he liked. “Cover me with it,” he gasped into Tony’s mouth. “Go ahead, mark me.” Tony groaned at the need in Steve’s voice, the way he didn’t pull back or away from Tony and everything he wanted, but leaned into it, as desperate as he was.  Tony stroked himself harder and faster, while Steve brushed his thumb in a circle over the wet head, whispering filthy things in his ear. ” He bit along Tony’s neck and Tony came with a sharp cry of pleasure, smearing wetness across both their clothes.
“Pizza, huh?” He chuckles into Peter’s hair, relieved. “I think kids need to eat a vegetable every now and then, but yeah, I think that’s possible.”
“All you have to do is stand here, nothing else.”
“I’m fine,” Steve says. His voice is slightly horse. Tony can just make out dark thumb prints at the bottom of his throat, as if he’s been choaked. A bruised trachea, then.
It would be comical, the world’s greatest super solider popping boners in public, but there’s no humor in the look Steve gives him. He looks so uncomfortable and scared that Tony ushers him down the hall into his own office. It’s larger than Steve’s, with blackout shades and a very secure lock.
“Peter, what else do you remember?”
Tony stays till he’s asleep, and stares too long at the broken, bruised body in front of him. His own exhaustion is catching up to him, but it’s not time to rest, not yet. They still have work to do.
“Can we have pizza for dinner?” Peter asks. “Maybe one kind that’s just cheese and one with pepperoni?”
“Tony—” Steve turns to him.
“Tony, it’s fine.” Steve’s voice is placid and calm, and it sets Tony teeth on edge even more. Everything from last night is still too fresh in his mind, and he’s not willing to watch Steve slit open a vein just to appease the bureaucratic process.
She smiled, dipped her head and began to kiss the underside of his jaw until Steve gasped and pulled back. She let out a light laugh and crossed one of her legs over Steve’s thigh.
Still drowsy from his nap, Peter parks himself in Tony’s lap, chewing on the ear of the bear Steve managed to dig up.
“None of this is personal, Steve,” Fury says before he throws the first image on the screen.
Steve shakes his head. “I was.” He rests his elbows on his knees, head buried in his hands. “I tried to take care of this,” his eyes drop to his crotch, ”by myself. Thought that after last night, maybe it would help if I could be in this bed but…” he trails off, sounding frustrated and ashamed.
There was no arguing back. Sam was right and Tony knew it.
“Physically, he’s mostly healed.” Bruce keeps his eyes locked on Steve, but there’s sympathy in his voice. “Otherwise...you’d have to ask him.”
Tony’s still staring at him, and he knows he looks ruined. His mouth a red, wet mess, his body covered in come. Reaching down, Tony traces the outline of his mouth with the fingers of one hand while the other unbuttons his pants.
Tony’s not one to linger in bed, but he knows this chance may not come again. He knows he won’t get back to sleep and for once he’s glad of it. He curls tighter around Steve, burying his face in the back of his neck, counting his own breaths until Steve finally starts to stir.
“You should let me help with that,” Steve says, putting a hand on the inside of Tony’s thigh. Tony’s own erection is pushing uncomfortably against his zipper.
“No.” Steve cuts him off sharply, shaking his head. “That’s not it,” he says softer. “I can’t remember details, or anything really, but I can feel things in my body. That’s not what it feels like. Nothing in my body feels right, but it’s not that.”
For once, he doesn’t run when Tony walks in, just scrubs his hand through his shower damp hair, and stares at his feet.
“Tony.” He sounds surprised but doesn’t say stop, so Tony does it several times over, till Steve’s breathing faster.
Steve sat heavily on the couch, still apprehensive and anxious. He’d been more relaxed on missions to take down Hydra.  This was ridiculous he kept telling himself. He had no idea how Tony had actually talked him into coming along. Yes, he was kind of lonely, yes, sex would be nice, but he wanted a connection, someone he trusted, someone he...if not loved, then someone he knew for longer than 15 minutes.
“Same deal as last time, ok? Tell me to stop and I will.” He makes out a slight nod, but asks Steve to say it out loud.
He doesn’t ask if it feels good yet, knows Steve’s body is sending him so many mixed up signals he’s not sure what he’s feeling. It’s a good sign though, that he relaxes deeper into the mattress, legs falling open slightly.
“God, Tony, just hurry up” Steve gasps, pusing his hips into Tony’s hands, desperate for more friction.
Bruce advances the video a few frames and the glow around Scott’s van gets larger.
They exchange a look, expecting the Hulk maybe, or a gamma experiment gone wrong, but what they see hardly justifies the sprint they just made. Bruce is standing, hands on his hips, in a far corner of the room used mostly for storage. A few feet away, a little boy stares up at him.
Steve’s hand circles his waist, brushing the bare skin where his t-shirt has ridden up. His fingers trail up, to the compression bandage keeping Tony’s ribs in place.
“That’s it,” Tony says, kissing down his body, rubbing his own erection against Steve’s busy knuckles. “You’re doing so good Steve,” he whispers as Steve’s begins to jerk himself harder and faster, the head of his dick hitting Tony’s stomach with a perfect little sting.
Tony ignores him and moves closer, wondering if Steve’s had a panic attack, maybe been felled by a resurfaced memory. He stops short though, surprised, when he sees the erection tenting Steve’s towel.
“I do not, actually, know what the fuck you’re talking about,” Tony said, even though he knew exactly what Sam was talking about.
“What’s the damage?” Steve reaches up, swipes his thumb across the deep cut on Tony’s cheek.
“He’s not ready,” Tony protests but Natasha shakes her head in resignation. “That’s not up to you to decide,” she says.
There are a lot of places to disappear to in the compound, but it doesn’t take Tony very long to find him. Peter’s not hiding in a lab, or sulking in his room, he’s slouched on the sofa in Tony’s living room, waiting to be found.
“You really love making fires don’t you.”  Tony took a deep breath, and yawned and stretched, trying to wake himself up more fully.
There’s warm wetness pooling around his back, the tackiness of blood gluing his t-shirt to his skin. Considering he’d taken heavy fire and crash landed from a few thousand feet, he’s surprised to be alive at all.
Sam did a little fist pump and pretended to tick off a box. “That’s me and the kid. We took the under on that one.”
“Good,” Tony says. He brushes his thumb over Steve’s knuckles, which are still red and swollen.   “It’s creepy to have you watch me while I sleep.”
As Steve circled and kissed her pussy, thrusting his tongue inside her, Tony caressed her clit, both of them achieving a subtle harmony of sexual affection that made her snap her hips up into Steve’s mouth.
“He can’t watch TV all day, Tony. He’ll rot his brain.”
I would be fine if this is all there was, he thought, letting his eyes drift close. Just the two of them in a dimly lit room, sitting close together on a sofa.  As much as he had rejected the idea before, he craved the hint of closeness Tony was offering him now.
An hour later, Tony’s pacing around the small confines of Bruce’s office. “I’m telling you, Steve doesn’t remember anything. You’re not going to get anything out of harassing him.”
“Baby,” Tony whispers, petting his face, watching the spill of white. His breathing is harsh and ragged, his eyes rough and watery and he buries his face in Tony’s neck, body heaving with effort. “It’s ok,” Tony says, their hips still rocking together, slick with come and sweat. Steve finds his mouth and kisses him again, this time more desperate than before, his sticky fingers digging into Tony’s side, great swallows of air ejecting from his lungs.
From the window, Tony watches as Dr. Cho and Bruce rush onto the jet as the gangplank drops. On their orders, he is supposed to stay away--to give Steve some semblance of privacy--but the distance is more than he can take. He stands up from his desk and races across two floors and down three flights of stairs to the medical wing. He’s slightly out of breath when he arrives, just in time to see Bruce and Helen calmly wheel Steve into an exam room, the doors sliding shut behind them.
“He’s just gonna take the Iron Man suit out for a spin, Peter. He’ll be back soon.”
Tony shook his head before realizing Steve couldn’t see him. “No, no that wasn’t” he said, heart sinking a little as Steve gathered up his clothes. From his bed, he watched Steve pull on his underwear and pants, hunt around for his shirt.  “You know you can stay here,” Tony offered but Steve shook his head.
“Do you think he needs a stuffed animal? I used to have a bear I couldn’t sleep without,” he muses absently as Steve move around, pushing chairs in, placing empty glasses and dishes in the sink, until he can’t find anything else to tidy up. He leans against the sink, waiting for Tony to break the silence.
“Not really.”
Tony kisses him again, losing himself a little inside the soft palette of Steve’s mouth, before finally pulling away. Steve brushes his fingers up Tony’s back, across his side, before letting them drop.
Tony’s heart sank. “Where is he?”
Spider-Man is formidable in his own right, but Peter doesn’t have arch enemies quite yet. They toss out theories while SpongeBob SquarePants blares in the background. Peter’s eyes are practically glazed over by the time Natasha and Sam come back with Scott Lang and Hope. Tony knows a hell of a lot about a lot of things, but she’s the expert in the quantum realm and he’s grateful to have her. Scott, it turns out, is the best with kids.
“Definitely sounds like you got kicked out.” Natasha appeared behind Sam, dressed in a fitted black jumpsuit. She looked stunning. Whatever she and Sam were doing, it involved more than video games and pizza.  “You ready?” She offered Sam her arm.
. He settles for a curt nod and they go their separate ways.
Peter nods, but he keeps one hand curled tightly around Tony’s fingers, so Tony stays with him, running his free hand through Peter’s hair until his breath evens out and his grip goes slack.
Steve shakes his head, embarrassment mixing with something like defeat. Motivated more by empathy than desire, Tony takes a chance and stands right behind him. Close, but not touching.
Like a creeper, he stations himself outside the locker room door. Peter practically slams into him as he exits.
“Of course I care,” Tony says quietly but Peter’s too angry to listen.
“His place in D.C. I think. Said he needed some space.”
“Want me to take the jet? Check it out?” Steve’s already getting up, wiping his hands.
“Lie down,” he says and tugs Steve’s briefs off. Steve rolls onto his stomach like the last time, hands wrapped around a pillow. He waits patiently as Tony strips down to his shorts again, and pulls a bottle of clear liquid from the nightstand.
Tony thinks back to Steve’s easy smile from this morning, how, after days of strain, he’s starting to loosen, just a little. He doesn’t want to know what the full SHIELD debrief will do to him.
“Looks like I won that bet. I knew you wouldn’t make it all four nights.” She kept talking when he didn’t answer. “I guess I should say thanks for leaving us the plane. At least we had a way to get back home.”
“OK,” Steve says. He keeps his eyes on Tony, hasn’t flinched at all as Tony turns onto his side, sweeping his fingers in a half-arc across Steve’s chest. For a while, he doesn’t do much more than that, letting one hand idly explore Steve’s body. He keeps his touches gently, brushing finger tips across Steve’s belly, along his chest and side, until his eyes close and his breathing comes a little easier.
“There’s no trail, nothing that I can detect that says this might be some kind of magic. Plus, who would want to do this?”
The Tunnel fires up, the noise almost deafening and before he can think anything else, a brief white hot flash of light blinds them all.
He slammed the door on his way out.
He doesn’t answer, just lets out a miserable wail in Tony’s ear. It doesn’t sound like pain exactly, but the cry of someone utterly fed up with everything. Tony runs his fingers through Peter’s hair, ignores the little kicks Peter’s making against his side.
“This is not the same thing. The protocols you put in place worked Tony,” Steve says. “The Iron Man suits launched and they pulled us out. I know you think if you just work hard enough, you’ll be able to protect him from everything, but that is never going to be the case.”
Things would have remained that way, would have remained
Wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist, Tony pulled him in close and pressed their mouths together.
“Fine,” Steve doesn’t bother qualifying his answer. “We’re trained to be resilient.”
“How was it?” he asks, even though he kept tabs on Tony’s mission updates. Tony sits on the edge of couch, his hip brushing Steve’s stomach.
“I sure did.” Tony finds Peter’s bear, sticks it under his arm.
“Better,” he says. “Not perfect, but better.”
“Wait, did you and Captain Rogers fight?” Peter picked his head up from the screen. He looked mildly panicked. “Is that what happened?”
“I’m not scared,” he says, swishing his arms in the suds. “You’re Iron Man. You make sure I don’t get hurt.”
“Nothing you need to worry about,” Peter says, still not meeting his eyes. “I had it handled. I’m fine, aren’t I?”
“Fuck her,” Tony says. “Come inside her.”
“It’s nice,” he says. “To have someone to take care of.”
“Hey kid,” he says, trying for casual and failing. “Want to grab dinner?”
Tony takes a deep breath and lingers at the door to the gym, clutching a thick accordion file folder. Inside, Steve stands at the far end, the rhythmic
"Oh," Steve yawned again, wider this time, his jaw almost splitting in two.
They kissed again, slowly, as Steve came down. With his messy hand, Tony undid his own pants and pushed his aching erection along the flat of Steve’s stomach. Steve moaned at the touch and moved to take Tony in his hand, but Tony gently pushed his hand away. “Not yet,” he said.  He fisted himself slowly as Steve watched, the head of his cock leaving little clear streaks across Steve’s belly.  “All week,” he said, “I wanted to mark you. Make sure everyone knew you were mine.”
Steve shakes his head, squeezing Tony’s hand in apology.  “He left this morning. Once they woke you up and Bruce said your vitals were strong.”
“Stop,” Tony says quietly. “It’ll leave a wet spot.”
“And?”
“That was wonderful, kid. Exactly like we drew up,” Tony says. His eyes are bright and Peter’s smile grows impossibly wider.  As they leave, Tony slings an arm around Peter’s shoulder and catches Steve’s eye. The corner of his mouth turns up a fraction and he gives Steve a barely perceptible wink.
“I don’t want anything you don’t want Tony,” he said. “Forget anything happened.” He stood ramrod straight and his face had the chiseled stoniness of his Captain America mask. It was the look he wore for visiting dignitaries and photo ops. It broke Tony’s heart to see it directed at him.
It’s not clear if he’s being obstinate because he’s a thirsty toddler or because he’s still holding Steve’s baby remark against him. “Buddy, we don’t have red juice,” Tony says. “We have this juice and we have about a million different types of beer in that fridge. Right now, this is your best bet.” Tony holds out the glass, which, after a moment of dithering, Peter reluctantly takes.
The meeting progresses like most of them do, a mix of bureaucratic posturing and some actual drilling down into details, but it lasts far longer than necessary. By the tail end, Steve begins to shift in his seat, his jaw tightly set, the same look on his face as last night. Despite Ross’ earlier instance that he looks just fine, Tony knows that isn’t the case, and it makes him momentarily bold. Under the table, Tony rests his hand on Steve’s knee and leaves it there.
“I’m not a baby!” Peter peers out from behind Tony’s leg, turning a comical glare on Steve. “Babies are dumb! I’m four years old!”
“Take off your coat, come on.” Tony said. He’d already hung up his suit jacket and poured himself a drink. Steve wouldn’t be able to get drunk off anything here, but he gulped down the whiskey Stark passed him, mostly out of habit.
In public, Tony’s body had no problem behaving itself. His arms and legs and hands and feet kept themselves to themselves and let Steve exist in peace without an onslaught of casual, physical affection. There was no placing of hands on his knee or thigh or even a shoulder. When they sat next to each other during committee meetings, his elbow never grazed Steve’s, their fingers never “accidentally” touched.
“I’m fine,” Steve said with a curt nod. “You were right, it was a bad idea. You can go back to New York with a clear conscience. We’re fine.”
“Look, I’m mostly kidding, but don’t act like it’s not obvious. I’m just saying, it’s harder to ignore something if you have to share a bed with it.”
“I know,” Steve mumbles, already drifting away.
“Have you talked to him?” Tony murmurs, easing back against the heavy weight of Steve’s chest.
Steve laughed and began to pull him towards the bedroom.
“10 minutes. Max.”
“Fine,” Steve says again, like it’s a reflex.
Peter just laughs and runs to take her hand. Tony doesn’t see them till right before lunch, when he bursts into the lab and launches himself into Tony’s arms with an unexpected glee.
“Very funny. You know you’re awfully interested in me getting laid.”
“Could have gone better?” Steve hissed. “You almost got us disbarred from the entire organization.”
“You’re doing it again,” he says.
“I don’t want to do it.” Tony answers honestly, surprised by the waver in his own voice. “But I don’t think there’s a choice. In the end though, if you say no, we don’t do it.”
‘We cut it short. Wasn’t much reason to stay after the final session. No one felt like going to one last formal dinner.”
“I said, shut up Tony.”
There were plenty of parties tonight, and even a few Tony wouldn’t have minded going to. It wasn’t too late to change into something nice and head back out, but his heart wasn’t in it. He thought about the look on Steve’s face and the flicker of disappointment in his eyes when Tony had dodged his question.  With a sigh, he heaved himself off Peters bed. He grabbed what was left of Peter’s pizza and headed back to their room, where Steve was already settled in on the couch, nose buried in a briefing binder. He looked up when Tony entered, but didn’t say anything.
His heart sank. “438,” Tony said, resigned.
It gets a half smile from Steve. “I wasn’t the problem.” He pauses for a second, and Tony tugs at his hand to urge him on.  “I think Peter had a hard time.”
“Like what?” Tony said.
Steve just sighed his approval into Kara’s mouth and gave a slight nod. As they kissed, she picked up his right hand and placed it along the inside of her thigh, inviting him to stroke the soft skin.  Steve did just that, his attention divided by the feel of her skin under his hand and Tony’s slow caress across his abdomen. He was already overwhelmed, everything inside him on fire, his cock throbbing.
He shuts his eyes one moment and the next, the jostling of the mattress wakes him. Just enough morning sunlight streams through the curtains, lighting the bedroom a deep yellow. On the other side of the bed, Peter plays with two action figures. He grins when he sees Tony’s awake.
“Not good, huh?” he slurs. He tries to lift his head as Steve cautiously removes a hunk of Tony’s chest plate, taking stock of the damage.
“It didn’t spark anything for me,” Steve says, looking distraught. He stands across the threshold, t-shirt matted to his skin with old sweat, little bits of boxing tape still on his fingers. “I didn’t look at those pictures and suddenly have it all come flooding back to me.”
They try again and again, and both times, nothing works.
Steve groaned at the bad joke, used to Tony’s occasional flirtations.
“They used the tunnel in the lab but it looks like some kind of….remote connection activated the one in Scott’s van,” Hope says.
Tony wanted to argue, but that was in fact what had happened, right down to the language he’d used.
By late afternoon, Steve finds himself sandwiched between Natasha and Sam in the conference room, listening as Ross outlines the UN’s latest request. Steve’s eyes drift across the table and land where they usually do these days. Having long mastered the art of looking without really looking, his eyes trace the sharp edge of an exposed a collar bone, follow the delicate curve of an ear.
“Yeah, sometimes they are very scary but sometimes they just make me sad.”
He’s losing control now, everything spilling out and over. With eyes filled with longing, he looks at Tony and begs.
Steve had laughed off the idea, and tried not to be offended. He could get his own dates, if he wanted.  Except he was Captain America, and suddenly everyone he talked to had their own agenda, their own needs. Outside of Tony and the rest of the team, he’s not sure anyone saw him as just Steve Rogers. He’d tried to displace that energy, throw himself into his work, but he wasn’t a monk. Or, at any rate, he wasn’t interested in turning into one, involuntarily.
Bruce clears his throat. “Tomorrow. We should do this tomorrow.”
“It goes like this,” Peter says and from then on it’s easier to follow his four-year-old logic. They’ve built almost half the ship when Steve stands over the play area.
Peter nods enthusiastically. He climbs over Tony, little toes digging into Tony’s sternum, an elbow poking him in the stomach. He’s barely patient while Tony pulls on a sweatshirt and tugs at his arm all the way to the kitchen.
Steve curled his fingers through Tony’s hair, tugging his face up. “There’s nothing to be scared of.”  Tony kissed him again, harder this time, pushing into his mouth until Steve was groaning in protest.  He wrenched his mouth away, gasping, as Tony traced the outline of his swollen lip with his thumb.
“The most important one survived,” she says, offering as much of a smile as she can. “...wanna see?”
“What, you think we’re just gonna let you go after that?”
With a squeal of delight, Maggie throws herself from the bed to get ready for the wedding.
“Who’s blood is that?” That came out harsher than Tony intended. Harley nods along to it like it came out just right, arms folded aggressively across his chest.
, Harley? Of course it matters—” Steve starts.
"June 6th, 1944," Peter sighs dramatically. At Harley's weird look, he scratches at the back of his neck. "I have a really good memory. And at my school, it actually is about the philosophy and cultures, and learning from the past mistakes on how to make a better future. I'm actually supposed to write a paper about how the second world war changed the American attitude towards foreigners and war and all that."
FRIDAY intones.
Maggie thinks as rings are exchanged and people cheer and cry and--
“Yeah, you can take that sass down a level there, kid,” Dad says. “How and where, Steve?”
“Bleak,” Tony croaks sarcastically, and everyone chuckles through the snot.
As Tony finishes his vows, Maggie cries, because Steve looks like that’s all he wants in the world.
Maggie comes forward too, grabbing Peter’s hand. “But you’re our family, Peter. Whether or not it's official.”
“If you’re going to ask Steve That Question,” Harley begins, mouth twisting in distaste—“
She heads for the door.
he—” she holds her hand out towards Mystery Kid—”
Steve huffs a laugh, warmth puffing Tony’s hair where nose and lips nuzzle almost-kisses into his scalp.
“I’m glad you’re okay.”
Maggie follows Peter’s bugged-out gaze to where Steve’s motorcycle peels down the block, skidding to an illegally-parked stop. Steve sets the kickstand and leaps off in the same motion, vaults over a legally-parked car, lands with arms out, and scoops Maggie right off the sidewalk.
For the rest of the night, Steve doesn’t talk about Peter.
Soon after they take their seats, Harley joins them. He sits next to Maggie before sliding into the same kind of conversation. Peter doesn't mean to engage in it—in fact, he prefers to sit on the sidelines—but Harley tempts him with talk of physics. Before he knows it, he and Harley are deep into debate and time just seems to fly. He hasn't been able to talk like this to someone since he met Ned and MJ.
“Now that’s the kind of tech-bender I’m a little more okay with,” Steve says. “But first—sleep?”
It’s home. When they kiss—every time—
“Right. The addition. So.”
“Right. We sit in our billion-dollar tower and wait for a runaway kid to knock on our door like ‘Hey there, Cap, I had a funny feeling you wanted to see me—’”
“He was,” Peter agrees. “The best.”
about this. It just...doesn’t come true for all of them.”
Peter meshes with them, complements the holes in their family and does his best to contribute to a home. They have a long way to go, because Peter still seems to think he doesn't belong, but there's something unbreakable with them because they chose each other.
“Privacy is a constitutional right,” Steve says, frowning. “But what’s done is done. It’s what we do next that matters now. What strategy we take.”
Even Steve and the Avengers didn't close the circle.
“Any everything that comes before the maybe-after-life,” Tony says, nerves starting to get the best of him. “Life-life. I want to spend my life with you, Steven Grant Rogers.”
“Oh, right,” Tony says, bracing again.
“I hate you!” Maggie yells. She backs up, but just to grab more slush.The first handful misses, the second hits one of the sidekicks. A passerby steps on one of Maggie’s drawings, , too preoccupied by pretending not to see the big boys closing in on her. Maggie stares down at her precious portfolio scattered along the sidewalk and feels rage build within her. “I didn’t do anything to you! Eat shit, shitheads—” she begins to crouch to pick up more ice to throw, but the biggest boy is too close. Maggie panics and surges forward instead, shoving him away with both hands. He just laughs at her while grabbing her wrists, wrenching her arms above her head. Maggie spits and it lands on his coat, but he doesn’t let go.
“I know this is—a lot, and kind of crazy, and there’s a lot of legal shit to work out, but—when I told you, from the very beginning, that the kids came with being with me, no negotiations there—”
“You want more, we’ll get more,” Steve says, and laughs again, and lays Tony down so he can kiss the rest of him.
“I’m Harley,” Harley says, sticking his hand out. “Harley Keener.”
"Have a Holly jolly Christmas...it's the best time of the year…"
Peter's stomach rolls every time they walk in; is it a coincidence that the week Peter saves a little girl with his superhuman strength, and Captain America is somehow close to her, they start showing up at his favorite youth center? Are they looking for him, tracking him down and wanting him to explain his strength? And if they find him, will they try to make him stop being Spider-Man or arrest him?
Steve nearly crashes the car. “Harley James, did you seriously—”
“Maybe it’s time for Captain America to put in some community service hours,” Steve says slowly. “You tracked him to Brooklyn Community Youth Center, right? He goes there in the evenings? It’s a good enough place to start.”
“Something came up. Urgent. I’m sure Steve will be in touch soon.”
“Until I met you,” he continues, “and you blew my world wide open, baby. All of a sudden, waking up was exciting because most days meant seeing you. You gave me a building to live in and a friend. For so long, I was content, even when I wanted more of your kindness and your dry humor, and your ridiculous bots. I wanted more of your children’s laughter and Saturday night dinners. I wanted everything from you, but couldn’t understand how the bland shell of a person I was might be someone you loved. And then you came to me and you filled me with light and love. I will never forget that, Tony. How you breathed life back into me and how we both understand where we stand in each other’s lives. So yeah, I agree to have you. In return for your love and your faithfulness, I promise security. I promise to apologize when I’m in the wrong and to remind you of your worth, every day until I’m gone. I promise that I’m not gonna get it wrong, but baby...I’m going to give it my all because you deserve that. If you let me, you’ll get it.”
“Wouldn’t change it for the world,” Steve promises. “I love them, Tony.”
it. Maggie wipes angrily at hot-cold tears streaming over her cheeks, shoves past an uncertain sidekick to try to get to her art. The most important one hasn’t been stepped on—yet—
“Um, I should really——
“I know, I know, it’s up to Peter, and we’d have to deal with all the bureaucratic bullshit that comes with making everything official and legal, but I’m paying enough lawyers enough money to—”
” He says
“Hey, no problem,” he says. “Did any of your art survive? Gosh, I shoulda been faster. I only caught a glimpse, but what I saw was
“Dad...where’s Steve?”
Maggie gasps. Tears flood big brown eyes. “He—he said
There’s a moment where the swearing stops and everyone’s just kind of hanging there catching their breath, when Mystery Kid says quietly, “That enough? We done?” The two bullies look at him, back at each other, and then frantically search for their leader, who’s already booking it down the block like the coward Harley promises all bullies secretly are.
“‘Course. And make a better impression the second time around, I hope.”
“Am a part of this family,” Tony tells him. “Pete...we’ve been wanting to help you, to take care of you for a long time. Even before I knew you, I wanted to make sure you were alright. It’s okay that we don’t know each other that well. Steve adores you. You’re Harley’s best friend. Maggie thinks you hung the sun in the sky.”
Tony shivers. Melts back until he’s pressed fully against his lover.
“That’s how it is.”
“How do you feel about—this? Forever. Or, you know, whatever stretch of mortality, sentience, this life and any afterlife we mere mortals are granted—”
“What did you do?” he hisses, harsh and so threatening her rescuer takes a halting step back. Maggie kind of wants to back away herself. “Tried to steal something? Mug a little girl? Don’t even think about running. Unless you think you can outrun Captain America,
She’s always had a good life. Maggie’s father may not have wanted her, but her mother cherished her and her brother protected her, and his biological father--Tony Stark-- chose her. Maggie loves Tony, calls him dad, thinks nobody can touch him. He’s the one who taught her what it meant to be a good person, to look at the world around you and decide to make it better. He uses his talents to help others, and he’s teaching her to do the same. With his heart and his mind and his money.
“I would be honored,” Mystery Kid says solemnly.
Well, Thursdays have become good days, ever since Captain America started showing up at Brooklyn's Youth Center. The first time Peter saw him, he hid behind couches and nearly shit himself as the man walked in with armloads of ingredients for tacos on a Tuesday afternoon. Two kids, two very familiar kids, trailed after him with more ingredients. Then they all gathered in the kitchen and began making tacos for the kids and volunteers. Two days later, they came back again to help kids with homework and played games until the center closed. Then,two days after that, they showed up on aSaturday afternoon with box after box of pizza and pasta, sending kids home with to-go containers and full bellies.
“Yeah, that’s a hard no.”
Harley snorts. "We were all there, Old Man."
plus the follow-up grab. Then he pushes—looks weird ‘cause it’s hesitant, almost gentle—and that big boy goes tumbling on his ass, eyes huge with a shock Maggie shares.
“Peter was awesome, Harley,” Maggie chirps. “Fought all three boys at once. I kicked one in the nuts like you taught me but he got back up so Peter had to deal with all three of them. They went running at the end! You shoulda seen—”
Maggie nods. Accepts the offered tissue, mops up her face. Finally gets out a clear enough ‘
Peter rubs roughly at his eyes. “Well, shit, Mags. Can’t really say no to that, now can I?”
A rock settles into Steve’s stomach as he processes this.
“You already answered it.” The way Steve’s looking at him, you’d think Tony engineered the sun itself. Which is silly, because Steve
It’s just that: he was going to propose tonight.
“Not to mention the mafia-held waterfront warehouse CCTVs,” Dad says at the same time, slipping from stern to proud. “I’m out of the country for two days and you’re stalking the damn mafia?—But hey, nice job there, kid. I sent a tip-off to the FBI, they’re shutting down a major drug shipment as we speak—”
from him. "Sorry, sorry! I just can't believe you're here!"
"Mr. Stark barely knows me," he says. "And it’s only been a few weeks, I-”
Harley is gonna be so mad at her. Not half as mad as he’ll be at the boys she’s about to lose a fight to though, and that’s even worse. He always overreacts— subconsciously, maybe he thinks he’s make up for all the times he didn’t stand up to bullies when he was little. Now, he’s taller than Dad and never cries, and anyone who acts like the tormentors of Harley’s past get shut down so hard and fast that his own memories get scared. That’s how Maggie figures it, anyway. Harley doesn’t even care how much trouble he gets in for it.
“When my mom died,” Steve startshaltingly, and Harley’s eyes snap to him, intrigued in spite of himself. Steve very, very rarely talks about his past. Any part of his past. “I was—the same age Peter is now, actually. Had nothing left. Except my best friend, and my best friend’s family, and they wanted me to come live with them. They were the best people—didn’t have much, but they had...a good home. They loved each other, were kind to each other. Would have treated me as one of their own.
“I’m sorry,” Maggie  sobs. Tries to tell him again that she’s totally fine and very grateful; her brother will be here soon - he can go if he needs to. It’s a garbled, hiccuping mess and her phone won’t stop buzzing, and she should answer it and she really, really needs a tissue—
Their foreheads drop together and Tony’s shoulders shake. Maggie has to hide her face in her flowers and Harley squeezes Peter’s shoulder because he looks like he’s gonna break.
She pulls her Christmas project out of her portfolio. It’s a Coat of Arms inspired by a unit on medieval heraldry from last year’s social studies class. She worked on the design for months before she started painting.
“I can handle big asks,” Tony rushes. “Steven Grant Rogers, will you marry me?”
want to do is run to Tony and beg for a lawyer, wants to bring Peter to their home. He doesn’t just want to help Peter. He wants to be sure nothing can ever hurt him again. Steve wants to curl up on the couch with Tony and look over and see all three kids watching TV and throwing popcorn at each other. He wants to be sure there’s always a warm room, protective gear, and moral support. He wants to help with papers and watch Tony take too many pictures for prom and—
“Give it
? Not even going to
“But,” Harley’s voice lowers, “what if he doesn’t have much time? How long can he really keep living like this?”
“He tarzan-swings off fifty story buildings for fun,” Dad says dryly. “I’ve been tracking Spider-man for a while. If he’s survived this long, he’ll make it a bit longer. We’ll need plans B-through-Z, of course, but I like it. Got ideas for things Cap might want to donate to the shelter, Harls?”
“No problem,” Mystery Kid says, all smiley and relieved. “Looks like everyone’s good, then, I’ll be going—”
It’s just that Tony has been planning this date for weeks. Months. Actually he was planning this date before he even dared dream of asking Cap on a date. It was less planning and more fantasizing at that point, but the ideas born in that fantasy were good ones.
“Language,” Tony says tiredly. Ugh, he sounds like
"What's this about?" Peter asks as she walks into the room. He must have received the same summons.
“When we first met,” Steve chokes. “I was homeless and confused and...displaced. I seemed to never be alone, but was so desperately lonely that every night felt like I was stepping into some kind of void. Day by day I felt like I was fading. No family and no friends. No life.”
"And we owe something to you," Harley insists. "Since, you know, I couldn't be there for Maggie and you were. I feel like we never got to thank you properly. This could be our chance!"
“Let’s hope you’ve grown out of that phase,” Dad says, light and teasing like it’s a joke, but Harley sees the way he holds on tighter.
and say, “I love you, I love this kid, and I want to adopt him. With you.”
you to use it,” Steve manages to say before Harley cuts in with a retelling of her account.
That’s still pretty funny. They’ve been together for what, half a year now? And Steve fucking Rogers still goes bright red every time Dad kisses him in public. He certainly never discourages it, though.
“Yes,” Steve says. “He—he’s going to make it though. He has to make it—he’d lost a lot of blood before I even got to him—”
“Um, no,” Harley says, sass creeping up to impertinent levels. “We want to make sure Steve understands what it means to marry
“I was trying to help—wow, you two are really into Captain America, huh? But I didn’t do anything to Maggie. Just gave her a hand—she was doing pretty awesome, actually—”
They’re looking at the people who came before them and saying “you fucked up our world, and we’re going to do our best to fix it.”
“My uncle,” Peter tells him quietly. Where he’s been tapping a pencil to the table, he stops and looks Steve right in the eye. “Before he died, he had quite a lot to say about what people do with the power we have.”
“Sorry,” Maggie whispers. It was stupid to use it.
because fuck it if they think they can stop him. Even if it’s just sneaking food and clothes out of the tower, getting a job and donating money, Harley can do
. And that’s if you outrun me.”
“My deepest wish,” she finished. “It’s all of ours, Pete. Everyone says it's your choice, and I know that, but...please. Please say yes.”
"False," Harley corrects. "I just don't see the point in being tested on random facts to memorize. There's never any discussion on the philosophy of the past or learning from the cultures. We just have to remember when D-Day is."
“It’s Peter,” Steve tells him, short and soft, the moment the Medbay doors have sealed behind him. “They’ve taken him into surgery.”
That evening, when Peter joins the other kids for dinner, the little girl he saved—Maggie, he remembers—drops the bag of tortillas she’s holding and beams. Between the bright smile and sunshine yellow hair, Peter considers that she's a little like the sun.
Well, shit.
“Yeah, get out, y’all are gross,” Harley grumps. Accepts a kiss on the head from Dad, a manly thump on the shoulder from Steve. He actually is really, really exhausted. Harley’s also really, really relieved. He’s not 100% on board with Steve’s plan, but at least there is a plan. At least they’re taking this seriously.
“So, what,” Harley says, because okay, Steve shared some super personal stuff and he can kind of see how it applies, but still: “you’re not going to help a homeless kid? A homeless kid who’s a
“You got to him in time,” Tony says, reaching out because fuck it all. Steve is in front of him,  Steve needs comfort, and Tony loves Steve. “He called you. That’s what matters. He knew he could call you, and he did, and we’re going to make sure he’s okay. Yeah?”
Steve stills. His arms tighten around Tony.
Peter stares at the envelope in his hands before looking up with wide eyes. He stammers, unable to settle on one thing to say. He looks so confused and hopeful and just—raw. So far from the boy who saved her.
“Harls,” Maggie hisses from the backseat, “shut up.”
Okay, he sounds cool. All calm and confident. But unless he’s a secret kung-fu master or something, Maggie’s kinda agreeing with the gathering, sniggering bully trio: this kid doesn’t look like much more of a threat than Maggie was while alone. The ringleader has pretty much recovered from the only real damage she scored, and now it’s less about mean kids entertaining themselves and more about proving a point, but no way Maggie’s wasting this. She wipes her face on her sleeve, keeps her finger pressed on the lock screen button on her phone until it vibrates three times. Harley’s received her emergency alert and location, a failsafe she both feels guilty for using and stupid for not using sooner. Then, she’s down on hands and knees, frantically gathering up her art.
He wants to be Peter’s dad.
“I’m sure,” Steve says instantly, hand coming up to cup Tony’s cheek. Then he bites his lip, caution sliding over open joy. “I do have, um, one question of my own...”
“I can handle Harley,” Tony tells him. “You do what you need to do.”
,” Maggie shouts, panting hard from playing the most awful kind of monkey-in-the-middle. The bullies look like the eighth graders at her school—huge compared to Maggie and most of her grade six classmates; nothing but big awkward babies next to high schoolers like Harley. Three big boys and Maggie’s precious art portfolio held up tauntingly by the one who seems to be in charge.
“...Weekly pizza nights,” Harley says, a little bit peeved, but...fine. If this is the extent of the trouble he’ll get in for staying up for 70 hours straight while breaking a whole bunch of laws, skipping school, and basically being a stalker, he’ll take it. For now. “And Taco Tuesday, obviously. And upgrade their wifi, I’m sure it sucks. Phones for the kids who need one—come on, Dad, we’ve got to have a model that’s, like, really sturdy, waterproof, small, can hang on a lanyard and be hidden under clothes, really long battery life, accepts any kind of charger, doesn’t look expensive—fine, I’ll design one. Needs to come with prepaid Spotify, of course—”
“Dad loves you and wants you to be better,” Dad says piously, but Harley catches the shadow of self-loathing that’s unfortunately never really absent when Tony Stark talks about himself. “You’ve been acting a bit too much like me lately. Time to channel better heroes, kid. Hey, look, we’ve got one right here—” he leans up to smooch Steve’s cheek. A cheek that promptly blushes bright red.
There’s nobody like Tony Stark.
“Um, you could use my sleeve? It’s mostly clean? Aha! Found one! Starting to feel better?”
“Exactly! He was
Peter can deal with that. Maybe he can finally come out of the shadows and eat pizza with everyone else not have a panic attack at the mere thought of being in the same room as these people. It was possible they didn't even remember him, right?
“Okay, fine, I’m not arguing that,” Tony says, because he is secretly every bit as committed to keeping Peter Parker safe and spoiled rotten in the tower with his own kids as Maggie is. He and the kid haven’t had too much time together in the past few weeks, but he’s something else (Tony briefly thinks,
Maggie's double-handful of dirty snow soups him right in the face. While his mouth is wide open. He spits swears and street-shit and throws her portfolio to the ground, now reaching for Maggie instead.
“Hey now,” he hushes, gathering her up in his arm, dropping a kiss on the top of her head. “Let’s have some faith, yeah? I’m sure—”
Maggie drags Peter towards the taco bar and thrusts a plate in his arms. She's talking a mile a minute about her art and about her brother's genius, and how her mother got remarried and moved to California, so her father swooped in and asked for custody. They were together for Christmas and everyone got along really well, but she is honest enough to admit that she loves living with her father. Well, not her father by blood, but her father in all the ways that count. Harley's the one actually related to Tony, but he's been the one who took care of her for her entire life.
He considers that it could be both.
“Of course I wasn’t fine! That’s the whole point I’m obviously failing to get across here!
And mine. Just give me a couple weeks to train up.”
And when his baby sister needed the protector Harley is supposed to be? Harley wasn’t there. But Peter Parker was.
, and he’ll never stop being grateful for it, but it’s...heavy. There are lots of kids who need just—just a fraction of what Harley has, and their whole lives would look up.
Steve keeps his face stoic as they pull into the youth center. Peter is sitting on a bench, holding a paper in his hands and looks up as soon as Steve puts the car into park. At the little giggle Maggie lets out and the grin Harley shoots the other kid, the rock is Steve’s stomach doubles in size.
Steve sighs, casting a look over at Harley. The teenager is holding one of the many boxes of Chinese food they’d ordered for a Saturday at the youth center.
“I promise you’ll regret this,” Maggie warns, swallowing fear and biting down hard when it tries to come back up. She absolutely hates that she's starting to cry. Her Christmas present for Dad and Steve (and her deepest, dearest Christmas wish) is in that portfolio. She’s been working on it for two months. When her art club teacher said it turned out amazing, Maggie was so proud that she couldn’t wait for Harley to come pick her up. She started skipping down the sidewalk on her own, too excited to stand still. It’s only six blocks from her school to his - she’s not a baby, she doesn’t need an overprotective brother meeting her at the door—or all the girls in her class gathering to giggle over how hot they think her dumb brother is. Today was a good day in a whole row of really good days, and that made  her confident. So confident, that she ruined everything.
When he got home though, the urge overwhelmed him, and he swallowed hard. Ten times, Tony had said. He’d been paid ten times his normal fee. “Fuck me…” Steve said softly.
He worked his way down Stark’s back. The pattern of tensions hadn’t really changed. Steve wished he could lay the man out and just work him over until they made some progress, but he kept his touches light.
“Good evening, Mister Stark.” He smiled, feeling genuinely happy to be back. “Should I set up the table or do you want to use the sofa again?” He asked.
“Yeah. Yeah, okay.” The response was soft and dazed and Steve couldn’t help but smile at him.
“Is there anything else I can do for either of you today?” Steve asked, looking between the two of them. While he’d had his back turned, Potts had gotten off the table and slipped Stark’s house coat on, looking the picture of relaxation as she sunk onto the sofa next to Stark, talking to him very softly. Steve saw the man shake his head.
Tony braced himself when Steve’s cock breached him, pushing in slowly, the skin dragging a bit until they the remaining lube that still coated his insides a couple of inches deep. Steve pulled out and pushed in a second time, this time making Tony moan, releasing the breath he’d been holding. The slide was smooth now, and the feeling of Steve’s cock slowly sinking into him was so deeply familiar that he could only relax. Steve pressed him tight against the wall, shuddering as he bottomed out. Tony could feel him panting softly against his neck.
“I’ll just feel my way around for a moment, okay? I don’t really understand what I’m looking at, I want to feel. You can take a hold of my wrists if that feels better?” He offered, remembering how Tony’s hands had shot up to stop him the last time he’d gotten too close to the device in his chest.
He realized Tony’s hand was moving and he looked down over Tony’s shoulder to watch Tony stroking himself, getting his own cock comfortably lubed.
“Okay, no problem at all. What would you say hurts the most today?” Steve asked, because there was no doubt the man was in pain. He was pleased to see that Stark actually took a moment to think about that.
"Yeah, they already emailed me this morning, the deposit's been paid, so I'll be there at 8:30AM." Steve assured him. "You two enjoy your weekend away, you deserve it." Steve shifted Sam's underwear back into place, covering him with the towel to his chest to keep him warm and comfortable while he moved his legs ever so slightly to get better access. He started working on Sam's upper thigh, using the length of his forearms to smooth over the firm muscles.
A sound did come, but there was no telling if it had been in response to Tony’s request or if it would have come out anyway. It was a primal pained noise.
“You were hoping she’d be there for moral support.” Steve said, understanding. “Mister-… Tony, there’s nothing bad that can happen here. I promise. I’ll be really careful, and I wouldn’t do anything you don’t like anyway.” Steve assured him softly. “Do you want to have a security guard in the room with you?” He offered. “For safety?”
“No, I just wanna make you feel good.” He told Tony, sliding his exploring hand down Tony’s front to find Tony’s cock erect and interested.
He ended up turning Tony to his side and working from the back to the front in his rib area to really feel out all the connecting masses of tight muscles and loosen them strategically. He worked and worked, checking in with Tony about the pressure repeatedly as he went.
Word had gotten around somehow and over the last year or so, Steve’s struggling massage studio that he’d operated out of an overpriced Brooklyn studio apartment had flourished into a business the specialized in house-calls. He’d long given up renting a place, instead everything ran over his website. Word of mouth really was the best advertisement.
“No. I love you, I’m just happy you’re home and safe.” He said, kissing Steve’s collar and running his hand over warm naked skin, one hand trailing up Steve’s back, the other downwards.
“I could do with one of your foot massages.” She told him, and Steve understood that she wanted to keep Tony calm and happy on that table if possible. He could do her feet right here on the sofa.
The last request for an NDA ahead of a consultation had come in weeks ago and Steve had almost forgotten about it, with how busy his week had been.
When Steve was next escorted into the penthouse of Stark Tower the atmosphere wasn’t anywhere near as warm and calm as it had been the week before when Steve left it.
“Would you like me to put on a heating blanket?” He asked, assuming that she didn’t have the same hang-ups that Stark did.
Sam made an amused sound. “The fact that you think I can make him do anything.” Sam smiled. “Harder.” He said softly and Steve complied, digging his fingers a little deeper into the bottom of Sam’s foot. After that, he focused on Sam’s body in silence for a while, turning him over and working on the front of his legs for a bit. He could feel Sam’s gaze on him occasionally, wondering what Sam saw.
Erskine had no living relatives, and so it fell to the heir of the serum’s co-creator or the people who discovered the remains to decide what happened to the body. Tony was both of those entities, so the ultimate decision of what happened to the remains of Steven Grant Rogers fell to him.
Stark’s hands shot up and caught Steve’s before he could get more than two inches below the man’s collar, holding Steve’s hands with vice grips, panting as he stared up at Steve with wide frightened eyes.
“Mister Rogers, hello. I’m sorry I just realized how early it was.” She said, sounding wide awake. She was either a morning person, or severely jetlagged. Or both.
After a moment, Stark did and Steve pulled his hands back up to the man’s shoulders, massaging them gently. “A lot of people react like that when I get near a part of their body that's in pain. It’s not unusual.” That was a blatant lie, but he didn’t want Stark to feel embarrassed. Sure, Steve had had one or two veterans lash out at him like that, but at least they’d been aware of their own PTSD. He wondered if Stark was.
Steve did so immediately and watched as two beefy guys started inspecting his equipment. They were delicate about it too, no rough handling. They lifted and turned his table and oils around as if they were all made of glass. Steve appreciated that. He’d been searched before and not in a good way. Even the pat-down he received was polite and swift.
“Needs to be at least that comfortable.” She agreed, smiling fondly at Tony who was out like a light.
Steve knew Tony very well by now. The first reunion had to be rough, it was what Tony needed. He needed to feel wanted, he needed hands to grab, limbs to cling, clawing nails and hard kisses that reminded him he’d been missed.
“There’s always room for you. I want you here, it’s not right without you.” Tony admitted and Steve nodded, kissing him.
“That works, yeah, that’s good. Thank you.” Tony said, nodding and pulling his shirt back on clumsily.
He nodded in response, sitting down within reach of Stark.
He set to work again, focusing on Stark’s neck. Laying down and stretched out as he was, Steve could feel much more and treat Stark's tight muscles with more precision. He turned the man’s head this way and that, cradling his head with one hand while working on the opposite side of the neck. After some time he gently rolled Stark’s head into his other hand and did the same for his other side.
Tony came seconds later, panting for air, his whole body shaking with exertion and pleasure.
Tony sounded so frightened and Steve wasn’t stupid enough to not take him seriously.
All around him, scientists bustled and argued in thick winter coats, trying to figure out how to thaw the remains out while doing the least amount of damage possible. Some were of the opinion that it’d be better to keep him frozen like this until they could get the remains to a better-equipped facility.
He could feel Steve shift towards him with interest. “Maybe I just need to distract you for a bit?”
“Want me to carry you to the shower?” Steve offered, smiling down at Tony.
Miss Potts snorted in response. “You shouldn’t laugh before you tried it.” She scolded him good-naturedly.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think of that. Must be weird to not see your body?” He said, stroking his hand up Steve’s arms. He was so solid. It was making Tony dizzy, making him feel unsettled that he couldn’t see Steve when he could feel him so clearly.
Tony shook his head. “No. Pepper knows, a friend of mine does too. That’s it. I can’t tell anyone. I … bad things happen when people know.” He said, not elaborating.
(See the end of the chapter for
Less than ten minutes later he was sat in a town car being driven all the way to Brooklyn by a man in a suit. The envelope in his pocket was heavier than it should be, and Steve didn’t have the nerve to count it in the car.
“Let me know if you want to book another session. I’ll try and be available whenever suits your schedule.” Steve said, picking up his table again, oils already packed away.
Steve glanced at the man’s chest. There wasn’t much to see there now, not with the t-shirt on, something looked slightly odd though, Steve didn’t dare look too closely right now. Maybe a deformity of the chest? An injury that hadn’t healed well? It was hard to tell. He could only focus on treating what he was allowed to treat. If Stark wanted him to know more, Steve would find out.
“Stay down for a few minutes, okay? You’re going to feel dizzy.” He warned him, his hand on the man’s arm over the towel.
Stark swayed a bit and Steve stopped his movements, putting his hands on the man’s shoulders to steady him. Working on the neck and head could make people dizzy, hell any massage could have that effect. That was another reason why laying down was a great idea. “Would you like to take a break? I can get you some water.” Steve offered, his tone warm and patient.
“Please do, I’m always cold.” Steve slid the heating blanket under the covers and turned it on while she took her shoes off, groaning in pain. “When you’re ready, please undress to your comfort level and use the second towel to cover up.” He said, turning around to give her privacy while he pulled on his belt that held the harness with the full oil bottle he used for convenience. “Are there any particular areas you’d like me to focus on?” He asked.
So far three separate scientists had attempted to email funding bodies and the military, but JARVIS had blocked the outgoing transmissions. Tony really needed a plan.
“Thank you, that was amazing.” Steve rolled Tony onto his back so he could kiss him, sated and calm now.
Steve couldn’t stop thinking about his appointment at Stark Tower for the rest of the day. He couldn’t stop thinking about Stark’s back either. It wasn’t unusual to see businessmen with painfully tight backs. Hours hunched over computer keyboards with no movement were enough to ruin the healthiest back, but Stark’s back was something else. The patterns weren’t typical for office work, the parts of him that were tense didn’t match the lifestyle Steve imagined for him. He wondered if Stark had been injured recently, maybe during his kidnapping?
Tony’s shoulder sagged. “No. No, but she knows already.” He put his foot down hard on the carpet, rocking back and forth on it, as if trying to decide whether he could take the step he so anxiously needed to take.
Then he stood and waited for Miss Potts.
“I’m really sorry I kept you waiting, Miss Potts.” He said, heading over to her. “Do you still want me to work on you?” He asked.
“No problem.” Steve assured him quickly, glossing over it and sliding a folded towel under Stark’s head for comfort. “I’ll work on your neck and shoulders but let me know if you’d like me to focus on something else as well.”
Most of all though, how could he trust anyone on this ship with these remains. These were only partly his people. If the corpse was thawed out, how could Tony keep it safe? He realized that he’d have to be the one escorting it back to civilization.
"Yeah sure. And feet." Sam decided, adjusting himself a little on the table. "You staying for dinner?" He asked Steve when he set to work on Sam's lower half.
“Can I?” Steve asked sliding his hand back down Tony’s front.
He didn’t offer any advice on footwear. This was a brilliant woman. She either wore them because she loved them or because she genuinely felt she had to, and it wasn’t Steve’s place to tell her otherwise unprompted. Miss Potts was easy to treat though, and he enjoyed her instructions and expressions.
He was aiming a little blindly, trusting Steve to kiss him. The angle was familiar though, and so was the feeling of Steve’s lips on his. If he closed his eyes, it was like nothing had changed, like his husband hadn’t turned invisible somehow.
“Exactly.”
Stark took a deep breath that seemed to almost hurt him. “Alright. But when I say stop, you’re done.” He warned Steve.
“Miss Potts is just fine, no need to call me Ma’am. 4:30 will be perfect. Please report to the reception desk at Stark Tower and provide a photo ID. Security will take you where you need to be.”
“No, Steve, thank you. That’ll be everything today.” She told him. “Would it be alright if I’m here for Tony’s next treatment?” She asked.
He worked down the sides of Stark’s neck and to his shoulders. The muscles there were tight, and Steve followed the tight muscles back over the edge of the shirt collar down his collarbones and-
The fact that he’d been asked back at all was a big deal though, and Steve figured maybe he had some wiggle room to maybe try his luck a little bit. “Do you wanna try sitting on the table? The sofa is wonderful, but it’s a bit soft… if you sat up here, I could get a more accurate picture of what’s going on with your back?” He offered. Now that he was looking at Stark, he could see he seemed in a better state than last time. He looked showered and put together, though not more rested compared with Steve’s last visit.
Tony shook his head. “I can’t. I can’t, this can’t. Fuck.” He stopped pacing turning to face Steve. “I need help, but I can’t ask for it, because you can’t see what’s wrong.” He explained.
“What’s the duct tape for?” Steve asked, though what he really wanted to know was ‘what the hell is this whole thing for?’.
He could feel Steve getting close, bearing down on his cock in the last few thrusts and crying out when Steve reached between them to stroke Tony’s cock through the last thrusts he could manage before he came inside his husband.
Steve smiled. He was almost certain now. She was doing this to get Stark on his table. Whatever she knew that Steve didn’t, it had her concerned enough to set all this up to help Stark get the treatment he needed. Steve admired that. Whatever they were to each other, there was a lot of love there, that much was clear.
Nothing could have prepared him for the desperate low whimper that followed after another half hour of thawing. Tony suddenly remembered how painful it was to warm up ice cold hands after a long time outside in winter. This had to be the same sensation, except amplified by magnitudes. Rogers had to be in agony.
Steve was relieved when he could agree to the third slot she named. “So that’s tonight, 9PM and then 10PM for yourself?” He confirmed. It was a bit late, but not the craziest time slot he’d ever agreed to by a long shot. “I’ll be at security by 8:40. Did you have any particular requirements?”
Steve worked over her feet and up to her calves and knees before she decided that would do for her today.
“Take a hot shower, alright? You’ll be sore tomorrow.” He told Tony, holding his gaze for a little longer than he’d intended to.
Sure the only way he could do that was by offering his services outside of office hours, and yes, that meant that sometimes he didn’t get much sleep, but life was finally running smoothly for the first time ever and he wasn’t about to give that up.
“No, no I don’t think so.” Steve really liked her voice, there was something kind but professional to her. Efficient, but not rushed.
It wasn’t hard to deliver, Steve did miss Tony desperately when he couldn’t have him. Just sleeping next to Tony last night showed him how badly he slept without him, how short and restless his nights at SHIELD were. With Tony in his arms, Steve could easily sleep 7 hours like a normal human, peaceful and restful, when alone he woke up after 3 hours, fully functional but wired.
On some level, Steve knew they were going over the hour mark, but by the time Tony laid slack jawed on Steve’s table, arms relaxed at his side, breathing as deeply as the device allowed, two hours had passed. Steve looked over at Miss Potts, a little panicked, but she just gave him a warm smile. Steve smiled in return, covering Tony up to his collarbone with a towel and walking around the table so he could face him.
“Alright then, thank you for calling. I’ll see you tonight.” Steve promised, smiling when she agreed and hung up. Wow, a double appointment at Stark Tower. Steve got most of his business via word of mouth, but he hadn’t imagined Stark would speak about their appointment in a way that would convince Miss Potts to book Steve.
Steve stroked his palm over the tip, slick precum easing his way as he wrapped his hand around the top of Tony’s length, stroking it gently, his own hips shifting in response, his cock sliding between Tony’s legs.
“No worries at all. Miss Potts already booked me again for the same time next week, if that works for you.” Steve said, not mentioning that it sounded like he’d been booked for the foreseeable future.
“I signed all the non-disclosure agreements. Whatever you need stays between us. And I’ve got really warm hands. I promise.” Steve tried when the man didn’t respond. He could see the indecision on Stark’s face.
“You’re so beautiful. This place is amazing, it’s so you.” He admitted, a loving smile on his face, even as lust clouded his vision. Steve wanted to burn this image into his memory, Tony’s warm skin against him, the sun shining into their bed, and pleasure flowing between them with only their moans and the soft sound of the waves filling their ears.
Steve had done more research on him since their last appointment. He hadn’t been seen in public for 9 months, not since the funeral of his mentor, Obadiah Stane, which he left early. Steve understood now that Miss Potts might have been the only person to see him for great stretches of time in the past months. No wonder he’d been so nervous about a new person in his home.
In a moment of madness, Tony retracted the armor’s glove, putting his arm hand on Rogers’ forehead, feeling him cold but not frozen. Worse, there was the slightest twitch, an increase in pressure, as if Rogers was seeking out the warmth of his hand.
“Please.” Tony’s voice was so soothing. He sounded so relaxed, still a little sleepy but utterly content. Steve loved him like this.
“It glows, through clothes.” Tony elaborated, still tense. “And I can’t have you seeing this in detail.” He added. Steve nodded, understanding. The tape was for him.
“That works.” Tony said, amused. He stretched away from Steve and for a second Steve was confused until he heard a pump and realized Tony was getting some lube. Yes, what a great idea.
Half an hour of watchful waiting and Tony was convinced he was either right or insane. He saw small muscle spasms start up in Rogers’ face and then his body, as if long-forgotten muscles were starting to get pulled back to life.
Later that night Steve found himself watching YouTube videos on his phone, different angles of that famous press conference playing on his screen. He watched as Stark sat down in exhaustion, his arm in a sling, hunching forward ever so slightly. There was something shaky about him, Steve read later that he’d come straight from the airport to the press conference.
He smiled, nodding. He fetched a towel from his bag, sat down on the sturdy couch table and laid it out over his lap. She scooted down on the sofa into a comfortable position and laid her foot in his lap.
“Fuck...” Tony still couldn’t believe it. “It’s going to be alright. You’ll see.” He said, detaching the chest plate from his armor and laying it over Rogers’ torso. It didn’t fit there well but it did so well enough to lay flat. Tony could see the exact moment when the armor’s heating plate registered with Rogers. Something settled and Tony realized his face had gotten almost animated, there was agony written on it, but that expression relaxed ever so slightly with the added heat the chest plate provided. Maybe it brought him comfort.
“Hello Steve. I’m glad you could squeeze us in.” She said, taking off her shoes and suit jacket to sit down on the sofa.
He could feel the pleasure building in his lower belly, even with his cock untouched. He had to close his eyes, the room moving too fast with no central point for him to focus on. Tony missed looking at Steve, but he clung to him, panting with need, his body responding to the strange visual disconnect by clutching onto Steve’s cock tightly.
The building was huge and in Steve’s opinion a little ugly on the outside. The inside was beautiful though, all marble floors and sleek gorgeous lines to all furniture and appliances. Even the elevator banks blended into the design seamlessly. It was well put together and Steve felt intimidated, when he walked up to the reception desk.
Instead of the two clients he expected, he only found Mister Stark, pacing anxiously.
He let go of Tony’s cock for a second, but to his surprise it wasn’t where Tony’s hand went. Instead, Tony lifted his upper thigh and reached between his legs, stroking Steve’s cock with his lubed hand before lowering his thigh again, creating a perfect warm place between his legs for Steve to thrust in if he wanted, his cock squeezed between Tony’s perfect thighs.
“Oh yes, of course. The one with the ‘no electronics allowed in the client’s apartment’ clause. Yes, of course I’m happy to comply with that if you can provide a safe place for me to leave my phone.” He said.
“We’ve kept you late, it’s the least we can do.” She said and Steve couldn’t help but smile.
His heart was pounding when he entered the lobby, but he smiled at the receptionist when he signed in. He was searched with the same care as last time and led into the same elevator by a security lady in a sleek black suit. She was nice to Steve but her air of no-nonsense was unmistakably professional.
“Hey Pep.” The relief was written all over him. He trusted her to have his back, that much was clear. “We were just about to start.” And with that he laid down on Steve’s table.
“Of course not.” He choked out after a moment. “Why would you, I’m the one that pays you.” Steve had a feeling he was more telling himself than he was telling Steve.
The fact that they’d been fucking less than three hours ago when the call had come was almost unfathomable a minute ago. So much had happened, but now, with Steve’s other hand sliding into the back of his jeans, he sure remembered what they’d been interrupted doing earlier.
Steve knew the man was on the fence, any little misstep would get him kicked out right now, so he was gentle when he reached out, putting his hands on the man’s shoulders and stroking them inwards and down Stark’s spine. He could feel muscles coiling all the way down. It wasn’t a surprise, but Steve really felt for the man. He had to be in so much pain. “You just tell me if anything hurts in a bad way. A bit of pain is normal, but it’s meant to feel like it’s helpful for later.” Steve spoke quietly.
Steve woke up peacefully with that tingling sensation in the front of his brain that he always got when he spent hours and hours talking to Tony. They’d had a lot to talk about, but more importantly, they’d had a lot of catching up to do. The night was a haze of skin and sex and feeling so good that his brain was still marinating in happiness.
“Exactly.” He agreed. “Lay back down, Mister Stark, please.” He kept his tone steady, though inside Steve’s stomach was coiling with the shock of the sudden movement and the fear he’d seen in the man’s eyes.
This was a dream. He could barely believe he was allowed to live it with the love of his life.
Stark’s head was warm and heavy in his hand and for the first time it felt like Stark felt calm. His eyes even drooped shut, head shifting into the touch ever so slightly. Steve smiled, glad to see the otherwise tense man look so at peace.
“You’ll get to have more than just a look at this.” Tony assured him, and quickly found himself pressed against the wall, with Steve’s cock pulling most of the way out. Steve shifted his grasp on him, holding him more tightly, leveraging Tony’s weight and pulling away from the wall.
“Nope, nope, nope! Take it off!” Tony shook his head, his hands up in front of him as if he was torn between covering his eyes and reaching out to tear the clothes off of Steve.
This time, Steve wasn’t alone in the room when the elevator doors closed. Stark was already in the living room. This time in sweatpants and a t-shirt. The house coat Steve had worked around last time wasn’t far though, he could see it draped over the end of the sofa. The look on Stark’s face was a curious mixture of anticipation and trepidation. It was like he couldn’t believe he’d asked to have Steve back.
“Is she travelling?” Steve asked softly, putting down the table, but not unfolding it yet.
“If Mister Stark is happy to have you in the room, you’re welcome to be there.” Steve assured her, looking at Stark who was still looking at her. Finally, he nodded, making her smile.
That was new.
All thoughts of Potts and SI were put on the backburner while Steve tended his next client, but before he knew it, their time was up, and Steve cleaned the table and packed up to head to Stark Tower.
He heard the soft noise of a zipper being undone, then more fabric noises and finally the softest of creaks of someone climbing onto his massage table.
“Uh huh.” Tony agreed, hand sliding between them to wrap his hand around Steve’s cock. “Gotta say, this feels pretty cool.” He said, looking down between them to look at his hand stroking over absolutely nothing, like he was miming a hand job. It made him laugh. “Why is this hot?” He asked, amused at the sight.
Now that he’d claimed his partner back though, in these peaceful surroundings with a blanket of calm that he’d never really felt before, rough was the last thing on his mind.
“This is insane…” He said, fingers coming into contact with Steve’s naked torso. Tony stepped closer, his other hand coming to rest on Steve’s hips. Everything felt normal, he could smell Steve’s body wash, his skin, and yet his eyes were seeing absolutely nothing. Not even a sheen or a ripple in space.
Steve kissed him in response. “Yeah, just… had to have good long look is all.” He said, and Tony smiled at the heat he could hear in Steve’s voice.
“You can’t put too much pressure on my chest, that’s why I can’t lie down.” He explained, not elaborating further than that.
It was a while until Rogers body stilled. “Oh god, please don’t be dead.” Tony said quietly, feeling the man’s neck for a pulse.
It wasn’t Miss Potts who slowly walked out of the marble corridor though, it was Tony Stark himself, wearing what looked like pyjamas and a soft house coat, his hair was in a disarray as if he’d just rolled out of bed. Nothing about the dark circles around his eyes indicated sleep though.
As he was bent over him, Roger’s eyes opened. They were glassy and unfocused but sought out Tony in a dazed way, pupils very wide in the somewhat bright room.
“Got it.” Tony was collecting himself, controlling his breathing. Steve got his belt on, oiled up his hands and set to work. He started with Tony’s shoulders and neck area, working on really easing him to lay down into the towel that served as a pillow, massaging the back of his neck and right beneath his skull by lifting his head ever so gently. He felt Tony inhale the scented oil deeply. This part was already familiar to him now, it wasn’t scary, he was relaxing into it, so Steve took his time.
When Steve was massaging Sam, he didn't need to think. His hands, the length of his lower arm and his elbow became automized precision tools, like his body was honed for Sam's relief. There was only one other person he'd ever had this level of familiarity with, and Bucky had deserted Steve's services when he'd gotten serious about his relationship with Sam. Steve couldn’t blame them, nothing felt better than a massage from a loved one who knew what they were doing.
Days passed and Steve got busy again, the whole Stark situation blurring into the background. He wasn’t even sure if he’d ever see the man again.
It was just him and Tony here, and he couldn’t have been happier.
Tony sat up, suddenly and Steve followed his gaze, smiling when he saw a helicopter approach the tower. “Is that Miss Potts?” He asked, smiling, so happy to know Tony would have his lifeline after all. Maybe that way he could relax properly and let Steve do his best.
Steve couldn’t help but wonder what it did.
Tony could only smile in relief. “Hey there handsome. I was just about to try the Princess and the Frog method.” He joked, before he realized that Captain America came from a very different time and was most likely a homophobic asshole by today’s standards.
Whenever anyone booked him, Steve grabbed his foldable massage table and set out to his client’s place. His prices were on the low end of average for a New York City massage therapist but given that he rented a tiny studio apartment to live in and had no running costs outside of his constant need to replenish massage oils, Steve felt like he was making bank.
As the night dragged on and on, Tony pulled up a chair that creaked under the weight of his armor and watched the shape in the ice become clearer. More and more water ran down the drain, leaving salty streaks on the floor.
