Steve shook his head. “Stay here,” he said. Tony waved him off, and he took a deep breath. “Are you going to-”
“Your old shield, it made with the finest steel that your people had access to.  It was made to protect a man, to protect a mission,” Shuri said.  She scooped up the shield and held it with one hand, the polished surface of the vibranium gleaming in the firelight.  “This?  This is a shield that can protect a nation.”  Her chin came up, her eyes sparking.  “Take it.  It is the shield of a king.”
Steve was silent for a second.  “I'm...  Very aware of having bones,” he said at last, and Tony didn't know exactly what that meant, but it sounded very unpleasant.
Steve swallowed hard, ignoring the way his pulse was pounding in his ears.  “Don’t do that,” he gritted out from between his teeth.
“So why not just hire waitstaff?” Greer asked.  Jan looked at her, and Greer rocked in her chair, her green eyes flashing.  “It’s New York.  There have to be temp companies that provide waitstaff, right?”  She sorted through the menus, tossing a few aside.  Steve picked one off the pile, flipping through it.  “Hire people to keep the tables full and to walk around with trays.”
“No, that's what the lessons are for.”
There was a moment of silence.  Then, “It isn’t her.”
“It was not, I cut my hair, which has nothing at all to do with her,” Jan said, her voice tinged with poisonous sweetness.  “It’s not as if I cut her hair.”
“Looking forward to trying it at my next contract negotiation,” Tony agreed.  The rain was slowing now, the wind kicked up, and he shivered.  “I still can't believe you dragged me out into this.”
His hand fell into his lap. “Know what did?” He took a breath. “When he picked up my coffee cup, and asked me if I was done. And when I said I was, he just...” His fingers worked at the fabric of his pants, his nails scraping hard against the fabric, desperate for something to hold onto. “He drank the last of it before he put it in the dishwasher.”
“My fault.  No one else’s.”
He was never going to survive.
Steve would take offense to that, but Tony hadn’t moved, hadn’t even tried to pull away.  Steve kissed the nape of his neck, the back of his shoulder, loving the way he could feel Tony’s muscles flex beneath the skin.  “Pretty sure this IS my side of the bed we’re both on.”
Jan gave him a narrow eyed look. “Jarvis, make it stop,” she said, tossing herself on the couch.  “This whole display is unnatural and frankly quite terrifying.”
“You lost him?” Strange said, his voice rising, and Clint turned on him.
“Wonderful,” Tony said, as Jan started to laugh.  “Obie, make the arrangements.”
“Sit with me,” Steve said, and his head was down, his shoulders hunched.  But he was holding onto Tony like a lifeline, and Tony loved him so much it hurt.
The words didn’t really make sense, a nervous, uneven rattle of syllables. He talked for talking’s sake, instinct driving him on.  DJ was still crying, but it sounded normal now, just an exhausted, frustrated child.  He pressed his face against Tony’s shoulder, burrowing into the fabric.  Tony stroked a hand up and down his back, smoothing his hair, patting him gently when his breathing hitched.
He looked back up, catching a fleeting glimpse of an expression that he couldn't quite read on Steve's face.  But it was gone before he had a chance to puzzle over it, Steve's usual smile creasing his cheeks.  “Sure.  Any requests?”
“Glad to hear it.”  She picked it up.  “Come back for lunch, I can always use the help after the rush.”
“Well, glad one of us believes in me right now.”  Before he could change his mind, Tony bounced his knuckles against the door in a rapid, staccato pattern.  “You awake?” he called.
Steve moved in, at the exact moment that Tony stood, and suddenly, they were there, chest to chest, face to face.  They both froze, and Tony was there, his eyes wide and dark and Steve’s heart stuttered to a stop.
Steve laughed.  “No one in this household, honestly.”
Tony stabbed at the screen, frustration sizzling through him.  Every file.  The same signatures.  "Fuck," he repeated.   And then again, soft, resigned.  “Fuck.”
That was as far as she got before Nat executed a neat turn, switching feet as she did.  Her heel clipped the back of Clint's head and he swayed in place for a second.  And then he pitched over, falling to the mats with a thump.
“We needed to know what you were doing,” Bobbi said, and he turned on her.
Even for Vegas, it was an overwhelming mess.
“Jesus, stop before you sprain something,” Tony said, snatching the sweatshirt from Steve’s hand.  Steve smiled at him, and Tony muttered something that sounded a lot like a curse. “You are a pain in my ass, Rogers, you know that, right?”
“Any less cook time, and they would still be raw.” He pushed the bowl over towards Shiro, who reached for his own set of chopsticks.  “The noodle should have a dense, firm chewiness, it should have a presence that matches the broth, that stands up to the crunch of the vegetables, but this-”
In the lobby of the chapel, a young woman in a white, bespangled jumpsuit was dumping red and white rose petals into a basket.  “I want you to know that I got you real petals,” she was saying to DJ.  “Cause I like you.  And we only had pink in the silk ones.”
As he fled the kitchen, he heard Natasha laugh quietly. He would owe her later, he knew it.
Steve froze, sucking in huge lungfuls of air as he stared at the empty alleyway. There was no figure, no person. Just a bricked up wall, marked with graffiti and ankle-deep rubbish. Unless the suspect suddenly gained the ability to sift through walls or climb up them, they were gone.
Her tiny grin sharpened into a mischievous smirk. “Wouldn’t you like to know?” she purred and then chuckled when Steve grimaced. “I’m kidding. I just gave him a few ideas and left him to it and now he’s got himself sorted. If Clint can choose a costume, so can you.”
He hadn't realised until he saw Tony laugh, genuine and unrestrained during one of the movie nights. He watched as Tony threw his head back, his dark hair tousled, eyes creased, his kissable lips parted in a smile, the flash of pearly white teeth, the angle of his jaw and the arched column of his throat and all Steve could think of was what it would be like to kiss him.
He followed the bullet hole and resting place, up over the heads of the crowd and with grim satisfaction, noted exactly where the gun had been fired. Whoever had killed the victim, had done so on top of the bakery and was long gone. Steve suppressed a small sigh. This case was getting more complex by the minute.
He shrugged. “Considering Tony’s made it so that no one can know what our costumes are, it’s a bit hard to ask for help.”
“I was with them the entire time,” she confirmed and Steve reached for his journal. It wasn’t his official work one, but it would have to do.
“Sir has instructed me to confirm that he and three other Avengers are downstairs already but I cannot say whom,” J.A.R.V.I.S sounded regretful but it was enough to ease Steve's nerves a little. Four Avengers were down there already and one of them was Tony. That he could work with.
“That’s how this city works,” sneered the vendor, folding his arms over his chest. “You don’t like it? Don’t make you special. You think I’m gonna lower my prices just because someone’s gotta problem with it? Welcome to Hedersett. Everyone’s out for each other. Get used to it or go home.”
It started off with the small things. Making Tony cups of coffee in the meetings, pretending not to notice the visible surprise on his face before it was masked. Helping him cook meals on their Saturday dinner nights and gently probing him into talking about the Italian recipes he knew like the back of his hand. Bringing him a small snack when he was working in the workshop and wrapping up any leftovers for Tony and leaving them in the fridge until he was ready.
Instead, he grinned, trying to tone down his excitement.
Tony was at first an enigma to Steve. His mouth would flash a dazzling smile and say the words but his eyes would say something entirely different. He could remember the harshness of Tony's voice back on the helicarrier all those years ago but God, his eyes. His eyes were bright and shining and as molten as whiskey.
“So, do you want to go on a date with me?” he asked, tugging Tony closer until their bodies were no longer apart.
Tony treated the whole thing suspiciously at first, as he was wont to do, but Steve kept up his newly formed habits until Tony's insecurities settled down.
It was a typical Victorian style suit but it was tailored specifically for Steve. The shirt was white and neatly ironed, with a dark burgundy waistcoat and black tie. His trousers fit the curves of his legs and his shoes were polished to a high sheen. With his coat, he would look like the perfect Victorian gentleman.
They both dreamed of falling and falling and falling until they woke in a panic as their dreamselves hit the ground. They both dreamed of dying.
With a sigh that was an edge too defeated, Steve secreted his journal and pencil back to their designated position in his jacket and hauled himself to his feet. He hid a wince at the stiffness in his left leg; another souvenir from an accident that wasn't just a funeral for a man with no body and the imprint of blood and soot on his eyelids at night.
“Werewolf, ghost, Frankenstein’s monster or Frankenstein himself, a vampire--”
After that, Steve knew why he wore the sunglasses. They were another wall, another thing to hide behind that wasn't his paparazzi grin.
Nor did it look particularly threatening. It was cream in colour and his name was inscribed on the front in sweeping silver calligraphy. His trained artist’s eye saw the faint baroque style trim on the sides and when he flipped it over, he couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow at the red wax seal. Mainly the little ghost imprinted in the centre of it.
It was the same size as the one tucked in his pocket, leather backed and bound with bare pages lined with a gold dusting. He longed to pick it up, turn it over in his hands, breathe in the scent of fresh paper.
He knew without a doubt that Tony would be extravagantly dressed. He was never the kind to be underdressed for a special event. Just the thought of Tony, styled for a masquerade ball, whiskey eyes glittering through a mask was enough to make Steve’s mouth dry and his heart stutter. Seeing him in person on the day of the party was going to turn Steve into a flustered mess, he could just sense it.
, he thought to himself, as he pushed himself up from the sofa.
The person looked like a woman, but they were dressed in back, with a tumble of pale blonde hair, and when Steve took a step forward, to either shoo or ask if they wanted something, they were off down the road.
Steve couldn’t help but frown before he read on.
Still, he forced himself to open Sam's most recent letter and it was a relief not to see the same message of “stay put until we say so”.
“How much for it?” Steve asked, wincing at the roughness to his voice. How long had it been since he had spoken to someone? Probably not since the night prior when he had helped an elderly lady home after a fall but then, Steve thought with another bite of bitterness, it wasn’t his fault he was stranded without friends in the middle of nowhere.
A bright peal of laughter rang in the air, louder than the clatter of trains and the distant hum of the zeppelins. Steve followed the sound, his eyes landing on a cluster of children on the grass. They only looked about seven, with grubby cheeks and hands, scruffy clothes and tousled hair. One of the boys was throwing a lump of coal in the air, over the heads of the boy and girl in the middle of the circle.
Only to skid to a halt.
In the centre of his forehead was the small roundness that could only indicate a bullet. A halo of blood circled the man’s head, soaking his straight flaxen hair, flecked with grey brain matter. It was a calculated shot, no doubt about it. Steve didn’t know any ordinary men who could be given a gun and manage to aim for the forehead and make sure the bullet hit home. Perhaps by luck but this wasn’t what Steve would describe as a lucky shot. No, this was precise and done by someone who knew what they were doing.
When Steve got back from his run, there was an envelope waiting for him on his bedroom pillow.
“Just checking,” Steve laughed, untangling their hands so he could wrap his arms properly around Tony’s waist.
Tony looked positively sinful; his suit was casual but practically clung to every line of his body. His red wine shirt was unbuttoned far enough to show Steve the sharp cut of his collarbone and tanned skin, his tie loose enough that Steve could wrap it around his wrist to pull Tony in for a kiss. A pair of onyx horns rested on Tony’s dark hair, curved like a ram’s and the mask that hid most of his face was as red as his shirt but with glittering gold swirls curling across it.
“Then what are you doing?” he asked, inclining his head slightly. “Shouldn’t you be making nice with the other guests?”
Getting to know Tony had been more of a challenge than Steve was willing to admit. However, Steve wasn't an idiot. He took it slow.
Part of Steve ached to pull his badge out and flash it in his face, to try and arrest him on the grounds of something, but he wasn’t on active duty. His words would hold no weight.
Of course Steve had. Countless times. Not that he was going to tell Tony that.
He huffed out a soft laugh and managed to steer her around another pair of dancers without stepping on her toes or her dress.
He stumbled as a young girl barrelled past him towards the front. It was just as he caught his balance that the reality of the situation sunk in.
“Oh no,” Tony grinned as he dragged his hand down Steve’s arm, calloused fingers leaving his skin burning as he pressed their palms together. Steve really hoped his hands hadn’t gone clammy from his nerves. “I don’t think I have.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Maybe he’s not down yet.”
But then what would he say if Tony was in front of him? Would Steve play it off, banter with him and try and censor his thoughts? Just try and be normal, even though he ached to press their mouths together, to see if Tony's hair was as soft as it looked. If Tony's love and trust was an ocean then Steve would let himself drown in it gladly.
“It’s nothing extravagant,” she tsked as she pressed her hands on his shoulders and lead him into a gentle sway. “But, I can’t find Clint anywhere so you will have to do for now.”
There was a sharp pinch on his neck and he jerked, glaring down at Natasha.
The girls nowadays did things much more elaborate things with the makeup they had on hand. Steve watched video after video of contouring and then special effects looks, mimicking their techniques and his own artistry knowledge of paint on his arms and wrists. In the end, he got the information he needed in time for him to get ready.
He felt a presence at his elbow. “You’ve outdone yourself, Steve.”
The only time Joseph Rogers had been a decent human being was when he gifted Steve the watch. It was a man’s watch, he had said as he slipped it onto Steve’s far too skinny wrist, where it dangled like a noose. Steve hadn’t wanted to upset his unusually jovial father and said it was a pretty gift and he really did like it. Except hindsight was a wonderful thing.
“Because…. You’re out of my league?” he said slowly.
The spine was cracked and held together by a fraying ribbon that was once a brilliant red and was now a dull, insipid shade. There was a splodge of pale brown on the pages from spilled ale in the pubs and there was a distinct splatter of something Steve really hoped was butter. Despite its new imperfections, it still came everywhere with Steve, carefully hidden in the lines of his coat along with a pencil. On a crime scene, or just for a walk, it was always there.
“I feel the same,” Tony nodded, mouth ticking up into a crooked smirk. “So can you hurry up and kiss me or something? Or are you gonna keep me waiting?” He paused, eyes widening mockingly. “Oh my god, you’re not going to be completely traditional and court me before we make out, are you? Because I really don’t think--”
The girl in the centre of the circle suddenly surged up on her bare toes, snagging the lump of coal mid flight and letting out a pleased squeal. The boy she caught it from groaned, jutting his bottom lip out but switched places with her without argument and the game resumed as if it hadn’t been interrupted.
“Would it be possible for you two to give me your names and addresses?” he enquired. “I won’t be able to ask you any questions right at this moment, but I will need to when the other policemen show up.”
“Shut up and kiss me again.”
Steve swallowed back a curse that would have made his Ma roll in her grave as he whirled around to stare at Natasha. She was sitting at the kitchen island, her elbows resting on the counter as she peeled an orange. He wanted to say that he hadn’t noticed her but that was far from the case; out of everyone, she was the only one who could successfully sneak up on him and take him off guard. He wasn’t sure how she did it, but was forever grateful that she would at least observe his mood from a distance first. It wasn’t a brilliant idea to sneak up on someone with a classic case of shell shock.
Instinct kicked in.
It was Tony’s turn to tilt his head curiously. “What makes you think I don’t feel the same way?”
“That about sums it up, sir,” Steve sighed.
For the first time since the funeral, Steve had smiled slightly at the words inked onto the paper. It had been short lived but it had appeared.
“I-I didn’t do it,” she sobbed when Steve glanced towards her. “He- He was my husband, I would never--”
The city that never slept, according to Sam.
He pulled a face, swinging his foot out in an effort to shake away the twinge of pain he felt when he stepped forward. It eased to nothing more than a phantom annoyance as he continued the wandering path towards the bustle of the grey city.
Tony's arm locked around his waist, firm and unyielding as he beamed up at Steve. How did Tony have the ability to light up the whole room, especially on Halloween?
He wasn’t lying either. Judging by the shell-shocked expression her delicate face, and just from the bullet wound alone, he knew it wasn’t her. A gut feeling, and usually, his gut was right.
“I’m surprised you haven’t stolen the spotlight yet,” he teased, gesturing towards her clothing. “Tony should be careful.”
He turned at Natasha’s voice and couldn’t help but smile when he saw her. She looked stunning; her silky black dress was floor length with a slight plunging neckline and long sleeves made of lace that draped over her slender hands. Her normal bright red curls were hidden under a long black wig that tumbled down her back like a waterfall and her mask was pure, black lace.
“Come,” Natasha grinned, latching onto his arm. “Let’s slow dance. You can’t attend a party without a dance.”
It was enough to make Steve at least shake off some of his fear. Tony hadn’t outright rejected him or made it sound like a bad thing.
Steve had known for a very long time that he liked most genders. It wasn't something he spoke about back in the forties; the only ones who knew were Bucky and Peggy but that was all. Nowadays it was more acceptable to be out and proud.
He scrubbed at his face with a hand, wiping away the sweat that had broken out across his forehead and turned back to the mouth of the alley.
Natasha tsked at him. “When did you get such a defeatist? You’ve got plenty of options if you just opened your eyes a little.”
He read through the letter again before tucking it back in the envelope and putting it in the drawer on his bedside cabinet. He had a couple of weeks at most to sort out his costume. The hardest part was trying to find something that was “spooky” and original, without copying someone else. Not to mention he had to find a classic Venetian mask.
A week had passed since he had received his invitation and he had confirmed his attendance with Tony in person, he still had no idea what he was going to wear. With secrecy being one of the rules, he couldn’t ask Natasha for help either. Natasha would have known what to do but for once, Steve was on his own.
Steve scribbled it down hurriedly on the first blank page he came to. His mind was already whirring with possibilities and motives and suspects. It would take far longer than just a moment of thinking to form an idea, and he needed more information but he couldn’t very well ask for it here, with a crowd like vultures behind him and a woman heartbroken and traumatised.
The darker haired woman nodded. “My name is Darcy Lewis, and this is my sister, Jane Blake,” She jerked her chin towards the corpse. “Her husband was Donald Blake. We live at number forty-eight, Rosewalk Drive.”
“I’m no Tony,” she said, but judging by the subtle curve of her full mouth, Steve would guess that she was pleased. “It’s not just you beginning to give yourself grey hairs over this, Steve. I found Clint facedown on the gym floor, surrounded by multiple holograms displaying different costumes.”
As he applied his contacts, false canines and makeup (which merely consisted of some contouring, fake bite marks and fake blood), remembering the advice from the multiple girls and women from YouTube, Steve couldn't stop his mind from wandering.
Tony said he dreamed of water filling his lungs, of Yinsen's haunting expression, of feeling death grab at him again and again and again as the arc reactor was yanked from his chest and the palladium poisoning made him decay so painfully.
His hands shook with barely suppressed frustration, at people who thrived on the misfortune of others, at this damned city, at the accident, at Philips, at Peggy, at Sam--
“Time to be the bearer of bad news,” he muttered to himself, shaking his head. “
The walks no longer exhausted him, the people made his loneliness more profound and apparent and the paper remained empty. A similar state to Steve's being, if he wanted to be poetic. Or melodramatic. Either worked.
“Just because one person’s willing doesn’t make it fair,” he countered. “That’s not how the world works.”
“Okay, J.A.R.V.I.S,” he said, hoping he didn't sound as nervous as he felt. “Am I allowed to ask if any of the other Avengers are there yet?”
Steve hesitated. They were already on thin ice and the slightest misstep could cause it to give way underneath them and bring everything crashing down around their shoulders.
The communal lounge had been completely transformed. False cobwebs spilled from the ceiling and strings of bat and pumpkin shaped diary lights were pinned along the top of the walls. Pumpkins of all shapes and face designs were lined up against the glass windows and the walls themselves weren't bare; someone had splattered one with fake blood and another had a mural of different ghosts painted on.
It had chilled him to see the man staring back at him that could have been him if he hadn't accepted the trial medication. The accident had taken its toll on his physical appearance and it was frightening to see the sliver of a boy he had once been. The boy with jutting bones, sharp edges and a pair of lungs that made each breath a struggle. The boy who usually had a mouthful of blood and a nose broken one too many times from scraps in alleyways.
Oh fuck, I'm in love with Tony Stark.
“Stay there, Hogan, I might have a lead.” He said sharply and didn’t wait for Hogan’s reply; he bolted after them, shoving his journal in his pocket as he went.
“You two head on home,” he said, rising smoothly to his feet. “I’ll schedule an appointment with you as soon as I have need.”
He added an
A thought Steve didn’t want to entertain. He pointedly downed the rest of his drink, even if the alcohol did virtually nothing to soothe his sudden spike of anxiety.
Central Hedersett was a hubbub of activity from the crack of dawn until the late hours of the night. Even from his tiny bedroom window, Steve could observe the bakers working vigorously at midnight. Markets were strung up throughout the day, selling wares and knick-knacks he didn't want and children chased hoops, stray dogs and each other over cobbles, always narrowly missing a horse and carriage or the occasional car. The zeppelins and airships whirred in the grey-blue sky and there was always a distant rumble from a factory or the clattering of train wheels on tracks.
“Like what?”
Steve whirled, his guards going up but he was too slow. Something sharp scratched into his neck, right on his pulse point with the accuracy of a snake going in for the kill and a slender arm hooked around his waist in a lover’s embrace.
The invitation wasn’t signed, but it didn’t really need to be. Steve read over it again, his mind beginning to whirr with all possibilities.
Steve didn’t dare to hope. “You mean--?”
Yet, it didn’t matter about his surety. The suspect had escaped and outwitted him in a city in he hadn’t deigned to investigate and with it, so was a potential lead.
That was when Tony started opening up.
An astute, albeit suspicious, observation if Steve ever saw one. Not that he blamed the man in the slightest; if someone appeared at a crime scene in Meckport like he knew what he was doing, Steve too would have been suspicious. He inclined his head. “No, sir, I’m not. I’m Detective Rogers from Meckport,” Before the officer could ask, he handed over his badge.
“That’s not a fair price,” he said, with a frown. “Not everyone has that kind of money.”
He hadn’t been able to draw since the accident.
Another gradual thing. Not that Steve minded because he was just too wrapped up in the fact that little by little, Tony was beginning to trust him.
The vendor shrugged. “Idiots out there are willin’ to pay, ain’t they?” He turned his head, spitting a glob of saliva on the ground and Steve’s stomach turned in revulsion. His ma would have scolded him for such a disgusting habit.
As Hogan went through the motions, Steve let his gaze wander around the street. The crowd had virtually dispersed and the market was back in its usual bustle, but looks were occasionally cast their way. He ignored them, setting his sights back on the top of the bakery and then around it. There was no clear way the killer could have gotten up there without access to the bakery itself, surely? Unless there was an alley and a way up to the roof around the back but people weren’t usually that lucky. Steve wasn’t going to discard it as an option, though; he needed as much information as he could get, however abysmal.
A woman screamed.
Natasha snorted, taking the flute from his hand and taking a sip. Her nose scrunched slightly as she swallowed and she passed it back to him. “Even if I did have all the eyes in the room on me, you’re the only one who wouldn’t be looking because the only one you have eyes for is Tony.”
Tony began to idly sway them to the music, but Steve couldn’t tear his eyes from Tony’s smile. What was he playing at? He couldn’t believe for a second that Tony was oblivious to what he was doing. Tony’s pansexuality was absolutely no secret to anyone but he was also a massive flirt. He hadn’t earned the reputation of a playboy for nothing.
Her smile was like butter wouldn't melt. “It's bad manners to not pay attention to the lady you're dancing with.”
Steve dreamed of ice, of Bucky's chilling scream as he fell, of bullets, wounded soldiers, bombs and blood.
He was aware that Hogan shouted something after him and whatever it was was lost in the air. Steve would have to apologise and explain later.
The relief that rushed through him was heady and he huffed out a laugh. “Nat, you’re a genius.”
“I believe you, ma’am,” Steve said firmly but kindly, before she could ramble further. He wasn’t much good at calming distressed witnesses by himself, especially women. Peggy normally handled it but since he was on his own, he would have to try his best.
“Maybe,” Natasha's smile turned into a smirk that was downright devious and Steve would've been lying if he said that the look itself didn't downright terrify him. “But I believe someone is trying to get your attention behind you, and I must go and find Clint before he upsets Tony's guests.”
Tony was the first to pull away, looking slightly dazed. Some of the fake blood Steve had created with some lipsticks had smudged across Tony’s lips and he had to fight the urge to kiss him again.
Although he ate most of his meals in the safe house, prepared by his own hand, for there was something soothing about going through the motions of cooking, Steve had taken to having lunch at the tavern. The Witches Brew was a good place, despite its name and usual patrons that frequented. It had a homey feel to it, with its chipped cups, hearty stews and soups, the odd busker coming off the streets to perform. Everything was at a decent price and the food was especially edible and wasn’t crawling with unsavoury life forms. Steve had had one too many run ins with pub food that looked as though it was ready to grow legs and wander off onto the street.
Something terrible had happened.
It was only as he reached the end of the row of stalls that he spotted the books. His heart stuttered against its will in his chest at the blank journals and diaries propped up on the stands. One of them in particular, stood out to him like a beacon of light and Steve couldn’t deny himself the urge to go over there and look at it properly.
Something behind him moved.
Steve had barely seen him since the invitations had been out. He had managed to catch him on his way out of the Tower one morning but there was no time for a conversation. Tony had smiled, wide and brilliant at hearing of Steve’s attendance before swiftly excusing himself for a board meeting. He didn’t want to be paranoid and believe Tony was avoiding him because Tony was a busy man, but it left Steve feeling a little unsettled nonetheless.
The flashback dissipated around him like mist and he was back in the middle of the street, people crowding and crushing him in a crowd surging forward. He sucked in a shaky breath, sweat prickling across his forehead and the hair on the back of his neck was standing on end. He couldn’t face blinking, to see the way Bucky’s hand had slipped on his eyelids. It was enough seeing it at night.
The noise cut through the air, and Steve wasn’t standing in the market any more.
“Have the police been called?” he asked her gently and she nodded frantically, as the young lady holding her piped up, “I called them.”
He blinked when he saw it, perplexed. It couldn’t have been dangerous, he deduced that much; all of the packages and mail were scanned by J.A.R.V.I.S before they entered the building so the likelihood of someone being skilled enough to deceive an A.I was next to none.
“Hello, gorgeous,” Tony's words dripped with such heavy flirtation that Steve's mouth went dry. “Fancy seeing you here.”
He stepped forward and stared in awe around him.
Steve cleared his throat, trying not to focus on the slim gap between their bodies. “You’ve got me mistaken for someone else, I’m afraid,” he said, trying to sound joking but he felt a sharp pang nonetheless.
It was only when he realised of where his train of thought had gone that the reality hit him like the ice.
“Oh no, I caught a glimpse of him earlier but I think he’s disguised himself as a waiter,” she shrugged. “I’ll find him when a tray of drinks or food inevitably gets dropped or dumped on a guest.”
Tony scoffed. “Don’t even go there. It’s more like the other way around,” His fingers gently twined with Steve’s and Steve’s heart stuttered in his chest. “For what it’s worth, I want to go on a date with you. I’ve just been waiting for you to ask.”
Steve sighed, straightening up slightly and closing the journal carefully. It was an old, battered thing; one of the first things he had ever bought himself as a present out of his wages. He could still remember the thrill of having that much money in his pocket, of knowing that he had enough to get him through the week and then some. Pooled with Bucky’s, they felt rich and so much like kings. It hadn’t stopped him from feeling a small sliver of guilt when he paid the man in the shop, for not saving it so he and Bucky could have better. When he had said that to Bucky, Bucky had just laughed and called Steve an idiot. The journal had been worth it, though.
He exhaled. “Soon, maybe, I don’t know,” he replied, wincing as he stumbled over his words. “I hadn’t made up my mind if I was going to tell you in case you don’t-- didn’t feel the same way and I didn’t want to mess us up.”
The woman who had screamed was standing a foot away, her hands clasped over her mouth and was heaving great hulking sobs as she trembled. She looked pale, her cheeks streaked with tears and spattered with drops of red. Another lady had her arms wrapped around her shuddering shoulders, making soft soothing noises as a mother would comforting her babe.
Adrenaline coursed through him as he sprinted. There used to be a time where he couldn’t run like this, not without making him keel over from a chronic asthma attack. Since he took the medication, all that had changed. It helped, really. In a job like this, Steve had to get used to running. There was always one criminal who thought they could escape.
The figure veered right, cutting down another road and Steve ducked through a gap between a lovestruck couple, muttering out an apology when they squawked in alarm. He had closed the gap between them considerably, thanks to his training, but the distance was still not enough for Steve to grab them.
He'd penned a brief reply and ignored the piling envelopes on the kitchen table he never used. Spite, genuine anxiety or avoidance, Steve didn't care to name it but he was more than happy to pretend they didn't exist.
He tried to swing out, but his limbs all at once felt too heavy, and his eyes stung at the effort of trying to keep them open. Whatever had been injected in his system was working damn fast and against his will, he felt himself sinking back into the steady body to keep him upright.
He pushed himself harder, calves and thighs burning from disuse, as he followed the figure around another curve-
Steve fiddled with the wrapper of his protein bar. “Honestly, Nat, I’m beginning to worry I won’t find something in time.”
This whole “taking a break" nonsense was just that;
Hedersett was, in Steve’s opinion, not the worst city he had been to.
So Steve did.
He let out a string of curses that would have made his ma stick a sliver of soap in his mouth. Surely he hadn’t mistaken the turn? No, there was no way he could have.
Steve hadn't been that honest with anyone since he came from the ice. It was scary but it did feel like a weight had been lifted from him oh so slightly. Tony was always there. The antidote to the venom of his mind.
It said a lot, since Steve had been to many cities in Terrahold since his promotion from lowly constable to detective sergeant. He had flitted from his home, to neighbouring towns and bigger cities in the south, on cases or chasing after elusive leads. Sometimes, he and Bucky got to take a day to explore the sights and see all there had to see. Other days, they barely got a chance as they raced through paved streets with pounding hearts and eyes just on their targets. Hedersett was one of the very few he hadn’t had the privilege of visiting but now, he supposed was his chance. Though it didn’t much feel like it.
throw the best Halloween parties in New York.
The seller eyed him coolly. “Now if you ain’t buyin’, get outta here. Don’t need the likes of you ruinin’ my business.”
Hogan moved past him with the gait of a boxer, one that Steve was intimately familiar with. After Bucky’s death and before Peggy’s intervention, Steve had taken up boxing in the rings in Meckport. Usually teeming with the low class criminals but he didn’t care. It wasn’t if he went there to work; he went there to bleed. Most boxers there had a typical walk; they took every step like they were the pinnacle of invincibility.
Steve swallowed thickly as the elevator drew to a smooth halt and the doors slid open to reveal the party.
Again, Steve felt his cheeks warm. “Am I really that obvious?”
So far, sitting in one of Philips’ many safe houses scattered across the region, with just a battered radio and a small influx of letters he couldn't face opening, had done nothing for his supposed crumbling psyche. If anything, Steve felt as though he was heading less in the direction of recovery and more in the direction of the local mental asylum. Twiddling his thumbs in front of a dirty window had stopped being a break and was becoming more and more tedious. Taking walks, sitting in the park while trying to smear graphite on paper in the semblance of an artistic masterpiece now filled Steve's days with a modicum of activity but even they were becoming a bore.
How had Tony figured it out? He had been so careful, acting as if nothing had changed between them. Of course Tony was a genius, but emotions were something Tony definitely struggled with. Steve knew that much, like anybody who managed to get through Tony’s defenses. If someone told Tony they loved him, he’d brush it off and pretend it was never said because he didn’t know how to react.
It was as he went to turn back to Hogan that he caught a flicker of movement out of the corner of his eye, standing on the bend outside the bakery. He stiffened, honing in on the figure who simply stood and appeared to be staring. A curious onlooker to anyone who wasn’t in the police force, but it never paid to be careful.
Tony was still absent and the other Avengers had been strictly instructed to stay on their floors while the preparations went underway. They were to be allowed downstairs throughout staggered slots as the guests arrived, to really up the edge of mystery.
Darcy gave him a look that he couldn’t interpret. “Thank you, sir,” she said and gave her sister’s shoulders a squeeze. “Come on, Janey, let’s get you home.” Without waiting for a reply, she lead her still sobbing sister from the scene of the crime.
"Right," Steve said, because Jarvis seemed to be waiting for a response.  "That's...  Logical?"
"We're registered with the Maria Stark Foundation and Captain's charity of choice, New Yorkers Helping New Yorkers."  Tony gave them a brilliant smile, and another wave of flashes went off.  "We ask that any money that would've been wasted on wedding presents goes there, and Steve'll send you a nice thank you card."
"Technically, I printed that," Duck said, rolling his pen between his fingers. The light glinted across the worn silver finish. "You just wrote it."
“You don’t,” Steve said, amused.  “And second, we might be in Vegas, but we’re not in a Vegas where we can legally sign a marriage license without making a mess of someone else’s life.”
“Yes, ma’am.”
“You deal with any and all magic,” Tony said.
Used to setting his foot and hip checking the door to loosen the sticky hinge before he tried unlocking it.  Inside, his small apartment was dark and still, but the curtains were pushed back from the single window in the kitchen.  Steve gave it a look.  "You better not have broken my window," he said, pushing the door shut behind him, turning to hang his cap on the hook as he flicked on the single bare bulb in the middle of the room.  "Again."
“And Anthony has done everything I’ve asked of him today,” Obie said, his voice quiet.  “The same cannot be said of you.”  Ty’s fingers tightened on the knife, going white knuckled for a moment.  Obie forked up a bite of of beef, and took his time chewing.  “And after your test results today, I think it’s best if he goes over your classwork for you for the rest of the term.”
“Well, get over it, I'm not handling the debrief alone,” Steve told him. He relaxed back against the pillows, stacking his hands on his stomach.
There was a long pause.  “Are these my only options?” Phil called back.
“Explain this again.”
“I suppose so, but you’re responsible for keeping Tony from taking more than two pieces of chocolate,” she said.
In the monochrome emptiness of the room, the dark hair on the pillow next to his came as a shock.
“Try,” Phil said, his voice dry.  “And if a temporal or interdimensional incursion has already occurred?”
Tony glanced up.  The clouds had parted, here and there, fragments of sunbeams cutting through the dark sky.  "Sorry, Cap, don't think that's going to happen today."  He braced a hand on the railing next to Steve's elbow, leaning into it.  Below them, the city was, if not scrubbed clean, than at least refreshed.  The sunlight caught on glass and metal, reflecting the morning into the darkest corners.  Tony smiled.  Maybe a little rain could make things better.
“Are you up?”
The trip to the kitchen and back only took a minute, and if Harris noticed that the icy water bottle nearly slipped from DJ’s fingers when he tried to hand it over, he didn’t say a thing.  He just took the water with a smile and a whispered ‘thank you.’  As DJ sat down on the table again, Harris took a moment to twist the cap free.  The cat, displeased with the interruption, reached out with one paw, smacking his arm.  Harris gave it a look.  “If you claw me, you get no more scritches,” he said, and the cat settled down with a grumble.  “That’s what I thought,” Harris said, and DJ giggled.  Harris grinned at him.  “Works about 50% of the time.”
“What is going on here?”
"I'll see you.  After I eat."  Steve scowled at the empty chair where Tony should be.  "I-"  It had been so much effort, so much planning and so much energy and goddammit, he just wanted to have a nice meal.
Tony moved.
Sam fell into step beside him, a towel thrown over his shoulder, and his running shoes dangling from one hand.  “Figured there were enough people talking over each other in that room, you didn't need to hear it from one more smartass.”
“Don’t forget the post script,” Tony said.
“A rich man that wants to look poor will change everything except his shoes and assume no one’ll notice.” Billy grinned.  “Shoes like that?  He had money, which is likely why Hammer was talking to him, after all.”
“The funny thing to me is, that you’ve got a reputation for being a good liar, when in fact, you’re so, so bad at it,” Steve said, and Tony bit back a smile.  “I’ll tell her you were worried.”
Steve fell into step beside her.  "What do you mean, 'my first?'"
Tony made a face.  “Okay, that's true, that's, that's almost fair, but-” He headed back towards the elevator, his feet eating up the distance with a nervous sort of efficiency.  “Look, I don't want to be involved, but I also don't want to be excluded, I mean, that's only common sense, Jarvis!”
Stark took a deep breath, one hand resting on his chest, over the arc reactor.  His fingers bounced against the fabric of his shirt.  “I don’t forgive him.  But I don’t think I need to forgive him.  What I needed to do, and this was, this was me, what I had to do was acknowledge that how I was raised, the relationship the two of us has, it wasn’t right.  To be a better parent than he was, to be a better father, I had to just…”  He stopped, his eyes closing.  “Had to make a different choice.”
“I will, and if I can’t, I’m sure you will.”  She handed him a box that apparently contained a curled up pottery kitten.  “I have faith.”  She looked up.  “Rogers, you’re next?”
Pepper made no effort to hide her smirk.  Tony pointed a finger in her direction.  “Not a word,” he said.  “Fine.  You’re all allergic to fun.  That’s your problem, not mine.”
“And she took Peter’s hand, and told him stories about his uncle, and lead him just a few steps away, probably so I could give Mr. Stark a piece of my mind without him hearing.  But before I could get a word out, he plowed straight into his offer.
“Wait,” Tony said, squinting at Isaiah.  “You can control him.  You-”  He stabbed a finger at Isaiah.  “You can make him STOP.”
So, that had been a trap.
Rogers continued to move, stiff and more than a little awkward, his jaw set in a stubborn line.  "I do all right for myself," he said, and it was such a transparent lie that Tony struggled not to laugh.
“Are you going to glare at me the whole time?”
Steve’s eyes flicked open, his heart in his throat.
“In our own charming way, yes, I think we do,” Steve said.  He held out a hand.  “Don’t suppose I can get a hug, here?”
“Yes,” DJ said, one hand in Tony’s, the other still holding Tony’s jacket in place.   He smiled up at Tony, and Tony smiled back.
Happy tossed the cigar off of the pier with a flick of his fingers.  “You took your sweet time,” he said, as the slim figure pulled her mask off.
“Welcome,” DJ said.  When Steve let him go, he settled down between Steve and Tony on the couch.  “Thor?”
“Legal,” the blonde said.
“There’s no defending that,” Greer told her.
Stark nodded.  “Who’re we ducking?”
Roughly a year ago, Sam and I commissioned Grumpycakes to do little drawings of Foodieverse!Steve and Tony.  Sam went...  Horribly hipster in his (don't you @ me, Starbuck, that mustache is a travesty) and I asked for a Tony more reminiscent of Anthony Bourdain, who had died just a few months before.  I liked the idea of Tony collecting ink, especially on his arms, where he would see it when he rolled up his sleeves to cook.  All the bits of his culinary history, some of the people who got him to this point in his life.
Bright eyes darted in his direction, and she gave him a winning smile.  “Cool.  I’ll take one of each.”  She braced an arm on the edge of the window, leaning to the side.  “Hey, Tony.”
“We’ll get him back,” Steve said.  Tony nodded, but his eyes were empty.
Obie gave him a tight lipped smile.  “Things must certainly be...”  He paused, his teeth flashing in a smile.  “Boisterous in your dining room.”
Tony blinked at him.  “No, it wasn't-”
Mrs. Parker was seated on the bottom step of the grand staircase, her back leaning against the carved newel post, a basket of apples next to her feet.  There was a bowl in her lap, cradled in a tea towel, and another by her side, full of peeled fruit.  She was watching the boys, a faint smile on her face, while she ran a knife under the delicate skin of the fruit
Stark didn’t ask who ‘he’ was.  “I didn’t.  I don’t.  I-”  He took a deep breath.  “It’s more complicated than that, I suppose.  I just-  I figured out that what I needed, he couldn’t give me.  And what he could give me, I didn’t really…  I didn’t want it.  He never figured that out, and neither did I.  At least, not when he was alive.  I was looking for something that I was never going to get, and that fucking sucks, but it’s not my fault.  It might not even be his.”
The song had ended, and he didn't know when, because Tony was still with him, following his lead, holding his hand.  He glanced up at Steve, his eyebrows arched, and things needed to be said, and Steve didn't know how to say them.
“Besides,” Jessica said, dusting her hands off on her thighs, “this is just a daily occurrence for most of us.” She met Steve's eyes, her gaze flat.  “At least during a fight, we can punch our local oversharing assholes.”
Clint was laughing now, his shoulders shaking.  “You’re not asking the right questions,” he said, and Steve gave him a look.  “The question you should be asking is, why are you a French Chef, despite being neither French, nor a chef?”
She pointed her pencil in his direction, her head still bent over her ledger.  “That’s nice of you,” she said.
"If everyone wears a mask," Steve said, "then everyone's safe."  The boy nodded, his teeth flashing in a grin.  Steve smiled back.  "Safety in numbers."
"'S okay," he said, and it was.  It mostly was.  He sucked in a slow breath from between his teeth, trying to focus on the wiring in front of him.  That, at least, was orderly and understandable, easy for him to compartmentalize and control.  He slid a fingertip along the length of a wire, tracing its path from the power source.  "We did work."  It wasn't quite right, he knew it, even as he was saying it, but he couldn't quite work out where the missing words were.
Jan leaned in on Steve’s other side, her hand braced on his shoulder.  “No, it’s asking for the number of pastry types.”  She frowned.  “Isn’t it?  The boxes-”
She blinked at him.  "I need him."
Steve moved to the door.  Natasha’s eyebrow twitched up, a flicker of movement, but she didn’t object when he braced his hands on either side of the doorframe, effectively blocking all escape.  “What happened with Clint and the Pixy Stix?”
“We’ll see.  Depends on how it turns out,” Tony said, moving the spoon through the white sauce.  Steve reached out, brushing a fingertip against the inside of Tony’s wrist.  Laughing, Tony twitched his hand away.  “Can I help you?”
“Because you fed it,” Sam said, spreading his hands.  “You gave it food.”
DJ reached out, petting Clint’s unicorn.  “Everything,” he said, smiling back.
“He has school today, sir.”
Tony smiled.  “Okay.  So.  How do we make this better?”  He kicked his legs out in front of him.  “Too loud.  Too big.  Too many people.  Too much.”  He looked up, up at the ceiling above them, the germ of an idea forming in his head.  “Let’s go upstairs.”
“Fine.” Tony threw himself into his library chair, his head pounding already.  “So.  What is this about?”
Jess stood up, taking it out of her hand with a flick of her fingers.  “No,” she said her voice stern.  She’d folded her copy of the catering menu into a hat, and now it perched on top of her dark, wavy hair.  She made it work some how.
“Right,” Tony said.  He took a deep breath.  “Tell you what.  You.  Me.  Egg cream. There’s gotta be a sketchy ice cream counter left in this city.”
“DJ?”
The feed flickered, and came back after a moment of all-encompassing darkness.  When it did, the visual shook, as if the camera recording it was shaking in its housing.  What was left of the lobby's windows collapsed, glass crashing to the ground as a huge, misshapen shape of a robot pushed its way in.
He dipped his spoon into the soup, stirring it and watching the steam rise from the surface.  “And do not take gold from their hand.  In the light of day, you’ll find you’ve sold your soul for a fallen leaf or hedgeberry, shriveled and brittle.”
“You were still awake, weren’t you?” Steve asked, already knowing the answer.  He drained the rest of his coffee, more out of a sense of obligation than for any real desire to drink it.  He stood up, heading to the bathroom to toss it it the trash can.
“Yeah, well, don’t say I’ve never done anything for you,” Steve said, heading for the closet.  A moment later, he was heading for the door, shrugging the sweatshirt into place.  He pushed the front door open and came to screeching halt.
Hank groaned.  “He wasn’t-”
“If you want to help, you can help sweep the curb,” Sam said.  “That needs doing right now.”
“No, wait-” Steve said, right before she slipped around him and threw the door open, stepping through it without even slowing down.  “Damn it, Jan!”  Behind him, Sam started humming, and Steve gave him a look.  “Not funny.”
Steve reached up, touching the rim.  “She does remarkable work.”
Tony took a deep breath.  “I can’t keep him safe.” It wasn’t what he’d meant to say, but he was exhausted, aching down to his bones, and he was tired of pretending otherwise.  “I can’t…”  He shook his head.  “I’m supposed to keep him safe, and I can’t, not if he…”
“I love that weird little man,” Isaiah said, sliding rows of cinnamon rolls onto gleaming racks.  “His garlic bread mix should be illegal.”
"Betrayed?" Steve asked, still grinning.
He scraped up the last of the soup, tipping the bowl to gather it together.  “So it's none of my business, now is it, if you're-”  He waved his spoon at them.  “Together.”
Steve opened one eye to peer at him.  "You know this is a lie drunk people tell themselves, right?"
Pepper rubbed a hand over her face.  “Why are all of your friends so…” She stopped, and sighed.  “So much like you?”
“No,” Steve mumbled, just to be difficult.
"That it is."  Tony drained the rest of his coffee and tossed the cup back on the workbench.  He slid down off of his stool, stretching his arms over his head.  Everything ached, and he set his hands at the small of his back, trying to work out the kinks in his spine.  "All right, my flatfooted friend, you win."
“Because done right, done the way it’s meant to be done, both of those cuisines are as labor intensive, as specialized, as carefully considered, as any French or German meal you’re likely to get.  The skill required, the knowledge, the labor, it’s all there, but we expect these cuisines to be cheap because we as a country vastly undervalue the worth of the labor provided by Chinese and Mexican people.”
She looked at Steve.  "All the child knows is, they need something, and they're not getting it.  Maybe when Marish is older, they'll be able to understand why their parents struggled with this.  Maybe not.  But right now?  That's not their problem.  Their problem is the rest of the world."
Steve stifled a laugh.  “Mermaid.  I'll find an octopus for you next time.”  He peeked over the top of the stairs, but there was no movement from the bed.  “Okay, I'm going to be quiet now.  So I don't wake your dad.”  DJ nodded, his face going serious.
“You're determined to make me insane, you know that?” Tony asked, because the alternative was to crawl up his chest and kiss him until one or both of them passed out.
DJ was thrown backwards, crashing into a chair and making a desperate grab for the edge of the conference table to keep himself on his feet. He slipped slowly down to the floor, hitting with a muted thump.  And he sat there, staring up at the portal, his face blank.
“For that, I do apologize,” he said.  He looked at DJ.  “I would never have let you in if I truly thought you were in any danger.”  He took a deep breath.  “You know that, don’t you?”
Tony saluted him with his glass.  “Truer words have never been spoken.”
Harris nodded back.  “Okay. Okay.”  He bit his lip.  “Look, DJ.  When we’re scared, a lot of things go through our heads.  A lot of people do and say and think things, when they’re scared, that they wouldn’t, otherwise.  And when you were scared, you just wanted to be safe.”
“We’re in public,” Harris said, his voice strained.  “That was-”
This time, the silence stretched a little longer.  "You already ordered," Tony said at last.
The man pushed himself up out of his chair.  It took about five minutes for him to get fully upright, and once he was there, he stopped, as if he'd forgotten why he bothered.  Tony stared at him.  He stared back.  "Wait here," he said at last, picking up both of their passports and their Avengers paperwork.  Then, without another word, he toddled off towards a door in the rear of the customs office.
Steve stared at him.  Sam's smile stretched.  “Turn on the charm, Steve.  Show him what you've got to offer.  Be the best husband you can manage.” He kicked his legs out in front of him. “Get out there and woo the fuck out of that man.”
Steve's lips curled up, his face softening.  “You can't always trust Jarvis.”
“I’m driving,” Tony said, and she shook her head.
In the silence that followed, Steve just focused on the sound of his breathing.  It seemed obscenely loud in the narrow confines of the bathroom.
One shoulder rose in a shrug.  “Chop my hair short, put on the right sort of clothes, and take the truck.  I’d say that it was something I had to do, if I wanted to be a runner, but the truth of the matter is-”  She spread her arms wide.  “This felt just as natural as a dress.”
"NING!" Duck's voice rang out over the newsroom floor. She glanced over to find him standing in the door of his office, one hand braced against the wood. "My office. Now."
“I could help,” Tony offered.
“Are you trying to kill me?”  Tony picked it up anyway, tossing his phone back to the dashboard.  It never stopped buzzing.
“Which is why we’re making the offer,” Strange said.
“Nothing,” Tony said.  “Absolutely-”
“It is both,” Jarvis agreed.  “DJ had a nightmare.  He requires human intervention.”
Tony glanced back at him, the light catching on the plane of his cheek, on the angle of his jaw.  “It’s fine,” he said, and he was still moving, moving away, and Steve’s anxiety spiked.
Franklin spun her in a circle.  “You are so loud,” he said, before setting her back on her feet.
“No,” Steve said.
Jan made a face.  “Isn’t a movie rather…  Ordinary?”
Ellen glared at it.  "Is it possible to take a bad picture of this man?" she asked.
There was a beat, and then, “No.  He is in the workshop,” Jarvis said.
Tony made a disapproving sound under his breath.  He rolled over, onto his uninjured side, but he kept hold of Steve’s hand, dragging him along with him.  Startled, Steve allowed himself to be tugged into place, and when the settled, he found himself tucked up against Tony’s back, his arm resting on Tony’s waist, just below his bandages.
There was something intimate about their posture, about the way that the black edges of their formal clothes seemed to bleed into each other, like there not fully separate entities.  In the middle of a party, of a celebration, they were still, they were seeing only each other.
Rhodey saluted him with his cup.  “Steve?  You bring these things?  And I’ll give you whatever intel you need.”  He picked up the croissant and took a healthy bite.  “Whatever you want to know.”
“He was one of our witnesses, but we're still not quite sure he knows,” Miss Ports said, her eyes dancing.  “He was...”  She glanced at Rhodes.  “Distracted.”
"Really."  Pepper braced her elbow on the arm of the chair and propped her chin on her hand.  "And how will I know?"
He stopped, his face crumbling for an instant. For a moment, just a moment, he looked young, and hurt, and heartbroken. He straightened up, and it was gone. “I need you, Tony. I don't have many friends. And you're-” His lips twitched, trying for a smile. “You're the one I depend on.”
Clint winced.  “I can explain.”
“Just keeping everyone on the same page,” he said, putting the cap back on his sharpie.  She affixed the tag reading ‘Elvis’ to her jumpsuit.
Steve’s stomach was churning, an ugly suspicion percolating.  “And you didn’t see his face?”
“I like me.  Then again, I'm the only decent ex you've got,” Pepper said.  “And I'd prefer we keep your current relationship from becoming an 'ex' situation, so can I please-”
“I believe I can manage,” Tony said.  Jarvis arched his eyebrows.  “I can manage, Jarvis.”
Tony waved him off.  “Messing about in futures and options, mostly,” he said.  “Which isn’t a problem.”
"You're a very lucky little boy," Obie said, slicing into his roast beef.  He gave DJ a tight lipped smile.  "In my day, children took their meals in the nursery until they could carry on a decent conversation and had some manners."
She made the sign of the cross, rough fingers flicking across her body like a bird’s wings.  “A right blessing, that man was,” she said.  “Patient as a Saint, too, took him near to forever to get me to talk to him.”  She gave Steve a chiding look.  “Man shows up with a load of food and claims you sent him, and you didn’t say a word about it?  I think I can be forgiven for taking that with a grain of salt.”
“He's clever, not modest,” Rogers said, reaching out to ruffle DJ's hair.  “Too late for swimming, today, it's almost dinner.  You've wasted all day tinkering, and now we've only got an hour or so before we have to get cleaned up and dress for dinner.”
“He seems so wholesome, it's true,” Jan said.
“We haven’t been much help,” Steve said.
“Nothing.”  She leaned forward, her arms braced on her legs. “You sure?”
"You need to eat your breakfast, sir," Jarvis said, disapproval obvious in his voice.  He set the tray over Tony's lap.  "All of it."
“Does Tony know you call them playdates?” Steve asked.
“Your job is to plant yourself.  Like a tree beside the river of truth, and tell the whole world-”
“Not open to constructive criticism?” Fury asked, a faint smile tugging at his mouth.
“Thank you,” Carol said.  “Really.”  She reached over, clasping his hand in both of hers.  “Thank you.”
“I don't think you're cute at all,” Tony told him.  Bucky made kissy faces at him.  “Right, now, now you're actively freaking me out.”
Bruce took it from him, a very tired look on his face.  “Really,” he said, and there was a pleading note to the single word.  “Really, we’re telling the nice police officer, uh, how you-” His eyes flicked towards Steve, his expression wary.   “How you got your job?”
“I’ll fight you for them,” Moondragon said, tossing her magazine down.
Tony pointed at the tray, and followed the clerk back to the counter.  He produced a small polishing cloth and smoothed it over the surface of the ring before holding it out to Tony, still cradled within the hollow of the soft fabric.
“Doesn’t much matter what he intended, but I suspect you’re right,” Nicholas said.  He leaned back in his chair, folding his hands over his stomach.  “We’d been at war for a long time.  People were tired.  They were scared.  And a few of the nobles were starting to get above themselves, weren’t they?  Gathering power, consolidating their holds on their lands, and the troops under them.”
Darcy set the container of fruit cup delicately on the cafeteria counter.  “I’m gonna need you to de-grape this,” she said.   Benito looked up, his expression disbelieving, and Darcy grinned at him.  “Grapes are nasty.”  She nudged it with one fingertip.  “Nasty.”
“And this is why you're my favorite,” Tony told her.  She gave him a slight wave, turning back up the hall.  Tony took one step towards the elevator, and then paused.  “Nat?”  She looked back at him.  “Who's the one who put my name in the pool?  You know?  After Pepper?”
“I need everyone to stop asking me that,” Steve said.  He glanced at Tony, his mouth a thin line, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Sorry.”
DJ considered the front doors of the nearest hotel.  “Heist,” he said.
“It's okay, you've got a backer with deep pockets,” Tony said.
Tony choked on a laugh.  "I do like a cautious businessman."  He paused.  "I'm not one.  But I like them."  He triggered the armor's release, and stepped out of it, rolling his neck.  "Just going to park that before I end up cracking a display case," he said, hooking a thumb over his shoulder at the armor.  "Let me know if its in the way."
Steve reached for the pizza.  "What...  Is this?"  He frowned as the scene cut to a man standing at in front of a tv showing the same thing they'd just been watching.  He leaned forward.  “What-”  A bevy of bikini clad girls marched past in perfect unison.
“I vote we hire someone to clean up,” Jess said.
DJ looked back.  Darcy didn’t move, but she said, “Thanks.  For finding him.”
Tony choked on a laugh, a hand coming up to cover his face, and Steve nodded.  “It’s like that Three Stooges skit where they get stuck in a doorway?  And they’re all flailing desperately to get loose, to go forward or to go back, all the legs and arms waving in the air?” He paused.  “It’s like that.  Except.  It’s just me.”
"And he's got a few of the city leaders in his pocket.  So your duty gets assigned by me, and mine gets assigned by the commissioner, and I bet you know where he gets his assignments."  Captain O'Brian smacked a hand against his desk.  Steve's teeth locked, and O'Brien gave him a sympathetic look.  "Just skip that street on your patrols, if it bothers you so much.  But I'm getting tired of smoothing his feathers."
Peter obligingly put his hands over his ears, and Tony’s eyes rolled up towards the ceiling.  “Parker.  Not you.” He pointed at DJ, who was taking in this new development with his usual wide eyed curiosity.  “DJ.”
And a single girl, sitting next to the window, a paper cup in one hand and a big, goofy robot plush toy balanced on her knees.  Her head swung in Harris’ direction, her dark hair sliding over one shoulder as she blinked at him, her expression quizzical.
“The damn greenhouse,” she agreed, as they ducked through the doors and down the stairs to the kitchen.  It was quiet and still now, a pot of coffee on a back burner and a napkin covered basket the only sign of the chaos to come in the morning.  Bobbi paused, just long enough to fish a scone from the basket, tossing one to Steve and taking one for herself.
“It was not my idea.” Tony reached out, his hand coming to rest on Steve’s thigh. “And in my defense, I did leave a note.”
“I’d be in a SHIELD meeting, bored out of my skull, and I should be paying attention, I know I should be paying attention,” Steve said, the words coming faster and faster.  “And instead of processing what Maria’s saying, I’m wondering if Tony’s at the office today.  If he has plans for lunch.  Maybe I could text him.  If he’s in the office, we could meet downtown.  If he’s at the tower, I could bring something back with me.
“Yes, but you are my problem,” Pepper said.  Her foot tapped against the tile.  “Fine.  Last resort.”
“Why are you trying to get rid of me?”
“No,” Tony told him.
There was a soft, hesitant tap on the door, and then the usher peered inside.  “Sir?  I brought-”
There was a long moment of silence.
“And when you are at the end of your rope, there’s always a little voice in the back of your head.  Whispering that no.  You can make him obey.  You can make him behave.  You can make him do what you want him to do.”  Stark took a deep breath.  “All you have to do is make him afraid.”  He looked down at his hands, one flexing into a fist.
“Sorry to interrupt,” she said.  “But Clint just took a knife to the lights.”
“Yeah, I'm going to listen to Pepper.”
Sam lead the way down a side street.  “Wait here,” he said.  “I’ll get Danvers, she’ll want to talk to you both before we head back to the cottage.”  Without waiting for a response, he touched his heels to his horse’s side and cantered away.
Tony fished his pocket watch out of his vest pocket, frowning down at it.  “Never,” he said. “And I think I have a meeting-”
Tony shook his head, grabbing the railing with one hand and pulling himself upright, the muscles of his arm pulling taut.  “There’s no ‘close enough’ when it comes to timekeeping, sir,” he said, swinging his body up to brace one foot on the railing and the other on the side of the building next door.  Precariously balanced between the two, he peered up into the mechanism above his head.  The pulley system that allowed the awning to be retracted had clearly failed, and Tony tugged at the knotted cord.   “Precision.  One should strive for precision.”
He fell silent, listening intently.  “See, Phil agrees with you, just get it done.” He nodded.  “He’s pragmatic.” His eyes caught Phil’s, and he grinned.  “Goal-oriented.  That’s your son.  Get it over with, and stop worrying about it.”
One of Pepper's shoulders rose in a half-shrug.  “Split on expected lines.  The religious right and the conservative sites are treating it like the downfall of Western civilization.”
Miss Potts blinked at him.  "Are you all right?" she asked.
“And I’ll get it, once I’ve talked to a few others.” Strange glanced from one to the other, and there was strain on his face, the lines beside his eyes and bracketing his mouth carved deep.  “They’re expecting me, and any further delay…”
“I'd like to imagine they won't get sued as often as most of the people we know,” Sue said.
“Please don't make people think you do sex stuff with birds,” Jess told him.  “Because then they'll start asking me and Nat about if you do sex things with birds, and wow.  Not having that conversation.”
And he didn't know if he wanted to.
"Right," Steve said, his lips twitching.  He took a deep breath.  "I just wanted one nice dinner, Tony.  One.  Nice meal.  Alone.  Just..."  His voice trailed away, his shoulders slumping.  "Merry Christmas."
“Yes, you’re clearly a well adjusted young man who has caused absolutely no problem for this household,” Tony groused.  “Just, you know, eating your weight in pastry daily and destroying my orchards-”
“Okay, admittedly, that's a pretty good defense,” Tony said, making Steve laugh.  “Atlantic City.”
He ignored the way his stomach turned over. “Right.” He reached for a rag.  “Is this the part of the morality tale where I have to admit that by hurting myself, I’m hurting them too?”
Tony slammed through a set of double doors and nearly crashed into Bruce.
Steve ignored him.  “It’s important,” he said.  And that wasn’t enough.  That wasn’t nearly enough.  There was something hard and sharp lodged in his throat, and he could feel his pulse pounding in his temples, something beyond anger, beyond fear making his chest ache.  He held out a hand.  “It’s important to me.  Give it back.  Now.”
“What is wrong with you?  Seriously?” Sam asked, and Steve was laughing as he headed back to the ballroom.
“Done.” Tony rocked his weight back and forth on the balls of his feet, desperate to move and yet unable to bear leaving the room. One of the network suits glared in his direction. Tony ignored him, because, seriously, fuck that guy. He was lucky Tony hadn't stormed the stage and tackled Steve to the ground.
“His ears go pink at the slightest provocation,” Tony mused.  His head tipped to the side, his fertile brain coming up with a few rather racy images about just how he could make the good officer turn beet red.  “How far down do you suppose it goes? Because his neck gets all-”
He found Steve's shoes first, deserted on the floor of the living room.  One was tumbled against the wall, the other a dozen feet away, the laces trailing behind it.  The doors to the balcony was open, and Steve, dressed in a pair of running shorts and a white t-shirt, was outside, his arms spread wide and his face tipped up, letting the rain wash over his flushed skin.
Steve handed one over.  “I think I can be forgiven for wanting to know how Stark ended up with a French chef who wasn’t a chef, or French.”
Logan glanced down.  “Ah.  Right.”  He flexed his fingers, and the claws retracted.  “Sorry 'bout that.”
DJ smiled. “Okay,” he said, as Strange stepped through the portal.  Pausing only long enough to grab his backpack, DJ took a step forward, hitting the portal at a jog.
“Well, that's pretty rude,” Luke said.  He was struggling not to grin. “Don't do that.”
Jan peered at him over the top of her clipboard.  “I get all the fun parts of party planning, and none of the cleanup,” she said, flicking the quill at him.  “When it’s over, I get to leave.”
Tony reached in, and ripped a circuit board loose, sending a shower of sparks across the concrete floor.  Luke jerked backwards, his eyes wide, and Tony grinned in his direction.  “We're good,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.
Her lips twitched, something almost like a smile. "Still, my point holds, Captain, there's certain things that didn't used to be talked about in public, and I don't know why everything has to now be-" Her hands fluttered through the air as if she was attempting to ward something off. "Why everyone has to know everyone's business now."
Tony stalked around the corner of the couch, and Clint tumbled over the back, disappearing behind it.  His voice echoed out.  “You’re the best, Pep.”  His head popped up.  “No.”  He gave Tony a pitying look.  “He’s not dying.”
Steve froze in the doorway, his hand still holding the doorknob.  Tony froze, Jan plastered against his front, her lips mere inches from his.  There was a moment of stillness.  Steve’s eyes darted from Tony to Jan and back, a faint crease between his brows.  “Am I…  Interrupting?” he said at last.
Tony tried to smile.  “Now who's telling tales out of school?”
“We’re being healthy when it involves melon,” Darcy said.  She straightened up, her head tipping towards the prep area behind the serving counter.  “Benito!  My man!  I need a tiny favor, teeny-tiny, not even worth-”
“I think we can make an exception,” Wanda said, and Agatha reached out, rapping her on the knuckles with the handle of her spoon.  Giggling, Wanda held her hands out of reach.  “She wouldn’t be the worst student you’ve taken on.”
He skidded around the corner, only to stop short, his heart in his throat.  Tony was sprawled out on the floor, his shoulders braced against a cabinet, his face pale and damp with sweat.  A glass lay on the floor, just out of reach, water splashed across the tile.
“This may shock you, Steven, but I do not give a damn about the milk.” Tony pulled him into the elevator and immediately maneuvered him up against the wall.  Steve tugged him close, leaning in for a kiss.  “I love you.”
Marcy studied him.  “Even if we announce it was a bad joke,” she said, and her voice was gentle, “there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.  Even if we said it was an accident, even if started divorce proceedings today, there are always going to be those who will say that you're closeted, that you're repressed, and you thought you could pull off a secret marriage.  There will always be rumors from today forward, that you're gay, or bisexual.”
“Don't get into trouble,” Pepper said. “And remember we have ladders.
“Maybe we should let him win next month,” Carol said.  She put a pen between her upper lip and her nose, and Jess giggled.
“I wanted everyone out of my house, is a bit closer to the truth,” Stark said.  For a moment, he was silent, the toe of one boot bouncing against the top of the billiard table.  Finally, he nodded.  “Fine.  Poke around to your heart's content, Officer.  Any locked doors, I expect you to respect, but other than that-” He waved a hand through the air.  “Just stay out of the way.”
Okoye muttered a curse under her breath as Shuri galloped ahead of them, her body bent low over her horse’s neck.   “Highness, you should not-” But Shuri just raised a hand, waving after her.
“Och, and that always goes so well for us, doesn’t it?” his mother said.  But she was laughing, so it was okay.  She turned her attention back to her pot of soup, shaking her head as the steam curled around her face.  “What brought this up?”
Everyone in the room turned to look at him.  Darcy.  Clint.  DJ.  Steve.  And two almost identical Tony Starks.
Steve stared him down, his jaw locked.
DJ nodded.
“It's Friday, and you were expelled from work,” Steve said.  “I talked to DJ and-”
“No,” Tony said, but he had already handing them over.  “Let’s go, you vultures.  Maaagicon time.”
Tony braced a hand on the railing.  “Hi,” he said.  “How’s the mission going?”
Tony pointed his coffee cup in Rogers' direction.  “You, sir, should not doubt Jarvis.”
DJ considered that.  “Just one?”
Steve tipped the envelope up, and a small hardcover book slid into his hand.  On the yellow cover, a simple picture of a pirate had been stamped in black ink.  He turned the book over in his hands.  “'The Dark Frigate,'” he read aloud.  The cover wasn't familiar, but the title sent a spark of recognition through him.  “Oh, my God...”
“We’re good,” Greer said with a grin.  “Just strategizing.”
“Tell me you've got spring rolls.”
“Give it here,” he said.  “We’re going full on Iron Cat.”
“Great!” Sam dumped a healthy measure of coffee into his cup.  “I'll grab my shoes.”
“I’m sure you’ll get a strongly worded memo about fiscal responsibility,” Steve said.
DJ's head came up first, emerging from a pile of blankets.  He blinked owlishly at Steve, his face scrunched up, and Steve smiled at him.  “Morning, lazybot,” he said.  DJ yawned and tried to sit up, slipping off the edge of the couch to land on the ground with a thump.
"Yes," Steve said, because he as an idiot, he was absolutely an idiot.  And he might be a lousy liar, but he was a stubborn liar.  He reached for the big, leatherbound menu that the maitre d' had left within reach.  "No idea what I ordered.  It's all in-"  He squinted down at the menu.  "In French."
“Hypothetical, Clint,” Natasha said, smiling down at her phone.
Steve kissed his neck again.  “I love you,” he said, and Tony's shoulders twitched.  Steve smiled against his skin.  “I love you.”
Obie, who’d just stepped into the billiard room, moved out of her way.  “My apologies, Mrs. Parker.”  He nodded in Steve’s direction, but his attention was focused on Tony.  “Officer.”
Jarvis was moving to intercept Obie before he was fully through the sickroom door.  “Mr. Stane, please.  As I explained, sir needs a moment-”
“Jan, I-”
The faint tapping on the door brought his head up.
He paused a moment, and Tony grinned at him.  “Do it,” he said.
“I'm doing my best,” Steve said.  He took a deep breath.  “Want to dance?  With me?” he asked Tony, the words coming out a little too fast, stumbling over themselves.  Tony blinked at him, and Steve stopped, his hands flexing at his sides.  “Sorry.  Let me try that again.”
“Big jar?” DJ asked, as Tony took both his hands and lifted him up and off the stool.  For a second, DJ’s legs kicked in midair and then he was back on the ground.
“Everyone’s getting a bad tourist t-shirt,” Steve said.  “Can I talk to Tony if speakerphone is involved?”
Tony winced.  "Was I charming, though?"
Tony took a breath.  “I promise,” he said, because he was adept at two things: lying to himself, and forcing reality into whatever form he wanted it to take.  His hand smoothed over Steve's hair, and even that casual contact hurt.  “Go to sleep.”  He made himself smile.
“You’re moving forward, and that’s something to be celebrated.”
“Deej, you want to come?” Tony asked, and DJ held up his hands, wiggling his fingers.  “Ah, I see that Mrs. Parker already scrubbed you down.’
"Yes."
“No.  We’re not.”  Tony sighed.  “We’re going to fight sometimes, Deej.  That’s…  That’s going to happen.”
“You ask the impossible,” Franklin said, even as he crept up behind Val, his hands up above his head.  Before Val could realize he was there, he was throwing his arms around her waist, hugging her tight and lifting her bodily off of her stool.  Val let out a shriek, her legs kicking wildly, but she was grinning, too.
DJ looked from him to Steve and back.  “Are you going to fight?”
Tony was silent for a long moment.  "Come on out," he said.  "I'll meet you back at the tower, we'll get a pizza and put on 'It's a Wonderful Life' and-"
“Uh-huh.” Rhodey took his book back, flipping it back around in his hands.  “You should be used to that by now.”
“Put on some tight jeans and a pair of boots and we'll talk,” Tony said.  “Jan, who are all these people?”
Steve wrenched the door open, squinting against faint light of the hall.  “Here,” he finished, the word falling almost silently out of his mouth as the figure in front of him turned to face him, and Steve’s stomach bottomed out.
The door to the kitchen opened with a thud, and Peter stumbled through, both of his hands gripping the doorknob as if he was using it to keep himself upright.  The side of his face was already turning an unfortunate shade of muddy gray-green, his eye swollen almost shut behind the crooked frames of his glasses.  “Is it-”
Steve's shoulders shifted beneath the expertly tailored fabric of his suit jacket.  "Depends on the situation."
There was a long moment of silence.  “Wow,” Harris said, because he couldn’t seem to come up with anything better to say.
Steve met his eyes.  “I promise,” he whispered, and then pushed himself to his feet.  “I’ll be back as soon as I can.  But for now, I’ve gotta go back.  You know how the neighborhood gets when I’m not there to walk my beat.”
There was a chuckle, from somewhere in a crowd, then a snort of laughter.  The thug rocked back on his heels, gesturing towards Happy with the tip of his club.  “Put him in the drink,” he said, his voice almost amused.  “Maybe that’ll sober him up.”
She studied him.  “Clint is very enthusiastic about getting you an annulment,” she said, and Tony groaned, his head falling back.  Natasha's lips twitched.  “I'll try to rein him in.”
“It's a slight exaggeration,” Tony said.  “But only about the women.”  He tried to smile.  “Are you-”
He pushed himself away from the counter.  “Like, everyone?”
Tony stretched his legs out in front of him.  “When she died, I used to come here and lie on that sofa and smell her perfume, until the scent faded.”  He took a deep breath.  “Then I didn’t come here again.”
Something like a giggle came from the depths of the blankets.  "Yes."
DJ looked up.  “Didn't want him in the workshop.”  His nose scrunched up.  “Didn't like him.”
“He should’ve expected that and compensated.  God knows I’ve had more than one smoothie cup tossed at my head over the years.” Tony leaned back into Steve’s body, needing the support more than he needed air at that second.  He took a deep breath.  “All right.  Enough.”  Enough what, he wasn’t sure.  Enough panic.  Enough emotion.  Enough forced inactivity.  He met Stephen’s eyes, his jaw set.  “What are we doing?”
“Yes, but-”
“Like, out LOUD,” Harris said.  “Where other people could hear.”
Steve choked on a laugh. "I hear alcohol helps," he admitted. "Which is why we've sent Happy to a bar."
“Don't,” he said, holding his hands out. “Pep, don't, it's not-” He smiled, and it hurt, but it that was fine, that was right. “Pep. You are the best thing that ever happened to me. You never-” His smile stretched. “You never left me. Not really. Not in any way that matters.”
Tony watched him, one eyebrow arching.  “Maybe some food to go with that,” he suggested, as Obie tossed back the rest of the whiskey in one gulp.
Obie coughed, his head falling forward.  His cheeks were flushed, his eyes bright.  “Don’t you judge me, boy,” he said with a smile, refilling his glass.  The aspirin tin clicked against the decanter, and he tossed it aside.
Sam dropped his hands.  “I think he’s trying, in his own-”  He shook his head.  “Special way, to convince me to give you a chance.”
Shiro poured the noodles into the broth with a twist of his wrist and reached for the bins of toppings.  He added neat piles of sliced green onion, bean sprouts, seaweed and a fishcake, then sliced an egg in half with a quick flick of his knife.  He settled the halves against the bed of noodles and set the bowl on the counter in front of Peter.  “Enjoy,” he said, pushing the jar of disposable chopsticks into reach.
Tony straighened up.  "Can I-”  He waved a hand up at the couch  “Can I join you?" he asked, his voice quiet.  DJ nodded again, his toes flexing against the fabric of the couch.  Tony smiled.  "Thank you."
“Shouldn't have let them show Rocky Horror on movie night,” he said.
Tony took a fistful.  “As a distraction, this is subpar, MacIntyre.”
"Oh, really?  You don't know what I'm talking about?"  Sam made a humming sound under his breath, his body rocking backwards as he crossed his arms over his chest.  "Maybe the 'jumping out of a plane without a parachute' thing?  Or the 'trying to stop a car with your body' thing?  Or the 'trying to punch a demi-god' thing?"
Tony's eyebrows rose.  "It...  It was dirtier than this before?" he asked, because he wasn't sure he believed that at all.
“Late,” she said, fingers tapping on the head of the cane.  “As usual.  Sit down.”
Okoye’s head rolled in his direction, her eyes narrowed into slits.  “You,” she said, her voice full of doom.  “I blame you for all of this.”
Tony drained the last sip of his coffee and headed for the coffee maker, glad for an excuse to put some distance between them. Jarvis, apparently appreciating the stress he was under, was already filling the pot.  Tony reached for it.  “Why are we having this discussion?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“Good morning, sir.”
"Right," Steve said, the word forced from between gritted teeth.  "Mr. Stark-"
The metal melted away, peeling back in a silent rush, revealing a face that was almost, just almost, familiar.
Tony shifted his again, and the scent of them, heady and sweet, flooded the air.  “I don't know what I'm supposed to do with these,” Tony complained.
There was a split second of stillness, and then DJ was off and running, a peel of laughter trailing after him like a cloud of dust.  Giving in to his own laughter, Tony took off after him, rounding the edge of the workbench and skidding across the floor.  He had longer legs, but DJ was quicker around the corners and used to dodging adults.  Laughing, he lead Tony on a merry chase around the workshop, and by the time Tony caught him, he was out of breath and laughing, too.
“Me, too,” Harris agreed.  He held out a hand.  “Shake?  Or hug?  I’m okay with-”  The breath was knocked out of him as DJ slammed into him, half a hug and half a tackle.  Laughing, Harris wrapped his arms around him, giving him a quick, hard hug.  “Okay, then.”
“Good night, Mr. Stark,” Peter said, and his eyes were red, and so was the tip of his nose, and Tony hated everything about that.
“Thank you, Mrs. Parker,” Steve said, swinging his bag off of his shoulder and setting it down next to the door.  He stepped aside so Tony could shrug out of his coat, dropping it onto one of the hooks there.  “Something smells good.”
The room was too loud, too busy, too full of people talking in low, serious voices, and machines beeping away with steady insistence.  There was a few members of SHIELD scientific mingled in with the doctors, nurses and interns that seem to overflow every available inch of space.  But in the midst of it all, there was Steve, too pale and too still.  The left side of his face was a mass of bruises, his lip split and his eye swollen almost shut.  A butterfly bandage held together a nasty looking gash on the side of his neck, and his hair was matted against his forehead.  Someone had made a clear effort to clean him up, but the skin showing above the bandages on his arms looked grimy still.
“And I can't,” Steve said.
Steve sucked in a breath, his body swaying towards Tony's for an instant.  Tony steadied him, a hand catching Steve's shoulder, resting easily on the fabric, warm from his body.  Steve glanced up.  "Glad someone thinks so," he said, with a wry smile.  His hand came up, covering Tony's.  "I'm just going to smile and look pretty, okay?"
She was next to him now, and Tony lifted his head. “Want to know why I can't do this anymore?” he asked.
“Oh.”  Val looked at Steve.  “Are you going to kiss Cap?”
“I can be there in an hour.  And I will.  If you need me.”
"And watch whatever comes up," Steve said, reaching for the pizza.
“So am I.” She took a deep breath, her head twisting away.  “The cops didn’t think much of it, of course.  Just another criminal who got what he deserved.  They had other priorities.  And my mother didn’t make a fuss.  She just gathered whatever she had left and moved back to the city.  She could disappear here.  Forget.  Pretend that none of it had happened.”
Hammer started to laugh, soft at first, then high and sharp, taking on an unhinged edge.  “Come back HERE?” he managed, laughter breaking through the words.  “He’s not coming back here.  He didn’t want to be here when he was here, he’s not going to, he’s not-”
“I THINK I’m straight,” Greer said, her lips pursed.  ‘I’m open to possibility, but for now-”  She gave a shrug, her hair bouncing around her shoulders.  “Straight?”
His lips twitched.  “And by 'some people' you mean Pepper, don't you?”  He leaned back, bracing one hand on the roof behind him, his face tipped towards the sun.  “You absolutely should not listen to Pepper.”
“Thank you,” he mumbled, wiping away the last of the jam from his lips with a swipe of his thumb.  “What the hell would make Stark agree to that?”
“And the less honesty the better when Congress is involved,” Tony pointed out.
“They’re small,” she said with a bright grin, “have two.”
Tony raised his hand.  “Me.  I would.”
“That's my boy.”  Obie reached out, clapping a hand on Tony's shoulder.  “Remember, this is important.  We need to shake this 'Iron Man' thing.  With the problems we've been having-”
“Keep up, Stark,” he said, just because he could, and heard Clint choke on a laugh.
Steve’s chest ached.  “I…  Wanted to,” he admitted.  “I tried, I suppose.  But you’re not-”  He took a breath, and when he let it go, he let go of something else with it.  He wasn’t sure what, but he was suddenly sure.  Everything felt right, in a way that it hadn’t in a very long time.  “You’re not what I expected.”
"Am I using the good china?" he asked, crossing to the cabinets.
"All of them!" She headed back into the penthouse, her hips swaying like a pendulum.  “Do not oppose me, Anthony, or I'll make you regret it.”
“He kissed my boyfriend,” Steve said, grinning down at Tony.
“What?” Tony looked up towards the ceiling.  “Didn’t his deposit go through this month?”
He leaned forward, meeting her eyes.  “Doesn’t matter the gender, the seniority on the team, or their powers.  If someone starts to feel uncomfortable or unsafe, that’s not acceptable.  Understood?”
"Tony-" Jan said, and Tony glared at her.
“He was up the majority of the night,” Jarvis said, his voice pitched low.  “Examining the remains of the bomb for SHIELD Scientific.”
“You usually have council on Tuesdays,” Tony said, and Ty’s lips twisted into a snarl.
He grinned.  “Somehow, I’m not surprised.”  He grabbed the open stool between Clint and Carol, and reached for the teapot.  “So that was my mother,” he said, his voice bright.  “On the phone.  Calling me. At this hour.”
“Yes.”  Drew gave a slow nod.  “Yes, you can.”
“I am rational, and-”
"This is unacceptable," Stark said, even as a plate was placed in his hands by May, overflowing with chicken and potato salad.  He stood there, clutching it in both hands, as if he wasn't sure what to do with it.  "Are you all-"
“Because you can’t remember, and it’s easier to pretend that you’re doing that deliberately?” Peter asked, and Rhodey let out a low, admiring whistle.
DJ snatched his hand back, the tea cup slipping from lax fingers.  He watched, pulse pounding in his ears, as it hit the ground and rolled, the tea spilling across the carpet.
Tony’s fingers lingered on the black king, rotating it in slow circles on its base.  “He was a hell of a businessman,” he agreed.  “And he knew how to make money.”
DJ looked from one to the other.  “What’s a corn dog?” he asked, and everyone looked at him.  He blinked.  “Is it…” He paused.  “Food?”
“Just you,” Natasha said, stirring her coffee.  She licked the bowl of her spoon. “The rest of us joined up because the alternative was jail time.”
Peter fumbled at the nightstand, nearly knocking over the lamp as he tried to find his glasses. The room was still dark, but light spilled in from the window, a strange, uneven light, that seemed to lick across the glass.  Too early for dawn, and the light was wrong, it was too thin and too red to be the sun.
His voice trailed away, and Steve nodded.  “We appreciate it.”  He straightened up, picking up the envelope from the workbench.  “But if you could see DJ first?  We have a letter for him.”
“That is also something Mr. Stark says,” Miss Potts said.
It took him a moment, a moment where he took in the solid, warm weight of the body tucked against his, sprawled half over him. Tony was curled against him, one arm thrown over Steve's chest, his hair tickling Steve's jaw. Something was thrown over them, a blanket, and he didn't know where it had come from, he didn't know where they were, but he remembered the weight of Tony's leg against his, the way Tony's breath eased over his skin, slow and even. The smell of Tony's hair was already familiar, the warmth of his skin, the lines of his shoulders, his arms.
“Really?  We're okay with this now?” he asked, still tailing behind the damn thing, his weapons systems locked and live.  He considered taking a shot at a knee joint, or maybe a hip, but something this big, there was no way of knowing which way it would fall.  And behind the windows of every building they were passing, he could see the faces, staring at him with huge eyes, clutching cell phones, clutching each other.
“What’s the worst that could happen?” Harris asked.  “Seriously.  If I stand up right now and say, ‘Hey, world, come and get me,’ what’s the worst thing that could happen?”
“All right,” he said after a pause.  “Are you okay?”
"Neither am I, but I'm nosy as hell," Carol said, not budging.  She waved a hand at the hallway.  "Go.  We'll catch up."
“A bit more information about how, exactly, you handled this,” Coulson said.  He sounded exhausted.  “The scientific forensic team is...  Displeased.”
Steve pushed himself upright.  "All due respect, Sam, I've got a therapist.  I don't need another one."  He managed a smile, and it felt tight on his face, it felt fake.  But he was used to that, by now.  "It's not fair to you, or, really, to me."
Gyrich's head swung in his direction, his eyes hidden behind the lenses of his glasses.  “Agent Barton, you are in a difficult position here.”
Apparently not.  Tony fumbled out, dragging the phone over onto the pillow.  “No,” he said, and man, his voice sounded bad, even to him.
“No, you don't,” Natasha said, her voice bored.  She gave Tony a look.  “Go.”
Steve took a deep breath.  "But I should've-"
Steve cupped a hand over his face.  “Fine.  Reset the board, and we’ll play.  Just-”  He peeked out from between his fingers.  “Stop talking.”
Sam made a humming noise under his breath.  “Not that I’ve noticed,” he said.  “So, while I’m not downplaying your feelings here, Steve, maybe it’s something I can reassure you about.  I think perhaps you’re uncomfortable with what you’re wearing to social gatherings like this, because you’re uncomfortable with these gatherings, full stop.”
“Done,” she said, taking it.
"An' who cares what the likes of you needs?  Me, I'll be needing a bed an' I ain't gettin' it as long as you need a nurse maid," Rogers said, and he was laughing now, too, his shoulders jerking with it.  He rocked forward, his chest brushing against Tony's back, and Tony had to work hard at not relaxing into the shelter of his body.
“He is, but he doesn’t speak English.”
Steve smiled at the far wall of the corridor.  “It’ll be a tacky bootleg one,” he said.
“You can't wear the suit to go tell-” Rhodey shook his head.  “No.”
It was a perfectly ordinary looking hotel conference room, set with a few arm chairs and a single rather lopsided couch.  There was a table, piled with con booklets and a few discarded bags of wrappers and brochures.  There was a table with a coffee urn and water pitchers, a plate of picked over cookies, with the crumbling and rejected remains scattered across the tablecloth.
Tony paused in the act of tying his tie.  “Would I be talking to you if I wasn't?”
DJ thought about that, his fingers tapping on the edge of the bowl of gum drops.  “Yes,” he said.
“Good.  Yeah.  That's good,” Steve said.  He absolutely wasn't staring at the door.
Steve shook his head.  “No.  And-”  He took a deep breath.  “I'd like to keep it that way.”
The more they talked about this, the less Tony wanted to talk about this.  He looked at the window.  “Shouldn’t we have heard from them by now?”
Tony sighed and reached for the coffee.  “You’re just going to have to throw that away later,” he pointed out.  “After it molds.”
“We were coming to find you-” he started, and Steve didn’t care.
"Because he was fifteen or sixteen, I don't remember exactly.  But he was at MIT and he was not really ready to be at MIT, intellectually he was fine, of course, but the rest of it?  Socially?  No.  But he was too young and remarkably unsocialized and following Rhodey around like a puppy and he was not-"
“On it!” he yelled back, and then, in an undertone.  “Where’d he go?”
“It could work.  I’m the closest thing he has to a family, and as long as his business dealings are handled, no one’s likely to go looking for him.”  He looked at Clint.  “Wire Washington.  Nat, send word to Jan.  She can get through to Thor faster than we can.”
“Can yours do ventriloquism?” Wanda asked Harris, her voice only vaguely curious.
She nodded.  "You're a good boy, like your Da before you." She made the sign of the cross.  "May he rest in peace."  She gave him a respectful nod.  "Let me know if you need some extra bread."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, because I’m an even bigger idiot than you are,” Tony said, and he was pinned between the counter and the weight of Steves body and everything hurt, his feet and his hands and his head and his back, everything ached.  But Steve was warm and close and when Tony moved, his hands slid up under the back of Tony’s chef’s jacket.  Tony kissed his hair, letting his breath linger there.
“Where’s Stark?”
“Because I attract free thinking, hard drinking, culinary rebels who are ready to throwdown at any time,” Tony said.  “With a wide variety of knives used for a wide variety of purposes.”
“Yeah, judging by my headache right now, yes, I was probably really, really, REALLY drunk,” Tony said, “And when I’m really, really, REALLY drunk I usually say things that I mean but that I really, really, REALLY shouldn’t say.”
Steve nodded.  “Working, then.”
Steve managed a smile.  “I’m sure they will.  Sleep well, Greer.”
A cat leapt up onto the edge of the table, and DJ jumped, nearly knocking over his water glass.  The cat, a lean, angular creature with mottled black and gray fur that lay tight on its bony frame, gave him a look on its way past, golden-orange eyes reflecting the light as it turned its head.
“No,” Tony said, frowning down at his phone.  “The singing’s normal.  The outfit, though?  You should be worried about the outfit.”
Peter dodged, staying just out of reach, crashing into the side of the desk and hitting the balcony in a crouch.  He hit the railing with both hands, hopping up and over.  The whole thing happened so fast that he barely had a chance to swear.
Tony grinned, his eyes falling shut again.  “I'll live for today, then,” he said.  “Read me a porny one.”
“Yes, and don't TOUCH anything,” Ellen said.  She slid down off her stool and headed for the kitchen, her slippers slapping on the ground with each step.  “I've got everything exactly where I need it.”
For a moment, he had no idea where he was, or why he was awake, but the body curled against his was familiar.  Steve relaxed into the pile of pillows, listening to the steady sound of Tony’s breathing.  His hand stroked across Tony’s ribs, coming to rest with his fingers just below the arc reactor, savoring the slow rise and fall of his chest under his hand.
Steve tried to smile back.  "You've got more faith in me than I do."  He let his head fall back, staring up at the clean, white ceiling until it blurred. “I...”  His eyes closed.  “I think about it.  Sometimes.  About-”  He rubbed the back of his neck, trying to massage away the tension there.  “About not being me.  About being someone who can just-”
“I know.” Tony tossed his tablet aside and pushed himself upright.  “Want me to lower myself to manually typing things on your behalf?”
He disappeared into the pantry.  “Mr. Stark always says, pay a man a fair wage and reward loyalty and hard work, and they’ll repay the favor.”  A moment later, he emerged, a sack of potatoes braced on one muscular shoulder.  “You want some more?”
Tony leaned back, one foot braced on the leg of the workbench.  Jarvis had a familiar look on his face, and he had work to do.  "I'm not hungry,” he said, trying for a preemptive strike.
“Drink 'em of you've got 'em,” Jessica said.  She leaned forward.  “You got him?”
“I keep my finger on the pulse of this great city,” Tony said, his voice arch.  They moved in perfect tandem, their feet coming perilously close to one another with every step.  “All the best places, frequented by all the best people.”
The two exchanged a look, but didn’t say a word, turning and heading up the path to the house.  Tony watched them go, his face set.  “We’re not going to kill him.”
Tony blinked.  “What?  Oh.”  His face relaxed into a smile.  “Yes.  I'm fine, Steve.”
“Deej?”
“Don't make such a-” Tony gave him an indignant look.  “Pepper's gotten more out of this relationship than I have!  That's-”  He leaned over.  “What have I gotten out of you, Rogers?”
“If you drink it black, I’m sure you can have some small treat,” Jan said, smiling at her over the rim of her own cup.
Steve slipped a hand under his chin, bringing his head up.  “I love you,” he said.
Steve took a deep breath and it hurt, it ached in a way he didn’t really understand.  A phantom pain, almost forgotten, almost buried.  Something he should’ve long since outgrown.
“Yes,” he said, his hand resting on the door.  “Thanks, Pete.”
“You asked him to MOVE IN WITH YOU?”
Luke crossed the room in two huge strides, tossing the envelope onto the bedside table.  “Hey, hey, hey,” he said, grabbing for Steve's other arm.  “Stay still.  She's fine.”  Steve stared up at him, looking for a lie in his face, and Luke smiled.  “She's two doors down, wrapped up in a blanket burrito, hissing at Jan and Jess as they try to fuss at her.”
“It was occupied,” Rhodey said.
“I’m not,” DJ said.
“I sent you another one from Atlantic City, you should get it this week,” Steve said.  “Wanna guess what's on it?”
Tony was shivering now.  “Can't be here,” he mumbled.  “Sick.  Can't be-”
Sometimes, he was really grateful for Val.
"Better than expected," Peter said.  He gave Steve a wave and headed back to the kitchen door at a quick, loose jog.  Steve watched him go, trying not to smile.
“Some,” DJ said, his voice firm.  He leaned over Tony, his expression expectant.
“Now, Tony, can I call you Tony?”
Steve considered that. "Maybe," he said, with a slight, wry smile. "And maybe that's for the better."
“Knowing Happy, he’ll make up some new ones, too,” Tony said.
This time, when he smiled, it was the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen.  “Don’t ever underestimate me,” he said, and the words slid over Steve’s skin like a physical touch.  Tony reached out, his fingers cradling a discarded piece.  He tapped it against his cheek, his eyes locked on Steve’s.  “It’s your move.  Make it a good one.”
"You could've just left them off the guest list," a reporter in the front row opined.
By the time he returned with a couple more beers, Steve was laughing, his whole body shaking with the force of it.  There were tears in his eyes, his cheeks pink, and he stared up at Tony, trying to pull himself together.  Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “I did try to warn you about how bad this is,” he said, and Steve lost it again, a hand clamped over his face, little giggles slipping out from behind his fingers.
“Probably,” she said.  She didn't seem overly bothered by that.  “So I knew they were still in the city.  And I took their picture late.  Chances are, they stayed here rather than bunking down at the airport.  And Stark isn't likely to head for the local equivalent of a Motel 6, you know?”
He pointed a finger at DJ.  “Illogical punishment number one.  Go over there-” His hand cut through the air, pointing at the other side of the car.  “Cover your ears.  And hum.”
Tony paused, pretending to consider that.  “Waffles?” he asked.  Steve gave him a look, and Tony shrugged.  “I aim high in all my dealings, Rogers, and I won't apologize for that.”
“DJ?”
"Uh-huh." Tony stabbed the 'speaker' option on his phone and went back to squinting at the section of circuit board he was working on, wishing that he'd left just a tiny bit more buffer space in the design. Sure, it was cheap and efficient to produce, but it was a bear to repair. He straightened up with a groan. "Past Tony was an asshole, you know that?"
DJ considered it, his face suspicious.  "You can try it," Peter said, around a mouthful of bread.  He gestured at the plate with his crust.  "You like eggs, right?  It's pretty good.  For an egg."
“A man you are absolutely not going to kiss back,” Rhodey said.
“Going,” he said, ignoring the way that every deep breath hurt.  Too many times.  He realized that his hand was fisted over his breastbone, the fabric of his shirt tangled in his fingers.  As if that could keep anyone else from seeing.  From knowing what was happening.
Ellen paused.  "You've thought about this."
Tony took a seat on the couch next to him, his lips twitching.  There was something beautiful about Steve, something bright and buoyant and real, and he envied it.  Some small, detached part of him wondered if he could just do this.  Maybe he could.  Maybe he could live like this, with no end date, no cutoff.  Steve seemed comfortable with it, Steve seemed...
“Surrendering.” Tony waved a hand at the board.  “Capitulating.  Yielding to my benign rule over your lands as your sovereign and rightful lord, who will guide your life and your people with a firm but gentle hand-”
“Your ideas are interesting to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter,” Tony said. “Take a card.” He managed to get a hand between his body and Steve's, pulling a card out of his jacket pocket. “Here.”
"Better than I expected," she admitted.  She glanced over at the monitors behind the desk, her brows coming down.  "But it would've been harder if Mr. Stark hadn't interceded with management and approved a couple of weeks of leave so I could help get them settled in here in the city."  She looked back at Steve.  "Don't know how he found out.  But it was very kind of him to do it."
“He’s downstairs in the kitchen,” Natasha said.  “Helping them prep the last of the cherries for preserving and pies.”
Tony glanced at the clock on the wall.  “Around thirty-five hours?” he said with a smile.  “Bruce.  Okay.  You’re starting to worry me here.  Can we-”
“Yes!”  DJ dragged a big box over to the couch, pushing it between them as Phil started pouring cocoa.
“Right, and I’m going to do my community service and not tell him you called him that, because he will stick his cane into your wheel the next time he sees you.”
Clint shrugged.  “Watched it anyway, but I'd also find somewhere to hide for a few days.”  He reached out, rubbing DJ's head with an easy hand.  “Also throw in some middle of the night candy.  In for a penny, in for a pound, huh, kid?”
Jesse leaned forward.  “Run it, Duck.”
"I could tell you that, but it would be a lie," Jan said.  She smiled at Steve.  "Want to look at the menus?"
Tony scrambled for the door, or he tried to, but Steve had his arms around Tony's waist now, holding him well off the ground.  He was laughing, Tony could hear it, and feel it, his back plastered against Steve's chest, Steve's body warm even through the wet layers of their clothes.  Steve hunched forward, his fingers slipping on Tony's stomach, making a grab for his shirt as Tony twisted in his grip.  The rain was coming down hard now, and by the time Tony managed to get free, he was already soaked through.
In the kitchen, coffee and trays of pastry were set out on the broad table top, teapot covered by a cozy, stacks of cups and plates waiting to be picked up.  May was in front of the stove, her apron tied over a simple day dress, her hair tucked away under a kerchief.  She was stirring a massive pot on the stovetop, the sugary sweet smell of cooking fruit filling the air.
The armor’s stealth dropped away, and DJ retracted the helmet.  Harris stared at him, his blue eyes wide and his face pale.  Next to him, Darcy clapped a hand over her mouth, her eyes huge.  “Oh.”  DJ blinked at them, not sure exactly what to say. “This isn’t…  What I meant at all.”
“Yeah, I saw your YouTube video,” Allison said.  “The statement you gave me this morning played well, in case you were worried.”
Strange cleared his throat, and she looked up.  His head tipped in Steve’s direction.  She followed the gesture, those remarkable eyes locking on his.  “Hello,” Steve said.
“I’m not-” Steve scraped a hand over his face.  “No, seriously, I’ll pay for this, it’s my fault, I’ll-”
Ty lunged forward, grabbing the journal, and Tony grabbed his wrist, holding on with a death grip.  “Don’t you dare,” he said, his chest burning as he met Ty’s eyes. “Unless you’d like to explain to your father what happened to it.”
“It worked,” Jess said, “and then you ran away.  You didn’t even fly.  You just-” She waved a hand through the air.  “It was a long way to the edge of the field, too, it was like 90 seconds of watching you flee from me.”
Tony made a face.  “And we’re going to stop talking about this now, because he’ll know somehow and holiday breakups are just the worst.”
"To his dismay, yes."  Miss Potts glanced at Steve, a slight smile curving her lips.  "Officer Rogers, this is James Rhodes."
Tony paused, cup halfway to his mouth.  He smiled back.  “Clea?  If you proved to be a threat?  I would find a way to stop you.”
Franklin and Val exchanged a look, a look that DJ always thought of as their 'sibling glance.'  They could communicate without having to talk, and he envied that, he envied the way they could read each other, could see things and hear things that no one else could, when it came to each other.
And Tony was lost, lost in impulse, in memory, his brain fragmented, a handful of images, of sensations, slamming into him, knocking the breath out of his lungs, and he could taste the copper in the back of his throat, the way he had, the first time he’d fallen, when the armor had frozen, had fractured, the second time he’d fallen, the pressure of a cruel hand still bruising his neck, tearing at his skin the way that the wind had threatened to tear him apart.
And suddenly, the spark went out.
“Someone coulda seen him go in, word travels fast in this city,” Happy pointed out.
The desert stretched out in all directions, a narrow space hollowed out between the sand and the sky,  a strip of air that seemed somehow claustrophobic.  Tony tried not to look up, tried not to feel the way the sky pressed in on him.  He leaned his back against the car, his hands tucked in his pockets to keep them still.  Clint turned off the car, but left the headlights on, throwing long shadows across the almost alien landscape.
“A SHIELD agent has been dispatched from the airport with your luggage,” Jarvis said.  He sounded bored.  As if trying to find Tony clothes before he walked out in public was a task that had fallen to him far too often and now he was just resigned to it.
“Noted.” Tony reached out, his fingers trailing over Steve’s cheek.  “Let’s just skip opening presents and stay here for the rest of the day.”
“Right, and now that you and I have come to an understanding, I need to have a word with Steve,” Iron Man said, “so, go over there, cover your ears, and hum.”
“Right here,” Clint agreed, pointing at himself.  He tossed the phone to Tony, who caught it.  “I out talked you.”
Jessica leaned back in her chair, her chin up, one booted foot braced on the edge of the table.  "Nope," she said, her teeth flashing in a grin.  "I like the longshots."
Tony straightened up, ignoring the way his legs wobbled under him.  The box threatened to slip from his grasp, and he fumbled for it, hugging it to his chest with both hands.  His fingertips were numb, and a faint taste of sweet copper lingered on the back of his tongue, but he was home, and the rest, he could ignore.
“Breathe.”
Tony was already shaking his head.  "I'm fine," he said, fumbling for his phone again.  "I have a, I don't know, it's a farm thing, on my phone.  DJ plays it.  I just unlocked goats."  He paused, squinting down at the screen.  "I'm not sure I want to invest in goats.  They're very expensive.  It's...  I have a budget here."
Tony made a sound, something close to a snarl, caught low in his throat, and Steve moved forward, sliding an arm around Tony’s waist.  Tony slumped back against his chest, exhaustion sweeping over him in a sudden, overwhelming wave.  He squeezed his eyes shut.  “Right,” he managed.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Right.”
Stark nodded.  “Wouldn’t have it any other way.”  He tipped his head to the side, and Rogers met him halfway, their kiss half hidden from Tony’s view by the faceplate of the armor.
“Well, that was a long time coming.”  Bobbi tucked her hands in her pants pockets, pushing the cloth of her trench coat back.  It bunched against her wrists, floating behind her.  “My father was a brilliant chemist,” she said.  “A good husband and father, and a very good scientist.”  She gave Steve a wry smile.  “He came to the United States to teach at Empire University, and he brought my mother along.  I was born here.”
“They always are, now we can just blame erections,” Tony said.  He stripped off his shorts and stepped into the shower.  “Which is better than blaming how much we hate each other.”
Tony made a face.  “I'm fine.  I wanted a glass of water.  I got a glass of water.”  He stopped.  “Then I decided to, you know, sit down for a second.”
Sam studied him, his face unreadable.  “How's your love life, Steve?”
“Not at all,” Bucky said, grinning into his beer.
He went still.  "So how does the story end?" Steve asked DJ.  "What do you think?"
Stark's head came up, those remarkable eyes sharp beneath the hard line of his black brows.  "If you're refusing my offer, my very generous offer, might I add, of a room, then what is your plan?"  His eyebrows arched.  "Will you be propping yourself up in my front hall?  Sleeping down at the trolley stop?  Setting up a bivouac on my front lawn?"
It was awfully late for someone to be sitting on the front steps of his building.
"Of course, sir," Jarvis repeated.  He gave Stark a slight smile as he collected Steve's bag and hat from the table.  “Will there be anything else, sir?”
“I tested this one.”  Tony wiggled it in front of him.  “For poison and general tastiness.”
“Yeah, I just wasn’t…  Expecting them to be about Tony.”
Thanks for your patience, all!
“Night,” Steve said.  Other words, words that weren’t his right to say, stuck in his throat, and he managed a smile.  “I’ll be here for breakfast tomorrow.”
Steve clapped a hand over his face. “You're both ridiculous,” he said, tossing his sketchbook to the side. “You are both the most ridiculous people, and I'm giving you a run for your money.” He leaned back. “Okay. I fucked this up, didn't I?”
Tony could hear doom in every word.  “This isn't going to play well,” he said, his voice quiet.
Nebula:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula_(comics)
The music lead him on, and he followed, his heartbeat loud in his ears.
"You've got to be kidding me," Peter said from the ceiling.  "You've.  Got.  To be kidding me."
Tony straightened up, a jolt of pure pleasure going through him.  “Yeah?” he asked, a grin splitting his face.
“He's still groping you,” Bucky pointed out.
Steve’s head jerked around, but DJ was still lying on the lawn, one hand held up above him, his fingers flexing as he considered the night sky.  Reassured, Steve looked back at Tony.  “No.”
She kissed him gently on his other cheek.  “Merry Christmas, Cap.”
“Great,” Bucky said.  “Old, abandoned and haunted.”
Steve hugged him close. “Yes?” he prompted.
“Not a metaphor!” Tony yelled, even as he wandered towards the door.  He darted out, letting it fall shut behind him with a solid bang.  It was childish, and he did not care.  He had energy to burn and a lot of frustration, and he didn't want to go home and he probably shouldn't drive when he was like this.
She took a step forward, then two, wobbly and off-balance, and then she was throwing herself into his arms. Tony caught her, needing the comfort of her more than he wanted to admit. She was familiar and warm and strong, her grip almost painful.
“Right, and none of them blame you,” Tony pointed out with a grin.  He shifted forward, and his knees hit pew in front of him.  “Most of them pity you.”
“Summon my clothes when I shift,” DJ said.  “So less…”  He shrugged.  “Naked.”
“I ate my weight in pastry, thanks, even for me, that’s enough for the day.” He still hated this website, but Tony’s presence made things better.  Tony’s presence always made things better.
Tony glared at her over his shoulder, but there was a smile dancing in the depths of his eyes.  "Are you quite finished?" he asked, his tone polite.
"You don't know.  There might be someone in the pantry.  Will you check?" She set the ledger in her hands down next to her cup, and reached for the tea pot.  "And bring out the basket of scones if your hands aren't occupied with invaders."
He could learn from his mistakes, for once.
“Living the dream,” Steve said with a wry smile.
“And you did it as a joke.” Marcy tapped the end of her pen against the table.  It hit once, twice, three times, the click seeming to echo in the silent room.  Her head tipped to the side, her eyes wide.  “Is that it?  Let's get married, bro, but hey, no homo?”
“I am,” Steve said.  “And I was looking into something.”
He looked up to find Jarvis watching him, a faint, unreadable smile on his face.  “They are toys,” Jarvis said, his voice soft and gentle.  “And ought to be played with, not left to rot for an owner that may never exist, Officer Rogers.”  His eyes fell away and he flicked the handkerchief, releasing a burst of dust to float through the sunlit air.  “All it needs is a bit of soap and water and a good, quick scrub.”
Jan frowned down at the menu.  “I don’t-”
DJ shook his head, reaching for a cookie.  “Just…  Thinking.”
In more ways than one.
“Right, I-  That was necessary, but-”
“I knew nothing about any of this,” Wanda protested.  “You are the-”
But his ears were his ears, and he hadn’t closed the door, and in the bedroom, he could still hear Tony talking.  “Want to tell me what’s happening in that remarkable head of yours, kid?”
“Do what?”
“We have an agreement, we do not interfere with each other’s jurisdictions,” Coulson said, his voice flat.
DJ's eyes flicked towards Steve, and Tony decided not to take that personally.  "It was a little more than a trip," Steve said, with an easy smile.  "So he gets to choose what kind of pizza we have tonight-"
"Younger,” Jarvis clarified.
“Gee, thanks,” Steve said, and Sam clapped him on the back.
A few minutes later, the door behind him opened, and he heard the familiar tread of Steve's boots.  He tipped his head back, a smile slipping over his face.  “What'd you bring me?”
Tony shut the bedroom door, resting his hand on the wood for a moment.  “I mean, you could,” he said, his voice light.  “I don’t see why you would, though.”  He turned around.  Steve was sitting on the edge of the bed, his chin up, his shoulders a hard line beneath his shirt.  Tony huffed out a breath, his face relaxing into a lopsided smile. “Do you want to sleep on the couch, Steve?”
DJ reached out, tapping lightly on the tip of Tony’s nose.  “Okay,” he said, and Tony smiled.
Clint pointed a finger at her.  “Right.  I accept this mission.”  He disappeared back into the kitchen.
“You lost him?”
“Then no shortcake for you,” Jarvis said, his voice brisk. “Or egg salad.”
“Oh, do we trust them now?” Natasha asked, setting the kettle on the stove for the morning’s tea.
The door opened, and Okoye stepped in, a large, cloth wrapped bundle thrown over one shoulder.  She shrugged it off and held it out to Shuri.  “Nakia will follow him back to the city,” she said.  “And meet us on the main road.”
DJ slipped behind Mrs. Parker, who covered her mouth with a hand to hide her smile.  “You don't have to have your picture taken if you don't want to, dear,” she said.  “But I'd love to have a picture of you to put up in my parlor.”
“Let's go to your place.”
Tony took a breath.  “Yeah.  We both know that's a lie.”
“No matter what you do right now,” Marcy said, “it's not going to play well with someone.  The question you have to ask yourself is what side you're going to come down on, Tony.  The bigots are going to vilify you and boycott you if you stay married, if you legitimize this-”
Jan and Sam exchanged a look around him. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose. “Do not do the silent communication thing,” he said. “When the two of you are on the same page, it's... It's not good for the rest of us.”
Steve looked at Bucky, who’d gone back to filling the bottles.  With a sigh, he turned back to Sam.  “We’re on our way.”
Steve was laughing against his back, he felt it as much as heard it.  “And I’ll either break something, or trip on it and break my neck,” he said.  “One quick pull and there’ll be pearls rolling everywhere.”
A minute later, the passenger side door opened, and Stark leaned in.  “Okay if I sit?” he asked.  He held up the cup holder.  “I brought a bribe?”
So much of my love for writing just withered and died, because it really felt like whispering into a screaming void that swallowed everything I could manage.  And when you fought and kicked for hours to manage those small whispers, and they're gone before they seem to be heard...
All in in, the girl was the safest choice, even though it looked like she was barely out of high school, with curly dark hair that bounced around her shoulders and a nose covered in freckles.  She was wearing an oversized witch hat in a truly appalling shade of yellow.  It read “Staff” across the front of the hat in the same ‘wacky’ font that all the signs used.  “Do they make you wear that hat?” Tony asked, unable to tear his gaze off of it.
DJ squeezed his hands.  “Dad.  Where’s-” He pulled back, his eyes darting over the room.  “Steve, where’s dad?”
Jess held up her hands.  “I’m easy.”  Nebula tossed them over, and she smiled up at Okoye. “Okay, what am I reading?”
Pepper's smile grew.  "Glad to see that you've switched to the society pages, Gary, how's the paygrade on that at the London Times?"
He nodded.  “You did it.”
“I mean.  You can try,” Bucky said, herding her towards the door.  He glanced over his shoulder at Steve.  “Dishes?”
Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose.  “Yes.  Please do.”  She waved her cane at them, and Tony had to skip backwards to keep from getting hit, and chairs flickered into existence in a circle, with her at the forefront.  “Fine.  All of you.  Have a seat, and let us sort out what, exactly-”
Tony stared at him.  "No.  No...  We're not," he said, and he tried his best to sound absolutely certain about that.  Confident.  In control.  Steve tipped his head to the side, and his glasses slid down his nose.  For a second, he went crosseyed, his expression a perfect mix of amusement and befuddlement, then he pushed the glasses back up.
Jarvis's eyebrows arched.  "How odd," he said.  "That is almost, word for word, what I said when your father handed you to me, all those years ago."
Steve rubbed a hand on the back of his neck. "I'm finding it hard to care," he admitted, and Tony ducked his head, trying to hide a smile. "Besides, you're not exactly a reliable informant, you know."
Steve took a deep breath.  “I wish.  Come on.  We've got prep work to do.”
Peter’s eyes darted towards Tony, and then back to Jarvis. “I just think-”
Morse propped her hands on her hips, rocking back and forth on her heels.  “Yep,” she drawled.
“You know he can’t,” Tony said.  “You…”  He stopped.  “Know he can’t.”
“It’s a disreputable website, Jan,” Tony said.
He took a deep breath.  “With…  What, exactly?”
Tony stared at him around the refrigerator door, his face still.  “What’s wrong?”
Tony’s tongue flicked out, wetting his lips and Steve went a little dizzy for a second.  “And what would you have done if I had?” he asked.
He gave his head a sharp shake. “At least, you weren't alone.”
“I need to know where I stand.  I need to be-”  He struggled to smile, ignoring how his eyes burned.  “I need to be sure.  If I keep pretending-”  He shook his head.  “I'll forget.  That it's pretend.”
“Listen, buddy, I’m trying, I can barely speak English, and I’m trying,” Tony said, grinning down at his cutting board.
Harris and Tony both turned in their seats to look back at him.  “What?” Tony asked, as the light turned green.
“The last thing I need is someone else grumbling at me.”  Tony flipped through the pages  of the small notebook, the book braced on one knee, and Steve’s eyes narrowed.
DJ considered that.  “No,” he said at last, and Steve burst out laughing.
“The penthouse,” she said.  Her fingers rubbed on his cheeks, tingles of pressure.  “You went to the penthouse.  Do you remember?”
“I think-” The shutter clicked again, and he stopped, sighing. “Want me to make a face or something?”
Confused, DJ looked at Val, who was biting her lower lip to hide a smile.  “Because you're both boys,” she said, with her usual bluntness.  DJ liked Val and her bluntness.  He liked asking a question and getting a simple answer.
“Band's all warmed up,” Clint said, leaning back against the counter.  “I mean, as warmed up as a string quartet can get.  They're trying to stay professional, but Hogan brought a lute and a lot of enthusiasm, so, look forward to that.”
Darcy sat up straight, her eyes going wide.  “Can I get a-”
Director Fury paused next to the table, looking down the length of his nose at Harris.  “I’m going to be honest with you here, Mr. MacIntyre.  I have limited head space to devote to you.  Until you reach full agent status-”
Steve head snapped up, surprised, and she smiled at him.  “Everyone had gone home.  Even the priest.  It was just Peter and I, standing there.  With, perhaps, no where else to go.  We had a flat still, of course, paid for through the end of the month, but I knew I couldn’t long afford that, not on my own.  So in a way, we’d already lost it.
He took a seat in the armchair next to Tony. “This is really bothering you, isn't it?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“Cat,” Harris said, a little too loud and a little too sharp, and everyone looked up, just in time to see the cat jump onto the podium in the center of the altar.  It paused there, caught in the light from the high windows, the tip of its tail twitching back and forth as it settled down.
Steven nodded, and picked up the container of rice again. “Tony?”  He looked up, meeting Tony's eyes.  “You're many things.  Boring is not one of them.”  He took a bite of rice.  “What happened at the meeting?”
DJ tipped his head to the side, trying to focus on the rest of the room.  Harris was hovering right behind Steve, his face worried.  He was holding a broom.  DJ didn’t really question that.  “I’m-”  He tried to smile.  “Okay.  Am okay, is everyone-”
Steve exhaled. “I’m sorry,” he said, and Tony nodded again.
“I don't even want to know-” Steve started.
Tony checked his watch.  “Yeah, he should be back soon, I told them I needed him by nine, and-”  There was a rattle from the front door, and Tony grinned into his coffee.  “Staff here is very prompt.”
“Because that’s what Mr. Stark needed.” Clint tossed an onion in the air and caught it, rolling it around his hand and across his wrist.  “And that’s what he got.”
“Are you hungry?” Jarvis asked the boy, his voice cutting through Obie's with ruthless intent.  “Because I believe that Mrs. Parker just finished a fresh batch of tarts.”
“No one’s coming.”
Rogers shook his head.  “He's been in the city his whole life, in the most crowded, dirtiest depths of the city.  He sleeps in a room with ten, twelve other boys.  There's always someone snoring, or someone talking, or someone crying or even just breathing.  The streets are never quiet, never dark, no matter what the hour.
“He loved her, I think,” Tony said.  As much as his father could love anyone or anything. He shook off the thought.  “So her family got a large influx of cash, my father got half ownership of a winery, and a wife, and my mother got-”  Tony waved a hand at the fountain, and the house behind it.  “All of this.”
Tony lunged for him, knocking him back a step, the kiss hot and deep and all consuming, one hand sliding along the length of Steve's neck, up into his hair. “You're going to make me insane,” he whispered against Steve's lips, and Steve shuddered, his body pressing close.
For a long moment, the elevator traveled in silence.  “Neither has Captain Rogers,” Jarvis said at last.  “I suspect he is struggling to adjust to your current arrangement, just as you are, sir.”
Tony nodded.  “Our arsonist doesn’t have any secrets to spill.  Let him rot in the nearest jail cell we can find.”  His head ached, and he rubbed his temples, trying to think clearly.  “Stane’s another matter.  He knows too much.”  He stopped, a bitter laugh slipping through his lips.  “I told him too much.”
“We’ll be home soon,” Steve said.  “You know we will.”
“No,” DJ said, and she laughed.  DJ’s legs swung, his heels bouncing against the rung of the stool.  “Toast, please?”
“Right,” Tony said, because this was rapidly becoming his favorite game. “Victor said we could use his office, so-”
He stopped, as if realizing too late what he was saying, but Steve just smiled again.  "Before I came back from the dead?" he filled in.
Ellen lowered her feet back to the floor, fumbling under her desk for her shoes without looking.  "No.  I don't-" She stood.  "We're still missing something."
“Oh, it might help you?” Clint asked.  DJ nodded, looking very serious.  Clint tugged on his blanket, pulling it down over his face.  “You're a manipulative little brat, you know that, right?”
Miss Potts' hand didn't waver.  “Do we have a deal, Officer?”
“That's a good start,” Natasha said, her voice brisk.  “If you can cut them?”
There was a crash, and a shriek, and then a man came flying through the air, landing in the middle of the bomb with a solid thud.  There was a beat of silence, and Tony pointed at him.  “I'm glad I finished the diffusing process before you chose to do that, Romanov.”
DJ shifted his weight.  “Don’t need to.”
Val scrubbed at her nose with the back of one wrist, her face wrinkling up.  “No, you're not,” she said.  “You're just sorry DJ is mad at you.”
The cat gave him a disdainful look and flopped over, spreading its bulk over the top of Tony's pillow.  Behind it, DJ was waiting, his face hopeful.
He wasn't sure how much time passed as he worked, but by the time he was nearly done, blinking hurt.  He struggled to focus as he tried to brace the strut in place with the back of his wrist, fumbling across the workbench for a pair of pliers.  "Stay put, you damned-"
“Slept through a few things in my life, but you're right,” Tony said, turning to face Rogers, who was so close that he could see the smattering of pale freckles across the bridge of his nose.  Tony smiled at him.  “That's not one of them.”
Steve snagged the front of his shirt in one fist, pulling him in for a kiss.  “Take it off, Stark.”
“Mr. Stark designed it,” Rhodes said, lifting the hood on a nearby car.  “And built it, for that matter, but the design was the hard part.”
Steve glanced at his bedroom, remembering the state of the his closet. “Good luck with that.”
And maybe he was.  Tony looked like something from a different world, almost a different species, his dark, gleaming eyes shadowed beneath the sweep of his lashes.  Something beautiful and terrible and foreign, and Steve ached for him in a way that he didn’t even know he could.
“Why is Tony's relationship with every other scientific genius in this city so bad?” Steve asked.
DJ nodded.  “I can help,” he said, his voice hopeful.
Nicholas reached for his mug again.  “Don’t you think it’s odd?” he asked, his tone amused.  “That T’Challa insisted on sending that missive to me?  Don’t you think it’s odd that Wilson was the one to come collect you?  A member of the city guard?  Not one of the King’s Elite, or even a whole battalion of the army?  Just a single man.” He swirled the beer in his cup, watching it roll against the metal.  “Don’t you think it’s odd that you got such a…”  He tapped a finger against his cheek.  “Royal guard, all the way home?”
“Design staff,” Jan called.  “Here to outfit our people with only the finest of haute coutre.”
Tony pointed at him.  “I need you to wipe that pleased look off of your face,” he said.
Disbelief forms onto Steve’s features as he watches Tony get up, walk to the closet, and produce a whip from inside of it.
”Okay”, Thor says, a hint of doubt in his voice, but still getting up from the bed. ”I’ll be nearby. Just call me if you need me. Your, uh, things are right here”, he adds, lifting the black box to the bed.
Sex or no sex, he just functions. He functions until he feels numb in his limbs and still, when he goes to bed, he can’t sleep. His mind is a hell that doesn’t allow him a second of rest, constantly rattling and creaking under his composed exterior, detaching him from the present all the time. It demands action from him, bullies him until his head hurts from concentrating, but he has no answers. He needs peace, needs rest, needs something to make his mind as numb as the rest of him feels.
”Don’t fall asleep, rockstar.” Steve poked the tip of Tony’s nose with a finger. ”Come on, let’s take a bath before the food arrives. I’ll wash you.”
Tony wraps his arm around Steve’s shoulder and squeezes tightly, leaning his own head on top of his.
The most likely explanation was that Tony had deliberately left it out. Stuff like that had been happening for a week now. Tony would make coffee, but when Steve showed up for it, there would be none for him. Tony would go through the house and collect the dirty clothes into the washing machine but leave Steve’s dirty socks laying on the bottom of the laundry basket. He’d promise to fix Steve’s headphones (from experience Steve knew it took Tony approximately five minutes to do that) but keep “forgetting” them despite Steve’s several, polite inquiries about them. And when Steve would try to cuddle him in bed, or warm things up, Tony would turn his back to him and say something about feeling too hot, or tired, or having a headache.
?” Steve says, mostly to himself. Perhaps it’s this body that’s making him so sick of himself, making it impossible for him to function like a good omega should.
Steve gathers himself obediently and does as told while Tony stands up, ridding himself of his jeans. Just hearing the click of his belt makes Steve’s mouth water, but he knows better than to beg.
Tony stomps to him determinedly and kisses him. There’s something in his eyes that makes Steve want to grab him and beg him not to go, and it’s probably only the fact that his hands are occupied that keeps him from doing it.
”Sorry”, he says quietly.
”Yes, sir. Thank you”, Steve mumbles, gathering himself back to his knees for Tony and dismissing the pull his body feels towards the sheets. It helps that despite his orgasm Steve still feels needy, just in a slightly different way now. But it’s not his place to want – he takes what he’s given.
He’d been so hopeful after they’d found out where to find Thanos. The stones would be with him, and in them, the key to bringing his child back. To bringing everybody back. But the stones are gone, and it gives him no satisfaction to know that so is Thanos. Giving up never was in Steve’s nature, but how can he not admit it; this is it, isn’t it? There’s nothing they can do.
”So was the doctor, but stress affects hormones and – come on, honey, don’t make me explain the science to
Steve doesn’t have to be told twice. He shuffles so that he can see himself when he rests the side of his face down, then does just that, slumping against the pillow. It feels like heaven, just his muscles being allowed the rest. Sure, he has extremely high endurance, but that doesn’t mean that he enjoys prolonged strain. The pillow is soft and cool against his skin and he closes his eyes for a second, letting out a relieved sigh.
”We went to therapy, you know.”
They talk for some time. Pepper describes to him how things have changed, the chaos everywhere. They even scratch the surface on the subject of business, even though it’s hardly the first thing on either of their minds. Tony’s grateful for the diversion, but at some point, his thoughts start drifting back to Steve, to the mission the others have left on. It’s ironic to think that he’s allowed Steve to leave to space to fight Thanos after just having done that himself, narrowly returning with his life only due to a downright miracle.
Steve’s heels press into his back, a strained noise of affirmation leaving him. He reaches up to Tony’s face, pulling him down to kiss him like he needs it to breathe, and Tony gives him everything he’s got, his mouth caressing Steve’s tongue dedicatedly, his hips thrusting in an angle he figures must be good from the sounds Steve makes. It feels like they’re breathing life back into each other.
“Don’t be sorry”, Tony corrects him. “We can fix it.”
”Tony –”
was to make sure I wasn’t angry when we do this.”
”Fine”, he agreed. ”But if you drop me you’re calling me daddy in front of the food delivery guy.”
It doesn’t much matter to Steve as long as Tony’s feeling good, and there isn’t a reason to doubt that with the way he’s currently concentrating on how his cock is slipping in and out of Steve, his lips parted as soft grunts leave him on occasion. But then he lifts his gaze, meeting Steve’s eyes in the mirror, and Steve shivers under his scrutiny.
They hadn’t yet had sex after Tony’s return to home, and as it was, Tony’s words held some truth; Steve had missed his alpha very much. There wasn’t a reason why they couldn’t have sex as far as they’d be mindful of Tony’s arm either, but right now the older man seemed mostly sleepy despite his suggestion.
He kisses Steve, his tongue infiltrating his mouth possessively. From the way Steve whines and twitches around his fingers, Tony figures that Steve’s as ready as he’ll be, and he gives Steve a tender look before lifting himself up and positioning himself between Steve’s legs. Steve’s gaze feels like it’s burning his skin and everything else fades into the background, leaving just the two of them into focus.
”Well, yes, but do you –”
What could the universe possibly gain by taking away something so harmless, something so light and innocent?
“That’s it”, Tony states quietly. “Good boy.”
The crying quietens.
Tony turns around to face Steve, who tries to look back casually, sucking his lower lip and raising his brows like they’ve encountered merely a slightly uncomfortable obstacle. But Tony can feel his nervousness, the fear of being rejected flowing through the seams of the bond.
It’s silent for a long time.
idea how intoxicating that is?”
There isn’t a sensation in the world that comes even close to how it feels to enter your omega, willing and slick underneath you, and Tony forces himself to keep his eyes open as he begins to move, watching Steve mewl in frantic pleasure.
When his breathing started to even, he reached his hand to Tony’s chest, brushing the backs of his fingers against it softly. He was almost surprised to hear Tony actually hum at him in acknowledgement; he had fully expected Tony to doze off the second they were done.
Steve doesn’t answer right away, so Tony settles beside him, using his own arm as a pillow. His other hand he lays onto Steve’s stomach, drawing small circles on it with his thumb.
”Nice save, kid”, Tony comments.
”I did. I slept in the car, then went to see Rhodey. Spent a couple of nights at his place drinking beer. Then I drove back here, planning to come home. But for some reason I couldn’t, so I spent the rest of the week in a hotel. Didn’t do much, tried to work. Missed you and the twins.”
This gets Tony’s attention. He turns in his chair, and Steve recognises the tenseness in his posture; Tony doesn’t like this.
”Look”, Tony said after taking a steadying breath, reaching to frame Steve’s face with his hand. ”I’m here. We’re here.”
When Tony gave an experimental thrust, Steve clenched around him, his eyes shuddering closed.
The alpha in Tony is yearning to take over, impatient to breed his omega. In fact, they can’t say for sure that it won’t happen now, as omegas often become fertile already on pre-heat. The thought makes Tony’s hips twitch, his knot starting to swell even though he’s not come yet. His finger hovers over Steve’s rim as he takes in the sight of his omega stretched around his cock.
”Daddy”, he breathed, and he could already feel it, his cock twitching in Tony’s hand –
”Good job”, he joked warmly into his ear, his voice now clear and void of the urgency. ”You did good, alpha.” He sighed, sounding satisfied, his fingertip traveling along Tony’s spine unhurriedly.
”This is Kieran, and this sleepy fella here is Emmett”, he introduces the children.
But Steve needs Tony. Steve needs Tony to touch him, to fill him, to knot him. He needs his scent, the calm and safe of it, needs Tony to show him how to be.
Tony stroked his hair, moving his cock ever so slightly in and out of Steve to keep him satisfied as he spoke.
”I don’t know if I should be more concerned about our kids getting excited about a war between us, but according to Kit, I would win”, he says.
It wasn’t a surprise, as Steve was very sensitive to marking even when not in heat; a couple of times, Tony had managed to make him come just from that alone. Still, most of Tony’s attention went to self-control in that moment as he didn’t want to draw blood but couldn’t make himself tore his teeth away either. For a while it was just Steve trembling against him as he snarled from between his teeth, trying to remind himself to breathe. It took a few breaths, but eventually Tony relaxed and let go, beginning to lick the mark he’d made.
There’s nothing but adoration in Steve’s eyes as he watches them from the mirror, watches how beautifully Tony has him pinned under his control. He truly loves it. It might be
Steve grits his teeth. He knows Tony’s nervous, but if he doesn’t drop the act Steve will throw either him, himself, or both of them out of the window. Steve doesn’t have a lot of interest in home décor, but even he knows that the expensive piece of sitting furniture they have their asses sat on is not a fucking ”couch”. As does Tony, of course.
It takes a moment for him to find Steve, but he finally notices him outside from the kitchen window, raking of all things. Instead of going to him right away, Tony stands at the window for quite a while, just watching Steve building his colourful pile. Finally, it dawns on him that there isn’t going to be an easy way to break the news to Steve no matter how long he procrastinates.
”What?” Tony’s face shoots up. Is Steve serious? After all he’s put Tony through, now he wants to
Steve watched his alpha flutter his eyes open.
There are fights, but they’re controllable, and instead of storming off they begin to sort them out by talking. Steve explains Tony his thoughts, and Tony talks about his feelings, and it’s not always pretty but at the best of times an argument ends with them holding hands comfortingly over the table in hopeful silence.
Steve reaches his jaw and Tony pulls his face backwards to kiss him hungrily, and Steve’s face is wet, and it should feel wrong but everything feels right, their touches following their memories of each other’s bodies.
”It’s obviously hurting you, Tony. It’s hurting me. And if…” Steve takes a shaky breath, looking away. ”If you can’t forgive me, I think it would be for the best. I don’t want to, but –”
The color starts to rise back to Steve’s cheeks as Tony keeps going, soon adding a second finger. His other hand is still around Steve’s throat, and Steve realizes that he has started to lean into it, that Tony’s partly holding his weight from slumping forward. Immediately, Steve’s eyes flick up to Tony’s bicep, to see how the lines of the muscles in his arm stand out from the strain. He stares, completely taken by it until he hears Tony chuckle huskily.
“Says the devil.”
Steve sucked in a deep breath, and exhaled slowly as he straightened his shoulders and adjusted the cuffs of his long coat absentmindedly.
Clint had been around for a few days before Fury had sent him on a mission to Britain and Bruce had been scant too, flitting between the science labs in the tower and the local school he was working at as a science teacher. As for Tony….
Steve peered at the face and breathed a sigh of relief at the time. It was only half four, which meant he had just enough time to visit the local pub for a cup of stew.
It was probably no surprise to anyone that Steve had fallen in love with Tony. Except, maybe to Steve.
He flexed his fingers against the leg of his trousers, the touch used to ground him. He couldn’t let his mind drift into the shadows of his memories again. They were visited often enough at night when he slept, he didn’t need to dwell on them during the day now.
Peggy, bless her heart, had written to him not two days later and this time, Steve had forced himself to open it.
He tore his eyes from their fun, idly thumbing the edge of his journal. These seemed to be his days now; sitting in the parks or wandering the streets. How boring and mundane it was compared to the fast way of living when he had been on duty. To some, it was either commendable or creepy that he garnered so much thrill and excitement from a new case. However big or small, nothing could beat the knot of anxiety that formed, followed by the inexplicable stubbornness of pursuing culprits and questioning suspects and the flutter when he knew he was on the right track.
But only if he got his act together and found a costume.
The whole thing was a combination of classy and fun. Tony had it nailed perfectly.
Natasha inclined her head at him, dropping the orange peel into a neat pile in front of her. “I don’t remember that being one of the rules.”
Steve felt his training kicking in and he shoved his hand in his pocket to grab at his badge and began shouldering his way through the crowd. People glowered at him as he passed but let him continue his jostling when their eyes landed on his signia held aloft until he drew up short at the scene laid out in front of him.
Another one of his pitiful routines.
Another waiter proffered him a tray of pumpkin and ghost shaped cookies, each individually detailed and iced to perfection but Steve declined. He didn’t think he could stomach them right now, even if they did look delicious.
He cast another quick look around his surroundings, for anything before sighing again and moved to retrace his steps.
“Captain Rogers, it is your turn to take the elevator to the party.”
“Think a little outside the box, Steve,” she rolled her eyes. “It says no one can
Three whole days of such endeavours had been enough and Steve had told Philips as much. It had been the first letter he had penned since his arrival in Hedersett and had been met with such a brusque reply that his sour mood turned bitter in a matter of a few lines.
Maybe his costume was a bit too much, or too dressy. Then, it was a Stark party and Tony was likely to be impressed by the outrageous. Not for the first time, Steve wished he had been allowed to know what Tony was going as.
His tongue had stuck to the roof of his mouth and it felt like all the air had been sucked from the room. Tony was gazing up at him, still smiling, but when Steve looked closer, he saw the flicker of insecurity lurking in Tony’s expression, how his smile was closer to the mask than it was genuine.
, Steve thought but turned to greet the officers that materialised through the gradually dissipating crowd. Clearly with the excitement over, they were ready to go home and gossip. No doubt that the newspapers would be all over this come morning. Steve hated the press.
He carefully slit it open with his thumb and pulled out the slender bit of card hidden inside. It was like parchment to touch and slightly heavier than paper, more calligraphy sprawling across the page, just in black ink this time:
It hadn't taken the sting out of the bite of being made to stay but Sam had that effect on Steve. Peggy was his compass and Sam was the reason he took a break from work to spend some time in the pubs with everyone else. He felt a little more settled at the idea of staying but not by much.
Steve took one last inhale of vaguely fresh air before he stepped out onto the streets.
Tony rolled his eyes. “I thought we established that already.”
Tony snorted, though he looked vaguely amused. “Maybe, but maybe I want to make nice with you,” he said. “So, tell me, gorgeous, when were you planning on telling me that you wanted to take me on a date?”
He turned slightly to look at her properly. She was a young thing, with keen grey eyes peering out from underneath waves of dark hair. “Are you a witness?”
Steve hadn't bothered to write back and burned Philips’ demeaning letter over the squalid kitchen sink. Satisfying for the time it took for the ashes to burn out and leave a mess for him to clean.
