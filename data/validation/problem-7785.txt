He gave Tony a sardonic look and simply said, “Podcasts.”
“Oh.” For a moment, he thinks Tony’s going to ask him how his run is going and he’s going to have to make something else up, but then Tony says in a rush, “I need you to come with me on the vendor runs this morning.”
Tony must have felt the same way he did—of course he did, they had always been in tune—because his hands, once so busy stroking over Steve’s chest, were now trailing over his stomach, pinching lightly when the muscles jumped, down to their pants, which he shoved down just enough to free their cocks. He took them both in his hand, stroking once—too dry—before thumbing over the heads to gather up the precome. He used that to slick them both to make the glide of his hand smoother. Steve groaned into Tony’s mouth at the slick touch.
Me: Okay we need a conservative homophobic podcast
Steve glances in his direction. Tony perks up and lets out a small
“I don’t give just anyone presents,” Tony points out.
“You can’t come over, Tony,” Natasha says firmly. “Stay at Steve’s.”
He sighs frustratedly. “It’s that obvious, huh?”
different, so I didn’t realize you were trying to—to court me.”
Steve is avoiding him. He spends all his time in the human village now, talking with Natasha and throwing worried looks Tony’s way when he thinks Tony isn’t looking. Tony is; he’s
“No, we always cared,” Natasha informs him. “We just weren’t going to say anything to the Great and Powerful Fire Spirit.”
Steve blinked, taken aback. “No,” he said uncertainly. “You haven’t been—”
He stops short at the tiny, sincere smile on Tony’s face.
No, wait, that didn’t make sense. He wasn’t anyone important. He didn’t come from a long line of millionaires. He was just Tony—Tony Rogers, Steve’s husband and—where had that thought even
Done, and all ingredients are allergen-friendly so that’s taken care of.
“Erotica in Art,” Steve clarifies, leading Tony deeper into the apartment. “An’ I guess everyone thinks that means I’m going to fuck the model or something cause all the department models I asked looked at me like I was crazy for asking ‘em an’ turned me down flat.”
“Howard called him. You know how he’s been dying to get out of this town. He said they’re going to talk business, but I know Justin. He’s going to steal Howard’s idea and leave him here and tell everyone that Howard’s a washed-up has-been.”
“Yes, Dr. Stark told me this might happen,” T’Challa says solemnly. “He’s been preparing for it, I believe.”
He’d ignored her words for those first few weeks, but they’d been difficult to ignore after realizing Howard Stark was such a shitty person, he was making Tony cry from a thousand miles away. And they’d been downright impossible to ignore once Tony had gone to the Dean to argue that Tony’s stats professor should be fired. So that’s what he’s done for the last two years—he’s handled Tony with care, because god knows no one else does, least of all whoever gave Tony that black eye.
Steve awakens alone in the bed. He looks at the cold, empty spot beside him sadly. He should have expected this, he knows. Tony risked a lot by coming to their safehouse, having no way of knowing when Sam would be coming back or even if Steve would be alone at all when he arrived. It makes sense that he’s already left. He probably left hours ago before the sun had even started to
Tony blocked his path. “Why not?”
“Sounds like you better check that,” Tony observes, rocking back on his heels.
“Sam—”
What?
“Nah,” Tony says. “Something tells me he isn’t going to need it anyway.”
“A bit,” Sam admits. “I thought we were in this together.”
He barely even notices when DUM-E turns off, too busy with his coding and story to realize when DUM-E’s arm finally droops as the bot shuts down entirely. It isn’t until he asks DUM-E a question about what he thinks about Steve Rogers and DUM-E doesn’t respond that he realizes the bot’s turned off.
Steve laughs. “I can believe it,” he says. “That’s just like him.”
The doorbell rang again.
To his surprise, Tony gives him a small smile. “Thanks.”
means at least. It means that Steve is unexpectedly sweet and adorably clueless about technology sometimes and has an unexpectedly sly sense of humor that makes Tony want to kiss that smirk away.
“Aye,” Thor says, brightening up. “It’s for my Jane’s birthday. While I think she’ll like my gift—” He winks and Steve, who knows that the gift in the bag is a potion for virility and stamina, winces. “—I believe that the gift receipt is a good idea, just in case.”
“Yes, like one of those songs from the television.”
Sam breaks, grinning at him. “I’m kidding, man. Calm down.”
“I think they gave us a lemon.”
“Bucky’s awake,” Steve blurts out as soon as he opens the door to see Tony standing on the front step.
Tony wandered in, humming a song he thought he’d heard on the radio, though he was hard-pressed to remember what song talked about androids and newlyweds in the same verse. “What are you doing cooking?” he asked. “It was my turn tonight. I was going to make carbonara.”
Something washed over him—a feeling, one of great sadness, threatening to nearly overwhelm him with its intensity. That had to be it! He’d forgotten to call the florists and have flowers sent to his parents’ graves. He didn’t know how he’d forgotten; he’d remembered the anniversary of their deaths every year for the last five years. Well, five years though. He was bound to feel the pain of their passing more intensely on a round number like that. Yes, that was it. That had to be why he was feeling that grief so much more this year unlike all the others before it.
“Please?”
“I just thought it might help get your mind off of—”
“Little weirded out, but that’s on me, not her.”
Steve doesn’t even hesitate. Maybe it’s weird for business partners/friends to cuddle like this, but Tony’s never been held the way he wants even once in his life. If this is all that Steve can give him, he wants to. He rolls onto his side, tucking up behind Tony. It’s surprisingly easy. Every time he’s done this with… other people, it’s been hard trying to get situated and figuring out a position that works. But with Tony… it’s like they slot into place, like they’re two puzzle pieces.
Tony grins boyishly. Then his gaze shifts over Steve’s shoulder to the window. “You can see the stars tonight,” he says softly.
died. If Steve hadn’t been close enough to grab his hand so they could share the Gauntlet’s power between them, if the rest of their army hadn’t realized what they were doing and grabbed onto them as well, things might have been very different.
“Huh,” Tony says thoughtfully. He drums his fingers on the counter, tilting his head as he thinks about it. “It’s not worst idea.”
“It’s alright, darling. I’m right here. This—” He lets go with one hand to gesture at the theater. Steve immediately misses him. “This is just an interpretation, and not a very good one at that. It’s like
you’re not stupid enough to brave the subway at this hour.”
refused? Tony,
the house, with its ski slopes and fireplaces stretching to the ceiling and hot cocoa makers in the kitchen.
Steve opens his mouth, intent on offering up something—he doesn’t know what, but he can’t stay quiet.
Tony: But grand gestures can also go incredibly right. We like to tell horror stories because a love of the macabre is a thing and there’s nothing humans like more than hearing about other people failing miserably, but there’s a reason grand gestures are considered romantic. Maybe you’re madly in love with your college roommate and he invites you to spend the summer with him, but you’ve already got plans with another friend, so you tell him you can’t go. But you know that his birthday is on the fourth of July and that he was really disappointed you couldn’t be there, so you surprise him at the fireworks and ask him out. Wouldn’t you say that’s romantic, Steve?
“She came to me. Her and that guy—he calls himself Professor X—I mentioned have been talking about their kind becoming more prominent, and they thought the best way would be by working with the Avengers.”
Steve: And one of your coworkers is jealous of the two of you.
“Not firing. Just… letting go. I’ll let you two finish out the year to October, give you some time to find new jobs, and then we’ll part ways. It’s been a good run, but surely you boys didn’t think it would be forever.”
at them!”
“Other person? You mean Dottie?”
Steve: I don’t know, two hundred might be grander.
Tony lets out a high-pitched yelp that he’ll later deny, drops the rock, and spins around. Steve is standing there, hands shoved deep in his pockets. His white cape flutters in the breeze, the glowing symbols along its hem catching Tony’s attention.
Tony sighed. “No, I guess not. But I do get tired of the screaming. No one should have to listen to that at four in the afternoon.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again. “I wish I had a better reason than I didn’t want you to tell me it was a mistake talking to him.”
It was only because Steve was already looking at Tony that he saw the minute tightening of Tony’s expression, but it was there for barely an instant before he smoothly followed up Steve’s brushing off with a jab to Steve’s side. It was the only reason he realized Tony was trying to make it
“Once upon a time, there was a princess who woke from a one-hundred year sleep,” he begins, only to stop when Tony frowns. He mumbles something that Steve takes to mean as that’s not how the story begins. “I know that’s not how it begins. This is the next part in the story.” Tony hums and settles back down, which Steve takes as permission to continue. “Once upon a time, there was a princess who woke from a one-hundred year sleep. The prince who woke her hadn’t expected her to wake up, so he didn’t know what to do with her and he left her alone. The princess felt very lost in this new time period.”
Steve moved to sit up, but the woman’s hands were firm on his shoulders, pushing him back down. There was something bundled under his head, a makeshift pillow on the snowy ground; the cold was seeping through Steve’s uniform, chilling the scales of his armored shirt and soaking the places where it got through to the leather.
"Who knows," Tony says. "It could still happen. It took us a while."
Steve sits on the edge of the bed, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. "When?"
Steve laughs softly, allowing Bucky to lead him off with a hand clapped on his back; he glances shyly back at Tony, and Tony smiles in return before Steve gets out of sight.
“I thought you were Jarvis,” she said.
Steve caught on that she was joking, but it was too late to stop himself from reflexively choking on a bite of pizza crust. Natasha leaned over and patted him on the back a bit more firmly than was strictly necessary.
. The last remaining sphere zipped around the perimeter of its boundaries, then shot forward with a sudden burst of speed; Tony ducked down low, pushing up with the shield to pummel the sphere mid-flight, and came to land on his knees as the sphere spiraled up and crashed into the ceiling in a small plume of smoke.
Steve was impressed, watching Iron Man clunk toward the dilapidated castle entrance, that the armor had reached such a level of mobility. Since he first began to work with Iron Man, the armor had been streamlined down, shrunken a good thirty percent; in its earlier depictions in the magazines, it was even a few heads taller than it was back in 1940. Now, it stood merely a head above Steve himself, coming in at just short of seven feet high.
of Madripoor is another matter, but Tony calls in a few favors and eventually has the lot shipped back to New York, along with himself.
Steve looked down at his plate, frowning. "He invited me to a New Year's Eve party," he said. "I can't tell if he trusts me all that much, or if he's just friendly. I can't imagine he's gotten this far on his own by taking everyone at face value."
That was enough to smooth Tony’s ruffled feathers; Steve got a smile in return. “Sentimental,” Tony accused, teasing, his lips nearly close enough to Steve’s for them to touch.
His explanation was cut short by the bellow of the Krampus: "YOU HAVE ALL BEEN NAUGHTY!"
Tony reached out for Steve as Steve lined himself up and began to press inside; Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's shoulders and took him easily, rocking his own hips up until Steve was all the way inside.
"I'm Steve's friend, not his mother," she said.
"I need to get in there," he said. "Coulson briefed me on all the complications, and I've been thinking it over: I'm still a Stark Industries shareholder. I come back, get him to accept me back into the fold - publicly, he can't afford to reject me - and I'm pretty sure I can find the incriminating information that SHIELD needs to do away with him."
Steve unloaded the dishwasher from the night before, and washed up the rest of the dirty dishes the old fashioned way. He'd just dried his hands and begun to plot breakfast when his phone pinged with a text message. It was from Tony, just a generic "Merry Christmas!" that was probably mass-texted to a lot of people.
, and he neatly filed away that information - along with the mention of Tony's friend 'Rhodey' - for later investigation. It was clear by now, though, that Tony knew who he was ... and simply chose to live life as Tony Carbonell, rather than Tony Stark.
Steve scowls. "What?"
, Tony.”
“Don't tell me,” Tony says, holding up a hand. “We've won the war, Old Adolf’s called it all off.”
Steve signed and folded the note when he was done, and offered it to Dum-E. "Can you make sure he gets this?"
"Personally," said Tony, a mischievous grin quirking his lips. "If not professionally."
Steve shifted to one side without thinking, and grunted as the bullet made impact with his torso. He could tell from the expression on Tony's face that Tony didn't register what had just happened, at least until the spread of blood began to seep through Steve's sweater, warm under Tony's palm.
past, either. He began to pop open the containers, which had a spread of several different dishes, fried and steamed rice, egg rolls, and even some dumplings.
Steve tries to remain still, even while practically vibrating with anticipation, while Tony begins to move. It's slow going at first, shallow thrusts, and in spite of Steve's impatience he knows it's for the best; Tony does take very good care of Steve, and in this case he almost certainly knows better.
Tony is not himself, that much is clear to Steve, but a lot can happen to change a man in two years. Tony hadn't taken it well when they dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and he'd gone missing shortly thereafter, while Steve was still preoccupied helping the cleanup efforts in Europe.
Tony stared back at him.
close to a conclusion.
“But you’re not seeing the whole picture, Stark,” Steve said, stepping over to point at the video. “Zoom in here and filter the audio.”
Tony seems determined to make this worth their wait, dragging things out as he adds a second finger and stretches both slowly, gradually working Steve open, until Steve is a panting, writhing mess beneath him.
"Seeing you again. You didn't write," Steve blurts. "Let me know you were even alive."
Tony sagged against Steve in the seconds after, and Steve rolled all the way onto his front, grabbing Tony’s wrist to haul him along. Tony was not a small man, but his weight was just solid and comforting along Steve’s back. Steve was feeling too blissful to worry about much except for the kisses Tony was still showering on his shoulders and neck, the warm breath and tickling scratch of Tony’s beard on his skin, for a few minutes, at least.
Steve frowns. "I'm sorry -"
"Yeah," Tony said. "I mean, aside from idiots throwing themselves in front of bullets for me."
"May I?"
Pepper closes her notebook, but keeps twiddling the pencil between her fingers. Coming up with ideas for
“The Captain? Ha!” Falcon said. “Good luck with that. No one’s ever seen him. I bet he doesn’t even exist.”
Tony’s jaw dropped, and he knew he looked ridiculous with his mouth hanging open, as he searched for words. “I ... what?”
“Look!”
"Stark himself is the only option now."
"I only have eyes for a particular fellow," Tony confides. "Who's strong and brave ..."
take me adventuring."
Steve shrugged. "I don't know. Better safe than sorry, right?"
By the time Natasha caught up with him an hour later, Steve had made the rounds, met a few of his 'fellow' teachers, and eventually followed the action out onto the dock and watched while the group launched the rocket into the sky. Natasha described the house and its decor - which seemed to consist of a lot of framed movie posters and other odd memorabilia on the walls and shelves - as 'nerd chic,' and slipped off to go snooping around the rest of the place.
In the wake of his second orgasm in not so many hours, Tony feels ridiculously boneless and even less like getting out of bed than he had before suggesting a round of sleepy morning sex. Anthony seems similarly lazy, smooshed up against Steve's back, and for once, even Steve is content to get in a few hours more sleep.
"I think I'm going to hang around here today," Steve said. "Until the party."
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said.
"This isn't a bet, Agent Barton," said Coulson, crossing the room to sit down at his desk.
"I don't know," Tony says, grinning as he straightens to his knees in bed, letting the covers slip away. "I was sort of hoping you'd be the one taking that role, here."
When Steve arrives at the harbor, he finds Captain Namor at the docks just as he requested. A part of him is surprised to find the pirate there, standing on the deck of the
Steve frowned, looking down at his pizza. Ordinarily, he would have inhaled the slice by now, but he found himself sidetracked by the conversation and its implications.
Tony made a grouchy noise, but it was pretty half-hearted. "Fine," he conceded. "What about a gentle, non-bruise-aggravating cuddle?"
Steve tucks the vial inside his coat pocket, and glances around the lab again to assess his options. If he stays, it's just himself and a handgun against however many men are on the other side of that door. Even if Steve is a very lucky shot and has enough ammunition for them all, the lab provides minimal chances of cover should he be rushed.
“The powerless one is right,” Thor said in his deep, rumbling voice.
"Come on," Tony said. "My old man went out looking for you on a semi-regular basis. He was obsessed. Of
"The last I saw of him, six months ago."
Enough that, one night, as they were basking in the afterglow of a couple of amazing blowies, Steve rested his hand on Tony’s abdomen, rucking up the sweat-damp fabric of his shirt, and asked the blunt question: “Why don’t you ever get undressed?”
Flushing with embarrassment, Steve hurriedly rolled to his feet and held out a hand to Tony. "Sorry," he apologized quickly, with no idea how he was going to recover from this one.
Steve heads into the 'kitchen,' which is a tiny area shoved into the corner like an afterthought, sporting only a short length of counter, a sink, and a hotplate. He knows better than to drink the water, even as thirsty as he is, so he turns to the table instead.
"That's too bad," Steve said. He felt a bit ashamed for having suspected those canceled plans were fabricated, before.
create certain clauses in his will, to protect your right to the company," Natasha pointed out, surprising him.
"Hi." Tony smiled, and Steve was impressed with the sudden notion that Tony was, in fact, quite handsome. He looked particularly good in a festive red sweater and dark jeans that hugged his hips and thighs in all the right ways. Tony did, in fact, seem to be in remarkably good shape for a man past the age of forty; only the laugh lines at the corners of his eyes, and the bits of gray shot through his dark hair, betrayed signs of his years.
The corner of Tony’s mouth quirked in a smile. “I’m betting my life on all of you.”
"Maybe later," Steve agrees. He reaches for Tony's drink - just a glass of seltzer water and lime; Tony swears he's going to treat his liver right this time around - and takes a sip. "The weather's so nice here. I'm going to freeze to death when I get back to New York."
For one night in Madripoor, it's like Tony Stark has stepped back in time. The illegal weapons expo, held in Hightown's largest and most grandiose conference center, is packed with so many faces from international most wanted lists that Tony could earn himself a favor from nearly every country in the U.N., if not for Madripoor's non-extradition laws. Tony raises more than a few eyebrows with his mere presence at the event, even as he goes about rubbing elbows with arms dealers like he still belongs among them. It will probably be his last time in such circles, at any rate; smuggling Captain America into the party is a great way to ensure that Tony never gets invited back.
“Of all the ...” Tony muttered. “JARVIS, enact Dr. Jekyll Protocol, engage with the Captain -- defensive mode, and retreat. Take the long way home.”
“Hey, I spent my last quarter at the lemonade stand.” Tony grinned briefly, but it was replaced by a serious expression soon enough. “Seriously, Steve. You wanna talk about it?”
He didn't approach things from the same air of
“Iron Man uses stolen Stark Tech,” Tony said seamlessly, the same old line he had been giving Agent Coulson for years, except when it came to Steve, the words left a sour taste in his mouth. Even if it wasn’t entirely a lie; Iron Man
“And in the morning, we’ll make breakfast for the kids, like good parents,” Tony added, grinning over his shoulder.
a genius,” Tony said, going for levity, but Steve clearly wasn’t buying it. When Steve sat down on the edge of the bed next to him, Tony sighed.
"Howard's still
Steve checks his watch in the slant of sunlight coming in through the apartment's single, poorly shuttered window, and forces his feet onto the floor.
"Here," Tony said, juggling the boxes awkwardly again as he fished his phone out of his pocket. He extended it to Steve. "Put in your number, I'll text you my address."
Steve certainly couldn't deny that a spark had been there, but Peggy's role in the newly formed SHIELD was at odds with Steve's position as, technically, her subordinate. Peggy had worked very hard to get where she was, too hard to give it all up to resolve a conflict of interest. Steve never would have expected her to set her career aside for his sake - even if she'd offered, which she hadn't - and anyway, Steve had never quite gotten over his own wartime romance. Peggy knew it, too, even if she was kind enough to not mention it.
Beneath him, Tony began to shake; Steve pulled back and realized, after a moment, Tony was shaking not with fear or cold, but with
Steve wakes in the wee hours of the morning and rolls over to look at Tony, who is still sound asleep; he always had the ability to sleep through anything during the war, and never did like having to get up early. Steve reaches out and gently brushes a curl of hair off Tony's forehead, and tries to sort through his own jumbled emotions.
"So, Cap," he said, pretending his voice wasn't as strained as it obviously was. "What did you want to talk about?"
“Can I ...” Tony breathed, rocking harder against Steve.
Steve still couldn't figure it out. If what this Anthony Stark wanted was to live a quiet, normal life, then who were they to deny him that?
Natasha gave one of her secretive half-smiles. "I did. I'm afraid that, until we determine whether Stane has more eyes on you in the area, then it's for the best that you don't return home."
Anthony runs a hand through his hair, ruffling it from its already messy state into something even more disheveled. "No, I was just having trouble sleeping. I should've realized you two would be, um - in the middle of something. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, I'm - I'm gonna go."
Steve shook his head, tossing Tony down on top of the covers. "I don't think they're a thing," he said. "And if they
“I trust I’m in very good hands with you, Steve,” Tony answered. “And you can update my file on that.”
“Oh,” Steve gasped.
"I'm not breaking up with you," Steve went on, more gently now. "But I
"I don't," Steve insists.
(Then again, Tony hadn’t
Tony leans toward Steve ever so slightly, and Steve has just begun to curve toward him, and Tony begins to believe this might be the end of Steve's cautious, reasonable, and completely inconvenient rule ...
Anthony goes at it with enthusiasm, licking and sucking and going slack when he needs to, letting Tony thrust into his mouth, relaxing his throat until Tony can just fuck right into him, and the rhythm of Steve's hips helps, the way he moves with Anthony bringing them all rhythmically closer together. Steve leans over Anthony, and he's got Anthony's legs nearly pushed up against his chest, bending him between them, as Steve winds his hand around the back of Tony's neck and catches Tony's mouth with his own for a kiss. Tony cups Steve's cheek in his hand and returns the kiss, messy and dirty and
"Yes, why -"
"I'm not," Natasha said. "I'm being friendly." She paused, pulling a book from a shelf; she remembered Steve adding it to his list of things he needed to check out in the twenty-first century, so she added it to her shopping basket.
Jim shakes his head. “Namor wouldn’t waste his time if it was junk.”
"Dental records and DNA tests may not be enough, given we'd have to explain how we obtained those things, but he's certainly the type who would almost ... appreciate being caught in a lie. Have respect for his adversary, maybe," Coulson concluded.
"Sorry," Anthony says. "I'll just -"
Virginia Potts, exclusive for
Steve sat up on the couch - which thankfully had been deep enough to accommodate them both, with some intimate levels of spooning - and only took a moment of looking around before he spotted Tony at work at his massive computer terminal across the way.
"You're right. This time we were actually prepared." Tony folds one arm under his head, and strokes his free hand over Steve's shoulder.
“Always looking out for me, Cap.” Tony smiled up at the ceiling. “But don’t worry. I’m not naive.”
Steve goes quiet for a moment. "I thought you never cared about that," he says at last, finally allowing his hands to drop to his sides.
"Yeah. Thanks." Tony was, at that point, fairly certain that he had actually coaxed JARVIS into hitting the snooze button, and he was still sound asleep, lost in mixed-signal dreams of fantastic sex and weird domesticity with Captain America. He pinched himself, just to be sure; the spot on his forearm twinged, and reality didn't change around him.
"Of course I won't," Steve says. "Your secret is safe with me."
Steve swept Tony into his arms once they were both undressed, prompting a soft yelp and a laugh from Tony as Steve carried him toward the bed.
Tony exhaled in a rush before looking up with bloodshot eyes that, alarmingly, had dark circles under them. He spent a moment staring in confusion at Steve before his head jerked toward the clock and he deflated visibly. “Steve. I’m sorry, I forgot you were coming, I -”
Fortunately, Steve didn’t hold it against him. They were grown men who knew they came from different worlds, and Tony had long since come to realize that Steve would always consider what Tony thought of as normal to be excess, and Tony would think of Steve as frugal, practical, overly cautious, if he was being generous.
"And these?" Steve wonders.
Steve raised a dubious eyebrow. “I hope you’re not actually going to call it that.”
Steve stopped, abruptly, his hand on the small of Tony's back. "Hang on," he said between kisses. "Wait --"
Tony took his time now, palming Steve through his sweatpants, until Steve’s cock was hard and straining against the fabric. Steve made a sound that came out much more like a whimper than he would readily admit to, his hips reflexively moving into the touch. He pressed back and found that Tony was just as hard, and the contact of Steve’s ass brushing against him inspired a muffled curse from Tony.
Steve looked at his reflection in the mirror again, took a deep breath, and let it out in a sigh. "As I'll ever be."
Steve shifted until his cock slid down between Tony's thighs; Tony made a soft, surprised sound as the head of it nudged against the back of his balls, but it quickly turned into a moan as Steve crowded Tony up against the shower wall. Steve picked up a languorous rhythm, and Tony brought in his knees and pressed his thighs closer together. The water made things a little easier, but the friction was still great enough to compel Steve into an unhurried pace.
it turns out that there are dozens of her scattered across universes), that Tony finds out the truth.
They slide beneath the covers and Tony goes out like a light, but it's a long time before Steve can quiet the swirl of thoughts in his head enough to follow into sleep.
"Ah."
"I don't," Steve answers quickly. "I thought that might come when the food I ordered gets here. We do have a little while before he wakes up, right?"
Tony was pretty sure he needed a lot more than aspirin right now, but it was the thought that counted, right?
"I'm sorry," Steve says. "It's just - really, a marvel of modern warfare."
Steve makes his way up Tony's chest again, and plants a kiss on his lips.
"The last few months of the war," she answers. "Without anyone pulling the strings, it's probably taken longer than usual to manifest. SHIELD believes that Tony Stark brought Berthold Sternberg here to help research a cure - and Hydra believes that Sternberg successfully broke down the formula as part of that. The leader of the new regime, Madame Hydra, feels that another Zemo would be a threat to her power - but the Zemo formula is an extremely potent mind control drug, and who knows what she could do with that."
Steve shakes his head. "What could you have done?"
“A thousand and one,” the Hulk added.
Neither knew the other’s name, or even a face behind the helmet or mask, but that sort of thing didn’t matter so much as knowing they had each other’s back, and there was no doubt about that.
If Tony hadn't let his personal vendetta get in the way and insisted on going after von Strucker himself, if he had

"Oh?" Tony asked, before he broke off, blinking. "
need was to get out from under the shadow of his heritage for a while.
"Are you kidding?" Steve asked. "If you don't think that was sexy ..." He skimmed a hand down Tony's thigh, and back up again, to take him in hand.
For most of the world, Tony Stark in a suit was nothing new; one could simply run the man's name through Google and the first few hundred results - well, with SafeSearch on at least - would be a mixed batch of the Iron Man armor and Tony looking like he had just walked out of some board room or charity gala.
Tony was hard, cock straining against the fabric of his briefs, and he moaned into the kiss with something that sounded like relief once Steve had his clothes out of the way. Everything was much better naked, of course; their hips slotted together and Steve’s hands came around to rest on Tony’s ass, encouraging the way that Tony rocked against him.
Steve looked up to see Tony leaning against the big front desk.
Tony breaks into a sweat that has nothing to do with the fireplace warming the room, adrenaline spiking in his veins and sending his heart racing.
There was no teasing or pretense in the way Steve went about things. He stroked his hand over Tony's length a few times, then took Tony right into his mouth. Tony was no blushing virgin by any means, but Steve's mouth was hot and wet and his tongue was very clever, and watching Captain America give him head was something Tony didn't think he would ever quite get used to.
separate occasions he’d bonked into the wall) had latched onto Tony, so it was only right that they took both animals home.

“Wow,” Tony breathes.
“I didn’t say you were the one in denial.” Maybe he hadn’t said it, but it certainly sounded like he
He tries not to think about what he’ll do if Tony tells him he won’t help get Bucky home.
“I—yeah, okay, fair point, but this isn’t the time for that either. I want to come with you.”
She giggles, twirling a strand of her hair around her finger. There’s a strange scent of roses in the air that’s growing stronger, and Steve finds himself sort of swaying towards her. “That’s so cute! No, I’m helping out at Hank’s clinic, just down the road, you know it? And he wanted me to take a couple business classes over at the college in Elmdale, but
He wants to protest, point out that Bucky wouldn’t have to fight if he came back to New York, but he can’t promise that. New York is a lot more visible than this small village. If Bucky came back, even if all he did was stay in the Compound, Steve can’t promise that he wouldn’t be pressured into fighting again as reporters clamored to know why he wasn’t fighting with the Avengers. He doesn’t want to force anyone into having to do something they don’t want to, and he knows Bucky wouldn’t blame him, but he doesn’t want to put him in that position in the first place. And Bucky looks happy here. He’s clearly built a life here with his goats and his home and the knitting Steve spots in the corner near his bed.
“I’d like to go back to that. Let’s do that again.”
Tony blinks once before a heated look steals over his face. He purrs, “And just where would you like to start?”
“Please don’t ask.”
So he tells him about Clint saying he missed Tony, Bruce, and Thor; about Natasha doing yoga on her own, leaving it up for Tony to figure it out on his own that she misses doing yoga with him; about Sam doing routine maintenance on Redwing and starting to say something to the empty air only to realize that Tony isn’t right there beside him, tinkering on his own project.
Pierce was waiting for them when they left the sound booth. “There you are!” he exclaimed, spreading his hands wide. “My two favorite boys! Walk with me.”
“Yeah?” he asked, hoping Tony wanted something else.
Steve winced. “Tony, I don’t think—”
He exhales slowly, taking Tony in. Tony looks a little more rested than he did the last time Steve saw him, the shadows under his eyes not so deep and dark. He still looks tired though and he’s still moving rather gingerly like the injuries he sustained in Siberia are bothering him even almost two months later. Not for the first time, there’s a pang of guilt in Steve’s heart. But just like with his letter, he’s still not sure how to apologize in any sort of meaningful way.
an incredibly Tony thing to do and yet it feels wholly unexpected to Steve. “He’s really doing that for them?” he asks, just seeking to double check.
Tony glares at him.
“Oh but Tony, think of
Even having only lived in this tiny town in the middle of nowhere for a couple weeks, Steve knows who the Starks are. Luis had been more than happy to give him the rundown on the Starks the same day he’d moved into Luis’s spare bedroom: how they’d lost their entire family fortune thanks to their corrupt CFO, how they’d been left with only a single asset—the town Maria Stark had bought as a joke almost fifteen years ago—how they’ve been living in the Schitt’s Creek Motel for the last two years. He hasn’t met any of them yet but then he’s been so busy trying to pull himself back together since leaving New York that the Starks probably could have paraded themselves around Luis’s living room naked and he wouldn’t have noticed, so for all he knows, he’s seen them multiple times.
“Technically, Shuri did. She attended the last session of the Accords Committee and apparently, something about Ross struck her as off, so she did some digging,” Tony says.
“I’m sorry,” someone says behind him.
“Come on, baby,” he urges into Steve’s mouth. “Come for me.”
“Thanks,” he said, giving Tony a soft smile. Tony brightened—how had Steve missed how worried he’d looked that his gesture might be taken the wrong way?—and nodded right as the On Air light turned on.
“Huh,” Steve commented. “Didn’t think you were the type to want to park in the lot.”
Tony isn’t in his hotel room when Steve breaks in, carrying a bag with a couple skewers of chicken that he picked up from a vendor down the street. He sets the bag down and settles down in one of the armchairs next to the balcony to wait. It isn’t long before Tony walks in, looking entirely unsurprised to see Steve already there. Steve pushes the bag towards him; Tony looks stretched thin, like he hasn’t been eating enough since the last time they saw each other. It wouldn’t surprise him to find out Tony’s only been eating one to two meals a day; feeding Tony had been Steve’s job when they were still a team. He doesn’t know if there’s anyone taking care of him now. When Tony’s face lights up with a bright smile, he knows he made the right call stopping to grab food.
“Hey now, the dancing horse has a name.”
him. He knew better now. It had only been a matter of time before Tony ran from him too, and now he was doing it again.
is a sparkly rock that Tony found down by the riverbank this morning. In the sunlight, it shines with the same colors as Steve’s ice, and he thinks it makes for a very lovely courting gift.
“Fuck off, you knew what I meant.” Bucky jabs at the tickets Steve’s holding. “Look, it’s been a long couple of years for all of us and you could use something to make you laugh. Trust me, this will
. For a moment, he wonders if Janet is doing her thing again but he can’t smell roses and she’s more focused on Tony right now anyway.
“Rude,” Tony says conversationally. “Guess you’ll have to do the job of warming me up.”
“Can’t sleep?” she asks gently, once Tony is tucked up beside her. He shakes his head, rubbing his forehead against her side. “That’s alright. I can’t sleep the first night in a new house either.”
He knows the answer, even as he asks it: Colonel Rhodes is there with Tony, Colonel Rhodes, who will never again be able to fly War Machine; Vision, who spends more time with Wanda in their rented hotel rooms than he does in New York; and a child whose name Steve still doesn’t know, who is in no way ready to be an Avenger. And he winces, because by this point, his letter will have reached Tony. His letter, in which he’d given the team to Tony and called them his, only they’re not, are they? Because he looks around the cramped safehouse and he realizes—he hadn’t left Tony with anyone really, had he? Out of the original team, Clint had stood by him all along, Bruce and Thor are gone, and now Nat’s come to join him. He had always had Sam and Wanda, and Vision might as well be with them, for all the time he spends with Wanda. Even T’Challa, so firmly supportive of the Accords, has gone behind the UN’s back to give Steve and his team assistance.
Tony: And if you’re really concerned that you’re not going to find someone else, then I really think you need to be asking yourself why you have that concern.
“They’re puns,” Tony says, wrinkling his nose to show what he thinks of that. “Like night mares?”
“Believe me, I was as surprised as you are. But they are bestsellers apparently at the Elmdale Craft Fair.”
“Pierce isn’t stupid. Cancelling us would be like cancelling the whole damn station. He’s not gonna do it. We bring in too many listeners.” The more he talked about it, the stronger he felt in his conviction. This might have been the first time they’d ever heard rumors about the show being cancelled, but it just wasn’t something that made sense.
“I didn’t know it was him,” Steve tells him again. He’ll tell him as many times as Tony needs to hear it before he’ll believe it. He never would have hurt Tony like that, never would have
Just a quick note for y'all: people who've seen the show will recognize this chapter as the Sebastian Raine episode, only told from Steve's POV (because I will always be sad that we didn't get Patrick in that episode; still, that's why fanfic's for, right?). For anyone who's not seen the show, this chapter deals with an ex from Tony's past coming to town, duping Howard, and Tony seducing them to get the information he needs. This is fully consensual on Tony's part, though it's not something he really wants to do, and since the whole chapter is from Steve's perspective anyway, I've decided again not to use the dubcon tag. But I just wanted to keep y'all informed
Sam blinks at him. “What?”
store. It’s basically an apothecary? Like the last one but this one will definitely not sell rat poison next to the lust potions and—” He gets cut off by the voicemail telling him he’s out of time.
Steve pretended he didn’t hear it and started walking toward the nearby parking garage. Technically, Hydra staff had their own parking lot behind the building, but Steve had heard from multiple staff members that it was a downright nightmare to try to get in and out of. And Tony was an impatient driver at best, so Steve would be willing to bet Tony parked in the garage one block over instead of in the lot.
He closes his eyes while he catches his breath, eventually managing to say, “I’d offer you a bath to clean you up and get you warm again, but you’re SOL this time.”
“It was an emergency,” he tells her, even though he knows she’s too young to really understand. “You know I try to make my trips as short as I can, but sometimes I gotta stick around longer than I want. But I’ll always come back to you, Maguna. Don’t think I could ever just leave you behind.”
“You don’t trust him?” Steve asks, eyes following the swish of the Dora’s coat as she turns the corner.
“How’s it any different than listening to that screaming you call music?”
Tony blinks. “But Pepper said you give each other gifts.” If that blasted Wind Spirit
and travel the galaxy.
“Won’t say no to that offer,” Clint says, climbing to his feet. He pauses in the door and looks back at Steve. “I miss them too.”
“You know what they say, the best way to get over someone is to get under—”
Which means one of two things, because Bucky is a troll who can’t resist needling him: either his character ends the show by marrying Sharon or by kissing Bucky. Those seem to be the two people that he gets paired off with the most often whenever people on the internet, both fans or press, decide to start speculating about his love life again. After all, no one has ever guessed that he and Tony got married in a private ceremony after the Snap five years ago, and it’s not like either of them have been particularly secretive about that.
Someone knocks on the front door.
“What’s this?” he asked. Tony hadn’t brought him coffee in weeks. Surely he wouldn’t do it out of the blue like this.
“Yeah you’re a regular Captain America,” Tony says dryly.
He can see the way Tony hesitates for just a second before tucking that soft smile away, and he immediately regrets his words. But it’s too late, Tony is already putting the frame down and saying, “Well, thank gods for that, I was just thinking this frame is a little too modern for the store.”
. That’s interesting.
To his relief, Tony cracked one eye open and grinned at him. “Yeah? Sounds bendy.”
By the time rush hour had rolled around, Steve felt reasonably caught up on what was going on in the world of
Steve frowns. That’s—that’s actually really terrible. “Your mom is—”
“Then there’s a time for it to be too early for Halloween.”
“…So they’re not true?” Steve asked eventually.
“You know what, Romanoff,” Tony begins.
“What, that it was easier to close than it was to open?”
“She was a fully-grown adult, albeit one who was angry and brainwashed by Hydra. But even you can’t deny that her abilities have incredible destructive power. She’s a little Hermione gone rogue.” At Steve’s confused look, Tony adds, “You know, because she’s got the magic powers and she’s really powerful and—you know what, never mind, it was a bad analogy. Point is, she put Vision through several floors of the Compound and that’s when she was only a
was one of the only dating advice radio shows out there, something that had only boosted its popularity as people with no other similar shows to listen to had tuned in in addition to the people listening for specifically Steve and Tony, and it had proven to be extremely profitable over the last three years. Cancelling it wasn’t in Pierce’s best interest.
And Tony gets it. He smiles, vanishing his clothes away with a thought. “Steve,” he says, taking Steve’s hands in his. They’re wonderfully cool on his heated skin, and he wonders how they’ll feel on the rest of him. “Steve, you can look. I want you to.”
But then, as they walk toward the fairgrounds, Tony shifts the gift bag to his other hand and slips the one closest to him into Steve’s hand. Steve almost stops walking, he’s so surprised, but manages to keep moving just barely. Tony’s hand is small and warm in his, fingers slotting perfectly between his own. It feels so right Steve wonders how he went his entire life without this.
“Undecided,” Steve repeats, wondering why on earth Tony would come to file his incorporation papers if he doesn’t even have a name for the business.
“Music?”
“Ty,” Tony supplies, and Rhodey relaxes a little. If he’s thinking of the right Ty, then he’s only a year older than Tony and not an adult. It’s still only a little though—if the Ty he’s thinking of is the right Ty, then Rhodey should have warned Tony away from him a very long time ago based on his reputation alone.
“And isn’t that potion only good for five days?”

Tony doesn’t startle though, only slowly lowers back to the ground before turning around and blinking confusedly at Steve. “What are you doing here?” he asks.
“Aren’t they all?” she asks innocently.
have realized that and sent a text or called to let Tony know that he’d be stopping by.
-ing at everything in sight.
“Oh yes. You see, Steve was very silly, and he wasn’t watching where he was going…”
Steve: Look, I get it. You convince yourself you’ve found the one, only they don’t want to admit it, so instead you just keep ending up doing this dance, but like you said, it’s not healthy for you. It’s time to leave. Cut your losses and go. I know it sucks to hear it, but there are other people out there. This woman isn’t the only one.
It still looks like Tony is going to refuse and turn, but then Tony surprises him by saying, “Okay.”
“Probably? Man, you told one hundred and seventeen countries where to stick it. It’s definitely too late.”
“I wish I knew,” he says, soft enough that Tony might not have heard him. “But you’ve got your mother and me and Ana and your Aunt Peggy, right?”
“Someone else,” Steve said dryly. “Not to get under the same person.”
Steve blinked, then, “
Well, he always did like people who knew what they wanted and went after it. His smile broadened. “I guess not.”
spends those few days wandering around in the tiniest scraps of silk and lace known to man.
“A salad, huh?” Steve asks, dropping his bags in the hall. He rolls up his own sleeves and takes his place next to Tony, who moves away as soon as he takes up the knife. Steve watches out of the corner of his eye as Tony checks on some sort of sauce on the stove, stirring it twice before smiling and putting a lid on top of it as he turns the heat to low. Tony looks tired again but he’s moving easier than he was the last time they saw each other. “Didn’t take you for the salad type of person.”
“Huh,” Steve says cautiously, a little concerned about where this is going.
“Or at least give them more than a cursory look.”
“Scared? Of us? Tony, we’re just here to help.”
Tony taps nervously on the thing in his chest. Steve passes him a bundle of pajamas, complete with the spare toothbrush on top, just so Tony’s frenetic energy might calm down. It only sort of works. Tony stops tapping on the thing, but his fingers drum on the pile of clothes instead. Steve is just getting ready to ask him what that thing is when Tony says:
“Fuck,” he says heavily, startling a laugh out of Natasha.
Tony rather likes winter, which is probably an odd thing for the Fire Spirit to say, but it’s true. Winter is when people actually
He turned back to Tony, intending on commenting on the strangeness of—the strangeness of… He couldn’t remember. He strained, trying to recall what they were talking about, but there was a blank spot in his mind.
—but then the head popped inside like it belonged there. Tony moaned loudly—at the tightness, the heat, or the sensation, Steve didn’t know; for once, Tony wasn’t being talkative—and tossed his head back. Steve sank down a few more inches, forcing himself to take it.
Tony: Please don’t. I like your mom.
“Thanks,” Tony said quietly. There was a red flush high on his cheeks that Steve would have called a blush if he didn’t know any better. Tony Stark didn’t blush; he once streaked naked through the quad because someone dared him. “I—uh—I wanted to say I’m sorry about what happened last week. I should have asked for clarification back when we started this thing; I shouldn’t have just assumed.”
Sometimes, Steve glances up from the cash register to where Tony is helping a customer. Tony always seems to know when Steve is looking at him because without fail, every time he looks back over at Steve. They share a mutual look of baffled wonderment—he’d known that Tony had a good idea with the store, but even he hadn’t expected this level of popularity—before they both go back to their work.
“Because,” Sam starts and then drops down heavily to sit on the bed. He leans forward, hands clasped in that counselors pose that Steve recognizes from the few times he’s attended meetings at the VA. “You know I was a double major in college?” It seems like a non sequitur but Steve waits him out. “Psychology, obviously, but also history. I had this idea of working with minorities, using cultural history to explain psychological differences or something like that. Didn’t get much further than a vague dream before Riley enlisted and I followed right after him. Point is, Ross said that he wanted to keep track of our abilities and all I heard was another 1930s Germany. I figured that’s what you heard too.”
“So you’re discontinuing the show,” he said, trying hard not to snarl.
“Of course I would,” Steve says firmly. He keeps eye contact with Tony, silently promising him that he would never hide something that big from him. He thinks Tony gets it by the way he slowly releases the tension in his hunched shoulders. Steve smiles at him, wishing he could lean over and kiss his cheek. He thinks that could help relax him even further, and anyway, Tony deserves all the kisses in the world. Steve just wants to be the one to give those to him.
Tony shivers and closes the door behind him.
“Hmm, do we really need to exchange names for what we’re going to do?”
“It is when you let me get as close as I was.”
Steve hesitated for a moment, looking at Tony’s still form, but he sighed eventually and left. He grabbed his wallet and phone from where he’d dropped them on the kitchen counter when he and Tony had stumbled through the front door earlier that evening, made sure the lights in the apartment were turned off, and left. The door closed with a soft
He stops. Blinks. Tilts his head curiously. Pepper grins knowingly at him and returns to her spreadsheets. She’s convinced that Obie is embezzling money from SI. Tony, who grew up with Obie, is pretty sure she’s seeing things that aren’t really there, but he likes Pepper a lot and she’s Rhodey’s soulmate, so he’s willing to let her look. Hey, it’s better to be overcautious and find out that there’s nothing there than to tell her there’s nothing to worry about and find out five years down the line that they’ve been dealing under the table, right?
Idly, he wonders if Tony has this many problems trying to work out of a motel room with his family, and that leads him right back to thinking about the frame. He picks up the business license, intending on finally putting it in the frame, only to frown. As an enchanter himself, he can tell when objects have had spells placed on them. Most first-time business licenses come with a spell of good fortune, meant to aid the owner in their first year, but someone must have forgotten Tony’s because he feels nothing from the certificate.
By the time he stops by the store the next day, he’s exhausted after spending most of the night working on the license, but as soon as he steps inside, all that exhaustion melts away. Even though Tony’s clearly going with a more traditional look for the apothecary—all dark wood and plants hanging from the ceiling—he knows how to use the light to his advantage and the space feels large and airy instead of cramped the way a lot of traditional apothecaries feel.
“No problem. He thought I might have some advice, seeing as how I’m the one who fought for him to be allowed to lease the store in the first place, instead of that ridiculous Santa’s Village place.”
“You said that when you were putting up the shelves last week too and I came in to find you straining to hold one up from falling on you, so you’ll have to forgive me if I didn’t believe you.”
“Three.”
Speak of the devil.
He picks up the rock, turning it in his hands. The sunlight catches the sparkles in the rock, lighting them up in shades of red and gold. They’re his favorite colors, but he doesn’t understand. This is the sort of thing that would be a courting gift, but he didn’t see anyone when he was returning to his nest, and anyway, the only person who would be courting him isn’t interested in him.
“What’s wrong with our gear?” Steve asks, looking down at his suit. Sure it’s a little dingier than he’d like but that’s what happens when they’re bouncing from safehouse to safehouse. And besides, it’s all still functioning.
“I know, but I got home early since I sent off
“Okay,” Steve said. “Let’s pour you two into a cab. I’ll see you in the morning.”
“You know my dad’s never told me he loves me. He’s never even told he likes me. So it’s a little hard for me to believe that he paid off all my customers because he wanted me to succeed and not because he didn’t want the Stark name attached to a failure. Now, I’m striking out on my own and I’m hoping I’ll succeed in this town when literally none of the rest of my family is making any money and I want…” He trails off, biting his lip.
“Sorry,” Steve says sincerely. “I didn’t know we’d have company today. Natasha, right? I’m Steve.”
“Amendments.” Tony tilts his head to the side. “Technically, since you haven’t signed, you don’t get to propose any amendments, but…” He glances away nervously, then back at Steve. “But maybe you could bring your ideas to me? We could talk about them at least.”
There’s a sparkly rock in his nest. Tony blinks at it, not understanding. He can feel his fire rising to the surface of his back, sparks dancing along his spine, and he quickly shifts to his human form, not bothering with any sort of ridiculous clothes as he’s alone. It’s easier to control his fire when he’s human.
Steve laughed, but didn’t deny Tony’s claim. “You got changed.”
“Oh no, they’re true,” Pierce said immediately. Steve’s heart sank. “Yeah, I’ve been getting a lot of pressure from some of our focus groups about the way you two run your show. They’re concerned about what some of the children who listen to you might be thinking.”
, he knew, was at least a partial lie. Steve knew for a fact that Tony had stayed up half the night—they’d been together, after all—but Tony was an insomniac who frequently came to work on significantly less sleep than he should and still been as talkative as ever. He never let lack of sleep bother him.
He pushed against it again, straining at the confines of his mind. There was something there, he could
“Well, Wanda sent me out to pick up some oatmeal cream pies while she finished our costumes for the talent show. We’re participating, you know.”
By the time the show was over and Betty had made her goodbyes, Steve was running very late to pick up Sam and Bucky from the airport. He hated being late—Tony was the one who’d always been late for everything when they were dating, though things had clearly changed during the ten years they’d been working separately—but at least he’d had the time to shoot them a quick text to grab an Uber instead of waiting for him back when he’d realized that Betty wanted to talk after the show was over. She was still talking as they made their way outside, clearly flushed with exhilaration from the high of being on the radio. Steve remembered that high. He hadn’t felt it in a few years, used to hosting as he was, but it used to be one of his favorite parts about radio shows.
Scott gets clearance to return home before Clint does. “Makes sense,” Clint says as Scott disappears into T’Challa’s jet. Steve glances at him. “I
, I’m going to donate you to Boston College. I’ll do it.”
Her smile is a little more genuine this time. After a moment, she continues, “As for you and Sam, I thought Rhodey would be able to talk Sam around… and that Tony would do the same for you.”
“But now, you gave me a gift,” Tony says, picking his new rock back up. “Steve, I don’t understand. You’ve been hiding in the human village for weeks, you won’t talk to me, you won’t even
“Got it,” Steve says faintly. Obviously there’s some history there. “Let’s move on. Uh, business address?”
“Yeah, well, I’m doing it for myself, so don’t get too excited,” Tony says in that gruff tone that means he’s lying and a little emotional about what he’s lying about. “I’m tired of Vision leaving the team so he can see Wanda. And I might have found new team members, but it’s not enough to deal with all the threats in the world.”
Then it hits Steve. “Wait, what? You want to know about
“Gods, I don’t think I could have stood seeing his stupid smarmy face a second longer,” Tony mutters, turning to look out the window.
Tony smiles at him and gives him a little wave. “Goodnight, Steve.”
Tony sighs and admits, “I wish you could be too. Would have been a lot easier if I had Captain America behind me.” He takes a sip out of his coffee. “So. You’ve been reading the Accords. What did you think?”
cheating?” he asked eventually.
Tony straightens, making grabby hands for the tablet Steve places on the table. Steve slides it to him, watching intently as Tony flips through the document he had prepared.
He still has hope—he
to have hope. It’s all he has left with Obie in prison and Pepper and Rhodey an ocean away and his aunt’s phone calls getting less and less coherent each time he picks up.
“You can’t see me
“Babe, we need to get a new calendar,” Tony said when Steve walked into the kitchen to start making breakfast. Eggs and toast sounded good, he thought, though Tony would probably have one of his classic smoothies and steal a couple bites from Steve’s toast.
Steve shrugs. “I remember Prague from the war. Wasn’t here very often but I really liked the architecture. Thought it might be nice to lay low here for a little while. And it helps that we’re close enough to Sokovia that Wanda can visit. You? I googled this conference, doesn’t seem like it’s up your alley.”
Tony just blinks at him again and says blankly, “I don’t know what that means.”
She’s being deliberately obtuse. “You’re being deliberately obtuse.”
“Well, yeah.” He falters for an excuse. He can’t just come right out and
Tony blinks at him twice before that small, sweet smile Steve loves so much spreads across his face. “Sure,” he says quietly.
And it might.
“Yeah,” Steve says shakily, squeezing his hand. “This is great.”
“No, no, the other one. She—oh come on, you know who I’m talking about.” Though, now that he was thinking about,
“Nope, which is another reason why we’ll be finding another name for them. They’re holders for good dreams. If you want to have a good night, you open the stopper on the horse’s back—yeah, that thing right there—and you’ll dream about whatever dream the horse was holding.”
“What’s magical?” Wanda asked again, still unexplainably worried. “Nothing should be magical! It should all be perfectly ordinary.”
should,” Steve said dryly. “I trust you in the kitchen only if you’re repairing the oven.”
Tony hesitates. His gaze skitters away and then back to Steve. “Janet has lice,” he mumbles.
They went to bed early that night, Tony wishing again that they could afford one of those fancy single beds for them to share. But those were for people much wealthier than him (people like his parents, something whispered in the back of his mind, though he didn’t know why; his parents were grocers, not millionaires). He looked over at Steve in the bed beside him and felt that disquieting sense still niggling at him. He couldn’t figure out why he had the strangest sense that they didn’t even share a
She signs off. His thoughts turn, as they so often do, to Tony. He needs to tell him. He’s realized the mistake in keeping things from Tony. He can’t keep quiet that Bucky has come out of the ice and is free enough from his words to live alone without fear of someone finding and imprisoning him again. Tony deserves to know that the man who—who killed his parents (even if it hadn’t really been Bucky, he adds to himself) is fully recovered, if only so that he can start making plans to get Bucky home again.
It was—it was the only way Steve could let himself be around Tony without wanting more. It was the only way he could protect himself from letting Tony break his heart all over again. It was the only way he could forget about the ring he’d never sold and buried in a box at the back of his closet because the very thought of it on someone else’s finger, even someone that he didn’t know and would never see, made him want to break down.
“Oh nice,” Tony says, brightening. Steve nods at the drafting table under the window where there’s a folder with the contract inside and a pen. Tony wanders over, leaving his duffel bag on the couch for Steve to look through. He’s selected a matching set of silver bralette and panties to go with the gold ropes when Tony comes back, holding the folder out for him to take.
It’s been less than a month since he realized he’s attracted to men. He’s still trying to figure this whole thing out and even more than he wants to ask Tony out, he doesn’t want Tony to think he’s just an experiment. It’s just… he doesn’t want to ask anyone
“Great,” Steve replies promptly. “Go get changed.”
“I’m sure you are,” Tony said with an easygoing chuckle. “He hasn’t fired anyone since Earl. His wife only prepared one course and Mr. Hart always expects at least three.”
He’s stunned, outraged really. “Those people made you feel bad because you want to be
Tony,” Steve snarled. Couldn’t Tony see how the very thought was making him fall apart?
“I hadn’t thought about it like that, but you’re probably right,” Steve agreed. The rumors about Pierce cancelling their show hadn’t come to an end like he had thought they would. Instead, they’d gotten worse over the week and a half since Tony had first told him about them. Rumlow seemed convinced that they were true, and he’d taken to taunting the two of them every time they passed him in the halls. It was a good thing Lascombe had taken over as their sound technician for the last couple of shows while Rumlow worked with Tiboldt and Bain on their true crime show. Lascombe was also a dick, but at least Steve wouldn’t punch him the way he would punch Rumlow if the guy made one more comment about their show.
“Oh, Steve.”
“Right now, I’ve been working on stalling the creation of the list while I convince the UN that they can keep the SHRA, but the list needs to be in the hands of a superhero, not the UN.”
That does the trick. For whatever reason, Tony
Steve waits, but that’s it. “Anyone else?”
“And yet somehow, I’m not the genius in the family.”
The thing is, Tony is both right and he isn’t. Steve
“What do we say?”
Right. None of that happened. They were all dreams, no matter how real they felt in the moment. What was real was Westview, his neighbors—Wanda and Vision and Agnes and Herb—his husband.
“Yes, we’re performing a magic show.”
Steve actually doesn’t really like the house in Sweden. The home is set high in the mountains, high enough that there’s snow almost all year round. It reminds him just a little too much of the mission in the mountains where he had lost Bucky during the war, though he had always set aside his discomfort because the team absolutely
“Tony,” he says, hoping he doesn’t come across as breathless as he feels. There’s just
He doesn’t want all the girls fawning over him, but Tony’s jaw clenches before Steve can say anything.
“Yeah?”
It was inside their house now, almost up to their feet.
“I used to be respected.”
“The vendor is calling those dreamcatchers,” Tony explains. “But I’m pretty sure that’s culturally appropriative.”
“Yeah.”
Steve hesitates and then goes ahead with what he’s really thinking, “Maybe. But if it’s any consolation, I want to rub our success in Howard’s smug little face too.”
Steve can’t help the relieved breath that escapes him. They’re going
Which.
The next couple of minutes pass by in a blur. It’s not until they’re onboard the Quinjet—Tony has to keep from snickering at the name, since
He drags the bowl of ice closer to him and selects one of the larger cubes, small enough that it’ll slip easily enough into Tony’s unstretched hole, but large enough that it won’t melt right away. He glances up at where Tony is watching him.
“Yeah but I make everything look cooler.” Tony pauses then, gaze roving over Steve’s face like he’s searching for something. He must find an answer somewhere, although Steve isn’t even sure of the question, because he begins, “Natasha said something earlier tonight, so stop me if I’m wrong—”
“Darling,” he murmured sometime later, when his lips felt swollen and Steve’s eyes were blown black when he pulled a few inches away to look at him. “Darling, I think we should take this upstairs.”
“Please what?”
“If you’re trying to make me guilty about—how did you put it?—breaking up the Avengers,” Tony begins.
“Shit, you’re serious? Okay, look, I don’t know who Bucky is, but I’m not a minor, I’m a genius.”
“What kind of strange?” Tony asked, kneeling up on the couch so he could look over the back of it without having to twist.
“Yeah,” he says, “but I like you, and you’re having a bad time of it. So move.”
He was fine.
And whatever Tony was doing now, while weird, didn’t mean that he wanted to get back together. He’d agreed three years ago when they started this whole thing that it was never going to be serious, and he’d never once said that he wanted more. He asked Steve to dinner because he wanted to be friends and when he wanted sex, he asked Steve out for drinks. He tried to get Steve to stay the night because he didn’t want him to get mugged on the way back to his apartment. He offered Steve a ride because he was a decent person. He didn’t like hearing about Steve’s other partners because—well, that was a little harder to explain, but Tony had always been possessive back when they were dating, not just of Steve, but of his friends too, like he’d thought that if Rhodey and Pepper were hanging out with other people, they wouldn’t want to be around him as much. So maybe it was just that he still felt that way, even though Steve wasn’t one of his people anymore.
he decides, when he doesn’t have Stark wearing a suit paired with an incongruous t-shirt standing right in front of him, a haughty expression on his face that’s masking what looks like very deep anxiety (Steve knows, he’s seen that look in the mirror ever since he fled New York).
“I hardly think they’re going to manage to take over the world from Westview, darling.”
Tony throws himself into the snow, smoothly shifting between lizard and human as he leaps. He thinks he hears Steve choke, but he’s too busy rolling around in the snow to pay attention. The cold always feels so
“—as permanent members, it is my honor and my pleasure to introduce Hope van Dyne, Agent Sharon Carter, Maria Hill, and Ororo Munroe.

I will now be taking questions.”

“Hi,” she purred, eyes half-lidded.
Tony opens his mouth to reply, but before he can get a single word out, his stomach growls loudly. Steve glances down at his watch. Huh. It’s a couple hours after they normally grab lunch. Actually… that gives him an idea.
“Well, that narrows things down,” he says, once the door is fully closed.
“You know,” Sam says at one point, “there’s one person who’s not a part of this discussion and should be.”
“Great,” Steve breathes. And now for what to do about the fact that he’ll have to share a bed with someone he’s
He kept believing that right up until Tony shoved one of the coffees under his nose. Steve blinked, eyes crossing in a futile attempt to bring the cup into focus. It smelled exactly like how he preferred it—heavy cream with a dash of vanilla syrup—but he was still having trouble putting the pieces together in his brain.
“Let’s go pack our things, shall we?” She felt him accept her outstretched hand, and led him back to his room.
“They’re still in the hole!”
“I’m ready!” Shouted Thanos, standing excitedly on his chair, “My name is Thanos, and, uh, thank you for letting, um, me come. I’m here to support my mom, and to help her get better!”
Grabbing him by his shoulders, Olive looked into his violet eyes and firmly stated, “Honey, your name was given to you by your first family. They named you that with purpose, and that was the name you carried for a lifetime. You are living a second life now, and this is an opportunity to live happily. To live in peace, with me. So, don’t ever be ashamed of your name.”
“Ugh” he replied as Olive got up to collect his toiletries, “Thanos. What a terrible name. Everyone at school calls me Thanos The Anus.”
the bad guys!”
“I personally think he’s too old for you, Petey. Don’t be embarrassed! He should be ashamed, I mean, he was supposed to be the adult in this situation.” Muttered Deadpool sulkily.
“Please!” he begged as he held up the costume in one hand and matching mask in the other.
“Me.” Olive quickly spun around and found herself face-to-face with Bruce Banner, “They thought I was a good fit. Since the Other Guy’s didn’t exactly start off as a hero, and I guess now we are.” Bruce’s sarcastic finger quotes over the word “hero” was not lost on Olive; she knew what it was like to go from being publically loved, to being hated, to being loved again. It could drive anyone to suicidal ideation at best.
space. If anything, it makes you way more authentic than any of those other names.”
“There, there, Erik.” Soothed a gentle English voice, “I’m sure he meant no harm, and look, you got through the first step brilliantly. I’ll go next.”
... I think I have
“Should I even ask who else was required to be here?” Olive was beginning to vibe with Bruce’s underlying pessimism. At least there was someone here with an equal amount of resentment and attachment to their counterparts. Steve was just so pure that he practically sparkled at the mention of Sergeant Barnes.
“Today is less of a formal meeting, and more of a
Steve’s flinch at Thanos’ name was subtle, but she still noticed it. Olive has endured many reactions to Thanos’ name; often, it was an angry outburst. At times Olive wondered if Thanos ever noticed the ones who got by with a subtle flinch. She could tell that Steve was always conflicted when it came to them. During the trial, he had believed her to some extent, or, at least enough to advise the world to

“Ah, yes.” Steve awkwardly cleared his before motioning for her to follow him, “We were briefed on the project, and I’m really excited that it’s beginning. I’m glad to hear that the two of you will be joining us.”
“Can’t you just move it?”
“Stop it, Charles.” Hissed Erik gently twisting out of Charles grasp, “this is ridiculous.” Erik continued to mutter irritably under his breath as Charles playfully tried to shush him. Eventually, Erik sank back into his chair and fixed a glare to anyone still looking their way. Specifically, at Thanos, who has been unable to tear his eyes from Charles Xavier since the moment he rolled up.
“Well, that’s the name you had when I found you. So, that’s the name I went with.” Olive folded his clothes into a small suitcase, “I think it was important to acknowledge your roots.”

“They really didn’t tell you anything about it?” Steve took her annoyed expression as clear no, and continued, “It was Sam’s idea… kind of. He said therapy is the best way to deal with stuff, and group therapy could really help them.”
“What is this?”
On one hand, Olive was very relieved that Thanos
Olive bit back a laugh as she watched his dark-haired companion vibrating with anger. Thor had his younger brother gripped firmly by the back of his neck as pushed him towards the group. Much like Steve, Thor seemed more excited about this activity than his counterpart.
“Miss. Olive! Please come with us! He’s hurt!” Barton’s child urged Olive to follow him, “We didn’t know it was still on, and it just started shooting! He was trying to protect Morgan, and then they both fell in!”
“Like, how cool is it to be able to control people’s minds like that? He hears everything! He can see your whole life in a second; he doesn’t even need to touch them! Ugh, you could have named

“Alright, a
The question wasn’t fair, the set up wasn’t fair, and none of this seemed productive; for Olive’s situation, at least. Olive only raised her hand as an attempt to make this exercise go as quickly as possible. Thanos was not
“That’s a low blow, even for you.” Olive’s twin always had a penchant of throwing the past in her face, and she resented him for it. He was always a saint compared to her, and their parents always doted on him for being the “prophetic” child. Olive always thought everyone had romanticized his abilities, and he just kind of exploited their belief. How can you be considered the “bad” one when you already know what the other person thinks? You could just fine tune your answers to their expectations.

“It’s the least you can do!” thundered Thor as he held the elevator open with one hand and attempted to pull his brother out with the other. The smaller man had latched his hands on the frame with an iron grip, and refused to let go.
“Oh, um, I don’t exactly… Um..” This was mortifying, but not totally uncommon. Agent West usually did not disclose many details of the
Olive opened her eyes and everyone, except her, had both hands raised. This was not surprising to her; these are narcissistic people with deeply set hero complexes. It was always Olive’s opinion that all “heroes” probably needed some therapy. Or, at least, an intervention regarding minding their own business.

… a hero. You both define heroes and criminals differently. So, how about this…” Bruce turned to an encyclopedia resting on his desk, “Close your eyes, all of you, and I will read each definition. When the definition that you feel applies to your partner, then raise your hand.”
Olive hastily made her way down the hall, and hoped she could avoid any more run-ins as she fought against the frustrated tears threatening to fall. She didn’t feel necessarily attacked or, even, offended by her conversation with Bruce. Olive was used to S.H.I.E.L.D.’s nonsense, and she noticed the various binders and cue cards lying around the office. After Banner’s return to Earth he, like the Winter Soldier, had to go into hiding after Thanos’ disappearance. So, it seemed that Bruce was still doing “odd-jobs” to continue living in peace with society; it would be no fun to return to agent Romanov if he had to stay in hiding, she supposed. Olive was just tired of the same song and dance.
straight to the training center.” So much for a relaxing long weekend at the cabin. All Olive wanted as for Thanos to have a few non-traumatic experiences in his lifetime. That was one of the main points that were made in the court cases; that if rehabilitated, then he could integrate into society.
Olive was dreading the phone call, but she expected it nonetheless. Leaving town was something she needed permission to do, and she knew that. Olive use to get away without placing formal requests, but it seemed that Agent West wasn’t very forgiving
was never told what this was.” Olive felt bad snapping at Bruce, because it wasn’t his fault she was trapped in this hellhole.
“Thank you, Mr. Rogers. I’m here by request of Agent West, and Thanos is here to speak to his uncle.”
“Ah, Lady Olive. How good to see you again!” Exclaimed Thor as he flung his brother forward, “We are glad to see you and your

“What do you mean by
Olive couldn’t bring herself to make eye contact with the brothers as she stiffly tiptoed past them. She desperately pressed the elevator’s buttons, and hoped the awkward conversation would not continue; it was no secret that she had no love for New Asgard or their kings. Part of Thor’s diplomatic approach to having his people assimilate with Earth was to provide S.H.I.E.L.D. with a space to conduct any “re-education” of wayward heroes. Unfortunately, it was during this time that she had returned to Earth and was transported New Asgard’s newly installed S.H.I.E.L.D. “embassy”. During the next few months she was restrained both chemically and physically, forced to watch hundreds of hours’ worth of “good Samaritan” training, and questioned using what would now be called “problematic” tactics.
“Don’t start with that, Olive. Why am I just now finding out,
of all people should know that better than anyone.”
“No, I can’t… not anymore.” And probably never again.
“Really?”
“Oh lovely.” Muttered Olive throwing the car in park, “It looks like we go on foot from here, kid.”
Bruce finally signaled for them to lower their arms and it seemed that the boys were ready for reconciliation. Both were finished crying and Steve took the lead apologizing. After all, he was much older than the young man he spent the afternoon arguing with.
“Solution?” echoed Olive uncertainly.
They’ve had the same conversation every morning for the past three years. He didn’t want to go to school because they treat him differently. To be fair, he was very different from them; physically speaking at least. He looked like a square-headed roided-out baby, with a heavily wrinkled chin. His personality was not fairly represented by his physique. He was a sweet kid; even if he was kind of a crybaby.
“Olive, what if I told you that Thanos knew exactly why he’s here; without even needing to be told. He knew that he is here to support you, and to help you.” Bruce held his hand up at Olive’s indignant scoff, “Spend some time tonight thinking about why you’re here.”
your heart breaking, they could just sit there politely smiling.
“Brother, please, Banner is awaiting our arrival!” exclaimed Thor in frustration, “After tomorrow we can leave and we’ll be back in a week’s time! Is that so much to ask?”
“Oh! Oh!” At this point, Olive wasn’t even surprised by her rotten luck. She hasn’t caught a break since she was sixteen years old. In fact, she has long accepted that the worse possible would always be the outcome when Thanos was involved.
move it? Olive bit back a bitter laugh as she flung her seat-belt off. She hadn’t been able to do any such thing for a few years now, and it was thanks to their reintroduction to Earth. After Thanos’ case, she was forced to use the Mutant Cure as a condition of being able to care for him. It was the most unpleasant part of her week, and with each injection her empathy for humanity fades away.
“How about” began Olive as she broke the embrace, “we play hooky today, and Monday? We can have a four-day weekend, go out to the cabin, and see if we can maybe visit your uncle?”
“I didn’t make it all. Bucky did most the work… we

“Please talk to him, Sage.” Olive quickly gathered her brother’s hands with her own, “Please. I think it’s been a disappointing few years from him, and he’s dead-set on returning to space. I’m just scared… I’m scared we’re funneling him right back on that same path, and no one wants to listen to me.”
Ah, Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes. The main reason Steve had been even somewhat amicable towards the idea of Thanos’ rehabilitation during the trial, was to eventually bridge that grace to him. Even after she was transported with the original Thanos, the Winter Solider was still at large and placed back into hiding. After they had won the case, it opened the gate for many other past “supervillains” to be reintroduced into society. Olive found it fascinating how many groups who had advocated

Both froze as she awkwardly approached the only exit available. Thor’s scowl melted into a puppy-dog smile, and Loki’s sneer seemed to intensify; both reactions filled her with dread.

that you’re running… What-what is it about exactly?”
“Actually, that wasn’t for you. I think I can be a little more transparent with you, and I’d like to believe that you and I are similar.” Bruce gently guided Olive back to her chair and took a seat across from her. “Why do you think they wanted you to see me after group?”
“Ok.” Bruce attempted to regain control of the room, “Let’s go ahead and, uh, have another volunteer.”
“Those are some of the only kids here.” Chided Sage as he noted the time on this watch, “And, aren’t you supposed to be in a meeting now?”
“Yeah, it’s been pretty rough at work too. They can handle it without me for a few days.”

has to say.”
Sage. Or Basil! Or Oregano!”
Somehow America’s sweetheart and the rookie got into it during their first session. It all boiled down to what their definition of a criminal was; which seemed to become the focus of the session. Is someone who had been fully aware of their crimes, but changed their ways still count as a hero? Were they an anti-hero? Does it only count if they were unaware of their crimes? From then, it boiled down to was it considered a crime by our terms as a society? What if the crime if the act was committed while protecting a “less desirable” population that were facing hate crimes?
“Alright. I think this is some progress. Um, think about this moment when you guys are arguing. You both feel that your partner is a hero in their own right, but they have had, what society deems to be, a criminal past.” Bruce lowered his arms and pocketed his hands, “I think we’re all on the same team here. We’re a little strung out and this

enough for them; so much for the tolerance they always preached about with pro-mutant lobbying. Apparently being different was only okay if you weren’t
“Yeah.” Olive’s twin was Thanos’ second favorite hero, much to Olive’s annoyance. Again, the irony was not lost on her about his preferences. In truth, the original Thanos was not fond of her brother, and by the end of the altercation he probably hated him. Sage was half of the reason that Thanos was in this situation to begin with, and the reason she was in this whole mess.
“Alright, be careful, and don’t do anything dangerous, ok?” Olive called after him, as he disappeared from the room with his backpack in one hand and their overweight cat tucked under his arm.
“Hmm…” hummed Olive unsure.
“When…um… wh-…” Olive watched sympathetically as Steve hung his head to hide his tears, “He was compared to the others… Bucky is a hero, and he was taken… Hydra made him like… this…”
“My name is
Thanos had their own black sheep in hiding.

Olive reluctantly closed her eyes after receiving a stern look from Dr. Banner. Somehow she had been sucked right into the Avenger drama; this shit wasn’t even applicable to her situation. All Olive ever wanted was specialized help Thanos, like, someone to help him with basic coping mechanisms. Why was it impossible to get a child psychologist on board?
“Dr. Banner.” Greeted Olive as she entered his area, “It’s always a pleasure.”
“You know exactly why. So, stop dragging your feet.”
“Does a
“Wait, hold on,
Olive noted that he sounded more sensitive than usual today. She could imagine his cheeks flushing with anger, or that little vein that always popped up on his forehead. Ever since Agent Coulson went strictly on “Avengers duty” she has been stuck with Paranoia Agent. He constantly thinks they have some sort of doomsday device; like even at the grocery store. He didn’t tolerate any “misbehavior” from the kid. Especially if she let Thanos stay home instead of going to school. Agent West was a firm believer that if Thanos is unable to assimilate to society, then he would eventually become dangerous. “I’m just taking Thanos to see his uncle. Things have been hard at school, and I think he would do well with receiving some counsel from him.”
Olive rolled her eyes at the suggestion. His real name wasn’t even Star Lord; it was Peter Quill. Which, in her opinion, was a very, very boring name. She had met him a handful of times, and each time the meeting was more hostile than the last. The last time she saw him was while visiting her brother, and he basically screamed in her face with his hands around her neck. Peter Quill was the last person this child should be idolizing, and she hoped he never had to learn that first-hand.
Charles Xavier pushed his wheelchair forward to assert his turn and smiled pleasantly to the other members. That was the same polite smile Olive remembered when he reiterated that Thanos would not be appropriate for his school, and that it was his
“Get off!” growled Spiderman as he hopped out of his chair to avoid his friends’ advances, “Sorry, Mr. Banner. W-we can go next!”
“Shut up, dude!” Spiderman spun to Bruce desperately rambling, “I am so sorry, Mr. Banner. He does not mean that, um, I think maybe it’s just… nerves? He’s
Fortunately, they were interviewing a well-known advice columnist that day, so he doubted research would be overly difficult. Take a look at her master’s thesis, read a few of her more popular columns, maybe check out her bio and he could probably call it good. He knew she tended to fall more on the romantic side of the spectrum, so Tony would take the lead with her interview. Steve was just there to argue a little bit.
across the space where it should have had the month. “Wow, you weren’t kidding. Wonder what happened.”
Steve chuckled. “I maybe wouldn’t go that far. But you’re right, it was much better than I was expecting. I’m glad Dottie got over her dislike enough to give them the award.”
He was used now to the stretch of the cock inside him, and he wanted to move just as badly as Tony wanted him to, so he rose up and dropped himself back down, moaning in unison with Tony. He set a fast pace, fast and hard. It wasn’t Tony’s preferred pace; he usually liked to take things slower, drag them out until Steve was begging for him (once, Steve had liked that too, but he couldn’t let himself have those anymore, couldn’t let himself get used to that), but Tony wasn’t in charge today. Steve was, and today he wanted it hard.
“I’m not here to shop.” He holds up the license in its frame. “I’m Steve. I just came by to drop off Tony’s business license.”
“—and I’m Mr. Right Now,” Steve finished.
Ana gives her a knowing look, clearly guessing that she doesn’t want to take this away from her. Maria smiles guilelessly at her. Is she using this as an opportunity to help a woman who couldn’t have a child of her own? Absolutely. Is she going to admit it? Not even a little bit. She knows how proud Ana and Edwin can be, and how rarely they admit that they’re truly closer to members of the family than the hired help. But this is something that she can do for Ana, and she refuses to back down from that.
Tony: I didn’t say she—
“Okay, yeah, you’re right.”
Steve: Seriously, kid, you need to get out of this relationship now.

When he still didn’t get an answer, he sighed heavily and stomped to the garage, throwing the door open as he shouted, “
“I’d say so,” Steve agrees. Then, because he never can resist needling Tony, “I’d like to point out though that we’d be a lot richer if we hadn’t gone with the friends and family discount.”
“You will,” Sam says confidently. “You’ll figure something out. Might just take a while. I’m pretty angry about this.”
. I’m so offended. I want a divorce.”
Tony glares at her. “
“Great! I need your muscley goodness down here like yesterday.”
“Put those chairs over there,” Dottie ordered.
Steve blinked. “Yeah, I’m not sure what’s going on here.”
Sam glances at Bucky, a look of understanding passing between them.
Tony gives him one of his Looks. “Steve,” he says patiently. “There’s only one were in the whole county, no we’re not going to sell it. It’s the full moon tonight. Thought it might be nice if Nat had something to help the transformation.”
Tony was still asleep when Steve slipped out of bed. He gathered up his clothes and dressed as quietly as possible, not wanting to wake Tony. After five years of their game, he was more than practiced at moving around Tony’s room in the dark, and he avoided the furniture with ease. Still, he knew what a light sleeper Tony was. There was always about a fifty-fifty chance between Tony staying asleep while Steve dressed or—
“Thanks,” he said, jumping out almost before the car had pulled to a stop. “I owe you one.”
“I wanted you to hear this from me before someone like Rumlow or Sitwell told you,” Tony said eventually. His throat visibly worked for a second. “There’s a rumor going around the station that we’re going to be taken off the air.”
Morgan perks up immediately at the promise of a bedtime story. Tony doesn’t tell a lot of stories in this house, though he knows plenty. That’s always been Steve’s job, since Morgan always wants Tony to sing her lullabies instead. But he does know them, and he’s found that they work as pretty decent incentive to get Morgan into bed when she doesn’t want to go.
“No, I do,” T’Challa corrects, “but he’s angry and angry men can make mistakes.”
“Wanda and Vision have a visitor.”
“What?” he asks innocently. “I thought you might like to cool off.”
Across from him, Steve reaches out to pat U as well. He does so gently, but even gentle for Steve Rogers is harder than the average person and a little piece of U crumbles under his touch. Tony fights back a wince, knowing how Steve would take it. As it is, Steve’s face crumples, and he snatches his hand back as though burned.
“We can’t give our customers food poisoning, Steve!”
That gets a small twitch of a smile out of Tony so he counts it as a win.
,” she says, “you fake needing to go to the bathroom and while you are gone, I will come up with something to get me out of here. Then you will have Tony all to yourself and you are going to woo him because so help me, I cannot listen to that man pining over your ass a moment longer.”
He glances at Sam, who shrugs as well and puts his fork down. “Wanted to ask what was still holding me up on the Accords.”
Bucky smiles at him. “As though you could make me do anything. Look, I’ll sign if you guys decide to—the king and I have been discussing it anyway—but it’s not like anyone can touch me if I decide not to.”
“It’s the receipt from our first sale,” Steve says softly.
“Good night, Steve,” Tony interrupted. “I’ll see you at work.” He turned off the lamp and laid back down on his side, facing away from Steve.
And if those aren’t enough to remind him to stay his tongue, then the thought of what will happen to Tony if he and Ana leave is more than enough.
. She doesn’t think she can hear another one of those, not without doing something drastic, so she quickly adds, “I’ll even tell you a bedtime story, hmm? How does that sound?”
college experience had gone).
“I shouldn’t care,” Tony says angrily, dashing away the little tears in his eyes. “It’s not like Howard ever cares what I think so why should I care that he brought my ex here who’s going to make him look like an idiot?”
“No,” Steve repeated. “Really, it’s fine. I’m pretty sure Ophelia lives near here anyway. I’m sure she’ll come pick me up.”
Disillusioned with love, Steve moved on—sort of. He never dated again, but he wasn’t lacking in partners. Steve knew how he looked and the fact that he was kind and respected everyone he slept with was an attractive quality. He spent his nights hopping from bed to bed, telling himself that it was better that way. No one could hurt him if he didn’t stay long enough to care about any of them.
They never did go back to cleaning. What they had seen had rattled them too much. Nothing like that ever happened in Westview, and to have watched it happen in front of them had felt like a rude awakening from their idyllic suburban life. Steve didn’t even understand it. Had this always been happening right under their noses? Had they missed other cues?
“Then you don’t get to tell me how it tastes.”
“No, there isn’t. But that isn’t the only Stone on Earth. Dr. Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, claims he’s the steward of another one. And Thor and Bruce are bringing the Tesseract back here, so that’s three all on Earth.”
Steve: So now he should be a mind reader?
all pass?”
And yet…
“Trust me, Steve. I get it. I’m as shocked as you are.”
Tony isn’t alone in the store when Steve gets there. Dummy is draped over the counter, grey tail twitching lazily, and there’s a petite redhead lifting glass horses out of a box and putting them on one of the shelves. Considering that Tony only ever talks about three people in this town, Rhodey, the vet Janet is working for, and his friend, Steve would be willing to bet that this is the friend.
For TSB Square K5: Nose Kiss
“Thought we might like to start with seeing what’s underneath those clothes of yours,” Steve shoots back, grinning as Tony’s fingers immediately fly to the buttons. Tony doesn’t bother with trying to make it sexy, though anything he does is sexy in Steve’s eyes. After fifteen years together, they’ve both learned the things they didn’t know about sex when they were young and convinced that all sex had to be either the most meaningful experience ever or hotter than a porn studio, like the value of laughing during sex and that sometimes, sex can be more fun when they just get to the point instead of drawing it out.

It’s almost a relief to have that choice taken from him when Shuri tells him Bucky isn’t sure he’s ready for visitors just yet. “He’s settling down on one of our farms near the border,” she tells him. “He keeps a small herd of goats. He named the littlest one Steve, if you can believe it.”
He inhaled shakily. How was Tony so calm about this? How could he bring up the best memory of Steve’s life like he hadn’t callously broken his heart three years later? How could he
Oh. Steve’s very big on this whole clothes thing, which Tony doesn’t understand. He’s a nature spirit, it’s not like he’s human, why should clothes matter?
“What about Xavier?” Steve suddenly suggests.
Rhodey was young when he graduated high school, young when he went off to college, but Tony is younger still. The college paired them together in a dorm room because who else could they pair them with? Rhodey was younger than the next-youngest student by a year and Tony, with his big eyes and fluffy hair, was younger by three. They’d fought terribly those first few weeks, Rhodey headstrong and bitter that ROTC wouldn’t accept him for another two years and Tony angry that his request for a single dorm room had been denied. But then Rhodey had woken in the middle of the night to Tony sniffling over the fact that his fuckup of a father hadn’t even bothered to tell him goodbye before sending him off to college. Then Tony had come home to Rhodey slamming his head against the wall because his statistics professor was assigning him impossible questions on purpose (“Shouldn’t MIT’s wunderkind know how to do this already?” she laughed meanly).
He watched as Tony’s face closed off as soon as he mentioned one of his other—well, he hated the term
Tony: So they’re spreading rumors about your relationship.
He goes to the café for lunch—most of the food may be questionable but he actually kind of enjoys the tuna melt—with Tony still on his mind. It’s just that, he doesn’t really think Tony is as disorganized as he’d seemed during their meeting. He’d noticed from the beginning that Tony was hiding his nervousness under that haughty demeanor and he’s sure that he might have fumbled too if he’d been put on the spot like that.
Steve sighed. Tony sighed. The doorbell rang for a second time.
“No, not at all!” the man exclaimed. “Just glad to have a normal job in this normal town. Me, a normal person—I’m glad to have the job.”
And then he’d come back early one night from class to find Howard Stark in their room, screaming at his son about his inability to get rid of his roommate and his supposedly less-than-impressive grades (Steve shared two gen ed classes with Tony; he had nothing to be ashamed of) and the embarrassment he was apparently causing the family. Steve knew a little something about shitty fathers and the moment he’d seen the sheen of held-back tears in Tony’s eyes, he saw red.
“I wouldn’t know,” Steve admitted. “I’ve never been fired before.”
Tony Stark dropped into the seat next to him and offered up a tentative smile. “Hi, Steve.”
And sure enough, when Luis calls his name and Steve comes around the corner to get his first glimpse of Tony Stark, the first thought he has is,
“That’s why we have superheroes themselves sitting on the committees. We’re not voiceless anymore. Superhero registration is in the hands of a mutant who would never let that information fall into the wrong hands,
Tony droops as he watches them go. He thought it was a very nice courting gift, but maybe there was something wrong with it? Maybe it wasn’t sparkly enough? Maybe Steve doesn’t like rocks?
To her surprise, Tony’s piercing wails cut off right before she reaches his room. Perhaps irrationally, Maria picks up the pace, fearing the worst. Her Tony, her bright boy, cries so often—to be so suddenly quiet must mean that something is
That night was no different. They passed several hours at the restaurant, closing them down. Steve made sure to leave a large tip for their waiter for putting up with Sam’s drunken ramblings and Bucky’s drunken affections, then followed his friends outside where Sam was still complaining about the lack of crawfish offerings the restaurant offered.
Tony’s a pretty talented guy, but even he can’t figure out a way to meet all of those Steves by the end of his lifetime. It’d take him much longer than the average human lifespan. Fortunately, he knows he can narrow it down a bit. According to his Aunt Peggy and Uncle Grant, who were there when his name showed up, Tony was only a few weeks old when he met his soulmate, which means he can cross off anyone who’s younger than him. Steve’s name wouldn’t have appeared on his wrist if he hadn’t already met him.
“That’s kind of close to—”
“Hmm,” he hummed, stretching his legs out. “You’re too far away, sweetheart.”
“Look, Steve, I’m just worried about you,” Bucky said quietly, taking care not to disturb Sam, who was napping against the cab window on their way to the airport. “I know you think you’ve got this under control, but the very fact that you didn’t mention this for three years proves you don’t.”
He laughs and rubs his thumbs over Tony’s hands. “We won’t, don’t worry. Rhodey promised me he’d make sure everything was fresh.”
“No, he’s not a Commie,” Tony said. “He said he wasn’t Russian. His wife is Sokovian though. One of those small Eastern European countries, he said.”
Only this time, Steve wanted him to stay. He wanted Tony to fight for them, the way he hadn’t when they broke up after college. Inexplicable and unexplainable as it was, he wanted Tony to fight back to keep their show. He wanted him to take all that passion from their nights together and channel that into fighting back against Pierce.
Tony bring up that night? How dare he taint it like this? They were drawing attention, people poking their heads out of their offices to hear what Tony and Steve were arguing about. “You can’t just—” He couldn’t do this here. He was going to lose it. He was going to break down in a way that he hadn’t since the night Tony had left and he
“What? Why would you think something’s wrong?” Steve asks defensively. “Don’t jinx us.”
It was up to their patio.
“A minion,” Tony says promptly. Steve laughs, making Tony smile a little. “Thanks, Steve. I just—I wanted to talk about this with someone who understood.”
“It’s fine,” Natasha says, shaking the hand he offers. Her grip is surprisingly strong for someone so tiny. “What would you have gotten me if you’d known I was coming?”
“Sir, yes, sir!”
“Should I get a broom?”
Steve grins, shakes his head, and reaches for a pen.
“But not now?” he asks, curious about this.
“Agnes said she doesn’t have a home here.”
Steve kisses the top of his head. “And she loved him.”
“We have the talent show this afternoon.”
Sure enough, Tony huffs out a laugh, even though he mutters, “Since Howard decided to start in on all this bullshit.”
“Right,” Steve said weakly, still caught on Tony’s suggestion. Tony gave him a little wave and left, closing the door behind him. Steve slumped back in his chair, mind reeling.
He hasn’t known Tony very long, but he knows enough to know that Tony frequently bites off more than he can chew and refuses to admit it until he absolutely has to. He’s gotten a couple texts like these and gone in anyway just in case, only to find out that Tony definitely needed help but hadn’t wanted to bother him to ask.
“What are you doing?” Tony asks confusedly as he puts the car in park. “Oh gods, this is when you murder me, isn’t it? I knew I should have listened to Nat when she said you’re secretly an axe murderer.”
mostly because it was a romantic advice show run by men, whereas the organization viewed that as the rightful purview of women. More recently though, they’d run a denouncement campaign because one of the show’s fans had uncovered that neither Tony nor Steve were straight. Pierce had just laughed it off when he’d first found out Focus on the Family were threatening to boycott them, but with money thrown into the equation, things might be different now.
Still, he gives himself another couple of seconds before he pulls away and puts the car in drive again. Tony clears his throat but then doesn’t follow it up with anything, so Steve glances over at him. Tony has turned to the window again so Steve can’t really see his face, but it looks like he’s smiling.
“You—what?” he asks.
Well, that’s good at least. He knows how much Tony hates doctors. The rest of the team thinks it’s because of everything that happened in Afghanistan, and Tony lets them think that, but he told Steve once that it’s really because none of them ever did anything when he was a kid and Maria would take him to the hospital after one of Howard’s “lessons.” Steve tries to keep him out of Medical as often as possible—even got EMT training so he could patch up as many of Tony’s injuries as he could—but sometimes, like now, it’s unavoidable.
“No, that’s on me,” Steve hurried to assure him. “I should have said what I meant, been clearer.”
“So I’ve been told.” He pulls one of his business cards out of the little container next to his computer and holds it out for Tony to take. “Here’s my card, I have a feeling you’re going to need it.”
Carol was kidnapped and brainwashed by an alien race called the Kree. They had this huge empire and when Carol found out about it, she said she was going to take them down. She’s been doing that ever since, helped broker a treaty between the Kree and another race called the Xandarians, and then she came across Thanos. Tracked him right to the Asgardian refugee ship headed for Earth and—”
“Oh sure,” Steve sneered. “I’m sure you were so heartbroken over that new job you refused my proposal over.”
He knows very well it’s a catch-22. If he says they haven’t, then Tony will feel worse and—knowing Tony—probably think it’s something that he did. But if he says that they have, then he’ll be lying and Tony will know that he’s lying because Tony always seems to know when he’s lying.
Dummy jumped up into his lap, mewing softly. Steve started petting her, making Dummy purr and purr and purr.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve says fondly, kissing him again. “My little high-maintenance husband.”
They breathe together for a while, taking comfort in the fact that they’re both there together. Eventually Tony says, “So you do like your birthday present then?”
“I know you would have,” Tony says gently, reaching across the table to squeeze Steve’s hand. “You said you thought Zola was lying. I believe that.”
He nods. “That’s fair.”
Thanks for sticking with this incredibly niche story that literally only one person asked for! I've loved all your comments so much <3 I'm going to be taking about a two month break from this story to work on a few other fics, but I'll be back in late October/early November to fix everything I broke at the end of this fic
He wants to ask, push, know what it is that Tony was going to ask, but he’s certain that Tony will shut down on him if he tries to do that. So he just nods, though he knows Tony can’t see that, and says, “Be careful.”
Steve has his suspicions about just who this visitor is, only to be confirmed when they enter the throne room and he spots Tony quietly talking with the Queen Mother. “Tony,” he exhales, not sure if he’s relieved or worried. It’s great to see Tony again, but it can’t be good news that brought them to Wakanda at the same time, and T’Challa
“No!” Morgan protests, giggling. “That’s not a story!”
Steve gives him a fond smile, says, “I know. How’s Rhodey?”
. That wasn’t particularly historically accurate either.”
He didn’t know how much money he’d given the Uber driver, probably more than he should have, but he could barely see the bills through the tears threatening to overspill, so he’d just thrown a wad of cash at him and escaped into his apartment.
Tony shoots him a dark glare. “I don’t buy that innocent act for one second and you know it.”
Steve hesitates. “You already asked me that.”
He gave a forlorn look to the empty spot on his coaster next to his computer where his coffee normally sat. He just didn’t get it.
my butt.”
Without thinking about it, Steve throws an arm around Tony’s shoulder, pulling him in to lean against him. “You’re brilliant,” he says honestly.
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony mumbles. “He’s sending me away anyway.”
“Really,” she states. “Do I look that boring?”
“Oh no, I don’t eat food,” Vision said. Steve turned and gave him a funny look. That didn’t make any sense. Vision caught his look and chuckled nervously. “I’m kidding, of course! I eat food, just like any other regular human.”

That was all the encouragement Tony needed after holding back for so long and his orgasm exploded out him along with a frantic shout as his hands came up to clutch at Steve. Steve continued to stroke him through his orgasm and leaned forward to kiss him deep and passionate, drinking in the sound of his cries. He pulled Tony up into his arms and continued to stroke and soothe him through the aftershocks until Tony stilled once more into a loose puddle of bliss in his arms. Steve kissed his temple and crooned wordlessly into his hair for a few minutes more, loving the soft, pliant weight of Tony molded against him, before picking him up and leaving the workshop behind.
"That's it? Just Bucky? No argument to convince me?"
Tony let out another small whimper and Steve brought his hand up to cover Tony's mouth in response.
“I’m not sure where he went, but I promise he’s coming back soon. Now, what’s the best thing for me to do? Do ya need something I can getcha?” Tony shifted uncomfortably and shrugged as he looked away from Bucky. It seemed clear that there
Comforted by Bucky’s soft words and the hand that continued to pet him, Tony rolled onto his side facing Bucky. He was starting to come back to himself enough to recognize what was happening. “S-subdrop. When it’s really good or intense- and it was tonight- when you come down from it, when it’s over, it makes you feel like shit. Steve- he’s coming back right? He didn’t really leave me?”
“Tony, can you focus for a minute? I need you to pay attention.” He spoke gently, but firmly and was relieved when Tony shifted his gaze slightly to look straight at Steve. “I have to go out for just a little bit. Sam texted; he has an emergency-” He would have continued to explain and promise his quick return, but Tony cut him off.
won’t repeat?."
“Buck-”  Steve’s voice was shook as he spoke, to try to explain himself, but Bucky cut him off.
Bucky cursed loudly when he walked into the kitchen and found Tony curled up on himself with tears still streaming down his face. He regretted it immediately when Tony flinched at the sound, and looked up at him with red-rimmed eyes only to drop his gaze again once he recognized who it was. He shrank in even smaller on himself and hid his face in his arms.
So this was a little shorter than I intended it to be, but when it feels right, what can you do?
he knew about Tony Stark.
Bucky looked like he wanted to argue again, but in the end he just accepted the thanks.

Bucky didn’t respond, he just returned to his bedroom and carefully laid down beside Tony once more, pulling the smaller man back to rest against his side while he slept. Tony quieted again, and Bucky felt the tension drain from his own body as well.
Tony hesitated, but eventually nodded and then shyly turned his face into the pillow. Bucky was again surprised by his actions. In the time he'd known the man, he had
“Friday, where is Steve?”
“No, Stevie, he
Steve quickly pulled on his own clothing then grabbed his phone and headed for the door. He stopped for one last look back at his lover. Tony’s eyes were closed and his face looked peaceful and relaxed. Steve hated leaving, and a part of him knew that he shouldn’t, but Sam was relying on him, and Tony had said he was fine. He flipped off the lights and left the room. The faster this crisis was dealt with, the sooner he’d be back in bed with Tony where he belonged.
