And, as Tony thought about it, as he tried to catalogue all the things that had been
And, before he could do anything with it, the Red Skull had caught his eye - and smiled.
“Ouch,” Tony agreed, with a sympathetic smile. “Fair enough, something like that warrants a clear escape plan.”
“Steve…” fell over his lips, his voice dazed and distant. And then he felt the bed shift beneath him, opening his eyes to see Steve looking over him…
Heart pounding in his ears, Tony finally lifted his head so that he could take a proper look at his surroundings - only to find that they were already approaching the marble steps of another building on the other side of the courtyard.
And…laying it all out like this, the difference suddenly seemed entirely obvious-
“Okay, we

That was what he’d decided before this strange emotional interlude – that was what his rational brain had thought best, and it was always best to go with that…

Steve broke the kiss with a gasp, pulling his legs out of the water and turning to kneel on the edge of the pool, all with Captain America speed and efficiency. Tony’s eyes barely had time to widen, before Steve had grabbed him by the hips and bodily lifted him into the same position, pulling him hard against his chest-
“Okay, um,
“So…I got your letter, and…” Steve struggled, and then sighed, “to be honest, it made me want to apologise for mine.”

He’d had no idea that they’d even really had a relationship, in Tony’s mind. He’d thought it was all in
“Yeah, we’re good,” Steve grinned, glancing over Sam’s head to shoot Bucky a look that only they would understand. Sam didn’t see it – he was too busy noticing the pool of blood that Tony was lying in.
“Comes and goes,” Bucky shrugged. “Has been all day. S’not really gotten any better, or worse, or anything.”
And then Steve leant into him, his hips pressed hard against him, dragging a long, slow friction against Tony’s groin-
But the fact that Tony was his
A giggle bubbled over Steve’s lips, completely unexpectedly.

But Tony just smiled, kind and understanding and patient. And then he shifted his weight so that he could lie on the bed right next to Steve, and gently roll him so that he was lying against Tony’s chest – another sob breaking out of him as he buried his head into Tony’ neck.
As long as he would always
“Well, all the guests are being sent to the compound first.” Rhodey explained, wearily “We’re calling it a welfare liaison or something. Basically, so we can reassure the innocent and maybe pick up if any of them are culpable, et cetera, you know.”
But he was still glad that Tony had said that.
So, with no other options to grab for, he took a steadying breath - exactly as he might’ve done before he went into battle - and stepped over the threshold into his own house.
This hadn’t even been on his list of regrets, before tonight… But it seemed quite obvious now. He could apologise for

Steve smiled.
The objective lines and numbers and patterns that represented everything he and Steve had spent so long working towards, everything they’d both wanted so much-
He took Steve’s hand… deliberately squeezing just a bit too hard. He saw that exact thrill flash up in Steve’s eyes – exactly as he knew it would. And then he tugged at Steve’s arm.
Which didn’t help at all.
Because Tony – naïve and foolish little cherub that he was – had been braced for an alien lab full of inhumane experiments. An army of brainwashed people, being prepped for warfare. A huge slug, awaiting its next human sacrifice. You know, something simple.
Or, even more amazingly, he’d forgotten that there weren’t

The most confusing thing about it was the sudden sense of clarity. The way everything just seemed to make sense, when Steve was actually there.

And then he felt Tony shift, and move so that he was kneeling beside him on the bed now. Steve could feel Tony looking down at him, before he’d managed to tear his eyes away from the chain.

“Sir? Ms Potts to see you.” JARVIS told him, interrupting another aimless daydream. Tony blinked… and smiled.
Of course, it couldn’t last. No sooner had Tony caught his breath than the frantic jumble of thoughts started up again, drawing all the tension back into his shoulders-
He’d been so reckless and irresponsible and
took another second for one of them to come to his senses and fire a shot – a tiny little dart, lodged into Tony’s shoulder.
Tony wasn’t sure whether he wanted to argue with that. On the one hand, it was patronising and presumptuous, and part of Tony would’ve liked say,
“Well, yeah, we’re both pretty famous.” Tony deadpanned.

all of that is so much more complicated than I’ve just made it sound. I know that there are going to be arguments about what counts as dictating policy and who gets to say who’s the bad guy… I ran away from all that, before. I said I wasn’t going to support a bad attempt at managing world security - and then didn’t offer anything instead. Because I didn’t have something simple and inarguable to put forward - but I had something better. Even then. Something I was always afraid to make a case for, something that I was always scared wouldn’t be perfect…”
“Is he okay?” Dev asked, gently. And Tony realised he had far too much to juggle, having to play-act in front of Dev and still trying not to have a breakdown over his earlier breakdown… he just didn’t have space left to wonder about that too.
For one white hot second, Tony was so flooded by pure, physical rage that it was literally all he was. There was such a raw, spiteful urge to

But, until then, Steve had to accept that they were outgunned. That they didn’t know enough about ‘Talleroy Communications’ capabilities, or their plans. That it was probably better to wait as long as possible for reinforcements to arrive
That Tony would still have to drink – and it would certainly hurt
An unbearable wave of agonised guilt, crashing into him as a solid mass, knocking the air out of his lungs-
Tony would’ve felt bad for it now, if he didn’t have more pressing things to feel bad about.

...And they didn’t even win, the first time.
“Wouldn’t that technically make you the arcade game?” Tony observed, his voice still hoarse and breathy.

And then Steve’s eyes caught on the tiniest flash out of the corner of his eye, barely recognising that he’d seen it before he turned to look.

He remembered Steve’s voice… Steve talking, almost like he was speaking in Tony’s head…

And then, at last, there was the sound of Steve’s key scraping the lock.

He glanced longingly at the bedroom door. He thought back to Tony, sleeping peacefully in his bed, looking like a sketch from a gothic fairy tale. He remembered the two of them lying on the floor of a soft room… how he’d pulled one of the silk sheets down from the benches and wrapped Tony in it, and held him like that, close to his chest…

“What is all this?” Nick demanded eventually, gesturing sharply with the papers.
“Tony, some of these are locked,” he called out. He could hear the gentle murmur of Tony still reassuring Bucky, cut short with an impatient sigh.
“The people who came from earth. We call them Adams – the people who run this place, not just earth people in general. Not that anyone here likes earth people in general very much anymore – but it’s the Adams we really hate. They’re the people we blame.”

Tony’s expression shattered into that same honest heartbreak that Steve had seen in the bunker in Siberia - but even more beautiful on this innocent, unscarred face-
At that point, sex has fallen outside the sphere of relevance. It was quite obvious that this moment wasn’t about that – not least because, for both of them, their bodies were catching up with all the physical limitations that the drugs had allowed them to forget.

“No,” Tony answered immediately.
“Yeah, okay, you’ve made your point. Please turn it off.”
He wanted to talk about this, and he didn’t want to talk about this.
“Okay,

As such, I'll be returning to the Monday update for chapter 18 and thereafter (unless I actually get a lot of writing done on my holiday, in which case you'll actually get more updates 😀) But, just for clarification, the next chapter will be being posted on or before the 29th of September
And then a memory flickered at the corners of Tony’s lips, an almost smile. And, in a wiser, more distanced tone, he added.
God, he’d missed feeling like this.
“Honestly? I guess I didn’t expect Captain America to have
The thought was not as frustrating as Steve was expecting.

“Well, of course they are, I was directly involved” he responded with a jovility that he no longer felt. “Which brings me to my next question - how does it feel to be a genius?”
he felt, never being able to find words for the ever changing chaos in his head… right now, Steve could say that he was quite simply and overwhelmingly excited for his date.
He felt himself sitting upright, like he was being pulled towards Tony…
“There’s nothing wrong with assholes,” Steve finished, tetchily.
That, somewhere in the middle of Steve’s blissed out haze, Tony had finished undressing.

“I’ll report back from the meeting, and I’ll give you a call when I’m back to New York.”

worried about that.
actually going to jump.
His daytime thoughts were already slipping away from him, a new normal coming into form, making the real world seem strange and distant… But Steve could still remember himself enough to appreciate the novelty of this. The total security and exhilarating abandon that came with surrendering like this.
“It’s okay Steve, we’re good,” Bucky reassured him, as he knelt to untie the ropes around Steve’s wrists. Steve pulled his arms free and flexed his shoulders – but stayed seated for a second.
The strangest sort of focus had gripped Tony, in the moments afterwards. He’d been so overwhelmed by elation and adrenaline, and the world had seemed so vivid and magical and

“The thing is… I’m not going to tell you we’re the same in any way,” Bucky said. “I mean, how the hell do I know if that’s true, right? I feel like it sometimes – I should probably tell you that. Even before last night, sometimes I’d feel like maybe you got it somehow. But who am I to guess why that might be…”
“… I know that would be better.” Tony answered, very carefully.
Had he wildly misinterpreted what Tony had said to him, before?
…That was significant.
Steve was desperate to fill that gap, desperate to explain himself or make his case again or, just –
He couldn’t feel it, anymore.

to say. That was what Steve was waiting for. It felt like that was what the whole world was waiting for.
That, even though he was sure there were things they had to talk about while sober, and things they’d have to work on when they got home, maybe Tony had really meant it when he said-
“Yeah, I probably should…” Steve agreed – already knowing there was literally no chance of that. Actually, he was just trying to get out of this phone call before he blew it. “But, I’ll call you, okay?”
to… Although, who knew whether Steve would stay there anyway. Maybe he had his own long-term plans to be getting on with. Maybe he didn’t trust Tony enough to take him up on that offer. Maybe he’d sensed the distress of a baby deer half a mile across the snowy wilderness, and had set out alone in the storm to help-
Of course, Tony burst into peals of laughter at that. Steve fixed him with a faux-irritated expression, while Bucky smiled with mock innocence.
When he looked back, Tony was still smiling at him.
The same primal instinct.
“Oh fuck-” Tony barked, cut short when he felt the friction of the couch pressed hard against his still-sensitive cock. And then he felt Steve’s hands pushed against the inside of his thighs, parting Tony’s legs, and Tony raced to surrender to it. He spread his legs, lifting his ass, already begging, “Jesus Steve I want you to fuck me, please fuck me, please-”
“And what about what I
But, right in the middle of that logical, highly efficient thought process, there was this strange feeling from inside his chest. A sensation that seemed to run under his skin and between his muscles, entirely separate to him even though it came from every part of him. Like pain in a phantom limb, or an itch that wasn’t really there, or…
He’d never imagined he would be one of those people who could just pull the person they loved aside and kiss them, just because they wanted to.
this could be connected to Tony.
Unfortunately, even that turned out to be more difficult than he’d expected.
“Huh,” just sort of fell out of Steve’s mouth. And then he had to stop himself and swallow hard, suddenly worried he’d tear up.
Tony looked comfortable like this.
He’d long since stopped caring what Nick Fury or SHIELD or the US Government thought of him - he couldn’t pretend otherwise. He wouldn’t have let anyone on earth tell him to keep a secret from Tony…
“I don’t give a shit

In the end, as usual, he’d resorted to an uneasy compromise; wandering aimlessly around the corridors of the Tower, and feeling bad about it.
“Good,” he whispered. There was a soft pause, as Steve exhaled slowly, and Tony settled against his chest. And then Steve went on, quietly, “as soon as we’re done here, I’ll take you home.”
There was no argument, however well thought out or cleverly communicated, that would dissuade people of that inherent

in removing all the earlier pictures from the internet – but he’d thought a few would have slipped through, surely? Paparazzi shots of Stark in his teen years, or press photographs of his parent’s funeral, or pictures from people’s private collections, uploaded to Facebook years after they were taken. Something on one of SHIELDs servers even, where Stark shouldn’t have been able to get to it…
Not feeling any of the anxiety he had just dutifully noted, not
Heart beating hard in his ears, Steve made a run for the back of the room – keeping his body low and his movements fluid, calculating the maximum cover as he went. He was greatly relieved to find that his stealth was more a question of intelligence than strength. Okay, he couldn’t push himself forward quite as quickly as he would’ve liked – but he still

asked Tony to forgive him, he’d asked to come home – and, now that he was here, he had to figure out what he was going to say about all of that stuff. Or not.
“I know, most people have recipes stuck to their fridge,” Tony muttered self-consciously, putting two pans down onto the counter next to Steve. Steve caught himself, looking away from the flyer so sharply that only drew more attention.

And then the soft press of Tony’s lips, the slow drag of his tongue… sealing the wound.
And then Steve felt Tony’s legs press up to the back of his thighs, Tony’s cock completely buried inside him, one hand moving from Steve’s hip to a firm grip on his shoulder.
And then the folder fell open in his hands, and everything went cold.

But he just
“What the hell happened?” Sam demanded-
Not that the practical considerations were in any way comforting. Having analysed every aspect of Bucky’s treatment, Tony had been forced to conclude that, yes, he could fix this thing – but it was going to take weeks. There was just no getting around the fact that Bucky would need time to heal between procedures, that his body would need time to adapt to the changes and learn the new programming. However efficient Tony was, however successful each individual session, it was still going to mean asking them to come back… again and again.
There had always been Bucky to prioritise, or put at ease, or be polite in front of.
And he saw that same panic rise up in Steve’s eyes, that same instinct to interrupt Tony, to deny or downplay or deflect these words… Not because he didn’t like hearing them, but because he thought he wasn’t allowed. That instantly relatable feeling of tension,
It mattered that Tony
– a more immediate, physical instinct than Tony usually inspired in him.
“Bio-engineering kit, please” Tony said, stiffly, not meeting Steve’s eye.

But he was so tired of thinking.
Rhodey huffed impatiently, and then gestured towards the little kitchenette area,

But no…
Steve frowned, and repeated the sentence in his head… but just when he was about to tell Tony that he didn’t get it, he felt Tony shift beneath him. It took him a moment to realise that Tony was making an awkward grab for the gym bag, still sitting at the side of the bed, and by the time he’d worked it out Tony had already pulled a large white envelope from the side pocket.
That, thanks to the most tragic culmination of office politics to ever occur, he was undercover at some sinister cult retreat with
He could find endless social and political metaphors for their situation, each leading to a different conclusion. All of them underpinned by unspoken assumptions that Tony could never quite pin down.
Rows and rows of glass vials…
He had to
“Where is he?”
Tony sighed impatiently and pushed himself up off of the floor. There was an unpleasant roll of dizziness, and the beginnings of a stress headache behind his eyes.
“Jesus, you are
“Okay,” Tony breathed. And then, after the slightest little pause he added, “Thank you.”
me is that I’m not… taking care of him, right now. So, I don’t know. Maybe I’m just losing my mind…” he conceded, letting his head fall back into the couch cushions, his eyes drifting aimlessly over the workshop as he got carried away with his thoughts…
He wasn’t sure why, exactly… But it felt like the
Steve’s free hand stroked down over Tony’s hip again, holding him firm as he slowly pulled his fingers out of him - already pulling Tony closer.
A simmering of guilty resentment, a cool disappointment of some kind…
And there was that internal conflict again.
“Tony, are you okay?” Steve breathed, like he could hardly dare to believe.
“Could say the same to you.” Nat observed, a smile hidden somewhere in her voice. “You working late?”
It took all of Tony’s strength to keep his eyes open. Oh, if he could have
been blaming Steve for. And even if it wasn’t ‘one mistake’… it wasn’t the callous, self-interested betrayal that Tony had turned it into, either.
And there were so many people. Beyond the realm of Tony’s estimation, completely outside the dimensions through which he measured things. Hundreds of thousands. Half a million, maybe. Streaming into the hall through archways on all sides, spreading out onto the floor and up into the stands and out past the reach of Tony’s vision…
Steve was embarrassed that this was the first time the thought had occurred to him - it seemed so obvious now.
And then of course Steve remembered how Tony had ended up sleeping in his bed – he remembered
Steve loved him so much he didn’t know what to do with himself

, if there was no one to contradict it? Would the years in between have been real, if not for people like Steve and Bruce and Thor to vouch for them?
“Well, maybe it’s just because I’m naive that I took all that for granted,” Rhodey shrugged, nonchalantly. “And,

And for a second Tony just looked at him in the same adoring way. At first, he just saw those flawless blue eyes blown wide with need and those pretty lips, parted slightly, still wet…
And then Tony remembered the sharp pain in his hip, and the sticky weight of his shirt clinging to his skin.
By now, Tony felt strong enough to be the one to help Steve to his feet. He knew he’d have to drink again when he got home, that it would take a little while for his body to heal every trace of this injury-
. Just how much of his very soul he’d allowed to be dictated by the invisible pressure of Captain America and the Greater Good. Without the expectations of other people or the constant ticking of a mission countdown, Steve didn’t know how to shape his thoughts...Where to begin...
“It’s okay, it’s not your fault,” Tony sighed. “I don’t think anyone is in their right mind, right now.”
“Okay, I’ll see you then,” Tony managed – and hung up before Bucky could say anything.
It hit him sometime in the middle of the afternoon.
“How far d’you get?”
“Hm, I’m sure you do,” he replied ironically, raising an eyebrow.
And Adam just… smiled.
But, eventually, the anxiety of hiding in the bedroom was as bad as the anxiety of sitting in the living room, so Tony accepted that they’d just have to be early for a daily briefing, for the first time in his life.
It wasn’t Clint’s original farmhouse. Like billions of people around the world, Mrs Barton and her children had woken from a deep sleep to find that their home was no longer theirs - in their case, because Clint had abandoned it to become a lone vigilante, leaving it to be claimed by a string of squatters before it had been claimed by the elements.

Nope, brain not quite up to actual words yet. That fragment of a coherent thought just dissolved into the general idea, the

is that you can work out some of those things faster than the computer can” Tony smiled, laying his head down again. “I mean, SHIELD had a lot of different tests they used, but most of it comes down to problem solving. And, you know, if the person you’re testing just solves the problem the second you show it to him, and if the solution he comes up with is smarter than the computer simulation…” He mused. And then, in the same interested, conversational tone, he added “But, on the other hand, it turns out that all either of us have ever wanted was each other, and it took us seven years to solve that puzzle – so, I don’t know, maybe, actually, we’re both morons.”
“Well, maybe not on Operation Rebirth, or the serum
It was of a completely different nature to any other pleasure he was currently feeling - enough that he didn’t even care about losing the friction that he’d had such a teasing hint of.
“So…Hi.” He managed, over what was apparently a stupid grin… which he didn’t know he’d broken into…
Steve paused in front of the mirror, halfway through buttoning his shirt. He suddenly had a sinking sense of déjà vu.
He screwed his face up and let go of an irritated groan.
Touched that Tony would do this for him – desperate to avoid it for him.
Oh, but surely he wouldn’t-
He looked at Tony and he just

“Hey. Come in, have a seat,” Tony told them, casually… At least, Steve thought it was ‘casually.’ Maybe it was friendly… or, maybe, it had sounded impatient and kinda blunt, actually…
Tony sighed sadly at himself. Not for the first time, he wondered whether he was making this whole thing too complicated-
okay?” Tony asked, dropping to sit beside him. Steve breathed a laugh.

that it is wrong – don’t you?” Adam went on, raising his eyebrows.
“It’s a pill” Steve told him, carefully feeling one of the sachets between his thumb and forefinger. “Well, four in total.”
...Oh, God, Steve knew that look.
He was
“Did you ever talk to anyone?” Tony asked, cautiously. There was a rising feeling of discomfort in him… an anxiety about what he was about to find out. “When you came out of the ice, or, since then, I don’t know… I mean, did you ever speak to a therapist, or-” But Steve had physically flinched at the sound of the word, shocking Tony to a stop.
“…But it’s a black and gold party?” Steve frowned.
ever thought about it, from Steve’s point of view?
of Steve’s bodily processes… That, as she put it, he may well experience arousal more intensely than other men.
Tony glanced back to his file reader, and thought for a moment.
It was as though those two words had broken him.
All the air just evaporated out of Steve’s lungs. He found himself standing to attention, even though his knees suddenly felt dangerously weak-
And Steve slammed into him,
just ten more minutes until an elite team of SHIELD scientists, soldiers and secret agents came bursting through the door of the warehouse, shouting orders and demanding attention as they wheeled a gurney into the walk-in refrigerator at the back of the room.
Steve felt a spike of anxiety from the very bottom of his gut. When he swallowed it down, it tasted bitter.

This time, there wasn’t that little pause when Tony stood up from his work. This time, they were already in the middle of a conversation – the talk they’d almost started last week, about the true nature of progress.

“-And this isn’t about
Right now, he simply had a sense that things weren’t coming to him quite as clearly or resolutely as they sometimes did… But there was still something there. Something he could lean into.
And then Sam stepped back to look into Bucky’s eyes, a smile tugging gently at the corner of his lips as he gave his head a tiny little shake,
“Oh, what do you want from me?” He demanded with faux exasperation. “I’m up to my nose in balls here-”
Steve woke up smiling.
In all the time he’d been angry at Steve, he’d never once crafted a rant for the person who had gone out of his way to hurt people, deliberately, out of vengeance and spite. It wasn’t
Steve was glad he had a chance to cover his hurt, while Tony’s eyes were averted.
Suffice to say, Steve hadn’t given that part of it any more thought than Tony had – but, if he

And the issue had been less of an issue this time, thanks to Tony. At least Tony hadn’t spent the last two weeks suggesting alternative painkillers, like the team at NASA did – repeatedly missing the point that Bucky
As much fun as it was, as good as it felt, to finally get his say… This had only ever been the start of it. This was just foreplay. In the fantasy, in the purest sense, Tony got to see the reaction to this-
for Tony - if Tony was permanently, endlessly devastated to have had all his meagre hopes crushed like that… Well, that was his problem, he supposed.
That thought was enough to temper his happy demeanour, as they started the descent down to the basement.
The floor just rolled from underneath him. His heart suddenly leapt up into his throat, his head throbbing with a swelling pressure, like it might actually burst.

b) Whether this DOES end up as balanced in the end, or if perhaps it DOES still merit a 'TeamTony' tag, or a 'Steve Friendly' tag or whatever... As I say, I've attempted balance here, but I know I have my own biases and, for various reasons, there are elements that don't even get discussed here (Team Steve aren't *there* to answer any of the points Tony makes about them, for example, and they rather dance around The Accords...) So, I'd really appreciate input on this. More than anything I'd like to ensure it's accurately labelled, so that people can choose whether its something they want to read.
?” Tony whined, looking up at the ceiling with an incredulous expression on his face. At times like this, he could swear he felt JARVIS smiling at him. A patient, affectionate sort of smile, probably.
Tony heard the little beep. The commotion of the team filing into the White Room. He could feel people looking at him, but he didn’t think anything of it. He couldn’t tear his thoughts away from all those memories of
...Oh.
“Here,” Tony smiled kindly, handing Steve one of the water bottles that he’d apparently put down on the bedside table. Keeping a firm hand to the back of Steve’s head while he drank in long, slow gulps. Steve let his chest thrum happily, as the sweet, crisp taste of it soothed his throat and cooled his lungs, his heavy panting finally coming under control. And then he let Tony take the empty bottle from him and toss it away, Steve’s head lolling helplessly against Tony’s side as he pulled in slow, cleansing breaths. He shivered happily as Tony ran a hand through his hair, stroking the dense heat away. And then Tony whispered, very softly,
He recognised it immediately, rather than ‘thought it’, per se. Just the overall effect of being warm, and snug and surrounded by softness. The general feeling of being rested, and satisfied, and safe. The vague awareness that this was unusual – but only insofar as it made it seem all the nicer.
Tony allowed himself a brief moment to dissolve in relief.
Steve was doing – there was just Steve’s chest, right there, and this increasingly frantic
sorry than you have to be, so… got that wrong. My bad.” He joked. And then looked at Steve more seriously, and added “You don’t have to be sorry for the rest of your life Steve. You don’t have to keep saying it.”
…Shame the right apology couldn’t just fall out of his mouth like that.
He might’ve felt the cool sweep of a damp cloth over the back of his legs…
“Oh, fuck, Tony, baby, God,” Steve whimpered, still struggling to grind up against him – simply unable to, now that his body had fallen weak around him.
nightmares, about portals and space and Chitauri warships, now intermixed with the dark visions Wanda had put into his head.
“Oh God, God Steve, please,” he babbled, mindlessly, his hand grasping at Steve’s shoulder entirely of its own accord. And then he felt Steve’s tongue flit over the head of his cock, like an electric shock. And then the slow drag of those beautiful lips as Steve took the length of him again, and then the tight heat of his throat. “Oh fuck, so good, please, oh please-”
his own instinct to assume the guilt for everything, to ‘rise above’ any need for an apology, to be the ‘good leader’ he’d been shown in his childhood… He saw the frustration and discomfort it had always caused him, even before he was Captain America.
“So, what’s the catch?”

And if this guy made you feel good about yourself – if it’s maybe making you question even… some of this,” and he gestured to the workshop, as a shorthand for Tony’s grim and lonely life, “then yeah, I think that’s a good thing.

Steve didn’t need to think those words to know that. He just

, that he should have put a stop to this – if not when he and Tony had been partnered up, then when they’d realised that The Facility could only be accessed via magic portal. He thought back to that secret location out in the desert, to the space that had opened in the air, like one of Strange’s portals without the sparkles. It’d looked a lot more sinister without the sparkles. And the ‘agent’ gesturing at it, a salesman’s smile still plastered on his face, even though Tony’s cheque was already folded into his back pocket… The strange colour of the earth, on the other side of the doorway… It’d all turned Steve’s stomach.

a big overarching body… And I want that to be us.”
But there again was that comfort in inevitability. The reassurance that it no longer mattered what he wanted to think about, or what it would be sensible to think about - for as long as that briefcase was sitting on his desk, it was going to command his attention. No matter how horrible it was, no matter what the consequences, no matter what his original plans, this was now the only available starting point…
The person she wanted Tony to be was actually just a responsible, reliable human being with a basic regard for their own safety and some sort of stable long-term plan. To cry that she was trying to ‘change him’, to crack under the pressure of simply considering another person, was all too pathetic for Tony to deal with-
There was a sharp twinge of heat as Tony pulled his over-sensitive cock free, and lubed himself up as quickly as he ever had in his life. His desperation had already heightened every sensation, setting every nerve in his body alight-

He couldn’t help that it struck him immediately as very sad. That there was still that little pang of feeling…he wasn’t sure what to call it now, but something he’d felt about Steve before any of this happened. He knew there was a time when he would’ve asked Steve about this. Back when he had no reason to wonder if he’d be making an idiot of himself…

He glanced up and scanned the drive more carefully, an uncomfortable, exposed feeling crawling over his skin as he worked out what he was looking for…
Tony looked up at the monitor that was mounted on the back wall of the room - even though he knew he’d have been alerted about even the smallest inconsistency. He looked simply because he wanted to
“Steve,” he murmured, running his eyes down over Steve’s chest, already lifting his arms to grab for him-
But Steve was as fast and fluid as ever, wriggling his way free of his clothes in a matter of seconds and kicking them aside. And then he crawled up the bed, lying beside Tony and pulling him onto his chest…
And there was Tony.
The loneliness and loss of this strange, alien future - the grief and trauma of his very existence.
He was happy. Just happy, and nothing else.
…That complicated and considered – and
“Well, normally what you’re feeling bad for is getting drunk in the first place. Even if you didn’t do anything, you wake up and think, why didn’t I stop before the Tequila Slammers?” Tony explained. “But you know why you didn’t stop before the Tequila Slammers, and you can’t actually feel bad for getting drunk, and you didn’t even

In the deep, dull pain of Tony’s teeth digging into his flesh, just hard enough to bruise, right at the limit of how far Tony could go, to feel him and taste him and
Oh… that was all very rude…
He still had no idea what he and Steve could possibly have, if he didn’t.
An uncomfortable sensation curdled in his stomach. He asked himself if he was dreaming - entirely hypothetically, of course, because no one ever
Not bossy, or demeaning, or controlling – kind, and calm, and considerate.
“And the Commandos, and a whole thing about the war effort,” Steve nodded.
Steve’s lips parted in a silent gasp, his eyes lighting up with open, vulnerable joy as he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist.
“Yes, fuck me, please fuck me, please-” again, his pleading was cut short by a cry, this time because Tony had taken his hand away to wet his fingers. Steve willed himself not to hold his breath, feeling himself coming close to tears in the few seconds that Tony wasn’t touching him-

She’d never thought to correct him when he referred to the helicarrier as their first meeting, never thought it might make a relevant addition to a personal conversation, never considered that maybe Steve would just like to know…
Out of habit, his raised his arm, about to put his fingers into his mouth-
Steve felt it wash over him like warm water.
“Oh, fuck Tony
“Breathless?” Steve frowned, frantically searching through all that new information he’d had thrown at him, a few hours earlier. All those facts he’d not catalogued or processed yet… “Is that… meant to happen?”
Hoping that Tony would like it.
“I can’t think about this,” he snapped, talking to himself as much as Steve…
Right behind him, Steve heard Bucky breathe a little giggle - which

Steve,” Tony hissed, desperate and possessive. Steve moaned softly, his cock twitching as he replayed it in his head.
Tony almost laughed, looking at the blinding sparkles that they were throwing in all directions. But, before he could say anything, he was stopped by an urgent grip on his arm, and the sound of Bucky hissing,
“I don’t know what you mean,” the woman stammered, already reaching for the alarm on her belt.
And then Tony dropped his head again to seal the wound, sending another agonising shock through Steve as he sucked far too gently against the cut,
And, of course, Tony had no idea which one of those things to think about, or what to think about any of them - and he hadn’t wanted to think about any of that, anyway.
He kept thinking back to various points in that awful, awkward appointment. The meaningless comments he’d made, because he couldn’t mention what he was so anxious about… growing ever more anxious, the longer it went unsaid.
Instead, he simply carried through with the heavy movements of his limbs, falling from one step to the next in a comfortable trance…
He thought about his life. He just let all these unrestricted thoughts occur to him – what he really thought and why things were this way and what he could actually do about it…

Because Tony had spent the last two days having to pay attention in meetings, and make small talk with business associates that he’d likely never see again - and having to think about his expression. Several times he’d caught himself, halfway through some detailed memory of Steve, this same silly grin plastered all over his face. And every time he’d been forced to drag his thoughts back into room, Tony had petulantly bemoaned the fact that he couldn’t even

Steve felt his mind snap back into focus. An immediate shift from all those huge, life-long ideas, back to this one moment. He stopped trying to comprehend how wonderful and unlikely it was that Tony wanted to kiss him, and got to thinking that-
“Tony made Vision because he’d already made Ultron. Everything Tony ever did was to redeem himself for some weapon he’d already made.”
And Steve actually let out an anguished little moan, and…
He was already berating himself for not having a

Tony glanced pointedly at Wesley’s couch, trying to coax him out of hovering in the hallway. Wesley took a few cautious steps into the room, but didn’t sit down.
But it wasn’t anxiety. Whatever it was… it was

Tony threw his head back and let out a soundless scream, stars exploding behind his eyes as that visceral heat flooded up his back. He felt as though he was being split open, the sensation tearing through the core of him, every cell in his body searing as he was stretched to his very limit.
Along with yet another shiver of guilt, and the creeping understanding that this outcome was probably exactly what he deserved...
Tony didn’t know whether to smile at that, or cry.

Steve felt his stomach knot sharply - and the immediate, simple impulse-
“You haven’t been to the med team yet?” Steve frowned.

And Steve felt his chest clench, suddenly overcome by such a pure and painful affection for him-

And then Tony leant back just enough to look up at Steve, the solid strength of him still pressed up against Tony’s chest, his hands still curled protectively around Tony’s shoulders… The blue of his eyes was flecked with gold, tiny little sparkles clinging to those impossibly long eyelashes, his lips full and soft and
Even that had been hard for Tony to listen to, Steve could tell.

For the first time ever, Steve was thinking about human nature as though he was a part of it - as though it was okay for him to have the same moral limits and human failings as anyone else.

“Tell you what, let’s look for anything that also mentions a ‘mortal blessing’, or the name Ahreddan…” He added, as a whole other idea started unfolding…
And there had come a moment in all of this when Tony became horribly aware that he was looking at a metaphor for his entire life. Staring at this pathetic collection of clothes that he didn’t even like, realising that he had no idea how to dress for someone else, what he was even trying to say with his personal choices, how people in the real world saw these things, now… It was a moment that perfectly symbolised how isolated he’d become, how far beyond help he was, how far he’d drifted away from human…

“...I just - I don’t really know what I think is going to happen now…” Tony struggled on, the blush darkening as he forced himself to maintain eye contact. “And really, that just means I never thought I’d actually be in this situation - I’ve never even asked myself if…
He didn’t want this wound to poison those memories.
And the instincts hadn’t always been the same.
And then he felt Steve collapse away from him, his body turning to water under Tony’s hands, and when Tony finally pulled back and gulped for air – God, he was
Steve blinked, momentarily shocked that Tony knew that name… But then he remembered the throw-away joke that Bucky had made earlier in the evening, when it took him two attempts to jump up onto the operating table.
Maybe, if he’d never had the Captain America Myth to complicate things, Steve would have at least
“Who the hell is Bucky?”
It set Tony’s teeth on edge.
“Hi guys!” Tony waved brightly. “Long story, and can’t explain it all now, but this is Zan – her family are involved in the shit-show happening here, and she asked for our help in stopping them. She has a recording of her own confession on UBS number one – I suggest you listen to that first, if you want some idea of what’s going on.”
Right into Tony.

But on nights like tonight… It just hurt. Tonight, Tony was too weary to analyse it, too melancholy to examine it. Nights like tonight the sadness was just
What he probably did have was money problems.

Bucky immediately feels better.
And Steve liked the way Tony shivered into the sensation, the trembling moan he could feel on Tony’s lips - and there was nothing more to think about. He caressed his hands over the curve of Tony’s ass, grinding up against him, deliberately dragging a low, keening moan from him-
part of that…
And then once again words abandoned Tony completely, as Steve began to trail those same gentle kisses around the edge of the arc reactor, his tongue sweeping over the scarred lines that surrounded it. Tony’s breath hitched, and shuddered, and caught, the pitch of his whimpering getting higher as Steve worked his way lower down Tony’s chest. He’d never felt anything like the strange, sparkling sensation that was dancing over his skin, reaching places he’d never been touched before. He’d never been this painfully tense with
He just whimpered into the sheets, chained down and spread open and just letting Tony fuck him. That pleasure in him building faster now, like it pushing up at his skin, concentrating deep in his muscles as Tony fucked more and more of it into him – until he felt like he was physically, bodily full of this sensation, until it pushed right up at the very limits of it, the very edge of so-good-it-almost-hurt

But he couldn’t tell Steve no.
“Bagged blood,” Tony replied, sounding oddly distant – like he was thinking about something else. “I mean, until I know… I can’t bite you. So. It’ll just have to be-”
It was being able to say, just to himself, that he was happy with the way things worked out - even if other people weren’t. Knowing that, however flawed his choices, none of them were made with his own happiness in mind. Recognising that he couldn’t help it if circumstances favored him for once in his damn life… that he couldn’t help everyone who wasn’t so lucky.
So, he was just going to get up, and have a shower, and deal with Steve when it came to it.
part of him knew that Fury had no right to ask this of him, that SHIELD had had no right to disrespect everything he’d died for, that they deserved to clean up their own mess…
Another stretch of time trying to pick any one problem to focus on. That was just unnerving.
“I’ve slept for seventy years sir, I think I’ve had my fill,” he muttered. Begrudgingly, he gestured to the living area,
When the occasional flash occurred to him, like a sudden stab wound to his soul, he always flinched away from it. Thought his way around it, acknowledged it without actually thinking about it, shut his brain down completely – whatever it took to avoid going back there. Just knowing it was in his head somewhere was enough to coat Tony’s tongue with a bitter taste.
The front door swung open, flooding the living room with grey, watery sunlight. The shapes Steve had been staring at for half an hour were instantly rendered unfamiliar, as the modest interior of Nick's neat little New York apartment came into life. An excited thrumming started up under Steve’s ribs, building as the sound of movement drew closer.

Tony’s heart clenched tight. A horrible, cold feeling overwhelmed him like rising flood water, a feeling of drowning in his own inadequacy - because he couldn’t think of how to stop Steve from hurting.
It was only that the pain of waiting proved to be so much worse. It was the anxiety of what was about to happen that pushed Steve onto his feet,

“Yeah?” Tony enquired brightly, surprised and immediately pleased. “...But I thought you didn’t want anyone to know you were here, yet?”
Adam breathed out another laugh. Wiser, somehow… or just sadder, it was hard to say.
Steve do?
Steve felt that giddiness in his stomach break out into full on butterflies, as he tilted his head as carefully as he could-
And that pressure in him just kept building, as Tony pushed him closer and closer to the edge. That feeling of being right at his limit and still being filled, wanting so much to break.

And he probably would’ve picked a random direction and simply started walking, except that a familiar voice called out from right behind him - and Steve’s whole body froze.
and relax his shoulders.
He was looking forward to seeing Steve again. He’d spent the whole day happily thinking about the things they’d talked about, and wondering what sort of week Steve had, and remembering things he’d thought of saying to him, over the last few days.
And yes, there were alarm bells. A thousand incoherent questions about what the hell he was doing and where this could possibly go and all the reasons that he would regret this in the morning-
He felt Tony buck sharply in his hands, his grip tightening in Steve’s hair.

Eventually they found four booths, in a X shape, so that each had two padded silk walls – with couches so wide, it was really more a bed with a little square cut out of one corner, for the table to slot into. The one they chose faced an empty couch, and behind that there was just the bar… which was probably as secluded as it was going to get.

“What’s going on?” Tony asked on autopilot. There was a soft mechanical whir as Rhodey knelt down to face him.
“I know you can take out an army all on your own - but this is not just any army, is it? And I would like you to know that I really did listen to that, and I know how much you’re dreading this, and if I thought I really wouldn’t make a difference then I swear I’d just sit this one out, just to make you feel better. But - if you stop being nuts for a minute - you
The involuntary way he jerked his cock even deeper
He could process information in a completely different way.
A bodily desperation to carry on with it-
And now there was nothing left to be afraid of, nothing left to outrun.
“Steve, Steve, can you hear me?” He whispered-
“You wanna go somewhere else?” Tony just… guessed. Except, as he was saying it, he realised it wasn’t exactly a guess. That he could tell that Steve had just remembered this place was somewhat silly. Not even offensive or distasteful – just too commercial and too fake and too on the nose. That he’d sort of known that’s what Steve would think about this place… because he knew
with Tony, so complicated. That he wouldn’t be nearly as worried about these new impulses, if it weren’t for Tony-
And then time just seemed to… slow down….
Steve’s attempts to continue begging were cutting into jagged, hiccupped cries, as wave after wave of pleasure began building up in his already sensitive muscles. There was a shock of excitement every time Steve heard the chains rattle against the headboard, adding to every second of anticipation up until this moment, and every wordless longing Steve had ever felt, and every perfect teasing pleasure up until this point-

Experimenting – and it wasn’t

“Oh-fuck-that-feels-good,” Steve babbled, barely aware he was talking, as he writhed against Tony’s mouth. Gently urging Tony into him, trying to work himself off against Tony’s teeth, trying to chase that rush of pain.

“…not that I can think of.” Zan shook her head “I… had to think very hard, to prepare this much, and I didn’t think… I wasn’t sure what you’d ask, so…”
He just about managed to register
And then he felt Tony press a single, chaste kiss to his hipbone – and it stung.
He knew exactly what he’d been feeling twenty minutes earlier - anxiety and misery. A cold dread that’d weighed down on him since the moment he realised that he
He walked over to the nearest work bench and lifted the case onto it. He flicked both of the clasps open with a sharp, unified crack. He felt a rush of heat run up his spine as he finally opened it-
that was the funniest thing he’d ever heard in his life - but it was.
By the fact that he didn’t want to look away from it.
Which was why there was still an elated grin on Tony’s face as he threw himself onto the workshop couch.
And then the door clicked softly, and swung open, snapping both Steve and Bucky to straight-backed attention. A tall, shaggy-haired silhouette appeared, his features melting into detail as he walked slowly towards them.
And, by now, Tony was just completely lost in this. Running with it, letting one thought crash into the next, letting it all just fall out of his mouth.
And then he thought, quite clearly -
Tony had spent the last few minutes in a state of highly focused shock. A strangely distant hyper awareness, in which he could see every detail and hear every word – but he couldn’t remember thinking a single thing about any of it. It was like his brain just knew to shut the fuck up, in case he missed anything.
he hated Obie, and all the different ways Obie had screwed him over, and all the arguments Tony might’ve made…
I let down like this, I hate hearing you say you’re not like other people to me-”
Waiting for Steve.
“No, you can’t.” He told her, solemnly. “If you do that, then…” And he paused, as though he was trying to think of a way to explain it, and then he shook his head, as though he’d given up on it, and then he looked at her imploringly. “We just
“Look Steve, I know you’re one of those people that need space with things,” Bucky sighed, dragging Steve halfway out of his haze. When he opened his eyes again the room was too bright. It took him a second to focus on Bucky, now sitting in his jeans in the wicker chair at the end of the bed.
softly,
cozy, and authentic-
“You know, you can stop with the hard sell - we literally can’t leave.”
Tony just couldn’t make himself tell Steve no.
Bucky pulled away from him, putting one hand firmly against Steve’s back and guiding him to lie down on the bed. Steve felt the world carry on rolling backwards, the ceiling swaying in front of his eyes. He was vaguely aware of Bucky standing up, and the scraping sound of the closet door opening-
He heard Tony squeal with laughter, just behind him. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Bucky throwing his head back, exactly the same way he used to when he was a little boy. Sam snorted in surprise, a string of giggles pouring free after it.
have more than that?
“Okay,” the suit waved him quiet, impatiently. “I’m going to need you to stand and guard the door of that refrigerator,” he pointed to where the men in black were now wheeling the gurney over the threshold, the other two suits following inside to do a final check. Steve could hear fragments of their conversation, all of which he recognised from his months of mission prep - strange to think that it was the exact same words, in the exact same tone, each and every time… “Do not move until the medical team comes down to collect the cargo, do you understand?” The man talking to Steve carried on. Steve nodded enthusiastically.
JARVIS?” He snapped. “
He realised... the word Vampire wasn’t surreal, or ridiculous, or anything to do with those campy, Halloween images-
Steve’s head snapped upright. Still lightheaded and confused, it took him a second or two to pick the shape of a man out of the shadows at the back of the room-
Steve nodded back and took the rice over to the sink to drain it, equally relieved to find that it was cooked properly. And he wasn’t even sure why he was so bothered – he didn’t really believe that Tony would think less of him if the meal turned out badly. They could probably make a joke of it, it might have been a funny story they told later-
Even if Tony didn’t feel the same way.
Steve just held his breath, every inch of his being frozen in painful alarm – like an animal under the gaze of a predator.

big on the drug thing here, that’s definitely something…” Tony went on, his eyes falling shut. “I didn’t see any, like, office, or anything… but I didn’t go back over the whole place… I guess maybe back where reception was, or something…” His voice grew heavier, until it trailed off completely. Steve finally realised that Tony was falling asleep.
There was a stab of panic when his eyes caught on the silhouette of a man walking out of the shadows. Tony’s ribs clenched tight, an icy wave of adrenaline crashing through him…
“Because not everyone can fly it,” Steve answered, trying to ignore that same dark possessiveness that was trying to push up through his chest. “People think you can just step into it and
And then Steve heard a voice in his head… his
Because it seemed to Steve that the only alternative to saying any of that was lying about it. Pretending he was sorry for things when he wasn’t. Pretending he’d come to think things he didn’t think at all. He couldn’t see how that would make things better between them, either. And, seeing as he was

Suddenly it occurred to Tony that he
They were in over their head, then.
Right at the very moment that there was something to hope for, just when he saw all the mistakes he’d made, right when he’d finally realised that he could be more than that-
“Oh, yeah, earlier, when we were in one of the bars, I saw a woman I think works here, and I’m pretty sure she isn’t human” Steve reported back, talking too fast. “And, I saw her again in the hallway, and I thought I’d try to ask her who she was – I don’t know why really, I just… ‘cos she’s the only non-human I’ve seen, and I couldn’t figure out what her job was, or… I don’t know, I guess I was going to ask her… she wasn’t there when I got out there, anyway.”
And then a gasp of outraged shock, as Tony jabbed a syringe into her neck.
that I will do it. Because I know this plan hasn’t been corrupted by the usual human failings. I know I haven’t been misled by false ideology, or false perceptions. I know I’m not motivated by irrational self-interest. I know I have planned for every part of this. So, you see, I don’t have to worry

“You’ve
And then, almost as suddenly as it had started, Steve had felt himself coming to a sniffling, trembling stop. His head buzzed with a strange feeling of afterglow, his body more relaxed than it had been when he first broke down… And he’d realised-
Automatically, he pictured Steve, pacing up and down the living room as he ticked items off of their checklist. And it probably did occur to Tony that he should really be helping-
“Oh, we don’t want you to say anything,” the Rousseau replied, “we have the show all set up - but it’s all about
He hated himself for breaking his promises to Pepper. He hated himself for being right in the middle fucking up the best thing that had ever happened to him, despite all the second chances he’d been given, in spite of the fact that he’d never deserved it…
He shifted into panic mode immediately. He didn’t think about the next words he blurted out – he was blindly
It was going to mean facing up to the fact that he’d been hiding in a workshop for twenty years. It was going to mean confronting all the things he’d been hiding

Tony’s eyes immediately fell on the flutter of Steve’s pulse, like he was drawn to it.
There was a jarring

“He had a big house on the French border, and he used to rent rooms out – like a bed and breakfast, without the breakfast,” Steve laughed at the memory. “And the Commando’s stayed there for like, a month, I think? While we were tracking a Hydra scientist… But, y’know, we knew we weren’t going to be there long, so it wasn’t a serious thing, obviously. Just… a thing.” And he shrugged, and glanced back at Tony-

it was such a relief and a thrill and a joy to say those words out loud… but it still was.

“What’re you doing?” He whispered,

Tony laughed again… a soft, breathy laugh that sounded… distant. Sad, almost. Bucky saw Sam’s gaze sharpen as he recognised it, and they shared a concerned glance before they turned to look at Tony.
And Tony just smiled, like he understood.
“Oh, right,” Tony accepted, and shook his head, and steeled his expression again. “And you’ve brought us here to go to a

But, as he’d sat there putting everything into boxes, there was that

, Bucky knew exactly which story Tony was referencing. A full mental image popped up - he and Steve, aged eight, standing to attention in front of an irate troop master… whilst covered in mustard. Steve, trying to keep his temper as he explained that it wasn’t their fault. Bucky, trying not to laugh.
Until he thought of Tony.
Steve would’ve been thinking about Tony, and remembering Tony, and
Tony could endure the unthinkable grief of losing him, and give up on the only romantic relationship that he’d ever cared about - not to mention denying a powerful impulse that felt natural and right, and for all he knew actually was. All to keep the option of a conventional life, that he’d never even wanted. All to avoid a shady fear that he couldn’t even name.
...Maybe living together and making vacation plans and even getting married one day could all be a part of it-
It was the specific tone of Tony’s voice. Rich and warm and almost dangerous…
“It’s okay Steve, everything’s okay,” Tony promised, sitting himself upright. He felt Bucky slip away from him, as he took his own weight-
“Turns out, Mr Fisk isn’t the only person of interest to have been spotted in the vicinity of this hotel in the last six months,” Nick added, knowingly.
Well… It didn’t really matter now, seeing as the worst of… whatever it was, seemed to be passing. He still felt a little bit…

such a good opportunity… And Steve did want to leave all of his options open.
Steve groaned softly before he could stop himself, and then had to hope that Tony hadn’t heard it. He took a few ungainly steps in no particular direction, aimlessly looking for a flat surface to rest his weight on. He ended up leaning over one of Tony’s work desks, both palms pressed against the tabletop, his body braced into his arms.
…And a few things he’d yelled at Steve for, when really, he was mad at other people

Century. All the things he’d told
to share that with someone – the warm feeling of knowing he’d made Tony laugh.
“Oh, no. No thanks.”
Of all the many moments Steve had dreamed of doing over, his first meeting with Tony was the one he went back to most often. It might not have been the thing he most regretted - that would always be the secret he kept about the death of Tony’s parents, and the stupid decisions he made because of it. But, when it got to four in the morning and Steve still couldn’t sleep, it would always be those first few hours with Tony that he went over again...and again... Clenching his jaw as he remembered every exchange… Sighing wistfully as he thought of all the things he wished he’d said instead....
that flooded through his body in its wake. Every tension he’d been carrying, every emotion that was still too huge to process, every fear and outrage that he’d been forced to hold onto up until now… it all just washed away from him, leaving nothing but a wordless, floaty elation in its wake.
And then, as he was beginning to revel in the pleasant surprise of not feeling bad… he watched it heal.
And he couldn’t think what advantage Pierce would be seeking, in referencing that very obvious fact… It was more likely that he was just trying to be considerate, and that Steve was being paranoid about it…

And Tony moaned along with him as he swallowed desperately, his mind swimming with pleasure as the taste of it overwhelmed him. By the time Steve fell away, Tony’s body was throbbing with a primal sort of satisfaction, an intoxicated dizziness buzzing in his head.
Because, really, one week just

mean, that would make me walk away from you,” Tony carried on, breathlessly. “There isn’t anything I want in this world more than I want to be with you. I love you. I love every brilliant, brave, sweet, stupid, infuriating thing about you - and I would have, if I’d met you in 1942. And I’d have promised you forever without a second thought - and I’d have stood by you through anything. I don’t need a vampire impulse to tell me that.”

A feeling that it wouldn’t be

Steve standing there, with a comically exaggerated bemusement, his arms opened just slightly in a subconscious,
And Steve had the oddest stab of delight, when he realised that he was about to veer off script-
I am most irritated to say that - just for once - I actually had this update ready at a reasonable time... And then my google drive glitched out on me, I presume out of spite. So I have now stayed up until 6am, purely to spite it back... Which is, I'm sure, a totally rational response 🙈

He was angry that Steve had just gotten an idea in his head and run with it, without even thinking to let Tony know…
…And he waited.
. And then she walked away.
And for the first time Bucky thinks to look for Steve.
“...And I know it’s a painful memory,” Tony carried on pushing. “But I’m getting the impression that it’s more than that…”
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked, as he sat himself upright.

And it was getting harder and harder to concentrate on them.

for a while, and then everyone just forgot about him. I don’t think there was a scandal or anything,” He shrugged. “It’s like, no one ever mentions Barbara Stanwyck anymore, but she was still working until the 1980s…”
“You can relax,” he sighed, “I can’t think of a way to get out of it anyway.”
A sensitive shiver ran up the back of Steve’s neck, as Tony gently sealed the wound…
Steve briefly considered telling him that.
him. He missed the way he felt when Steve was there, he missed all the little human details of Steve.
“Oh, hang on, I remember the edible bubbles,” Bucky said, narrowing his eyes, “like, floaty, cotton-candy things,” and then a thought occurred to him, and he looked up at Sam. “Were you and Rhodey on a boat?”
Shattering into a full-on physical elation, when Steve walked in.
Tony’s breathing grew faster and shallower as Steve began to suck very gently at his neck, teasing with the edges of his teeth. That heat coiled tighter in the pit of Steve’s stomach, his cock throbbing hard as he heard that pleading edge on Tony’s voice-
to be safe, just ‘cos someone got hurt. And, you know, if someone had yelled at me that it was irresponsible to bring a fourteen-year-old in the first place – I’d quite happily tear them a new one.” And that serious, protective look flashed up in his eyes, that he got sometimes when he talked about Peter “Because they don’t know Peter and they don’t get to say – but, yeah, my point is, why I thought I could yell about you about Scott Lang’s criminal record… you know what, this is really inarticulate, I’m sorry.” And he smiled a self-conscious little smile “See, this is what a 270 IQ gets you – a lot of robots and verbal diarrhoea.” And he swallowed, and took a little breath, and started again.
The same guard visibly panicked and fired off three more shots in quick succession, leaving a trail of little darts up along Tony’s arm.
And Steve
So, Steve knew that he had to get a hold of himself in time to continue his explanation in the calm, measured way he intended…
“I have no idea what’s going on,” Tony admitted, as contestant number two launched into a dramatic forward roll, “but I don’t think he’s as good as Bruce.”
Frantically, he tried to at least gather them all into groups, to work out exactly how many conflicting priorities were battling for attention-
“…But
It was only an echo at this stage. A basic instinct. Just trying to contain himself, just for a minute, just because some little part of him remembered you were supposed to – even though Tony was already trying to move against him, a desperate, pleading edge on his shallow breathing,
himself to Tony-
“That’s one of the things it means, yes,” Tony grinned, and leant into him...
“Please,” he barked, dropping his shoulders and lifting his hips and trying to wriggle back against Steve’s hands - thrilled to find that Steve’s hold was too strong for Tony to be able to move him. “Please Steve, please-”
Or tried to – finding that the top half of his body was still heavy and sluggish, despite the rapidly building excitement. There was simply no question of Steve’s arms supporting his weight, or even of him lifting his head… But he did manage to brace his back just a bit, arching up as much as he could without
“Are you okay, Steve?”
Oh, there were so many words in Steve’s head right now…
And, somewhat begrudgingly, Steve softened again, and nodded.
Having someone to love in the way he’d always wanted; knowing that there was an alternative to the lost and lonely life he’d resigned himself to.
That submissive impulse, whatever it was, definitely seemed like more of a night before thing than a morning after thing - well, at least on his insufficient sample of two occasions, so far.
And, finally, it dawned on him-
And then they reached the couch, and Tony placed a gentle palm to Steve’s chest,

Steve hadn’t expected it, and he had no way to brace for it - he’d fallen into it before he even knew what was happening.
Thinking back to the soft room, the almost playful way Steve had undressed him, smiling kisses against his neck and arms and stroking his hands over him in a possessive caress…
to give Tony an explanation.
And it’s funny how the human mind works. What seemingly minor details it chooses to set aside. The way it can find them again when they actually matter.
“Tony, I-” Steve blurted, and then cut himself short. Tony raised his eyebrows at him,
“For intentionally getting you wasted” Tony sighed. And then, when Steve frowned at him, he added “I know, it’s ridiculous, and that’s what we were there to do and neither of us could know, blah, blah, blah… I dunno, habit probably. I just… feel like I should say sorry right now” He shrugged. He saw Steve pinch back a smile.
And Tony just grinned, and ran to answer it.
But he already knew that no one else would find him here.
‘The vampire thing’ was a list all of its own - a pandora's box of issues, that could spill out into all sorts of crises and mysteries and terrors the moment he opened it up.

“Yes, absolutely.”
And yes, the desire just to

I sincerely promise not to keep adding chapters of extras to this fic - if there is any more artwork etc to be added later, I'll edit this final chapter to include it.
But he also knew he couldn’t take that choice away from Steve - certainly not before he’d given it any real thought, or bothered to discuss it.
But that really wasn’t the same as having an issue with anything that was going on in this place. And, if he’d been here with Sam or Nat or… literally
Steve hissed under his breath before he could stop himself. Cringing, he glanced around the room to see if anyone had noticed. There were far too many people crowded around the huge mahogany table, but none of them were paying any attention whatsoever. Nat’s face was fixed in a blank, professional expression. Sam was making a heroic effort to look interested in the presentation, and Clint was clearly struggling to sit still. The cluster of blue-suited politicians squashed in between them were being varying degrees of rude – some were openly scrolling through their phones. But at least no one was looking at Steve.
Oh, God, this wasn’t fair-
didn’t know what to do for the best, at this exact moment. He didn’t know what to say.
Tony’s head swam – which, by now, was probably 90% excitement and 10% oxygen deprivation. But he stayed there, sucking and swallowing and pulling Steve in, wanting more of this, wanting
Unfortunately, right now, he didn’t have the choice. Apparently.
Using every ounce of resolve left in him, Tony lifted his head, and whispered,
“And why does Pepper think you’re missing your own party?” Steve asked, knowingly. Tony frowned for a second before he realised why Steve was asking.
, or whatever. I mean, I still haven’t worked out what it is or how it affects me or how much control I can have over it – and, yeah, I think it’s the reason I was…
By the time the peak came into view, Steve was ready to feel at least a mild tug of happiness that this much-dreaded task would soon be over with. He might even have felt tiny lift of relief, that this whole thing hadn’t been as crushing as he feared, that he wasn’t nearly as thrown by it as he was expecting-
answer…
“Do you think it’s wrong that… I really wish I knew which side she was on, before I made that choice?” Steve asked, eventually. Quietly.
...He had to start putting things into boxes.
Tony was right, this was nuts.
He could not let people defend him, or take responsibility for him, ever.
And… honestly, I think you’re over thinking this. You spent all this time worrying that your life wouldn’t fit a normal relationship, and how you found someone who does make sense in your life and you worry it isn’t normal… maybe stop borrowing trouble and look at what you’ve actually got?”
“Come for me.”
But Steve knew exactly what Bucky meant – and he knew, it was a

to be Steve Rogers. Tell Tony he’d been up all night thinking about this, and he still didn’t know what he thought, but he knew he was sorry and he just wanted to make this right.
So, apparently he’d decided to have a shower before facing Tony.
“Well, that’s just great,” he muttered to himself, before he turned to ask Tony…
“Steve?” Pepper called casually, breaking Steve out of his thoughts… He glanced up to see that he’d drifted a few feet ahead of the group, lost somewhere amongst this sea of flower stands.
The shape of him, the way he fit so perfectly against Steve’s chest…
Trying not to remember the way SHIELD had treated him, and how much that had hurt him, and how unfair it all was.

to get to Bucky-
Steve pulled Tony hard against his chest, one arm snaking tight around his waist, the other hand going to the back of Tony’s head, guiding him up into the kiss. He could feel Tony smiling against his mouth, warm and unhurried and playful, his fingers curling into the fabric of Steve’s t-shirt. Steve was momentarily overwhelmed by the abundance of it. How good this felt. How much he loved Tony. How much of Tony he had, right now. Steve pulled his arm tighter around him, indulging in the solid strength of him, the perfect shape of him. Stroking his other hand down over Tony’s neck, and the curve of his shoulder, and the sweep of his back, and all those other little details that he loved so much about him. Tony hummed softly, parting his lips and kissing Steve deeper, pressing his whole body against him. And then Steve felt Tony move, that slightest hint of friction shocking through him, forcing him to break away and gasp for air.
“I promise, you’re going to recover from this, and feel like yourself again, and be happy,” Steve says, carefully.
known what to do with his face – or his head, or his heart. There was just no way to process the hundreds of thousands of things that Steve had just unearthed, no way to rethink his whole entire life as quickly as Steve was just laying it all out for him. He couldn’t place or name or make sense of any of the emotions that were suddenly welling up in him-
“Pepper just flat-out writes most of my statements these days,” he went on, not sure if he was going against his every instinct or giving into them. “And, what’s really weird is, if I ever

So then Tony had tidied the kitchen, which had taken hardly any time at all, because he basically never used it. Most of his meals could be microwaved in the workshop…
really fucking annoying.
“I also feel pretty stupid for saying that everything special about you came out of a bottle” Tony commented, lightly. And Steve laughed, softly… and then there was a considered little pause…
He felt safe.
“How lovely to see you all!” He grinned, finally acknowledging the others. “I was actually just on my way to the main studio to look over the plans for this evening's showcase. If you’d like, I’d be very happy to give you a private tour of the-”
“I understand that you must be a little overwhelmed,” Scaramouche placated, “and, of course, you don’t yet know the prize you’ve been given - it’s natural. But you’ll have to trust me. When you
