Steve nodded.
“I don’t see Cap or Tony or anybody out in the lake,” he said. “Hopefully they’re back at camp…” Now they didn’t just have the monster to warn the team about, but Loki as well. Of the two, Loki was a lot more dangerous, Peter was sure.
Clint was cut off by an overly familiar figure stepping through the door.
Crap, Peter had forgotten all about the lake monster! With their luck, it would smell Clint’s blood and show up in minutes…
Standing at his side in her tiny gold string bikini, Lola seemed unbothered by the talk of magical weather-changing powers. It wouldn’t surprise Peter if she knew exactly who Thor was, since he was as well-known as any of the other Avengers.
“Well that went great,” Tony commented once Clint and Bruce had both gone. Taking a seat in the chair Bruce had been sitting in, he leaned back and sighed. This was probably the first time they’d spent more than one day in a row with Bruce as Bruce, and it was underscoring just how little they’d actually gotten to know the guy. That, and the comment from Bruce about exactly that.
“Wade’s gone,” Peter whispered, looking over at the merc’s empty sleeping bag beside them.
"Doom...? Victor von Doom?" Pepper didn't sound like she'd seen the man face to face like he had. Well, as close to a face as Doom had left.
Cap still didn't feel reassured that Tony would show back up, and sat watching the door expectantly. What was taking him so long?
On the TV screen, the credits had begun to roll. A dark silhouette of what looked like a toddler was shambling its way across a bedroom floor, giggling ominously.
“Careful, Wade, he’s bleeding again,” Peter said, looking back at Loki on the surface of the lake. That green glow sure had looked like his magic…
"No...that was just you." He sighed. "The one I saw last has an injury on his side, and the other one is new. He's extra aggressive."
"Yeah. The rain sucks," Clint mumbled sheepishly. "Look...look." He pulled Bruce's hand down and met his gaze. "Let's go home, sleep, warm up and then maybe we can...um...get sandwiches."
“Hey, I did NOT say sea monster! You assumed because I said monster and because I was going to the beach that it was a sea monster!”
So he suddenly found Clint interesting. He'd faced worse, right? He'd just have to come up with a reasonable plan to deal with it and follow that plan, like he dealt with every other problem.
"I think you're confusing me with the other guy, there, Barton." Bruce gave a small, wry smile, biting into a second donut.
“Wow, you’re…muddy,” Tony said, looking at him with a frown. “And bleeding. Peter!” The moment he sighted Steve and Peter walking up the hill from the lake, he seemed to completely forget about Clint, hopping up to hurry over to their sides. “You guys are coming from the lake! Tell me you didn’t find out Loki’s here the hard way.”
Hurrying over to look in the trunk too, Cap’s eye widened.
“We’re okay. Just a little bad weather.”
"Yeah." Clint nodded to her. "The whole 'fists of doom' thing."
“I wasn’t sure you even could swim.” They were alone? Like, for real? The thought made Clint’s stomach flutter a bit, but he just smiled. Thank GOD he didn’t give that tackle box back!
"Alas, there are not enough beds for all, but I will gladly give you mine." Thor's voice sounded over the storm, directed at his female friend no doubt, and as soon as Tony realized everybody could hear him he clammed up and fell silent.
The middle-aged guy in the driver's seat offered a noncommittal grunt and nodded for them to get into the vehicle. He hadn't even turned the engine off.
“You’re m-making sauce?” Wade asked, gawking at Cap. “You can buy that, you know? Like, ready to go!”
Bruce took the vial and carefully poured it into the glass he'd handed Cap before, which was empty at this point.
For some reason, the thought of Tony dating anybody seemed kind of wrong. As much notoriety as he had for being a playboy, Peter knew him as a super smart tech-obsessed...well, dad type. Maybe it was because he and Cap were like the parents of the Avengers. Peter almost laughed as he realized maybe Tony dating seemed wrong because he was already "married" to Steve, but then that idea sounded surprisingly reasonable and not like a big joke.
Clint unzipped his vest, taking it off and holding it over his head. It was soaking wet too.
"Stay here," the Hulk told Loki again before barreling after Hawkeye. "I heard about the shield—want me to SMASH it?"
She sighted Iron Man flying down toward the front door to the mansion. Not far away, Spider-Man was just hanging upside-down on a piece of web, observing them all.
"Alright." Clint said, getting up and dusting off his butt. The dungeon was horribly boring. No one was coming to save them and he had one last card up his sleeve. He waved around at the walls since he couldn't spot any cameras. "Hey Doom! Let’s talk!"
“How do I work this thing?” He asked, angry with himself that he hadn’t wanted to hang out with Bruce when it was obvious how lonely the guy was. One of the times he got to see Bruce last, the man had told him how being in Hulk's head all the time was really hard.
"Or we could just wait until the power comes back on," the other Hawkeye offered, holding his light arrow above his head to better light the room. "It’s not like we're starving or anything."
Tony groggily registered the sound of the bedroom door opening, and burrowed a little deeper into his hammock. Ugh, another day of playing professional, impartial co-leader with Steve, or at least a few more hours. He'd gone to bed intending to "sleep in" as long as possible in the hopes that Matt would leave and he could finally talk to Steve in private. The vacation had been so stressful so far, though, that Tony had tossed and turned (or maybe 'rocked and rolled' was a better term, because hammock) and fallen asleep in the small hours of the morning.
Aside from gritting his teeth, Loki didn't allow himself to react. He looked back up at Bruce again and forced a smile, feeling sweat forming on his forehead.
The scientist moved his hand away and sat up a little, looking up.
Wade let go of Peter and bolted back around to give Matt a hug, practically knocking the poor man’s sandwich from his hands in his enthusiasm.
Letting go of Peter, Cap gave him a quick smile and nod before continuing down the hallway at marching speed. It was his chance to corner Daredevil and figure out what exactly his intentions were with Peter. Arguing or not, he knew Tony would have his back.
Pepper stared, unsure how to respond. This man looked familiar...yes, she'd seen him on the news.
“Why do we keep doing this?” Steve asked, sounding like he was genuinely curious. “Every time we talk to each other, we fight over something. Models, alcohol, Peter. This is exactly WHY I tried to give you some distance. I don’t want to argue with you, Tony.”
Thinking all of this meant he just spent a VERY long moment looking up at Cap uncertainly.
"Tony, isn't t-there another way?" He asked dramatically. He looked as exhausted as Stark did.
Peter stuck out a hand and assured them all, "It'll be super fast, too—I know this great place! Er, but I'm gonna have to borrow your phone, and I'm kinda broke at the moment...eheh."
The Hulk looked at the car and then back to Clint. With a kind of growl under his breath, he scooped the blond up with one arm and turned, bounding off into the city with him.
A fight? Ahh, the perfect distraction. He turned to look at the Hulk.
"...Maybe you should check on Tony and Cap," Bruce suggested to Hawkeye, bandaging his hand hastily. Loki knew that getting Gamma-radiated blood into his wound would be idiotic—it would poison him. Bruce was a wise man.
"We j-just found him wandering around outside." He sucked in a rough breath. "He said he had been l-locked up in a w-warehouse for a few days.
A sudden kick knocked him away from Bruce's side, sending him rolling back to the couch. Loki recovered quickly, hopping to his feet just in time to dodge an arrow whizzing past his head. It was obvious who was shooting, but he only revealed himself after the first arrow missed.
Sunglasses would have been a good idea. Then again, if they both wore sunglasses, Clint wouldn’t be able to see Bruce’s eyes if they changed color.
"Eh." Deadpool waved a hand again. "Future stuff. Are his dads home too?"
“Absolutely, bu-sp-Peter!” Wade agreed loudly, spinning in place and heading off along the beach. Considering how well kept the beach was, he’d be lucky if he found driftwood.
"Hey!" Tony groaned and slumped against the wall where he sat on the floor. "Great, just great. Held prisoner by a power socket," he grumbled.
Loki pressed down against the couch like a scared cat. There wasn’t the slimmest chance in his mind that if Hulk discovered who he truly was, he would be smashed into the couch in seconds.
"You think I haven't thought of that?" Tony rolled his eyes, turning to focus on the road fully again. "My whole armory can run remotely. And this might be tough to hear, but the world doesn't revolve around the Big Apple. For all we know the next world-ending attack is gonna crop up in, I don't know, Australia!"
“Peter,” Matt mumbled, shifting on his feet and frowning down at the floor. “Between Wade or me, I promise you—Wade’s a better choice.” Tipping his head back up, Matt’s expression grew sad. “I’m not very good at relationships.”
Hawkeye watched the scene dubiously. Why hadn’t Loki turned back into himself? If he was unconscious, he should turn back, right?
Ducking around the counter, he peeked down the hall to make sure Peter wasn’t standing there before he headed over to Tony.
"The babies ate it, Clint."
"Finally!" Loki groaned. Hopefully not loud enough for the Hulk to hear. Carefully closing up the medical bag, he peeked out into the hall. A big green hand closed over his shoulders and pulled him out the door.
"Tell Bruce that this is for him." He leaned up and kissed the Hulk's cheek. Hey, it wasn't like he didn't already know...right? "Now come on, let's go make sure Thor's not being stupid. Again."
Okay, Bruce needed backup.
“I believe I am the least of your worries,” he said.
The demigod was frowning.
Bruce crossed his arms and gave the guy a long, critical look.
“Come on, Tony. Wake up.”
"Bruce!" Hawkeye spun, looking around at the bushes like something was about to jump on him. "Where are you? Are you okay?"
"Are you sure your injury doesn't need to be looked at again? You're wincing," the scientist said, stepping over closer to him again.
Rubbing his temple, Clint sighed. Sending Bruce to talk to Cap still made sense. The scientist was pretty easy to talk to.
Root beer, Clint observed, giving Bruce a quick, pointed glance. That was Cap’s drink of choice when he was having a bad day and wanted to remember better times.
"Likewise," Tony said with a flippant little salute. He dove through the opening in the shield and hovered in for a landing right next to the Hulk and Hawkeye. "Okay, let's all go back inside—you, too, green guy—and chill. Okay?"
“Holy shit!” The archer gasped from behind them.
“Before you do that,” Cap started, clearing his throat and looking at Tony. “We need to talk to you.”
But after almost a minute, the room remained dark. There was some rustling in the dark and then a glowing light as one of Hawkeye's arrowheads lit up.
Despite being so different, one unfortunate thing both of them had in common was a mountain of trust issues, too. Ouch. It was a wonder they’d allowed themselves to start dating each other in the first place. So much for Peter’s plans for their two-month anniversary once the weekend date things were done…
They stepped through some large wooden double doors and emerged into what appeared to be a very large, elaborate living room. There was a dining table and chairs on one side with a chandelier, a rather large piano tucked into one corner, cushioned chairs along the walls, and several impressive floor-to-ceiling windows with heavy green drapes around them.
“Sure, why not? We’ll be the anxious phone damsel duo,” he whispered back dryly. “I wanted to have a chat with him anyway.”
"I don't need a replacement," Tony said grumpily, sitting up with a wince. "Th-the reactor's levels...will even out." He leaned against Steve's shoulder, putting a hand on his chest. What had Steve been about to ask him, anyway?
Tony wiped soaked bangs out of one eye and squinted up at him.
"LOKI?" He stared at the injured man in front of him, wide-eyed. "Brother?"
With a curious look, Bruce handed him the sunscreen and turned around so Clint could reach his back.
"TRADE him?" Pepper looked up at him worriedly. "So HE doesn't want Thor, somebody has who he wants."
“You did hear Thor too, right?” He asked Wade uneasily in the slightest whisper possible.
"You're leaving?" The scientist looked after him worriedly. "Let us help you get back, at least—you're barely on your feet."
"He didn't...talk with you, did he?" The blond archer asked, lip curling slightly.
"Bruce? Uh, whatcha doing?" Maybe he had been right about Barton...
"Can we do that in my room?" Loki asked suggestively.
Tony stuck up a hand, not looking away from the computer screens.
"Don't you think the rest of the team will also wonder? You heard Peter, apparently it's obvious to the rest of the team that we're hardly on speaking terms right now. I'm not even sure how we got this way. Not important, though, you're right. If Peter's involved with that obviously-not-high schooler, we need to keep very close eyes on them."
Wow, he hadn’t even done his morning jog, Steve realized sadly.  Or his push ups. He’d have to do those after breakfast.
“Uh, yep. Good call,” he managed, nodding. Wow, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt flustered. All he really wanted was some time with Steve someplace where they didn’t have to hide their feelings. Damned Loki. Why did he have to even be here? What was his deal?
“I still plan on talking to him, don’t worry,” Steve assured him. “Before we all headed off to bed, I guess he went to Peter’s campsite and destroyed it. He smashed the tent under a tree and ruined Matt’s glasses and his cane—which he can’t really manage without. Peter’s been helping him get around.”
Clint Barton? Hawkeye? The most useless of the Avengers? Loki berated himself for not being able to think of his feet. He was, after all, wearing full armor in the blazing hot sun. The airy suit his persona was wearing was just an illusion.
"The Hudson? Is he flying to Jersey?" Bruce blinked, looking at the card.
"I need to see the arrow, too," Bruce murmured, holding out a hand for Clint to hand the syringe to him. He was still examining the injury and arrow on Loki. "What is it made out of, exactly?"
“Did you say ‘five’?” He feigned a sleepy indignant look, slowly sitting up and squinting at Steve. He could feel his hair sticking up sideways. He probably needed a shave after being out here in the woods for more than a day, and in all of the excitement yesterday, he’d never bothered to change out of his swim trunks, either.
"He was dying," Thor said grimly.
“You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope...I have loved none but you,” Wade read under his breath, staring at the book curiously. “Oh my gawd. Love spells!”
"About that." Turning to look up at the lights, Steve cringed. "Tony r-rigged his heart to p-power the mansion."
“Why don’t we all go down to the lake today?” Cap offered, tossing a worried look at Clint. “All of us.”
Reaching through the bars, Steve grabbed Tony's hand, shaking his head.
“Can you get the door?” Cap asked, shifting on his feet in front of the door to move Tony closer to the cabin.
"Nothing's undoable with Tony Stark on the case," Tony said confidently. "Er, any luck yet, Bruce?"
"Depends on which one," he answered Cap, patting his chest.
Carol cleared her throat.
“Wowza!” Wade knelt in front of Hawkeye. “Dude, you’re almost as angry as Wolvie! Oh hey! You’re bleeding like him too!”
"I'll talk to you later," he whispered to Clint out of the corner of his mouth, trying not to break the smile to do it. He turned and dashed back down to where Cap was making the sandcastle, adding in a normal volume, "Hey, sorry, Clint's just bleeding a little, that's all."
Steve chuckled, settling into the seat on Matt’s right.
"Hey, lean down here for a sec." Hawkeye grinned.
“Why the hell didn’t we bring hash browns?”
Sounding completely unconvinced of his own words, Cap bobbed under the water and came back up, swiping his hair back from his face.
A moment later, Bruce was lying there on his stomach on the beaten-up floor, surrounded by the crumpled papers from his research and wearing nothing but a lot of dust. He groaned and put an arm over his head.
“Well, aren’t we a sour puss.”
“Good idea,” Steve told him, letting go of Peter’s arm.
He looked around. The room was still pretty dim, so the brightest thing there was the blue glowing reactor in Tony’s chest. It was pretty amazing technology. Steve couldn't help but wonder what the 1940s could have been like with unlimited power. Probably even more explosive.
“A light source. That's handy.”
"He really isn't," Cap said, shaking his head. He’d slung an arm over Tony's shoulder for support. Tony helped Steve back over to the couch and sat him down there.
He took Matt’s hands and squeezed them, smiling sadly. “I think the only fair way to do this is to get it all out there—if I’m not hiding you, I shouldn’t be hiding Wade either. Cap and Tony are probably gonna flip just about me dating two people at once, never mind who they are, but I’m not ashamed of you guys and I’m gonna show you that.”
“Like pea soup,” Wade commented from beside him, also shielding his eyes to look out to sea. After a moment, he nodding emphatically. “I can’t see anything.”
Talking about Cap and Tony being gay didn't faze Bruce even slightly, yet he seemed completely oblivious to the concept that Clint might be interested in him. Was Clint just not even on his radar as an option...? Was Bruce's type Captain America?
Tony always had to keep an eye out for tabloid reporters recording things without his permission, and just on the off chance that any Avenger didn’t take the news that great, he’d hatched a plan to take the team somewhere remote where no cameras would be rolling.
"He jabbed the injured one right in the stitches," Bruce said drolly. How had Clint known he was actually talking about sandwiches back there?
"It’s on all the channels. Captain America and Hawkeye were both captured yesterday after helping with a bombing across the street from Stark Tower. We've been trying to track them, but the signal is completely blocked." She paced over to eye Clint. "Sorry. You can't be him."
Wade pressed another meat patty onto the cookie sheet and grinned, leaning to whisper in Peter’s ear.
Matt. That was Matt. Daredevil Matt, from the SHIELD database.
"Oh, hey," he told Cap conversationally, albeit rather faintly. He gave a small, suggestive grin and added, "C-can't keep your hands off me, huh?"
As soon as he arrived, Bruce handed him the stone he held, then stooped to pick up another.
Tony stepped over and looked inside quickly. Steve was laying against the far wall, looking feverish and asleep. Sitting beside him was Pepper. Off to the right was Clint, who jumped to his feet, leaning against the cell door.
"NO, you stuck your hand down my shirt and asked if I was storing a tire for a Harley in there," Peter replied, annoyed and also sounding like he might be referencing a sex joke.
"Great. From one creepy dungeon to another. At least you won't get grabby like Doom," he muttered, scowling at the floor.
“Hey, hey, I checked!”
“Back at you, handsome.”
“I thought this place wasn’t that popular,” Steve said, resting a hand on Tony’s back. “I suppose it’s a free country.”
The muscular blond man poked through the wires carefully.
"So you know I'm concerned and you just don't care," Bruce concluded flatly.
All business—if he acted too serious, Steve wouldn't be comforted, because Tony generally was only serious in the direst of circumstances. Sometimes not even then, if a good punchline presented itself.
Then there was the fact that Peter was there at all. They hadn’t planned on breaking the news about their engagement to him anytime soon. What would he think? He worked at the newspaper, he must have read all kinds of rumors about them. Cap had heard the kinds of nonsense that Jameson peddled…
As Wade chattered away, a glint of something in the dark caught Peter’s eye. It was that woman from before—Lola?—gathering up her stuff slowly while she watched Thor and the others talking.
Thor stepped forward and caught the other demigod in his arms, still quite startled.
Thor, quite touched, turned and gave Clint a rather crushing hug.
"I...don't know," Clint mumbled, quirking an eyebrow. "I never checked." He scooted a little closer, readjusting his arm to hold the vest over his head better. "You study that stuff all the time, don't you want to watch a show about something else? Like...I dunno, fishing?"
"Ugh..." Bruce groaned, leaning on Clint without any protest. "C-cure...right..." He shakily dug through his pockets one by one.
Cap led Matt to the fireside, helping him to sit on a chair before he turned his attention to Dr. Banner.
“A-and villains. It could be a villain,” he added quickly.
"God I hope so," the other man sighed sadly. He reached over, placing a hand on Bruce's shoulder. "We can't give up now!"
Clint was made of snark, Peter was practically their adopted kid, and Bruce’s opinion on two men getting married was a complete mystery to the Avengers since usually he was the Hulk. And Thor said he was keeping secrets from them! What could it be? Thor took sworn oaths very seriously, so there wasn’t much chance of convincing him to tattle…
"You okay?"
“Again,” Cap sighed, “you didn’t answer us.”
"Do I wanna know why you two are in here in your pajamas...with a pizza?"
“Tony?” Steve asked, muffled by the storm.
Deadpool glanced in the room, shaking his head.
“Last one back is a rotten egg!”
“What’re you talking about? That’s third degree murder,” Matt argued, frowning at Wade.
Loki stared at it. It had probably been centuries since he had actually bandaged anyone, but it was a better option than the Hulk. Rummaging through the bag timidly, he found a packet of gauze. Sighing, he dropped it back into the bag.
Surprisingly, the shouting actually worked. The door clanked open loudly across the room, and Doom came walking in with his green cloak billowing behind him.
"So, why don't you live in a normal house? Is this part of the whole 'evil master villain' thing?"
“Hey, do you know a Peter? Super hot? 18? Very flexible?” He heard the tall blond guy ask, excited. “I put a tracking device in his hot dog and this is where it said it was, so here I am!”
Groaning in frustration, Clint laid back across the desk, crossing his arms behind his head.
“With?” Wade asked, quirking a blond eyebrow. “Um,” he said slowly, looking them both over. Clint recognized that look—he was sizing them up. “We bros, my dudes,” the man laughed thinly. “You know, just bros!”
"Hey, Bruce!" Clint hopped onto a smashed up car to be at Hulk height. "I'm sorry about the—you know. The whole...Um." He scratched his head. "Look, did it really make you that mad? Come on buddy—let's talk about this!"
It might have been his first experience with blood loss in a couple centuries, but Loki was beginning to admire Stark. The sickly mortal obviously came up with a weapon that could hurt him. Leaning his head on Bruce's shoulder, he sighed. Now he had to find a way into Tony's lab. Perhaps Tony liked blonds too...
“Um, thank you, ma’am.”
Wade stared at Peter for a moment, then smashed his own meatball flat.
He slipped his hand into Matt’s and hopped to his feet, not letting go.
What was he supposed to say now? That had been way worse than Cap and Tony scolding him like usual.
"Knew it." Wolverine quirked his eyebrows at them, letting go of Deadpool.
“Clint, please put on some sunscreen!” Cap called after him quickly, concerned. He shook his head, waving a hand after Clint’s retreating back. “He always falls asleep and gets burned,” he sighed.
The scientist, surprisingly, managed to react in time to throw his arms around Loki rather than just getting squished by him. He did end up falling back against the couch seat, though, with Loki practically sitting on his lap.
Bruce in his birthday suit—not so much.
“Yeah, I agree — let’s turn around,” Tony heard Hawkeye complaining from the back seat. “I forgot my exploding arrows!”
“…I’m trying not to impose on Tony’s life anymore.” As the smaller man’s words sank in, he glanced back at Bruce, eyebrow quirked. “Wait, you think Tony’s attracted to another Avenger? Who?”
"You don't remember? Is t-there some way to have J-Jarvis do it?
Bruce or Pepper would probably be coming into the room any minute now.
"Wha? No." Deadpool replied quickly, shaking his head and leaning back a bit. "No clue."
Both Tony and Carol stared at him intently.
Apparently oblivious to that idea, Bruce shrugged and pulled off his T-shirt.
"Now I'll go get y-your reactor."
“We’ll bring it out with us.”
“Yeah, hopefully Wade doesn’t tell him to make it even worse,” Peter sighed, glancing down at the hand on his sleeve. He put a hand over it before starting slowly toward the cabin, keeping his voice low. “Hey, uh, you okay?” He didn’t want to be rude, but Matt was acting…well, blinder than usual. Not that Peter had any doubt he was actually blind, but his super senses usually helped him walk around just fine, even when it was raining.
"At least you had alcohol as an excuse. I was just trying to see if Cap was jealous or pressured at all to talk to Tony honestly before somebody else whisked him away," he explained. "But he just seems sad, honestly. I'm not sure he's the type to get jealous."
“Hey, I was about to go looking for you,” he said, trying to be good-natured about it. To say Wade had a short attention span was putting it lightly. He’d probably gotten distracted by something for most of his time away, then grabbed twigs on his way back because he remembered that’s why he left in the first place. Or something. “Think you can make a better s’more than me?”
Tony blinked and took sudden interest in the same data that had been on the computer screens for the past ten minutes, sipping at his glass.
Was it daylight yet? Captain America felt like he'd been sitting in the cell forever. He had awakened to find that the car and tunnel were gone, and he was in some kind of dungeon-like cell. Worse yet, somebody knew who they were going to be capturing, because the shackles chaining his wrists to the wall had resisted being snapped pretty well so far.
“Wow, you guys are already at ‘my love’ stage, huh?”
He was vaguely aware of Tony moving around the room, maybe gathering up some of the bits and pieces of stuff everywhere. Why was the medical room as much of a mess as Tony's workshop?
"Like I said before, I don't know where your motorcycle's at. Deadpool doesn't talk about stuff like that when he shows up, he rambles about Detroit and hot dogs."
Tony let go of his shoulder to point a finger at him, wide-eyed.
"Set up? I like it," Bruce said thoughtfully. He frowned and ran a hand through his hair absently. "We should rent kayaks for this. They have two-person tandem kayaks, so even to do the set up, Cap and Tony would have to paddle out there together."
“What in the world is going on out here?” Carol shouted above them. She hovered down through the shield, looking around at the sight below her.
Taking the hint, Peter placed his coffee mug aside carefully and stood. What a weirdly relaxed little coffee chat with a notorious super villain…
"Where. Is. She?!" Wolverine shook him again.
Peter had been worrying about Cap and Tony without even taking himself into account. Oh, no, were they just getting along this well even for his sake?
"So pizza helps fevers now? That's a thing?" Tony stepped inside and smiled wryly. "Wow, you look...just horrible. Hang tight, I'll bring the party to you instead."
“How about some coffee? You work at a newspaper, don’t tell me you don’t drink coffee,” Tony said, lifting the percolator off of the campfire. He’d gotten distracted by the conversations, and it was probably going to be some strong stuff. “Thor’s skipping it today, so there’s an extra cup in here.”
“Oh come on,” Loki said, annoyance clear as she stepped back closer. “I told you he knows. Thor, your scrawny companion is trying to warn you that I’m me. Tell them you know who I am so we can get back to…good times.” The black-haired woman added the last sweetly, a graceful hand playing with the wet tips of Thor’s hair.
"Huh?" Tony turned around quickly, blinking.
Bruce glanced up and down the street, very calmly. Lucky for them, the sun was starting to peek over the horizon, keeping the block from being plunged into the dark.
Peter stepped up and caught Matt’s hands in his, smiling brightly at him.
"Whoa," the teen said to himself.
Wade quickly followed him, dragging Matt after him. The redhead hadn’t managed to grab his sandwich.
"The other guy stepped on my bed, too," Bruce replied, by way of explanation. The floor in there was crunched to bits, but he was tired enough to even curl up and sleep on that if he had to. If Clint would let him crash on his bed, or even on his carpeted floor, that sounded a lot better.
Cap came back to sit a little plastic box full of spices on the counter, picking through them carefully while he read the recipe card.
Thor strolled back into the cabin, golden hair soaking wet and hanging down around his shoulders. He grinned and shouldered Mjolnir.
"Get off the table," Clint growled, shooing Spider-Man with a shaky hand. "Thor eats off that."
"Yeah, we don't even have any laser scorch marks this time!" Tony said brightly, kneeling down to let Steve climb off of his back. "Alright, ride's over unless you put in more quarters."
Steve turned to Thor, gesturing to Matt gingerly.
Loki vaguely hoped that he had more blood than a normal mortal, or he would have to agree that sleeping right now would probably end badly.
Peter's head was starting to ache. He couldn't just leave Wade with hero mentor parental units 1 and 2, though, so instead he circled around to try and talk to Cap. Preferably before he used Wade as spare firewood.
“…You have granola bars?” He asked, giving in and offering his arm to Spidey.
Cringing as his side throbbed, Loki groaned.
"If you were a robot you wouldn't be shaking like this. A robot wouldn't have...ah, drawn out the other guy yesterday." He coughed lightly.
"Let me know if you find Thor."
Bruce settled onto one end of the couch, leaning on a cushion and watching Clint put the movie into the player.
Bruce and Clint both looked up immediately.
Bruce stepped up next to him and fidgeted.
"Do not be so hasty! Perhaps Doom has done something to him," he pointed out.
“We’ll talk to him, Tony,” Cap agreed, resting a hand on his fiance’s shoulder and turning his attention back to Thor. “I’m sure Peter is being careful who he places his trust in.”
"Ah. Wait. They're magnetic. I keep forgetting." Cap groaned, shaking his head. "Whatever was in that bomb is still in my system. It must be strong. We'll have to wait for an opportunity to escape."
"Plus it's pitch black out there," Tony added a little too cheerfully.
“Alright, let’s take a break while I make dinner.”
“My intentions,” Matt echoed, examining a pair of jeans before standing back up to face Steve. The redhead just chuckled.
"Tony...?" Pepper shook his shoulder.
“Can I talk to you? Please?” Cap asked, frowning at him through the crack Clint had opened in the door.
“Get the hell out of the water!” Clint shouted, pulling an arrow from his back just before he plunged below the surface of the lake.
“If you’re here, where’s Peter? He was supposed to make sure that Thor didn’t wash Cap and Tony out to sea!”
The Asgardian was tilting his head, looking at them thoughtfully.
“Wait!” Loki called after him, but the man ducked into the shade of the mansion and was gone.
Unlike Tony, Cap wasn’t wearing sunglasses and it was very easy to see the sadness in his eyes. Slowly, he ran his fingers through his hair.
The demigod took a deep breath, thinking the idea over. Thor was in a relationship with that 'Jane' woman right now—would telling him that Clint had feelings for him mess with Doom's plan? That would be fun too. Mischief all around.
"Stop worrying about him. Jeez," Hawkeye said brightly, already in a better mood at seeing Thor. Cap would feel better once Tony was safely back in the mansion.
Matt shifted on his feet, obviously not really listening to Wade.
Bruce leaned back in his seat, checking that the gauze he held was still covering the arrow wound since he was now holding around Loki's waist.
Carol landed next to Thor.
The teen laughed, stepping into the kitchen.
He paused, dusting his own hair, and frowned. "...I'm really curious how we wound up like this if I didn't drink, though. I don't remember taking my clothes off. They're probably washed away in the ocean by now." That was punctuated by a heavy sigh.
"Great. The panel is sealed."
Tony blinked, waking up a bit from all of the talking near him suddenly.
He was lounging on a bright purple pool floatie. It was the fancy kind, with a padded headrest and drink holders built into the side. Settled across Loki’s lap was an old-looking book with a gold lettered title that read ‘Persuasion.’
"Or another robot," she pointed out. "I just don't get it. Why lead the Hulk peacefully back to his room? If it's really some kind of replacement Hawkeye, why not let the Hulk rampage around?"
Turning to Thor, Cap sighed.
"Jeez, where's Tony? I'm getting sick of me."
Turning back to look at them, Matt’s expression grew serious. Sad almost.
To the injured Clint, he said uneasily, "Y-you're the other fake? Why pretend to be Clint?"
"Whoa..." He webbed his way to a higher vantage, looking around quickly for the cause of the threat. His spider sense gave him a direction most of the time...
"No lasting damage has been done to any of them," Doom rephrased. Crossing his arms, he added pointedly, "Be grateful they are ALIVE after staying in Castle DOOM."
"Well, uh, it's no big deal. Forget I even asked," he said sheepishly. "How is Tony, anyway? I'm amazed he agreed to leave his tech behind for weeks!" Well, he assumed weeks.
"I think the ice helped it meld to my skin," Clint joked, before calling to Thor, "Got him! Let's get off of this mountain!"
“Ooh, ooh!” Wade vibrated with excitement, racing back to snatch the book out of Clint’s hands. He darted over, bowed and offered it to Loki. “Your book sucks. She totally leaves Wentworth.”
“Hold your own pack!”
"I think...I..." Loki started, leaning back against Hawkeye's shoulder, letting his eyes drift shut.
“Ah, not to my knowledge,” he said finally, snapping out of his thoughts. “I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were…” For some reason the word caught in his throat. “You…know. I had no idea.”
“I have the feeling my hunch earlier was right. Peter’s got himself mixed up in a love triangle.” Cap rubbed his forehead, exasperated.
"That's not good enough—who knows what will happen between now and then? I've been through torture before, I can handle it—"
"According to Tony, that won't work," Bruce replied, sitting the briefcase on the counter and glancing back at him. He waved for the blond to come over. "I need to look into why that is, but you're also the only other one exposed to the same batch of that gas as Captain America. Please, you might help us cure him."
“You’ll regret that, Rogers!” Loki spun on his heel and marched back into camp, wringing water from his long black hair and glaring daggers back over his shoulder at them.
"Ah, so it's not something that I did, it's something he did. Great." Clint sighed, rubbing his head. He scooted to the edge of the bed, sliding his feet down to the floor. Landing  gracefully, he leaned on the table for support.
"Brother, the illusion is no longer needed. Appear as you are—let me speak to your true face."
Hawkeye had shot one of his light arrows into the roof, giving the whole room a dim eerie light. Steve seemed to be dozing on the other side of the cough, eyes closed. Loki thought he looked so peaceful—until the Hulk's footsteps came closer. The fake archer looked at them, frowning unhappily. He knew he looked tired and pale.
"That old guy needs to come with me so I can impress Spidey's dad. Then me and him can become friends—play baseball together, golf and then Spidey and me'll get hitched, buy a house, and have two and a half kids—and half a dog." Deadpool paused in his long winded explanation. "I think that's how it goes..."
"Well...no, it's fine." Bruce shrugged, turning his attention to the elevator number light.
“Yes?” Came a female voice. Whether it belonged to Jan or to Lola, he wasn’t sure. The rain was thundering on the roof, even in here. He could barely make out footsteps approaching the door, but it didn’t open.
Peter took a big bite of the s'more and considered how to answer the question. "It's complicated. I can't just tell people about him or go around school together or anything," he admitted, looking at Cap worriedly. On a scale of one to ten, how overprotective would Cap be if he heard who exactly Peter was alluding to? Based on the worried look on the blond's face just hearing Peter was nervous, the answer was 'eleven'.
“Oww,” Peter managed, muffled. The Spidey Sense wasn’t tingling anymore except faintly in the direction of Loki. Forgetting all about his civvie clothing, Peter crawled right over Wade’s shoulder to perch on his back and peek down into the water. “…Hawkeye?”
"Matt says Wade's a 'notorious troublemaker', Peter," Tony said, looking at him expectantly.
Wade leaned against him, eyes squinting from a wide smile.
"Welcome," Tony replied, smiling wearily. "I-if you're up to it, I could use that new reactor now."
He, Loki, God of Lies, was bleeding. Actually bleeding. Not much could harm him, especially not mortal weapons. Had Stark really found a way to injure him? This was far more serious than Doom's plans. He had to destroy Tony's research before it was used on HIM. Slowly, he turned around back to Bruce. Maybe a bandage wasn’t such a bad idea.
Wade still referred to Steve and Tony as Peter's dads, Tony noted with a pang of regret. Maybe he'd screwed it up. Maybe if he'd done things differently, Steve might have been interested somehow, or at least wouldn't have gone out of his way to say how they definitely were not together. Tony thought they were pretty compatible, if they could just have a few minutes ALONE to actually talk about things. Maybe tomorrow when everybody else went outside and Daredevil was safely on his way back to New York, or something.
Without any other comment, Steve turned and disappeared down the hallway. Clint quickly shut the door behind him and turned to Bruce.
Pepper looked at him and tried not to wince again too noticeably.
At least Bruce was probably immune to cancer.
“This is camping, let us dine on those ‘granola bars’ you told me of yesterday and walk at the same time,” Thor suggested, stepping toward the trail. “Come, the sun will soon rise over the trees!”
Thor frowned and wrapped Loki protectively in his cloak.
"It's really pretty cool," Peter added hastily. "They've got a STEM academy that looks awesome."
Growling at his attacker and treading water, he looked around for Bruce. At least he couldn’t drown.
"I'm...okay," the man managed, coughing himself. "But I'm stuck. I-it was just a parcel...damn thing blew up." The explosion appeared to have come from this room—the walls were blackened, and the man was half-buried under his own desk. There were papers everywhere, licked in flames.
“Thor, you know who this is, right?” Matt interrupted, pointing in Loki’s direction.
Peter was about to open his mouth and just explain the actual situation when a drop of blood fell from the arrow in Wade’s chest and landed on the ground.
Staring back at Tony, Steve couldn’t stop himself looking sad. Dark circles appeared around his feet on the beach as rain began to fall.
Cap started off down the beach at a brisk pace. Okay, he was practically jogging. He didn’t slow his pace at all as he charged up the stone stairs to their cabin.
Rather than sitting Steve on the couch, Thor went past the living room and headed for the medical room, where Bruce was still supposedly working on Steve's cure.
Giving him a frown, Steve got up and stepped close to talk quietly.
“So, uh, how’d you guys manage in all that weather out there?” Peter asked as casually as he could. “I think I saw you get to the sandbar before the fog rolled in.”
As if it had heard him, the shark zoomed in and nudged at the back of the kayak again, making it wobble. The sleek shape looked at least six feet long.
Peter stepped back over, frowning worriedly at Cap before turning to Matt again.
“I saw it!” Clint insisted, scowling down at the lake. “It was huge! I gotta tell the others.”
Apparently finished with whatever mixing he was going to do, Doom headed to the kitchen area and poured the beaker's contents into a large golden goblet. How vampirish of him. Cap had to wonder if the metal cup would shock him when Doom handed it to him. The masked man was offering it to him now, so he was about to find out if he accepted it.
"Brother?" Thor leaned to look at Loki's face, seeing that he was fading. "Loki...?" He patted the pale man's cheek. "Do not slumber now, it is not safe for you."
"You okay? Need something?" Tony was over by his side almost before Steve could look for him, offering a glass of water. "Try not to talk TOO much, or your throat's going to be sore later."
"It will, brother, now that I have bound it. Is there anything that I may do to make you more at ease?"
There was the familiar metallic sound of Mjolnir singing through the air, and then Thor had descended upon all of them in a swish of red cloak.
"Johnny, how're things?" Peter tossed a little two-fingered salute at the Human Torch and grinned behind his mask. Johnny Storm was the youngest member of the Fantastic Four, and one of the few heroes he related this well to. Of course, Johnny was also his polar opposite in society—a girl magnet with a devil-may-care attitude, cool hair and a huge horde of fans. That sounded kinda nice...
Ducking across the kitchen, Cap grabbed frozen patties from the freezer and an armload of condiments from the actual fridge before he shut the door.
"Wow. Yikes. I almost feel bad for you, there, fake me."
The Human Torch slid off of the couch, sitting down next to Peter.
"Your wound is dire indeed." Thor sighed, sitting back from tending his brother’s wounds.
"Don't worry, I'll hold you tight." He leaned in closely. "REEEAAL tight."
Peter snorted and shook his head. Yeah, because BOMBS were the thing a guy with claws built into his hands would use to attack somebody.
Oh, and Cap and Tony might be lost at sea by now.
The scientist cleared his throat and hastily averted his eyes to the nearest bright point of color—a fire hydrant, as it turned out. He stared at it for an uncomfortably long moment before sighing and slumping in his seat, covering his face with one hand.
Bruce popped up beside him, shaggy brown hair hanging in his eyes and his white T-shirt practically transparent plastered to his chest.
"Oh thank god. Can I go back to my cell now?" Clint deflated in relief.
"I dunno—I stole it from your lab."
"H-hey, I know it's technology and I shouldn't have it here right now, but I brought my phone," Peter confessed to Cap and Tony quickly, pulling the phone out. "Could we take a vacation pic together, the three of us? Maybe with the sandcastle once it's done!"
He felt a sudden grip on one of his hands.
Doom looked up and tilted his head just a little.
If Peter had come here straight from the bed, then whatever clumsy person had ran away from the kitchen earlier was somebody else. Hawkeye was a likely candidate.
The moment their lips brushed, a loud shout echoed across the lake. No, it wasn’t a shout. It was a laugh.
The sinister laugh that he got in response echoed off of the high ceiling somewhat, and then Doom circled around the bed to tower over his side, crossing his arms. Clint had to admit, the cold metal mask made it look like he was being held captive by a robot of some sort.
Pepper sighed.
So, his brother had yet to master the use of cell phones. Not critical information, but interesting all the same.
“Is he insane?” Peter pulled himself free of Wade’s grasp, turning back and sending webs shooting into the water after Clint. “What’s he gonna do, arrow it to death from the inside-out?” His webs caught on something, but the lake was too murky to see what. Figuring that either Clint or the monster was just as good because they’d be separated from each other, Peter turned and swam for the shore, doing his best to drag his catch along with him.
Abandoning the blankets and scrambling to the opposite side of the bed that Bruce was on, Clint smoothed his hair and called nervously, "Yeah?"
"This...is not...one of my arrows." He looked accusingly up at Hawkeye, who had returned to the edge of the couch with a needle in hand.
Annnd now Tony was wishing he'd packed more explosives into that Arc reactor.
"It might affect Clint worse," Bruce offered quietly from the computer console. "Maybe. It's obviously tailored for Captain America, though."
Sneaking through the rain, side by side with Tony, Steve tried not to worry about the rest of the team. If he and Tony were going to get the drop on Loki, they had to be focused. Alert, stealthy—
"Okay," Peter said, feeling bad for him. He wasn’t even actually dating, not officially. What relationship he had was actually going pretty good, but now it was one more thing Cap had to worry over. "Just to clarify, though. I'm not ashamed of him. It's not that. That really would be horrible of me!"
Well, wasn’t that terribly romantic, Loki thought, smirking to himself. Those two had to be lovers.
“Here,” Hawkeye said, offering Tony a plastic cup. The archer had sloppily dumped a lime soda in there along with what looked like a couple of shots of tequila. He wasn’t measuring.
Matt, Matt, Matt, he repeated quickly, trying to get through to his tired brain.
Peter gave Matt and the lady a sideways look, uncomfortable with the way they were smiling at each other. It wasn’t like he was actually dating Matt or anything, but Lola was a beautiful goddess of a woman and he was…well, Peter Parker.
Pressing a hand to his head, Cap wasn’t sure what to think.
Dropping a slice of butter on top, Steve criss-crossed syrup over the waffle and spooned a blob of whipped cream on it for good measure. Staring at it, he added blueberries and a strawberry. Now it was red, white and blue. Huh.
Hurrying around the couch, Hawkeye offered him a hand up.
"That's true. At least I got him to come back here." The blond gestured around the room with his eyes, keeping his arms hugged to his sides. "Man, I’m glad Hulk really likes his nap time."
“Can’t believe what?” Clint asked, sliding his hands down to hold Bruce’s. Just to help him keep his balance. His hair was hanging in his eyes, but fixing it meant letting go of the scientist’s hands.
"It's a good start," Tony told him pleasantly. Apparently Deadpool had a thing for Spider-Man, so he must have figured he'd use it to his advantage since the crazy guy somehow thought of HIM as Peter's "dad".
"Pulse is elevated—that's normal for someone who's lost so much blood, though. We can't just leave him this way."
Tony shrugged and positioned the needle against his arm again.
Gently leaning her forward to look at her back, Cap sighed.
But now Peter wasn’t answering his phone.
The scientist knelt down and picked the blanket up, putting it back around Clint's shoulders nonchalantly, and even patting his back.
"Don't you think it's weird? The needle bent, so, he's the fake and we should throw him in prison," he pointed out, gesturing to Loki.
"Er." He picked the glass back up and toasted it in the air. "To s-science."
“Mandatory relaxation.” The blond sighed, staring off into the sky. There were lots of puffy white clouds far off on the horizon, drifting along slowly like they didn’t have a care in the world. There was even a big gray one in there, but none of the other clouds minded.
"I-I'm not sure?" He whispered back, feeling shy all of a sudden. "You mean like actual dating, or just somebody you think about all the time, and worry about, and eat lunch with every day?" The latter was Wade, in a nutshell. Except for... "A-and maybe wanna kiss and...stuff?" He amended with a tiny, nervous laugh.
Tony didn’t want to leave Steve here, but getting Clint and Pepper out was a step in the right direction. The only other real option was to leave them ALL there and go get an Arc reactor.
Bruce rotated in place, facing out toward the beach.
Then his eyes landed on a familiar pair of red lensed sunglasses.
Bruce stood beside the Clint he'd arrived with. He had to admit, the other one looked and sounded exactly like Clint, too. If he was a copy, somebody had outdone themselves. One of them had to be a copy, though—they couldn't both be real.
Watching the moss more intensely, he cleared his throat.
Sooner or later, Clint would find it and give it back, so he figured that he’d better enjoy his time with Bruce while he had it.
"More needles?"
Peter watched her go, trying really hard not to notice how tiny that bikini was from every angle. He cleared his throat and headed around the frisbee group toward the bonfire. Tony was there with Clint, and he could see Bruce returning to the fire from down the beach, Cap trailing far after him with a pensive look on his face. Seriously, vacation didn't look like much fun to either of the Avengers' co-leaders.
“If swimming’s the plan, then I’m gonna go change into my trunks,” he said, stretching and yawning again. Getting up and moving around would probably help him wake up better than sitting there. He’d carry his coffee down the lake trail with him.
"You were in my lab? Wow, Jarvis, thanks for the great security system," Tony grumbled.
From his perspective, that guy was the obvious fake. It made sense for him to be making weird faces when he was about to be discovered. Clint happily realized that he would be sleeping in his own bed soon enough…maybe even with Bruce.
Oh, had Loki used his actual strength that time? Oops, how clumsy of him.
Suspiciously, the Hulk leaned down and looked him in the eye.
“I’ll go grab dinner, then maybe we can play some more cards?”
The Hulk probably would have scared the fancy campers across the lake, anyways.
He got a hearty laugh in return.
Those huge crazy eyes turned from them to stare down the beach. Clint could swear he saw the man’s ears perk up as he dodged past them and took off down the beach at a full sprint.
"Well. It's just that, uh." Clint gestured around the room. "Your lab's a mess. My room's just up the hall." He jerked a thumb in the direction—dropping his blanket.
"A show about weapons?" Bruce blinked. "That could be interesting, although I'm more partial to radiation studies. Any TV shows about that?"
"The tough part is going to be making them think this was their idea so they don't suspect we have something planned," Bruce said, glancing up at Clint. He frowned thoughtfully. "Especially since we can't say we saw it on a website or something with no technology here."
Pepper nodded.
Starting back down the trail, Clint only made it a few feet before Wade caught his arm and hauled him to the side of the path.
"He's the fake!" PJ Clint pointed accusingly, spotting the now bent needle as Tony lifted it up to examine it.
"Clint?" He asked.
“If you have a concern about a teammate or ally, come to us first,” he told Bruce, thinly covered anger in his voice.
Frowning all over again, Cap watched as the cup slid from the table and landed in the dirt with a loud thunk.
"The mansion?" The archer grumbled, glancing around. Hearing Cap cough again, he raised an eyebrow at him. "You okay, there?
Peter sat up quickly, reaching to catch his shoulder.
The lake was absolutely beautiful. The sun was peeking through the trees, its soft rays of light sparkling over the surface of the water.
"As if you could keep me here."
“Like you said, Wade seems to be trying.” Catching the kid’s arm, Cap led him quickly after Daredevil. If the man needed fresh clothes, he’d have to go into Cap and Tony’s room.
"It's alright J-Jarvis. I'll t-take him." Steve gently grabbed Tony's arm. "Would you...?"
Tony stared down at the newspaper, paling a shade as Steve flipped the pages. The muscular blond gave him an encouraging pat on the shoulder and stepped back.
There was a pause, which Clint was almost certain was time for the Hulk to add commentary inside Bruce's head, and Bruce added drolly, "He's not so excited about my evening plans, either."
Peter was both relieved they didn’t have to creep around in the trees anymore and dreading the inevitable conversation about why he was out here alone in the woods with Wade. Maybe if he asked REALLY nicely, Clint and Bruce wouldn’t mention it?
Peter had vaguely noticed Hawkeye and Dr. Banner arriving back during his story, mostly because when they opened the door the rain had been really loud. He had to wonder where Bruce was now. Taking a nap, maybe?
Thor glanced after the scientist and frowned slightly.
The moment the three of them got out of earshot of the Avengers, Matt and Wade had started to bicker.
“I’m a futurist, but I never wanted to think about my own. Never saw anything good that way—figured I’d better do the good I could right now, before it all went downhill someday. God that sounds depressing!” He laughed sardonically, running a hand through his soaked hair. Was it just him, or was the storm a little quieter now? He was glad Steve could hear what he was saying without having to shout, but maybe it was all in his head. One of those ‘time went slow-mo’ moments like they had in the movies.
"Ah..." Bruce tugged the vest a little higher around his waist, glancing around for some sign of a blanket or other more substantial piece of cloth. "It's not...that. Um. Could you get some of my clothes from the dresser?" He nodded across the room.
Concerned by how the King of Wakanda might perceive his shouted conversation, Clint cleared his throat loudly.
"Pepper? Oh, yeah, she'll be back to one hundred percent in no time," Tony said, sounding surprised he was asking such things. "This gas bomb thing was just aimed at you—it affects super soldiers, anybody else just has coughing fits."
"Maybe I'd better get yours first--you missed a few spots," he said, and sounded like he was trying not to laugh. The missed spots must be pretty big.
"I know that these are not the best of circumstances, but it is good to see you again, brother," he said sincerely.
"Hey, wait! You can barely walk," Tony protested, reaching after him. He couldn't really move away from the wiring, though, or the power would all go out.
"I think we're lost." Bruce glanced up and down the beach. "Maybe we should write SOS in the sand with a stick," he suggested, deadpan.
Clearing his throat, Tony slapped his hand down just like before.
Squeezing Steve’s hands, he automatically smiled to mask his inner bewilderment. He’d been so sure he was about to get rejected, so ready to try and scrub that hopeful future side by side from his mind, and this…was a lot.
"I-I know," Bruce said, trying to be dismissive. He didn't manage to keep the glumness out of his voice, though. "It was just to get the Hulk to come out. Well, you win..." He blinked and looked around at the mess his office had become. "...My papers..."
"I may not be a medical doctor, but I'm not that much of a hack either," Bruce mumbled. He gently felt around the wound again. "How's that?"
The captain went along, climbing to his feet. He stood up slowly, taking time to stretch his back. Hey, at his age, he couldn't be too careful. His throat hurt so badly now, Doom could do whatever he wanted as long as he gave him a glass of water first.
"We shall find him, friend! And I will keep most careful vigil over Hawkeye," he added to Tony solemnly.
The stairwell was plunged into darkness save for a few shards of blue light that escaped between Steve's fingers. Tony leaned heavily on his shoulder.
Out of the blue, Steve splashed and sank for a second, bobbing back to the surface only to spit out water and gawk at Tony.
"Th-that...what was that? Why did you do that...?"
"That's not me!"
Who else would they hook a heart monitor to...? Groaning a little, the scientist slowly sat up and squinted around the room, trying to get his bearings. That's right...Clint...bedroom...wait, why were they in the BED, though?
"This is awesome," Peter declared, holding up the phone to show him and Steve the picture. They looked like a happy family, smiling in the sun with their sandcastle and Tony's shades reflecting the beautiful beach view opposite them. Tony had sneaked an arm over to rest on Steve's shoulder for the picture, and had been met with no resistance.
Maybe the Hulk didn’t recognize him out of his regular outfit? Spidey pondered as he swung.
"I-I thought he was attacking Bruce!"
Bruce let go enough to peek at the puncture mark, then pressed on it again carefully.
“I’m not gonna jump you, jeez!”
“Shouldn’t we bring the molotovs that I don’t have with me?” Deadpool whispered, his voice muffled by the laughter coming from the other fire.
"Uh." Clint glanced down at his bare chest. "No. He just, uh, wanted to talk."
"Well, here on Midgard it’s mostly between COUPLES."
Peter stepped out in front of Loki and turned to the others, holding up his hands.
“Are you alright?” Remembering that they had a civilian with them, Cap lowered his voice.  “Has Thor told you about Loki?”
Peter gave a little chuckle, feeling strangely relieved he didn’t have to keep up that particular lie.
“Ah, of course.” The muscular blond slung an arm around Tony's waist, half dragging him to the door.
"He's a big demigod, he can take care of himself," Tony added, still keeping an eye on Cap while trying not to seem like it. "Bruce, is it true what the Hulk said? That you can't make Cap a cure, and we need to get it from Doom?"
For as long as Clint knew the scientist, physical contact was a big no-no for him. Any unexpected contact had the potential to summon the Hulk and therefore, all the Avengers tried not to touch Bruce. Ever.
With a firm nod, Steve turned to find a needle. Hawkeye pointed the small needle case out for him, and he returned to Tony’s bedside shortly with a syringe at the ready.
"Over here!" A female voice shouted raggedly.
Staring back at the moss, Clint felt his jaw tighten.
That was too close to a whisper for Clint and he just managed a nod before he started down the steps to the beach.
Tony snorted.
"Er...yeah," Bruce replied, distracted. Without any street lights, it was pretty dark under the vest.
‘Us.’
Maybe that’s what he was trying for, here. Not success, but resignation, if success wasn’t an option. It all depended on Steve.
Still frowning, Steve bent and rummaged in the cooler for a moment.
Criminally, Cap slipped from bed to get dressed. Putting on jeans and a plain blue tee, he sat back down to pull on his boots.
As the pants he had been holding dropped to the floor, Cap couldn’t keep his mouth from hanging open. Did the reporters have any humanity left?
“Language!” Wade said loudly, glancing back at Hawkeye. “You know Cap—”
Yawning, Tony hugged the blanket against his chest and looked up at the ceiling in the dark. Once they figured out what was going on with Peter, Steve would go right back to being distant--he was sure of it. So much for spending time together on vacation.
"...You, ah...you startled me," he said quietly.
"It's not for dating advice," Bruce said, glancing at him. He frowned and looked back ahead of them again. "At least, I don't think so. That's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm not present as me very often, and you know this team probably the best of anybody, Cap."
She paused for a moment, reflecting on that. "I think he needs you to save him from himself," she muttered, aiming the flashlight around the hall to look at the floor and ceiling. There was a huge hole in the ceiling...
"It's pretty good," he added, apparently realizing he'd never really answered Clint's question.
“It’s alright,” Clint told him, though he still took one of the offered hands. As he climbed up, he tried not to actually put too much weight on Bruce’s hand. The guy was built like a stick.
“I know you don’t have a thing for Tony,” Cap told Clint pointedly. “And you two have been sneaking around and avoiding the group all day. I saw you holding hands,” he explained, rubbing his forehead. “Look. I know I’m being invasive. I apologize for that, but if you…do anything to increase your heart rate, you’re ruining everyone’s vacation. So please, for everyone’s sake, can you keep it G-rated?”
“I don’t know what game you’re playing at here, Tony, but I don’t appreciate it. I know Bruce shouldn’t be with anyone—of course not, his transformation is tied to his pulse!” Cap poked a finger at Tony’s shoulder and dropped his voice even softer. “We ARE the leaders of this team and we have a responsibility to be professional and focused, all personal feelings aside.”
He couldn't remember the last time he'd had a piggyback ride, but it was a very long time ago. It was strangely nostalgic even though he had no idea where the nostalgia was coming from, and he turned his head to one side, resting a cheek heavily against Steve's hair.
"You will stay here until you prove useful," Doom grumbled, "Or until I tire of you." With that he stalked off into the shadows, his cloak swishing out behind him.
Rubbing his neck, Steve started picking suitcases and stuffed tote bags out of the trunk.
“Peter, I’ve been in love—oh, Tony, I’ve been in love with him…” Cap trailed off, his mind swirling. He rubbed his forehead. “I think we should just play frisbee. I’ll work on this later.”
"I'm not a MEDICAL doctor," Bruce said as he was hauled over to the computer display, sounding bewildered. They were in the medical room and all.
The Clint next to Bruce paused abruptly, eying his double. The other froze up too. Both stared at each other and then Tony—pointing at the other and shouting in unison.
Thor carefully unwrapped the cape from around Cap. It was soaking wet, and probably just making him cold.
"But we're out in the open," Peter said, gesturing around them.
“It must be nice to get away from things for awhile. What brought you out here? The Avengers?” Suddenly more animated, Loki flashed him a smile. “Are you trying to get a compromising picture of Stark and Rogers? Shouldn’t be that hard.”
Whether Peter was lying about being eighteen or not, there was no way the three of them were dating. Not a snowball’s chance in hell, in Clint’s opinion.
"I'm the real one—the one with Cap is the fake." He patted Thor's huge arm. "Can you help me find Bruce? He Hulked out and ran off into the mountains again."
"Right," Bruce said, all business. "Subtle sabotage, then. Maybe we could send them way out into the ocean on a jet ski and barely put any gas in it."
"He-ey Spider-Man!" Came an overly chipper voice from overhead. Johnny Storm blazed past above him, droplets of rain sizzling in the air as they evaporated on his fiery aura. The man flew a circle around Spider-Man in the blink of an eye, grinning happily as he drifted to Peter’s side. "How's it hanging?"
Giggling, Lola stepped away from Matt.
Watching the two tall people with the gorgeous hair head off down the beach, Bruce sighed and shook his head.
"Oh, that's...don't worry about it. It's fine, I'm not angry." That last was said with a small bitter smile. As if Clint wouldn't know if he was angry...
"No hard feelings here," Peter assured him, picking up the last bite of his forgotten s'more and popping it into his mouth. "It's wrong to out somebody without their permission, so that's fair. I-I guess I'm just surprised I never noticed." He turned to Cap seriously. "Do YOU need any advice? Like, if one of the gay Avengers is you, I won't tell anybody, but I'm pretty sure in the 1940s the only advice you'd get for that is 'don't be gay', so..." He smiled sheepishly. "I guess, what's a guy like me gonna be able to say that'll help out Captain America, anyway..."
"You won't get away with this!" He yelled at them. Thor would help him...no wait. He wasn't actually Hawkeye. Suddenly pausing in his struggling to look around, Loki blinked as his thoughts cleared.
The Hulk was silent for a moment.
The damned weather and tropical setting were gorgeous, and Cap was right at home in them--effortlessly breathtaking. Tony was still trying to think how to start a conversation with him about them. He had to sooner or later—this was his only chance—but talking about other things was supposed to be the lead up.
"Um. Let me run that by Tony—you guys are evil clones, right?"
"Really? My nose?" The other snorted.
Peter put his hands in his pockets, shifting from one foot to the other. He took a deep breath, trying to muster up the guts to pile more lies onto this dumb lie-filled situation, and he just couldn't do it. Cap and Tony had already seemed really sad and bothered by something before Peter brought his concerns in to worry them even more.
"Is Cap okay?" Sitting down and staring up at him, Loki sighed.
The rain had let up for awhile, turning to a light sprinkle. Clint held around Thor's neck, scanning the forest below them as they went.
“Nap spots,” Clint told him, pretending like it was the most obvious answer. Inwardly, he was trying to repress the flushing his face was trying to do. He wasn’t going to be some red-faced idiot. Hawkeye would be his naturally charming self and see how far that got him when he pointed it at Bruce.
The captain was more than happy to get away from the bonfire for a moment. Watching Tony smirking and chatting across the way was really starting to bother him.
Tony shot Cap a look that said ‘rain check on that return kiss’ and straightened up, turning to Clint.
“What?” He coughed, paddling back up to Tony. “No. Tony… No. Peter isn’t… There’s no way he’d…” The blond seemed to be struggling with the idea, barely staying above water as a parade of emotions passed over his face. At last, he scowled. “You’re wrong.”
In view on either side of the lot sat two mirror cabins atop small man-made plateaus. Each had a dark blue exterior, a white A-frame rooftop, and matching white framed porthole windows overlooking a carefully sculpted set of stone steps.
"Hey, don't forget to hold onto me!" Peter realized uncomfortably right after saying this that Deadpool WAS still holding around his waist pretty tight—with his legs.
“Here, Stark—kindling,” the demigod said cheerfully, dropping the shards on the ground in front of Tony. The billionaire would have called him a show-off, but he was too busy trying not to think about how Steve could do that exact same thing. Big strong blond guys were apparently now his type.
Peter snorted and shook his shoulder to try and dislodge Deadpool like he was an annoying bug or something. This wasn't good—Aunt May couldn't meet Deadpool. She could NOT.
"SPIDEY! What the hell, dude? I've been waiting up here ALL. NIGHT. What were you doing in there? Inventing sliced cheese?!" Before Peter could respond, Deadpool threw his arms around him. "I was so cold!" He bawled dramatically.
Tony ducked and stepped into the tent after him, and the sound of the rain went from outside pattering on leaves to nonstop muffled thumps as heavy drops landed on the tent fabric.
He heard Clint laugh.
As soon as it was behind the tent, Wade stepped over to Peter to take both of his hands, holding them tightly.
There was absolutely no response from Matt.
"Do we even know if that's still happening? Maybe it wore off."
Maybe the lack of fishing or science was annoying him? Either that, or Hawkeye was. Ouch.
Matt stepped between them, shaking his head. Bumping into Peter’s arm, he smiled gingerly.
The pain surprised the Jotun enough that he gasped. The arrow had actually broken skin. Stepping back, he gawked at his hand as it came away from his ribs coated in blood. When was the last time that had happened?
“Wow, never thought we’d run into you all the way out here,” Clint commented, staring at Loki curiously.
Looking worried, Cap held up a hand.
Steve listened for any sounds of where they might be. Rain? No. Traffic? None. They were probably underground somewhere.
"Wo-ah, Cap. No you're not." Hawkeye stepped in, placing both hands on Steve's chest. "You can barely breathe. Besides, Tony would tell us if he got into trouble. He's smart like that."
Tony cleared his throat loudly and went right back to drinking the coffee once he wasn't coughing anymore.
"At least when the bad guys use science as a weapon, you can always science your way back out of it," Bruce said, nodding. "I mean, scientific things can be recreated. Well, most of them, anyway."
"How are YOU, Bruce? You look like you haven't slept in awhile."
"Oh. THAT. I'll...buy you a new one."
“Okay,” Clint said, trying to process all that information.
Bruce placed the case on the floor and opened it, pulling out gauze pads and a few other items.
Peter heard Cap chuckle and looked back just in time to see the big blond pat Tony’s back as he left.
Neither would Cap.
“What?” Matt asked, taking another bite from his sandwich.
"Clint, I need to examine you. Come on, it won't take long."
"Just worried about Tony." He nodded slowly. "Look, maybe now's not the best time to go stomping around. You know, with the storm taking out the lights and everything." The small man gestured up at the ceiling. "You might step on someone."
The merc launched himself onto Peter.
Thor was already starting his way, looking quite alarmed.
"Right. Sure, I can do that."
“I am not an Asgardian, no,” Lola said at last, sighing and tossing her hair back over her shoulder. “And as Thor already knows who and what I am, I don’t think it’s any concern of yours.”
“Oh?” Daredevil asked, cocking his head curiously. “I can hear him talking from here.”
"Unless I use YOU," Doom said, looking him over as if considering. "Perhaps he will come to your aid."
"I'm fine, but Doctor Doom just took Hawkeye away!" Pepper sounded very worried for him.
There was a groan from somewhere off in the underbrush, and then some rustling of leaves and branches.
After Bruce took a quick blood sample with one of Tony’s specialized ‘Cap-functional’ needles, Steve shook his head.
He closed his eyes and swayed on the line of webbing, rotating in a slow circle. So his boyfriends were now barely on speaking terms with each other, his superpowered sorta-dads both thought he was dating a lawyer almost a decade older than him and maybe, if they’d figured it out, a notorious mercenary, and he had no more stuff to make s’mores. What else could go wrong?
“Great, the sun’s back,” came a long-suffering comment from down the beach. A glance that way told Peter that Dr. Pym and Janet were just walking up, both soaked to the skin and hand in hand. They must have been outside during all of this weather, Peter realized. Hank was definitely the one who wasn’t enjoying this situation—Jan looked like she thought it was hilarious.
“Okay, if you pull out anything stronger than aspirin, I gotta tell Cap.”
Tony smiled at her, encouraged that at least SOMEBODY was having the reaction people usually had to a gorgeous beach getaway and freedom from work for a full week. He handed her the key to the other cabin.
“Me neither,” Bruce replied mildly, tying up a stitch. “But I’ve thought about it. It’s all kind of a hopeless cause now with my ‘condition’, anyway.” He leaned and picked up the little scissors from the first aid kit, snipping the thread. No way—he was done with all of the stitches already?
The glowing woman stared over at him.
Raking his hair over his shoulder to wring it out, he suddenly eyed the spot where Cap and Tony were.
What was he doing? He could easily escape. But not without that arrow! If Stark really had managed to create something that disabled him this much—even in one small spot—he had to destroy all traces of it! With his head beginning to clear, he relaxed.
Bruce really was needed for all of this scientific and medical stuff—even if the scientist could talk him through it, the green Avenger could hardly perform any of the delicate procedures or typing necessary.
He cleared his throat.
"Rest easy, brother. You may have fooled us, but no harm has come of it."
"Those have flowers printed on them," he observed, bemused. "We're not in Hawaii, either."
“Ta…talk to me?” Clint asked, dumbly. “Why me? I’m the least helpful guy around here. Go bother T’Challa.”
The injured archer took a step back as Loki came closer. Clearly the demigod wasn't scared of them.
“Maybe the Hulk-sized footprints all over Peter’s demolished campsite,” Tony shot back, but with a lot less steam now. He looked uncertainly at Steve.
"Hopefully not w-what he's doing to Clint," the captain told her grimly.
“It does seem awfully coincidental that you chose this very lake,” Thor added, treading water dubiously nearby. “And why involve a whole camp full of mortals if you don’t intend some kind of mischief?”
Wiping his cheek with the back of his hand, Clint frowned at the smear of blood. Turning to Bruce, he was disappointed to see that the brown haired man’s eyes were still green. Way to ruin the afternoon, Clint, he thought in disappointment.
"Wait, Cap’s missing? Since when? Seriously?"
The enchantress's eyebrows lowered. Blasting Ms. Marvel with a wave of magic, Amora shot out of the hole in the shield where the hero had arrived from. The cosmic Avenger shook off the attack—rocketing away after her. “Oh no you don't!”
Bruce shook his head and frowned up at Cap.
Tony stared after him.
“You two are playing a really dangerous game,” Tony told them, looking from one face to the other. Hawkeye’s head was tipped as he was trying to read the article around Tony’s hand. “Hulk could KILL you by accident.”
Thor looked at him with worry in his blue eyes. He seemed in no hurry to lay Loki down again or let go of him.
“I guess it’s just us and the kids, then,” he sighed, starting off after Thor.
A bit self conscious of how his bottom looked that close up, Loki sipped his coffee and scrolled through the article lazily. From her tone of voice, the author of the article seemed to favor the idea.
"If there is one time I would be irresponsible to ask the other guy to come play with you, it's late at night when almost nobody else is around to run damage control. I'm sorry, but it's not worth it."
"So," he echoed, looking ahead of them again. "My room's in pieces. There's a hole in the roof." The last thing he wanted to ask was if they could go to Clint's room, because THAT couldn't be taken any other way than he intended... Yet, his room was in shambles, and frankly the bits and pieces of his research everywhere were depressing to look at.
"Why do I need an excuse to leave and go home?" Peter grumbled, stepping toward the edge of the roof. "You're starting to creep me out, man."
"Thanks," Peter told him, spitting out a bit of seaweed with a grimace. "Um...do you surf, is that why you're dressed like that?"
Cap watched it in awe. Tony always had some kind of trick up his sleeve—in this case, a robotic hand.
"So tell me of Banner," Thor said, like he was reading his mind. "Were you present when the beast overtook him?" He wrapped his big arm around Clint's waist and held the other hand high, waiting for the magic hammer to fly to him.
"You say you tracked him here?" Bruce asked, frowning. "That doesn't strike you as stalking?" He glanced at Clint, then back to Wade, waving toward the driveway to the place. "Yeah, I think you’d better go."
Tony was giving Thor a look. The demigod held up his hands, shrugging.
"I think you mean 'day before yesterday.' You've been in there awhile." Clint reached over and tried to smooth out a wrinkle in Bruce's shirt, but it was in vain. The creases were probably permanent by now.
Really? Thought Loki. Who HADN’T Hawkeye thrown himself at?
Peter shushed him, shaking his head.
Caught off guard by the accusation, Steve waved his hands quickly.
Despite what he'd said, he found himself looking at Clint's wrists in the straps. When he'd gotten back, there were marks on them. Bruce was all too familiar with those kinds of marks. Where had the other Clint gone, anyway?
"What's the matter? Maybe I can help."
“That was why he insisted I had to come back to camp,” Bruce replied wearily. He shook his head and gave a wry smile. “Thor thinks I’ll catch a chill. Isn’t that funny?”
“I’m sorry, who are you?” Cap cut in, frowning all over again.
Whether he heard or not, Tony certainly saw the look in his eyes. In fact, Steve saw the same conflict reflected back at him.
“I’m Matt,” the man said easily, sticking a hand out.
"Please. I can explain later, just don't take it out on Wade. This's my issue, not his."
"He said he had a tire for me. Unless, that was a euphemism." Deadpool paused, explaining to himself, "It means a sex joke that sounds like something normal."
“What the hell,” Clint breathed, blinking wide blue eyes up at them. “Spider-Man?”
"I—made him wait out in the rain for a long time. It, uh, it sucked. He really didn't like waiting."
"What about Captain America? YOU may be worthless to Thor, but the Captain is a leader of his team—a member of some VALUE."
“Why do you still have your mask on?” Johnny asked, looking up at Peter curiously. Spider-Man shrugged his shoulders.
The Avengers’ camping area was on a narrow strip of trees beside the lake. They had a little fire pit and a few tents, and the tree Peter and Wade had been hiding behind had a few arrows stuck in it on the other side. Tony was standing beside the fire, phone in hand, wearing faded jeans and a black T-shirt. He slowly lowered the phone, squinting at Wade.
Glancing up the trail to make sure Wade was preoccupied with picking the best route to the “shortcut”, Peter turned his attention back to the stitches, sighing.
He swayed, though, and went dunking head-first right into the water. Oh right, tequila. Hey, the water was warm, that was nice, he thought, popping his head above the surface and paddling absently in place. Maybe Bruce and Clint had the right idea, going for a swim.
The blond just managed to quirk an eyebrow up at him, a look of disgust on his face.
“Nothing,” Matt told him, smile fading a bit. “Look, my ‘intentions’ with Peter are the same as always—I want to make sure that he’s not caught up in some mess that Deadpool made.”
Bruce blinked. Oh. Right.
Peter glanced at him, shoulders slumping in defeat.
Tony's topaz eyes widened at the look Cap was giving him, and he arched an eyebrow almost indignantly.
"Hey, hey, you guys know this's gonna lead nowhere! I mean, you both heal, you both can't die, why bother?"
"Sorry. Forgot you were a nerd," he added with a chuckle. Hopefully Stark needed Thor around longer—his plan for the Hulk seemed to have taken a step backwards. How could Bruce be so calm? Watching the Clints fight seemed like it worked out pretty well to get him excited, but the oddly continuous flow of blood from Loki’s side made him think that now wasn't the best time for a rematch.
"Uh...right," Pepper said. It was hard to tell if the cough afterward was caused by her dry throat, or trying very hard to change the subject. "And he took your Avengers cards, right?"
It took an embarrassingly long time for Peter to realize that the cabin’s power wasn’t out at all—the lights were just off because nobody had been in there before they showed up. By chance, he’d instinctively tried to flip the light switch in the bathroom and startled himself with the sudden bright light. Returning to the kitchen where Matt and Wade were still eating the sandwiches they’d just made, he flipped the switch to that room as well.
THUNK.
Both Cap and Wade were distracted by the lightning, looking up at the sky. It had been a beautifully clear day. Where had that come from?
"I'll be by to check on you later," Tony called after her. "You don't seem as bad as Cap, here, but still, you DID get gassed and all."
“Alright, alright. We’ll take your word for.”
"—5 million dollars—"
"I-it's not consistent. I lose big chunks of time."
"Here..." Tony lifted a hand, which was quite shaky, then clenched it into a fist and laughed. "Ow...damn, you're not kidding around..."
Bruce led Loki over to sit on the exam table before heading over to inspect the machine. He seemed satisfied with it, going to the computer next.
“I know you think I’m old fashioned and behind the times, and you’re right. I was so slow to catch on to how you felt, you beat me to it.”
“I-I mean, I can tell, I mean do you think he’s SERIOUS about it.” Wade was not serious about much, in his experience. The guy also had a very, very short attention span. Peter was nervous to see what that meant relationship-wise. There was only one way to find out. “Never mind, it doesn’t matter,” he added hastily, patting Matt’s shoulder. “Um…what about you?” He probably should’ve clarified whether he was asking if Matt liked him or if Matt liked Wade, but honestly he was curious about the answer to both of those questions.
Sighing, Clint pointed Cap out to Bruce.
Bruce turned and reached for the kit, clicking the lid open. He seemed a little surprised, for some reason.
So, Bruce hadn’t been worried about him at all, the archer concluded silently, leaning back on the rock and looking down at the water, too. Worrying about him was a waste of time, anyway. Being bruised and achy was daily life.
Clutching the book to his chest, Loki spun to glare at his brother.
Tony snorted.
With the shop blocked and Clint standing close by again, Bruce had no choice except to look at him. He shrugged his shoulders, too tired to really formulate much more excuses at the moment.
"Don't worry about it." Clint settled on the couch right next to Bruce, scooting intentionally closer to him. He wrapped his blanket around him again, cocooning himself in…and giving Bruce a sly smile.
It was a sunny day over New York City.
“Good morning,” Cap told him, ignoring the scowl Clint gave him in passing.
"Are you Doctor Doom?"
"Yeah, I know. You said it," Tony assured him. "Now if I drop dead, your conscience is clear—no worries." He sighed and tried to sit up a little. That promptly ended in wincing and slumping back against the wall again. Nothing like getting electrocuted for creating aches and pains.
Her black hair was back in a loose braid, which hung over her shoulder and was long enough to brush the middle of her thigh, ending in a tiny curl.
Clint came over and sat beside Bruce just as a rumble of thunder sounded far off in the distance, followed shortly by a bright flash of lightning. When the flash vanished, so did all the street lights.
It definitely caught Amora's attention, and she released Loki. The spiteful demigod gave her a swift kick to the back of the knees—knocking her clean off her feet. The Hulk could do the rest.
Laughing nervously, Peter ran a hand through his wet hair and leaned to peek around T’challa into the cabin. “Is Thor here? The weather’s going berserk.”
Bruce climbed off of the table, stepping over to look at the ‘new’ Hawkeye as well. His outfit was a little battered, he noticed, with tears and scuffs in places it had not had the last time he'd seen Hawkeye in the uniform.
“Whoa, what’re you implying there, pal?” Clint asked--though he didn’t seem serious, judging by the smirk.
The scientist looked over and shifted awkwardly from one foot to the other in the sand.
"Wait, wait. Come here for a sec." The archer beckoned him back over.
Clint couldn’t stop himself from sputtering as they stopped by the shoreline. Water bubbled over his toes as he tried to come up with a nice way to explain things and NOT out himself.
Deadpool leaned dangerously over the edge and stared at him.
Or was it pajamas? No, that might imply Peter had been in the guy's bedroom, better not mention it...
"Can I stay here tonight?" Well, so much for intelligent OR non-awkward.
The scientist instinctively shrunk away from him, keeping his arms hugged in close to his sides.
“After rumors of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers secretly tying the knot over the weekend, new sources are saying that the honeymoon is over! Tony Stark was spotted outside of the Avengers mansion this afternoon, locking lips with well-known evil doer Loki.”
Abruptly, Peter felt terrible for poor Cap. He'd try talking to Tony alone, he decided, and figuring out what HE thought was going on. Maybe it wasn't actually divorce yet, maybe there was still a chance. Maybe this was why he'd stowed away in a car trunk for 10+ hours.
“What?” Matt asked, suddenly concerned. “What happened?” He asked Peter.
Digging through his pocket, Steve offered him a handkerchief.
"TONY?!" Apparently the mere mention of Tony just made the Hulk angrier. Or maybe anything would have and he just needed something to yell?
The beach was much quieter off to this side, the distant laughing and bonfire crackling drowned out by the soft shushing waves rolling over the shore. The water here was deep enough to swim in right near the shore, with a few rocks out there. Looked like a prime mermaid sighting spot, if mermaids were even a thing. Tony made a mental note to bother Thor about that later, sighing and stooping to pick up a seashell. Throwing something as far as he could out to sea sounded nice right now.
Scrolling back up, the green eyed man frowned at the article. It certainly made some outrageous claims about Thor and himself!
“I saw that, but I didn’t know what half the ingredients were,” Cap told him sheepishly. “I thought it’d just be easier to make some.”
A ‘group kind of thing.’ Wow. Sweet, little Peter Parker was dating not one, but TWO men. A known murderous mercenary and a vigilante that definitely worked in the gray area of superhero morality.
“Should we intervene?” Steve asked, glancing at Tony for help. There was no doubt in his mind that Loki would talk circles around Thor, especially if Thor was trying not to start a fight. Maybe Loki would behave himself once he saw Thor’s hammer.
"Hm?" Apparently, he was still awake. The blue eyed man looked up at him, sighing. "Yeah. I knew you were like Doom."
"You haven't even seen him," Bruce told the blonde, sighing. "He's dosed up on morphine, don't take him too seriously."
“He’s right, I’ve gotta go. Clint’s fought some pretty freaky monsters and the one he saw seems dangerous to HIM, so we’ve got to warn Cap and Tony and the others. And I know your lunch break doesn’t last forever, so I’ll just text you later, okay?” He nodded even though nobody could see it in a phone conversation. “Yep, he’s very excited. Okay. Okay, bye!”
"Bruce, I-I..." He struggled. Have six toes? Hate green? Am in love with Stark? Am really Loki?
The archer saw him eat the pizza sandwich and did the same.
Stomping across the room to them, Clint stabbed the arrow he’d been holding into the coffee table. Then, giving Loki a meaningful glare, he sat down on the couch to join them.
Peter squeezed his hands, glancing down the hill again.
“Peter,” he began, blue eyes flicking Tony’s way. Then he pulled on a weary smile and patted Peter’s back again. “Let’s finish this castle.”
"Hey Thor, any chance you can make a U-turn back here?" Hawkeye asked nicely, speaking into his card.
“No, but there’s a good chance he might be a villain or a SHIELD agent. You said you’d have Jarvis take a look once we got Peter to tell us the man’s name. Tony,” Cap placed a hand on his friend’s shoulder, mostly just to ensure that they kept a BIT more of a distance between them. “Peter sounds serious about him. We need to use TACT.”
“I hear my name!”
"...Thinking maybe we could stargaze," Bruce was saying, scanning the bright sky thoughtfully. "It looks like it'll be clear out tonight. I don't have a telescope, but the constellations are still nice to look at."
The archer shook his head, baffled. What made them think that? Did Tony really believe that stupid tabloid?
Cap squinted from the sudden brightness, shielding his face weakly with his free hand.
Tony glanced at him, sighing and giving up charging off down the beach. He wasn't coordinated enough to right now, anyway.
“Please. It won’t take long.”
“About us, or about him and the weird love zig-zag situation he’s got going?” He had a feeling Steve was worried about the former. What would they even do if Peter didn’t approve of them getting married?
"Right." Cap took the cure from Clint instead, removing the needle. "Does it h-have to be inj-jected?"
Peter cringed, about to shush him. Before he could even get out a ‘shhh’, he heard Tony calling from the clearing.
"Sir, Dr. Banner says that the cure has been completed, and that you should now disconnect the power," JARVIS said drolly. "I do hope you're still conscious."
He drew a slow breath and let go of the reactor.
"It's way overkill for the plan—he wouldn't make it this dangerous on purpose!" He called back, leading the way to the other cabin. "At least, I hope not!"
"I'm fine, I'm good," Tony told the redhead, looking down at the mess of wires he'd hooked up to the power source in his chest. "...Now which one was it again..."
"Hm," Steve managed, already drifting off. His eyes fell closed. The blankets were very nice. But...wait. Why wasn't Tony checking on Clint? He had been there too. The archer had helped Cap pull everyone out of the building. Fighting off forming dreams, Cap forced his eyes open again, grabbing Tony's shoulder. "Wait."
"Huh?” Hawkeye asked, squinting around them. The window at the end of the hall gave them a little light, but it wasn't much.
“You do that, and I’ll figure out where Clint and the Hulk spent the night. We’ll have that talk with them together, though.”
Sniffling, the blond squeezed Tony’s fingers gently.
"How t-thoughtful," Cap mumbled.
As soon as the loud man spun to go that way, Cap started to sit the plates out on the counter, frowning to himself.
Despite his words, Cap just sort of stood there, eyes drifting between Peter and Wade.
"Hey guys. How's it going in here?"
The tall man stared at him, his mask still.
"Thor has demonstrated many times that he will come to aid his friends. This takes Avengers out of the equation as I capture them one by one, weakening them as a whole and giving the advantage to Doom." He paused, staring at Loki intently. "If YOU are here, then where is the true Hawkeye?"
“Good morning, team,” Steve told everyone, taking a seat on one of their tiny folding chairs. Looking Bruce over, he smiled. “Dr. Banner, I think it’d be better if you at least slept within sight of camp. The website said that there were both black bears and mountain lions around here.”
“I tried, but I wasn’t sure what to say, and then Wade came over,” Cap explained as calmly as he could. What was he thinking? Peter was only 18 years old! Which, in the present day, sadly meant that he must have dated more than Cap. Blushing, he shook his head.
The super soldier went willingly, scanning their dark surroundings along the way.
Gulp.
“We should give the shark a moment to clear off,” he commented uncertainly, squinting as another gust slammed into the two of them.
Daredevil pulled on a pleasant smile.
"On it," Tony said briefly, turning and rocketing away. This bombing thing could wait. As much as he hated to leave Captain America and Clint to whatever situation they were in, if the Hulk got loose in New York it would be a disaster that could get people killed. Lots of people.
Bruce unfastened a strap, stepping around to free his other hand as well. He didn't say anything, just went about undoing the ankle straps, too, and then kneeling to gather up the needles and gauze that had been dropped on the floor earlier.
He figured it was probably safer to put some distance between them until he figured out why exactly he was noticing the things about Clint that he was suddenly noticing. Maybe he could pretend to walk over and examine the sandwich shop hours sign...yeah, good idea. He did so.
“Eh,” the archer offered, slogging past Cap. “What’s for dinner?”
Dropping the marshmallow he had been holding, Cap ignored it and grabbed another, stabbing it on the stick with a frown.
Tony frowned at the armored hand in the doorway.
“Take me to the trail. I bet I can track them.” No wonder he’d been staying bundled up—he was missing both his shirt and his shoes under there, and looked like he’d been walking barefoot through the mud! Had the Hulk paid a visit while they were distracted?
Thor was not making things look any better when he bowed his head and kissed Loki's forehead.
“Loki knows Peter’s here,” he whispered to his fiance.
"I'm sure the police can handle it from here," Cap wheezed. He stopped a fireman as he was going into the building. "Be careful, it's some kind of chemical smoke." The man nodded and Cap turned back to Clint. "Let's head back to the mansion."
Clint was queer too? Cap thought, alarmed.
He paused and peeked back over his shoulder, but luckily it didn't seem anybody else had heard him talking about sleeping upside-down on the ceiling. "Maybe we should go back inside to talk about this," he suggested to Cap.
"Nay, you do not understand. An Asgardian does not fall unless his wounds are dire indeed!"
The captain suddenly noticed Lola as she stepped up to chat with Thor, batting big eyes up at him. Cap didn’t comment, going to take his seat…the one on the opposite side of the fire as Tony.
"Cap," Tony said grimly, grabbing the front of Steve's shirt. "I figured it out. Some SHIELD agent must be dating Spider-Man to get close enough to figure out his real identity!"
"Being sat on hurts, too," Bruce said pointedly. "You're, ah...a-a lot heavier than me."
"Outside...? I thought you wanted to practice somewhere with lasers and robots," Bruce said, blinking. As far as he knew, the only place to find those this time of a relatively peaceful night was to practice in the mansion's training room, which Tony had stocked with robot drones. Namely, the ones he didn't like enough to keep as his workshop assistants.
"Not you, PJs—you other one, come here."
“I…don’t think I should talk about it. I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.” As Steve added the last, his eyes drifted back to Tony, who was now alone on the other side of the fire.
“You have to be more careful. What if you got an infection? There’s all kinds of bacteria in the lake.”
In the darkened stairwell with only the Arc reactor to light the way, it was a little eerie, too.
"Uh...wow, that's not good," Peter said, sitting up into a crouched position, still sideways on the wall. Good thing he had no qualms about heights—the sidewalk was 'dead ahead' right now, straight down the wall.
“Apparently,” Tony replied drolly, taking a seat nearby. “We know what you’ve been up to, so you don’t have to play dumb about it.”
"Whoohoo! Awesome pizza is on its way, guys. They said it'd be like fifteen minutes, tops."
"D-down," the first Avengers groaned, abruptly pushing himself out of Tony's arms. With a thunk, he landed face first on the floor.
"A new cellmate," both Clints said in unison, glancing at each other.
“Yeah, my bet’s on him making his own job instead of applying to one,” Tony agreed. This was a strangely civil conversation. Matt wasn’t exactly what he’d been expecting. “…Did Peter really say he considered Cap and I his father figures?”
From his rooftop vantage, Peter could see that most of the city was still dark from the power outage. School had indeed been canceled and his schedule was open now. His spider senses suddenly made his neck hairs raise.
Peter was too smart to fool for long, Tony thought, even as he smiled brightly for the camera. The kid could tell he and Cap had something going on, but couldn't figure out what.
“Get the hell off me!” Clint growled, shoving Wade away.
Thor landed and turned to face him as well.
Peter mustered a smile at him, then reached over and patted Daredevil's shoulder in turn.
"Been tracking you for miles, kid." Wolverine leaned even closer, resting his elbows on his knees. "Where's the merc?" He growled, cracking his knuckles.
Smiling at Tony, he gave him a kiss before stepping out of the tent.
Johnny spun and did a dive through the hole, zooming down to the front door. He dropped Spider-Man on his feet and landed.
“Clint, it’s alright if you don’t—”
"Easy—careful." Tony hurried to support him, keeping hold of one hand and bracing his other hand on Steve's shoulder.
Thanking his false father for once, Loki swallowed, staring down at his side. He actually felt a little woozy again, but it was probably just from his heart imploding in terror.
He wasn’t willing to add to Tony and Cap’s argument by asking what the Hulk WAS doing. Bruce had said something about running into a bear.
Since Clint was injured and Cap was guilt-ridden over Bruce being attacked by a bear, they’d gotten to skip taking watch by the lake in case of Loki attacks.
"By Detroit, I meant your house!" The merc clarified loudly, waving a hand. "See you there!"
"Fine." He stepped around the Hulk, going back over to dig in the medical bag. He had seen this done before. It couldn't be that difficult. His side was already stitched closed, so as long as none of those had been ripped, all he had to do was clean it up and bandage it. The blond picked up the small first aid pamphlet and thumbed through it. Disinfect, gauze and wrap.
An eerie laugh that echoed over the water, bouncing between the trees and fading into the dark of night.
“I’m sorry, when you two said ‘relaxing camping trip,’ I expected one of Tony’s resort-type places—not actual nature.”
“Ask me anything you want,” Lola purred back, a gold-tipped finger playing with a strand of hair over her shoulder.
"Yes," the masked man said solemnly.
Looking at the half-sunken kayak Cap still held onto, the brunette said hastily, “I-I saw a shark! Yep, shark, at least a six footer. We probably shouldn’t be out there in kayaks with him around, just to be safe.”
Bruce seemed to think so; he took a step away when Clint took a step toward him. Go figure, they had to get stuck in one of the rooms the Hulk hadn't already torn a hole through the other day...
"Come on. We need the nerd," Hawkeye told the Hulk.
Tony saw Bruce suddenly press the cure into Clint's hand and promptly slumped on him again.
"Are you really trying to tell me we didn't just hear him dumping you?" Tony stepped around to the other side of the campfire, too, crossing his arms. That looked difficult while holding a root beer bottle, but he managed.
"What, he just GAVE it to you?" Tony wrinkled his nose and looked at the blue-green stain on the handkerchief. "That's kind of weird."
"We won't hurt you," Bruce said evenly, sliding the needle out of his hand with a little hiss.
"Why? I figured it out!" Hawkeye went to dig out a needle.
Snagging a cup from the ground, he poured it full and sipped it, grimacing from the heat as his eyes landed on a weird looking red-haired guy. The man was sitting in the chair beside Tony’s, smiling behind his excessively dark shades.
“Are you?” Bruce asked, trying to sound neutral.
"I lied." The merc sighed at last, resting his hands in his lap.
"No." Steve shook his head. "Did he know where w-we were?"
"C'mon, Deadpool, Spider-Man might be here too." Probably not, but maybe she didn't want to walk into the basement alone...maaaybe.
“Was that real or in my head?”
What would Cap and Tony say?
"Pepperoni," Bruce said flatly, and buried his face in his arms again.
"Well. I'm here," Loki offered, keeping his hand on Thor's. "I know you just think of me as your pal, but you know..." He shrugged a shoulder, trying to imitate Hawkeye’s casual air. "Or I could just get you her cell phone number," he added dejectedly. "If you really like her."
Resisting the urge to ask if anyone had seen him when he transformed, Cap gave a wave to Thor.
Thunder rolled behind them as they stepped inside the dimly-lit front entranceway.
"Yeah, then I would finally get a day off." The archer shrugged, not bothering to retrieve his arm from around Bruce. "You like having your boring fishing days."
Grinning, Clint followed him in, diving as soon as the water was deep enough.
"Well, what's the story, then?" Tony asked. Peter's heart thudded in his chest until the dark-haired man followed that up with, "Should we act like you're together or not?"
Loki sighed, poking through the remains of the Chinese food on the coffee table. It had been surprisingly good. He had never spent much time eating takeout, as the mortals called it, but on his next visit he'd decided he’d have to stop and try a few more kinds.
Tony glanced up at the sky and frowned.
Carefully looking away from him, Bruce stared at the ceiling instead. In his mind, Bruce was trying to decide which was worse—not acting uncomfortable and possibly having Clint get too close and set off his heart rate, or acting uncomfortable because he was WORRIED about Clint doing all of the above and winding up with the archer thinking he believed that clone-robot-imposter person was him.
"Once Tony gets the power back on, Thor's card will work again," he reassured the blonde. "I'll call him up for you—okay?"
Okay, ew. But it was a horror story, it had to be horrible...right?
Peter glanced back at Cap and Tony, gears turning in his head. Cap's super soldier self was probably immune to onion fumes, but what if Tony started crying in the middle of making the sauce with him? He didn't have his armor, so onion fumes would probably hit HIM like a truck.
“We’ll be fine!” Clint insisted, snagging Hulk’s arm and pulling on it to try and steer him away from camp. All he wanted to do was climb a tree and have a big green Hulk hammock to snooze on.
“I don't w-want to complain, b-but where is t-that cure?” Steve groaned from the chair he hadn't moved from since they had arrived. In all the fuss over Loki, it seemed like Tony and him had been forgotten.
"So, nothing? I mean, other than fishing?" Clint gave him a quirked eyebrow as he leaned on the wall next to Bruce, intelligent blue eyes scanning his face. "You know, I don't know that much about you. I know you study gamma radiation, sleep on your face at your desk and like fishing—but do you actually do ANYTHING else?"
"Let me bandage that up," he told Loki, frowning the slightest bit. "If you're the real Hawkeye, bleeding that much is serious."
Cap glanced and saw that Bruce was examining some computer readouts across the room, comparing samples. He hadn’t looked up at the sound of his name.
The blond Avenger tried to relax to help him breathe better, but he couldn't help staring. Doom played surprisingly well, especially for somebody in metal gauntlets. Steve closed his eyes, listening to the music. He hadn't slept in almost 48 hours and it was very tempting to just doze off right there.
Steve shook his hand, worried that he’d be rude not to. As soon as Matt retrieved his hand, he continued.
"Cap? Th-they got YOU?" The woman coughed again, but when she spoke up louder, she sounded familiar. The next sentence clarified that quickly. "They didn't get Tony, did they?"
"Steve's old-fashioned," Peter said happily. "Isn't it cool he even knows how to make sauce?"
"Is it done?" Maybe he could slip outside while the scientist was distracted. Sliding quietly off of the medical bed, he sneaked toward the door.
Bruce was about to reply, but got distracted by the blanket dropping to the ground. Why couldn't important relationship details arise on a day he WASN'T running on four hours' sleep for the entire last week?
"I'll use my card," Peter said quickly, grateful for the change in subject. Great, Johnny had gone from thinking Deadpool was his partner to worse!
"So..."
Steve wobbled from supporting her.
She moved over toward the fence where she'd seen the red, cupping a hand near her face. "Hey Tony! Is that you?"
“I’m sorry if I’m being offensive—this is a bit new for me—but I’m surprised how many people are queer around here,” Steve said in bemusement, going back to assembling a s’more. He stuck a marshmallow on a stick and handed it off to Peter. “Well, HE better be nice, then. What’s his name?”
"Eh, it's not like I'm in a bunch of danger going outside by myself," Tony was replying. "Go back if you really want to, I'm almost done scanning anyway. Check on Cap for me."
The archer looked up at him, eyes wide.
Right behind him. But before he could react, he was rolling across the rooftop—someone massively heavy pinning him down, growling.
As the blond made to get up, he turned and gawked at Lola’s legs as the woman stopped on his other side to admire the castle.
Yeah, cause that wasn’t ominous, Clint thought darkly as he trailed after Bruce. Cap was gonna start using his dad voice any second.
Peter stood there and glanced back at the others a few times, making sure they were warming up throwing the frisbee before he turned back to Steve.
"Yeah, you should wait 'til you can talk to him alone," Peter said sagely. "Hey, uh, I apologize in advance if I clobber you with the frisbee, by the way..."
"He doesn't usually want to CATCH Dr. Richards," Pepper pointed out, blinking. "Usually he just wants to best him or make him look bad. At least, that's what I got out of the newspaper article I read about them. I've never met Doom until now."
"Then go home and GET one."
Meanwhile, Loki was playing shy, batting her eyelashes at Thor and giggling behind a hand.
Swimmers, the giggle of kids doing who knows what, Captain America making a sandcastle.
"Okay, if you say so, Thor then," Tony shrugged. "Hey Jarvis, tell Thor to come back here so he can babysit Clint."
A hand patted Peter’s cheek, also gentle.
“Um, I think so,” Cap said, clearing his throat and again looking at Tony for a signal. “There’s enough spaghetti?”
“Remarkable,” Cap commented without a hint of actually being impressed. He was busy scrutinizing the map, tracing a finger over the little spots Peter had mentioned. Tucking the map under his arm, Cap pointed to the flags. “Are we making teams by color or did you have something else in mind?”
“I believe you have something that’s mine. Give it back. Now.”
As Loki was about to reply, he noticed Hawkeye glance back at Thor, then dart away down the hall. Loki quirked an eyebrow, watching the mortal dash off before he turned his attention back to Thor.
Matt mumbled down to Peter, “Do you see my cane?”
"I..." More kicked puppy, he thought, mustering a very long face, eyes turned downward. "Do you love Jane?"
"Do not do anything FOOLISH—you are weak, and I am strong," he warned. His hand ignited with green flame, then, and the shackle popped off.
Hello, turns out I was wrong about us posting once a week on Tuesdays--we're now posting a chapter on Tuesday and a chapter on Friday each week. ♥ Onward, to the shenanigans!
Clint sat down again on the table edge, careful not to lean back too far in case Doctor Doom got the idea of strapping him down again. Though that was kind of funny. Doom hadn't returned his shirt yet, either.
“Oh yeah. Great!” Clint unceremoniously yanked the hook out and threw it into the waves. It was the damn tackle box! It was haunting him now! Mocking him! Shoving his profusely bleeding finger into his mouth, he scowled and kept waving the metal detector.
"I'm fine," Loki scoffed, putting a hand to his side. He lifted it slowly back up, blanching at the large amount of blood smeared across his palm.
Jeez, the situation was a headache. Peter truly had no idea what he was doing, but he owed it to these two to at least try.
Clint’s eyes drifted to the other man’s back, noticing the freckles sprinkled across his shoulders. He looked down at the bottle of sunscreen in his hand.
The archer saw this and smirked to himself.
"Um, welcome back."
“I don’t think so,” Matt whispered back, shifting to face Peter. “Look, I was already halfway up the mountain when you called me. I couldn’t just turn back because of the Avengers. I mean, Peter, I had to meet them sooner or later.”
"Yeah. I guess I better go." Deadpool shrugged, sitting up. "It'll take forever to get to Dallas!" He looked over the roof edge casually.
"Yeah, well one's got to be a fake," Tony said pointedly. "'Til we get the other back here and compare them, you've got babysitting duty—don't let him out of your sight while we're gone, got it?"
“Thanks for the backup in there! Jeez, can you believe those guys?” Hawkeye practically shouted, now safely back on the Hulk’s shoulder as they made their way back out into the city. Passersby cleared the way for the big green man.
“Matt didn’t even know the Avengers were here until he was halfway up the hiking trail,” Peter reminded Wade, sighing. God, Cap and Tony were probably having an emergency meeting about him right this minute… “And, um, Wade, remember that talk we had about letting them assume we’re just friends? Besides Hawkeye, of course. He already seems to know everything, even that Matt’s Daredevil.”
After a few more passes of the frisbee, Steve started peeling the label on his soda, clearing his throat.
Well, 'dear' wasn't the word, but there was someone who came to mind for Cap that Thor just couldn't let be. It only surprised him that Doom hadn’t thought of it. Maybe it was because Loki was generally on Doom’s side? Did super villains try to capture each other?
"I-I was just gonna put Dr. Banner's fishing stuff in there! But I had the trunk open and shoved the box in, and then you sorta...swerved?" He illustrated a sharp left turn with one hand, rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly with the other. "And, wow this's embarrassing, but I sorta had my hand stuck to the tackle box so it didn't open or anything, annnd went into the trunk head-first. And then it slammed shut. With me in there. Sorry?"
“Tsk, fine,” Clint groaned, heading back to the cabin.
"I'm not scared of you," he explained, a tiny bit ashamed of himself for making Clint look so uncomfortable. "I mean, ah...it's not that I don't want you around," he continued, now feeling uncomfortable, himself. "...Let's just go." He turned and walked quickly to the living room. They had to get a pizza, right?
Bruce turned and slowly made his way to the couch. He still didn't seem to feel quite right. Sitting down carefully, he looked at the two Clints.
"No. Jarvis said they’re switched off, something about conserving power."
Still shuffling the cards, Clint glanced over at him and chewed his lip. Man, why was Bruce so intimidating?
Peter was starting to get a headache. The whole weekends alone thing had been his idea—this thing he read about in a polyamory dating book, a way to get closer to each of his boyfriends one-on-one. He’d bought books about this, why was he still so BAD at it?
"Let's just go to the medical room," Bruce said dully. "Please. Tony can't unplug from the power until we cure Cap."
“…He was completely fine!” Matt was saying, annoyed. “You could have called me back or even just texted me to let me know that you and Peter weren’t battling with some giant sea monster!”
“I’ll head up the trail on foot,” he said, stopping at Tony before he remembered that he couldn’t give him a kiss goodbye. “Can you stay here with Matt? I’m worried he’ll try and run off,” he whispered.
Thor stayed where he was. Every minute or so, lightning would strike the hammer again and send light bursting overhead. Hopefully nobody was looking for Thor right now, because that was pretty obviously his handiwork...
Steve spun to find a man with a walking stick and a baseball cap pulled low over his dark shades.
No, he couldn’t sleep yet—he and Bruce had barely gotten to swim. Mustering all his effort, Clint pushed himself back up into a sitting position.
"Uh. Think I could borrow your shirt until we get back to the cabin to cover up?" Bruce asked tiredly. "This is a new one on me. I can't remember the last time I lost a whole outfit that wasn't because of the Hulk."
He knelt down and started to pull Steve's shoes off one by one.
“It has,” Matt confirmed.
The Hulk was too big and way too close by to have gotten up without Clint noticing, and that meant…
Lucky break.
“I might have stabbed him with a magic arrow,” the archer admitted, turning around to face Hulk. “Hey buddy!” He said quickly, both hands up. “Come on, you kicked her butt. Tony has to pay for this!” The blond gestured to the ruined wall.
Carol leaned in to see, raising an eyebrow.
Peter took a deep breath and patted Matt’s shoulder, nodding. As uncomfortable as the whole situation was, the redhead was right—they had a responsibility to tell Thor.
Bruce placed a hand over one of the ones gripping his arm.
“I know we talked about looking like normal campers and not using any powers, but yeah. This is sort of an emergency.”
A little sound outside drew Tony’s attention back to the present, and he groaned, rubbing a hand over his face. Coffee, that’s what he needed. Coffee and for somebody to reassure him that Peter’s camping trip with Deadpool was just two guys camping out platonically, as friends, no super-powered chaperone necessary.
“What if we did a boat thing? People team up, take a boat and go collect things? Or plant flags. Something like that,” Matt offered.
The cabin door pushed back open, both Cap and Wade stepping out with a concerned-looking Peter in tow.
“Wait, so Clint and Tony are dating? Wow,” Cap breathed, unsure why that made him feel sad.
Tony slumped against him a little.
“Peter?” It was Cap. He was standing at the bottom of the steps that led up to the cabins, scanning the beach for him.
Flinching, Clint dropped his arms to his sides in an attempt to look less angry.
"I don't know how." More like didn't want to. If he could just make it back into the hallway for a few seconds...he could teleport out, heal up and return to another part of the mansion with an illusion of an injury. No one would know, he could continue his plan and not pass out from blood loss.
“I can’t deal with this crap!”
"Yay," Clint sighed. "Can I have my shirt back?" It was a good thing he was cold-resistant.
Weird, Tony could have sworn it was the other way around in the satellite images of this place…
"That was certainly fast! Pay the nice gentleman, Peter, and let's go inside." She stepped out of the cab.
"Well, the poison was a gas, so it's in your lungs. If you take slow, deep breaths it'll get more blood pumping to your lungs and help speed things up," Bruce said. "I'm not quite sure how long it will take, though."
“Wow, the water’s warm.”
"Because!" Clint said quickly. "Because you'll hurt people." He hopped off the car and came over in between Hulk and the wrecked cars. "Besides, the training room repairs itself."
“I want to know what your intentions are with Peter,” Steve stated, staying by the door.
Bruce broke into a yawn, covering his mouth with one hand.
"GAH—hey, that's my AUNT, she's not that old!" Peter's protests thankfully were not heard by Aunt May, who had already gone into the house. She was bound to come back out and look for him if he didn't get in there soon, though.
Spotting him and Thor, her hand snapped shut and she retreated under the umbrella shyly.
Getting out there to retrieve the others had only taken him and Ms. Marvel in the end. If there hadn't been a ‘Hulk rampaging in New York’ situation, he'd have gotten there a lot sooner, though. No wonder Doom let them all go so easy—he probably already got what he wanted by then! Tony promptly decided that he'd better stop thinking that train of thought or he'd make a noticeably disgusted face.
Cap dropped back into the seat and braced himself beside his fellow Avenger, giving Clint a look of annoyance.
Stubbornly keeping his arm over Bruce, Clint toasted Thor with the sunscreen.
Tony was still looking at the black-clad Clint silently.
“Of course!” He turned to Lola with fond blue eyes. “She is a vision of splendor, is she not?”
"H-he really doesn't want to talk about it. I’m sure he’ll get over it."
“I’m sure you can relate, Peter. Fighting crime doesn’t leave a lot of time for romance,” Cap told him, patting his shoulder and opening the cabin door for him.
Tony tried not to laugh. It was both fantastic and so damned frustrating dating Steve and having to not flaunt it.
“Dude, stop waving your arms around! You keep getting blood on me!”
“We’ll be back before you know it!”
"Thor? Why Thor?"
"Actually, I had no intention of coming here. I simply 'went with the flow' as the mortals say. Why have you captured Captain America and the supposed Hawkeye? If you wanted to catch Thor, would it have not made more sense to capture Jane Foster…or me?" Loki circled around Doom slowly, brushing a finger along the tops of some vials in a rack on the table.
"You really want the Hulk to go on a rampage again?" Loki didn't back down and simply shook his head. "Real me wouldn’t let that happen."
The archer wrapped his other arm around Thor's neck, watching as the city below them sped past. "Um, he was last seen at the South Mountain reservation," he called over the wind, rain and thunder—squinting to keep at least some of the rain out of his eyes.
Bothered, Steve knelt behind a large rock near the lake’s shore. It was up the hill a bit, which made it easy to spot the blond Adonis down by the water.
“I feel like there’s a pun in there somewhere about ‘meddle detecting,’ but I’ll let it go. Look, if we keep messing with fake relationships and who’s dating who, my head’s gonna explode.”
“Thor told you he was gay? Just like that? Wow. I thought I was the guy in the know!”
“I do and I also know Peter’s, just for the record.” Daredevil watched Cap as he disappeared into the cabin, turning to Tony again and smiling. “So, the tabloids were right. ‘The playboy and the American dreamboat.’” The vigilante chuckled and shook his head.
“In general, dating isn’t exactly available to me,” Bruce clarified, pulling him back to the present. Right. Gay Avengers. Apparently there were a lot of them. “And nobody’s lining up for a date with the Hulk ever, so we’ve sort of accepted at this point that we’re going to stay alone.”
Sighing, Bruce stepped into the room and shut the door. Dropping the clothes into his hammock, he started pulling his hoodie off over his head.
Abruptly, the room was plunged into blackness.
With a wry smile, Bruce swiped some sunscreen off of his nose and reached over, smudging it onto Clint's nose as well.
"We're here, and this is what they have here," Bruce replied dryly.
“You know, maybe we should wait,” Tony said hastily, placing a hand on Steve’s shoulder. He turned to Bruce and added apologetically, “This was supposed to be a really low-key, calm, PEACEFUL kind of trip. We didn’t think there’d be anything around here worth Hulking out over. If you didn’t lose your temper, could you at least help us understand what actually happened?” That was remarkably diplomatic, coming from Tony. Clint wouldn’t have thought he had it in him.
“I could always just go out there and turn into Hulk. I bet everybody would come running,” Bruce said. It was delivered so deadpan that only the little smirk along with told Clint he was joking.
"Easy, Cap." Hawkeye got up from the computer and rushed to Steve too, helping to hold the large man up. "Tony and Thor went out to check on the Baxter building—Thor's on his way back now. Tony said something about more scans."
"I agree with my clone," the other Clint said. "Why are we locked in here? Between Thor and Hulk, what in the world do you think we're going to do?"
Pausing with his arms extended, Steve stared at the carpet.
The green Avenger grabbed the medical bag Bruce had brought in in one big fist, turned and dropped it onto the sofa beside the blonde. "Patch up, Cupid."
"Hey me," Hawkeye said cheerfully, patting his twin's cheek. He seemed very concerned, but made an effort to hide it.
Loki couldn't help a laugh.
“I gotta take a piss. Hold my pack.”
There was a loud gasp of pure shock from the floor behind them and the injured Clint stood back up, shoving past them both.
“Of course not,” Cap chimed in. “But Wade stays the entire week.”
“Bugssssss,” Wade whined, climbing to his feet and holding up the frisbee sadly. It was cracked all the way through.
"We're almost home," he added, looking down at the lights of the city. The Avengers mansion wasn't hard to spot.
"Ah, what? I'm just tired," he said, before Clint had a chance to ask what was wrong with him.
Pepper held up one of her high heeled shoes. Steve saw that the heel was gone.
"Bruce?" He shouted, wiping the rain out of his eyes. The rain was icy and was biting at his skin more now that he was in the shade of the trees.
“Peter said it was you. He said that you threw a tree through his tent.”
“Good morning,” came Cap’s polite reply.
"You sure you're okay?" Your face is all red..." Loki persisted, leaning to press a cool palm to Bruce's forehead.
Tony had apparently found the backup generators' problem.
Crawling out of his sleeping bag, Peter shoved his shoes on and started looking around for the red-tinted shades Matt usually wore. After a moment he moved closer to Matt, shaking his head.
“The name’s Wade!”
“I…suppose I should trust our allies enough to take some time off—but an entire WEEK?” The blue eyed man groaned, rubbing his forehead and shaking his head. “Why couldn’t it just be a weekend?”
"Tony might know," Bruce said evenly, mixing some of the chemicals together. He looked like he'd rather be sleeping on his face on the couch right now.
"Uh, yup," he said, trying to look at the woman without, well, looking at her. That bikini left very little to the imagination. "Why?"
"Thor?" The injured Clint said, shocked. He seemed more disturbed than surprised.
"Capture? Thor will not be a prisoner," Doom said dismissively. "He will go willingly."
"Yeah, okay," Peter said dubiously, turning his back to the edge to face Deadpool. "It's nothing personal, but I really do have to get going. Have fun in Detroit." He waved and let himself fall off the building.
"Tony? Are you alright?" Pausing mid step, he placed his free hand on Tony's chest to hold him steady and Tony realized at long last that he’d remained quiet.
"I'm Tony, and that's Steve. Sorry, but how do you know Peter again?"
"Bruce....had it," Tony said, realization dawning as he saw the Hulk. "Oh, man. T-tell me....he sat it somewhere...before Hulking out?"
Dropping his sleeping bag beside one of the tents, Bruce ran his fingers through his hair. He glanced from Thor’s sunny smile to Clint’s scowl down at the coffee pot and fidgeted.
“Right. Loki,” Matt mumbled, blowing on his drink.
Hauling the kayak further ashore toward the rocks, Cap tried to gather his thoughts. No vacation had any right to be so intensely stressful and he hadn’t felt so unsure of himself in a long time.
“Oh, I called him about an hour ago. Seemed like he was having a good time,” Matt explained, extending an arm out toward Steve.
The others could deal with Loki. Clint needed a nap too. Taking a cue from Bruce, he laid down next to him and closed his eyes. He’d barely closed his eyes before he drifted off, his mind swirling with sleepy images of him and his lookalikes, arguing over Bruce.
He cringed. “Jeez, having an angry Hulk running around targeting your campsite must be terrifying as a normal person, never mind a normal BLIND person. We’ve got to talk to Hulk before anybody actually gets hurt, here.”
Clint watched as he left, eyebrow still quirked as he hurried after the bigger blond.
The man gave a gasp of both pain and surprise, and did indeed let go of the wheel to try and pry Cap's hand off of him. With no control of the wheel, the car jerked and hit one side of the tunnel so hard that it bounced toward the other, crashing back and forth.
"I-I'm not sure," he admitted finally, a bit dully. Defeatedly. "The other guy paid me a few visits...in a row. I lose big chunks of my days."
“I’m not sure friend is the right word, but yes. We associate. Mostly in masks. But why shouldn’t I get excited? The rumors about Captain America and Iron Man are famous. I never would have believed them myself. Seemed way too obvious.”
Wade surfaced, coughing and sputtering as he swam toward the shore. Matt’s glasses were nowhere to be seen.
“I’m Clint,” Hawkeye snapped. “Yeah, fine. Treasure. Whatever.”
Hesitating, the archer gave Bruce a quick hug. It felt awkward and he instantly regretted it, considering how they had wound up there in the first place. Breaking away, he led Bruce back to the demigod, an arm around his friend for support.
“Please. You think the Avengers would go after a blind guy?” Tony toasted him and took a sip of the coffee, the rest of the redhead’s words slowly sinking in. “…Wait, so he’s with Wade too? Seriously, I didn’t just worst-case that into existence?”
She was taller than him, with an Amazonian build that was barely contained in a strappy dark green bikini.
“This was fun,” Clint said sarcastically. “Are we done?”
Falling back to sit on the bed, Cap gawked at the screen as it changed to different angles of the same video. Even one that was zoomed out from a street camera.
"Oh, uh..." Bruce sat up and combed his fingers through his hair again. He probably looked like kind of a wreck...he hadn't stopped this project to shave in a couple days, either. And food? That hadn't even occurred to him.
Steve’s attention was focused on the frisbee game again for a moment as Wade caught Peter around the stomach and lifted him up to spin him in victory.
"That guy doesn't just 'freak out'," Tony said, waving a hand for emphasis. "I mean, I even TAZED him once and got nothin'!"
At that moment, Wade and Matt arrived behind Peter. Wade dropped his friend’s arm and ran to throw himself into Cap’s arms, fake-crying loudly.
"Warehouse?" Thor stepped over to Hawkeye's side, concerned. "But you have been here! TWO of you."
"Bruce, I think I'm in love wi—"
Pepper leaned on his shoulder again, lost in thought for a moment.
When the car seemed to have steadied out, Steve leaned back against the cage again, grabbing the man by the shirt cuff.
"Hulk, huh?" He murmured to himself. That was bad—very bad. How sandwiches fit into the equation was a mystery, though.
Thinking about it for a moment, Steve realized that he’d seen Thor and Bruce speaking the day before. Maybe Thor was the one to ask about WHY in the HELL he’d destroy Peter’s camp.
“I dunno, Tony said this was a low-tech beach. There might not be airplanes,” Clint replied, matching his tone.
“Really? Oh no, they think you’re a regular blind guy out here with Loki and lake monsters on the loose?” He smiled despite himself, leaning to hug Matt with one arm. “Now I get what Tony meant about it being lucky, you running into them instead of Loki. Did they even know you know me, or did they just take you back to camp for your own safety?” That did sound like something Cap would do…
"Please tell me you got that shirt from Hawkeye," Tony replied immediately, trying not to smirk.
Watching Thor head out the door into the rain with an arm already raised to catch his hammer, Peter turned back to Lola sheepishly.
"Okay, but what if I'm a clone?" They were in the hallway now, bare footed and padding slowly down the carpeted floor.
Bruce would have used the box if he had found it, so it wasn’t him. Tony and Cap had both demanded that he hand the box to Bruce—so they would have given it to him the moment they found it. Same went for Peter, who had been there for the whole tackle box conversation.
“Happens all the time,” Matt told her, flashing her one of his charming smiles. Lola smiled back, her hand lingering on the redhead’s arm. Matt turned his attention to Thor. “Is there anything you can do to make the storm less crazy at least? I’m starting to wonder if we shouldn’t give up and go save them.”
Wade canon-balled into the lake, sending a tidal wave of water crashing over Peter and Clint.
"Sir, I've been walking this direction since you last talked to that guy, so I didn't see where he went. Excuse us."
Now his brain had rocketed way past what he’d been saying to Matt. Oof.
Cap sighed and leaned a hand on Tony's arm shoulder for support, watching what the black haired man was doing on the computer.
In the blink of an eye, Clint’s feet were all Spidey could see as he tumbled over an abrupt drop off ahead in the tunnel.
It was then that Tony noticed something about his reactor. It swirled with a green glow. Seeing that Bruce was now awake and had green eyes, Loki slid off of the table and stumbled back to his bed, casting nervous glances in the scientist’s direction.
“He’s the person I’m looking for,” the man told them. “If you know where’s he’s camping, I don’t suppose you’d point me in that direction?”
Bruce blinked.
“They’re Captain America and Iron Man. It might be uncomfortable for them out there, but I doubt they need saving,” he said. “Have you actually seen Peter, or Thor? Let’s focus on the plan.”
"So Dr. Banner gets to bring along HIS hobby supplies," Hank said flatly, reminding them all that he was still there. He scooped up his suitcases again and sighed. "Jan wouldn't even let me bring a microscope, and those have been around for centuries, they qualify as 'low-tech'..." Still muttering, he trudged off to his cabin with the suitcases, shoulders slumped.
“I guess we should get back to our mutiny thing. I wonder where Wade wound up.”
“I’m sorry to interrupt,” a voice suddenly called out of the storm around them. The flexing of metal on top of the car told Tony that they weren’t alone.
“I figured if I stayed around, the two of you would find a way to ambush me.” Daredevil ducked back down to the luggage and dug for what Tony assumed was a pair of pants. “What do you want to know?”
“The couch is fine,” he quickly assured Peter. If Peter slept out in the kitchenette area, that left Cap in Tony’s room. Well, their room technically. After all the confusing thoughts last night, sharing a room was bound to be awkward.
This earned him an irritated frown from the God of Mischief.
