Tony smiled mirthlessly, looking down. "Yeah... and that was

Steve burst out laughing. "How can you remember that kind of things?"
"Nothing that comes out of you is gross."
What he hadn't anticipated though, was the reception it would have. The fan base was going crazy. The whole thing even made the seven o'clock news on three national channels and brought once again the couple to the spotlight.
He took it upon himself to think about the whole thing, settle his heart and wait until Tony had calmed down so they could have a serious, more serene discussion about it. In the meantime, he contemplated the studio with a virgin eye and couldn't resist trying some of those fantastic art supplies laid out before him. He felt a tiny bit bad about calling Tony out on the whole thing and then just shamelessly touch the supplies but he reckoned Tony would want him to use them anyway, so why not?
Tony grumbled and turned away from Steve to take a swig. Then he took a deep breath and sighed again. "I'll help move out." He rasped.
Tony poked at the few things lying around on his desk, obviously knowing they were Steve's. He touched them with so much respect and delicacy that Steve felt a surge of affection overwhelming him. He kept looking silently, staring at the future boards of the Avengers—at Steve's work—with admiration and genuine curiosity and then he turned around slowly, smile soft on his lips, happiness on his face. "This is where you work, right?" He asked but it sounded more like a statement than a question. "I love this place..." He added, voice faltering a little. There was no provocation in his tone anymore. "I wish I could have seen it before the new premises, though." He said, sounding a little regretful. "The very beginning... When SHIELD was just a bunch of amateurs with creative minds and bold ideas."
Steve swiveled around slowly and stared at him. "Are you actually
She sighed, frowning a little. Her gentle eyes turned serious. She sat down in front of him again and cuddled his hands into hers. "Honey," she started with a slightly intransigent tone, her usual assertiveness that made Steve huddle on himself. "What's important is that you're happy with the person you love, baby. And that you make them happy and respect them. Always."
"How am I supposed to know that?" Steve asked, not without feeling a little guilty. "We never see each other." And it sounded a little more reproachful than he had intended to.
"Such a formal greeting from my own flesh and blood."
him, to join them too.
Instead he climbed back up the stairs, went to the bathroom to take a long shower and rubbed his body thoroughly, then changed his sheets, emptied his bin, put on some clean clothes and went back to the kitchen. He pushed the door and sat at the table, starving as if he had been fasting for a week. His mum was making pancakes and his heart swelled with gratitude. He joined his hand in a prayer and waited for her to turn around.
Clint's eyes are lewd, Tony notices, and he's fidgety. And then Tony notices how his own finger has been sliding down Clint's chest, brushing his tense muscles with a knucklebone.
"I don't know what to do." He sighed, clutching Tony's shirt a little desperately, head resting on his shoulder.

You could have had it all."
A flash of pain ran through his boyfriend's eyes. "No." He let out, bluntly. "Are
He bites.
It didn't seem to plummet the guy's confidence, however. He inched closer, looking even more impressive up close—he had almost a head on Steve—and his grin spread on his face, even more determined. "You' Steven Rogers?" He asked.
"In what universe did you just get lost?" He exclaimed, slightly angrily. Steve blushed. He had never dealt well with being exposed like this and really felt like it wasn't a good time to get Fury pissed with him. He mumbled an apology. "Just answer the question, will you?"
He can't anymore. He has lost the right.
Touching each other like this feels so good and soon Tony grows hard again as he can smell the tinge of arousal spiking in the omega's scent. He wants to cherish him, his body and soul, and starts kissing him on his shoulders. He licks the gland and earns a gasp and a keening whimper. James's hands, even the metal one, tremble. His knees falter and he leans against the tiled wall when Tony starts kissing him down his chest and kneels down in front of him.
Steve leapt on his feet and stretched up. "Fuck you all."
Steve scrutinized him and remembered suddenly that Tony Stark was two years younger than the rest of the seniors. Somehow, at that moment, he
She certainly could. She was the scariest person Steve had ever met but that didn't mean it was a valid reason to ditch her at the party to come and rescue him. That was very inappropriate actually, Steve thought Tony had more class. "I can too." He mumbled unconvincingly, although currently it wasn't that evident.
"It's true." Steve insists, with a glimpse of forlorn hopelessness in his melancholic blue eyes. "I have been," he adds, looking away, lost in his thoughts, "for a long time."
and felt like a really bad friend.
Steve's heart clenched. So Tony hadn't left... but Steve knew what it meant, although he hadn't really been a witness of that yet. There were two main reasons for Tony to spend time in his workshop. One: He was busy on a particular project. Two: He was upset. Option one being very unlikely, since they had a romantic evening planned, Steve figured Tony had fled to his workshop and was hiding there, from him.
His eyes roamed the room and he stared at the audience. Everyone looked as perplexed at the news, except Clint who grinned goofily like a proud uncle. Obviously Clint already knew, Bucky didn't though. Steve's eyes glided toward Tony who was sitting on Clint's left. Tony had a profoundly melancholic smile. His eyes were soft and gentle, a certain happy confidence in his expression. He didn't look surprised either but not because he had been in the know, more that his suspicions got finally confirmed. He was staring at the future parents with a deep mix of pride, happiness and something else Steve wasn't sure to recognize...
unexpected.
Steve shivered. "That sounds a little stalkery..."
"Oh no! Not again!" Natasha groused, sighing boringly. She rolled her eyes and Bucky, who usually didn't enjoy to unload on his private life, seemed to take it as a challenge and started telling everyone about the first time he and Clint met. How Bucky and his band mates had set up interviews to find a frontman and how Clint had arrived right when it was over and they had already chosen their singer.
Tony chuckled softly, expression fond. "You said you hadn't finished decorating." He said amusedly and then added. "And yet, seven years later, it's exactly the same as it was then. Nothing has changed." He drank a swig from his glass of water and his gaze fixed the gray sky outside. The silence lingered.
They're finally complete. They're finally whole. They're
"Alright, I can't force you." She said with a incredulous face.
"All right." She said mildly convinced by Tony's explanation. "So everything that happened to you tonight happened with your full consent?"
Tony abruptly turned to him, looking at him sidelong. "What stays here?" He asked.
"Oh..." Steve exclaimed, confusedly. "I thought—with your experience." But most of all...did Tony expect
Steve rolled his eyes and shrugged. "Don't be ridiculous."
Shit.
Steve said nothing but he texted Tony.
"Good. I'm glad."
"Well, if you could have pulled your head out of that sand earlier, you'd have saved yourself, and
Tony thought about it. There was hardly anything he hadn't done before in the sex department, within the range of practices that didn't lead to permanent body damage. "My ass is off limit." He finally said.
Ten minutes later, they were at the school's hangout, staring silently into each other's eyes. There was something like concern lingering in the dark of Tony's eyes and Steve hated it.
"Kiss me." He whispered sensually, more sensually he ever thought he was capable of.
He should have realized this sooner.
"Come here." Tony says softly as he tugs on his wrist to bring him closer and brings his hand to his neck, brushing softly the reddish swollen bonding gland that still pulsates eagerly for him. He pulls the omega's head down and catches his confused lips for a gentle kiss. James opens his eyes wide but lets himself being manhandled.
"Do you still go therapy?"
"It feels weird." He said softly after a long moment. Steve turned his head to him and looked at the nonchalant silhouette leaning against the frame. He looked ethereal in the soft winter light. Steve stared at his profile, his features were soft and his eyes bored a melancholic expression. "Being back here after all this time." Tony continued. "We've got so many memories here. Good and bad..."
The question was innocent but felt like a dagger. Tony was suddenly thrown back into a world he thought he had been able to escape. He didn't think such a simple question could affect him like that. Not after all these years. He didn't think he would ever feel bad about it either. It must be the weed, and the alcohol, it makes him hypersensitive, all his senses are enhanced. It must be that, because his heart is suddenly racing in his chest and he feels a cold drop of sweat trickling down his spine. He shivers all over, although it's imperceptible. Too many things he wishes he could forget come back in flashes. He sits back in a jerk, trying to catch his breath. His head is spinning. He didn't want to remember...
"So..." Tony starts voice hesitant. "I got something for you..."
for contact. He wasn't even pretending.
How did he find himself in this situation?
"I've hated being omega. And yes, it used to enrage me this fucked-up situation that we're in but it's time we accept who we are, Tony. It's time for
Steve's voice is a little hoarse when he asks, probably pushing a hand onto the phone's speaker to smother the sound so Clint wouldn't hear their conversation. "You
"I don't need you to come and rescue me like my knight in shining armor. I can fight my own battles."
Each time they have made Tony smile for a little longer.
"You're smoking again?" He asked, wanting to make conversation but unable to keep the reproachful tone out of his voice.
Steve chuckled, awkwardly embarrassed. He shook his head. "Nah. He's not into dudes."
Tony chuckled in response. "What? And don't tell me he had a tiny dick," he joked half-heartedly, "'cause I kinda had the opportunity to get my hand on his crotch so..."
They were beautiful together, Steve had to admit, but there was something very wrong about it. Awkward. They were dancing together but it felt like they were fighting each other, competing for power and control. Natasha was a fierce alpha, Steve knew a thing or two about it, and he couldn't stand the fact that she could touch Tony, rest her head on his shoulder, just be anywhere around him. It was just wrong because Tony was... Tony was...

Steve looked pained but he helped him up on his feet without another word and Tony unexpectedly managed to stand up and walk, although his entire body hurt so much he felt numb.
Tony leans against the kitchen counter and stares at the others from afar. He can see Steve, smiling, and thinks he's beautiful. Something clenches in his stomach. He looks down at his empty glass again. "I could do with something stronger..." He croaks out.
"Sure." Tony whispered back, blowing warm air on Steve's mouth. "I'll be busy but yeah, sure, you can come." He gave Steve a little peck. "I'd be happy if you did," he added softly.
"I like it when you're rough with me, Rogers." He said after a while and it didn't sound like a joke, it sounded very serious in fact. He turned his head to him and his boyfriend was looking away pensively, expression still a little melancholic with tinges of nostalgia. "I used to need to be in control all the time before..." He continued while avoiding Steve's attentive stare. "but I actually like letting you take control. I like... when you dominate me and I think I'd like if you'd rough me up, as long as it doesn't hurt. I don't think I like pain actually. And I don't particularly care for being insulted either, or humiliated."

Although he can't really regret it right now, it was a very stupid idea because, now, both of them are stuck on the floor in this very uncomfortable position, knees hurting and his knot doesn't seem to want to deflate now.
Steve bites his lip to repress a moan when Bucky's hands are back on his belly and he nips at his neck. He licks the fresh wound afterward, sending another spike of want throughout Steve's body.
When it passed, desolation completely frazzled him. He dropped his entire upper body on his desk in despair.
"He's the best."
Tony's eyes opened wide for a split second before he burst out laughing. "Are you serious?"
"I think you could..." Steve answered after a moment of reflection. "But I don't think you would."
Steve hesitated for a moment, trying to discern the shape of the man he loved in the dark. "Okay." He finally said before dropping his head on the pillow and closing his eyes again.
Tony had just given Steve a valid and respectable excuse to leer conspicuously at his body for hours. He didn't do it purposely but his presence radiated seductiveness and Steve was mesmerized. He stared at the cute heart Tony's lips formed on his focused face. He stared at the manic movement of his pencil. He stared at the wrinkles between his eyebrows that made him look older than he was. He stared at the movement of his Adam's apple as he swallowed. He stared at the line of his neck and imagined what was under his shirt. He stared at the beads of sweat that were forming here and there and yearned to lick them off  his olive skin. And he drew the contour of his body and the shape of his mouth with imaginary fingers.
"Not even a small dildo from time to time? A butt plug?"
He wasn't sure what exactly yet but he
"Tony..." He whispered gently but his boyfriend interrupted him.
Steve put a strict finger on his lips and straightened up sternly. "No!" He exclaimed curtly. "You have a job to do, now. Remember? Job first. Reward later."
Tony dropped his head on his lap again. "Status quo until we do."
His heart was still beating a little too fast.
ago. I can't cancel now."
Tony Stark was by no means a brawler, nor was he famous to be a fighter. And he was definitely not buff. Yes he was tall—taller than Steve anyway, not that this was particularly unusual, everyone was—and yes, he was athletic but he was not the fighting type. He was actually famous for being good with his tongue and quick off the mark rather than good with his fists.
Well, he doesn't
Steve brought a firm hand on Tony's shoulder. "Tony, stop it! You're not like that..." He said with all his intent. "I mean, yeah, I admit... that at the beginning, things were a little fuzzy and confused. You didn't explicitly ask for my consent and we did things I never thought I would do before, and I was weak to your charms... but in the end, it's always been consensual. Because everything we did, I wanted it. I've learnt so much from you Tony, you're not the only one who's changed. I grew up beside you too... And I assure you that you
"Well now, they know I guess." Steve mumbled and Tony glanced at him fondly and chuckled. And nothing else mattered.
Clint brings a gentle hand to his face and cups it gently. "It's alright." He says reassuringly. "I don't know what's up with you tonight but maybe
you." He said, feeling less and less confident about this stated fact by the minute. "I just called you to clarify things and..." Steve hesitated, feeling a lump in his throat. "
"I guess that's when I started to see under the surface and got a glimpse of who you really were." Bucky explained in a rasp voice. "You have been so kind, and patient, and supportive. And you never let me down. I never expected this, from anyone, and least of all from a guy who wasn't even my boyfriend then."
Steve felt his cheeks heat again. "Stark's
a nice Indian place at the corner of that street."
"Your alpha needs you!" The omega growls. "What are you waiting for?"
Knotting James a second time is gloriously amazing. It's mind-blowing. And Tony will knot him again, and again until both of them lose the notion of time and place.
They were seated opposite each other in the library. Tony was deeply absorbed in his essay and frowned obscurely at his paper, mouth curled into a pout, his whole stance exuding profound inspiration and deep thinking. Sometimes he dropped his pencil and scratched his head, mussing his already scruffy hair. His breathing deepened then and he would inhale deeply before sighing concentratedly.
He deserved better...
He is standing in front of the nest, staring at the door. And for the first time in months he doesn't dare come inside. Something stops him from entering. Something like modesty, or shame, he isn't sure.
"Yeah," Bucky hissed, "don't be so overdramatic. There's nothing wrong with that."
" He pauses, staring at the confused alpha. "Neither can
It was Steve's threatening finger that snapped him out of it. "I want fucking answers, Tony." He growled.
Steve nodded, feeling a relieving warmth fluttering in his chest.
Tony laughed again, startled by the unexpected question. He sounded both a little amused and a little bitter. "Isn't that the kind of things my boyfriend should already know about me after three years?" He stared at Steve, eyes challenging, and with the same soft and loving smile and spoke with so much gentleness. "I'm still going." He finally answered, without waiting for Steve's reaction. "One hour. Twice a month."
was an interesting concept, he thought. He reflected upon the etymology of the word for a moment. The implications of the meaning wasn't something he really needed to get into right now.
"I have my apartment." Steve stated as an obvious reason.
And then Stark Industries came up with a limited edition of Iron Man phones.
Steve giggled behind him. "Not a tiny dick, no. Something much more irremediable than that."
"You deserve the world," Steve retorted, running his fingers in Tony's hair softly, "and I hate you for being so quick to give up on us."
Sam patted Steve's shoulder affectionately, a happy smile on his face. "Man, I should really thank you for introducing us. This is all thanks to you!"
Tony was burning against him, his skin a little sweaty, but both were them still in control.
How had he managed to do that? Steve was so fucking strong.
Fury was furious. "You need to stop disrespecting fans like that!"
Tony rolled away from Steve in a protesting whine and snuggled into the sheets on his side of the bed. "I'm taking the day off." He mumbled softly. "JARVIS? Cancel all my appointments for today. Tell Pepper I'm feeling unwell. I'm not getting out of that bed until tonight."
Tony didn't answer.
Tony leans forward and grabs his face, kissing him softly while Bucky keeps pounding into him. The knot expands, expands, expands and explodes inside him, inside
Tony is speechless and he can feel an inconspicuous blush creeping on his face. He hates the slightly condescending look in Loki's eyes but at the same time, his touch electrified him. Did Loki just beat him at his own game? He's a little puzzled and he doesn't know what to think anymore and he's much too high anyway.
"She's sleeping. Night shift..." Steve deadpanned without further comment. "Follow me?" He held out a hand to Tony who took it gently.
"But..." Tony strode to him, still looking befuddled, and Steve naturally let the laptop slide off his lap when Tony knelt down in front of him and rested his forearms on his knees, staring straight into his eyes, expression questioning.
submissive, indeed.
Tony turned his head on the side, eyes following the resolute voice.
Tony parted his lips and shivered with want. He happily complied and jerked himself off above Steve's mouth while he was stroking he spent cock slowly, still feeling high with pleasure. Tony came beautifully, his magnificent body trickling with beads of sweat, spasming and jerking as cried out a long groan and spurted white squirts of thick hot cum onto his face. Steve swallowed everything before Tony could have the chance to lick it off his face and smiled at his boyfriend happily while he was catching his breath.
"Oh. He remembers!" Steve snarked, making sure Tony remembered how much of an asshole he had been tonight from the tone of his voice. Tony swallowed and shut his mouth. What could he say anyway?
Pepper sighed for the nth time but he knew she was more amused than annoyed. Sighing was second language to Pepper and Tony had known her for too long not to be able to decipher the meaning behind every one of her sighs.
Steve buried his head in the fabric of his shirt and hummed in response, breathing in his heady sweaty smell.
He feels fine though.
"You got fucking raped and you're bleeding!" He yelled, looking shaken.
They both arrived onto the living area which was again very modern in its design, and practical, but welcoming  and comfortable—
Bucky freezes again. Those words reach to the deepest part of himself and he feels a wave of slick flush down. He's petrified but Felicia is still crying and...
Tony giggled. "I do listen and I do everything you want. I'm very obedient." He said in husky sexy voice.
He walked inside and put the cool box with their lunch on the kitchen counter. Tony followed behind and dropped on the floor the pile of folded cardboard boxes he had been carrying while huffing out a relieved sigh and catching his breath. The perks of having a much stronger boyfriend Steve thought amusedly. In a moment of weakness, Steve took pity on him and strode to him to give him a thankful peck on the lips. Tony's lips were wet with sweat and curled into a tired smile when they touched Steve's.
And say what? The
He's barely out of the shower when he can hear the car pull off in the driveway. He gives his head a short stroke, tossing the towel aside, and jumps into the first shirt and shorts he can find. The fabric is sticking to his wet skin and his hair is still dripping but he doesn't care. He rushed out of his bedroom and runs down the stairs. When he opens the door, Tony startles, a surprised glimpse of confusion flashes through his eyes, his fingers are still on the doorbell. He quickly recovers his senses though and a huge grin spreads on his face.
"I hope so... I want you to be able to work here."
His heart fluttered, his mind was on cloud nine. Steve had never ever pictured what was actually happening to him right now. He was still floating in the air, surely his heart had flown away with the butterflies in his stomach.
Suddenly all his instincts become knowledge. His doubts, certainties. His fears become strength. His hesitation, clarity. His fantasies become truth. His dreams, real. Every obstacle becomes a game. All he ever wanted disappears or mingles with Tony's desires. He doesn't know which are whose anymore. All he knows is that he wants Bucky and Tony wants Bucky and Bucky wants them, both of them, and his lingering jealousy fades and vanishes in the fluttering of a butterfly's wings. All the residues of spite and anger and doubt between them are
to want. The people I'm attracted to, the... the way I look."
And Tony isn't talking about a surname. It's much more than that but Clint understands, he thinks, because he nods silently, pinching his lips with a certain seriousness in his expression. He curls his arms around him and brings him closer to him, nuzzling against his neck a little. "You know what I'm thinking?" He says hoarsely. "I'm glad you could make it tonight. It feels like forever since the two of us could talk like this."
Steve retorted curtly. "What is it that you don't know? You don't know why you didn't stop them? You don't know if you
Clint's smile is gentle, slightly teasing. He hums softly.
There was a ding at the door and a man entered. Steve's eyes followed him unconsciously and he stared at him from head to toe, pausing halfway on his butt, amazed at how firm it looked in his pants. The man screamed alpha. Everything about him screamed alpha, from the shape of his jaw to the broadness of his shoulders, to the lines of his back muscles that Steve could decipher under his loose T-shirt. Even his scent, indisputable, smelt so strongly of alpha it made Steve dizzy. He shivered and felt a drop of sweat trickling down his spine, right into the crack of his ass. He swallowed as the man turned around, his coffee in hand, and salivated in front of his crotch, imagining what his knot looked like and what it would feel like in his hand.
Bucky rushes out the door without any answer to his existential question. He can't help it. If the alpha needs him then he has to go because that's what he's been programmed for, because that's what omegas do... And Bucky can't fight his instincts anymore. He's too raw.
He exclaimed, stuttering a little. Steve had to admit that it was really cute. "How? Since Wh—
Steve shrugged again. "I'm only gonna keep my oldest books. Out of nostalgia... But everything else, I can find it in the tower."
He knows he's pregnant and he feels the tears prickle at the corner of his eyes at the sudden entrancing realization of it. A surge of warmth and happiness invades him while his pup climbs onto his lap. He and Steve share a look. The blond omega is smiling blissfully, rays of light illuminating his soft features, hair golden with a happy glow. Is Steve pregnant too? Would he know if he was? After all, Bucky didn't realize until he was way past the limits for an abortion the first time. And now he already knows. Now he's sure and welcomes the news with a great, fulfilling satisfaction. He looks at Steve again and sees him watch the way his hand fondles his belly.
for other people, deep feelings. Feelings I thought were love at the time. But nothing like that... I thought I was feeling faint or something. I just... that was.... That was new and.....
"It's not going to work unless you swallow some of them, are you sure you wanna do that?" He said while laughing hard and watched Tony pull them out of his mouth one by one with a satisfied smug.
The gesture between them is very intimate and Clint's hand lingers on his hip and maybe Tony leans into him a little. Tony is always surprised at first but melts into it in the end because it's Clint and it's affectionate and it doesn't mean what people might think it means. And it might have started this way because Clint is promiscuous and very tactile and Tony tends to let other men—
Because that the third reason he can't leave the tower anymore. He loves them. He loves them
Bucky comes for the third time.
Tony abruptly turned his head back and glared at Steve, baffled. "Is that all that matters to you right now? Whether I'm gonna smoke that fucking cigarette or not?" He snapped.
"So," He said curtly. "said you needed my help? What exactly do you need me for?"
"It kinda of happened but... It was just casual, really.
Everyone started guffawing. "Oooh..." Bucky hissed. "Fierce woman."
"What about you, Steve?" She repeated. "When did you know Tony was the one?"
Tony can't let him go.
Tony smiles at him and looks at the small creases at the corners of his eyes. Steve has aged, he realizes, and he is now in his thirties, an accomplished man who knows what he wants and takes it.
is my home."
what happened." Steve whispered, heart racing in his chest. "Bucky told me."
"We saw each other last week." Tony answers matter-of-factly.
"Good for you." Clint said with a gentle smile. "That doesn't mean he wasn't serious though."
to share my heats with Alpha. It's the most beautiful part of being what we are! Why would you want to deprive us from that?"
"We saw each other a couple of time. It was just convenient you know. Nothing more."
She raised a slightly desperate eyebrow at him.
"But it's pouring outside." He explained and rushed to the window to glance outside. There was a dark silhouette in the rain. The boy lifted his head and their eyes met for a split second. "I'll be down in a second..." Steve muttered with a voice unexpectedly low and deep and commanding. He even surprised himself.
Steve's heart skipped a beat. He lifted his eyes to him, almost imploring. He was aiming for apologetic but his body didn't seem to agree with his mind. It was already a furnace in Tony's hands and Steve's brain hadn't much say in his actions anymore.
Clint gave him a fond smile. " 'Cause I thought you were hot and you were being a jerk. I just wanted you to acknowledge me." He took Bucky's hand in his and squeezed gently. "I was good, wasn't I?"
"We've had sex once." Tony blurts out casually, he doesn't even know why. "And I don't remember any of it." His voice comes out rasp. Maybe the realization stung a little.
"Get up." Steve ordered with a low hateful voice but Tony only reacted when Steve jabbed him. "Get up!" Steve repeated with more rage.
Tony shrugged. "Once or twice. He was good friends with Obi—adiah Stane." He explained and looked like he regretted it instantly. He shivered again, very inconspicuously, Steve wasn't fooled though. "My world is a small world, Steve." He added with a raspy voice. "We always hang around the same people."
Tony smiled again and rolled his eyes. "I'll never stoop to that."
"You're really persistent, you know." Steve protested, defeated.
"DON'T FUCKING FLEE AGAIN!!!" He shouted, but the elevator's doors were already closing on him and he was left here on his own, his body shaking with rage. He felt a shiver run down his spine and tears prickling at the corner of his eyes. He let them flow out and stared at the elevator in despair.
"Jaaaames...." he rasps, voice half a moan, half a possessive growl. The sound of it sending sparks of electricity in his entire body. He shivers all over. The alpha slightly arches his back and meets Bucky's light rocking. He exhales a long hum, half gone into alpha fugue. "Do it!" He whispers on the tipoffs his tongue, his tone almost inaudible but strongly resolute.
Sorry about that...
"Expecting an important call, son?"
And for you I'll charge thrice the price."
After a short while and still no news from Tony, Steve decided to look for him, see if he had calmed down. Besides, his stomach started rumbling and they were supposed to have dinner. A nice and fancy dinner from what he had seen earlier. Very romantic. And fuck this wasn't supposed to end up like this.
"Do you mind?" He snapped with a frown, slapping his hand away from the box. His boyfriend still took the apple and bit it. "I'm actually preparing the salad. Can't you just wait a second?" Tony chuckled, chewing on his apple while staring into his eyes, dark marbles twinkling impishly. Steve thought he was too cute to remain angry at him, however. He gave him a furtive glance. "What is it that I like?"
Tony was still snuggling against him, eyes closed. "No, we weren't." He admitted resignedly. He was still smiling though, expression amused and slightly bitter at the same time. "Apparently." He sighed. "I wish I'd gotten the clue earlier, though."
Tony knows he is blushing. The incongruity of it, the unexpectedness. Steve's eyes glint with something both tender and mischievous. He's handing the rose to him.
They both worked in the workshop in a rather lighthearted and comfortable silence. Him on his sketches, Tony on whatever it was he was doing that was important. A couple of hours later, as Steve felt himself doze off again and his eyes were tingling as he forced them open, he decided to go to bed without his boyfriend. He had been nodding off a few times while waiting for Tony to finish but apparently his boyfriend was nowhere near being done with his work tonight so he left him to it without regret. He was too exhausted for that. And it's not that it wasn't something that he was used to already. Tony always had a weird sleeping schedule. He straightened up and stretched his arms while yawning in exhaustion, walked to his boyfriend and left a soft kiss on his temple while he whispered good night to him. Tony hummed in response and mumbled a good night back. Steve's hand lingered on his shoulder and their fingers brushed as he headed out toward the glass-paned sliding doors.
Overall, it almost made his life easier in a way. He couldn't even say it bothered him the rumors going on about him being the football team's bitch or those about the weird foursome relationship he had with Buck, Sam and Clint. The thought was kind of disturbing but, to be completely honest, they had been thinking that before as well, just not out loud.
Tony was very distant at first but living together did all of them good. It felt right, being back here. The festering stopped and the damaged skin around his gland started to heal. After a week already, it looked rather like a bluish bruise with purple shades. It didn't hurt that much. After three weeks Steve was completely healed. His gland had recovered its round and rosy aspect and pulsated softly whenever Tony entered the room. His heart beat fast as well, and a wave of thrilling warmth pooled in his stomach, but he kept it to himself mostly. None of them was ready. Steve wasn't even sure if they would ever. What was important now was for the pack to find some kind of cohesion again. It was important for them, and for Felicia, to be strong and united.

Steve might have a point after all... Tony's head was spinning again. He felt nauseous. His throat hurt. He slowed down his pace not to bother him but his heart was racing, his anxiety was creeping up his chest until it all became overwhelming. He felt like crying and really wished he could. Crying would be so relieving. His entire body felt wrong. He needed to get out of it. He needed
"Do you think Steve would like flowers?
Tony cringed in outrage. "You know I'll never do that. I couldn't do that. I'd find something for you. I—I'll never let you down." Tony's hands grabbed his and squeezed tight. "I'll always be there for you, no matter what happens between us."
. It was stupid. And he knew it was stupid—Tony had been joking then— but he kept remembering those words like an everlasting threat on them.
"Whatever, Tony..." Steve said while glancing at him sidelong and gulped down his beer. "I'm not sleeping next to you."
"I bought it for later, to celebrate." Steve admitted, a little disappointed that he had ruined the surprise.
Everyone looked at them awkwardly. Natasha glared. Sam didn't react. Not openly anyway.
Steve's lips are still wet and his hair is dripping from the shower. The wetness remains on Tony's cheek, one drop of water trickles down his neck. Tony hesitates before wiping it off, partly annoyed by the unpleasant feeling, partly excited because it was Steve who left it there. The excitement is boiling inside. Tony feels blissed and ecstatic still, at all these short moments that have become part of their routine now. He's still feeling amazed.
"I'm not that guy." Tony repeated, voice shaky. "I'll never hurt you."
"Will those guys join?" He asked while glancing at the two men—that may or may not be dark-haired guy's buddies—dazedly.
He has lost the notion of space and time when Steve comes back. He hears Felicia babbling in her crib so he gets up from the couch but never reaches the door. Steve pins him against the wall and catches his mouth before he can even realize what's happening. Steve presses against him and grinds into his hips, powerful hands on his face. His tongue forces his way inside his mouth and it's hard... It is
Steve hated him a little. He wasn't just the perfect alpha, he was more. There was something about him. Steve wasn't sure what exactly. Just a feeling. Just a glimpse of a smile, or a flicker of an emotion flashing across his eyes. He was handsome, yes, from an objective point of view, he was. Steve could admit that although he hadn't really decided—well "decided" wasn't the right word, it was more like

"I'm going to the pool." James says with a soft and sensual voice. "Watch over her?" His eyes shine with something malicious and his hand lingers on Tony's shoulder, warm and penetrating. "I'm heading out." He says before Tony could answer.
He wishes he was a better man. He wishes he was a decent person. A better friend, a better omega. He's none of that. Were he all of this, he would have obeyed his alpha, got up on his feet, got the fuck away from here and locked himself up in the furthest bathroom from here to take a cold shower and jerk off on his own like he's supposed to. The only thing he manages to do however and keen desperately, thirsty and wanting.
"Oh yes." Tony rasped, mouth already reaching for Steve's neck. Steve shivered. His cock jolted in his pants, he was almost dripping already. His entire body was burning. Tony wasn't fair at all. They hadn't seen each other for four days at least.
Sometimes Steve imagined Tony pushed him down and pinned his hands on the floor and he felt warm, almost wet, at the thought. Tony's foot brushed his ankle again, insistently, and Steve gasped at the touch. He felt his skin prickling in his pants and wiped his clammy hands on them.
"Why are you still here?" Tony replied, tone aggressive.
"Let's go to bed now, babe. What do you say?" He suggested after some time. "We still have a couple of hour to get some sleep before we need to get up." And then he whispered softly, so gently into his tousled hair. "I love you."
Tony's eyes flickered again and his smile faded, only to leave place to a lewd eagerness. He was rolling his tongue inside his mouth. He hesitated a little before complying and turning over, arms and legs spread out on the bed.
Steve notices, because he drops the attitude and his smile grows worried. He brings a soft thumb to Tony's face and brushes it softly against his cheek, wishing Tony's anxious thoughts away. It works a little. "I'm sorry, Tony. I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that..." He plunges his baby blues in Tony's eyes, intent and determined, and licks his lips hesitatingly. Tony's a little bewildered. "I love you and... I don't care about anything else.  You're the only one who really matters to me."
Steve swallowed and stared at Clint with wide opened eyes.
"Strong enough?"
"Please..." He implored, in a heart-wrenching strangled whisper. "Please, don't ask me about it."
"Tony Stark, no less." Sam joked. "Aiming high, Rogers, aren't you?"
Going out of that car was the last thing Steve wanted to do right now but he braced himself and nodded while biting his lips. It was for a good cause indeed, one that was close to his heart.
Their first time happened on Steve's birthday. Everybody was out, busy celebrating independence. They had Steve's house for themselves all day long. It was a hot summer day and they were both wearing light clothes. They were both sweating, too, with the heat and with... something
Tony smiled but didn't answer and the silence lingered, although not heavy. He sipped his coffee slowly, blowing the smoke away.
"I think I'm omega." Steve repeated, voice a little less angry, tone a little more serious.
Steve's heart skipped in his chest but he ignored it, just like he had been ignoring the arbitrary fluctuations of his whimsical heart ever since they started hanging out together. Those moments were too precious to Steve to risk ruining them with confused and misplaced feelings. Tony's smile was warm and inviting but that didn't mean Steve could project his own wavering feelings onto him.
Tony snorted, eyes staring intently at him. "Sure."
"So you came, in the end..."
Kinda.
Steve didn't stop at this though. He's a persistent guy.
Tony had the smile of someone up to no good. "Are you into dudes?"
"Completely single." Steve deadpanned.
The guy brought a strong hand to the nape of his neck and pressed hard. The grip was a little possessive, like Obie's was and Tony shivered and melted into it. "So where do you wanna go then?" He asked while brushing his thumb on the skin of his neck. Tony startled.
"I have a date myself tonight, Tony. Remember? And I'd like to be able to finish work and plan my evening too. Have a good night!"
No it wasn't his fault. Steve was the problem. Definitely.
Tony jerked around and stared at him questioningly. "You're not going to keep it?" He exclaimed incredulously.
"Don't wanna get kissed." He whispered with a hoarse voice.
Tony chuckled and turned his face to him, plunging his eyes into Steve's, the sudden intensity in them unsettling. "Oh, I definitely,
"Thanks for coming through..." Tony added with a soft whisper. "I was glad you were here. I hate those things as much as you do, you know?"
"Fine."
"Will I be allowed to come down to the workshop with you? I love sketching there. I love watching you when you work."
And then they spread their nasty honey-spiced scent everywhere, taunting.
Steve pouted. "They weren't serious."
beautiful to see. They're gorgeous, both of them.
you, Tony. I chose you and I won't give up now. I'll tell you everyday if I have to."
Tony chuckled against the skin of his neck. "I guess I must have heightened senses, especially when you're concerned."
He's feeling restless though so he asks Jarvis to check on his alpha. From what Jarvis says, everything went according to plan. He feels ecstatic. He feels so fucking
It took all but two days for Steve to pack his bag and return to the Tower. It was such a relief then. It felt dizzying at first, feeling
He should have watched where he was going.
Steve is ready to go, Tony should go as well. He has been ready for a while actually but stayed to spend some more time with his boyfriend. The latter is cleaning up his space, rather quickly, and walks over to him on his way out. He curls a hand around his neck, caressing his jaw with a thin thumb. Tony loves it. He always loved Steve's hands anyway. That might have been one of the first things he noticed about him actually. Steve smiles at him silently and gives him a languorous kiss that warms Tony's entire body before leaving for work.
Steve tightened his embrace, kissed him back with an unconvinced though forgiving pout and groaned into his mouth.
Tony startled. There was something very wrong with that sentence and that particular voice talking to him at this precise moment at this very place. Since when did his dad move his lazy ass down here to see what Tony was up to for himself?
series came the roses. Red. Beautiful. Smelling like love. One for each day, rolled into a funny doodle. At the end of the week, Tony had a full bouquet in his living room and felt a lot lighter that he had been for a while. He decided he was finally ready to talk.
What a ludicrous idea!
Sam rushed in front of them and swirled around, walking backward as the three of them were heading to their lunch spot. He made a movement of his head, a goofy grin on his face.
"Mr Stark, Mr Stark, one last question please."
James is gorgeous and Tony really wishes he could fuck him the way he deserves to be fucked. But he can't. He wishes he could love him the way he deserved to be loved. And he can't.
"Chocolate goes very well with coffee, you know?" Tony yelled from the living room.
Steve was huddled on himself, rocking like a maniac. Tony wish he could hold him into his arms and take his pain away but he was toxic and no-one needed the likes of him.
"Are you gonna come in?" Tony said, tone slightly bossy.
He's partly aroused—because, yeah...
"What about her?"
Ten days.
"And then our eyes met," he said with a raspy voice, "and he saw that I was watching him and he blushed so beautifully I felt something flutter inside."
A shudder ran through him and he pushed his hands down his pocket to steady himself. "That's because we haven't found the right place, yet..."
Tony gave him an innocent smile, although his eyes glinted with mischievousness. He looked at his watch. "Well, it's time for lunch..."
"Yes."
Luckily for him, the only class they shared was English class.
Tony doesn't need any words from Steve to understand what the omega truly desires. Neither does Bucky. Although, he hasn't thought of the consequences of this. the alpha is so overwhelmed by the omega's reaction that he comes instantly in his mouth and is much too stunned with happiness to get out on time. He knots the omega's throat.
, a lot of trouble." Bucky added and Clint nodded next to him, supporting his husband at all cost.
At night he cries.
"Eleven." Tony said after a moment.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Steve whined, almost out of breath.
"What's wrong with here?" Steve insisted, pushing a hand to Tony's torso.
It's not a sex thing. It's everything
"No, I'm..." Steve hesitated, suddenly unable to see what was so evident about him before.
English class was not the cradle of literature anymore. No studying happened. No learning happened. Not from Steve's perspective anyway. All that happened in English class was long, callused fingers playing energetically with pens or scribbling on paper, decorating sheets and sheets of paper with an irregular and dynamic handwriting at an almost inhumanly fast pace. Long and callused fingers scratching the delicate skin of a strong neck. Those fingers brushing softly the short hair at the back of a scruffy head.
The words were worse though. Not that being called a whore and treated like trash had ever had any impact on Tony. Story of his life, really. They just sounded wrong in Steve's voice. They didn't belong in Steve's voice. They were forced out and heart-wrenching and his boyfriend looked like he was playing a part, like his whole body disagreed with it.
Bucky loves Steve. Not him. And
Tony's mouth opens on its own, gaping like a fish. "That's not what I said."
Steve felt a bead of sweat trickling down his spine. Heart still racing, he reached a trembling hand to get it back and nodded shyly. Tony smiled at him so tenderly Steve almost melted.
"Aren't you gonna take her home?"
"You've been spending a lot of time with Loverboy lately." Sam noticed. "Should we get worried about your cherry?"
Steve shrugged and made an unconvinced pout. "Not really, no. I'm gonna give away most of it..."
"I don't know..." Tony whispered softly. "I had to see him again." He raised his eyes again, looking at his captivated audience. "So, I..." He started, smile goofy. "So I slipped a note in his pocket, asking him to meet me at the back after his shift." He laughed at his own expense. "I had never done that before, really... I just, I was just a brat then, and I felt so small next to him." He looked up, face flushed and smiled at his audience again, eyes searching for Steve's. His lips parted when they locked into Steve's eyes. "I waited for two hours after his shift was supposed to end." He said in a teasing tone. "I couldn't leave." He added with broken voice. "I kinda was heartbroken and starting to despair when I finally saw him walking toward me, looking so proud and defiant. He seemed to be a bit vulnerable." Tony was still staring into Steve's eyes. As if he was only talking to him now, eyes challenging, and sad somehow. "That was the thing," he added, admiringly, "the major difference between the two of us, I guess... He was never scared of showing his weaknesses..." He made a pregnant pause before adding. "
He stares at the unbitten pulsating bonding gland of the omega, red with want and demanding. He stares at the way the alpha responds to it—nose flaring, baring his teeth, eyes hazy and unfocused—but never actually dares go for it. Steve wants to bite him himself, he feels the need to do it, an urgent, poignant need that comes from nowhere. Or maybe from the alpha.
On his first stop to the men's room, after Tony had washed his shaky hands—drugs did that to him sometimes—while avoiding his sickening reflection in the stained mirrors, he felt a strong-willed hand shoving him against the wall.
Clint gives him a dubious look. "Never?" He repeats skeptically, crossing his arms on his chest with that same unsettling certainty about them. He is standing very close to Tony and their shoulders touch. It feels warms.
Tony finally pulls away and stares down into Steve's eyes. A glint of lust and vulnerability is pooling in them but a huge grin is spread across his face. "Hi!" He husks out, titling his head on the side. His eyes are big, shining bright with joy and eagerness.
"I think," Clint started after a moment of silence, "that you're being highly disrespectful towards omegas right now."
"Isn't he
"They're really great, you know. I didn't know you could draw."
Tony tries not to let his anguish show up because today Steve kept the morning greetings short. His eyes don't lift up from his tablet. He will pretend everything is fine and normal and that the simple gesture didn't just overwhelm him, like it does every morning.
Tony squeezed hard on his hand one last time and turned around, smiling. "Interesting," he just said, evasively, and then his face brightened. His smile turning enthusiastic. "Let's go?" He suggested innocently.
"So," Clint continued, tone viciously teasing, "who's your first crush?"
Steve stared into his boyfriend's eyes and the world around them stopped existing, and the earth stopped turnings, and time stopped, and Steve stopped breathing. Something wavered in Tony's eyes. Something cracked in his stance. A glint of vulnerability. A glimpse of the real Tony, the one Steve might have fallen in love with yesterday.
Instead he looks down at himself, at his casual pair of khakis and loafers, and nervously pulls on his jumper. He looks like an old man. Tony never thought he could ever be underdressed but he obviously misunderstood something. There's a first time for everything he guesses. He feels a bit confused though.
Twenty minutes later, when James stopped shaking and whimpering, they can finally get free from each. No words are exchanged. James stands up on wobbling legs, pulls his soaked sweat shorts up and heads for the door.
Steve had a sudden, pretty graphic vision flashing in his head and let escape a giggle. He turned around. "You're not gonna try that, are you?"
as an artist, too. No-one else had ever wanted to buy my art before. I mean no-one I didn't know and... And I didn't wanna sell it at first but then, I..."  The words died down on his tongue before he could say them, maybe he didn't believe himself in what he was saying. He felt the tears prickle at the corner of his eyes but smothered them and swallowed down the lump in his throat. "You wouldn't understand anyway."
Steve looks melancholic but still determined. "You know, Tony. Before I went into the ice, I was promised a dance. I never had that dance. And I—" He hesitates, voice faltering. "And I've been wanting to do this with you." He finally whispers. "I've been meaning to ask you teach me how to dance for years and I never did and you never offered and years are passing by but I don't to have regrets. I've had a second chance at life. I don't want to waste anymore time. Please dance with me."
"Alpha..." Bucky mutters in a warm and sultry voice.
The omega looks at him, eyes pleading. His entire demeanor begs him to take him right now. He's struggling too, against their nature, Tony can feel it. He should get away from here this instant but then the omega whimpers and more than his arousal, it's his distress Tony can't turn away from. Sexual urges he can control but fighting his protective instincts to the point of rejecting comforting the omega when he is in such a state of distress, he just can't.
Loki chuckles. "I guess
Tony's face paled and he withdrew his hand as fast as he had put it, like he had been burnt. Horror distorting his features and then the pain, pooling in his eyes. "I'm so sorry, babe." He whispered, out of breath. "I'm so sorry." His hands were shaking and he started fidgeting. "I—I—I—I'm not like this." He choked out, stuttering. "I'm not this guy, Steve. I'll never be, I..." He stared into his eyes with shame, anxious and self-loathing. "I just wanted to kiss you." He let out in a shuddering sigh.
It just came out of nowhere. Steve raised bored and skeptical eyes at him. Where did that even come from?
Fair enough.
