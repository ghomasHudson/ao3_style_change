"okay, thanks for letting me know. Bye, Steve." Happy says, and the phone goes dead. I slip Tony's phone into my pocket for now, before shifting to find a comfortable way to sit.
"thats- very graphic." Clint laughs. I wander into the bathroom and quickly slip on my new gear, before wandering back into Natasha's room. Natasha has a group of 'friends' that she seems to have a lot of casual sex with I
"could you maybe have told me that Agent Coulson was in my apartment?" I ask while I change, Natasha still laughing on my sofa.
"Its a material that Stark invented - I don't think he has a name for it quite yet but he wanted the best of the best for you." Iron Man tells me as I zip the tight fabric over my torso. Its less bright than my last uniform, which I am very grateful for. it looks less like a costume and more practical for battle, which is honestly perfect. I button up the trousers, before pulling on the hood, which is now more like a helmet with a bit of breathable fabric to cover my nose and mouth.
"at least let me help you out of your armour so you don't end up impaling yourself anyways!" I yell, running after him. We end up working in silence, him finally letting me help when he realises it would be harder than it looks.
"Natasha, was it your dumb decision to bring someone who looks so ridiculously attractive to a gay bar?" A man questions as another glass is placed in front of me 5 minutes later.
"wait- Tony you ass you just ran me into a tree- " Hawkeye is a particularly vocal mario cart player. we all knew he is competitive - he gets like it in the field, always trying to shoot the most amount of bad guys.
"yeah sure, but first let me at least make some sort of sling for that, it went through bone for gods sake." I roll my eyes at the man, and begin digging around for something to use.
"yes, I am. Steve Rogerson." I say with a sigh, holding my hand out to him as my eyes dart over to Tony.
"okay first off, Steve Rogers stopped Red Skull, and technically the tesseract disintegrated him, but more importantly, do we even want to kill the thing?" I ask, leaning back against my motorbike and watching as it grazes at some grass, trying not to look awkward about Natasha's obvious attempts to make me feel awkward.
"yeah Hawkeye had them, but they were on 2 different streets, so one was always open, and what you did wasn't
"okay." I say, walking towards the bathroom. "hey Nat, thanks for coming to sort me out." I sigh, looking back at her.
"haha yeah as if. That guy is even more of a car crash than me." He says, rolling his eyes. "anyways, the whole Steve thing was probably me trying to justify me- well liking you and all that I guess."
"okay Tony what the hell? Stop being an idiot." Nat says, standing up and making her way towards him.
"okay brilliant - I may as well keep wearing the old suit around the place so I don't get stuff down this." I think out loud.
"I knew my Cap, and thats all that mattered to me." he says, his eyes meeting mine as he takes a few steps closer. "and if you didn't care who I am, we wouldn't be in this damn situation!"
I wander downstairs the next morning in the hunt of a mug of coffee for Tony, and one of tea for me, and find Clint and Natasha chatting in the kitchen.
, is this man pretty. I instantly feel bad, Tony popping into my head. I know we aren't actually dating, but I've always felt bad if I have a crush on someone and I ogle someone else. it just feels wrong to me.
"why thank you, kind sir. you look good too." I say with a laugh. "you want a top up?" I offer, nodding to the drink in his hand.
"Jeez, you sure you're not a super soldier?" he asks in between breaths. I scoff at that, heading over to the light and turning it off before grabbing his hand and leading him to the edge of the room, sliding down the wall.
"you're missing a shirt, I'm missing trousers. I don't know why you're complaining." he tells me, crossing his arms, making me laugh as I walk towards the elevator.
"and this is why its a bad idea to walk directly into heavy fire, Steve." Nat tells me sarcastically while dabbing at my cut with some gauze. I wince, causing her to punch my arm.
"oh sorry I forgot that you knew everything there is to know about structural engineering." he responds, tensing up as the building shifts again. I laugh, knowing by now not to take offence from his sarcasm.
I left pretty soon after the party, suddenly feeling very out of place for some reason. I stop by a shop and pick up a few bottles of booze on the way before heading back to my apartment.
"I'm fine, it was light." I say, the dark allowing me to pull my hood off. "how the hell are we going to get out of here?"
"I'd gone so long.." He mutters, sniffing lightly. "gah, okay we've talked about my problems too much for one friendship. hows Steve?" He asks, standing straighter and wiping his eyes.
"I think I would rather stay at my apartment. its a 2 minute walk from Tony's, and I wouldn't have to wear a metal suit all day." Iron Man says, him seeming more serious and a lot less chatty than normal.
"I was thinking about saving your life! I saw the building was about to topple and I was trying to get you out!" He bites back.
"hey at least if things go sideways with Tony you can explore this whole Iron Man/Cap thing. I mean you'd have to keep your helmets on which would be a bummer.." She rambles on, her grin slowly getting bigger as she annoys me more.
"aand, you must be Steve." Tony says, turning to me and taking a seat in between us. I send him a puzzled look about how he knows my name, and I see Natasha grin out the corner of my eye.
"thats because they're either on the other side of the world or dead." I say without thinking, before mentally facepalming. "one of them died in a car crash." I say after a minute.
"God, the police need to stop calling us the second civilians are involved." I joke, sitting down in the seat next to Clint.
"I'm really not sure. I mean obviously Natasha is trying to set us up, I mean I got that just from the naked photo that Nat showed iron man, but I wanted to hear what you wanted." He says, honestly quite surprised from how far this Tony is from the one from the tabloids, which makes me kick myself a little. of course the tabloids only show a slither of Tony, and I know that. I splutter at the mention of a naked photo, very nearly spitting my beer all over Tony. that would've REALLY killed the mood.
"so what? he wants me to get with someone else?" I ask, my voice coming across a little harsher than I wanted. "sorry, I'm not too good at this whole dating thing, I'm just a little on edge."
"Captain, pleasure to meet you." Tony says, holding his hand out for me to shake after placing a piece of Nat's black widow outfit down.
"okay, thanks Tony for actually showing up, that was very kind of you." Fury says, nodding at Tony sarcastically. "you are very welcome." he responds with a grin.
"here- this will be more comfy." he tells me, throwing a balaclava style object at me, made of some breathable material. I wander into his en suite, pulling my hood off and replacing it with the hat. I walk back into his room to see that he has one on too.
"well, as much as I would like to carry on this conversation, I should probably go and get dressed, got meetings today with the Avengers about their uniforms, and its almost an hours drive." he tells me, placing his mug in the sink and walking back into my room. I pull out my phone after he's left, and sure enough, theres a message from Nat telling me my time for seeing Tony, one thats starting in 1 hour. I decide to have a quick shower while Tony is getting ready, and I step out of the bathroom to see him shrugging his jacket back on.
"okay so you are lacking confidence? come on, let me sort you out." she laughs, handing me my shirt. 10 minutes later she has styled my hair so every single strand lays perfectly, before coming at me with a pencil.
"thats true, but you owe a hell of a lot to Iron Man." she says softly, causing me to fall silent. I know she's right, but I'm sure as hell not admitting that to her. "okay I'm done with this softly helping you bullshit, this has never been the way I work. You've got to get your head around that this is happening, Steve. What you need to do is hop in the shower, get into some Steve clothes, and get your ass downstairs. I'm going to go and chat to him, make sure he is alright."
"No, we just came by to drop off this folder. Its got some background information on some other powered people and something called the Avengers Initiative." Coulson says from behind me, making me spit out my water and drop my towel.
"aww you made him blush!" Nat tells them, coming over to lift my mask over my cheeks, poking them both before pulling it back down, all while dodging my attempts to stop her.
I walk back into my apartment at 6:30, sighing and flopping down onto the sofa. I really did try to make my apartment look modern when I was decorating, but it still ended up looking like it came right out of my mothers house. I kind of love it though - its so tiring trying to catch up with 70 years of life, and having a place where I can go back to being Steve from Brooklyn is a big help. or maybe it just reminds me of Bucky.
"maybe I should give it a go." He laughs, his position relaxing slightly. I quickly grab my shield when I see someone sneaking around the corner, quickly taking them out. "thanks sweetcheeks." He says, pulling me in for a sideways hug before taking off again.
"you didn't want to go? I thought you had similar friends to him." Tony asks quietly, sending me a tentative smile.
but, I dunno, he seems hesitant maybe." I mutter, leaning back again. Suddenly the avengers alarm begins to beep, making us both jump into action.
"yeah sure. although it might be worth us popping out to get it - theres this really nice pizza place down the road that does take out but not delivery." Tony tells me, giving me puppy eyes.
"Steve! hi." He says, placing down his screwdriver and bottle before heading over to give me a tight hug.
"I don't know. I mean, Nat set us up, and I thought it was going well, but it just seems like this isn't what you want, but you're keeping me around to not hurt my feelings, or to make nat happy or something." I say, regretting saying anything.
"uh- Iron Man um- he said that they got on well is all. just wondered if Cap said something." his eyes going wide as I appear, me suddenly realising I have no shirt on.
"it literally went through bone." I tell him, not too surprised that he doesn't want to go to the hospital.
"So things didn't work out between you and the girl?" I ask, softening my tone a little. He scoffs at that, opening one eye to smirk at me.
"thanks man." I say with a laugh, taking a sip of my drink. "To be honest I have missed this place."
"where the fuck did you guys go? you just literally disappeared." Clint says as we walk back in, the three of them carefully placing the pots on the table.
I slowly walk towards the door, pulling it open to face Tony. Tony who look ridiculously perfect, of course. He's wearing a pair of faded jeans and a short sleeved band top, the design too faded to make out, over a long sleeve tshirt, which he has rolled up to his elbows, the scars on his arms from the workshop more visible in the sun.
"yeah I honestly thought they were two different people." Clint says, "do you think we should tell him he just outed himself to Hawkeye?"
"don't worry about it, cry for as long as you need." I say, putting superstore on, a TV show we've been watching together.
"oh yeah just amazed by all of this." I say, waving my hands around uselessly. "I mean Cap tells me about how amazing it was to see Howard talking about his flying car that basically blew up after a few seconds, but here you are, having made 3 robots and and AI, all of which having their own personalities!"
"ah you little fucker." he mutters, glaring at the bot, which makes me laugh. "that'll do, you bag of bolts." He says, pushing the bot away. I watch as he interacts with the bots as if they have personalities, and soon I realize, they do. I guess it'd be easy to see them as just robots, but for Iron Man, and probably Tony too, they're family.
"Tony hang on, I just wanna talk, I'm not blaming you for anything." I say, watching as he slams back his drink, before grabbing his jacket.
"wow Stark really didn't leave much to the imagination." I say as I turn around, Iron Man getting the hint to turn around too.
a year sober, but I was feeling like drinking so I went to see Tony and he was already drunk, going on and on about Steve." He tells me, leaning heavily into my side. "why were you drinking?"
"anytime. its what  friends are for, after all." She laughs, grabbing a black sac. I have to admit, the shower made me feel a lot more like me, like this is something I can get past. I get changed into some jeans and a shirt before brushing my teeth, then going to help Nat. By the time I get out there the place is basically clean, and 2 big bags of rubbish are sat by the door.
"who woulda guesses - Captain America is caring as fuck." He says, leaning back against a work surface.
"okay so I have literally no games, so lets play truth or dare." he tells me with a grin, sitting cross legged on his bed before patting the place in front of him. I just grin, folding my legs underneath myself.
"you slipped up, you'd had a hard night as it is. I'm proud that you came to me, I was so surprised you had the control to do that. Please, don't beat yourself up." I say, naturally wrapping him in a hug.
"So this is a good idea." Nat says as I shut my door, her deciding to just pack the stuff she has at mine, because she sort of claimed the room meant for 'Captain America'.
"oh, okay tell Happy I say thanks." I begin unwrapping my hands, dropping the bandages into my bag. I decided to work out for a few hours to pass the time until Tony gets back. I head upstairs and jump in the shower, hearing the lift open just as I step out.
"yeah, no problem." I say, standing up and stretching my arms out, before following him out the door.
"yeah. hes such a baby about it though, I'm only doing it because I'm trying to sort him and Tony out." She says, earning a scowl from me.
"just because you never said it, doesn't mean it wasn't there." She says quietly, letting her hand drop.
"oh yeah sure, I'll message him and let him know you dropped it off, he'll be glad to have it back." I tell him, an easy smile on my face.
"fuck." I stutter when he breaks away, his hands quickly pulling off my shirt before working on his own. his hands return to my chest when I pull him back into the kiss, mine freely exploring his back. his hands slowly slip down and begin on my jeans, before my hands stop his.
"yes!" Tony shouts as my character crosses the finish line, dropping my controller and holding his hand up for me to high five. he gently links his fingers with mine before using it to help him climb over the back of the sofa, landing half in my lap.
"staring rather hard there, sweetheart." Tony says, and I look up to see a smirk dancing over his mouth.
"are you okay?" A voice asks from the corner of the room, causing my eyes to snap to him. My hands instantly go to my face and when I feel the lack of material I sigh.
"I'm sorry Tony." I say, walking out and straight up to my room. I ignore Natasha's questions as I begin packing, letting the task of folding up my clothes dull my brain.
"why? my god you like making things difficult for yourself don't you. Just have him be scarce because of Stark." She suggests, me nodding my head at her.
"Just remember that he doesn't know its you, okay?" she tells me, letting go of my shoulder. I wordlessly break out into a run again, stopping dead when I see him, pieces of the armour around him, Clint doing CPR.
"lets get some sleep, and lets talk about this tomorrow." I tell him pulling him with me as I stand up.
"oh I'm not surprised, I'm shitting myself." I tell her. "I wasn't good enough for him as Steve Rogerson."
"I don't know, just thinking. Not to freak you out, but you're not a supersoldier, we could die down here, what is there to lose now anyway." he says, before chuckling. "well, I guess it would be hella awkward if we had this pre death honesty shit then both survived." I chuckle at that, leaning back against the wall.
"On the booze already?" I ask Tony when I find him, leant over a table with his back to me, a screwdriver in one hand and a beer in the other.
"I'm a super soldier, I'll be fine." I say, hissing when Nat pokes the still healing hole in my arm.
"I was in a house full of Avengers. that is mildly intimidating." I laugh. "there isn't anything going on between Cap and me by the way. I mean he does lean in that direction, but he's like my brother, it would be weird."
"I'm free for the next few days, so yeah, I'll need to sort some stuff out so I'll come over tomorrow?" I offer, smiling at him.
"I shove my hand in his front pocket, feeling acutely aware of how awkward this is, and quickly dish out his phone.
"Oh hey Cap, kinda busy right now..." he says, his hands waving to his bare legs and his shirt hanging loosely off his torso.
"Steve! its been a while." Pepper greets me, pulling me in for a hug. "I see you got at him with the eyeliner." She says, turning to Nat.
Tony ended up passing out on my shoulder on the way home, so Nat and I carried up to my apartment before she took off on her motorbike. Now, I'm lying in bed, staring shamelessly at the sleeping man next to me. Its not like I just straight up got into bed with the man, I put him down on my bed and he refused to let go, mumbling about not wanting to drown. I may have misjudged him. from what I saw last night, the man portrayed in the newspapers is very different from the true Tony Stark. Yes, he's got all of the personality traits they mention, but somehow he has this amazing personality trait that just makes those things work, and makes him a great person to have a conversation with. I would be lying if I didn't say he's attractive, he's got a perfectly trimmed beard, his normally perfectly gelled back hair now falling over his forehead, and amazingly large eyes, but when you look past all that you can see evidence of his job. he has amazing arms, his body (from what I can see of it) is littered with small scars, and probably the most obvious, the shining blue light in his chest.
"Look Tony, I'm sure Natasha explained but you know me. the real me." I say after a moment, looking down at my hands.
, you just wanted to be the hero like usual, which ended in me having to drag you out to safety, and the main guy escaped!" I yell.
"well you can't blame me - people weren't interested in me when I was all gross and skinny, then I got the serum but you know, the war and stuff so I didn't get much of a chance to get close to people." I say, blushing slightly again.
"Okay, Nat mentioned she has introduced you to Steve, I'll get him to give my hood to you the next time you see each other." I tell him, starting on my trousers, until I'm left in the tight boxers I wear underneath my suit.
"couldn't. he'd end up getting stabbed. what are you doing up this early, oh stevie boy?" Nat asks, raising her eyebrows.
"I know you can't see my face right now, but fyi, I'm glaring at you." He says, shifting in my grip.
"good." I say, letting my hands fall to his hips as he gently kisses me, but we get cut short by another crash.
"Fuck. are you okay? what the hell were you thinking?" I ask, sitting up only to hit my head on something.
"Steve, you know like Steve Rogers?" I respond, matching his smile when he makes an oh shape with his mouth.
"well, the serum had kept me in stasis. they thawed me out, gave me a haircut and a new wardrobe and I look nothing like those old poster." I explain.
"Not feeling it with girls at the moment for some reason." He says with a grin, finishing off his coffee. "okay so I'm holding this mixer for Stark Industries tonight, and I was wondering if you wanted to come with."
"Don't you think thats a bit irrelevant? he could die Nat." I say, shoving my hand off her shoulder.
"No it wasn't me you had the one night stand with." I snap, looking up at him and watching as his face goes blank. "oh shit I'm sorry I- I didn't mean- yeah, I'm an asshole." I mutter, running a hand over my face.
"oh- uh yeah, although he will probably eat out - no doubt that Nat has texted him." I laugh nervously, slipping out of the door and scaling the side of the building, slipping into my bedroom and pulling on my Captain America suit, before heading back out. I quickly stuff my bike helmet over my head, before walking in.
"Tony, come on, you know it has never mattered to me who you are, I cared about you." I say with a sigh, dropping my bag and walking closer to him. "But we barely knew each other, really. We didn't tell each other so much because we wanted to keep it secret."
"well in any case, if you don't go and see him, he's going to think you regret the kiss." She says, standing up and handing me my hood.
"oh yeah he told me about the whole unicorn thing." I pull off my sweats before pulling on my jeans.
"Can we just appreciate how gay your hands are in this photo, though? you're shielded from the camera, but at the angle that Coulson is at, he can literally see everything." Natasha laughs, zooming in. I groan, leaning back.
"yeah he actually was a big help when I was training to become Cap, he was always a very willing sparring partner." I lie effortlessly. Tony makes a small sound of interest, before calling out a stream of numbers to JARVIS.
"sorry if I ended up on top of you last night - I tend to cuddle up to people when I'm asleep when I'm sharing a bed." He laughs, slowly waking up.
"yeah no shit sherlock. Get something long, I'll talk you through shifting it." he says, breathing quickly.
"Hey. surprised you're not with the girls." I joke, smiling at him. He just opens his mouth, before closing it again, his eyes raking over my body. I pretend not to notice, looking towards the floor.
I storm out of the room, leaving the duffel on my bed and pulling my hood on. I sharply rap on Tony's door, the man pulling it open a few minutes later.
but they're all so scared of her that they wouldn't spread my secret, so its just easier for me to tell them.
"what can I do for you this fine morning?" I ask, my voice deepened with sleep. Its weird - I'm using my Cap voice way more than my Steve voice nowdays, its almost becoming my natural voice. Its been a week or two since the basement, Tony moved into Iron Man's place and gave Iron Man and I his floor, which was odd because I had to act lost for a few days while I 'got my bearings'. Iron Man and I have basically became a married couple - Natasha likes to joke about it a lot. I mean I don't have a clue how dating works nowdays, so I've been taking him out for the dates I know - walks along the beach, picnics, that sort of thing.
"is this you trying to tell me that you're actually Tony?" I ask, with a grin, trying to pull him away from the whole Steve thing. this is wayyy too close for any sort of comfort.
"Hi its Steve? I was out with Tony tonight but he got a little drunk so he's staying at mine for the night. nothing weird, just to sleep it off." I tell him while trying to get Tony into his seatbelt.
"why thank you kind captain, now would you mind helping me get my arms out of this damn suit?" he asks, holding out his arms. I  smile, taking hold of the zip on his outfit.
"made me a battery oil milkshake then spilt it all over the engine I was fixing up." he tells me, giving the robot a disapproving look before returning to tidying up his work area. "I'm surprised they're so all over you for the first time meeting you. I mean Dum-E is no surprise, he's more like a puppy than a robot, but U is usually more shy." he nods to Butterfingers, who takes it as permission to leave the corner and proceeds to race over to me, making me laugh again. of course I know the exact reason why they are comfortable around me, the second that I showed up at the tower as 2 different people JARVIS has had a sort of dry, sarcastic hint to his voice, like he's amused that Tony is so oblivious. to be honest, I think if Tony didn't constantly have 20 things on his mind, he would have known it the second he had Cap and I in the same building.
"you're right, I probably wouldn't have. I'm maybe being a little reckless, I just went through a bit of a bad breakup." I tell him.
"holy shit, that is one way to sober me up." he says, falling back into the sofa and making me laugh.
"alright, Imma go watch some TV so I get sleepy. I wander down into the kitchen area, pulling my hood over my head as I go. I put the kettle on, before making myself a tea and leaning back against the work surface.
"one sec." I say, shoving it over my head. beside me Peggy rolls her eyes, causing me to laugh a little. "you're all good."
"you say, while I sit next to someone who literally fights people in a tin can?" I laugh, turning my head to nod at Iron Man, still wearing his helmet too.
"okay, fair enough. We'll talk about this some other time though, yeah?" He responds, his voice a little less strained. "also I'm shutting my eyes so you better be too."
Iron Man is dating Cap. Its way easier to face him as Iron Man." I explain with a moan. suddenly my phone starts buzzing, so I fish it out of my pocket and answer.
"no, as Tony knows who I am I gave him my things yesterday, so I'm just here to pick things up. want me to give him your hood?" She asks, nodding to the piece of cloth in my hand.
"Tony, you cannot blame me for throwing something at someone sneaking through my window." I say with a sigh, picking up my shield and propping it up against the wall. "are you okay?"
"hey Nat." I say, wandering into our room the next morning and stopping dead when I see a man in Nat's bed.
"How?" he whispers, which intrigues me slightly. this isn't a side of Tony that I've ever seen - he's always had a slightly jokey overtone to everything he's said. I don't respond, not really understanding the question, but instead I let one of my hands slide up his chest to wrap around the back of his neck, tangling in his hair. his breath hitches as he moves in, gently pressing his lips to mine. In the background I hear the ding of the elevator doors opening, but it barely gets registered in my brain. he pulls away, both of us catching our breaths.
"chill out, big green, its fine." He says, just as said unicorn spears him through his shoulder, its horn breaking through his armour like butter and its mane now glowing a fiery red. I run over to Iron Man as he collapses on the floor, holding his shoulder up. I'm not really too sure what to do, its not like I can put pressure on the wound or anything.
"yeah that can be a real turn off." I say, playing along. "although maybe it could develop into a kink? depends how hot this guy really is."
"thats hard to do when your slightly sociopathic friend is attacking you with a pencil!" I shout back, sitting up when she climbs off me.
"I can't believe we've been being such idiots this whole time." Tony laughs, rolling his eyes. "can I interest you in a drink?"
"oh please. there's no way he'd notice you! just give me one chance, i'll be there to make it non-awkward, it'll be super relaxed." She tells me, leaning against the side of my car.
"ugh thats boring. glad you made it here tonight, you and Cap don't know the definition of a break. You know him and Iron Man are like a
"Steve that is a bit of an overreaction, even for you." she says with a sigh, placing a hand on my chest when I try to leave. "how can you think that he doesn't love you just as much as you love him, after everything you've been through?"
"and you're very nearly naked. wow." she responds, her eyes going wide and her hand motioning to the fact that I just have a pair of tight boxers on. "you guys remembered to use protection right?"
"Cap hey, didn't think you were coming." Iron Man says sitting up in his bed, waving off the nurse that tries to push him back and adjusting his mask over his face.
"well Nat would be terrifying to date, no to Clint too as Nat would probably stab me, sex with Bruce would be - interesting - so I guess that leaves you, spangles." he says, causing me to laugh.
"well of course, sweetheart." he says with a smile, placing a dramatic kiss on my cheek through the fabric of the balaclava. I smile a little as he walks off, biting back a blush unsuccessfully. After a second I make my way into the kitchen, flicking the kettle on before putting a mug in the coffee machine Tony bought me after complaining about the instant coffee I have in the cupboard. I quickly gather up the bottles from last night too, knowing Iron Man has a problem that I really don't want to trigger after last night. Iron Man walks back in a few minutes later, wearing just a towel and his balaclava. I chuckle lightly at the sight, shaking my head.
"okay. you ready?" I say, grinning at his confused expression. I pick them up like I did in so many shows on the star spangled tour, before doing a pirouette and putting them back on the ground.
"one: that would pressure him into taking his off, two: he's Tony's closest friend for fucks sake." I say, scowling at her.
"So we had to deal with the bloodthirsty unicorn and then deal with Nick Fury, trying to explain why 2 of the team members were skipping the debrief, while you two were cuddling?" Natasha asks, walking in.
"yeah. he literally walked past me with his hood off last night - look I'll show you the security cameras from in the lobby." he tells me, walking over to a monitor.
"that chair looked so uncomfortable I was starting to get twitchy." he laughs, his hand resting on my arm. he flips it over, running his fingers over the skin of my wrist. "I can't believe I didn't notice." I look up, letting my hand capture his to still it before surging towards him, our lips meeting in a kiss that was all teeth, him slowly falling back onto the pillow. I move away after a moment, resting my weight on my elbows.
"eh I'm not scared. you can't show Tony without telling him who I am." I say, grinning at her before digging through my drawers.
"why not just tell her you're the original 'man with a plan'?" Clint asks from where he is perched on top of my dresser.
"hey, are you sure this is not because you're tired and missing your boyfriend?" I ask, placing my hand on his cheek.
"Cap may be sexually repressed, but you sure as hell aren't. are you forgetting the first few months after you woke up?"  she scoffs, rolling her eyes.
"ah okay." he says quietly, his arms working their way around my torso, making me smile. Iron Man is always so soft and pliable in the morning - quite similar to how Tony is actually.
"yeah no problem, I had a good time. you want a lift?" I ask, walking into my room and pulling out some clothes.
A while later, maybe 2 minutes, maybe 2 days, I don't have the brainpower to care today, someone knocks softly on my door.
"oh." she says, placing her hand on my arm. "I love Tony to bits, but he get spooked so easily when you begin to want any sort of commitment from him. think it was his dad."
"to be honest? I think I'm going to throw up." I laugh nervously, taking a seat in the plastic chair by his bed. He just laughs, turning to face me.
"yeah I know, but he got called out on some pretty urgent SI stuff, so he's asked me to make sure everything is alright with your suit." I say, walking over to where I left his suit.
"ugghhh my head is killing mee." Tony groans the next morning, rolling over and faceplanting my chest. Its weird sleeping in Cap's room, I mainly just use this room for storage. "why do people drink?"
"basically. I have my own place where I officially stay, but I like to help Tony with his work." he tells me, wincing as Dum-E stabs him with the needle.
"okay, ignore what this is, because we both obviously don't know, what do you WANT this to be?" I ask after a minute, swallowing the last bite of food.
People are due to start arriving any moment, and I'm still pacing my room, my dress trousers hanging off my hips. Nat went down to check on Tony a while ago, so I have somehow gone into full scale panic.
"I was handling it, you were meant to be covering Nat and the Hulk!" I tell him, turning to face him.
"well Iron Man took a photo of it for me, and he just said I have something to show you, so if you blame anyone blame him." He says with a grin, obviously loving watching me being so flustered.
Its been 4 days since I last spoke to Tony. Nat thinks I should go back to Brooklyn, even if she doesn't say it, probably because I'm spending all day just moping around. I've only seen Tony a couple of times, when he emerges for food or water, before slinking back into his lab. even in those moments I see his cold expressions, his lack of care, and it ruins me all over again. I'm currently curled up of the sofa with Nat and Clint, some cheesy rom com playing on the TV that I'm not watching. the door slams open after a minute, Tony stumbling in, clearly very drunk. What makes my stomach churn, however, is the woman tucked under his arm, giggling as he runs his hands down her side. He barely gives me a glance as they stumble past, me not able to move a muscle.
I carefully place the pile on the ground, feeling a little weird about changing with someone else in the room, but begin to strip anyway, turning my back to Iron Man for a little more safety.
"about 20 minutes." I say, placing my sketchpad by the side of my bed. I haven't drawn since before the war, so it was nice to pick that back up again.
Hes noticed too. He's been taking me out on dates a few times a week, giving me worried glances when I'm not looking. Tonight is was a private tour of an art gallery, us now having a few drinks in a bar near the tower.
"aaand you're now my favourite person in the world. congratulations." He says, wrapping both hands around the mug and closing his eyes.
"I, on the other hand, understand. well, Stark did, he explained it to me. Very impressive, Banner." he says, flopping down onto a chair.
"you're going downstairs in boxers and an undone shirt?" I laugh as I pull on some tracksuit bottoms.
"he says, while brooding. why not just call him?" she asks, turning to face me and crossing her legs.
"yeah." I mutter, plastering a smile on my face as the doors open again, the room already filling up.
"why not? I mean you kissed me. was it that bad of a kiss?" he jokes, but his eyes are full of hurt.
hadn't have gone against what we had planned. I mean, technically that someone was me, but I saw a way to rescue the hostages.
"Tony is going to be speechless. I'll see you guys around." She says, smiling before working her way back through the crowd. I scan the crowd for Tony, expecting to find him amongst the girls, but quickly finding him leaning against a far wall, a drink in his hand.
"Tony I'm seeing someone else." I say, straightening my back as I hold Natasha's arm tighter. "have a good evening." I say as we slip past him, finally letting out a breath when we hit the elevator.
"this is the normal time I wake up. this was the army timetable of the 40's." I say, putting the kettle on.
"I'm sorry Steve, but his mask is going to come off, and he wouldn't want it to happen in this way." She quickly explains.
"what do you mean?" He slurs, looking up at me. its sad really, how conscious he is. you can tell he's really drunk, but he can still function, is still good at hiding it.
I ended up having quite a boring day, all in all. most of the time was spent reading the huge folder Coulson had dropped off, which included information on Natasha, Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye and Bruce Banner, which had a small subsection about the Hulk. I'm guessing he's being called in as a scientist with Tony Stark, as the Hulk section seemed to mainly be about how to calm him down.
"So you're actually, properly attracted to me, or were you just saying that at the time?" He asks, as the doors shut, leaning against the railing.
"Captain, a pleasure to meet you. i'm JARVIS, Mr Stark's AI." A British voice calls out, causing me to look around. I remember when Howard's dodgy wheels that made cars fly was the most amazing thing, so this is kind of blowing my mind.
"STEVEN GRANT ROGERS HOW MANY TIMES-" Nat shouts as I run towards someone shooting at her, taking him down quickly. I stand up to smirk at her, making her punch me in the arm.
"yeah. I actually met Tony at one of the  heart clinics and we ended up getting on well. He gave me his arc reactor to power Iron Man, but also to help my heart too. the guy is a pain in the ass, but I guess I wouldn't be alive without him." he tells me, looking down slightly.
"Its no problem, I like being your friend." I laugh, wrapping my arms around his shoulder. he burys his head into my chest, a soft sob shaking through his body. I don't say anything, just run my fingers through his hair to calm him down.
"Steve. a meeting started 10 minutes ago, but you weren't at the tower. where the hell are you?" Coulson asks down the phone, causing me to sigh.
"well she's not wrong." I say, smiling when I see how similar our positions are - curled in a ball, eyes everywhere but each other.
"nah just take me to Tony's tower, JARVIS can stitch me up." He tells me, shrugging and wincing silently at the motion.
"yeah, I was stupid to show you that really." I laugh, thinking back. "but you still didn't answer."
"okay, now I'm lost." Clint says, furrowing his eyebrows. "I'm guessing that was a joke, I just can't figure out whats funny there." Clint says, his eyes slightly glassy.
"Tony you aren't a nuisance, to be honest I spend too much time with Steve anyways - I tend to not sleep here too often, its mainly just where I keep all my stuff. please, don't worry about that sort of thing." I say, correcting my voice as it comes close to slipping back into Steve's.
"can you be quiet? I need to sleep, and I've heard too much of your whining for one night." Natasha grumbles from the other side of the room, causing me to chuckle.
"well I hoped that you would have had an idea, Man with the Plan. I mean you killed the red skull, a unicorn should be no problem." Nat says. grinning at me.
"The material is waterproof and does well in a washing machine, also you'll want to keep that one on so you don't have to change each time we get called out."
"I like what you've done with your hair, by the way." Nat comments, running her fingers along the now shaved sides.
"don't you want your hat? might run into some stray hawkeyes." Nat says, throwing the hard fabric at me.
"Thats a shame - I'm sure you guys will figure it out though, he's like your Bucky Barnes." I freeze up, my head shooting up at that name. I hear Tony chuckle at his comment as if I'm underwater.
"don't laugh - I pretend to call him like once a day." I say, rolling my eyes as he bursts out laughing.
"She might not be the same. Shes- well shes old. she forgets stuff. let me go in first, I'll need to take off my mask and have a chat. I won't tell her who you are, just that I have someone." Iron Man tells me and I nod in response. while I wait I grab 2 teas and a coffee, before taking a seat outside the room and waiting for Iron Man.
"I- didn't realise you felt that way." I say, shutting my eyes. "I do too, by the way, just thought that you didn't."
"yeah, Tony, I loved you, then I loved Iron Man. I'm mainly just fucking confused right now." I admit, running my hand through my hair. Suddenly Tony pulls me into his arms, his head buried into my shoulder.
" I- wow I guess so." I say, leaning back against the wall. "I mean, I still really care about Tony. I just- I like Iron Man."
"staring pretty hard there, darling." I say with a smile, mimicking his works to me the morning after the night he was passed out in my bed, making him chuckle.
"Getting a little tuckered out there Cap? I mean, you're are doing pretty well for an older fellow." he jokes, walking closer to face me.
"thats fine, Iron Man, however I would suggest revealing your identities if you're doing this team thing - it would make everything a lot easier." Fury suggests, looking at Hawkeye, Iron Man and me. Tony has been typing on his phone for the last few minutes, and just as he puts it down my phone bings. he instantly looks up, making eye contact with me from across the table as I pull out my phone.
"uh yeah okay I guess I could bring Steve, he stays in his apartment too much." I laugh, walking out his room.
I wake up suddenly, keeping my eyes closed and my body still as I figure out why I woke so suddenly. I soon feel it - a sharp poke on my cheek. my eyes immediately snap open and my hand comes up to grab the object responsible, Natasha quickly moving her hand out of my grasp.
"sadly I have meetings for the best part of today, but I get out at 4. wanna be my date to a horrific marketing banquet thingy I'm being forced to go to?" he asks.
"the gala was like 2 weeks ago, Steve. Somethings been worrying you for that long?" he asks, turning to face me.
"ah sorry, he's just one of Nat's hookups." I respond, laughing lightly at the fact that he thought Clint is Hawkeye. I've known Clint quite a while, even though this morning was the first time I've told him I'm Cap, he was one of Natasha's first frequent hookups. "known the guy for a while now, theres no way."
"I was going to get drunk." he tells me, turning his head to look at me. he's told me about his old habit before, telling me about how he was a year clean before he broke up with his boyfriend.
"you walked past Iron Man and Tony, and they're a pair of nosey buggers, so hacked into SHIELD." I tell him with a laugh, rolling my eyes at the man. "Natasha I can't believe you let me out myself to Hawkeye though."
"wait Cap, you've watched a whole film in that thing? you must be dying in there" Nat says, flopping down on the sofa next to me, flicking my helmet. I roll my eyes at her, leaning back.
"yep, the layers just keep on coming." he tells me, grinning. I just laugh at how proud he looks for coming up with that. A minute later my phone starts ringing, causing me to jump into action.
"CAP OMG you ass!" he says, hitting my chest before relaxing again. "hey, where is Steve? I thought he lived here too?"
"okay, are you going to tell me what really is going on with you?" I ask as I hand him his drink, sitting down on the sofa.
to Tony Stark." I practically growl, all the emotions from when he cheated on me bubbling back to the surface.
I walk into the kitchen one night, grabbing myself a glass of water before sitting down on the sofa. a while later Iron Man joins me, his actions slow.
"come on, I need a shower but after we could get a take out and put a film on?" I suggest, flicking off the lights.
"no I haven't broken any ribs, I'm honestly fine. How about you? I noticed your leg was stuck." he says, his hand ghosting over my shin.
"ran into an old boyfriend." I say, grabbing another bottle from my bag. "it doesn't matter anyway, I can barely get drunk."
"okay well tell me if you do want to stay here for a while - I have a huge tower its not like I'm short on places to go." he tells me with a smile.
"you idiots owe me big." Nat says as she approaches, pulling me in for a hug. "why do you both have your eyes shut?"
"alright - I'll let Tony know. He's been a nervous wreck all morning." He laughs his metallic laugh.
"Captain, its good to see you." Bruce says with a smile as I walk in, standing up from the sofa. "How is Steve?"
"And I thought we were idiots before." he laughs, running his hands through his hair. "so hang on- are you Steve Rogers or Steve Rogerson?"
"I'm sorry that I hurt you." He calls after me, making me stop in my tracks and turn to face him again.
"we barely saw him for the first couple of weeks, but the last week he's been acting like nothing is wrong. it was odd, it just happened one day." Clint tells me, taking a drink of his beer. We end up staying at the bar for a couple of hours, before we decide to head back to the tower. I let them go ahead of me so I can go and change back into my suit and pack. about an hour later I'm pulling up outside Stark tower, taking a deep breath before walking in.
"I blame Nat for taking that damn photo, and Coulson for having a habit of standing quietly in dark corners." I tell him, returning to my meal, my cheeks still hot.
"Okay, we can talk about something else. Steve's okay I think, we don't really- talk." I say, rolling my eyes for the dramatic effect. its funny - Its become second nature to me by this point to pretend like Steve is someone else.
"theres no escaping it, and it makes you look hot so deal with it." she tells me as she begins outlining my eyes with the scratchy pencil. After that she smudges it a little, before standing back to admire her work. "perfect."
Its from earlier today, after I got out the shower and Coulson had scared me. My face and all down my chest is bright red, my eyes wide, my towel mid fall and my hands - luckily - reaching to grab it and covering up certain parts.
"which is something I will never do. I mean maybe I could have done if I knew we were going to be actually dating - but I've made friends with him as Cap now, I'm in way too deep." I laugh, stuffing some clothes into a duffel, setting some aside to wear.
"no you don't listen - they haven't fallen out, they were both being idiots and thought the other didn't like them, which I assume you've figured out?" Nat says with a grin, walking casually into the lift. I press my fingers gently to my lips, sending Tony a cautious glance, him smiling at me when he catches me looking. I smile back, dropping my hand to my side.
"Steve I was just coming to find you." Tony says, stumbling into the hallway. "Are you- I don't think I've seen you cry before. are you okay?"
"Okay I'm just confused where you guys are." I say, turning the joysticks on my controller and watching my car turn aimlessly.
"Good to finally meet you, Captain." Bruce says, holding his hand out. "I watched the clips of you fighting - I honestly wouldn't be able to tell the difference between you and the original Captain." he says, smiling as I shake his hand.
"that. but more importantly - is this a permanent style change? we going for the edgy cap?" Iron Man laughs, while pointing at a unicorn.
"thats really what you're thinking about right now?" he responds, his hands shifting where they're on my chest, trying to help with some of the weight.
"so this is about living arrangements. after the whole unicorn thing, we realised just how lucky we were that Cap was still in the area, which brings me to why you're here Tony." Fury tells up, raising his eyebrows at Tony.
"so you live here with Tony?" I ask after a moment, suddenly vary aware that we basically broke into this guys house.
"I think its because he's ashamed of how he reacted to Steve." he tells me, turning to face me. "so why are you up at 2:30?"
"hiya." he says, slipping into the room. "just coming to let you know visitor hours are almost over."
"oh my god, so are you." I say, standing up to quickly stand in front of him. "god, why didn't you just come see me?"
"Cap what the hell you're going to fucking kill yourself!" he shouts, pulling the nearly empty bottle away from my lips.
"just wondering why you're bringing this up now of all times is all." I say. He's been actively avoiding talking to me with anything more than small talk since the night he came over to mine drunk.
"yeah but I've got my old one on me. Sorry about that Tony quip earlier, I've just been spending too much time with Steve." I say, pushing myself faster as the building comes into view.
We end up chatting for hours. Iron Man messaged me telling me he was going to get a bit of shopping, so I decided to stay a little longer.
"I know how it feels. I ended things with my boyfriend a while back, I was being an idiot." he laughs. "I don't know why I'm even talking about this with you."
"I mean, yeah, you kinda did." I say, a small chuckle leaving my lips as I try and hold back a tear thats trying to escape.
"thats why I'm leaving, so we stop hurting each other." I say, watching as more tears fall down his cheeks. he looks down, trying to hide them.
"you okay? you sound out of breath." Natasha chimes in, a grin in her voice. I decide to ignore it, opting to worry more about why she can hear.
"hey Nat. also, what do you mean? you can't get STD's?" Tony asks, looking very confused about the whole situation.
I have to say, Iron Man's suit is much more advanced than I thought it would be. I mean yeah, I knew it would be good - Tony did build it after all, but it was like fighting a regular human - the suit is tight against his skin, allowing for a full range of motion, plus all the bonuses of being in full metal armour.
"I haven't visited because we kissed and you know his track record - just barely better than Tony's was. also I have a severe lack of injuries from holding a whole damn building up, also I held a whole damn building up. how the fuck am I meant to explain that?" I say, raising my eyebrows right back at her.
"I fly around in a high tech tin can and break multiple air space laws monthly. I think I can handle a fast motorbike." he laughs, adjusting his hold around my waist as I push the bike further, weaving between the lines of traffic.
"Its fine, Pepper, I was an idiot for thinking that he wasn't with anyone else. I'm just going to head home, Cap is going to meet me there after he's all packed up." I tell her, climbing on my motorbike.
"Not even going to take me out for dinner first?" I ask with a grin, briefly forgetting that I'm not Steve Rogers. oh well, I guess Captain America would be confident anyways. Tony glances over his shoulder with a grin, before returning to his equipment.
"Its just the mission. theres some hydra thug that keeps stopping us in our tracks. the guy is totally teenage heartthrob, apart from his tendency to kill people." Tony tells me, making jokes to cover up his worry. Tony has visited a few times since I've left, mostly just stopping by to chat. its surprisingly easy to have a conversation with him, given our history.
we end up playing truth or dare late into the night, it slowly becoming primarily truths, ending with us passing out together on his bed. we continue the game the next night, and 3 nights after that.
"well then explain this. Tony helped me hack into SHIELD - no don't give me the wrinkle of disapproval - and I found a room in SHIELD headquarters that, before yesterday, was home to one Clint Barton." He explains, his voice showing how proud he is.
"well I threw up out of panic then Iron Man found me so I said I'm going back to my apartment to get some rest, but Steve is still coming." I say, bouncing my leg.
"this can't be right." He says, hesitating before making his way towards me, slowly peeling my hood off. "fuck."
"depends. don't worry yourself too much cap, I'm not going to post them or anything." she laughs, opening my door. "see you tomorrow morning, we're wanted at the triskelion at 9." she tells me, with a nod, before shutting my door behind her. I sigh, wandering over to my fridge and pulling out an egg, before making myself some breakfast.
"oh jeez." she says, pulling my hood over her head. "yeah this cannot be fun all day every day." she laughs, pulling it off her head.
ah shit. yeah, I had completely forgotten I'd told him about that. "what? no I don't drink." I laugh, glad that I had tidied up earlier. "you came by mine really drunk, talking about god knows what, then we went to sleep." I tell him, focusing on pouring my tea.
"what even happened between you two? Nat told me that you told him about the whole thing, but Tony has been locked in his workshop all month so no one really knows what happened." He asks, looking around the room.
I sit at the bar, nursing a scotch so I don't look as awkward, watching Tony get grilled by hundreds of reporters. every now and again he catches my eye, sending me a wink before launching back in to answer more questions. at one point a girl comes up to whisper in his ear, which makes me nervous, i'm ashamed to say, but I don't have time to dwell on it before she is making her way over to me.
"oh by the way, Fury is having Stark host some avengers fundraiser/sorry for destroying half the city party tonight. Stark has me tending the bar." he tells me, rolling his eyes.
"okay, well then I guess I don't think I can." he laughs, standing up. "look, let me go and get my bearings a little, I'm going to talk to Natasha, but I'll be back."
"What? Natasha, can't you see why that might be a bad idea?" I ask rhetorically as I place my shield in the car.
"oh yeah?" I respond, leaning over to look at her phone. If she wanted opinions on boys it would have been easier to ask me when we were alone earlier, and she knows I have no clue about girls, so I have no idea what this is all about.
"yeah that'd be really great." he says, rolling onto his side and wrapping his arms around my waist loosely.
"Nat got me this - said she was going to bully you into coming." He laughs slightly, wincing at the movement in his chest.
"okay I'm coming now." she says, opening the door and linking her arm with mine. I take a deep breath before stepping around the door, my eyes instantly meeting Tony's.
"you are such an asshole." she says, pulling me down through the hatch and watching as my back slams against the floor, causing me to groan. she just nods, walking back to her room. I begin to sit up, Iron Man running to help while laughing his head off.
"ugh why am I doing this?" I moan, flopping down on my bed and pulling off my hood. Natasha and I ended up needing to share a room, but I don't mind too much. apart from her creepy expressions while sharpening her knives, shes a pretty good person to be near most of the time. she likes her own personal space, which means she respects yours, shes very tidy because of her training from the KGB, and she knows me well enough for me to not feel self conscious in her company.
"I'm sorry." I mutter, placing my hand on his arm to get his attention. "I just know you don't see me the same way I see you." I mutter, turning to pick up my bag.
"ooh lets see! I know Stark's taste in men." Iron Man says, standing and running over. Natasha shows him and I very nearly curl up into a ball and die.
"this is the strangest way I've seen anyone help someone with Mario Cart." Nat says from where shes sat cross legged on the arm of the sofa, snapping a photo of us while still navigating her character flawlessly through the course. soon enough my character zooms past Bruce's where he's moving in a slow yet out of control zig zag pattern.
"ah its no problem, you should know that. the dude pisses me off a lot too." He laughs as Clint hangs up.
"It feels great though - the mouth part is so much more breathable than my hood." I say, stretching my body out.
"I know you could have, but Happy was free, and I do pay him to do things for me. we're leaving at 6:30 by the way, so we can get there for seven, so I wouldn't bother getting into normal clothes." he tells me, heading for the bathroom. A few minutes later I hear the shower turn on, so I take off my towel and get changed.
"you up next?" I ask, pulling my hood off for air. It gets surprisingly stuffy in that thing. Its something they just made for me quickly when I got out of the ice - its based off of my old old outfit, which was basically just a pair of tights and a balaclava, but instead the fabric also covers my nose and mouth.
"What the hell was that??" I shout, pulling off my gloves before throwing them down onto the island. we just got back from debrief after a mission that should have been easy, if
"I'm fine Steve." He says slightly harshly, chugging the rest of the rum before leaning back against the table.
"hey Nat, people are arriving so we're going to need all hands on deck without spangles here." Tony says through the door, causing both of our eyes to look over.
It was chaos. by the time I had sat down, there were already 2 drinks being placed in front of me, one of which I gave to Natasha.
"It may not have occurred to you, but I was saving your ass!" Iron Man shouts back, his suit making some worrying sounds.
"yeah but I was on patrol. Nat has told me she wants to take me somewhere, so would you mind telling Steve that I probably won't be back for a while? may as well crash with her so I don't have to keep wearing this around the place." I laugh, packing a bag.
"of course sir." JARVIS responds as we slip off our shoes. I move my pile of pillows and blankets on the sofa out of the way, giving us room to sit.
"sorry, I didnt think before asking that one." Clint says, his voice dropping back into its normal register.
"It matters to me, at least. it matters to our team too. You're more than what the public thinks of you." I tell him, turning to look at him to see that hes already watching my face. he leans in slightly, pressing a gentle kiss to my lips. I just freeze, all rational thoughts going out of my head as I pull him closer, deepening the kiss. he climbs over to straddle my hips, pressing his body against mine.
"hey Steve, where are you off to?" Clint asks as I hit the lobby of the building, sympathy in his voice.
"yeah. She basically insinuated that you wanted me to hook up with someone else while you were busy, and I haven't done this before, this whole dating thing I mean, so do I ask to be the only person in your life?" I ask, watching his expression become unreadable.
"He was worried about you, I think. He wants you to have a good time." she chuckles, taking the seat next to me. "to quote him, 'theres a lot of attractive men here that have been keeping an eye on him'" She laughs. I just roll my eyes at that, not really too sure what to think.
"what did you say?" she asks, her voice soft. "come on, lets go for a walk." she says when I'm silent for a moment. We head out to the gardens, wandering around until we find a bench.
"Steve, I've been trying to give you space but that just isn't working anymore." Nat says from behind me, causing me to roll my eyes. I knew this would be coming soon.
"haha yeah, I guess so." I laugh, it sounding a little forced. luckily he doesn't notice, causing me to shake my head and run a hand through my hair.
Its 2 weeks later and I still haven't asked Tony about what Pepper said. But I need to. I've been more hesitant, every time I touch him theres a small part of me that wonders
"Steve, that doesn't matter anymore. Look - Tony felt like shit for what he did to you. you need to tell him." she tells me, causing me to peep at her between my fingers.
"she saw her friend being an idiot. look - he's going to think its all over if you don't go see him." she tells me, a little softer this time.
"I'm going home. Cap will be back in a few days, I just need time to collect myself." I tell him, sending him a smile before walking out.
"exactly! its a unicorn for fucks sake, lets just ride it somewhere or however it is that unicorns work." Iron Man says, walking towards the animal.
"yeah well I mean the overall physique of the guy, and I've never seen you two together before. although I think it was because its the obvious lie." He laughs, watching as I search his face.
"I mean I guess, it does make sense, although there is a high chance I'm just in shock." He responds, smiling lightly. "oh my god, that means you kissed aunt peg!" He says after a moment, sitting up.
"Fighting in this is going to be interesting." I mutter, mounting my bike and roaring off in the other direction.
"I liked you, but at the time I was thinking you were Steve so I was telling myself I was just sympathising for Steve with the whole Tony crap." He tells me, coming to lean next to me.
"no, he reacted well actually, but I realised that I wasn't good enough for him before, only Captain America was. I just couldn't do that to myself again." I tell him, watching a girl walking up to Tony. "There will always be some girl, and if I'm just
"What? no, Tony would literally murder me! Steve would never take Tony back I'd bet, but the guy still feels very guilty for the way he acted." He tells me. "also I do not have a
"you may be a super soldier, but right now you're a injured super soldier, so shut it." she tells me, punching my arm again. "okay you're done - go get changed."
"bye." I mutter after he has left, before quickly shoving the clothes I got out back into my drawer and pulling the Captain America suit out of my wardrobe. After getting changed I place the hood on my kitchen counter, before downing a pint of water. When I pick up my hood, however, a piece of paper flutters off the surface.
