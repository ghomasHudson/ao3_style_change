Both men opened their mouths to start to talk, but before they could, a screen flashed, and all attention was brought to the prison cell camera, in which was Loki, slowly laughing to himself, as he if knew he was going to win.
“If you get all this done before dinner then yes we can.” Tony replied, a smile spreading across his face. He loved spending time in the lab with Pete almost as much as Pete did. “For God’s sake Natasha will you turn that down?!” he shouted across the hall, earning no reply from Nat’s room, but a small shout from downstairs.
There was a stunned silence in the room, all eyes on Natasha. Steve broke the silence and spoke first.
Steve and Tony both looked at the boy Natasha had brought with her, with such protectiveness Bruce backed down, clearly intimated by the pure strength of their love for her.
“You will not address any member of HYDRA without being directly addressed first. Women are weak, and below all men. You will fulfil your duties and service whomever desires.”
“Ahaha. You think I would let you see her? Now why would I do that? No, I want to make you suffer, as your interference made me suffer.”
“I’m sorry, but the AI has been deactivated for today Mr Rodgers-Stark.” A cold, quiet voice behind Peter said, his accent thick. Russian? Peter was so disorientated, he couldn’t tell. “Come quietly, your sister is already waiting for you.” Shoving Peter off his bed and out of the door, not caring if the 14 year old got hit on the way out. Peter’s enhanced hearing picked up the start of a car, actually, it sounded more like a van. Tears welled in his eyes at his unpredictable fate, as he was pushed into the back of a vehicle, hitting both his head and his shin on the van. He whimpered, and a second body was pushed into him.
Peter looked around at the orange land which stretched as far as he could see. His body was numb but he could still feel the same tingling sensation from when he began to disappear, and he looked down at his body, fearful that it would happen again. But, he remained where he was.
“I know how you wanted the evening to go, believe me, this is better.” She replied sarcastically. This was an easy job. By slipping the wrong name, she was able to gain all the information she needed, the older man basically performed a monologue revealing all of his secrets to her, as if he thought he was in a film! But she couldn’t deny the thrill of it, of being tipped in her chair on the edge of a drop, the threat of torture, this is what she lived for, the thrill. But then… the phone rang.
“Uh, no… I don’t know anyone called Peter” came the masked reply. The panic was clear in his voice, his secret was about to come out.
Okay so I'm not a big boaster or anything but I can honestly say that this has been my best chapter yet. I actually cried so much while writing this it's unbelievable! I hope you enjoyed the chapter but I don't really think it's possible to enjoy it cus it's so sad...
“Please just listen to me! I know it’s scary that I’m in a relationship, and that I’m not a little girl anymore, but you’re just going to have to DEAL WITH IT! I’m not 6 anymore, you don’t have to hold my hand all the time I can look after myself, and when I’m with Bruce I can be myself, and not this child who you expect me to be!” Natasha shouted, tears streaming down her face. Bruce pulled her into him protectively, and both Tony and Steve felt a pang of pain as the hug reminded them of the many protective hugs they had given her over the years. “You can let go of me now – I’m grown up. You have to stop thinking that you can control every aspect of my life!”
“Hello everyone! Now I have the pleasure of interviewing Natasha and Peter Rodger’s stark, the children of Captain America and Iron Man! So I guess the most obvious question is – what’s it like having two superheroes as your parents?”
At this, Steve knew he had to step in. He pulled the boys off his son with little force, not caring if they got hurt, and bent down to his son, ready to pick him up like he had done when he was little, but Peter pushed him off and stood up, slightly bent over and blood dripping from his nose.
Peter, however, was being treated extremely differently to his sister. Strapped down to a lab table, needles and wires protruding from his skin. He had fought the doctors initially, but the suppressants had entered his body and he was too weak to resist in the end.
When they got back to the compound, Peter ran straight to the miniature workshop Tony had built for him and Nat, and was Peter’s favourite place because he got to spend one on one time with his dad in there. Natasha was good with technology, but her real talent lay in words. She could read faces and recite facts and figures with ease, which made Steve both proud and nervous. Fury had seen her potential, and Steve wasn’t entirely happy at his 7 year old being trained like a spy, but Tony had had the final say.
She tried to move, but her small leg was trapped under a large metal pipe. It hurt. It hurt like hell and she tried her hardest not to scream or cry. The last thing she needed was for her parents to start stressing about her.
“This doesn’t make you an Avenger kid.” Tony said, as he blasted into the sky. However, his ascent was cut short by Scott Lang, who, usually miniscle, had transformed into a giant.
“You could have told us!” Steve replied, his voice softening, as he bent down to eye level with Peter. “We could have done something about it…” He pleaded.
“Is-is your dad here?” Tony asked quietly, almost hoping she didn’t hear it. He didn’t want to know the answer.
Steve on the other hand, walked up the stairs to find Peter and Natasha. Opening the door to Natasha’s room, he saw loads of paper sprawled over her king sized bed, a laptop half open, also on the bed, and her cat, Nala, curled up in one corner of the room, clearly not being able to fit on the bed due to the mess and lack of space, but no Natasha. Natasha and Tony were so alike in the way they worked, plans and paper everywhere. Leaving Natasha’s room, he quickly moved along into Peter’s room, which was a whole of a lot tidier. His dog, Rufus, sat whimpering under the open window, but no Peter.
“On-on Titan.” Tony began, but the story got caught in his throat. “Peter was there with me. On Titan.” Steve and Natasha both lifted their heads, eyes boring into Tony’s tear-stained face. “He got beamed up with the ship, then tried to help by becoming a stowaway. He helped fight Thanos, but- but…”
“I know them.” A low strong voice replied. Tony turned and saw Thor sat beside him listening closely to his story. After a questioning eyebrow from Tony Thor continued “I met Dr Strange when I was at Earth with Loki, before Hela arrived. The Guardians are the ones who picked me up after Asgard was destroyed and Thanos had defeated my ship. Rocket was one of the guardians. It would probably be best if I broke the news.” With this he disappeared off towards the strange looking raccoon, who was clutching at a mound of dust crying and repeatedly saying the words “I am Groot”. Thor looked towards the sorry trio, trying to deny the tears forming in his own eyes, Peter would be sorely missed.
“What! That’s ridiculous. They’ll never sign them.” Peter said, starting to get up. “I’m taking Rufus out, you wanna come?”
“Uncle Bucky!” She yelled, looking directly at her old friend, practically screaming again. The response she got was not the one he was expecting.
“Look we have the house to ourselves, let’s do something fun!” She insisted. “FRIDAY, open the lazertag arena please, and send all robots there. We are gonna have the best night in ever.” She declared.
“Yeah I know!” Steve said as he pulled out even more photos of Natasha in various costumes and hairdos, each one labelled with which show or competition she was performing in, what place she won and who was there with her. “I think she got a bit hooked on the dance thing. It’s a shame Peter didn’t either, you can clearly tell from the photo how much he is loving it!” Steve said, as he examined the photo of Nat and Pete in those cute outfits.
MJ: You’ve said that before, when Thor just happened to show up at our school and give you a high five. That was a strange day
“he, um, he” Peter could hardly get the words out. “He made Natasha… he made her kill Dad and Pops. I saw it over, and over and over again. I couldn’t stop it.” Peter began to cry all over again.
Tony started again - “I was meant to keep him safe! He could sense that something was happening, and fell into my arms saying that he didn’t want to go. I told him he was going to be alright but I lied and now he is gone and his last words were I’m Sorry. He blamed it all on himself and felt like he had let me down but I had let him down” This endless stream of words erupting from Tony’s lips carried on for a good 10 minutes, matching the flow of tears down his cheeks. By the end of his recount of events, all the remaining Avengers had joined him and the tears flowed openly down their faces.
“I got a video of it somewhere…” Peter said, slowly pulling out his phone and opening his gallery. “Here”
Wakanda was a mess. It was clear a great battle had happened there, as the broken trees and the great rocks which appeared to be spaceships still remained, though it was apparent that the actual fighting had finished long ago. When the wreck alien aircraft landed in a clearing in the woods, it took Tony at least an hour to muster up the courage to walk out of the spaceship. He couldn’t walk out and face the fact that maybe Steve and Nat didn’t survive either. Maybe none of the avengers did. But, nevertheless he stepped out, the sun blinding him. There was Natasha, staring at him with such love and pain, Tony couldn’t help himself but sweep her into a bear hug and bury his face in her hair. She had grown, both physically and mentally. She was 18 now, but in her broken state she just reminded him of the sweet baby he once cooed over, the child he soothed over a grazed knee, the hugs he gave when he finally returned from work trips, and Steve. She reminded him of Steve.
Woooopp last chapter! As you can tell I didn't really put much effort into this chapter but I felt that it didn't really need a lot of writing because the emotions are very clear and I hope you all have imaginations! Anyway - enjoy!
“I know Tony. I saw the first 500 times you said! I know he is incredibly cute, but Nat is on her way and we can’t make her feel left out, she needs to know that she is still so important to us. But our attention may just be split a little…” Cap trailed off as he saw Tony clearly not listening to a word he was saying. Tony had always wanted a boy.
“This box of photos here.” Steve said over his shoulder, nodding his head towards a few large boxes, each with photo’s spilling out of them. Steve was very sentimental, which Tony loved. Tony was always so caught up in the moment, he forgot to capture it for later, but luckily, Steve was never without a camera.
“Woah, Dad. I don’t know what to say…” Peter replied, running his hand over the fabric of the suit, admiring the tech and the way it conformed to the ridges of his newfound muscles.
“Really well, ever since we were both born. They are like our massive family, and we love them to bits!” Natasha answered with the same energy as Peter.
Her world went dark, and when she awoke, she was in a brightly lit hospital bed. Time had clearly passed, and her dads were asleep on each other at the end of her bed, deep circles under their eyes. Peter was there too, cuddled up in their lap, so surprisingly small compared to her Dads. She lay back, perfectly happy, everything was peaceful, but not for long.
“Bruce… could you help me…?” She asked timidly, but her question was quickly cut off by a grunt coming from the teenage boy. “Bruce? Are you okay?”
“Thanks you guys for being such great sports today! It was great to talk to you.” The presenter said as she wrapped the interview up. Natasha and Peter had to be somewhere else, doing more press, in particular they were needed on the Ellen Show, and Peter wasn’t going to miss that for the world.
“Okay okay! I’m going!” Tony chuckled, leaving his room but stealing a last glance at his son. His son. His whole life he has wanted a son, and finally he’s got one. And he lives up to all the fantasies.
“Peter Rodgers-Stark. You are one of the most beautiful things I have seen in my life.” Tony almost whispered at the baby. “Remember that the fake name is Parker, like the surrogate mother, like Natasha’s is Romanoff”
The fight resumed between Steve and Tony, as Bucky was still lying on the floor, breathing but motionless. The fighting was raw and intense, all emotion and rage, and both Steve and Tony couldn’t believe how long they had been fighting for. However, it started to draw to a close with both Steve and Bucky down, with Tony hovering over them victorious.
“Wait! How about we start a movie! You don’t want to go in there I think she was changing and you know what she is like. We should go back down and leave her alone maybe she is on her period she is scary when she is angry so maybe we should just go…”
Tony lowered himself onto his knees until his arms were at shoulder height with Natasha. “Look Nat, your new baby brother!”
Natasha smirked in their direction, nodding at their greetings. Then, her version of pleasantries done, she focused back in on Steve.
Tony didn’t look convinced. “That blush says otherwise. I bet it goes all the way down – want to show me?”
Tony watched Steve walk back towards the training barn, wracking his brain for a time they might have met, or something that he might have done to the man. “While I’ve possibly been black out drunk a time or twenty, I can’t imagine that there’s any amount of alcohol that was cause me to forget him. Are you seeing his ass in those breeches? Absolutely unforgettable.”
Steve knew Bucky and Tony had spoken when Tony had come by the farm, though Bucky had refused to say anything about the conversation. After calming down that day, Steve had started to feel bad about his behavior. He had been inexcusably rude to the man who signed all of their paychecks. Because, in all honesty, Steve knew that he looked completely different. He also knew that there was a difference between him remembering Tony – when Tony had been a constant media presence for over three decades – and Tony remembering him, a drunken one-night stand whom he hadn’t seen before or since.
Across the track the horses were being loaded into the gates. Widow would be one of the last horses loaded, which was ideal. The less time she had to wait in the starting gate, the better. Steve found himself holding his breath as the filly was loaded, letting it out slowly as she made it in with very little hassle.
Once they were settled, Steve turned his attention to Widow, who was warming up with the other horses. While she continued to look very alert, Steve was pleased with how she’d done so far. No matter how many times you schooled a horse on the track and in the gates, you never knew how they’d do at their first race. Widow was thus far handling herself better than he had expected.
Over the years, Natasha had developed a reputation for two things. One, she could ride anything, no matter how difficult. Two, she was always able to find an opening between horses to slide her own mount through. Even when it looked like there was an impenetrable wall of horses in front of her, she’d somehow find a way to make it through. Other jockey’s had taken to calling her “the assassin” because of the way she would sneak up and through a field before taking everyone down.
Obadiah pointed to one of the huge screens decorating the grandstand. On it, horses were being walked around by men wearing numbers, while a variety of individuals stood in small groups watching.
Suddenly, the slight clearing of a throat made Tony aware that he wasn’t alone. He turned towards the noise quickly, peering into the dim space while trying to figure out where the lights were.
With that, Steve turned and opened the door to Black Widow’s stall, clucking softly as he slid inside. Tony watched after him for a moment, and then started heading towards the grandstand. He needed a drink.
The snarky question pulled Tony away from thoughts of his dad, and he turned to see a scruffy man in purple walking towards them.
“I know what happened to trainers over there when Howard was alive. We all know that Howard was impossible to please. But now that he’s gone, Fury has more control of the day-to-day. So I don’t think I’m going to end up fired in three months when my horse doesn’t win a stakes race.”
Clint walked to a stall two doors down, and slid the door open. A gleaming red chestnut with white legs and a white blaze walked towards the door and leaned against the stall guard, looming over Clint. Even Tony, who knew absolutely nothing about horses, could tell that this horse was particularly well built. He walked slowly towards the horse, unsure of how close he should get.
“Pep, what the hell is going on?” Tony asked, worried. Pepper was normally all for him facing up to the embarrassing situations he got involved in. For her to be telling him not to turn on the TV – he couldn’t even imagine what was going on. He finally found the remote control and turned the TV on, switching until he found the news.
In the afternoons, Steve’s purpose at the track wasn’t as obvious. He wasn’t a groom like Bucky, so he wasn’t leading the horses to and from the racetrack. He wasn’t a jockey yet, so he wasn’t able to ride in the races. He wasn’t great at picking a winner, so he wasn’t even able to spend his time betting – not that he had the money for gambling anyway. Without a set task, Steve felt aimless and in the way.
They started heading for another of the immaculate buildings, with Barton occasionally pausing to point out a particular feature of the property. Tony was half listening, half replaying the very brief conversation with Steve. While he was sure he’d never met the man before, he also couldn’t figure out what he had said to cause offense in such a short interaction. The guy had ridden up on some horse, said a few words, and then left in a huff.
He gestured at the horse inside of the stall. “This is one of the two-year-olds by Avenger. His name is The Scientist, and he just started real training last month – along with the rest of the two-year-olds.”
Aqueduct was absolutely packed, with individuals from every walk of life crowded into the grandstand. Tony glanced around the box where he was supposed to meet up with his parents: empty. Granted, he was supposed to have shown up several hours ago, but it had been a late night. He had dragged himself away from his workspace as the sun was coming up, knowing that he needed at least a few hours of sleep to deal with Howard. Even now, surrounded by the excitement and excess of the racetrack, Tony’s fingers twitched with the need to get back to work. He was so close – so close – to figuring it out. Yet, here he was, wasting his time on yet another of Howard’s follies.
Yet, when Tony had woken up the next morning, he started thinking about the vitriol that Steve had expressed for him the day before, when sober. He didn’t want to be around if Steve woke with regrets, so it had been easier to just leave. He had gotten into the car he’d sent for and mentally moved on, delving right back into his AI project. He had never paused to think that Steve might not have moved on so easily.
In his hazy memory, he also remembered taking a diminutive man back to his hotel room at the end of a night of celebrating, and having a wonderful time. And Tony remembered scrawling a note to the guy and then bolting out of the hotel room the next morning, scared that the man would wake up sober and filled with regrets. It was easier to just leave.
However, while Steve wasn’t a huge fan of afternoons at the track, he couldn’t say no when Chester Phillips asked him to be there. First, Phillips was the trainer Steve worked for the most often, and Steve desperately wanted to keep him happy. It had been hard going building a clientele as an inexperienced exercise rider, and Phillips had been the first trainer to give Steve a chance. While he didn’t employ Steve full-time, he threw enough horses Steve’s way that he was able to make ends meet. If Phillips wanted Steve at the races in the afternoon, then he was going to be there. Second, today was Avenger’s first big race with Phillips. While the horse had raced twice before, this was his first race with Howard Stark as his owner, and Phillips as his trainer. That also meant it was Avenger’s first race since Steve started riding him in the mornings. And as awkward as Steve felt, he wanted to be there to see Venge go.
Steve folded the note up again, then sunk back against the pillows. And just like that, Tony was gone from his life.
“I think she’s going to do it,” Bucky said, closely watching the filly as she circled. One of the horses a few spots over started whinnying loudly, causing Widow to stop short and snort, then give a few bucks. Yet, once the filly realized that there was no reason to be concerned, she began moving forward again with her handler’s coaxing, her coat only lightly sweaty.
Tony ran out of words, and continued to gaze at the table, running his finger absentmindedly around the rim of his cocktail glass.
Wanting to feel Steve’s lower body without his pants in the way, Tony reached for Steve’s belt, trying to undo it while continuing the kissing. He had Steve’s belt open, button popped, and zipper half-way down before Steve suddenly pulled back, looking unsure in the dim light of the room.
Tony was already shaking his head before the Racing Manager had finished speaking. “I’m just not interested in owning a horse farm. That’s my dad’s dream – it’s not mine. If this two-year-old is as good as you say he is, then it sounds like he’ll make some money at auction.”
“Steve Rogers is the current trainer. Fury hired him six months ago. He’s out on the track – come on, we can walk out there and I’ll introduce the two of you.”
As he went to settle back into the bed for hopefully another few hours of sleep, he happened to see his phone’s notification screen. He had 89 missed calls and over thirty voicemails. What the fuck? Scrolling through the missed calls, he saw Pepper dozens of times, but also Obie and several of the board members of Stark Industries. He must have missed something pretty fucking important, though he had absolutely no idea what.
Steve opened his eyes and shook his head. “Of course, you all will be out of the racing business by fall, so maybe you won’t still be interested in her. But she’s a special horse, so I’m guessing that whoever ends up owning her will point her to the Breeders’ Cup.”
As they got closer, Steve stood and pushed his sunglasses onto the top of his head. His expression, open and polite as he gazed at Pepper, closed once he saw Tony following her.
Before he closed his eyes again, Tony glanced around the room. From what he could tell, he was alone. However, judging by the used condom next to the bed, he hadn’t been alone last night.
“It’s Tony, please. And talk to me after the race – please. I think there are some things we should discuss.”
Tony woke to the insistent buzzing of a phone set on vibrate. Keeping his eyes closed, he reached his arm out from under the comforter, trying to find his phone. The nightstand wasn’t the height he had been expecting – he must be in a hotel room. He continued to flail his hand around until he found his phone, and only then did he crack his eyes open to check the Starkphone display. Pepper.
Tony smiled a little, ruefully, the quirk of his lip acknowledging the appropriateness of the question. On many other occasions, the answer would be yes. However, the thrill of invention had been keeping Tony on the (mostly) straight and narrow for a few months. “This one time, no. I’m just tired. I was up late working on my senior project.”
Clint continued introductions. “This is God of Thunder – he’s another two-year-old by Avenger, out of a Storm Cat mare, Stormy Weather. We call him Thor. He’s a riot to work with – he loves naps, over eating, and running fast. His biggest challenge is that he gets distracted by everything around him – we have a hard time keeping him focused on the track. Plus, he’s so big that he gets in his own way sometimes. I doubt he’ll be ready to race until he’s three.”
Tony was nodding as Nick talked, easily able to see his father’s fingerprints all over the explanation. His dad had always wanted success immediately, and was hugely impatient with anyone that he didn’t feel was helping him reach his goals. It was one of the major reasons that he and Tony had never gotten along – Tony hadn’t been willing to fit himself into Howard’s very narrow ideas of success.
Steve and Natasha had met several years before, when he was an up and coming trainer and she was just getting her start as a jockey. Other trainers had shied away from using her – both because of her brusque manner, and because of the ingrained misogyny that permeated thoroughbred racing. But Steve, who had never met a jockey more capable than Peggy Carter, had no problem hiring a woman to ride his horses. And not only had Natasha ridden them –she had consistently won.
Steve and Natasha went over their plan once more, and then it was time. Bucky took Black Widow’s head as Steve tossed Natasha up onto her back. Immediately the filly twisted and crow hopped sideways, before popping up into the air in a partial rear. Bucky cursed and held on while Natasha sat, soft and still on her back, laughing at the horse’s antics.
“I think you mean if the horses around her make it through the first ten seconds unscathed,” Bucky laughingly replied. Steve grinned in response. Widow was a fighter for sure. She often reacted to new situations with teeth bared and ready to attack. But she loved to run even more than she loved to fight, so Steve was sure she’d come through the race on top.
“Mr. Stark, Ms. Potts,” he said, moving forward to meet them, Bucky still grumbling beside him. “Black Widow is doing great so far. We’re getting ready to walk her over for riders up. You’re welcome to come along.”
Tony kept walking, avoiding her eye. Pepper wasn’t wrong – he had been distracted over the past few weeks. Ever since he left Stark Racing three weeks ago, he’d been thinking about Steve.
Brody (or Buddy, or whoever the fuck) had face-palmed. “You didn’t remember him. Great. Nice to know that the poor schmuck was pining over you for years, and meanwhile you didn’t remember he existed.”
The look of shame morphing into one of determination, Steve moved off of Tony’s lap and rolled off the side of the bed. Holding Tony’s eye, Steve pulled his own pants down and off, standing in front of Tony in just his grey boxer briefs.
Steve knew he needed to start over with Tony – act like the professional that he absolutely was. He had considered reaching out to Tony a few times over the past few weeks, just to clear the air. But it turned out that he had needed that time to bury a hope he didn’t even know he’d been holding onto – until Tony’s eyes had raked across his body, appreciative and without an ounce of recognition.
“Why is that,” Pepper asked from Tony’s other side, eyes tracking the horses as they made their way to the gate.
“In the meantime, we won’t be buying expensive yearlings, so our costs will go way down. Plus, I have a trainer in mind that I think we can get without doling out huge amounts of cash. There’s only upside here, Stark. Either I can do what I’m telling you I can do, and you’ve made a ton of money, or you’re in the same place in a year you’re in now. Hell, if we slim down operations a little over the next year, it won’t even really cost you anything. What do you say?”
“So far,” Tony started, “you’ve shown me an unpredictable horse, a clumsy giant pig horse, and an angry killer horse. Do I own any horses that are just, I don’t know, good race horses?”
“Is this the horse?” Pepper asked, gazing in to the stall behind Steve. Tony could just make out a dark shape in the very back of the stall.
Tony found himself holding his breath as he waited for Steve’s answer. After a moment, Steve seemed to deflate just a little, and he inclined his head. “Okay Tony, we can talk after the race.”
“Seven months ago you decide to sell all of your family’s businesses other than Stark Industries – and yet, a few days later, you tell me you aren’t selling Stark Racing. Then a few weeks ago you drop everything to visit the farm, and you’ve been even more distracted than usual ever since then. Not to mention that instead of talking to your Race Manager to find out when one of your horses was racing, you had me search race entries until I found one of yours, and then set up tickets and passes for us. Now we’re walking around the backside of a track, with only the vaguest idea of where we are going. So once again – why are we here? What’s going on?”
As Obie was talking, the picture on the screen panned from horse to horse. And when the number seven horse was shown, there were his parents, dressed to the nines and conversing with an older, gruff-looking man. Tony squinted at the saddle pad of the horse his parents were standing near. Under the words “Wood Memorial” was the horse’s name: Avenger.
Pepper thrust her hand toward Steve. “Hi, I’m Pepper Potts, Tony’s Personal Assistant. Tony and I wanted to come and see the horses run. And you are?”
“Tony Stark. I’m just here to see this four-legged waste of time that my dad is throwing away my inheritance on.”
Tony tore his gaze away from Bucky and finally seemed to notice Steve sitting next to him on the couch. “Angry Pint-size! Do you have a crush on me?” Tony seemed delighted at the prospect.
Tony flinched at the booming cry, and then turned to see Obie bearing down on him, the bourbon in his hand sloshing as he wove through the crowd. Obadiah Stane was his father’s business partner and right hand man. Tony wasn’t surprised to see him at the track – Obie was always involved in his father’s side projects in some way.
“Long story short, I met Steve twenty years ago at the one horse race I ever went to. We fought, then we flirted, we got wasted, and we fucked. I left the following morning and didn’t see him again until three weeks ago when I found out that he’s now my horse trainer. I didn’t recognize him at first, which isn’t my fault – he looks totally different now, Pep. And I maybe hit on him before I knew who he was.”
But the steps from the bar to Tony’s hotel room existed only in fragments in Tony’s mind. He could see an image of Steve in the back of a taxi, his shirt askew and his lips swollen. He somewhat remembered trying to get the keycard to work in his hotel room door before realizing that he wasn’t even on the right floor, Steve laughing next to him. And then here he was, on his bed, looking up at Steve.
“Didn’t Tony Stark just go on TV a few days ago and announce that he’s selling all of his father’s businesses except for Stark Industries? Won’t Stark Racing be sold off in the next few months anyway?” Bucky asked.
“Tony, it’s nothing to do with last night. Figure out where you are, call me back, and I’ll come get you. Don’t turn on the TV. Just stay put.”
At Tony’s blank look, Fury explained. “He won a race. Some horses need several tries, but he broke his maiden his first time out, winning by seven lengths. It was an impressive first race, but he wasn’t against elite company. Look, give me a year to turn this farm around. A year from now, if Cap is as special as I think he is, he’ll be running in the big races. Not only will that increase his value, but that will increase the value of Avenger and the other foals from the Avenger Initiative.
“Oh, Tony. Is he what this is about?” She shook her head at him in exasperation, then started forward again, headed straight for Steve. Tony trailed after her, wishing he had come up with a plan beyond “find Steve, explain himself.”
Tony flashed a flirty grin, and let his fingers trail against Steve’s slowly as he drew his hand away. “There is absolutely no way I’ve met you before. I’d never forget someone who looks like you.”
“If she can make it through the first ten seconds unscathed, she’ll win,” Steve responded. Black Widow was not a fan of the starting gate, and very much not a fan of other horses in her personal space. So the start of the race, where multiple horses would likely end up bunched up and on top of one another, would be a challenge for her.
Pepper shook her head at him. “He’s pretty – I’ll give you that. But you know you can’t get involved with him, Tony. He works for you. Plus, you’re going to be making a lot of decisions about Stark Racing in a few months, and starting a relationship with him will just make that more difficult.”
Tony’s mind drifted back to that day, twenty years before. He remembered being frustrated at Howard, and frustrated overall that he had been pulled away from MIT so close to graduation to spend time with his dysfunctional family. But he also remembered the thrill of Howard’s horse coming in first place. With a start, he realized that it had actually been Avenger that he had seen that day.
Honestly, Steve had been on his mind for more than the last few weeks. Ever since he had agreed to keep Stark Racing, he had occasionally wondered about the exercise rider than he had connected with so many years earlier. His monthly meetings with Fury, which were often filled with discussions of Avenger and his progeny, inevitably brought memories of his one horse racing experience to mind. Which then led to thinking about Steve, in a vague and pleasant way.
“Fury’s plan rests on the yearlings and two-year-olds that they currently have at the farm. And Bucky, most of those are by Avenger.”
Tony shook his head to clear it, wanting to focus on what Steve was saying. “Sure, instructions. I’d be happy to tell you what I’m into. And tell me what you like. I aim to please.” Tony grinned up at Steve.
Barton laughed. “Sorry dude, I should have warned you. That’s Black Widow. She’s another of Avenger’s offspring – a three-year-old. She isn’t the friendliest of horses.”
“You weren’t there, Buck. He was so dismissive! It was like I wasn’t even worth talking to.” Steve shut his eyes and leaned his head back against the couch, feeling the room swim just a little. Maybe he needed to start drinking water instead of grabbing another beer.
Steve then paused and momentarily closed his eyes, causing his long blond lashes to sweep his cheekbones. Tony heard Pepper inhale next to him, and felt a moment of triumph – at least he wasn’t the only one thrown by Steve’s good looks.
Tony had just come from a press conference, where he had laid out his vision for Stark Industries. He was planning on selling all of the various side-businesses that his father had purchased, and focusing his time and attention on tech development.
“Bullshit,” Bucky spat. “Tony hasn’t been at a single one of his horse’s races since he took over Stark Racing. He wasn’t there when Cap won the Fountain of Youth, and it doesn’t get much bigger than that. So there’s no reason for him to be here to see Widow run today. He’s here because of you.”
“Well, it looks like that isn’t going to work out for him, doesn’t it,” Tony replied. “If you saw my press conference, then you know I’m selling all of dad’s businesses outside of SI. That includes Stark Racing. From what my lawyers tell me, that racing farm is the biggest resource drain of any of our holdings. They say it’s right in the middle of prime horse country, and that we’ll be able to get a good amount of money for the property. The horses will go to auction in the next few months, and I’m told a few of them might be worth something.”
Nick sat up straighter, looking Tony dead in the eye. “I’m here to ask you to reconsider, Stark. While we’ve never won the Kentucky Derby, Stark Racing has a ton of big wins under its belt. We’ve won grade one stakes races, including Breeders’ Cup races. We’ve qualified horses for the Derby several times, and we’ve placed in the Preakness Stakes. This is a winning operation, and it could be a huge success with a little more time.”
“Bit of a crush, my ass,” Bucky interrupted. “You were gone on that guy for years before you met him. And you were worse once you hooked up with him. You moped over every story that came out about him until you were what, twenty-two?”
“So the Fountain of Youth – is that a big race?” Tony asked, curious just how good Captain America actually was.
“Yes, we’ll be there,” Tony affirmed. He thought about leaving it there, and letting Steve get on with his job, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself – he needed to clear the air with this man. “Steve, I just wanted to say that I’m …”
“So tell me about this one,” Tony asked, while cautiously running his hands along the horse’s face. The horse sighed and lowered his head, his eyes closing slightly.
Tony turned in his father’s chair, looking out once again across the city. He really had no urge to own a horse racing farm. What did he know about horse racing anyway? He’d only been to a race one time in his life.
Fury, still smirking slightly, led him into one of the nearby barns. Stalls lined either side of the wide aisleway, each one bearing an engraved nameplate. Employees, all wearing matching embroidered black jackets, moved through the space with purpose. Some were grooming, some were cleaning stalls, and some were leading horses out to the large paddocks located behind the barn.
Beside him, both Tony and Pepper were on their feet. Pepper was standing still as a statue, her hands clasped together, staring intently at the horses. Tony was repeating “come on, Widow” under his breath over and over as the horses made their way to the finish line.
Maybe Tony should regret that he’d never made good with his father – that they had never mended the divide that had sprung up between them when Tony started talking back at the age of 11, and that had deepened when Tony came out as bisexual at the age of 16. But there were only so many times he could try with someone who didn’t accept him for who he was.  So fuck Howard. Fuck him for not accepting who Tony was, and fuck him for dying before he could learn acceptance.
Bucky nodded sagely. “And do you keep the copy of People magazine with all of those pictures of Tony under your bed because of how sorry you feel for him?”
Steve could feel himself start to blush, his ears and cheeks suddenly feeling warm. He didn’t think anyone knew about that magazine. He didn’t use it for what Bucky was suggesting … at least, not exactly. But yes, he maybe had noticed how attractive Tony was. And maybe, in some of Steve’s daydreams, he saved Tony from himself, and Tony then fell head over heels in love with him.
“Wait a minute,” Tony said, “did he say Avenger? As in the horse that retired from racing decades ago? Is that who he was riding?”
“Yes ma’am, this is Black Widow. This is her first race, and so far she’s been a bit unsure of how she feels about life at the track. So I thought I’d sit with her until it was time to take her over to the paddock.”
“It’s one of the races on the road to the Kentucky Derby. Cap needs one more good finish in order to qualify. Steve has him pointed towards the Bluegrass Stakes next month. He’s done well at Keeneland before, so Steve thinks it’s a good fit for him.
Bucky looked over and caught his eye, widening his eyes in an expression of “can you believe it?” This was by far the biggest race that he and Bucky had ever been involved in. There were more fans, more finery, and more cameras than they were used to seeing. In fact, the race was being broadcast on television as part of NBC’s Road to the Kentucky Derby.
“Steve, I want the details – what did he want?” Bucky asked as he burst into Steve’s office, pretty much the moment Steve hung up the phone.
Though it had been years, Tony could still picture Pint-size. His tousled blond hair and strong arms, his slim hips and enticing blush – all were etched in Tony’s mind. Yes, Pint-size and Steve were both blond, and yes, he seemed to remember that Pint-size was actually called Steve, but so were half of the white guys Tony knew. Pint-size would have had to have the mother of all growth spurts in order to be Steve’s size. Plus, they really didn’t look that similar, right?
Bucky started to laugh again, this time not bothering to stifle it. “Stark, no offense, but that was the worst line I have ever heard.”
Tony groaned quietly as he stepped into the direct sunlight of the grandstand, pausing for a moment and closing his eyes. The aspirin and coffee that he had downed on the four hour trip from MIT hadn’t done a damn thing to help with his headache. If only he’d been able to get another few hours of sleep in the car. He rubbed his forehead, regretting yet again that he’d let his mom talk him into coming to the track today.
“That’s not going to work for me!” he responds, voice coming out in a shocked huff. “There’s literally nothing about my life that belongs in this century.”
“We don’t know yet.  All our systems are down, and the backup generators being slow to kick in, but we had reports of a combatant in the area before the phone lines went dead.”
Except ‘everyone’ didn’t stay put for long.  After the initial clean up and the publicity stunts, life settles down to this century’s approximation of normal, or at least what Steph assumes is normal.  Clint and Nat go off to do their Very Secret Things for SHIELD, Thor goes to visit a lady friend in New Mexico, and Bruce is…somewhere intentionally off the grid.  That pretty much leaves just her and Natasha holed up in an obscenely large house trying to peacefully coexist.  Right.
And how exactly is she supposed to answer that?  She can feel her cheeks heating up, and dammit, the serum’s supposed to regulate her systems, not throw her body into havoc when some socialite CEO inventor gets cheeky.
Meanwhile, Natasha seems to have all of the steam sucked out of her. “Oh,” she answers and her face finally goes still.
is the first solid piece of information he has about his friend’s appearance sans suit, and it’s a bit pathetic how eager he is for that information. It’s ironic because it really doesn’t matter; given his reliance on the suit, Steve’s always half-expected his friend to be heavily scarred or otherwise disfigured under the mask. That’s never made a difference in who he is. Shellhead is Shellhead and he could be green and purple for all Steve cares, but the not knowing, the absence of any concrete information, chafes.
“Would you stop selling yourself short?” Steve answers tersely, and he rotates his torso so that they’re facing each other on the couch.  “A very smart man told me something once.  I didn’t quite understand it at the time, but now I think I do.  He said that the most important thing in life wasn’t for me to be a perfect soldier; the best thing I could do was be a good man.  And that’s what you are, Tony – a
Strangely enough, none of that’s actually a lie, aside from the age thing. He was born in 1918, ergo he’s 94. But aside from that minor snafu, everything else Natasha’s just said works out, if you ignore the fact that it happened in the 20th century and not the 21st. It’s…somewhat comforting.
He fully expects Steve to reject him, which is why it’s so surprising when Steve says yes.  Well, in for a penny…
It takes a moment for Tony to snap back.  He seems...spaced out or something, like he’s contemplating about a million different things at once.  “That’s a bit fatalistic, you know.”
“What exactly is more important than protecting the world?” Steve asks in a blend of anger and confusion.
In lack of a better response, Tony shifts.  “Be that as it may, I don’t exactly have time for a relationship, Steve.  I pretty much live down here, in case you haven’t noticed.”
The real Titanic actually predates his birth, but he can remember his Mom telling him stories about it.  She’d been in her teens when the unsinkable ship had failed to make it to New York Harbor, and the newspapers had reported nothing else for days.  Years later, she could still recall the incident with perfect clarity.
“Stand on top of my boot,” she directs, voice still slightly distorted by the suit’s modulator.   As Steph moves, Tasha pulls her in close and then they’re airborne.
Stark snorts.  “That’s one way to put it.  The problem is, I’ve tried dozens of permutations and none of them produce the necessary rate of decay, at least not enough to produce Cherenkov radiation.  And I’m running out of time.”
“It seemed important to you. Besides, Tasha doesn’t do anything she doesn’t want to. She probably needed to destress,” he assures. “So how’d it go?”
Tony could have stayed that way forever, kissing Steve outdoors in the moonlight, but he knows there are things he needs to say.  He pulls back but consoles himself with the knowledge that he can repeat the process as soon as possible.
Then, to avoid sounding like a complete dick and just in case Steve doesn’t get the reference, he adds one more line.
“No, but Nan died when I was eighteen, and I enlisted right after her funeral.  And you’re not exposed to civilization all that much in an active warzone.  I pick up most things pretty quickly, but most pop culture things go over my head.”  He’s secretly proud of himself for throwing in that idiom.  Now he just has to see if Tony’s convinced by the ruse.
“Sir, I must warn you that the emissions from this particular isotope are already displaying signs of instability.  Increasing the current will most likely result in –”
And when he thinks back on it, the night hasn’t been that bad.  In fact, his most pressing memories are of walking in with Steve at his side, of feeling Steve’s waist under his hand and his breath on his face as they danced.
He’s never known anyone else to borrow the armor before, but if anyone else could pilot the suit, it would be her. Steve spares a momentary concern for Shellhead and how vulnerable he must be somewhere without his suit, but he quickly shoves that thought aside to tend to the woman stumbling toward him. He doubts Iron Man would have passed on the armor unless it was absolutely necessary, so Steve immediately jumps into his analytical combat mode.
Tony is a scientist, and as such, he has always placed his faith in facts.  Facts aggregate to form specific systems of knowledge, and those knowledge systems make sense of the physical world.  Up until this point, all the facts at his disposal have suggested Steve views him solely as a friend – a close one, obviously, but one who has no desire for their relationship to turn into something more.  Now, though, he can’t be sure, and the paradigm under which he’s operated for so long comes crashing down around his ears.
If the legalese had infuriated the World Security Council, the implicit blackmail is enough to shut them up.  Fury, though, Fury seems less enraged than his name might imply.  If Steph didn’t know any better, she’d say he looks…proud?  At the very least he’d seems less angry than usual, which can only work out in the team’s favor.
Jarvis’ momentary start of surprise is quickly replaced with the Eyebrow of Reproach, but Tony has long since learned the subtitles of said eyebrow.  Jarvis totally approves.
Tony has nearly died on a frankly incredulous number of occasions now, so he knows that whole life-flashes-before-your-eyes thing is total BS.  However, that doesn’t stop his brain from cataloging what happens next in minute detail.
“I know that,” Nat snaps back.  “Even Stark knows that, deep down.  What you have to do is convince him that he
stays masked in public, always maintaining the illusion of a selfless figure poised to serve the greater good.  This isn’t Captain America right now.  This is Steve, whose mouth is currently leaking blood and who’s temple is marred by an obscene gash over his right eye.
It’s clear they’re in the right when the red and blue lights of police vehicles cut the blackness.  Tony sets them down quickly, just in front of the police barricade, and Steve immediately starts looking for the rest of the team.
Steve debates turning his attention back to the bag, but really, the whole exercise hasn’t been very soothing.  He steps back and moves to unwrap the tape from his hands.  He keeps his eyes fixed firmly on his palms as he answers, “It’s not.”
Yeah…” The voice manages to sound chagrined, even through the suit’s filter. “Tasha and I…We’re both private people.”
“I don’t know everything, Clint!” she says sharply, looking slightly flustered that she has to make the admission.
“Damn it, Tony, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to freak out on you like that.”  Tony assumes the anger in Steve’s voice is indicative some pretty intense self-loathing, and that’s not going to fly.  As someone intimately familiar with the concept of self-hatred, he’s pretty good and gauging when it’s justified, and there’s no way that Steve deserves the loathing embedded within his voice.
The good news is, she’s not in any immediate danger. The bullet’s buried in her side and she’s losing blood, but it looks worse than it is. And that’s not the main thing that’s drawing his attention. That would be the very familiar piece of machinery embedded in the middle of her sternum.
?”  Tony’s voice rises to an unholy screech on the last word, and he's still not quite sure he's heard Steve correctly.
As he finishes the long, twisted story of his interactions with Steve, he looks up, hoping to find sympathy and a bit of encouragement from one of his best friends.
, and Steve is a person he really wants to keep in his life.  Consequently, however foolhardy the decision may be, he needs to come out and fess up about his knowledge of their secret superhero lives (Christ, it even
He’s still running over the implications of his epiphany when his phone vibrates.  To his infinite surprise, his lock screen reads
Still, even the thought of asking Steve on this definitely-not-a-date is still fucking terrifying.  If Steve says no, he’s not exactly sure he can compartmentalize the rejection.  Worse still, what if Steve says yes out of some misplaced sense of duty, and he gets to taunt himself with the parody of what he’ll never have?
Steve’s primary reaction to seeing a smart, beautiful woman naked in his best friend’s bed isn’t shock or envy or lust. He doesn’t want to seek Iron Man out to congratulate him or ask for all of the pertinent details about his relationship. Steve doesn’t want to talk to anybody about anything at all right now.
This could all be for nothing. Despite his brain’s most recent discoveries, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that Tasha feels the same way about him or might even grow to think of him in a romantic light. But with all that’s happened, their relationship is bound to change. It can’t not change. But maybe he can help shape the final product into something that’s more fulfilling for both of them. At this point he has to try, because he doubts the universe is going to provide him with another test run.
“Did they hit anything major?” he continues. “We need to make sure that you don’t have…” His voice trails off as he lifts the shirt past her ribcage.
“Okay,” she starts, and this time her voice is a lot more cautious.  “You like him.  How long has this thing been going on?”
“JARVIS,” he calls, “have one of the interns bring down one of the StarkPhones that are about to go out for beta testing.”
Instead of injuring the creature at all, the bolts seem to have had the opposite effect.  It rears back in anger and, extending its hands to their longest possible, reach, emits a nearly blinding blast of electricity that has Steve diving behind the barrier.
of machinery.  Tony stop when he’s only a foot or two away.  With the suit on, he easily tops Steve by a couple of inches, and Steve finds himself in the unfamiliar position of having to look up at someone.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Steve shoots back as he watches Dum-E continuing to flip the phone open and shut, “he seems plenty happy to me.”
“Boy scout,” Tony scoffs and bites into one of the bagels.  “So, did you play around on the internet like I told you?”
information.  So far, he’s navigated from “Please show me a picture of Anthony Stark with first robot at MIT” to “Tony Stark MIT robot” to an article entitled “Tony Stark:  MIT’s Robotic Wonderkind.”  After skimming that article, he’d clicked on the blue “Stark Industries” link, read through some sort of encyclopedia page, jumped to a page on “Iron Man,” and was currently watching news footage of the Avengers fighting the Battle of New York.
out, because that would talk a level of gumption he can’t bring himself to muster.  Anything remotely resembling a romantic overture runs the risk of losing Steve, which is Not Acceptable under any circumstances.  Ergo, instead of asking the object of his oh-so-unrequited affection out on an actual date, he’s proposing a non-date, in which Steve can choose to accompany him to a social event strictly as friends.
Okay, she meant it.  It still sounds like an absolutely horrible idea.  “Umm, have you been listening to anything I’ve said?  Avoiding the truth is sort of what’s been allowing the relationship to work.”
Tony, who apparently is unconcerned about his own mortality, because he merely shrugs one shoulder in response.  “I’m aware.  I didn’t die.  I’m alive, and I’m fine, and I’m here.”
“I’m fine,” Stark insists, although his voice is less hostile than before.  “Although I don’t think my windows are.  How did you even break that glass?”
“Seriously though…” Steve struggles to find the right wording if such a thing even exists. “Can you…? When you’re together, do you have to wear the armor or…?”
in a way that Steve hasn’t seen before.  While it’s a surprisingly endearing look on Tony, Steve hates being the one that put it there.
It’s probably the shock that makes Steve lose all concept of time because it seems like both a moment and an eternity when a woman in scrubs comes out of the operating theatre and says that she’s stable and resting quietly. Another inch to the right and the bullet would have punctured a lung, she says. Ms. Stark was incredibly lucky.
Steve gulps, but he keeps his hand firmly on top of Tony’s, and Tony thinks maybe, just maybe, he stands a chance.  “Tony, I – ”
Steve stutters, not sure if he can explain this.  He remembers Natasha’s advice – keep it as close to the truth as possible – and tries to choke out an answer.
That should probably wait until they get back to the tower though.  If Steve’s current reaction is any indication, this is not a discussion that needs to go down in public.  Not to mention it gives him a bit more time before the death knell.
Steph bends down, shutting Tasha up in the way she’s been dying to for months now if she’s finally being honest with herself (and there’s really no reason for her not to be honest now).  Tasha’s lips are slightly chapped, they both smell faintly of smoke, and it’s over far too quickly.  Still, when they both straighten up, they’ve both got smiles on their faces.
He still doesn’t quite understand why this is all such a big deal.  Okay, maybe Tony is a bit particular about who comes into his lab, and it maybe it is a kind of strange that Tony’s devoted so much of his time to ensuring that Steve feels comfortable, but that speaks more to how Tony is just a genuinely good person, not because Steve’s anything special.  He still hasn’t quite worked out why Tony’s gotten along with him as opposed to the other field agents, but he’ll figure it out.  Eventually.
“No, he generally just scoots around and knocks things over.  Occasionally he decides to drill holes in things.”
Putting the dilemma temporarily out of his mind, at least as much as he’s able, he shifts gears.  “So, what’s on the agenda for the night?” he asks, burrowing back into the couch cushions and grabbing a throw he’s taken to leaving on the side of the couch.
“No, it’s not!” the other man insists.  “Steve, you are the official liaison to Stark Industries, keyword in that sentence being
“This,” says Tony with no little amount of pride in his voice, “is Ana.  She’s a commercial grade AI who's now running in the newest Stark lines.  She basically runs all of your tech, and over time she adapts to your individual user preferences.”
. But it’s four minutes until twelve and they really don’t have time if he wants to clear the room by midnight. He’ll get his vengeance tomorrow, though.
“I’m…” the AI pauses, and even Steve knows the hesitation is uncharacteristic, “...not quite sure what you mean.”
"That's what you get when your father sends you away to boarding school at age eight." His brain immediately summons memories of itchy uniforms and sitting in class with boys twice his age.  "Well, you also get bullying, a lot of emotional trauma, a lasting inability to form stable relationships, and so many other unpleasant fringe benefits, but you do learn to dance."
“No, Tony, it’s not.  What are you even thinking?”  Pep usually reserves that tone of voice for when he’s said something particularly egregious to a board member, and he sees no reasons why she’s using it now.  Honestly, she’s not the one that’s dating an incognito Captain America.
“Absolutely. But to be honest,” Steve answers, “I don’t think it’s gonna tear us apart.” The opposite, if anything. “We spend most of our time together anyway.”
“Is it?”  Her answering silence speaks volumes.  “Nat, is there some reason why SHIELD didn’t want me using the internet?  It’s cleared up a lot of my questions so far, and I’m a bit surprised they didn’t give me access straight away.”
He eventually musters his attention to focus back on the blueprints for his latest model.  He doesn’t think increasing the radius of the interior cell will fix anything, but maybe if he embedded the most recent atomic variation in the hardware of one of his earlier models…
.  More.  More of that.  He opens his mouth, inexplicably trying to catch the last bit of the soundwaves, which Tony takes as an invitation to deepen the kiss, running his tongue along the inside of Steve’s mouth with the same meticulous attention he gives to everything he’s passionate about.  Steve hadn’t really thought about how Tony’s single-minded focus would translate to the bedroom, but now it’s all he can think about.
That in mind, he’s constantly thinking about the possibilities of what happens when Steve figures out the truth.  It’s bound to happen sooner or later, but he’s not at all certain how it will all play out.  Yes, Steve’s implicitly lying to him by not coming clean about the whole super-powered World War II vet thing, but Tony’s hardly an innocent party here.  He’s got his own little repulsor-propelled secret, which admittedly, is not the best foundation on which to build a relationship.  His only saving grace is that Steve is doing the
Fury ignores the back and forth and turns to address the room.  “I’m here because a certain group of superheroes didn’t bother to come to the mandatory debrief.”  He throws a particularly sharp glare at Natasha, who merely shrugs and keeps spooning ice cream out of a bowl.
“What the hell?”  Stark’s shocked voice emanates from somewhere on his left and Steve breaths a sigh of relief.  The inventor’s a bit dirty and his hands are fanning smoke away from his eyes, but he looks relatively unharmed.
“Hardly," Thor scoffs.  "Vitaelia is a minor Alfheim with the ability to temporarily animate graven images.  I fear she found the lure of your most excellent gardens too strong to resist.”
He has no idea how that’s supposed to incentivize him to leave. He must stand there looking at her long enough that Tasha gets suspicious because she raises her head slightly from the pillow to meet his eyes. “You’re cutting it pretty close to midnight for someone who insisted on this whole shebang. Problems?”
Steve internally bristles at that; he absolutely loathes it when Tony tries to put himself down, but he can’t exactly react to something he’s not supposed to hear.  He’s going to break Tony out of that self-depreciating mindset if it’s the last thing he does.
“Look, haven’t they told you how this thing goes down?  You had your shot, so now it’s time for the next generic man in black to show up and try to bring me over.  Unless Fury’s run out of minions?”  Stark’s hands gesture wildly as he speaks, and his voice drips with sarcasm.
One side of Tony’s mouth quirks up, and he responds in a sly tone.  “I know.  That’s what makes me so nice.”  The inventor looks at him as if he’s supposed to know what that means, but Steve can’t fathom what exactly Tony wants from him.  After a moment, Tony’s expectant eyes crinkle.
For now, though, he’ll take what he can get.  Training with Clint and Natasha and the mornings and spending his afternoons with Tony have given him a sense of normalcy that was severely lacking from his life.  He’s not quite at ease in this century; he’s not sure he’ll ever be, but his days are vastly more meaningful now that he has a purpose.  He knows that as soon as he finishes up here, he’ll shower and bike over to Stark Tower, where he’ll watch some bizarre film, listen to music that’s far too loud, and watch Tony try to change the world.  Speaking of which…
Steve has no answer for that.  After a moment of silent, Clint turns his attention back to Steve’s phone, which he promptly plucks from Natasha’s hand.  He rotates the device, looking at it from all possible angles.
It’s as if the air has been sucked out of the room. They're both breathing hard, and he can see the elevated rise and fall of Natasha's chest. He’s not used to this. For so long he’s been forced to guess at what’s going on behind his friend’s faceplate, and over the years he’s come to make the most of a shoulder raise or the tilt of a head. But this…this is an embarrassment of riches. Natasha’s face has always been expressive, but he’s never had a reason to watch it so closely before. There’s reason enough now.
He lets the advice breathe for a few seconds, turning over the ends and outs of Pepper’s suggestion.  When he finally speaks, his voice is barely audible.  “What if he leaves?”
As far as anyone knows, he had one brief flight, just enough of an ascent to carry him out of a desert and pass on the armour to a hypothetical someone else worthier of the responsibility.  That noble, imaginary figure fought alongside the Avengers and flew a nuke into space.
“However, I don’t think it would be in breach of protocol to observe that Sir has checked his phone during this business trip far more frequently than on previous occasions.  Furthermore, his increased heart rate and dilated pupil while in your presence suggest that he finds your company enjoyable.
He makes sure to fly out far enough, each second of pain an added assurance that this bastard won’t make his way back to land.  He waits till he’s in the middle of the river, smack dab over the deepest part before he moves to disengage his fingers, only to find that his hands won’t budge.
The moment he hears the world “SHIELD,” Tony’s mind immediately shuts down, and he’s automatically committed to getting out of this meeting as soon as is physically possible.  This.  Again.  Hasn't Fury learned his lesson by now?
Not bothering to say goodbye, Steve hangs up and starts speeding north.  If he’s lucky it shouldn’t take him more that five minutes to make it to Central Park; he can probably make it in three if he presses.
How to answer the question, though?  No, Iron Man is not alright.  Iron Man is in the middle of a crisis and currently doubting the basis of his existence.  Iron Man is hella confused and really needs you to come clean about your secret double life.
“You’re not the only one with secrets,” Tony replies, his voice deliberately dramatic voice.  Slowly, he reaches toward the scooped neck of his shirt and pulls, the fabric straining as he forces it lower and lower.
Steve looks up in the direction of the voice that’s just spoken to him.   The secretary’s soft tones have startled him out of his reverie, but he tries to cover his surprise by standing quickly to his feet.
Pepper, genius that she is, latches on to his slip up  immediately and shows no signs of  letting go.  “Haven’t even...Tony!”
“Steve, movies are hallmarks of their time.  Everything that gets produced, even if it’s a period piece, holds certain markers of a culture’s mores and values.  You should be able to learn about modern life from what people choose to put on screen, not to mention gleaning secondhand information about tech.”
“Tonight,” he affirms and exits, all the while thinking to himself that while that wasn’t as bad as he expected things to be, he much preferred the world he thought he inhabited before this morning.
Thor shakes his head.  “Banished.  But you need not fret.  Given the energy she expended here today, she will require at least ten of your years to recover.”
“Keep going!”  He screams to his artificial audience of one.  If he’s going to go through all of this, dammit, he’s going to see it through!
He still can’t help but flashback to his earlier conversation with Clint and Natasha.  Despite his stringent objections that there was nothing going on between him and Tony, he wasn’t being as open as he could’ve been.  Yes, technically he and Tony are only friends, but that doesn’t stop his mind from straying into occasionally dangerous territory.
“Come on, you’re here every day for the past two weeks and suddenly you decide not to show?  What if you’d been abducted by aliens?  That’s a legitimate possibility now.”
“Everyone fall back!” he cries, waving his arms so everyone will gather behind him.  He raises his shield and nods toward Iron Man.
Inwardly, Steve winces at the implications of that failed shield toss, but he knows he can’t afford to get distracted.  He’s got six...five...four…
At first, he thinks it’s his imagination, but after an interminable length of time, he finally catches sight of the river.  The blue-black waters are easily one of the most beautiful things he’s ever seen, all the more so for the promise they hold.  Just a little bit further.  Just a little bit more and it’s all over.
“…and did you see the one with the eye?  Granted, the biology’s a bit off, but for a fifteenth-century print they got a heck of a lot right.”  It’s a testament to how smitten he is that he’s genuinely amused by Steve’s language.  Only Steve could use the word ‘heck’ and make it sound cute.
“Tasha is very busy,” his friend offers. “We all are. Getting the three of us in the same room at the same would be damn near impossible.”
, who is both the world’s biggest nerd and the sweetest guy he’s ever met.  All the things that people usually loathe about Tony – his snarkiness, his know-it-all attitude, his frequent tech fugues – Steve actually seems to
Almost immediately after the syllable leaves Steve’s mouth, the tennis ball flies from Natasha’s hand and soars across the room.  The bright green flashes by in a perfect arc toward the target at the opposite end of the gym, nearly invisible to anyone without his enhanced reflexes.
"Whoa, hey!" he said, reaching out to pat Steve’s back. "Not the reaction I was expecting. Are you all right?"
Something inside Steve thrills at the word.  “Yes,” he answers back softly.  “Yes, it is.”  He starts to make his way outside of the lab, but the conversation seems…unfinished somehow.  Quickly, before he can rethink anything, he turns and places one, brief kiss on Tony’s cheek.  He then turns and makes his way out of the lab at the upper threshold of human speed, his face turning bright red all the while.
Steve’s never really thought about what it must mean to rub shoulders with the vast majority of people that appear on their television screens. He knows he’s met some of these people at Avengers glad-handing events, but he tries to keep his personal and his private lives separate. Natasha’s been doing this her whole life. It stands to reason that she would
, and the impact reverberates through his shoulder and right side.  He uses the momentum to complete the rotation, flips over, rolls to his feet, and turns to face Natasha.  Despite having just tossed him to the ground for the umpteenth time, she looks remarkably poised.
Now for the double speak.  “She worked in legal for a while, and she was pretty good at it, too.  It wasn’t until later, after shit started going down, that I realized that she was a SHIELD operative.”  He lets that sink in for a moment.  “At first, I was pissed.  Like
“Well, you can start by getting out of your apartment every once in a while. Go outside. Walk in the park. Talk to someone and find out what makes this century tick. You helped saved the world, Cap! Now it’s time to figure out what exactly it is that you’ve saved.”
He shakes himself out of that train of thought to avoid sounding like a total hypocrite.  “Right,” he nods.  “I’ll meet you there?”
Steve grins.  It’s a credit to both Natasha and Clint’s skills that they managed to pull off that move so quickly.  Together, they’re the perfect combination of speed and accuracy that’s going to make them deadly to any enemy they come up against.  More to the point, this maneuver is something that could potentially be used to target hostiles from a distance.  Natasha’s got a range of about 30 meters on a good day, and he can easily pass the 100 meter mark; given Clint’s pinpoint aim, it’s possible that they can use this combo to ignite flash grenades or something similar in the future.  Not that they’ve needed the gesture recently, but it never hurts to be prepared.
“Point,” Natasha concedes. “Okay, question," she says, drawing her knees up on the sofa and turning toward him. "Out of all the schmoozing you’ve had to do as an Avenger, who were you the most excited to meet?”
No, he just figures he’ll do what he does best:  suffer silently.  It seems to be working out so far.
Stark smiles, but cautiously.  “If this works the way I think it will, the arc reactor could completely replace the hospital’s source of electricity.  If the power lines ever get cut off, they won’t have to rely on an external source of energy.  The hospital would be able to generate all of their electricity on site, in-house through an environmentally sustainable source.  And if it works for Mount Sinai, arc reactor technology could power other high-energy establishments.”
Steph reaches out with one gloved hand.  Her fingers are still filthy with ash, but Tasha’s face is already sweat-dampened from being inside of the helmet.  There’s also a not-so-subtle part of her that wants to leave a mark on Tasha, to prove that
Tony looks at him skeptically when he grabs the garden rake that’s been laying a foot to their right.  “A rake, really?  You’re going to fight this thing off with a rake.”
Pepper levels him with her best glare and cocks one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.  “Kick.  His.  Ass,” she repeats, emphasizing each syllable.
“But you’ve spent time with him, every day, in your lab, listening to music and watching old movies and talking about your work for months?”
“Not really.”  Yet despite his no, Steve starts talking again after a moment’s pause.  His words seem tentative and distant, but he chokes out an explanation with what Tony can only label Steve-like persistence.  “When I was in the service, a plane I was flying crashed into the ocean.  It went down fast, and I almost didn’t make it out in time.”
Steve’s still not quite sure what to make of it.  “You didn’t have to do that,” he persists.  “I didn’t need anyone to step in.  Things were going well.”
number of zeros.  Still, it was for a good cause, so he’d held his tongue as the wagers climbed higher.  But just as the bidding had slowed and it seemed as if the embarrassing ordeal was finally over, Tony had spoken up, calmly doubling the winning offer and effectively shutting down the auction.
something from him.  Despite his supposed role as a ‘liaison’ – and really, they should just drop that title, because Steve’s
It’s lucky for him that Tony’s back is turned, because Steve’s pretty sure he spent a good minute standing in the doorway with his mouth open and clutching a greasy sack full of tacos, which is probably not the best way to start the evening.  He gives himself a minute to appreciate the sight in front of him before he steps fully into the room.  Whatever flame-inducing project Tony is working on is probably stopped him from hearing the doors, so Steve waits until Tony’s between strokes to speak up.
Steve takes a moment to wonder exactly what JARVIS deems ‘confidential’ because it seems like he just disclosed a lot of information, if in an admittedly roundabout way.  If JARVIS is to be believed – and he’s learned to always believe JARVIS – Tony feels
“No,” his friend insists. “No, it doesn’t bother me. I’d be a pretty terrible partner if I didn’t agree with you.”
The shock at seeing the Star Wars image jolts him out of his texting coma.  What the hell?!  When did Steve learn how to do that?  Gifs are
“What exactly is the problem then, Steve? Cause you get along with Nat just fine, so don’t tell me you have some weird sexist hangup, and I’ve
It’s not like it matters, but the guy's been here at the crack of dawn for the past two weeks, so when he doesn’t show on the morning he
One of the best things about movie night is that it's flexible enough to suit all participants. When he and Iron Man had first started this tradition, it was as a coping mechanism for insomnia. They'd both grown into conversation, first commenting on the onscreen events, then going off on related tangents until they'd finally reached the point to where the screen served as background noise rather than the main attraction. He and Natasha aren't nearly at that level of intimacy, and Steve mentally curses his friend for leaving him to mediate this very awkward interaction, but the television soothes the situational awkwardness, at least temporarily.
Unhooking his arm from the straps of his shield, he rotates the shield so that it’s parallel to the ground and curls his body inward,  If she’s anything like Loki, this won’t kill the enchantress, but it should be more than enough to stop her temporarily.  Putting all of his strength into his right arm, he tosses the shield like a discus in a direct line toward the levitating woman.
Not wanting to give Tony too much time to think things over, Steve settles in and gazes toward the ceiling.  “JARVIS, could you pull up the next movie in the queue?”
It takes him a moment to connect the deeper, slightly automated voice with Tony’s usual drawl.  When he finally gets to the content from what Tony’s just said, he glances at the armor in confusion.  Has Tony added handholds or something?
“No, he was perfectly clear on the matter,” JARVIS answers blithely. “I can patch you through to his com if you would like to speak with him yourself.”
Well, Steve posits, it was sort of hard not to ‘observe’ after this morning. “I’ll stop if it bothers you.”
“Punching Nazis is straightforward and emotionally satisfying. Small talk is…” he struggles to find the right words; there aren’t any, so he just blurts out everything. “Natasha Stark the richest woman in the world, has five PhDs, and has the President of the United States on speed dial.”
“You are terrible at this,” he laughs against Steve’s shoulder.  "Oh my God, how are you so terrible at this?"
“Yeah, that’s something she tends to do.”  Tony stays silent for a few moments before adding on softly, “I talked to her about you.”
He wants so dearly to take that invitation and head back upstairs as fast as the elevator will carry him, and he almost does. Then he curses himself for a coward and turns back around.
“Home,” Steph echoes, somewhat surprised to find that she actually means the word.  She circles her arm around Tasha’s waist, looking out over a skyline that’s changed but that she still loves desperately.  She pulls herself closer to the woman who’s grown from a nuisance to a friend and now holds the possibility of being something much dearer.  “Yeah, let’s go home.”
“Iron Man?  Yup.”  How does he even begin to describe the impact the suits have had on his life?  To be honest, he’s not even sure that he fully understands the distinction.   All he knows is that his life has been bisected into two discrete eras, dating from the moment the Mark I visor slid down over his face.  How do you even vocalize something like that?  Plus, there’s the added difficulty of having to account for the suit and what it means to him while still keeping up the ruse that some third party is piloting it.
“Not about that kiss, I hope.” Natasha seems less concerned with the possibility of injury than Steve is, and she keeps her hands locked around his neck. “It’s just a flesh wound. I’ll survive, but we probably should hold off on the hot and heavy stuff for a little while.”
Tony’s brain simply cannot process the implications of said flowers.  He can describe them; Steve is holding a tasteful bouquet of red, orange, and yellow flowers –
JARVIS takes a moment before responding.  “That’s a bit harder to classify.  According to what I can gather, some users construct their own files, through somewhat questionably legal means.  Others pull their reactions from hosted websites, but the labeling system is somewhat sporadic.  Most usages of the gif rely on the ingenuity of the user and ability of the recipient to interpret the humorous juxtaposition.”
“You’ve never said anything before.” He tries to keep the bitterness out of his voice, but he must not succeed entirely given Iron Man’s reaction.
He finds himself stymied by a pair of frosted glass doors that his key card doesn’t authorize him to enter, and given that the purpose of this little excursion is to apologize, he doubts his usual shield-in-door method of opening doors would advance his cause. He settles for knocking, hoping that he trips some sort of security alarm that will alert Natasha to his presence. Given the amount of time that’s worked in his disfavor, the universe owes him one.
A string of emojis that she has absolutely no idea of how to interpret follows the explicative.  She can’t really make out the meaning and she has no idea who Katie McGrath is, but the context clues are fairly self-explanatory.  What she doesn’t know is how to respond.
Steve can feel the heat rising in his cheek’s a JARVIS’ barrage of semi-compliments.  It’s...comforting to think that his presence helps Tony in some small way, particularly since so much of his own day-to-day life seems to rely on Tony.
He stops pacing when he sees a glimpse of red flying in from the southwest, and his eyes fixate on the fast-moving blur. Something is off, but it’s only when the suit draws nearer to the pad that Steve realizes what’s wrong; there’s only one person flying toward the tower.
“Damn,” Clint answers, his eyes contemplative.  “That’s got to put you in a tight spot, with the whole super-soldier plus Avenger plus the frozen, time-travelish thing.”
He really has no sense of how long it takes Steve to come down, but every added second is far too long.  After an interminably long span, Steve finally manages to choke out a word.
,” Stark stresses, “is Dum-E.  He’s a helper-bot.  Well, he’s meant to be a helper-bot, but most of the time he’s just sort of a substandard lab assistant.  He makes mediocre kale smoothies and rarely follows instructions, but he’s mine, and I’d appreciate if you didn’t punch him into oblivion.”
“I’m right here,” he answers in a soft tone he doesn’t often allow himself to use within other people’s hearing, but he can’t stand hearing that broken, raspy note in Steve’s voice.  “What do you need?”  When the other man doesn’t answer, he tries a different approach.  “What happened?”
He stands quickly, muscles bristling at the sudden movement, and reaches for his bag.  After all the times he’s ribbed Clint for being late, he’s going to catch hell for not showing up on time for training.  Still, if he had to do it all over again, he wouldn’t change a thing.  “In that case then, I’ll see you tonight.”
At long last, Tony makes eye contact, and he moves his hand out from underneath Steve’s.  Steve tries not to take that as a bad sign.  “Look, there are about a million reasons why this is not a good idea.”
She steps in closer, using her not-inconsiderable height to her advantage.  “Someone might get the right impression.”
Steve can tell the exact moment when Tony finally gets it.  His eyes, which had previously been scrunched up in confusion, grow to the size of saucers, and his entire body gives a notable jerk.  Steve is somewhat put off by Tony’s surprise, given that they’ve sort of been flirting for months.  Sure, they’ve never talked about it before, but it’s not as if any of this is coming out of left field.  Tony, though, doesn’t seem to have gotten that memo, because he’s acting as if Steve’s just randomly broken into tap number or something equally bizarre.  When he finally gets around to speaking again, his voice is alarmingly faint.
Tony carries on.  “You sort of forced to think about what’s important and if some secrets are really worth keeping.”
“Anything for a fellow Avenger,” Tony answers back before turning to his electronics.  Steve still gets the feeling he’s missing something.
“Good.”  Tony nods.  He wasn’t sure how open Steve would be to this idea.  “Here’s what we do.  JARVIS has a set number of films queued up for you to watch.  As you watch a movie, make a note of anything that confuses you, and I can answer your questions later.  Over time, we should be able to get a general idea of what your strengths and weakness are.”
“Nice to see you too.”  Steve hands over the bag with a bemused smile on his face.  “I wasn’t sure what you liked, so I just sort of got a variety.  Your cream cheese is in there too.”
Pepper sighs.  “Look, I’m not your assistant or your Mom, so I’m not going to tell you how to live your life.  Just do whatever you think is best.  But if you think this can turn into something real, don’t start out by keeping secrets.”
Steve tenses, but he doesn’t stop talking.  “Yeah.  Sorry, I’ve just gotten used to using her name instead of her call sign.”
Okay, so he’s definitely got a thing for the suit.  He’s somewhat grateful that Tony’s face is covered at the moment because he has a sneaking suspicion the other man is laughing at him.
“Well,” Steve answers, gripping onto Tony’s forearms and dragging himself into a sitting position.  “That settles it then.”
Clint’s hand comes up to his head.  “Yeah.  Not all of us can have a sugar daddy like Stark,” he answers, rubbing his scalp.
“I’m not sure exactly what you want me to do.  You’re clearly working on the more important project, and I don’t want you to change your mind.”
He raises an eyebrow at the sheer mass of pizza she slaps on a plate, but she brushes him off. “Relax, Super Stomach. We can always order more.”
Despite the complicated array of feelings that have passed through his head throughout the morning, Steve knows he still has to make amends with one more person, no matter how much his stomach churns at the thought.
They spend a few more moments like that, just kissing and grasping each other until Tony pulls away for air.
“Yes.  They’re wonderful.”  A dazzling smile crosses her face, and she finally turns to look at Steve.  “It’s a shame you don’t talk to them more often.”
“Okay, so we’ve got you the latest line-up.  This,” he says, picking up one of the smaller rectangles, “is a StarkPhone 11.  I’ve already transferred all of your data from your dinosaur, so we never need to speak of it again.  Yes, it makes calls, but it’s also a web browser, a high-resolution camera, a GPS, a 64 GB music player, so on and so forth.  ”
(He’s mentally labored to get that scenario to work out in his favor, but, let’s face it, between the two of them, Steve will always end up as Prince Charming.  Oh well.  If he’s going to work that metaphor, at least he’ll end up with some really advanced, custom fit, repulsor-propelled thrusters as a consolation prize.  Which he will immediately reverse engineer and upgrade.)
until we’re all in position.  We don’t know what we’re dealing with, so it’s best if we approach this thing as a team.”
“The problem is he’s late! When Loki and his alien army attacked, he wrecked two of our three operational Helicarriers. And I think you saw firsthand what happened to the third one on the way back from Germany.”
Natasha's lab is sort of like the secret lair of Stark Tower. The further underground you go, the higher your security clearance must be, and only the woman herself and Iron Man have access to the most important rooms on the ground floor. Steve assumes this is where the magic happens. All he knows is that Natasha Stark and Iron Man disappear into this room late at night and Iron Man emerges the next day with technical upgrades.
Excluding Clint, of course.  The moment before the ball hits the target, an arrow whizzes by and strikes it dead center.  The ensuing momentum propels the ball into the center of the bullseye, where it’s firmly pinned with a soft
He looks straight into Steve’s beautiful eyes, currently blown wide with need.  He needs to clarify so many things now that he finally can.
Iron Man shifts at that, punching out a rebuttal in a baffled staccato. “You. Are. Captain. America. You fought Nazis. You
“Here’s to that.” Tony inclines his head in acknowledgment.  “Sorry I’m not the best company right now.  I’ve just got a lot on my mind.”
Steve looks up and down and the statues, and Tony can tell what he’s thinking.  The giant oversized horse looks bizarre without its traditional pedestal.  “That’s…different,” he offers.
It’s a bit stupid that this is the thought goes through his head the first time Tasha kisses him, but he’s spent the past couple of hours mentally hammering into his brain that Shellhead and Stark are one and the same. He’d just about finished mentally placing Natasha’s form inside familiar red boots, so it’s somewhat of a shock that he has to lean down to kiss her. The suit must have lifts, which he definitely has to tease her about later.
dysfunctional bot.  It seemed unfair to tear him to pieces just because he had a few personality flaws.  Whatever.  He’s allowed to be sentimental every once in awhile, even if it occasionally results in him chugging motor oil smoothies.
changed, at least on his end. For better or worse, he’s realized a few things about himself, and there’s no putting the smoke back in the box now. He has no idea how to explain any of this.
Clint’s reply is breathless but strong.  “I did not join an elite paramilitary organization to fight Balto!”
Despite Tony’s humorous tone, Steve can’t help but feel that the other man’s struck a nerve.  Pretty much everything he’s just said has some grain of truth embedded in it, and therein lies the problem.  He crashed that plane into the Atlantic fully willing to give his life for his country, and he would do it again in a heartbeat, but he’s not quite sure if the country that he died for is the same country he woke up to.  Everyone’s assured him that he’ll adjust, in time, but they’re never able to specify just how much time that adjustment will take.
Except the same thing happened the next day.  And the next.  And the next.  Every day when Tony left the lab, he’s met with Rogers’ “Is this a good time?” and every morning when he came down, Rogers was there with his “How about now?”  He didn’t think such innocuous phrases could sound so infuriating, but those particular combinations of words are now a sure-fire way to set him off.
Steve is mildly impressed by Fury’s deductions. In a very short amount of time, the director has drawn a surprisingly accurate conclusion about his willingness to modify the rules if they impede his ability to do what’s right. He’s impressed by Fury’s insight, but he’s not sure if he’s comfortable with him knowing that much information.
Startled, he looks up to find Clint and Natasha staring at him.  Nat’s clutching yet another tennis ball loosely in her fist as if she’s ready to continue throwing, but Clint’s holding his bow haphazardly to his side.  Oh, right.  They were sort of in the middle of something.
corny.)  But Pepper’s right; you can’t exactly build something real on a weak foundation.  If he wants something genuine – and, scarily, he does – he needs to lay all his cards on the table.
He finally breaks out of his monologue and looks up at Steve.  Right, that spiel probably made no sense to someone who’s not been exposed to cinematic genius and/or has spent far too much time fighting a war in the desert.
Tony finally steps away from the power grinder and places the metal plate to the side.  It takes him a moment to turn back and face Steve, but he takes his glasses off his face as he pivots.  His eyes seem to be searching for...something, but for the life of him Steve can’t figure out what that something is.
, sending him sprawling back against the dark red duvet.  He fully expects Tony to follow him, to continue on the path that they were both so thoroughly enjoying, but he doesn’t.  Instead, he braces one hand on either side of his body, and stares down at Steve with an openness that he’s never seen from Tony before.
Steve wedges the small device into his ear and begins speaking, hoping that someone on the other end of the line will have more answers.  “Status?”
“Eh, lie of omission,” Stark answers back.  “Besides, it’s still technically true.  Just keep telling me how much SHIELD would appreciate their shiny new toys, I’ll keep telling you to fuck off, and we’re good to go!”
"Oh," he breathes, hand tightening on Steve’s arm.  He can’t lose this, can’t lose Steve, now that he’s finally within his reach. "Oh, God, Steve, I didn't know--"
There’s a moment of dead quiet after he finished his little tirade, and Steve fears that he’s tipped his hand. It’s a speech that demands a response but, really, what is there to say? No matter the reply, Steve really doesn’t think he can stick around to hear it. He stands.
“Someone has to bring home the big bucks,” Tasha shoots back, crouching down to pull off a pair of painful looking stilettos.  “You know,” she remarks, gesturing with a shoe, “you’re more than welcome to tag along to any of these shindigs if you ever want to reprise your role as a chorus girl.”
A couple of months ago she wouldn’t have had any idea how to interpret the range of emotions that pass over Tasha’s face.  She’s still not quite sure — it’s probably never going to be possible to understand Tasha completely — but she thinks she can make out shock, confusion, anger, fear, and maybe, just maybe, hope.  With any luck, the jumble of reactions will work out in her favor or at least not completely against her.
The best possible way he envisions the big reveal going down is where Steve’s finally comes out and confesses.  Hypothetical Steve is so guilty about his double-life that he just spills everything.  That’s the point where he can be all,
, and all of those things come together to make one lust-inducing yet eternally unavailable paragon of human perfection.  If he’s going to be wallowing around in angst and self-loathing, then dammit, he should be getting sex out of it:  mind-blowing, athletic, slightly-guilty Steve sex with kinky foreplay and feeling-laced orgasms.  Instead, he’s living the life of a fourteen-year-old girl who’s nervous about going to second base.  (At least, he assumes this is what fourteen-year-olds do; at that age, he was already at MIT, and his ‘dates’ involved a not-insignificant amount of alcohol and other such substances.)  And, unfortunately for him, actually getting to second base will ruin everything.
Tony’s head tilts downward, and he mumbles something softly under his breath.  Without his enhanced hearing, he probably wouldn’t have been able to make out Tony’s muttered words:
“No, you’re not,” Natasha answers calmly.  “Not even I can manage to toss you this frequently.  What gives?”
Tony’s attention gravitates toward the sound of that voice.  He’s met by a pair of stunningly blue sapphire eyes, which, while disoriented and groggy, are most assuredly
, which had the possibility to evolve into something more, when a shrieking alarm cut through the air and utterly ruined everything.  In the course of an instant, he and Tony had shifted from doing – whatever it was they were doing – into red alert mode.
It takes a moment to process what Stark’s just said, but the implications of his findings are almost too overwhelming to believe.  He can’t even think of what that would mean – for the environment, the economy, employment – if Stark’s proposal actually works.  Judging from the near-manic look in the inventor’s eyes, it’s only a matter of time before it shifts from a possibility to a certainty.
Tony’s got all of the requisite security clearance anyway; if this all works out – and Steve’s praying that it will – there’s no reason that Tony can’t know he’s Captain America.  After all, he already knows Iron Man’s identity.  What’s one more name added into the mix?
“Yes,” he and Tony answer simultaneously, which has the added benefit of taking Natasha completely by surprise.
“The three of us…” Natasha trails off. “Actually, it might be good for you to have the three of us all together. I mean, good for the three of us. To spend time. All of us together.” Steve doesn’t quite understand the need for the qualification when Natasha concludes, “I'll try to pop in for a minute or two.”
Steve can’t tell exactly what’s going on – he rarely can when it comes to Tony – but he doesn’t need to know the details to appreciate the sight.  There’s a long piece of metal, there’s a belt grinder, and there are sparks.  Tony is presumably doing something very constructive and very important my applying said metal to said belt grinder, but for the life of him, Steve can’t figure out what that is.  He’s far too concerned with the way the sparks from the worked metal are creating a soft orange glow around the inventor, the chiaroscuro casting his muscular profile into stark relief.
Tony makes an inarticulate noise, more like a screech really, but presses on.  “What about school?  You must have at least had some brief taste of reality there?”
“Yeah, and go ahead and throw in the A-9 as well.  It lasted the longest in the mock trials, but I still have no idea why.”
He’s never going to stop being amazed by the brilliance of Tony’s mind.  Granted, he appreciates that mind a lot more when it’s not working against him, but his brainpower is a large part of what makes Tony, Tony.  Now comes the hard part – getting that brain to see his point of view.
Hearing his name must trigger something in Steve, because his head lifts sharply.  Steve’s normally calm blue eyes are wide and panicked, and Tony absolutely hates the desperation he sees there.  He needs to make that go away.
“Well you’re going about it in exactly the wrong way.”  Tony moves closer and sits on a nearby barstool.  “Look, don’t take this the wrong way, but if you’re looking to make up for twenty years of living in a bubble, reading…” He reaches into Steve’s messenger bag and pulls out a thick book with a look of slight distaste.  “...
“Yeah,” his friend responds. The suit emits a noise that Steve has long-assumed means his friend is taking a deep breath, and Iron Man continues on. “I’m just trying to say that this…secret…has been part of my life for a while now, and the way that I…the whole…Tasha and I have been, well, what we are the entire time you and I have known each other, so really this doesn’t change anything. Our friendship doesn’t have to change.”
“Babe, I’m ineligible to wear white based on tonight’s activities alone,” she drawls. “Besides, I look good in red. You like me in red.”
“Don’t apologize,” Steve interrupts, mirroring his own earlier assertion.  “Never for that.”  They sit for a moment in silence, and then, for the first time since his panic attack started, Steve lips quirk upward in a brief attempt to find something salvageable in their mutually fucked up lives.
“What is this?” he asks, gesturing to the rectangle. Steve stares at the strange little device. It probably does something ridiculously complex, but he has no idea how to answer.
“She’s bringing the statues to life.  The first calls that came in reported that the Central Park Pilgrim was marching around the conservatory.”
He knows he’s going to need a bit of assistance on this one.  Not bothering to look up this time, he speaks aloud.
“So this is it?” Steve asks.  “When you mentioned that you wanted to rebuild, this is what you were talking about.”
“Don’t,” he barks.  And with that, he buries his face in hand.  He’s not quite crying yet, but if one more person tries to talk to him, he’s going to lose it.  Don’t they know they should just leave him alone and let him mourn in peace?
“Very well, Sir.”  Within a couple of seconds, JARVIS has the test results on the screen, but they still don’t make any sense!  How does the A-16, which has a higher electric load, still manage to underperform the A-9?  Maybe if he adjusted the…
Most telling of all, though, is the way Steve is currently holding himself stock still, as if he’s the one whose entire universe is hanging on the outcome of their conversation.   Tony is intimately familiar with that sensation.
“So my idea was to kill two birds with one stone.  I need to figure out what is it you need to know, and you desperately need culture.  Our solution?  Hollywood.”
I am single-handedly designing technology that will revolutionize the world as we know it.  Agent Muscles is currently making his way through the world’s driest reading list.
“Here,” Barton said, grabbing Tony by the shoulders and turning his body slightly. “You can pet him. He’s a perfect gentleman. But you need to approach him from the side, instead of from the front. Horses can’t see you if you stand directly in front of them, so always make sure you can see one of their eyes when you approach. Keep your hands down low, and touch him on his chest or neck. People always go right for horses’ faces, which can spook them.”
“Then explain to me why the farm is losing so much money. If Stark Racing is as successful as you say, then why has it lost millions of dollars every year?” Tony asked.
“No, ma’am. It’s too late for Black Widow to qualify for the Derby – there isn’t enough time between now and the first Saturday in May to get her the points she needs. She’s getting a late start because she needed a little extra time to develop. But I’m guessing that she’ll be a Breeders’ Cup horse by the fall, if all goes well.”
However, Steve had been gone. Instead, learning against the office door with his arms crossed, had been a tall, long-haired man who had looked vaguely familiar to Tony.
He remembered more kisses, Steve becoming bolder as the night went on. And he remembered Bucky telling them to get a room, because he wasn’t interested in watching them fuck right there in the bar.
Reaching his side, Obadiah threw his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him into a short but forceful hug. Then he stepped back, studying Tony with cheerful, knowing eyes.
Tony followed Clint up to the curving white fences of the training track. The morning fog had finally burned away, allowing Tony to see the entire expanse of the track. Currently there was only one horse and rider out – probably the same horse he had seen earlier.
With that, Bucky had stormed into the office, slamming the door behind him. Tony had stared at the door for an embarrassing length of time, weighing his options. Did he try to continue the conversation? Fire the guy, who apparently worked for Tony in some capacity? Walk away and pretend like the whole thing hadn’t happened?
Pepper stayed silent by his side as they made their way from Keeneland’s backside to the grandstand. However, Tony could feel her eyes on him, and knew that the questions would eventually start. Once they were seated in the clubhouse, drinks in hand, Tony decided to beat her to the punch. He started in on the story, eyes on the table.
Pint-size lifted his chin even higher, squaring his feet as though getting ready for a fight. “Exercise riders are the people who get up every morning to ride the horses, rain or shine. We’re the ones who know when the horses are not feeling their best, because we sit on them enough to tell when they aren’t moving as well. We’re the ones who teach them how to break out of a gate, and how to wait until the right moment to run. Being an exercise rider is a worthwhile job. Meanwhile, what are you? So far, seems like a bully to me.”
Looking around, Tony saw multiple barns, each one with matching grey stone architecture and shining green roofs. There was also a track over to one side, with curving white fencing surrounding it. And all around them were horses – horses in pastures, horses being led, and horses with their heads hanging out of stall windows. It was hard to comprehend that all of this was his. The twenty-seven cars in his garage – they felt like his. Stark Tower, SI, even his parents’ home – all felt like they belonged to him. This place felt like a completely foreign world that he had somehow stumbled into.
Steve had watched Tony’s interaction with his father play out, and had been dismayed. He had wanted to stick up for Tony – to say something to Howard Stark. But before he could think of what that might be, Tony had opened his mouth and started spewing belittling comments, first about Avenger, and then about Steve himself. And Steve had gone from wanting to hug Tony to wanting to punch him in the face. Apparently what they said was true. Never meet your heroes – or the people that you followed from afar and kind of hoped you’d get to meet one day.
Bucky started shaking his head. “No, absolutely not. You will stay the fuck away from Stevie, do you hear me? I don’t give a fuck that I work for you. You need to steer clear of Stark Racing for the next few months, until this year-long experiment of yours is over. Have you even thought through what this whole thing will mean for the people who work here? We’re busting our ass, and I doubt many of your employees know that in five months we’re all out of a job when you sell this place for a huge profit that you don’t need.
Steve looked back at him, defiant and debauched. “What do you think Tony? Enjoying being ridden so far?”
Once he had realized why the trainer had stormed away, Tony had searched the barns trying to find him and explain himself. He hadn’t been planning to apologize, exactly, but he did want the man to know that no, Tony hadn’t forgotten the time they had spent together. But Steve couldn’t have expected him to realize that the tiny spitfire who he’d spent a night with decades ago was the same man as the giant, ripped Adonis in painted-on jodhpurs.
Tony looked up at Steve through his eyelashes, smirking. “What do you think, Pint-size? Is it working for you?”
Steve’s dreams of being a jockey had died when, at the age of 18, he’d hit a major growth spurt. Thank god for Chester Phillips, who had hired Steve as an assistant trainer, teaching him the ropes of race horse training. With the foundation Phillips had given him, Steve had been able to strike out on his own in his mid-twenties and find reasonable success. Since coming on with HCF, he had slowly started building his resume up with stakes wins at Keeneland and Churchill Downs.
Steve backed away as Bucky continued to walk to filly, then turned towards Tony and Pepper. “Why don’t we head up to the box to watch the race?” he suggested. They both nodded, and he led them through the grandstand to Stark Racing’s box.
Steve caught Bucky’s eye, then continued. “This is a chance for me to train at one of the biggest name farms in the country, and to work with Avenger’s colts and fillies. Avenger was the first big horse I worked with. It seems right to see if I can help him become as successful of a sire as he was a race horse.”
“Are you going on about Tony Stark again? Who cares what he thinks? Avenger won! All our hard work paid off. And we are Going. To The. Kentucky. Derby,” Bucky enunciated.
Apparently noticing the same thing, Bucky put the brakes on. “Sorry Dollface, it ain’t me that got the crush.”
All of the blushes that Steve had blushed in his life (and there had been many) paled in comparison to his flush now. Steve’s entire body was on fire. He felt a little faint with it. Forcing his voice steady, he answered Tony, not quite meeting his eye.
Suddenly, the tiny blond man standing behind Phillips pushed his way forward. “Excuse me, Mr. Stark, but Avenger is a great horse. I won’t hear anyone say otherwise.” The blond stuck his chin out, his eye flashing. Tony looked him over, a faint smirk on his face. He had to be close to Tony’s age, though Tony had initially thought he was younger because of his height. While Tony was only 5’8”, this guy was several inches shorter than him. He was also incredibly thin, though Tony could see that his arms were lined with muscle.
“How about we start with a tour of any part of this place that has heat,” Tony replied, feeling the cold through the coat Pepper had pushed into his hands this morning as he was boarding the jet.
“I’m not sure exactly what I like, Tony. I’ve never done this before,” Steve admitted, looking vaguely ashamed.
Clint nodded. “Yes, that was your breeding stallion, Avenger. He’s in his twenties now. Steve rides him several times a week after the horses in training are done for the day.”
Steve stood awkwardly in the paddock, watching Bucky lead Avenger in circle after circle while listening with half an ear to Phillips and the Starks make small talk. While Steve was often at the track in the afternoons, he much preferred the mornings. Then, there was no pomp and circumstance. There were no women in dresses and brightly colored hats, no men in bespoke suits, and no huge crowds. Instead, the mornings at the track were dedicated to the horses, and to the people who worked with them day in and day out.
“No, absolutely not. No. Nope. Steve, tell me you aren’t considering the offer. You know what happens to trainers over there.”
“It was always about the Derby, both for your Dad and for the media,” Nick responded. “Howard would fly me up here once a month or so to talk about how the racing program was going. But no matter what we had going on, the questions always ended up coming back to the Kentucky Derby. He was set on winning it one day.”
“This side of the facility is dedicated to the horses in training. From when they turn two until they are sold or retired, the horses are in training to race. Some of them make it to the racetrack, and others never do.”
“I knew this was a mistake,” were the first words the man said to him, glaring from the doorway. “As soon as I heard that Steve had that phone call set up with Nick Fury, I knew no good could come of it. But that jerk has never made a smart decision when it comes to you, so here we are.
Tony nodded, while grudgingly sitting down in his father’s chair, facing Nick across the large, spotless desk. “Sure. Hard to miss it when reporters would start asking questions about his horses every year around Kentucky Derby time.”
Around the first turn Widow was next to last out of the eight horses, with a few lengths between her and the last place horse. Natasha had her right on the rail, and she had settled well, not fighting her jockey’s hold on her. Meanwhile the first two horses in the race where in a speed duel, laying down sub-12 second fractions. That was perfect for Widow – it meant that they most likely would tire each other out before the finish, allowing Widow to sweep in at the end.
Steve and Bucky stood next to one of the towering sycamores in Keeneland’s paddock, watching as a groom led Black Widow. She looked acutely aware of the crowd around her, with her ears pricked forward and extra energy in every step. Steve thought that in this moment she looked an awful lot like Zenyatta, one of the all-time great race mares. Of course, Zenyatta had been a giant at 17.2 hands high, so more than a hand taller than Widow. Plus, Zenyatta had a pronounced white stripe down her face, where Widow was solid black, without a white hair to be seen. But both horses had a way of moving that made them seem like predators, rather than the prey animals that they actually were.
“Absolutely, Mr. Stark. Every horse has a different running style, which is modified to fit the individual race being run that day.”
Tony took his mental image of Pint-size and added six inches of height and a hundred pounds of muscle. Then he aged him twenty years. What he ended up with looked a lot like the trainer who had just walked away.
“Right, Tony,” Steve corrected himself. “As I was saying, there’s a plan for every race. Of course, it can all absolutely change once the gates open. Especially in a maiden race.”
“I don’t know, Pepper. I just feel bad about this one. The kid I knew twenty years ago was really something. And Steve Rogers now is still really something.”
Tony stared in disbelief as Clint moved on to another stall. Had that been a joke? Was Tony supposed to laugh? Or was this guy, apparently on Tony’s payroll, really an ex-carny?
Tony didn’t know how to feel about this information. In some ways it made total sense. Howard was never concerned with money, so of course he had been willing to dump funds into rehoming and retiring horses that weren’t working out. Plus, with all of the horror stories that Tony had run into in just his brief forays into researching the racing industry, he was thrilled that his father was doing it right. Not only was it good for Stark Industries’ image, but Tony much preferred owning a business that was on the right side of history.
“Fury bred him to a select few broodmares over the past few years. One of the colts is a two-year old who just broke his maiden. I heard something about him a few weeks ago, but I didn’t realize he was one of Avenger’s.”
Steve held in another sign, knowing that the next bit of information was going to set his friend off even more. “Apparently Fury made a deal with Tony Stark to keep Stark Racing open for one more year, to try to turn the program around. And Fury thinks I’m the trainer to do it.”
“Avenger? Since when are they breeding that old guy? Last I heard, he’d been standing around doing nothing for fifteen years.”
“Definitely not,” he answered Tony, reaching his hand down to help him off the floor. “And my name is Steve.”
“Holy shit, what did I do last night?” Tony asked back, looking around the room for a TV remote. “Did I puke on someone important? Do I want to turn on the TV and find out?”
“I’m in the middle of an interrogation this moron is giving me everything.” She could already feel the long talk with Steve approaching due to her choice of words. Moron was enough to have stern words about her language. Sometimes it really sucked having a Dad from the 1930s.
But they felt betrayed, and it was obvious. Their daughter had been turned into a weapon, and now she was powerful, and about to face a power mad alien.
“You looked so handsome, when I first saw you in your suit I thought I was going to faint.” Tony said, snuggling to Steve. “What would I have done without you eh?”
“Sam! I’ve missed ya buddy.” Steve replied, wrapping an arm around him and holding on for what would normally be seen as too long. Bucky appeared soon after, and after receiving hugs from Natasha and Steve, looked towards Sam.
He knew he had heard that voice before. He had heard that voice so many times he almost kicked himself for not recognising it.
Ughhhhhh I'm not terribly proud of this chapter, I just wanted to upload another chapter before the weekend was up. Hope you enjoy the fluff anyway and please leave any suggestions of story point in the comments!
“Now, you carry the 3 over to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides. There you got it! Now the equation stands at Y=-3. And there you go, you’ve just solved an equation!”
Peter was still staying with his Aunt May, though it had been nearly a year and a half since the fight between his parents. Neither he nor Tony had heard anything from the other half of their family since Natasha’s rogue mission to instruct Peter. Over the months, Tony became more and more unreachable. He sunk further and further into his drink, and further and further away from Peter.
He smirks at Clint.  “Well, I used to punch Hitler on a regular basis, so I think I’m still in the green.”
Tony quickly shifts his attention to the HUD, wordlessly instructing it to scan for any and all signs of the Avengers.  It takes only a second to find them.  Thor’s bulk is easy to spot and Clint’s visible just by virtue of standing next to him.  Natasha is easier to spot, mainly because she’s in black and she’s kneeling on the black asphalt.  That just leaves Steve.
Steve hates to deny the obvious, but he needs to hear her say it. “You’re him? He’s...This whole time, it’s been you?”
Well this is...odd.  Other than Steve treating his oldest bot like a dog – which, to be fair, is not the most inaccurate comparison – Rogers is actually taking it for granted that the robot has feelings.  More to the point, he’s treating Dum-E as if the robot is someone who’s capable of being hurt and making his own decisions.  It’s great that he’d made the jump from “sentient machine” to “something with agency” so quickly, but Tony’s not quite sure what to make of Steve
When he sees Fury walk out of the darkness, his not quite sure whether to feel comforted or alarmed.  It seems as if he’s alone, but he trusts SHIELD about as far as his puny human self can throw them.  He clutches his backpack a bit closer.
“Since he’s more capable of looking after your wellbeing.”  Well that was just all kinds of unfair.  JARVIS, though, persists with his misinformation but shifts his approach.  “You will be in no condition to woo Captain Rogers if you are functioning with diminished brain capacity.”
“So, SI’s hosting a fundraiser tonight.  You know, one of those benefit galas where the rich and famous donate money to causes they pretend to care about.”
Steve immediately raises his fist in front of him in a basic boxer’s guard, but Natasha doesn’t move to engage.  Instead, she takes a step back and tilts her head.
“Not to mention the sheer amount of property damage our little group can generate on any given day. I doubt your neighbors are going to appreciate the occasional hammer crashing through their walls, and I give it a week before the noise complaints get you evicted.”
“Back, Dum-E,” Stark insists, and the robot turns around.  If Steve didn’t know any better, he’d say it looked...droopy.  He keeps his eye on the robot as it slowly proceeds back across the room.
“You have satellites?” Steve asks, somewhat taken aback, although by now he should really stop being surprised at the wealth of technology at Tony’s fingertips.  Tony elects not to answer and instead waits for JARVIS’ reply.
Of course, he resolved himself a long time ago to a somewhat solitary existence.  That was the deal, after all, when he agreed to Operation Rebirth. Captain America was always meant to be a symbol more than an actual human being, so Steve Rogers needed to disappear for the legend to live on.  A few people knew the man under the mask, of course – Bucky, the commandos, Peggy, Howard, his superior officers.  But aside from those select few, very few people made the connection between scrawny, sickly little Steve Rogers and Captain America, super soldier.
to be infinitely more distracting.  He humanizes the space in a way that makes the ultramodern decor seem homey and inviting.  Without him, the space transforms back into a mass of steel and chrome and glass that's austerely beautiful but not very comforting.
Iron Man is uncharacteristically quiet for a moment. Then he says, “That’s the second time you’ve called Natasha gorgeous.”
Aside from that, he’s got Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and several thousand employees that he’s responsible for, who might not appreciate it if Knock Off Terrorist #5 comes chasing after their boss.  Decisions have consequences – Lord knows Gulmira pounded that into his brain – and he has no right to endanger the people under his care.  No, he’s enough of a soft target as it is without parading around in flashy red and yellow armor, no matter how attractive that armor is.  Instead, he gets to lie low and send his “bodyguard” off to fight crime with the rest of the cool kids.
but his former ignorance has been stripped from him, and now there’s nothing he can do from keeping new and pesky thoughts from burrowing into the recesses of his brain.
It’s the perfect excuse. Better than an excuse, because it’s technically true. The three of them have avoided interacting for years, all content to operate in their little groupings of two. It would be so easy to continue on with the way things were before. But things aren’t the way that they are before, and they probably haven’t been for a long time if this morning’s little display is anything to go by. It’s probably his ignorance that’s sent him into such a visceral tailspin. He just needs time to wrap his head around the idea, and the gut-wrenching feeling deep in his core will quiet down.
The doors open and he proceeds to follow the instructions he’s been given, holding his breath as he travels down the final stairs.  Despite all the warnings he’s received about Stark’s technical sophistication, he’s nowhere near prepared for the sight that greets him.
Steve can see the tenseness in Tony’s shoulders, and he’s slightly taken aback by the harshness in his answer.  “No, I’m not okay.”  Tony doesn’t stop working, but at least he’s talking.  “In case you haven’t noticed, an alien invaded New York today.  Again.  For the second time in a year.  Even better, she apparently did it just because she could.  No rhyme, no reason– just straight up boredom.  How is that alright?!”  Tony’s voice rises as he finishes his sentence, his voice at last reflecting the tension that Steve’s seen in his shoulders all this time.
Tony, not JARVIS supplies the answer.  “All of Stark Tower draws its power from the arc reactor in the subterranean levels.  We’re independent of the city’s power grid, so we’re still running at one hundred percent.”  Tony stands, gazing out the dark swath below.  “I don’t understand.  What’s causing all of this?”
“No,” he slows down his movements so he has a legitimate excuse to do something with his hands.  “Do you remember a while back when you teased that there might be something going on between me and Stark?”
No.  That is not the way this works anymore.  Just because he’s slightly out of touch with modern vernacular doesn’t mean he has to put up with people talking in circles around him.  Without breaking eye contact, he brings his phone parallel to his mouth and speaks directly into the audio receiver.  “Ana, what’s a sugar daddy?”  He can see Clint wince and start to blush, while the tiniest smirk hovers around Natasha’s mouth.
The scene has been switched onto a cable news channel, where a blonde anchor is speaking solemnly into the camera.
“As long as you don’t talk your girlfriend into building you a Death Star.” Steve is proud of the way his voice doesn’t trip over a certain loaded word.
He settles himself into the cushions of the sofa as Tony relocates to his work bench.  Going strictly off the title, he assumes that it’s some sort of romance about the passenger liner that sunk back in 1912.  Why that would make a good premise for a film, he doesn’t know, but it’s far from the strangest movie Tony’s had him watch.
Tony seems to think otherwise.  “Unless anyone’s recently developed water powers, that’s not going to work.  Other options?”
“Point.” She steps back, and his neck feels colder without her hands there. “The team has to come first. We can’t let this,” she says, gesturing between them, “tear everything apart.”
“I was pretty much raised by my grandmother.  She...really wasn't a fan of technology.”  Gosh, he's horrible at this!  “When I was a kid, she tried to keep things as simple as possible, so we didn't have a phone or television or anything.”  Tony’s looking at him with a combination of horror and confusion, as if the words coming out of Steve’s mouth just don’t register in his brain.  For a man as brilliant as Stark, the idea of living without the latest and greatest inventions must seem bizarre.  He’d probably be horrified to learn that Steve had lived in a building without electricity until he was six years old.  That detail would probably give away the game, though.
He wonders what mental assortment Steve has to choose from.  It must be a pretty nasty bag of tricks to get him put on desk duty.
Which is the entire crux of the issue.  Despite having practically no experience at relationships, he knows that it’s probably not a good idea to start one out on a lie.  He’d been willing to compromise a bit if it meant he’d have a chance with Tony, but Tony seems…he doesn’t know what to call it besides reluctant.  Aside from their one conversation after the alien in Central Park, they haven’t really addressed idea of being a couple.  The only difference between “dating” and “not dating” that Steve can see is that they sit a couple of inches closer when they’re eating, and he lets his eyes linger a bit longer before turning away.  That’s all on him, though.  Tony hasn’t done anything remotely out of the ordinary, except maybe being a bit too peppy.  Their interactions are
She has absolutely no idea where Tasha is going with this.  Texting has always been a somewhat off-putting experience, a strange combination between a phone call and letter writing.  She’s not really used to the luxury of either, so having an instant means of communication so readily at her fingertips is still somewhat bizarre.  Moreover, Tasha’s texts seem to follow no logical rhyme or reason.  Sometimes she’ll send a link to something she thinks Steph would find interesting, whereas other times she’ll just forward emoticons and a string of random letters.  It’s mildly infuriating.  The woman’s hard enough to read when Steph can see her face.  Give her a technological shield, and it cuts off half of Steph’s evaluative criteria.  Still, this is the first contact she’s had with Tasha in almost forty-eight hours, so she’ll take what she can get.
Her statement immediately puts Steve on his guard.  Things have been relatively quiet on the intergalactic front since the Chitauri invasion, but this woman is making it sound as if Earth is acquiring a sudden reputation among alien spheres, and that thought scares the hell out of him.  Sure, this woman seems alright, but he’s still pretty hesitant about anything with otherworldly origins after his experiences with the Tesseract.
“I’m here,” Steve assures.  “I promise.”  Although why he’s here is another matter entirely.  He’s pulled a couple of late nights in the lab, both with Tony and since he’s been gone, but he’s never actually fallen asleep here before.  Nor has he really slept this late, at least not in a very long time.  Tony’s not the only one who’s been losing sleep lately.
Natasha Stark. Hate would be too strong a word given his lack of substantive interactions with the woman. But over the years, she’s made it very clear that her relationship to the group is a strictly professional one. She funds them, she supplies them with tech and that’s it. Her time is valuable, she’s not a den mother, and socializing isn't on her list of duties. If there’s something that requires her attention, they can tell JARVIS or Iron Man, and they will pass on the appropriate information. She’ll have the necessary equipment delivered directly to their floors, and if they could try not to break it this time, that’d be great.
“Me and Iron Man,” she echoes. Her tone betrays nothing and the room is, if possible, more awkward than before. After a moment, Natasha continues. “Did you need anything else?”
“Doesn't seem like you're all that gung ho about it though.” Her voice drops any pretense of humor and she stares straight into his eyes. Steve finds it hard to meet them.
Tasha does smile at that, and she raises one gauntleted hand to cover Steph’s, where it’s still resting on her own cheek.  “So…” she asks, “does this mean I finally have a plus one for social obligations?”
“Well, I have to keep living now.”  Steve smiles him, and despite the grunge and the sweat and the blood coating his face, it’s the most beautiful sight Tony’s ever seen.  “I promised you.  And, if you hadn’t heard already, I always keep my promises.”
“This is your tablet,” Tony continues, picking up the medium rectangle.  “There’s not as many visible updates on this model, but we’ve made it faster, slimmer, and given it more processing power.  This one also comes with a stylus, so you can draw on the screen if you need to.  And
– yet time after time he’s left with the corpse of yet another burned out reactor.  He’s going to have to hold a mass funeral soon to get rid of all of the tiny, mangled tech carcases.  Maybe a funeral pyre would be appropriate, since they seemed to enjoy spontaneously bursting into flames.
“I’m well aware of what Loki did,” Steve replies, back ramrod straight, “but that just makes the Helicarrier construction all that much more important.  What exactly would have happened if SHIELD hadn’t been there to assist?”
Well, when she puts it like that…  When he doesn’t answer, Pep takes it upon herself to keep talking.  “Tony, for anyone else
“I have my orders, Captain.” There’s an infinitesimal pause before the AI continues on. “Please, sir. She has her reasons.”
to Steve’s list.  Only the first one, though.  The sequels need not be mentioned, see the Jar Jar Paradox for further reference.
Ironically, the very anonymity that once gave him freedom has backfired since he woke up.  Everyone loves the man in the mask. Especially, the Avengers who helped save New York, but no one knows a thing about Steve.  Captain America is allowed to be shell-shocked, but Steve has no visible reason for being completely out of touch with the world around him.
It’s by no means his most inspired or technically proficient drawing.  In fact, all he’s done is recreate the scene just visible through the glass of the workshop:  Tony, bent over a workbench with some sort of delicate welding tool in hand.  The inventor’s mouth hangs slightly askew and his tongue just peeks out between over the left edge of his, as if an awkward facial contortion will somehow increase his concentration.  On the page, as in real life, Tony seems caught in the moment between stillness and movement, his inactivity poised to give way to finely-calibrated action.  He’s only got the bare bones of a sketch, and the items on the table are somewhat unfinished, but Tony’s hands and eyes are rendered in perfect detail.  Taking in the result of his inattentive sketching, Steve can only draw one possible conclusion; he has undeniable feelings for Tony Stark.
“Well, now, that’s up to you. Ideally, I’d like to get you out there working. Frankly, you’re capable of things that none of our other agents can do, and you’d be a hell of an asset. But I can’t do that until you get your head in the 21st century.”
Steve looks somewhat confused at that, and the hand petting Dum-E slows.  “How would I search for pictures on my phone?”
“Umm, because you’re smart and funny and great to be around?”  He tries to keep the flush out of his face, but he’s pretty sure he’s only partially successful.
,” Tony hisses, although it sounds more as if he’s saying it to be contrary than in any actual sincerity. In fact, he’s not even sure that Tony’s mental faculties are running at one-hundred percent at the moment, but that’s still not going to keep him from making sure Tony holds up to his end of the bargain.  Tony said date, and dammit, he’s getting his date.
It takes several precious seconds for Iron Man to reply, and the response comes out with very little inflection.  “I hear you.”  He extends his arm, and the familiar weight of the shield drops into Steve’s hands.  “The Group of Bears has broken through the barricade on 79th,” Iron Man intones.  “They’re headed this way.”
He doesn’t linger long.  Steve obviously can’t respond in turn, and he finds no appeal in kissing a corpse.  He does, however, keep his forehead pressed to Steve’s soaking up the warmth that still lingers there.
She is fully aware that Tasha is a grown woman and is perfectly capable of looking after herself.  (The woman in question has informed her of this, multiple times.)  Still, the woman attends a frankly disturbing number of social functions, most of the time not stumbling in through the front door until the wee hours of the morning.  And Steph has exceptional hearing, so it just makes sense for her to wait until Natasha’s finished…socializing to turn in for the night.
He’d promised himself that he was done with New York and all of the baggage it entails.  After the Chitauri, he’d figured he’d done his part, earned whatever atonement was left to him, and could continue his existence with the least possible amount of drama.  And yet, somehow, Stark had managed to find the one email address that he still bothered to check on occasion.  He’d followed up with weeks of annoying emails, peppered with words like
Well, that was just…endlessly infuriating!  So be it.  If Rogers thought he was going to give in that easy, he had another thing coming.  No one did stubborn better than Tony Stark!  He’d get tired of waiting eventually.
“I’m glad to be of service, Agent Rogers.  That is, so long as your actions are in Sir’s best interest.”
Tasha continues on, seemingly oblivious to the dots that are connecting in Steve’s head, the connections he’s drawing between his best friend and their benefactor, and the onslaught of conclusions that ripple through his brain. “Still can’t quite get away with a v-neck in public, but I flashed a lifetime’s worth of cleavage in my twenties anyway. Being able to shoot plasma blasts from my hands is a worthy trade-off.”
“Well if that’s the way you want to go about things,” Tasha drawls, bending slightly to grab her helmet, “we’d better continue this discussion at home.”  Helmet on, she pulls Steph toward her, extending one booted foot.
Rogers frowned and his eyes slowly shifted from coffee-induced guilt to stubbornness.  “I can do this all day.”
Steve’s eyebrows draw together as his eyes turn contemplative.  “I don’t know where I fall on that one.”
And that was just…actually, that made no sense.  That sort of crosses the boundaries of Steve being a good friend and strays more into the realm of…something more.  Tony freezes, convinced that if he moves too suddenly he’ll spook the super soldier, and tries to parse out
“If he’s so hard-headed, why work with him?” he asks, not quite managing to keep the displeasure out of his voice.
Unwilling to accept what his tech his telling him to be true, Tony rips at the clasp of his helmet and throws the offending piece aside with a vehemence that he’s never before shown to his armor.  Steve his
Yes, it helps, but it doesn’t exactly solve the central issue of SHIELD treating him like a grenade primed for explosion.  If anything, their coddling makes things worse.  Nat’s right, though; there’s nothing they can do about it anymore.  Still somewhat disgruntled, he turns his attention back to the conversation.
He lets himself into a dark apartment that he hasn’t stepped foot inside in months and certainly hasn’t lived in for years. A thin layer of dust coats his meager furnishings, and the air has that thick, slightly-rancid smell of a place that no one has recently occupied. It’s fine, though. He’s not here for the ambiance. He needs to think, to babble to himself like a crazy person and then stare at a wall for hours without anyone judging him. And he doesn't know if he can do that with her lying wounded in a bed upstairs.
Because according to Tony, that particular alarm was primed to go off only when a situation requiring Iron Man’s intervention arose.  Immediately, Steve had gone into Captain America mode and started scrambling for an excuse to leave, when Tony had solved the problem for him; Iron Man’s pilot needed to suit up, and he wouldn’t enter the lab if anyone else, excluding Tony, was present.  Secretly relieved, he’d immediately assured Tony that of course he understood and all but sprinted out of the lab.
Annoying is probably the best definition of their most recent encounter with the Doombots.  She’s not exactly sure what the story is — Tasha seems to have some sort of complicated history with their creator — but they’re relatively easily dispatched of, even with just the two of them responding to the call to assemble.  It’s a straightforward half-hour of fighting with minimal property damage, which makes it a good day in Steph’s book.  Tasha, though, has an alternative way of framing things.
“How dare you?!”  The tension in her neck and arms brings her veins into stark relief, and she raises her hands as if ready to issue another blast.
In the absence of any concrete facts, his brain fills in the missing information with what little it did know. He’s seen the armor lift tanks; it would be the work of a moment to lift Natasha, to guide her legs around the armor’s waist and settle gauntleted hands beneath her hips. To lift her high enough to meet an unmasked faced, since apparently, Iron Man didn’t need the helmet all the time. Or would he take the gauntlet off and run his bared fingers up and down her body, the skin-to-skin contact made all the more intimate by prolonged sensory deprivation?
Later, Steve will stop to question the logistics of an animated bronze statue firing working bullets, but right now he’s more concerned with the fact that a centuries old statue is reaching into his ammunition pouch and attempting to reload.  Thankfully, that make and model of musket takes anywhere between thirty and forty-five seconds to reload, so Steve risks a brief glance back and the woman who’s animating the sculptures.
Most importantly though is that he can safely count the night a success, because Steve’s still carrying on about the exhibit as they make their way down the steps.
The thing that Steve can recognize, even at this early stage of his epiphany, is that the aggregate is worth more than its discrete parts. Iron Man and Natasha are (were?) both complex, complete individuals in their own right. But the fact that they’re one and the same? How many sacrifices must she have made to maintain them both? So when Natasha asks if he can handle it, his only question is
Fury promised to think about putting him in the field. But as of yet, nothing’s happened. Steve needs that to change as soon as possible.  Despite his qualms about working without his shield and alter ego, he’s still a soldier, and one desperately in need of a mission.
.  Those things are each significant in and of themselves, but you throw them together and they sort of imply something.  Nothing bad, but definitely something.”
Steve can’t for the life of him follow Fury’s logic.  “Director, I’m not exactly sure I’m the man for the job. We just got through talking about how much I don’t know this century. Now you want me to talk to Tony Stark? I’m probably the least qualified person for the job!”
“I’m in position,” Clint’s voice resounds over the link, and Steve risks a brief glance toward the archer’s perch.  He can just barely make out a small figure prone on a neighboring rooftop.  “Tell Thor to put some space between them, and I’ll try to take this guy down.”
Tasha giggles, which is…adorable.  Not that she’d dare say that out loud.  “Of course you are.  How could you resist?  I am known to be devilishly charming, after all, and it’s not as if —”
Stark finally notices the awkward silence and turns to face Steve.  “I basically just have to build a better molecule,” he finishes lamely.
She struggles with that for a moment, but she rebounds quickly enough. “So what? You’ve been pining after some guy in a suit? Tough luck, Steve. You’re just gonna have to suck it up and suffer through it like everyone else does.”
Natasha shakes her head. “Not as much as you’d think. One of the biggest mistakes first time undercover agents make is their proclivity to overshare things. They spend so much time studying a profile and internalizing a backstory that they can recite it in their sleep. But the best cover story is the one you don’t need. It provides a framework for your character, but you don't necessarily have to share it all. Think about it. When you first meet someone, is your first instinct to give them every personal detail?”
bit overworked, and Pepper goes all mamma bear.  Give her an opening like that, and she’ll start blaspheming with words like “circadian rhythm” and “decaf.”  Ain’t gonna happen.)  On the other hand, if his brain is performing at slightly less than its usual brilliant capacity, the least he can do is appreciate the breakdown, because the man in front of him is unfairly gorgeous.
Iron Man deserves the world and resenting the fact that he’s seeing someone is just petty of him. But quite frankly, he’s never had to deal with the prospect of Iron Man dating because he’d never consciously acknowledged that it was an option. Shellhead had always been vague about his relationship to the suit, but he’s implied multiple times that he relies on the machinery to live. Steve erroneously assumed that would throw a wrench into any potential relationship. Given that combined with the Avengers’ hectic schedule and the sheer amount of time that Iron Man spends at headquarters…it doesn’t seem like there would be enough hours in the day. The lifestyle has certainly prevented Steve from forming any serious romantic attachments over the years.
The moment Steve walks through the door, Tony makes a beeline for the man holding the oh-so-promising brown paper sack.  He’s glad to see Steve, but he is particularly happy at the prospect of eating for the first time in twelve hours.
“You don’t have to apologize to me.  Never for that.”  Those kinds of thoughts need be nipped in the bud, before they can grow into something truly problematic.  “Besides, I’m…not a fan of the water myself.”
If he hadn’t expressly forbidden JARVIS from sighing in his presence, Tony had no doubt that his favorite AI would have let out an audible indication of his disapproval.  J will get over it.  It’s not like they haven’t done this whole dog and pony show before.  Besides, JARVIS’ code is backed up on external servers, so he really doesn’t see with he’s making such a fuss.  As it stands, the slight delay in the power uptake is the only clue he has of JARVIS’ displeasure.
Steve’s so wrong it’s almost laughable, but Tony lets the point pass.  He shifts mentally, and tries desperately to think about Steve and the issue at hand rather than his personal nightmare fuel.  “We were talking about you, though.  Sorry, I didn’t mean to turn this into some fucked up therapy session.”
As the elevator travels downward, he thinks of Ms. Potts’ instructions – get off the elevator, sharp right, down a flight of stairs, and he should see the glass walls that surround the lab.  After that, he’s own his own, but surely he and Mr. Stark can be more reasonable this time around?
“Look, oh furious one,” Tony butts in, not abashed at all, “in case you didn’t notice, we just got drenched in slime.  Sticky, green, foul smelling alien
After all, there’s something comforting about not being the strangest person in the room.  If he’s going to be weird, he might as well do it among friends.
Clint allows himself a brief snort.  “Mark it down in the history books, people.  I expect a commemorative plaque when this is all over.”
“Well, yes.”  Wasn’t that what he was supposed to do?  “I tried to tell him how important the Helicarriers were to SHIELD’s defensive operations, but by that point he’d sort of shut me out.”
“Steve,” Tony replies, “that is not a phone.  That is a fossil.  I’m pretty sure I’ve seen that exact model marketed to senior citizens during Jeopardy between commercials for AARP and Life Alert.”
There’s no doubting the woman’s brave.  And smart.  And beautiful.  And that she can simultaneously run a company, maintain her place and the forefront of the technological world, and pilot a mechanized suit of armor.  That still doesn’t excuse the fact that Tasha is just so
“Look, I appreciate you looking out for me.  It’s…nice, I guess.  But the bidding was going well,” Steve insists.  Far too well, if you asked his opinion.  Even adjusting for inflation, those bids had contained an
“Not obvious enough,” Clint murmurs back.  Steve’s going to have to sympathize with Clint on this once, considering it took Tony literally showing him the arc reactor for him to connect all of the pieces.
“It’s uncertain at this time,” JARVIS calls, “but the power failure seems to originate from somewhere in Chinatown.”
Natasha sits up a little bit against her cushions "Serves them right. Honestly, this whole thing is beyond ridiculous. The one time I actually get shot, and it happens in street clothes. At a
Steve wants to argue, to insist that he’s ready to do something useful. But he really doesn’t have a leg to stand on. Fury’s right; he’d be more of a hindrance than a help at this point.
She’s not exactly sure what the event-of-the-week is this time, but Natasha comes barging in sometime after three.  Her hair’s more disheveled than it was when she left earlier, and she looks exhausted, but she still takes the time to poke her head into the library where Steph has (allegedly) been reading.
And there it is, yet another reason Tony is so irrevocably crazy over Steve.  Instead of worrying about the media frenzy destined to ensue if Captain America – gasp – dated a man, Steve’s mind immediately gravitates to the impact those rumors will have on Tony.  It’s not as if those tabloid bottom feeders haven’t tried anything and everything over the years to sell a few extra copies.  He doubts they’d stop at dragging Steve’s name through the mud if they could up their numbers with groundless rumors.
“What are we doing with a welding torch?”  Really, Steve doesn’t look nearly as enthusiastic as he should be.
Then again, the open invitation into his private domain really doesn’t matter if the invitee never shows.  He never knew Agent Stalker could be just as annoying when he wasn’t stalking!
He strikes back, uncomfortable with the direction the conversation has taken, even if he’s had the same thoughts himself.  “And the whole, Captain America, Iron Man thing?  How do those details work into your little couple scenario?”
