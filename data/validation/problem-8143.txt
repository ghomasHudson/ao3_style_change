Tony had gotten up, dislodge Steve’s arm around his shoulders, gave his best attempt at a growl and glared at him, consequences be damned. He snapped. “Will you stop that! This is
(Tony figured once he got close enough to sniff him), didn’t even try to talk to anyone and the rest seemed just as firm to keep away from him, walking around eggshells.
“That’s good to hear.”
in the first place. Nothing good came out of comparing two people. Especially not when one of those was
With no words to say Tony just nodded, but he embraced the hug Steve offered.
Tony and Rhodey kept a close eye on her as she circled the enclosed land. Her brown and white feathered wings becoming the only visible thing distinguished in the distance until she began to return. Even though they each had learned to take flight they still hadn’t grown their strength and stamina to remain in the air for long. Rhodey the most, compared to them. So far, even with his every day run and flight he could only stay in the air for a total of eighteen minutes before his wings gave away and he fell. Pepper easily learned to fly, gaining the skill as if it was second nature to her, and even gained the strength and stamina to stay for an entire hour and thirty minutes. Tony was in the in-between, only managing forty five.
“Tony - I - uh,” Steve stumbled. He smiled awkwardly, nervously.
Tony knew, everything he had ever wanted and craved while in his cycle, Steve would give it to him without question. For once in his life, he might receive the affection and praise and love he had always desired. To be held in warm arms, safe and protected, while someone whispered how perfect he was, how beautiful, how happy they were to be with him. It was a fantasy he always lost himself in under Hammer or alone in a room during his cycle.
Tony eyed it warily, conflicted. Piece of meat and vegetables floated together, emitting a delicious aroma. He didn’t believe his stomach would reject the contents, but just looking at it didn’t encourage him to try.
All the more reason he needed to find a hole in their plan and exploit it any way possible.
Vision released a high sound in offense. Tony plucked the little machine from the floor, holding him easily. He patted his head in comfort. “Will you both listen if I asked you to remain with Pepper and Happy here?”
felt it. The sudden blackouts where he was still marginally aware he was doing something but had no control whatsoever right after an extortion of power that didn’t belong to him. Is that what it was? The dragon slowly breaking through the walls. And if it finally did was Tony going to be lost forever? Were Rhodey and Pepper, too?
Having Steve so close to his neck revived the sensation, causing the skin just below his jaw to itch, but the alpha didn’t do anything. His snout was resting on his neck and that was it. Steve wasn’t making a move to mark his neck in any way. Tony relaxed slowly, letting his head rest over Steve’s front leg.
Rhodey pulled him close for a hug. “That mind of yours always wants to know everything, huh?”
It didn't deter Steve one bit. “Would you like me to carry you?”
“Were so.”
On the first of the next year, however, Tony didn’t come back. He didn’t return on the second, nor the third. For the first month, Steve didn’t see his friend again. Not on the second or third month either. By the six Steve had given up. On the twelfth month, he wrote a letter again. He wrote to Santa to please bring him back his friend Tony.
He had been caught. Turned out he wasn’t as subtle as he thought. “You’re not coming?”
The beta nodded, then his eyes lost shine. He looked away, eyes going down to his hands again. The shift so obvious it had Tony worried for him. What had prompted it?
“We’ll be careful,” Clint offered. “Travel the lands but avoid the fight. We did it with Jan and Hank.”
Tony agreed to the first portion of her statement but was turning even redder towards the end and babbled something when she winked. He left to avoid any more embarrassment and managed to catch a “So, you’re basically single, right?” from Clint and watched as he and Sam stood casually near Rhodey.
Tony shifted and leaned against his legs that were no longer crossed and tucked under his chin. His shirt had dried and now hanged loosely, draping over his torso and hips. He felt more than saw how big his shirt was. Steve’s coat, that he was still wearing, covered most of his figure and did an excellent job hiding his upper body and hips and preventing any curious eyes from looking him over. He was thankful for that. Not only because it stopped the Avengers from giving him pitying looks for his scrawniness, but because each time he took a breath the scent of Steve’s alpha musk filled his nose and made him feel relaxed and sated while at the same time made his heart go a few beats faster, heavy in his chest.
So much happened at once that Tony blacked out for a bit and returned to Steve still knotted in him and licking his stinging bond bite, humming contently. Tony sighed and soaked in all the affection Steve offered. This was the truth. This was real.
. He wasn’t going to just leave the egg somewhere under a tree or on the corner of Hammer’s room.
Maybe one day, if Tony hoped and worked for it real hard.
Tony watched the retreating back. That should’ve been him running out of the room, outraged at what he had just done and shocked at how his body reacted to being held by Rogers. A man’s touch should
” the alpha growled. “You would
“I’m sorry, Mister Tony,” the large eyes his boy gave him would make even the most hardened wild centaur crumble.
Confused, he nodded his consent. His left ear twitched when Loki got even closer, heading for his belly and moving lower. The python stopped right over his hind leg, apparently studying it. Tony watched him curiously, wondering what the python was going to do, only to squeak in mortification and pull his hind legs and tail closer to himself when Loki made a swift movement and held himself inches away from his tail. The snake stuck his tongue out multiple times, scenting and tasting the air near the area.
His trembling fingers reached up to touch the wound on his neck, making him shiver. Steve noticed. He guided his wandering fingers away to lick at the mark he had left, soothing it. The caring act made erotic by their situation only encouraged Tony’s body to grow hotter. Steve was well aware of his reaction. Months of coupling had made the alpha very aware of where to touch and where to lick and suck and bite to leave Tony a shaking mess of ecstasy.
“I didn’t know you could smith,” Clint sounded in awe, but not the type of awe that came from someone who just realized they could gain something with the newly revealed information. More in awe at having just discovered something very interesting with their curiosity sated and nothing else.
“Until we do,” Clint cut in, getting shoved away by Sam.
Silence filled their ears until Tony finally huffed and said “Swedish men and their architecture styles.”
“Vision for the last time if you don’t sit still I’m going to put you in the bag and hang the bag on a tree,” grumbled Tony for the fourth time.
“Is he always like that?” Rhodey asked from his spot in the common room. To Tony’s growing shame everyone was present in the room, looking at him in a different light.
Yooo, this took forever, but I got it done.
Together they walked to the patch, claiming spaces as their own and marking them off with their packs. Tony placed Vision down on the ground a distance away from the others. He felt his back sing from the release of the added weight. A long stretch cracked it in place and as if he shedded years off his back he had a brief moment of rejuvenation.
“I meant nothing by it,” Peggy said after seconds ticked by. Her gaze was now soft and careful. “All of you can relax.”
Tony was ready to ask her what she meant, to tell her none of what happened deserved an apology from her, but Jan was quick to lift a paw and shush him.
When Rhodey thought him calm enough he continued. “How are you doing? Any pains? Do you need water?”
Nearly purring from getting partially groomed, Tony was sure if he had been shifted his tail would’ve been wagging. And in a daring moment with high spirits and trust for the alpha Tony felt his bones begin to change. The hands gripping fur soon became paws and his legs were bent inwards as his limbs shortened. Smells became heightened and distinguished and sounds became louder.
Tony frowned at the thought, stopping it in its track. He honestly didn’t know if small discrepancies in their features defined if a pup is bared and raised in a healthy manner or if the pup would grow with lack of nutrients. He shouldn’t mindlessly compare features and assume one logic when he had no proof on the matter. It would only cause him anxiety and worry and at that moment he was far too relaxed and sated to allow those negative thoughts to affect him.
The bottom line, he had sex and a lot of it. He knew it. The public knew it. The Avengers knew it.
He had woken up groggy and disoriented like every shifter and wild animal usually tended to do. His mind didn’t catch up with his surroundings, but his memories were clear as day and he remembered the visit to town, Ben giving him work, Steve coming to his rescue and their pack congratulating him. Too good to be true so naturally he had thought it all a dream and his heart sank. That was until he heard a sniffle on top of him and he found himself nose to nose with Steve’s sleeping wolf form. Then his mind caught up and all around him were the Avengers in their shifted forms, minus Bruce.
- ?” Tony struggled not to swallow his own tongue. “
“Rhodey?” he tried one more time.
It was asked in a way that prevented any assumptions about whether or not Tony knew how to dress in armor. Tony understood the order of the set more or less, but he never wore full armor. Only the quilted jackets that offered the bare minimum in protection while allowing him to run, should the betas from his previous pack had failed to keep the danger away.
Tony could feel the stinging of fresh air on the bite. It hadn’t hurt in a sense of it being just pain. It had been a shock, yes, but the pain had been dulled thanks to it mingling with want and pleasure. It hadn’t been the worse he'd taken… just overwhelming. “It’s not that bad,” he manages with his head back. He might have even… enjoyed it.
“That’s wonderful, Tony.” Jan gave him another hug in congratulations.
Was it really that simple?
Steve shook his head. “If I had just seen the patterns for what they were I could have gotten back sooner and stopped it from happening.”
Steve appeared as if he had recently sucked on a lemon. “We are to fight Hydra packs. We cannot risk more than we already have. Too much caution will end up our downfall.”
“Well, when I was a child I once told someone I would make them my -”
“Is that?” Bruce studied Vision up and down. “That’s a rune and this is metal moving without assistance. So the rune is playing a part in this. Does Vision ever fall into the equivalent of sleep? How exactly is his behavior and how was it triggered? Does the rune ever run out of power? What is the source of his noise? What -”
“Now that this has all been settled, shall we return, or do you still wish to continue consolidating Anthony’s worth?” Loki said dryly, appearing every bit annoyed as he was acting to be, but his eyes showed nothing of it. Tony was amazed with himself for being able to notice. It was a subtle difference, but Loki’s eyes weren’t as dark as they usually tended to be when bored with the pack’s antics. His eyes were brighter, more focused, keeping watch for any important detail to pass. “It has been a tiresome morning and I, for one, wish to return to my practice.”
“Is he now,” Sam sent his mate a suspicious glance before he himself gave Tony a look over and nodded in agreement. “Well count me in on that. Say, Tony, are you doing anything later?”
, let me finish.”
Tony blinked back to Jan’s hand on his arm.
Loki waved a hand lazily. “I have placed a silencer. The room is secure.”
For a second he felt nearly twenty years younger and the little, scrawny nine year old alpha he met in that small town was there and standing next to Steve, sharing the same look but somehow looking determined, too.
He would go with sorrow, sure. By that point he came to accept that Steve had won the little pieces that used to be his heart over and the thought of leaving Steve was heartbreaking alone, but… Rhodey had been there for years. Rhodey was the one to give him his baby bird and was the one he called brother. Rhodey was family and… and he and Pepper and Happy were all Tony had of his once decent childhood. Tony loved… he
“Haven’t gotten a chance to use them properly yet. Or show anyone.” Tony scanned the area, looking for whichever enemy was surely out there. When Rhodey began spinning around in search he followed suit.
Tony kept the place running with little issue. For years it moved like clockwork. With no distractions and no obligations outside of the workshop, memories of Steve easily faded away. They were good memories when feeling nostalgic, but unnecessary on the grand scheme of things.
“Great. Are you all right to head back down?”
He whined. “No more, please. Let me eat first, then you can go as many times as you want.”
No, they weren’t. The Avengers pack weren’t like anything they both thought they would be, but was that reason enough to say yes and try it out?
“Jarvis!”
Guilt soon filled him. Was he to continue and join Steve and the others for the run? Or was he to remain by Bruce’s side and keep him company? No matter how much he wanted to run along with Steve he couldn’t do that to Bruce. It was a cruel thing to even imagine.
“I am! Will we see the race today?” Peter started jumping in place. Certainly an uncomfortable movement on Tony’s back but not painful.
“N-no,” Tony tried but ultimately couldn’t counter anything Loki said.
He came with a shout, clutching the pillows and blankets and bringing his knees up as he tried to close his legs, but Steve’s arms prevented that. Even through his double orgasm Steve continued his ministrations, going so far as to lapping up the slick that resulted in his climax as if it was a delicious treat and
That was a whole lot better than Hammer, and he’d wear it proudly.
“It’ll be confusing when referring to them by their first names, that’s for sure.”
“Oh,” was all Tony would say. It was certainly a heartstopping moment, and Tony didn’t mean it romantically. Steve came out of nowhere!
Tony gave a slow nod, a bit unsure. They might have lost track of time as one point, but he was sure they waited that half hour. Had they waited half an hour? What if they hadn’t?
” He had nothing to confirm the statement with, but also nothing to deny it.
And look after he did, if all the alphas and betas that received a growl and a threat in their town from Rhodey had anything to say about it.
” he said without thought, leaving himself to his alpha’s care.
Rhodey growled and Pepper stiffened, her wings flapping harshly in anger.
Tony kept a watchful eye on Vision as he continued his game. Fear began building when the roly-poly machine crept closer and closer to the edge of the river with every turn he made around the open space. While Tony had made it so Vision’s body was durable and did his best to prevent water from seeping inside that didn’t mean he was invulnerable to deep waters. The moment Vision touched water he’d sink like a stone to the bottom and Tony would have to fish him out and start the long process of drying Vision and getting rid of water that managed to leak inside. All the while trying to soothe his fears away. One thing that Vision was terrified of was sinking to the bottom and permanently staying there in the dark of the waters and being forgotten. He’d rather not have that happening in front of the Avengers
Steve’s breath stopped as he took sight of what exactly was standing in the center. It wasn’t a weapon he had originally believed. It wasn’t a person cuffed with agents surrounding them. It wasn’t even a discovered artifact that held power beyond belief. It was statues. Frozen statues. Statues that held the similar features and looked exactly like the three adventurers from the Marvels comics Steve and Bucky read. The figures were encoded in dark ice, shining from the light the agents had brought in. They stood in poses that suggested they were frozen in place while fighting, to be remembered forever in their last moments of their final battle. The characters Tony, Rhodey and Pepper were lined up side by side, Tony in the center with Rhodey and Pepper besides him. They stood with their knees bent, their front coming forward with their arms spread out in a threatening manner and their wings - their
“I want Tony,” Steve reached a hand out, ready to touch Tony Stark’s face and was inches away before Peggy’s voice stopped him.
“Tony! Hold on.”
“Easier said than done,” Tony whispered back then stopped in his tracks when one of the shifters, among the few that were glaring, dared to stand in their way.
“You did,” Steve shook his head. “You did. I didn’t notice what I was doing. I should have, but I didn’t. I was controlling you when I promised myself I would never -” his voice cracked. “I’m sorry.”
Tony had expected for Steve to dig right in and eat his fill, but instead the alpha happily trotted over to him, grabbed hold of one of Tony’s sleeves (Steve’s coat that he was still wearing) and pulled him gently in encouragement to stand and head over to where the food was gathered. Tony awkwardly followed, already feeling his face heat up slightly. When the food was within reach Steve placed the arm he was pulling over the deers flank, tail wagging. Tony kneeled in order to lessen the strain on his back from bending over.
at him, at his - uh,” Tony waved low.
Shortly after they disappeared another set of howls signalled the arrival of Jan and Clint. Appearing from different directions but facing the same goal the two wagged their tails and waited with anticipation for Tony to move.
The genius grinned, overjoyed that he found a friend in Bruce. Jarvis approved of the other omega’s answer and bobbed his head, squawking and flapping his wings.
Then on New Year’s Eve.
“There you both are,” Sam said from his spot in front of the arranged food. He appeared to have cooked again. “Good morning.”
“Sounds perfect,” Tony sighed, snuggling in when Steve held him closer, one arm around his chest. He basked in the security he felt in his alpha’s arms and in the afterglow. Back to chest he felt every beat of Steve’s heart, finally calm after their coupling.
“I don't want to leave Bruce.” Avengers or not, Tony wasn't going to leave behind the first friend he'd made since Hammer happened, since Rhodey left for his Military pack, since Pepper left for her business pack and Happy followed her.
But… “What if they don’t accept him?”
, Mister Stark-Rogers, you will realize how wrong you are. You'll have to fight Natasha for the title.”
, said this?”
Both Natasha and Sam appeared on either side of Clint and together pushed him back and closed the space between them to hide the beta away. “What he means to say is, we’re glad to see you’re fine. You had us all worried,” Sam said.
Tony wasn’t going to back down. He stared at Bruce right back and a fear made himself known. “He might not want me after… after I tell him I’m incapable of giving him a family.”
Hammer pushed him closer to the barred, rusted cell. Inside was a single bed of old wood chipping away and nothing else. Calling it a bed was generous. It was more of a lump that rose inches off the ground.
with it as well. Even the most patient paragon wouldn’t take in such an undertaking. Tell me, how many take you in one sitting?”
“I’d really prefer a bit of privacy… if it’s not too much to ask.”
“How do you feel?”
Tony’s breathing was heavy, his back was straining from carrying Vision’s weight and his two legs were aching. He couldn’t tell which leg ached the most. They were both in pain and all he wanted to do was lay down and sleep, but he was also hungry and his stomach was growling up a storm. Keeping everyone awake was a real possibility if he didn’t get something to eat.
It was Steve, though, that Tony was really focused on. The alpha had stood the moment they descended the stairs and, similar to the time they went shopping for clothing weeks ago, his face was open and expressive and almost an exact replica at the time. Eyes wide and mouth parted, it looked as if he couldn’t even form words, tongue caught in his throat. Steve gave an obvious look over, his eyes gliding on Tony from head to toe and even Tony couldn’t miss the way his eyes took a pause when they reached Tony’s waist and below. He fought the urge to claps his hands together to try and hide what little he could over his crotch area and also bring attention to it. Steve’s appreciative gaze sent hot flashes down to his belly and if he wasn’t careful his gaze could’ve riled him up further. He couldn’t show his brazen self to the entire pack and make them think little of him.
, but he flew off before I could make a grab for him. Slipped right through my fingers.”
“Puny gun no hurt Hulk,” was all Hulk said in the introduction, growl evident in his voice along with pride.
Which was why it didn’t come as a surprise that Bruce was included to their little traveling circle and hardly put up a fight joining them when Tony decided it was time to trade shacks for another further north and located close to a city. Living in the wilds was fair and doable as a wolf, but since Bruce never shifted and absolutely
Then Steve began leaving small kisses on his shoulder and the hand under his navel had its fingers creating small circles over his skin. His previously uninterested length stirred with no help whatsoever and Tony knew there was no stopping his body once it started.
He nodded and prepared for anything the alpha planned on, but naturally, as Steve had done so in the past, everything Tony had anticipated and was ready for never occurred. Steve surprised him, yet again, when he simply leaned forward to hover his entire body over Tony’s and kissed him long and gentle, nearly taking Tony’s breath away. Tony hadn’t expected this but he wasn’t going to complain. He reciprocated eagerly and even chased Steve’s lips when the alpha pulled away to kiss his chin and his jaw and down to his throat and to his collarbone, leaving a trail of affection behind.
No, he couldn’t think like that. The Avengers wanted them. That was why they invited them, why Steve invited him, because they wanted to have him and Bruce in their pack. After all, Loki stayed behind for a reason, right? He wouldn’t have stayed behind and caused the Avengers to hold off their travels for an hour. And Steve looked so happy when Tony and Bruce appeared. That had to count for something.
“No, it’s not!” Steve blurted, scandalized by the very thought of dismissing those actions. As if insulted by Tony for even daring to say it. “It’s the exact opposite of fine!”
“How do we stop it?” Tony asked with a hint of desperation.
Loki stopped. “You wish of me to keep your skills a secret, correct?”
“I might have overreacted. While it’s true not taking the suppressants before a long journey is extremely harebrained, on both your part and Jan’s.” Hank’s voice ended hard, expressing the seriousness of the matter.
“The sun is up, most of the shifters here are wide awake and I'm pretty sure we don't have time to get breakfast if we want to catch up to the Avengers,” Bruce answered, finishing packing the last of his blankets in his bag.
He had over-the-clothes action from Steve Rogers.
Steve moved to go after the pack that were now a good distance ahead and pulled Tony along. Tony followed without hesitation. The crowd nearly forgotten and left behind.
“You see the truth, however.”
Tony smiled down at the letter. “Hi to you, too, Steve.”
“You were saying?” Clint said dryly, still pleasing his mate by softly biting the point where jaw met neck and nibbling, earning a soft pleased whine that turned to a grumble when Clint pulled away. “I just want to say that I am incapable. I have no power to resist. It’s all his fault,” he said before returning back to the spot of wet fur he had created.
. He had to.
Ty stopped. He clearly understood that implication. “Ooh,” he grinned, “well maybe your taste runs more toward,” Ty looked back, “
“So I can…?” Tony’s voice was soft, hesitant.
He had been chatting with Pepper, or more specifically, he had managed to have a decent exchange of sentences with Pepper before Steve appeared. Pepper visibly tensed, knowing full well what was to come once Steve sat next to Tony. He would stare at her while pulling Tony closer, showing he wouldn’t tolerate her physically touching him.
How could he have - ? Tony had been doing his best! He hadn’t even been given the chance to fake his pleasure. How could Steve had caught on so fast? “I - I’m not hurting -”
“And I’ll show you more than one thrown pillow when we start our moon run. Watch your back, Clint,” Steve said as he continued walking up the stairs.
Curiosity almost tempted Tony to go and join them. Curiosity and this feeling of-of
“Home sweet home, children,” Bucky cut in before they could all get out of control. “Who’s claiming the bath first?”
Tony snickered into his good hand, Bruce also doing the same with his own, and allowed the two to pose a few seconds longer. “All right you two, you’ve had your fun. Leave him alone.”
“Tony…” Steve frowned in concern.
“We’re not going to punish him.” Both Steve and Bucky looked scandalized, but ultimately were ignored.
Sam was grinning a smug kind of grin as he lifted his hands in peace, wanting none of whatever followed after growling. “Meant nothing by it, Cap. I already got my hands full with him,” he pointed to Clint, who smiled and gave an approving nod.
Steve’s face turned indifferent, his brows scrunching up just slightly and his lips thinned out. He stopped walking, refusing to let go of Tony’s hand and forcing him to stop as well. The pack continued, giving brief glances to make sure everything was all right and moving along after confirmation from Steve.
“Forging?”
Steve made a very impressive impersonation of a fish out of water. “Why would you -
Oh… maybe Tony had misinterpreted? He pushed down the growing hope. “Is she… not?”
Tony rose to sit upright. To stare at the alphas that had ruined his life. Both sat across from each other. Tony was on the edge. It was easy to stare at them both. They paid him no mind at first until the sensation of eyes burning into them had them looking back. There must have been something in his eyes to warrant the frowns they gave. Seeing the omega they had previously tortured now carrying wrath must have been a sight and something to think twice about. Tony cared little for his safety and they must have understood. With no leverage over him, he was free to fight back.
Clint retorted by throwing a piece of his food at the alpha. “Laugh it up, Steve. You’ll get yours soon.”
“Ten steps behind you,” Clint told them quickly.
Tony sat upright. That was new. “I have armor?”
Tony took a couple of seconds to calm his heart and preen at the praise before following after the beta in charge. Rhodey joined them as they passed, having taken down two without a single shot. Seven less they had to worry about now.
“It’s incredible,” Tony answered, eagerly taking another bite.
She smacked his shoulder playfully. “None of that now. I don’t know what I’d do if you suddenly became pompous like those antiques who call themselves businessmen. I’ve dealt with enough of those to last a lifetime.”
Tony blinked. “A moose?”
“It is very much adorable.” With the hand now taking a new angle Steve ended up pulling his lower half up as he tried to get him closer. “My beautiful, incredible, omega.”
We'll see.
He hesitated. Of course he would. He had stopped touching himself years ago after it became evident the only pleasure he was to receive came from his own hands. It was a sad thought, and one that worsened the feeling of loneliness every time he did it. To save himself from anymore unneeded heartache he stopped altogether and neither him nor his body ever gave it a second thought, until now.
“- sent you a letter each week hoping one of them reached you, gave you months to respond, but you never did. Either… either they were really good at never reaching you -”
there.”
, was something that didn’t belong in the same sentence with Tony. He’d rather the alpha ignore him and pretend he didn't exist, no matter how hurtful it would be. False hope was the cruelest thing imaginable.
“I don’t really see any of you needing a beta guard,” Happy gave everyone a glance to emphasize his point. “You can each probably take me down.”
Steve released his grip on his hand a bit and finally allowed another expression to appear, a look of unease that switched to apologetic. “But that’s only if you want me. I don’t want to force you and I don’t want you to think you owe me anything. If you’re putting up with me because you feel some sort of obligation, please don’t. I don’t want that for you. If you allow me to court you I want it to be because you feel something for me, no matter how small.”
With one arm Steve opened the window and allowed the two birds to hop inside. “I see you are decent, Captain Rogers,” Jarvis pointedly stared at Steve’s naked state. “I assume Sir has been well cared for during his cycle of reproduction?”
as he does it.”
“Tell me how you really feel,” Tony said sarcastically, watching as their wings shifted in what he figured out meant embarrassment. In response he felt his own wings move in amusement and he mentally cursed. Even after months of trying to learn how to have a handle on his new (he still considered them new and will probably never stop calling them new, refusing to get used to them) body features he still couldn’t figure out how exactly they worked. There were moments where he could willingly control them and there were moments he didn’t even realize they were acting on their own. The bastard wings of his had a mind and were getting joy from making his life hard.
no, you’re not the one drinking the mixture.
Come to think of it, where was the beta? Tony hadn’t seen her return with Steve and the Commandos. In fact, he found it odd how Steve didn’t seem to mind her absence. Tony himself could hardly go far without Steve keeping a close watch. Wouldn’t the alpha do the same for his other mate?
“What?” Tony had no idea what he had done for him to receive that look, from his bird of all people.
Tony and Bruce appeared destined to be left behind.
“I want to feel yours. I want to belong to you,” he admitted, feeling ridiculous and needy.
Against his will Tony imagined how that would look and felt genuine fear at the - probably exaggerated, but what if it were true? - size and became distressed for Thor’s mate.
His heart was frantically beating in his chest and his palms were sweating. He had his eyes down but he could feel their stares piercing into him, demanding to know why he was still sitting and why he wasn’t making the effort to leave. He hunched his shoulders, wanting to make himself look smaller. His hands were clenched over his knees, trembling. They wanted him gone, he knew they did. He needed to leave, he needed to -
He had to make Steve proud. They were clearly important to his alpha. Tony couldn’t disappoint.
Bucky let go with a yelp that was more out of surprise than pain and reared back. Tony was equally as surprised and the rest of the pack shared the sentiment as well. Fearing they might have pushed Steve’s temper Tony remained still, waiting in case he needed to run from a raging alpha or somehow defend himself and lessen the blows that were to come. All that happened, however, was Steve letting out another bark before he huffed and placed his snout back behind Tony’s ear.
A normal, modern alpha can leave a fistful of devastation to those around them upon their episode, but what of a supersoldier? What of Steve? What if he went feral again while out defending the city and his team doesn't stop him in time? What if civilians walked in his path as he rampaged around like a damn animal?

“That’s enough, leave him alone, Sam,” Jan cut in before Sam continued, effectively ending their banter. “Just because he has a more handsome face than yours.”
Pepper hummed in thought, looking over the area. “Yes, I think that’s reason enough.”
aggravated, and Stane looked eager to encourage it.
balanced.
Tony did return. Every year when the workshop received Steve’s letter, Tony was there in a heartbeat. Every single year without question and hesitation. He made sure to give Steve the best friend he could ask for. Every year without fail, he waited excitedly for the letter, wanting to see his friend Steve.
Hank appeared next to him with a plate of two hotcakes before Tony could even say anything. “Here you go. Sam may be lacking in rationality, seeing as he’s mated to Clint of all people, but he makes up for it with his cooking. One of the best you’ll have in this household. He almost rivals Bucky.”
“We understand,” Pepper said. “Don’t worry about us. Just make sure to bring everyone back safe.”
During his time of brain shut down Steve had ended up forming a small pile of fish right at Tony’s feet without him even realizing it. It was more than enough fish for a proper meal to the point that leftovers were going to be on the menu for dinner. When Steve deemed the pile of fish enough he sat in front of Tony’s feet and wagged his tail, waiting.
“Stuff like this doesn’t happen to me, Bruce.” It was a little statement, a little snippet, but it revealed enough.
Sam had seemingly decided to go for a swim as well and was also down to a shirt and breeches. He wasn’t the only one. Thor was already taking off his last piece of clothing, showing the world his naked glory and revealing to Tony just how big muscles could actually get. If Clint’s toned body had made Hammer’s look like a disgrace, Thor’s body made him look like an empty sack with no definition and Tony couldn’t stop the little noise he made at the sight.
“Stop using my words against me.”
“Well, Natasha is pretty intimidating on its own,” Jan said, earning an approving nod from the named alpha.
“Not anymore. Not this time and not ever again. I made sure of that.” Steve growled. “I made a promise long ago and I keep my promises.”
In the middle of the omegas was a tall alpha not yet introduced to the public, but holding himself as if he'd been part of the Avengers pack for years and was heading to yet another fight. He seemed to treat it like old hat, radiating ‘military’ every step of the way and didn't appear bothered by the idea of heading to danger one bit, having been trained for it most likely.
“You know, suddenly I understand how Rhodey felt when you all put me and sex in the same sentence. Please stop,” Tony scrunched up his face. Too much information.
Not exactly the greatest conversation starter, especially since the Captain picked the moment Tony’s cheeks were full of food and couldn’t reply right away. He probably resembled a chipmunk. He swallowed, shifted his eyes back and forth between the Captain and Bruce and mumbled a “Hello.”
Thor grinned and took long strides to wrap his arm around Clint’s shoulders. “You are mistaken! Your mate does not surrender you to the canines, for Loki is of the serpent kind. Your mate is, in every sense of the saying, handing you to the snake. Be wary, Loki bites.”
He was truly trapped.
“You never fantasized yourself trying new activities in bed? New positions or using items between us?”
“I think he’ll learn to love it,” Ben laughed as Peter nearly made it to his seat. “Hang on there, Sport. Let me help.”
As if somehow he set off an explosive of some sort everyone slowed down an amount to a near stop. It was almost sad how upset they appeared to be and Tony not knowing why. Was he somehow rude to them without meaning to?
“I’m almost too scared to ask,” Clint said from somewhere in the back, bringing him back to the gathering. Bruce was now standing next to Natasha, eyes grateful and holding her hand in a silent thank you. She gave him a small smile in return, squeezing his hand. Tony could almost imagine Steve doing the same in acceptance, having pity on his heart, but what he imagined and what was to be true could be as different as sweet words said in love are to heartbreak and pure agony.
Tony covered his mouth to stifle a laugh that threatened to escape. He was sat comfortably on a sunken stone far away from the chaos with a smiling Steve tucked between his legs and chest-deep in the water. He didn’t have the greatest view but he heard every sound, every cry of help and every shriek of despair. It was all music to his ears.
Just wanted to say, thank you so much for still being here! I know my random updating schedule can be frustrating and I don't fault you for getting upset with how long it's taken me to update these recent chapters.
“Rhodey, this is my star-light, the Hulk. Hulk, this is my honey-wolf, Rhodey. The big guy sometimes goes by Bruce, too. When he's calm."
There was a brief tension all around at the knowledge of there being two other strangers nearby, but considering Rhodey was a friend to one of their own they weren’t at high alert. Rhodey took a deep breath, lifted his head to the sky and howled, calling to whoever he meant. When he finished his howl everyone heard footsteps to the outskirts of their territory. The footsteps came closer and closer until eventually, from behind two trees, two heads popped out. A strawberry marble fox peered at their surroundings, searching for any danger before venturing out. Right behind them was a plump wolf, painted with patterns of white, brown and black, two large ears that Tony remembered vividly, and carrying not one, not two, but three traveling packs. Two on their back and one in their mouth. A strawberry marble fox and a plump painted wolf… Tony was running to them before he knew it.
He was shaking, the fear of knowing what would happen if he was caught. No one would know of what happened to him except for the trees and the sky.
Tony grabbed the hand and gave it a gentle kiss on its palm. “I’ll remember, Steve.” Arms wrapped around him, pulling him closer. Iron and stiff hide poked at his skin. His only defense his thin night clothing. “I traveled the roads before. This isn’t my first time.”
Tony closed his eyes and buried his face inside the coat. He couldn’t handle anymore emotions for the day. He needed a long nap, then a proper sleep and then a nap again.
To catch the leader of the Avengers’ omega alone with only a noncombat beta while
“Trust me, this one is nothing like the cockatoos from this side of the world,” Tony couldn’t prevent the pride coloring his words and he didn’t want to. Besides most of his creations and inventions, Jarvis was someone alive, flesh and bone, that he took care of and didn’t screw up. It gave Tony hope that, if he had ever been given a chance, perhaps he wouldn’t have failed much as a parent as he believed himself to. As much as Hammer and Obi said otherwise.
His body responded accordingly as it always seemed to do when Steve touched him, but it wasn’t the time for it. Not when their pack was getting ready and most were already waiting downstairs for them.
Tony hummed. He didn’t recall Steve ever saying so, but maybe he had just forgotten? Or it was a statement said passing by?
Tony inhaled, trying to keep calm, trying to settle his panic - the fear threatening to come forth. Hammer always had a way to bring this out of him. To bring this conditioned dread he had for his alpha with so little done. Even now, after so long away from Hammer, from Stane, from this pack that had forced him to live through a nightmare, they were still able to make him feel childlike, unsightly and absolutely useless.
“I love you.”
“Was served devotedly by me,” Rhodey gave him a pointed look. “For years. I think I’m long overdue for some time for myself that doesn’t involve sailing the sea.”
“This is great,” Bucky had said. “Do you know how many times I’d lose that idiot when we were pups? He was teased a lot for his size back then but let me tell you, that runt could disappear like
“Tony, can…” Steve bit his bottom lip nervously. “Can you tell me… about yourself? Your past?”
Steve nodded. “That and yourselves. Our den isn’t widely known, but that doesn’t mean rivals or enemies couldn’t come upon it by accident. Without the entire pack present they could see an opportunity and that’s not something I’ll let happen without a fight. Dens can be replaced. Packmates can not. I’ll feel better on the road knowing you have means to fight and run.”
Tony gave a whine of mortification at the idea but it did the trick and slowly the pack came closer and merged Rhodey, Pepper and Happy into their circle. One by one his pack personally introduced themselves, accepting his friends with near open arms. Loki, Bucky, Natasha and Steve held back. Loki because he naturally acted as if he didn’t care and Bucky and Natasha because they were to keep a watchful eye for potential dangers, even if the dangers claimed to be Tony’s friends. Steve… Steve didn’t look to want to make any interactions with them at all, or at least with Rhodey. He plastered himself against Tony and licked around his face, not even giving Tony a chance to add to the small talk going around.
“I’m… not sure if that’s a compliment or not.”
Similarly to him, Bruce was also hunching, rubbing his hands together nervously and avoiding eye contact with any of the gossiping residents. Like before in the shacks they were all giving him wary stares, probably sensing something dangerous but unable to identify why. Tony wondered how Bruce had learned to live with it.
Also, we're about two chapters away from the official thing and for the mpreg to finally happen! We're almost there, guys!
“Not so much, Boss,” Happy said, ears perked up. “Rhodes over there has been acting as our alpha leader during our search. Pretty sure at this point we might as well call ourselves a pack.”
“I assume he was left without feeling of his legs as well,” Thor added with a toothy grin. “We must toast in your honor.”
"No. Read his letter, Darling. He wishes to help his mom. He clearly loves her and she him. He won’t leave her."
With ever growing energy from the knowledge that the Avengers’ home was getting closer the urge to join in on some form of cheekiness made Tony want to join in, but he knew not to push. The Avengers might have been welcoming, but perhaps they wouldn’t appreciate him pushing in on something that only belonged to them.
His throat suddenly grew lumps. Multiple lumps. Hurtful lumps. Somehow brought upon by just Steve being his sweet and caring self. This was exactly what he always dreamed his cycles would be. With care, love and affection, and Steve was giving it to him just as he had dared hope. He hadn’t realized how overwhelming it would’ve been. His emotions were getting away from him… again.
Get ready for an overdue talk, lots of gross emotions, past reveals and a long-awaited character that should've been introduced a long time ago.
Tony’s fifteen minutes of fame came and went. Now, he was a tourist like every other able body walking around. He walked with his carer and his carer’s family. Ben was a good carer. Perhaps the best, but that could be Tony’s bias speaking. He couldn’t be blamed for it. May, Ben’s mate, was a beautiful woman, for having two legs and kind hearted to a fault. The pair’s ward, Peter, was downright the cutest little human child Tony had ever seen and had the pleasure of watching grow. No, that wasn’t his bias speaking. It was the truth.
“I know it’s nothing like our old home, but after you ran away from me I think it’s fitting. Your punishment for misbehaving. Don’t worry,” Hammer was smiling. It wasn’t a pretty sight. “I know you’ll learn to love it. You’ll have to. You won’t be allowed to leave here for quite some time. Not until I know you’ll behave.”
“They can’t regroup?” Tony said as he, too, peeked through the brushes to see for himself. Rhodey was right. Their entire pack was there, minus Rhodey, Hulk and himself, and while it was evident they had started close to each other, the Hydra packs were slowly but surely forcing them apart. Together they had a chance, but completely alone with a small army after them? Not even the Captain could survive that unscathed, and from the look of it Steve, Thor and Loki seemed to be receiving the brunt of the attacks.
“Get off!”
“Then it’s settled. Agents Rogers. Barnes and Carter are to be responsible for our little comic characters. I’ll let you decide among yourselves who to take.”
“Oh? Perhaps a different kind of recruiting then?” Prior somehow managed to purr louder. “Just so you know I wasn’t talking about my fighting talent.”
“Steve? Hey, Stevie, everything is all right. It’s me, Bucky. I’m here to help,” Winter soothes as he takes the lead, hands held up meaning no harm. He’s trying to get on-screen Steve’s attention focused on him, but fails as Steve’s eyes flicker to everyone in the room, growling and bearing his teeth. “The team is all here, too. We’ve come to bring you both home. We just need to get to Tony, Steve. He needs the hospital. You’re putting him in danger.”
Sam tsked, appearing disappointed in the two betas. “Don’t listen to them. They’re just being dramatic and lazy. It isn’t so bad. Overtime you’ll come to enjoy the walks between home and town. There’s a huge section of forest all around and also a river that runs along the road at a certain point. Nothing like the smell of fresh water in the early morning.”
“I did,” Steve said with no doubt. Leaving no room to misunderstand.
“Literally breathtaking, I don’t think Steve there is breathing.”
The man had been furious, ready to scold his children for allowing such a thing, but Loki stood firm and refused to budge in Tony’s defense. If Odin attempted to remove the child Loki promised never to utter a single word to either him or Thor ever again.
He frowned, confused and a little worried if he was honest. “Why?”
“- or something happened to you.”
“Did you?” Steve sounded interested, happy. “Tell me about them?”
One week of living in the shacks and Tony was honestly surprised that Jarvis and Vision were putting up with the packless arrangement instead of running out of there upon their first opportunity and searching for a competent owner to take care of them. At least for Vision. Jarvis could probably go and survive on his own in the wilds. Find a place in the forest that had plentiful fruits and seeds and have a banquet instead of competing with the residential birds near the shacks for a small meal.
“Tones? Before you start thinking of giving us tiny Tony’s to run around, let’s talk to the others first. Are you well to see them?” Rhodey said.
“Yes, they are. Thank you,” he managed to say through the initial shock. He couldn’t believe he had discarded his gauntlets. The very work he had struggled to keep out of the wrong hands for so long and he simply left them behind for anyone to take. He didn’t know if the Hulk understood the gauntlet’s importance to him but he was grateful the giant had been considerate enough to grab them along with his items. “Could you hold onto them for me?”
Bruce hummed, resting his head against the tree and closed his eyes. “I think… I’m going to tell Natasha about the other guy.”
Tony buried his face on her shoulder. There were tears, but none of them fell. He had long ago stitched the wound it had created. The only pain he felt was the dull stinging of a reopened scar.
“We need to get down there,” Tony urged. They were meant to group up with Thor and his team, but either they took too long or Thor and his team were forced to act fast, moving on without them.
Vision chirped and lulled his head in a circular motion as a greeting. As for Bruce, the moment Vision came into, well, vision, Bruce had snapped his attention to the little machine. He appeared to be calculating in his head what exactly he was seeing. Tony recognized that look anywhere. It was the look of someone trying to break something down into variables and piecing them together in order to understand them and how they worked. Bruce was obviously a man of science and Tony just knew he was going to get along with the other omega just fine. He didn’t even care for the reason why every other shifter was avoiding him.
Tony scrambled to stand out of respect, and was very conscious of his appearance. If he was nervous with Peggy and Sharon staring at him, he was
Tony placed a hand on the little machine in order to keep him still, petting him when Vision gave a small whistle of annoyance that made Tony chuckle then switched it to surrender after Tony had said, “Dance all you want when you’re on the floor, otherwise I won’t walk right with you breaking my hip.”
, it was when the conception had taken place. A seed waiting to take root if you would.
He felt the familiar claws of Jarvis hopping onto his shoulders and settling down to nest and Vision’s metallic body pressing against his belly. A comfort he didn’t know he needed. To have his family close. With this, maybe facing the Avengers’ disappointment wouldn’t be so bad.
“From what I can taste, you require more than a simple splash of water,” Loki hissed, sticking his tongue out in a show of what he meant. Tony flushed under his fur. He was familiar with how serpents smelled their environment. Loki wasn’t just breathing through his nostrils, he was literally tasting his pheromones with his tongue. Tasting his smell. Tasting, in a sense,
Tony took one step closer and raised his tail in anticipation to the upcoming run he was going to go through and just as he was about to jump and get a head start the rabbit turned skittish and hightailed it from there. Tony cursed and ran after it.
“You know, in all our years together I don’t think I’ve ever heard you snap at me like that,” he said as much to the feathery ball of emotions.
“A-are you sure?” Tony still couldn’t believe it.
Sam shrugged. “No reason to apologize. You were making odd faces. You looked -” he paused, reconsidering what he was going to say. “Never mind. You were making funny faces Like so,” he then proceeded to make an exaggerated face that consisted of making his mouth lopsided with his bottom lip sticking out and frowning.
Without being invited in the door opened and inside came Bucky, his best friend with the very attractive robotic-like arm that he always claims lands him the ladies, but really he only wants to constantly remind Steve that, while Steve was the only planned supersoldier, he didn’t have the cool arm.
Speak of the devil his scaly tail was also making hell for him, given how he felt it flick back and forth in an amusing manner.
“Tony, are you all right?”
“I’ll remember.”
He carefully made his way over. Their gazes never faltered to the point of Tony having to duck his head in order to find some relief from their heavy stares. Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulder upon his arrival. It gave him comfort and the confidence to look up again. There was no reason to feel nervous, he told himself. He didn’t know who these two shifters were yet, therefore he had no reason to be scared or feel displeased by their show of affection to his alpha.
“I think I prefer traveling with the pack. I can hold my own. Maybe not to any of your extent, but extra hands can’t hurt.”
“Don’t paint it as a simple act that deserves a slap on the wrist.”
“If you are to shed tears do not clean them away with your attire. Freed tears from a past pain holds no spot for your attire to carry. You do not need that weight.”
“I need to take care of business?”
As he had expected Vision turned his head away in defiance and Jarvis pinched his early softly in retaliation. “You will have to tie us in place if you wish for that. We have never separated from you for long journeys across the lands and we shall not start now. Do not ask this of us. Please, Sir.” There was a hint of desperation in his tone.
Tony felt his smile disappear. He cleared his throat and looked away, a bit shamefaced. If he had been in his wolf form his ears would currently be down. “I ran into a pack while chasing the last rabbit. Stopped right in front of the alpha leader and rubbed noses with them.”
easier.
“What do you plan to do?”
“Are you to cry now?” Loki’s eyes narrowed. “From speaking the truth you begin to shed tears? I can’t imagine what engaging battle will bring forth. Surely you have more control than this.”
“A real cowboy’s hat!”
He remembers attacking after that. Remembers the way they scattered like insects, trying to escape. One floated above him, out of his reach. Two rolled out of his way, quick and skilled. One wasn’t so lucky. Not fast enough like the others. Steve pinned the faceless shadow down, gripping tightly on its large appendage located on its back. Refusing to let go. He remembers it screaming as he went to bite, to tear at the soft flesh of its neck. Eager to taste the blood of his prey.
Hank was resting his head over Jan’s paws and spoke without opening his eyes. “He won’t just fight you. You’ll lose an arm if you’re not careful.”
“Do you have water and something to eat by chance?” He interrupted. “They only fed me scraps.”
Then there was Steve Rogers. Captain America himself. America’s golden boy. Howard’s obsession. Mister sensibility and preacher of ‘self-respect’ and “have you no shame, Stark?” No, Tony couldn’t say he had any shame. Plenty of self-respect, but in order to survive life under the limelight one couldn’t afford shame. It would destroy you on the inside otherwise. Tony had learned this early on. Rogers, clearly, had not.
A male beta standing nearby and listening in to their conversation cut in. “That one omega don’t even look like he
Then the alpha seized all movement, making Tony panic. Had he done something wrong?
With luck, or perhaps past experience, the owner didn’t enter the room and instead left their folded clothing by the foot of the door, expecting them to find the articles on their own once they were done. Which wasn’t for a while. Steve had a tendency to tease more than anything and left Tony squirming under his attention. By the end, Tony was a blissful and nearly boneless mess. If there had been doubts about Steve’s performance or Tony’s satisfaction, they were successfully squashed.
“Waited half an hour?”
“Tony,” his alpha's voice was shrouded in grief. Soft and pained. “That… long?”
“Soon, most likely,” Loki answered, and as if he had planned it perfectly somehow a loud thump was heard from somewhere on the floor above them. “Our good Captain is awake. He will join us shortly.”
Tony nodded, wisely keeping shut.
“Caught this one myself first, boys. Ya gonna have to wait yer turn.” That warranted a laugh and Tony began struggling. He didn’t want this.
It’s said an alpha that goes feral is forever changed. They’re right. An alpha that goes feral will understand what exactly they’re capable of without their control and the suffering they can easily leave behind.
“What?” there was notable confusion in Steve’s voice that caused it to be soft.
“Traitors, the lot of you.”
. “Rhodey, get a bigger gun.”
The softest, fondest, smile he’d ever seen graced Steve’s lips. His blue eyes shined with so much emotion Tony feared he might burst from it. “One day,” Steve agreed. “Right now this is about you.” Without warning, he tilted his head back and drank the entire bottle in one swing. No hesitation and no worry. He had so much faith in Hank.
Steve pulled back with a smile, looking young and carefree. “Yes, Darling?”
. And after their mating Tony found himself awake for reasons revealed after his stomach rumbled and he wondered if there was anything available in the kitchen, and if not, could he possibly make something without waking the others up and without causing a huge mess.
Tony tensed up. He glared at Ty and was ready to give him a piece of his mind, but Peter called out to him from Ben’s arms. “Mister Tony! Come on, we’re going back home!”
pack. The newly named Steve Rogers didn’t need to know he was a Stark and piece together he could possibly be related to
Rhodey nodded slowly, as if talking to a child. “This isn’t our home, or our pack. Kind of guessed you didn’t want us here for too long.”
Missing who? If it meant getting a few more minutes of sleep Tony would gladly miss them.
Tony jumped to his feet with a cry of “Vision!” before he went jogging after the machine. Jarvis flew ahead of him. Tony wasn’t able to reach the machine in time before he met the crowd. Vision was small enough to squeeze in-between the legs of the betas and omegas and disappeared inside the mob of shifters. Tony stopped short outside the crowd, looked left and right to search for the machine and threw his hands up in defeat before he started trying to push his way through. The last thing he wanted was for one of the young shifters or the Avengers to snatch Vision away from him.
Tony eyed the ripples the wind created on the surface of the water. “Steve took me here. On our first walk together. Said he saw something beautiful in all this, so he brought me here.”
The idea of having the Captain, leader of the Avengers, ex-leader of the Howling Commandos and all around big alpha to ever alpha, as a friend, or heaven forbid a
Pepper stepped forward to quickly guard Tony. “Tony is not going anywhere!”
“Is that your way of saying I’m young? Because I’m taking it and I accept your apology and your compliment.”
Steve gave one more lick before moving to the other nub, giving it the same treatment and sending a hot flash all over his body. Those lips and that tongue sucked and licked and nibbled and it was driving Tony crazy, even more so when Steve continued down to kiss over his ribs and down to his naval and even further down to give the tip of his dick a kiss. Tony would’ve bucked his hips if it wasn’t for the fact that Steve had pinned them down, leaving him immobile. Then Steve did something he hadn’t expected at all. He took in all he could of Tony’s length into his mouth, enclosing Tony in a warmth he didn’t know existed. Tony cried out in pleasure, grasping the pillows for dear life as Steve’s tongue did things he never experienced before. He was never on the receiving end of it. It was usually Tony giving to Hammer, but as Steve sucked and bobbed his head back and forth he understood why Hammer demanded so much of it.
The Hulk didn't even use his sharp claws or fangs. Instead, he opted on balling up his large paws and smashing the three Hydra to the ground. They were instantly unconscious. Amazed but unable to stand still and admire Tony quickly jumped into action when he noticed Rhodey aiming his rifle at the Hulk, standing between the barrel and his large friend.
Tony took a deep, shuddering breath. Anger growing by the second. “What’s done is done and I can’t change anything about it. I can’t go back in time and stop my father from killing himself with his own creations. I can’t go back and stop my godfather from selling me.” Tears streamed down. Stinging, ugly and hot.
In the heat of the embarrassing moment Tony ended up releasing a mewl and dropped his head back on the ground. In doing so he resulted in coming face to face with Natasha’s upside down dry look. “Good morning,” she said, appearing to find the situation amusing but refusing to show it. Her voice had the faintest hint of mirth. “It seems Steve took it upon himself to keep you warm for the night.”
“I want you with me if you’re not against… helping me.”
Tony moved quickly to search for him. He didn’t know why Steve would grab the hat and he certainly hoped it wasn’t because the wild centaur suddenly grew a desire to wear cotton shirts and denim. Peter held on tight on his back. Tony was careful not to jostle him too much. Least he wanted to catch a falling child.
“Yes, Sir.”
“To what, Anthony? To demand of you? To ask for weaponry?”
. Not strong, but enough for Tony to want and ask Steve who they were. However, an uneasiness to the entire situation snuffed it out. It kept it at bay and all he could do was sit there and watch his alpha speak to the strangers he shared familiarity with.
“I’ve never… I don’t know where to start.”
Tony scrambled after him, ready to beg for Loki not to mention a word and completely forgetting the risk of angering the serpent for invading his space. “Wait! Please -”
“Steve, there’s no danger,” he said against the alphas chest, trying to calm him. “Shh, everything is fine.” He felt the chest expand as Steve took a large breath to calm his nerves. “Just me. We’re in a heat room. Our pack is somewhere waiting for us.”
His biggest fan, little six-year-old Peter Parker, had cheered for him the entire time. With a fan base like that, how could Tony ever lose? The very word was not on his vocabulary.
Instead, Tony, Jarvis, Vision and Bruce awkwardly followed behind the pack as they were led by Sam and Clint. The two betas had claimed to have seen the perfect spot in the forest while hunting for the deers. They had said it was all flat ground and green surrounded by bushes with pretty flowers and trees perfectly set up to block out the harshest of sun rays. There was even a river nearby. The same river, Tony figured, he and Bruce had smelled and planned to go fishing in.
Loki smiled at him. “You can.”
“No Clint. You are not going to shoot arrows with love notes at him.”
“What does it matter?” The beta moved forward. “What does it
Pepper tilted her head. “Tony Stark-Rogers. I like it.”
“No, he’s already filled with bullet holes as is. Let’s not make him thrash around and cause him more damage. These tranqs put you down quick. They should put him to sleep in minutes.”
Tony was speechless, mouth opening and closing from the lack of words. He knew Steve didn’t want him spending time with Rhodey, but he didn’t think
“S-stop, stop,” he maneuvered his hips, trying to get away. “Your hand. Hurts.”
Tony understood that. He was figuring out the Avengers’ characteristics slowly, but they were still sights to see, especially when the entire pack joined in. Any teasing he was a part of in the past usually consisted of maybe two or three pack mates. Rhodey and Pepper for example and even Jarvis and Vision. But here, with the Avengers, it was literally everyone, including Loki with his own sense of dry humor, that joined in the fun.
“Want us to search for wood to use?” Jan asked through growls.
Steve took a moment to process it, face slowly morphing to surprise and hope. “You
“Yeah,” Tony elongates the note. He was hoping his sarcasm was showing. “Almost as much as you did.”
Tony glared him down, flushed face and all.
The running steps that belonged to Steve grew louder and closer. He was right on his tail, Tony was positive of it. He gave another sharp turn and then another and another. He even jumped over a large stone in order to slow the alpha down, but Steve followed without hesitation and without any trouble. Tony cursed the alpha’s youth and strength and fit body. This was simply unfair.
Tony looked longingly at his plate when it was empty. He still had room for more but he knew not to get selfish when it came to food. Never take more than what you needed.
Tony did so, still concerned and now walking blindly as Steve dragged him around. A few steps forward and he heard additional footsteps that didn’t belong to him or Steve. Some from behind, which he figured were Bruce, Jan and Clint. Some in front that he guessed were the rest of their packmates.
Relief was a feeling he didn’t often associate with his heats before. If Steve was still interested then perhaps his scent truly was on the positive side, as Rhodey and Jarvis tried to convince him. That helped settle his nerves.
Quickly crawling back on his SHIELD issued bed he willed himself to sleep on the spot, managing to stay conscious with his eyes closed for only fifteen minutes before falling asleep and waking up again to loud knocking on his door.
was hidden under those rags of yours.”
Steve matched her gaze, not backing out until he jerked his head towards Tony. “Because. Tony.”
The alpha truly believed his own words. Steve wasn’t just saying it for the sake of trying to encourage him. Steve absolutely believed Tony was going to create those amazing things that could only be dreamed of. The pleasure that came from having his alpha have so much faith in him… Tony preened from the attention.
He sunk excruciatingly slow, stopping every time the pain flared up with every beat of his heart. He wasn’t even halfway there yet. His fingers still felt a decent amount of space between himself and Steve and as he continued he could feel the girth of Steve’s dick forcing his walls to expand in a way that was never required for Hammer. Tony closed his eyes and pressed on. As the seconds ticked on he grew desperate. He wanted to sink down fully and start adjusting for the length and size and lessen the pain. And he wanted to give the pleasure Steve deserved, but he hesitated.
It had turned out Thor’s mother was a highly requested and very sought-after midwife. She had years of experience and secret remedies she herself only knew. She had designed spells that catered to the wellbeing of the carrier and the babe. Her talent and recommendation spanned the lands where Thor’s family resided. She was given the name The Goddess of Fertility for the high rate of successful births under her watch.
The sad part about the whole thing? Had Steve not shifted to reveal himself to be the same alpha he had run into, Tony would’ve said yes. He would’ve fallen head first and done exactly what the Avengers had wanted him to do, say yes and watch it get thrown right back at his face. After spending the day and seeing
“Maybe you were, but not anymore.” Steve moved to get up, making Tony sit on the bed and grow cold from the lack of contact.
“If you never desired your old mate or their heirs, the magic resting in your core manipulated your body to prevent conception by their hand. Your malnourishment also contributed. You believed yourself barren because you and your environment made your body barren.”
Sam nodded and shrugged. “Fair enough.”
” Tony almost shrieked.
“Tony,” Steve interrupted, sounding strained and blocked Tony from looking at the naked shifters. Tony blinked and directed his gaze to Steve’s shining blue eyes. “Do you want to go swim with me - I mean, us - uh, the pack! Do you want to swim with the pack?”
The blush stayed in place as Tony was left stuttering at that. “That’s not - no, he’s - that doesn’t mean -” he managed before giving up and covering half his face with his hand. Bruce patted his shoulder in sympathy.
Tony stared at the letter for the longest time. So much so he ends up late for dinner and Loki had to come up to his little office to check on him. Loki found him still fixated on the letter. Hadn’t budged an inch.
“Aye, congratulations are in order for this most joyous occasion,” Thor said as he lifted one hand holding a bone in the air to mimic a toast.
“I see the truth?” Tony kept his head and ears low. At this point his control over his words was nonexistent.
The rude kid and his buddies were about to retaliate when a stern voice called out a name “Will!” and had the bully kids going pale. A fierce looking woman marched right up to them, smelling all kinds of angered beta. “How dare you pick an unfair fight with this child and then have the insolence to disrespect this person like that! You know better than this. Who taught you such manners? Why, when your mother hears about this she will give you a stern talking to and I will not stop her from grounding you for months. The same goes for the rest of you. Your parents will be told about this! To think you three insulted this man and teamed up against Sara's -”
Tony was surprised, but he wasn’t as surprised as Bruce appeared as he stared dumbfounded at the prey. However, none of their reactions even came close to what each and every Avenger was expressing. All of them, including the expressionless Loki, were openly staring and gob smacked and had their mouths wide open (even the ones that had a mouth full of chewed fish,
"You won’t stay there forever. Your home is here in the north. A long ways away from him."
that was stronger. If Tony had his tools on him he could make it so the iron and hide almost blended perfectly. No arrow or spear could penetrate without a huge extortion of force.
“I won’t apologize for him. He’ll get his head out of the dirt and do it himself, but I
Ben quickly went inside when they reached the building, leaving Tony and May to distract Peter and keep the secret a little longer. Peter had no idea and he was going to be in for a big surprise.
“Steve!”
“And I’m sure if you sit down and speak about the issues as proper adults you will be able to find a solution together.” Jarvis held nothing back.
(See the end of the chapter for
With a grin, Tony returned his gaze to Steve and was taken back when he found the alpha looking dejected. Was he really that upset about Tony not joining in their swim? It wasn’t as if they needed him to have fun in the water. He was about to say so when Vision suddenly started releasing a string of noise and tried rolling out of Tony’s crossed legs. Tony unhooked his feet and put them to the side to allow the little machine to roll to freedom.
Bottom line of it was, every one of them brought in coin for the pack. Meanwhile here Tony was living off of in without giving anything in return. He couldn’t let it go on. He wasn’t a designer or an alchemist or a curse breaker, and small contracts and an omega didn’t exactly go together, but Tony had skill he could sell and an opportunity to start helping and even pay back. Hell, even Bruce was earning coin slowly, his doctor insight aiding and giving Hank a second opinion when identifying pains and illnesses. Tony was the only one not earning his keep and he had to do something about it soon. The guilt was impossible to ignore.
“The leader…” deep breath, “m-my
On the twenty-first of December, he saw Tony again and Steve had never been so happy.
Oh there was plenty on his mind. “Just overthinking. My mind trying to find faults.”
“Can we keep them, Steve?” Clint wagged his tail expectantly and grinned through Sam swatting him and hissing a “
The heavy weight of guilt he carried was suddenly lifted. He finally had work and possible revenue. He felt so
“Oh! Modesty. Yeah, there’s no modesty here. We lost all our modesty ages ago,” the beta said as a matter of fact with a grin to go with it.
The blonde now named Sharon composed herself. “Tha- that’s my name. That's me. You're his - I'm - It’s nice to meet you, Tony.” Her eyes said otherwise. They were glistening, but not out of joy.
“Look, Steve,” Tony started, trying his hardest to not stare at the blue of the alpha’s eyes but failing, “I’m honored, truly honored,”
Tony opened his eyes questioningly at the alpha and was met with Steve’s look of shock and horror. “What are you
Without the challenge present anymore Rhodey glanced back and forth from the two alphas and then to Tony in question. “
“Anything new happened?” Sam casually asked from his spot on the floor and staring at the ceiling.
Yes, yes of course. Steve was asking, letting Tony decide. He could decline or accept. It was his choice. And it was true. Not like he didn't already have Steve and all of his naked glory behind him. What's some water added to the mix?
“What?” Tony felt his voice go quiet. “Don't - you can't give up on me now, Brucie. Not when we're this close.”
Tony pulled back when his alpha tried blowing on his skin again. Laughter loud and strong. “
“While I shake in anticipated fear, Sir, I feel I should inform you the omega sitting before you has been attempting to gain your attention since arriving.”
And so their banter started. Tony had learned over time that when it came to Sam and Clint always expect them to suddenly go into a playful battle of wit. They get lost in their own world that sometimes it was near impossible to get them to stop, so it was better for them to continue uninterrupted and let them halt on their own. Besides, it was always fun to watch them and laughter was always a guarantee.
When Tony first held the egg he had panicked. He didn’t know the first thing about taking care of a helpless infant, didn’t plan on ever taking care of an infant, but taking care of an egg that later became a blind, pink, twitching body that required food? Tony shoved the box incubating the egg back at Rhodey, but his friend refused to take it. It was a gift and you don’t return gifts, Rhodey had said so. He had also said he believed in Tony and knew he would take care of the egg as if it was the most important thing in his life… and he had been right. Tony was reluctant, but he accepted the gift and he’d be damned if he didn’t at least
, going over all the possibilities in his head, but as soon as Steve appeared through the doors, looking worse for wear, Tony’s hesitation took hold and it sealed his mouth shut.
“Going to what?” There was no point in asking. Tony knew exactly what Bruce meant by his question, but he wasn’t ready to answer.
To hear this famous pack was in the shacks? No wonder all the betas and omegas were beside themselves trying to reach them. They either wanted to see the pack with their own eyes or they wanted to see if they could get a shot at being added as a pack member. To be part of the Avengers? It was a shifters wet dream.
“Damn rat with wings,” he heard Hammer mutter. “I should have crushed him a long time ago. Useless thing.”
There was a story there but Tony was too busy waiting for Bruce’s response to think further on why Natasha’s proposition was so shocking. They all got their answer when the omega shakily reached out and grabbed the offered food, head down as he tried to hide his face.
“Sir?”
He’s had years of practice. This was an easily achievable task, though nerve wracking, but knowing it was Steve he was doing this for… yes, he could do it. He just had to prepare for the familiar pain his body still remembered, and his body certainly remembered it well if the way his erection dipped down from slightly going soft from the expectation was anything to go by.
“It’s a gift. Just comes out.”
“I don’t need your logic. It has no place when I’m trying to put blame on you.”
A chill ran through his bones. What if his heat ended prematurely because…?
Staff meaning magical quality and magical quality meaning that Loki was capable of wielding and manipulating it. That was… that was big news for Tony. He wasn’t the only one with the magical quality. He wasn’t… wasn’t needed for his special skills. It was both good and bad. Good because he didn’t have to reveal any of it to the pack. They didn’t have to force him to. Bad because he literally had nothing to give to the pack now. The last chip he could’ve used in order to remain wasn’t needed. That aspect was covered and they didn’t require another magic wielder. He was useless. He had nothing to give to the pack.
Jan sighed. “I just want to see home again. Feels like a long time since we last saw it.”
Tony made a small noise. “Jarvis.”
The beta stopped and her smile looked to almost split her face in half. “It’s the Avengers! The pack is here and they’re recruiting!” She ran off without another word.
What an alpha is capable of underneath. Just waiting to be released. Unlocked, upon an alphas desperation and fear. Looking to take over when Steve is at his weakest.
The sight of Rhodey with a traveling bag by his feet in the common room was a shock. Even more so when Pepper and Happy joined him with their own. Tony was left dumbfounded when Rhodey had said it was time for them to hit the road. Jarvis and Vision resting by his own feet were no better. They made noises of sorrow.
“I'll play with them and you remember to feed them and give them baths?” Clint grinned.
Frankly, Tony thought it about time.
“I heard that, Bucky!”
of clean. Smelling of his alpha for days was endearing and it made Tony’s heart flip in many ways, but the knowledge of
“The dingoes went to search for wood. Steve went to get fruits and berries for our friend here,” Natasha answered.
Tony rushed to the trees just a distance away, jumping over the running water. He could obscure his scent and use the trees to have them running in circles should they chase him. He could keep them at bay until he was close enough to his pack to call for help, to have his howl echo and be heard.
They were wistful ideas and were supposed to remain as such. Tony wasn't actually supposed to get the sun and stars.
“All right - none of that. Not right now,” Steve said softly, calmly, taking control. “This is probably not the best time. We’re not exactly level-headed to talk about this. We need - we need to breathe. Take a second and just breathe.” Tony did so, willing his nerves to settle. “That’s right, breathe. We’ll - we’ll sit and talk about everything after your heat. Something we should’ve done a while ago, but… but for now, we need to decide on this. Your care comes first.”
He might be considered and allowed to stay if Steve saw more worth in him. That was all he could ask for.
“I don't -” Tony started, getting cut off by Bruce poking at his shoulder.
“Goodbye, Tony,” Steve said when he pulled back. “Take care of yourself.”
Except… when they eventually called it a night and returned back home with Rhodey, Pepper and Happy coming along Tony didn’t even get a chance to show them around without Steve hovering around him, growling softly each time Rhodey got close. Each growl made Tony hunch ever so slightly, both in fear of a fight breaking out and the knowledge that… his alpha growling at his best friend meant that his alpha didn’t want him talking or getting close to Rhodey. He got the message with Hammer always constantly telling him to drop every and all connection with his childhood friend. He knew what was going on.
Here comes the squad ready to save their pack! Get ready for the big guns.
Bruce wasn’t going to reveal everything, at least not then, perhaps in the future, or maybe never. All Tony knew was, even knowing the possible dangers Bruce posed with his friend, Tony still trusted him to remain by his side. Hell, even Jarvis was still using his shoulder occasionally, so Jarvis’ trust hadn’t wavered.
“Where is he?” The voice said again. “Where are you holding Tony?”
The family of Carters were natural-born leaders, apparently. Sharon was no exception, even if she was a beta. That alone would not stop her from taking over the mantel now and the Commandos held no qualms about the decision. The Avengers and Howling Commandos had split before Tony was able to witness the new leadership in play, but both Peggy and Steve were extremely confident about the change.
The python flicked its tongue out. “How rude. I remained here for your benefit and these are the gracious thanks I receive. I’ll have to have a talk with our fair captain.”
Tony had just a second to tighten his grip with all four legs around the large forearm of the Hulk as best as he could before they took off. Hulk running on three legs and using his left arm to hold him up. The wind blew against Tony’s fur in speeds no ordinary shifter could manage. His eyes were forced shut and his flews were flapping uncontrollably. He couldn’t see how much ground they were covering but he could hear the large leaps of the giant and the smaller of Steve and Hank somewhere behind. From the sound alone he knew they were covering metres in seconds.
Steve entered soon after, and even if Tony couldn’t see him standing behind, he could easily imagine what facial expressions the alpha was doing under their pack’s scrutiny.
A shorter man who appeared to be wearing a beret chimed in. “Had we known you were interested in older,
“I love you, too.”
Steve, for the most part, ignored the alpha trying to wake him up.
His fingers twitched, wanting to grab that shield and get to work. No, not even grab that shield. He could make a better one. Larger, with near perfect ratio, and balanced.
“No question.”
The betas and omegas shifted nervously at that. Similarly to the ones living in the other shacks they had sensed something about Bruce and did what they could to avoid him. They were probably internally fighting with themselves on what to do. They wanted to see the Avengers but they didn’t want to come close to Bruce.
Sleep heavy in his eyes the last thing on his mind was getting up and walking, but he knew he desperately needed a wash. He tried wiggling to the edge of the bed, but found two problems stopping him. One, he couldn’t feel his legs. The muscles were sore and refused to listen. Two, the smallest of movements prompted the seed he still had in him to leak out, dirtying both the bed and himself more. Two things that were enough reason for him not to move, so he didn’t.
“Were so.”
“When I heard Jarvis and Vision screeching I thought the worse. I was so scared for you when I saw those bastard shifters on you. All I could see was red.”
Realization dawned. “You were making sure,” Bruce said.
“We’re not cruel, Tony,” Steve continued, growing fond. “We’d never pretend to like you in order to play some cruel prank. Heck, once we got over our initial shock of you appearing out of nowhere we didn’t give it much thought afterwards. We were too focused on finding you. Or, well, I was.” A blush appeared on the pale skin. “When I saw you I wasn’t exactly sure, but I had this feeling that I needed to find you again to see. It’s hard to explain, but please know that me asking you to join the Avengers is genuine. We’d really like to include you.”
One part of that statement caught his attention. Steve wasn't upset anymore, not with him. He was possibly upset about something or someone else, but he wasn't upset
“He will not be a burden,” she countered. Many were skeptical, but she remained firm. “Trust me. If we end up biting more than we can chew we’ll be glad to have him along.”
“I would.”
Tony frowned in confusion. Lost time? What was she talking about? He looked to Bruce as if he somehow had the answer to it even though he knew logically he couldn’t. Similar to him the omega was frowning as well, looking at
“It’s a surprise. Close your eyes. Trust me.”
Tony paced again, making his clothing swing with his movement. While the words might have given him a bit of a shock, it didn’t keep him distracted for long. The day’s planned journey swirling in his head and all the possible outcomes kept his mind busy. Something that was an annoyance for the cockatoo and little machine as they were bombarded by the same question from him over and over again.
This was his future. Tony needed to stop it. Escape before it was too late.
“You’d be surprised how his joining actually went,” Jan said. “It’s almost straight out of a novel. Events only someone could write.”
“Don’t mistake his reaction for what he thinks of you,” Jan continued. “Please.”
“You sure? I’m telling you they’re really something. Not even Bucky can figure out how they make them or get something close to it.”
“Not even the half of it,” Steve said solemnly. “Let the others know we’ll be needing our clothes soon. Maybe send them over? I think we’re just about done here.” With a nod, the two birds flew off towards the direction the inn was presumed to be.
admirer. Yes, he had also admired the Avenger long before he personally met them and mated with one, but the Avengers were fairly new in comparison to the legends before him. The Howling Commandos have been active longer, had grown their name in the fastest movement ever witnessed and their story of banding together was the stuff of legends.
The noises of footsteps right behind them didn't give the two omegas much of a choice. Tony canceled out any noise except for the steps that seemed to be booming behind them and breathed in and breathed out, forcing himself to calm. The sight of boots appearing from under the bushes had both omegas acting. Bruce swung wildly while Tony tried his hardest to aim for the head of the closest to him. One smack had two Hydra members crying in pain, one of them dropping their weapon. Another smack on Tony’s goon had the shifter falling flat on the ground. Bruce’s goon required more swings before finally going down. Vision rolled on them for good measure, beeping defiantly. A few steps away were the three remaining Hydra shifters already on the ground with an arrow through their chests, courtesy of Clint on the tree.
Tony woke up on his side to the smell of grass dew and Bruce and a small dose of Jarvis. Opening one eye and with a blurry view he spotted the pack scattered around the area while still being considered close by to each other. Tony and Bruce and distance away from them.
Tony cleared his throat nervously. Hank didn’t appear mad, but Tony still felt the same as a child aware of having done something bad and terrified of the scolding he was to receive. “Yes.”
Steve kissed him. Soft and gentle. When he pulled back the smile from before returned. His eyes shining with joy. “I told you I’d make you my omega.”
The warm feeling of having a cockatoo wrap around the front of his neck soothed Tony to sleep. The next time he woke up it was to someone shaking his shoulder softly. When he refused to stir the shaking increased to the point that his entire top half was being rolled over.
“Tony get up.”
“Honey, that’s
His alpha agreed. “Good idea. Let’s get going. The faster we get there the sooner we’ll eat.”
He stays in this state for hours with only his mind to entertain himself and the sounds of footsteps and metal clinking to keep him company.
piece of ass you are, though.”
It was a relief to know, should he ever need a moment of privacy without Jarvis and Vision, he had Bruce and even Clint ready and eager to keep watch.
“You touch his rune all the time,” Bruce countered. “Only those gifted do that in order to make sure the rune is working properly.”
“Yes,” Jarvis confirmed. Not sugarcoating it at all.
Tony fought his hardest to keep the embarrassing blush from coloring his cheeks. Bruce, the hero Tony never knew he needed and was slowly becoming Tony’s love of his life, eased the burning eyes away from him by chuckling and bumping his shoulder against Tony’s. “Great, I thought I was the only one getting hungry here. Time for lunch?”
The feral animal on-screen drags Falcon to him, tearing at the wing trying to act as a shield. Steve covers his mouth as Falcon screams for him to stop. Everyone does. The Agents. Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, War Machine and Winter. They scream Falcon’s name. Falcon screams Steve’s name as he’s unable to lift his arms up to defend his neck, pinned against the ground and the broken wing. Steve watches himself open his jaws, ready to bite and tear at Falcon.
With Tony’s pup as leverage, there was nothing Hammer wouldn’t be able to make Tony do.
Bruce didn’t put up a fight when it came to leaving the shack and traveling with them but he became hesitant when Tony mentioned wanting to head for a northern shack near a city. For one reason or another Bruce didn’t want to get close to populated areas and Tony was willing to bet it was because of his shifted form. At first Tony believed one of the reasons behind it was the possibility of the other omega not being

“Never thought a famous war pack would invite you to join?”
? Mind looking into that?”
it around. To have it mentioned by someone other than himself or Steve felt a bit invasive.
He remembers waking up to his mate’s voice. To Tony telling him, “it’s okay. Steve, Honey. Come back to me.”
“I should go back out there and see how they’re doing,” Steve said eventually. “If they’re even still out there. How long were we here for?”
Then, as if realizing the dire situation, Jarvis began to screech. Warning anyone within hearing distance. Calling the Avengers for help.
“Do you have a habit of always apologizing? It’s quite annoying.”
That shield probably had the longest lifespan of all of Steve’s shields. However, Tony didn’t stop with just reshaping the shield to its original state. He made adjustments when and where he could. After studying Steve’s style of fighting, he went and manipulated the angles to enhance the add more strength to his alpha’s blocks and throws. This led to the shield becoming rounder, and in turn sturdier for Steve’s handling. Eventually, the shield wasn’t shaped for protection and instead was meant for an offensive take.
Tony stared the hydra down, an action that amused it, “What does it mean? Why does the dragon need to choose a new body? And why us?”
Tony frowned at the sky, hoping against odds that Jarvis somehow saw the glare was meant for him.
Bruce’s eyes were wide as he nodded. “Right, right, big guy. Bring out the big guy.” He shut his eyes and scrunched his face, ready to force him out, and right as it appeared as if the Hulk was about to come out and play Clint crouched down next to them, successfully distracting and stopping Bruce from the shock.
Jarvis looked insulted and puffed up his feathers. Tony chuckled at the display and ran a finger softly over the white plumage of the bird’s back. “I ask that you refrain from insulting my intellect, seeing as both you and I share the same capability. I wouldn’t wish of you to speak ill of yourself.”
“Probably not, but how will I play nice with the other kids if I don’t at least try and talk to them?”
against him.
Odin conceded defeat and pushed the matter no more, but he left his sons with a warning. Should the workshop fail because of the Midgardian child, Anthony was to be removed and forgotten. No exceptions.
“You and me both,” Tony twitched his toes experimentally. Walking for hours with boots on and trying to keep up with the pack was a tiresome combination. How had they even managed? “I think I threw my back.”
“We might not have thought this through,” Steve mumbled against his neck. He could feel the alpha smiling at their unfortunate situation.
Bucky sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We’re about to fight Hydra packs tomorrow and somehow you two are finding the time to bump uglies together? Please tell me you got each other out of your systems for now.”
They roll out of his way, just as Steve’s memories depicted, but this causes his heart to speed up for what happens next is what he fears the most to see. Steve on screen continues down to his next target. To Falcon, who isn’t quick enough to fly up like Thor. His gear takes a second too long to lift him up and that’s all Steve needed to grab hold of him.
Though the mortification hadn’t lessened, uncertainty was added in his thoughts. “I am barren. I haven’t been able to… carry. No matter the numerous attempts.”
“None can escape the mighty Thor!” The feline said before jumping inches in the air by the sudden fall of a black python from the tree branches that landed on his back and made the feline dash to the trees like a frighten kitten.
. He couldn’t be. He had just said it so he couldn’t be.
He was with child. He was in the grasp of Hammer and Stane. Steve and their pack had still not found them. Tony was in very real danger.
Jarvis flew from Bruce’s shoulder to Tony’s, releasing a whistle and giving him a stern look. A look that seemed fitting on a parent ready to scold their child.
“Not really, no. To be honest, if someone asked me that back when I was still with my old pack I would’ve thought them delusional for even thinking it. Me with a war pack? I can barely handle a sword.”
Fear seeped out of him. Pepper smelled it and inched closer to try and protect him. She was braver than he. So much braver. If only she wasn’t there. If only she was safe in their home and with their pack and not obligated to be brave for Tony’s sake.
Hank eyebrows furrowed. “You both took the contraception I gave?”
“Aye, I find myself curious at your affairs,” Thor said with a grin.
The sight of the carriage got the pack rushing forward. As if reaching it would shield them away from the Avengers. Stop the famous pack from discovering Hammer and his own were running off with two of theirs.
“Trust me, he will kill me in cold blood, in front of the others. They will all smile and hold no regrets for it.”
Tony growled from deep within his chest. “The last thing I care about is
the Avengers territory. Such a thing should have been impossible. The chance of it slim to none. Hammer and Stane should not have been this lucky. No one was.
“Again? Haven’t you worked on it enough?”
Happy Valentine's day!
“I did,” Tony reassured. “I love creating and handling steel. I could spend hours just working on it.”
As far as Tony was concerned it rang true for most of his life. Hammer never talked about the possibility of switching. Never considered it. The alpha would have scoffed at the very idea and Stane would have helped to reinforce that belief.
Tony was unable to say anything back to try and lessen the sting when the one kid the three were going up against knocked the one that insulted Tony down, shouting “Don’t talk to him like that!”
“Hopefully not literally. It’s barely the first day.”
Tony hid his face against Steve’s chest. “I’d really like a bath.”
It was a sign. After the whole mental struggle of trying to figure out whether to join or not destiny decided it wanted a say in it and made it so they couldn’t join, by arriving late. Who was he kidding. He wasn’t meant to start a new life with the Avengers pack and he definitely wasn’t meant to be courted by Steve and have him, heaven forbid, as a mate.
“The closest town is miles away from here,” Sam informed. Redwing, perched on his shoulder, seemed to nod along with this statement.
Tony decided on the middle spot of the empty space, sitting cross-legged. Jarvis, who had been nesting on his shoulder the entire time, spread his wings in order to balance himself as Tony leaned down before settling again and continued nesting. Vision rolled and bumped against his thigh, beeping out a request that the Avengers all curiously looked at him for.
“We’ll wait for them outside,” Sam steered them towards the door. “They have everything set up and are just getting their stuff for the walk. At least I think they are. Otherwise we’ll just head on without them.”
“The prey is heading north, Sir. Hurry.”
“Everyone look alive. Home is within sight,” Natasha interrupted his train of thought, successfully distracting Jan and the rest of the pack. Tony breathed in relief, tension melting away, but then Natasha looked at him and Bruce directly and a chill ran down his spine. Tony must have been seeing things because the glint in the red-headed alpha’s eye couldn’t be mistaken for anything else but awareness. It was a knowing glint.
“I wanted to wait,” the other omega shrugged. “Didn’t mind it. Come on, I think breakfast is done cooking and they’re about to eat.”
He counted his blessings that the alpha leader didn’t consider him a threat and attacked him or sent his pack after him. There had been many occasions where traveling packs had attacked anyone who ran into them. Walking up to a pack showed no ill intent, but running was considered a hostility, a form to strike swiftly against the pack and catching them off-guard.
“That way?” Tony confirmed, pointing at the direction.
In the two months on the road, they had acquired and finished contracts after contracts. One coming after another. The reason why their travels had extended to so many weeks.
Deeming Midgardian education subpar, Tony was homeschooled. The technology of Asgard was his new toy and every day he would play, learning the workings and the magic. Impressing his uncles. Impressing even Odin after the man came to visit once upon hearing the word of a Midgardian residing in his old workshop.
“Not you, too, Brucie,” Tony pouted, groaning when Vision released a series of beeps. He turned and started walking towards the shacks in a huff, keeping in mind how easy it would be to loosen his grip on the little roly poly. Maybe that’ll teach him for pretending to be asleep.

at him. Tony felt his face lit up at having been caught and turned away, shortly after hearing Steve release a... whine? Steve appeared distraught and was apparently sending Clint a mix of facial expressions that had Clint lifting his hands up in peace, but he was still grinning.
The Hulk listened in an unimpressed manner before speaking to Tony. “Kitty talk funny.”
The alpha appeared to be left speechless. “I - do you really?” Then his tail began wagging uncontrollably. “Sweetheart, I'd love nothing more than to. If that's what you want.”
Bucky understood what he meant. “He is, but he wasn’t always. What you see now? It happened shortly after his teen years ended. He grew up on a short side of everything and hardly had any meat on his bones. To many it wasn’t exactly attractive, but once he gained his muscles and his height he suddenly had wolves of all orientations throwing themselves at him. These days he doesn’t know if anyone likes him for his body or for himself. That’s what he’s insecure about.”
The head pulled back and came barreling forward like a missile aiming for land.
“I don’t.”
The Hulk roared and took off before anyone could say or agree to anything. Not wanting to be left behind Thor ran off after him, along with Clint and Natasha. In an unspoken agreement, everyone else decided to let them handle it. With Hulk by their side they would without a doubt bring back more game than they knew what to do with. That left them to pick up their gear and wait patiently until their two guiding birds gave them the signal to get moving. Tony was content to rest against his alpha. Enjoying the contact and the safety.
“- but you and I both know that his current favorite is Tony over there. Can’t argue your way out of this one.”
He jumped when he heard the sound of steps coming down the stairs. Four of Hammer’s betas made their way over. In their arms were the materials their alpha leader had promised. Piles of steel and metal and a dozen, inexpensive gauntlets. One beta carried the tools. The two betas furthest back were dragging stone and wood.
His shoulders hunched when he felt something flick over his hind leg. It was impossible for it to have been Steve and the Hulk was too busy staring at their surroundings to have done it. That left Hank as the culprit and he felt his stomach drop. Was this it? Was Hank going to start his lecture of what he had done wrong?
“Were you to hold it in instead? Ah, surely that is it. You are to simply stand there and allow others to speak over you with no consequence. You are a carpet meant for others to walk on and nothing more.”
Tony would let him. Great deity of the sky he would let Steve do whatever he wanted if it meant having him.

Sam sat up to get a view of Steve and Tony. “Ignoring Loki insulting us, I’ve been hearing the folks in Hattan spread Iron Man around. Everyone is calling you that over there. Don’t know how it started or who even made up the name, but I’m betting they got the idea thanks to your smithing skills. Working with iron probably did it.”
Steve ended up taking him further down the hall, pass the rooms and down a hidden set of stairs that led to a bathing room that had a stony floor with a drain and a wooden boxed-tub at the corner already filled with warm water.

you.”
“Cart’s ready over there,” Hank pointed at the simple, flat and shining wooden cart with four wheels, walls blocking in all the sides except for the front and two handles that lacked the mount meant to pull it, slanting slightly.
Tony couldn’t even panic at the knowledge because she blinked once, showed the slightest upward curve of her lips and looked away. Confused, Tony turned to Bruce for an answer, but even Bruce didn’t know what had just occurred. Either way, they weren’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth and trotted forward to keep up with the pack that suddenly picked up the pace at the sight of ‘home.’
A tingling sensation traveled down his spine. Steve had enjoyed it and a type of satisfaction ran through his veins from hearing the alpha say that. “I did, too,” despite the shaky beginning they had.
“Bruce, please...”
would never. Their pack would never. They hadn’t spent so long helping him heal only to throw him out as if he were old rubbish. They hadn’t wasted their time showing him love only to take it back with an excruciating hand, leaving him alone to bleed from reopened wounds and suffer in anguish from mind, body and soul.
Tony had long ago learned that physical contact could give pain that lasted hours or even days, but words left emotional scars that never healed for years and cut deep into his heart for him to always remember. Loki’s words, while meant for a different reason, hurt just as much as Hammer’s.
Her gaze lowered, taking in his appearance. Having recently gone through a heat with his mate he knew he didn’t create an impressive sight. A loose shirt, boots and unsightly pants that had survived a trip under armor. Not to mention his hair was probably disheveled and he reeked from his sweaty and heated activities.
All through it, the only question running in Tony’s mind was '
Tony couldn’t have stopped the blush that attacked his face in full force even if he tried to. The reasoning that maybe all this attention he was receiving was part of an elaborated prank returned in his head, but Tony was so starved for this that at that moment he didn’t care. He wanted to experience this for however long the prank would take, consequences be damned.
“Oh, good.”
Steve, through his blush, gazed at him tenderly. “We’re happy to have you both. Welcome.”
“Any time. I am happy to assist.”
Just as a side note. I usually give status updates about the new chapters on this fic over at my Tumblr so if you don't like being left in the dark for so long go give it a see. I've been giving a lot of sneak peeks lately!
And while Bruce made his statement sound like a joke to the rest, Tony knew it was his way of saying ‘don’t worry’ without the others knowing.
A moment of pause before Tony tightened his arm around Steve’s neck and shoulder, cuddling him closer. The alpha released a happy whine and snuggled his head over Tony’s lap, tail wagging faster than ever before. He gave Vision a lick when the little machine rolled curiously closer to him, earning a high pitched pleased sound.
They were never to take him out on a contract again, not after running away upon the situation growing tense, and now after they've seen how he handled his panic that had been induced by his heat? It would be a miracle if they allowed him to stay even to watch over the den. The possibility of him burning down their home upon the moment his emotions get the best of him a real reason for concern.
“Careful,” Rhodey growled, though good naturedly, and pointed at Steve. “You may be his mate and my pack leader but don’t think for one second I won’t hesitate to neuter you.”
The embarrassment was back. “I’m sorry.”
“Did I - did I say something wrong?” Tony shifted his gaze to all of them, shuffling a little awkwardly. He was grateful when he felt Jarvis and Bruce give him a peck on the cheek and a pat on the shoulder for support.
Fear dug into him. He grabbed the alpha’s boot pleadingly. “I will. I will, please -”
Tony gripped his arm. “It was planned, Steve. They had the time and the money to strike in the last place any of us expected. You can’t blame yourself for that.”
“I know your scent. I can recognize it anywhere and I know when it’s different. Maybe you or the others can’t pick it up, but this is new. I know it’s new, and it’s strong and it’s warm and I can’t get enough of it.”
him. He knew they wouldn’t, though. Not when more than half of them had mates and the very idea of any of them disrespecting each other and Steve in such a manner was hard to fathom. But… what if?
,” Tony stressed when Steve looked skeptical. “It wasn’t their fault. It was all me. I panicked when Thor -” Steve’s eyes darkened, “No! No, no, not like that. I panicked because I’m not… I’m not… I didn’t know how to handle it…” Now that he said it Tony had to admit it sounded pathetic. “I know I was supposed to wait my turn and I tried to leave, I
For his boy, how could he ever say no?
“Oh, he’s enjoying it. That’s for sure,” Clint chirped, returning to his task of grooming Sam when the beta whined and pawed blindly at him.
Tony’s life really was a joke.
He wanted to be looked at just like that alpha child once looked at him, with adoration. He couldn’t think about that, he shouldn’t. It was a
He was unable to stop the laugh that burst out of him, and if there was a tear or two he blamed them entirely on the Avengers for making him chuckle too hard.
“You did ask for my opinion.”
Tony took a deep breath. “That bad?”
Further south Tony was taken. His sight was obscured from fatigue. Nothing but blurry trunks and leaves filled his path. He had long lost an idea of their location.
Rolls? No… is it possible? “May Parker?”
All of you have a great day!
“Well,” the alpha started while he was in the middle of his turmoil, “obviously you’re worried about something, so I’m going to get back to work. If you come to a decision let me know because the work is yours if you want it.”
It was then that Steve realized he was hovering over Tony. He jumped back, almost tripping himself, and looked apologetically at Tony. “I’m sorry. I didn’t realize how late it had gotten.”
“I’m not
A beta or omega arriving and in search for a shack could enter theirs to check if it’s free. And even though their scents were recent and enough to ward off others it would only take seconds to scan the shack and find a bag on the corner and a curious or desperate person to snatch it up and disappear with the contents hidden inside. Tony promised himself no one was ever going to get their hands on those gauntlets.
Tony went quiet, eyes kept downcast. He didn’t dare say the name, feeling as if the mere mention would make the man appear and bring back the nightmares.
This was why Hammer was so tolerant. He needed Tony. The alpha knew without Tony he would lose the golden egg he had. It wasn’t out of kindness. It was an investment.
Over and over. Was this another of Hammer’s cruel words? To bring him lower. To have another hold over him?
Before anyone could volunteer to escort him to the town, Hulk took one massive step forward, taking one of the spots. “I go with Puny Runt.”
So... yeah. Sorry I kept you waiting after that cliffhanger! Hope you enjoy!
Somehow, Tony doubted they would. This kind of disobedience? It was one they both will remember until the end of their days and they won’t
had done to them. For almost taking the little happiness in Bucky’s life, and almost ending Sam’s.
“Got you both,” Clint said and lifted his head up to howl his claim, letting the rest of their pack know he managed to get another under his paws.
“Sir, they are not following.”
That still didn't stop Prior from going into a bit of a mini rage, all anger and frustration and the need for a fight without the loss of control. Tony didn't know if that last part made it better or worse.
“I don't share.”
Thor pulled away after only a short, worryingly short, moment, but he was smiling. A good sign, Tony hoped.
Before Tony could come up with a witty response Steve let out a growl from the front of the lineup without looking back. It was clear the alpha didn’t enjoy the idea.
It confused Tony. Found him? Were they referring to him? Had they met before the shacks? Now that he thought back to it, hadn’t the others talked about him in a similar manner? As if Steve had known him beforehand, but Tony was none the wiser of Steve. Sure, Tony knew of the famous Captain. Anyone with the skills to pick up a paper and were capable of reading knew of the Captain, but Tony hadn’t personally met the
Were the Avengers held back? Were they attacked and had sustained injuries that prevented them from following the carriage at a reasonable speed? Had they lost track or simply had never even found the carriage to begin with?
Deflated, Tony shook his head. “Sorry for disturbing you. I’ll be on my way.”
Vision beeped and made himself known by shaking the bag in determination, wanting to get down and explore their new room.
Tony kept his eyes shut and waited, focusing on sounds of movement and Steve’s scent. He prepared himself for anything. For Steve expressing his frustration, for Steve to lash out in any form, for Steve to demand something, anything, to make up for angering him. Then Steve moved and Tony hunched himself, only to go absolutely still when he felt arms wrap around his shoulders in a gentle but very firm hold. The smell of sharp and bitter anger disappeared and a whine rang next to his ear. Tony was unable to stop the squeak that escaped him from the surprise of Steve hugging him, and he also had no control over his body as it relaxed when a new scent reached his nose. The smell was almost honed on the center of the spectrum of scents themselves. It was no longer sharp but it still had a harsh edge to it along with a calming layer.
“Damn snarky bird,” Tony muttered as the shifters around them began chuckling. Steve's body heat a constant reminder on his lap and side.
Steve began pecking the soft part of his neck, licking and nipping and making Tony feel like putty. The mind numbing sensation going through his body making him momentarily lose mobility. His head fell heavily on Steve’s shoulder in an angle that gave the alpha more access to his neck, which Steve happily took advantage of. He latched on, barely scraped the surface of his skin with his teeth before pinching with his lips and sucking. Tony whined loudly from that. The ecstasy from getting partially marked nearly sending him to the edge. It wasn’t a complete claim, not without the correct spot (where an already existing and old scar rested) and not without the teeth leaving behind a fresh, crescent scar, but it was a small promise to the real thing and it left Tony wanting more.
Fate would surely land him on the second one and laugh while doing so. Life was just that cruel.
“I - I would, happily would, but I don’t have anything on me to cut. It’s in my bag.”
“It matters not your origin,” Thor said, “only your acts, and you have proven yourself to be a noble warrior and ally. Had it not been for your strength I fear many of us would have found ourselves by Death’s door. We thank you for your hand and I am honored to name you friend.”
Tiny seven-year-old Tony wrote a letter to have a friend for Yule. It was all he wanted. A true friend. One his father just couldn’t buy for him. A friend that wanted to play just to play and not for money.
Everyone who showed emotions began laughing at Tony's flabbergasted expression and only stopped when Steve growled in warning. A few of them still snickered but they quickly regained their composure and continued their travels in a more sedated state.
“You never responded,” Rhodey revealed, his voice going uncharacteristically low with sorrow. “My letters. I sent you letters months ago. I sent a lot of them knowing they might disappear -”
“Those changes held more truth than everyone thought, and the comics were more than make-believe.” Fury and Peggy moved to the side, revealing what stood in the center of the dome.
. Tony remembered first hearing about the famous pack. They were responsible for pushing back the infamous Hydra packs that were causing problems all around, and the alpha in charge? He was famous in his own right, having led the war pack, the Howling Commandos, to many victories and now leading the Avengers.
“We’ll eat the moment we’re out. Promise. I have to make sure my omega is well cared for here. I don’t want Jarvis mad at me for doing a poor job.” Steve pulled Tony down to the edge of the bed. He maneuvered Tony’s legs to give himself room and kneeled on the ground to slot himself between them.
Steve paused his grooming for a moment. “I’ll escort him there. Two of you come with us to make sure no one gets tempted to make a move. The rest of you scout the area and finish up here.”
some enemies and letting us tag along for the ride?”
from having Steve fucking Rogers
They managed to hear a squawk right before the massive bird that was Jarvis landed on Tony's head. The combined strength from the momentum he appeared at and the weight forced Tony down and snap his head against Rhodey's neck. The two of them groaned from the impact while the cockatoo stood tall and proud, like a king on his throne.
Clint was also on his two feet and was in the middle of getting rid of his armor. Armor, Tony noticed now that he was studying it, that didn’t look light and probably wasn’t meant for simple traveling. It was heavy and designed to take blows straight on, unlike the expected quick tussle that occurred from raiders attacking in the middle of the road. Which could only mean the Avengers were either heading for a fight against a strong pack or they were returning from just having a fight against a strong pack.
omegas? That seemed about right, if a harsh truth. He couldn't argue his age when compared to Steve.
He immediately brightened when he heard, “Steve, over here!”
Pack contract? What pack contract? He didn’t recall a contract or ever heard about a recent contract that involved the entire pack. Considering he was part of said pack he should have heard about it… but hadn’t… and he didn’t like that.
The crowd was still around them. He could hear their chattering but he couldn’t recognize the words. The only thing he was focused on was Steve and his shining, optimistic eyes that were looking at him like he was a… a.. a treasure.
“You know being able to work with runes is a rare and valuable gift, right? A war pack like the Avengers would benefit greatly from it.”
“Sharing is caring, Cap,” Clint retorted.
“Be calm, my friend. Your beloved has been watched for, but you mustn’t enter in your distressed state. You shall cause more harm than good. Come, let us -” Thor’s voice faded away as steps were taken to signal their departure.
“I claim this in the name of Clint!” Clint said and ran off to sit on one spot that was shadowed and gave the perfect view of the area. He dropped the pack that he carried with him to mark it off.
He would have remained on the bed if not for a stubborn cockatoo who was adamant on getting him up and going and a roly-poly machine who wanted to get the day started.
Tony made a high noise in the back of his throat as his toes were dragged over the surface of the floor, barely making contact. The urge to kick wildly in an attempt to gain some ground itched in his legs, but he held back. No good would come from accidentally hitting the alpha feline, or even Vision, who was rolling really close to his legs after them.
Anyways, hope you enjoyed this chapter.
you wake up?”
He looked to Bruce, his last backup, with pleading eyes that he’d hope the other omega would understand. If Bruce said no than they’d have a reason to leave and prevent any confrontation of sorts. It was only Tony’s luck that Bruce decided to go for the complete opposite of what he wanted. Instead of getting the bashful “thank you, but I’d rather cook our meals over at the shacks if it’s all the same to you,” Tony got Bruce nodding and shrugging absent-mindedly.
you’ll think you’re inconveniencing us for and I’m here to tell you-you're not. We needed somewhere to rest after this fight anyway.”
“It’s not a bad thing,” Jan assured. “It told us you weren’t using him. You were genuine, and now that Steve’s got you he’s terrified of losing you.”
A few more steps and Bruce got the courage to ask, “You all right?”
Tony looked away, unable to meet Steve’s eyes. The selfless alpha who had done so much for him. Devoted time and effort for an old omega who didn’t understand the precious jewel he had ran into on that fateful day in the old shacks.
Thor marched them over to the table, placing him down next to Jan and sitting himself next to Loki. Tony shuffled awkwardly on his seat. What was he to say? What was he to
. A word that revolved around his life. Why?
Off to the side of where Bruce was standing was Vision next to his feet and releasing a long sound to mimic their howls. Tony howled just for him, preening when Vision returned it. Then another howl joined them, one that sounded specifically just for him and made his heart beat just a little bit faster.
Steve turned an intriguing shade of red as Natasha shoved an elbow at the brunet alpha. The rest of the pack, minus Tony and Bruce and Loki, snorted. Some of the snorts soon turned to outright laughter when Clint muttered, “We’ll never hear the end of it once it happens.” Even Loki couldn’t hold in the smirk.
the sight. You are not the first,” Loki chuckled. “Many have gazed. Few have lived to describe the experience.”
“He says you're fine and he understands. He doesn't know how to talk about you either.”
“Except?”
Ignoring him, Hill continued, “Fury wants you both in this jet and on course an hour ago. Get a move on. Your pilot will take you to your destination that will take approximately 4 hours and 20 minutes. Once you get there Fury will tell you the rest.”
He angled his hips for every thrust Steve gave. Moaned at the sound of soaked skin slapping against soaked skin. Allowed tears to trail down his cheeks from so much at once and cried out when Steve bit hard on the muscle of his shoulder just as his hips became erratic and gave one final harsh thrust in. Tony’s vision grew dark and the last thing he felt and heard from his mate was the knot forming and Steve growling with his teeth still snapped shut on Tony’s shoulder.
“No more than you deserve, heathen.”
Being mocked aside Tony was thankful the alpha had woken up in such a great mood, compared to the mood he had gone to bed with. No doubt the worry was still present, and the fear, but the fact that Steve had mentioned the armor without much struggle showed he was accepting it instead of fighting against it.
“I’ll help in searching for some wood,” Bruce had said, moving to stand up.
“I haven’t even seen her yet,” which was true. Tony hadn’t seen a hoof or mane of her. Her family taking up responsibility for the planning of the festivities meant Pepper was now offering input on how to make it productive and safe for the volunteering centaurs.
Bruce stood over a batch of grass that was flatten, probably a spot one of the Avengers had been sleeping on. “I didn’t hear anything about the invitation expiring after one answer, and if that’s the case we’ll just explain it to them. I’m sure Steve will make an exception if it means having you join.”
The dirty blonde beta leaned against him, rubbing slightly. “This calls for a swim! There’s the river over there with our names on it and it's all for us.”
“We want to spend lazy mornings together.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I'd also like to give all of you readers a special shout out as well. I couldn't have done all this without ya! Thanks for motivating me with all your lovely comments.
A knock on the door signalled the arrival of someone and after Steve gave them permission to enter the door opened just a crack and in popped Clint’s head cautiously. The sight of a floating head with a frown was something to see. “We’re about to leave soon and you’re trying to get a quickie in? Wait, what’s our current record for fastest?”
He couldn’t respond, didn’t think it possible with how his throat nearly closed up from the emotions, so instead he squeezed Steve’s hand and intertwined their fingers when Steve started showing signs of retracting his hold. He nodded, hoping it was enough of an answer.
That he was a foolish omega who couldn’t handle the pressure when things began to spiral out of his control and his first instinct was to… hide.
Bruce was way above something so trivial. He had lived as a doctor helping those in need for a time. To even get offended at the idea of someone doing the reproductive tango was beneath him. He had more important things to do, like curing diseases, saving lives and changing the world.
Eventually, they finished reuniting with Peggy and all herded each other over to their table again. Clint and Sam proudly introduced her to their mate, Rhodey while Natasha did the same with Bruce. Bucky stood preening the entire time everyone focused on Peggy.
don’t finish that!”
His mind came nowhere near close to what had occurred.
Clint released a squeaky whine, “Noo, anything but that. Get this cat off of us! Someone, anyone, we could really use a rescue right about now.” He shouted to the trees.
The pure interest evident in Steve’s eyes made it impossible to think he was lying and actually could care less about what he’d say. Steve
“Yes, I am well aware, but this is not meant for you. Anthony, upon our first meeting your physical state had not been hard to miss. Many of the pit had treaded lightly around you, choosing to not poke at your insecurities.” Tony’s eyes grew wide. “Is it safe to say your physical state had been from malnourishment while living with your previous pit, as opposed to the canine shacks that some of our pit mates concluded?”
With that half of the Avengers’ pack disappeared into the trees. The others accepted their apparent stay and went to claim other tables to bring them together.
Tony snapped up straight, his back cracking from having slept on the hard ground in his two leg shape but he ignored it. “What time?”
The new faceless shadows that appear behaved differently this time. He remembers creating sounds at them, warning them not to get close. Growling. Showing his teeth. He remembers some listened. Most stayed far away. Against the walls. Others dared to come closer. Their voices low. He wouldn’t have that. He
“What do you want me to do?”
, those meant more than his past titles ever would.
had to hurt. “It’s not you, I swear. I’m just overwhelmed.” It was partially true. He was overwhelmed, frustrated,
Tony blinked and it all vanished. Steve was there again with the same toothy smile but no missing teeth. The round face was now sharp. Eyes smaller but just as blue and staring at Tony a little puzzled.
He reeled back and flinched a little. That was as much disrespect as Tony was going to get from a child and didn’t that just hit him deep. Receiving this treatment because of his second gender.
“Because you love me?”
Tony thought about it. He had to assume the beta Hank was speaking of was Jan, and if it were true that meant that Jan and Hank had shared a heat together, meaning the two betas had triggered one on their own accord and one main reason to do so was a pup.
Thor soon learned that Tony wasn’t an ordinary child. He had planned to gift Tony toys and spend hours playing with them, but Tony had a brilliant mind and an eye of curiosity. He was not satisfied with the meager things Thor had brought, and after seeing the fantastical creations Tony himself was capable of, Thor knew what to do.
Tony had gotten so used to not bothering with his fur that now, even without Hammer in his life, he still didn’t give a second thought to his fur nor had cared, not until he’d seen the fur of the Avengers. Looking at their fur was making him realize how lesser he felt. As if they being the famous war pack that had sent the betas and omegas in the shacks to trip over themselves wasn't enough now he had tone bodies and glossy furs to compared himself to. Hell, even Hulk’s fur had looked better than his own, and Bruce’s body was filled and his clothes fit perfectly against his frame. Something not even Tony had managed.
It was all well, though. He learned to survive with the little he received thanks to Jarvis and Vision. It was enough, just enough, for an omega like himself, and after living years in that manner he got used to it. His body and mind accepted the fact that he was only ever going to receive a limited amount of physical contact that didn’t involve breeding. He was thankful for it. The occasions he was desperate enough that he begged Hammer weren’t his greatest moments. The day his desire for contact simmered down to a manageable need was perhaps one of the greatest days in his years with Hammer. It gave him a sort of freedom. A control Hammer couldn’t get his hands on.
The dried meat was actually very tempting. So was Steve, if he were honest. “I could eat.”
“Everyone does.”
Surprisingly nothing eventful happened after that. Tony went back to munching on his rabbits while Steve’s warm hand over his own was a constant in the back of his mind. Bruce did the same and tried his hardest to not let himself be open for the Avengers to start a conversation with him without being outright rude about it. Still, since Natasha was sitting next to him she mentioned a word or two to him and he had no choice but to talk. The silver lining for him was that at least Natasha didn’t appear to be a big talker. His one-word responses appeared enough for her.
“No,” Sam said, eyes narrowing. “It’s not that. It’s - it’s - just give him a minute. It’s not what you think. I promise.” Then Sam started shaking the alpha.
“I am heartbroken by your disapproval.”
“Questioning my judgement?”
“What? My rifle is just fine, thank you. I’m not giving it up.”
Steve cleared his throat, taking the attention from Clint. “Are you doing anything for the rest of the day?”
He wanted to jump right on it.
Tony hunched his shoulders and pulled his head back. He could feel his tail going between his legs as a response to the fear he felt from running head first to an alpha without warning. Who knew what the alpha thought of his sudden appearance. He could interpret Tony jumping through the bushes as an attack, waiting until his defenses were down and then strike, and could possibly attack back as self-defense. Tony heard a growl from the side and found from the corner of his eye that the alpha wasn’t alone. There was a pack behind the alpha. Following. Meaning this alpha he just ran into was the pack leader and Tony was in so much trouble. He flattened his ears and lowered himself as close to the ground. Through his fear, he managed to count at least four pack members with plenty more further back, including the leader, and he really needed to make himself as small as possible and leave.
Tony whined softly and began to slowly and hesitantly take steps back. He avoided eye contact with any of them. All of them were on edge, bodies tense, and ready to act. The smallest of noise would probably set them off so Tony tried his damnedest not to make a single sound as his paws got closer and closer to the grassy ground. Any second now something had to give, but it wasn’t any of them.
Another flick of his tongue. “If you wish to see it that way. I care not. Now come. While I find joy in seeing others’ misery, when it comes to Rogers no one is left unscathed. I for one do not wish to travel for two days with his insufferable moping.” Loki released the branch and slid off to the ground, landing with a heavy thud and slithering away as if it was nothing.
The he cried in outrage when Natasha would say, “just like you.”
three? That makes me feel much better.”
Steve was sitting on the edge of his bed, head down on his crossed arms over his knees. He was sniffling, clearly crying, and it prompted Tony to move quickly. He kneeled in front of him and placed his hands on the alpha’s knees. “Steve…”
Then of course, because this was his life, his stomach decided to make itself known and growled in demand for food. And because Jarvis was sitting on his stomach he not only heard the full force of the noise, he also felt it and pecked back as retaliation. “It seems you’re hungry, Sir.”
“Not water baths, no,” his alpha walked over. “I was thinking more… tongue bath?”
. No one else. Not your godfather and not that sorry excuse of a mate you previously had.”
One by one they did until eventually Tony was free to roll on his belly and lie there.
“Could’ve been a family pack heading back home then.”
Tony’s gape moved over to Jarvis. “
“Our scent is still fresh. No one will try to claim it as their own, and even if they do we’ll just explain it to them.”
He couldn’t say the same for other fans. There wasn’t enough support and the chronicler, Frank Finlay, after the comics’ cancellation nearly 70 years ago, went underground and the chance to ever know how the adventure ended was an out-of-reach dream now.
Steve avoided the strike expertly by leaping to the side and then coming back. With help from the momentum, he jumped
“Tony?”
The confidence Tony had moments ago disappeared and if it wasn’t for Bruce holding his arm again Tony would’ve turned back to the safety of their shack.
The world shifted around him. Time was thrown back. Sharp and quick. The trees disappeared, replaced by buildings and stretches of unused dirt. Before him Steve was gone and in his place stood a little scrawny alpha. From a time long past. Large blue eyes with a round face and a spot of dirt on his cheek. Tattered clothing filled with holes. He was giving a toothy smile, lacking a tooth or two, and was staring at Tony with wonder. As if Tony held the world and its answers.
For himself, or for Steve?
Tony made a noise of mortification when Bucky, Clint and Sam moved their eyebrows very suggestively and Natasha said “I take it you both had a fun time together? You disappeared on us for nearly an entire day.”
Tony gaped at his pack, not believing they’d approve of such a thing. Natasha, Bucky, Rhodey, and Clint were quick to shake their heads and save their own hides, even shaking their hands to emphasize that, no,
“Rogers. Barnes,” Fury said when they reached them. “Glad you could make it.”
It was not until he walked out of his home and saw a lone kid playing with the snow surrounding their neighborhood that Steve found his gift. Steve had never seen this kid before. He was a complete stranger, and yet the kid walked up to him like a friend.
Hank groaned and twisted his body to lie on his back, paws up and belly exposed. Jan snorted at the display before placing her snout over the exposed underside of his jaw and gave a lick.
There was no mercy for him. Not when Steve reached the bottom and
Also, in case you're wondering how Vision looks like think of BB8 from Star Wars, except from an ancient era. Vision is a rollipolly machine made from scrap metal that can hide his head inside. If not BB8 than think of the evil robot from the Incredibles.
Tony’s heart chipped away a bit. What had he done to deserve Jarvis? “It matters to me.”
It terrifies Steve. Every night and every waking moment. It terrifies him. Living in fear of just when he’ll go feral again. The rampaging animal underneath his skin, wanting to be set free once more after finally having had a taste of freedom and the blood that came with it. The animal that sought violence and used its rage to achieve it.
Those titles meant nothing now, but Tony Stark, the Captain’s omega, the Avengers’ crafter,
Clint twitched his head upwards, causing Sam’s to slide off without a fight. It landed with a heavy ‘thump’ on the ground that had Tony wincing from just the sight of it, but Sam appeared unaffected and even rolled the upper half of his body to rest on his back, mimicking Hank.
Steve apparently decided to ignore him and continue napping.
“Some assistant you are.”
been done to him. Almost all of them not the most decent things. One of those being Hammer never willing to groom him. The alpha hated it. Despised having anything to do with showing any sort of affection. All Tony began craving for once he started living a life deprived from it.
Tony looked away from the exchange, focusing on his food again and snorting when Jarvis sneaked another berry from his plate. He made a barrier with his arm and shooed the cockatoo away when he made another move to snatch another berry.
“Hank, that last one isn’t useful in the slightest,” Jan said, patting his shoulder.
Tony Rogers.
and take care of it yourself.”
One person with the gauntlets was dangerous already, but an entire army carrying his creation? Tony had personally seen what he’d been capable of using the gauntlets to fight for the Avengers. One wrong person could cause a catastrophe. A never-ending war between the innocent and the corrupt.
He fully expected it to be Steve this time. Steve and his second and third in command, ready to tell him what he had done wrong, his punishment and how he’d no longer be allowed to join the pack for contracts or be trusted with their den. He had been surprised to see, not the golden wolf he expected, but the brown dingo that could only be Jan and the body of the black python that was Loki trotting and slithering their way over to them. So surprised, he lifted his head up to watch them curiously.
He sighed. “I know. I just got you all back. I don’t want to let go so soon.”
He got the feeling Bruce knew what he meant. Perhaps experiencing the same thoughts and self-doubts? Or perhaps he spent enough time with Tony and figured out how his mind worked? Either way it seemed Bruce wasn’t having any of it. “All right, but remember we’re surrounded. Blocked in on every corner,” and it was true. Both Tony and Bruce were smack in the center of the lineup. Steve was, naturally, leading the pack up front with Bucky and Natasha keeping close. Thor, Clint and Sam made the back. Loki (now back in his two legged shape) and Jan were right behind the two omegas and Hank was right in front. “Don’t think whatever it is you’re thinking about. There’s no escape.”
pack. And while Steve gave the go ahead Tony was also hesitant in making a suggestion, not wanting to push his friends on his pack and receive a negative reaction.
As long as Steve always asked him to stay, Tony would be fine. It was being asked by Steve to
“See you, Tones. Catch up after?”
to know and wanted to hear about the past that wasn’t tainted by Hammer. The part of his past that had actual happiness but was hidden away through layers of pain and fear and humiliation. How could Steve manage to so easily?
apologizing for myself. For what happened.”
“No Mercy.”
“It is. Don’t be mistaken. A bath doesn’t require much thinking. Working on your shield does.”
“You already do.”
All around him movement started to happen. Those who had been asleep prior were starting to slowly rouse and stretch. Thor being the one to stretch out and push some of the closest pack-mates over. Loki ended up sliding off of him from the movement and hissed in annoyance.
“But you didn't, and that's what counts.”
Steve and Bucky exchanged questioning looks but Hill didn’t say anything else and quickly walked away, leaving them no choice but to continue on with the mission blindly. They walked inside and sat in their self-assigned seating. With a rumble and a high pitched screech from the engines the jet took off, leaving both agents and pilot with four hours of free time and nothing to do.
Bucky snorted. “After everything you put me through? Hell, I'll
The conversation was loud from up the stairs but hushed down to a whisper until it slowly stopped completely when Rhodey and Tony reached the meeting spot. Everyone turned to look at them. Eyes full of questions at their presence. Tony shrunk down at their gazes. Thankfully Rhodey didn’t seem bothered at all.
“Please ignore them,” Steve said to him, mortified. “They don’t know what they’re talking about.”
They were in the middle of Tony explaining a tale that involved oil, Vision covered with it and Jarvis’ loose feathers when many of the betas and omegas hanging around the common area began to move and point and started talking excitedly amongst themselves.
“Fastest time for getting naked then?”
” He gasped in shock when Steve bit and didn’t let go. The sharp pain of the bite somehow mixing in with his arousal.
He turned the gauntlet in hand, revealing the palm and the light blue rune embedded in it. A brief touch caused the rune to faintly glow, bringing the everlasting magic trapped inside to the surface.
“It’s delicious,” he said, licking his lips and watching Steve follow the movement with his eyes. “Thank you for this.”
The heat in his belly build and build until he almost couldn’t stand it. He didn’t know if it was because of Steve or his cycle or a combination of both. He believed both. This was more than he had ever felt before and it was a miracle he hadn’t combusted yet and was still able to breathe. His air was taken with every bounce Steve had done. His eyes watered from so much stimulation. His cries were loud enough there was no doubt in his mind the citizens of the town had heard them.
He wondered if Happy was still a beta guard for the pack.
Tony couldn’t help the smirk that appeared. It disappeared when he sighed. “I don’t know.”
There was a faint whistling of wind echoing through a small opening that rustled the hanging leaves of a bush in its path. Tony locked in on the sound, following it in an almost hypnotic state. His eyes stared blindly while his body moved as if he knew the area by heart, engraved in his very soul, even though he never set foot on the place before in his life. When he came upon the opening, covered in bushes and vines, he reared back his arms and swiped the vegetation. A sickening slicing sound echoed around as the bushes and vines fell apart, covering the ground already bathing in grass.
That earned her a snicker from Clint. “You go, Cap.”
Hope you enjoyed it!
Hammer grinned. “I can’t wait to break you of this new disobedience, but we don’t have a lot of time here. Now come to me like a good boy and we’ll get going.”
It was Thor that ended up checking on Tony. It was surprising. A sight to see. The large feline using his hands in ways Tony never thought the warrior capable, nor thought possible. Handling his duty as if holding the most delicate of glass.
“Come now. We’ll let the betas pick up after the place. You and I have a lot to talk about, Darling.” Hammer led him deeper in the fort. They passed by faded portraits, rotten tables and broken chairs. Dust and dirt could be found on every available surface. Tony was surprised he hadn’t spotted a rat crawling around. The place was fitting for them.
He was finished, he was tired and he was ready to take every memory tainted by Hammer, pile it together and burn to the ground for the wind to take the ashes as far away from him as possible. He let his tears fall, let the memories under Hammer’s name slide out with every drop and wiped them away harshly, erasing them to never be brought forth again. This moment was about Tony and Steve only and Tony refused to let Hammer ruin it further. He wasn’t going to compare, he wasn’t going to believe, not until he experienced it with his pack, his family, and with Steve.
Heat reached his face in a matter of seconds. “You are insatiable!”
,” and drawing the alpha’s attention to him. Tony didn’t miss how Bucky whispered something to her. Whatever he had said caused her to finally release what submission she had been demanding. Whether conscious or unconscious.
Steve had begun walking, half of the pack following after him. Bucky came over to Sam to clap him on his shoulder in sympathy, but his words were anything but, “Pretty sure you never had the title of favorite from him. Growing up with that idiot entitles me as automatically being his favorite -”
By the next morning, Steve had them marching down the roads with little sunlight illuminating their way. They had left the small village with the inn before dawn hit. A few curious eyes on them and the silence of its shifters a testament to what they were about to face.
“Let’s just say my shift isn’t exactly welcoming or what’s expected of an omega to look.”
Back to back, they got ready. Hydra was around them, trying to circle them in. Their only saving grace was the thick greens of the forest making aiming difficult and forcing their enemies to expose themselves from the brush in order to get a clean shot. The moment the first shine of a barrel struck his eye Tony aimed steady and true to where he assumed was the rest of the enemy’s body, took a deep breath, commanded the magic in the runes to grow and
This time Steve stopped the standoff altogether for the sake of looking at his second in command with exasperation. “Shut up, Bucky.”
Steve goes feral once and a scene of carnage, of violence, with blood everywhere, is left behind him.
“Would you like to play with me?”
Tony turned to look at the aforementioned creek. The cool, clear water flowed through stacks of stones and circled to create a pond just mere feet away from them. The sight was enticing and had Tony had the energy he would’ve jumped in. The water would’ve done wonders to his tired body.
Steve barked again before deciding to finally start the day and stood up. Tony immediately missed the warmth that left him but his stomach agreed that their day needed to begin so it could get breakfast already.
He felt teeth on his ear and the yank that followed caused him to yip. He batted Rhodey's face in revenge.
Tony took notice of how everyone except for him and Bruce were shedding their clothing. The pack were getting ready to shift.
Tony pouted, “Aw, Jarvis, you should have let him go swimming instead. I bet he’ll look good with wet curls.”
“Are you finally going to tell us what this is about? We’re being assigned to something without a single idea of what’s going on,” Bucky said with a huffed that created a large puff of smoke.
the young alpha was for him.
“Where is he? What happened? Is he all right?” Steve responded, his voice laced with evident worry and alarm.
To be fair, he hadn’t had a lot of confidence in much for the past couple of years, but ever since he escaped Hammer’s and Stane’s hold and found Bruce and Steve and Jan and got his Rhodey back - he had something worthwhile.
“Hey!” Tony cried out in insult while Rhodey, Jarvis and Vision seemed to quietly agree together on the statement.
“You don’t have to,” Tony tried stopping them but his words fell on deaf ears as Clint and Sam ran straight for the river and leaped.
“I know. They’re good folks and I’m glad you’ll be working with him,” Steve gave him an encouraging lick at the tuffs of hair he could reach. “Is blacksmithing something you enjoy?”
“The hell is
Steve laughed at their antics. “They really are one of a kind. You’re very lucky to have them.”
“Little Star?” Loki called to him.
His pack haven’t demanded anything out of him, even after they learned of his smithing skills. Steve had never ordered anything of him either. Never forced him on his hands and knees for a quick rump on the sheets. Never ordered him to comply for anything he felt uncomfortable with. Tony knew if he revealed his adaptation with runes his pack wouldn’t dictate weapons or armors out of him. Steve wouldn’t demand him to have everyone fitted.
A crunch of grass made them pause and they turned when Steve's small voice said, “Tony?”
Another sob and Tony lunged to bury his face in the fur of Steve’s neck, wrapping his shaking arms around the wolf in desperation.
“Promise.”
He took a sharp breath. He couldn’t allow that. He needed to remain strong. Stay steady long enough to take his chance. If he faltered for even a second, it could cost him everything.
It could’ve. Family packs usually preferred avoiding any fights since they had children or elderly traveling with them and hated separating. That would explain why Tony managed to run away. The pack stuck together instead of breaking off and chasing after him, but from what little Tony saw from the pack he didn’t find any children with them, and their fur appeared soft and healthy and free from any whithered white fur, meaning they were in their prime.
He never found out what happened to the kid. Hammer never took them back to the town, but he figured the child most likely stayed in the town and continued the family pack. Found himself a mate and had maybe three or four pups running around. Worst case scenario he passed away from unfair fights or from his body giving way. Survival of the fittest, after all.
How would Tony even ask them about it?
it carried. “Are you the one who did it to him?”
“Who don’t we want to let go so soon?” All of them nearly jumped and turned their heads when Bucky’s voice rang in the room. They had been alone (a miracle in itself) while bidding goodbye but like water rushing in the Avengers trickled in the room one by one until everyone soul in the house was present.
In one shift Hammer was up with his hands on the seat and the roof of the carriage, keeping himself balanced as he settled one boot right over Tony’s abdomen. The location caught Tony completely off-guard. His chest was a better location to cause damage. His knees and shoulders, too. Why aimed there?
, ready for whatever was to come.
“You saved our lives, really. Steve has these eyes that make you want to bury yourself from the guilt. They’re dangerous eyes.” Clint created a circle with his hands and placed them over his face to mimic what was apparently Steve’s giant blue eyes.
Tony glared in reflex, cheeks pink. ‘
Bruce awkwardly ran a hand on the back of his neck, radiating discomfort. “I, huh, can’t shift either. For more private reasons.”
Steve tilted his head to the side in a fond move. “Here I thought a bath would be your priority.”
“I’m unaware, Sir,” Jarvis clawed up to Tony’s shoulder.
was the one causing Steve to react like that. Steve was flushed and aching because of him. It wasn’t just getting an urge over with. Steve having a quick romp on the bed with a warm, faceless body to sate a need. No, Steve cared and loved who he was sharing his intimacy with and doing so with Tony was making the experience hotter and breathtakingly better.
“It only takes a cornered animal seconds to slaughter.” There’s a grave tone in Thor’s voice. One that suggests it’s not meant to be a simple saying.
“Will you honor me with your presence?”
recommended side to use if stealth was the current goal. Their pack were also unaware of the gauntlets or the Hulk and revealing the two right before heading for battle and spooking them all was probably not the best idea.
“Figured that out, did you?” Tony wiggled a bit, unconsciously clenching on the knot and causing Steve to whimper. Not what he intended but he was happy with the outcome.
Here comes,” Sam took a deep breath and scrunched up his face, trying to be intimidating as he whispered, “
He snapped his head forward again, heart racing and legs trembling.
,” this was no joking matter. Tony’s entire understanding of the world around him just got flipped. Or at least this was a shock of a lifetime. He needed Steve to be serious.
If you're more than fine and dandy about it, carry on!
As for Clint, a couple of you suggested adding him in with Rhodey and Sam and I found I really, really love the idea. Expect some big protective Rhodey looking after his two little birds. So for Clint's winning ship it's going to be Sam/Rhodey/Clint.
“He speaks truth,” Thor nodded. “To many that weapon is nothing but a hold. To Loki it is a powerful means for his sorcery.”
Then, the alpha slowly pulled away. Tony couldn’t figure out the reason why. Bruce, Jan and Clint began making more appearances than Steve. In the mornings Steve still waited and greeted him. He still joined him on his trips to the smithy, but quickly disappeared when Tony and Ben started working. He reappeared again for the walk back home, bid his farewells, and again disappeared to who knows where and left him in the company of the omega and two betas.
managed to attract the alpha’s eyes with the outfit. It was
“I love you,” Steve pulled his teeth away just enough to whisper this against his bruised skin. “To have you here in my arms, to hold you…” The hand on his hip moved down between his legs, teasing his lips briefly before lining Steve up. The tip pushing against his folds just so. “I love you so much.”
, leader of said pack, court him and have as a mate kept repeating in his head. He’d have to wake up any minute now. Stuff like this never happened to him.
“Guys,” Steve muttered at them, the beginnings of a flush creeping on his cheeks.
They all did as planned and split, the whole pack going where they were ordered to go. Tony and Bruce followed after Clint, as per Steve’s command. They were to remain in hiding and strike from the shadows until the signal was given for them all to charge. Until then, bring down as many as they could from those patrolling the outer ring and forest without alerting anyone. They were to do their part to lessen the numbers.
He hoped the image he created of himself mirrored what he was desperate to represent. This was his chance to prove to his pack he was worth keeping around, even after he would unavoidably break their leader’s heart. He had one shot. He could do it.
It took a moment but even they gave in and agreed, “It’s true,” Steve said, remembering many times in the comics where Tony made wrong choices that Pepper had to quickly correct.
The particular high and intense shade of green Loki was controlling was fitting. A black snake emitting the hue of grass and healthy leaves. It was almost ominous and added to Loki’s already indifferent personality, and now Tony didn’t know if he was going to survive spending the day with kind and welcoming Jan and offhanded and solemn Loki.
Tony took in the words carefully. Of course, even with an omega in heat practically on his lap Steve would still hold himself back and ask for permission instead of just taking his right. He absolutely loved this alpha. “I… want you here, with me, helping me… I don’t want to take care of it alone,” he admitted, “but there’s a possibility that I’ll…” he trailed off. He wasn’t even sure if a pregnancy was possible now when he’d been naturally barren for most of his life. Just because he was in the middle of a cycle didn’t mean he was all of a sudden fertile. Even Loki had admitted he was unsure. Was it a risk or an unfounded concern?
