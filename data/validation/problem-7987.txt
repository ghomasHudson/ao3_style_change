"I can't believe you two." He turned to Steve. "And now I'm pissed at you for a totally different reason."
"What? How? Why?"
(Which was not something Steve would even tolerate hearing, much to Barnes' frustration. Tony had a sneaking suspicion Steve was happily living in denial about things that had happened in the course of the past seventy years, and he suspected even more that Barnes was growing more and more annoyed with this but was reluctant to say anything.)
early."
"Oh, so she's
"Clint or Bucky?"
"The hell you're fine," he snapped and looked down to Steve's bloodied gut. "Bruce?"
"—that'll be our first stop, OK? We'll go back and see your mom, and you can show off this gorgeous body that you picked up in your travels— oh, and probably show her what science was able to do for your body, too."
Steve dropped his hand from Tony's arm and shook his head some, resolute. "I don't want you to feel like you're stuck with me, Tony," he said, and Tony rolled his eyes.
Steve nodded, and he watched a moment longer before he said like he'd been dancing around bringing the subject up for a while and had finally decided to bite the bullet, "Uh…Buck said he had something he wanted to talk to me about. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?"
"Tony, stop it," he said with a grumble but still wouldn't look.
He still couldn't hear anything, so he stepped into the hallway and called out, "Steve?" No answer. "Steve?" Still no answer.
"Uh, you do see the type of work we're in, right?" Tony said, and Hill added, "Man has a point."
"We're not defending, Tony," Bruce said. "We're trying to get you to understand."
To be fair, he'd lived forty-odd years of his life as a brunette (excepting one…questionable instance in his younger days), so maybe he was just used to that more?
Tony stared straight at him, unblinking. "Yeah," he said again. "She loves her daddy."
"That's your first problem. You know that, right?"
"So, you are twenty years older than I am. Right now. Well, nineteen, technically."
"Oh," Barton said with a nod like he was actually familiar with it. "The childbirth video."
"He knew he grabbed too hard. He did seem surprised by it."
"Just…" He swallowed yet again. At least he could swallow. He couldn't breathe, but he could swallow. "Give me some time, OK?" he asked, and Steve held his gaze a moment before he nodded his understanding, and Tony turned and stepped onto the already-opened elevator, Barton presumably having taken the stairs.
"Thank you, Papa," she said and took the mug from him, putting both hands around it as she brought it to her mouth and began to drink, the excess dribbling down the sides of her mouth.
"Huh?"
"I'm sorry, baby girl—"
Without waiting for a response from Steve, he turned and began to make his way to the door, and Steve grimaced a little and said, "Tony, I really don't think they're going to take it well if they think I'm seeing another woman behind your back."
awful.
"Sorry," Steve replied. "No take-backs."
Tony jumped back and said, "Shit, Steve!" then got up and disappeared from the room. Steve just stared down at the remnants of his drink and tried to slow his pulse and his breathing from their heightened alert.
Steve stole a sideways glance at him. "Are you trying to tell me Santa and the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy are real?"
Tony shivered at the feel of Steve's hands on his. Fuck, could he make Steve just keep his hands on him forever? "One," he said, the word coming out as a murmur, and Steve snorted a laugh and said something about how he guessed he'd have to take it then kissed his temple then left the bathroom.
'You won't let me' was the only part of that sentence Steve understood.
Steve glanced at the clock on the microwave. "Not unless things have changed since I went in the ice and eight o'clock in the morning is a good time to go out on a date."
Tony, gripping the table as he blinked the dizziness away, shot a look at Bruce and said, "You
"We just will. That's what parents do — that's what any parent does, superhero or not. You protect your kid from all the shit in the world or you do the best you can to. I mean, yeah, maybe our jobs are a little more…dangerous than the average, and she's had a target painted on her back since before she was born, but we do what we have to in order to keep her safe. We fight and we defend and we protect — her, the world, whatever. We're Avengers. It's what we do. We do what we can to make the world as safe as we can for everyone — for everyone's kids."
"It means…"
"I think it looks great. Goes well with your coloring," Natasha said then added, "I think Steve will appreciate it very much."
"Someone's got to keep an eye on you."
" he said, squeaking out the word because damn this voice. "Is that how you remember it?"
He shook his head to clear his mind of those thoughts — later, he'd worry about that later — and went over to pull the blankets up for her.
Bruce had stepped away from his workstation and was now standing beside Steve, both of them staring at him with worried looks of concern. Tony took a breath and glanced away from the weight of their gazes, intending to apologize for his outburst but finding he just…didn't want to. Because on some level he meant it. He meant all of it. And maybe he wanted them to know that.
He wasn't even sure if he'd told Tony about those thoughts.
"Hey, if I'm going to be freaked out by possibly gestating demon spawn, then so are you."
He snorted a laugh. "It means that Tony and Pepper are going to be OK."
"You won't let me install Friday here, so I guess I have to go check on our wee little one the old- fashioned way."
He scratched at his forehead but said, "Yeah, I think— Yeah, I think I can do that."
Tony shot a sour look at Natasha and nodded his head at Barton. "Is this what we're like?"
"But he came back and—"
Steve made a face. "Well, that's tougher to figure. Ma was always about wanting me to be happy, but Ma was also, you know, old-fashioned—"
Barton shrugged. "Don't know, but we'll never find out."
"Yeah, well, sorry for taking the easy route. But see, I'm kind of tired and bloated and constipated and suffering from indigestion, like, constantly now. I have a gigantic, twenty-pound watermelon strapped to my gut that, for whatever reason, feels that the prime time to become active is when I'm trying to relax. I can't think straight. I tried to attach an eggbeater to one of my drills because I couldn't find the hand mixer the other day. I tried to sneak some coffee earlier because, yes, I have a box of those horrible Folgers single-serve packs shoved in my desk, but instead of adding cream like I meant to, I grabbed the orange juice —
"Look, it— it's just drinks."
"Oh," she said with an easy shrug. "Then Unca Bucky musta come home early, too, 'cuz Anna Tasha and Unca Bucky say we're too much to handle alone. They always gots t' back up."
"But you're Captain America! You're the most trustworthy person on the
Which, you know, might have been feasible in some way if their ranks were not literally made up of half-a-dozen members, and two of those members were out of commission for the time being. It wasn't that they didn't want to help, it was just tough to do when they were already stretched thin to begin with.
"He didn't cry."
Tony, knowing exactly what had caught Steve's attention, smiled a little, and then he put his hands up to his breasts and cupped them gently through the material, making sure not to rip any of the tape that was keeping the material attached to them.
Romanoff and Barton both turned to him, and he felt his face flush a little with embarrassment — evidently
No, that was the little parasite thumping or turning or whatever the fuck it was doing inside of him.
— Well, it's something I'm trying out."
"Babe," he said, and Steve looked up and met his eyes, "you didn't do anything wrong.
He sat down, tugging Steve with him, and Steve sat beside him and settled Olivia onto his lap. "Rats?"
Steve sighed out a breath. "Well, don't sugar coat it," he muttered. "Give it to me straight."
old, Stark."
"Good," Steve said just as Tony had reached the top of the steps, "I don't find them very attractive. I like my men short and wiry."
"I'm sure LA will be devastated to know that Captain America has declared their ball team dead to him."
"Why? What is it? What's wrong?" Steve asked, sensing something from Thor's tone that had gone clear over Tony's head. Thor focused his gaze on Tony, almost as though he was inspecting him, before he turned his attention to Steve.
"Fair enough," he replied, "but let me just explain how
my parents, Steve!"
"I don't think you have the high ground on that one, Tony," Bruce said and reached around Tony to swipe at things on the screen. "Didn't that happen in a SHIELD conference room?"
"That's not the point."
"Well, that's on them, not us."
He awoke to cold and an eerie wind and hard, solid earth beneath him. He opened his eyes, slowly, to be greeted by a campsite and a crick in his neck from where he'd slept on his helmet, and Dugan was sitting there with a pan of cold water as he trimmed his beard and offered Steve a, "Merry Christmas, Cap. Slept well, I take it?"
in the city now—"
" Tony cried, and she turned her attention to him.
," Tony said after he'd swallowed the bite. "It was just… Look, it's a long story, and maybe it made me question everything I'd ever accepted about myself, but whatever. It's…"
"There," he said, "should be good to go. How's it feel?"
She gasped in delight. "Unca Rhodey! C'n I go with you?"
"I remember very plainly stating my case to the manager that the prices they were charging for their hors d'oeuvres were a bit exorbitant."
"Thanks," Steve said and took hold of Tony's elbow to lead him out.
He must have been pretty bad if even he could smell it.
He reached in and grabbed the bottle of orange juice, and he grabbed a glass from the cabinet and settled down to his plate. He propped up the tablet Steve had left lying there and pulled up a current news station feed and only half-paid attention to it as the host droned on about some sort of turmoil on Capitol Hill before he saw his own image reflected back at him — or what had been his image up until a few months ago.
But he loved her, loved he like he'd never loved anyone. It was strange how easily this feeling was able to overcome him. Maybe it wasn't really love. Maybe it was just some pathetic and desperate need to
to feel it or concentrating on it or trying to figure out if there was some way to trigger it. He didn't know why he was so obsessed with it. Maybe because this finally, well and truly, made it real. Because before this, yeah, he
was what he did for her. It wasn't odd to her. It wasn't the sort of amazed elation he felt whenever Howard had deigned to acknowledge him. This was comfort in knowing she was loved and was wanted, in knowing and accepting that her Papa would always be there for her.
He thought back to what Olivia had said about what that other him called that other Steve. 'Honey.' 'Babe.' Funny that when it was just they two, when the ills and pressures of the world were a thousand miles away, and it was just they two caught up in quiet discussion in a workshop, well…
"It's as hardcore as we get nowadays. Alcohol doesn't do anything for you — not even Thor's special Asgardian mead — and I…sort of had a problem with it in my not-entirely-younger days."
"Hmm?"
And he thought about Steve, too — that other Steve, the one that had kissed him like it was the last time he ever would, the one that had gazed into his eyes with nothing but love and devotion behind his crystalline blue irises. There were times, when he and this Steve were just hanging out chatting or getting coffee or a drink, that he could see elements of that other Steve in his. There were moments that he swore he saw his Steve — OK, not really
"Maria."
And by the time all that was said and done, JARVIS was announcing the arrival of the 'jet, and Tony said, "Have the Iron Man armor escort Steve to the penthouse, please, J."
"Yes, Sir," he replied, his voice shakier with want than he'd ever felt it.
idea how long he'd been here for.
Steve Rogers had sperm that carried 'X' chromosomes, but not here. For all he knew,
"Yeah."
"How long?"
"I didn't know what worrying was until I became a parent," he mused. "Corny as it sounds, I didn't know what 'love' was either. Not to say I didn't love you, babe, but it's a different kind of love. You feel it in your bones — at least I do. Or maybe that's 'cause I—"
, but it wasn't something of our choosing, and now we have to live with the consequences, and I hate the idea that we have to make the best of a bad situation, but to a degree, we do, and I am going to do whatever I can to make this the best situation as I possibly can for you. Because you're mine, and I'm sticking by you through thick and thin, for better or worse, forever and ever, understand?"
But did he have to so blatantly ignore the life that was sitting right next to him in order to do that?
Steve was silent a moment before he said, "
Steve just continued petting him and said, "Don't you listen to him. He loves you. He just has a reputation he has to uphold." And then, he leaned in and whispered loudly like he was conspiring with the 'bot but still wanted Tony to hear what he was saying. "But that's OK, because we know the truth. We know how much of a sentimental pushover he really is."
"Remember what I said?" he asked as he stroked Tony's belly. "You are not allowed to come until I tell you."
"No?" he asked, the word catching in his throat.
"No, dude," Sam said and pointed down the hallway. "He's coming, like, right this second."
in this room introduced the old man to the concept of 'recycling'—" he used finger quotes on the word, "—and now I get fucking shit from Greenpeace and 'save the oceans' and sad pictures of animals caught in those stupid soda can holder-things in my inbox seven days a week. Actually, those are really sad, and if I see anyone throwing out one of those soda can holder- things without cutting it up first, you're out on the street."
Tony hummed in understanding and nodded as he hit a drawer with his hip to close it and set a small assortment of spoons and knives beside the plate of bagels. "Yeah," he said, "you're 'Daddy.' I'm 'Papa.'"
"Why? Does it bother you? Does it offend you when I do that? Oh, I wouldn't want to hurt your feelings, Steve. You are going through quite the trying time here."
Tony waved him off. "Yeah, yeah, I know. You've said it a thousand times. It starts to lose all meaning after a while, though, I want you to know that."
"No kidding," Steve murmured, Olivia cradled in his arms. "You know, they did that back in my day, too."
Tony switched it back.
But Tony just went over to the exam table and picked up the paper smocks that had been left there for him. "Wait, I'm supposed to take off all my clothes in front of a stranger and put
Barnes looked genuinely touched by that, a little in awe and maybe even seeming to feel a little like it was undeserved while Wilson muttered, "Oh,
"I thought it was 'our' money?"
"Yeah, he better just
The guy just looked at him and made a face like he wasn't sure why Tony would need to know that, but Steve said from behind him in his utmost Captain America voice, "We can't make you believe anything. We can only lay out the facts of the matter as they exist. Tony Stark was turned into a woman. Tony and I… I got Tony… We conceived a…"
Because maybe he
"Tough," Steve said and, letting instinct rule him, grabbed Tony's legs and pushed them up and open, taking only a moment to appreciate the difference in his anatomy. Again, this was the first time he'd ever gotten this far with a woman, and, to be honest, he really didn't know exactly what to do — was it different than what he normally did with Tony? — but as though some primal urge was controlling him, and with a brazenness he didn't know he possessed, he stuck a finger between the folds of flesh, warmth and slickness greeting him, and brushed the pad of his finger against what he found there, Tony humming and pushing into the touch. His finger hit something hard and rounded like a pea, and Tony hissed and gasped and said, "Shit," but didn't otherwise complain, and Steve stroked that area a few times before he dragged his finger down and inserted it inside of Tony. He crooked his finger just a little and rubbed his middle knuckle against the slick heat he found there, Tony gasping and then moaning ever so quietly beneath him. It felt different than the hole Steve usually filled, but no less pleasurable, and after what he assumed was a few minutes of stroking Tony's newly-found most-intimate parts, he pulled his hand out then lined himself up, teasing the entrance with the tip of his cock and watching as Tony pushed down again and tried to meet him. He glanced up to see Tony with his head thrown back, bottom lip between his teeth and eyes squeezed shut, and he watched as Tony released his red, swollen bottom lip and breathed out a desperate, "Please, Steve. Please."
"Oh, come on, Tony," Bruce said. "Let Nat drive. She wants to do something nice for you."
Barton shook his head and laughed a little. "You're gonna wish you hadn't said that," he murmured in a sing-song voice, and Wilson turned to Steve and Tony and said, "You figure out a boy's name yet?"
"Yes, you did," he murmured into Tony's breastbone, Tony's taste on his tongue. "You wouldn't have said it otherwise."
Tony wasn't sure that's what should have been her main takeaway from what they were telling her, but he still said, "Yeah? How?"
Steve stared at him, evidently unimpressed with his characterization of his prior experience.
"You should stop reading that shit."
Tony groaned and ran his hands down his face, and he picked his head up and said, "This doesn't make any sense. Where the fuck did she even come from? How the fuck did she even get here?
"We have the room for another night."
iffy on. Oh, he means well, and he loves you. Don't think that he doesn't. But, well, he's just not—"
"Yeah, you're right. It's not like I'm sitting here as a man that's been turned into a woman that's been impregnated by a science project from the '40s."
it. Here." He made a fist and held it against his sternum right above his heart. "I— I don't know how to explain it, and I know it sounds…
"You're still going to school?"
," JARVIS replied and took him back up to the penthouse.
"No, I'm saying it looks like a frat house threw up on Captain America."
"Yeah, no, I'm thinking more along the lines of a certain bigmouth AI that was probably a little too forthcoming with certain pieces of information."
I thought this was one of those free-consult things?"
Barnes continued to shake his head. "No, it— It feels…OK," he said, almost like he was surprised at the fact that the words were actually earnest.
"That's something I should probably know," Tony said, which earned him rolled eyes from Bruce and a pat on the arm from Romanoff.
Steve must have sensed he had gone too far, as he dropped Tony's wrist like it had burned him, a look of surprise on his face, and Tony glared at him, narrowing his eyes, and said, "You don't like bullies, Steve? Take a fucking look in the mirror."
is why it was you, why it has always been you. It could never have been your bonded. You both fight for life, but he does not give life; he merely takes it away. You give life, you create life, and now—" she nodded her head at the infant cradled in Tony's arms, "—you bear it with your own body."
"Well, the simplest reason is because you love me and you want me to be happy, but you don't know that yet, so sit down. Jesus. I find it insulting that people insist
Tony slid his hand down over Steve's abdomen then reached beneath the hem of his shirt and slid his hand right back up over the hard, firm lines of muscle.
"Don't you mean am I still going to marry you? I already asked, and you already said 'yes.' And does this mean you're actually going to try—"
"Would you go back? If given the chance—"
"I teach art during the day, and I work as a museum security guard at night. I have a shitty apartment in Brooklyn, and I let my driver's license expire two years ago. I like sesame seed bagels and ordering people around. I draw in what little spare time that I have, and, as my friends tell me, I'm hopeless when it comes to popular culture. I made the mistake of saying to them one time that I understood a reference, and I haven't heard the end of it yet."
Steve had gotten up from the couch by this point, and he looked over Tony's shoulder and said, "Oh, yeah, you, uh...you had a hard time with it at first."
anything—"
Tony opened his eyes at that, and Steve paused his caresses, his hand hovering over Tony's abdomen. Tony met his gaze, and it was like a light had gone off over his head and realization had dawned on him.
Steve let out a chuckle. "Please don't buy me a gallery, Tony."
"Here," she said and tried to lead Tony…somewhere. "Let me help you—"
"Head wounds bleed like a son-of-a-bitch. I'm sure you know that, though."
"And already plumping up with the fruit of your bonded's seed!" she added before Tony was able to shove her hand away. She turned to Steve. "You must be such a proud Papa."
"Oh!" Tony said, suddenly going animated. "Remember a while back Steve talked about having some dream where he spent a day in the future?"
"Kind of. Yeah. It's the 'in' thing now. Everyone's switching to LEDs. More expensive, but they use a hell of a lot less power than your standard incandescent."
Now, it was entirely possible that Tony was biased, but the wriggly little newborn he'd decided to call Olivia Louise Stark-Rogers — alternate universes be damned — was definitely in the Top 5 cutest babies ever born. Maybe Top 3. Yeah, OK, sure, maybe she kind of still had that 'fresh from the womb' look, but he was certain she was definitely Top 3 'fresh from the womb.' She had chubby cheeks, pouty lips, and a stubborn chin, and he knew even without anyone else pointing it out that her warm brown eyes were a perfect match for his. She was alert and curious in ways he'd never expected of a newborn, turning her head at odd sounds — like DUM-E's curious beeps and whirs as he sat in his corner and raised his arm every so often to get a look at the strange little intruder — and calming her fussing whenever Tony talked to her. She made weird gurgling noises and shook tiny fists in the air whenever she was able to fight them free of the towel she was wrapped in, and even if — according to the literature (what? Yeah, OK, maybe he'd read more than he'd let on) — her eyesight left much to be desired, he was certain that she could see him clear as a bell as she stared up at him, a grumpy little look on her face as she seemingly tried to figure him out.
He held up a red-toenailed food. "Look at me. Barefoot and pregnant," he said through his laughs. Pepper groaned and rolled her eyes, and he nudged her and said, "Oh, come on! You've got to find that a little funny!"
Wait, no, that's how Tony
by his high chancellor only fed those rumors. But the King's face had hardened and sharpened in the intervening years, and he'd even grown a dark patch of hair that framed his mouth at hard, sharp angles. His form was a bit stocky, like his father, but he did not bear any other physical hallmarks that were more to be found in women than in men. The carnal pleasures that the King enjoyed might have been similar to the kind that women enjoyed, but there was no mistaking the King for anything other than what he was.
Look, he trusted Steve, and he knew Steve's relationship with Barnes was more like that of brothers — like the way his relationship with Rhodey was. He knew Steve's search for Barnes was more about doing right by his friend and not because he was mourning the loss of the one that got away.
"It was stupid in 1944, and it's still stupid in 2014," Steve muttered and switched the channel again.
Steve flushed harder, if that was possible. They were
But Steve nodded and said, "I know I can be reckless." He looked up at Tony again. "I know I— I know I can't keep doing that. I know I have to—"
He watched as Bruce frowned at him, almost like he was pitying him.
Tony paused in the middle of attempting to unhook the cup. "What?" he said and looked up at Bruce. "I wasn't— You're not
saw it.
"Really?" Tony asked, heartened by her offer.
"Oh, is he complaining about the wrapping paper again?" Tony asked as he came back into the living area, balancing a large tray of coffee mugs and a plate of cookies in his grasp. He went to set the tray on the coffee table when he saw Mjölnir stationed right in the middle of it, and he scowled and nodded at it and said, "Hey, you mind moving that pointless paperweight?"
Tony just blinked. "You say that as though it's a bad thing."
He took a sip of coffee and stared at Steve like he just dared him to fight him on that, and Steve stared right back and thought very hard about defending the practices of the medical profession from when he was a kid, but even he could admit that their methods had been...somewhat lacking, at least in comparison to how they practiced today.
“Second,” he continued, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. It
"So, this is what you meant when you said I wasn't ready for it," Steve mused, and when Tony looked at him for explanation, he added, "When I asked some questions about her parentage."

"You're going to get me in trouble."
"What? It's not like it's your
Steve turned to give her another murderous glare, but Tony reached a hand out to him and said, "Hey! Ignore her. Look at me."
Steve just stared at him like he was considering his words before he nodded just a little but didn't meet Tony's gaze.
Other Tony stared at him, flat. "I take after my mom."
Bruce sighed and pulled away from the machine. "Would you go relax?" he all but begged, a tired whine to his voice.

"Yeah, you do."
Tony frowned and looked at her, head tilted like he wasn't sure of her point.

under false pretenses. That's not the way they present it, of course, but yes, given that Captain America tried to con the draft board in World War II, I could completely believe that he's sitting here now trying to con me into a marriage license."
Steve just blinked, not really getting the meaning or joke, if it was one. "Are you?"
He shot a glance at where Olivia sat enraptured by some kid's cartoon, and he took hold of Rhodey by his elbow and led him over to the kitchen to allow for some more privacy.
"Tony," Bruce said with a sigh.
. It's War Machine. It's the
"This was a gift?" Steve asked.
"Starting to think I could use a vacation here," he muttered and set the eggs and butter on the counter and grabbed a pan from a cabinet. He looked at it askance as he set it on the burner, and he glanced back at her. "You don't mind if they're burned, right?"
fix — or there's no way
Steve put his hands on Tony's thighs, running his fingers beneath the straps that connected the garter to the stockings, and Tony bowed his head so that he and Steve were pressed forehead-to- forehead, and he murmured, "Any time you're ready, babe."
Tony smiled but didn't open his eyes. "You're a filthy old man. You know that, right?"
After all, he had responsibilities as a husband, too.
"'Cause
," Wilson said, shaking his head but staring right back at Barnes, who continued to guzzle it down, milk dripping down the sides of his mouth and spilling onto his shirt. He continued to drink until there was no more, a good portion of it drenching his shirt, and he tipped his head back even more to get the last few droplets before he pulled the empty container away. He wiped his mouth off with the back of his hand and let out the most obscene belch Tony had ever heard before he said, "Oh, sorry, I just drank the last of it."

"What Cap tells Stark every night," Barton said, and Tony rolled his eyes and decided not to dignify such a stupid comment with a response.
Tony turned to Other Tony and said, "Who's your father?" because clearly he had no business knowing, but he wanted to know anyway.
Hill led them over to an open table that sat overlooking the dance floor down below, and as they settled onto their chairs, Hill waved off the wait staff that had come over to take their drink order and said, "I get my own booze at these places," once the waiter had left.
"Well, don't
He used finger quotes on the word 'dead,' and Steve considered this a moment then said, "Do you think I could pull off doing that?"
Tony squeezed his eyes shut at the familiar and intimate name.
"It's not a kink," Steve said, almost like he was going on offense so that Tony didn't get any ideas in his head. "I mean I don't— It's not because— It's not like seeing you in that lacy, uh,
"Really?" Steve asked like he wanted to make absolutely certain Tony had meant exactly what he'd said, and Tony ran his fingers through his hair and said, "Uh, yeah. So, I mean, I wasn't
Tony shrugged. "If I read that article right…"
"Sorry," Tony said and stretched a little in his seat. "For what?"
The guy put his hand to Tony's abdomen, and something harsh and cold seized him and screamed through his veins — almost like the exact opposite feeling to when Steve put his hand there. He shivered and pushed past it and said, "You seem like just the kind of man for us."
"Pepper and Happy," Sam said, something funny — maybe something bordering on jealousy? — coloring the tone of his voice.
"Yeah, but it's not the same," Barton said and bit into another slice of toast.
He shook his head as though to stop himself from talking. He reached out and put his hands on Steve's arms as though to anchor him, and he tilted his head to look up and said, "Merry Christmas," as he captured Steve's lips with his own.
"Yeah, but then I had to touch it up because it doesn't last. I mean look, I get why men shave their faces. We'd all look like burly mountain men if we didn't—"
"I don't think your ninety-pound asthmatic self could

"—listens to everything we say, but she can't repeat it yet. I mean, maybe when—"
Steve pinched his side, wrenching a squealed shriek from him, and he reached back and slapped the side of Steve's ass, the crack of flesh against flesh ricocheting around the room, and said, "You filthy, old man," realizing too late that slapping Steve like that was a sure-fire way of getting him rock-hard again.
belt on, too. That was an argument he hadn't won yet, and he didn't feel like getting into it tonight. They didn't have seat belts back in his day? Yeah, well, they didn't have Wi-Fi back in his day, either, and yet he was perfectly fine using
Tony rolled his eyes and grabbed his mug of coffee. "No, I'm feeding my own child poisoned slop. Baby girl, are they edible?"
"Well," Barton said, "see, Stark, when a super soldier and a billionaire love each other very much—"
Steve hedged then said, "I think he's got the rest of them convinced it's a girl. Buck just asked me before if we had a girl's name picked out just in case. I know that look he had on his face, too. That look he gets when he thinks I'm wrong but he knows I'm still going full-steam-ahead with something anyway."
"Sass-bot," he muttered then took a deep breath and said, "Give me a rundown on the stages of labor and childbirth. Don't sugarcoat it. I want to know exactly what I'm getting myself into."
"I'm so sorry, Tony," Steve said, sounding absolutely wrecked. "I'm so sorry. I should have— I was selfish, and I wasn't thinking, and I shouldn't have—"
"Is that what we're calling staring at my nether regions and waiting for a human head to pop out from inside of there?"
from useless." He brushed his thumb over Steve's cheek and added, "You're the only one all of us can even be bothered to listen to."
"Tony, may I ask," Doctor Ganford said once Steve had pulled his hand back, "have you accepted what's happening to you yet?"
that I don't enjoy proving you people wrong on a daily basis," Tony said as he strolled into the kitchen later that morning, the rest of the Avengers gathered around the island and, oh, didn't it just figure that
"I didn't know you two were so
, don't put expectations on him that he can't meet. He doesn't want to disappoint you, but I think he's afraid that he can't be exactly what you want him to be."
Two months later~
"Sounds plausible, yeah. Sorry, I just thought that you wanted to hide something from me.", mumbled Tony and leaned into Steves tender touches.
"Jarvis, are you here?", seconds of silence passed and the team almost gave the hope up that Tony's Artificial Intelligence was activated.
"When did he call him?", asked Bruce, there was a short pause.
Tony woke up hours later with a giant headache. He slowly blinked his eyes open only to close them seconds later. He felt definitely dead. Maybe he was dead.
"I knew that Howard was possessed of me. I mean come on I was just a weak kid with asthma back then and he transformed me into a super hero. But believe me if I knew that he would hate on his own son, maybe I would have murdered him myself.", Tony's eyes widened in shock and he felt like he was punched in the stomach.
Minutes of silence passed by as the computer tried to authorize the video.
It took a few minutes for Tony to finally cam down before he freed himself out of Steve's hug.
----------------------------------------------
"My parents died in a car crash, they weren't murdered", Tony didn't trust his own voice and Steve frowned slightly at his husband's missing knowledge.
"YES! Of course, how could I say no?", Steve laughed as he slowly stood up Tony still in his strong arms. Steve began to kiss Tony like there was no tomorrow. They were finally engaged. He was finally engaged with the love of his life. Steve pulled away for a second and put the ring slowly on Tony's ring finger. He then continued to kiss him. Tony smiled widely and kissed his finance eagerly back and Steve put his hands to Tony's neck to push him deeper into the kiss. They both had to pull away minutes later to get air into their lungs.
Weird, he thought.
"I am sorry that you had to find out that way. But I promise you that my feelings were always real. They never changed and I want you to know that when I proposed to you and when we married that I only had eyes for you.", Tony didn't even have time to comprehend the words because the second Steve stopped talking he went forward and kissed him fiercely on the lips.
Steve carefully grabbed the bottle and the brunette instantly began struggling against his chains.
"I know I ask that a lot lately. But are you fine? You seem worried.", said Steve as he tried to make eye contact with his husband.
Steve is Hydra... The love of his life was a part of Hydra.
"Captain, what's up?", Rumlow sounded stressed at the moment but the blonde could nonetheless hear respect in his voice.
"It's alright. It's alright. Just concentrate on my hug. It's okay, honey. It's okay.", Tony tried to focus on the hug and began to slowly breathe in and out. Steve hugged him. He knew that Steve worked for Hydra but Tony couldn't find a difference now that he knew.
"I am sorry. I feel so overwhelmed. It's like my feelings are all over the place. I don't know what's happening I felt so happy only a few seconds ago and now I can't stop crying. I am such a mess.", the billionaire continued crying and Steve carefully threw a blanket over him and did his best to shush him down.
"Honey, if you don't mind I would like to ask you a very important question", Tony looked at Steve confusion in his whiskey brown eyes and he gave his boyfriend an unsure look. Steve smiled before he began his speech.
"There is only one problem, at your plan, gorgeous. I will not drink this shit! You can't make me because I will spit it out even before it went down my pipe! I am afraid that you have to get yourself another slave!", shouted Tony and hoped that Steve didn't hear how his voice wavered.
Have fun :3
"Is it true?", Steve raised his right eyebrow at the question because he had no clue what Tony meant with that question.
He was going to die.
„Yeah, our Captain is being weird.", agreed Thor he just wanted to suggest to start the movie as he heard the elevator opening. Tony and Steve stepped out of it both extremely happy as they sat down on the couch.
"You- you drugged our friends! You drugged me! You shot Fury, ruined our own wedding! I don't even know if you just played with my feelings or if you really love me I don't know!", Tony took a deep breath and tried to calm down.
He just wanted to run into the forest again as he felt strong electricity coursing through his body and he fell unconsciously to the sandy ground.
"I love you too. No offense baby but you smell, maybe we should both get a shower?", asked Steve and captured Tony's soft lips for another desperate kiss, the billionaire closed his eyes satisfied and smirked into the kiss. The soldier placed his hands on Tony's waist and pressed the brunette hard against his chest. Tony yelped surprised at that but instantly melted into his boyfriend's strong body.
, Bruce jumped up from his seat and the others looked at him with a confused look.
"I didn't care about the team. I only cared about the tesseract. Until I saw your precious face on one of the S.H.I.E.L.D files. I absolutely hated you as I read that you were Howard's son. But then I read about all the things you had done. You turned from an arrogant playboy to a selfless superhero.
Tony bit his lower lip so hard that he tasted blood on them but he finally managed to slip out of the right cuff even though he dislocated his thumb. He instantly was met with a furious Steve who just walked into the small room.
„Hey, it's okay, honey. It's not your fault. These bastards ruined our wedding, not you. You were perfect and I love you so much.", whispered Steve and caressed Tony's hazelnut brown hair.
”I love you", whispered Steve as he leaned down to place a soft kiss on Tonys lips. Steve instantly froze because his lover didn't kiss back. He just let it happen and that alone was kinda weird because Tony always responded when Steve kissed him. The blonde carefully pulled away and realized that fat tears ran down the brunette's face. How the fuck didn't he notice that?!
Why were there no other tourists? There were 20 other little holiday huts and they seemed completely empty.
"Come on. You want me to kill them?", his legs wobbled, and his eyes got teary as he watched how Rumlow pressed a gun against Natasha's body. He had to protect her, he had to protect his friends.
The mechanic nodded quietly at that and came to the conclusion that Steve really just wanted to have a normal honeymoon.
"Trust me, honey. It's getting even better.", said Steve, a huge smile on his face, they then went to Ladies Pavilion, Bow Bridge, Bethesda Fountain, and the Mall and Literary Walk. Tony loved every single place and the thought that this amazing day would end soon made him kinda sad.
Captain Steve Rogers was a Hero. He was an amazing cook, an incredible artist, a good friend, and an even better boyfriend. No one could have guessed that the national Icon of the United States led a Nazi Organization. S.H.I.E.L.D was the new Hydra and no one, besides the own members knew. Tony should have known that something was wrong. The team often tried to talk to him about Steve's weird behavior. He spent most of his time at the S.H.I.E.L.D Compound. I didn't take part in the movie nights. And he barely cooked. Tony missed him of course, they were together for almost two years and it seemed like Steve didn't love him anymore. Tony spent his time in his workshop, he thought about new designs for Caps shield, maybe Steve would appreciate it. And maybe it would distract him from the thought that the soldier didn't love him anymore. The thought sent shivers down his spine and his stomach twisted. He didn't even realize that Nat entered the workshop with some food and a water bottle.
How the fuck would he be able to work on his suits through a TV or a radio.
"Central Park, you have to get away from all your work. I thought we could explore some places.", Steve couldn't wait to show Tony all the special places there. He knew that the billionaire had always been to busy for outdoor activities like this.
" Where are we?", Tony sounded so god damn vulnerable that it actually broke Steves's heart.
"I think I am doing fine. Thanks.", mumbled Tony and his husband pressed a soft kiss on his forehead.
"Jarvis, we are sorry, but the wedding was a complete mess. Turned out that Steve and a lot of people from S.H.I.E.LD are part of Hydra.", mumbled Clint, he still couldn't believe it. How could Captain America do something like that?!
"Is there a specific reason why there's no technology?", asked Tony and Steve frowned at the rather innocent question.
His thoughts were interrupted when he felt two strong arms around his waist which pulled him into a tight hug.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony gasped at the sight he got through the window. There was a freaking turquoise lagoon, green palms, and a swimming pool. Tony jumped up and looked out of the window. They were on the Maldives in the 5 stars luxury resort hotel he always wanted to go.
The blonde hummed and Tony felt a wave of nausea hit him.
Part of Tony told him to get away and another part of him wanted to stay.
"You found anything, yet?", asked Natasha as she saw how Clint entered the room with a DVD in his right hand.
Bruce, Clint, and Thor already sat on the couch watching the news channel as they waited for Steve and Tony.
"I wanna take a shower.", mumbled Tony, he yawned quietly and Steve saw that as a sign that he needed to bring Tony upstairs for a shower and then into their bedroom. Steve nodded and carefully picked him up bridal style. He selected his and Tony's floor at the elevator and brought his boyfriend silently into the bathroom, where he let him carefully down.
"Okay... So Steve is Hydra, the fucking Strike team is Hydra and even Alexander Pierce the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D is Hydra!
Steve pulled out the small syringe which was in his pocket and Tonys' breath began to speed up.
"My apologies Dr. Banner. Captain Rogers deactivated me through the wedding it took me some time to reboot.", Jarvis's voice sounded kind and it seemed like he didn't know what had happened.
Tony couldn't remember the last time he slept so well. He was pretty sure that it was already 10 am as he slowly blinked his eyes open to see Steve sitting beside him a huge grin on his face. The engineer smiled softly back before he stood up and stretched his arms.
Steve used this opportunity to speak up.
"Tony no! He is going to force you to-", Rhodey couldn't even finish what he was about to say because Tony instantly continued screaming.
"Stop!", Clint flinched at Nat's order and stopped the video as fast as he could.
"What are you talking about? Steve is one of the only people who love me! He cares for me, protects me and does everything to make me happy!", exclaimed Tony over the phone and tried to keep his calm.
Tony turned around to look into Steve's ocean blue eyes.
"The drugs began to kick in at that moment. You can see it on how our legs began to wobble. Continue the video.", Clint pushed the space bar and it could be seen how Steve kissed Tony and the guests went unconscious, one after another.
"The champagne was drugged. Turns out Hydra ruined our wedding.
"Is there any sound?", asked Natasha as she realized that the whole video was mute.
"Hey, guys! What are we watching?", asked Tony as he cuddled himself into Steves's warm chest and threw a blanket to every team member. Bruce couldn't help but smile at that. He knew that Tony was sad the last few days and that he barricaded himself in his workshop, but he was glad that this changed.
"Tony, I thought the Doctor told you that you should use pills against insomnia. Where do you keep them?", asked Steve softly and rubbed slow circles on the taller ones back. Tony began to pout at that question.
Tony let out a soft moan and tried to deepen the kiss even more. Steve carefully massaged his husbands thighs and rubbed small circles over his jeans. "Off.", mumbled the brunette almost desperate as the soldier continued to pet his thigh.
"No! Of course not, why should I take my smartphone with me, if I don't want you to use it? That would be unfair to you.", reasoned Steve and began to caress Tony's cheek.
He didn't care about everyone else like the priest or their friends and the many hydra agents like Pierce, Rumlow, Sitwell, and Ward that sat in the crowd.
, Rhodey frowned at the sight before him, Tony had also been drugged.
The brunette felt a tear of frustration running down his cheeks.
"We should head back to the tower. It's movie night after all.", mumbled Tony as they kept walking through Central Park. Steve nodded at that and pressed a quick kiss to Tony's cheek.
Tony looked suspiciously at the small bottle and Steve kneeled beside him as he noticed his husbands look. He set the item down at the bedside table and tried his best to make eye contact.
"Feeling better?", asked Steve as he stroked his husband's hair.
"Yeah sounds fun.", he pressed a soft kiss on Tony's lips before he told him to get dressed and to eat something.
You are beautiful, strong, intelligent and so much more. I fell in love with you and decided to wait with the whole world domination until you would be by my side.", Tony bit on his bottom lip and pressed his eyes closed. This couldn't be true.
"And then Steve proposed to me.", said Tony which lead the others to stare at the couple with wide eyes. "Congratulations! That came unexpected but it's great!", said Natasha and the others also congratulated them. Steve smiled and held Tony the rest of the movie night protectively against his chest. Oh, he couldn't wait for the day when Tony was finally his. He had everything planned out. Their wedding would be spectacular.
"Steve? I feel kinda funny.", giggled the brown-eyed and repeated the word funny again.
"STEVE! HELP ME!", it didn't take another three seconds and the light was suddenly turned on.
"I love you so much.", said Tony as he got Steve into a bone-crushing hug. The soldier chuckled and placed a soft kiss on Tony's forehead.
I can't even remember what happened. Did we fight or did we just collapse? Were Steve and Tony also drugged? Nobody knows.", mumbled Natasha as she held her head with her right hand. She was exhausted.
"I know you have tons of questions but please just let me explain it.", mumbled he and Tony nodded slowly at the instruction.
He quickly closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
"Guys I know you are all upset, believe me, I am too. But right now is our top priority to find Tony.", said Natasha and tried to sound as calm as she could.
"You should take a break, Tony. You didn't sleep for days.", the assassin sounded worried but Tony didn't care. He just wanted to know, why Steve spent days on a mission and didn't bother to contact him. He missed his strong arms that kept his body safe after a nightmare. Missed the soft lips that would crush against his own and would trail kisses all over his body. He missed Steve's pancakes with lots of bacon in the morning.
He typed it in and hoped that it would begin to ring.
„You are going to hell for this! This isn't true love! You are kidnapping your own husband!", Steve frowned at the statement. How could someone so unimportant just tell if it was true love or not?! He loved Tony and Tony loved him!
He tried to remember anything from his wedding but it seemed like that there was a giant hole in his memories.
"Yeah, I know. In the kitchen are two different bottles of knockout drops. You have to put 3 drops of chloral hydrate in the glass of every normal guest, including Nat, Clint, Bruce, Fury,
Hell yes, it would be bad. His father fought this organization so why the fuck would he join them.
We have absolutely no clue, where Tony and Steve are, Tony got kidnapped by his own husband, he probably doesn't remember anything that happened and there is a possibility that they are both on a luxurious honeymoon and Tony thinks that Steve saved him. WHAT THE FUCK!", exclaimed Clint as he was the first one to speak. Bruce took a few deep breaths and tried to calm down.
"I want to show you one last place" Tony and Steve walked for another five minutes until they reached the Gapstow bridge. The water reflected the bridge, flowers, plants, and trees. Tony never saw anything more beautiful in his life. He was completely alone with the love of his life in such a beautiful, magical place. This was definitely the best day of his life.
Tony sighed at that and tried to remember Rhodey's number.
"Why would Steve drug us and shoot Fury?! That doesn't make sense!"
"I love you.", said Tony as he kissed Steve on the lips and began to eagerly touch the blondes defined abs.
"I want to see the zoo first!"
"Hey Platypus, are you and the others doing fine? Sorry for the messed up wedding, by the way.", Tony walked back and forth and waited for Rhodey's reaction.
"Thanks.", mumbled Tony as he kissed Steve's cheek sweetly and went to the bedroom to crush on the soft bed. Steve opened a window in the meantime and also laid down next to his boyfriend. Tony closed his eyes as soon as Steve told Friday to turn off the light in their room, but something still felt incredibly wrong. He rolled onto his stomach, where he desperately clenched his pillow with his fists trying to fall asleep. Then he laid on his back and stared at the ceiling for a few minutes.
"I give you an option, Tony. You can either let go and drink the serum, or you try to fight it and I well inject it right into your bloodstream. I would prefer it if you drink it. I know how much you hate needles.", fat tears ran down Tony's cheek as he realized that he had no choice. He had to take the serum, there was no scenario where he would get out of this without being mind-controlled.
"Do you have your smartphone with you?", asked the brunette and Steve blinked stupidly at him.
Besides Pierce, Rumlow, and Sitwell.
The soldier sighed and put the glass bottle away. Tony tried his best to finally get the cuffs off him, but didn't really have the power to slip out of them.
He couldn't have been happier at that moment.
"James Rhodes, here.", Tony could have jumped of joy.
"What's going on?", asked Tony he knew that the situation was a catastrophe, but he wasn't scared. Why wasn't he scared?!
He opened his eyes again and saw that he was in a giant dimmed room.
Tony instantly ran outside and went into one of the other holiday huts, where he hacked, himself into Steves's phone.
"Hail Hydra.", whispered Tony before he fell unconsciously into Steve's open arms. The soldier smiled happily before he carefully laid Tony down on the floor.
"How are you feeling?", asked Steve as he pressed their foreheads in a lovely gesture together.
"Tony can you describe how you feel exactly besides funny?", asked the super-soldier as he looked at his husband's dilated pupils.
”I know that the world changed. But why the fuck didn't you start your plan of world domination earlier?", Tony could see how a big smirk formed on Steve's lips.
The film got projected on the wall and it seemed to begin where the guests all came in.
"No, believe me. They are too busy doing stuff. I just hope that there are no problems in their relationship. Steve seems so distant.", said Clint as he took a long sip of his coke.
He decided to go with the black one, Tony would probably use midnight blue. He heard that the door opened up and saw Natasha and Rumlow which were both ready for the ceremony. Nat wore a red off-shoulder dress and Rumlow a classic grey tuxedo.
"S-Steve? What happened? I don't remember anything. Where are we? Did we get married? Why is my head hurting so much?", asked Tony in a rush before Steve put his index finger against his lips.
"He should come back tomorrow. You know how he is. It's going to be alright, it's just a longer mission.", Nat kissed his cheek and placed a bowl of fruit salad and the water bottle on Tony's desk. Tony collapsed to the floor as soon as Nat left. He was touch starved, tired, hungry and needed a shower, he was a complete mess. He hugged his arms protectively over his own chest and let the tears stream down his cheeks. The door to his workshop opened once again, but he didn't even bother to look up. He just continued to sob into his hoodie and tried to hide his face into the soft fabric.
Warning for Non-Consensual drug use
"I love you and I'll do anything to make you feel better my love.", Tony snuggled himself into Steve’s warm chest and slowly dozed off.
The brunette hummed happily and threw his arms around Steves's neck to deepen the kiss.
"Steve wants the serum for Tony"
They watched the part where Steve forced Tony to say Hail Hydra and how Tony fell unconsciously into Steves's arms. That was the last scene before the projection went black.
“Think you’re gonna be able to use that thing without popping a boner?” He asked, flopping down on the bed.
“Fuck, Cap!” Tony cried out as he came, some of his cum hitting the blanket but most of it getting on the shield. Steve would tell him to lick it up if he didn’t know all the places the shield had been. Sure it got clean but still, Steve was only willing to go so far in terms of ignoring sanitary issues.
“Okay if you even think about wearing that mess of a suit S.H.I.E.L.D. made for you I will not hesitate to dump you,” Tony informed Steve a few days after they had spent some time negotiating what they wanted their role play scene to be like. Tony had issues and admitted that a lot of his old fantasies had Steve degrading him and sometimes worse. Steve said he was willing to do some light degrading if that’s what Tony wanted but he wasn’t comfortable with anything more than that.
The first suit had Steve visibly straining to get free, but he did it in less than a minute. Luckily, Tony had made multiple suits, all in the signature colours. In fact, they didn’t look different to his usual suit.
Rhodey just had to comment on how hilarious it was that Tony was dating his celebrity crush.
“Fuck,” Steve moaned under his breath as he gripped his cock and began to jerk himself off as he watched Tony hump the blanket. Every so often the top of his cock would touch the cold metal and he’d gasp at the sensation. Steve could see his shield slowly getting covered in precum and that was a sight he’d never thought he’d see.
Both looked at him with confused looks on their faces, and Bucky said, "You mean the princess?"
"I don't know. One of the space gossips he knows, apparently."
She turned on him accusingly. "You said I'm not s'pposed t' touch that stuff! You said, 'Those aren't toys for you t' play with, Olivia.'"
"What? Handle what happening? How bad is it really?"
Tony sat there a moment, frowning, and the sultry, peppy standard coming from the bandstand finally wafted through the dour fog of the last several minutes. "Well," he finally said as he watched the couples swaying — couples like Thor and Jane and Pepper and Happy and what even looked like Bruce and Natasha. "This just sucked up the night."
"I do say so. Please don't kiss me!" he said as Steve brought his mouth down toward his. "I just threw up, and my mouth tastes gross, and—"
"Whoa, Stark!" Barton said as the Iron Man armor clomped up the gate. "Uh…Cap know what you're doing?"
"Merry Christmas, baby girl. I see Iron Cap is still in one piece," he said as he lifted her from her crib, the stuffed toy clutched tight in her left arm. Steve peered closer and saw it looked to be two separate toys somehow joined by their…arms? Hands? Were they supposed to be people or weird Disney-like creatures? One did bear a slight resemblance to what a toy Captain America might look like. Well, if he'd been drawn by Walt Disney, anyway.
But lying to himself was much, much tougher. He wouldn't say he was dwelling on thoughts of her, but he did think about her. He'd even kept one of the pictures she'd drawn — the one that was supposed to be of the two of them cuddling on the couch and watching that Avengers cartoon she was seemingly obsessed with. He'd burned all the others, unable to accept that they'd ever even existed; but this one… This one he kept, tucked safely into his desk, a reminder of a moment when he hadn't been just a one-time Merchant of Death trying to repent his sins but a dad that was loved and adored and wrapped around the pinky finger of a precocious little girl that he knew would one day have the entire world at her feet.
"Huh," Tony said. He scooped out some gelato and stuck it in his mouth, and after swallowing down the chocolaty goodness, he turned to Steve and said, "They went to the beach."
Tony glanced back at Steve. "That's as ringing an endorsement as you're ever going to get from him."
"Someone that computes things?"
"No, I mean it," he murmured, his lips just brushing Tony's shoulder and his breath ghosting over his skin. "Irish food with the Irish kid."
"Language, Papa!"
Captain America. Now, there was a hero! Cap could do anything — was the greatest man ever to walk the face of the earth. Tony was no better than the layer of filth on the bottom of Cap's boot — the one he used to crush Nazi and Hydra scum with back during the war. You should be more like him, Tony. Why can't you be more like him? Why? 'Cause you're not good enough, boy.
—" he again jerked his thumb at Steve, "—could knock me up because, evidently, to her, that's like the most magical thing that you could have happen to you if you're 'bonded.'"
"Hulk's having a meltdown in the lab."
. Because he was Steve's princess, and Steve would do anything for him.
"Yeah, well, you chip a tooth on that shit and Hulk-out—"
She gave them a slow-spreading smile. "You wish the King to produce an heir to the throne. I am giving you what you desire."
"Is that supposed to be my shield?"
"You know," Steve said, casual, off-handed, as he stuck the fob in the ignition and shut his own door. "I suppose we don't
He blinked and looked up at him. "Huh?"
He kind of made a slight clutching motion with his hands as he said that — like he was squeezing that gorgeous ass right at that moment. Barnes just grimaced a little like he knew exactly what Tony was thinking about and wasn't happy the thought had been put into his head.
"Still," Steve said, his tone of voice all business, "it's something to keep in mind. If you ever do think you're at a place to join us."
"Is it me, or is he even cattier than usual?"
But here they all were, and Bruce and Natasha and Clint were in the kitchen cooking up some sort of feast, and when Steve surmised what they were up to — a sort of 'rehearsal dinner' for the happy couple — he said, "You really don't have to do this for us," but Clint just said, "Hey, you only get married for the first time once," as he tore up lettuce for a salad.
"My place in the hierarchy? Yeah, not if my husband knows what's good for him."
He exhaled a breath through his nose and considered the table Tony was lying on.
"Standing so stupidly?"
The sun was setting to the west, the Hudson a dark line separating the island from the mainland across the way. Deciding not to worry himself about their destination just yet, Tony contented himself by watching the steady stream of lights from the buildings that lined the roadway to his right. By chance, he spied a speed limit sign attached to a streetlamp and noted the posted speed of 50 MPH. He stole a glance over at the speedometer and saw the digital readout hold steady at 67. Funnily enough, he knew Steve was actually working to pace himself at that speed.
"Good thing about being head of security, former boss," he said as he maneuvered the car through traffic. "Get to make these kinds of executive decisions. Where to, boss?"
the infamous Natasha Carbonell!"
"All set," she said. "You sure you want to do this?"
"Thank you."
"You mean you want to watch me masturbate?"
"Oh, and you know me so well, huh?"
"I hate you."
"Not gonna come back — I mean, it's not going to come back as anything we don't want to see," he said, setting the parameters.
Steve laughed and glanced around for a tablet or some electronic device. "Oh, come on, Tony. That was pretty neat to see in 1939! It could move. It could talk. It could even smoke."
"Yeah, but it was a really neat gimmick," he said and went to take Tony's tablet, seeing no other alternative.
"Will you still love me? I mean, when I'm still in this form even after… You'll still be attracted to me, right?"
Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "Are you surprised by that? Really?"
"What's wrong, sugar doll?"
"Well, it probably would be a good idea. To make sure everything is progressing normally—" Bruce started to say, but Tony whined and pushed his head back into the throw pillow.
"Now you're just being gross," Barton said.
Steve stopped beside him as Tony fastened small bracelets to each wrist. "What are you doing?"
Tony groaned. "Babe, believe me, you didn't take advantage of me. I wanted it just as much as you. Clearly we were idiots about the whole thing, but we've been known not to be able to think straight around each other from time to time — no pun intended. It is what it is, and we can't go back and change time, as far as I know, so we have to figure out some way of dealing with this."
Steve didn't answer him, and Tony about jumped out of his skin when he heard the unmistakable sound of a tree branch snapping beneath a foot on the other side of the road. He stopped to turn, but Steve said, "
Wilson scoffed, and Barnes looked at him and said, "Well, that's no fun."
"Oh, don't be like that, Tony," Bruce said, not taking his eyes off the screen. "Deep down in that shriveled heart of yours, you know you enjoy it."
"Oh! There you are. I was wondering where you disappeared to."
Tony cringed as Pepper's irate voice came over the line. He slumped back into the bed sheets and pressed the heel of one palm into his eye socket while the other held his phone away from his ear lest Pepper's voice shatter his eardrum.
"Huh. OK, well, why don't you—"
"Well, at least there's that," Steve said, and Tony pointed a firm finger at the chair. "What? What's that for?"
have to beg you to do, it's fondle my breasts. Just be careful you don't start them leaking again."
the same as, oh, the same kind of magic you kind of rope in with bullshit superstition like dropped knives and throwing salt over your shoulder and knocking on wood and not stepping on cracks and—"
"Uh…yeah, sure," he said. "Not actually sure when that honeymoon's going to be, but OK, we can talk after that."
"You two have the worst eating habits I've ever seen in adult males."
Steve just folded his arms and leveled him with his patented Stare of Disapproval while Tony scooped up another helping of gelato.
He leaned up against him to read over his shoulder. "I like the way it looks on me. Makes me feel kind of, I don't know,
He thought about this a moment then added, "I really think Steve could pull off that kind of beard."
you're perfect—"
look like a Natasha. What are you? An 'Anthony'?"
be Antonia, I don't. I love
"I don't want you going out there looking like you got something
"Husband."
"They're in
She fell asleep before Ursula had even taken Ariel's voice.
"Yeah, I thought about it," he replied because, honestly, he had.
, huh?"
"Actually, yes," Steve said just as Tony snorted a laugh and said, "No."
Tony twitched his mouth, trying to keep himself from smiling. "Yeah," he said, thinking back to the way the other Steve Rogers had run soothing fingertips against the nape of his neck, "I guess you could say that."
"Five minutes," he said, and understanding what Tony was demanding of him, he jumped up from his seat and said, "I'll be out in two."
growing it inside you, now do I?"
it. Was it a stupid way of doing it? Yeah, probably. Pepper wasn't too happy with me. But…"
"Hmm?"
"Uh…" He scratched at his beard with his right hand. "I probably left it down in the workshop."
"Yeah, well, you'd be surprised," he said as the woman handed the box to the man. He took it and then motioned to her and said, "This is my wife, Tracy. Trace, this is, ah—"
"Who told him?"
"No. Nuh uh. Steve's not dead." He turned back to them. "You'd better get in contact with that asshole Barton and
"I told you," she said in that accented voice of hers, now pouring herself a cup of the mead she had offered to her guests, "I know everything. I know you distrust the Chancellor but you are wise enough to know that if anything
The chamomile did help, even if he was never really one for tea, and even if the Spy Twins intercepted him every time he so much as thought about getting to the coffeemaker. But it did help soothe his nerves just the slightest, and after getting worked up down in the lab over…his test results, which Bruce made worse by insisting on blood and urine to analyze as well…it made it easier to hunker down on the couch and slip off into dreamland, his head pillowed on Natasha's thigh as she ran calming fingers through his hair.
Steve just shrugged, gaze focused on the road ahead. "I mean, I guess it's a decent start."
Tony continued to stand awkwardly on the side of the road, and he folded his arms and kicked at the gravel and dug the toe of his sneaker into the dirt as he waited for Steve to…whatever. Take Barnes's hand and run off into the sunset together. Probably something like that, right? That's how these reunions always ended, didn't they? Yeah, sure, he was happy for Steve, he guessed.
"What?"
Tony shook his head. "No need. I believe you. Now, go out there and reminisce about all the good old days."
Steve frowned and glanced around, and he said, "Looks like it," while Thor suddenly realized that the Iron Man armor was standing there awaiting orders. He turned to Steve and said, "Did you unground our Man of Iron, Steven?"
I was dying."
"Tony," Bruce said, almost pleadingly, "just tell Thor what exactly happened."
in the fuck had be been thinking while he was pregnant? — and Steve sitting on the couch to sketch the hours away. It was a setup they had undertaken several times in the past, only now in addition to the two of them, there was a little brown-eyed infant girl carefully tucked into the couch cushion next to Steve, arms and legs spread like a little starfish, pacifier in her mouth, and eyes closed as she slumbered peacefully in the presence of her parents. As Tony tried to salvage what he could from his projects, Steve kept his concentration on the sketchbook on his lap, glancing over to the baby sleeping beside him every now and then to make sure she was still safe and happy and peaceful.
," Steve said. "
"I just mean he's a sanctimonious pain the ass. Like, he always thinks he's right about things, and he always thinks his way is the right way, and he's always walking around with that stupid hair of his and those stupid perfect teeth of his and, I don't know, would it kill the guy
"War Machine
“Yeah,” Stark said, but some of the fight had gone out of his voice only to be replaced by something that hinted at a little shakiness and strain, “like I said: Not a team-player.”
He rolled his eyes and picked up half of the sliced sandwich and bit into it, moaning as the flavors hit his taste receptors. God, what a fucking good sandwich! Maybe not the best he'd ever had, but certainly top five if not top three. Maybe he was just that hungry — sort of in the way those first burgers he'd eaten after returning from Afghanistan had been the most delectable things he'd ever eaten — but damn, if he wasn't already married, he'd seriously consider marrying this sandwich. At least the sandwich wouldn't rather spend time with the other rolls it had been baked with.
"Wouldn't ask you to if I wasn't."
In fairness, she had asked him if he'd wanted white, wheat, or multigrain bread.
So, as it turned out, maybe Steve wasn't as disgusted by his female form as he'd thought—
He swallowed. "Look, uh," he said, his voice unsure in his own throat, "I don't… I don't know…"
Steve was still busying himself reading articles, which— Fine. Whatever. Steve could give him the condensed version of what he'd discovered. He supposed he had to count himself lucky on that front. On one of the rare,
And somehow, he knew it was the god's honest truth.
"That Steve's?" he asked and pointed a finger at Tony's swollen abdomen. Tony just smirked and soldered a couple more wires together, kind of thankful that Barnes had gotten distracted from his failing attempt to explain how he felt about himself.
Tony just sat at his computer and stared at the screen, letting the light from the monitor burn into his retinas as he thought, once again, about the very last time he ever saw his parents alive, and he got lost in the swirl of colors that blended together as his eyes relaxed until he felt a pressure on his shoulder. He gasped and jumped, pulled away from that fateful Christmas of so long ago, and he turned to see Barnes standing beside him, his flesh-and-bone hand on his shoulder, those cloudy, blue eyes looking down at him, and Tony saw the ghosts of the past swirling in his haunted irises.
"If it's a fake, it's a good one," Bruce said. "The card stock on the picture, the way the edges are worn on the folder, even the way it's yellowed — if someone took you for a ride, they definitely put a lot of time and effort into it."
on this."
," Steve murmured.
milk. I know exactly where it's been. Six months from now, breast milk is probably going to be the next free-trade organic-crap fad."
"Well, not exactly. It— It's a little complicated," Steve said and slid his arms down and around Tony's waist, resting firm, possessive hands on Tony's belly and nuzzling into his neck. If he didn't know any better, he'd say Steve was showing off his best fella to his oldest pal.
Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times as he stared at her then said, "Whatever," and got up. "I'm tired. I'm going to bed. You people are disgusting. And rude. For keeping me away from my
"And you're not concerned that this guy and his wife are going to use this against you in some way?" Bruce asked, not in an accusatory manner but with genuine concern.
"No," Tony said. "Just felt funny."
"Don't look at me. I didn't figure out the calendar."
Tony snorted a laugh. "Yeah, laugh it up, Brooklyn Boy. I'm surprised you're not still shocked at the fact that there's a whole world out there beyond the East River."
"Mmm hmm. It's stupid, but that's literally the thing that goes through my mind whenever you do that. I don't know if it's because you seem to have
God, that should not have thrilled him as much as it did, that should not have delighted him in any way, that should not have made his walls ache with the want to be abused just one more time that night. It was possessive and domineering, and he'd bet that Steve probably didn't even remember saying it, but Tony did, and Tony…
"What do you mean?" Tony asked and finally took a bite of salad. At least it was dressed with a vinaigrette so it wasn't
They were saved from any more talk by the waitress setting down their heaping breakfast platters, the clatter of the plates against the tabletop snapping them both out of whatever trance they'd been in, and she topped off their coffees yet again before she moved over to a group of tipsy college students that had taken seats at the counter.
He was sorta, kinda horny.
"No, shit. Why would I lie about something like this?"
Steve swallowed. "Turn back into a fella? Maybe you were supposed to stay a—"
He exhaled a heavy breath and sat back in his chair, and he tried not to think about how the last time he'd sat in that chair, a little firecracker had tugged on his hand and begged him for waffles. Or how two days ago the only long-term relationship he'd ever let himself fall into had blown up in his face. He tried not to think about anything.
"You know how Steve'll keep going until he passes out from blood loss," Natasha said, giving Steve what Tony could only interpret as her 'you're an idiot' face.
, red— and wet and stained with precome. And you could lay me out—
Steve left what had once upon a time been his separate quarters and went over to the elevator, the doors opening the moment he came within reach of it. He didn't have to breathe a word of his request, JARVIS immediately taking him back up to the penthouse.
Actually, she didn't seem all that traumatized.
"She thought you were gay?"
—" He stopped talking and shook his head. "I know it was Hydra. I know it was Hydra that brainwashed him and turned him into a mindless assassin. You're right. I can't hold that against him any more than I can hold what Barton did while he was Loki's pawn against him. I don't know if the international community will see it the same way that I do, but I'm willing to… You don't have to do it alone. You don't have to bring him back from the brink alone. It doesn't have to all be on your shoulders. You think you failed him the first time? Fine. I can't stop you from believing that. But you don't have to do it alone now. It doesn't only have to be you helping him now. And I honestly get the feeling that Nat knows him more than she's letting on."
"Someone tell you?"
Magazine's Cutest Avenger Couple."
Steve shrugged. "Your guess is as good as mine," he said. He supposed he could afford to spend one day here.
"Really? Because that's what it sounds like to me. Look, honey, I get that during the war it looked like the easier road, but nowadays? Doesn't really matter. Like I said, Supreme Court ruled on it. It's legal nationwide. I don't just mean sodomy, I mean marriage period. Two men, two women, man-and-woman — doesn't matter. Wouldn't your pal just want you to be happy no matter who it was with?"
see a slight resemblance. Slight. OK, except for the blonde hair, she was pretty much the spitting-image of him when he was that age — well, in the face, anyway — and he grimaced and reached down and gently pulled her arms away from him and said, "Yeah, this isn't happening."
when it happened."
Tony stared at him a moment longer then said, "I'm not sure I want to name my child after you any longer."
Pepper just glared at Tony, and Tony winced a little from the look he saw in her eyes. No, not the anger.
Steve just stared at him disappointedly a moment. He directed a quick glance to the baby nursing at his breast before he met Tony's eyes again, and Tony suddenly understood Steve's issue with the 'language.'
"Haven't tested it yet, but oh, I'm going to."
"Prisoner in my own goddamned Tower? Yeah, Steve, I am. Whatever. It's not like I can do anything about it. I should just take the word 'choice' and the entire meaning of it out of my vocabulary. Would save me a lot of trouble in the long run."
Barnes was quiet a moment then said, "Why do you care so much? Why are you so…?"
"Yeah? That is a
Steve cleared his throat so obnoxiously, Tony was certain he almost burst a blood vessel. "You OK back there, old man?"
That seemed to be more than enough explanation for Steve. "Oh," he said after a pause and looked down at the baby in his arms. "Oh, then he probably—" He looked up at Tony. "Did you ever explain it to him — what had happened or what was going on with you?"
"Pepper has an ulcer?" Steve asked, pausing his polishing as genuine concern leeched into his voice.
"So…you'd want me to have…both sets?"
"Don't mention it," she said with a blasé shrug, but there was a quirk of a smile to her lips, and Tony smiled a little in return and reached out to nudge her a little in solidarity and camaraderie.
"You and me both, sweet potato. Hungry?"
appearance. Well, he was going to have to get used to it. He wasn't about to make a 'Howard' of himself. His kid would know he was loved and wanted. His kid wouldn't be wracked with guilt for damn near decades because he'd never said 'goodbye.' His kid was going to be so loved and wanted he'd be smothered by affection, which…yeah, OK, maybe wasn't the best option either. But the point was his kid would be loved and know he was loved, and that's what mattered.
"That's not—" Steve said then shook his head, not looking away from the folder.
"Yeah, it is," Wilson agreed with a nod.
the tragedy in that story."
He didn't see anything to put the balled-up papers in, so he gathered them into as compact a pile as he could, and it was as he was moving Olivia's scattered toys into a neat and orderly arrangement beneath the tree when the first familiar song of the day began to play.
"She's younger, I guess. Olivia called her a 'baby.'" He sighed. "Then again, Olivia wasn't confused at all to see me…" He shook his head. "Whatever. Doesn't mean anything. Doesn't matter. Not our life, so who cares?"
, sweetie, tell me."
Steve shrugged, Tony holding onto one arm, Olivia secure in his other, and led them down the street toward what Tony said was the center of town.
He could have fought her. He wanted to fight her. He didn't.
"You know, if you want, I could take care of that half-mast you've got going on in your pants."
"Doesn't matter," he said with a shake of the head. "She's listening to everything we're saying."
She let herself out of the room, and Steve stood beside him and folded his arms and said, "Was it that bad?"
proxy marriages aren't allowed in New York." He glanced up again. "Great, so the kid's going to be born a bastard."
"Well, we got a Jolly Green Giant that's not very 'jolly'—"
Bruce snorted a laugh. "You don't care?"
He sat there, blinking, holding his daughter in the air, fuses completely blown by what had just happened, and through the muddled comprehension going on in his brain at the moment, he heard Steve say a quiet, "Oh, dear," and set his flatware down to reach his hands out to the baby, who seemed no worse for the wear by what she'd just done, smacking her small mouth and looking over at Steve.
"No such thing as it," Tony said and shook his head at the bacon proffered by Thor. Thor shrugged and snatched up the remaining slices. "Made-up bullshit to sell romance novels and romcoms."
Tony and the Spy Twins turned to see Steve, already dressed and ready to depart, strolling into the lab. Concentration was etched over his face as he set his gaze on Tony and said, "Tony, we—"
"Yeah."
His parents. His fucking
"I mean I don't—" Barnes said quickly. "I don't— Maybe not right
"Yeah? Well, Daddy's not here," he said, surprising himself by how easily the term rolled off his tongue.
"Yeah, but this year, I actually called up the mayor's office and asked them to make it extra nice for you."
"Buck, you're not a—"
"Pretty sure it was to have them deleted from the earth," he muttered.
"We're
"Hey," Steve said, and he pulled away from Tony and took a firm hold of Tony's chin in his hand. Steve met his gaze, and then with pursed lips and fire in his eyes said, "Fuck Howard. He was a pathetic excuse for a father, and I ever get the chance to see that son-of-a-bitch again, I'll deck him into next Tuesday."
"So, here I am, forced to carry a pregnancy to term, which is…so absolutely frightening you have no idea.
Tony thought about this a moment then said, "Send him a message. Tell him to bring me home something good."
"Anyone that's ever had to talk to you after you've had an entire pot of it?"
He groaned and rolled his eyes. "Fucking moochers," he muttered then glanced back at the fridge, remembering why he'd even left his seat to begin with — the one Thor had currently settled his regal ass into. "Hey, any of you know why there's a blue sticky on the fridge?"
The doors slid closed, and Tony exhaled a breath and squeezed his eyes shut at the resurgent ache in his back and whispered a quiet and pathetic, "
"You were saying?"
"Yeah, but you
Bruce stared at him a moment, and Tony got the sense he was already overtired and overworked but was fighting through it because it was his job to do it. "Look, I'm going to wager that you're not really that far along just yet and we have time to worry about that sort of thing. So,
Tony took more care eating his meal than Steve did, taking smaller, more considered bites as he focused his attention on his phone. At one point, he sat there with a forkful of eggs, sausage, and hash brown halfway to his mouth as he tapped the screen to check something over. Steve didn't know what possessed him to do it, but he reached over and guided the fork the remaining distance to Tony's mouth, and Tony took the bite without thinking before he turned to Steve and gave him a curious look. Steve went a little bashful, pulling his hand from Tony's to go back to his own plate, and they ate in silence a few more moments before Tony said, "You know, I've only had one other person do that for me."
go to it."
"Then you shouldn't mind if I allude to the fact that it's possible that that child is—"
Steve got that sour look on his face like he knew Pepper was right but he just didn't want to admit it, and Tony turned to Steve and, swizzle stick to his lips, said, "So, did you have fun with Helen?"
Tony blinked, his doe-eyes somehow even more pronounced beneath the sweep of finely-shaped dark eyebrows, and he shook his head ever so slightly and said, "I don't..."
Natasha, weirdly, stayed very quiet and kept her gaze averted, but Tony noticed something a little Mona Lisa-ish about the tiny smile on her face.
"Steve? Stop it. I know what I'm doing, and I know that this…is going to come back with exactly the readings we want."
"OK, I might have deserved that one."
having a press conference to do this," he said and went back to scrolling through his tablet.
Barton almost earned himself demerits for that, Steve being none too pleased with the tag and assuming Barton's was teasing him about the #LadyLiberty thing. Which it totally was, Tony was pretty sure, because it was so fucking
Steve didn't wait to see what happened next. He turned his head away and closed his eyes, and he twitched at the high 'snickt' sound the clippers made as Tony trimmed the nail.
"No, just..." He inhaled a breath through his nose. "Wanted to come back up here with you guys."
He choked out a watery laugh. "Thought I was back to being 'Tony'?"
"What? You think I'm trying to pull a fast-one on you over 'White Christmas'? It's the truth."
"Rhodey," he croaked out in a sleep-tired voice.
Steve turned but had no time to process anything before Tony was on him, arms around him, mouth on his, kissing him desperately like Steve was the only way he could breathe. Steve stumbled backwards a step or two before he caught himself, and he put gentle arms around Tony and kissed back a moment before Tony pulled away, murmuring a choked, “I love you,” to him.
"Or you could just give me your phone."
Barnes nodded slightly and let himself be led away, and Tony frowned as he watched them go, wondering what he'd said to make Barnes close in on himself like that. Was it the question about what more he wanted? He'd only meant it as a joke.
"I didn't say a word," he replied, and honestly, he hadn't. Clearly this was something they'd come up with completely on their own, though whether it was before or after yesterday's conversation was anyone's guess. If it was after, Steve could only marvel at the turnaround on getting that apparel in time for Christmas morning.
Steve stood there and nodded before he reached out and snagged a gentle hold of Tony's left hand. Tony let him, and he brought the hand up to his lips and kissed the diamond and sapphire ring that sat on his finger. "How 'bout 'Natalie,' then?" he said, going past Tony's lament about his lack of choice and pulling the hand away from his mouth. "It's feminine, right? No one calls Nat that. Or how 'bout even 'Antonia'?"
"Tradition," Barton said.
Tony's laughs finally died down to an amused chuckle, and his eyes lit up in lust and delight. "Yeah, you do. Fuck, the things I know about Captain America that no one else would believe."
like—"
. Yeah, no, I've heard your singing voice."
Steve just opened his eyes and looked down at the baby feeding in his arms and said, "No, I won't."
Tony swallowed. He didn't want to say it, he didn't want to mean it, but it seemed there was no other alternative. Not now. Not anymore. Not after all this.
"What? Making myself look good?" he asked as he capped the lipstick. "Honestly, these stringently-delineated gender roles society forces on us are such a fucking pain in the ass. I actually
Tony expected the waterworks from his rather snappish tone, but instead all he got was a sour look and acquiescence to his demands.
but nowhere near as well as you. And you heard that cosmic screwball. We're bondmates — or 'soul mates.' And that means I need you just as much as you need me."
"Yeah, I doubt that."
Tony grinned and turned to his bedside table. "Funny you should mention that. I was just reading about what we could do to speed up the process."
Tony glanced up. "You want to take Barnes back to the city with us."
"See what I mean?"
"I could read a book."
Who, thanks to the class, he didn't see from Friday night until Sunday night, at which time it was probably going for eight o'clock that evening when Tony's band of wayward miscreants started finding their way into the penthouse, all of them looking kind of sluggish, their color varying degrees of 'tan' and 'red.' Tony watched as they shuffled around in search of food, and he stuck a spoonful of gelato in his mouth and let the flavor melt over his tongue before he said, "What the hell happened to all of you?"
"What? No! Are you kidding? Embarrass the shit out of the guy! He's never had anyone to make a big deal over him like this before. He deserves it. You're good—"
"Who the hell is Vision?" Tony cried, unable to help himself because, seriously, did this kid just literally appear out of nowhere?
Steve rubbed his back once more, and Tony sighed heavily and rolled his eyes once more but followed over to the room.
Steve just nodded and continued watching the film, and by the end, he found himself itching to pull Tony and Olivia into his arms and never, ever let them go because he…understood. He
. Papa's always callin' him th' old man. You know that, Unca Bruce."
"Yeah, well, on the off-chance I'm not there to catch you," he replied and flew Steve over the burning ashes of the former Hydra compound and dropped him down in a more wooded area. "J, do a scan for life signs," he said and stood beside Steve. "Focus in on anyone with artificial improvements. Arms, legs, whatever." He directed his attention to Steve and said, "Barton, Thor, and Wilson will take care of the remaining Hydra goons. I'll give them cover if I need to, but other than that, I'm all yours."
like he was supposed to be fucking able to read what Bruce was thinking. How the hell was he supposed to know what Bruce was thinking about? The only one he was ever able to read like that was Steve.
"Yeah."
"All bondeds do, Captain. You are no different than any of them."
She handed the clipboard over, and Tony looked at the white sheets of paper and frowned. Shit. He didn't know the answers to this stuff. That's what he had Pepper and Steve for.
"Uh, why?" Tony asked, not sure where this line of questioning was leading.
"No, babe, I will—"
"Damn right you don't have to worry. You know you're stuck with me forever, right?"
Never! You must be thinking of some other Steve Rogers."
Granted not
Steve nodded, hands splayed out over Tony's back, fingers toying with the satin straps of the negligée. "Yeah. Even like this. Hell, I kinda consider myself the luckiest son-of-a-bitch in the world."
"Bad enough," Barton said. "I'm outta here before I lose my lunch, too."
"Hmm…well, as I understand it, there is a suite upstairs with our names on it. Well, a fake name on it."
"Huh, Papa?"
"Well?"
"Steve."
, 'cuz you wanted to tattle on him about sayin' that word in front of me, but then you'd hafta tell Daddy that you got your ring caught, and then you'd get in trouble 'cuz Daddy says you shouldn't be wearin' it when you work on stuff."
She filled his cup back up then went on her way, and Tony said, "That was terribly rude."
Steve quirked his eyebrow like he very much wanted to hear Tony's explanation, and Tony sighed a little and sat away from Steve, dropping his hand as he did so.
"It's bigger than a straw," Bruce said like Tony was exaggerating or something. "And it stretches."
He reached up to brush at the corners of his eyes and hoped no one saw, but he saw several confused sets of eyes glancing at each other and a few concerned ones stare right at him. He shook his head and waved off their concern and said, "So, what do I do then?"
about it."
Barton nodded like Steve had once again proven his point. "Girl."
get the cravings.
Steve could only shake his head, still evidently of the belief that Tony was flat-out lying to him about how painful nursing was.
And then, from his other side, Natasha's hand slid over his abdomen, pushing Steve's hand out of the way as she tried to feel the movement as well.
Tony grinned and made his way over to him. "Genius. Billionaire. Playboy. Philanthropist. Any of that ring a bell? I was perfectly content living a lonely, shallow existence with everything I could ever want and no one to share it with me until you came along. Now, look at me. I'm fucking Mr. Mom. I mean I
"No," Steve said, brushing his lips against Tony's shoulder.
He took the garment in hand and pursed his lips at her. "I think you're having a little
"Hmm?" he asked. "Use them to remind myself of your cold and utter betrayal."
The doors slid open, and Tony sucked in a deep breath and staggered on, grabbing onto the handrail and curling metal fingers over it, squeezing it to work as a countermeasure to the pain slicing through him. He blew out the breath and wondered how easy it was to tear whatever it was that Bruce had stitched up then said an uncomfortable, "Good. Now that you remember who you work for, give me the rundown."
"Expect? No. Hope? I told you, I'm a sucker, and fuck everyone else,
Steve shrugged then took another sip and snuggled up against Tony, pulling the blanket with him.
He nodded and settled in, the duvet soft and warm and familiar around him, Steve's comforting scent permeating the swath. He ached, but the icepack felt good, and after the excitement of the last twenty-four or so hours, sleep, which he'd been robbed of for so long, finally began to overtake him, his body relaxing and his eyes drooping.
Yep, definitely a mistake to turn back.
"I know," Tony said and relaxed his legs. "I know, I just— It was real. It felt so
"No one has to say anything. It's pretty obvious. I'm the life you're stuck with. I'm the person you're stuck with because the one you wanted — the people you wanted — were all taken from you, and now you've got to make do with what you've got. Which clearly isn't worth shit based on the fact of how easily you can walk away from me."
"Yeah, but you're not telling it to your
Tony just grinned, and Steve shook his head and grabbed for an egg roll.
"You never had a chance after that."
Tony reached up and put his hand over Steve's mouth to quiet him. "My god, Steve! You'd swear you'd never seen me masturbate before."
"It's OK," Steve said and put firm, solid hands on either of Tony's bare shoulders. "It's OK. It's probably—" He stopped short and considered something. "Wait, I read about this somewhere. What did you say it was? What it felt like, I mean?"
"—babies and young children pick up on language very easily—"
JARVIS was silent a moment before he said, "
But Tony just looked up at her and said, "The shoes, again? Really?"
"I don't do that," he muttered. "JARVIS does."
"You're deflecting, old man," Tony said and turned to kiss his cheek again.
Tony shrugged. "I don't know, J," he replied. "She is Steve's kid, and you know what kind of a glutton he is about that sort of thing."
It was the Battle of New York that had cast his one-time hero in a new light, and maybe he really was as valiant and inspiring as the propaganda — and Howard — had made him out to be. They'd parted the battle as comrades, and when Steve had come to live in the tower with the rest of the misfits, they'd forged a fragile friendship that became something more and something deeper as they bonded over their shared lots in life: mainly, having been heavily influenced by Howard Stark and having been cast into very public roles that neither one truly desired.
He yawned and rubbed his belly a little more. "What are you doing?"
bit — Natasha was still a gorgeous, red-headed enigma even after that), and they talked about the general goings-on of the world, and as they stood at the street corner and waited for the traffic to clear, the sun catching on Natasha's red hair and making it glisten like polished copper, Tony realized how truly lucky he was to have her — to have all the Avengers — in his life. Natasha was not spending this day out with him to humor him or because he'd promised her something in return. She was there because she wanted to be there. She was there because she was having fun, too.
Yeah, now that he thought about it, he kind of remembered Thor standing pretty near to him as he'd stared back at Bruce, completely stuck for anything to say other than, "
Tony sighed and hung his head a moment. "OK, look, Steve?" He looked back up at him. "I know you're all about the whole self-sacrificing, taking responsibility for everyone kind-of-a- thing, but honestly, this is one situation where I could really do without your self-pity. Yeah, you feel like shit for this. Yeah, you blame yourself for it. Fucking fantastic. But guess what? All that blame isn't going to mean shit for figuring out a way to put this right. So, feel like shit. Blame yourself. Go for it. But I fucking need you to be in my corner with this. I'm terrified, Steve. I'm fucking terrified here. Banner's telling me my body can't handle it, and Thor's telling me this is part of some spell put on me by a nutjob that thinks you and I are 'soulmates' and need a baby to complete us like some thirteen-year-old's first fanfic. I don't want to admit it, but I can feel my body changing, and it's scaring the hell out of me. This is not supposed to happen. This is supposed to be biologically impossible. And yet here we are, and I'm fucking pregnant, Steve, and there is no way to fix it that does not involve some sort of high risk."
And then he was up and off the bed — climbing
"It's a bag to carry a bunch of crap in," Rhodey said, nonplussed by their responses. "By the way, photographer? Your seven o'clock."
He looked up at Tony from where he sat in the rocking chair.
, so I can't really wear it anymore. Anyway, I asked him
"Not by choice!"
"To a degree, yes."
"Steven."
No, it wasn't because he was depressed. It was because this was scary and this was so far from anything he'd ever wanted that he wasn't sure there were actual words for him to deal with it. There
"Yeah,
Steve went a little flushed at that. "Sorry," he said, "just…"
—" he nodded down at himself, "—to what—"
He wasn't actually sure if Tony trailed off or if that was the end of his thought. He just watched as Tony moved about the bathroom, hanging the cloth up to dry, grabbing Steve's old, wet clothes and tossing them into the clothes hamper. Steve, dry now, grabbed his clothes off the sink and stepped into them, and though he logically knew he was embarrassed by what Tony had seen him doing, at the same time, he wasn't as embarrassed as he thought he should have been.
Tony nodded, finding himself a little humbled by Hill's words and the implication of what they really meant, and, under the table, he reached for Steve's hand and clasped hold of it, Steve squeezing in response before Tony even could. Evidently, Steve understood the gravity of those words as well.
Steve sighed a little and said, "Tony, I know you don't want to hear it, but you're pregnant. And neither one of us has any…experience…with that. I just… I want to make sure you're OK. I want to make sure everything's progressing as it should be. I don't need you…clocking out early."
"Not sure he wanted anything to do with it," he replied then followed Natasha's advice and went over to the steps. Natasha called out to him that she'd see him in a bit, and then she was gone, presumably to collect the other wayward Avengers that were looking forward to this event with as much enthusiasm as one would going for a root canal.
"Daddy said we could," he said quickly, which seemed to alleviate her concerns, and for the next hour, they sat and sketched out various things. Tony drew schematics for a new armor. Olivia first drew a picture of her family — and what the fuck! The Cap wasn't
at that?"
"You're going to do this to me again, aren't you?"
"Oh," Pepper said with an easy nod, and Tony didn't know what it said about their lives now that she could so easily accept that and not bat an eyelash at it.
as awful as having a hole carved into your chest in a cave in Afghanistan. I mean,
Thor shook his head and gladly took another plate of freshly burned bacon from Steve. Tony's nose twitched at the scent, his stomach doing a flip, and he swallowed the bile down and thought about getting himself some dry toast.
"A woman. I got turned into a woman."
"Give me 'til ten," he said and ducked out of the room, closing the door behind him, and Tony just stared at the door and drummed his fingers on the mattress and wondered if he should be an ass about the whole thing and intentionally fall asleep before then.
"What? Oh, god, it's not twins, is it?"
"—and I figure I better take him up on it before he realizes the mistake that he's made."
Tony then just shook his head, and he leaned over and put a hand to Steve's chest (more to steady himself than anything) and pressed a kiss to his forehead and said, "You're worrying over nothing, old man. Your oldest pal still likes you. Maybe he's just trying to give us some space, you know, 'cause we're married and should be wanting to spend every waking moment with each other."
— that 'don't you feel stupid?' look.
"What? Why?" Steve asked, but Tony just smiled at him and said, "It's a surprise."
The words didn't even faze Natasha, but Bruce frowned, his mouth puckering some like he was confused and trying to think of exactly the wording he wanted to use before he said, "Uh, he had to help you go to the bathroom?"
"I've seen you polish off a large container of pork fried rice in like ten minutes. No way in hell are you getting just that."
"Well, yeah, I gue—
He gasped as he came, hot streaks of pearly-white painting his abdomen and hand, and he opened his eyes and looked at the mess that he'd made and said a quiet, "
to be one. It cannot be both. But that's not the way you see it, now is it? You're not certain who or what you are now. Yes, you feel comfortable in your other body — your male form — but you've grown to find comfort in this one, too, haven't you? You enjoy the way your bonded looks at you and the way he touches you. The way he puts his hands on you. The way he fits inside you. You enjoy the way you look, the way you feel, the things you can do."
"I don't know. Maybe that's what it is," Barnes said. "Not that I
"Implying it? No. I'm outright stating it."
"I didn't even get to talk to you at your birthday much!" she said, sounding saddened by this but like she was trying to hide her disappointment. "How are you? Is it OK to remark about how big you've gotten?"
"You know I don't like when you throw your money around like that," he said then threw a glance over his left shoulder at the offending implement that was just closing with a gentle swing. "Actually, in this case, it might have been a good idea," he added and turned back to Tony, "but I still don't like when you throw your money around like that. On principle."
"No!" Tony said and sat up. "
"OK, well, I don't think they'll accuse you of murdering me. They'll just say I fell off the wagon and had to go to one of those treatment facilities, and as they say, while the cat is away, the mouse will play. 'Course, even though you're the cheating son-of-a-bitch, everyone will take your side of it because Tony Stark is an asshole that deserves to have his morally upright boyfriend cheat on him with a gorgeous dark-eyed mystery brunette."
"Whatever," he said then picked Olivia up out of her highchair and cradled her in his arms. He looked around for the pacifier and frowned when he saw it had somehow fallen on the floor, and he shrugged and said, "I'll find another one," then carried her out into the living room with the intention of putting her down for her morning nap upstairs.
, you're going to do that, too."
"I know you got what they call 'delusions of grandeur,'" Wilson said, but Barton just waved him off, and Thor smiled a little in what Tony was calling 'bemused perplexity.'
Yeah, it probably counted for a little something.
"Eh," Tony said with a shrug. "Probably understands more than he lets on, but we're talking the mental capacity of an eight-year-old here, not some genius Nobel prize winner."
"You won't do that," Steve said with a shake of his head, "and we both know you won't do that."
Natasha was there as well, throwing in suggestions every now and then, and Tony was standing off to the side, fiddling with his phone and seemingly not paying any attention to what was going on around him. Steve kept to the shadows so that he could watch Tony in peace — better appreciate what the past several years had done for his former lover.
He began to pull up some files on projects he'd been working on for the other Avengers. "So, I presume you heard the good news?"
"I'm seeing a distinct lack of rabbit food here," he said and began to dig into the serving dishes. Ravioli and pasta carbonara and chicken parmesan.
Tony hummed again and made to go back to kissing Steve, but Steve pulled away and said, "He's right."
of that."
"Honestly? Probably not. But like you said, that's all in the past. It doesn't matter. What matters is now, and now is you and me, and that's that."
But Tony just ignored him and leaned in closer to show him something. "I mean, it does everything. Phone calls. Texts. Internet. All the best apps. Photos. Oh, and firewalls?" He scoffed. "No match for this baby. Can break through them—" he snapped his fingers, "—like that."
He sighed and thought back to that fight. "I don't know. I stepped out of the armor. I was checking on something. She was there. I didn't know she was there. We came face-to-face. She said something about me being bonded or having a bonded or something like that. Said she'd never known one so strong. Said it was a shame 'my kind' couldn't bear that love or something like that. It didn't make sense. She said something like, '
He dropped his arms and rested his elbows on his knees. "I can't die," he muttered without fanfare.
of things — that were just a bridge too far for him, and he was much more comfortable listening to the music of the era he'd come from or stuff recorded not long after.
Rhodey stared at him a moment, glanced to an innocent-looking Tony, then shook his head a little and turned and said, "Oh, hey, what was that Bruce?" before he took the open seat between Tony and Bruce and immediately began to weigh in on whatever discussion was going on with Bruce and Barton.
He scoffed. "Whatever. The only one that's going to yell at me about it is Steve, and I won't tell him if you don't. And that goes for you, too, J!" he called.
Steve stopped the tickles but didn't release his hold on Tony's ankle. "Seriously?"
"I don't know about that," Hill said as she came back into the room, tablet in-hand. "The hospitals are down to the wire." She looked up from her tablet and met Tony's gaze. "They know we have power here. They want to know if they could transfer some of their patients here."
"I'm not having sympathy pains," he muttered, but Tony knew he was just arguing for argument's sake.
Tony just swallowed. "Steve?" he reiterated, and he met Steve's gaze and saw nothing in those beautiful blue irises but absolute anguish.
There was an egg on the stove — like someone had literally cracked an egg onto the stove — and Tony shook his head and said, "I don't want to know."
"Huh?" he asked, hand poised above the baby's head as he considered the man beside him a moment.
, they thought wrong. The King and his Chancellor were Godly men, popular and righteous. A request from the King was tantamount to a demand, and while the Church was recently finding itself in a power struggle with the King, the Church elders were not about to sign their names to the fallout that might occur if they did not heed the demand of the King. Not yet. Not over something like this. If that silly and stupid King wanted to be legally wed to his closest advisor, who just so happened to be a man, then so be it. It mattered not to them.
" Tony had said upon reading the missive. "
It was a week later — a week of being sequestered in his workshop as he ignored everything and everyone and busied himself with his myriad of projects — when the Cap and the Spy Twins arrived back from whatever godforsaken locale they'd been assigned to.
She shrugged like she didn't know and couldn't be bothered, and Tony nodded and gazed at the photograph a little more, squinting at it as he peered at the blonde, smiling sister with the oversized plastic sunglasses pushed over-top of her head. She looked familiar — they both looked familiar — in some way that he couldn't quite put his finger on. Perhaps he'd just seen this photograph somewhere before. In fact, he was sure he had. That must have been why they looked so familiar or seemed so familiar.
"I'll let you open one of the other ones," Steve said and went back to pulling out the packing material.
S.H.I.E.L.D would finally fall and he would force Tony to enjoy it.
"I think I have an idea.", said Bruce as he looked desperately at the ceiling.
Would it be bad if he wanted to stay?
"We should probably go back. It's getting dark.", murmured Tony and he closed his eyes as Steve caressed his left cheek.
"Do you Steven Grant Rogers take Anthony Edward Stark as your lawful husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part?" and he, of course, answered with a confident "I do"
Steves's anger began to disappear as he saw how Tony's eyes went unfocused and he kept blinking a few times.
„It's pretty easy, my love. You only have to say the words Hail Hydra, okay?”, Tonys' mind was foggy and he had trouble understanding the question.
Steve carefully pulled Tony's engagement ring off and slipped a new golden ring on his finger. He placed another similar ring on his own.
"So you think that they will join us for today?", asked Natasha as she jumped on the couch a huge bowl of popcorn with her.
"Relax! I am fine and Steve is sleeping what's your problem?", asked Tony and Rhodey tried to calm down a little.
Steve went into the Quinjet of the team where he put Tony down into the passenger's seat and started the jet.
Tony woke up with a low groan and with an unpleasant headache.
"Tony?!", he felt two strong arms around him and how he got pressed into someone's chest.
Tony definitely loved the zoo and he loved the penguins there even more. Steve didn't really understand why Tony loved the flightless birds so much. He liked the grizzly bear the most, he didn't even know why he just felt a connection to the animal. Tony seemed to have a connection to every single animal at the zoo. He loved the penguins, admired the snow leopards, adored the sea lions and the ruffed lemurs. Steve didn't even know that his boyfriend loved animals so much, but it made him happy to see Tony smiling. They spent 2 hours at the zoo, they then went to a restaurant on 5th Avenue and walked to Belvedere Castle and to Shakespeare Garden.
"I don't need stupid pills to fall asleep, I'm Tony Stark after all", mumbled the billionaire against his pillow and closed his eyes once again. Steve grinned at that and grabbed his boyfriend at the right shoulder to maneuver him on his back.
It‘s going down~
"Don't, the color suits you.", Tony sighed and chose to put on the clothes that Steve brought him. A simple black boxer shorts, a pair of grey sweatpants and a plain T-shirt.
”Your wish is my command, honey.”
He scrolled through the contact list but couldn't find any familiar names.
"I have to make a call, I'll be expecting you in the living room.", said Steve, he grabbed his black smartphone which he got from S.H.I.E.L.D and went to one of the many bathrooms, closing the door behind him. Steve then dialed the number of one of his colleagues.
Rhodey and Hill. You have to put 8 drops in Thor's glass. There is another bottle with benzodiazepines, you only put 3 of those drops in Tony's glass.", explained Steve and Rumlow nodded in agreement and walked into the kitchen.
"Pierce, Rumlow, Sitwell, Ward, Steve, and Tony are the only ones standing.", mumbled Bruce rather to himself as to the team.
Tony continued searching and ended up looking into Steves's bedside table.
"My father fought against Hydra. He never even looked at me, because he was so busy searching for you. What would he think of you now?", asked Tony in a whisper as he stared into Steves's eyes.
Steve couldn't wait to marry Tony. He already put on his Giorgio Armani Tuxedo which looked very traditional with the black and white. He combed and gelled his blond hair and thought if he should rather wear a midnight blue or a black tie.
Tonys' eyes widened with fear and he tried desperately to free himself.
"Hey, it's alright. We did get married. You collapsed into my arms seconds later. Maybe that's the reason why you don't remember it.", shushed Steve which made Tony feel even worse. He couldn't even remember the moment when he said Yes, I do. A loud ugly sob escaped his mouth and he cried into his husband's neck.
The billionaire began to slightly panic as he realized that even his legs were bound to the bed and the only thing he could move was his head.
"You- you actually.", Tony couldn't even form a logical sentence he stared out of the window and then back to his husband, who grinned at his excitement.
Hope you had fun reading!
moaned at the feeling. After all it was still his husband who was touching him like this.
"We spent the whole day at Central Park and did the most amazing things, holy cow I saw penguins guys! Penguins!", said Tony and began to tell them every little detail of the day.
"I am sick and tired of this shit you are pulling, Tony! You hurt yourself with this destructive behavior so I am going to do something about it. Believe me, at the end of the day you will wish that you never disobeyed me.", muttered Steve in annoyance and Tony risked to open his eyes slowly. The blonde grabbed the small bottle and Tony winced at the sight of it.
The recording continued and the scene showed how Steve put the rings on their fingers.
"That can't be true.", whispered Tony rather to himself as to Steve who sat beside his husband.
Do you have any suggestions, ideas or do you just want to scream at me?
A few silent tears ran down his cheeks, he couldn't believe that their special day was ruined by a terrorist organization.
Tonys' lip began to tremble and it didn't take another second as he began loudly sobbing and crying. Rogers instantly pulled Tony into his chest trying to calm the genius down.
GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!
"2 weeks ago", Nat nodded and started the audio recording.
”Come on, you escaped from a god damn cave. You will manage to escape from your super-soldier husband.", huffed Tony to himself as he continued to fumble with his hands.
A soft smile made his way to Steves's lips. He was so lucky to have his husband.
"That's great! Are we going to the Central Park Zoo? I'd love to see the Penguins of Madagascar!", Steve chuckled at the silly joke and cupped his face in his hands. Looking into Tony's warm, trusting eyes. He hated the thought that his eyes could be full of fear and contempt.
"I don't want you to work on your projects while we are here.", Tony shook his head in disbelief.
People have TV's, smartphones, enough food and most of them don't have to fight in wars. The people are doing well but they don't show respect to others. The children are rich brats who don't know how good they have it! Other countries still have wars but nobody does anything against it, climate change exists, our planet is full with plastic and nobody does anything against it! If Hydra rules the world and kills only a few million people do you know how good this would be for us? For the planet for the whole Population?", the light was finally turned on and Tony blinked to get used to the brightness.
Steve carefully brushed away the hot tears and shushed the genius down.
"Please, don't.", pleaded the brunette and he instantly felt how Steve withdrew his hand.
"I am going to bring you some comfy clothes so that you can instantly go to sleep alright?", Tony nodded with a huge smile on his face and asked himself how he deserved such a loving boyfriend then he pulled down his clothes and got into the shower. It was a very quick process because he only put some expensive shampoo into his hair and rubbed some body wash on his skin that smelt like strawberries. After rinsing everything off, he stepped out of it and dried himself off. A quick glance at the door made Tony realize that Steve watched him the whole time with a smirk on his face and he only wore a tight T-Shirt and some boxer-shorts.
"S-steve?", the blonde pulled slowly back and Tony had a chance to look at the crowd.
The mechanic felt relieved as the blonde finally went to the door and left the room. It gave Tony time to think about his escape. The brunette didn't really have much time to think about anything because Steve entered the room only two minutes after he had left. And he had a small glass bottle with him.
Thanks for the comments and kudos! ❤️
The brunette felt a strong wave of warmness overcoming him and he felt extremely happy which was also weird considering the situation he was in. He looked at his husband and blinked at him in confusion. Did Steve always have such wonderful eyes? The mechanic felt like gazing into an infinite ocean. He felt so good.
Tony looked over his assembled friends and said, "Wait. Are you people seriously grossed out by it?"
Barton and Wilson paused in mid-action and stared at each other before they both turned to Barnes, and Natasha smiled a bit and put a hand to his shoulder.
There was a series of pictures after that, one a stunning portrait of those two young women with the familial resemblance standing back-to-back in front of a solid white background, long hair perfectly coiffed for 1967, makeup done and giving the camera their most beguiling looks. Below that was a series of photographs that showed them in various stages of cracking up or making funny faces at the camera. The last photo was of them standing close to one another, grinning as they held a toothy-smiled toddler between them, cheeks pressed together, the little girl's dark hair pulled up in little pigtails. Tony stared at the photo a moment then turned to read the caption beside it.
Steve heaved a sigh. "That's not what I mean—"
," Steve corrected for him.
"I thought you said—" Tony began to say, but the doctor shook her head.
Steve shrugged. "Dunno. There's no name attached, but it's supposed to be delivered to the penthouse, so…"
"Will do," he said then said his final 'goodbye' to her and went to hang up the phone, but Rhodey pulled it away from his ear and did the honors for him. Tony thought about the weirdness of the call and Pepper's attitude before he turned to Rhodey and said, "Is something up?"
Jim rolled his eyes. "They didn't beat him up. They just...threw stuff at him. All right? Look, Philly's a tough town."
But he'd been dead and fine with it until they'd gone and disturbed him, rattled his bones and dragged him back to the land of the living. And now—
But the Cap just nodded a little, like he was absorbing Tony's words, before he said, "What was her name? Your daughter, I mean."
"You are bonded," he said, an almost awed innocence to his tone. "You should be delighted. You will get to experience that which no other bonded pair such as yourselves can ever know."
herself comfortable inside of him for over nine months.
In regards to the porn, it definitely delves into 'encouraged feminization'? Is that what I want to call it? Basically, Steve asks Tony if he can call him and treat him as 'Antonia,' and Tony, after some thought, says 'yes.' If that's not your thing, definitely skip this.
Thor continued to prattle on about all the merriment Steve could find on a trip to Asgard, but he stopped in the middle of unwrapping his left hand and stared at Thor a moment, attempting to process the words he was speaking. He got to a certain point with them — a point he didn't much care for — and as Thor continued to go on about...something...Steve said, "Wait, wait, hold on. What was that about—"
Tony blinked and looked between a suddenly confused Steve and Barnes. "Uh,
"What?"
except with a misplaced uterus instead of a heart.
Steve let out a big sigh. "Tony, I don't—"
He made to wrap a towel around his waist, but he dropped it at the last second when he realized what he was going to do, and he stepped out of the bathroom, hair damp and naked from head-to-toe, and he spotted Tony over by his computer, staring intently at it and, thankfully, also still stark naked.
He shook his head to clear it of the useless thoughts, Nat and Bucky taking that opportunity to appear, strolling out of the elevator together, Nat wearing a pair of long-sleeved, flannel pajamas with what looked like candy canes on them, her hair pulled up into a ponytail, and Bucky in a long-sleeved maroon shirt and gray pajama pants. They all exchanged various forms of 'Merry Christmas,' with Thor's being the loudest of them all, and Steve watched as Jim caught Tony's eye and nodded surreptitiously at Nat and Bucky like he was trying to get information out of him about them. Tony just made a slight shrugging motion as though to say he didn't know.
“Now get on with things,” Tony said. He’d been half-hard all day and didn’t want to drag this out any longer.
He thought about the way the amour felt when being used against him. The metal against his wrists holding him in place.
He wanted to be with them so badly. Wanted to show Johnny how wrong he was and that he knew how to treat Tony right.
When they excused themselves to go to bed there were arguments because how dare Steve think so little of him and believe that Tony was only dating him because of Captain America.
He wanted the Iron Man amour to be stronger. He wanted to be able to pin stronger adversaries instead of being the one that got pinned down.
“Cap?” Tony asks, voice small and meek. He’s playing his role well, clearly wondering if his Captain is going to let him cum.
“Jeez Tony, how small did you make the waist on this thing?” Steve questioned after suiting up that night. He was trying his best to not get into the headspace of going on a mission because he always tried his best not to allow himself to become aroused on a mission and he didn’t want to risk not being able to get an erection or risk getting a boner every time he was on a mission.
Steve looks at him, his soldier, a mess with cum trailing down his lips, his cock hard and leaking. Tony’s always beautiful but no one gets to see him like this. The sex tapes are nothing compared to this.
Steve apologised to Tony and admitted that he had a lot of insecurities because people only became interested in him after he became Captain America. Bucky was the only one who had cared about him before, and maybe Peggy but she didn’t know him for that long before the serum.
“Have you ever made him cum more than once during sex?” Johnny asks as Tony licks Johnny’s hand clean, and he can feel Tony freeze for a moment before continuing to clean up the mess, showing that he wanted what Johnny was implying.
“I love you Steve, not some made-up ideal,” Tony told him calmly after a lot of yelling and way too much honestly about how he grew to resent Captain America when he was around ten because of how much Howard loved him, more than he ever loved his son. Then, because Tony lacked a filter he rambled about how he would angrily jerk off while thinking about Captain America because, well, he was a teenager who had just realised that he liked men as well as women, Cap looked like that and Tony couldn’t help how his body reacted, plus if Howard ever found out his son lusted about Captain America it would piss him off to hell and back.
