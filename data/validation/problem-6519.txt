“This! Why don’t you stay on the truth? You could say things simple, like… When you told me about the soldiers in powdered wigs and silk stockings and that metrothing? Why didn’t you just say you are a poofter?”
Steve wasn’t still clear what the man wanted from him. He was their prisoner. They could do to him what they wanted anyway.
“I didn’t mean his medical condition. In this same situation, I would have killed our Tony, fast and painless.”
“He may not look like it, but he is starving. He thought we were torturing him with the lack of food.”
“Detainment with a minimum damage for the public safety, that is our goal. The Avengers Initiative is a wholesome face of superpowered community and enjoys wide public trust. It has taken us years of work and diligent cultivation of public opinion to get this far.”
Yes, Antonio was fine and Steve started to be seriously pissed off at him. Like this was a laughing matter.
“Sorry son”, Steve said just before he clocked the guy. He tied him with his own button down and belt and stuffed him into the trunk. Then he lifted Tony on the back seat and secured him with the seat belts.
How about asking some hundred millions? People always thought the end result, not the man hours or money that was used for design work and materials and the whole production process. There was no power to escape their touches. Communications didn’t work either, he couldn’t call for help. No computer to tell him how badly he was injured or what was going on, but he would take an educated guess. He had been hurt in the battle. Maybe he had landed too far from their battlefield that the Ultimates hadn’t been able to locate him first, and these scavengers had had a lucky break.
“Sir, are you trying to make me feel at ease? Please, don’t waste time. I don’t need any kind of explanations. I am going to the bathroom to take my uniform off. The sooner you get on with your analyzing things, the better chances for Tony to be alive.”
“Please”, Janet snorted pushing the button to shut the doors quicker. “You standing there eyeballing me! Our Steve would have already thrown me upside down onto one of his mighty shoulders and tickled the life out of me.”
Not so much different from his Antonio, after all. He felt how a tired and almost fond smile jerked the corner of his mouth. They left Tony to mumble to his tablet. The water, yes, he should drink. He was raising the bottle on his lips when a mundane thing popped into his mind and then it was out of his mouth.
Tony was still lying on the bed, but Steve wasn’t beside him anymore, not kneeling like some prince waking his Sleeping Beauty. His knees were next to Tony’s hips, he was bent down, supporting himself with his arms not to crush the smaller man under him. Tony’s clever hands were now massaging his thighs, his thumb wiping over his groin like by accident. Steve was uncomfortably hard already, leaking precum to his underwear, his breath shallow and his eyes squeezing shut, when Tony’s fingers were getting bolder. He was touching Steve’s cloth covered member, and soon Steve forget he had been kissing, he could only tremble helplessly on all fours as those fingers were taking a better grip and started moving up and down along his length. Steve was like a spellbound, he couldn’t have moved away from those touches if his life depends on it.
“His recovering is happening as expected. Overall, his operation went well. Damage was lesser than it seemed… except his tumor, of course. Have you gone through this with Captain Guard Dog there? The nurses report he hardly takes time to eat. If they let him, he would prefer to piss into the bottle instead of using the bathroom.”
Steve had stopped his rampage, permanently like. He had let them kill Gail’s son. His son. Steve had never talked about him to anybody except the other Steve during one of their rooftop meetings, and that was a conversation he didn’t want to repeat ever again.
That suggestion earned Steve a lucky boot in his nether regions. That was also the moment Antonio Stark staggered out from the front door. He was supported by Janet, or half-carried was maybe more accurate description. Janet might be short in her original form also, but she was no way a powerless and frail insect.
“That is a valid option. If they have something planned ahead, and that Tony is even half as smart as ours, he can make some real damage when he has Captain’s strategic skills and muscle to back him up. And if their arrival was not an accident… Who knows what resources they have moved over here beforehand?”
“Steve, maybe Antonio came here trying to repair his armor. I know our Tony would have done something like that if he noticed he is stranded in the strange universe somewhere far from home… Tony, anything?”
“Alright”, he continued after a while. “It seems it is my turn to apologize. I always forget… Even if you look the same, we are different persons. You are not me. Who knows, maybe you are the more clear-headed one of us. Wanna tell me what happened?”
“Sam Wilson aka Falcon”, the other Steve introduced when they had all hurried inside. He reached out with his hand and Sam gave it a brief, firm sake. Mechanical wings, he thought, of course it was Sam. He remembered the science brain ex-military, who had stood in attention before him like a damn rookie. The nightmare mission which had followed; the abandoned Russian super soldier program, and the underground base full of cannibalistic monsters.
“I was wondering…” the other Steve mused. “There is this clear difference between us. Doctor Freud in his books is always so adamant it has to be about the family, but couldn’t it be just circumstances.”
Steve glimpsed at the door. Tony hadn’t come in while he was occupied with the conversation. Keeping his movements in minimum, he turned his head there and here trying to find the origin of the smell. It took a few minutes, but then he detached a single muted heartbeat from inside the automaton.
And under all that cynical smartassness… but he had seen it before. All the time when he was alone with Tony, his patient explanations, his admiring looks when he thought Steve didn’t notice. His sassy non-flirting, the sharp flashes of teeth which melted into soft and melancholic smiles when he turned them towards Steve.
“Yeah, as you said. You are not one of those great minds. Come here, you big oaf”, the other Rogers said. The leader of the Avengers put his arm around his former comrade in arms and hugged him again. Rogers pushed his jaw onto his shoulder and left it there, and it seemed to Fury they hadn’t been doing it the first time. His voice had gotten hoarse as he explained: “Bucky had cancer. He had been ill so long. It was expected. Even a relief. For him and Gail too. She would be happy to see you, James. I have told her about you enough times.”
At least there was a tent on Tony’s sweats. Precum had made a cloth dark, and thinking it was him who had made that happen, while coming all over Tony’s hand and body, was a heady thought, enough to make him hot and bothered all over again.
It was definitely And. On the tablet, there was Clint, standing at the doorway. His usual bad jokes, and…
“No”, Tony admitted quietly. “I thought… you were the supersoldier of our nation, and I thought that you would maybe like to… but then you said you never wanted to shoot people again… Yeah, Steve. It is weapons. Old weapons. Lots of them. From handguns to… Steve, if he finds it, there is enough stuff in there that he can walk out from the mansion as one man army.”
“No he isn’t”, Rogers interrupted whatever Stark was about to say. “You were in need, sir. There was no time, and I wouldn’t have accepted your help anyway. We were taught like that then, you know, a man stands on his own two feet and doesn’t yap about it. I don’t say everything turns better by moaning about things, and there is some line after which repeating your sorrows only makes matters worse, so I am not such a big fan of talking even now. That other Steve was a good drawer, like a real artist, and my therapist suggested to express my feelings in the same way. Sir.”
“It doesn’t matter. I have dozen of sheets, I can spare a couple of them. Just drop that head onto the pillow and go to sleep.”
A lie. That’s right. They had gotten one of his arms off, but the other parts… Maybe he could bargain…
“Steve, don’t be like that. Nothing about what happened was your fault. Mine either. We were so young and naive and didn’t have even ounce of knowledge every teenager have nowadays.”
This time there wasn’t any pain, but something weird and scary instead. He landed, not on those equally hard surfaces, but on a something soft. It took him a few moments to realize he was standing on somebody’s leather-clad palm.
Fat chance. First came Natasha who was able to make one of her famous rodeo jumps. Before anybody knew it, she was riding on SteveToo’s shoulders and hitting his head with all her considerable skill and power. Those thighs were deadly weapons when they were around your neck, and SteveToo’s breathing started soon to sound funny. He tried but couldn’t swat her away while the Avengers team leader was keeping him busy with his kicks and hits.
Somehow he was able to do it. There was a faint puff when the mechanically controlled system of miniature hydro capsules worked out like dominoes and pushed armor’s joints apart, making the legs and arms come away from the torso.
like the one the Nazis had dreamed of and the USA had used in two cities in Japan. Thousands and thousands of bombs had been made after the first ones, and those men in high places, perhaps they were only biting their time when they planned to break the world.
Making fun of him? This had to be some hallucinogenic gas or spell or some other wishy-washy thing Steve hated. Still his reflexes were faster than his brain, and even if his mind told him it couldn’t be Natasha Romanoff standing in front of him, his shield was already flying. People didn’t take cover, duh, it was Captain America. The nation’s own vintage hero, who in Cosmo’s interview had confessed he hated violence and guns, because of the war, you know. So don’t show your gun to Captain America, but what if Captain America shows his first? And when had he started carrying again, anyway?
“You are one vindictive little bastard”, Fury sighed, watching as a gleeful smile widened Tony’s lips. “Why not to give your old man some slack.”
“Steve, listen. We modern people, we have so much porn, that we… we wait that our partners are like pros and we are impatient and demanding.”
“Funny, I was just thinking the same”, Steve mumbled. “That other Tony, he could organize a party. I don’t remember I have ever laughed so much.”
“He was an Italian poet. In one of his long poems there is this story about a man and his sons. How an enemy locked them in the tower. Let them starve until the father tasted the flesh of his own children.”
“So what? As you said, Antonio was out of his damn mind. He probably dreamed about his fancy parties and his arms full of some dame.”
Steve sat at the table as Thor went to the door. It opened and a trolley was pushed inside. Thor brought it forward and they emptied its load. It was indeed a feast, there was so much of everything. Steve’s stomach let out an angry growl and his mouth started to water. They had brought him porridge when he had asked and then broth and some bread. Yesterday he had eaten meat with gravy and smashed potatoes. Steve sniffed the taste. There was bovine meat again, and some kind of fowl, probably chicken.
“Not at all”, Steve said calmly. “Let’s hope he is more sappy guy than me, those really tough ones usually are.”
Sometimes she thought she didn’t know Steve at all. He could be so modern and ordinary and nice at one moment, and then…
Back to the search, he ordered himself. He didn’t found anything overly useful, though. There was an empty swimming pool, and lots of gym equipment. He returned to the shop and started to search it more diligently while desperation clawed right under his schooled calm exterior.
Steve-on-the-floor felt how a telltale heat started climbing over his chest and neck. He was suddenly so angry and embarrassed that for a second he forget his worry over Antonio. “How dare you! He is not my dream-anything! What the hell do you insinuate! You just joke around when Tony could be seriously hurt! He could be dying while you force me to sit here, listen to your bullshit!”
He could honestly say nothing had hit him so hard before. Not even a full blast from the tank. Without his shield he would have been only a stain on the floor. It was now obvious Thor was not a human as Steve had thought. Maybe all what he had said was true, and he was really a god.
“When I thought Bucky was dead… Well, I have to say even my drawing blocks or books didn’t help that much. They gave me no big understanding why my friend had died and I have to admit, I went wild for a while”, the other Steve said quietly. Even the memory of those months of sorrow seemed to be appalling for him. “One can say I fucked my way to the Ardennes. Sometimes it is really hard to keep a straight face when somebody says his grandfather was with me somewhere.
“Straight to the point, I like that. Alright. As long I am here, we have private time. The cameras are showing in the control room a computer reduced piece where we talk something else altogether. Anyway, I have been reading my dad’s old archives. I want to make the same deal he had with you. You see, I am influential man”, the little prick continued, the teasing, smug expression never leaving his face. “I can easily get you out of here. Fury and the SHIELD don’t know what to do with you, and they would be thrilled me taking this problem out of their clumsy, governmental hands. I am not only that influential, I am rich too, actually a billionaire, so money won’t be a problem. I can give you wealth over your imagination. Anything you want.”
When they separate, Tony moved to lower himself, face hovering above Steve’s crotch. He stared at Steve, smirking as he dragged Steve’s boxers down, just enough to free his hard-on.
Tony kisses Pepper goodbye while the other man shyly waves at her. She subtly looks at the alpha's crotch and raises an eyebrow at Tony.
“Burger King it is.” Steve adjusted the straps of his bag and walked beside Tony as they exited the campus in search for the nearest bus stop.
Tony stood at the port, watching as Steve carried a barrel filled to the brim with rations of food. He hauled it, loading it to the longboat with care not to spill its contents. Peter stood beside his mother, a frown on his lips as he stared at Steve.
Gritting his teeth, Peter jerked his head and gave a short nod of understanding. In his heart, he still looked unconvinced. There's disappointment in him at his father's rejection.
Tony bites his lips and groans. He leans forward and takes a finger into his mouth. Salty flavor hits his tongue and he licks his slick off of Bucky's finger with growing enthusiasm. He makes a show of bobbing his head up and down to mimic the way he sucked Bucky's dick as soon as he arrived at Bucky and Steve's apartment.
Peter nodded, "Mother says I have a good shield arm. And that I am no doubt, fated to be as good as a warrior like you."
Tony wants to say that it's not just their sexual prowess, but it's Steve's loving texts and calls when Tony's lonely; Bucky's massages when Tony's too stressed; the good mornings and good nights in between; the soft declarations of 'I love you's'; and all the little things that makes life worth living when he's beside the alphas.
“Daughter?” Steve asked, breath catching in his throat. Wonder filled his eyes as it drifted from Tony’s face down to his belly.
The man before him had brown, shoulder-length locks. Black war-paint marked the area around his eyes. He glowered at him and bared his teeth.
He grabbed Tony's chin and tilted his face to seal their lips together in a heated kiss. Tony continued to wiggle on his lap, sliding Steve's dick deeper inside him and angling it so it'll bump to his pleasure spot.
"Hey, isn't it a little bit cold in here?" Scott commented as he rubbed his hands together. He looked at the blanket covering Steve and Tony.
Rhodey bumped into Peter's shoulder, a rare proud beam on his lips. Towards the end of their training, Peter managed to land a hit on the battle-hardened Viking. He halted just in time, nicked Rhodey's clothes as a result.
Bucky splays his fingers, showing Tony how much slick he produced. He holds eye contact with the flushed omega as he licks one finger, moaning lewdly at the taste of the omega.
There was no convincing Steve. His mind is set on leaving and Tony could only pray to the gods for his safety. For now, all he could do is savour what he has. He can only cling to his alpha and hope that the will of the gods make it so that he won’t be alone, that Steve would be at his side until his he turn grey with time.
Tony barked out a short laugh that had a slight hysterical tone. The truth is that he's envious. After Thanos, he worked hard with everyone to make things better. He helped familes reunite and spent so much time and effort trying to get back the normal version of Earth, the way everything once was back when Thanos hadn't snapped his gross fingers yet.
"He will fade if he continues to do so," Pepper's eyes start to water, fearful of his friend's fate. "Promise me you will not let it come to that."
The apartment drowns in Tony's needy whimpers, Bucky's answering grunts, and the tell-tale sounds of flesh hitting flesh.
Steve and Bucky just stare at him, their minds still reeling with the new information. Tony helps them by repeating himself,
"Gods above," Sam breathed, wincing as the wound stung and fresh blood flowed from it. Steve nodded and continued to stab through their enemies.
So yeah, there's a possibility that Tony is perhaps carrying a little Steve and a mini Bucky. Thank fuck for the abundance of lube and the wonders of double penetration.
Heart clenching at the sight of his mate in distress, Steve held him close. Pressed his forehead against his. "Tell me what has got you upset."
And that? Well, that sounds like the dream sleeping inside Tony's mind for many years now. If they're lucky, maybe there'll be a kid or two playing around with the sheeps and rabbits.
Tony set aside the used toy and browsed through the comments. The view count is dying down, which is normal because they all got what they wanted to see: Tony stroking his dick and fucking himself. He reacted to some of the remarks he received but mostly ignored the rest. A few were downright nasty but he’s not one to judge a person by their kinks - not unless it’s a bad, illegal kink.
It's the morning kisses, the breakfast in bed, the random lunch dates, the walks in the park, the dreaded weekend gym dates, the opening of Steve's art gallery, the endless taste tests of Bucky's new recipe; and so much more.
Tony's already sticking his tongue down blondie's throat and the blondie's kneading Tony's ass like he's a baker and the butt is dough.
“This is for you, Winter.” Tony bent over the bed, spreading his legs wide giving the camera a perfect view of his hole still stuffed with the dildo and his limp, spent cock. He bore down as he dragged the toy out of him.
Steve groaned even more louder when he dipped his fingers inside the panty and groped Tony. The videos and pictures can never really convey properly just how soft, and bouncy Tony’s ass is.
The shield dropped with a loud thunk. Steve felt his knees buckle, strength leaving his body. He is not certain if the raven staring at him perched on the tree to his right is real. More blood seeped out of his wounds. Bucky is watching him, uncertainty clouding his gaze.
At the middle of the night, Bucky awakens after a vision of the man he stabbed and of another man. An image of the alpha looking younger and with shorter hair, placing his lips over Bucky's bonding gland. A smaller man pressed on Bucky's left, kissing the blade of his shoulder.
- Which is true, Steve is a pervert. But a good one, not one of those Craigslist assholes. Plus, he’s dashingly sexy too.
“Can I really have both?” Steve hoarsely asked. Because fuck, minutes ago, he felt like he’s living an actual nightmare and now it’s a complete opposite.
"The ice beneath me broke and I fell into the freezing water. And yet - and yet, I didn't feel as though I was drowning."
Steve couldn’t believe it. Tony used his gift. Tony fucked himself on a dildo based on his dick and found it ‘lovely’. Tony got off using a replica of Steve’s own cock.
Pepper snorts, very un-lady like. Who cares though. The music in the club is loud as fuck and the lighting's all sorts of neon. No one's watching them.
Steve's roommate is Bucky. He is Steve's childhood friend a.k.a. Steve's best and closest friend. Steve admits to Tony that they may have jerked each other off once or twice - alright, occasionally - so there's pretty much zero boundaries between them.
The sun has yet to rise, there are few people awake at this hour. Steve is alone and that's how he preferred it when he talked to those who are no longer of this world.
Steve watched with a fond smile as Tony waved his hands animatedly while talking about their team, their family.
Tony brightened up as he spotted the familiar username. Nomad, or Cap as he liked to call him, is also one of his regulars and he is the least creepy among his admirers - which is one of the reasons why Tony had accepted his gift. And what a gift it was, the dildo he used just now.
If he’s being entirely honest, he’d admit that he’s attracted to Tony. And that he’s probably in love with the guy too.
"What, no! We're still fucking!" Tony hisses. A sense of déjà vu hits him because he recalls this happening before : Pepper yelling at him because there's flowers on his work table.
Tony wrapped his arms around himself and turned his gaze away from his alpha. A frown sat upon his lips and there’s sorrow in his eyes. Steve moved to stand in front of him, carefully placing a hand on Tony’s neck to placate, to soothe. Tony leaned to his touch.
The danger with having a dummy account for liking Tony’s tweets is that there’s a chance that Steve will accidentally like Tony’s tweet using his real account. Something that Steve realized the night after his finals exams are done.
Steve tried his best not to check out the new tweet that Tony posted. His fingers itched to click on the notification that popped on the screen of his phone. He did resist for an hour or so. But when the painting he’s working on isn’t making any progress at all, he relented and grabbed his smartphone.
”You can date me in the morning. But I’m wearing lacy blue panty right now and you’re welcome to tear it off.”
”Definitely enjoyed your gift, Cap. Lovely cock you have.” Tony waggled his brows at the camera and smirked playfully. He knows the real identity of Nomad and concluded that he got off just fine at the sight of Tony pleasuring himself with his present.
Tony relucantly opened his eyes. Steve's voice when he confessed that he wished Tony would love him was so raw and broken.
Straddling Steve’s thighs and admiring Steve’s dick wrapped in condom, Tony coated his fingers with a generous amount of lube before plunging it inside himself. He started immediately with two fingers, to which he explained,
Steve repeated, insisted. As though, he wanted to convey that he is aware about all these and loved Tony still.
Tony gave his neck one last lick before going through Steve’s drawer and fishing out the lube and a condom.
Dreams often have meanings attached to it. Tony rarely had dreams which he could vividly recall the morning after. Such dreams forbode an occurence of something significant - whether it is good or not is up to the interpretation of the Volva.
"I am most certainly not. How dare you." Tony replies to his longtime friend. The alcohol in his system is making him slur over his words. But it's a well-deserved drink, or drinks, because after months of hardwork, they bagged the coveted partnership with Pym Technologies.
More blood flowed from between his legs. He howled with misery as he felt the life from inside him fades. He curled over himself, touched the blood seeping to the furs. He held the clumps of blood soaked-flesh in palm. He pulled it close to his chest, close to his heart.
Steve pressed down one more time before finally removing his fingers and replacing it with his dick.
Steve patted his son's cheek, "When your sister is able to stand on her own legs, you'll get your taste of Hydra blood."
Tony made a move to walk aways but Steve trailed closely behind. He stepped in front of Tony in attempt to get his attention.
Bucky's currently sucking his dick, shoving it down his throat as deep as he can take while his fingers are doing Dora the Explorer inside Tony's ass.
"--I am not! It's - it's," To Tony's extreme horror, he can't find the right words to explain to his best friend that he's bedding two alphas without sounding like a greedy omega.
Tony cried out as Steve inserted three fingers before even letting Tony finish his sentence. He’s loose enough to accommodate those fingers, but the suddenness of the action left a pleasurable burn. He felt his toes curl as Steve angled down, poking his prostate in a slightly rough manner - just the way Tony liked it.
In the middle of chaos where blood and guts painted the soil of the Eastern lands, Steve is knocked to the ground by a man who is of similar body size as him. Steve barely had time to raise his shield up to protect himself from the other alpha's blade.
he straight-laced Captain America can carry a conversation while pretending he's not currently balls deep and fully knotted to Iron Man.
Steve climbed on their bed, clamping down on the groan that bubbled in his throat. His wounds ached terribly still. He settled beside his husband, gazing at his face.
Scott watched them with amused expression. Oh, if he only knew...he's lucky he's a Beta and he can't scent them. They're screwed if it's Bucky or Nat who walked in.
"I wouldn't hang the shield. I'll pass it on to Sam. And then, we're free to spend the rest of our lives spoiling that fuzzy alpaca you love."
Tony stood up from the couch and positioned himself a few inches away from Steve. He let all his sensuality bleed in his body language and prayed that he came off as seductive and not desperate.
It’s not Steve’s first blow job. And he may not have more than you can count on fingers, still it’s the best damned blow job he ever got. It’s a miracle how he survived not unloading inside Tony’s mouth - Or to be more accurate, inside the condom in Tony’s mouth.
Peter glared at him. Steve sighed. He saw that same stubborn spirit in himself and in his husband. It made sense that his own blood would inherit the same fierceness.
Tony giggled. Winter is one of his regulars and several times, he mentioned how much he wanted to rim Tony. Obviously, ass play is one of Winter’s kink.
Tony grinned and leaned closer to Steve. He arched his back, bringing his chest lower. His nipples brushed against Steve’s, eliciting a moan from them both.
All the treasures they've regained from Hydra could never console him from the death of his own blood. With Tony's condition, Steve feared for him. He cannot lose him too.
They all growled, snarled, and chanted. Ravens were a sign of the Alföđr's favour. His eyes over Midgard.  Steve grinned up at the blue expanse of the sky. He spread out his arms.
Scott chuckled with slight unease. "I feel like I'm missing something here or my mind is just dirty."
Scott shrugged. "Change of plans. Hank needed her help." He headed towards the kitchen, likely to grab a drink and finish his tacos.
“I was hoping we could grab lunch together? Our prof just cancelled the afternoon class so I’m free for the rest of the day.”
Bucky breathlessly laughs as he swipes the stray cum from his face and licks it off of his thumb. He removes his other fingers from Tony's hole and smirks as slick slowly and stickily drips from his fingers.
Peter beamed at him. Steve ruffled his son's hair, which is still short for a proper braid. Peter ducked away from his father. He ran a hand through his hair and fixed his hair.
"Have you talked with Wanda?" Steve questioned. The Volva lived near the outskirts of their lands, in a house surrounded by and decorated with animal bones. She is a woman of few words. Her brother is a great friend of Clint.
Steve's rocking into him gently while Bucky's busy mouthing at Tony's neck and nipples but Tony still can't wave off the nausea that's gripping his soul. One particular thrust sends him whining but not in a sexually appealing way. More of a pained wail of an injured animal.
Because Tony can't really deal with this right now, he escapes from his office and dials Bucky's number.
"Steve, I...Look, one day you'll find an accomplished omega, or beta, or alpha, and then you'll live your happily-ever-afters with them in a white picket fence mansion."
Tony feels Bucky's throat constrict over his dick and shit, he's almost coming. He taps Bucky's shoulder as a warning sign.
"P - Peter, get Bruce, p - please." Tony sobbed. Peter could only nod his head and ran out to fetch Bruce.
The warriors shouted their enthusiasm, banging the blunt and of their weapons against their shields. Sam is grinning at him. A smirk is plastered on Natasha's lips. Clint is smiling with too much teeth showing.
Steve brought their mouths together again to cut the dirty talk. He always gets riled up with the obscene things that spills out of his mate's mouth. He'll really knot the omega at this rate they're going. He grabbed Tony's hips to still them in attempt to stall and avoiding getting stuck inside him while they're in the
There's a glazed and fucked out look on the mated pair's faces and Scott is either being deliberately obtuse or an absolute moron when he dismisses it as a result of just an
Once the ships are anchored and the warriors are standing on the shore, Steve looked at them all with pride.
"-- I can't. I don't want to risk what we have now. Come on, we both know it's not going to work! Look at us! We're
"Everyone's settled nicely and life seems to move forward after everything's that happened -- which is good, great, fantastic -- but,"
Bucky shrugged, “Yeah? So what? I don’t harass him or anything. I don’t act creepy like that Tiberius guy from Computer Engineering.”
Tony nuzzled the side of his face into Steve's warm, calloused palm, marking the man with his scent. "When will you be leaving?"
Pepper sips on her martini, a judgemental look on her face. "So you agree, you always talk about cocks and you are a size queen."
getting frisky on the couch was a bad idea. Then again, canoodling on the team's public space was never a good idea even if the others aren't around.
Steve smiled, "Perhaps one day, you shall accompany me and you'll be the one taking down their King's head."
Steve rutted his hips against the other man, willing himself not to cum as Tony nibbled on his ear and neck.
Sam and Nat had rushed to Steve's aid during the battle. As they saw him down on the ground with grave wounds, Sam charged against Steve's foe, trusting his blade with all force he could muster. When the alpha faced Sam to block his attack, it was as though time slowed. Sam called out to him, there was only a furrow in Bucky's brow to indicate that he heard Sam.
Steve cannot fathom why his mate insisted on raiding with him, even more so considering Tony is in a precarious situation.
Nat came from behind him, landing a hit at Bucky's arm. Caught unaware, Bucky attempted to wrest his bloddied arms away from her but Nat was quicker. She used all her strength to disarm him, twisted his arm with the dagger as her anchor. A sickening crack as the bones Bucky's arm are broken.
With that, Tony wished Steve would drop the subject entirely and they proceed inside the farm to feed the animals. Tony prayed that Steve would shrug it off and treat him like this whole exchange didn't happen.
Tony's ass is dripping with so much slick. Thank fuck Steve laid out a towel on the bed. The sheets won't be ruined and clean up will be easier.
He gasped in pain as his hands moved to cover the gaping wound. Steve felt weaker as he bled out to the ground.
Tony's thighs are coated with blood, staining the white of his clothes and the furs in his bed. His hands trembled as he laid it upon his belly, moaning in agony as he is hit with another painful contraction.
As for the parentage, the doctor delicately added,  there have been cases of superfecundation with omegas in triad mating.
Tony rushed towards Steve, excusing himself as he wades through the throng of students in the hallway.
At least Steve had the good sense to cover their nether regions with a blanket. Now if only Steve had the good sense not to pop a knot, it would be better.
Sated and high from reaching climax, Steve reached out and stroked Tony’s face. He grinned when Tony placed a chaste kiss on the palm of his hand.
Resting, this alpha truly resembled the man Sam knew to be his friend from boyhood. Bucky, a formidable Viking who they all thought was vanquished by Hydra many summers ago. His mind suffered, suffers still, and memories of his real home are buried. Corrupted.
"Steve, you're a wonderful man. You have a big heart, you shine in every single way and you help me become a better man but -- but I don't deserve you."
"Blame Stark, Lang. His whole existence is not safe for work." Nat teased with a msichevious glint in her eyes.
Tony turned to face Steve, a playful grin plastered on his face. He expected the alpha to be smiling too but there's solemn look on Steve's face instead.
Tony heard the sharp intake of breath behind him as Steve struggled not to thrust up. It's a testament to the man-with-a-plan's steel will when he doesn't even buck his hips as he pumped more sperm in Tony's ass.
"Their dicks must have been really good to have you settling down and starting a family." Pepper teasingly comments.
Even though the reason for his status is obvious from the cursed stick he peed at, the two lines glaring at him.
Even with fewer Hydra warriors, victory still felt far from their reach. Zola seemed to disappear once the battle began. There was no sign of him anywhere. A gnawing feeling stirred inside of Steve, a foreboding sense warning him that something unpleasant will occur.
"We fight today - for ourselves, for our loved ones, for our home. And should we fall, the Valkyries will summon us to Valhalla where we will feast with the gods!"
Similar to Sam, she froze once she recognized him. That moment would have caused her life but fortunately, Sam was there to deflect the Bucky's dagger about to impale itself on Nat's throat. With weapons knocked from his hands and an broken arm, Nat and Sam knocked him out and turned their attentions to Steve. Nat tore her sleeves off and used the cloth to bind Steve's wounds.
Tony snuggled closer to him, “I’m a genius, Steve. I hacked into Pentagon when I was twelve. Of course, I’d know all the identities of my viewers at Chaturbate, and in all my accounts.”
"The water started to freeze and that's when you finally appear, standing at the frozen lake. Watching as I submerge deeper - someone stood beside you. But I couldn't see their face clearly."
Pepper doesn't get the chance to reply. The blond beefcake that Tony's grinding on earlier returns from the restroom and proceeds to wrap his burly arms around Tony's waist.
Tony shook his head. His eyes looked scared as he held Steve's gaze. Steve opened his mouth but Tony didn't let him speak.
Shaking his head to rid himself of the prophecy, Steve then placed a kiss upon his mate's forehead, whispering a words of love on his skin.
." Beefcake groans audibly, which alerts Tony of his presence. Beefcake is ogling at his ass which is up in the air as he was bent over the floor.
"Growing a baby makes an omega crave more sleep than normal." Tony explained. "Which you might understand, should you present as an omega later on."
It's Pepper who pointed it out. What makes it absurd is that Tony's been sexually active since hitting puberty but Pepper's the one who figured that Tony has a, well, preference.
Steve grunted and pushed back with all his might, throwing the man off of him. He regained his composure and stood, legs spread evenly to balance his weight. He put some distance between them before lowering his shield.
"--  I never stopped loving you even when I thought you could never love me back. Even when I lost all my chances. But here we are again, and you never really told me if you have the same feelings -- which is fine, but I must say this,"
Tony shook his head again, as if to silently beg Steve not to talk, not to say what he is about to say. He justs wants Steve to stop.
The noises became louder and Steve joined them, thumping his shield in a similar manner. A battle cry, symbolizing that they are ready. Above them, ravens flew and Natasha glanced up at them.
Tony did not move to place his lips on the cup. He stared blankly at the roof, "I do not feel thirsty. Nor hungry."
Steve still continued to torture him. Tony moaned and whimpered. His hips bucked wildly as Steve massaged his prostate. The bigger man wrapped his other arm on Tony’s hips in attempt to still his movements.
They've always been stuck in a 'more than friends, less than lovers' type of relationship. Tony always yearned for something more but he doesn't allow himself to try.
Sam glanced towards the corner where the wounded man slept. His entire left arm wrapped in torn cloth. Bruce had it bound to hasten the healing of his broken bones.
Tony scoffed, "Falcon? A great mentor? He's just as worse as Bucky. Pete's better than those two id — ahhh!"
They stood their ground, pushing back and resisting against their foes' forces. Steve inhaled deeply, patiently waiting for the right timing to counter-attack.
Silence blanketed over them. The fire crackled and Bucky closed his eyes again. He dreamt of burying his hands to the soft earth and a voice of a woman calling him Bucky.
She whispered in awe. The raven's black wings spread wide as they hover above them. Natasha repeated her words, shouting, "Odin is with us!"
Tony closed his eyes. If he spends another second staring at the earnest look in Steve's face, he'd cry. "-- Please, please, no --"
"You were taken from me before you could take your first breath. I am changed. Now, there is no moment where I have not thought of you."
Of course, it alarms both Steve and Bucky. They halt their movement and Steve carefully pulls out. Which Tony is grateful for, because as soon as Steve's disconnected from his ass, Tony hurries to the bathroom and regurgitates the roast beef and baked potatoes he consumed earlier.
Bucky’s the sort of guy everyone quickly falls head over heels for. He’s friendly, attractive, easygoing, and extremely charming. He’s also annoyingly nosy once you befriend him.
After almost an entire week of craving every food known to existence and saying hello to yesterday's dinner on the toilet bowl, sometimes on the sink, Tony begrudgingly schedules an appointment with his doctor.
There is tremor in his words. Tears fell freely from his eyes, "Why did you have to die, dear child?"
Tony's in the middle of reaching for his socks under the nightstand when his hookup enters the room, sweaty and still hot as fuck.
"They're too many!" Nat grunted. Steve tightened his grip on his axe. What she said was true - their numbers are much lower compared to Hydra. They have lost some of their kin and with how long they have been in battle, they are on the brink of exhaustion.
“You’re like, the only artist I know who keeps his stuff organized.” Tony plopped down on the couch and took out his food.
Bucky winced as he attempted to sit up. Sam shook his head at him, "Your wounds are yet to heal. Do not get up lest they re-open.
He imagines if Steve and Bucky had average sized penises - or if they have smaller than the average - would he stay and still be satisfied?
His scent is obviously an alpha's. Tony doesn't really have a favorite, he bangs alphas, betas, and omegas.
"No, we're just fucking!" Tony hisses. But there's a huge ass bouquet on his work desk where Steve bent him over the other day and ate his ass like a cat with cream.
Pepper's eyes are misty as she takes in the picture of the twin blobs. She kisses Tony's cheeks and wipes her eyes.
Tony’s apartment was only a fifteen minute walk and Steve doesn’t have a lot of time to come up with a decent explanation for his actions. All he has is the truth and it will inevitably paint him in an unflattering light.
"You don't want me, Steve. I -- I'm not, I can't even take care of myself. I'll spend my days at the lab. I'll forget our anniversaries --"
Each time he masturbates to Tony’s videos, he’s left feeling dirty and guilty He always tells himself that he should probably unfollow and unsubscribe to all of Tony’s accounts. But he never finds the strength to do so.
The alpha withdraws Tony's dick from his warm mouth and uses his other arm to jerk Tony to orgasm. His fingers still jabbing at Tony's prostrate incessantly as the omega tightens around him and leaks copious amount of slick.
In the middle of the night, Tony lays awake wondering if Pepper was right, if he really was a size queen.
”Before you start prostrating yourself at my feet and weepingly beg for forgiveness, please know that I am aware you’re NomadTheCaptain and I stuffed a replica of your cock up my ass and wholeheartedly loved it.”
His heart squeezed at the thought of Steve bonding with someone else but he grit his teeth and continued.
The deep sound of Hydra sounding their battle horn caught his attention. What's left of the surviving enemy cheered as moments later, they heard the thunderous rumble of reinforcements charging towards them. Armin Zola sneered at him, taunting him.
A moan slipped from his lips as the toy nudged his prostate. He heard the successive dings of notifications, which are probably his viewers typing lewd remarks.
"Oh, shut up! Steve's just a thoughtful man! He's just making sure I eat dinner!" Tony shoots back at her.
"Our goal is simple: kill Zola and his men. Then, we take all their stolen treasure and return to our home, rich with plunder and sated with the knowledge that blood of Hydra watered the Eastern lands once again!"
Pepper strides over to his table and snatches the card from the bouquet. She squints as she reads it.
A shrill sound jolted Peter. He might have cut himself on the axe if it were not for his quick reflexes. His heart, however, jumped to his throat. A chill ran down his spine.
Steve looked like he’s torn between shedding tears of joy or punching himself to test if he’s just hallucinating.
Steve snarled and bared his teeth at him. Though they are exhausted, his fellow Vikings would gladly fight to the death against Zola's forces.
A year and a half of superb sex and numerous dates, Tony still haven't directly informed his dearest Pepper that he's very much in love with both Steve and Bucky.
Tony said nothing. Mind occupied with thoughts of his lost child. Pepper closed her eyes for a while, silently pleading for the gods to bring comfort to the grieving mother. She then stood up and tucked the loose strands of hair on Tony's face behind his ear, a fond yet sad smile on her lips.
As they near the shores of Hydra, the warriors prepared their best weapons, sharpening them with stone and adjusting the straps of their shield. A wooden bowl filled with blood is passed around and they each dip their fingers in it. They painted their faces using the red, viscous liquid. Different markings to signify their intent to fight, their prayers to the gods asking for their favour.
A knowing smile graced Tony’s lips, “It is too early, but I feel in my bones that this would be a girl.”
Tony angled his head and sucked on the spot behind Steve's ear. The place that never failed to make his alpha shiver and growl. More aroused and intense.
Steve's wails are muffled by their kiss as Tony tightened over the full knot. Tony shook as his own climax took him
(He did share about his sex life, that he's fucking both Steve and Bucky. But he doesn't talk about feelings, he can ramble about how he made the alphas creams themselves at the same time and enjoying the occasional double penetration but feelings? Love? Nah, he's too shy.)
, film a clip when I saw your like.” Tony angled his fingers up in search of that tiny, magical, pleasure-filled bump. “
The Steve mourning scene in particular is inspired by a  heartbreaking scene in Vikings season 2, where Ragnar is chilling by the sea talking to his daughter, Gyda. Of which the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful.
”I’m the only artist you know.” Steve retorted as he took a seat adjacent to Tony. “Besides, it’s easier to identify what color I’m running out of if my art supplies are sorted.”
Tony feels his orgasm building with the continuous forceful thrusts, but Steve suddenly slows down. He teasingly drags his dick out of Tony's hole, leaving only the head in and the rest out. Tony tries to buck but Steve grips his hips to steady him.
"When I hit the bottom of the lake, you were also there. Eyes closed, peaceful, as if you were just sleeping. You were warm, and I curled up next to you and slept."
"You said before that you wanted to build a farm, settle down with someone and live a simple life. I could give that to you, if you'd let me."
Steve nearly dropped his phone. He panicked. He could pass it off as an accident but Tony knows him. Steve’s rarely used social media and accidents like this don’t usually happen to people like Steve.
Steve catched his shield before sprinting towards his axe. He picked it up and readied himself but Bucky is on him faster than he anticipated. Pain seared through him as a dagger punctured his side. Blood splattered to the ground as Bucky removed the dagger.
"I know you," Bucky croaked. Sam stirred from his seat and gazed upon him. "Or rather, I feel as if I know you."
Then again, no matter how much Tony loved the toy, Steve can never offer the actual thing it’s based on because Tony can never know that his friend is a creep who jerks off to him.
"The same dream I had the other night. And on some nights before that." Tony  continued, "I was walking upon a frozen lake, barefoot and endless. I searched for you everywhere, calling out your name but I couldn't find you."
Except Pep isn't a hairy giant barging in and Tony's not a scrawny child who's in the middle of awakening his magical powers. Taking in humongous cocks doesn't qualify as 'magical powers'.
When morning arrives, Tony wakes up alone. He spots a note on the nighstand but he saves it for later because he feels filthy and he badly needs to pee.
Steve braced his shoulders. He could not go to Valhalla just yet. Not when he has yet to meet his daughter.
"-- Hope's finally agreed to marry Scott. Thor's smiling genuinely nowadays. Bucky's out there protecting the friendly neighborhood with Pete and Sam. And you know how those two mouth off so Bucky's either a saint or he's using tech that can mute the noise spilling from those two."
When he's out of sight, Tony groaned and adjusted his position on Steve's lap. The blanket felt too warm now, so he discretely asked Friday to turn up the AC. He clenched on Steve's length, testing if the semi-knot is still there.
Rhodey grinned and held out an arm to help Peter up. He dusted his clothes and picked up the axe on the ground. Rhodey circled him, ready for the next round. Peter sniffed then moved to a battle-ready stance, axe positioned securely in his hand.
"It's all wonderful. We've got the team back and you're all set to attend an Intergalactic Summit in a few weeks time! Imagine that,
Steve doesn’t feel as happy anymore. The stream on his laptop stops. He removed the earphones and exited Incognito mode.
Tony's heart is leaping from his chest. He thought that nights where he got thorough banging from two alphas was just having fun. Evidently, it's not.
Tony denies her accusations. He refuses to be typecasted into a slutty omega salivating over big dicks.
“Why not, husband?” Tony challenged, tilting his chin up and holding Steve’s gaze. “I was a warrior before you married me. I went on raids with you.”
Tony whined. Steve didn’t relent. Instead, he massaged and teased him even more. “Tell me you need my cock, Tony.”
Tony huffed. "What should I do then? Live on the farm and devote my life to my beautiful alpacas? You know what, that actually sounds amazing. Maybe you can join me."
Tony screams as Steve fucks him roughly and jerks him off at the same time. He's drooling too, overwhelmed by the intense pleasure he's receiving.
Peter blinked and furrowed his brows. He is not certain  if he heard someone scream. Shrugging, he resumed sharpening his axe. It was a gift from his mother, a training weapon. The handle had a carving of a rune depicting Peter's name. It has been in his possession since two summers ago. No blade will ever compare to the ones his mother crafted.
The grin on Tony's face fell as he meet Steve's gaze. It was piercing, heated, and Tony's heart started pounding.
A carrying omega rarely, if not at all, fought in battles. Fighting bore great risks that would endanger the life of both the carrier and the child. The loss of the unborn in such cases is unnecessary blood spilled. Pointless and cruel.
"-- So yeah, Sam totally had it under control but Peter's, well, he's Peter." Scott finished. And damn, was he talking all this time? He's even comfortably settled on the adjacent couch, shoving popcorn in his mouth.
Tony licked his lips, "No biggie, bug guy. Thought I smelled popcorn." Which is a complete lie. All he can smell right now is Steve's intoxicating alpha scent. The divine smell of popcorn is not on his radar given his predicament.
Steve and Tony jolted apart. Scott has returned. With a bag of freshly popped popcorn. Butter flavor too, Steve and Tony's favorite.
Tony willed his body to tighten around Steve’s cock. “I am no Freyja. And we have no need of her for I am already carrying your daughter.”
Steve shook his head. He can’t believe Bucky also saw those pictures and videos. Can’t believe Bucky’s aware how Tony’s dick looked like when it’s hard or how pretty his nipples are after it’s been clamped, or how red his hole is after a thorough ass play — aaaand Steve’s being a creep. His face is flushed too, a damning evidence of his guilt.
Steve chuckled before draping an arm around Tony’ waist. Before sleep fully consumed him, an alarming thought crossed his mind.
The knot expanded and Tony tugged on Steve's hair to kiss him again. He bore down and let his hole swallow the entirety of Steve's knot.
"A grand dream. Something I would have done if I got the chance to." Tony tapped his son's nose affectionately. "I long to ride the boat and sail across oceans once again."
That's why when Tony jokingly (or maybe like, just twelve percent joking) suggested they have a threesome with Bucky, Steve replied that if Tony actually wants that then Steve's willing.
(But at the rate they're going, it's...out of question. They have better chances of Rhodey admitting his password is 'Warmachineroxx3000' than Steve's cock not sporting a knot.)
The alphas shower him with kisses and warm hugs. All three of them are wearing the biggest, disgustingly happy grins on their faces.
Steve groaned when he saw how beautiful Tony’s panty is. It matched perfectly his creamy skin and pert butt. The fabric is stretched to its limits as Tony’s boner takes up the remaining space.
(Tony brags about Steve sketching Bucky going to town on Tony's ass and Bucky giving Tony a show as he spreads whip cream all over Steve and licking it all off.)
Steve spluttered as he nearly choked on the piece of french fries going down his throat. Tony couldn’t help but laugh at him.
Later, when they're done dishing out their excitement at the future heir of Stark Industries, Pepper reveals that she knew all along that Tony's on the way to triad mating. Steve and Bucky had approached her and in a way, asked for her blessing before seeking advice on how to approach Colonel James Rupert 'Rhodey' Rhodes and ask for the alpha's blessing.
Exhausted, Steve failed to notice that he was logged in on his real Twitter when he liked Tony’s newest post.
Tony grinned before nipping on Steve's ear and gyrating in his lap. Steve bit his lip and inhaled sharply so as to prevent from moaning out loud.
Naked as the day he was born, he strolls outside the bedroom and heads straight to the bathroom. He opens the door only to find a naked brunette about to take a shower.
Steve dislodged his axe before surveying his surroundings. Sam is on his left, thrusting his great sword into the chest of a red-head man. Natasha is near Sam, stabbing her dagger in the legs of her foe.
Steve raised a brow at him, then turned his gaze to Tony with the same amusement dancing in his eyes. Tony gestured subtly at him to grace their son with a reply.
“Sure this isn’t expired?” Tony teased as he waved the condom. Steve snorted and dragged him down for a heated kiss.
Steve slumped on his bed. His laptop is still open, earphones still plugged in his ears. Tony’s rambling about orgasms and the different toys he has but Steve’s too occupied and overjoyed with the revelation that Tony enjoyed his cock. Never mind that it’s just a replica, it was still his gift! His penis!
Steve wetted his fingers with it, dragging it across the lid of his eye up to his chin. He prayed to the gods for strength.
Steve hurriedly squirted lube on his finger and Tony would have laughed fondly at his enthusiasm but he’s too aroused and he’s becoming desperate for stimulation.
So, this will tackle scenes where Steve mourns the loss of his child. Please be mindful of that, if it is triggering to you.
He is greeted by the sight of Tony asleep. He looked at peace but he is paler than usual. His lips lacked color and his hair lost its shine. He has grown thinner too, with days of consuming little to no food according to Pepper. Steve had been unconscious when they arrived back home, only regaining his strength three days after. He was greeted by the grim news of Tony's miscarriage and a previously-thought dead Bucky turned out to be alive but with a muddled mind.
- which the alpha grabbed with immense accuracy and immaculate timing. The blood in Steve's veins froze. A treasured memory pulsed in his mind.
"Peter, your mother needs you at his side. Your sister too." Steve gestured towards Tony's middle. "I need you to help your mother to protect our lands from any harm."
"SHIELD WALL!" Steve bellowed, backing away and raising his shield to his chest. The rest of his men joined him and they banded together. Shields positioned as the Hydra reinforcements lunged at them.
-- But Steve looked so hurt, devastation plastered on his face. It clawed Tony's heart to see him crushed.
The other alpha faltered before gathering himself and throwing back Steve's shield to his face. There was little doubt to the man's identity - this is Bucky, the same alpha who grew up alongside Steve, Sam, and Nat. Bucky, whose father was a farmer and whose house lived near the river.
Tony usually leaves after hookups but he's too exhausted from the multiple orgasms Steve coaxed out of his body. He spends the night at Steve's apartment after Steve assures him that it's perfectly fine for him to do so.
“I am son of Cain”, he repeated. He didn’t like the direction this conversation was going. “Those other things. They are just myths. They don’t exist.”
He heard how they talked in that little device the thunder god had in his ear. They were buzzing like busy bees.
That too took a few moments to register. “Whoa! No!” he shouted, separating himself from Tony. “When you mentioned Richards, I thought you meant Sue! Are you mad?”
“We will be ready in five”, Doctor Samuel Heller was stating at the microphone. Unlike his colleagues, he wasn’t affected by his presence. Heller knew his own value better than most, without him and his theories the Project Homecoming wouldn’t exist. Without Doctor Heller, they would be still wondering, what had happened to their assets, and no, Fury was not being a prick when he was talking about Steve Rogers and Antonio Stark like they were not breathing and living human beings. He thought like that about all the people who he worked with. The people he had to order to take enormous risks, who he sometimes had to send to a certain death. Thinking about them like persons he would ask for tea and biscuits or to play a round of racquetball was out of the question.
“That is quite impressive list”, Clint started to say when Natasha’s angry gaze stopped him. Maybe now was not a good time for bad jokes. “Nat… if you could leave? Seeing you seems to agitate him only further.”
It was not a time for a witty banter from the screwball comedies. Tony’s face flushed with anger. For a while Steve wondered was the older man going to have a heart attack.
She had made it to the roof. The fire escape was clattering as if some heavy and quickly moving person was climbing the stairs. First came a shield and then a man. Then a word.
“A dirty boy”, Tony admonished him. The corner of his mouth quivered as if he was in a verge of laughing.
“No my dear, you didn’t”, Sue said with a patient air of a person, who had done this same thing many times before. “You can have your uniform back after we are done harvesting. Your clothes should not be harmed in any way during our research.”
Fury seemed like he was only a few seconds from the moment he would blow a gasket. “Barton, one more and you are out of this meeting”, he barked. “At ease, Captain Rogers. And welcome. I assume you know everyone.”
When the safety lever was released, there was about three and half seconds before detonator would explode and ignite the charge. Antonio wasn’t going to throw the thing at her. No, he had pushed it against his own chest and while the sight broke Janet’s heart, her sting was already hitting his hand, making Antonio drop the grenade. At the same time it was infused by Pym particles and when the thing finally detonated, the explosion was so tiny it made less harm than a child’s firecracker. Even Antonio’s sweats didn’t get burned.
Rogers managed to look as if Fury had spat him into the eye. “I would call it a little more than that, sir. We got married two months ago.”
Antonio was shaking his head a light smile on his lips. “Yeah, darling. We… actually no, but… Alright! Birthday party it is! Anthony, did you have any strippers? Do you see what I am suggesting here.”
Doctor Heller was not a cuddler. That was one reason Fury liked the man. They would get their assets back, dead or alive, and valuable information about the process. It wouldn’t do that some unknown force just snatched people and flung them away. The SHIELD needed any knowledge available about the incident to fight back if similar things happened again.
The Avengers Quinjet was hovering over the said coordinates, in its stealth mode. Natasha copied the both reports and turned to pass them to her team leader.
“What do you want to eat?” she asked, noticing how he looked at her, as if wondering if this was a new way of torture.
“Alright”, Tony mumbled, not turning his visor from Steve-standing-besides-the-elevator. “Alright, but how do we know which one...”
Some instinct made him suck. It was not a hard decision, it was a gesture every infant mammal managed. Tony let out a whimper, which were getting loader when Steve repeated the gesture. Tony’s hand was not over his anymore. They roamed freely on his back and flanks, Tony moved his head to get a better angle for their kisses, pushed his fingers through his short hair to move his head.
Jesus, that smirk. Those lips, those shining eyes… Steve felt himself getting hot. It was a fight not to embarrass himself right there, he was wearing sweats, so protection gear was not intact. But Antonio… he called everybody darling. It wasn’t like Steve was something special. He had to bite his lower lip not to hurl his accusations aloud, because what had Tony promised to him? Yes, exactly nothing. It had all been in his own head.
“If he indulges himself and prances like a poof, what about it. It is nonoperational. He is in a constant pain. He should do anything he wishes with the short time he has left.”
“Red Skull!” he shouted lifting his prize high over his head. “Why do you still send your underlings against me? Why do you still test me? You know what I can do! You can sent down the whole pantheon of your false gods, I will fight them all! I will never give up! Do you hear me, you Nazi filth! I don’t care if you and your lot have run over the whole world! Freedom and democracy will rise again! People will rise against you and your foul ideas! If you think Sarah Rogers raised quitters then you better think again!”
“Doesn’t get help if you collapse and we don’t hear your tale. Tony is the science brain of this team. Do you know anything about traveling through the dimensions? I didn’t think so, me neither. He will need that fifteen to get out of his armor and tidy himself up. Use it wisely.”
His confession didn’t make the man angry. Exact opposite, actually. “Yes, I know you screwed my dad over”, he grinned. “I can’t blame you for that. But our science is more advanced now. Those samples Bruce got from your corpse, so to speak. I would like to have a dash of fresh ones and after that… If science can’t solve the riddle, it has to be magic. And if it is magic, it can do anything.”
Steve didn’t need much rest anyway. He could go almost a week without any sleep at all, but he liked the weightless feeling of unconsciousness. When he didn’t have bad dreams.
The smell hit his nostrils when the door opened. A unique mix of nervous sweat, manly musk, and unwashed armpits. Steve pulled his underwear on sure he had smelled wrong, but this time he didn’t: at the door stood the guy he had killed in the lab.
Steve cursed himself. During his time in the SHIELD compound and the Stark Tower he was used to eat so much and so regularly he didn’t have his endurance anymore.
She had counted in her head while planning their trail. The people gave her cover but she had to keep out of Steve’s sight that he wasn’t tempted to shoot again. At the same time, she had to be seen at least occasionally that he didn’t get frustrated and (you guessed!) started to shoot just to make her show her face. It was heart-breaking to think about Steve on the same terms as their villains, but the consequences of her softness would be too pricey: more innocent blood in her hands, when her past life had made sure her account books were in red already.
“That’s mercy. You don’t leave your comrade in arms behind, when there is no chance to escape torture and death. Never fear Tony, your death would have been avenged, I would have come out here and done what he is planning now, taking as many of my enemies with me as possible.” Then there was time to no more explanations, Steve hit the witch and Tony grabbed Clint. They were the first ones out, Iron Man covering the archer and pulling the enemy fire, Janet was next and then Sam who rushed through the hole like a leak bird of pray. Steve had no wings or way to fly, but it was only some ten yards, he didn’t even need to put his shield first. He made a superhero landing, covering himself with the shield when his enhanced hearing picked up a tell-tale hissing sound of the burning fuse.
“We realize that, Captain Rogers, but during peacetime, ripping people’s, even bad people’s throats open in front of the camera phones is not an option. If that is your thing, we can arrange some wet work activities with our black op team. They are able to find you assignments where messy is better.”
, Steve thought, when the blond giant squinted his eyes and bent forward to look at him, as if trying to reveal his deception.
“I made a quick scan and it was negative for both... Wait a minute! What did you mean that I am not Tony Stark?”
The next ten minutes the group spent looking at the baby pictures, of all things. Fury understood it was the first born girl of that other Tony and his wife, Virginia Potts-Stark.
Oh god, Steve will be so pissed off at him! But he couldn’t help himself, he was already pushing his lips against that radiating cheek, looking for a mouth, a new born puppy searching for his mother’s tit. Steve pushed his forehead against his to keep him still.
That was the only warning he got. Then those big hands were on his hips and he was lifted into the air, pushed onto the mattress and Steve was between his legs then, repeating the things Tony had done to him and inventing some of his own. Tony litany of praise didn’t cease, though, only changed its course.
The silence that followed his question was an answer in itself. Fury sighed again. Rogers didn’t do anything halfway, did he? Too bad he needed a whole new universe to get his ass out of the closet.
“You are a glorious sight, darling”, Tony was mumbling, petting his hair. “Let it come, let it all out, that’s right, sweetheart, look at you go. You are flushed, darling, do you know how much effort it takes to get a supersoldier all sweaty and trembling. That’s right, fuck my hand, Steve, think how good it would feel if it was my tight, lubed hole, or my mouth, oh darling, the things I could do to you with my tongue, you would like them, I bet you would. That big rod of yours, getting bigger and bigger and all that dreamy desert, for me to taste, for me only, until it is so much my mouth can’t hold it but I can’t just swallow fast enough either...”
“Antonio, listen. No don’t listen, I know there is no words now to correct this situation and Clint’s idiocy, but if you would just look at this instead.”
They made her a spy and an assassin, and then they sent her far from her home. Over the sea, all the way to the hostile shores. To the land of lies.
Steve took his shield and stood up, his gloved hand over the door opening mechanism, ready to engage. “For the record, I understood both of those pop-culture references… alright people. We do as we planned. Janet, do not engage SteveToo in any means. Your mission is to find Antonio. Our only chance to end this quickly and cleanly is that he talks some sense to that big oaf. Let’s hope he is still alive.”
Steve was born and raised on the wrong side of the tracks. He knew well the thoughts of men who asked other men if they were nancy. How they were cheering themselves towards violence with those talks.
For a few seconds Tony stood there like a lost little boy, alone in the woods. “You… did you found the body?”
It was only a whisper. Not exactly a threat, only stating the fact. The father who was so hungry he gorged on the flesh of his offspring.
“That, my friends, was a bulls-eye hit from an original bazooka”, Stave said calmly. “Nat, inform Fury we need neighborhood cleared asap. This is not going to went down peacefully.”
“Sam, he shouldn’t have been alive”, the more squeamish one said, his voice tight, as his friend stopped the saw.
Tony snorted. “Should have known my dick is a fall of me. It was that miracle nose of yours, wasn’t it, and I like an idiot giving you a close sniff of my bodily odors. I saw how you stared at me in the meeting, dying to tell them and pester that fucking Barton in his own game. Fuck you! And your coffee!”
Not particularly, no. But what else there was to do? He was too restless to play cards, and he didn’t want to agitate the other Steve by winning. Or himself by losing.
“You like this, Tony? How about we turn you around? Can you put yourself on your hands and knees on the bed?”
“You know our Steve. So modest. But you know the drill, Fury. Supersoldier, power, strategic skills, the whole shebang. Like twin brothers. In every aspect.”
The royal third person did the trick. Or maybe those bees in Thor’s ear were bored or just wanted to see what Steve was capable of because the shield was soon delivered to the room by the same method they had gotten the food. It was strange to feel its weigh in his hands again, but there was no time for nostalgia. His host had taken a battle stance. Even the air around the man felt to electrify, and for a moment Steve wondered could he really command the lightning with his will. A moment was indeed all Steve got. There was a mighty battle roar and a shout for the glory of Asgard. Steve hardly had any time to raise his shield to protect himself when the hammer hit him with the power which could level buildings. And it would, if the glass had been only glass and not alien substance which didn’t yield under their efforts.
“Yeah, it is nice that Stark is good for something at least”, Barton barked out a laugh. “You can’t know, but the guy is like some reverse Frankenstein. Rotten doctor and his noble monster.”
Shit, he was out of it. He had no power left even to be scared, when the saw seemed to come closer. Sam was trying it to the lock of his hair.
And that wasn’t disturbing image at all. He felt how his lips tried to turn into an involuntary smile as Tony continued pulling his hand to himself.
century, Mr. Rogers. How about… I would like to stuff my mouth full of that first grade meat, but that means I can’t talk… what a dilemma… maybe I handle it while I am pondering this matter… if I took a firm grip of things… like this… thank god for my long fingers, darling, you have quite a girth… yes, I think we are making good progress… oh, look at that, hello there, do you have something in your eye, you are leaking awful much… maybe… we have better examine that it is nothing serious… how about if I lick it like this… yes, definitely, maybe some more samples…. Mmm…. Yes, this is it, this is what I have been looking for my dusty old cellar… Darling, I will bottle you up, you are vintage… if your precome is like that, what a wonder the main course will be like… maybe if I lick a little bit of this… and little bit of that… and slide my fingers over here… oh yes, so tight, like two coconuts… should I explore further…”
This less than patriotic side of his recruitment legend made him smirk at his own folly. “Actually, I wanted to be more manly”, he confessed, “and here were are. Now I am drawing pictures like a… I don’t know. Like that other Steve, I suppose.”
Fury felt a strange emotion, which he had let himself feel only seldom since his childhood. He was curious. That was the thing which killed the cat, he tried to remind himself, but his guts told him there was a riddle which was not preparing to bite them in the ass. A god honest pleasant surprise was waiting, and finally, after three hours of testing, probing, and rubbing, both men were sitting (as Rogers had guessed it) in the interrogation room, their hands cuffed to the table.
Steve sighed. “I am not sacking you, Tony. Not now, anyway. You practice with us as usual, but as long as you continue drinking, you are not taking part in the missions.”
century, macho was not the first word which came to mind. However, in spite of their soft-looking appearances, they had been as ruthless and efficient soldiers as any other men before and after their time.
She restrained herself until they were alone in the kitchen. Bucky was taking a little nap in his favorite comfy chair while Gail and Steve were putting away dirty dishes and remains of the food. Or Steve was doing the heavy lifting, and Gail was sitting at the kitchen table, telling where she wanted things to go.
“As Sam said, it is probably nothing”, Barton hurried to explain. “I just… I kind of let SteveToo to understand that being gay is illegal and could lead to execution… But he can’t be moronic enough to really believe that, can he? I mean, this is America, not some...”
Steve had to admit that would be the case. He hadn’t had much time to think his counterpart for the last few days, getting pummeled by the superpowered megalomaniacs did that to your hospitality. “I don’t think he is faring any worse than I would be if it were our Tony in that bed.”
Maybe he was. He hadn’t even ordered to dress them in those orange jumpsuits. They were both wearing the SHIELD sweats: gray pants and white T-shirts with logos.
“Well, I had a choice between myself and you, and you know me, buddy. Always so vain, of course I chose me.”
That was from Captain Carol Danvers, the chief of security, who acted as an interrogation witness. That dirty traitor.
Both Starks turned their hopeful faces towards the other Rogers, who seemed tired of this particular way of thinking.
“I think I found him”, Sam’s voice interrupted them. And for the record, Steve had been almost as bad. Looking that other Steve strutting around annoyed him, because it made him remember how lost he had felt after waking up from the ice. Everybody he had known just a few months (seven decades) ago were dead, and he was stranded without a mission, in some strange future world full of powerful mutants and aliens who could wipe floors with vintage model supersoldiers.
It was so dark he had to consider whether his eyes were open or closed. He decided it was the former. He was not in his bathroom, though. The tiles should be smoother, and not so cold as this rough surface he was lying. Easy to deduce, it was not his bed either, not even the bedroom floor, which was covered with thick carpets. So cold, was he naked? Tony wondered that for a minute and realized he was wearing his armor for some reason. No wonder he didn’t feel well, his armor was no place to sleep, there would be no sharing the body heat with some pretty lady or exercises to keep his muscles warm. Steve, he would be such a furnace with his fast metabolism burning those calories and releasing heat…
Tony moaned. Steve had lost the orange, letting his hands continue their journey. Tony was wearing no undershirt. Steve felt his nipples tense until they were two deliciously hard pebbles. He mouthed them through Tony’s shirt while pushing his jacket down along his arms.
She had heard during the call how Tony was putting on his Iron Man armor. He was much faster now than in the beginning, this version of the armor was easier to use, but it would still take almost ten minutes for Tony to get himself ready. Then a few minutes for the flight from the Stark tower and finding Natasha. She could hide but was Steve so messed up right now he would hurt more civilians if he didn’t find her?
When the first rounds were shot, it was because Natasha had ducked the shield. The shield hit the man walking behind her, and he dropped to the ground, unconscious. Somebody shouted. A woman was seen to hold her wounded arm, and people watching the altercation started to realize that something was very wrong. The herd behavior followed, and lots of screaming and running emptied the sidewalk around them.
“No”, Janet said with a kind smile. “This is not alien tech, but actually one we have been looking for. We highly value your diligence and co-operation in this matter.”
“Enough yapping. If my uncle finds us in his garage, we are in a deep shit. Go and fetch me that circular saw. If he is not going to help himself, we will do this in a hard way.”
“Oh god”, the other Steve commended and tapped the comm device in his ear. “Tony! Armor up. We gotta go. It looks like Spider-Man is having his ass handed to him by all the animal themed big guns he has beaten up during the last years. No… Tony, I don’t mean Sinister Six… yes, I know Mysterio can… Yes, I am looking at it right now, but… No, Tony. It is definitely not a hologram, Spidey was almost run through by it… Tony, they are ripping the downtown apart, what do you want me to say to Pepper when she asks me why you didn’t get your ass out of your workshop… Yes, I will take my own ride, meet you there… no, I don’t think it will be hard to find. Alright, Tony. Cap out.”
Let’s put things in layman’s terms and say there was a blinding light. That white column of vibrating energy was invisible to everybody else than the travelers themselves, and when Steve and Tony ended their journey, it seemed like they appeared to their locations from nowhere. Why were those locations almost ten miles apart, thought they had left their universe one in the arms of the other, could be explained by reading the footnote five in the research paper Reed Richards had written with Victor von Doom when they both were freshmen in university.
As proved, he had the impulse control of a three-year-old. He pushed his hands under the pillow, a proper punishment for him to make Steve feel uncomfortable. Then he tried to watch some TV, but it was really hard to concentrate. Maybe he was getting better because he hadn’t had so insistent boner after his teenager years (his increasing alcohol consumption tampering things radically.) Yes, alcohol. He hadn’t had even one tiny drink… was it really eight days now? And if he really thought which one was more damaging…
“Hi Pepper! Yes, I know I am late from the meeting. You guessed right, I am in my bed. Yes, with Steve, but listen... Pepper, stop screaming at me! Steve and I talked and… Look, I know you have a list of suitable rehab places if I suddenly come to my senses, and… Yes, Pepper. I am alcoholic. Just like my dear old dad, but unlike him, I think I have had enough now. No, I can’t make any promises, but I want to at least try. Yes, long overdue. Pepper, please don’t… Oh God, now you started crying! Pepper, I am so sorry. I’ll call you back later. Please, buy yourself something super expensive with a company card. Bye!”
Tony was nice and loose after his tongue. Steve was still planning to take it slow, but Tony was as patient as always, pushing into his fingers and moaning like a two bit whore, except for Tony that wasn’t an act. No, Tony was not voicing his pleasure to get rid of Steve as soon as possible. His chest and face were flushed and he shivered every time Steve scissored his thick fingers inside his hole.
“Or we are copies of them”, Stark corrected, after Fury had nodded he could speak. Really, spooky. “Or we both are copies from some third party. Reed Richards of theirs, he had this interesting theory the universe would keep inside infinite amount of possibilities. That was the problem in his original equation, which he couldn’t solve. He could have sent us away, but he had no means to pinpoint the right place from those infinite possibilities, so there was no sense to risk it. Just think about it, an infinite amount of Tony Starks, flashing their genius and extremely cute butts. But as Steve said, there were differences too. Pepper and Natasha looked exactly like our Pepper and Nat, but were completely opposites as persons. Anthony Stark looked only a bit like me, but he had invented an armor almost like mine.”
Was that it? Did they want to use Steve as their weapon? Maybe that was why this sudden change of tone.
“Watcha looking?” Barton asked. The man didn’t wait for an answer, but slumped in the couch beside him, taking the controller from the table. The other Steve stood in front of a wrecked school bus, talking to the black clad SHIELD agents as a group of news people tried to get closer with their microphones. “It seems we are ready to ditch the news. Good guys won, and all that.”
A pool of sorrow and disappointment broadened inside her chest. Maybe she didn’t deserve it, but during their time in the Avengers, Steve had started to trust her. She respected him as a leader and as a man out of his own time, still keen to learn and not afraid to ask if he was confused. And what had been even more surprising, somehow during those tutoring sessions and team missions they had become real friends.
That traitorous skank! A woman who had made her cronies kill Clint Barton’s wife and kids, stood there, smiling at Steve, like Clint had never nailed her ass on the wall with his arrows.
“Hold your horses, Stark. If you are going to be like that, you are not able to handle the whole package.”
“Yes, my wife always says I will be lost in my own head if I am not careful. What happened to Reed Richards you know… it seems I have to heed her advice with more accuracy in the future.”
“Never mind. I am sure the boys told you the details about this search mission, but did anybody ask how are you holding it together? If you are anything like our Steve, you are bottling everything up, because talking and feeling are certainly two things which make even the most courageous soldiers tremble in their combat boots.”
Antonio nodded again. His lips moved, but the sound coming from his mouth was so tiny, Steve had to bend to listen, and he didn’t like what he heard. Not at all. That was Antonio all reasonable. Saying he would die anyway. Because of tumor. That Steve should go back and say… something. Lie. He was such a guy. Nobody would believe Captain America was a pansy, Tony was ready to take all the blame. Steve had been loyal to his teammate, there was no reason they wouldn’t be lenient because of that. Steve was from another world. Didn’t know their customs.
that kind of Tuesday. Curtis let out a brief scream and jumped backward so fast he bumped with Doctor Banner. The body on the metal table had taken an audible breath which ended with a coughing fit. Then it sat up and puked out seawater and few brownish slumps.
darkness, the fact that Antonio Stark pissed himself because of pain while somebody carried him here… helping, the guy had said he was helping, but it hurt, hurt so much.
“Yeah, sure. I will start, we can always rewind back to that opening scene. That is the best part of the movie… but take your time, Cap. It is just me and all those heroes of Omaha beach. All the real, real man.”
He was shaking again. God, was he any different from a homeless wino? He was just used to drink his poison from the fancy glasses, not from some paper bagged bottle at a cold street corner.
Sam made gestures like he was sawing Tony’s neck and arms. The mental image made him almost hurl. Great, probably his concussion had a concussion. He couldn’t breath more than tiny sips because of the pain, and they wanted him to raise his hand to his chest, to push the emergency switch.
He was so used to the barracks the civilian life sometimes escaped him. Maybe it was not acceptable to start changing his clothes in front of strange people, but in front of that shrinking violet of a guy it was entertaining. Banner stuttered and blushed again, ending his back toward Steve.
They had a death penalty. Of course they had, and he really wasn’t against executions like some people, sometimes he would have preferred some torture thrown into the mix. There really were many people who deserved all they got, hurting and shaming women and children was cowardly. But a public execution, in front of TV cameras? That was a bit much. Very medieval.
“Good. Now when we are all on the same page, we have to start deciding how to introduce your particularities to the media. Our PR department has some ideas, and I can discuss about them with you later. Then there is a practical question where you should live. The SHIELD personnel without residence are naturally welcomed to live in the base, but if we think your inclusion into the modern times, it would be better if you lived elsewhere. Maybe in Stark Tower with the rest of the team?”
There had been an incident last week. Fury said it was something called programming error, but Steve knew better, it had been Tony in his cups. “I have been watching the recordings of our team in action. Last week you almost killed that little girl, Tony. And I have seen dead little girls to last me a lifetime.”
“About your other question. Yes, we found the body too. He was still grasping that shield in his hand like it would be able to save his hide, the poor bastard.”
“Or then what, heroes?” Jake snorted, starting to find his bearings. “You gonna arrest us? Go ahead, you got no evidence. If you wanna do some third degree, lady gallfly, maybe you better tag-team yourself with something more intimidating than Mr. Goody Two Shoes here. Everybody knows Captain America won’t...”
“What my husband means, we need a computer model to analyze in what way those nanoparticles affected your transfer to our universe. We need your clothes to get those samples.”
“Alright”, the other Steve said, crushing the empty cigarette box. “Now when we are nicotine high about two seconds, let’s not beat the bushes. You said you had a fiancee. I knew what that would have meant for me, no secret rendezvouses in Paris or hasty hand jobs along the road. In other words: no experience with guys, and naturally not with other gals either. So... you were a bit clumsy while you were playing and then Tony was being Tony and in your post orgasmic sensitive state you took in ill.”
“Steve, darling. Nobody is going to hurt anybody. We prepare and use a ton of lube and… Let’s forget that thing for a moment. I don’t ask about Gail because I am sure she didn’t… but did Janet give you head?”
They had stopped near the metal table on which the male body was lying. It was wearing a faded uniform pants, combat boots, and a ruined leather jacket. Under those mundane items, though, there was that famous star chested uniform top Howard had designed for him. Bullet proof, or at least as much as the genius inventor from the 40s could manage. The letter A could still be seen on a bluish colored helmet, made of metal and that strange material Howard had used for the chest piece.
Yes, very silly. He was fantasizing about his teammate, shouldn’t he had leaned with his former fiancee that it wasn’t a good idea. Natasha at least had been a bro with tits, when we were now talking about a guy who had broken some drunken asshole’s nose just because he had tried to grope a feel.
“What would you know”, he hissed, throwing the towel on the bed. “A perfect hero with your perfect team and perfect family. With your nice, perfect Tony”, he added, unable to wipe bitterness out of his words.
Steve put Gail down onto the couch. Then he put his huge paw on the that tiny, frail knee of his wartime best friend and gave it a careful shake.
That was to a thirtysomething man in a SHIELD standard black uniform and a crimson cloak which covered the upper half of his face. Fury didn’t like his eyes anyway, for they were too all-knowing for his taste. As usual a mystical amulet of some ancient deity hung around Anderson’s neck. Its glowing dance of lights and shadows always gave Fury a feeling of upcoming epilepsy attack. He and Stark had one thing in common: both of them hated magic.
“Well, duty calls”, Tony said, putting down his glass. He gave a few brotherly taps on Steve’s shoulder and was gone again, mingling with these wealthy and famous people of the NYC, who ate his presence like bees ate honey. Steve had to move, or he was forced to chat with Thor who was glimpsing his way time to time. For some reason, the alien prince was the most uncomplicated of the lot. Before their abduction they had changed a few friendly words while lingering in the kitchen. Steve had warmed some milk and Thor was eating cookies: warriors and their bad dreams and insomniac ways.
Not seeing Tony made Steve like a blind man in a strip tease show. It was utterly exiting and Steve was hard again, his fangs in their full length pushing against his lower lip. Tony emerged back to the room. His feet were bare, but he was in a suit and a dress shirt, which was buttoned enough to cover his scarred chest but showing his clavicle and his strong, long neck.
At least there was that one gesture he could handle. He turned back to the TV as the rhino guy run through a brick wall. He didn’t seem to have an armor, that shell was his natural skin. That was strange, maybe he was some kind of mutation. Then there was a green winged vulture… His costume looked like the one Blackie Draco used, but this guy seemed to be a geriatric.
Steve didn’t leave Tony alone but for toilet breaks. Peeing with an erection wasn’t anything fun, so cold water it was, first for little Steve and then into his stomach. His insides still rumbled, not satisfied with liquid dinners he enjoyed from the tab. He was starting to feel nauseated and his gums inched as his mind raised pictures from the full cool cabinet, which was near but still two stores away.
After he had came out of ice, Fury had taken him to cemetery, to his parent’s graves. His brother was dead too, he had a niece who was older than him and who had not idea who he was as a person. There wasn’t anything left from his world except the flag, and Fury had acted like a greedy little boy having a surprise bag of candy. He had gorged until the bag was empty and then he had wanted some more, the SHIELD had thrown Steve into a mission after mission, and somehow every one of them seemed to be worse than the previous. It was like he was in some science experiment and a wacky doctor was testing how much he could take before he cracked. Mad cannibal supersoldiers eating each others in the abandoned Russian military base? Alright, you completed that, so how about an alien hive-minded army of robots who is going to kill all organic life on Earth and suck the planet’s core dry?
He took a catch of a little black thing which was thrown to his direction. It was a remote control. Obviously. He pushed the button, which spelled TV. Nothing happened. Obviously.
A small and fat one had pulled out a gun. He was already squeezing the trigger, but Janet wasn’t there anymore, and then a wannabe thug screamed and fell on the floor, when a painful electrical force burst from Janet’s stinger left him unconscious.
“Yeah, if my Tony were missing, neither would I be comfortable in sweats right now… I would like to be in my full gear, just in case. Here, take these.”
That gained her a tired smirk and some feeble attempts to sit up on the bed. Janet hurried to give her assistance.
“For fuck’s… look around! Hurry! This is it, our ticket to the bigger circles… genuine Stark tech garage sale… Hey Jake, did you look at this guy’s face? Only Tony fucking Stark is egocentric enough to make his bum boy have a same kind of goatee… must be wild that he can imagine to fuck himself.”
The Avengers tiptoed around Steve, which was understandable. He had tried to kill them, Romanoff even several times. After a few days they had moved Antonio from the hospital to Stark Tower, so meeting the team could not be avoided. Those meetings were fortunately brief, and most of the time he was in Antonio’s room anyway.
He could have explained it to himself he was cold. His wound was still bleeding, maybe he had lost too much blood, he was going to shock. It was that too, but it just wasn’t the whole truth, was it? It had to be at least two days, his head tried to burst through his eyes, and no pain meds to keep the feeling away. But that was only a part of it. There were other things his chemical balance was lacking too, and Steve would have said he deserved this, deserved this pain and humiliation because he had done this to himself. That stupid armor, which he couldn’t operate without a horde of tech support, his body which he had weakened during his adult years with his constant drinking, everything in him was so disgustingly weak, no wonder he was never Fury’s first choice to important missions. No wonder Steve would never…
“Never heard about them”, the other Steve confessed. “OK, Tony, get out of your armor asap. Get a shower. Everyone, meet us in the kitchen in fifteen.”
“You have them, your team. Now you got me too. You can have me. My teeth, my dick, any hole you want. Any time the graving hits you can come to me. I will make you forget those things which leave you scared and tempt you to crawl into the bottle. For a little while at last. Maybe later you can start forgetting on your own.”
But that was not the point. The point should be this new guy. Steve sniffed again, but had his nose ever lied to him. This was the man from the lab, and even if he had then hid his mousy brown hair and slim shoulders inside the doctor’s garbs, he was surely the man Steve had mistaken for a Nazi torturer and killed as he tried to escape.
Was that a trick question? “He was hurt”, he repeated. “I got his visor up and his head was in my lap when I tried to check out if he was still breathing.”
“Yes!” Jake was screaming. “Yes! I will tell, not that there is much to... We didn’t do anything to him, I swear! He was all busted up, we thought he was dead! But he wasn’t, we just helped him out of his armor and then we left him in that big green-colored house near the river!”
In spite of the horrible situation, Tony let out a spontaneous sounding giggle. “Come on, Steve. You weren’t that bad.”
Steve stuffed two bars into his mouth at the same time and wolfed down one of the sandwiches before he even lift the tray and brought it to the room. The sandwiches were similar to that one Natalia had prepared to Tony, making easy to guess who his guardian angel was. He took a hefty bites and felt how his more predatory teeth pulled back inside his gums. His eyes would take longer to look human again. The time he didn’t have. The knock had been subdued, but still loud enough to wake up Tony, who sat on the bed, blinking at Steve.
He fell back until he was able to touch the rear wall. Then he turned around and pushed his forehead against the glass, put his hands behind his back; a standard stance of prisoners everywhere. He indeed had been a captive before.
Steve wasn’t going to dignify that with a proper response. The other Steve took that as an attitude which it actually was, and retorted in kind:
“Antonio, no!” Janet shouted. The last glimpse for Janet to those tired, sad eyes, and then Antonio raised his fingers from the safety lever.
“Would you shut up, Tony! God... Why would people do such a thing? Even little children learn to use a bathroom. Strangling… I would never. I know how strong I am, Tony. I would never do anything to hurt you, not even in a playful way. It was too horrible when I… when we…”
He pushed Tony on his back on the mattress, which made Tony’s legs rise up to his shoulders like he was really an automation he played to be. No rookie, indeed. Steve teased him with a shallow pushes, which made those nerves just behind the rim shot out a constant pleasing sensations. No fireworks, not yet, maybe never, because all guys weren’t able to feel it like that, deep inside. Steve should know. He was one of those unlucky numb ones, but if he thought about it rationally, perhaps three layered pleasure would have been too much to handle even for son of Cain. He had his dick and his teeth, and those sensations which went through him when he penetrated the skin with his fangs and sucked trembling, sweating being under his mouth, he wouldn’t change even to the best ones of those other fireworks.
Then there was something. Just behind the shelves which were rammed full of old and smelly cardboard boxes. What was that? A hidden door?
Tony and Steve were teammates. Friends. They could stand this close. Or was this too close? Or too far, so it looked unnatural and stated they had something to hide? And don’t even start about the touching.
“Shouldn’t this be the place?” he asked, when Janet didn’t repeat her unnecessary and nosy question. “Why isn’t that thing doing anything?”
“Brother Monster, I don’t understand what that means”, Thor said, when Steve peppered him with the questions. “I don’t understand your agitation. There is always a war going on. I have fought in hundreds of wars during hundreds of years in all the worlds of nine realms. One is no different from the other. Only the honor matters. We fight with honor and skill to avoid the bony grip of Hela, Loki’s grim daughter, Mistress of the Underworld. After we die, we go Valhalla instead. Here. Sit! Take more mead!”
The other Steve looked at him through the smoke his eyes squinted. Maybe it was indeed because of smoke but probably not.
“I heard enough. What the hell now, Clint? I came to introduce myself to our guest and… Have you lost your everloving mind? If that was supposed to be a joke, it was so extremely bad taste I don’t find the words! You know there are still countries where shit like that can really happen.”
“Oh crap”, was Sam’s opinion when they loped up the stairs and to the lobby. The elevator looked like it had worked the last time during the First Gulf War. After the door closed behind them, they were almost in the complete darkness. Steve went to the window and smashed away the cover made of mold infested board and pieces of tarpaulin. It gave them some light, but didn’t help much with the reek of decay which surrounded them like a cloud of poison gas. “Tony, this place is a shithole. You said this guy is wounded. We should call SHIELD medics.”
Maybe it was not only his head that was hurting. He felt that something was wrong with his ribs too. His armor protected him nicely against anything, but those Mechanoids must have been new models, because one of them penetrated the hip joint of his armor as easily as a man would push his hand through the surface of water.
The other Steve hushed them. God, he wouldn’t hope his Barton’s faith even to his worst enemy, to lose his family like that was down right horrible, but why didn’t the archer just shut up! He really didn’t understand how anybody could be that dishonorable… like those damn Russians. It had been so strange. Before he had gotten into the ice, the Russians had been their trusted allies. Now they were not. Their Romanoff had despised all that was American, accusing them for her nation’s demise.
It didn’t take long after that. The door opened, and there was the pretty fella from the wall. His smell was familiar too, and first Steve thought it was because this was Howard’s son. But it wasn’t that. They didn’t smell anything alike.
“Unlike the son of Howard Stark”, he derided. “Who just have to cover what he is doing from his superiors.”
Tony started to pull off his shirt. His hands shook badly, maybe it was tumult of his mind or pure tiredness of his body, but Steve decided the situation had been going on long enough.
“Why… he is a cold-hearted son of a bitch who doesn’t care of casualties when he does his science thingies. I have met urban terrorists who have more honor and morals than Reed fucking Richards. Why would he care about our problems? You trust him, and believe me, something horrible will happen.”
“Tony… uh, no. We have sometimes common science projects, he and I, but for the SHIELD he is only a part-time civilian consultant. Not Director Fury’s favorite, I am afraid. And now, after his little stunt... No, Tony will not be here for a long time.”
Rogers wasn’t Natasha Romanoff’s greatest fan, and Fury knew the matter bothered the super soldier. Black Widow of the Avengers universe had done nothing wrong against him or Antonio, it was the other way around. She had been a great friend. Or would have tried to be, if Rogers had let her. He if anybody was an obvious case of guilty conscience.
“Sorry, pal”, Tony asked while lifting Steve into the air by the net handles. “We usually move together more comfortably, but I don’t want to let you so near that you can rip off something from my armor and make it malfunction.”
“Tony, shut up! Listen, Steve is having some kind of melt-down. He attacked me in the middle of the street...”
“It is pretty, but not an apple worth of Iðunn, the Goddess of Youth, the keeper of the golden apples of Asgard. Here! Take more of this fine wine, Warrior Monster! I like a man who can drink his share.”
Now that Captain was talking they saw something was very wrong with his teeth also. An animalistic fear shot along Fury’s spine. He should open his damn mouth and start assuring this Twilight Zone version of their national icon he was in the good old USA. They were all friends here, and not like… prey?
“I a-always knew, Rogers. U-under that... hard e-exterior t-there is a... b-big fluffy romantic. T-too bad… o-our s-story i-is R-Romeo and J-Juliet k-kind...”
Steve didn’t know the man. Literally. He didn’t even know his first name, was about to ask for it. It would have been nice to have something to scream aloud, but then the wall started making noises of its own.
“Absolutely sure”, Tony nodded. “We moved all the tech and weapons to my workshop in Stark Tower or the SHIELD armory. There is nothing but surplus furniture and housewares. And I checked the alarms twice. There is no breach before Mr. Battling Ram broke our gate and front door. If they have moved something from their universe to ours, it is not in the mansion. It is perfectly safe.”
“Birdy bird, you probably recognized that handsome face… Alright. Now when everybody is on board… Nat, floor it. One minute to the first drop, people. Tony, you take Clint. Sam is with me. You…” the other Steve said, nodding at him, “with Janet. I hope that is alright with you. You two can take this one. Prepare yourselves… and Janet, careful. Don’t assume he will react as I would. The same goes for you, SteveToo. Remember, you just met a few minutes ago.”
“Frag coming from ten o’clock!” Steve stated to his comm. Everybody not protected with a high-tech armor took cover.
The man opened his jumpsuit and took something small and pinkish from his chest. It was a tiny piglet.
“Yes, only in the USA… You found yourself bad in the sack and try to turn it into a political debate”, the other Steve mocked him. “Hey! But your fists fucking down, soldier, or I will throw you from this roof and then we can really see how well our system heals broken bones.”
“I hope I didn’t take your favorite”, he said politely. What he wanted to ask was of course about Antonio, but maybe if he waited after some chitchat and breakfast he would gain better results. He was not very patient and smooth person to begin with and even less so when hungry.
Their prisoner was still sleeping and it pissed Fury off for some reason. Maybe the thing was pretending.
The wall grew silent only at nights and to give him bathroom breaks and time to eat. He wondered how long it would go until it halted.
Maybe that had been a mistake of his old, foolish hart. “Son of a bitch”, Fury mumbled, looking at the sight below him in the lab. He had read Rogers and Stark’s report, interrogated them himself, but seeing this with his own eye was still spooky.
He let out a shivering gasp of breath, hoping that the other Steve wouldn’t notice. But when was the last time he had been so lucky?
The uniform felt like it was glued to his skin by sweat and blood and that odd substance those Mechanoids had leaked all over them. Fifteen minutes was too much time to wait, but too little time to soak himself free. He ended up cleaning his face and hands. The bathroom was warm, and his eyelids began to droop with weariness but he yanked them open, rubbed away the green goo, which made his fingers glitter in the light. It felt partly like he was rubbing away Antonio himself, and the feeling of anxious displacement made him bite his teeth harder together.
“That’s right folks. Not naked and covered with goo anymore. Much more comfortable for my naughty bits this one.”
Steve’s statement was sealed with a kiss and the spontaneous applaud of the people around them. Someone hollered. Sounded like Thor.
It was stupid and it didn’t help anything. But he wouldn’t have been himself if he hadn’t even tried to sink his fist into his counterpart’s face. That went as well as all of his doings had recently worked out, except the other Steve didn’t throw him from the roof as he had promised.
Tony looked in his tuxedo like a candy in a stick. And Steve was sure he didn’t look so bad either. Antonio Stark was supposed to be a lecherous idiot. Nobody would consider it odd Tony was checking him out. Or something like that Steve tried to tell himself.
“Well”, the other Steve said, taking a long pull from his cig. “I can’t know about that… It took the SHIELD and Fury almost eight months before they even started to think I could be let to the field. There were psych evals which lasted for days, and after those I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Tony invented some pump thing which they needed to regulate my massive doses of antidepressants. I am alright now, but just thinking about it… that was a drag. Then when I was finally able to pull my head out of my ass, it was weeks after weeks videos and books and lectures and practices how to live in the modern society. Not just technical stuff, but… You know.”
“What are you?” his visitor mused. “You are not a mutant. Whatever they mean by that. They made a test with your blood and it came back as negative. Whatever that means. I don’t understand most of the things they do; this magic they call science is so different from mine. So, Warrior Monster! Are you a stranger in this realm like me? Did you came here from outer space or some unholy dimension?”
“Yes, it was that also… but fortunately my mam was such a lady, and I had a friend. A real shining knight. Bucky.”
“You can keep using my facilities.” The other Steve had moved to walk by his side, as if expecting him to collapse in any minute now, which wasn’t very far from the truth.
Bucky’s bushy eyebrows climbed to his hairline as he caught a glimpse of their solemn faces. “Sorry, dear. I didn’t mean to spook you. I didn’t forget. I am just teasing him. But tell Steve, who was the best man? Was it that other Bucky?”
“How much do you really know about Project Rebirth?” Stark was saying. “We should compare notes. There could be some clues in my father’s archive. Maybe all they did for Rogers was to give him an unbelievable healing factor and custom made tiger teeth.”
She didn’t turn around, but continued watching his eating through the monitor screen. It was a slow process. A half spoon and a sip of milk, then he put the food down. Pushed it away. That seemed not to be enough, so he stepped from the table to the other side of the cell. He had repeated the process again and again. She had been looking at him almost three hours.
The man on the wall was upset about his crying? Wait a minute! How could film people see what he was doing?
The door closed. He was left alone in the good-sized and comfortable looking room, so unlike his own dreary residence in Brooklyn. Not this Brooklyn, if this universe had that neighborhood, but… He had a fleeting thought what he would lose if they got stuck in here, and it wasn’t much. Not for him anyway. Antonio, though, would be pissed off. No luxurious penthouse or silken dressing gowns or anything nice he had used to take for granted. Only what these stranger were ready to give them.
“If you are having second thoughts, Tony, now would be a good moment to mention about it”, Steve whispered in strangled tones. “When I’m balls deep inside your sweet tight ass, sucking you, I will become a bit grumpy for a while if I have to stop straight away.”
Steve had heard a faint hissing sound as the door closed behind Natalia. He could now focus fully on Tony. There was that panicky smell again and a heartbeat he had heard from inside the robot which now stood without its arms besides the wall. Steve peaked in through the arm hole. “I thought a robot should be full of… I don’t know… cogwheels?”
“Yes, Stark tech is very famous and very desired… In the black market somebody could make a pretty penny out of the parts of your friend’s armor. Mr. Anderson’s nephew, he has a record. Assaults, but receiving too, so he will be a likely candidate. Tony gave me his home address. We could start there.”
“And me”, Tony chuckled. “Engaged to Nat? I would never! That would be like… I mean, that would certainly be
“Look at this… all this for little old me to taste and prowl… so beautiful. Like a piece of art. If I had a block of marble I would sculpt you like that, and… You like that I praise you, don’t you?”
The other Steve was now shaking his head. “No there is not. We still don’t know what those are. But if this Antonio was as badly hurt as you suspect, we have no time to waste. Let’s hope that the Richards family is on Earth.”
Thor’s grand gesture was interrupted when they realized the fight hadn’t left any unbroken furniture.
Then it all crashed back into his mind. Mechanoids! They had been fighting... Where was Steve? Was he hurt too? Tony tried to call his teammate, but his dry mouth let out only faint, raspy sounds. He tried again and now he succeed better, but nobody answered.
One of Fury’s bullets had penetrated the cheekbone. They watched as it popped out and was yanked off all the way. Then the thing raised its inhuman gaze to the deck window and stared right at them even if Stark had turned the glass into those one-way mirrors the interrogation rooms favored.
“They left him in the lobby near the elevator. Let’s hope the process didn’t include any actual body dumping. There was some guy sitting in the middle of the stairs… No more details, because after that Mr. Bad Cop broke the suspect’s arm and he passed out. Is there lots of people? Maybe we should have asked him to draw us a picture. If he can draw as good as you…”
“Your gift seems to be badly received”, Fury continued. “It will take a few days we can try that synthetic blood Bruce is testing.”
For his surprise, this Janet was now giving him an apologetic look, as if thinking she had gone too far or being too familiar. The latter, he noticed, when she continued talking.
They drink and ate, and even if Steve stayed quiet, that was not the way of Thor. He told him about his battles with blue-skinned frost giants, who lived in the world made of ice, and his adventures in the fiery lands of Muspelheim, and when he had enough to drink he started to talk about his family. There was his step-brother, Loki, the God of Lies. His father Odin, to whom his both sons had been disappointments. His team of warriors back home, his friends, before his father banished him to Midgard, to prove his worthiness. Ha! How to find his own worthy in this place, when most of these Midgardians didn’t know honor if it sat on their faces. Double ha! Joke was on Thor, son of Odin.
“What do you mean?” Clint said, whitening under his mask. “The doctors said he was recovering fine. It can’t be that...”
The family might fight. Its members could disagreed. Still the pack loved and protected each others. It was then too bad he and Antonio were not part of the Avenger family, so when they fought and got bruised, and bones were broken and inconvenient truths were said aloud, they knew there was no love involved. Not even cautious interest anymore.
He was very careful not to change the rhythm of his steps. Only his shoulders tensed, shivers going down his spine. He hadn’t forgotten those gay executions Barton had mentioned. The archer’s gleeful tone had been something he had witnessed only while dealing with the villains who had serious mental issues.
There was once a girl with red hair. A girl who danced fiercely like a flame and gracefully like a swan. Like any other girl, she thought the sky wasn’t her limit, it was her stepping stone and she could be anything in this big wide world.
It took all his self-control not to wreck the place. Only thought about how him loosing it wouldn’t help Antonio kept him at bay. Janet seemed to sense his state of mind, because she didn’t come closer but stayed near the garage door.
Antonio was starting to be fine, actually. Little tired still, but the wound in his abdomen hadn’t been as deep as they had first thought and his other injuries were healing as expected. He just felt… he missed his fancy drinks, but doctors had said he couldn’t drink while taking the meds and they had then given him more meds that he wouldn’t miss his drinks so much. Or something. Steve didn’t quite understand that whole thing and Antonio didn’t want to talk about it. Of course he didn’t flat refuse Steve’s questions, but the way he dodged them was quite telling.
Tony felt himself sinking into the strange, half-wake state. He should think about his situation, which normally would have made alarm bells ring in his mind, but his brain seemed to stuck in that lonely thought about Steve. He had sometimes wondered what made him so alluring. Well, Steve was fit, and Tony had this anything pretty goes, but besides that. Yes, there was something else than those abs and pecs and a body which wouldn’t have to be ashamed in comparison to some Ancient demigod. On the surface it seemed they had nothing in common. Steve was a storybook hero with a strict moral code. He was so… good all the time. Or if Steve wasn’t, he tried to be. He didn’t always have the answers, or he thought the answer was his fist in somebody’s face. Maybe that was it, that old-fashioned way of putting things in order, very much black and white way of thinking, which was so exotic in a modern world which saw only shades of gray.
Right. That was it. Fury took the microphone. “Listen up la… kids”, he said and the crew turned their faces towards the mirror window. “Yeah, yeah, happy to meet the bunch of yahoos who turned our national hero so kissy feely it should be illegal, but I have some real work to do. If you leave the compound, register yourselves first with Captain Danvers, our chief of security. Play nice. Or else.”
“No?” Stark quirked his eyebrow, giving him a knowing smile. “It took you last time little less than a princess and half the kingdom to agree.”
It was a bag, for god’s sake. There was no reason for him to have a bad feeling about it, when the guy giving it to them didn’t look like a suicide bomber. But then the screen of the locator went crazy with all those blinking lights and she opened the zipper and he saw…
Steve couldn’t help it. He started laughing. “Yes, your father’s deal with me”, he uttered after damming up most of his mirth. “And your esteemed, dealing with the devil father is still alive and well, I presume. Enjoying his eternal life, isn’t he?”
Maybe it was Steve. He was the problem. He had never been the most social person in the world, and this bunch. Their introductions hadn’t exactly gone smoothly, Steve had literally killed one of them. He didn’t like Barton’s attitude and couldn’t trust Romanoff. Banner wasn’t much of a conversationalist and Thor was that too much.
The time stood still or perhaps it run too fast. Steve was sure he would pass out of pleasure from the double feelings of his gums and dick, and he was relieved when a smell and noises of Tony’s orgasm finally pushed him from the edge.
“No, I bet they don’t”, Steve admitted. “They are right about it though. He was a bad man. Murdered his own brother.”
The man seemed first taken aback, but it didn’t last long. That smile just jerked a bit more the corner of his mouth, showing Steve a flash of those perfect teeth.
He didn’t come any closer. He was still sitting on the floor, in the same place. But he felt closer nevertheless, and her back was pushed tightly against the door. She couldn’t back off an inch, even if she had wanted to.
“Don’t keep eyeballing me like you have accidentally bitten a lemon instead of orange and found it rotten. I potty trained our Steve in the modern western values myself. I see your Janet hasn’t still finished her job.”
“Awww, he has looked at your eyes”, Barton was simpering, making kissy faces towards Tony. “You could ditch that little list of yours and just say your dream-Tony is more handsome than our reality here.”
She listened and then a small, sharp smile jerked the corner of her mouth. “Yes… Give us the nephew. I have a hunch, and I think Steve would appreciate to talk with him himself.”
“Good boy, not leaving me to race the stairs like the last time! Move that America’s ass… oh god, so sorry. It is you.”
So started the twitter war of the decade. A social media tsunami, which rolled around ordinary people as well as politicians and influential celebrities. There were congratulations, from private people and organizations. There were demands that Steve Rogers should step aside as a leader of the Avengers. Anything any people had even thought in his or her mind was said aloud, for and against. But one, maybe insignificant tweet among all that political, cultural, and historical heavy talk which was later analyzed by social science researchers, stuck into Steve’s brain and he remembered it now, while looking at Tony, so near but still over his reach.
Basic math, then. That wouldn’t have consoled Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America, who had felt his teammate and friend, Antonio Stark, to vanish from him lap, leaving behind smudges of blood and green goo Tony used to function his armor. Really, some nerdy theories of the universe were as far from Steve’s thoughts as chocolate, even if appearing in the front steps of a delicacy shop in Manhattan usually made a person focus on delights of his stomach. Steve was frantic, though. Tony’s visor broken and his lungs making that horrible rattling sound had told him his teammate’s armor had malfunctioned badly. And those Mechanoids were still firing at them when…
Banner nodded. “How do you do it? Is it meditation? Some other spiritual form? It sometimes looked like you were praying. Is that it? Faith? I was just wondering, could it be something you can maybe teach me.”
That gray jumpsuit was too big for her fragile frame. Or maybe it was too big to make her look that way. Her pretty red hair, only stubble left. Fresh bruise on her left cheek, bleeding.
Lots of maps, soldiers, airplanes, and people talking. Great offensives Steve had participated, but hadn’t understood in their whole meaning. Then finally, there were surrendering German soldiers. The Soviet flag flew over the
