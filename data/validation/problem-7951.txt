He eagerly accepted the distraction, relieved to be thinking of anything else after the hamster wheel his thoughts had been stuck in all day. “Oh, sure, now that it worked it’s *
fresh or frozen!” Steve looked perplexed and uncomfortable at the flirtatious tone.
“Tony, I’m serious, this is the first conversation I’ve had since I died.”
“Well, you’re lucky to have never seen him.”
“Wow. Scoliosis and arrhythmia, the anemia. They’re all here. Steve, do you realize what this means?”
“What? No, I meant, if I didn’t know something you just told me, something I just verified from the paperwork, that means you aren’t a figment of my imagination!”
“It’s been almost 70 years. Howard’s been dead and gone for decades now, too. Aunt Peggy is still alive. Lives here in the States now.”
“I was living on borrowed time already, it’s all too fitting I was in a borrowed body, too? And ironic I’d linger on even without a body, now?”
When his eyes skated back away to the glass, Tony looked to see that Fury and Coulson had started walking away from the window, probably to come join them in the room. Steve met his eyes again, and this time his full smile bloomed. Tony’s face ached already from his huge answering grin.
Ready or not, he was out of time and distance, finally, between him and Steve. Pausing one final moment at the swinging medical doors, Tony tried to paste back on his self-confidence for this last bit. He was fairly certain Steve would wake up, one way or another, after he walked through those doors; he could feel it, in his soul, if he did in fact still have one of those. And after all, all he’d done was guarantee Steve a choice, one he might not otherwise have been afforded right away. And if Steve wanted to stay, fine, and Tony’s lost bet would keep him in Steve’s orbit for a bit longer while he worked through Fury’s honey-do list. Even if Steve didn’t want to be friends with him now, once he’d have actual choices in who to talk to, Tony could still keep an eye out to be sure he was safe, and adapting well, and not being frogmarched into some sinister black-ops task out of a manipulated sense of duty.
Fury’s aggrieved sigh could’ve nearly lasted the entire length of their subsequent walk to the observation deck, overlooking a sterile medical room, centered around a man surrounded by monitoring machines and asleep in a hospital bed.
At the elevator, he scanned a keycard he’d managed to swipe from the group that had swarmed his car, very clumsy of them to let him bump into several of them on the way, and finally took a moment to actually hesitate. Breaking into SHIELD, the servers or the buildings themselves, was relatively standard fare for him, practically expected, and he’d hate to let Fury down in successfully complicating his life with those restrained incursions--
“Situation normal, then, you’re saying?”
The briefest flash of irritation swept Coulson’s face, as he pretended to motion Tony in the same direction Tony had already started briskly striding, towards Fury’s office.
Well.
Arms crossed, Fury half turned away from the windows. “The medical team is still reviewing our options from here. Your dad’s Vita-Ray tech is top of the list for next attempts, if he doesn’t wake up on his own soon. I’m sure they have a countdown clock of their own, but I should have expected to need one too, as soon as we found something you’d find interesting enough to deign to drop by for.”
Tony pondered this for a moment. “Where, J?”
“Yes, I understand. That must have been lonely.”
He’d never held his heart in his hands, and he’d, frankly, always considered that a silly turn of phrase, even after spluttering up from the tepid water during the torture in the cave, literally clutching in his dirtied and bloodied hands the sparking car battery protecting his heart and keeping him alive. But holding Steve’s shield now, and waiting nervously for him to show, felt an awful lot like that. Like a time-bomb balanced in his hands, while he waited and paced, and swallowed back the fear and swallowed down the alcohol.
Tony was rummaging through the boxes and found a medical file. “Okay, I don’t remember ever looking at this before. It looks like it’s your intake forms. So, here, before I read it, I remember Dad mentioning you had asthma and bad hearing, bad eyesight. What else would you have listed, once Erskine actually took you on?”
“Well. Thank you for telling me, Steve.” He couldn’t resist making a joke, to ease the tension. “I guess the hereafter is as good a time to come out of the closet as any. Sorry, maybe that doesn’t translate, I mean--”
Tony narrowed his eyes. “No nose?”
Would Steve have any conscious memory of Tony? Would he regret their connection, once Tony wasn’t the only person around to talk to?
Tony let the words hang for a moment, and then nodded. “I’ve got a friend like that. Rhodey. We didn’t grow up together, like you two, but we’ve been family most of our lives anyway. He and I were overseas together, and I was kidnapped, and tortu--other things happened. It’s...damn, it’s recent enough I really don’t talk about it, I’m not sure I’ll ever talk about it. But I thought I was gonna die there, waiting for him to rescue me, trying to rescue myself, and it was a hell of a thing to see him again, after I’d escaped, and he found me in the desert.”
He wished he had someone to call. No, he wished he had
, or something like it, but after all, some of science could be described as making the most of what was already known, even if the processes were as of yet inexplicable. So if he left the background processes of his mind running the problem through on a loop, at least he didn’t let it interfere with his more pressing concerns. Like the current planned upgrade to the Iron Man suit he was showing to Steve, on actual paper blueprints.
Fury steepled his hands and quietly glared at Tony. “Do you know,” he began deliberately, “I let myself hope we might get a few day’s peace before you stormed in here. Shall we dispense with all the bluster, and you tell me how much you know so far?” His eye had slid over to Coulson as he’d talked, and Tony sensed they were still feeling out exactly how much they could hoodwink him.
“Mmm, good thing my manners have always been openly acknowledged as deficient then, don’t you think? And you know what else is deficient: your documentation on my father’s Vita-Rays, so I’d say I’m right on time. No, no, actually” and here he whisked open Fury’s door to see him seated calmly, waiting. “I’d say I’m inexcusably late. Fury, your lackey here is slacking, and I received no engraved invitation at all to this thrilling event. Slackey, say you’re sorry.”
Snuggling deeper into his arms, Tony tried to focus on Steve’s steady breathing, and ignore the growing weight of consciousness. Steve was warm and comfortable under Tony’s cheek, and he resisted waking up as intently as he could. There was some slow-building discomfort distracting him from the critical task of sleeping off the previous night, and he was increasingly aware of the fatigue in his limbs. Mostly, he could feel a creeping sense of a chill growing more and more noticeable, and a nearly painful tension in his muscles. Bleeding edges of fear and panic, bright lights, pressure in his lungs, and Steve shouting his name, no, his own name? No, Steve shouting Tony’s name, but someone else insistently repeating Steve’s name, and what the hell? Abruptly the sensory inputs cut out, dream over, apparently, and Tony jerked awake, disgruntled and unsettled from the dream.
Sometime later, Tony swiped at his tired eyes and read back from his hastily scribbled notes.
“--Steve Rogers, yeah, I know.”
Modern, no powers, and 2k words with lots of so-bad-they're-great pick-up lines, for the prompt 'bad flirting':
“Huh.” Tony swiveled the stool, bumping into the lab table, and traced the scores and scorch marks on the metal from previous projects. Something about the dream, or not-dream, or waking nightmare, or whatever it was, lingered on in his mind. A feeling of cold, the weight of foreboding. God, he was getting dramatic again.
Captain America straightened up, from where he’d leaned closer.
Steve scoffed. “Of course I’m real. I said I was a ghost, didn’t I? Matter of fact, I asked if
“Multiple access points, Sir. Including log-ins from the Arctic, Sir.”
“--you’re absolutely right, Cap, I’ll be sure to spread my vulgarity and blasphemy out a bit more.”
to talk to. It was a poor time to realize how in over his head he was already, in this complicated connection he had with a long-dead soldier. Like some sort of bizarre Nicholas Sparks novel. So maybe his best bet would be to call Pepper and try to spin this as a story he’d read, or imagined, or something. She liked this sort of star-crossed romance nonsense. Ugh, and now he’d literally used the word
have. But: scoliosis, arrhythmia, pernicious anemia, flat fee…--”
Steve shrugged again, and smirked. “Yeah, the name ‘The Red Skull’ was very literal. A little too
Jarvis waited a moment before continuing, a touch slower and quieter. Tony felt coddled, but all too grateful, regardless, for the moment to gather himself to be able to listen past the rush of adrenaline.
Tony let the highball glass trail idly from his fingertips as he slowly meandered through the room. He reluctantly set it down on a storage box finally, when it was moments from falling from his grasp and shattering. His father’s study had probably seen enough splashed liquor and shattered glass. He wasn’t sure if he could remember the last time he’d been in this room with his father. Odds were good he was as drunk then, in his reckless college years, as his father near-perpetually was, at home. Bitterly drunk, the elder, and brutally drunk, the younger, but the Starks had a long history of alcoholic self-medication.
Steve had followed him readily enough when he’d walked out of the study now and then, but the vast majority of their time was spent in the study, which meant less technological access. Unrelated fact, tangential, hardly worth mentioning, but...Jarvis wasn’t available in the study. Tony had tried not to look too closely at his motives there, in leaving him out of that room when retrofitting the mansion. He wasn’t sure if it was his father’s enormous presence in the room, as a sort of inviolate time capsule, or Tony’s occasional depressing binges, that made Jarvis seem an unwelcome addition there, but it was easy enough to ignore.
, Tony thought as he gave a small smile and reminded himself to stay calm. Steve’s answering smile was equally weak, but he also gave an almost imperceptible nod, and Tony felt his smile growing.
Time passes, and for two people separated by time and space and the afterlife and literal sheets of ice, they're getting closer everyday.
Here are the two Steve/Bucky stories I've written before, to placate you, since they aren't together in this story at all:
the appropriate nomenclature, maybe you guys only trick people because you don’t like how we talk about you. Do you trick people? I’ll bet that’s a negative inaccurate stereotype too, I feel like I’m muddling this, am I?”
“Makes sense. My dreams were especially therapy-worthy last night, from what I remember.”
Pausing in the middle of the observation deck, Tony tossed over his shoulder, “So how’s he doing so far, Slackey?”
He cleared his throat, and finding the remaining tension from the dream still strangling him, cleared it again. He aimed for the artificially upbeat tone that would have pained Pepper and annoyed Rhodey, but which his programming was predisposed to overlook. “Jarvis, what are the happy-haps today, my code-alicious friend?”
ghost though, y’know.”
Tony interjected, “Listen, I know you’ve got a laundry list a mile long of tech you want me to review and/or invent from scratch for you. Meanwhile I’ve got an interest in liberty and personal freedoms, et cetera et cetera, so I’ll make you a deal. He leaves with me, if he wants to, and if not, then Christmas came early for you this year, but the presents are gonna be labeled from Stark, not Santa.”
even recognizing, as he did, what a poor coping strategy his idle musing was to keep from worrying.
But Steve had said, in what was a profoundly disappointing explanation to Tony’s scientific mind, that while he wasn’t necessarily aware of time passing while he was away, and while he hadn’t particularly planned any of his previous trips while in this twilight awareness, the shield would sometimes shimmer in his memories and he could follow it to Tony’s study.
The beam of light was so delicate as to seem unreal, and even through his hangover, or lingering drunkenness, Tony squinted at the ethereal glow with a scientist’s eye. A scientist’s bleary red and scratchy dry eye, but still. The apparition in the beam walked directly towards him, a man, angelic with his blond hair haloed in the light, but human with his confused expression and muddy boots. Tony’s first conscious thought was relief that he’d realized what made the glow so unreal: it was the contradicting highlights and shadows, light seemingly pooled and draped rather than obeying any natural laws.
. I already thought he sounded freaky, when I was a kid, but I don’t think Howard ever mentioned that detail in the bedtime stories. I would’ve remembered.”
He held the shield and paced the study, trying to ignore the uneasy feeling he had. Steve would appear in just a moment, and maybe Tony could jokingly ask if he’d caught him at a bad time, was he in the middle of a shower when he’d called. A meteor shower, maybe, up in the stars where he probably lived. Ugh, now he was waxing poetic, he needed to snap out of it.
A day or two went by, spent in fevered activity in the lab, tinkering and inventing, by turns frantic and inspired, but eventually, he ended up stumbling back into the study again. He immediately picked up the discarded shield and sunk into the overstuffed armchair, staring at the unlit fireplace, feeling everything and nothing. It was both a relief and a concern to see the apparition again fairly quickly, once he had apparently sunk into a waking dream.
Tony drifted off to sleep with the shield still on his arm, and his memories tangled up in thinking about Captain America and how shields are designed to protect far more than to attack, and what a different and defensive view of Captain America that would be compared to the rampaging patriotic god Howard had seemed to describe.
a brain anymore.”
“He was a ghost though too, right? You’re not saying it was him, back from the dead?”
Tony couldn’t help laughing, a weak muffled chuckle from his slumped position, chin to chest. Even the figments of his imagination had existential crises, it was too perfect.
Somewhere along the way, Steve had become a near-daily necessity. Tony had found Steve in the study often enough, and eventually they’d found that Steve could be summoned if Tony held the prototype shield--
Wrists crossed at his lower back, Tony considered his options now. Steve seemed the very picture of health, and all the readouts appeared to confirm that assessment. Steve had seemed panicked and afraid in the brief moments of connection before Tony had fully woken up, which, if one assumed that wasn’t a dream, might indicate Steve had made a sudden and unaided connection to Tony’s mind at the moment he was being awoken. The fact that the techs said he hadn’t been conscious yet would seem to contradict that, but then again--
“And you can just say that? It’s not-- that is, it isn’t…?”
“Wait-- I didn’t know that.”
the Riot Act while
“Okay, so, you remember the plane going down, and the icy cold water--” He winced in sympathy as he saw Steve visibly tense from the reminder, especially after how halting his telling of that portion of the story had been.
Coulson turned another screen toward Tony, showing earlier footage, sped up, of a man in a saltwater tank, hooked up to wires and slowly defrosted, until, with a blur of fast forwarded activity, scientists and medical techs transferred him to the bed in the room below.
were hacking in and setting those up.”
Tony paced back over to the screens to watch the monitoring readouts as the time-lapse video looped. There were a few spikes, and after all, Steve had impeccable control, by all accounts, so perhaps he’d feigned sleep and intentionally lowered his respiratory rate and heartbeat, trying to gain time. Shock, tinged with fear, was the last thing Tony remembered from their brief interrupted connection earlier that day; maybe he was afraid of who’d found him, and was biding his time.
“Can you bring him back to the Tower so Dr. Cho can look over him?” Steve asked and slipped Peter in Tony’s hold.
Steve rolled his eyes but, when his eyes landed back onto Tony’s, his eyes sparkled like the ocean on a sunny day. Steve whispered, “Then I will just have to make you happier than you are now every day.”
Tony groaned loudly into Steve’s chest. He stopped swaying and whispered, “We’ll continue this later…” Tony turned to Bucky but stayed connected to Steve with through a lightly clasped hand and by leaning into his side.
Everything – everyone – he knew…what had happened to them?
Finally got a Tony POV in this chapter! Yay! :D
He blinked in surprise at the notice and Natasha’s grip strangled the pistol.
At first, it was glorious. The fetuses were growing and showing signs of being more evolved than everyday-humans. He thought he had finally done it, he had finally found the key to solving the mystery of the Super Soldier serum.
May stepped up to the side of the bed to bring Peter closer to his side.
Steve and Tony exchanged smirks and Steve replied, “No, but this winter I am going to marry the love of my life.”
He didn’t think it was possible but Steve grew redder.
“Th-Thank you,” Steve replied.
,” he groaned.
“I know,” Cable replied, his rough voice a little softer in that moment. “We’re going to rebuild it.”
He did not answer any of their questions after reading his statement.
Tony frowned at him and venomously asked him, “Why? Are you ashamed?
of doing this…” Tony met his eyes and pointedly told him, “Steve, you are good and anyone who says differently is an absolute liar.”
With a painful hiss, Tony forced himself to sit up. His muscles protested at the movement and all of his wounds felt ten times more painful. He was gasping for breath and he whispered, “Jarvis, amplify my voice for a moment…I’m fine, Steve!” Tony said, his voice louder thanks to Jarvis. “Keep that guy off me! I’ve got to put in the chip!” Steve nodded, though he was clearly clenching his jaw in upset, and focused his attention back on the Soldier. Tony scanned the area and asked, “Where’s the chip, J?”
He understood why Pepper and the rest of the media relations team would want to keep it under wraps that Peter was born from an affair with a married woman…it would put them in a bad light.
He had no idea how he was going to tell May that Peter was missing and had been taken by an alien symbiote which had nearly killed
“Ugh,” Peter groaned. “Don’t word it like that…”
“If you ever need me,” Bucky whispered, turning his head slightly so that Steve could almost make out the side of his face’s profile. “Hang a red cloth from the western point of the Tower and I will come.”
Tony sat up sharply, gasping for breath, and fearfully reaching to side to make sure…
“That settles it. We’re throwing you a party here, one your friends
With his semen, however, they had impregnated five women and infused the fetuses with gamma-radiated DNA. Peter was the only survivor and had been infused with spider, gamma-radiated DNA. With SHIELD’s shut down, its rebuilding, and Hydra being flushed out, Peter was discovered. Agent Hill had notified Steve as soon as she was positive Peter was really his son.
Tony smiled that smile he reserved for Steve alone and, all these years later, the butterflies still fluttered in his stomach at the sight.
“Subject A?” Peter suggested slyly.
Steve looked to the holo and stared at the blank expression on Mary’s face.
Steve entire body jolted from the shocking statement. He stomach churned nervously as he regarded this powerful beast and he feared for Peter. What if this thing had gotten a hold of him?
! You're not a fuck up! You are the smartest person I have ever met and that's including your father!...You're just purely amazing! I – I know it feels like the end of the world right now but you'll get through this. All the pressures from losing your parents to taking on your father’s responsibilities with the company, they'll lessen overtime as you get stronger.”
Howard already saw him, revealing a little more of the future wouldn’t hurt.
“Was that what you two were talking about yesterday?” Steve asked with a half-smile.
He smothered his mouth with a hand to keep himself from laughing anymore but…it was all just so amazingly ridiculous, he couldn’t help but laugh.
“Stark…Is this a secure line? Are you alone?” Fury demanded and looked behind Tony, looking to see if he was indeed alone or not.
“I’m sorry,” Peter said, stepping up to him. “I was stupid, I talked to my dad, and –.”
Instead, he cleared his eyes and saw a child’s drawing of…well, his shield.
Pepper was the first to stand and she yelled, “Tony!”
Howard clapped his arm and agreed, “Yes, we will.”
“Or not..? We don’t have to. I just thought you were interested. I mean I am interested. I don’t know how many clues I shot you, more so after you told me you were gay. When it never went further I just assumed you still held something for Bucky. Or maybe you still do? Oh God, you still do don’t you?? I moved too fast! I’m sorry. I read into the hugs and the stares…I could not help it. I mean you’re you! You’re hot, you’re wonderful, you’re…you’re staring at me as if I am insane.”
“What targets?” Steve demanded.
In his mind, all he could envision was the scene from the
“I guess we’ll just have to keep going out on dates and looking cute,” Tony said with an exaggerated sigh.
Tony’s mouth was drawn to Steve’s like there were magnets in their lips. He pressed his body into Steve and rubbed his hips. Steve did the same and they stimulated each other as their genitals brushed one another.
Peter sighed heavily then turned back to Mary. He took a moment to study her, his eyes were curious but shadowed with hurt. Eventually, he looked her up and down and asked, “Is this what my mom would have really looked like?”
“No, I was the one who overreacted,” Steve murmured in apology.
. Steve was smiling at him, trying to get him to join in the conversation, and Peter was laughing at his stepfather without a worry.
Howard lightly closed the door and returned to his son’s side.
Tony was at a loss for words.
“Yes, sir?”
“Like I said, only once a year!” Tony replied, exasperated. He groaned and leaned back against the glass. His head was pounding and it was only getting worse from the stress. He wished he had taken some aspirin before talking to Steve.
Tony's chest ached. How long had it been since he last saw her? He'd seen her the morning he left for France so it had been what...Three weeks? Almost a month?
“You…You can’t just give up like this,” Steve stated tersely, tightening his grip on Tony for the briefest of seconds.
Peter was laying on the couch in his aunt and uncle’s apartment. His eyes were focused on the television but he was not following the story. Harry was over yesterday and Peter had felt a little like his old self but today he felt subdued. The excitement of seeing his friend had drained him and he was feeling melancholy again.
He did it. He got away.
Wade groaned and put his hands on Peter’s ass, pressing him closer to Wade. His baby boy was hard, it was like a freaking iron pipe pressing into him. This couldn’t possibly have happened so quickly. He had to have crawled into his window with it. The knowledge that Peter broke into his house with a boner was strangely arousing.
Dad was always there for him and despite going through similar pains. They latched onto each other and shared their in their grief. Somehow, their mutual misery alleviated some of the pain within Peter and made Peter feel closer to Dad than he ever had before.
But now here he was, wanting Tony to join his team.
“That’s Mysterio, he’s a master of illusion,” Peter stated. “Don’t get too close because he has these gases that make you see things, hence the weird headgear.”
Steve was not surprised when he saw a number of take-out bags sitting on the counter. The only things Tony knew how to prepare were coffee and burnt coffee. Tony was busily opening the cartons as Steve stepped in.
“Well, I am the Earth’s first-time traveler, so I guess that amounts to something,” Tony haughtily stated.
So Steve kissed back.
Peter quirked an eyebrow at the older man and corrected himself, “A high-end stripper then.”
His heart seized and all he could think was:
“We got done what needed to be done and then some,” Natasha covertly replied.
Bruce was smiling widely and looked as excited as a kid in a candy store. He was looking over older readings and then asked Coulson, “Where are the samples you took before you began the treatment?”
“Even the Hydra time machine was based off Tony’s design?” Steve gasped and sat down heavily beside Tony.
Bucky was going to die still.
Tony volleyed forward without a thought other than helping Steve.
Steve lifted his head with a smile and, with a voice warm enough to melt butter, he said, “
food in a timeline neither of us are supposed to be in?”
“Oh, only when the Hulk is angry, I run out of coffee...or when you look at me like that,” Tony replied.
The lawyers came in a few moments later. They welcomed them in a chorus of various greetings as they settled into the remaining
“We have to,” Steve replied, his fingers digging into James’ flesh. “At least until the others get here!”
“Put me down, blasphemer!”
His shirt fell back into place and Steve cleared his throat. Bucky turned to him, his emotionless mask in place. Steve held out the paper without meeting his eyes and whispered, “Please keep this, Bucky…. Please.”
A hologram opened above one of the worktables and Tony scrambled over to the screen as Jarvis opened the video. The team came up behind him and Natasha lay a supporting hand on his shoulder.
“It’s alright,” Tony reassured him, his brow knotted with pain. White bandages had already been wrapped around his torso on the flight back in the quinjet. He was currently slouched over in his seat and didn’t rise to great Steve like he usually did. It was too painful for him to rise and he stubbornly refused any pain medication. His brows were knotted tightly together as he roughly stated, “It’s all a part of the job.”
“What's with the watch?”
“This mornin’,” Bucky replied.
Steve waited until land was maybe a mile off the port side before he jumped overboard. He left a note for the crew to let them know he was fine but had slipped away to figure things out on his own.
“How about significant others?” Wade asked. He wouldn’t understand the science behind it but he was joining in the fun.
He was gasping for air and soaking wet.
“She gave birth to a boy. He is two now and his name is Peter…I just recently found out about him and have been raising him ever since. I know you are not related to him by blood but you two are related by marriage and the closest thing he has to family other than myself. If you want…I want you two to be a part of his life.”
Steve rolled his eyes and said, “I’m still trying to adjust to the fact that I am his father. He also has other family…Not on Mary’s side but Richard’s…I think I want Peter to get to know them. I just don’t know where to begin…”
Tony nodded more vigorously and then got to his feet, saying, “Alright! Let’s go downstairs then! Your aunt is probably ready by now!”
“Or they nearly conquer the world like Loki,” Tony stated.
“Steve’s alive!” Tony gasped, slightly out of breath from his sprint.
What else did he not know about his soulmate because he only lived in their dreams?
“As a cactus in a hurricane,” Wade retorted in a broken voice, the sound muffled slightly by his face being pressed into Peter’s shoulder.
Steve’s mouth thinned at his use of his last name. It was impersonal and felt strange on Tony's tongue. Steve cleared his throat and gruffly replied, “Yeah, sorry.” Steve’s eyes spanned around the elevator, taking in the fallen bodies and he sighed heavily.
Natasha had positioned herself at a vantage point between Stark Tower and the mayor’s podium. Through her rifle’s scope, she watched Stark exit his building and then pointed it at the stage to where the mayor and his people were waiting.
The confession twisted his heart painfully in a viselike grip. Steve was torn between pushing Tony away and pulling him in.
“We are not involving Peter again!” Steve gasped.
It was a new day now but Peter had been actively ignoring what happened yesterday. Yet, with Steve here now, he could no longer pretend last night was nothing of consequence. He cleared his throat and asked, “What are you doing here?”
with him again.
“You won't regret it,” Tony saucily retorted and then blew the super soldier a kiss as he walked away. The blush rebloomed on Steve's face with a fiery intensity. Tony chuckled as he left Steve alone to recover and regroup himself.
The base had aged greatly since he last saw it in World War II. It also had the addition of tall, barbed wire fencing and a newer building for the post of the SHIELD unit that was guarding it.
“Steve is that person who can do it,” Pepper continued as if Tony never spoke. “He loves all of you.”
“Hey,” Pepper whispered, grasping his shoulder lightly. “You know it’s more than that.”
Tony stepped up to the bed and placed a single knee on the edge. Tony’s weight shifted the bed and his thigh pressed against Steve’s.
He put on brave airs, but he was still scared. He still wasn’t ready for this. He still wanted to live. He wanted Tony. He wanted to be with Tony right now so badly.
“Apparently?”
But, once that burn was gone, Tony dropped his gaze and stared guiltily at the glass bottle. Everyone thought Tony had been sober for the last two years but none of them knew about August 20
Steve sighed heavily and said, “Not good…I can’t believe Bucky would try to shoot me…” He reached out to Tony and drew his thumb across his cheek and whispered, “Or try to shoot you…”
He’d felt that pinch so many times in the past when Steve had wanted to hold his hand in public. Tony had grown to love the feeling and had almost forgotten it. He turned around and there he was – Steve, smiling at Tony like he was the miracle even though Steve was the one who just came back from the dead.
Peter had written:
Tony looked questionably at him as all these thoughts filtered through Steve’s mind. He smiled at Tony then leaned forward. He kissed Tony’s forehead then the top of Peter’s head and whispered, “I love you both.”
Wanda shook her head and assured them, “It’s the same as last time…We’ll probably be able to get it off the same way.”
His stomach was starting to churn and he turned to the American’s leader. He gasped, “We need to find the Red Skull.”
(that relationship tag is finally going into play. It would be a shame if SHIELD did something to spoil it ;D)
“Someone’s attacking the others?” Steve gasped, his mind ruing with possibilities. Mainly, could Kilian have survived and come back for revenge?
Fury looked surprised by Tony’s statement though a little suspicious still. Steve could tell by his tone that he was sincere and, Fury must have too, because he nodded curtly and then asked, “All I need to know right now…is there a time machine on the property right now.”
“I always wanted to do it. Bucky brought me to the dance halls all the time in my era but no dame ever wanted to dance with me,” Steve said, his blush growing redder.
“I…I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony whispered, dropping his gaze. “I reviewed the files and us…we can’t…”
They smiled at each other as their eyes met and Steve whispered, “And then our island getaway.”
It wasn’t Steve. She had been positive that it’d be him but she was wrong. She was blessedly wrong.
She kneed him in the gut and he shoved his elbow into her throat. She choked from the blow and he exhaled harshly from the hit. They broke apart again and began to circle each other again. The entire fight so far only spanned the course of a dozen or so seconds.
"For the initiative?" Steve added.
Steve’s fingers crushed the red comforter into his fist.
He closed his eyes and fell asleep to the once familiar scent of his father’s aftershave.
He felt around him but Tony was not anywhere near him. He was alone.
They lay in a gooey pile both gasping and spent. Peter eventually pushed himself up by his elbows and smiled down at Wade. He didn’t think it was possible but Peter’s wild hair was even more of a mess after sex. Wade chuckled and ran his hand through his hair.
“If he was, do you think I’d tell you?” Peter replied dryly and his phone buzzed with a new message. Peter quickly glanced down and saw Wade sent him a bunch of kissey face emojis in reply to his text and Peter smiled sweetly at his screen. He replied with a single kissey face emoji, imaging actually placing the kiss onto Wade’s cheek.
“Steve?” Tony countered, tipping his head to the side with a coy smile despite his earlier reservations. He was a little tipsy but a little flirting never hurt anyone, right?
“S-Sorry,” Steve replied with a flush. He scrambled to his feet and hurriedly tied his knapsack back on. His stomach growled like an angry, caged wolf and Steve’s flush deepened.
They’d just made love and Tony carded his fingers into Steve’s and pulled his hand toward Tony. He looked at Steve’s hand and then murmured, “What do you mean?”
“All I ask is that you two punks wait to go time traveling again for another thirty years at least,” Bucky grumbled.
“But why were so adamant that I didn’t see you and how the heck did you jump like that?? You were like a rabbit on steroids!”
Steve relaxed a fraction when his friend did not reveal Steve ulterior plans. He shot Bruce a small but grateful smile. Bruce returned a wearied smile in return but his eyes held no trust, as if he expected Steve to run away as soon as his back was turned.
“Then it’s a date,” Wade replied. “…But now I will have to do some crazy cleaning and remodeling before you get here…”
He trailed to a stop in Times Square, marveling at the bright lights. Tony had once shown him how much it had changed in the dream world but it was so much more in person.
And now he was kissing the same man and he wished that moment would never end again because he’d never have it again. The magic would end.
Tony smiled into his mug, happy. Bucky was so much more like the man he once was when Steve was here.
They kept it a secret, knowing the Red Room would see them as compromised but, eventually, they were discovered…
It was Tony's turn to turn bright red. He had, had a reputation for being playboy but he'd never been confessed to in such an
“He’s still such a flirt,” a server giggled nearby.
And also…
Steve inhaled sharply but he reasoned it was not Tony. It had to be Pepper using Tony’s old phone. Maybe they had finally found the body or she was calling to reminisce. He instinctly grasped Bucky’s hand as he opened his voicemail and saw a message from Tony’s phone nestled among the other callers looking for him. Steve selected it and braced himself to hear Pepper’s grief stricken voice.
…The thought made his eyes heat and he buried his face into his arms to smother any tears that might escape. Pops never hid the truth from Peter. He knew neither Pops nor his mom had wanted a child. Yet Pops loved him and reminded Peter almost daily. Pops never made him feel unwanted. But it might be a different story with his mom…
Tony waved to his husband off stage and Steve answered the beckoning a moment later with an amused smile. The audience leapt to their feet again and applauded even louder at Steve’s appearance. He waved joyfully to them and then sat beside Tony on the couch, squishing Tony between him and Peter. Steve automatically put his arm behind him on the couch and Tony leaned into him like they were at home and not being watched live by millions.
With a frown, Tony scolded, “I don’t care if you’re able to fight. I want to know if you feel sick or are hurting because then I’ll find a way to make it go away!”
Tony’s image was still half faded and, at first glance, everything looked fine. Steve sagged with relief. Maybe Tony wouldn’t note the peculiar incident in the long run.
Steve stepped in and worked his magic. He gently ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and whispered, “No one has died and no one will die. We’ve got a location on Zola and we’re going to bring him in. He’ll tell us where Schmidt is and then we’ll get him and then get you home.”
“Natasha…How did you get that?” Tony asked, trying to sound casual but Steve could read the hidden terror in his voice. Tony’s hand began to shake so he lightly placed the coffee mug on the counter.
Peter paused in his struggles and then countered, “Then how did you survive without me in the first place??”
Steve’s heart clenched at the word "love" and his mind replayed Tony’s gasp after Steve’s confession...
Natasha’s free hand let go of Bucky’s strangling arm and she threw back her fist, punching Clint square in the face. Clint yelped and fell off her, clutching his nose.
He knew his family was going to be fine. The Avengers always won in the end. At that moment, his mother was in the same tower as he was and Peter was not going to overlook this opportunity to meet her.
unhappy and you are the cause, aren’t you?”
Steve listened and watched it all happen numbly. The breath froze in his lungs and his body had solidified into a statue.
Steve had seen similar wounds in the war from shrapnel. Such wounds were a death sentence on the field. He hissed, “Is-Is this really happening?! You better not be messing with me! Tony??”
She punched him with the metal arm and he flew back into the fire. She kicked one of the explosives that had fallen out of the suit and fired the repulsor at it as soon as it hit Kilian. It exploded, totally destroying Kilian and engulfing Pepper in the edge of its flames.
Tony sent out with the photo: ‘Beautiful morning, isn’t it?’
He heard them start to run, their breathing picked up as they did. There was another blast and Tony yelled, “Get her and go outside!”
Harry was brought up to Peter’s room by his dad. Dad was worried but he and Peter already had talked about it so he wordlessly left them alone. Harry stood in Peter’s doorway, staring at Peter with large eyes. Peter stared back, sitting in his bed, still wearing the old shirt of Pops’ he had slept in.
“Jarvis, can you alert me if Peter wakes?” Steve whispered.
Steve grinned and kissed him as his heart soared from joy. Tony grabbed his arms tightly, as if he were afraid he’d float away, and Steve wound his arms around him to anchor himself to him. Steve pressed his hips into Tony and the man’s hands instantly shot to Steve’s rear-end and his fingers were quick to divulge Steve of his underwear and knead the muscle beneath.
As he walked up the familiar stairs, he felt out of place.
“No need to explain, Captain,” Natasha said. “I had half guessed it already by the way you had kissed me. You just artfully confirmed it with your stuttering.”
Their last words had been cruel and Tony wanted his father to know the truth.
He bowed his head and a lump churned up from his gut and lodged in his throat. No more could be said…no more needed to be said.
“Of course, sir…and sir?”
“Ten feet behind you,” Jarvis replied. “If you cannot compress it then another option is to sear it shut.”
But when Tony sighed heavily, they both loosened their grips and their moment ended. They let go of each other and Steve’s heart felt like it broke again as Tony’s hand drew away.
Pepper handled the press for them and told them the Avengers needed to escape the craziness of the city. As Steve drove, from the passenger seat Tony laid out their plan to the entire team and explained that they needed to be somewhere with laxer security. Everybody listened quietly until the end and Steve braced himself for questions.
Peter sat up and walked around his room. Tony had given it to him last year. It was a place for him to call home when he was out late as Spidey or at the Tower. It was nowhere near as lived in as his place at Aunt May’s but it had acquired pieces of his life overtime.
He bent down and picked up a duffle bag sitting at the foot of the bed. It clinked lightly as the weapons inside moved with the momentum.
Tony demanded, “What on Earth are you doing to that defenseless coffee??”
“Thank you for everything, Dad,” Tony whispered, pulling Howard into another hug.
It sounded as if he reciting a story so she continued it by whispering, “And James means everything to Natalia.”
With glassy eyes, Steve smiled gratefully at him and replied, “I’d definitely lead the charge.”
She rolled them over so she was on top and he moaned as she settled in position.
Natasha hated to step between them because James seemed to be opening up to his friend, but she reached up and touched Steve’s forehead. He was burning up.
Tony helped in the cleanup which was a sign to the others that something was off.
He didn’t want to die…
“WHAT IS THIS I HEAR ABOUT A FLYING ROBOT??” Howard demanded.
The smell of alcohol hit him as soon as he stepped into the room. Jarvis had protocols set up to put everything in the lab on lockdown until Tony was sober. The lab was dark and unusually quiet. Even Dummy’s slight hum sounded loud as it turned its single eye to look to Steve.
“Work from here, Tony,” Pepper whispered. “You are too weak to operate the suit right now but you are fine to use a laptop.”
“Oh no, just living out two—no, three—fantasies right now. All good, Steve, all good,” Tony whispered hoarsely and cupped his crotch, adjusting it slightly under the towel.
Tony had convinced himself everything was fine. He went to sleep okay later that night…but that was because Steve fell asleep first.
“Yeah…I time traveled
Gabe pulled out his stethoscope and reached for the first button in the V of Tony’s shirt. Both Tony and Steve jumped and gasped simultaneously:
The floor beneath the community floor was a workout room dedicated to the entire team with many more facilities. Steve began to work out there every morning in addition to his morning runs. Sometimes, he and Clint would do sets together if they woke the same time.
He couldn’t help him.
Thor turned back to him. His blue eyes clouded with worry and his brows pinched with concern. Asking, no louder than a whisper, Thor said, “Heimdall?”
They made love, they cuddled, and then made love again.
Bucky turned more sympathetic eyes to him and replied, “Heya, Stevie.”
“YOU-!” Clint hissed, breaking the silence with his angry outburst. He jumped off the couch and the popcorn bowl went flying from his lap. Natasha practically threw Peter at Tony then launched herself at Clint. She got him in a headlock and brought him to a shuddering halt only a few feet away from Loki.
Wade laughed and retorted, “Yes, you enthusiastically did.”
She fell back onto the bed and he curled around her. She nuzzled her face next to his and whispered his name on a soft sigh, “
“Venom would take control before he would let that happen!” Steve easily deduced. Tony winced and uneasily glanced behind his shoulder.
Clint stopped when Peter ripped upholstered side cushion from the couch. The cloth ripped and the metal frame whined for just a second then the room became totally silent.
Cable sighed heavily and then murmured, “Fine. We’ll go to the local supermarket, but you are to do exactly as I say, understood?”
using Vaseline again.”
Peter quickly explained the realness to the invite and his thoughts on the matter and texted the reply: ‘My dad is a dork. I'm sorry.’
“Our wedding awaits,” Tony said.
“Unlike you, we can keep a secret more than 48 hours,” Tony teased.
“He is going to be so proud of you…more so when he’s older and understands,” Tony murmured the last half. “But he is going to be watching with Ben and May. He’s with us in spirit.”
Peter slipped out of their embrace and Tony asked the time traveler, “That is the last of it right? No more time traveling? We don’t have to worry about anymore paradoxes or people disappearing?”
Steve let out a breath he did not know he was holding and gasped, “Good, good, I was a little worried but I figured you could handle yourself.”
people.
“Howard!?” Bucky exclaimed loudly, drawing the eyes of several soldiers. They kept walking and those eyes individually filtered away. He leaned in closer to Steve and said in a lower, accusing voice, “Why are you gonna see him at a time like this??”
Pepper sent the message and put away her phone as she glared at Tony and retorted, "I would and have."
“I’ve got a safe house,” Stark stated. He was holding his left arm like a lifeline but his stance and voice were determined.
He slowly nodded and whispered, “Alright…”
Tony sat up a little and poured some one his fingers and replied, “You, obviously.”
“Ah, ah, ah,” Kilian tutted, pointing his gun at Pepper’s head. “Move another step and she’s dead. You two are friends, aren’t you?”
Tony smiled to himself and imagined the look on Rhodey’s face when he introduced him to his newest conquest.
Tony stiffly got to his feet but was suddenly shot at and the glass beneath him gave away.
“What. The. Actual. Fuck?” Tony gasped, as he looked up to where the intruder disappeared
He had no warning. One moment, he was watching TV, and the next, he was clutching the wall as something ran through the room barreling through one wall and out the other.
Tony shook his head and felt like he was breaking from the inside all over again. He wetly gasped, “I’m so stupid…”
But then there was Steve.
“To infinity and beyond,” Tony said with an exhausted smile and an air-high-five in Steve’s direction.
That hope that had been born so recently shriveled tightly in his chest. But, he held onto it fiercely and he turned to Thor and demanded, “Do it again!”
“When are you available tomorrow?”
Eddie said something about testing Venom outside and Peter nodded and his friend left. Peter sat down at one of the stools and held his wrist, petting the piece of Venom he had and feeling comfort from its presence.
Steve’s arms tightened around Peter despite his wounds and he gasped, “C-Code Silver.”
“Wasn’t he dead?” Clint added with a venomous glare at Loki. His statement was more of a threat than a question. Loki grinned and leaned back against the railing.
Tony sat up sharply and saw Steve.
“Wh-What?” Tony gasped.
He felt Tony’s lips lightly brushing his cheeks and he realized he was kissing away his tears. Steve buried his face in Tony’s chest, let his courage falter, and unleashed it all. All his worry, all his fear, and all his pain came pouring out of him in the form of powerful sobs.
Steve held the coal closer to his chest as his heart began to beat faster.
Tony drew back his hand and Steve cautiously looked at him to see how he reacted. For a few seconds, he saw the forlorn expression he had been expecting but Tony quickly masked it behind one of indifference.
Yet leaving his arm hanging there, waiting for a handshake was also suspicious so Steve slowly grasped Tony’s hand and had to hold back holding Tony too tightly as he felt a sudden surge of touch deprivation. Tony’s warmth sunk into Steve’s hand and memories associated with that touch filtered quickly through his mind. They never had many opportunities to hold hands. It was frowned upon in his era so he’d treasured all those collective moments and he couldn’t help but think of them as he slowly shook Tony's hand.
Her face was blank but her eyes were calculating. Finally, she stated, “Stark did not keep Peter longer just to talk.”
“…Sir, there was an anomaly on one of the outside cameras that may peak your interest,” Jarvis interrupted his melodic droning.
are real.”
Eddie fell onto the bed and sighed, “Sure.”
He loved Bucky but he was not
have a Facebook?
The bafflement in his voice drew Tony’s eyes. What had he been expecting? Anger maybe? Not shock—especially not the quavering in Captain America’s voice…He never wanted him to make such a noise again.
Tony hummed in agreement and his own hands made their way up Steve’s chest and then he cupped Steve’s jaw as he brought him level for another kiss.
Natasha scrambled to her feet and glared daggers at him. When he met her angry gaze, she yelled in Russian, “What were you thinking?? I thought you were being civil! I haven’t forgiven you yet and you think this is the best way to treat me when I finally give you a chance?? Don’t you understand my feelings on the matter??”
! You nearly killed me!
Tony shivered and Steve moved into action. He gently pulled himself from Tony’s side and then sprinted across the room and dug an emergency blanket out of the closet. He then ran back to Tony and carefully settled next to him. He draped the blanket over both of them and then snuggled close to his boyfriend.
Steve was distracted for a moment as Tony hopped on one foot to get his leg in his new pants. Steve laughed at him and Tony playfully smacked him on his side so he hadn’t noticed that only five of the six were there.
They kissed again, this time it tasted salty from their tears and they broke apart with Tony chuckling, “We’re a mess.” Tony looked to Pepper and said, “Pep, I’d like to introduce you to my mess.”
Tony let go of him and gasped, “Me too!”
He’d been standing in the alleyway Peter told him to wait for him. It was deserted save for the trashcans and cigarette butts. At this late hour, there were hardly any pedestrians on the street to notice him lurking. Wade whipped his head around to find Peter hanging upside down behind him in his new black Spidey uniform.
I went back and added a little more to both ch 5 and 6 a few days after posting it! It does not change the story line much, just adds more to Steve's guilt. So those of you who read it when I first posted might want to reread it!
“I’m not going to miss the moopy you,” Cable countered and activated his time glove. Steve smiled brightly at the time traveler and then transferred that smile back to Tony. Steve's tears glistened in the light of the portal opened by the glove. As the bright light surrounded them, Tony whipped those tears away and Steve leaned into his touch with a content sigh. Tony gently pulled him the rest of the way into his arms and closed his eyes.
"Of course, Dad,” Peter replied with an aspirated groan. “But I don’t know about Aunt May. I will text you later after I ask her.”
He probably was never going to see Steve again…
Peter awoke with a scream strangling his throat and his hands clawing at the air.
Peter hadn’t played that game, nonetheless any game, since before Venom. He had not done anything normal or what constituted as “fun” in the same amount of time.
“…I don’t remember,” James murmured. “All I remember is Steve and our hometown. There were so many tall buildings, and cars, and every couple of blocks you’d see an American flag hanging somewhere…Everyone spoke English. There was no Academy…No Hydra…”
And he didn’t have to…
He nestled himself in a divot in the gear, folded his arms over his chest, and fell into a doze. He was conscious of the rocking train, but his mind wandered into its memories. He returned to a hazy memory of lying beside a healthy Tony. They had just made love and Tony was pressed into his side and just smiling at him in a way that made Steve never want to leave.
From the corner of his eye, Steve saw Tony clench his fist.
This jerk…
“Positive,” Tony replied. “What do we do…?”
He mostly focused on the holograms. He helped in finding more Hydra people but…mostly he was searching for Bucky. There was a scattered paper trail. From what he could see, Bucky was considered more of a tool than a person, making their records less substantial. They didn’t put much value on his life in general. When they weren’t using him for missions, they put him in a cryostasis chamber in some warehouses where they stored out-of-date weapons.
“I need to go back to sleep!” Tony gasped, pulling open one of the drawers in the expansive bathroom. His sleeping pills rolled toward him, loudly clinking within the bottle. He’d used them only a few times, when he thought he was dying and he wanted to spend more time with Steve.
Tony squeezed Steve a little tighter just as the light became too bright for his eyes and they were whisked back to their era.
They were in the shower much longer than usual but after the water was off, they quickly got dressed and went downstairs.
He was so, so very late. He didn’t even have to look at his phone to know who was calling. He knew it was Eddie wondering where he was.
He half blamed space for the kidney stones he eventually developed.
Tony leaned up and pressed a hard kiss into his mouth. Steve curled over him and dug his fingers into Tony’s flesh as their kisses grew more wild and enthusiastic.
Wade chuckled and, much like what had happened when he hummed, the feeling ran through Peter again. Peter pressed his heels deeper into Wade's back with another heated groan.
Tony bit down on his lip, not liking where this was going. He reached forward and grasped Steve’s hand as he countered, “That is why I suggest entering this knowing it will expire. We can have our fun and then look back on it fondly, but, in the long run, it won’t change us. We will still do what history expects of us. You’ll remain in the 20
“I was just checking in on how you were,” Schmidt teased. “Were the accommodations to your liking?”
“Nothing!?” Cable shoved the photo back in his hands and pointed at Steve’s hand in the photo and hissed, “You telling me this isn’t a change??”
Natasha smirked and said, “Good.”
He finally gave in and pulled Peter in with a laugh. Peter grinned and they kissed. Wade melted into the kiss, feeling like the star of his own personal fairytale. He was kissing the embodiment of Prince Charming, no, Peter was handsomer with a
The prosecution was staring at Marcel with absolute astonishment and Steve had to do all within his power not to launch himself at the man. Steve grinned ecstatically at Marcel as he walked back to their table.
The other woman walked toward them with the cylinder and goosebumps rose on all of Peter’s exposed skin. His eyes focused on the cylinder and it clicked in his head.
Steve chuckled and agreed, “I can say the same…”
He heard the slight whine of Tony’s thrusters as he got closer but he had not been expecting to feel Tony’s metal hand slide into his nor feel the body of his suit to press into his back. Steve wanted to lean back into him and draw him closer. For half a second, he almost did just that. However, a moment later, he jolted out of Tony’s hold and turned on him with a scowl.
Wade leaned in and pressed his forehead to Peter’s. His eyes were conflicted and he whined, “
They did not really wash in Tony’s shower but kissed and explored each other slowly, mapping out each other’s bodies with their hands and mouths. It was one of the most erotic experiences in Tony’s life.
Peter shook his head and said, “I only recently got her to grudgingly accept you are a part of my life. Dinner with Steve might be pushing it. I still haven’t broken it to her that you two are dating. I don’t think she will want to go either way...”
!” Natasha hissed. She grabbed him roughly and drew him away from her soulmate but the insane man took the opportunity to lunge at her. She and Tony fell back together and Barnes snarled at Natasha.
He couldn’t think about what Steve was doing.
! Venom did more than protect him, it made him stronger, and took away his fatigue!
“…But I'm Deadpool, Pete. A lot of normal people may not
Steve smirked as his gaze flicker over the room. The symbol of Hydra had been carved into the walls but some of the soldiers had found some paint and drew over them, adding things like mustaches or thick glasses. Steve joked, "Some of these guys aspire to be interior decorators."
what he did, Pepper. Every word I read and every image I saw will be etched into my mind forever and you want to know why?” He let go of the handles and finally met her eyes as he stated, “In 1945, I let him fall. I let him fall right into those bastards’ hands and he is like this
“B-Bucky?!” Steve gasped. He went to sit up but Bucky placed his hand on Steve’s chest. Steve tensed. Was Bucky here to finish what he started weeks prior?
“Tony?” Steve gasped, hating that he could not be there to help him and hating that he could only listen to Tony struggle and not know what was happening.
relationship, despite how short and unofficial it was,” Steve observed sadly. Steve leaned in and whispered, “But…thank you for telling me. I’m glad to know that there could have been an ‘us’ in another life…”
Steve’s eyes focused on him and Tony carefully met his gaze. Steve’s eyes were searching his, for what, Tony could only guess. Tony dropped his eyes, hoping not to give anything away.
“He started working on it in his teens, after his parents died. Knowing him, he probably did it so he wouldn’t be alone. He wanted you but you never appeared.” All the upset Steve had been feeling toward Tony vanished and he stared at Natasha with wide eyes to express his shock. She continued, “When he was still alone, he did stupid things, trying to fill that empty space that you were supposed to fill. He isn’t doing it anymore. He hasn’t for years so do not look at that dark period in his life and use it to judge him now.”
! I am scarred for life!”
“Yes…” Tony replied slowly. He glanced between Steve and Mary then stated, “So am I going to address the elephant in the room?”
But no one came after them.
Steve was clenching his jaw so tightly Tony was surprised his teeth weren’t popping out yet. He was barely keeping it together. Without looking at them, Tony said to the others, “Guys, can you give us a minute?”
Natasha looked up to him, her eyes wet. He’d never seen her cry before and he cupped her face worriedly. She cupped his cheek too and whispered, “You promise we’ll be together until the end?”
“Papa!” Peter squealed excitedly in his arms. “Look!”
Tony glanced down at his chest and saw the raised veins were still there. He hadn’t dreamed it. He was still dying.
“Shut up. This team would be nothing without the two of you and you know it,” Clint grumbled as he stepped out of the doorway. He turned on the television and grabbed his game control and sat next to Tony. Clint spared his laptop screen a glance and asked, “Anything yet?”
Steve was struggling with the Soldier and Tony couldn't fire at him without risk of hitting him.
Steve glanced out the window. The bus was driving on a highway going a nice cruising speed. The cars that passed them contained the usual commuters.
He immediately returned the embrace and pressed his face into Howard’s shoulder. The old familiar smell of his father’s cologne filled his nose and it brought several childhood memories to the surface of his mind. That smell was what broke the dam and let a few tears through Tony's tightly shut eyes.
Tony snorted and started to turn away before straightening up abruptly.
“So you’re an artist
“No, listen:
“Yeah, you’re plenty easy on the eyes too, pal.” He paused to grin at Steve’s smirk. “I hadn’t really questioned it, but no other spirits cluttering the world with you? That’s strange, isn’t it?”
SHIELD agents surrounded his car as he pulled into the underground lot he wasn’t, strictly speaking, supposed to have access to. No one directly blocked him, as he headed straight for Fury’s office, sussed out from the encrypted building plans by Jarvis, since none of his prior meetings at SHIELD headquarters had ever included direct office access. Smart; ultimately a very pointless security attempt, but you know. Smart to at least attempt it.
“Howard? Howard, are you okay? You look...what’s going on, are you real?”
Steve rolled his eyes. “‘M not really
Steve looked overwhelmed from the conversational onslaught, but he gamely started to answer.
Tony didn’t really live at the mansion so much as frequently visit, and it seemed fitting that it still didn’t feel much like home, since it rarely felt that way even in his childhood. It was impossible for it to ever feel truly homey without his mother there, anyway, but Steve added a great deal to the equation, and that was something else Tony tried not to examine too hard either. Steve wasn’t a secret, exactly, but Tony hadn’t mentioned him to anyone else, and hadn’t even directly introduced him to Jarvis, and that had led to Tony somewhat subconsciously keeping their visits restricted to the study and the kitchen, and the hallways between. Jarvis, sainted program and reliable confidant that he was, seemed to pick up on the unspoken separation of worlds, and never interrupted them, despite his presence throughout the hallways and kitchen.
, he scoffed to himself
“You’re in a governmental facility, the headquarters of SHIELD, which was originally founded by Peggy Carter during the time you were frozen and presumed dead. It’s the year of our Lord 2010, old-timer, and Director Fury is currently the head honcho you’d be answering to if you decide to stay put. But I’ve negotiated an early release for ya, if you’re so inclined. The Stark family mansion will seem
”So, where were you?”
Storm gasped and brought his hand to his hair. “Suck it a bit?”
”You sure you never banged anyone with the name Storm? Or Brown? I mean, how cool would it be to have Captain America as your granddad? Also weird, since you look almost younger than me,” the guy said with an infuriating smirk.
Steve moaned into the pillow.
God. Steve had seen it coming. Had sort of anticipated it before, and had even thought of ways to duck. But in the moment, well, he hadn't felt bad for Storm exactly, since honestly, Steve really was the lonely and sad one, but he had thought that he kind of owed it to Storm. Who had taken him to a date and said that he had to be something special – and after eating well and driving around with the bike Steve had been kind of content for a second there.
”Oh, now I got to know who she was. Someone I know?”
“What?”
“Yes,” Steve admitted reluctantly. He wasn't ashamed or even embarrassed, but he was prepared for Tony to act stupidly about it.
“Yes, we saw each other briefly when my brother was being an idiot,” she answered.
Then again Storm had given him the back bag to carry, so they were sitting quite tightly together.
”As a joke! I didn't expect you to go and get it on with him!”
“That depends on whether or not your arrow will be pointing at me,” Steve answered as the elevator came to a stop.
Steve felt a blush rising to his cheeks and his cock filling into full hardness. Was that something Johnny wanted? Was that why he had put the porn on in the first place, showing Steve instead of asking?
”My bottle opener, I'd swear I left it here somewhere.”
“I'm glad I can help.”
“I won't have sex with him, if that's what you're asking.”
Steve cleared his throat. “Okay.”
“Just out of curiosity, what did you say to him?”
Steve felt really out of his depth here. Because it obviously was a date, but saying 'no' felt rude, especially since he was completely free. He usually was. Also, going out for a date with someone didn't mean you were going to... do anything else with them. Steve knew. He had been on a lot of awkward dates in his life, and not usually that voluntarily.
Storm went to kneel between Steve's parted thighs and before Steve really got what was coming, Storm had taken a grip of his cock and closed his lips around it.
“Yes,” Storm said before Steve could end his sentence. “If you're not too tired, of course.”
And while he wouldn't hurry things along just because he wanted sex, it was driving him crazy just how much he wanted it. He tried to remind himself that he had lived well into his twenties without it, and it wouldn't kill him to wait however long it took.
Tony had said that he would give him a lift home, which was nice, since he'd rather rest there than on the Helicarrier, but it
Tony didn't continue so Steve took a deep breath and relaxed again into the intimate touches. Soon Tony leaned to kiss Steve's back, trailing up his spine with his lips. Steve made an appreciative sound and turned his head to better offer his neck to Tony.
Steve did, because there was nothing he could do or say that wouldn't make it even worse.
God he wanted to hit Tony. And Storm too, a bit.
“That was great,” Johnny said after a while.
“That you fucked.”
“What, rimming?” Johnny asked. And of course there was a word for it, Steve thought dryly. “Not really. I've never actually done it, but it's pretty basic stuff in gay porn.”
Pulling himself together he turned to Tony and leaned closer, putting his hand on Tony's shoulder.
Clint seemed flabbergasted and even Natasha looked surprised. Bruce just looked mildly amused.
“Lucky girl?” Tony asked, turning his gaze towards Steve.
“Yeah,” Steve said and started to think of an answer. He had meant slow mostly emotionally. He didn't want to be a part of Tony's break up with Pepper, and he wanted to be sure he wouldn't start a relationship just to not be lonely. They had almost explosive chemistry and Steve went sort of weak in the knees because of how good and decent and unselfish Tony was underneath it all. Also, he suspected he had a weird thing for jerks. Tony made him absolutely crazy and he wanted the chance to go a different kind of crazy and he didn't want to mess it up by hurrying and not solving their issues first.
Turned out he didn't have to, because suddenly Tony was there.
“Oh. Yeah, it's probably bed time for supersoldiers,” Tony said and started to put his clothes back on. “I'll go to the shop for some work.”
not a complaint.”
”Not that I want to encourage you, but wooing me with raw fish isn't really doing it.”
“And you just – what, dropped your pants for the first guy who had the guts to ask?”
“I – yes, but. I thought you might,” Steve started, but the words
“Oh,” Tony said, surprised. Then: “I don't know if Happy'll be too happy if you –  wait, what am I saying? He's seen worse, you can kiss me.”
Before the war they went out every single day with Bucky.
”I know how to use a bow.”
He didn't hate Tony Stark. Could not, since the guy wasn't actually bad. But God did it sometimes feel like hate, what burned inside him.
God it would be so much easier if he could just talk to Tony. Wasn't that a thought, to be able to communicate with your
Tony, drinking some nasty-looking sludge, greeted him, but was otherwise silent.
He didn't hear from Tony until that evening.
“Yeah, but I'm over it now.”
Steve thought it was going to be really awkward, but then, he was very used to awkward. At least it would be better than leafing through dirty pictures with Bucky, trying to be more interested in the nude women than Bucky's expressions.
Right.
Tony hummed. “What about 'babe'? Because I have to confess the thought of you being voluntarily my babe makes me warm and giggly inside.”
Steve couldn't keep his hands away, trying to feel up every inch of Tony's body, and couldn't stop himself from opening Tony's shirt, ignoring all thoughts about going slow. It wasn't like he could have forgotten that he was with
”You ever had sushi?” Storm asked him when they had stopped.
a date!” Tony gloated.  ”And now you're back alone. Did you not get any, that's why you're grumpy?”
Well, he thought when Tony
And even though he had said it mostly to Tony's chest, Tony probably heard it, because he let out a soft
”Yeah, anything's good,” Steve said while he was looking around Storm's place. The whole apartment was one big, open space, kitchen on the other end and Storm's bed on the other. In the middle there was a black leather couch and a huge TV-screen. He didn't have a dining table so he probably ate on the sofa. On various side tables and shelves the were some books and other personal items. On the walls there were a few posters of some movies and on the wall opposite the bed was a big mirror. Steve decided not to think about it too much.
“I don't.”
For a second Steve thought about being annoyed, but then decided to offer something truthful since Tony had done so as well.
Steve gave Clint a look. “Why would you care?”
His phone vibrated then, notifying him of a new message.
“I see,” Steve said, not really sure what his stance was on getting fucked by Johnny. Or anybody really.
”Do you want anything to drink?”
“Do I have a chance?”
“You smell sweaty,” Tony commented, face still close to Steve's.
Steve went to sit on the sofa and tried not to feel smug.
The biggest thanks for my brilliant beta Schizanthus.
“Indeed.”
”Hello,” Steve said, and tried to think if going back inside and taking a lift to the garage and getting his own bike would alarm Tony.
Feeling a bit smug Steve bent his head down to catch Storm's lips in a kiss. He took his time and let his hands wander everywhere he could reach. He really liked the chest hair. And the freedom to even do this in the first place so easily, the fact that no one who could come to know about it would really care, not about Storm being a guy.
”This is from the Tower's outside security camera,” JARVIS voiced and a video clip opened on to the TV-screen before them.
“But we're not in bed. Although I can come up with other names for you if you want.”
Tony smiled. “I was just laying the groundwork to get you into a bath with me after we ruin my bed.”
Well sure, the fire thing was almost on par with the Iron Man suit in impressiveness, and then there was the slightly weird experience of someone looking uncannily like you, but at the end of the day Storm seemed to be just another jerk.
”Oh yeah, Pepper. I could see how much she trusts you when she called you three times during the documentary and in the end had to sic Natasha on to you, just to get you to one measly meeting. To be honest, that woman's got to be a saint or crazy to put up with you.”
But Storm didn't seem to be in a hurry.
“What now?” Tony asked.
“Oh fuck, that's – yeah, just like that,” Johnny babbled. “Not going to take long.”
“Ogling you in tight pants is probably the only fun people around here get,” Tony said.
Tony's bath was big enough that they could have both washed and relaxed on their own, but Steve pulled Tony to lie against his chest as soon as he had found a comfortable position.
”Did the Hawk-guy teach you?”
“Oh?”
Huh. Steve checked the time and saw Tony had sent it after three am. The second message, sent an hour later, got Steve's heart to beat a bit faster.
“Oh. So you didn't put this on to suggest any ideas?”
Tony was gone for a business meeting and Steve had just got a text from Johnny, asking him to hang out.
”Where were you?” Was the first thing he heard when he got out of the elevator. Clint and Natasha were having breakfast in the communal kitchen slash living room area.
“Why?”
“Maybe that I wouldn't cheat?” Steve said, standing now in front of Tony, wanting to take a hold of him and shake some sense into him. And then maybe kiss him. “Johnny's my friend.”
“I see,” Steve said and turned his eyes from Tony, trying to think straight.
”I don't want to have sex with you just because we look like each other.”
Well. He really was a bit cold.
“I know,” Steve said lazily, “but isn't it – weird to use it in bed?”
Steve cleared his throat. “I think Clint is shocked because he just learned about our relationship and I'm just embarrassed.”
But he hadn't actually said that he wanted anything from Steve. Or even acted more nicely towards him.
Johnny chuckled. “You're huge.”
“So?” Tony asked.
“And you went to Johnny Storm?”
“Are you going to stay the night?” Johnny asked later.
Steve tried very hard not to speculate on what that meant. Before he came up with anything to say, Tony sent another message.
Sitting on his bed, he contemplated activities other than punching a bag that left him feeling relaxed, but well. He had never initiated anything with Johnny.
Tony turned his head a bit to squint at Steve. “You're not disapproving of your boyfriend's wild past, are you?”
Tony looked raw and vulnerable, but finally met his eyes.
Johnny looked surprised. “No. You didn't think so?”
And it wasn't like he thought Johnny would try to grate Tony's nerves on purpose, but Johnny didn't know how things were with him and Tony, didn't know about the jealousy and didn't know that Tony probably wouldn't like the idea of a threesome.
“That's the second time you've been away overnight,” Clint said. “You have to tell something about her – we don't have lives, we want to live through yours.”
“You know, you really made me want to try to bottom some time,” Tony said suddenly.
*****
“What?” Clint asked. “How do you even meet anyone, you're here most of the time – oh God.”
And then Tony. God. The man had apparently really decided to do the slow thing, because he didn't propose anything or didn't even try to make them
“Yeah, just say when.”
So he waited.
Tony was avoiding looking at him again. “Are you going to keep on seeing Storm?”
Tony moaned and slammed his other hand against the car ceiling, supporting himself so he wouldn't hit his head against it when he started to move with Steve's hand. Steve couldn't get enough of how Tony looked right then, legs spread, mouth open, cock pulsing and arc reactor shining like the goddamned sun.
“Apology accepted, by the way,” Steve said, his back towards Tony while he was making himself a sandwich.
And it just got better, until they were rutting together and Steve wondered why had he thought he wouldn't want to have sex with a fit, good-looking man. Sure, Storm mostly wanted him because of his superhero persona, but at least he was honest about it. And, well, here Steve was reciprocating quite enthusiastically because Storm was attractive and he was lonely.
“It won't last if I do that,” Tony answered, slightly out of breath.
“Not her, him.”
Steve laughed.
Steve glanced at Bruce who pointedly did not look at him.
*****
“Harder, Tony.”
*****
While it was possible that Tony had just decided that he felt like partying, Steve thought it safe to assume that he had found out about him going to Johnny's and was getting upset about it.
“In what? Fucking?” He asked anpd continued before Tony could answer. “I wouldn't know.”
“Excuse me?”
”Ouch,” Storm said, but didn't look like he'd taken offense.
After a few careful thrusts Tony started to pick up speed, but it wasn't enough.
“Jesus, right. Yeah, that. That can be arranged,” Tony babbled.
“Yeah,” Steve just said, closing his eyes and concentrating on keeping a tight hold on the suit. He knew Tony would take care of the rest.
“No. I just wondered if you're sure you want to see me tomorrow morning. Or some morning after that.”
”That was one time! And there was no guarantee your half-assed scheme would have worked.”
“You're here,” Tony stated, glancing at Steve briefly before turning to look somewhere far off.
“You'd probably like something sensual, right? I found this place that has a lot of sweet stuff, costs like a dollar per month.”
Tony burst laughing at that and Steve sent a silent thank you to Johnny for that quip.
“Please do. I think I will go to my room and cry,” Clint said before rising and walking away.
Storm grabbed his hand. ”Can I get your number?”
“I don't think we need to – “
“I won't give up on you,” he said then, not really meaning to, but it seemed that he had no control over his mouth.
“On one hand, I'm enjoying seeing you in something I made, but one the other hand I'm wishing you'd take it off.”
“Something wrong?”
“Very giggly,” Tony said.
“Yeah. I had sex with Johnny, but you're the only man I've fucked. Heck, you're the only
Steve couldn't yet do anything physically straining with his left arm, so training was out of the question. Steve eyed his sketch book and sighed. He was too wired for that.
*****
“What?”
Steve realized it was past midnight already. He gave it a fleeting thought, because it would be kind of comforting to fall asleep there on the couch to the sound of someone else sleeping in the same room. But. Well. If he was waking up alone, he'd rather do it in his own bed.
”Well,” Steve just said and took the bottle and popped it open with his hand.
Steve's hands went to Storm's ass, because it felt like the thing to do and anyway, Storm had a really nice ass. Storm seemed to approve since he rolled his hips against Steve's then and well. Wow. It was an incredibly good feeling to kiss someone while they were pressed against you like that.
Steve had seemed to relax as the music continued, but Tony thought he saw the shine of unshed tears in his eyes, too, before Tony slowly dropped asleep, soothed by the quiet company, and the music reminding him of his mother, and the quiet way she’d sway to the soft music in their suffocatingly empty house.
Tony brushed off the apology, charmed in spite of himself that even his own mental construction of Steve was so polite. “Just a joke, soldier, pay me no mind.”
“Disney, the animator? Why-- what? Whaddya mean frozen?”
“Tony!” Steve hissed. “You can’t just say things like that!”
“Yeah, J, what? Tell me tell me.”
The record player scratched and hissed before settling in to the grooves, and the music swelled, filling the dim room.
Something about his newfound goals and life’s purpose reframed this visit though. Almost without thinking about it, he opened one of the boxes this time. All those years he’d spent ignoring them, and leaned against them, and bumping heavily into them as he came or went, booze-soaked and miserable, and he’d so cautiously never even shifted a box, let alone opened one or rummaged through. But this time...well, this time he was tired of standing outside the past, lingering at the edges of painful memories.
It would be hard, after all, to discover you weren’t actually dead, as expected, and to be completely surrounded with advanced technology and strangers, especially after the many real opportunities he would’ve had during the war to experience and fear Hydra’s many medical experimentation rooms. There would’ve been no familiar voices to hear whenever he’d regained consciousness here, with no one left alive on-staff who personally knew him. If nothing else, Tony thought, he could at least be that for Steve, to help reassure him it was safe to admit he was awake. Or if he were in fact still unconscious, perhaps hearing Tony would help him focus enough to wake up. Either way, there were definitely options to try before attempting to restore the Vita-Ray machines to functionality.
that urge, a bit.
Seeing the boxes again...the subject was unavoidable. Captain America. Hell. He wasn’t really drunk enough for this after all, he thought, after picking through the first box. He abruptly threw back another quarter of the bottle and sagged to the floor with another one of the boxes. This one had one of the early non-vibranium shield prototypes in it.
“Sir, if I may, your sleep stats for the most recent rest were unusual.”
There was a long silence, as they sat with their griefs.
“Coming home with me, then? Let’s just sign you out at the front desk, last chance to trash the room before we go.”
But just the same, he finally gave into the urge to try to talk to Steve, unusual timing though it was for their normal schedule, but then, did ghosts even keep schedules? What would even be on the agenda? As he hurried down the corridors to the study, he wondered if Steve had any sort of paranormal hobbies he hadn’t mentioned before,
Steve shrugged. “Even if I could, it wouldn’t matter. I can’t get drunk anymore. Couldn’t, I mean. Side effect of the serum. I was too sick and poor to drink much beforehand, and then..”
He set the chart down on the small rolling cart alongside the bed and slowly exhaled.
Sometimes Howard would chatter on, hands making wide gestures that sloshed alcohol onto the desk, about the possibilities that Cap could still be recovered intact, even alive, and the ways the gamma radiation and Vita Rays used to create him could be used to resuscitate him. When he was still very small, young enough for fairy tales, Tony had been inspired and impressed. Even the raging blackouts that followed seemed in some ways only to enhance the drama of the tale. As an adult, the whole memory was pitiful and pathetic. He still funded the annual Stark Industries arctic search missions, usually citing the advanced aircraft and possible additional Hydra technology on-board as justification for the continued missions, but really, as much as he wanted to hate Captain America for apparently filling whatever minimal space for human connection Howard had once had-- despite that, Tony couldn’t help but continue his father’s task here. He would never have initiated something like this, but, once Howard passed, he found it impossible to end the last project his father had truly obsessed over. Besides, they were very nearly made of money, and the missions did lead to interesting cold-weather tech developments and discoveries, so he could usually avoid thinking about it over-much.
“Oh, I...I’m sorry, I was looking for Howard.”
“I thought I saw Bucky once, but… that’s it. And I think I must’ve just imagined him. He was all in black, his hair was longer, and he was, well… He was different from before. Standing outside our old tenement house, where I’d go walk sometimes, but no one noticed me there, not that I ever tried to get anyone to see me. But I thought it was Bucky, standing there, awfully stiff and uncomfortable, and just glaring at the building like he’d raze it to the ground if he could.”
He could ask Jarvis if Steve had ever taken this long to appear, but he already knew the answer. The hours slipped away as the drinks slid down his throat, and he waited.
Coulson had quickly walked over during this speech, looking concerned, but Fury was already answering. “I don’t care what you think your claim is, or what you think you can say to him, but he’s a soldier, and he belongs here, and--”
just a bit, as he walked closer.
a poet, good for you. Ugh. That’s the most profoundly lackluster description of the afterlife and the ability to appear, incorporeal, anywhere, anytime. What am I supposed to do with any of that?! I’m only forgiving you because I know you don’t currently
“Mr. Stark, what a surprise. Dare I ask what prompted this visit, to a location you are categorically not authorized to access?”
“Eh, fine, done, agreed, you can have the first half of that list if you win, maybe 60% if it goes as fast as I think. Doesn’t matter cause I won’t be losing. And yes, add the helicarrier upgrades in regardless, but I’m sure we all concur that the coffee makers are the first priority on that project.”
“Summoned!” Steve had protested “Summoned? That’s not-- there’s gotta be a better way to say that.”
“Oh, were you two, uh, together? You and Bucky? That wasn’t in any of the stories I ever heard from my dad, at least.”
The next box gutted him. Captain America and the Project Rebirth files. Howard was the most incandescent and then, eventually, incoherent, when he went through these boxes, and talked about that time period. Tony had loved and loathed the very sight of them while growing up, because the nostalgia portion of the evening was the closest he ever felt to his father, as Howard would reminisce about Captain America, the peak of human scientific achievement, the savior of the Allied cause, “and a damn good man, besides,” Howard would usually add, between exciting stories of the war and the many and varied triumphs of the SSR, and Cap, and Howard himself. But by the end of the night, Howard would be well past drunk, slurring and sad, as he’d tally all his many disappointments in life, chief of which, emblematic, was the loss of Captain America, and the ongoing failure to find him then or now.
“He’s not even woken up yet, and you’re already trying to kidnap him. I don’t know why I bother having expectations about you: they’re never low enough or absurd enough, and you always sidestep them anyway. He’ll be staying here, of course, for observation and any treatment, and we will cautiously handle reintegration when and if he’s prepared for it. I know you’re used to buying and collecting anything you want, but Captain America is a real live human being, first and foremost, and he will not be leaving with you.”
“Oh, don’t get your patriotic panties in a twist, you, what, answered my prayers?”
Steve looked confused. “Bedtime stories? Howard...was your dad?”
“No...well. ’M not rightly sure what I look like now, so I couldn’t say if he looked like me, or not, ghostly or not, I mean. But he didn’t really look alive either. I haven’t always had the best control of when and where I appear, though, and from the shock, I-- I lost the thread, couldn’t stay put. He was gone by the time I got back."
how, Steve, c’mon, give me something to work with here.”
in connection to Steve. He threw some more Scotch down his throat.
Cold War AU, 18k words for a serious and brooding story, when Captain America teams up with the Winter Soldier:
Peggy,” Steve dully repeated. “Did she ever...was she…?”
Tony looked grimly at Steve’s built form, slumped dejectedly in the ornate chair, and tried to distract himself from questions of how Steve could or couldn’t interact with the physical world (
He’d been sure of the accuracy of the identity, and their connection, from the way he’d verified and tested facts and details in talking to him, and the fact that SHIELD was taking this seriously seemed to verify the identity of the man they’d found. So his best bet now was that it must have been some sort of astral projection letting Steve’s consciousness escape his frozen corporeal body… Which, fine, didn’t make any more sense than ghosts, to Tony, in many ways, but it didn’t change his determination to go get Steve and see him for himself, alive and well. My God. That was a thought that staggered him every time he paused over it. Steve, alive, and possibly only a few reinforced floors away.
Tony could feel Coulson’s glare burning into him, and he tried to smother a laugh.
Shrugging, and running a hand along the row of monitors, pretending to be concerned over nonexistent dust, Tony didn’t answer.
“Aw, Tony, you don’t gotta be vulgar and sacrilegious all at once like that--”
“Or, you’re welcome to come hang out at my house,” and he gestured back at Coulon and Fury, “cause Mom and Dad totally said you can come over, as long as you finish your homework and go to bed at a reasonable time.”
“Take me to Steve Rogers, and then we can all see just how much I know or don’t know, huh?”
Steve interrupted. “I think I got it. Although I don’t know if that means only just what you said you were, or not, but that’s...that’s me too. I thought I’d marry Peggy and the other half of how I felt wouldn’t ever matter, you know? Bucky --my best friend Bucky, you know?-- used to tease me about Peggy, but I think he was just relieved.”
Tony waved away his concern, “Aw, Steve, it’s the future! And the tabloids have known I’m bisexual since I very publicly, and accidentally, outed myself with a boyfriend in my younger, hedonist years. Howard did not like that, I can tell you.”
“Sir, the ongoing alerts we’ve programmed into SHIELD’s networks have been activated.”
Steve huffed and looked away. “Almost easier to list the things I
He waited a long moment for a reaction, any reaction, and had just started to mentally review possible next steps if Steve were in fact unconscious, when he heard his breathing change, and snapped his eyes over in time to see Steve blink slowly and look right at him.
“What is it?”
been dead the entire time they’d been communicating, he’d had a moment of quiet panic.
Fury’s face had grown more pinched as Tony had talked, and now he glowered at him.
“On the contrary, Sir, you showed little evidence of the physical signs most commonly correlated with dream activity in current scientific literature. And by your own history, you exhibited few of the benchmarks of a sleep cycle which would typically be followed by your commentary on vivid dreams, and none of the hallmarks of a sleep cycle that would normally precipitate a call to Rhodey to recount ‘all the disturbing elements of your muddied subconscious.’ His words, Sir.”
“The primary focus seems to be on the set-up and usage of the Vita-Rays, as well as some of the later notes made regarding possible future recovery of Captain America, and proposed recuperative or medicinal use of the Vita-Rays and other technologies. Specifically their application in regards to enhanced individuals.”
Tony waved away his question. “Steve! Listen! What else is something you knew, that I shouldn’t know, that I might be able to look up?”
Great, even the imaginary Cap was disappointed that Tony wasn’t Howard.
The sudden flare of light resolved into Steve’s familiar shape, and Tony immediately set down the vintage shield and launched into conversation, spreading out the current blueprints on the desk, without needing to wait to see if Steve had followed.
He answered, gloomily, “I’m real. I’m not Howard, but I’m real.”
But now.
But it might be a stretch to get away with swanning in to rescue the super-soldier who was most likely here--
But his second thought was panic, as the man reached out to him, and said, plaintively, “...Howard?”
After at least an hour, or maybe only 15 minutes, he splashed some scotch into a glass and hastily downed it. It was entirely too early to be drinking, but he felt too panicky to avoid it. He debated calling Rhodey, and almost immediately discarded the idea. For obvious crazy-sounding reasons, he hadn’t shared this particular detail of his recent life with Rhodey, and he was just clear-headed enough to realize that now, while he was twitchy and worried and feeling decidedly unhinged, would not be the best time to convincingly share the tale.
Tony was pacing, agitated, and Steve had backed up out of the way, not that he could have actually been in the way.
Sometime later, somewhere between wakefulness and sleep, he heard a chime from Jarvis, out in the hallway, and stumbled out as quickly as he could, on sleep-dulled limbs.
Tony scrambled over to see the holographic map hovering, with several dots along the Eastern seaboard and one awfully suspicious dot far up north.
“Steve! Steve, are you here?”
Coulson was right outside the doors as they slid open, and Tony had to hide a grin at being anticipated so well. As much as he enjoyed aggravating Fury & Co, and God did he enjoy it, elements like this, where they matched his moves, helped keep the game feeling playful.
“I see. You know, most significant displays, historical or otherwise, typically take some time to set-up. Overlooking the fact that you weren’t invited, you’re also too early for good manners.”
He had a cup of coffee.
“I guess it really is just you, though, so maybe you’re right. I don’t ever see any other ghosts around, and most people look right through me. I have to focus sometimes, even just for you to see me. But it is getting easier, it’s hardly any effort at all to see you now.”
Testing a hunch, he crossed back over to the glass to talk to Fury, projecting his voice just a bit more than was strictly necessary.
Fury cleared his throat. “Coulson, I already regret this, but what would you say is top of the wishlist, were I to consider this nonsense.”
were real.”
It never quite stopped bothering Tony, the sheer unscientific nature of it, feeling like a druid or a warlock, holding this apparently mystical token and calling Steve back from the

He was prone to go haring off immediately, fixing problems with all the subtlety of a jackhammer, but when necessary, he could
is. Also, no one’s ever seen me before. Sometimes I thought...But no one’s ever spoken to me before.”
Who knew if Steve would’ve ever intentionally made the connection between them, if he’d actually had a choice, but now he would have a choice, and Tony would have to find a way to muscle in enough to give Steve the opportunity to leave with him if he wanted, while still leaving enough space for Steve to leave to somewhere else if he wanted. Which he’d probably want, right?
Long past time to go to Steve.
Coulson nodded grimly at one of the techs in the room with them, who turned the terminal to Tony. Fury stood near the large glass observation window, brooding down at the unconscious man. Coulson let Tony look over the records a moment, before saying, “He’s apparently in stable condition, and all his vital signs are promising, but so far he’s remained unconscious.”
Captain America rocked back on his heels. He looked more sad than offended. “I’m sorry, I’m being rude. I’m Ste-”
Tony nodded calmly. “Right, well, good to hear he’s not a prisoner. But we all know that I’ve got any and all tech he could possibly need for health monitoring, so since we’ve established that he’s a person and not a place or thing, if the man himself
“I’m Tony Stark, and you’re Captain America. Of course I know your name, we practically grew up together!” Tony huffed a laugh at his own quip, but Steve looked perplexed.
“...Then impervious, and now impermanent--or is it too permanent?” Tony finished the thought, with a rough laugh. “That might’ve been helpful for any drinking contests, but painful when you had downtime you’d rather turn into drowntime. I don’t remember many leisure stories from my dad, did you get any leave time?”
Tony hefted himself up and rummaged through the stacked belongings on the side of the room, shifting boxes until he triumphantly raised a record and tipped it like a salute at Steve. “We need music, yeah? Something from your time.”
It had irked him, at first, to have to actually use a printer and paper again, but during his rant to himself in the lab, waiting for the oversized pages to print from the industrial plotter, the pointed comments from Jarvis, his sentient AI system, had slowed him down a bit.
So let Fury talk himself out.
“It wasn’t the Riot Act, Sir, it was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or federal legal code 18 U.S.C. § 1030. But if I may refocus your attention, the alerts triggered were all of Stark contributions to Operation Rebirth, or the Super-Soldier serum program.”
He’d started walking toward the exit as he talked, and Fury shrugged and waved him out, looking fatigued with the whole conversation, as Coulson quickly transcribed the agreed list.
But now, as the elevator smoothly clicked through the levels, he felt that uncommon hesitation when his own forward momentum slowed enough to let him over-think, in the worst way.
There was a lot to unpack there, and he’d really rather not.
Cocky grin back in place, he shoved through the doors and called out, “Honey, I’m home!” He shot a wink up at Coulson looking down with annoyance from the room above, and swaggered over to the hospital bed. He picked up the chart and in a low voice, started to talk to Steve.
Steve looked shellshocked. “It was such a dangerous secret back then. Hardly anyone knew--” He cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Almost no one knew that. About me.” He’d squared his shoulders to look up at Tony, but his face betrayed his nervousness.
Then another.
Tony nodded manically, “Sure, but even seeing a ghost wouldn’t be particularly believable, but this...verified information, that’s… wow.”
“--Sorry, Steve. And then you remember occasionally, well,
He toyed with the idea of leading Steve to his lab space eventually, but somehow the timing had never felt right. Something about the brightness and sterility of the workspace, compared with the comparative coziness of the study, always shifted the balance, and he’d never yet attempted to bridge that mental gap. Besides, Steve’s connection to the study was rapidly redeeming Tony’s colder memories of the room, and since he was all about improvements, it worked out well. It had taken Tony long enough to eventually tell Steve the rest of what he’d already admitted to the world at that press conference, that he was Iron Man, but it was surprisingly difficult to work in to their deep and meandering talks, and just like the conference, no, he wouldn’t be taking any questions about why that was.
“Well, it’s...nice to meet you. Tony, you said your name was? I’m sorry, but I don’t remember you.”
“Join the club, pal.”
Steve’s face was shocked now.
some of your old haunts ---eh, couldn’t resist!--- like your childhood apartment, and the SSR headquarters in London. But never here, before?”
The coffee was cold but his blood was still hot. He’d spent longer than he’d wanted looking through SHIELD’s recent digital activity, including the files he’d flagged originally, trying to force himself to wait for more information, but the certainty was growing in his heart as well as his mind. SHIELD had found, or at least believed they’d found, Steve, his Steve. After a last review of Jarvis's notes on what had been accessed, and where and when, especially the changes over the hours since he’d last looked at the original files, he got dressed, fastening the watch on his wrist like a gauntlet. And then he picked up the briefcase with the actual gauntlets, and all the rest of his Iron Man suit, and marched for the door. He backtracked a bit awkwardly to grab the shield, ruining his rhythm a bit, but as he went to open the door, he paused a moment. The briefcase suit in one hand, and the shield in the other, and the chance at possibly actually putting his hands on Steve, the real Steve, in the flesh, overwhelmed him. But this was an urgent and possibly desperate matter, and there was a high probability he'd have the need to lay hands on anyone interfering along the way, too, so he shook himself and strode out the door.
“I’m still not sure where
Tony was mostly sober already now, and the intensity of Steve’s voice sobered him up further.
Steve nodded, distantly.
“What?? Steve, are you cheating on me with other living beings?! You can hang out with all the undead as much as you like, but if I’m not your only haunting, I’ll be very put out.”
“Here is New York, of course, the capital of the world. And yes, I’m very special too, tell me all about it.”
Steve furrowed his brow now, and followed Tony’s progress back into the study, saying slowly, “Well, my mother’s name was Sarah, my commanding officer was Colonel Phillips, I was sick all the time growing up, I-- I’m not sure what you want to know.”
“How do you know my name? Who are you?”
Tony was Iron Man now. Iron Man wasn’t afraid of anything, but that sort of hyped self-confidence wasn’t why he’d wandered in here tonight. Obie’s betrayal and death had prompted such a wave of conflicted grief, it was probably inevitable that he’d end up drinking alone in the study, again, eventually. It wasn’t his favorite form of destructive self-flagellation, sprawled incoherent amongst the rest of his father’s abandoned life’s work, but it was nevertheless not an isolated event.
He could wait for the next real conversation he’d have with Steve, back in the study, things much the same but completely different, in-person finally. Or maybe they’d get crazy and actually visit another room in the huge mansion for once. Well, no hurry to decide any of that. Finally, they’d be in the same place at the same time, and with all the time in the world.
Steve pulled his undershirt on and practically skipped out of the room.
“Daaadddd,” Peter groaned.
“BUT have you ever tried
I learned a lot from writing this series and it was fun getting feedback!
“M’ ok,” Wade mumbled, seeing the revulsion in Peter’s eyes. Peter began to hyperventilate again just seeing Wade in this state. Wade’s fingers twitched against him as if to somehow comfort him.
As Steve humped into Tony’s hold, he dug his fingers into Tony’s ass and encouraged him to move with him.
"Hap-," Peter groaned.
Bucky shook his head and got to his feet. He wordlessly walked away and Tony let him go even though everything inside him was telling him to chase after his friend and make him believe it’d all be okay…but, he didn’t know that. He didn’t know how this was all going to turn out in the end for Bucky. The man went through countless horrors and some people wouldn’t be able to handle that knowledge. Only time would tell if Bucky could…
“It would, thank you,” she stated, crossing her arms over her chest.
"Do you just fix car engines or do you spend your time making things explode?" Jim sarcastically replied.
James stood just outside of the quinjet by the open hatch where Tony and Bruce were working. She was not looking at him but she could feel his eyes watching her.
Time to go get Steve.
“I see my dulcet tones woke you up, Sleeping Beauty. So what do you think, Stark or SHIELD, pick a team. The menacing one-eyed crow you can see lurking over my shoulder up there is Director Fury, and you’re welcome to continue to rely on his dubious hospitality if you’d like. Not that I don’t trust Fury! He’s a great guy, if you can overlook the ominous henchman look he’s got going on and the fact that he replaced his personality with another gun a few years back.”
“Why?”
“Yes. Just remember to eat and drink well before getting sleep.”
Steve quickly checked which way the bedroom was so he could steer them there while concentrating on unclothing Tony. “Not necessarily.”
”Okay.”
“I'll take you to SHIELD,” he said after a while.
“Don't know about that. I do like cock, though,” Steve said.
Tony seemed to almost say something, but in the end didn't. Steve was glad, since it would have probably revealed Johnny's identity, or at the very least been something embarrassing.
“You don't need elaborate plans for that. I promise I'm easy,” Steve said and started to pull Tony towards the elevator.
“I can look for pants, I suppose,” the doctor stated uncertainly.
“Right.”
“I don't mean too big, but still, I'm glad we're not dating since pretty much all of you would seriously harm my masculinity,” Johnny said jokingly.
“It's your nickname,” Tony mumbled against his neck.
“Well. I wouldn't really mind, but the condom must be uncomfortable,” Steve said after trying to find the right words for a moment.
Gay meant homosexual meant a guy who like men.
“Yeah, just – a bullet in my shoulder.”
Steve couldn't help smiling.
”It won't be like teaching to use a bow and an arrow, but I'll take what I can.”
“And now he learned about my thing with Johnny Storm,” Steve said dryly, not really caring anymore.
That was okay.
The next time he woke Steve, Tony was nursing his hangover in the bathroom and Steve didn't think it was the best time for a talk.
“Come back,” he said to Tony when the man hesitated at the bathroom door, just to be sure.
It was ridiculous, sure, since Storm had invited him to make out, and they both knew what was coming, and neither of them couldn't not be aware of the tension between them.
again and then mumbled something about his suit, but relaxed when they'd got to the car and even cracked a joke about Steve being his arm candy.
Steve wasn't a person who dealt in hate, not really. Sure, there were people, things, like the Red Skull that raised anger, contempt and even hate in him, but that happened in a more abstract level. He didn't spend any time deliberately torturing himself by thinking about how disgustingly greedy and ruthless the Skull had been, how awful the war had been. He wouldn't forget, but he didn't let it fill him with hate and eat him alive.
So, in the end it meant that he masturbated at least every morning and night, sometimes twice in a row.
Steve blushed slightly. “I thought you weren't going to look,” he said.
Steve was weirdly warmed by Tony's vehemence.
Steve was having the bullet removed from his shoulder. He wasn't given any local anesthetics, since they didn't really work on him. The only way to not feel pain during operations was being put to sleep, but he always vetoed that unless absolutely necessary.
“You spent the night with him! After telling me you weren't interested in him!”
And wasn't that what Johnny had said in the first place?
Nothing was stopping him from going to Tony and telling him that he raised such a myriad of feelings in Steve, from frustration and annoyance to the more recent affection and lust that it was improbable that he was just acting out of loneliness. Maybe Tony would give him something in return.
Well. Not all he wanted.
*****
again.
On the way to wherever it came to Steve that it was the second time he was going out as in doing something outside the tower that wasn't something mundane or job-related. And the second time only if you counted the shawarma after the Loki mess.
“Okay,” Steve said even though Tony had completely missed the point. Which was that he couldn't use any normal underwear under the suit pants. He usually had a jockstrap, anyway, for obvious reasons. But the boxers he now had on just wouldn't fit.
“I like your face just fine, but I think I love your ass. I mean,” Storm said and leaned down again, mouthing at Steve's neck, “I could even go for rimming.”
“Oh my God,” Clint moaned.
Well. Their place had been so small and miserable that it would have been crazy to stay there all day. You would have gone crazy.
”So, what do I need to do to get into those pants?”
And that was it, the date, more or less. Storm drove him back, taking a lot longer route than before. Steve wasn't sure if it was to show off some sights or his driving skills or if he just didn't want the date to end.
After that it went quickly became Johnny returning the favor, with Steve lying on his back on the sofa and Johnny kneeling between his legs.
“Okay,” he said.
Just a few minutes of waiting and Storm slid next to Steve with his bike.
“Everything.”
“I hope he was good to you.”
”What kind of a friend?” Natasha asked as she turned to really look at him.
And then he thought
Steve leaned a bit backwards to fight his jacket completely off while Tony opened their belts and pants' fastenings.
He pulled out then and went to the bathroom to throw the condom away and clean up a bit. Steve lay on top of his own come on the bed and decided that he was comfortable enough. At least Tony couldn't get the wrong idea and go to the workshop or something if Steve stayed on
“I'm actually staring,” Tony said after a beat.
Although Steve really didn't think he was that good company, very much the opposite actually. So perhaps Storm was just lost.
“We're trying to get Cap to tell us who's the lucky girl,” Natasha said and Steve thought that hunger would have been preferable to this.
“Come here,” Tony said and Steve went, positioning himself atop Tony, kissing him more. But when Tony closed his hand around him, he stopped moving.
Steve was just about to suggest that Tony leave the team then, if working in it was such a hardship for him, but stopped himself by biting his cheek. They needed Tony and it wasn't always this bad. And it wasn't war and they weren't the army and his team should be able to come up to him if they didn't like how he did things.
Before Steve could come up with anything, the elevator doors opened to admit Tony and Bruce. “What's up, children?”
“Nothing really. Well. I congratulated him for banging you.”
“No, it's fine. Can I go now?”
”Okay, boss,” Happy said coolly, but Steve saw his amused expression form the rearview mirror. Could they be any more obvious?
, Steve thought ruefully.
They had moved to the sofa and Storm had put the TV on. Steve wasn't at all interested in the show, and he didn't think Storm was either. Steve had already finished his drink, but wasn't going to make the first move.
Well, he did apologize.
“Bed?” He asked.
Storm opened his eyes and checked the clock. ”Steve, it's past midnight. You can bunk here, I don't mind.”
“I'll just go now,” Steve said and started to walk away with his plate.
Steve wasn't exactly dying, but was surprised at Tony's little speech, made jokingly or no.
Right.
“So we're not – dating?”
And then.
”And yet there you were kissing him – ”
Steve was slightly surprised, since Tony didn't usually offer rides for them. Then he saw that the arm of his suit was almost completely drenched in blood. Steve wanted to decline still, but knew that if he lost his consciousness due to blood loss, he would be a nuisance to carry around.
“You don't seem to be dancing with joy either,” Tony pointed out.
Like suddenly realizing he wasn't alone, Tony whipped his head towards Steve. And now his face wasn't emotionless anymore, but almost pained or angry.
“I'm deeply offended,” Steve tried.
”I mean, you got to be something pretty special to become, to be, Captain America, yeah?”
Tony nodded. “So we're – exclusive?”
“Really, please keep on going, I don't mind,” Clint said as he stepped into the elevator and pushed the button to the communal floor beneath Tony's penthouse.
“Well, I'm not sure I can wait.”
Steve couldn't quite look at Clint and he couldn't answer to Tony either so he decided to look at the floor and pretend he wasn't there.
”Out,” Steve said, really wanting to just go to his own room, but Jesus he was hungry. He hadn't eaten anything at Storm's. Johnny's. So he went to the fridge, piling up a huge plate of everything.
He didn't actually see Tony until the next day when he was going for breakfast.
”Okay.”
of all things.
“Faster,” Steve commanded, pushing into Johnny's fist.
“Yeah, okay, for a minute, but then I have to – “
”It would have,” Tony said tightly. ”I had run the numbers, it would have worked just fine. But what's the point in trying to explain you anything when you don't trust me?!”
“What?” Steve laughed. “Don't like my face?”
Steve was just about to decline when he realized that he was scared of a little bike ride with Storm. That he was a bit ridiculous. If Storm drove a bike, and a nice one as well, it was very possible that he didn't have a car or didn't even think to take one. It might not be a plan to get Steve to sit snugly behind him.
“Yeah,” Steve complied. But not the way Sue meant.
What.
Johnny looked a bit uncomfortable. “Okay. I usually don't really date – “
Although he had no one who he could have texted with, really. The team lived mostly in the Tower. Coulson texted him sometimes, but his messages rarely needed any answers. They were usually just updates that he would get in briefings anyway.
He did, however, pull Tony in for one last kiss before the man climbed off him and out of the car.
He wasn't disappointed.
“Is he here too?”
Storm smiled. ”Don't say that yet, you're going to love it.”
His hair was slightly damp, Steve noticed. And now that he thought about it, and how Storm had smelled when Steve had come inside, it was obvious that he had very recently showered, shaved and washed his teeth. And he had a nice button down shirt and snug black jeans on.
Okay. They waited their food in silence then, giving Steve time to stare at Storm. It wasn't like looking into a mirror, thank God, but they could be brothers. Storm's features were softer and a bit rounder, he had darker hair and he was shorter and leaner. But they had the same eyes and mouth.
“I wouldn't do casual with you anyway.”
Oh. “You want me to – ?”
?” Steve repeated.
He'd gladly be masturbating right now, to be honest, but instead he was bored out of his mind at some sort of national security themed gala. He had a lot of people wanting to talk to him, and he went along with it politely, but most of his attention was focused on trying to catch Tony's eye from the other side of the room.
“Babe, please, I have to – “
“What?!”
”I was at a... friend's place,” Steve said then, suddenly wanting to volunteer some information.
Tony scoffed. “So you could what? Break up with me politely?”
Steve welcomed the slight pain of it because it cleared his mind a bit. At least until he started to think more closely about what exactly caused it.
Tony leaned back onto his arm, sliding it right next to Steve’s and positioned his face inches from the super soldier’s. He replied, “Nah, they’re just fine.”
Steve blushed furiously and wondered if Tony was being this open on purpose. He always liked to make Steve flustered and it certainly was working now.
Peter took a sip from his coffee then made a face. It had grown cold.
Trembling, Tony slipped from Steve’s side and lightly touched Bruce’s shoulder.
Steve gripped his mug tighter, overcome with emotion, and whispered, “I can never thank you enough, Father…You’ve done so much for me and barely know me…”
Steve’s eyes stayed on Tony only long enough to see him skid to a stop. Tony had not been expecting the move so Steve was not surprised to see a look of shock strewn across his face and half his fake beard fall off.
Captain Steve –
Norman bent down and ripped the glove off the severed arm.
. His stomach clenched with shame. He shouldn’t let himself become so excited by this.
Tony chuckled darkly and murmured, “That’s a sore subject…”
Tony closed his eyes and gulped dryly.
A content silence fell between them and, through half lidded eyes, Steve watched the curtains move, reflecting on the everything that had occurred since they last slept in this room.
Steve said goodbye to the soldiers and he and Tony began their walk back. He held the basket, now weighed down by the coals, close to himself. Yes, he’d sleep warmly tonight, but...but he didn’t have to sleep alone again either…
He drew his other leg onto the lounge chair and slotted it between Steve’s legs. He heard Steve inhale sharply and Tony met his gaze. His eyes were wide and staring at Tony and only Tony. He was no longer looking for the photographers.
Steve smiled and nodded but he could not help but ironically think that Tony had said the same thing for the preliminary hearing. He pushed the thought away but he could feel it festering in the back of his mind.
“Guys?” Peter’s voice called out, sounding closer.
and I need you to know, in case…” He couldn’t finish the statement. It was too painful to say aloud. Tony’s eyes were locked with Steve’s, even when he pressed their foreheads together.
“Crawl over to me on your hands and knees and kiss my boot and I will command my solider to remove the syringe,” the Red Skull stated haughtily.
“You’ll do great,” Tony promised, tearing Steve’s eyes away from the crowd. He grasped Steve’s cheek and kissed him with a happy hum. He pulled away and opened the door with a smirk. He whispered to Steve, “Please excuse my eccentric behavior for next ten minutes because I am going to show you off and gush.”
“No takie backsies!” Tony gasped childishly and tightened his hold on Steve’s hand, drawing a laugh from Steve.
“More like ‘in’ his chest,” Bucky corrected.
“…What did you just say?” Stark hissed disbelievingly, his voice bordering on explosive anger.
The building held them up so they arrived at the island a little after their anniversary but that just seemed to perfectly picture their relationship: good things happening a little later.
“My – my parents – my mom –
His master slapped him across the face with the gun, hard enough to break bone. Natasha hissed when she heard his cheek bone give. James fell into her and she cradled him protectively.
Days passed.
“Feel you up?” Wade teased, running his hands down Peter’s back and then squeezing his ass. Peter squawked in surprise and Wade let him go with a laugh.
He arrived just as Venom turned its ire from Wade to Peter. Wade dropped the metal pole he’d been fighting with and launched himself at the symbiote as it wrapped its tendrils around Peter’s neck and slammed his head against the pavement. Peter’s head bounced like a rubber ball and blood sprinkled the ground.
Steve laughed and announced, “He’s awake!”
“Here they come!” Peter yelled and then leapt forward. Their final five combatants were charging toward them out of the parting smoke. Steve zeroed in on the man with a body of sand and followed his son out into the field.
“I am walking away,” Logan said.
He hoped he wasn't alone, that may be in some parallel paradox Bucky and Natasha were living out the rest of their lives.
“…But…if you’re using that analogy, wouldn’t that mean Venom was going to come back?”
One of the mercenaries hit him across the back of his skull before he got the chance to open his mouth. He fell and was unconscious before he landed on top of Steve.
At the end of the chapter the gang will be watching a video feed with subtitles instead of "quotation marks" I used [brackets] as the foreign language was being spoken! Now you know!
Tony sparred the far-left screen one last glance. He'd left that screen dedicated to Jarvis keeping him updated on the intruder but, when he saw nothing new about the stranger, he leaned forward and put all of his focus back into the Mark III.
“There’s only so much I can do, Sir, when you give the world’s press your home address,” Jarvis stated sardonically.
With his heartbeat slowing with his growing melancholy, Tony ironically whispered, “I didn’t think so…”
Wade squeaked and gripped Peter’s shoulders tightly and pushed him back. He gasped, “Wait, Pete! Wait!”
Because not only were his company’s weapons being sold to terrorists but Obie admitted to betraying him and to being the one selling the company's arms under the table.
“The Colonel wants the team to be ready in an hour,” she stated, taking a step back.
Tony turned onto his side, facing away from Steve, and grumbled, “Go away, Steve.”
“Tell me, Captain, do you remember how you met your soulmate?”
He sighed again, this time more lightly.
“And neither of us are going to wear a scrap of clothing the entire time,” Tony added.
Eddie didn’t catch the signal and continued, “Damn, no way! Is he a supe?”
He was so close to Tony, so close to starting the rest of their lives. He prayed Tony was better. He wished it with all of his soul.
“Wade,” Peter sighed. The hushed voice was like a siren, spurning Wade into action. He placed a protective hand on Peter’s head and then with the other violently pulled down on his body, throwing his boyfriend onto the hard ground.
“So a movie…?”
He wanted to save his son but he still feared death. He closed his eyes tightly and was struck with the memory of his near-death experience in the artic decades prior. He shuddered as he remembered his muscles hardening and freezing and that icy water burning his insides as it filled his lungs. It had been slow and torturous.
He was jerked back into reality when he accidentally got too close and rubbed his erection into Tony’s inner thigh. The sensation rocked Steve right to the bone. It felt amazing but it also revealed to Tony that Steve was turned on.
, not the mask, but
Tony shook his head and reached out to Steve. Steve grasped Tony's hand firmly and Tony assured him, “I will be fine. We’ve seen the future. We know I will make it…”
“Natalia,” she whispered.
perfect. Throughout the ceremony, Tony kept glancing offstage, to where he knew his son was sitting. The ceremony would have been absolutely perfect if Peter was standing up there with the rest of their collective family.
Tony instantly felt like a douche and turned to his husband with broken expression. He sat beside Steve and grasped his hands, whispering, “
Later that night, when Tony woke with a muffled scream, he was met Steve’s cross gaze.
Next time, Ch. 4: Clicked
Steve smiled diminutively at him when he turned from the stove and crossed the kitchen to place a plate down in front of him. He then rounded the counter, sat beside Tony, and began to eat from his own plate.
! I’ll be right behind you!”
“Yes,” Steve said and returned the sponge to the sink. He dried off his hands on a nearby towel.
“Jarvis, give me an update on everything that has happened.”
Coulson ticked an eyebrow and gave the doctor a level stare as he growled, “What did you say?”
The Goblin had
Thanks for all the comments, bookmarks, and kudos! Your support is awesome! :)
“…Pete…Why are you dressed like this?”
She handed him the notecards and he grinned as he replied, “No promises.”
Steve flushed deeply and he stuttered, “I-I l-like it.”
The suit was pressed onto him quickly and he would have bruises later but Tony made it do just that because the threat was real and he needed to be in his suit
He raised his gauntleted hand as the power of the infinity stones burned into him. His entire right side felt like it was on fire. He was shaking. His mortal body was no match for the strength of the stones. But he pressed his middle finger and thumb together and still managed to defiantly hiss to that purple monster, “I am Iron Man.”
All of the other people in the building, who were not a part of the Avenger's, were Tony’s employees and had been handpicked by Pepper. They were trusted to not leak anything but Tony was sure to remind them that their employment included a privacy clause, which, if violated, would lead to their immediate termination and an immediate lawsuit. The few that actually knew of Peter and the truth of his existence were monitored by Jarvis and knew they were being monitored by Jarvis so Steve doubted they would have any trouble with them.
Tony took a step toward his workstation when Jarvis added, “Sir..?”
Both stopped though their expressions clearly told him it was the last thing they wanted to do.
Cable chuckled and said, “Oh, it will be, but it won’t be involving you much, don’t worry.” His hand hovered over the glove, but he paused and said, “Goodbye, Cap, Stark. I think it’s safe for me to say you two can finally continue that reunion now.”
Logan’s eyes flickered over him and then he murmured, “Nice to see your face.”
Steve tensed, his mind racing with questions, and she seemed to have sensed them as she silenced them all by saying, “His mind was fragile. He could barely remember his past and he did not know how he had attained his power. SHIELD doesn’t want anyone to know someone else had managed to make a super soldier.”
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes at the man’s joke. But Howard didn’t drop his nose and he rose his eyebrows in question as if he were wondering when Tony was going to start spewing praises.
Steve smoothed back the damp hair on his forehead and lightly kissed him there.
Howard chose that moment to clear his throat. Tony finally looked at him and found Howard studying him with an intense gaze. He stated, “What’s done is done. I know now and there’s no way I’m going to be ignoring this…you – you’re my son from the future.”
Such knowledge made Steve enraged.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It will be,” Howard swore.
The doctor peered inside and then turned to them, saying, “No one’s here but there’s a message for us.”
“Tony,” Steve gasped and he remembered his body’s condition and quickly sat at the counter to hide it. Tony stood on the other side of the counter and was in the middle of making coffee. He too looked like he just rolled out of bed and was wearing flannel pajama bottoms and nothing else. Steve’s eyes were drawn to the glowing arc reactor in Tony’s chest then trailed down, taking in his defined muscles and the little trail of hair that disappeared into his waistband. Steve flushed and dropped his gaze before Tony noticed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You said you had wanted to be with me, is it so wrong to want it now?” Bucky asked.
Rogers was also completely naked and Tony whistled as he took in the fine specimen. He turned to Bruce and said, “I likey.”
So Steve ran.
Tony snorted, “I imagined a much more exotic honeymoon.”
“Thank you, Buck,” Steve gasped, tightly grasping his arm. “You saved his life.”
, he got the idea from our project! A sentry is practically the same thing as a shield! It protects!”
“Yes! You still haven’t won her over yet so you failed! We’ll start Project Winterwidow Part Four tomorrow!
“Are they still on site?”
Oddly, Steve reflected, Steve probably looked just like Tony and this expression was what Bucky saw as he fell from the train…His heart wretched at the unfairness of the situation. Once again, just when he thought things were going to be alright, it was all being taken from him.
Peter nodded to him and stated, “Five more and they all have different fighting styles. Dad, stay away from Electro. Wade can deal with him. You’re going to have to handle the Vulture as you’re the only one who can fly like him. I’ll take care of Doc Oct and Pops can have Sandman. And, yes, their name’s are going to be a dead giveaway to their appearances.”
The concept of a home was…unusual.
“…You are not leading this where I think you are leading this,” she threatened. The arms crossed against her chest tightened.
“I thought I lost you,” Steve gasped into Tony’s shoulder.
Steve looked back to Bruce and Bruce supplied, “Unless some super villain cursed him, this has to be an effect of the gamma-radiation.”
A number of police officers and firemen were already getting fed. Several people called out to Tony as he landed beside Steve and a handful more came over to clap his back and thank him. Tony accepted the thanks and turned the thanks back onto the same men and women who had been working tirelessly all day.
Howard, however, was very obviously on edge.
“I don’t know what happened but don’t give up on him just yet. I’ve seen the way he looks at you. He loves you! He wouldn’t have fallen out of love so easily. Promise me you’ll talk to him,” Pepper implored.
Wade nibbled on Peter's skin on the side of his inner thigh and teased, “You're wearing a watch that is broken.”
“Still stuck with me,” Tony whispered and did a half shrug with his good shoulder.
Steve had somehow convinced himself that Rhodes was helping him. He had tried reaching out to the other soldier and received no reply so he assumed he was with Tony. Steve ground his teeth. He had assumed wrong. Tony was still working alone.
Simply thinking about it, however, brought him joy. He couldn’t wait for more dates with Tony. Every day he had with his fiancé was precious.
“Let’s get your dad back into bed, huh? He doesn’t look too comfy,” Bruce whispered.
The spinning in Steve’s head intermingled with the guilt and made him feel sick. He mutely handed his son to Tony and his boyfriend accepted him with a relieved sigh. Tony promised, “Peter and I will be right here this entire time, Steve…”
He had two nurses: one pushed him and the other pushed the pole with the IV bags on it. Bruce followed close behind and watched Tony with a critical eye, looking for any sigh that he needed to be returned to bed.
“Not all of them,” Wade quickly countered.
“Remind me never again to fly with Clint,” Tony grumbled into his ear. Steve scoffed but adjusted his hold to look the engineer over. Tony’s suit was mostly whole but was severely dented and several punctures dotted where the armor’s weaker joints and suit connections met. Steve reached behind Tony’s neck where the fingerprint scan was to open Tony’s suit for him. Usually the suit would open fluidly without a sound but, as soon as it registered Steve’s fingerprint, it groaned and hissed as it came apart.
“Did Mommy and Daddy have a fight?” Clint teased, elbowing Tony in the side.
Steve shot Tony an apologetic look and turned back to his son before he could reply to Tony. One of Peter’s hands was resting on the couch and he was turned toward Steve. He asked, “Is dis awive?”
I want to see the ships again.”
Sirens could be heard approaching and Peter sarcastically said, “Oh, now they show up!”
’s movements interfering with his schedule. He usually uses his lackies for that...”
Steve could have pulled away, instead, he leaned in and returned the kiss, mirroring Tony’s lazy caress. Tony wrapped a hand around Steve’s back to keep his balance and Steve also wound his arm around him but only to draw him closer.
He’d never operated without his master’s word and he’d never owned anything, not even his own body…
Steve took a deep breath and transferred his hands to Tony’s hips as he smiled up at him. He whispered, “You
They reached the remains of the Avengers facility in no time and Steve exited the car with a heavy heart.
Tony gently pushed himself out of Steve’s embrace and he felt Steve’s fingers spasm slightly, like he almost was going to pull him back. He hated the idea of giving Steve false hope, but he stated, “There may be a way I can fight this…not totally stop it but stall it long enough for me to get back to the future.”
“I think I aged well,” Tony continued, leaning into Steve’s side. “Sure, you got the All-American Man going on but I have a suave, sophisticated Cary Grant thing going on.”
Steve gulped back the emotions that welled up. He could not deny his attraction for Tony, it had only grown since Tony helped them out and showed such an interest in Peter. Yet Steve pushed back the new emotions as he had with Bucky. Eventually, he would be able to totally smother them with Tony too.
Steve chuckled and felt his shoulders relax. They had tensed ever since Tony left but he was coming home now. If he was open to a sexual activities then he was certainly giving Steve a chance. He hadn’t lost Tony yet. Everything was going to be alright.
“The Goblin created Venom himself. He made it so it could fuse with Peter’s arachnid DNA. As my master so eloquently put it, ‘There’s no stopping Peter’s evolution.’ What’s done is done. He is Venom now.”
“It was civil! Between you two that’s almost as if I threw Steve down on the table and ravished him in front of everyone!”
Due to reactions to the prior chapter, I just wanted to elaborate that the suit is a reflection of the future. Just as in Back to the Future, items from the future changed based upon what they did. Change one thing and it can cause a butterfly effect to the future and their budding romance is definitely something that will attract a lot of butterflies;D
“And if you do, I’ll take away your tablet,” Steve added to his son. Peter paled like he had just threatened his life.
Peter was sleeping. Even in sleep, his small hands were latched tightly onto Tony’s hospital gown as if he expected to be torn from his side at any moment.
Tony crossed the ceiling as quickly as the boots would allow. Switching from the ceiling to the wall was a little difficult but the end result was rewarding.
“Yes,” Peter whispered, lightly nuzzling his face against Wade’s.
The Soldier’s eyes narrowed on her outstretched hand and then he looked to her again.
“Helloooo –
“Say it again,” Tony hummed, leaning toward him.
“That is not how we are going to announce to the world you two are together,” Pepper groaned, closing the door behind her.
“Most believe the North Star is the brightest star but it isn’t. The brightest isn’t even in either one of the dippers. It’s right…over…there.” Tony pointed but there were too many bright stars to pinpoint the brightest.
Peter dropped his head. None of them understood.
“Peter,” Steve whispered lowly, as if he was trying to calm a skittish animal. He must have looked horrible if Steve was talking to him as such.
Tony smirked and said, “I wish it were that easy, Pete.”
There was that name again.
He could only save Bucky.
Tony shoved the man away and screamed, “
“Steve’s got a piece of Venom on him! We’re going to the lab!” Clint stated from Steve’s side as he peered at the said substance.
Something exploded in the middle of their room and Tony would later ruminate that
Steve was too cute. He had to remember to tease him about it later.
He gasped with a heavy accent, “The American camp is over two hundred miles away. Did you walk that entire way?”
Tony rolled his eyes and gave her an annoyed look. When his eyes fell back on Steve they warmed and the flush returned, making Tony’s eyes drop to his chest. He murmured, “So …Steve…Here we are.”
Peter sighed in relief and tentatively grasped his arm and him press his hand against a triangular panel on the wall next to Steve’s lockers.
Tony knew Steve had mistaken SHIELD for Hydra but hearing those words come out of his mouth still made him tighten his hold on his super soldier.
“Oh God, please, no,” Steve smothered another chuckle. His erection had gone down but Steve was so enraptured by Tony he didn’t even notice. This easy communication between them was one of the reasons why Steve liked Tony so much. No matter the topic, if they were talking or even fighting, they flowed easily.
“Vision doesn’t smell right because he’s a synthetic humanoid,” Natasha stated, “He is a good person but he is not
Steve didn’t think it was possible to fall even more in love with him but he did.
He was afraid to go any closer so Natasha decided it needed to lose some of its power.
“Apparently, your life was in danger,” Tony replied, crossing his arms over his chest.
As their audience screamed excitedly, the Avengers came on stage wearing their best and Steve’s priest crossed the stage to stand with them.
Tony accepted the jar from Steve and murmured, “Thank you, Steve.”
“Wait…There’s one more thing we need,” Cable said suddenly and ran back to the house.
“I think I will stay,” Peter replied with a small smile for Tony. “Who can say no to popcorn?”
…I’m alright. I love you.”
Tony whistled and said, “Nope. I did not sleep a wink. But it’s alright. I do a lot of overnighters.”
Peter closed his eyes as he slid it over his face and he heard Pops inhale sharply behind him. Peter slowly opened his eyes and looked through the circuited fiberglass to meet the reflection of the same white eyes Venom bore when he had Peter under his control.
“Well, we don’t have to,” Tony reasoned with a frown. An odd pressure formed in his chest as he suggested, “Why don’t we pair you with someone you’re interested in? How about Sharon?”
“Staaaap,” Tony groaned.
Otherwise, the next couple of chapters are going to be heavily influenced by the Iron Man 3 movie. Since Steve is involved and Tony and Pepper are not in a relationship, the events are going to be drastically different.
It was only at that moment Tony happened to note the MK 15 marker was gone from the armor.
“There’s…” Bucky began, sounding unsure. He whispered, “There’s no pain?”
“Of course, why do you think the Sinister Six hate me so much. I don’t sit around and knit on the weekends,” Peter retorted.
Bucky slowly leaned forward then placed the gun near his feet at the foot of the bed. He leaned back and Clint shot forward and grabbed it before Bucky changed his mind. Natasha kept her gun on Bucky and hissed to Clint, “Search him.”
Natasha didn’t look away from her wayward mate and murmured, “Where is he, James?”
Which was why he shooed Peter out of his lab and snapped on some welding goggles and told Friday to call over Steve.
“…Are you two together?” Eddie asked, sounding confused.
survive. It’s haunted me ever since we sent you back, more dead than alive.”
But no one had a chance to stop him from lifting his hand and snapping his fingers.
Tony sighed contently and moaned, “I love you…”
Peter’s mind instantly went to sex and he flushed like a virgin. He was no virgin, hadn’t been for years but, he’d
Steve and Tony held each other tighter with Osborn’s words, but Tony’s grip tightened to an unbearable extent when the Goblin raised his hand, holding a glowing object.
He went into a sort of desperate trance and hours passed. His muscles ached from staying in the same position for so long but he watched until he was broken from his stupor by a sharp snore.
“…Tonight? If possible,” Peter practically groaned in suggestion.
It was adequate to sleep in but difficult to escape.
“What do expect when you wake me up so early after keeping me up all night?” Peter sleepily murmured.
Tony could not help but feel a little thrill from Steve’s shock. It looks like the SHIELD agent’s crush was one-sided. Tony continued, “Is there anyone?”
together.
Steve had no rebuttal so, without looking at Steve, Tony stated, “Steve, I’m busy.”
“TONY!” Steve screamed. “TONY NO!”
Steve reached out to Peter and traced the tips of his fingers along Peter’s cheek, where the cut once was. His stomach clenched uneasily. In all the drama that occurred in the wake of Ross’s attack Steve never once paused to think about the healed cut or what it meant for his son.
However, being alone with his mind was a problem…a brooding problem.
He nodded to a photobooth pushed off to the side.
“I will take it, sir,” the agent replied. Steve wordlessly handed him his duffel and the man said, “You’ll find this in your quarters on Air Force One.”
Steve was standing in front of him and Wade slowly released the tension created by his surprise. Steve had been standing on the other side of the room only moments ago and no one else seemed to notice their leader had crossed the room to speak with the dreg in the back.
Unlike Tony, he had waited behind and listened to the questions that were being asked. The press wanted to know all the intimate details of their relationship, even their sex life. Pepper answered all of the questions diplomatically or avoided them with a masterful redirect.
Wade gasped as their mouths collided again. It took him a few seconds to react, but he finally grasped Peter’s shoulders and leaned into the kiss with a sigh.
Tony's hands stilled and he gave his father his full attention.
“No way!” Tony gasped. He stepped past Steve to peer at Peter more closely.
Everyone got back to their feet feeling elated. The fight was won and the bad guys were strewn across the field, defeated. As soon as they were both standing again, Steve embraced Tony, holding him tightly to help his heart slow down.
Steve lazily smiled and murmured, “Yeah, but I love him.”
Steve nodded and asked, “Can I explain what is going to happen, to both of them?”
Bucky stomach turned and pushed back the memories of Zola’s experimentations on Bucky’s body.
“This is Deadpool,
Sophie stubbornly persisted, “In all seriousness, the rumors about you and De –.”
That night they held each other closely and it would have taken the combined strength of all the Avengers to tear them apart.
He meandered around the enormous building until he ventured into the gym. Once there he got into his usual routine, hitting the punching bag with rhythmic punches. He stayed in there, late into the night until his muscles burned and his fists ached.
Steve paused in strapping on his bulletproof vest and gasped, “You’re fighting with us?”
They ended up ordering out and got Thai delivered for dinner and stole some of Thor’s strawberry mochi for dessert. They ate in the early evening so it would not be too cold as they ate on the roof and watched the sky as the sun set. The buildings around them glimmered and the rosy glow of dusk swashed all within its sight with its flushed hue.
“Yeah, don’t get me started on the horror that was
Venom had been thwarted in feeding, first by the Avengers, then by the Goblin, and then by SHIELD. Every time Venom surfaced, the spy organization jumped on him within minutes, saving whoever he was trying to eat and, in turn, trying to capture the symbiote.
“So let me get this straight,” Clint started, finally gathering himself, “you've already bagged Johnny Storm and Tony Stark? Who's next, Hugh Hefner?”
Steve followed him and when Tony spread his legs to give Steve room between them, his arousal became almost painful. He gave Tony a short kiss, and went on to do what he had wanted already in the car. After licking off the drop of precome, he took Tony into his mouth.
Tony just went on. “Did he fuck you?”
”It's not just because of that,” Storm said.
And that was why he woke up hours later, early in the morning, Johnny's leg thrown over his thighs. It sort of hit him then that he had slept with Johnny Storm.
Upon his arrival, Tony needed only to take one glance at him before getting a pinched expression and Steve knew his hope had been in vain. How the hell was Tony so attuned to him in first place?
Dear God, he wanted to comment on the drinking, but reigned himself in at the last moment. Now was not the time to piss Tony off.
Not the least because of how it made his breath hitch when Tony parted his buttocks.
”I'll teach you, then.”
It was impossible not think about how it would feel if they were exactly like this, only with Tony riding him, his cock buried deep inside.
Steve thought that for a second. “Would you let me top?”
“So how's it going with you and your boyfriend?”
“Should I try it on here?”
Steve glanced at a still sleeping Johnny sprawled out next to him.
They were standing next to the bed, Tony shirtless and both without their shoes, a  feeling of excitement and anticipation lacing through Steve.
“It's great, Johnny,” Steve cut in, not wanting to be let down gently for something he didn't necessarily want in the first place.
That was. Really nice.
“I have someone else,” Steve said, deciding he could at least give the outline.
”Okay,” Steve said slowly, not really sure if he wanted Storm to elaborate.
”Fuck, Steve. Fuck”, Storm said and Steve found the cursing only appropriate.
Steve did and was rewarded with a deep groan. It turned Steve on too, sucking a man's cock, but he thought the biggest thrill was probably seeing the other's pleasure: hearing Johnny's breathing quickening, feeling how hard he was in his mouth. He started working his hand and mouth simultaneously, sucking every time he brought his mouth upwards.
Steve wasn't too comfortable categorizing himself like that, but seeing the spy twins surprised was quite funny.
“Shit.”
Natasha shook her head. “Had no idea,” she said and looked at Steve appraisingly.
Now Tony rose to sit and turned fully to Steve. “I'm really fucking sure,” he said, almost angry.
They went into a light and sleek establishment and Steve felt a bit out of place, but tried to ignore the feeling. He'd never get anywhere now if he started to avoid places where he wasn't completely comfortable.
Tony pounding into him could have been enough to set him off, but now that Tony had brought it up he found he couldn't wait another second.
Steve's hips jerked at that and he came, throwing his head back and slumping down on the bed when he relaxed. Johnny took his semen-wetted hand to his own cock, using Steve's come as lubrication and stroked himself to quick completion. He groaned and watched as his come hit Steve's ass. He smeared it well against Steve's buttocks before dropping on top of him.
“I can do it! Can anybody copy! I can shut the portal down!” Natasha called over the communicator and Steve’s heart leapt in his chest. This was it!
He knew it would take years for the technology to catch up so…now he had time again.
“And good to hear you, J,” Tony whispered. “Lower the volume. Peter’s sleeping.”
Steve rolled his eyes and looked away from Tony so he could focus on emptying his bladder. It was harder to do with an audience and, after a few seconds, he blushed and asked, “Can you please look away?”
Tony’s chest deflated and he closed the hologram he just opened. He should have expected this moment. Sighing heavily, he ran his hand through his hair and whispered, “…Yeah, you did…”
He also tossed Tony one of his favorite sweaters. It originally had been Steve's but Tony commandeered it for his own. Tony teased, “Don't want me walking around half naked?”
“I will heal,” Steve sighed.
“Natasha had my back. That’s what teammates do. We look out for one another!” Steve argued.
And then they were flung into the future.
The painful ringing in his ear was a constant reminder that it was in no way possible.
“When it gets too heavy for you, it’s Subject B’s turn,” Eddie said as he walked around the lab, grabbing various objects he could throw at Peter.
“Pepper’s gone missing,” she replied. “She was last seen with a woman claiming to work for the Mandarin. She told Pepper she wanted to stop him but it might have been a draw to lure her in. We think they are going to use Pepper to get to Tony.”
Steve had yet to meet the alien Avenger but he read his file and heard humorous stories from the others. Apparently, Thor was back in his home world at the moment.
out of your floor?”
“Jarvis,” Tony stated. “Please pull up everything you have on Peter Parker.”
Jarvis said nothing more so Fury must’ve been sent straight to voicemail. Tony already forgot about him as he wallowed in his memories.
However, one by one, the Commandos came up to him in the first week and asked him why he left. One by one, he lied to them all, saying he decided he wasn’t cut out for the Commando life after the firefight.
, but he was bearded with tired eyes that were characteristically not his father’s.
like him, Dad. I know there are other sides to him. I know he’s hurt others because sometimes I was on scene when it happened! He’s done bad, but he’s also done good! And…I hope, if I ask, that he’ll turn over a new leaf…He cares for me too, Dad. I think he’d do it.”
And a update for the chapter number! :D
. Do you understand me?”
Cable unplugged the time glove and pulled it onto his hand. He clenched his fist and said, “Let’s get into position and fix the future.”
Peter made it safely to the ground and he crawled over to his quilt then asked, “Can I open it now?”
“Wade…”
Steve sighed heavily and admitted, “I’m a little nervous…but, I’m ready.”
It distracted Tony enough from his fight and one of the metal tentacles was able to slip through his defenses and grab onto his throat with a crushing force.
So my superfamily is going to weather one more storm, hopefully everyone makes it out alive...
“Welcome to the 21
He was hopelessly devoted to his son.
Gibbons’ hands kneaded at the rifle in his hands and his eyes were open so wide, Steve could clearly see the white encircling both of his irises.
“There will be no need for any sacrifices,” Thor said as he stepped between them. “The cores of the plans are well constructed, but we need to move our troops around so that we all come out in one piece. The Red Skull had sent that missive to draw us out. He wants the Avengers. We are a threat to his power cache and he wants to remove us from the field. We need not send only one of us to the west. All of us will go as the distraction-,” He nodded to Tony and said, “
Steve bit down on his bottom lip as Tony’s tongue traced a path down the sensitive hollow to his neck then gasped, “Please tell me you did not throw out the lube.”
Pepper bit down on her bottom lip and looked torn. Finally, she said, “…You look tired, Steve. Maybe you should get some sleep. The next couple of days are going to be crazy.”
“Where is Steve?” Natasha asked.
want any more surprises or-or…” He paused to collect his breath and steady his voice. He continued more slowly, “I just want to know when things are real. Alright?”
“Full circle will be getting you two home,” Cable said. He held out his hand and grumbled, “Let’s go now before any of these guys think to keep us here any longer. I want to get this over with.”
The Parkers gave Peter was the most precious. It was a quilt, hand sewn by May of all of Mary’s old shirts. Peter regarded the blanket made of his mother’s shirts with an unreadable expression. When he learned that most children had a mother and a father, Peter had asked Steve where his was and Steve had to explain how she was gone. His son never asked about her again.
“I missed you, Petey,” Steve gasped. “I’m so sorry I left like that!”
“WHO DARES ATTACK US?!” Thor demanded, clutching his hammer in front of him, ready to attack wearing only a loincloth. Peter twitched awake at Thor’s exclamation and peered sleepily at the gathered company.
‘Where to?’ Steve replied.
, now he looked like a sad puppy.
“Come in,” Steve’s voice made Tony freeze. “Would you like anything to drink? I have water, Gatorade, iced tea…”
“No reporters in here,” Tony murmured. He tapped Steve’s ribbons and said, “But there are a bunch of veterans here so don’t be surprised if you’re swarmed soon and start asking about these. Do you wanna bet how long it’ll take for people to figure out you’re Cap?”
Tony smiled at his old friend and swore, “Your arm will never hurt you again.”
Steve had been waiting for this day for years, but he wasn't ready. His chest compressed tightly with dread and he reached out to comfort Tony, but he flinched back. Steve closed his open hand and his other hand tightened on the doorframe.
Steve dropped his head and looked down at the pieces on the board before them.
Bucky nodded toward Tony’s voice and urged, “Go to him. I’ll go down to the beach for a bit to give yous two your time.”
“Howard, don’t patronize the Commandos,” Peggy teased the inventor.
“GET OUT NOW!” Howard exclaimed, pushing one more out. He pointed at the Commandos and said, “Not you, you guys get in here right now and make sure no one comes in!”
Wade placed a hand over his heart and he gasped, “Baby boy, you scared me!”
Steve stared at him blankly. Everything he said was gibberish to Steve.
“I take this as you being selfish,” Bucky rasped against his flesh. He nibbled on his collarbone, peeking out from behind the neck of his shirt.
“Tony?” Rhodey questioned.
Tony elbowed Steve’s side and Peter giggled madly at it, making Steve and Tony chuckle as well.
He could not wipe the grin off his face and, for the first time since entering Steve’s apartment, Tony began to feel at ease. Steve had to go out of his way to print this and he purposely printed one of them clearly as a couple. Steve liked to see them together and he woke up to this image every morning.
Natasha did not reply but clenched her fists at her side. She spun on her heel, avoiding everyone’s gazes and strode straight out of the room.
“Dummyyyyy,” Peter groaned and he and Harry took up the chase again.
He went outside and saw the agent straighten with the appearance of his Captain America regalia. The uniform seemed to give him an air of importance, his shield especially. He noticed the change when he started to interact with certain people in and out of uniform. He smiled at the man and asked, “Where can I put this?”
“Peter, Mr. Stark wishes to go over plans for your birthday with you,” Friday informed him.
All of Steve’s excitement deflated and worry began to trickle in again.
Tony leaned into his side and murmured, “You look great.”
Peter shrugged and stared sourly down at the Iron Man action figure. He suddenly held it out to Steve and said, “Keep dis, Papa. He can protect you.”
The symbiote looked weaker. It had shrunk since Norman last saw it in the sewers and its inky skin had a slight grey hue. Its cheeks and ribs were hallowed in, as if it were starving. It glared at Norman with calculating and clever eyes.
He slowly put his utensil down and swallowed his food thickly. Without looking at her, he whispered, “I do not have a name.”
“…Oh,” Steve whispered, his flush growing.
“Well let’s hope it won’t have to come to that,” Steve murmured, sparing one more glance up to the sparse canopy and blue skies. His eyes returned to the horizon and his resolve back to the mission. Jarvis being overprotective of his master was not as bad as Tony made it out to be. It meant Steve did not have to worry as much about Tony’s safety.
Steve did not want to wait for the jet so he went up to Tony and asked him to fly him back.
Peter didn’t like it. It made him feel like a young teenager being driven to his first ever date.
“…How old is he?” Steve asked.
“I don’t know when we’re going to die but I want to spend the rest of my life with you, whether it be just one more day or a lifetime. I love you, Steve…So will you marry me?”
The Avenger’s made an effort to eat together for breakfast and dinner at least so that morning was just like any other breakfast. Steve had made a huge platter of pancakes, a good portion had already been removed for consumption. They had six different syrups sitting at various points on the table. Steve was particularly fond of the blueberry one and Peter loved the strawberry flavor.
It hurt more so knowing Tony was so close, but Steve had to stay so far away.
“We thought we’d surprise everyone at the fair,” Tony said.
He looked to Sam and then back to the phone.
“Babe, don’t bring up other people having sex while you’re in my bed,” Tony grumbled. “And, yes, when couples start having sex in the real world I hear the sex life continues in their dreams, but I hear most tire of the sex marathons after a while.”
Norman’s grin curled as he stared at the symbiote. It was hungry like when Norman last saw him but last time he could only say “Food.” The symbiote was now articulate and could form proper sentences. He also was clearly smart enough to know to come to Norman for help and knew it could get results by threatening his only child.
The rest of the Commandos had no idea what was going on. Tensions were high and the other men knew truths were being withheld from them. With Tony traveling with the group, it’ll be much harder to keep quiet about the truth of his condition.
Peter’s eyes raked over Wade’s exposed chest. Peter, himself was a guy so he was no stranger to male anatomy, but
Last, but not least, he tucked his shield under his undershirt. He cringed as the metal chilled his skin further. He would have to walk with a hunch until the Americans took him but, once with them, he could straighten and look like he had a potbelly.
And even if he did find a replacement core, it still didn’t fix the most basic and problematic failure with the reactor.
“So is it the past peril that bothers you or something else?” Thor questioned with slight grit from his earlier upset.
(See the end of the chapter for
Had it always been like that? Had the notebook always been filled with formulas to save Tony? Had his Aunt Peggy always torn out the last pages to give to Tony until he returned? Was his traveling into the past always fated?
He glanced around the table and saw everything was picked up. Tony asked, “Are you all going in?”
Last night, he removed the mask for Peter. He let him see the ugly.
“…Wade Wilson.”
“No, it’s a freaking flying robot from the future that wants to work with us!!”
He wrapped his arms around himself and whimpered as the pain mounted with every passing second.
“And you always rushed in,” Bucky stated with a grin. Steve had never seen Bucky smile so much, Steve was dazzled by it.
The round object that had slid out of the bag was mostly covered with a strange orange tarp but a part of the tarp parted in the fall and a piece was revealed, portraying the familiar red, white, and blue coloring he had been looking at for the last few weeks.
“We – uh – I – well…” Tony sputtered.
“Don’t compare me with him,” Tony muttered indignantly, glaring at Steve’s chest.
! Sometime this week both of you need to stop by to see it!”
Next time, Ch. 7: Hello, Awkward. My name is Denial.
“How many times must I remind you?” She whispered, “We’re soulmates. I love you. I always have and I always will.”
“What? It’s not like I’m going to post this online! This will be saved to my private collection...”
Steve turned beet red and looked around at the buildings looking down at them. He gasped, “Do you think we were seen??”
Turning to Steve, Tony purred, “Now what was Fury saying about fucking?”
“I know you are in there I can read your heat signature,” Iron Man’s grainy voice growled and Steve’s heart leapt in his throat. Steve pushed himself up and went to the door as Tony yelled, “Come out now and give up my husband’s body or so help me I will—I will…”
Rogers ripped his shield from his backpack and he snarled, “
Steve's eyes trailed over the destruction left of the Avengers Facility. The building was unrecognizable. Everything they had built there had been destroyed.
Peter groaned then went ridged. His blue eyes shot open and latched onto Tony. He gasped in a tiny voice, “
If he couldn't run, his only other option was to spend years locked away and forever considered a rapist by the rest of the world.
Steve kissed Peter’s forehead again as he felt the tendrils crawl across his face.
Steve instantly turned around and threw his arms around Tony. He buried his face into his boyfriend’s shoulder, trying to get a hold of the bile rising in his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
If it wasn’t for the coaching from his dad, Peter would have flushed at the insinuation, but he merely raised an eyebrow and retorted, “And what rumors would those be?”
“Howard’s son,” Steve breathlessly repeated. Tony was older than Howard by a decade at least and…
And how would he get Steve the phone? Did he have a telephone booth on wheels??
Steve reached out and touched his arm, gasping, “I thought you were dead.”
Wade’s worry about the media’s reaction to their relationship stayed with him ever since Wade brought it up. Peter had never considered it until Wade voiced it into existence.
Steve expected a lecture or for Bucky to freak out like he had when he found Tony in his bed but, not this…teasing? He eyed his best friend peculiarly and asked, “Y-You’re not worried?”
“And what do you think you are doing, Captain?”
Peter was totally frozen in his arms and the gears in his mind had halted to a stop.
“He cannot be happy without being alive,” Mary stated. “This is Peter’s only chance.”
“No,” Steve whispered, eyeing the bottle with confusion. He did not know whether to feel excited or scared.
He fluttered kisses all over Tony’s face, kissing the sides of his mouth, his nose, his cheeks, his eyelids, every square inch of his face. Worshiping him. Loving him. Meanwhile, Tony continued to whisper, “I love you, Steve. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I love you so much. I want to be with you. I don’t want to be casual anymore.
Fury put his hands on his hips and sighed, “Good, let’s hope it stays there for the foreseeable future. You two need a freaking break.”
Steve instantly was on edge by Tony’s manner. Whatever was in that box was bad news and it contained information Tony did not want Steve to know, information that might affect their relationship as Natasha eluded.
Coulson look up from his shield with a sad expression and stated, “I would never ask you to fight your own son. And I would never have asked for your shield because of it. Keep your shield, Captain. You will need it again in the future.”
“He’s Parker actually,” Steve stated. “Peter Parker. I thought he should take his mother’s name, to keep him safe from the infamy of my name and in memorial of her sacrifice…”
The Merc with a Mouth was his boyfriend.
He’d grown so used to Steve’s constant presence that its sudden absence hurt as much as a lost limb. It had been love. He could say that now. He had loved Steve and he struggled with understanding it so he never told Steve he loved him and he was going to regret it for the rest of his life.
“Eliminate the problem,” Clint murmured darkly and it all clicked to Steve. Dear God. Would Hydra really kill all those people based off the results of a computer program?
The machine was turned on and, when he screamed, it was a mixture of pain, from his mind being torn apart, and horror, as he imagined what the Red Skull had planned for him and Tony.
“My dad…Tony…well, he doesn’t approve of Wade,” Peter murmured to the toast. He shoved the toast into his mouth so he could let his mind calm down a little before continuing.
“Wade…” Peter whispered, “I need you to go.”
Tony sighed and ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve closed his eyes at the feeling. He loved it when Tony ran his fingers through his hair.
His hand shot away from the comforter and he internally flinched away from the train of thought. If he never let Bucky do those things to him in the first place this would have never happened! Tony would still be alive!
Steve’s chest muscles loosened. Tony wasn’t trying to initiate sex and…
Natasha sighed and leaned into his side. She whispered, “Promise not to tell SHIELD I talked to you about my mate?”
“Okay,” Tony said, nodding encouragingly.
Tony shook his head. He felt utterly destroyed by this. How could Pepper ask him to worsen it?
Natasha wordlessly launched herself forward again, this time going in for a straightforward assault. Peter used his Spidey-Sense this time and stepped aside to dodge her. His sense flared when, a baton came out of nowhere when she was closest to him. She must have had a few strapped to her back to take him by surprise.
But mostly he'd yearn for his oddly put together family. He already missed Rhodey's friendly barbs and Pepper’s soothing voice… What were they going though? How were they handling his disappearance? Would it be like when he was taken by the Ten Rings? Or would they hold out hope that Tony would make it back like last time? How long would they wait for him?
Steve had never considered looking Tony up online until that moment and it sickened him. When he had first met him, he did not know how to use the internet and he trusted the file SHIELD gave him told him all he needed about his mate…but was there more? Did Tony truly sleep around?...And was he really flirting with others to…to find someone to sleep with?...like a woman?
Tony didn’t get a chance to say anything. His hand tightened on his reactor and the glow grew brighter and then…he was gone.
“I think I am ready to christen our new home,” he murmured into her flesh.
Steve’s fingers twitched against him when he mentioned the surgery but he did not pause in the wrapping. He asked, “Are you a soldier?”
She was his target.
with a man…or a woman for that matter. The man never discussed relationships with him so, for all Tony knew, Steve was still a virgin. Even if this was just a fling to Steve, Tony wanted to treasure him and not take away something that was probably precious to him.
Steve continued to avoid looking at him but Tony refused to look away. Tony silently vowed to never ignore what was happening between them.
Not to mention his ass ached something fierce and it was a bitch to sit on...
Howard rolled with it, pretending he was unaffected, and asked Tony about his speech. Their conversation was stilted and Howard was relieved when Peggy stole Tony to tease him on his growing goatee.
Steve groaned, thrusting his hips into Tony again, and digging his free hand into Tony’s hips, trying to draw him closer. His mind became hazy with desire. He wanted Tony. He wanted his body. But most importantly, he wanted his tongue.
Peter didn't give him a chance to choose as he launched himself at Wade and kissed him deeply.
The only reason he was able to do this
Steve shrugged and fibbed, “Adrenaline and embarrassment?”
“Tyler recanted the date. She says the trauma altered her memory and she cannot pinpoint it. Now put down the shield or I will use force.”
Peter fell into his side as the bed shifted under Tony’s weight. Peter was still clutching his phone and Tony saw all of the unopened notifications. Tony asked, “Have you gone online yet?”
Tony curled into Steve’s side and wept until he was too exhausted to do anything but sleep.
Steve’s breath broke free from the blockage in his throat and his moan ripped through his throat. It was so loud and heated he feared the entire Tower heard.
“…I don’t know,” Peter replied truthfully. He looked down at his drink and stated, “Truthfully, my girlfriend died a few years ago and I just never…never looked after that…”
Mary watched Dr. Banner leave the hospital room with hunched shoulders and a resigned expression. She was hidden from his view, being several feet away but had still been able to adjust her frequencies and listen in on the conversation between Dr. Banner and Peter.
“We are,” Steve agreed, kissing the side of Tony’s head.
“Yes,” Steve replied.
Steve’s eyes were still glassy and sad but his mouth quirked into a tiny smile. He whispered, “Thanks, Tony.”
It may very well be the last time he did so…
Downstairs, he heard his Aunt May open the door and a person say, “Hello, May Parker? Is it true your nephew, Peter Parker, is the illegitimate son of Tony Stark?”
Tony weakly grasped Steve’s hand and, in a hushed voice, said, “I…I can’t feel anything.”
His super soldier smirked at him and murmured dryly, “You have a stash of lube on this ship, don’t you?”
The machine dinged lightly and green light appeared on the box.
Eddie stopped and Peter could just barely see the slight smirk hidden by his shoulder. Eddie whispered, “Thanks Parker…Smell ya later?”
Tony shook his head and murmured, “Brooklyn has changed a lot since you last saw it and if Fury knew you left Malibu, he’d direct his resources to finding you. I’m sorry, Bucky, it has to be me, but I’ll find him and bring him home.”
?” Tony teased.
Steve went from a stuck-up prick to a plain, a stuck-up guy in his mind in five seconds flat. Tony knew he wanted to see him smile more often.
“Nothing,” Wade squeaked, pulling down on his mask to try to hide himself further. “I said nothing! Just thinking aloud!”
was quick to act and the soldiers grabbed their nearby weapons and took cover as the forest emptied of bodies. They were Hydra but were in mostly camouflage rather than their usual uniform. It looked like they were mostly fighting with regular guns and only a few scattered soldiers had the ray guns.
It’d take him twenty minutes to get down there, at most, so it left him with a lot of time to chill.
“Yes! Of course!” Ben gasped and Steve slumped into Tony’s side as his relief made him boneless.
Tony stared long and hard at the information streaming in on the hologram in front of him and every new piece of information made him feel more numb and detached from his body.
The bright light associated with Cable’s time travel device burned brightly where his parents had fallen. From the sparks, two figures emerged: Cable and…Pops?
Steve saw through the swagger. Tony wasn’t lying. He no longer was a playboy. He was putting his heart on the line and entrusting it to Steve. Steve felt utterly grateful.
Steve covered the distance between them and slowly lay himself over Tony. The older man wrapped his hands around Steve’s biceps and groaned as his settled his weight on him.
The bullets bounced off his Vibranium shield, saving their lives. Steve exhaled heavily. He had stopped the bullets just in time. The shield flew far but was beginning to come arching back to him and Ross growled, “You got in the way for the last time.”
Steve scooted back onto the bed and opened his legs wider as he asked, “Why don’t you find out?”
Bucky nodded and Tony murmured, “I need to take the arm off to finish it.” Bucky nodded again and held his arm out to Tony to remove.
“And there it goes,” Logan sighed. “But seriously, you know who you’re talking about right? Peter is one of the toughest guys I know. He may look like a normal college kid but he’s fought beside the Avengers, fought alone, and…he’s one of the few of us who has lost so many loved ones and
What would it be like to sleep with him? He bet he was a cuddler. If Tony slept over, he wondered if he'd wake with Steve's arms around him.
“There is an intruder headed your way, Sir,” Jarvis warned. “He bypassed the fence and got to the roof in a matter of seconds. I have contacted the authorities but he will reach you in a few more moments.”
Tony offered to show them to their rooms and Steve, Bruce, and Clint followed him. Peter shot questions at Tony, all of which Tony answered enthusiastically.
Tony couldn’t help but smile as Steve held him close and then dipped him. Steve cupped his jaw and then bent down to kiss him like a dame from on old movie. You could take the man out of the 1940s but you couldn't fully take the 1940s out of the man.
Yeah, he wasn't going to listen in. He leaned away from Steve and looked at anything else except for his boyfriend and the phone he held.
“Jarvis will come. He’s always there when I need him,” Tony replied, his eyes began to fall and he repeated drowsily, “Always…”
So why were they all cropping up in his mind?
But it was nice, knowing what was happening. He felt more connected to Tony with it.
“Fiancé, as in I’m going to marry this handsome piece of Cap in New York as soon as the law is passed,” Tony reiterated to Fury with a big grin on his face. The smile wasn’t even the patronizing one he usually gave Fury. It was 100% genuine joy. His arm was wrapped around Steve’s side as he was there and ALIVE and they were going to get freaking married!! His heart was so full with love that he couldn’t stop smiling. His facial muscles seemed stuck in the position.
Tony turned to Steve and asked, “So how long have you been a
“Sir, the suit has been compromised in areas four, eight, and nine,” Jarvis quickly informed him. “You were hit in the Vastus Lateralis muscle of your upper thigh. And, by the trajectory of the other bullets, I assume your liver has been pierced as well as your right lung. You will be experiencing chest pain and breathing problems. You need to put something over the both wounds in your torso, especially your chest wound or air will get into your chest cavity and your lungs will no longer be able to expand.”
Her eyes widened and she gasped, “Project Rebirth?”
“Tony, I’m Captain America! I am not going to sit aside and twiddle my fingers!”
A dark figure was hunched over his laundry basket. It must have knocked it over when it slipped in from the window and it was putting the clothes back in it.
“You need water more than coffee,” Steve commented and wondered when Tony had last had the said liquid.
Steve’s heart throbbed with an unbearable sting and he whispered, “Not all endings are perfect…”
Peter ran his tongue across the back of his teeth then asked, “Do you think I will be able to see her soon?”
Natasha drew out her own blades and took a defensive stance.
Steve grinned as he imagined the scene and said, “Great. So that’s our beginning. I always knew you were bi and when you were single I finally mucked up the courage to ask you out.”
Smiling wily, Tony slowly caressed the exposed skin, starting at his shoulder and tracing down to the top of his thigh. Steve was shaking by the time he was done.
“You knew her?” Steve asked, tightening his hold on Peter.
“What the hell, Bucky?!” Steve hissed. He could not believe Bucky just did that! He knew Steve loved Tony and that he wanted to be in a committed relationship with him! Anger over Bucky’s indiscretion burned through his veins and he was tempted to punch him.
If only every night were so easy…
None of them could be good. They knew he purposely infected Peter with Venom, they had the video evidence from the birthday party. It was one of the things they overviewed with him. SHIELD may not be owned by Stark but he had a lot of sway in the organization and he was probably none too happy what Eddie had done to his son.
DNA.”
“You missed his speech,” Maria whispered.
The serum had gifted Steve with fantastic abilities. He was stronger, faster, and healthier.  However, it didn’t just affect his physical abilities but his mental abilities as well. He found he was able compute things faster and remember nearly everything after the serum with amazing clarity.
“Just pretend it’s one of those USO shows,” Natasha said.
Peter cupped Wade’s sharp jaw and carefully extracted his mouth from Wade’s, nipping at his lips as he pulled away.
Steve opened the two doors. There were four different uniforms hanging there and two shields to choose from. One was Steve’s circular shield and the other was a smaller and looked like it could only protect his forearm. Various boots were lined on the floor with surgical precision and, on one of the doors, a photo of Tony and Steve holding a toddler between them and all three were wearing exuberant smiles.
Steve surged forward, pushed the mad woman away, took the few steps needed to reach Tony’s side, and collapsed to his knees beside his prone body. Hot blood soaked into his trousers in seconds and the breath constricted in his chest upon the feeling.
It fit. The curvature of the metal body and the paint job were spot on.
“I…I needed to do it, Steve,” he whispered. Water dripped into his mouth and he licked his lips. “It was just once…” He gulped and said, “Well it
Steve peered sadly down at his lanky form but did not reply to his comment.
He missed her passion for life. Her eyes were sparkling with excitement and she was smiling at him for the first time in years. Granted, her smile was bloody, but it was directed at him and her lips were puffy from his punch and he could almost pretend it was not from the hit but from being kissed.
“What you’re seeing is the base metal, so if you want a different color or a symbol on your shoulder then you let me know, okay? I can make those kind of changes in a matter of minutes so you won’t be armless as long.”
-tastic.”
When he thought Bucky dead, the world became dark and devoid of a happy future. When he woke in the twenty-first century, Tony had taken that mantle and Steve had light in his life again.
