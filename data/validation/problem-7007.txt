.” Steve chuckled when he said the word, like it was an inside joke, and looked up to see if Tony had understood.
Tony nudged Steve out of the way and picked up the card. Sure enough, it was the same material and ink Steve’s name had been written in. He read it out loud:
One moment his feet pounded against the rugged path, beating the earth into submission; and the next—he wasn’t touching anything.
“Of course. Every night will be like a party—what’s not to love?” Tony clapped his hands together. He tried not to sound too miserable, but the hollow sound of his voice tore through the room. “Give me three weeks. Three weeks and I’ll have everything ready.”
Thank you to everyone leaving comments and kudos—Its so wonderful knowing that people are enjoying the work!
“You don’t know anything about me.” The words sounded strangled, much to his confusion. The arc reactor pressed heavy against his chest. It always seemed bigger when things were getting shitty.
Steve groaned in response, flopped to his back, and squinted up at the trees. The hands that had just left Tony’s back tingling were now digging into the dirt around him. “Where are we?”
That may have been the source of the issue, but it wasn’t what Tony was angry about. “He wants you all to live with me. In my tower.”
“In the shop.” Rhodey finished for him, disapproval in his tone. Was there ever a time it wasn’t there?
Tony opened his eyes slowly and was shocked all over again by Steve’s presence. This had been the longest they’d ever been in a room together—each one usually finding ways to avoid each other or storming off in frustration after seconds of interaction.
“Could you at least be proud that I’ve timed my sleep deprivation perfectly?” Tony asked through the phone. He put up with the parenting since Rhodey had to endure far more, but that didn’t mean he didn’t give him shit for it.
Tony had grown comfortable with the arc reactor in his chest and the scars that littered his body, but Steve would want to ask questions.
He couldn’t be in Afghanistan. He couldn’t. There wasn’t a car battery attached to him; the sand under his knees and the breeze in the wind were not found in the cave. It was just a flashback
Like gasoline to a fire, it told him there was something happening. It was the smell of ingenuity, intensity and creation. It made Tony want to do more.
“Nowhere,” Steve answered. Because that made sense. “It just showed up. It wasn’t here and then when I turned around, it was.”
Tony shook his head furiously. Or maybe it was his whole body that was shaking. “You don’t get it. You don’t get it.”
Steve ran his hands lightly over the material of the suit. Tony wondered if it was a trick of the light or if the water he’d fallen into had permanently damaged his vision. But deep down Tony knew there was only one explanation.
Tony pushed him off yet again, “I’m okay—really!” He tried to sound annoyed, but his shivering made him sound much more fragile than anything. He tried giving Steve a lopsided smile, the one he used for getting away with things, “Would you believe me if I said I wanted to go for a swim?”
I think it is a very individual decision—and I'm definitely not suggesting that these crooks are undeserving of punishment—but I think it's important to really think about right now. Specifically the relationship between the art and the artist: should we stop watching movies if the lead actor is now a convicted sex offender?
Any comfort Tony had been feeling was strangled out of him. The silence was suffocating, replacing the coffee taste in his mouth with vile bitterness.
For a moment no one said anything. Fury didn’t have to convince Coulson and Hill of that truth. Coulson had seen it with his own eyes, and Hill was bright enough to understand everything the two of them had told her.
Either way, both of them should have been in bed, but both of them were gulping down steaming cups of coffee.
Amid the towering trees and the untamed greens of the forest floor, Tony had flashed open his eyes just long enough to glimpse a golden head of hair, milky skin and a twitching frown.
“I wouldn’t do that.” Tony assured him, the corner of his mouth quirking up as he shot Steve a devilish look. “There are much more efficient ways of getting away with murder than this.”
Tony trailed off at Steve’s glare, pulling at the stiff, soaked fabric around his legs. His jeans clung to him like soggy cardboard, threatening to chafe in all the wrong places as they started walking. He stifled his shivering, running through equations in his mind to block out the cold as they continued their seemingly endless walking.
Tony followed his vision. A thick expanse of trees stretched to all sides, surrounding them in a blanket of deep green that faded to a harrowing sea of shadows. The sky told him that they’d been unconscious for far too long. They must have wandered deeper into the forest than he’d initially thought.
It was something Steve failed to realize, apparently: even when he was silent, Steve seemed to be telling Tony he was better than him. No one deserved to be this righteous; war-hero or not.
Steve’s jaw ticked as he weighed his options, and Tony tried his best not to storm off alone. Bust something told him that Steve would cave.
Tony’s grin slackened the moment he saw Steve’s back. He ripped off his soggy t-shirt and hurriedly pulled the maroon one over his head. The soft material clung to his body like an embrace. Despite his talk, Tony was relieved Steve wasn’t seeing his naked chest.
“Welcome!” A man greeted them with open arms. His luminous white coat gleamed even brighter against his dark, midnight skin, seeming to match the stars up above. “Do you have an invitation?”
A silence swept the room as they both looked to Fury. But he was miles away—planets, actually. A plan had begun to formulate in his mind. It was one that was extremely reckless and more than a little dangerous, but most of his plans were. “Then we’ll just have to get Stark and Rogers to play nice.”
The suits were his best chance at redemption, Pepper not being able to see that didn’t make it not true.
Steve shook his head, “We checked every inch of this store—there is no way we missed someone. And I would have heard the door open.”
A jagged veil of unspoken threats filled the room. Fury wanted to play games with him, but Tony knew all about manipulation and business. He could play games too.
Hill met his gaze straight on as she always did, undaunted. “I’m not sure if it’s the best idea to have a leader who might not know where he’s supposed to lead. Or who believes so whole-heartedly in something that he can’t see the complexities of the other side.
Tony made his way back to the fire and his suit, already sliding the belt from his pants. Again, his attempt for warmth was foiled by Steve, who called his name from the front of store.
“Anytime, babe, anytime. I’m just glad you and Steve can stop being idiots now, honestly. I feel like a proud mom.”
Why couldn’t he have just kept listening to that couple argue about whether or not 30 minutes was too long of a commute? He turned back to face the TV screen, because he didn’t know what else to do.
Steve looked up and gave her a small, weak smile, before promptly turning on the television to whatever was on—anything to keep from having a conversation. At that moment, it was an episode of
knew him. Over the years, they had developed a sibling-like relationship, and so even if they fought over silly things sometimes, Nat was the first person to be there if she thought, even for a second, that something was wrong.
Tony carried the tray over, Steve at his side, with cookie crumbs falling from his mouth down onto his clothes.
“Please?” She added, deciding that Tony would probably need that extra push. “Just tell me why you’ve been acting like the world’s ending all the time,” she let a moment pass, and then, “and turning into Hulk at every minor inconvenience.”
at his friend while speaking. He looked ahead at his feet, wiggled them around some, and then brought one of his arms up over his head, so that the crease of his elbow laid against his forehead. He closed his eyes.
was playing softly on the TV at a low volume. Meanwhile, Steve and Tony were in the kitchen baking—or
“At this point, Nat, there was literally no going back. So I just tell him, I tell him no, that’s not why. That’s not why I paused the show. This is what I said to him, are you ready?”
“Merry Christmas, Tony.” Steve leaned over and placed a chaste kiss to his shoulder, and then let his head fall back onto the pillow. “Get some sleep.”
“At first,” Steve said, “I didn’t think I could explain everything and look at you at the same time. That seems kinda stupid now though. Like, me telling this whole story to your back.”
And then, no doubt through the realization that he was looking into the eyes of a very determined woman, Tony went from indignant to compliant pretty quickly. Giving in, he grumbled out a “What do you want?” and looked right back down at his project.
They both laid back on the bed, laughing and squealing like little kids. The sun was starting to come through Nat’s blinds.
“I didn’t know he had fallen for me, Nat. Hello! This is new information!” Tony’s voice had gone way up in pitch. “Since when has Steve, since when has he—felt this way? And how do
Tony stood awkwardly in the middle of the room, until Nat motioned for him to come and sit next to her on the edge of the bed. He joined her, but he still didn’t say anything. Nat had no qualms about it. She looked down at his hand that was fiddling with his pajama bottoms and covered it with her own, reminding him she was here. They idled in comfortable silence for the next few minutes.
“I just wanted to be able to explain it to you, so you wouldn’t think I was crazy! Or, if you did, I could at least be here to defend myself. Also, I wish I could say that was all a distraction. I’m actually just that messy.”
Nat wanted to be mad at him, she really wanted to be mad at him. The fact that Captain America was in love with him and that was a
“Hey, I know it must feel like you’ve lost one of your best friends. I really am sorry.” She looked at Tony, the sympathy written plainly on her face. He sighed.
“Shh, everything’s alright. Happy tears, babe.” Tony squeezed back. “I just, um, I was thinking about you. Us. That’s all.” He smiled to himself, in the dark.
“First of all,” Tony interjected in the same voice he had used to yell at her for turning off his music, “I have been doing no such thing! You are
“The worst part is that you’re actually, pretty close? But no, okay, not exactly. So basically, in the beginning of the movie, when they’re kids, the guy makes the girl a dollhouse for her birthday, but it’s not just
the overacting shield he had been using to protect himself had all but worn off. Nat could see it on his face. He looked like he was reliving it; he looked
“Oh, you don’t? Oh, I see. So you don’t know what’s gonna happen in,” she turned her head to glance at the clock, “thirty minutes?”
“Jenny’s. It’s the only place that’s open by 6, plus they have those weird, healthy breakfast sandwiches he’s so obsessed with, with like, the wheat bread that has
She blinked her eyes way too many times and made a little pout with her lips. It reminded Steve of someone else he knew.
Okay, so Nat might have been pretending to be a little more out of the loop than she actually was. Given the way Tony reacted at the mere utterance of Steve’s name during their last conversation, she had
Tony watched him nervously for a while longer, bottom lip between his teeth, contemplating whether or not he should wait for Steve to say something first. He decided against that idea.
Nat flipped her hair dramatically, and Tony just shook his head at her, a smile starting to break across his features.
Nat had been passed out—like a normal person!—but quickly got herself out of bed when she heard the noise and then shuffled to the door to see what was going on. She’s always been a light sleeper.
Tony tried again, “So, I was asking why you picked right now, three days before Christmas, at an absurdly late hour of the night, to torture me with what ifs about my love life, which, by the way, is already smack dab in the middle of falling apart and is, in fact, the entire reason I’m sitting here next to you right now?”
different grains? Or something ridiculous like that. What kind of super soldier concerns himself with-“
“They aren’t real,” Bruce told him, “but no, they aren’t made out to be, either way. They’re, well, they’re sort of an Earth myth. Mostly they’re seen as magical, like they live in the clouds and glide on rainbows and stuff.”
reruns or something, anyway, I was sitting here, and he was looking at the tv, and laughing—well, of course he was laughing,
“Oh.” Nat winced. She loved Steve so much, and she just wanted him to be happy. And she felt the same way about Tony, even if he had been driving her insane. All those things considered, this was an awful lot to process.
Steve could hear, of course, but he wasn’t freaking out, not in the way he thought he would’ve, or maybe should’ve, been. Once the initial shock of Tony actually speaking to him again wore off, Steve realized he was just happy to hear his friend’s voice, context—and potential disaster incoming—be damned.
Life was almost too good, and Steve knew it. So, he wasn’t totally surprised when things took ... well. A turn.
Tony lifted Steve’s chin up with one finger, making pointed eye contact. He let his touch trail up and down Steve’s jawline, softly, and when Steve’s breath hitched, it gave Tony goosebumps.
Even with the Tower, and the friends that he loved deeply, he was lucky to gain a real sense of belonging that he couldn’t have imagined he would ever have—but it wasn’t complete. He longed for a different kind of love. Not as a replacement that would overshadow what he already had, but an addition that would make
A deeply awkward silence fell over the room. Steve could feel his cheeks burning, and he just wanted to disappear. He thought for a moment he might shatter the remote he was gripping in his hand with a single squeeze. But he didn’t.
He could feel the way Steve’s heartbeat picked up, and as far as Tony was concerned, that was his new crowning achievement. Steve Rogers, blushing all the way down to his chest, grinning from ear to ear, unable to stop his heart from giving him away. It was, quite possibly, the greatest thing Tony had ever seen. And he’d seen Nat take out six bad guys in the same span of time it takes Mr. Rogers here to flip a single pancake. So. There’s that.
“Yeah, I don’t know how many playboys spend their free time painstakingly crafting elaborate dollhouses covered in pink glitter, I have to say.”
Nat was practically buzzing, energy radiating off of her like heat from the sun. She was biting down on her knuckle, looking at Steve with worried anticipation in her eyes.
Nat insisted, “The only reason I know that, is because you know that. And I bet you know other stuff, too. You know where he’s gonna stop, what route he takes, what he’ll order from whatever place he stops, if he-“
Nat started to walk out of the kitchen and towards where Steve was sitting. She stopped when she was facing the back of the couch and leaned forward onto it, draping her arms over the space he wasn’t taking up.
Everyone was awake in the living room, and Clint and Bruce were passing out the presents from under the tree.
Thor, though, seemed a tad preoccupied “sparring” with Bruce by the time he got there, so Tony left the two of them and headed back to his room. Today was Christmas Eve, and he still had presents to finish wrapping.
“Tony,” and now it was Nat’s turn to cover her face with her hand in frustration, “Did you hit your head on the way in here? Did you run into a wall?”
Steve was grateful Tony couldn’t see the rose flush that had undoubtedly risen to the surface of his cheeks as he heard those words.
“Thank you,” Tony said. “Really. I have no idea how you can even put up with me, but you do, and it means everything.” He couldn’t stop smiling as he spoke.
“Steve told me. The other day—well, I kind of coaxed it out of him. My magic works better on him than you, apparently.”
“It seems that I’ve been given a stuffed animal, some sort of ... Midgardian creature that I do not recognize. Still, it is very cute! Although, I am concerned as to why something so fluffy would need such a sharp weapon on its head?”
At first, Tony just gestured between the two of them, seemingly defining “this.” But then, he smiled shyly, stood up on his tiptoes, and kissed Steve on the lips.
“Honestly? Me either. Sure, I love a good, cheesy flick, but I’m not exactly a hopeless romantic—never have been. ‘Playboy,’ remember? One of my titles,” he reminded her, flippantly. “Not anymore.”
“It’s okay, hey, it’s okay. Everything’s gonna be fine, yeah?” She reached down to interlace their fingers together, trying her best to comfort him, and then placed a soft kiss to the back of his hand.
“Who am I, Cupid? Why is it that the people with the biggest brains don’t know how to use them for practical purposes? Like, hello, skip the fairy tale part and just tell him whatever sappy reason you got him that thing, would you?”
Before they could get themselves into another situation which was definitely not appropriate for the kitchen, Nat called out for them to “share some with the rest of us!”
Steve looked into Nat’s eyes, and delivered the speech dramatically. He figured if he was acting it out—badly, purposefully badly, and to another person whom it was not meant for—it would feel less real. That if he made it more ridiculous, he wouldn’t have to think about how ridiculous it already was, on its own.
Steve didn’t even hear what Tony said, because he was too busy doing that thing he mentioned earlier. What was it again? Oh, right,
“You’re crazy, Rogers. Don’t you know that the whole inferiority complex idea is supposed to be my thing?”
to talk to Nat about everything. He felt relieved, even if the rapid progression of his heartbeat said otherwise. It was just nerves; he hadn’t told anyone about this yet and he didn’t exactly know how. Nonetheless, he was dying to get it off his chest.
This wasn’t something that happened regularly, or ever, if Nat’s memory served her right. Sure, she and Tony were close, but he also had a lot of pride; he never wanted to feel weak or dependent. Thus, he wouldn’t usually resort to finding solace in his friend’s rooms in the middle of the night, even if the inconvenience of his frequent nightmares might beg him to do exactly that, all the time.
“Ew, I’m sickening myself saying this, but you were right. It’s romantic as hell.” Tony looked unapologetically pleased.
She didn’t know what was going on, but she knew she didn’t want to make things any worse. She followed the path Tony had taken, and plopped down next to him, laying her head on his shoulder.
Steve merely raised an eyebrow, appearing completely unaffected by this declaration, probably because it wasn’t exactly news.
Tony took a breath, and then pulled the cover off to reveal what looked to Nat like a ... dollhouse?
“Are you joking?” she asked, kindly. She was on the brink of insanity, sure, but if Tony wasn’t joking, she felt like she’d better start sprinkling some patience and comfort back into her words.
She hoped teasing him would bring him out of the memory, would ground him and help him to not look so hurt, the way he did now.
He looked into the distance dramatically, joking, and trying not to laugh at the idea that he could possibly be disappointed at those days being over.
As much as Steve wanted that night to be an outlier, it became a routine—not necessarily as specific as watching rom-coms on the couch, but the part about the unexpected, quickening of his heartbeat whenever Tony got too close? That would turn out to be pretty commonplace.
Her teasing didn’t shatter Tony’s confidence a bit. “Fine, don’t believe me,” he challenged, shrugging.
“Steve’s soft like that.” A small smile appeared on Tony’s lips as he said it. His eyes were glassy. “I mean, not like he’s weak, or something—obviously you know that’s not true. Just, he’s such a sap, when you melt that capsicle exterior. He used to have me fooled.”
In a voice so quiet Nat could barely make it out, Tony said, “I know it’s stupid, but I really wish he would’ve just asked me to watch the fucking movie.”
without major spoilers, let’s just say the house is a big part of the movie. Hence,” he pointed at the dollhouse on the ground, and waited impatiently for Nat’s thoughts.
“Steve.” This time, Tony’s voice broke Steve out of his momentary fit of terror, instead of throwing him into one. How thoughtful.
Still, she knew Steve was already feeling embarrassed and worried about the whole situation, and she wanted to let him tell her at his own pace. She would never force it out of him, either. Nat wasn’t in the business of hurting her friends for the sake of allaying curiosity. She just wanted them to be okay.
Steve breathed out a sigh, put his plate down on the counter, and took the couple steps over to where Tony was pouting. He put his arms around the other man’s waist, and Tony—very hesitantly—let his head rest against Steve’s chest. Steve cradled him, curling his fingers into the tangled hair at the back of his neck, pressing gentle kisses to the top of his head.
“Hey,” Tony said, softly, when she opened the door. He looked worse than he had the day Nat was interrogating him in his lab.
Steve felt so small in that moment, and he might’ve just gotten up and left rather than explain himself any further—if it weren’t for the fact that he knew who he was dealing with. Nat could get information out of some of the toughest, most dangerous people out there. She would certainly get this out of him, eventually, and he saw no point in prolonging the inevitable.
Steve smiled, but it was a small smile, the kind that doesn’t really reach your eyes, and his eyes flickered away from her and down to his own lap. Nat almost gave him a pitying look, and then she thought better of it. She went looking for some answers instead.
And yet, there would be the slightest pause before Steve answered, because his brain needed time to overcome the way his body reacted to Tony’s being so close. He usually did manage to say “yes,” or some variation of it, before Tony pulled out his pouty face. Sometimes, though, his brain would be perfectly fine, and he would wait anyway, just to see that face.
He shook his head at Tony’s naivety, no bitterness in the motion or in the quiet laugh that followed, only genuine bewilderment. “And I thought it would never amount to anything more than that, really. Just me being happy if you fell asleep next to me on the couch, or asked me to go somewhere with you, anything. And now? To have this?” Steve turned around, emphasizing that by this he didn’t only mean Tony, but everyone—
be this excited about, at its core, gossip, made Steve as relaxed as he possibly could be. So, that was a plus.
And if Steve’s heartbeat picked up faster than Clint runs from Nat during a you-ate-the-rest-of-the-cherry-poptarts rampage, then, well. Like Steve had been saying: imperceptible.
Then, she felt Steve sit up. She didn’t know if she should turn around, if he wanted to look at her now.
“Hush, they’re gonna be great.” Tony was beaming as he took the tray off the counter where Steve was eyeing it apprehensively, and popped it in the oven.
Tony dragged his palm down his face and started to rub at one of his temples, clearly frustrated, and probably tired—the clock on Nat’s nightstand was now blinking 3:45 am in neon green.
know Steve confessed to you the other day, because he confessed that confession, to me.” She was speaking slowly, laying out the facts like a mathematical word problem.
“He looks at me, confused, obviously. And I have to start talking, because if I don’t, then that would just be, well. It would have been so weird. So I do! I start talking, and god, Nat, I wish I wouldn’t’ve started talking.”
"I really have missed you Tony. It wasn't all bad was it?" The tom tried again, injecting an old sort of familiarity in his voice that harkened back to their days sitting in dressing rooms, laughing and poking fun at how stupid it all was.
Thank god they’d gone with the first name. It had been bad enough growing up there as it was, Tony couldn’t imagine how much worse it would have been if the family name was on the goddamn map. Starksville USA. No thank you.
“I was… thinking of maybe someplace sentimental? There are a couple of spots in my old neighborhood that are kind of special… to me anyway. I don’t know if he’d appreciate it the same way. Maybe it’s a bad idea.”
“If you’d feel more comfortable in your uniform you could probably get away with suiting up for the big fancy photo op at the airport, but dinner is a definite black tie affair.”
Wordlessly she reaches for him and he scoops the girl up into his arms and rises with her, looking between them and Steve.
Zero was an unwilling participant in a reconditioning program to make soldiers for the empire, the coming one that has slept unnoticed inside civilization for centuries. The new order. Zero’s belief in their mission was not necessary, the way a maggot’s understanding of cleanliness is not necessary before the cleansing.
A voice intrudes. Fills up his head, real as if Pietro had leaned over and shouted in his ear, only that’s not Pietro’s voice drowning out the storm in his head. His head’s a mess and his guard his down, allowing Tony to sneak back in –
“You described the shield that way too.” Natasha pointed out. “You said it was essentially a ring of short plasma swords that spun to create an impenetrable surface. A light shield. You also promised to make me a knife.”
(She) thinks but (he) can’t help the way (he) feels at the sight of the soldier, the familiar feel of his arms, and the shock of his scent. It’s so foreign from what (he) remembers.
"What's your instinct?" Steve asked so simply. She blinked slowly, surprised at the level of trust he seemed to be granting her.
“That’s my whole point. Dad said he and Aunt Natasha had been working in Washington for six months before the mess with Project Oversight. That’s supposed to happen in June. It’s already February and they’re not in Washington.”
Tony’s watch beeped threateningly, a warning from JARVIS scrolling through the screen that Pepper and Happy were waiting in the car. He somehow managed to get to his feet without stepping on a child and grumbled at the protest of his bones (because floors were for the young, ouch) and waded through the shifting pool of little bodies dogging his steps until he was standing in front of Bruce.
“Is he better now?” Tony asked, thinking forlornly of their search for another wounded man whose mind and body had been put at the mercy of the worst humans had to offer.
Well that was just rude. He was very tired of these AIM assholes fucking with his people. He thought of the kats at his shelter, of Harley Keener hiding somewhere upstairs who’d never been given a chance and hadn’t seen his father in six years because of a bitter old woman’s prejudice, and he thought about how their lives intertwined with his, how they’d been pulled into his orbit. He could bring them stars.
Next up in part two: Extremis kicks Tony's ass and Natasha bites a poisoned apple, AIM is pretty desperate to find a kitty they lost. Oh and there's this kid. Just Tony's luck.
The haze didn’t fade until after Tony’s been cornered by some chick with a bad haircut who has a glowing tattoo eating at her skin. She’s burning from the inside though he couldn’t smell the wrongness of it through the suits filtered air.
Hello! I needed to split this chapter into two parts so the second part will be posted on Sunday per the usual schedule. Enjoy the madness. Part one owes its title to, and is brought to you almost entirely by, "I Won't Say I'm In Love"
T’Challa smirked at him but had the tact not to say anything as he followed him through the living room. Tony watched curiously as the tom turned toward the kitchen Tony never used and made a beeline for it.
Tony felt so right there in his arms. Soft and sweet smelling with his heart beating against Steve’s chest. He couldn’t help the sudden stab of desperate fear that went through him at the thought of losing him, losing
“They’re talking about you and Jamie again” Kate announced without looking up from her tablet screen.
“For doing this to you. Clint’s right, I had no idea what I was doing and you trusted me. I’m sorry I let you down.”
The Wakandian king had made some statements, including a brief speech explaining why Wakanda had played the political equivalent of hermit for so many years; which had amounted to 'you're all crazy' and 'just leave us alone'.
Tony blinked in surprise and Steve forced himself not to squirm. Not many people knew that about him. Ma had always told Steve his father had died due to an old war injury when she thought he was too young to take the truth; and once he knew, well it wasn’t an easy thing to share with people.
"Mama?" He hedges, his voice high and thin with uncertainty and the two women part, laughing and wiping at their teary eyes.
Well then, Tony blinked at the unexpected turn. That was just fine, catch the stupid bird, get the materials and go home, except...
Oh boy... this was, this was heavy. Suddenly it was hard to breathe. Tony just had not been prepared for the weight of this. Not at all.
Only, what? No. Tony couldn’t fucking relax! There was the barn and Natasha and Harley, where the hell was Harley and –
“An air strip.” Darren repeated him blankly. “Tony when you said find me a private island I can build a shelter on I presumed you were talking about rebuilding Maria’s House.”
“Salvation.” Tony answered, aiming for a gentler tone. “Mrs. Keener. She’s your grandmother, right? I’m guessing Mom got herself in the family way and when Granny got wise to your parents romance she wasn’t too happy. Eventually Granny ships dear old dad up the river and kicks you out to the barn.
Since Fury's ultimatum Tony, Bruce, and Helen had been working non stop to take the basic design for a bot that Tony had initially rigged together to help Tony safely expel the energy build up from extremis and make their code more complex.
“I think what Tony’s saying is the Avengers are the only reason they’re giving us the time of day Director,” Steve summarized after a long moment and Tony’s grin shifted from something a little less sharp to a little more warm with appreciation.
“Not any more than we had with questioning the folks at Oscorp. Nobody has heard or seen anything to make them think that somebody within the company is illegally breeding black kats.”
“And the time after that?” Steve asked pointedly. “How many times am I going to have to watch him hurt you until we’re able to find him?”
Tony flinched inwardly at the word heat, uncomfortable with the idea of the strange tom knowing, or being able to smell him. It made him feel too naked, too much like he was fifteen again trapped in a room with Robert and Ty and unable to get away, unable to use his head properly as his last line of defense turned to chaotic mush in his skull and left him shaking and vulnerable.
"That's less important for you guys to worry about.  Avengers business. But there's a lot we could learn from this and a lot of ways we could develop superior weaponry out of Stark Resilient. "
These bonds they made with their beating hearts. They were more precious than any sacred gem to be found in all the realms, and they should be protected and cherished as such. There was no time for that like the Feast of Months that followed the Great Hunt for celebrating with your brethren. Thor had always done so with style and reckless abandonment but always, Loki had been there to watch over him and on his most favorite (and the most legendary) of occasions, to join in.
Tony’s heart ached at the admission, stepping closer into Steve’s space and wrapping his arms around his waist.
“JARVIS, have someone get rid of all the thread in the tower," Tony barked, decisively snatching up the tupoware.
Clint hadn't truly been comfortable since the battle for New York and the whole thing with Loki, and Bruce just never was.
“You care about him.” Natasha, who must have taken up mind reading when Steve wasn’t looking filled in. She laughed softly at his glower.
He was a dark well of untapped potentials and even so, even without daring to test his limits and race against the gods of their imaginations, he outpaced all but one or two minds in the world.
“I’ve fought those guys before Tony. They’re tough. You needed my help.” Peter insisted, straightening up in defiance once more. “I saved your life back there!”
Jaime was at the other end of the table keeping an eye on Phil. He was the baby of the bunch at eight years old, but if you called him that you’d be dealing with an epic tantrum for hours. He was also by far the most rambunctious, even more so than cousin Tommy.
He was staring through the wall, at something Bruce was fairly certain only he could see with such a despondent expression that Bruce faltered, suddenly cringing at the thought of intruding on the captain's solitude.
Tony woke as Bruce snuffled in his ear and right on que, JARVIS was there to help him great the morning, “Good morning Sir. The time is 12:30 PM in New York City. You are in your private quarters. Ms. Romanov has started a pot of coffee for you in the kitchen.”
Tony really hoped not. His gut told him there was something more going on here, something bigger than what the surface implied, but he wanted T'Challa to know that if there was evidence out there that Wakanda really was behind his stolen tech, Tony would find it. And when he did, there was going to be blood.
“Aye,” Thor raised his mug in hearty agreement. “The mighty Queens of the Kǫtrdýr are much the same. My mother has become well versed in gift giving since befriending Bastet – ”
There were plenty of agents with thin files deployed on suspiciously vague missions. But none of them were Gata and the ones deployed close enough to do a few side gigs weren’t feral.
Another update. Doing my best to keep this alive. :) Thank you for your kind words of encouragement and your feedback. I hope you enjoy it. If you're looking for some mood music, this title's chapter and driving inspiration is taken from Billy Joel's "For the longest time".
Tony was still snickering when the call connected, a familiarly modulated voice greeting him warmly.
SHIELD had been watching the ring for a while and Fury had been just impressed enough to offer Clint a gig as a spy in exchange for sparing his life. They called it contracted rehabilitation service. Clint didn’t have much of a choice about it because they don't bother putting kats in jail.
"You've been talking to Natasha?" Tony asked, poking at his bond with the Russian just to remind her that he had her number. Interfering matchmaking grandmother that she was trying to be.
“I can believe that.” Tony acknowledged with a wry grin. He’d never thought he’d meet anyone who was a match for Natasha but Nakia and Onsa had given her a real run for her money. True she had a healing injury slowing her down, but formidable was formidable.
Clint has seen inexperienced kats take all sorts of ungainly tumbles. Collarbones are a real (cumbersome) thing. But the great thing about having a really flexible backbone was that when a super-powered freak threw you through a window and you
Tony gave up on the idea of wresting the firearm away from Bucky in favor of making it inoperable, crushing the long length of the barrel between his fingers until the metal bent with a groan. Tony released his hold, expecting Barnes to drop the now useless weapon, only for him to drive the butt of the gun violently into Natasha’s stomach. And before Tony could even blink, Barnes had thrown himself forward, breaking free of her hold to slam his bionic fist against the side of Tony’s helmet with enough force to stagger him and leave his ears ringing like church on Sunday morning. Fuck but that hurt.
But they quickly figured out that a few centuries of vigorous domestication does a thing to the body. None of the adult gatas they tried to train could develop aggressive behaviors or mindsets and the domestication drugs had fried their ability to grow claws, which I'm sure you can guess didn't fit in well with the grand plan.
A moment later Cap and Bruce appeared running down the gangplank toward Tony in various states of distress. Bruce, still in the clothes Tony had last seen him in looked haggard and twitchy, like an addict who hadn’t had seen a bed or a fix in a dangerous amount of time. Steve looked less unkempt, but there was something brittle about his expression as his eyes flicked over Tony and the damage he’d left in his wake.
He stamped down on the sensation, not trusting it not to be some weird and potentially deadly side effect of the extremis virus, and arched a brow at Natasha, preparing to ask what she would use to defend herself in the worst-case scenario but the woman waved the unspoken words away, slowly lowering her upper half back to the couch with a pain filled sigh.
He wasn't the only one to have woken either. The large plush bed they'd been given was more like a giant feathered cushion and best that Tony could remember the six of them had piled onto it and fallen into drunken sleep.
“Pepper Pott!” He greeted with bright cheer as she appeared on the ceiling of his closet. He didn’t expect her to be bothered by the fact that he was in the middle of getting dressed, she’d seen him in far more intimate states, but when she cleared her throat there was an edge of warning to it that made him actually look at her.
“JARVIS, is Steve back yet?” Tony wondered aloud. Pale winter morning light was spilling in through the window now and assaulting Tony’s eyes. They’d both had a rough night, waking from nightmares and Tony had wanted Steve to stay in bed, maybe even to talk about it, but Steve had other ideas. Tony had barely managed to pry out of him that his nightmare hadn’t been about Barnes when he’d insisted that he was fine, and despite the early hour he’d abandoned the warmth of their bed for a pair of running shoes in order to literally run away from his problems. Tony snorted darkly at the little joke, casting his eye toward the shower.
“There are thirteen tribes that make up the nation. That makes thirteen chieftains whose respect the king has to demand. It has been the tradition for the king to take more than one wife. Isn’t that right?” the fel asked, a satisfied smirk on his lips as Prince T’Challa blinked at him, not quite able to hide his shock.
“I get it. Mommy gave you a job and you were just doing it. Really I do. Like I said, not my first rodeo with this sort of thing.” Tony waved a hand, eying a server with a tray of cocktails, desperately in need of a drink to cool off. Something to do with himself so he wouldn’t have to look at the tom and wouldn’t blurt out exactly what he heard himself blurting out a moment later.
That part had been easy. Tony could, thanks to Extremis, literally crack open SHIELD in his sleep if he wanted to- but sadly, going through all of SHIELDS files had provided little information.
“I am ready as ever to prove my skill in the hunt little MiKall!” Thor was saying as he placed the woman, (who must have been the blushing bride) back on the ground, not before allowing her to nuzzle him with her fur covered face. The room filled with the loud sound of purring.
“That’s all very interesting, but, and pardon me if this comes off as rude, why should I believe you?” Tony rose from his seat, the movement deceptively casual but Natasha couldn’t miss how it put distance between him and the tom. “Like at all? Seriously. Give me a reason to trust a single word. I’m dying of curiosity over here. ”
He twists to keep his eye on his target and sees that the shot went wide. The kat in the armor is staggering now, but he and the Walsh girl are still limping down the last set of escalators past the team of black clad SHIELD agents on their way up.
“Yeah, I think we’ve met.” Tony said with a swallow, unsure how to about the fact that he was in the debt of such a powerful stranger. “Your love life must suck.”
"Friend's huh?" Tony murmured, letting a soft purr of pleasure rumbling behind the sound as he lowered himself onto the arm of Steve's chair, leaning close his tail sliding against the bare skin of Steve's arm. "You kiss all your friends like that Rogers?"
When it worked it worked beautifully, the two of them seeming to share the same mind. Tony anticipating his commands before he gave them, appearing right where he needed him as if by magic. That symmetry reflected itself in the rest of the team, until they almost resembled the way T’Challa and his body guards had moved together. Like one animal.
“Slow. Stupid things aren’t even all that complicated in design. The pieces are just tiny and my giant man hands aren’t helping.”
“I’ve read the file Rogers. There was nothing you could have done for Barnes. Blaming yourself for something not your fault is not only ridiculously self-important, it’s self destructive. It’s like taking the knife out of your enemy’s hands and stabbing yourself with it. Stupid.”
“So!” Tommy whined. “Nobody’s a better shot than Kate and I’m so fast, hell I could take out those gunships all by myself. We don’t even need Uncle Steve.”
Yes! He really should, Tony completely agreed. He was this close to offering to share that shower with him because he was all about energy conservation but Steve was probably still pissed with him and Pepper would get on his case because he was in the middle of the biggest merger of his life, and really shouldn’t skip off to have shower sex with his boyfriend.
But you know, there’s probably a perfectly logical explanation for this. Numerous ones. The kits in both sets of dreams seemed pretty equally loved by all adults involved, so her appearing to go home with him isn’t actually what is bothering him.
The sound of Mr. Stark’s slightly amused voice broke through his stupor, and as the man stood there with hand extended waiting, Peter realized what an idiot he was being and leaped to his feet, snatching the offered hand.
Tony's face paled in horror and he jerked away from the memory.  Bruce winced, gripping Tony's hand tightly as if his withdrawal had pained him, but he refused to let go of Tony’s hand looking him squarely in the eyes he insisted, "It wasn't your fault."
He’d messed up in exactly the way Xavier had painstakingly warned him against. Too wrapped up in pain and fury to consider the consequences of unleashing his power upon a vulnerable brain. He didn’t stop even when he heard Barnes scream like that, wouldn’t have stopped until he’d turned Bucky’s mind to jelly if not for Princess. Somehow, she’d been able to reach him through that cloud of rage when no one else had. And he’ll get back to that later, because while it’s pretty clear there’s something going on there he needs to get to the bottom of, it’s not even in his top five at the moment of shit to handle.
“The reason you’re in here moping while Tony has been locked in his lab all morning. Is it good?” She asked, and Steve tensed at the slight squeeze of her hand.
"I was falling to my death." He pointed out and Tony couldn't see the guy's face but he could hear the smile in his voice.
While one corner of Tony’s brain was cataloguing everything he could, the other half was panicking because Clint had just taken a serious wallop and their quarry had turned to escape in another direction.
“He is the one they’d send after us,” Wanda reminded him. “This morning, I would have said I did not know if he could resist their call.”
Steve looked up, face blotched red and eyes wet with tears that only started to spill when he blinked at Tony in dazed confusion, expression caught somewhere between hope and hunger.
Leveling with Clint, Natasha and Bruce, Tony continued apologetically, "the independence clause in your contracts are dependent on a successful completion of a Pride bond. Natasha has the legal grounds to play hardball with SHIELD. Clint belongs to Agent Coulson who despite my bag of issues and personal bias, has proven to be the exception to the rule. So it turns out, good call on that one."
"He's done enough." Natasha saved him from having to come up with an answer and an answering growl rumbled in Clint's throat.
He noticed the way Tony’s eyes had opened to stare blankly at the ceiling and he noticed the faint blue glow that was emanating from the stone swinging at the end of the chain T’Challa wore, and the swell of pressure building in the back of his head as that prickling blossomed into hot pain; but he was inexplicably paralyzed, unable to make himself move to do anything about them.
"The Captain insisted that Stark was still fit for battle and assured me that if there reached a point where he felt that was no longer true that Stark would be benched until such a time as a cure for the virus could be found." Coulson answered in his usual calm way but Tony turned and blinked at him as if he'd stood up and shouted.
"I'm sorry Sir, but I could not defragment the audio samples further without compromising their integrity."
at around 11:30 PM. He would have gotten it sooner , except he’d been in the middle of a serious bout of engineering in his lab and had lost track of his phone .   Which had forced Pepper to call Rhodey, who’d come all the way to the tower to break the news that Sarah Rogers was trying to get in touch with him.  She’d called to let him  know  that  she didn’t have long  left and that she  had something she wanted to give him.  Apparently, it  was important, valuable , and  in her words big as fuck and too heavy  to mail so, “
“Didn’t SHIELD brief you on the team? Thor’s not from around here. His mother knows the original cat-woman who probably helped get the Alurio started.”
of Stark’s every reaction. He twisted and turned, keeping his opponent on the defensive with a bevy of tireless blows, each more forceful than the last. Iron Man held his ground as best he could but by design Ivan forced him back against the wall in increment steps. If it was a test of stamina Ivan would always win. The soldier had no limits. Stark didn’t have the same will power. It was easy for Ivan to see that he was holding back, defending his body skillfully against Ivan’s strikes but making no effort to harm him in return.
Coulson had gone to bat for him, and Clint had never been under any false impression that it hadn't cost him. Phil had never told him what deal he'd struck with Fury and part of Clint was grateful that he didn't know and couldn't add that weight to his conscience.
“Cause I kind of figured the whole spider boy thing was pretty special. But I guess I should have realized Norman made that sticky web stuff I found so genius.”
“I’ve got eyes, Cap. Hostage is on the third floor outside the Brooks Brothers. Our other targets are still in the bookstore on the – Shit!” Steve heard the spattering of more gunfire as Tony swore vehemently in his ear. “D.C.’s finest have the girl and one of the kids pinned behind an overturned vendor cart. They’ve opened fire on a civilian hostage for fucks sake!”
He thought, groaning as he pushed himself forward, moving again with lurching steps. She smiled at him, though he couldn't see it.
Pushing away from the chair he’d been leaning on Tony stepped smoothly between Natasha and the glowering she-tom, doing his best to pump out those calming pheromones fels were supposed to be so good at and forcing levity into his voice.
"My mother told me... when my father tried to breed me... she told me she regretted she couldn't be brave, like I was. She couldn't stand up to him, but she knew I could. She made me promise to protect my children. I can't risk bringing a child into my world Clint. I'll burn it down before I let them do to it what they did to me."
Yay for fast updates. Here is the second part of what was originally last chapter. :) Thank you for your continued encouragement and support with this story.
"By real do you mean someone qualified or someone human?" Clint asked nonchalantly, tossing what looked like a Hawkeye themed hackey sack between his hands, orange ears twitching. Tony was glad to someone had said it before him, because contrary to popular belief he wasn't all that keen on being president of the 'Give Cap a hard time' club, but you know what they say.
Over the com-line he heard Tony snuffle a snort and chuckle. Steve bit his lip to keep from grinning. A dick joke in the middle of a fight. Stark was really rubbing off on him.
“Okay, officially canning this discussion. Let’s just win this thing. Cap I’m going to put you down on the castle bridge.” Tony snapped and Steve, still hanging from Tony’s arms as they sped toward the castle mount grunted.
And then of course, the biggest fear of them all. With Bucky alive would Steve ever be ready to give himself to a new Queen?
Thankfully Tony didn't keep her waiting. From his pocket he produced a square metal device, small enough to sit in the palm of her hand, which she caught easily when he tossed it to her.
The modern obsession with metal made keeping silent more difficult. Her claws when fully extended were sharp enough to dig through some of the softer types but metal had a tendency to tell tales when struck. It meant having to move through the rafters mostly claw free, which was challenging, dangerous, and all the more thrilling for it.
Pepper said it made a threatening statement, wearing Wakandian armor in public, but Tony had grown used to their weight against his skin, and they’d saved his ass more than once when going hand to hand with Barnes.
The fact that she could be bonded to him, that they could share every memory and see the strongest parts of each other, and she could still think him so
That was him, always having to take credit, to stamp his name on things, to push and poke and make others eat their words.
"Some of you have decided to try and find a place in a family that needs you and I respect that. Stark Industries has and will continue to support cross-community rehabilitation by providing stipends to the veterans and low income families who desire true companionship and mutual growth in partnership with the Gata community and have a place in their homes for you.”
Well, Darren wasn’t wrong. Was he really going to do this? If he was, then he’d need Darren’s help and he’d have to be candid about it.
"Born in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo he received a certificate in minor education via the American School of Kinshasa, later went on to receive a high school diploma from Harvard - Westlake in a two year cram study, followed by an eight year work study residency at John Hopkins double specializing in physiology and medical engineering. All of this cumulating in a 'Class C' medical license which enables him to assist in the highest levels of  of biomedical research under the frankly insulting designation of 'Aide'." Tony rattled off, ticking off Debars educational landmarks on one hand as he went.
"Five," he answered readily. "Not because I'm some delicate tea cup who can't handle a little dose of hard truth, but because it's my
Though Bruce was still wary of SHIELD, getting a chance to study the pride effect on feral kats had been one of the major boons to agreeing to join the Avengers.
Ivan pushed Pietro out of the way and dove for the nearest shield he could find – a store mannequin propped up on a short platform – and cursed as the thing exploded into flaming pieces. He has only a second to wonder what kind of technology he’s up against when something caught him hard in the ribs and drove him off his feet like a charging bull.
“We are witnessing a marvel.” T’Challa announced, echoing Tony’s thoughts. “These youth are free Alurio. They have been trained in the ancient martial arts, knowledge that has been passed down from warrior to warrior and is now only practiced by the warriors of Wakanda.”
The bald admission didn’t surprise Tony, but the tense silence that fell over the room was heavy. T’Challa didn’t flinch from Tony’s hard stare, and if he noticed the way the air was thickening with the smell of fight he didn’t let it show.
Sighing, unable to be of use and knowing full well that neither of them were going to be able to get back to sleep Tony got up with the intention of going down to his lab to get some work done. The nano-bots were just about ready for a test run, but Helen and Bruce were insisting that Tony bring a doctor in and get a medical professional's input before he injected his body with an alien organism.
"I believe I can shed some light on that Sir," JARVIS, good old JARVIS, interjected saving Tony from his private nightmare. "She's here claiming to have information regarding the attack on the safe house."
He may as well have traded his healing factor for the world’s most annoyingly overactive antivirus software. Feeble tissue alert. Puny mortal detected. Delete this threat?
And that was when Natasha finally saw. She'd known Tony was afraid before, but the particulars were harder to grasp. The why behind the strength of his resistance had remained elusive despite every indication that the pride bond is only growing stronger. But Tony is right. There was still something in the way, a thin barrier that might as well be made from diamond for all that it refuses to bend or break.
Next to Tony Natasha somehow went impossibly stiller as Steve, securing a bottle of orange juice shut the refrigerator door with a snap and stared back at her with an expression riddled with guilt. That was what had been bothering him, Tony realized. Not the dreams where he was forced into Bucky’s shoes to relive some moment of his past, but these far more disturbing ones where he was forced into the shoes of a cold-blooded killer.
Tony watched with horror as he grabbed the metal bar that Natacha had been beating him across the face with and it bent in his hand, the metal smoking where his skin touched it. He used it to yank her toward him and though she quickly let go and attempted to knee him and dart out of his reach she wasn't quite fast enough.
"Steve..." Tony squeezed reached for his other hand, at a loss for words and Steve shook off the cloud of grief.
Because it was obvious to him who Steve must have danced with if not pretty girls. He could picture it well enough two boys goofing off in the privacy of their room, mimicking the popular dances they saw on the television. Maybe slow dancing, wishing they could be somewhere like this, with low lights and surrounded by warm bodies. In the open.
“It always should have been. Considering the amount of experimentation you were subjected to as a child your brains ability to prevent outside attacks and to self-heal was astounding by human standards.” T’Challa added. “But in comparison to healthy Alurio you were nowhere near where you should have been. None of you are."
He was he one who never accepted no for an answer and beat the system. He never quit, even when he was strapped down with a car battery embedded in his chest; and the next time some gata kit wants to go to school and they’re told their too stupid to learn or advance beyond menial labor at their job they know they don’t have to believe it.
"Okay. Here's the thing, screw that. " He snapped with a click of his jaw. His eyes quickly darted to Steve when he shifted slightly, so that he was in front of Natasha, partially blocking the fel from view as if to protect her from Tony's judgment and Tony had to fight not to roll his eyes. The last person who needed that sort of coddling was Natasha, but the fact that she didn't immediately try to remove his balls told Tony quite a lot more on its own.
She’s grateful when she feels RiRi’s arms slide around them but the light is so bright by then, and the roar in her ears so loud, that all she can do is cling to her small family and keep her eyes tightly shut.
He pulled back, not necessarily because he wanted to or even because it was smart. Honestly he just didn't want to hurt Steve, or to be hurt anymore, and he knew if he didn't heed that voice and give stepping with care a bit of try, then that was exactly what was going to happen.
The guy wearing the smirk wasn’t in uniform but Steve could tell he’d served just by the way he carried himself. That sort of training just never left you, and it was the easiest way to spot another soldier. The guy’s scent blockers were good. Even Steve’s serum sensitive nose couldn’t pick up his designation what with the crowd, but what he could pick up was distinctively sharp, lacking the muddled and slightly sour undertone that came from those who’d been subjected to domestication drugs. It was only noticeable if you knew to look for it.
Because while Tony didn’t know much about Steve’s personal life he knew that the subject of James Barnes was usually a closed one, and that if Steve was willingly talking about the past it could only be important to listen, however inane the subject matter might appear on the surface.
“So what do we do? Just give up?! Just say oh well we tried and wait around for twenty years for the universe to end again?” Tommy demanded.
*ducks* I'm sorry for the cliff hanger. But at least you know you only have to wait a week to figure out how Tony and Natasha got where they are and how they're going to get out of it. Thoughts? Feelings? Predictions? Any guesses as to what happened to Tony and Natasha? I hope you're enjoying the trip into Natasha's head. The decision to make her a secret literature enthusiast came purely from imagining kitty!Natasha snuggled up by a fire with the kits and a giant book.Too cute to resist and I promise we're getting to the fluff and cute part, but you know they all have to come together first and they like to take their time about it.
Maybe it thinks I’m Ironman he’d thought, and it had made him feel bolder. He’d realized that the robots couldn’t see how scared he was behind his mask, or smell him. They didn’t know he was just some weak kit, and not just as brave or strong as Ironman.
“It is only that I’ve never seen halflings before." MiKall explained. "I’ve heard of you but I never thought I’d get a chance to see you. Thor why did you not tell me you were bringing guests? They are such darlings. I am overcome.”
Natasha closed her eyes and drifted into sleep, content in the knowledge that they would die no sooner than they chose.
“If there’s no Civil War it means our parents don’t meet.” Tommy appeared at Nyota’s shoulder as if out of thin air and she jumped, scowling at him.
“Actually, see these slight indents here,” Tony asked, picking up the thick but still surprisingly light disk and rubbing the area. “It’s part of a bio security system they use in Wakanda.”
floor of Stark Tower, he honestly wished he’d given it some greater thought. Not that he seriously thought a guy like Mr. Stark would even look at him twice. A fel that amazing would never look Peter’s way even if he wasn’t old enough to be Peter’s dad.
“Well that was a depressing memory.  Gotta say Bucky, I liked that time we went and got hot dogs on Coney Island better.”
This was an easy job, Natasha could already tell. The people who worked here relied too heavily on the secret nature of their operation and their defenses would be as easy to cut through as warm butter; but despite that she found it hard to relax.
Wordlessly one of the she-toms stepped forward with palms open. Resting in her hands was a little golden chest with intricate designs carved over its gleaming body. Smoothly she flipped the latch, and opened the lid on silent hinges and Tony’s whiskers twitched, feeling the pressure of the crowd as they pressed ever closer to see what the chest contained. For a moment he worried the reporters were going to break the guard ropes but his thoughts were quickly occupied by wonder at the gift itself.
The kit can’t smell him because- well truth is, he doesn’t know why. That’s wrong too. Everything else about the store is right. Mr. Allen’s smiling face, the shelves full of canned goods now that nobody can afford the fresher stuff. He can smell Mr. Allen’s sweat, Mrs. Finnegan’s dog that even her heavy perfume can’t hide from his nose, and even the fresh bread that Marilyn bakes every morning, but he can’t smell the fancy looking kat with the funny beard who waves at him and smirks like he knows something nobody else does.
When Tony was a kit his parent (and bio daddy) used to tell him stories about Captain America; how despite all his disadvantages he was brave and honest and true.
“We’re going to have to have another family meeting. We can’t keep up this pace. It’s not fair on the kids.”
Some weirdos in rubber hazmat suits had decided to pay a rehabilitation center a visit, which meant Clint was being woken up at precisely 5:48 AM, ten minutes before the Avengers alert went out, because when you slept with the boss you got the early bird special.
“He doesn’t even have time for the salute. Happy just pulled the car up and the traffic on FDR is ridiculous right now. Let’s go gang. Clint fix your tie.” Pepper announced like a drill sergeant and like the smart little underlings they knew they were they all complied without complaint. The drive was, well a drive across town during rush hours, during a big deal event so by the time Happy was being waved through the gates of the private entrance at JFK Tony was ready to kill himself. That or strangle Clint who wouldn’t stop griping about Tony’s music choice.
“Only if you trust Hansen and Stone aren’t in on it with him,” Clint growled. “You can’t trust Stone Tony.”
“The flexibility of the coccyx bones combined with the smaller shape of the skull and the wider spread of the pelvic bones are positive indicators that we’re dealing with an adolescent female.” Helen pointed out, as JARVIS replayed the clip at a slower speed. “Her companion is likely a male, a few years further along in development, but both of them are displaying motor movement typical of those with superior muscle and bone elasticity and a lower pain threshold.”
Clint winced. Okay. She had him on that one. But those were two very unique, very specific jobs that are not likely to ever see a repeat. I mean, how likely is it that he’ll be sent in to either assassinate or double cross a potential pridemate again?
No wonder Bucky had never told him about the baby. No wonder Tony still didn’t trust him. Steve didn’t trust himself either. That was the problem.
“Clint? Clint Barton!” Tony sighed, wincing a moment later at the way the shirt under his blazer stuck to the sweat drying on his back. “You know I never thought I’d be so glad to see you again, but I stand corrected. And to answer your question, you can’t change a tire if you don’t have anything to change it with. I can’t believe the rental place didn’t include a spare.” Barton smirked at him, obviously knowing something Tony didn’t.
Tony alerted T’Challa as he sat down to finish reading through the file that shield had sent Steve. The best part of Steve being in charge of the strike team tasked with apprehending the thieves at large and Tony only being pulled in as a consultant was that he didn’t have to be out there on the streets of the city, following nowhere leads and pointlessly interrogating terrified kats and their owners about their activities or the possibility of their neighbors hiding black kats.
Fury had suspected he wasn’t right, because when he'd asked Steve to join the initiative he'd said so.
To Tony he is always just Rhodey. Rhodey who stepped in when he didn't have to. Who always does. Rhodey who follows Tony even though he thinks he's crazy because somebody has to keep him out of trouble. Rhodey who cares.
Here's the last thing you need to know: among fels there is a second classification, a higher tier if you'll allow. They call them Queen Felinus, or just Queens for short. They're the pride matriarchs, the ones that bonded everybody else together and held absolute authority over pride affairs.
Tony tilted his head to consider Steve closely, looking for any hint of uncertainty. Truth be told, the thought had occurred to him before this.
Splitting pain blossomed in the center of Tony’s mind once more and he slumped over the desk with a moan as his head went blessedly blank, like someone had cut a circuit somewhere. He lay there, breathing shallowly, hoping the pain would fade.
"Well, you go to catholic mass, don't you? And you've been baptized." He says after a moment and Tony can hear what it is he doesn't say, the implicit ‘you tell me’ in his wording.
“Now now Sourpatch, he is our guest.” Tony patted Rhodey affectionately on the chest, making his medals clink. He really was just an overprotective teddy bear. Little did those poor frightened recruits he terrified know. “Besides, I see Pepper desperately trying to get your attention.”
They'll take less pay because they're desperate and they don't have citizenship to protect them. Tony knows Hughard is against employing them on principle (those same principles that will kill him and Tony's mother one day). He says that it pushes tax paying citizens out of work; but Tony knows that equally important to his father is the fact that they are not German and that they are less for that.
Steve had never minded. There had always been enough of Ma to go around. Tony Stark had been no different. Steve had been so grateful for that once. Still was if he were honest. He wasn’t that petty, to deny Tony a chance to say goodbye just because they hadn’t worked out, but he hadn’t seen Tony Stark in years and seeing him again, now, like this ... Steve didn’t know if he was ready for it.
“Princess Nichols. Do you prefer Ms. Nichols or Princess?” he asked, mentally rifling through the file on her as he offered his hand to shake.  The girl flinched as if hearing her name come out of his mouth hurt her in some inexplicable fashion and Tony thought for one terrifying moment that she might burst into tears. But the emotion, whatever it had been, was gone in a blink of her eyes and then it was like she took on another persona entirely.
Speaking of shock’s though. Tony’s thoughts were derailed as Thor’s hammer slammed directly into his chest, his distraction allowing Thor an opening to score another hit that sent him flying backwards into a post, his body slamming up against the sharper edges of the suit as he tried to orient himself and get back in the air before he fell into the metaphorical lava pit below.
“That blade, it’s Wakandain too isn’t it?” Tony asked tersely, and T’Challa looked to him, hesitating a fraction of a moment before he nodded solemnly.
Tony opened his mouth again to speak when a shrill beeping filled the lab. Tony's eyes flew to the wide screen in the center of the lab where JARVIS had been helping with the other part of his side project. The screen was flashing big red letters: SIGNAL LOST
"Maybe some other day, but I'mma get real bold in a second and ask you for an introduction to your mate."
Steve was not a big fan of fancy dinner parties. He’d not been invited to a lot before waking up from the ice and becoming an Avenger. Just a few fundraisers in the early days of his recruitment (back when they’d needed people to buy war bonds and he and Bucky were a sensation) but even that limited experience had been enough to cure him of any itch he may have had to attend one.
Was she his? Tony wondered. In some future where Bucky Barnes had never become the Winter Soldier and T’Challa wasn’t tied to the crown of Wakanda, could that beautiful little girl have been his?
"We've got four geniuses working on this, but even so there will always be a margin for error. I'm with Steve, I'd still like to know what happens if your body rejects the compound."
“If something were to happen to me before you and your brother are grown, it would fall to your uncle to lead our people. And he would do it well, because he was not a foolish kit who thought that being a mighty Alurio meant he could skip out on his lessons. Have you heard me?”
“Enough now. Talk to Tony. While you’re in here, you’ve left him alone to deal with this. You get one of these. Pull this again and I might just decide to make a bid of my own for Consort.” He huffed a laugh and she squeezed his shoulder before heading for the door. She paused in the doorway and turned back to look at him for a moment.
Tony didn’t realize he was still speaking until he recognized the lingering echo of his own voice in the barn, choked on a sob. Natasha had lifted a hand and was stroking it through his hair, and he shouldn’t be so damn needy, especially when she was injured, but he couldn’t help but sink into her. He let the gesture sooth him until his breathing had evened and the unspilled tears had dried up and he could blink the fugue of misery and panic away.
"Did you know that that what I saw in my vison isn't real? Steve thinks I saw some future where Barnes somehow survived that fall off the train. In other words, some sort of what could have been."
Hi, I have decided on a posting schedule of Sundays & potentially Thursdays if things stay this steady. With the holidays one never knows so, definitely expect a weekly update on Sunday and if there's time for a bonus you'll know by Thursday.
Without further prompting JARVIS began to play another clip and Tony took in a sharp breath, a feeling inexplicably close to betrayal trickling through him as he watched Luke Debar signing in with tower security along with his uncle, their first day at the tower.
He didn’t see her explode, mashed to Steve’s chest like that but he felt the sudden blast of heat and the force that slammed them both to the ground.
“Okay.” Steve’s voice was oddly quiet within the room, raspy and breathless, but his eyes were drinking him in with amazement. Tony purred louder in satisfaction and pulled Steve’s mouth back to his.
“And I’m too old to believe in Santa Clause Tony get real.” Harley rolled his eyes from atop his perch and Tony scoffed rudely in response.
Indeed, Thor had a large bowl in front of him and was happily shoveling what looked like some sort of stew into his mouth.
"You know the difference between a democracy and a monarchy as well as I do. You read the file Steve. I'll admit I was surprised at first when I heard you'd agreed to sign on, but it makes sense." At his incredulous look the curve of her mouth just deepened. "You don't like authority, because yours is the only authority you really trust. A guy with that kind of chip on his shoulder only really has one option when it comes to governing trust: marry the Queen. ”
“Worry less about me,” he finally grunts, even though it has been minutes since she spoke. “You two have to be ready for tomorrow.”
She crept over the long metal ceiling beams, her booted feet silent and swift as she slunk down the rafter and closer to the center of the room, unconcerned for the great height or the nasty fall that could be the result of a slip in footing. She knew her body intimately and had confidence in its ability to remember each needed movement. Hesitance could mean death so she never hesitated, timing each leap perfectly so as to hit the beam at just the right angle to get a solid grip and create the least amount of sound while doing so.
The exception is of course when a parent gets frisky with their kitty (happens all the time but getting stuck with progeny is the taboo part) and the kit gets stuck with the wrong set of active genes?
“Goody.” Tony replied. “In the meanwhile, we need to figure out what the hell they wanted at Oscorp so badly they were willing to break in. We need to try and anticipate their next move, before the situation gets any messier.”
The old woman tells him the price for the plums in English, and then mutters in Spanish that he is a scary looking brute who shouldn’t sneak up on an old woman.
It was possible that their mystery woman was a Rhodes but the likelihood that she was another kat was higher and Luke, even if he wasn't the right gender, was the right ethnicity and had already mentioned having a sister.
“Even then, the device isn’t exact enough for us to pick when in the timeline we wanted to jump to.” Nyota reminded everybody. She was thinking quietly to herself, franticly trying to come up with a solution that worked and running into the same unwanted conclusion.
Tony asked. His concern was deep and soft in her mind, like the impression of a blanket. She wondered if he knew how soft he was, this man of Iron. This man whose body might even know be on the brink of explosion.
Tony had always prided himself on being a strong independent kitten who didn’t need no flea-bitten tom, but lately… lately he just wasn’t right unless his teammates were close. His need to know where they were at all times was only surpassed by his need to know that they were well. The smell of them safe and happy, enjoying the comfort of his tower and his gifts just did something for him. Honestly it was better than Nip.
They know (even if he doesn’t yet) that he likes to read (science fiction and fantasy) and they know all his favorites: stories, foods, colors, sights sounds, and they don’t know why he always forgets or seems to be discovering them for the first time, but the hunger in him calls to them and they bring these things to him. They hold these pieces for him because they are holding them for themselves.
"Ride The Lightning is an American treasure Rogers, and our anthem is rooted in oppression and glorifies the government of our oppressors."
complicate things. Tony's determined to unravel the mystery on their hands and to continue their quest to find the Winter Soldier. Well, they find him alright and he's quick with a knife. Who would have guessed.
“Extremis.” Bruce answered with a bit of an awed gleam in his eye. It was always nice when other people understood how awesome this kind of thing was.
Killian dropped to the floor but Tony could see even as he struggled to get up, slipping in his own blood, how his body was already closing around the ghastly wound.
Thank god Cap had no idea how absolutely lethal his brand of Golden Boy good looks could be when coupled with seemingly simple gestures of approval or Tony would just have to throw the damn towel in.
"I have been thinking long on your work." The Asgardian began, sliding the mug of warm milk Tony's way, which he snatched up gratefully as Thor continued. "If your tiny robot friends can truly do all that you say, then I believe that is the answer to your worries."
," A lazy grin painted across his face and Steve tried to ignore the way Tony was slurring on his words as the genius pushed his face in Steve's chest. "I missed you."
, out of all the things said yet, that was what hurt the most because Tony was never the one who just said he can't.
"You don't mean that," He whispered quietly against his lover's forehead, pressing a light kiss and chose to ignore the way Tony
"Well, someone has to feed you, right?" Steve managed to pass a small smile before standing up from the edge of the bed, "Sandwich sounds okay?"
. His face had lost all of its usual charm, looking thin and malnourished. His hair were messed up and Steve could almost imagine the way the genius must have pulled at his repeatedly. The white of his brown eyes was tainted with red and the lack of sleep was so apparent that Steve's chest tightened with worry.
Steve felt the air knocked out of his lungs at the statement. Tony didn't stutter and it only made his assumption concrete that this was something that had been on the genius's mind for awhile. His tone sounded resigned as if the battle was already lost. Steve couldn't help but stutter, "Wha--? Why would I-- Tony, why would you even think that I wanted to
"Tony," He couldn't help the annoyance that brushed off in his tone, "You know you have a heart condition, right? Do you
"Is he not an adult? Mind I say an adult that can change into a raging green monster if he is forced to do something he doesn't want to?" He raised his eyebrown in anticipation silencing the man who just ducked his head, avoiding Steve's intense gaze. "And I should have known better too."
"We fought," Steve said quietly, running the calluses of his thumb across Tony's collarbone, the guilt scratching at his throat, "When we got back the sceptre, you were acting different and I didn't get why and we just-- we
The familiar grasp at his left wrist tugged him down, preventing him from getting up as he turned his head back in confusion at the intervention. Tony was balancing his weight on one elbow, his other one holding Steve's wrist. His hair fell back, messed up against the motion as he sat there, biting his lower lip, his eyes still not focusing on Steve. Eyes that were full off uncertainty and hesitance.
"I hate myself for all of it, Steve." It was whispered like a secret that would never see the light of the day. "Everything I did-- I just, I
He gazed down at his husband whose small figure was folded onto itself against the white sheets, his eyes still spaced out as the brown orbs stared at the far right corner of the room. Steve sighed, gently running his fingers across his scalp before he bent down to press a kiss and murmured, "I will be back in a minute."
Because for that moment, everything made sense and nothing seemed like it had been in vain. For that moment of utter happiness and bliss and peace, the fact that he had spent seventy years in ice or that he had once lost everybody he loved or that he woke up to see that the world still needed saving-- everything seemed like it was worth it.
." He didn't even remember what it was about. Maybe something about Tony acting closed off for no reason or the fact that not knowing enough about the Maximoff twins was getting on his nerves. He always knew he was a control freak and one thing escalated into another and then, they had a fight. He should have seen what was coming. "I should have known better."
. Maybe it was the post-battle rush fading away as the weight of their actions fell upon him, or just the fact that the silence in the tower echoed the emptiness in his heart. It was understandable -- the rest of the team moving in the new facility, it made sense. They would still, more often than not, be at the tower to visit and Steve was pretty sure atleast one of them would be staying over all the time. It was okay.
. He let out a gasping shuddering breath, remembring the floating city falling down to its demise. He remembered how he had almost accepted it -- looking at that beautiful of a view was certainly not that bad of a way to die; he could think of worse scenarios. But it seemed that for the first time in forever, he didn't want to die in a mission. The fact that it scared him seemed so foreign. No. He didn't want to die. He wanted to live. Things had been going so good - they had Peter now, he had a son. He wanted to be there for him to grow up and be there for his first dance and send off to college as he would hug a misty-eyed Tony who would probably be way too emotional for his own good --
The genius's hands continued to fumble absentmindedly with the mess of wires and Steve's heart dropped at the unacknowledgement. Something was wrong. So
His husband visibly deflated, his hand falling dead weight against the linen sheets. He clenched his eyes shut, the pain visible as his face contorted into a frown. It reminded him of those days. The days early in their relationship-- when they pretended they were just friends but not quite-- when Steve wasn't aware of Tony's trauma and there were walls he could never get past through. It took him time to learn certain things - why Tony hated going swimming in pools or why sometimes a bombing in a movie would make him have a panic attack. Afghanistan was the answer to a lot of things, he assumed but there were so many that he yet didn't understand about the man he was falling in love with. The audible quavering sigh that escaped Tony's lips made Steve's chest seize in panic. The way Tony was clinging onto him wasn't his usual cute way -- when Steve would have to unwrap a koala Tony from his arms with ten different versions of
The engineer sat up halfway, his hands wrapped around his abdomen with his head rested against his knees. His jaw visibly clenched as his knuckles tightened around themselves. Steve visibly frowned, going to hold his hands because god, didn't Tony see he was hurting himself with the cuticles of his nails digging in his palms? But before he could, the genius turned away and Steve's heart dropped to his stomach. Tony had never seemed so small.
"And even after that. I should have understood where you were coming from," He shook his head, disappointed in himself, "You had to deal with it alone. I am your husband, I should have been there for you more. Everyone was blaming you and- and Thor almost
Steve knew there was no dearth of bleak promises in their world. Meaningless promises were made and broken but that night, as he held a shaking Tony in his arms, Steve promised himself that he would never let the man feel as if he was unloved, as if Steve would ever leave. He couldn't promise him a forever-- they both knew it didn't exist but Steve would be damned if the man he loved spent his life in fear that he was going to be abandoned. So, he held Tony tightly against his chest, every touch reassuring of the fact that they were together and alive as he whispered the following words, a promise that he would never break.
As much as he still believed getting a chance to meet the Kǫtrdýr was an opportunity he could not pass up, he had the growing feeling that nothing about this trip was going to be easy on them.
There were many things about Midgardians that Thor appreciated. They were small creatures, with lives that lasted the span of a rain drop, but for all that, he’d never met a species who could cram so much passion (and so much misery) in a single lifetime.
Steve had noticed when the others had gathered back at the tower to head out that each of his Gata teammates, by some unspoken agreement, seemed to have dressed that night to make some sort of statement.
Sonia hummed lowly in thought, a hint of malice in her smile as she shrugged her dainty shoulders and replied, “on the contrary. Negro kats are a very popular breed this year. They are the closest to true Alurio as you said.”
Ivan’s eyes darted to where Pietro was fighting with a similarly armored kat reevaluating the situation. If this wasn’t Stark then these weren’t Avengers. The kat fighting Pietro was too short to even be the Widow. The blue tendrils of bright magic blasting from the kat’s palm in a flickering wave put any doubt of that to rest. Ivan watched as those magic tendrils caught and twined around Pietro’s limbs, weighing him down, leeching Pietro of his supernatural speed. None of the Avengers had abilities like Wanda.
Tony told himself he needed to escape before Steve woke. But he quickly dismissed that too, realizing that only one car was waiting for them, parked near that abandoned field. Tony liked to irritate Steve but stranding Steve out here would be cruel, and Tony despised cruelty.
Tony heard his name again, and this time the voice was familiar, filling him with a bit of much needed warmth.
Suddenly Tony became very aware of his crumpled-up t-shirt and the motor oil on his hands and arms that he hadn’t bothered to wipe off.
Tony stopped, his blood turning red hot as Jarvis spoke in his earpiece. “No, I suppose coercion works better in person.” He laughed, a dry, hollow thing.
As he walked out the door, Tony thought he should have felt triumphant that he’d been able to render Captain America speechless and proven him wrong in their first encounter. But instead, Tony sensed that this meeting had gone exactly the way Nick Fury had intended it to—and that was somehow the worst of it all.
“Fine?” Clint said slowly, as though saying something too quickly would frighten off Tony’s agreement.
They all knew he was the only other option. Nat and Clint were out of the question. They’d spent their whole life feeding off of lies and surrounding themselves with isolation. Banner wasn’t reliable, and Fury was keeping information about Thor to himself for now.
He was a sinfully beautiful man. Bright blue eyes in the shade of desires and dreams sat on either side of a perfect nose. Could noses even be attractive? His was definitely the most attractive nose Tony had ever seen. The man’s blonde hair looked as if nothing softer could exist on earth. His biceps were bigger than Tony’s own head, for God’s sake.
. What do you want?” He didn’t bother hiding the animosity in his voice. He knew why she was here, and he knew how this was going to end—but that didn’t mean he’d make it easy on her.
The path that had once been neatly carved into the cliff had become a rough trail as it cut a jagged route down the steep cliff. Boulders, fallen trees and overgrown shrubbery obstructed their way. It seemed as though every ounce of nature was against their journey—and Tony couldn’t disagree.
They stood in silence, squinting in the sunlight. Steve looked around, slowly turning in a circle with his hands on his hips. Tony searched as far as the computer in his glasses allowed him to see, looking for anything.
Tony must have misheard; water was still in his ears, and he was sure Steve had been wishing he would fall off a cliff right before it actually happened. He ignored Steve’s until the man grabbed him by the shoulders, looking him over for injuries.
Tony pulled his glasses off of his face, remembering Clint’s comment. He honestly wasn’t sure which pair he’d grabbed in his dismay of leaving the house. The metallic lenses flashed, their dark purple shimmering in the light. The Stark Industry logo was etched faintly on the side into the dark silver metal.
I think this chapter brings up a really relevant question about how much we as a society should be willing to forgive. Especially in this era where authors, producers, directors, actors etc. are being exposed we have to decide for ourselves if these are horrible people or normal people who have made horrible mistakes.
Anger shaded Tony’s thoughts, and he continued to put on the suit. “Do you know how irritating you are?”
As Tony turned down a dirt road to their destination, he felt vaguely queasy, uncertain whether the emotion inside him was anger or fear. He didn’t have time to sort it out.
Hair clung to his forehead as he broke free, and water poured down his face. His clothes clung to his shaking body, threatening to drag him under again. Tony kicked furiously, trying to keep them from going numb as much as he was trying to stay afloat.
Tony glared at Steve’s side. “You shouldn’t be allowed to comment on anything that someone without super hearing wouldn’t hear.”
Even when he was silent, Steve seemed to be telling Tony he was better than him. A sinister voice inside of him whispered that Steve was right. Tony’s life had been full of people who had left him behind—all for good reasons.
Tony had decided a long time ago that he didn’t need to be present at a meeting for someone to tell him where to throw his money. He’d thought Fury had recognized that too.
Fury’s argument was more reasonable that Tony cared to admit—in fact, it was similar to the reason he kept building so many suits. But so what if Fury
Nat ignored him and pushed off of the doorframe, walking into his shop and invading his territory like a hunter does to its prey. Apparently, she was done with their verbal sparring and had decided it was time to pull the trigger. It wasn’t a decision Tony was thrilled about.
“Glad you’re finally joining us” Fury said dully as Tony entered the room, stepping right into the director’s piercing gaze. It didn’t sound like Fury was glad at all, really.
“You’re freezing too.” Tony pointed to Steve’s lower half, soaked from when he’d grabbed Tony from the river. “We just need to keep moving,” he said, pretending not to hear the chatter in his own voice.
This had to be Clint Barton, the hawk-eyed archer—and Natasha’s partner in crime. If Tony wanted to make it through this team alive, it’d would be good to have someone like him on his side.
Tony stalked to the side of the shop with the couch, to the small kitchenette there. He  poured himself a cup of coffee and looked around, squinting in the glittering light that poured in from the windows. Everywhere his eyes touched, problems and ideas jumped out at him. He worked to sort through them, tossing out the more ridiculous thoughts and prioritizing the important ingenuities.
The girl was, moving too quickly to notice their confusion or wait for a response: “You’d better hurry—they close the gates at midnight! Could you imagine coming all this way and being left outside?”
“Are you ever going to tell me what happened?” Steve eventually said when they stopped, after the dirt path had transformed into a firmer road paved with prismatic, glittering, stones. The cobbled road stretched farther than the eye could see—disappearing into the towering gates that pressed into the sky.
“Hey—tell me about your new roommates,” Rhodey quickly added, knowing Tony wasn’t one to discuss heartfelt feelings. “They’ve been there two weeks now?”
It was charming and enchanting, but even more unnaturally still than Steve had noted on the cliff. The shops were closed and their windows dark.
“Probably because they know something we don’t.” A grim voice rang out like thunder, breaking Tony’s gaze at Fury. His eyes flicked to the one corner of the room he had tried his best to ignore until now.
“Tony?” A hand pressed into his back, and Tony tried to hold on to the solid weight. “Tony, talk to me,” Steve ordered him. His voice sounded distant against the beat of Tony’s heart.
Tony looked around to find something that would fit him. His choices were limited to extravagant variations on suits and tuxes that were all stunning. One in a heavy glass box claimed it could turn the wearer invisible. On a better day, Tony’s curiosity would have gotten the best of him, but instead he grabbed a suit near to him and the fire.
Tony began kicking off his waterlogged shoes unbuckling his belt but Steve wasn’t moving. Instead, his eyes were darting back and forth between his own bland clothes and Tony’s.
“I could never keep up with him, he was always working on so many projects at once. In the same month he’d have traveled all over — different states, different countries. And he taught me all about, uh —
“Barton, how many times do I need to tell you that you have absolutely no idea how to whisper before it finally gets through your skull?” They both startled at Nat’s intruding voice.
The sun was getting lower in the sky, signaling it was the late afternoon. Sunlight peeked through the trees, mocking them in a joyful dance among a never-ending stage branches and leaves.
Swallowing a curse, Tony hastily pushed up from the ground, away from Steve’s stilled, skilled fingers. He didn’t care if he saw him scrambling away; it would be far less uncomfortable than anything Steve would have said, he was sure of it.
The next morning, only a few hours into Tony’s feverish dreams, Fury held a meeting at SHEILD. This time, the Avengers were not notified. Instead, only Fury and his closest agents filled the room with their whispers.
Like all the other times he had tried to shut off his brain—without the help of a handle of vodka—it didn’t work well. But denial had always come easy to him, so he kept silent, and they kept walking.
A couch which hunkered in the back-left corner of the room had become his bed, though it had certainly seen better days. It’s upholstery was so stained with coffee, grease and other questionable substances and experiments that the color of the couch was unrecognizable. Now drool joined the mashed-up mess of brown and black stains.
Sudden anger washed over Tony, hardening his vision. Why the hell did things like this keep happening to him? Was there some great cosmic plan with the only goal of screwing Tony Stark?
Slowly, he opened his eyes. “I don’t know where we are, Steve. I don’t know.” The panic attack made it hard to be ashamed of the crack in his voice.
Steve’s posture sagged with relief, mirroring Tony’s own. They weren’t crazy. Or, at least, he wasn’t going crazy alone.
“Whether I like it or not.” Tony could hear Rhodey shake his head. “But quit changing the subject Tones,” Rhodey ordered. “Tell me about the team!”
Princess. They tend to like the bad boys.” Tony controlled his temper and gave Steve his best smirk, enjoying the way the man’s nostrils flared with anger.
Had Fury really thought this would work? That he could bring Tony in last minute to clean up a mess he couldn’t handle?
Since she had left, Tony was spending even more time with the workshop smell, not bothering to emerge most days for anything but food and showers, though Pepper would have told him he needed more of both. He’d taken to sleeping there, too. What reason was there to leave? He’d be back in the morning and no one was waiting for him upstairs.
In fact, nature probably had made a law against it, but Howard had just sent a giant ‘fuck you’ to the universe, like always.
Three weeks went by in three excruciatingly short seconds. Between renovating the penthouse and designing company projects, Tony’s work on the suits had been dramatically underwhelming. Late nights had become even more sacred to him during those weeks. The vacuous sound of empty rooms and corridors was his music, the hiss of a blow torch and the sharp clangs of metal his prayers.
Gauzy clouds had sailed into a position covering the sun and hung low in the sky. The land was cast into a haze of shadows which lessened the comfort Tony had felt from seeing signs of civilization.
Tony couldn’t help but wonder, did a super soldier sweat more or less than the average human? What about the smell? He slammed a wall down before his mind could push further. Experiments like that always got him in trouble.
Tony slid into the slacks and went to retrieve the matching socks and shoes from by the fireplace. In the process, he caught sight of his reflection in a long, elegant mirror at the end of the room.
“Prick,” Tony shot back, rolling the tension from his shoulders and pressing onward. He had a game to win.
Clint answered Fury with a carefree shrug, walking forward to the end of the table. “Are you asking if we actually want to join you? Because I can give you my honest answer. Coulson and I have been working on this honesty thing.” Clint put his right hand over his heart and raised his left, “I solemnly swear that I am —”
Tony kicked at a stone, watching as it grew smaller, tumbling to the far away ground and dashing against the rugged terrain of rocks and fallen logs.
The man grinned wolfishly and exited back out of the gates, leaving Steve’s question lingering in the air. They turned around and began walking.
His arm was going to be yanked out of his socket as he was dragged through the water and thrown to the ground, bouncing against the rocky sand. Tony lashed out—and heard a satisfying grunt when his hand made hard contact with something.
Coulson and Fury turned from Clint and looked at Tony expectantly, as if he were holding some kind of answer. He always had answers, but they were never the kind guys like Fury wanted. He opened his mouth to speak, but was stopped short.
So he cranked out updates for the suits—sending software to Rhodey as soon as he could after their conversation, labeling it ‘best friend discount.’ But in between the company, charities and mandated Avengers meetings, the only time he could get to the shop was at late at night.
“She wanted me to check up on you. I really was sorry to hear about you two; she was good for you.” Her eyes were wide and lips soft with an innocence and sadness; her voice was sickly sweet.
Tony shrugged, fighting off the grin that always came when someone appreciated his work. “They’re nice, yeah? I designed them myself.”
“Let’s get it over with,” Fury nodded at them. Their reports on the Avengers Initiative had been nothing but a headache for him the last two weeks, but if they could pull it off it would be worth all of his suffering.
Tony was a man of logic. Science and math; numbers and equations. Everything had an explanation, even if it was an undiscovered one. They were on another planet—all the evidence pointed to it—but that didn’t mean he knew what the hell was going on.
The soldier stayed silent, processing the Tony’s nonsense. He was more tired than he’d thought he was, Tony realized. But then again, that was usually the case. It was simple to keep going while he was working, but the moment he stopped was the moment he crashed.
“He’s too reckless, you’re right.” Hill confirmed; her mouth drawn into a thin line. “But we’ll be lucky if we can get one to follow the other.”
Steve ignored the comment. Did he even get it?If Steve hadn’t read or watched Harry Potter yet, Tony could stop feeling bad about harassing the guy. “But what if the server crashed or you’re signal is weak? Why does this mean we’re not on Earth?”
“Then look somewhere else! You can take my money, take my designs—have my cars for all I care!” Tony placed his hands on the table, leaning forward to avoid any confusion on the matter, “But you cannot take my home.”
Tony looked down at the invitations, where now only two words were written on them, the same on each:
Tony barreled down the path—wilder than nature itself, letting out steam on the branches that he violently yanked out of his path and the rocks that he aggressively hurdled himself over. He hated how aware he was of the space between him and Steve. It wasn’t enough.
century. We know that’s not true. But Steve Rogers was born in a time where the enemy was easy to spot. They marked themselves with swastikas.”
“At least I’ll have a fair fight in a game. And no one we’ve met so far has been any threat to us, or did you forget that it was you who raised a spear to a girl in the woods?”
But Tony could see a bit of his father in Steve too: in the expression that Tony had grown up staring into. Disappointment.
the best friend discount!” Tony scoffed. “Just weld another machine gun to your shoulder, I’m sure you’ll find room somewhere.”
“Magician?” The girl was speaking so fast, it rivaled even the way Tony spoke when ramped up on caffeine. Neither Steve nor Tony knew what was going on, but maybe he had heard her wrong.
“I’d be pretty stupid to be discontent; don’t you think? Ungrateful, even.” Tony kept his voice light despite the weight in his chest.
“For the sake of us all,” Tony scrunched up his nose in exaggeration, “Take a shower first.” He gave himself a point when Steve’s face pinch up irritation. He’d begun to make a game out of it, trying his best to get the worst looks he could from Steve, and awarding points when he did.
“Not all of the time, no. Just mostly.” He should have stopped there, but he was awake now—and having too much fun. “Out of the two of us, who graduated from MIT at 15 and earned PhDs in physics, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering when he was 17? When Bruce is around, I wouldn’t make the claim, but you can be damn sure that you still wouldn’t be able to insult my intelligence then, either.”
“Your tech needs to be connected to the server to access Jarvis.” Steve finished, and Tony confirmed with a sad nod. “Okay, I get that.”
“Courtesy of Nat.” The man grimaced, noticing Tony’s lingering gaze. He tilted his chin to the side to give Tony a better look.
Tony didn’t know if his fatigue or the cold was making him hallucinate—it wouldn’t have been the first time—but on top of unnerving stillness, the shop signs didn’t make any sense.
suit is great, of course. But when am I going to get those updates you were telling me about?” Rhodey questioned slyly.
Tony tried to be rational. He’d been lost before and he’d found his way back against all odds. He could do it again.
probably for as long as I plan to work.” He met her grin with his own lazy smirk. “It’s going to be a while, but it’s not hiding.”
Tony didn’t bother telling Steve that the caffeine would have no effect on the super-soldier since his body would process it too quickly, but that would have required a lot of energy to say. He also might have offered to make a drink that could give him an energy boost, but that would have required him to like Steve.
Tony rubbed around his arc reactor, feeling as though a part of him were missing. “He was connected to my sunglasses.”
The guard must have read the disappointment on Tony’s face. “Not to worry,” he said. “Win the game and he’ll grant your wish!”
“And without Rogers, there’s no order or authority or trust. He’s the guy you know you can fall back on, the one who will keep fighting for what he believes in no matter how slim the odds. But he can be blinded by his own views and out of sync with the complexities of it all.” Hill added, thinking out loud.
“Beyond even the Skrulls,” Hill reasoned, intuiting what the men were thinking. “Politicians, spies, back-door deals, black markets, media outpouring—it’s impossible to know where anyone stands and who anyone truly is. The line between right and wrong, good and evil—it’s questionable if there even is one.”
Natasha broke the staring contest and waved an arm around carelessly. “Careful Tony. This whole tower is big and empty enough for one man to get lost in.”
“Well either Fury wanted us to bond over how pointless this was, or you’re horrible at practical jokes, but—”
Steve barreled on: “You put on a suit of iron and think that can somehow change who you are? It doesn’t matter how expensive the suit you wear, you’re still the same war profiteer—”
By that Friday, Tony had lost track of how many hours of sleep he’d gotten—despite it being a frighteningly small number. He was on an autopilot mission to get coffee when he ran into Steve. If he had more energy, he would have blamed Jarvis for not warning him—or maybe Jarvis had told him, but Tony just hadn’t heard him through the fog.

For once, Tony knew Steve’s words weren’t meant as an insult. The soldier was just trying to figure out their situation, and Tony couldn’t blame him.
No matter how much practice he’d had, Tony could never get his carefree smile to hide the violent fire in his eyes. It had gotten him in trouble on more occasions than he’d cared to admit. Fury’s lip twitched as he met Tony’s telling gaze, but he didn’t flinch.
He served Fury a carefree grin, sliding into place against the back wall. He’d followed Natasha to the meeting, but Tony didn’t intend on being a lamb at the slaughter. Fury hadn’t wanted him at this meeting until last minute, and Jarvis was already working to find out why.
Tony stepped closer, seeing what had startled Steve. Where his name had been only moments ago was now a note scrawled in elegant script handwriting.
“I didn’t care about his opinion then, and I sure don’t care about it now.” Tony growled after him. He brushed the mugs into the sink, uncaring if they shattered. The dregs at the bottom dripped like blood down the drain.
He looked every part the nerd: thick-rimmed glasses, a tucked in purple button up, unruly hair and a tweed jacket. It was as if he was doing every-thing he could to make the world forget he was the Hulk.
“Is that a jingle you came up with? The Avenger’s motto, maybe?” Tony scoffed. “Of course you’d agree, Capsicle. Do you even have a home, or do you just live in a laboratory?”
“Did I not just say that I don’t remember anything?” Tony figured leaving out his hallucination of flying in a magical light tunnel was probably for the best now. Steve already looked at him like he was insane. “I swear, it’s like the serum affected everything
His eyes caught on the fireplace blazing at the side of the room. Tony’s feet stumbled over each other as he practically ran to the fire: the cold had reached his bones and his teeth were chattering.
Somehow, Rhodey still managed to find time to call him and chastise him about sleep and eating habits—two things he should have figured out by adulthood, according to him.
Tony rummaged around in his cabinets for the biggest mug he could find, huffing out his impatience since it wasn’t where it was supposed to be. Was it too hard for Clint to put things back exactly where they came from? Shouldn’t that be a fundamental life-or-death skill for assassins?
Tony couldn’t help but smirk. Any man that could put that look of exasperation on Fury’s face was a friend of his. He and Clint would get a long just fine.
Tony stepped aside, nodding to the mirror in the back. For a moment, all he and Tony could do was stare. It really wasn’t fair that someone could look so perfect.
“Don’t worry, I’ll save the whip cream and can openers for when you’re around.” Tony assured him as a goodbye.
The field was a dusty haze of level ground, baking in the New York sun, which had seemed to bleed the color from the grass, turning it to tarnished gold. The ground was swallowed by a forest of evergreen trees in the distance, their presence looming over the field. The field, which was very much empty.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him, “No clue. But I know I want to be inside by nightfall.” His eyes darted around, landing on the hidden pathway the girl had taken.
“What’s new …” Tony grinned as he pictured the amused look of disapproval he imagined was on Rhodey’s face.
If this was some kind of game Fury was playing, he’d kill him. He’d kick them all out of the tower too. It had felt like he was flying—both of them had felt it. Could Fury do such a thing? Tony sure as hell hadn’t given him the tech for it.
The soldier’s eyes hardened and he shook his head. “I don’t care how many degrees you have, if you’re not a decent person.” Steve turned and walked away, leaving his coffee behind. “And no matter how smart you are, Howard would be disappointed.”
“I just don’t understand people like you. How can you be content with your life?” Steve’s voice was pinched, strained with the kind of frustration that’s been bottled up, put on ice, and hidden away for far too long.
What did he want to hear? Did Steve need further confirmation from him that he was self-destructive—whether purposefully or not?
“Damn. What do I have to do to get you to make me a pair?” Clint was trying to whisper but was failing miserably, either because of his purple hearing aids or because he couldn’t contain his excitement. Probably the latter.
Tony looked away from that one quickly. “I think the cold is starting to screw with my vision.” His words came out sounding shaken and far away.
Tony closed his eyes. Maybe he should go to bed—his actual real bed—like Rhodey had told him to. He was a smart guy, that Rhodey, maybe he should listen to him more.
Some days he didn’t make it to the couch and woke up draped over a table or using a faceplate or shin guard as a helmet. It was better this way, Tony told himself. Working himself to exhaustion maximized hours of productivity and fatigue chased away his dreams at night.
“No. I want to win.” Tony was just as surprised as Steve looked to be, honestly. He didn’t quite know what was compelling him to be so bold.
Hi everyone! School has only just started and I'm already dead tired. Hope everyone is doing well, and sorry that I missed a week of posting. This chapter has really heavy influence from Caravel, so, like always, anything that you recognize or think is exceptionally good isn't mine.
Tony swung his arms violently, grappling for anything to cling on to but grasping only air. His stomach hit his throat as the world turned into a blur of color.
Steve slowly removed the lid like he was diffusing a bomb: methodically and carefully, as he did everything. How exhausting was it, to hold back all that raw power all the time?
Coulson spoke first: “Rogers is a better choice than handing the team to a guy who might understand the complexities of the world better, but doesn’t think of the consequences.”
Rhodey didn’t answer right away, most likely on account of the deep voice shouting out commands in the background. A few seconds later his friend told him he had to go. “But try not to get into too much trouble while I’m gone.” Rhodey ordered.
“Tony…” Steve trailed off in exasperated worry, his eyes raking over Tony’s body for injuries and answers, leaving no part untouched. When their eyes met Steve’s latched on to his, looking beneath the skin with troubled blue eyes.
Tony sighed, “Don’t tell me you’ve come all this way just to watch, Rogers? Didn’t we already go over this?”
A towering fortress of golden towers, elegant turrets, balconies and bridges jutted out of the trees, invading the sky. It was easily the most grandiose thing Tony had ever seen—and he’d grown up surrounded by spoiled rich people.
Tony tried not to flinch at Steve’s accurate description. Hearing it from someone else made it seem frighteningly more real. “I’m fine.” he repeated quickly,” trying to assure himself as much as he was Steve. His attempt was seriously undercut by some delayed coughing up of water.
“Don’t bother. I was insulting you.” Tony spelled it out for him, making his way to the coffee machine. “But you messed that up too,” he concluded, muttering to himself. Exhaustion always removed his filters, and he didn’t bother filtering anything when Steve was around anyways.
The problem came when Steve finished the drink and must have felt the obligation to talk. Which was exactly why everyone needed to have oversized coffee mugs, Tony rationalized.
They quickened their pace, passing the most curious shops Tony had ever seen. One shop sold wishes, while another advertised doors that could take you to any place you wanted to go.
Tony found the cup three cabinets down from where it should have been, and turned to make the pot of coffee. He was stopped mid-turn by a mini-panic attack, startled by Steve’s presence at the counter.
“You’re right, I’ve gone too far.” Tony agreed solemnly. Warm laughter crackled through the phone, and Tony drank it in.
Thanks for reading everyone!! While you're waiting for updates, please check out my other work Suspended in Light, or leave a comment and kudos if you like the story.
“You really can’t stand me, can you?” Tony called to Steve “It’s kind of impressive—I’ve never actually had someone this pissed off at me for no apparent reason. I usually give pretty good reasons, too.”
Hi everyone! Its been crazy with midterms, but it is fall break so I am going to write as much as I can — thank you for being patient. There is a welcome to Thrimilici speech here that is taken directly from Caravel, and as usual — almost none of this is mine: the plot, world, characters and more are either Caravel or Marvel's!
He leaned against a tree, resting his head on the sharp bark. Spots swam in front of his eyes and his heartbeat raced.
The shore was a blurry mix of greens and tans, but he could tell it wasn’t too far away. He didn’t move towards it. He wasn’t really there.
Steve stood up, his every move so commanding that space seemed to actively scramble out of his way. The soldiers face was schooled into impassiveness but Tony could sense his surprise, could feel the gears turning in the soldiers mind.
Steve agreed and they set off, reluctantly leaving the warmth of the shop for the night’s chill. The stars hung like jewels in the sky, shimmering brighter than anything Tony had seen before. It was otherworldly, but it brought calmness to his mind.
Steve nodded and they reluctantly left the pristine view, pushing aside leaves and twigs that grabbed at them, seeming to warn them off their journey. Bits of piney needles stuck to their clothes, and Tony’s tired feet sought for grip on the rocky path. Nothing was easy.
“No.” Steve had stood up now and was brushing leaves from his clothes. “Should I remember something? What did you do?”
Tony grinned. “If all it takes is hypothermia for you to ask me to undress, I would’ve cliff dived a lot sooner.”
long time. They had to have been walking for over two hours, neither of them daring to say what they were both thinking: Either they had picked the wrong direction, or Tony was right, and they had much bigger problems than being late for a meeting with Fury.
Science didn’t boast of having all the answers, like Tony so often did. “I don’t know what I’m saying,” he muttered.
I'm not really happy with this chapter, but I wanted to get something up. There will be more action soon, I promise!
Tony and Steve looked at each other, too stunned to speak just yet. Apparently, he had been foolish to think things couldn’t get any more perplexing.
It didn’t surprise anyone that Tony did as Natasha said and went to the Avengers meeting. He and death were always flirting together.
It was just a pair of glasses, sure, but his work was a part of him—and one of the most vulnerable, unfortunately. Pepper always had called his inventions his children, and Pepper was always right.
“If you’re planning to kill me and bury my body out here, I feel like you could have picked a better location.” Steve said, moments after joining Tony. A joke? Who would have thought?
He opted for something less bitter: “Smart guy, huh.” It was a good response, Tony congratulated himself again, it didn’t forward the conversation, but it included nothing angsty or bitter at all.
“That’s what I said.” God, Tony was in some serious trouble. No more going to the gym while Steve was working out. Otherwise he’d have to keep reminding himself that they didn’t like each other.
do? How on earth could this be something I did? You weren’t the only one who woke up not remembering anything!”
“Plans change,” Natasha continued with a well-practiced grin. The sweetness that had first dripped off her voice had dissipated into the empty air.
“That is the less favorable option, yes.” Tony raised an eyebrow, “How do you know that your way won’t get you killed either? You could be walking into a den of aliens who want to eat your brains.”
“Ten points to Gryffindor.” Because, let’s be honest, there was no way the sorting hat would even need to touch Steve’s head to paint him a brave lion.
playing, really. It seemed as though his life was one big game after another, and this was no different. He was just playing for higher stakes now. Tony nodded, “Maybe this Magician guy will help us get home. And out here, what are we going to eat? Where would we sleep? How would we pay for anything? I don’t really see any other options.”
Please leave comments and kudos! If I sound desperate, it's because I am. You should feel sorry for me, and then leave me a comment or kudos to make me feel better!
She answered with a grin, but it wasn’t kind or warm or soft the way grins were supposed to be. It was calculated, the slow teasing way someone curved her lips just before she turned over a winning hand of cards. “How long are you going to stay hidden away in this workshop?”
There was just enough foreboding in her voice that Tony wondered if she was threatening him. He didn’t wish to dwell on it long. “I’d extend an invitation for you to move in, but I don’t want to.” It was one of his weaker insults, but to be fair, he was running on only a few hours of crumpled up sleep.
Tony blew out a frustrated breath. “Yeah, you’re right. I can think of a lot of worse things than getting stuck on an alien planet,
He should have listened to Pepper. He should have abandoned the suits, dismissed the Avengers and gone with Pepper. Why did he have to care about Iron Man so much? Why couldn’t he just have gone with Pepper and accepted that he couldn’t change things that were out of his control.
“I don’t understand.” Steve had whipped out his phone, hoping to prove Tony wrong with a simple phone call and being let down. It was only going to get worse from here.
if I don’t think throwing you narcissistic, chaotic solo-acts together at the last minute, when some maniac decides to threaten our world, is the best idea.”
The suit fit perfectly, as if tailored specifically for him—and it probably was. Gven everything that had happened here, it wouldn’t be surprising. The deep maroon emphasized his dark eyes and gave color to his face. The tail of the coat elongated his torso and gave him the illusion of height which he sorely lacked.
Tony came to a stop almost halfway into the field, brushing off the stickers that had clung to the legs of his pants with his feet.
“I don’t know, Rogers!” Tony threw his hands in the air, “It doesn’t seem too far-fetched that a place where you can buy bottled dreams also has invisible gift-bearing creatures!”
In the following week, he tried to hold on to that feeling, to trap the warmth inside him and the stretch of a smile on his face. In the workshop, it was easy. Anywhere else—when Tony wasn’t cranking away at some piece of machinery—it was almost impossible.
A fog had clouded his mind and vision, washing out the color of the room; his voice seemed farther away than it should have. He needed to get out of there. “Call me if, you know, you need anything else.”
At any moment thoughts of Pepper and her accusations shredded at his heart, while fears of things out of his control snaked around his lungs. He couldn’t build the suits fast enough; he couldn’t fix things completely.
To the right of the table was a man with curly hair. He was folded in on himself, making the large office chair seem to loom over him. Tony couldn’t help but grin.
someone. You know? And he says to me, ‘I mean, I guess. Sure, who doesn’t?’ Nat! God, so you can see where
but I have a feeling you had help.” He carded his fingers through the front of Tony’s hair as he said it, absolutely infatuated with how close they were, how real this was, how good Tony still looked despite the fact that he very clearly had not slept in days.
And Tony can’t believe he’s found him. Or, rather, recognized him, finally, as exactly what he’d hoped at the sky for.
If Tony was surprised by that, he didn’t show it. He simply looked up at her, and then back down at the floor.
But unless he wanted Natasha to make good use of those claws of hers he needed to explain it to someone.
The tom’s expression flickered somewhere towards fondness as Tony’s face lit up in an eager grin, fist pumping in victory before he moved to slide back under the machine. But Luke’s hand, suddenly appearing on his shoulder halted him and Tony looked to him questioningly.
“Well that plan sucked. I –” the hit caught her mid rant and even though her suit absorbed a lot of the energy, there was still enough power behind it to send her toppling backward, right into a burst of webbing that tangled around her like fishing net.
Clint managed to twist enough to land and come up in a practiced roll, not giving his body enough time to really register the sensation of impact or to calibrate injuries before he was on his feet again; which was good because Lava Boy had busted his way through the wall and was stomping toward him with an expression of glee that said he was ready to hand Clint his ass.
love him. That was awesome, and it was all that mattered because he was Ironman, Queen of Pride Avengers, a mother fucking Stark and he was not afraid of winter.
"Ouch woman! Why must you always beat at me so?" Fandral whined and Sif smirked at him. Thor just laughed, for if Fandral had not figured out yet why their Shield Sister was always so sore with him then he never would. Kǫtrdýr had strange ways of showing their affection.
For one moment the light surrounding Tony's hands pulsed so bright that he was blinded and then the energy building there pulsed and shot forward, pushing Tony every faster towards the waiting ground with the force of the emission; but in that moment he could only feel a brilliant sort of elation.
The worst part was there was very little credible research out there about prides, so it was hard to determine what exactly was going to happen. Would Steve's serum enhanced brain eventually heal him or would his symptoms worsen? Unfortunately for Steve he was text subject A in far too many categories.
"I do not speak of your Captain, though you truly are a child if you think him cold to you. I declared him your consort because no one would dare refute me. Only true Prides may participate in the hunt. We make exceptions for our Asgardian hosts. My people would not have made an exception for you."
Tony nodded, relaxing back into his chair, content to let her take the reins of getting the contracts signed. He really could not have put it better himself.
The light in the fog flickered, growing brighter as a room appeared around him. The den of a country home. Familiar.
Ivan narrows his eyes at her and grunts in perfect Spanish that she is a cheat and she’ll charge him fairly if she knows what’s good for her, as a hand slides around his waist and Wanda’s familiar scent fills his nose. It’s spicy like nutmeg with a hint of sweet plums at the edges.
“Guys!” Steve interjected with a frustrated snap. “Can we please focus? What the hell does Clint mean and what does biting you have to do with it?!”
A queens consort should be their balance, and typically they're the one to lead the troops. Fury hadn’t been subtle when he’d thrown them all together and named Steve team captain. What he wants is obvious but you can't just mash people together like puzzle pieces and expect everything to come together how you like.
"I couldn't smell him the same way, before the serum," Steve announced into the blue and Bruce quietly listened, only moving to turn off the heat on the stove once the kettle began to make threatening rattles.
Two years ago Jaime would have had some quick comeback and he probably would have laughed. Today he just got tight lipped, looking way too much like uncle Steve for her comfort as he crossed his arms and stared at her like he could see into her soul.
The tom’s mouth tilted towards a smirk and Tony really wanted to jerk his hand away and hiss for good measure, except that would mean exerting energy and effort and giving up the comfort of his touch. So meh.
Down below her Killian was standing over an operating table and there was someone strapped to it, though Killian was blocking their upper half.
Hughard stares at him a long moment, and when his hand lands on top of Tony’s head he jumps but it just stays there. Tony waits, his heart hammering somewhere low and only sinking lower with each second.
“Our parents are dead.” Tommy snapped back. “And they’re going to be dead much sooner and completely blink us out of existence if we don’t do something.”
Steve loved Bucky too, and wanted to be with him too. What had happened to Barnes wasn’t his fault, and he’d need Steve and all the help he could get if he was ever going to come back from that. That old bond wasn’t just any old bond. It was real love, and Tony couldn’t ask Steve to betray that love and ask not to be betrayed in the same breath.
Tony tapped the side of his neck where a collar might go with a rueful smile and Clint looked away, silently clenching the rubber ball in his hands.
Tony perked up. Blinking away the last vestiges of sleep and reaching unconsciously for Natasha and smiling when her quiet aura flooded his mind. As usual she kept her thoughts carefully to herself, but she could not withhold the essence of herself as her mind reached back for his.
Please. Some part of Tony pleaded. Please what, he wasn’t as sure. Please be willing. Please don’t let him be wrong. Please don’t be like Obie and everyone else he’d trusted.
The fact that Uncle Steve and dad were currently the leading couple of the Pride wasn’t something she found alarming.
They'd not been able to discern a pattern, but Tony was skeptical that it was purely coincidence his brain just so happened to turn into some kind of living computer.
Tony laughed, touched by the words and more relieved than he could say that Steve had come around to Tony's decision to go through with the surgery without the battle that Tony had been expecting. Look at that! Communication. Compromise. Maybe this whole finding a mate thing wasn't as difficult as he'd imagined it was going to be. Look at them go.
Rhodey had been catching them up to date, his frowning face looking out at them from one of the cars many portable screens. “Tony are you sure about what you’re doing?”
All he could think about was Pepper and Happy, and what was going to happen in moments if he couldn't neutralize the situation.
Steve’s not comfortable with it. He gets this look on his face every time he realizes Tony is using Extremis – like he doesn’t quite know who Tony is anymore. As for Tony, he preferred it this way. Less chance of fucking things up the less
He handed it carefully over to Tony, nerves jumping in his stomach and watched as the engineer gave it maybe a second or two of a look before passing it back.
The smaller one (the female if Helen was right) raised a hand in a very familiar stance. Tony didn’t have time to finish crying out a warning as an electro-magnetic pulse shot from her gauntleted palm. Clint was fast though, fast enough to get off a shot before that blast hit him, but their enemy was prepared. The other mercenary jumped in front of his partner and in a shocking burst of red and blue light a shield appeared out of a circular hub on his wrist. Clint’s arrow appeared to incinerate as it attempted to pass through the energy field.
“Pardon?” Steve grunted, not taking his meaning and unable to help the trickle of offense he felt at his old neighborhood being reduced so bluntly to something so inherently negative. Was this about what he'd said at the meeting this morning? Whatever the others thought, Steve hadn't meant it the way it had sounded. Maybe he and Debar should talk about it.
Steve jerked in surprise as Clint came up and clapped him companionably on the back and stuffed down the embarrassment he felt at how obvious his thoughts must have been, trying his best for casual as he went back to what he was doing.
"Tony, we're a Pride." Steve chastised, but unlike so many times before the words didn't carry with them a bitter sting. Maybe it was the damnable lights, still making him look soft and bed rumpled with a dash of holiday glow just to fuck with Tony's emotions. "We wanted to have your back. I don't know much about them but from talking with Luke I get the picture that we'd be a pretty sorry bunch if we just let our Queen risk his life and didn't try and help him. And even if none of that were true, we're your friends. You have a problem, then we'll tackle it. Together."
“We drew him out. I couldn’t see much, but he was there Steve. Now we know a little more what to expect and we’ll be better prepared next time.”
“You’re an A student. You’ve been pre-accepted into Midtown Science Academy next year. How smart do you think you have to be?” Tony interrupted his jumbled thoughts and Peter gaped at him. He was beginning to realize that something very weird was going on. Mr. Stark knew too much about him, and had just admitted to inviting Peter here even though he knew he’d never applied.
Howard’s notarized recognition that yes he had impregnated Tony’s mother, and by golly that might just make Tony his child, didn’t grant Tony the full rights of a human being but it made Tony Howard’s son in the eyes of the law; which meant that technically Howard could leave him control of the company.
Steve opened his mouth to suggest that maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad idea for Jena and the kit to leave until Tony was through the worst of it, but at that moment a strange prickling at the back of his neck captured his attention.
She’s right, he realizes slowly. Tony had been unprepared for the furnace. Even just that small glimpse of the soldier’s birth had been a shock to him.  Which meant that someone else must have brought them to that place. That memory.
They went through a couple of the simulations that Tony had programed and when Clint still looked like he had a few rounds left in him, Steve took him through his paces.
The name of the one who came before Ivan is on the tip of his tongue. Scratching at his mind like an itch. When he remembers the name of the ghost who lives inside of him he wonders what it will change. It’s an insatiable curiosity that he shouldn’t have. He covets it all the more for that.
“I’ve known the Osbornes a long time.” Tony informed him conversationally, swishing his long beautiful tail lazily behind him. “There probably aren’t a lot of people left that remember your Grandfather Nathan Parker used to work for old Alton Osborne as a driver, or hearing of a scandal involving Alton’s son Amberson cheating on his wife with some woman who nobody ever learned the identity of.”
“Don’t misunderstand me Captain Rogers," the tom continued diplomatically. "Your past is important and Tony would no doubt be touched by your willingness to share it, but you would be wise not to forget that Tony is a man of the future. If he is anything like the Queen’s of old, in his blood is the desire for the kingdom of tomorrow. If you are to stand at his side your heart can not belong to yesterday.”
“Well let’s have a look here,” Phil made a humming sound of consideration, reaching for the chart hanging beside the bed and Clint groaned, rolling his eyes. He already knew where this was headed but he let Phil play it out.
Officially Pepper is still Tony's guardian (she refuses the term parent even though he likes to tease her with mom) because Tony wasn't about to give up his hard earned freedoms to become Fury's personal kitty; but Coulson is okay. As far as handlers go.
And when Barnes made an unexpected recovery the Rogers had been allowed to take their new kitty home with them, which allowed everyone to feel better about the fact that dozens of kits had been killed in the name of progress, and for the government to know just where to find Barnes should they decide to pick up the experiment again.
"The Alurio are not slaves. When my uncle told me about the Pride Initiative I had to see it for myself. I knew that America was too cowardly to ever bring back true Alurio."
The bullets pinged off the shield, doing nothing at all to scratch either the blue rings or the strange star painted in its center.
Tony winces as he rolls so that Jarvis can reach the welts on his left side and takes another big bite of his pastry. The tart flavor of the apples burn the cut on his lip but the buttery sweet crust is a welcome distraction from the pain in his body.
“What’s going on?” Steve voiced aloud and Tony shrugged already reaching within his suit jacket for his phone.
Thor's companions had been given rooms near his in the north tower of the citadel, where they could look out over the great city and the plains of Iðavöllr beyond it.
“That’s sweet. Impractical but sweet. Helen and the doc would probably prefer not having to climb over a snarly overprotective tom-hybrid.” Tony wrinkled his nose, whiskers twitching with distaste. “We’ve got to come up with a better classification for you Cap. That makes you sound like a science experiment.”
Probably a very nice one, but Tony shouldn’t be entertaining thoughts like that when he was happy and settled and Steve would be so very far from okay with it.
“Oh thank fuck. Jus’ give me a minute.” Tony all but moaned as he fell against the car sticking his head inside the open window and as close to the vents as he could reach on the tip-toes of his feet. Again, who gave a fuck about dignity when it was this hot. When he got back to New York he was going to kill Rhodey.
He blinked away the betraying prick of tears, recognizing the new hands on his shoulders as belonging to Bruce which was the only reason he didn’t hiss and spit and try and claw at him like he had the others.
“I can think of some worse ways to die.” Steve said with a dry laugh, pulling away from their embrace with a purposeful step. Tony could tell by the look on his face alone that the ‘Captain’ was back, and ready to throw everything he had in the hunt for Winter Soldier. He told himself not to give into the feeling of trepidation stirring in his gut.
Stone released his grip on Tony’s hair and straitened up, the bitter whiff of fight scent dissipating with the smoothening of his expression so quickly she was tempted to think she'd imagined it.
“Not because women are seen as inferior, but because only a male heir will be able to spawn children with the next Queen of the Panther Pride, that about right?” Tony added and this time T’Challa narrowed his eyes at him suspiciously.
So its been a shitty two weeks, but I enjoyed so much of writing that. Especially my boys together *pinches their cheeks* But please tell me what you thought and distract me from how shitty next week is already shaping up to be. I wish I had six cats to snuggle with lol.
“Tony, kitten, be reasonable. You have to give me something to go on here other than private island.” Darren clicked his tongue in exasperation in the face of Tony’s disapproval. The files that Pepper had given him were spread open on the table before them in conjunction with the halo-screen displays that Darren had come prepared with. None of the properties that the broker had shown him had seemed right so far.
back in New York where it isn’t one hundred degrees out, probably sipping champagne by the poolside.
.” She insisted, clutching her tablet tightly for a moment before she seemed to realize how intense she was being and forced herself to relax with a deep breath.
“You should have trusted us. It was a trap Tony.” He thought he heard her murmur, somebody was purring pretty loudly so it was hard to hear.
They’re a small kit, small even for their age and the man who is father (but isn’t) takes their blood and says their veins would be easier to find if (he) weren’t such a runt.
Along with the heavy sense of distress, he kept getting flashes of images seeped in intense thoughts and emotions; a startling change from the last few weeks. Since Barnes had seemingly figured out that Tony wasn’t the only one with power when they linked up, it had become harder for Tony to get inside his head. The soldier’s mental barriers were stronger, his defenses sharper, and Barnes was quick to lash out (violently) the minute he suspected Tony was trying to get past them. It had slowed down the progress of their search, but Tony might have kept pushing anyway if not for Natasha and Steve’s obvious worry, and well, everything else he had going on.
Tony carried his steaming cup of coffee back to the table where a full report and the small silver disk SHIELD had found amidst the rubble at ViXon waited.
“We’re different.” Tony shook as if Steve had said something to contradict him. “You know that I can’t replace him right? Sure, maybe some things are similar and maybe for a little bit it will seem like enough. I think I’m selfish enough to even let you… but eventually you’re going to get frustrated because I forgot it was your birthday, or I didn’t consult you before I did something I thought was necessary and you’re going to hate that you’re stuck with me. Just me. So what I need…”
Not that it mattered. They weren’t going anywhere. As quickly as she could Natasha had braced the door by pushing a heavy table laden with boxes against it.
Steve considered what she'd said, wondering if it was really true that he might never really know all there was to know about Tony, that Tony would always be doing something to sabotage the trust they'd built because Tony would always be trying to throw himself away.
"My Nonna and Nonno are Jews.” He admits for the first time to someone else, though he gets the feeling that Jarvis already knows. “So is uncle Isiah. Mama was one, but she converted. Only it doesn't seem to matter very much. Uncle Obi thinks people like Herr Vonkov would lose respect for Stark Industries if they knew we were related to Jews and he's right. People don’t like them."
“Thank you Tony. But you’re wrong, about Harley.” She began, placing a hand on the door to hold if from closing. “Someone told him a long time ago he could be more. He’s wanted to be Iron man since he was seven.”
He's Tony fucking Stark, Queen of Pride Avengers. It's stamped on the fucking paperwork and everything and yeah, maybe he wasn't so keen on it before but now that he is, they're going to learn what that means. Every last one of them. They're going to regret the day they ever thought of handing him their broken crown. They don't know it but he's going to crush their empire and build his own from their bones.
“Got it in one.” Tony raised his mug to him in toast and the kit pumped his fist in the air in victory. Steve was wearing a particularly hang dog look that Tony suspected was half bullshit, but he was a sucker so he sighed and said, “A very hot slug. The hottest. Not at all family friendly. Not all that plushy either. You need stuffing. I volunteer as tribute.”
"Robert." Tony ignored Ty altogether to greet the tom's guardian, whose mouth twisted with irritation at being addressed so informally by a kat before he could school his expression.
That needed to stop, he berated himself. The island was too important and he’d be damned if he lost it because he couldn’t get over a bruised ego.
Tony was close to his heat and the closer it got the more obvious the signs became; which for the residents of the tower (Bruce and Clint especially as the only toms he trusted to see him through heat) usually meant dealing with a lot of hormonal behavior.
“Bond with me, tonight.” Tony repeated, pressing up against his solid warmth. He rubbed his cheek against Steve’s shoulder and purred, loving the way his whole body lit up from the friction. Loving the way Steve smelled, all strong and willing and
New plan. Flying underneath the bridge Tony quickly eyed the metal support beams that held the entire structure up. He’d designed this course so he knew the general layout  of all the platforms and function of all the mechanisms that helped to slide them in place. He wasn’t looking to completely wreck the gym or cause the floor to collapse into the one below, but the safest way possible to destabilize it.
The reason Tony’s money in the right pockets had been enough before was because it wasn’t a popular viewpoint with the majority. Most of them even if they didn’t support Gata rights, liked to think of themselves as benevolent caregivers, and of their charges as something close to grateful children. Higher thinking to be certain, but never equal to them. Trask and the Oversight Bill had been too extreme, too harsh for their sensibilities.
He was having trouble shaking last night’s dream. They were more memory than dream and they were coming almost nightly now that Tony had gotten inside Bucky’s head. Steve wasn’t a scientist or a psychic expert so he couldn’t really explain how he knew, but whatever had kept Bucky’s mind quiet all these years was peeling away, slowly but steadily. It wasn’t a surprise anymore to close his eyes at night and find himself pulled into some memory – impossible to tell whether the dream started with him or with Bucky. Steve always let them play out the way he remembered. He’d seen what happened when Tony woke the Winter Soldier too many times to risk Bucky realizing the dream wasn’t normal.
“I liked the part about the elves in the chopper.” Stripes rebutted. “It makes sense that Santa would need a strike team.”
Of course Tony's parents had warned him away from such 'wicked' establishments, but Tony knew by now that half the negativity was really just to put pressure on interspecies unions. But still. Pepper really would bite him a new asshole if he was photographed in a kennel club again without warning her.
The Greeks first record encountering them in Egypt though there were similar pockets of civilizations developing alongside them in Asia.
“What because he’s a fel?” Nyota growled, bristling at the implication that Amory, even though he was naturally shy and quiet, wasn’t just as capable as any of the others. “He did awesome helping us with the portal device and before you forget, it was him who got the machine running when I wigged out and Riri had to keep me from clobbering you.”
She and Pietro are not the first he has personally picked for training. Strucker has always been clear about lines, about who the master is. Ivan is just a shirt he gets to wear when it is convenient for his masters. The soldier is an asset. Nothing more and nothing less, and it is efficient that they work with his nature and not against.
Tony beams because Rhodey doesn't tell him he talks too much (well not at first, but later it's with love so he's allowed) or to stop prattling on about silly nothings the way that Hughard does. He listens, and Tony does not know a single person even close to his own age who will listen to him.
It was there, simmering under layers of discontent and growing anger: the bitter beginnings of fight scent.
“Dr. Banner has been searching for a cure to his condition for over a decade, Madame.” Cho stated as a matter of fact, but Tony heard the admonishment in her tone.
“It is common for our people to experience short comas after severe injury.” He explained as the doors locked shut behind him, compressing the air in the room once more. “It gives our minds a chance to heal and to focus on healing the body.”
When Jarvis had initially contacted Jena Keener to inform her that her son was safe and being watched over by the Avengers she’d been frantic, but probably less so than she would have been if she’d caught the news story featuring her mother screaming into a microphone and visceral footage of the carnage outside her home first. She’d seemed torn between relief and alarm that the Avengers had taken him out of state without permission but Tony could hardly have left the kit in the middle of all that and frankly, he hadn’t trusted the elderly Mrs. Keener not to make good on her threats.
“Was last night the first time you’ve gone into a rutt?” he asked gently, lowering his voice despite the fact that everybody present had super hearing and would hear it anyway. “You didn’t seem all that surprised by the urge to sink your teeth into the back of my neck.”
“Fan out. Clint head east, Natasha upstairs, I’ll take the back way. Evacuate any civilians. Signal as soon as you locate Tony.” Steve instructed before darting off down the hall and Clint nodded briefly to Natasha before trotting off as well, wishing that his gas mask didn’t take his whiskers out of use. He wondered how Tony could be so comfortable in the armor. Clint hated fighting without the use of all his senses, and would rather go into battle stark naked than with his natural assets confined.
And there it was. Confirmation of what he’d already suspected. T’Challa hadn’t taken seduction off the table as a negotiation tactic. What was it he’d said?
“Honestly Darren I know it’s crazy. A free state ruled by Gata yeah right?” he swallowed through the tightness in his throat and clenched his fists under the table.
Pepper was anxious, but she was always going to be anxious about Tony going on the table. It didn’t help that the medical professional most familiar with the squishy bits of science had suddenly been dropped from the endeavor upon Tony’s discovery that he wasn’t who he said he was; but Pepper understood why it was important for him to trust the people in his inner circle. There was a small bit of gratification in watching her be as pissed as he was that Fury had pulled a stunt like this. The one-eyed bastard deserved every bit of hell Pepper could throw at him and Potts had a mean punch.
Tony could tell that Steve and Natasha were unsettled by his request for them to stay behind. With Steve it was easy. He let Tony see his concern, and the stiff way he held his back was a more private tell for anyone who had spent any great length of time around him to catalogue.
“Because they are the ambassadors and protectors of the future and thus beloved by all. Queen-Fels are seventy percent more likely to occur in lines started by other Queen-Fels and as Dora Milaje they are only free to mate where the Queen wills. Aranged marriages may seem antiquated to your western sensibilities, but political unions of this sort are a necessary function of maintaining balance and prosperity among the tribes. Thus when the young toms are selected by the leaders of their tribes, they go to my mother’s court in the Golden City with the understanding that they carry the hopes of the future with them.”
But that was a journey for later. The three of them were going to survive, and that meant for a little while longer at least the only thing he had to follow was orders.
Firstly, something must be done about this virus. Secondly, something must be done to balance the team. The Pride would fail if its two key components remained at such volatile odds.
Which explained why the morning of the twenty-fourth found Tony up at seven in the morning, freshly showered, nursing his third cup of coffee, eyeing Steve Rogers critically as the man in question buckled on a pair of authentic reindeer hide boots, his mouth frowning as his hands examined their gold buckles.
“Stop brooding, Lady McBroody.” Riri jostled her rudely with her shoulder and Nyota stuck her tongue out at the dark-skinned she-tom. Wilson was a pain in the ass but she’d been Nyota’s best (girl) friend for most of their lives. They looked similar enough they could have passed as sisters. Riri was actually younger than Nyota by two years but smarter than just about anybody that Nyota knew, and that was saying something because Nyota was the daughter of two geniuses. She wasn’t a slouch in the brains department either, but she’d never taken to mathematics and engineering the way her dad might have liked. Their parents used to laugh about the irony of Tony Stark getting an athlete for a daughter and Riri’s super sporty parents giving birth to an even bigger nerd than Tony.
“Well damn. Okay, easy fix.” Riri let out a long breath. “The SHIELD team is hunting us right? So we just got to lead them to Washington and make sure Steve’s in the right place at the wrong time. Just like before.”
Perhaps it was just a consciousness. The little duckling who kept his eyes open while his brothers slept chanting to the witches at his door.
Up ahead a woman emerges from a corridor, her pearl white hair swishing across her bared shoulders, striped ears twitching as her eyes scan the hall.
If the guy was offended he didn’t say so, which was just fine with Tony because again, stranger, and Tony had no idea why he’d helped either now or back at the warehouse and what he wanted. He could very well have turned around and decided to take up where Killian had left off.
Wasn't no use in any of them going hungry when offering the kit out for his heat could bring enough mint for a month of groceries.
Tony was still gasping in shock as Natasha grasped the metal chain of one of the restraints sharply ordered for him to keep still and slashed through the chain like she was cutting string, the vibranium (Tony would know that particular song anywhere) singing as it cut through the steel.
“I like your bikini.” Natasha returned with a sly smirk as she tackled her back, jabbing the other woman with her widow-bites on her open skin. Nakia jerked and hissed in pain, heaving with an impressive show of strength until they’d both tipped over and were in danger of rolling off the bridge. Natasha abandoned her hold on the woman when she was stung by a bolt from Nakia’s energy blade. A moment later both women were back on their feet and at it again.
Tony wanted to snap at him to stop calling them kits already, as if Tony wasn't running the company that had left his in the dust, as if Natasha couldn't kill him without staining her gown, and they all hadn't made a commitment to put themselves between destruction and his sorry ass.
“They’re not soldiers.” Steve, who was standing to Tony’s right, declared with certainty.  “The boy with the pistol is a great shot, but he hesitates. It’s just a fraction, but it’s the kind of rookie mistake a soldier is trained out of.”
“Do you have any idea how creepy it is when you do that?” Tony heard Clint mutter under his breath and Natasha shushed him.
They forget how to sleep unless it’s pressed against a warm body and there are so many bodies in and out of their bed Obie jokes they should install a revolving door.
It was a god damn mess down there. You couldn’t even walk around without a collar stating your name, your owner and basically your business for doing anything besides rolling over in somebody’s bed or playing fetch. They’d figured that out the hard way their first attempt at touching ground when someone had noticed they were without tags within twenty minutes and suddenly they were being chased by animal control.
Tony flinched, irritated at himself and irritated at the silly woman for thinking he’d do something like that. He was used to just being himself and knowing that Pepper and the others could handle it, but things were different now. He was building a Pride and he’d brought these people to live in his tower and work in his new company so that they could be a part of that. He knew better than anyone how timid and sensitive to rebuke domesticated kats could be.
And the thing about Natasha was that even when she was delivering dire omens worthy of a mystic, and even if the KGB had plucked her whiskers in the name of super-spy-dom, she still flicked her eyes over her shoulder in a warning glance and murmured "watch your six" out the side of her mouth, before Tony could even fathom there was a danger.
“But things went south during the recession and Daddy had to sell a lot. The one thing he couldn’t sell was his prize kitten and her kit, and after his mother died well I guess Scotty just felt like he couldn’t abandon Daddy. So we stayed. My mother was furious when she found out I was pregnant with Scotty. She accused him of forcing me. But it wasn’t force and I made sure Daddy knew that, but Daddy… I don’t think he would have believed that anyway. He was disappointed, but he never treated Harley poorly… even when all the neighbors talked and called us the worst names. He loved my son.”
"That's your uncle Isiah." Mama answers and her voice is stressed with hope and fear, but she doesn't move. "My brother."
“No!” Above, Steve was still resisting as feet pounded on the planks, the loosened fastening bolts rattling and causing the bridge to moan like an old woman in pain.
"The most public.” Tony affirmed cheerfully. “I want you to sing your shock and dismay from the rooftops. "
He was having a hard time just keeping up with the kid tugging on the coat of his costume, asking the millionth question about all the bad guys he'd fought and if he could see the shield.
“Why wouldn’t he be calm?” Pietro appeared on his right, a costume headband with a fuzzy pair of cat ears attached. The price tag was still attached. “It’s a simple snatch and grab. We could do this in our sleep.”
And that's how Tony makes his first friend, but his heart is sinking because he knows Hughard will never allow it. He'll send Rhodey away and Rhodey will either end up in prison for stealing food, starved to death, or getting on a ship to somewhere else. None of which Tony finds acceptable.
Which led him to eyeing Luke with new speculation. There had been four children in his dream and only two of them easily identified. Jaime had been spoken for, and it was a safe enough guess that Natasha had a hand in the little redhead Tony had been holding- though Tony for the life of him couldn't imagine what kind of a tom could steal her heart, because the poor bastard who had previously fit the bill was long dead, and not the sort to fit in such a domestic scene as that had been in the first place – which left the shy little boy and the little girl Tony had called Nyota in the dream.
So Tony, like a good genius, had done something about it, working in his lab without sleep until the solution had finally presented itself (in the form of Thor playing some silly game with DUMMY) because sitting on the bench wasn't an option; but Steve had tried to take him off the roster anyway.
“You don’t know the right kats.” Princess replied primly, drawing the woman’s attention. Some people would have been affronted at a kat addressing a human before they’d been directly asked to speak, but Sonia just blinked at the girl, emotions concealed behind a mask smooth as glass.
The room had gone deathly quiet as Tony's words resonated with his listeners and Steve swallowed back the lump that was forming in his throat. He’d never heard Tony sound so impassioned or look so dangerous as he looked just then. There was a wildness in his expression, in his scent, that had every hair on Steve’s body raising.
“I’m smart. Listen, Harley,” Tony knelt down until he and the half-pint were eye to eye. “My friend here really needs to get warm and I need to get her to a doctor and me to a lab. There are some very bad people chasing us so we’re low on time here. I need those supplies. You help me get them and I promise you won’t have to sleep in the barn anymore.”
“You could really get your Gata on and piss around him in a circle Cap. It’s primitive but probably still effective.”
Tony was still trying to use Extremis as little as possible and not to put undue stress on his system that would trigger the virus. The reduction in activity not only ensured that he didn’t break down before they could perform nanobot surgery, it also seemed to have reduced the number of heat surges he was having. But desperate times called for desperate measures and all that.
If he wanted this, they’d do it. And he wished he was strong enough to walk away from it. But he wasn't. Not even for her.
“But I’m happy we can expect to see Donny again. Doing business with your son is always a pleasure.”
M.O.D.O.K.'s fragile little body was heavily armored however and thus very well protected. But Tony had a few surprises left up his own sleeves yet.
The world around them shifts at his whim and only gets unsteady when the soldier distracts him with a fight.
The serious line of T’Challa’s mouth twitched, though it was hard to tell if it was toward amusement or irritation.
Tony called Steve a worry wart, but asked JARVIS to allow audio between the room and the hall and had talked to Harley through the intercom while the boy had pressed his face up against the (not) glass and drank him in with his eyes.
Okay. Tony swallowed thickly, trying desperately to reign himself in. So this wasn't rocket science. Tony’s body is dropping him into heat and when he isn’t hot, achy, and getting irritated at every foreign smell that wafts past his nose, he’s pretty much thinking about these fluffy little balls of snot and curiosity that some people call children.
"This is strange to me," Thor was the one with the guts to say, face setting into a pensive frown. "The Benu are held as sacred among the Kǫtrdýr."
Tony was waving his hand expansively as he reiterated, “but what are they doing all over my tower? And why are there six dozen empty boxes of popsicles in the living room?”
Something about fools rushing in... Appropriate really. Tony felt like a fool. The biggest of fools, staring into the eyes of someone too beautiful to be real, to good to ever be his, and just letting himself slide deeper and deeper, their bodies swaying closer together.
Tony had expected her to put up more of a fight about dressing up, but she’d been surprisingly game for the whole affair. Granted she’d insisted on coming up with her own attire and had threatened to disembowel him if he argued, but never let it be said that Tony didn’t know how to pick his battles.
T’Challa’s smooth voice broke through the fog in his head and Tony blinked up at the tom who had come to stand beside the bed, opposite of Bruce. T’Challa left a good half a foot between them, as if sensing Tony’s skittishness, but his scent still filled Tony’s nose and his fingers curled tightly into the blanket covering his legs.
“Hey kid, look at me.” Tony’s soft voice entreated, and Peter looked up, biting back the urge to cry.
It was nice to think of his dad and Master Osborne goofing off and getting into trouble just like he and Harry did.
Well they were going to fix things. They were going to go down there and get their parents and teleport the hell out of here before the incursion and then Nyota was going to probably scream at them for a good hour or two for lying to her. They hadn’t been fine. They hadn’t caught up. They weren’t ever coming back (unless she came and got them) because they’d stayed behind on a sinking ship like perfect idiots.
JARVIS’ tone was notably colder than usual, which Steve took as his just deserts. When he put in his accesses code he almost expected it to be rejected but the doors slid open seamlessly without a sound.
“I wasn’t aware I was housing a tower full of uncivilized heathens who haven’t learned more hygienic ways to scent mark.” Tony prattled on. “You’re absolutely right Cap. Pee anywhere near my beautiful creations and my wrath will be quick and merciless.”
A beloved pet turned magnum opus is the most charitable description he could manage if he were at all interested in being charitable; but fuck charity. And fuck Howard Stark.
“Good afternoon everyone,” She addressed the room at large before rounding in on Tony with narrowed eyes, thrusting a freshly laundered suit still wrapped in plastic into his arms. “Darren will be here in five minutes and Miss Keener will be up here at three with Harley. And while I’ve been up since early morning dealing with the legal team, the Board and the Broker, the least you could do is be dressed when he arrives.”
"Only if it actually works." Bruce responded wryly with a fond smile. "It's just check. It's not checkmate till it's over."
Rather dangerously, Tony liked the way T’Challa was looking at him now even more, the tom’s focus intent and heated almost like he was on the edge of fight, only there was no sharp pepper in Tony’s nose, just the beguiling scent notes that came with attraction. Just biology Tony reminded himself. Just a toms way of entreating a fel to come closer. Nothing more to it.
"Whether you bond us or not wont make any difference to me but it matters to Clint." She said after a long moment, her voice roughened by some emotion that Tony would have called pleading on anyone else. The widow never begged. But she did manipulate.
So Tony loves challenges, but unsolved mysteries chafe at him and the mystery behind Ivan, the assassin they call the Winter Soldier, is itchier than most.
was. Well, it was nicer than Tony had expected. He’d expected a long cold night alone with his fears and his dread of the morning.
“Tony?” Steve gently brushed his fingers against the edge of Tony’s mouth and it was only then that he realized how twisted up with anxiousness his face must look, if the tightness of his facial muscles was anything to go by. Steve’s touch was soothing, and Tony didn’t mind leaning into it as he forced himself to relax.
The morning is beautiful so people stop and remark on it. They smell roses. They argue over nothing as if they have all the time in the world and then they laugh like old friends, wasting more time reminiscing. There is music pouring out of the open doors of a café and a man is singing as he sweeps. A woman is rushing to greet her friend with open arms brightly exclaiming and waving, "Buongiorno!"
Bruce paused, not because he agreed with Tony that it was a show worth flicking back to, but because Tony's nails were digging rather threateningly into the soft flesh of his wrist.
She tensed, reminded of the doctor scheduled to come every couple of days for home care and the tom who assisted him.  She didn't like unanswered questions, and Luke Debar was definitely an unknown, his presence an anomaly and his sudden appearance within their carefully maintained social bubble suspicious. More tellingly his SHIELD file was thin.
"The Avengers aren't slaves either Luke." Phil spoke up, drawing the eyes of both toms. "They are under SHIELD supervision but they have been granted the freedom to form a pride body and to govern themselves accordingly. There is preliminary talk of providing them with political immunity but more would have to be observed of pride function and dynamics for the World Security Council to even consider granting something like that without precedent."
When Thor had shown up with Harley not even pretending like he was there for any other reason but to see Friend Tony, Steve had nearly blown a fuse because Harley was ten, and did Thor have any idea what a risk this was?!
“These are mighty volstag. Very fierce and noble creatures Tony. How your Midgardian historians confused them for goats I do not know.” Thor shook his head sadly, inwardly amused at the perplexed way that Tony continued to stare around the hall at the walls decked in evergreen, tinsel, and a delightful assortment of ornaments that included Thor’s, and the handmade ones Harley had spent the afternoon constructing out of old popsicle sticks and pipe cleaning devices.
"It's no wonder Fischer's got everybody thinking you're a trouble maker, name sounds as foreign as snow in July. What you need is a solid name, a good Christian name, one that isn't going to make people nervous. See?"
“I am?” she scoffed with a bright little laugh, like he was a child who'd said something ludicrous but endearing.
“How did you know I was there?” He questions with a pout and father reaches to tug playfully on his ear.
He was good with physical. Comfortable. He didn’t always know the right thing to say but how you felt didn’t always have to depend on words. Sometimes it was better that it didn’t.
“How long was I out?” Tony asked fumbling for the bed rails as he attempted to sit up. The tom immediately rushed to help, placing hands gently upon his back and stomach for support. Tony hated waking up and not having Jarvis there to orient him. What day was it even? Why were Bruce’s thoughts still screaming so loudly in his head and what the hell was he doing down here?
“I say that out loud?” Tony wondered, brow furrowing speculatively as he realized that T’Challa had answered his thoughts. The tom shook his head minutely.
"That was some pretty heavy flirting," Bruce murmured, eyes tracking over him as if he were looking for clues to a riddle. "I'm so used to you just being you, I completely forgot what it looks like when you're actually interested."
“Not helpful Clint. Steve and I are adults, and everything we engaged in last night was consensual. Every last bit. You want a play by play?”
“Doesn’t that imply that tom-kats aren’t people though?” Steve questioned with an arched brow and a smile tugging at his mouth and Tony laughed.
And kits. Tony’s imagination supplied, his gut twisting with longing. Beautiful girls with Natasha’s red hair, and a bunch of wiry little imps with Clint’s energy scratching up his floors and ruining his rugs with their untrimmed nails.
“Those guys weren’t our parents Anya,” Jamie reminded her. “If we change too much about the past here we risk changing the future. We could accidently make it so we were never born.”
Maybe something enough to survive that fall from the train. Something enough for the soviets to work off of, turning him into the kind of weapon Tony’s father had tried and failed to turn him into.
How easily he could find himself alone again, in another Afghanistan, getting fucked over, and maybe next time he won’t make it out. Maybe they’ll eventually find the grounds to take him from Pepper, or god forbid it’ll be her home under attack next time and he’ll be too late to save her.
small. They’re him (Tony) and they’re curled up with their mother in the soft kitten bed. She smells like jasmine. She has a locket on a golden chain that they love to play with. It’s shiny, and the gem in the center catches the light in a distracting way.
