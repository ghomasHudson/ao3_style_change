"It's good, that; you all needed it" says Bucky, somberly, "I'm sorry for ditching you, especially just as everything was falling apart"
"Yeah, yeah; sorry, just grazed my ankle the other day" This much was true; Steve had scraped it against the side of the wall he'd climbed last week trying to get away from those thugs.
Outside, Steve quickly adjusts his grip on the bag handles before beginning to trudge his way back to the apartment.
She abandoned the thought, and continued to check carefully through every nook and cranny with a practised eye.
"Jesus Christ, when we get home I'm gonna leave a special present on Clint's pillow" He said once reaching them; he rested his hands on his knees and bent down to catch his breath "And, newsflash; it's not gonna be a hotel issues mint"
coffee, he only knew drinking it. Either way, they couldn't risk being seen leaving with anything they hadn't entered with, and this find was too valuable to sacrifice.
"Split up" Steve yelled, as they saw two large thugs at the mouth of the alley in front of them, both holding knives and with mean looks on their faces.
They fall into an easy step, as though it hadn't been two and a half long years of being apart, and Steve tries to resist the excited laugh he's so close to releasing. It's
"Now we just have to wait for Thor" Steve said, adjusting the straps on his backpack to sit more tightly against him, "And then we can get Clint to bring the van around"
"I'm just saying, if Tony's tech was a bit more improved, I probably would've noticed them on the monitors quicker!"
Tony is next, and is more clumsy, but he makes it out with a good amount of ease considering he has the coffee maker under his arm.
“No karaoke” was his only objection. How could Stephen say no? Tony asked him directly. He planned on just going back to the Sanctum. He might be an Avenger but he didn’t live at the tower, even if he technically had a room there.
No. It wasn’t entirely true. He wasn’t alone. There was someone there. Maybe something was a better word. The sorcerer supreme had many creatures living in his Sanctum. But there was one particular, one he should’ve gotten rid off months ago... but couldn’t. They called it the despair, a fitting name. That was the only thing he could feel whenever he was back, ‘home’. He felt the despair close by. From the corner of his eye he could see it- him...creep up behind him like a shadow. It tried a multiple different forms since it infected Stephen’s mind. Donna, Wong, Clea and at last Tony. It was his preferred shape. He knew it was not the real deal. It was always something slight off. The shade of his blue eyes were off, or his the way he smiled. Tony would never look that diabolic when he smiled. The slight prospect of maybe having a sexual relationship with Carol disappeared almost as quickly as if had arrived. It didn’t matter if they were both blanks. It would end terribly as all his other relationships.
Despair smirked, his body leaning closer. It was wrong. A voice, a very weak one protested. Taking a deep breath, he knew exactly what would happen next. Their lips met, but instead of the ecstatic and intoxicating feeling of being kissed, he felt his life being sucked out of him. Slowly the sanctum disappeared from his field of vision. All he could see was darkness. Black tendrils curled around his body, as a pathetic parody of romance. They captivated him, engulfed him in darkness. He couldn’t move. Couldn’t breath. The tendrils of black smoke slipped through the corner of his mouth, slowly creeping down his throat. Filling him up, and suffocating him. His eyes felt damp, was he screaming? He didn’t even know. If he could he would curl up in the darkness until it was all over. But he was forced to stand there. The black smoke kept him in place as Despair ate his essence. He was sure he would kill him. How many times could the creature kill him by now? He lost count. What had Despair said.
Their first kiss had been drawn out and awkward. Despite it all, not even close the worst kiss the playboy had participated in. He knew that he’d been lusting after Rogers for a while. It wasn’t the first time he wanted to kiss a man. He’d kissed plenty of men, men were very kissable and sometimes even better to kiss than the women he would lock lips with. So the fact that his teammate had a Y chromosome wasn’t the issue. Steve was from a time where homosexuality was seen as a disease. Men were thrown into prison for kissing other men, beaten in allies for the person they wanted to share a life with. Women didn’t really have it any better. Even if Steve liked men, he was bound to resent that part of him as if it was tainting his American values. He’d no idea of Rogers stands on same sex relationships, people kept telling him to ease Steve into it.
It was the soft pair of lips against his cheek that woke the soldier. The kiss was sloppy and a bit lazy in nature. Stark look like he was about to fall over and spent the rest of his life sleeping. His eyes were barley open, hair standing in every direction. Not even close to the perfection the tabloids was used to see it in. Honestly, this was his favorite way to see his boyfriend. This was all his, only he was allowed to see the prideful man like this.
They shouldn’t be doing this. It was wrong on so many levels. He was Tony Stark. The billionaire that fucked up every relationship he ever had. He knew he took people for granted, never gave them the attention they needed and expected them devote all their time to him. He was a selfish mess. An alcoholic, manipulative and a liar… and Steve deserved so much better than him. But most importantly, Steve had a girlfriend. A girlfriend who cared about him. She was a beautiful and intelligent woman, clearly competent at her job. They were happy together and Tony was ruining everything they had. Yet, he couldn’t stop kissing the passionate man. His fingers trailed over his firm body, it was pure perfection and he couldn’t help but to marvel at it.
The crude noise of was probably an AC/DC song, or some other band, made them stop. He noticed Tony just turning off the horrendous sound and was about to go right back and kissing the soldier. Steve however leaned away. If they stared kissing again he would carry Tony back to the bedroom and then he would be even later to his meeting. Or miss it completely. Honesty, he wasn’t even ashamed of keeping Stark to himself, he hated sharing the smaller man.
He sounded hesitant as he spoke. Unsure as if he was figuring out if he was overstepping his boundaries. Their relationship was new, and they hadn’t quite settled down. They were both a bit unsure about what they stood, and what was acceptable. They were exclusive, that wasn’t the issues, but where they the couple who always kissed each other hello and good bye? Or were they the more laid back kind of couple. Would Tony want a goodbye kiss? He was so independent and they hadn’t talked about making their relationship official. Not even the team knew.
“I’m pretty sure Stephen is a blank too” Janet thought she said low enough for only Carol to hear. The Wasp had always trouble keeping her liquor down. Carol was a blank? He found himself stroking the non existent words on his wrist.“And he’s a good looker. If you like the silver fox thing. His love life is even more tragic than yours” the blonde woman looked over at him as if she was considering it.
Stephen wanted to say no. His body had other plans. Eyes that had been focused on the ornament to his side shifted, and just liked that he was captivated by the creatures eyes. They were wrong, his mind kept telling him. By the Flames of... Faltine? Seven Rings of... All-seeing eye of Agamo- Vishanti? He couldn’t even conjure up a real spell. They were all jumbled in his mind by a mist he couldn’t clear. It was becoming thicker.
The sorcerer attempted to look away as the figure stepped in front of him. He didn’t want to face Tony’s gaze. It was penetrating, nauseating. Demanding. He felt his face being tilted up so he could look into the taller creatures face. Sometimes he forgot that Tony was taller than him.
“That’s cheating and you know it.” Steve accused, his voice stern and accusatory however his eyes had a soft sense to them. His annoyance with the engineer never really calmed his feelings towards the other man, and Stark knew it.
“See you later” Tony said as he stood by the doorframe and watched the super soldier with a longing look. Steve had the exact same expression on his firm face as he watched the genius leave.
It was when Tony didn’t kiss back that a part Steve knew it was over between them. His stubborn side screamed at him that it was still possible to save their shattered parody of a marriage. Steve tried to bleed some of the love that he once felt for this man through the kiss, but the other’s lips were stoic. He kept staring at Steve, but the eyes that been full of joy just a year earlier were now lifeless. He tried grabbing the other in a desperate attempted to spark a life in their dying ember. Was the passion that once been a wildfire even an ember anymore? Maybe it was just coal, but he refused to believe it. They loved each other.
“You were in trouble. You weren’t moving. I had to do something” Tony was still fired up, he looked at Steve with lost eyes. He was till mad and worked up, yet so terrified at the same time. He was beautiful like that. He hadn’t been sure what he was doing as he stepped closer to the worked up man and pulled him close. There was a moment on confusion in the bright man’s eyes as he kissed him. It was just an in the moment thing, he wanted to shut the idiot up and scream at him at the same time. The kiss had been a long time coming. He knew there had been this unspoken thing between them. Tony kissed back. It was an angry kiss, a fight for dominance. Not the sweet first kiss he imagined. In a way, this was better.
“No, Stark… Tony. I’m just scared. I thought you were dead” He said, but the infuriating man was just waving it off as it was nothing. It was something that scared him, losing his first friend in this century to a supervillain. That had almost come true today when the Wrecking Crew had attacked the mansion. He was the only Avenger there at the moment and Mr. Stark had one of his rare days off. They had been chatting since they just finished sparing together and everything had just gone smoothly. That was until the wall blew up by a giant wrecking ball and Steve had been flung to the side. Tony, the damn idiot hadn’t run away to find protection. He’d attacked the assailant that had moved in to make the killing blow. Steve had been disorientated had he’d watched in horror as Piledriver threw Tony into the wall… He wasn’t moving, and there had been blood. He’d seen white after that.
“No, shit Tony, that was not what I meant. You don’t have the same training as the rest of us, I don’t want you do get hurt” His voice were softer now, it was filled with regret. If he hadn’t already shattered his friendship with the billionaire at that moment he doubted Tony would tolerate any more comments about his incapability to defend himself. He hated when people thought he was helpless, Steve knew that. But Tony was just a civilian and Iron Man was nowhere in sight to defend him.
“Aye! And you were as magnificent as always” Thor boomed with laughter. It was hard to tell if he flirted or not. Everyone wondered if Clint and Natasha were soulmates, but neither had said a word about it. Maybe they were just close. He wanted to ask. Because if they weren’t soulmates he wished he could have what they had. His eyes trailed to Tony instead who was now holding his husband from behind. He couldn’t hear what he was saying. He was talking too low and he couldn’t really see his lips move. He could guess what they said. Hey sweetheart, how’s it going? I missed you. Let’s retire early tonight, I want my soulmate all to myself.
There were a few things that all of the Avengers took seriously. Saving the world, protecting civilians, a kidnapped friend and stray animals were just some of them. The thing they were most passionate about thought, was to kick one another’s ass at Mario Kart. Ever since Clint begged Tony to buy them the latest Nintendo console, Tuesday nights had been dedicated for Mario Kart. The conjoint reaction towards the childish game were skepticism, but with teams competitive nature, butchering one another in a game of Mario Kart had soon become a regular thing at the tower. Everything was decided by duking it out in front of the ridiculously large screen. Mundane chores like who was doing the dishes, to who had the night shift. They all swore like a bunch of well-educated-somewhat-bilingual sailors. Tony swore he’d moved into to a frat house and not the headquarters of a league of super powered individuals. Funny how life decided to turn out sometimes.
Tony was smiling as his spoke. He looked so happy. As if this was everything he wanted. By the time Stark looked up, Stephen was already gone. He had nothing left there. What was he even supposed to do? They were all having a blast without him, and his suffering would drag the others down.
Tony isn't sure why he's still keeping track - keeping score - of what Steve does and does not demand of him, but he notices that Steve doesn't demand sex over the course of the day. They had sex this morning, and even people (well, alphas) who don't take marriage as blanket consent to sex would still take the initiation of sex as that same blanket permission.
The magician entered the Sanctum. Everything was so quiet compared to the tower. He could still hear the music at the back of his mind. The thought of staying for any longer was nauseating. It filled him with that dreaded regret and longing he was familiar with. He was pathetic. Even more so for the fact that he wanted to cry. Tony wasn’t even his soulmate he had to remind himself. Wong wasn’t there. He hadn’t been there here in ages. He was alone in this dreaded Sanctum that could drive any person insane if they spent too long inside. Maybe that was what wrong with him.
“Were celebrating that New York is still standing and that we managed to keep everyone out from the medical bay” he felt Tony’s arm wrap around his. It would be so easy to press him up against the wall. To steal the one kiss he wanted since they fought their first mythical monster together. “Come on, your brooding demeanor doesn’t fool me. I know your just a big softy under that cloak of yours”
“It’s alright. You got a point” the bubbly woman said with a smile on her face. As if the mention of Hank didn’t make her sad. Or pissed off.
Steve had just walked up to him, and kissed him. It wasn’t like they never kissed before. They kissed on a regular basis, they kissed one another just that morning before Steve left for his morning jog, that let’s face it, was an entire marathon. He didn’t expect Steve to causally walk up to him as he entered the living room and kiss him in front of the others. Tony’s eyes went from his teammates to the blonde in front of him and he kissed back. He pulled the wholesome man closer to his own body and held him tightly as his fingers desperately tugged on his ridiculously small shirt, he swore that Steve knew it was too small for him, he just wore it to tempt Tony. Well two could play that game. He would be sure to wear his tank tops outside the workshop more often. It was like the room disappeared from around him and the only thing that seemed real was the captain’s firm lips. He swore the serum even kept his lips as perfect condition. Or he might found the best chapstick formula and kept it for himself so the rest the world would suffer. Bastard. The thought made him kiss him a bit more angrily. When they finally pulled away, the shorter man was breathless. He couldn’t get a single intelligent thought through his brain, all he did was to stare as the blonde just simply let him go and strolled out of the room as if he hadn’t given Tony the best kiss in the world.
“Well, damn” Clint’s voice broke him out of his trance. He was still a bit flustered and out of breath. He’d forgotten all about his teammates. That bastard.
He reluctantly pulled away when they stopped to breathe. He liked his lips tentatively which prompted the captain to go into for a second kiss. They couldn’t. Before their lips could meet again and he ruined Steve’s relationship for good, he turned away. If Steve kissed him like that again, he wouldn’t be able to restrain himself. They could still save his best friend’s relationship. Pretend like it never happened. Kissing Tony Stark didn’t count as cheating.
“No, we can’t” he whispered when the blonde stroke his face. The touch was gentle, but still a bit concerned. The man was too good for him. Or maybe he wasn’t. They were kissing and Steve had a girlfriend. That said a lot about someone’s personality, however he didn’t see it as a flaw. It was a mistake. Steve didn’t know what he was doing. They had dined together as they usually would, after all Steve was his best friend. One thing had led to another. He didn’t intended for the night to end like this.
“Hey, Merlin” the familiar sound of Tony’s voice brought him out from his thoughts. How he longed to being woken up by that very voice. To feel his firm biceps around his own strong core. Stark had found a new joy in calling him a bunch of random wizards names. Yesterday it been Gandalf and the day before that it been Dumbledore. He’d seen Tony a bit more frequently the last few weeks. That was the price he paid when he agreed to join the team. Maybe he should resign. After all, Wanda was as good as back, they only needed one magician. He turned his attention towards Tony to show the eager man that he had his attention.
Using his genius mind, and quick thinking Tony let his eyes wander to the good old captain’s screen. A sharp turn, good. He might not been lucky with the items but he had something at his artillery that was as effective as a blue shell. Just when Steve was about to drift Tony leaned in close and kissed the spot just above his shoulder where his shirt ended and his throat began. It was just a quick touch with his lips, and not even close to as skilled as the kiss he placed on the blonde’s collarbone the night before, but it accomplished what he wanted. Steve’s character skid into the wall just as Tony drove past him and claimed his victory.
“We broke up months ago. It wasn’t working out, hadn’t for a while. I told her that I had feelings for someone else” Steve said as he turned the dark haired man’s head to face him. He was smiling like Tony was everything to him. Uncertainly, Tony smiled again. “So can I kiss your insecure ass again, or do I need to convince you that my feelings are towards you?”
Stephen thanked the Hoary Host of Hoggoth and the Omnipotent Oshtur that they didn’t end up at a karaoke bar. Instead they agreed on buying take out from whatever place that was still open after an alien attack, which was an surprising amount to be honest. Maybe that said something about the citizens of New York. They gotten a good variety of Asian food as well as Italian and even some mythical to please Strange (although that kind of food was from Strange own fridge, he appreciated his attempt tough). It didn’t seem to be enough food, since Captain America was currently manning the grill whilst the rest were ether in the pool or dancing by the speakers. The amount of food they ate weren’t that surprising. After all, they were a team of superheroes. Even the ordinary humans consumed a lot of food. As little as Strange liked these kind of gatherings, he didn’t mind this. Not far away from him, Janet and Carol were talking amongst themselves. He didn’t eavesdrop, even if they mentioned his name a few times. They had stopped dancing a few minutes ago and were eating some sushi as they let their legs rest in the perfectly temperature pool.
“Takes more than that than to kill me” He stated. He was obviously done with the discussion, Steve however had just started.
If they ever got back together again, he imagined it would be when the world was ending… again. It would be an adrenaline filled kiss that they both would awkwardly tell the other to forget, because they wouldn’t work. He never imagined it randomly happen in the kitchen. Tony had accidentally walked into his ex’s warm embrace as he waited for his coffee to brew, and the next thing he knew he’d leaned in for a kiss. Steve didn’t leave him hanging, they were both kissing each other passionately, begging the other to take them back. Tony was so sorry, and he could feel the sorrow pouring from the other man as they stood there, desperately kissing each other as the world would end at that moment. He missed this, missed Steve and his wonderful lips. His kindness, but also his way of calling him out on his bullshit. The blonde was never afraid of telling him when he’d done something stupid. He even missed how the bastard would wake him up at an ungodly hour and ‘force’ him to run with him. They didn’t talk, they didn’t need to. They both wanted the other back.
It was just recently that everything was getting back to normal. It had been awkward at first. Long silences when they met each other in the hallways. Minimum word exchanges on the battlefield. Leaving the room when the other entered. It was hard to deal with, so Tony tried to keep as much time away as possible. He’d never been this thankful for a business trip abroad, but other than that he kept as many hours at the office he could, sometimes he considered just sleeping there. Thankfully Steve had been on the same page and accepted as many missions as S.H.I.E.L.D. was allowing him. It was just recently they started spending time with each other again. The team had obviously noticed the two’s lack of kissing, so had the tabloids. For months there had been chatter about them. If Tony had cheated, if they broke up, If Steve finally got his sense back and left his ass. They stayed professional at the battlefield. Even when they were a couple they always referred to one another as Iron Man and Captain, sometimes Winghead and Shellhead, at least that stayed the same. Expect Tony weren’t flying off with his boyfriend after a fight. Now Iron Man flew off alone while Steve flew with the rest of the team. They knew better than to ask, but Tony knew from the looks he got that they weren’t happy with the situation. They were core members of the team, if something happened between Tony and Steve, it would affect the rest of the team.
Like love and war, everything was permitted and nothing was sacred. Not even relationships. All though they had to completely band weapons during their game nights. Some tended to get a bit too passionate whenever they played games together. Today, the room was relatively quiet. Clint and Natasha were on a top secret mission for S.H.I.E.L.D. that Stark knew everything about. Thor in Asgard and since it wasn’t Tuesday, Bruce had decided to meditate or whatever he did to keep the Hulk at bay. Which just left him with Steve. Since they decided to play the game on friendly terms, it wasn’t a bloodbath. Most of the races were close, but not a massacre as it usually was. Well that was until they decided to throw in a price. It didn’t matter what the object they were racing about was, they both were hell bent on winning it. The fact that they would win full control over their boyfriend for one whole hour, sweetened the deal. This time the race was quiet. Neither one of them bothered with trash talk or witty battering. Their eyes were glued to the brightly colored screen. Steve had the lead, and unless Tony got a useful item anytime soon, he would probably be forced to join his lover for a morning run or something dull like that.
There was a short silence between the girls. For a second Carol seemed to wonder if she taken it too far.
“Jan, you can’t be sure that he’s a blank. And what if he already have a wife in another dimension?” Carol pointed out.
“I’ll be going then” he stated, and once again he was going nowhere. They were right back at their awkward goodbye.
Their lives were hectic. Tony had a company to run and when he wasn’t in his office, he was probably out with Steve fighting yet another giant robot or some lowlife villain who tried to hit the jackpot. You wondered if the villains didn’t get the point soon, it was getting tiresome. And when he weren’t fighting giant octopuses, he was working on either the suit, or the team’s gears, or whatever project S.H.I.E.L.D. had consulted him on. It wearing him down. Steve didn’t have much free time either. He was often out on black ops or hunting down Hydra, and with Tony’s frequent business trips, they didn’t see much eye to eye. It was the reason they valued the little time they did had and tried to interact as much as possible. Whenever Tony was away and Steve couldn’t follow, they would try to have a video chat at least once a day. Though that was an optimistic thought and both of them knew it.
“Bull, he’s off but have you heard about *anyone* having a soulmate from another dimension. We’ve never seen him with anyone. Besides if he found his soulmate, wouldn’t he already be with her?”
“Yeah. I’ll be going then” The genius said as he forced his eyes away from the taller man to hesitantly move out.
He couldn’t. Not anymore. He needed Tony, or this messed up imagine of him. His shaking arms wrapped around the creature’s body. His face buried in his chest as his aching hands squeezed the fabric of his suit. His whole body was shaking. Was it from the lack of any other emotion than despair, or was it the pain? Maybe the desperation. He needed this. He needed the illusion of being with Tony, and in a messed up way this was it. He had his own Tony Stark waiting for him at home.
So Stark tried to not act on his feelings. It was working perfectly, they were best friends both as Iron Man and Tony Stark. They spent more time together than the genius would like to admit, and it was only pulling them closer to one another. Everything was great, until Steve’s innocent blue eyes locked with his. He’d tried to avoid any prolonged eye contact in fear of his stupid brain would do and now Rogers were ruining it all. He was about to lean away, or pat the captain’s firm back in a friendly manner, just to make his brain stop thinking about how beautiful his eyes were, when the super soldier leaned in closer. Holy crap, Steve was about to kiss him. His heart kept beating as fast as a hummingbird’s wings and if it wasn’t for chunky chest plate that kept his heart beating, he was sure his heart would stop. But the kiss never came. Tony kept watching Steve who’d just stopped a few inches away from his lips. He could practically feel the warmth of his quick breaths, as if he expected Tony to close the distance. They stood like that for what couldn’t be more than a few seconds but felt like hours. Stark completely frozen and unsure what to do. There was an uncharacteristic silence between the two men, for the first time neither of them knew what to say. He was ready to leave, and forget about this whole thing. Maybe by hitting the bottle. If something would make the alcoholic slip, then it was kissing his old fashioned and not as straight as he thought, best friend.
and if you feel like I did I'll help you leave I swear' right on up to vows to hunt down any or all of these people and make sure they can never hurt anyone again.
Tony looks at him for a little while but doesn't say anything, and Steve continues mending. A minute later Tony turns back to the desk and picks up the pen, and a moment later begins writing feverishly.
"I'm going to go grab a blanket," Steve says, quietly so as not to startle him. Tony nods absently, and Steve goes upstairs and closes his door. He takes longer than he needs to gathering up some blankets and debating whether or not he ought to bring the straw tick down as well, and sure enough he hears Tony come upstairs and close his own door. Does he feel guilty for not staying downstairs as well? Is that why he wouldn't leave the lower floor when Steve was down there? Steve sighs and scrubs a hand over his face.
. It's like stepping into someone's box of favorite things that they made just to keep those things safe. And it's - it's strange, the way I feel like there are bits of it missing; bits of it left unfinished just for me.
"And if," Mr Jarvis says, "we go to the chapel now, will the offer to accommodate me for the night still stand?"
Tony doesn't answer for long enough that Steve thinks he didn't hear, but then Tony says slowly, "No. I'd like - I'd like to stay. Here. To see everyone."
"Listen," Steve says. He stopped whittling ages ago; now he lets the tools fall onto the table at his side and twists in his seat, leaning towards Tony. "I know that both of us knew this would be moving real quick, but you only just saw the place. If you don't want to get married tomorrow, that's fine. You can stay here while you make up your mind, or I can get you a room at the hotel in town. Like I said before, Mister Jarvis is welcome to stay as long as he likes. I know – I know we both knew this was going to be fast, but Tony, don't do anything you don't want to do. Don't do something you're going to regret."
"Good night, Tony," Steve whispers after him, and doesn't know if Tony hears. He shuts the door and Steve stays on the porch for a long, long time.
with him? Tony is – Steve's never even met him but just from his letters Steve already cares about him so, so much. And yet here Steve is, head turning at the first pretty face he sees.
Steve came when they had sex this morning, or said he did, but Tony missed the whole thing. Literally all of it. It's not just that he doesn't know what Steve's face looked like, he also doesn't know what his cock does, or if he shakes or goes still, or how far down the blush goes, or what noises he makes -
Rather than break the tension, though, this response merely ratchets the tension higher: Mr Jarvis's smile is so cold even Steve can tell it's not just a cultural difference, and his voice is icy enough to make even the bright mountain sun dim.
"Mister Rogers," Mr Jarvis says right behind him, and Steve turns in surprise. Mr Jarvis is looking at him seriously, and after a moment he holds out his hand.
It takes him a second, but he works out that Tony's sitting propped up against the headboard, Steve's legs curled so that Tony's bent legs are resting over his, the backs of his knees against the side of Steve's thigh. He's got one arm around Tony's waist, holding on to him like a stuffed toy or a life raft, with his face pressed to Tony's clothed hip.
He keeps watching the doors, but no one else comes off the train. Tony's not here. All thoughts of the beautiful man are driven from his mind in sudden terror. Where's Tony? The train only stops but once a day, and this was definitely the right day (Steve's lost count of how many times he read the letter with Tony's travel information; that's no one's business but his own). One of the conductors walks past him to go to the ticket window, and Steve asks him if there are any more passengers. The man tartly informs him that there's no one else getting off at this stop and ignores Steve's thanks.
No. What I said before isn't a wish. I'm asking you, Steve: please tell me what happened. I know you don't want to, and I understand that, I swear I do, but I can fix this, Steve. I can fix it, but I need to know what it is I'm fixing in the first place.
"So," Tony says, trying to sound conversational but voice muffled as he burrows into Steve's shoulder, "I'm considering rescinding your permission to ever
"I know," Steve says. "But I'm –" and then he doesn't know how to finish that sentence. I'm what? I'm your husband? That makes it sound like Steve only cares out of a sense of duty and isn't personally invested in Tony himself, which is completely untrue. I'm your alpha? Gods, that's even worse.
You likely believe I'm writing to my mother. Five minutes ago you would have been right. I thought I had so much to say to her until I started writing, and now I find there was far less to say than I thought.
Before meeting you - No, even before that. Prior to leaving New York, I suppose, I had a very clear picture of what a good husband and a good alpha would be, and you only fulfilled that fantasy some of the time. The rest of the time you were like nothing I'd ever hoped for, like nothing I ever dared dream. I wanted so badly to trust you, Steve, but the more sure of you I became the more I doubted myself. And, to be honest, the more selfish I became, too. The more you gave me the more I wanted.
Natasha laughs, but not unkindly. "You're right. That probably won't go over very well. Just... ask him what he expects. Tell him what
They start walking back towards the house and Tony goes quiet again. This time Steve doesn't try to break the silence, unsure if Tony's quiet because he's afraid or just because he has nothing to say.
talk to him about it, Steve. That's all I can tell you, but – nothing will start to get better unless you speak with him about sex."
"And what if he doesn't tell me?" Steve doesn't want to say 'and what if he lies,' because he's not going to accuse his own husband of being a liar – but still, the fear is there.
"Still," Tony says. "It's hard, knowing that all the times I thought we were happy they really weren't."
Steve hadn't wanted Tony to have to do a single thing – not just today but for a long while yet, not till he gets settled and decides what he wanted to do – and had expected to not want to spend much time on supper, so all he has to do is heat up food he's already made. He is, of course, embarrassed by this too, as all he has to offer is a hearty stew and thick bread. He'd thought – well. Clearly he'd thought a lot of things that weren't going to come true.
"Hello, Steve!" Jane says as soon as soon as they enter. If Steve thinks she smiles when she saw him, it's nothing to the way her face lights up when she sees Tony.
They're halfway down the street from the station, but Steve hears the train as loudly as if he were standing on the platform. The whistle as it comes up the mountain and rounds the last bend, warning anyone near the tracks. It rumbles and grinds into the station. The brakes shriek. There's an awful wait while it doesn't move. Then the whistle blows again, and the engine roars, and the chug chug of the wheels starts and picks up speed, and a few minutes later he can't hear it anymore at all.
He huffs a laugh, though he still doesn't look at Steve. "No, I just – no. I, ah, I thought – that is, I mean..." he trails off and huffs again, running a hand through his hair. "Would you, would you mind if I stayed down here tonight, too? Not, not
"She – god, it was amazing. It was like watching a magician. She helped me play them off each other, every single one of them. Kept it up for over a year, she was so good at it."
Tony smiles at him but doesn't say anything. Mr Jarvis side-eyes him so severely Steve resolves to keep his mouth shut for the rest of the drive. He has no idea what he did to garner such a reaction.
"I mean," Steve says, awkwardly, "it's your house now too, Tony, and I know it's not your home yet but I'd like it to be someday. You can do whatever you like, have as many people over for as long as you want them. And honestly, I mean, you only just got here and you don't know anyone yet – other than me, but, I mean, I know it's not the same – so honestly the longer you'd like to stay the better, Mister Jarvis."
He lets go of Steve's hand but doesn't turn away. A moment later Steve hopes he doesn't sound too foolish when he says, "I'll take care of him, Mister Jarvis. I promise."
"Wow, you really are tired, aren't you," Tony says, and it sounds like he's trying not to laugh. Steve only realizes he was staring at his boots and frowning when he looks at Tony's glowing, smiling face and feels himself smile back.
Steve crosses the room in two quick strides and puts a hand on Tony's shoulder - and as soon as Steve touches him Tony turns towards him, flings himself at him, clutches the letter to his chest with one hand and holds Steve tight with the other and buries his face in Steve's neck.
he's got all of Tony's most intimate places spread out and tilted towards his eager eyes and hungry mouth. He groans like he's been punched and has to close his eyes and grit his teeth to keep from coming right then.
That startles a laugh out of Tony, and the situation may still be potentially dire but Steve feels better.
The thought that anything at all might change any of him, the thought of him becoming even a little bit less relaxed or aroused or happy, is
In the end he puts on his under-drawers and his shirt, then dashes back to the house quick and furtive as a thief. Tony's not on the first floor so Steve closes the door quietly, then runs fast as he can on tip-toe across the room and up the stairs. He doesn't breathe until he's safely behind his bedroom door.
This is a bit embarrassing, but I'm also going to try to sell some woodcarvings. I'll work on them over the winter and see if I can sell them back east come spring. I'm not sure I'll be any good at it, though
There's such a morass of conflicting feelings and urges swirling inside Steve's head that he isn't even able to fully parse what Tony's saying. What does get through to him makes him feel like an utter failure, though hell if he'd be able to explain why.
as though we'd met and begun courting the usual way. I didn't ask you to marry me because I wanted a companion or a partner, someone to talk to and to feed the chickens when I'm away from home. I asked you to marry me because I wanted to marry you.
After a little while, though, Steve kisses his way up to the outside of Tony's hip, suckling lightly at the smooth skin for a moment before resting his chin gently there and looking at Tony's face.
Tony smells so good here, and the proof of his arousal and enjoyment is heady. Steve mouths at his cock, licks at the head, seals his lips to the side of it and sucks, laps down to the base and pushes his nose through the curls to press the point of his tongue to Tony's balls. He wants to press his face between Tony's legs and get even closer; cover himself in Tony's smell and sweat and slick.
Steve's been out in rain that soaked through his clothes before, but this is something else. He's been thrown fully-clothed into deep rivers and come out less wet than this. Even his saddle is wet beneath him, which is its own special hell all on its own.
"No you don't," Tony says firmly, pressing down on his shoulder. "I fed and watered the stock and let them out. After the night you had you deserve a little actual rest. So you just stay where you are until you very well feel like getting up."
"Also," Sam says, forestalling any of Steve's complaining, "Maria said Tony would probably want this."
Gradually bits of him break free of whatever's holding him. He can twitch a finger, move a foot. He puts all his concentration into using the bit of movement he has to get out of bed and do it quietly.
Tony snorts a laugh, and Steve laughs with him, playfully nudging him in reproof. "It made sense! I assumed your family had money and then fell on hard times, and that you were making a living off your intelligence. And I was so – gods, Tony, I couldn't wait to get you out here. To take care of you. I was so excited to get you out of whatever sort of boarding house you were living in in New York and out here where you'd have a whole house to yourself, and where things wouldn't be as opulent as what I thought you'd grown up with, but where you wouldn't have to
Only a few minutes into the movie someone plopped down on the couch next to him, making him almost leap off the couch. He hadn’t heard anything, too engrossed in the reunion between Mike and the other guys.
“Why is it different? Because I'm not genetically modified? I forget sometimes that I'm just a fragile human living among gods.” Tony scoffed.
Tony was working in his shop when Steve strolled in wearing a white wife beater and baggy sweatpants. He looked like he was going to workout or jog or some other beefcake ritual, except Steve was not wearing any shoes.
It was a crappy, outdated flip phone. Tony's real phone made this one look like garbage. There was no smart tech on it. There were no cool functions. Hell, it only had one number in it.
He had seen it so often he sort of forgot how shocking it could be for a first time viewer. Steve's face was a devastating mix of horror, pain, and sorrow. Tears stood in Steve's eyes, seeing the evidence of how close Tony had come to death.
Needing more, Tony hooked his leg over Steve, working as close as he could. No, they could get closer. In a tangle of body parts, Tony shifted them until Steve was on his back and Tony sat astride him. Fingers pulled out of him, replaced by something bigger and blunter and just what Tony craved.
Rotating his body, Tony lined up their bodies, both men on their sides to face the other. He rocked his hips on Steve's fingers, in turn rubbing his cock against the Steve's belly.
Part of Tony wanted to watch creepily as Steve ate the strawberry, watching his lips wrap around the thick fruit. No. That would be weird. Better to watch the movie.
One night stands could be hot. First times with a new love could be great. But this? Being with a partner who knows your body almost as well as their own, and knowing them as intimately, is the absolute bees fucking knees.
All of a sudden Tony shifted below Steve and brought his hot talented mouth on to Steve’s dick. With his mouth full of Bucky’s spunk covered fingers and Tony sucking him like there was no tomorrow, he came with a whimper, Bucky’s hand absorbing most of the sound.
Keeping his eyes downcast, Steve sat in a vacant chair, legs spread open. Shifting his body, he pop and locked, or whatever that deliciously enticing stop motion movement was called, even better than Mike did in the movie.
“No, you're being too hard on yourself.” Now that Tony saw the two men together, it really made sense. “You guys are perfect for each other, mazel tov.”
Crying out loudly, Steve must have cum because he clenched down around Tony's dick like a glorious vice.
“Do you wear stuff like that around the new recruits?” Tony half-joked. “I bet you'd cause a scene.”
“I thought it was about more than male strippers.” Steve laughed before catching sight of Tony’s bowl of snacks. “What are you eating?”
The smaller man hopped off the bed and sauntered over to Steve. Tony was always sexy beyond Steve’s wildest dreams. It was like sex oozed out of his pores.
For once in his life, Tony’s mind was blissfully blank. Everything was just sensation, feeling guiding him. His skin felt semipermeable, so thin that Steve’s skin, sweat, and essence flowed in to Tony. And Tony flowed back.
When he rocked forward, Bucky slammed into Tony and it was like a chorus of filthy noises coming out of all of them. Even though Bucky had done a lot of prep work, he was still tight around Steve. Every movement Steve made, Bucky echoed into Tony by the sheer force of it. It was like Steve was fucking Tony with Bucky.
Tony wanted to hate Bucky. He wanted to be spiteful and jealous. When he looked at Bucky, when Bucky spoke to him, when the light gleamed off of his metal arm Tony understood. He saw that Steve and Bucky had to be together, that is just how things were. Steve was the sun burning bright and hot, Bucky was the moon dark and mysteriously beautiful. And Tony, well, he was stuck in the dirt of Earth billions of miles off of these two celestial beings.
Looking over at Bucky, Steve saw he was standing next to the bed. Both hands sat on top of his head, effectively stretching out his lean and muscled torso. The panties appeared unsullied from the front. Except Bucky’s dick was hard, pushing at the fabric, making the lace strain against it. It was sinful, pornographic, and fucking hot.
Wasting no more time, Tony lunged for Steve, their lips colliding. The force Tony hit him with pushed Steve back.
Steve was still working his own shaft at a slow and steady pace so Tony went lower, sucking and licking at Steve’s balls.
“We're okay.” Tony said, petting Steve's grown out hair, battling his own tears. He wasn't sure if he meant they were okay as individuals or as a pair. It didn't matter, he guessed either way conveyed the meaning. “We're okay.”
Relaxed and sated, Tony rested but kept his eyes glued to Steve. He wanted to imprint every part of this moment in his brain. He never wanted to forget this sight, this feeling.
Everything happened so fast after that. A battle. Jumping on a freaking spaceship. Meeting aliens and humans on a destroyed planet. Another battle and losing….people. Tony couldn't really bare to think too long about it, or else he might fall apart. Just him and an alien woman, who seemed more cyborg than organic, made it back to Earth. And all without the cell phone that had become his security blanket.
“I’m very busy and important but I always have time for you, Capsicle.” Tony said, putting down the gauntlet his was tweaking with.
“Yeah.” Steve said using his Captain America voice. “Daddy wants you to make those pretty panties nice and filthy.”
“He's been working on intel with some former Shield agents” Bruce must have seen him searching, had he been that obvious? “He'll be back tonight or tomorrow.”
On floor propped next to Steve was a large canvas. Tony would have noticed it if the other man wasn't so distracting.
Steve thought he should have a part of him that was angry that they all conspired against him but he felt good. He felt so incredibly horny, why waste time fighting? Everything in him was focused on how much he wanted to fuck Bucky and Tony.
Steve skated away, a movement focused in his gloriously muscled arms without moving his legs, and spun to face Tony. On his knees now, Steve leaned back, tearing his shirt away from his torso that should never be covered up. Ever.
“I'm glad you survived the snap heard round the universe but you don't seem too happy.” Tony said before he could think it might piss Steve off.
“You love me too much to leave.” Steve said as a joke but when he looked at Tony then at Bucky he knew it was the truth.
The Avengers Tower was deserted, no immediate threats were at hand so the team was in the wind. Steve took the private elevator to Tony’s room. No, wait, it was their penthouse. Steve and Bucky still had other private rooms. Tony had his workshop to retreat to. However, for the most part they cohabitated in the penthouse. It was a good thing Tony had a bed big enough for the entire Avengers team to share, so the three men were always comfortable.
That was the only encouragement Tony needed to start really fucking him. He rammed his cock over and over into Steve, loving the heat.
“You call it ostentatious.” Tony said as he began to climb back on the mattress. “But we would be much less comfortable if I didn’t have the foresight to custom make such a bed.”
Without a word, or breaking bodily contact, Steve opened the bottle and his coated fingers were pressing into Tony. He wrapped his arms around Steve, pulling the larger man’s face to his. Cold shock and uncomfortable stretch gave way to that wonderful feeling of penetration. One finger moved quickly to two. The twinge of pain only added to his desire. Sometimes pain meant death or illness but sometimes it is a reminder of life.
Bucky laughed as Steve threw pillows at both of them. No one else was touching them except for Steve. They were his forever and always.
When he could open his eyes again, Steve found Bucky and Tony standing in front of him, looking smug. In a way this was all their fault but they didn’t have the upper hand this time and they were nowhere near being done for the night.
Collapsing onto the bed next to Tony, Steve tried to breath but he almost sounded like he was wheezing. Bucky fell in line on the other side of Tony so they made a Stark sandwich.
It was Tuesday night. Nothing going on in the tower. All the little avengers on their own little missions, or whatever they did when the team wasn’t fighting aliens from deep space or sociopathic mutants. Tony had just completed his latest Iron man suit upgrades so he was going to indulge in a little well earned “me time”.
Bucky crawled up next to Steve and kissed Steve’s shoulders and collarbone. Shifting their positions Steve put Bucky between Tony’s legs. Pushing him forward he lined Bucky’s cock up with Tony’s prepped hole.
“Alright.” Steve said, back in control as he pulled away from Tony. “Bucky, take those things off and I want both of you on that ostentatious bed.”
Steve liked any kind of art, Tony knew that, however painting was his favorite. Drawing was like cake and painting was like icing. He'd been without icing for years then.
“He looks good, doesn’t he Tony?” Steve asked but the answer was obvious the way Tony couldn’t tear his eyes away from Bucky.
The kiss broke, Steve's lips wandered away to find Tony’s neck. Specifically that certain spot between jawline and ear that made Tony pant, and latched on. Tony’s eyes rolled back and his body arched against the other man. Not only did it feel sublime, it also would leave a mark and that stoked Tony’s fire. He wanted marks all over, physical reminders for everyone to see that Steve owned him. Hell, maybe he should just get “Property of Steve Rogers” tattooed across his forehead. That would definitely get the point across.
Picking it up, Steve walked it to the dresser in front of Tony, spun the picture around, placed it neatly, then took a step back to stand next to Tony. They were standing close enough that Tony could feel the heat radiating off of Steve.
Mike was working in his shop, welding mask and all. Tony could relate. Stay busy and you don’t think about everything else going on in the world that is falling apart that you can’t control. Makes sense.
Without thinking, Steve realized he was slowly rubbing the palm of his hand against his crotch. How could he not be unbelievably turned on with these two in front of him? They were too much to resist, even for a super solider.
Tony had been close to cumming since Steve walked in the room so he could go any second. He wanted to be a gentleman though and let Steve cum first. Now he could focus on that white fire pooling in his gut.
Love, lust, whatever it was, Tony was hooked like never before. So like any elementary school boy with a crush, Tony pulled at Steve’s metaphorical pigtails. Not that he didn’t give everyone a hard time but he really worked at riling Steve up. He would push and Steve would just push right back. The tension built in the lab. Yeah, it was there between everyone thanks to Loki but between he and Steve? That was magic. It almost came to blows. It may seem strange to want to be hit by that man. Sometimes contact is contact. Either way you feel alive. Then everything went to crap. And they worked together so seamless and unified.
The group started swapping war stories before too long. Tony excused himself to his rooms, he hadn't talked to Pepper yet.
“Yeah.” Pepper said. “We all have ‘gotta do what we gotta do’. I'm sorry Tony but I'm done. I can't. I just can't. “
The lights dimmed as the huge TV turned on and the movie began. Nestling into the couch with his bounty, Tony wrapped his lips around one of the plump decadent strawberries.
They chuckled as Bucky ran his hands over Steve's broad chest, massaging his huge pecs. Bucky pinched and flicked at Steve's nipples, Steve arching into the touch. Steve saw Bucky’s eyes were trained on Steve's chest.
Not only could Steve feel need for the them growing but it was as if all of his sexual inhibitions were gone. All the naughty thoughts and every dirty daydream he had ever conjured was crashing to the surface. And he wanted them to act every single one of them out.
“It is so nice.” Tony said, voice cracking. “The lace is just rough enough and his skin, damn, it's unbelievably soft. And between the two...it's just tops.”
Bucky broke first, which wasn’t surprising as he was literally getting it from both ends. He cried out as he came, slumping forward like a ragdoll that Steve fucked through his orgasm. Steve watched as Bucky spit in his metal hand and jerked Tony off with it until Tony’s cum covered the glistening silver.
“What he’s doing isn’t even that hard.” Rolling his eyes, Steve pointed at the screen. “I do more complicated moves in my sleep.”
“No, sir.” Bucky said, pulling down his panties a little to bring his cock out, the waistband settling under his balls.
“No. Just that they are male strippers trying to make an honest buck.” Tony responded, eating another strawberry.
The bliss was clear on Bucky’s face. Strangely the friction was even arousing for Steve, the heat and movement felt like it was all over his body at once.
The screen went dark and he went straight for the bottle of scotch in the corner. Two quick glasses later, he felt strong enough to take a shower.
It’s a crime how much he wants it, them, to be close to it, to be part of it. He keeps it to himself. He smiles and acts normal, never letting his hilariously charming facade fall.
Both men were reclined on the bed reading quietly; their legs crossed in a mirrored position. They were so alike but so different in many ways. Like bookends.
The smooth fabric of the robe ruffled as he tossed the tablet. Steve knew Tony was loving that slip sliding sensation as he moved.
Strong, huge arms surrounded Tony, clawing at his shirt to touch the skin underneath. Tony's hands wandered all over Steve, feeling each rise and fall of every muscle the beautiful captain had.
The first time Tony saw Steve Rogers on the helicarrier bridge, he knew he was already in love. When he saw Captain America fall from the sky to battle against himself and Thor, that took balls. He held his own and when he leveled a god with his shield...wow. On the bridge though he could see Steve and not just the iconic cowl. That face. That wolf in sheep’s clothing face. Everyone sees the cherubic beauty but Tony can see past that to the real Steve.
Letting out a small whimper Tony lowered himself to the ground in between Steve’s legs, kissing and biting his way down.
“I hope you know what you are asking for.” Steve said matter of factly. “I’m not going to be easy on either one of you.”
“Hey Tony.” Steve said with a smile but his eyes still showed how tired he was. “I hope it's okay that I'm here...I thought you would be back here at some point tonight.”
“No, I'm good.” Steve uncrossed his arms and leaned back a little. Tony could see Steve's muscles roll under the thin fabric, pecs almost accentuated by it. Tony's pulse quickened just a little.
A week or so went by, Steve steered clear of Tony most of the time. Whenever Tony came into the room Steve found an excuse to quickly exit it.
The silver lining was getting lost in his work. Collaborating with Bruce again was nice, the other scientist had such a calm energy compared to Tony’s chaoticness. Plus, Bruce actually seemed happy, which was different for the usually somber man. It wasn't until Tony saw Bruce and Thor approaching the lab, and Thor drew the other man into his arms and kissed the living daylights out of him, that Tony put it all together. Bruce walked in with a huge grin on his face until Tony corned him, demanding to know exactly what had happened during Bruce and Thor’s Space Adventure.
“I know. I understand.” Tony felt deflated, even though he knew it was coming. “I want you to be happy and I don't think you could be with me. I love you though, I do.”
"The glory is in skill of your practice and long hours of training." Steve said with conviction. "And if the wind is blowing in the right direction."
Finally he was going to see Magic Mike XXL. In peace. No one would even have to know. Just another secret between Jarvis and he.
“Goddammit, Steve. I needed you and you left with him.” Tony's voice was raised. “You left me. I thought..well, forget what I thought because it was wrong.”
Tony wanted him to stay, there was no way he could say that so he said the next best thing. “Are you still painting?”
Tony was alive. Steve was alive. He wanted to push their life forces together, combine their bodies and souls to thank whatever being allowed to be with one another again.
“Let's keep that going.” Tony said, eyes fiery with lust. “I don’t know what Thor gave you but remind me to send him flowers. Or a puppy. Something.”
“Libertine?” Tony said. “I prefer hedonist. You must be feeling good if you're getting historical at me."
He loved Pepper, yes very much, but not in that all consuming way that he loved Steve. Tony told Pepper he dreamed they had a child and it felt real. What he didn't tell her is that he used to have the same dream about he and Steve. Only recently did she appear in Steve's place.
“You don't have to say anything.” Steve said. “I just needed you to know that you are everything to me, no matter how long we've been apart.”
“I hope you like it.” Steve said, still nervous. “I painted what you said to, something beautiful and worth saving. You can have if you want, or not, whatever.”
Steve stopped and gave a little laugh. “It's kind of hard to find decent art supplies when you're on the run.”
Tony's fingers traced the blond's jaw line, holding him in place. His tongue moved over those lips, playfully darting into Steve's mouth. It could have felt like fireworks, but it felt better, like peace. Like home.
“Speak for yourself.” Bucky said in a smug tone that was completely lost as he looked wrecked, fucking his own hand.
“Why not? He was better than me, I thought you would want to discuss his greatness or something.” It was low and hurtful and he couldn't help but say it.
all that heavy. Not compared to the things Steve hauls about on a daily basis. If he had to carry it all the way back to the house it might be a problem, but just over to the buggy? He likely won't even break a sweat.
The drive home is nearly silent. Tony won't stop looking behind them, but he also won't admit he thinks they're being followed. Steve keeps alert and aware of their surroundings but doesn't press for answers yet.
jerk off - it makes him want to crawl into a hole in embarrassment, but Tony still has no idea if that's just an omega thing or not. Or maybe just a him thing. Everyone always said that an alpha couldn't come unless they were inside an omega, but Steve said he came this morning and his dick was nowhere near Tony.
When Tony stands again he takes Steve's left arm and hand, and Steve leans on him more heavily than he should as he peels off his socks and then his under-drawers. He doesn't fall over this time either, and when he lets go of the under-drawers and they fall into the tub with a splat Tony laughs.
. How perhaps the house would be nicer than what Tony was used to – almost certainly there will be a lot more space. Maybe he'd even be pleased with how big and nice it is; would be pleased with how well Steve's done for them. For
It would be pleasant if it weren't for the rain. Steve enjoys riding, enjoys being with his friends, enjoys going out to all the homes in and around Big Eden and seeing everyone, enjoys hard work and helping out. Today, though, every single one of those things is made miserable by the goddamn
"Shouldn't I be trying to impress you?" Tony says, but he's still smiling. "Making it seem like I'm self-reliant enough to be a good partner, and not a weak, hysterical omega?"
Hardly realizing what he's doing, Steve pulls his hat from his head and holds it awkwardly in both hands in front of his gut like a shield. The beautiful – Ton – Anth – Steve's om –
"Steve," Natasha says from behind him. He turns and she looks pensive, searching for something in his face that Steve doesn't understand. He waits, though, despite how the need to get to Tony is like prickles beneath his skin, because it's
"It's not a weapon" He said carefully after a few seconds, and they all breathed a sigh of relief. Tony picked Natasha's screwdriver up from off the floor without looking away from the tiny device. He popped the top with a satisfying ease and the noise stopped. Shuffling the two pieces around his palm a little, he turned to look at them.
Luckily, he seemed to have lost anyone who might've been following him, and hoists himself up easily to her.
Under the last packet and now clearly in the open, sat a curious little machine, small and intricate.
Just as she said that, they heard terribly laboured breath coming from the opposite side of the apartment's side road. They turned to see Tony, who was struggling a little with all the cardio.
"We've got to get out of here quick" Steve said urgently, "I'll bet we don't have much longer until they're here"
A quick knock on the garden doors and two extra heads pop into sight before shuffling their way hurriedly inside.
All four land with solid footing, and begin to leg it down the narrow passage. Faintly they could hear larger, heavier footsteps lurking behind them, but none turned to look.
And, yes, so it seemed, there was one of the thugs that had come to the house following closely behind Thor.
Tony, however, decided instead to plough his way through an open kitchen window that stood just metres before the end. Distantly, Nat could hear surprised yelps from whatever poor woman had to watch a sweaty-faced 16 year old carrying an espresso machine climb in through her window and exit through her front door.
Both Thor and Steve had the upper body strength to pull themselves up over the fence despite having no foot rest, and Natasha was light and agile enough to leap onto a ledge that faced into the pathway.
"Yeah, one more; it's this guy, Tony" Steve offered Buck a wry grin, "He's a bit much sometimes; never really knows how to turn himself off, but he'll calm down if you have a headache. He's also a tested and proven genius, according to him."
"You've changed a lot" And it was true, James had grown out from lithe and lean, to bulking with muscle in a way Steve had not expected. It suited him, even with the long hair.
"Just around; I've got an apartment downtown I'm sharing with this guy, v'been looking for a better place for a few weeks"
nothing bad" Tony chimed in grumpily; he was sitting on their green armchair -the one that had a rip down the side that had made the price go down by half (Natasha had been the one to put the rip there when the clerk wasn't looking)- and was tinkering grumpily with a CD player they had looted a few months ago.
And its true; the score was huge, and there were almost a dozen neatly wrapped pounds of the drug hidden neatly under the floorboard.
Finally, after a few minutes of painstaking search, Natasha saw a seam in the floorboard that looked wider than the others, as though it had been pulled up often. She kneels over to check, and pulls a screwdriver from her pocket to try and weasel it through.
"Oh sorry, sorry" Steve moved out the way hurriedly, accidentally snagging his ankle on the side of the girl's cart. White hot pain shot down his leg, and he hissed.
It didn't take long for all three of them to shuffle their way upstairs; Steve's backpack was completely filled to the brim with what looked like a blender coming out through the zip. Tony was in the middle of trying to convince him to let Tony sneak an electric razor into
"Yeah, I know" Steve laughed, "A bit sheltered; you should've seen him the first time he rode on a public bus, he went crazy"
"What impressive aim you have there" laughed Thor heartily, as Bruce back at the apartment prodded at his leg carefully.
"Pish posh, Nat; we have all the time in the world. It's not often we get sent to scavenge houses, let along absolute
Natasha nudges his foot, warning him to hurry up so they don't look suspicious. He hums at her in response, and to anyone else it might've looked as though he hadn't heard and was being dismissive, but she knows him and all his quirks and relaxes, satisfied that he'd heard.
He'd just gotten himself into an acceptable rhythm, murmuring to himself quietly, when something stopped him just a few blocks from the apartment.
"Oh, of course; if not a little arrogant at times, but he always means well, and is the most honest person I've ever met"
someone who judged him at face value. It was a testament to how fake and plastic his upbringing was, filled with businessmen and nannies who almost always had ulterior motives. Steve just hoped Tony would behave.
There was no response, and Nat knew he was too busy talking to the others to have heard her comment. The thing about their radios was that they could only connect to the one central receiver, which was Clint's radio back in the van. This meant that in order to communicate, they had to have one person on the outskirts playing the middle man. It was hardly ideal, but Tony always got mad when they complained about it.
He thinks better of it though, and instead turns back around to bring the groceries upstairs and into the apartment.
Every room Natasha walked into had no light switches, and turned on automatically without prompt. Heat detectors, she figured, but worried that perhaps this would mean that someone was being alerted of their arrival here. She made sure to move even more quickly through the various rooms to compensate.
Together, the four of them filled the two backpacks with the cocaine dutifully, though quickly. They were eager to leave soon, because they knew- even if their intel claimed that whoever lived here wouldn't be returning for a few days- that staying longer than an hour was too risky.
They all three looked at each other with matching expressions of panic, before Tony reached down and grabbed the device to inspect it.
"After that, we met this guy, Thor, at a market. He's Norwegian, speaks a bit funny, and was trying to convince this lady at her stand to trade his krona for food. Guess we sort of picked him up somehow"
he was glad to have put on so much muscle so quickly, if only because it made it easier to carry groceries, and throw coffee machines at thugs.
She is frozen and assesses the room with a revised level of scrutiny, looking for and finding things he can't even begin to understand. Finally, she nods, and he smiles cheekily, excitedly.
The rest of his time in the supermarket, Steve found himself sneaking glances at Peggy whenever he could. She caught him once or twice, much to his horror, but never told him off.
The back door of the van slams shut, and Tony, along with Natasha, makes his way idly through towards the door with a practised ease.
She had a crisp English accent, something Steve had never heard outside of television and he chuckled nervously, "Yeah, sorry, bad habit; helps me think"
Just there, sitting on someone's garden wall, was James Buchanan Barnes with the same charming grin he's always had. His eyes were a little duller, hair a
There's a distrustful set to Bucky's shoulders, one that Steve knew Tony would notice. The boy never did know when to back down from a challenge though, and Steve knew that it was a matter of time before Tony said something cutting and ruined any chance of the two being friends.
"Not now, Jarv" Said Tony in a sing-songy voice, staring ahead at Thor with such an intense gaze it's as though he was trying to glare him into getting to them faster.
"Yes" Thor agrees, "Perhaps it is here he will find that which he has been searching for; this so called,
Natasha frowned tensely, "You know as well as I do the less time we spend here the better" She reminds him, but she doesn't wait for him to come around, and instead begins making her way upstairs.
He wishes he was more like Thor, Clint and Tony, who had never been shy when introducing themselves to new dames they thought were good looking. It was both impressive and embarrassing to watch them display themselves like peacocks to any willing viewer. Bruce and Natasha, at least, had tact. Well. Not so much Bruce.
"I noticed all the lights turned on automatically when you walk into the room" Natasha said with realisation, "That must've been to make sure this got triggered if someone were to get into the stash, like we are now"
He catches the coke with one hand as she throws it to him, and with the other begins to unzip his backpack.
"Well, when we were still driving between states, sleeping here and there, we found him smoking a cigar outside a Mcdonalds; Him and Bruce hit it off, and he just invited himself along"
"Bingo!" He exclaimed, holding up a hairdryer and looking to fit the part of a mad scientist completely, "What a gorgeous little lady!"
"If we're not worried about looking suspicious walking out anymore, then I'm taking this baby with me" He tells her, and together they scale down the building.
The upstairs is just as normal, if not expensive looking, as the downstairs, with smooth wooden floorboards, and bright ornate lamps.
Natasha goes first to test the footing, since she is least likely to fall, and they go round so that they can escape through to an alleyway.
"Hiya, Captain" He said happily, walking over with confidence. He had that guarded look on his face that he reserved for everyone that wasn't their crew, and a tiger-like gaze as he looked Bucky up and down with scrutiny, "Who's this guy?"
They reach the door after a few seconds of walking up the driveway, and Natasha takes the keys off Tony as he offers them to her.
He looks at her with wide eyes for a few more seconds, before rolling his eyes with an enthusiasm only an ex-rich boy could conjure.
Despite the bickering, Natasha smiled to herself. She was relieved to be back at the apartment, where she could see all of her boys were safe and sound in front of her. She would never admit it, but she worried about them constantly when they weren't around, and was never truly at ease until moments like
As they slid in, the doors closed on their side, but the doors on the other side stayed open for Thor, who was running towards them quickly.
He pulls at the collar on his polo shirt as it bites at his neck, and she frowns at her boring and bland white sneakers, so unworn they pinched at her toes. Despite this though, for all rights and purpose they both looked perfectly normal; an assuming pair, content and without bother.
It's annoying that he couldn't bring the van, but Natasha and Bruce were using it to move some product for Fury downtown.
Steve was beginning to get uncomfortable with how tense the two were beside each other. Tony was just being Tony, but
"And it's attached to a transmitter, which I'm guessing alerts someone higher up that we're here" Tony says, and grins, "Brilliant"
The cart Steve was pushing had something jammed in one of its wheels, which made it annoying for him to push. He had to keep most of his weight on one side of the handle bar to get it to move straight, which was tricky since he had to stop completely just to look at the grocery list.
"I don't want to have sex," Tony says. He doesn't realize the words have left his mouth till he hears them, and then he reflexively whirls towards Steve to see how he needs to protect himself from his reaction.
– But then he remembers the night before, Clint's party, and dancing with Tony in his arms, and Tony saying "Take me home" and meaning something beyond that, and kissing each other to sleep –
Tony's pressed into the bed too much, though, and Steve can't get at enough of him from this angle. With a glance at Tony's face for permission Steve scoops up his trembling thighs and pulls them over his shoulders, then gets distracted nibbling and sucking at the smooth skin beneath sparse hair on Tony's inner thighs.
"Oh god, Steve," Tony says, and it sure does sound like he's having a good time. Steve settles in, putting his weight on his chest so his hands can run up and down Tony's thighs, unable to keep himself from pressing his own aching cock into the bed and moaning at the little bit of relief.
This time when he wraps Tony up in his arms Tony shifts, too, and before Steve realizes what's happening Tony's completely beneath him, his knees barely bent but silky-hot thighs spread around Steve's stomach.
When he turns around, both Tony and Mr Jarvis are staring at him. He smiles, trying desperately not to look smug.
"That's Clint," Steve says. "Clint Barton. Owns the piece of land borders ours to the east. He's a good sort; plans most of the parties and get-togethers hereabout. He'll be eager to meet you once you're settled in, Tony."
"All right," Steve says. "Hope you like it. If there's anything you'd like to change or if you want seconds just let me know." Tony frowns at him and Steve smiles and turns to go downstairs.
It was a wonder that they even found time for one another. Their dates were scarce and far apart, but somehow they made it work. Steve was halfway in his uniform and Tony was heading for his workshop. An alarm to assemble had woken them up after a rare night together and they were rushing to their positions. Before Tony could disappear, he turned to Steve and pulled him into a chased goodbye kiss. Neither of them lingered and in the next moment the two of them was ready to tackle whatever the villains decided to throw at them. They would always savor these kind of kisses, because they both knew it might be their last.
"My advertisement was a smashing success," Steve says, tipping Tony's chin up to catch his eye. "I was lonely and I just wanted someone else about the place, and instead because of it you found me."
Steve wakes the next day hazy with anticipation. He tumbles out of bed, washes and dresses before he's even fully awake, he's so eager to get downstairs and so hopeful that Tony will be there.
This isn't a ploy, either. I'm not showing you some of my secrets because I want you to return the favor. This isn't a trade, all right? Yes, I do want you to understand that if you chose to tell me what happened I'll listen with love and go right on loving you, because I know that's what you'll do when you read these secrets of mine, but I hope that just
At last Tony looks away – perhaps in shyness, perhaps in discomfort – and Steve finally remembers to let go of his hand. But when he makes so bold as to offer Tony his arm, Tony actually smiles at him when he puts his hand gently in the crook of Steve's elbow.
