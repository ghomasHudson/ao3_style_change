Then Steve let his cock out of his mouth. Tony was confused for whole three seconds before Steve’s fingers started to hit the spot inside of him again, now quick, almost mechanical. He palmed Tony’s lower stomach with his free hand, just above Tony’s cock so that it came to rest against the back of his hand, and pressed down slightly. He knew exactly what he was doing, and if Tony’s eyes weren’t rolling towards the back of his head, he could have watched how an obscure amount of pre-cum soon leaked from the tip of his cock, provoked by the attack on his prostate.
”Since you’ve gone through all this trouble to dress up for me”, his silky voice continues as he stands up and takes off his underwear, ”I’m going to fuck you…”, he straddles Steve’s chest, and Steve can’t decide whether to listen or to stare at Tony’s cock, the cock Tony gives a few lazy pumps and then brings between Steve’s pecs. “… right here.”
That’s thirty-three hours. Thirty-three hours since Nat woke him up and he met with the doctor. The time between had felt so much longer than that, and like it was never going to end. But the reality is that he’d been ready to give up in less than two days.
Steve lies down to the other side of the bed and reaches to kiss Emmett on the forehead. When he lifts his face, he sees Tony looking at him, his eyes shining with tears. Careful of Emmett, Steve moves closer to Tony and kisses him.
Steve’s first instinct is to aggressively shake his head, but he doesn’t. He could if he really wanted to, but he prefers to not really have his own will exist in this world. Only Tony’s, and Tony can take pictures of him gagged and tied, wearing lingerie and a skirt, if he likes. In fact, Steve’s not entirely sure if he has allowed that or not, but he knows that Tony knows.
Steve only hummed in response. It was true that the wound still had an odor, but it wasn’t as bad as Tony made it sound like. More importantly, it was getting more faint day by day, which was one of the small things that Steve paid more meticulous attention to than he allowed Tony to be aware of. The alpha was annoyed by the inability his wound caused him, and Steve wanted to let him not have to think about it all the time. But
Steve looks at them helplessly. It’s relieving to see Kieran in Tony’s arms, but it’s also a reminder of how big of a failure he himself is. His lower lip quivers as he thinks of how disappointed Tony must be in him.
Steve wakes up in panic. His heart is racing, and his body aches like he’s having a fever. Nat is standing next to the bed and gripping his shoulder.
”Come on, I’m sure we’ve got more important things to discuss”, he continues, pulling the door to the conference room open.
”I’m sorry, sir”, Steve says quickly. He’s meant to say that when he makes a mistake, and ”thank you, sir” after he gets a punishment or a reward. Other than that, he only speaks when he’s asked to.
”Nat?” Steve says quietly after a moment. She hums in response. ”I’m so sorry. I could see you made each other happy.”
When Steve had come down enough, he felt Tony pull out. A hand wrapped around Steve’s trembling body.
He comes hard, his rim violently trying to lock in a knot that isn’t there. It’s painful, and Steve whimpers. Why isn’t his alpha here?
”My beautiful alpha”, he mutters, placing a kiss to the notch between Tony’s collarbones, then to his lips. As they open their eyes after, Steve gets caught looking at Tony’s eyes, especially his lower eyelashes that create a gorgeous dark frame under his eyes.
It takes a while, but eventually Steve’s mind starts to dull enough to the situation he’s looking at that his sobs die down and it starts to feel like there’s enough air again. The doctor’s words ring in his ears.
”And when I thought that I wanted to die, I thought about –” Steve laughs sadly, his eyes getting wet – ”I thought about your beard scratching me when you kiss me.”
Bucky knows that he’s biased, but he thinks Stark should be counting his lucky stars to have someone like Steve. But even more than that, he knows that Steve shouldn’t be just rolling over and letting his mate go.
There are fights, but they’re controllable, and instead of storming off they begin to sort them out by talking. Steve explains Tony his thoughts, and Tony talks about his feelings, and it’s not always pretty but at the best of times an argument ends with them holding hands comfortingly over the table in hopeful silence.
”Tell me”, Steve encourages, and Tony tells him about Peter and Strange, about Ebony Maw, about Titan, about Peter Quill and the whole weird quartet that had showed up, the battle with Thanos. He goes quiet as he tells how Peter had turned into ashes in his arms, how everyone except him and Nebula had vanished. About how they’d ended up stranded in space with air about to go out and how “the glowing woman”, as he calls Carol, had showed up at the final hour.
That’s good, Tony thinks, that will work. He can have a clear conscience about not abandoning his omega, and they still won’t ever have to see each other at home.
Tony brushed his cheek against Steve’s head. ”That you would, sweet cheeks. But I’ll see what I can do.”
The door to the room opens. Steve lifts his face to see Bruce standing at it. He had been so absorbed in his thoughts that he hadn’t even heard the man approaching.
He’s just about to burst into explanations when Tony suddenly shoots off the bed, his hand pressed to his mouth. In approximately two seconds he has vanished into the bathroom, pulling the door closed after him with a loud bang.
”I- I don’t- I don’t want to break- break the bond”, Steve begins to pour out between his sobs. ”I never- I never should’ve said that-”
After a moment, Tony stills his hips, forcing some self-control upon himself. He wants to be closer to Steve, to feel with his whole body how his omega trembles against him when he comes, to feel Steve’s entire body’s warmth. Steve is tractable like a doll as Tony pushes him gently back against the mattress and settles down to spoon him again, sliding his arm carefully under Steve’s head.
Thinking back to the conversation between them not two hours ago, Steve realises Tony’s right. He’s just promised him access to his thoughts and feelings.
Nat pads around the bed and Steve closes his eyes again. He hears Nat take her shoes and some clothing off, then feels the bed dip slightly under her weight. It’s not completely unfamiliar, since they’ve shared a bed a couple of times before on missions. On those occasions she hasn’t pressed her back against Steve’s for comfort.
”Maybe I should get one”, Steve says dryly, not looking at Tony. He’s pushing the food around his plate apathetically.
”I owe my life to that lady. Both of them, really. Must thank them”, he finishes, and Steve breaks into tears at the realisation of how close he came to losing Tony.
Tony freezes, fork in mid-air. They have explicitly avoided the subject of sex, and Tony has been in the understanding that they were doing that because they both knew they still had quite a bit of healing to do before that would be back on the table. But Steve’s voice is unhappy, the hint underneath his joke loud and clear.
With a warm smile, Tony drinks in the sight of Steve’s peaceful face, his content expression and restfully closed eyes. He does really look like a cat in the sun, and it is easily one of the most beautiful things Tony has ever seen. He lays his chin on Steve’s shoulder and caresses his cheek with the back of his finger lightly.
The toy brings Steve to yet another orgasm. It’s dry and unsatisfying, and Steve’s body convulses forcefully, his teeth gritting together. Angrily, Steve pulls the thing out and throws it away, sending it flying across the room. He breathes shallowly through his teeth.
He pulled out and maneuvered Tony gently onto his back, then sat back to his knees to wipe away the tears from his eyes with a self-deprecating laugh.
”You can lie your head down. First, turn so that you can still see the mirror while being comfortable.”
Of course, Steve hadn’t dropped him. He had still dragged Tony downstairs with him to get the food and once again, decided to deliver.
. It’s not like Tony’s out of the loop in any way, but Steve is simply unmatched when it comes to things like these. And although his enhanced memory surely helps, it’s not just that; Steve’s constantly tuned in to make sure he doesn’t miss a thing.
to be just a needy puddle in Tony’s lap, wanted it like it was where he was born to be. It wasn’t difficult to become just that when Tony’s finger started moving inside of him. Steve moved with it, his cheek falling to rest on Tony’s shoulder, tiny noises leaving his throat. He closed his eyes and let his body follow the pleasure, rocking gently back and forth in Tony’s lap.
Used to the banter, Steve just pressed his lips to Tony’s. His fingers found their way into Tony’s hair, and Tony gladly allowed Steve’s tongue to invade his mouth. It quickly turned into a game of little back- and forth bites and licks, and Tony thought he was winning for a while, but then Steve’s hand curled tighter into his hair and Tony sighed, his jaw going slack. Steve nibbled his lower lip for a final argument, then pulled back.
When the silence seems to just go on and on, Steve finally lifts his face to look at Tony. It takes a long time before Tony answers his stare, but when he does, Steve can feel the colour vanishing from his face. Tony’s eyes are hard to read, but they hold him in place. The bond feels almost like it had felt on that day on the airport in Germany. Cold and unreceptive.
Steve opened the fridge door, searching for whole milk with his eyes. Unsuccessful, he blinked, and went through the fridge systematically again before admitting defeat. There was none. Grudgingly, he took the soy milk and poured some onto his coffee.
”Morning. Uh, yeah, very unlikely”, he confirms, smiling a tad awkwardly. ”Listen, I’m very sorry, but there’s been a misunderstanding. I don’t actually need you here today.”
”Could you please take Kit for a while?” he asks, smelling the crying baby for a second time just to be sure. ”I think he just wants to be held, but I’ve got that call, and I also finally managed to get Emmy asleep and I really want to keep him asleep –”
”Twelve point five percent”, Tony whispers then, and Steve looks at him inquisitively. Tony’s forefinger rubs the back of Steve’s palm.
Fifteen minutes later they are sitting in a warm bath, Steve’s back leaned against Tony’s chest. Tony wraps his arms around Steve, pressing his face into his still dry hair.
He kissed Steve, his fingers stroking through Steve’s messy hair, and it was so soft it made Steve light-headed. He was worn and happy and Tony’s tongue felt so good against his, soothing and familiar. Tony went on to lick the mess from his chin, placing a couple of kisses here and there in the process.
”Jesus, Steve”, Tony somehow managed to word, breathless. His head was spinning and his heart beating like an old washing machine slinging. ”Satisfied?”
Sure, he still hasn’t had his heat after giving birth, but he has just lost a child and doesn’t know if his alpha is alive or not. He can not imagine how his body could suddenly pull a stunt like this under all the grief and stress he is. His mind works fast as he tries to think of what’s gonna happen next.
”No. I’m sorry”, Steve mutters, nuzzling his face against Tony’s shoulder. He sniffs. ”I’m okay. Just overwhelmed.”
As his eyes meet Steve’s, Tony realises that he’s shaking. Steve, on the other hand, looks calm, even though he cannot possibly be that. Tony’s throat feels dry as he answers.
The way they end up dating isn’t the most romantic one. Alcohol is heavily involved on Tony’s part, and – perhaps fittingly for them – the whole thing gets its start from an argument. The topic of the argument in itself is stupid and nothing serious, hardly an argument at all.
”Yes”, Tony agrees. His hand moves from Steve’s cock to grab his ass, pushing him down on his cock. ”Go ahead, baby. Take what’s yours.”
Tony stomps to him determinedly and kisses him. There’s something in his eyes that makes Steve want to grab him and beg him not to go, and it’s probably only the fact that his hands are occupied that keeps him from doing it.
”You invented a suit that will come and fold around you in less than five seconds no matter where you are. I’m fairly sure that if you’ll ever ask my help with diapers it’ll be out of sheer spite ”, he huffed instead.
Tony studies him, reaching to stroke his hair, and Steve closes his eyes, unable to bear the empathy on Tony’s face.
Some days Steve just wanted to hide Tony from the world. He wasn’t ready to let anything or anyone ever hurt Tony again, ever try to take him away from him again.
To his slight surprise, Steve gets his meaning right away. Well, it helps that the song is at the chorus again.
Steve freezes as he notices the teenager sitting at the kitchen table with a can of soda placed in front of him. Peter Parker shoots up as if to greet him, but nothing seems to come out of his mouth. He stares at Steve with wide eyes.
”I – I’d also allow them to be there when I take care of myself. Even worse, allow them to touch themselves. I decided that myself, Tony”, he says, disgusted at himself. ”I just… I thought –”
Steve’s whole body is shaking viciously, and if he’d been struggling to keep his weight on his hands before, now he really has to fight to stay in position. Slowly, he lifts his face up to see himself in the mirror. His face is red from the exertion, and even though the pain is easing every second now, he can’t seem to stop the tears from falling.
The silence prevails, but after a minute it’s disturbed by the sheets rustling as Steve reaches back with his hand, offering it. Tony grips it gratefully. Steve’s hand is soft and smooth in his slightly calloused one, and Tony needs more. But beggars can’t be choosers, so Tony just turns to his side to be able to hold Steve’s hand with both of his.
Since he’s been ordered to his knees, Steve assumes that he’s meant to crawl, so that’s what he does. His eyes are fixed on Tony as he slowly makes his way toward the bed, and it should feel silly, but it doesn’t. There’s something about Tony, about his energy when they play like this, that commands the whole room so effortlessly and elegantly. It doesn’t leave much room for Steve to feel embarrassed.
Not much time is wasted on the pleasantries. Tony sits beside him, leaving enough room between them to fit at least one person or alternatively, the hostile air between them. The therapist sits into her chair, crossing her legs and eyeing them for a second.
Steve gave JARVIS a long list of take-out to order, ignoring how Tony’s brows rose amusedly as he listened to him go on and on.
Steve gapes at him, colour creeping up his neck. Tony walks away before they’re at a shouting match.
”Well, you’re a little buzzed”, Steve had pointed out casually, and he never could have been prepared for Tony’s answer.
”My gorgeous alpha”, he couldn’t stop himself from mumbling, kissing Tony’s shoulder as he felt his own cock immediately become interested. He half expected Tony to tell him to stop and move on, but he didn’t. Steve saw that his eyes were closed again but there was an anticipating expression on his face.
to the caller. Steve had no idea what he was talking about but his confident, steady voice made Steve’s cock weep and he kept trying to keep his moans in check. Every muffled noise he made against Tony’s hand made Tony press it down twice as hardly.
you’ll be fine?” Thor asks suddenly from his chair. Steve turns to look at him. Only now Steve realises that he sounds drunk.
Thor lays his hand to Steve’s stomach and Steve screams until he’s finally blessed with losing consciousness.
in his mind. He rode his orgasm shakily until his knot filled fully, not allowing him much movement anymore. After that he collapsed on top of Steve like a wet rag.
”I won’t”, Tony promises, going ahead and beginning to massage Steve’s perineum, teasing. He feels some slick sticking to his fingertips, but there isn’t much. ”Okay?”
”Oh,” Tony snorts at the AI, not amused. ”Oh, you think you’re clever now, do you? Well, you’re entirely missing the point of the song. ’Bad medicine’ is a person.”
”I really do like watching you work, by the way”, Steve confessed quietly. ”But I know I’d disturb you if I started hovering around all the time.”
Steve lifted himself up to see Tony’s face, and the possessiveness refused to let go of him, the sight of his injured mate making his mouth twitch again as he fought to hold in another growl.
”No”, Steve mumbles sleepily, then slowly hauls himself to sit on the edge of the bed with the blanket still wrapped around him. ”I don’t want them to think that I’m sick or something. Besides, I wanna see the monkeys off. I’m just gonna take a quick shower first.”
”What purpose does a funeral serve to you? You don’t believe in afterlife”, Steve says harshly, and there goes Tony’s patience, all of the fire under the ashes flaming inside of him.
She sets the package on top of a drawers table in the hallway and Steve thanks her, leaving the package be for now.
”No, I should’ve realised how drunk you were then. And I really didn’t think about the hangover at all. Sorry”, Steve said sheepishly, then continued with a twinkle in the eye. ”I’m all up for a comeback if you want, though. I’ll even call you daddy if you like.”
”, Steve goes on, more silently now, holding Tony close to him. It’s like every thrust is making him more and more emotional now, once again, and Tony guesses, rightly so, that he’s probably close. So he pushes himself up to see Steve properly and give him some space.
“Okay, that’s enough from you, here’s your tip, thank you”, Tony had stopped Steve, shoving a stupidly big bill into the awkwardly smiling delivery guy’s hand and pushing Steve back inside.
Tony sighs through his nose. ”Yeah, I’m sorry, that went too far.” It’s more the thing to say than an entirely sincere apology.
He tries to study the outfit with a practical eye. At least everything looks like it fits. Feels too, he guesses, if he ignores the inherent strangeness of it. But nothing’s bursting out where it shouldn’t be or looking like it’s about to rip apart. He turns to check the backside, and that’s when he first gets an idea of how this look could be considered flattering on him. The skirt is just long enough to cover his ass, teasing what’s hidden underneath quite nicely, if he says so himself. The way the corset laces travel over his back doesn’t look too bad either.
Once the worst hassle has settled, Steve sits down to chat and eat with her. He’s grown to like her, even if he felt miserable the first time she came to help take care of the twins, perhaps even a little jealous – at some point, she probably interacted more with Tony during the day than he did, which was completely Steve’s own doing. But beta’s tend to be preferred choices for babysitting for a reason, their steady, unthreatening presence creating harmony around them easily.
Steve gave him a little laugh, then moved to kiss him. His erection, still restrained by his boxers, poked Tony’s own as he pressed his body close, and Tony pushed against it, grunting. Steve took the cue and shuffled out of his only piece of clothing, kissing Tony again as he lubed himself up. He rolled Tony to his side effortlessly, coaxing his leg out of the way and pushed the head of his cock inside.
Will doesn’t always mean success. Steve’s grin fades as he lays his head lightly onto Tony’s stomach, cradling his uninjured arm in both of his, his fingers caressing Tony’s palm.
Steve takes her hand as the ship jumps, and Thor starts singing drunkenly in the back of the ship. Rhodey tells him to shut up, and surprisingly, Thor does. Steve didn’t particularly enjoy the singing either, but he still can’t help feeling sorry for Thor. It’s his way of dealing with this.
The sound of something knocking against his nightstand stirred him back awake. Turning, he saw that a glass of water had been placed on top of it for him. He watched Steve go around the bed towards his own, empty side, ruffling his hair with a towel as he walked. Tony considered the water for a second, then propped himself up to take a sip.
He’d known the moment Happy had answered the phone. Steve had heard a baby crying in the background, recognised it as Emmett.
Relieved that Tony apparently isn’t trying to call it quits, Steve shifts a little closer to him, his eyebrows knitting in compassion.
Tony doesn’t know how to explain it. But Thanos had brought the already destroyed mind stone back by rewinding time, and that wasn’t magic. Even if he’d had all the other stones to do that, it still wasn’t magic. It was physics. Everything is physics, and Tony knows physics.
Bucky’s brows furrow as he studies his friend in the light the fire throws onto Steve’s defeated demeanor like a judgement. He’s still Steve, the same kid from Brooklyn Bucky has known for as long as he can remember, the same who used to come with Bucky to steal apples from that old man’s farm and then go back two days later to apologize and offer to help with work to atone. The old man was always cranky as hell, and every time Steve swore that the next time he wouldn’t go and apologize anymore, and every time he did. Eventually, they grew up and stopped stealing apples, and little Steve became an adult who realized that the Steve who would go and apologize had always been right.
Eventually, he gives in. After a long staring match with a bottle of scotch, Tony finds himself finally beaten, a glass of the honey brown liquid in his hand. The bitterness of the alcohol is sweet on his tongue, burning his throat familiarly as he sinks the first drink down in a single shot.
”Is someone trying to steal from you?” Tony goes on, chuckling a little. Steve’s growling can actually totally disarm him in certain situations, but this is not one of those. This is just endearing, an accident.
Days go by. They start by making an effort to have dinner together every day. Sometimes they talk, but never about them, not about painful things. Sometimes they just sit in silence, and those days are often heavy, leaving Tony a discouraged, anxious mess for the rest of the day. But Steve always sends him feelings of understanding and patience, and it keeps Tony from going back to the bottle or overworking himself numb.
”Are you set on making this hard for us in more than one way?” he asks once he’s found his good side again.
Steve and Tony answer at the same time, Steve saying ”no” and Tony ”yes”. Bruce eyes them both, looking like he doesn’t have the energy for guessing. Steve gets up from the bed.
Peter’s only sixteen. Once again, it’s really not his business, but Steve can’t help thinking that a kid that age really should have some proper time off from protecting the neighbourhood. As a side note, being around small children was also supposed to have a good impact on young alphas who were still learning what being an alpha actually meant.
Taking off his reading glasses, Tony rubs his forehead. What he’s looking at is not time travel, but it’s something almost as unbelievable, and unbelievable is what Tony needs right now. But from data like this the experiments are hard to understand, never mind replicate. What he needs are Pym’s notes and calculations, the stuff the paranoid old man definitely hasn’t saved on a computer that Tony Stark could comfortably hack into. Which is any computer; the notes will be on good old-fashioned paper somewhere.
After he’s done, Steve steps into the shower, his cock hanging heavy between his legs. He washes himself, then just stands under the water stream feeling nauseous. Finally, he relents and takes his cock into his hand, trying to silence his mind. He strokes his cock mechanically in order to relieve himself.
”I think so.” Steve tries to sound as sure of himself as possible, even though he’s not that sure at all. He feels ominous, somehow, but he’s still not at the point where he’d be willing to have the god of thunder and whatnot present while he fucks himself with a nine-inch dildo.
For an answer, Steve mumbles his name out instantly, just to feel it on his tongue. He likes using Tony’s name.
”Really?” Tony asks quickly. ”You should be called that all the time. Yeah. From now on, I’m calling you nothing but ‘pretty one’ and that includes missions.”
Getting right back up, he pads silently past the twins and to the hallway, finding the package where the babysitter left it in the morning. It’s quite big, but thin, and not very heavy. Carefully, Steve rips the brown packing material open and pulls out a picture. There are colourful faces on a white background, and on the top left corner there’s a text: “Love”. The bottom left corner has the text “forever changes”. It takes a couple of seconds for Steve to realise that it’s a vinyl record – he didn’t remember right away that the album, which he very well recognises now, had a cover like this.
When he’s done, he locks Tony’s wrists above his head and begins a trail of kisses down his neck, occasionally nipping the skin lightly, and grinds his slick ass down to meet Tony’s cock. Tony’s hips jerk upwards uselessly.
Steve settles down, yawning so deep he thinks his jaw will dislocate. He snuggles as close to Tony as possible. ”Thank you. I love you. Please be quiet.”
Steve’s eyes found Tony’s. He hadn’t stopped his movements, only slowed them down, and he was staring at Steve. Steve was too hazy to read his expression for certain but he thought he saw a challenge somewhere in there.
“You’re so perfect, all that perfect porcelain and pink skin, all that muscle”, Tony mutters as he works his finger in and out teasingly. “You know what?” he asks, his voice like honey, his free hand caressing Steve’s lower back. “I think you know it. I think you know exactly how you make me feel, Steve.”
”You have to. I need mouth-to-dick first aid like yesterday”, Tony argued jokingly, giving in to a delicious stretch. Steve shook his head incredulously, but his eyes were warm.
There’s war, there’s going into the ice and waking up 70 years later. There’s some baggage involving his parents and his childhood in general, and even more baggage concerning the way his body was changed. But on every session, Steve finds himself eventually coming back to Tony and what happened between them after the Accords.
”So I can stay exactly here for at least twelve”, Steve said lazily, nuzzling his face against Tony.
Later Steve had admitted that a part of him had wanted to test Tony when they’d met, and Tony had laughed, endeared. That was before Steve had actually betrayed his trust out of loyalty to
”Good”, he tells Steve after a while, and he’s surprised by how low his own voice has become. This should be a calming moment for them, but Steve’s breath has grown shallow and he lifts his eyes to look at Tony in agony.
His slick has made such a mess of the bed again one’d think he’s peed himself. Slowly, Steve untangles himself from Thor’s embrace. It’s difficult, because his body wants to go back to the alpha’s arms instantly.
”You’re starting to remind me of that fella from the movie. John Nash”, Steve comments one day as he eyes the numerous calculations and models around the workshop. He doesn’t sound entirely like he’s joking.
His prediction didn’t seem entirely wrong, however, because when Steve turned to look at Tony, the alpha twitched, looked startled for a second, and then turned his head to blink at him sleepily.
The finger pushed into him. Tony sighed gratefully, hopefully, as he felt the digit first just feel him carefully, but then Steve slid it further, quickly finding his prostate with the experience of someone who had found it countless times before. Tony had
When there’s no answer, Steve turns to look at Tony and realises that there are tears in his eyes. Are they for him? He takes Tony’s hand silently, sorry that he has made him feel that bad.
”Oh, honey”, Tony sighs, pulling Steve’s head into an embrace. ”Shh.” He pets Steve’s hair comfortingly. ”You’re not in pain, are you?”
”Oh, I know what that look means”, Tony croons. Steve pulls him close, pressing his lips to his neck.
Steve nearly cried out of frustration, but Tony didn’t seem to care – he leaned down and placed soothing kisses onto his chest, practically bending Steve in half in the process. Despite his impatience, Steve couldn’t stop himself from pushing a hand into Tony’s hair, his fingers running through it shakily and ending up trailing the line of his beard. Tony leaned into the touch for a moment, closing his eyes. Then he took Steve’s hand and kissed his palm, before making his way to the pulse point in his wrist, sucking at it gently. Steve clenched around him and Tony gave him a tender hum of appreciation.
”But I guess I hurt you too. And I… I just can’t see a future without you. There’s no… no other way to live, really.”
On their first date they just have dinner on the roof. Or that’s how Tony puts it when he suggests it to Steve; just a simple dinner on the roof. When Steve shows up there on the agreed hour, however, the sight is breathtaking; there’s gorgeous lighting put up everywhere, there’s flowers, there’s a beautifully set table with a tablecloth so perfectly white it looks unreal. And Tony’s there, looking dashing in his suit and bowtie as he greets Steve with a smile that makes Steve weak in the knees.
Fifteen minutes later, he returns to the kitchen to find Tony setting up the table and Peter holding a sleeping baby in his arms. It’s a little unnerving, but just because the only time Steve has seen his baby in the arms of anyone else than himself, Tony, or the babysitter, was when Natasha came to see them a couple of weeks ago. Nat seems like a surprisingly natural caretaker, a sensible beta with an admirable mix of the fierceness of an alpha and the sensitiveness of an omega.
”I’m sure Emmy could’ve slept at the dinner. It wasn’t a very loud gathering”, Nat tells, chagrined, and Steve feels sorry for her. She tries so hard.
”You will do no such thing, omega”, he jokes gently, although he emphasises the last word meaningfully.
“Mm-h”, Tony commented, continuing to tease him. “What do you want, Steve?” His grip around Steve’s ankle tightened.
There’s a small note taped to the backside. It says: “You don’t know how much I love you”, a piece of lyrics from one of the songs. It’s in Tony’s handwriting.
When Steve begins to open Tony’s fly, he’s silent and careful like he’s doing something sacred. Tony itches to still his omega’s unsteady hands and take over, but he lets Steve finish the job, stroking his hair as he watches him do it.
It was late, the TV that was on in the background the only source of light in the living room. Steve had managed to get the boys to sleep an hour ago, after which he’d figured that Tony needed the rest and taken a bit of time just for himself before coming to wake him up.
The twins tend to soothe each other, so they share a crib. The downside is that they also often wake each other up if one starts crying. Kieran is the one crying now – Emmett is still silent, but he’s eyeing his surroundings with a scrunched-up face, kicking the air irritatedly.
But Tony didn’t move his hand from Steve’s mouth. He leaned in, staring at Steve, who was now whining against his hand openly, and there was a mischievous glint in his eyes.
With a protestive grunt, he turns his back to the clock again, nuzzling against Steve’s warm, naked body under the sheets comfortably. Even after seven years with kids, Tony’s still not a morning person.
”The doctor warned us about that”, Nat confesses. ”Don’t worry about Emmy, Steve. I promise that we’ll make sure he’s got everything he needs while you get yourself through this.”
At first Steve’s only relieved to be rid of the nightmarish heat, to be alive and to be able to be with Emmett again. But then he realises that he might not only ever go into heat or have children again, he might not be able to enjoy sex all together anymore. He supposes he should try, alone, to see whether he can even get slick, or if his male organs still at least work. But the mere thought repulses him, so he doesn’t. He guesses that if Tony isn’t alive anymore, it doesn’t even matter.
”What?” His first thought is that Pepper’s talking about Steve’s depression, but it would be an odd thing to bring up now. Besides, Pepper should be aware that Steve had been better for months before Thanos.
”Really not funny”, Tony says, sitting up and trying to soothe his satanic headache by massaging his temples.
Tony reaches his face, and Steve peeks at him, his face pressed into the pillows. A tender smile greets him before Tony leans to kiss his temple.
”He wasn’t enough. He wasn’t you, and his scent couldn’t soothe me enough. I just gave up; my body gave up. I could feel that I was dying, and the worst thing is that I was happy about it”, Steve admits, trying to wipe his tears off. It’s useless; new ones keep spilling faster than he can dry them. ”So selfish, when I think about it now. But I just missed you so much, and it hurt, and I felt like I couldn’t take another breath without you. I guess – I think I was literally dying of grief. The only thing that saved me was that when I let go and closed my eyes, I saw you. And you –”, Steve’s breath hitches at the painful memory, stopping his broken voice for a second – ”you were begging me not to go.”
Tony removed his fingers from Steve, left his leaking cock alone. He pressed his crotch against the cleft of Steve’s ass, and Steve groaned, feeling Tony’s erection against him through the fabric. It was the only thing he could think of, and he opened his eyes to beg with them.
”Funny word, ’late’”, he had started in that infuriatingly chipper tone of his. Clint had drowned his own glass empty in a manner that told that he knew exactly what was coming and wasn’t going to be there for it.
Steve affirms, and they leave the shower. In bed, Tony wraps his arms around Steve familiarly, whispering good night against his neck, and Steve nuzzles his face against the arm Tony’s placed under his head, holding onto his hand. In less than five minutes, he’s asleep.
Tony turns to look at him with an expression that reveals to Steve that he knows exactly how long they have been at it already, that he is drawing it out on purpose just to make Steve more desperate.
His omega. Not so proud right now, but beautiful in a different way, with the vulnerable glint in his eyes, the nervous strain in his shoulders. It makes Tony’s chest tight, and as endearing as it is in a way, he wants to see Steve flourish again, see him happy.
Tony inhales, trembling with lust as Steve smudges his lips with slick. Something changes in the alpha - he closes his eyes, his breath turning short and tight. The feeling the bond channels to him makes Steve shiver – it’s not quite a threat, but it still feels like a warning. Steve keeps moving his finger on Tony’s lips, slowly and lightly, hardly daring to breathe. Every cell in his body is telling him to stop, to not tease an alpha this way, but it’s just a biological reaction and he doesn’t care because he’s hypnotised. Besides, he knows he can trust Tony.
”I understand”, the doctor says, apparently realising that there’s no benefit in trying to make Steve believe anything else than what he does. ”Normally – as in on Earth – a mate’s passing away can usually be felt, but I can’t recall hearing about a case like yours. I can try to find out if there’s anything and get back to you on that, but right now you need to focus on surviving this heat.”
Tony’s surprised at first, but when he thinks about it for a second, he does remember at least joking about it quite a few times... and now Steve thinks that he’s let him down.
”Steve, honey, no”, he says before he can stop himself, pulling at Steve’s hand, because yes, it’s touching and traditional but right now, he just needs to feel Steve’s skin against his, fuck the ceremonies.
He leans to card his hand through his hair, glancing at the clock on the wall. It’s almost ten in the evening, and it has long since gotten dark outside. The atmosphere out there is anything but dark, though.
“Would it be enough for a start that I enjoy it? Obviously I want it to be the both of us, but if you’re feeling uncomfortable, maybe we should try to, you know, just concentrate on me for a start”, Tony suggests, hoping he doesn’t come off as selfish because that’s really not what it’s about, but finding a way to get Steve to relax. He kisses Steve’s jaw, lowering his voice a little. ”Then, if you feel like it, I’ll gladly shower you with attention.”
”I’m just – ah – in a compromised state”, Tony answered, but Steve saw that the corner of his mouth was curving upwards.
Tony’s anger seems to have worn off completely now. Instead, he sounds sad when he starts talking about feeling like Steve hasn’t trusted him. It eventually starts to shift Steve’s mood too.
”I don’t know.” Steve’s voice is colourless, his eyes fixed into the distance. ”I don’t know”, he repeats after a while, turning to look at Bucky. He wipes away a tear that rolls to his cheek.
”I feel like the word ’love’ doesn’t even cover it anymore, Steve”, Tony continues. ”But before they come up with something worthy of you – of us – I guess it’ll have to do.”
For a while they just stare at each other, their noses brushing together, sharing a vulnerable wordlessness. Their lower stomach’s are slippery from precum from Steve’s cock that’s pressed between their bodies, and Tony slows down for a bit, concentrating all of his senses on how hot and wet and easy and perfect everything is. They belong together, like this.
Tony kisses him and it’s all grief, but they have each other to share it with. Steve presses his body close, pulling Tony against him like he’s afraid he’ll evaporate, and Tony touches him everywhere, his fingers working as a tool for the mental map he’s drawing inside of his head. A map of Steve, of every nook in his body, that works as proof that Steve’s still here.
It’s a nice memory. So is their next date, which escalates into a rather steamy making out session on the couch. On their third date they have the
God, Tony’s hand on him, his words, they feel so good. Steve’s been feeling so unworthy of love and affection, feeling like he’s got nothing to offer to Tony. He feels his emotions aching in his chest and closes his eyes, focusing on the sensation of Tony’s hands on him. He deserves this, he reassures himself, gathering his self-confidence.
”No. I sent them to college. Thought it was high time”, Steve answers dryly, not taking his eyes off the window.
Tony had always been so good to him, Steve thought as he leaned down to kiss Tony’s back. He more than deserved to be taken care of for a change.
”I’m not sure it’s a good idea for us to go into that now, honey.” He hopes the pet name will help Tony leave it at that, to no avail.
There is nothing that could’ve prepared Steve for the euphoria of getting his own child into his arms. Kieran, as they soon decide he’s called, meets his eyes after a bit of searching, and Steve forgets how to breathe. The whole world disappears from around him, a warmth unlike anything he’s ever felt washing over him. The small human being pressed against him blinks tiredly and he’s perfect, the bond drowning Steve with a sense of belonging together and such a pure feeling of love it’s hard to comprehend. He takes a sharp breath, tears streaming down his cheeks, and whispers a choked “hello”.
”The hell we will”, Steve mutters. Emmett babbles curiously as the three of them march after him. He keeps a slight distance, though, approaching the visitors more carefully than Tony since he has the twins with him.
It’s not that the act of wearing lingerie and the rest of it is appalling to him in itself, or he probably never would’ve uttered out those words that led him here. Honestly, it’s hotter than Steve thinks it has any right to be, even more so because of the effect – he hopes – it will have on Tony. He’s just not that into actually seeing himself like this.
A shadow scurried past him but he didn't notice until his nostrils were filled with the dizzying smell. A very particular fragrance, undetermined. A musky body scent mixed so deliciously with expensive cologne. A luxury few boys indulged in at their school. Must be a rich kid thing. Or just a passing fancy.
"Let's go to bed now, babe. What do you say?" He suggested after some time. "We still have a couple of hour to get some sleep before we need to get up." And then he whispered softly, so gently into his tousled hair. "I love you."
Steve didn't understand. Just because they roughed him up a little... That didn't mean he was unwilling. Tony had agreed to everything, surely he had, one way or another. He denied it firmly. He thought he did anyway and then he added, "You know I can't go to the hospital." Because a hospital was the last place he wanted to be in right now. He just wanted to go home, have a shower and cuddle with Steve. That was all he wanted. Steve would help soothe his growing anxiety.
Tony laughed loudly, his deep guttural laugh, and threw his head back. His smile a little smug. Then he turned back to Steve, eyes shining intently, honest and pure. "Thank you babe." He whispered sensually. "It a sweet surprise and a great idea."
Tony was exhausting himself trying to justify the unjustifiable. He couldn't blame his boyfriend for being mad. He had nothing to say for himself, truly nothing. He just... He had been counting on Steve's usually patient and forgiving nature a little, hoping he wouldn't have to fight for the third time today, but Steve didn't seem to be inclined to show him either. Who could blame him? Certainly not Tony.
All sorts of emotions pooled in Tony's eyes who stared up at him with blissful gratitude, unable to express his feelings. Steve felt his heart skip a beat, a surge of affection flushed through him.
Tony stared at him with confusion, lips parted. Steve paused and stared back, catching his breath. His chest was heaving. "
"You think I can sleep?" Steve asked, trying to ignore Tony's ambiguous question. After all, Steve still had his apartment.
Steve is staring at him from across the table, his gaze is burning but gentle and supportive. Tony's heart skips a beat but again, he ignores the feeling. Steve gives him a gentle smile that rocks his world again. It's too much for Tony who drops his gaze on his tablet again, he changes hands to keep his right hand busy, still feeling self-conscious. Sharing breakfast with Steve is too unsettling.
The alpha's hand brushes down his cheek tenderly, encouraging, and lands on his shoulder, where his bonding gland is ready to explode, burning and pulsating in need.
Tony laughed when he realized Steve hadn't even taken anything from his bathroom when he moved out and there were still all of his cleaning products there, probably expired by now. He didn't have much though, emptying the bathroom didn't take long. The next step was his art studio in which Tony had spent a few weeks in when he stayed over at Steve's. That was the biggest task at hand so far. Steve had too much stuff lying around that he had never taken the time to sort out during all those years. He probably even had unopened boxes from when he first moved in seven years ago. The prospect already gave him a headache.
Tony put a strong hand on his shoulder, steadying him, and then he kissed him again. Softly, this time. Lovingly. Steve moaned again, hands frozen in the air, useless and confused.
Steve. Beautiful Steve. Brilliant Steve. Steve, the man of his life. His soulmate. Free and untamed Steve. Perfect Steve. The sunlight in a room. The oxygen in the air. The pure water springing out of a mountain, bringing life all around.
Tony chuckled. "Fucking politicians, indeed." He agreed. "We're gonna have to change the world ourselves, honey. I'd drink to that." Steve snorted, feeling grim. "At least he was generous tonight..." Tony muttered as a bitter conclusion.
Besides, there were some truths about it. He did kiss Bucky, after all. And he touched Clint's dick, although he clearly doubted anyone knew about that particular detail of their lives. The thing happened in the blink of an eye. Clint was very hot in his hand and collapsed on him when he was done. Steve wasn't sure what to think of it. If anything, he was even more curious about sex, and more wanting, but far from sated. He kept on exploring with other alphas, with other betas. He even went down on Natasha once. She liked it. He did too, in a way, but there was still something empty about it. Something empty
Tony moaned softly this time and the sound sent Steve to heaven, resonating in his entire body like an orchestra was playing in there. How could it be so good? Tony's scent spiked, the smell of him mingling with Steve's own, it was overwhelming. Steve let escape a moan and collapsed onto the seat, heart beating so fast it hurt. He spread his legs instinctively. He could feel himself starting to get wet and felt the urge to cry at the beauty of it. So hard in his dress pants he could have torn them. He started humping Tony who stared at him from above, hands on each side of him and eyes intent on him.
They were soft and gentle and intent on him, burning like fires, so hot Steve felt naked under the stare. A soft, encouraging smile curled his beautiful lips discreetly. Steve was mesmerized. He opened and closed his mouth like a fish. Not sure what he was trying to do. Did he want to answer Fury's question? Or Tony's smile? He did neither and remained perfectly silent, a goofy expression on his face. Eyes locked with Tony's, hypnotized.
Steve is ready to go, Tony should go as well. He has been ready for a while actually but stayed to spend some more time with his boyfriend. The latter is cleaning up his space, rather quickly, and walks over to him on his way out. He curls a hand around his neck, caressing his jaw with a thin thumb. Tony loves it. He always loved Steve's hands anyway. That might have been one of the first things he noticed about him actually. Steve smiles at him silently and gives him a languorous kiss that warms Tony's entire body before leaving for work.
"So," Sam whispered gently while Steve was lost in thought, staring pensively at the entrance building decorated with colored lights for the occasion, "ready?" Steve startled and jerked his head to him. Sam's smile was soft and encouraging. He nodded and started moving about before Sam interrupted his momentum. "Wait!"
"Your point sucks, guys! What are you trying to achieve anyway, bringing up all my exes? Apart from really pissing me off? Besides, you're kind of done now, with your petty list..."
Tony honestly didn't remember. He probably had more or less suffered from all of these symptoms anyway. He just shook his head silently, hoping she wouldn't push things further. "I'm fine." He finally said.
Steve's chest constricted in a tremor. He gasped out a shuddering breath. The lump in his throat made it difficult to even breathe. He wasn't able to repress his tears this time and he felt them flow down his cheeks. "Tony..." He managed to choke out, vision blurry, heart racing in his chest. "Are you breaking up with me?"
Nothing." He stared at him, expression forlorn and desperate. "I'm just exhausted." He chuckled again but it almost sounded like a sob. "Just go to bed, alright? Leave me the fuck alone."
"I'm not saying I've never done it..." Tony replies matter-of-factly. "But no, that's not really something I do."
"What about that Peter guy you dated a few years back? So into you..." Bucky then said, to change the subject.
Steve looked up at him, startled, and realized that maybe Tony's unusual excitement had died down for lack of reaction from his part. He smiled back and the colors came back on Tony's face as he gave Steve a soft smile.
Tony tilted his head on the side, smile teasing. "Ooh Steve..." He just said fondly, without going any further into the matter and Steve felt himself blush.  "And there's also that Loki guy..." He then added.
Tony had a very pleasurable way of cutting him short and then he sighed into Steve's mouth. "And yet, it feels so right," he muttered, eyes hazy but intense on him.
"But it's pouring outside." He explained and rushed to the window to glance outside. There was a dark silhouette in the rain. The boy lifted his head and their eyes met for a split second. "I'll be down in a second..." Steve muttered with a voice unexpectedly low and deep and commanding. He even surprised himself.
The nasty tattooed brunette was there, a glimpse of concern in her eyes and he hated her for that. She gave them drinks anyway. Tony wasn't sure who paid. He looked at her with regret. He should have been nicer to her. If he had maybe she wouldn't look at him the way she was looking at him right now. He should have really tried it on with her, be nice and honest, instead of going on the hunt for cocks. Maybe he could have spent the rest of the night with her. Maybe she would have been kind to him. Maybe he could have fucked her gently. Or maybe she really was a dyke but she would have taken him to his place anyway and they would have talked and cuddled. She would forgive him for calling her a dyke, would she?
Tony stopped talking, finally and now he was sitting across from Steve, a few feet away. His legs were loosely crossed at the ankles and his arms were wrapped around his knees, to get warmer or to hold them up, Steve wasn't sure. The smoke of his first cigarette of the day was dancing around him like a silk veil hiding the blissed glint in his eyes and the warm and gentle smile on his lips.
The kiss had been short though and now Tony looked at Steve with uncertainty in his eyes. "I'm sorry." He said, genuinely apologetic. "I should have asked you before doing something like that. I didn't know you wanted to keep it down-low for now."
he shouldn't burden Steve with his self-induced shit, but the thing was... Steve was the first person Tony wanted to be with when he was down. And he was down a lot lately... Besides, if he didn't call Steve, who would he call? Rhodey was in deployment. And Pepper had made it clear she didn't want to be involved, had explicitly said that she loved him but didn't give a fuck anymore. If Tony wanted to die in his own vomit, that was his choice, Tony was no longer her problem. He couldn't blame her...
His heart skipped a beat. He could feel his boyfriend's breath on his lips and swallowed as he felt a shudder of lust run through him. Now was definitely not the time to play games though. And Steve was starving. And... And Tony was so dangerously close and really,
Clint's blue eyes have an unusual glow in them. He smiles and puts a hand on Tony's mouth. "Okay, baby Stark..." He slurs with a raspy voice. "Stop looking at me like that." Has Tony been looking at him inappropriately? It wouldn't be the first time. People tend to get the wrong message. It's not his fault, or maybe it is and Tony is just a dirty, horny slut that can't help making passes at people. "Not that the prospect of making out with you right now sounds unpleasant, you're very pretty and you know it... but I don't think either of us actually
He was a fool to think he could have his cake and eat it. It was foolishness, to ever think he could have both of them and keep them both for himself. It could have never worked in the long term. It was meant to be.
Steve gave him a gentle smile. "What?" He asked tenderly, brushing his knuckles down his boyfriend's stunned face.
Tony pinches his lips and looks at himself again, heart wavering, as stable as a man standing on a board in the middle the raging sea. He feels himself fall. "I..." He hesitates. "I didn't think it would only be the two of us, didn't even think we would actually go out." He admits embarrassedly, pulling on his clothes again, as some kind of explanation for his poor appearance.
"Not to mention T'Challa, who was such a nice and decent guy and ready to grab the moon for you," Sam said casually, like a kick in Steve's balls. "whom you just dumped like a shit."
It was surprisingly true actually. Past his primary reluctance about everything that stank of money, Steve had realized he wanted to visit the Tower. He wanted to visit Tony's quarters. He was
In his hurried race toward his locker, he bumped into a muscular chest and lifted his eyes, and met a mischievous smile. Bucky was smirking to him, eyes playful and mocking. He was leaning on the locker next to Steve's, school bag tucked onto his shoulder and legs nonchalantly crossed. He tilted his head on the side, slightly provoking, when Steve look up at him.
Tony's smile faded embarrassingly. He bit his lips anxiously, running the tip of his tongue on his bottom lip. A glimpse of something dark flashed through his eyes.
Tony is good at conversations however and it's easy for him to make Thor speak. It's a nice distraction and people generally like talking about themselves so when you listen to them it's easier to get them to trust you. Thor is a relatively easy guy to handle, easier than Bucky anyway, and the upward side of it, Bucky soon gets bored of Thor's ups and downs and joins Steve and Loki's catching-up instead. Tony is a good listener and he makes mental notes to remember the details. You never know, it might come in handy in the future.
Steve flushed, surprised about how much he had just revealed to his friends, despite himself, and his heart clenched when he realized that moment was so early in their relationship. He was probably already in love by then, even if he couldn't say for sure. It broke his heart a little to think how much time it had taken them afterwards to finally find each other.
Tony Stark was by no means a brawler, nor was he famous to be a fighter. And he was definitely not buff. Yes he was tall—taller than Steve anyway, not that this was particularly unusual, everyone was—and yes, he was athletic but he was not the fighting type. He was actually famous for being good with his tongue and quick off the mark rather than good with his fists.
The voice was extremely warm and soft. It sounded like honey and smelled like wood fire and it felt so soft Steve immediately saw himself cuddled under his mum's plushy comforter with a hot chocolate and marshmallows in hand in front of his favorite TV show. God, he was such a baby it was pathetic.
"Bite me," he whispers softly on the alpha's mouth while the three of them are entangled together, recuperating. Tony's warm brown eyes flare up. He quirks his eyebrows skeptically. "Bite me," Steve repeats, tone urgent and slightly annoyed. "Bite me. Bond me. I want to be bonded. I want to be your mate, you and Bucky both. You're the only one that can tie the three of us together for eternity. Do it. Bond with me like I've been wanting to for years now."
Tony tries not to let his anguish show up because today Steve kept the morning greetings short. His eyes don't lift up from his tablet. He will pretend everything is fine and normal and that the simple gesture didn't just overwhelm him, like it does every morning.
They stared into each other's eyes quietly, neither of them moved an inch. Steve felt the distance unbearable and craved for his boyfriend's touch, even a slight brush,
His boyfriend went berserk. He shoved him, made him stumble a few step back and screamed at him. Tony laughed... because, really, he couldn't cry.
When he finally gathered up the courage to do so, he realized Steve had already called, three times. His heart made a leap. Steve had called after all... The surge of excitement was short-lived however. Besides, why hadn't Tony heard his phone?
Tony wavered on his feet, as if he was losing balance, and Steve held him firmly grounded, snuggling against him.
Was the number really relevant at this point? Apparently... Tony wondered if they were making statistics. How many guys did the average gay slut suck off on a Friday night...? Thursday night? Well... He internally laughed. "Yes." Tony wasn't sure though, but that was highly probable.
And then Stark Industry created a prototype of the Iron Man armor on the occasion of the release of the first Iron Man Series. One that could hover about one foot above the ground for at least thirty seconds.
When James comes back, three hours have passed. Three hours of happiness. Tony hasn't realized it but he had never been so relaxed since Steve had left. Steve's scent, the treacherous, had soothed him and eased him into a sense of well-being despite himself.
Steve stared at him warily and shook his head. "I really don't wanna dance, Tony. Please don't make me." He regretted instantly when he saw Tony's shocked expression, a mix of anger and outrage, as if Steve had accused him of harassment or something. Tony Stark must not be used to being rejected.
Steve barely had the time to understand what was happening that his boyfriend was already fiddling with his jeans. "Oh fu—shit!" Steve choked out in a long plaintive sigh. His cock was already jolting out of his underwear and his legs were shaking. He threw his hands back, grabbing the bookcases behind him in a desperate motion, trying to keep himself steady as his knees were faltering. Tony's breath was warm on his cock and Steve could hear him moan and salivate in anticipation. He pulled his jeans down with an urgency that felt dizzying. Steve was breathing hard, trying to stay focus but his mind was already wandering away to leave place to sheer desire. How had he thought he could ever say no to Tony? He just growled and whined with want.
The gesture surprised him, they usually went straight to work, but he guessed it was different this time. They were in his house, of course he was going to offer him a drink. Tony sat down in front of him, just like always, and wiggled on his chair, trying to find the best position. His smile was so warm and full of promises but indecipherable.
The thought resonated in his mind however and he suddenly remembered the limo parked outside the school when he came in this morning. No. Impossible. Not in that neighborhood. Not in that school. Still, the thought was dizzying, and not in a good way.
Tony shuddered. "I feel like shit." He rasped out in a strangled sob. His hold around Steve was strong however. Steve kissed him again and tangled his fingers in his hair, in soft caresses.
Tony nodded, gazing into space, avoiding the man's stare. The uneasiness he had felt all night long came back, settling in his heart, for good.
Steve's eyes flicker alive and he laughs, sound so gentle and beautiful. Bucky collapses and falls out of consciousness.
Steve stopped talking and the silence festered. Tony rested his chin on his knees, heart pounding so hard it was hurting his ribs. He wondered why he hadn't already left. Obviously Steve didn't want him here. He was just hoping, stupidly hoping, that just for tonight, just for the few remaining hours before day came, Steve would hold him one more time before giving up on him. Just for the sake of their history, just because right now he was feeling horrible for no reasons, or maybe a thousand ones, he wasn't sure. Just because the mere idea of being out there, alone, without Steve, and dealing with everything he was much too sober to deal with made him want to jump out of the window. His breathing hitched as anxiety and terror hit him again.
It was said in a way that eased the tension pervading in the room. Everyone laughed, encouraged by Tony's apparent nonchalance and good mood.
"I was just wondering..." Tony explains. "You know, if after four years you were still... If you didn't get bored or something... I mean, of each other."
He was out of it, too, when his boyfriend pinned him to the bed and when he straddled him. Was he gonna fuck him now? Tony wasn't even sure he would be able to stop him if he did... He would just take it, clench his jaw and close his heart and take it. He just wished Steve would stop crying when he did so.
Howard paused, solemnly, and skirted around Tony to face him. He grabbed his face in his two hands, the touch was meant to be gentle but Tony felt it burn like red-hot branding iron. His father looked up into his eyes and stared at him domineeringly. "That's what your grand father built for us son, and I've devoted my whole life to carry out his legacy. I've dedicated my time, my genius, everything I owned, to help protect our country and its values. This is
He rushed to his door and fumbled at the lock but finally opened it and slipped inside before Tony couch reach him. He slammed the door behind him and collapsed against it, sighing almost relievedly.
Steve sulked. "Not that much actually," he said in a shrug. "He's rather average in fact, on the big side of average but still smaller than you. You don't even remember that?"
He isn't sure why he hates Loki. Loki seems to be a pretty cool guy, there's no objective reason for Tony to hate him and yet, he makes his skin crawl.
Tony pouted, a glimpse of sympathy on his expression. Surely, no boy ever wished to be omega. Maybe Tony understood that, at least.
"Yeah, Tony, do tell!" Bucky topped, smile mischievous. "I think I've heard something about love at first sight... I wanna know everything about it! How did you guys meet? 'cause I don't think any of us know actually."
Bucky's fucked from both sides, his alpha's knot assaulting his throat, his omega's fist wrecking his insides. During the short moments of consciousness that hit him from time to time, he can only feel how amazing it feels until he's back to floating, mind flying to a land of pure bliss.
"You're gonna be exhibited at the MoMA." He finally said with so much pride in his voice, Steve felt a twinge in his heart. "This is amazing."
Tony was still smiling, expression gentle but determined. "Move in with me. Today." His tone was a little too assertive, a little too resolute. Steve's heart wavered. "Let's pack your bags now and move you into the penthouse."
Tony glances at him, showing a wide smile. He swallows another swig and closes his eyes to appreciate all the flavors. "Great." It is heavy-laden though.
Tony looked at him with gentle eyes and smiled at him. "Yeah." He answered. "A good night overall. Beyond our expectations by far."
It didn't feel real. None of it was. And yet, in a few weeks or so, in a few months. It was going to be real. Very real.
Steve went to take a shower, and Tony was blessed with peace once again. Finally, his mind started to drift towards unconsciousness, his limbs becoming pleasantly heavy…
Steve smiles unhappily, a little huff leaving him. He doesn’t know what to say. To Bucky, or to anyone else. This should be the happiest time of his life. He doesn’t know why it isn’t, why he feels like doing nothing but lying in bed for days, why he cries every night listening to Tony’s soft breathing and feeling alone. Why when his babies’ cries wake him up, he lies still and lets Tony tend to them.
”Okay. Why?” he asks, feigning indifference, but the air around his question is really anything but that. Steve always finds it hard to speak to Tony when he gets reserved like that.
So he talks, in a quiet voice and with his face hidden, but still. He talks about his insecurities, about the pangs of jealousy. Tony listens to all of it patiently, even though most of it is not news to him, his thumb rubbing Steve’s stiff shoulder.
It is. Steve’s heart beats erratically as he opens the message, but it ends up being quite underwhelming. It just says: “Sorry. Good night.”
Yet he had tried, he had tried to sense his baby through the bond, pulling his hair as if he could force it not to be true if he just tried hard enough. His child couldn’t be gone.
, Tony thought to himself, but didn’t bother to vocalize it. He turned his back to the door, hiding himself under the covers with a grunt. He listened as Steve stripped himself of his sweatpants and t-shirt – he’d been out for a run, because in Steve’s world that was what you did at 8:00 in the morning when everyone had been up drinking ‘til the small hours. Yesterday Tony had felt bad for Steve for his inability to get drunk, but now he envied him. As always.
The Audi finally stops at a remote, empty parking lot. You would expect one of them to comment the fact somehow, but neither of them does. They just sit there, the rain drumming the roof of the car. Despite everything, it’s a comfortable silence and it gently waits until they are ready.
The tip of Steve’s cock poked against Tony’s torso, and Steve jolted a little, needy for touch. Tony cupped his ass with both hands, massaging it in defined movements. As Steve was trying to recover from the way that made his body arch, Tony pulled him back down. Staring at Steve, he wet a finger in his mouth promisingly.
Then Tony begins to move, and since he’s tied, Steve can’t really do much besides trying to make his mouth the best place for a cock to slide into. Tony cups his jaw, going slow at first, his lips slightly parted as he watches his cock move in and out of Steve’s mouth. Then he catches Steve’s eyes and Steve’s heart skips a beat at how soft the expression on his face is. Steve would give anything to always have Tony look at him like that, and his own eyes light up in such obvious worship that Tony chuckles a little, almost like he’s embarrassed.
Tony keeps pouring himself drinks until he can see the bottom of his bottle when he tilts it. That’s when he gives up the glass and starts to drink straight out of the bottle.
The grief feels like a companion as it takes Steve into its stronghold once again. He tries to focus on the sounds on the TV until eventually drifting off to sleep.
”Twelve point five percent probability of having lost all of you”, he explains, and Steve moves closer, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. Tony must’ve been through hell, living so long in all that uncertainty.
Steve still has his shirt on, but Tony can’t spare any thought to that – Steve spreads his legs wide open and Tony doesn’t even hear the possessive sound that escapes him now.
Questions are racing through his head. Is there another? Was the ugly part of him right to be jealous of Barnes after all? Or is it just his own incompetence as an alpha? Is it a punishment?
”Go on”, Steve prompts huskily, and Tony quirks his brow, pouring some shampoo onto his palm. Steve closes his eyes as Tony begins to rub the liquid into his hair.
While it hurts, talking about Tony makes Steve feel closer to him. It’s like a soft blade being pushed through his chest.
Tony keeps to his word. He doesn’t touch him besides the wrists he’s holding, just waits silently. Steve is getting desperate. If he could just touch himself –
”FRIDAY, lock the master bedroom door, please”, he says then, getting up to his knees. He grabs Steve’s hips and pulls his ass up gently but firmly, Steve letting out a gasp against his pillow. His eyes are still closed, and Tony studies him as he rids himself quickly of his underwear.
He goes on for almost an hour, coming three or four times, but something feels off. He doesn’t feel as foggy as he usually gets, and the pain isn’t easing, it’s getting worse. It isn’t even centred in his lower body. It’s in his chest, and eventually it grows so disturbing that he stops, pulling the toy out with a whine.
The therapist shifts in her chair. Steve notices that something’s probably caught her attention, but he reminds himself that she’s only here to help.
Steve doesn’t answer for a long while. Tony’s fingers find their way into Steve’s hair, moving through the strands softly. He finds it hard to find words, too.
When he gets to his quarters, Steve sits on the bed with a sigh, raking his fingers through his hair.
He turns onto his stomach, burying his face into the pillows and lets the furious tears he’s been holding back finally spill.
”And I love you because you’re the most handsome man I’ve ever laid my eyes upon, and I love you for the subtle grey that has begun to show up in your beard, because it makes you look even more handsome if possible.” A kiss on the chin, where said beard prickled Steve’s lips.
Steve was obviously pleased to hear that, but a quick glance down confirmed to him that Tony still wasn’t really even hard. As he was beginning to doubt Tony’s statement, however, Tony’s noises began to rise in pitch, encouraging Steve to maintain his rhythm.
”It’s good to see you”, Pepper says after a moment of silence. Tony turns his eyes from the window to her.
”Yeah, eventually. Emmy was stubborn as always, of course”, Steve chats back, thankful for the mild conversation start. He leans his hip against Tony’s desk.
Although he’s already been pretty much there just taking it, resigning himself into not much else than a hole for Tony to fuck into, Steve still finds a drop of strength to let go of in his body as Tony grabs him by the waist and lowers both of their weights to the floor. Tony’s hips still twitch infrequently as he presses his forehead against Steve’s back, breathing raggedly.
”Okay”, Thor says, a hint of doubt in his voice, but still getting up from the bed. ”I’ll be nearby. Just call me if you need me. Your, uh, things are right here”, he adds, lifting the black box to the bed.
After they’d been left there by themselves, Steve had taken one of those moments one took when they had an enormous crush on someone but needed to ask themselves why exactly. Tony had effectively ruined the dinner that Saturday with his drunken input, but despite his annoyance, there had been butterflies in Steve’s stomach. Where and when had he decided to fall for Tony of all people?
He’s exhausted. The lightness of letting go of all of the weight he’s been carrying is making Tony’s eyelids heavy. He’s not young anymore, but he knows that right now his body would go another round as soon as the knot comes down. But emotionally he’s spent, drained dry. He just wants to fall asleep with his cock buried in the warmth of Steve, their arms around each other. Breathe Steve’s scent into his lungs until sleep takes over.
”Apparently they usually suppress these kind of heats, because they’re quite aggressive and some omegas have died of them –”
“I know”, Tony says. “We don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with. We don’t have to do anything at all. But I’m here if you want to”, he tells gently, trying to lighten the atmosphere a little by adding: “It’s sort of one of the things I exist for.”
After he leaves Tony shouting his name after him, Steve goes to bed and buries himself under the covers. He doesn’t cry, the only thing he feels being anger.
Steve slides to the floor with a grunt. He starts pumping himself again, but it’s no good. He feels so guilty, his mind going back to Kieran, to the ashes that were Bucky two seconds ago flying in the wind, to the phone call getting cut before Tony can finish his sentence.
Steve leaned closer to press a kiss onto Tony’s forehead. He’d expected more habitual protest from him, but he was glad that there wasn’t any.
When he pushed his digit in past the first knuckle, Tony hummed, and Steve hummed back soothingly, massaging Tony’s lower back with his free hand. He let Tony get accustomed to the feeling before he pushed his finger slightly further, feeling for the bump of Tony’s prostate.
Steve twitches, looking up from the fire his gaze has been lost into for minutes. It’s a beautiful night in Wakanda, and Bucky delights in the peace around them, the clear night sky that allows him to see all of the stars where they have been since him and Steve were children.
“You’re not old, you’re just hangover”, Steve answered softly, but after a few strokes through Tony’s hair he withdrew his hand. But it was enough for Tony to be reminded of how horny hangovers made him, and he reached blindly behind his back in order to catch Steve’s hand. He managed to find it and pulled the arm over himself.
”Fine”, Steve hears himself say. He’s almost proud; it’s probably the most sensible thing he’s said for weeks. Not very alluring, but he feels Tony’s hand land on his collarbones nevertheless.
”go without me”, Steve finishes, but the connection is already lost. He picks up Tony’s name immediately from the contacts again, tears prickling in his eyes.
”He had, but he sneaked in here this morning without telling us. Stole some weapons and left.  Apparently, he also visited the living quarters, because he sent Nat a message about you.”
”Easy”, Tony says breathlessly, stilling Steve by gripping his hair. ”You’re gonna make me come if you do that.”
At this, Steve can’t help his gaze from escaping onto Tony’s eyes, which stare readily back like they can see right through Steve. Something gets stuck into his throat and he can’t look away.
”I just don’t know what to do”, Steve says then, still on the verge of tears if his broken voice is any indication.
Friday comes, and everything seems to go well. They watch a movie, after which Steve is gifted probably the best orgasm of his life so far and then falls asleep breathing against Tony’s neck peacefully. He wakes up only once to Tony being up on his tablet following the stock, but he just wraps his arm around Tony’s waist and lets Tony stroking his hair lull him right back to sleep. The next time he drifts awake, Tony is pressed against him and sleeping soundly.
Of course Tony would say something like that, Steve thinks. But it doesn’t change the fact that Steve’s broken, ruined, damaged goods. He’s already always been a compromise as an omega, and now he’s hardly an omega at all anymore. Tony’ll stay with him out of responsibility and for Emmett, but it will never be the same. If Steve doesn’t recover, it would be better for Tony to leave him. Most likely, since Tony wouldn’t do it, Steve would have to leave Tony himself to give his alpha a chance for something normal, with someone whole.
”No. He’s given instructions to Bruce. Bruce has a medical degree amongst the other ones”, Nat explains.
Sick of his thoughts, Tony finally comes to a breaking point and gets up to pour himself a drink, but he stops with the bottle already in his hand. You can do better, he tells himself. You’re Iron Man, you’re an alpha, you’re a genius, and you can do better. He’ll have to do better, because clearly, he hasn’t been doing that with where he’s ended up.
His words charge Steve with anticipatory energy, and he complies eagerly; he’s been waiting for so long. Finally, Tony’s going to give him what he wants, to fill him –
”I have to talk to you about something”, he starts. His voice is grave but not too worrying, and Tony just gives him a distracted hum as a cue to go on.
He wants to touch Steve so bad that he can’t stop himself from at least giving in to burying his hand into his hair. He touches Steve’s face, and while he’d never minded the beard, the smooth skin feels pleasant against his fingertips. Steve kisses Tony’s hand, then starts coaxing his shirt up. Tony lifts his arms, letting Steve pull it off of him, feeling slightly self-conscious about his weight-loss. But Steve doesn’t stare, just starts planting kisses everywhere while his hand keeps pumping Tony’s now fully erect cock. Tony closes his eyes as Steve kisses his chest, his collarbones, his shoulders, his arm all the way down to his palm, which he pries open and kisses in the middle.
”I was waiting to hear from Thor tonight, but it doesn’t look like that’s happening”, Nat tells, a sad smile hovering on his lips. ”I wanted to check up on you before heading to bed. You didn’t show up for dinner.”
these are very common phrases obviously but I know nothing of this silly language so please correct me if I'm wrong
Steve relaxes his throat, and as Tony’s cock sinks deeper into his mouth, he closes his eyes, concentrates on breathing through his nose. Tony’s cock hits the back of his throat, again and again, and Steve can feel his eyes starting to water, his pulse rising, breathing becoming challenging. Before he can really start to feel much more than mild discomfort, though, Tony stops. He’s breathing hard, looking at Steve, quite obviously checking his state. Steve pulls a much-needed breath, but then closes his lips around Tony’s cock again, lifting his head to suck it deeper into his mouth again.
After a few more snaps of Steve’s hips Tony was coming, panting hard, his hips trembling against Steve’s weight.
When Tony picks him up from the therapy, Steve is silent. Tony asks him how it went, as he always does, and Steve answers ”okay”, as he always does.
The two of them settle on trying to give all of themselves to each other until the earliest birds are starting to chirp outside.
Tony hurries the kids out the door, going with them to carry their overnight bag to the car, and Steve migrates back to the kitchen to get himself some of the french toast. Tony soon rejoins him, coming and wrapping his arms around Steve from behind. He leans his chin onto Steve’s shoulder.
Tony hadn’t answered. He still can’t say what it was, but something had struck him in that moment. And whatever it was, it still hasn’t left him.
”Incoming”, Steve mutters against Tony’s lips, and soon Tony too can hear footsteps from the hallway. The absence of running tells of it most likely being Emmett, which the voice coming from behind the door soon confirms.
Steve pet Tony’s hair back. After nearly losing his life using the infinity stones to kill Thanos and his minions, the alpha had been in a coma for almost two weeks. Steve had gotten him back home from the hospital only a few days ago. Tony’s entire arm was still bandaged and the painkillers he had to take were strong enough to make him sleepy, like now.
”Quite so”, Tony agrees, leaning his forehead against Steve’s. Steve closes his eyes, and his hands roam up to touch Tony’s neck, then frame his face, his fingers ghosting the lines of his beard.
But he can feel Emmett. His child is feeling his fear, his pain. The threat, the final void staring straight at him. That gives Steve resolve.
”Yeah, but see, now you’ll have to come and try, otherwise this’ll haunt Steve for the rest of his life”, Tony fuels him. Steve shakes his head, a lopsided smile on his face.
”I want you to look at yourself while I do this”, Tony instructs. Steve had been ready to hear that, but it doesn’t make it any more comfortable to do it when the whip lands on his ass for the first time. But Steve keeps his eyes on himself, watches how his mouth opens into a quiet gasp, how his brows knit closer together.
Tony looks at him, his mouth hanging open as if he can’t believe that he’s alive and here. Both of them are at a loss for words, so for a moment they just cling to each other, trembling in each other’s arms. Steve can hardly breathe through his relieved tears as he kisses Tony’s temple.
Steve shakes his head slightly at Tony’s joke, securing it into his heart. They’ve been through a lot, but he wouldn’t give away a day. Well, expect for one, and that, they’re gonna take back and make right today.
There’s the click of a bottle being opened, and an excited sound already leaves Steve’s throat before he realizes that it’s not lube. It’s massage oil, he can smell it.
A little slowly, Steve did respond to the kiss, and Tony’s hips faltered as his tongue pressed against Steve’s, allowing him a pure contact with all of the little messages Steve’s body was sending to him with pheromones. Yours, they said, lighting up all of Tony’s nerves.
Tony grips his hair roughly and Steve lets out a noise before Tony’s tongue slips into his mouth, his finger rocking harder inside.
”Steve”, Tony mumbled suddenly between his moans. ”Baby – ah – I think you’re gonna – I think you’re gonna make me come.”
Exhaustedly and unwillingly, Steve obeys his body’s urges and tries to get up from the bed to go look for the toy he’d thrown. He almost gets to his feet before a horrific pain strikes him and makes him fall to the floor. Breathing raggedly, he tries to move forward on his knees, but the pain is so vivid that he can’t see from it. The world is spinning in his head.
He reaches to the nightstand, and Steve can’t say that he’s surprised to see a ball gag produced from the drawer.
Steve had suppressed a sigh, hoping that his brain would come up with an actual topic for them to talk about instead of listening to Tony’s nonsense.
Tony doesn’t answer. He gets up and walks to Steve’s side of the kitchen island. He lifts his hand up to push a wild strand from Steve’s forehead, then runs his fingers through his hair. Steve blinks at him, exhaling unevenly.
Without saying more, Steve got up from his lap, and took off his t-shirt. Tony pushed his chair back a little to see him better, rubbing his mouth, concentrated eyes traveling on Steve’s body as he continued to strip down slowly.
Steve moans, sucking Tony’s earlobe into his mouth. He starts riding him in long, slow, insanely satisfying motions. Tony’s hand stays on his ass, its pressure echoing Steve’s movements, and Steve swears there’s no better place for him to be than here in this car, rocking back and forth on Tony’s cock. For a while, he just enjoys himself in his own pace, concentrates on how sweetly Tony’s cock hits him every time it fills him.
They don’t get stuck. Instead, the two of them return to their own time completely unharmed, and for a few seconds it’s nothing but excitement on everyone’s face.
They stay there for quite a while, and although Bucky hadn’t initiated the hug for himself, he’s ready to admit that he’d definitely needed that when they finally pull apart.
The contract establishes pretty much what Steve has just said. That he consents to an alpha’s presence, but not sex or touching of any kind unless it becomes necessary for his safety. Steve reluctantly crosses the box saying that he allows the alpha to be present while he masturbates. There’s no point trying to insist on keeping that line since it’s pretty much impossible to do. The person would have to be running in and out of the room constantly. He considers for a long time before he also crosses the box saying that he consents to the alpha masturbating in his presence. It’s for his own sake, really. Whoever they manage to convince for the job will be paid, and Steve doesn’t care if they enjoy their time or not – actually he’d prefer that they won’t. But if the alpha is allowed to relieve themselves, it’s more likely that things won’t get out of hand. That’s just common sense.
”I’m so lucky”, he whispers, pressing a kiss onto Tony’s cheek before hiding his face into the dip of his neck.
Steve considers for a while, then gathers himself slowly onto his knees. He leans his back against Tony’s legs and Tony leans down to kiss his hair.
He doesn’t have too much experience of toys, but it’s hardly rocket science, and it doesn’t take long for him to find himself fucking the toy into his hole in abandon.
Steve happens to be watching outside, waiting for coffee to brew, when an orange circle spontaneously starts to form in the air on their back yard. It takes him approximately two seconds to gather Kieran and Emmett from the playpen to the safety of his arms.
Emmett starts crying. Steve goes to pick him up, beginning to hush him while Tony leans against the door, looking beaten.
”I know, I know”, Tony reassured, holding onto Steve as he determinedly finished his task of rolling the omega onto his back. ”There we go”, he continued his mumbling as he settled between Steve’s legs tightly, no room for his intentions to be left unclear, quite literally.
“Good”, he says matter-of-factly, clearly enjoying himself. But Steve knows that to Tony his own pleasure is always secondary, that what truly gets him off is the knowledge that he is making Steve feel good.
Steve moans, unable to look away from Tony whose eyes study him intensely, lips parted in wordless appreciation.
He stares at Tony, his face unreadable, until Tony becomes too ashamed to answer his gaze anymore and drops his eyes to his hands that have unconsciously started to rip the bottle’s etiquette.
Obediently, he added more lube before sliding two fingers back in. Tony sighed blissfully, his ass clenching a little around Steve’s fingers.
Perhaps God does exist, Tony thinks briefly as his hands admire Steve’s perfect, round ass. His entire cleft is shiny with slick, and Tony coats some of it around his own erection before pushing into Steve slowly. Steve whines like a puppy, his fingers sinking into his pillow as Tony’s cock becomes buried to the hilt.
”Uh… a week ago? A bit more?” she says, then continues as Tony stands to leave: ”Will you be okay, Tony?”
”No”, Steve says for some reason, feeling stupid as soon as the word leaves his lips. He has no idea how Tony knows, but he hadn’t wanted to go all of this through in the same breath. He guesses he’ll have to. ”Sort of.”
It doesn’t seem to matter much, though, because Steve’s eyes are desperate all the same, his breathing turning short just at the sensation of Tony’s warm and ready cock in his hand.
He has been so absorbed in his depression that he’s just been letting it grow like the piece of shit he already knows he is. His eyes fling open at the realisation and he jumps out of the bed, storming to the bathroom.
much.” Steve kissed his temple. ”And I love you for how determined you are. When you set your mind to something, you don’t give up until you get what you want.” He kissed Tony’s cheek, grinding his hips against him just inconspicuously enough.
Tony was here, in his arms, and it really didn’t matter who was fucking who. Steve’s insecurity with his body, Tony’s frustration with his recovery, even the fact that Steve didn’t know whether he’d ever be able to go into a heat or have children again because of his lingering condition, felt insignificant next to the fact that they were both still here, alive and if not completely well, at least well enough to be with each other and be a family.
Steve has put all of his bets into this thing with Tony, and he wants it all, with church bells and a home on the countryside, perhaps some kids running around. Or a home in the city and civil ceremony instead of church, he doesn’t have a clear vision in his mind but he wants Tony for life. It’s a little too early for them to start talking about these things and Steve knows it, but that is what he wants and deep inside he knows that it’s not going to change for him. He really needs to know if Tony’s on some different page entirely.
Tony’s face is a mix of emotions, but the main one Steve picks up is relief. His eyes shine, and Steve kisses him again, tender like his heart is bleeding.
The tongue was persistent and pressed against Tony’s neck now, slightly tickling him as he shifted under the 240 pounds of weight that was his omega clumsily trying to climb into his lap and left Tony’s lungs in a shortage of air.
”Good, you feel so good around daddy, baby”, Steve heard Tony’s voice, and his mind was ready to fly into subspace with that, but then a noise pulled him harshly back to reality.
Tony was grateful when Steve didn’t waste his time with over scaled carefulness anymore – seeing the pleasure on Tony’s face, he lifted himself up and begun a steady rhythm of thrusts, not too fast but fast enough for Tony to start feeling the build up from the continuous pressure on his prostate again. Before long Tony was making noise as continuously, pushing his ass lewdly backwards for Steve to be able to sink as deep into him as possible, just right. Steve dropped down to suck Tony’s earlobe into his mouth, then bit his neck, and Tony whined unashamedly, feeling his completion suddenly near. He moved to touch his cock, but Steve seized his hand, locking it against the mattress. He begun to pound into Tony mercilessly, and, fuck, Tony was coming anyway, his orgasm so powerful after all of the stimulation that his vision blacked out, and there was just the sound of his own screams in his ears as he clenched around Steve viciously, his cock releasing a load after load.
”Okay”, he sniffs, then lets out a little, bitter laugh at himself. Jesus, he should be helping Tony with the children, not acting like a child himself.
Steve has no idea how much time passes, but the next time he opens his eyes, there’s light. He blinks, wondering if it’s day already. There are silent noises, too. Talk.
It breaks Tony’s heart if he thinks about it too much, so he doesn’t. Instead, he wraps his hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him towards himself possessively. His tongue coaxes its way into Steve’s mouth, and that seems to free Steve from his mental cage. He opens his mouth pliantly, shivering against Tony and soon his tongue is pressing back with growing courage. Tony can’t help but give a little triumphant smile at this against Steve’s lips, and quickly the atmosphere is changing from tense to urgent.
”No”, Steve insisted, although it was exactly one of those hugs. He kissed Tony’s shoulder and squeezed him a little tighter for a while, then let go.
Further examination reveals that the curse has apparently all but destroyed his inner reproductive system completely. The doctor uses a charming description of ”an unprecedented mess” as he examines the scans, muttering under his breath. Steve’s probably not meant to hear it, but of course he does.
There was this sort of amused, sort of bothered noise that Steve let out. Tony could imagine Steve rolling his eyes behind his back, but he knew that secretly, Steve liked it when he said shit like that, he just would never admit it out loud. Except on the brink of an orgasm while Tony was nailing him to the mattress, of course, when he actually had. If Tony had been more on the mood to tease Steve, he might’ve brought it up, but the current state of affairs was that he just wanted some attention on his dick as soon as possible.
The alpha is sitting across from where Steve has sat down, focused on his tablet. His scarred fingers are curled lightly around his coffee mug that says ”Dear Dad, Thanks 4 putting up with a spoiled, ungrateful, messy, bratty child, like my sibling.”, which is as Emmett as a present can be.
The thought made him blush even more and he felt his cheeks heat with embarrassment. Tony's smile softened and something beautiful glimmered in his dark eyes.
Tony laughed again, throwing his head back sexily. "Laugh lines..." He corrected, looking back up at him. "And I love them, by the way."
After that, Tony led him a few floors lower, to the gym, the swimming pool, the pool room, the theatre, etc. And they took a walk around the huge terrace that overhung New York City. It had everything a terrace
Tony fondled Steve's hands and chuckled. "I don't know... I guess coming back here makes me feel nostalgic. And anxious."
"I know how you're feeling right now." Howard's sugary voice said. "I've been young too, you know. But let me tell you this, as father to son... what you deem absolutely essential right now, will seem completely insignificant in a few weeks... A few months, at most. By the time you reach my age, you'll have eaten so many asses you'll realize they all taste the same. We're
James is gorgeous and Tony really wishes he could fuck him the way he deserves to be fucked. But he can't. He wishes he could love him the way he deserved to be loved. And he can't.
Tony didn't say anything but he nodded slowly and planted a kiss on Steve's hand before he turned around and slumped on the mattress. "Steve?" He mumbled softly, head buried in the pillows. "Please, don't ever let me become my father."
What he hadn't anticipated though, was the reception it would have. The fan base was going crazy. The whole thing even made the seven o'clock news on three national channels and brought once again the couple to the spotlight.
But as Tony takes the shampoo bottle into his hand again, Steve moves away, scooting to the other side of the big tub.
He lets Tony touch him at nights, but even when Tony tries his everything, Steve isn’t able to enjoy it much. His body responds, but his mind is elsewhere, shut away from Tony and his attempts to show love. And then he doesn’t let Tony touch him anymore.
”Yes”, Steve tells him eagerly. He’ll say anything, do anything as long as Tony doesn’t stop. Besides, Tony deserves to hear it. ”Yes, sir.”
Dum-E was working on something for him, or at least trying its best to, in its usual clumsy manner. It reminded Steve of one time he’d brought coffee into the workshop and Dum-E had reached for Tony’s cup curiously.
Steve just hummed at him for an answer, quite fucking obviously pleased, and leaned down to lick the mess Tony had made.
Steve gathers himself rapidly, struggling to look like he’s not in the verge of a breakdown. ”Yeah, you too, Buck. Thanks for coming.”
He didn't have the time to voice it out however, because Bucky's head jerked toward him and he threw him a furious glare, before glaring at his husband and then back at him. "You did
English class was not the cradle of literature anymore. No studying happened. No learning happened. Not from Steve's perspective anyway. All that happened in English class was long, callused fingers playing energetically with pens or scribbling on paper, decorating sheets and sheets of paper with an irregular and dynamic handwriting at an almost inhumanly fast pace. Long and callused fingers scratching the delicate skin of a strong neck. Those fingers brushing softly the short hair at the back of a scruffy head.
Omegas are a miracle of life. Their soothing voices so enchanting and their lavish, comforting scents intoxicate and send you to heaven each time you get a whiff. His omegas are gorgeous. They are more. They are perfection. Each of them, in their own way. James's mysterious blue eyes charm him in dangerous ways. Steve's soft and protective ones ground him and open doors for him and pull down the sky and the entire galaxy, to offer it to him. Tony feels dizzy at the thought.
Tony swallowed the lump in his throat and ignored his trembling hands. "I understand." He finally croaked out, the words scorching him as he uttered them. The rejection hurt, even though Tony loathed that man with all his soul. That is, if he had any...
He took a last drag of his cigarette and climbed in. The door closed and he leant his head against it, not looking at his companion. "Are you gonna take me home?" He asked dully.
The next day she wakes up angry and later than usual. The scent is somehow still present. Everywhere. Unbearable.
He took a drag and looked at Steve again, hands back on the iron bar, as he puffed out the smoke in Steve's direction. "I don't know...
Tony chuckled, almost giggled, head thrown back, but his hands on Steve's arms were strong and his grip firm. He stared into his arms, seriously. "You wanna have sex?" He husked out, Iow and deep and almost sensual. Half a question, half a suggestion.
"I know you're still shaken from earlier. Let me take care of you. Come here," he said hoarsely, reaching a gentle hand to Tony's shoulder to bring him closer. "I've got something for you."
Steve touches his stomach instinctively, but when he realises what he’s doing, he pulls his hand away.
He glances down where he and Steve remain connected, then turns to look at Steve in helpless amusement.
”Can’t even remember what the fuck this was about”, he mutters, tossing the sketches he’s picked up back on the table.
As Tony’s mouth found Steve’s neck he could feel him shiver, and the way he exposed his neck pliantly was breathtaking. Breathtaking, and all for Tony. His cock was slipping in and out of Steve smoothly, Steve’s slick wetting his balls and even thighs as he kept fucking him sweetly, slow enough to relish it all.
Tony looks uncomfortable and Steve feels for him, but he just waits patiently until Tony finally musters up words.
It’s infuriating. Steve knows that Tony knows that if he’ll promise something here, he’ll do it afterwards. They keep their promises, even if none of this is very orthodox.
”Right. Okay.” Tony squeezes him tightly, nuzzling his face against Steve’s shoulder blade. ”I just want you to be okay.”
Steve reaches his jaw and Tony pulls his face backwards to kiss him hungrily, and Steve’s face is wet, and it should feel wrong but everything feels right, their touches following their memories of each other’s bodies.
Steve is whimpering, still chasing his own completion as Tony starts slowly coming down. He pushes himself up, taking in Tony’s wrecked look; he’s still out of breath, eyes half-lidded and damp around, the marks Steve’s left screaming with colour. Steve takes his own cock into hand, his heart filling with dark, lust-ridden satisfaction as he stares at Tony. Tony is his, it’s his marks all over him and it’s
Tony doesn’t answer. He’s not stupid enough to think for a second that it’s actually anger he feels towards Steve, but the worry is so intense it is hard to tell. He’s just spent weeks offering everything, including his own life, to all the higher powers he doesn’t believe in in his mind to just have Steve alive in exchange. Everything, anything, for Steve to live and for his children to live. For Steve not having to suffer the loss of either of them, for their children to have their oma. But he doesn’t get to decide, he never gets to decide, and Steve hadn’t listened to a thing he’d said when he’d tried to convince him that not everybody had to go.
"You look fine." Steve says. "I like you just the way you are." And it sounds so blunt and genuine it unsettles him.
Steve laughs softly. "It's the only place I've found in Brooklyn that offers a 1940s ambiance but maybe I'm still not that good with the internet."
Tony bent over and sniffed one. He felt his pupils flare open and his heartbeat accelerate. He knew he would soon feel euphoric and waited for it eagerly.
Seriously, are they glued to each other or what? And did Steve have to laugh so happily when they exchanged greetings? Oh and now he's patting him on his back, really...
The assembly cheered. Tony looked at them impishly and shrugged off a shiver. "I've always dreamt to say that."
He can't even see that they just want one fucking thing: be put on their knees and knotted. They both shake and start purring each time Tony crosses their path. And their horny, desperate honey-spiced scents spread around the tower, arousing, entrancing,
Steve startled at the unexpected compliment and felt a blush starting to creep on his face. He looked down sheepishly.
Tony gently lies him down on the mattress. Steve can't feel his tears but he sees them on his face, through Tony's eyes. And then Tony bites Bucky and when he sinks his teeth in the other omega's flesh Steve can feel every step of it, all the way. He can even taste the blood on his tongue.
Tony breathed in a couple of restorative breaths and smiled proudly. "Too bothersome. I made it alright, didn't I?"
Tony almost had tears in his eyes as he was saying this and Steve... Steve was biting his lips till he bled to repress his own. His own heart ready to explode.
even if he fucked around. His eyes met Clint's who gave him a gentle, knowing smile still. He admired Clint's ability to forgive and move on when he had a tendency to dwell on bad stuff forever.
Steve's heart broke a little at Tony's crestfallen face but he didn't get the time to acknowledge his feelings because Tony made an abrupt turn and slammed the door to his face, leaving Steve and his anxieties completely taken aback.
Tony's eyes opened and glimmered. He smiled, like someone up to no good. "I'm so happy to be here," he muttered softly, voice sounding a little too husky for Steve's own good, "finally..."
Tony continued however, ignoring Steve's previous remark. "That didn't mean I didn't have a hidden agenda and wouldn't use that opportunity to get into your pants." He confessed and concluded with a smug chuckle.
Clint chuckles mirthlessly. "Me too. I've always wanted kids. I was thinking four or five..." He laughs again, this time with some sort of melancholic amusement. "but I guess your dreams change as you grow up."
The man snorted again. "No need to be so formal, my boy. I've known you for a long time and I care about you a lot. You know that right?"
What did Steve want? Piss in his mouth too? Shove his limp dick down his bleeding throat? Hit him? Whatever it was, it didn't look like fun at all. Not that any of those things had ever really been fun to Tony but at least, he thought, it was fun for the other party.
Tony felt the bile coming up his throat at the reminder. He saw himself on that toilet bowl again, head in pushed down into it and Obie tearing his ass apart. He was strangely detached, as if he had been out of his own body then. The pain was real though, excruciating. It made him want to throw up, to scratch his skin off, to hurt his arms.
He pouted, although it really didn't matter anymore, and averted his eyes because the rejection had stung a little rather than out of frustration. Tony finally got up and headed for the bathroom. Steve had already given up on morning sex and set out to get ready for breakfast.
Tony leads him to the bathroom silently and once there he looks sternly at the omega who pouts uncomprehendingly. Tony remembers how lost he was when he first arrived in the Tower. He remembers how primal and instinctive his reactions were, how wary he was around him. James trusts him completely now. He doesn't resist him and has given himself to him entirely, like an omega should.
Clint shook his head. "Best hate sex of my entire life, babe. I still feel shivers when I think about how hard you pounded me against that stall."
"I've really spent," Tony went on with a tired voice, "six years of my life chasing after you, Steve." He looked at Steve again, eyes playful and expression amused. "I can't believe that you still don't see it after all this time. You're so blind." There wasn't any animosity in the tone of his voice however, despite what his words suggested. In fact, Tony looked at him with a fond and loving expression. Maybe that was one of those faults of his that Tony found cute. Or maybe he was just fucking with him, and with everyone else.
"I made coffee?" Steve attempted but only heard a hitch in Tony's breathing as a response. "Please Tony, let me explain, okay?"
He went down with the coffee, his sketch book and bunch of art supplies. He had some in Tony's workshop already, where he had, more or less, set up his own space, but he always feared to lack something so every time he went to Tony's workshop to draw, his stock of art supplies expanded. Not that Tony cared, Steve was never short of anything in Tower, which wasn't the case at home, he suspected JARVIS might have something to do with it. Tony had said something about it once or twice.
He looks at Steve again and wonders why James and Felicia still haven't come out. It is quite late anyway. Tony never thought they would be going out but looking at Steve he was obviously mistaken.
"Buck and I hated each other at first." Clint said, grin huge on his face. He looked so eager to look back on the beginning of his relationship with Bucky.
He could feel the blush going wide on his face. He looked down and up at Tony, who stood by him proudly, holding his hand and holding his friends's stares,
Past the annoyance at yet again an outward show of distrust from dear old dad, the last part of Howard's sentence finally came down to him. "What?" His heart dropped and started racing, in a moment of panic. "What do you mean we're
Maybe he parted his lips a little when a surge of lust flushed through him. Obviously Tony and him didn't have the same kind of sparring in mind, at the moment. Which didn't really matter either way because Steve had this thing to do first. His gaze lingered on the bulge anyway to finish its course down his boyfriend's sturdy thighs and his strong calves outlined by his red and gold boxing shoes.
with me. You can't reject everything I am and then ask me to spend hundreds of million bucks to clean up your mess. That's too easy, Steve. You're a
He got off the bed only to wipe off the remains of his own cum and jumped back into it while cuddling his boyfriend. They didn't sleep right away, they kissed and snuggled against each other and told each other how much they loved each other, hands never-endingly touching.
They all came in different fashion, the doodles. Once, it was put on his threshold, once slipped surreptitiously in his pocket, a few times it was brought on with his lunch tray. But
His fingers, so soft and gentle, brushed his cheek tenderly, leaving a burning trail on them. Steve froze, heart racing in his chest. He couldn't breathe anymore. The touch so electrifying. Steve had forgotten, in his little quest for sexual self-discovery, how much he ached for the alpha, like he had never before.
What is it that he needs to do, already? Right. Pups. Making pups, that's what he needs to do right now. An entire baseball team of pups. They should definitely start sooner rather than later, he's not getting any younger. At this rate, he's gonna have an attack in the year. Isn't He?
Tony did. He gasped and his knees buckled and his legs were shaking. He brought a soft gentle hand to his face, entangling his fingers into Steve's hair. Steve's body vibrated at the gentle gesture filled with amazed gratitude. He nodded softly, silently telling Tony that he could fuck into his throat if he wanted to, but it wasn't enough, Tony had lost the confidence. So he pulled away and with a raspy, broken voice he looked up at his boyfriend intently and whispered softly. "You can fuck my face if you want."
He tentatively tried to contact it, remembering that in the 5th Avenue mansion, you could just address it—
He thought he came back for another round of drinks, he wasn't sure though. But he took another dose at some point. Maybe two. His head was spinning too much. He stared beatifically at the ceilings and let the lights blind him for a moment. His time perception was kind of crooked. He could barely notice his surroundings anymore. Hands were touching him. He felt great, lightheaded, in bliss. He thought he did anyway. Maybe he was smiling, he wasn't sure. He couldn't feel his face anymore. He was pretty messed up by now, plastered and completely high. He was finally ready to go to the backrooms. He needed to go, because he suddenly felt his skin prickle, like something creepy and unpleasant was crawling underneath his skin. It sounded like he was dangerously sliding down the path to bad-tripping and really needed to do something about it. He needed to fuck the awkward feeling out of his system.
Once they arrived, they both quickly changed into more comfortable clothes. Steve had left a few in the huge closet dedicated to him in Tony's room and they did what they had to do in comfortable easiness around each other, settling into a routine that felt poignantly natural, both of them conscious of the nonverbal communication happening between them. Then Tony went down to his workshop without a word. He just brushed his fingers on Steve's cheek as he passed him when he left the bedroom. A natural and very domestic gesture that still gave Steve warm and fuzzy feelings. Steve went to the kitchen first, to make coffee, even though there was a coffee machine downstairs because the coffee from the kitchen machine tasted better and because ehe knew his boyfriend loved when Steve made his coffee.
Tony was still jeering and chuckled mockingly. "I've been asking myself that same question for years, darling."
Steve nodded. He did remember. He had no idea they were a thing then and all he had felt toward Clint was misplaced jealousy and hostility. And he might have been zealously protective too.
He wanted to say he was sorry but he didn't. He just settled for a hug and wrapped his arm around the Omega's shoulder silently.
"Yes, sir." The disembodied voice answered. "I'm at your service. Especially when Mr Stark's health is in jeopardy."
Steve might have a point after all... Tony's head was spinning again. He felt nauseous. His throat hurt. He slowed down his pace not to bother him but his heart was racing, his anxiety was creeping up his chest until it all became overwhelming. He felt like crying and really wished he could. Crying would be so relieving. His entire body felt wrong. He needed to get out of it. He needed
—but since they were dating, their dates had been rather modest and discreet. Nothing official. Nothing...like
Steve wished he could have taken the time to make it feel good, to make it last, but he was so fucking turned on right now he barely could think and he didn't even take the time to properly take his clothes off. He aligned himself between Tony's legs and grabbed his naked hips. Tony was rock hard and the head of his cock jolted up, already leaking at the top.
A bunch of lilies and spider lilies beautifully arranged in a rainbow of whites and pinks and reds. Tony had chosen.
Right now, standing in the entrance of his Penthouse, only wearing his underwear. His omega is submitting to him, so beautifully he wants to cry. He can smell his slick and he's so hard he'd fuck into anything if he gave in to his clamant, indomitable urges.
His bonding gland still pulsated, more intensely than ever. Whoever thought it would fade was a fool, or a fucking asshole... The need to be with him had never been so strong.
He stood up and stared back into Howard's eyes. He was terrified though. Tony might be taller than Howard now, he might box like a pro and know self-defense like anyone else in this tower, deep inside he was shaking like a leaf. He could still feel the mark of his father's fingers on his cheek, the heat after a blow. He still flinched in anticipation. "No." He muttered through his teeth. "I'm not going." He held his stare and maybe Howard was unsettled, for a quarter of a second. He frowned at him and crossed his arms. Tony shivered, he was waiting for it. It would hurt but he was used to pain.
"Come on, let's go to my place." The man said while wrapping a steadying arm around Tony to help him walk straight.
Tony stops, hand hanging in the air, and stares at him, wondering how serious he is. Pretty serious by the looks of it. His face is determined and expectant. "I'm not sure I can." Tony finally says softly. "And frankly I'm not sure that's fair on Bucky. I don't think that's what he really wants."
His unsure steps lead him to sit next to Thor who is already chatting with Bucky. One of them he keeps having dirty thoughts about and the other being  quite distant, as usual. Bucky has always been keeping his distance. Not outwardly, he doesn't think Steve ever noticed, but Tony does notice that kind of things. He has always been good at reading people, at seeing their faults even the ones that are well hidden. He thinks it might be a self-protecting skill of some sort... and Bucky has always been kind of hostile. Not the same way Sam is, Sam is just being a protective friend. It's more insidious. Bucky sees him like a competition, like the guy who stole his best friend—slash—sex buddy—slash—lover away from him. Although, it might also have something to do with Steve's first birthday. Tony isn't sure but he can tell that Bucky has been wary of him from day one and is still suspicious, sometimes ostensibly antipathetic. Steve is really the only one here who's so naive as to think Tony gets along well with all of his friends.
"Break us up?" Steve specified. "You never tried anything funny. You were weirdly distant, in fact. Although you wouldn't have had to work hard for it, you know... "
"Liked that, kid?" He heard someone say, probably dark-haired guy, from the tone. Tony answered with a blissed and unfocused smile, unable to control himself. So they repeated it, either by choking him with a hand on his neck, or by shoving their dicks deep down his throat while blocking his airways. Tony passed out again. And again. At some point he threw up. Maybe once, maybe twice, he wasn't sure anymore. Things were blurry. They held his head when he did. And when he was done, exhausted and unable to move anymore, they leant him against the wall and opened his mouth. One last slap to startle him awake and one of them cleaned him with a golden shower. Tony opened wider, instinctively, and swallowed everything when the man shoved his cock into his mouth, didn't even need to be asked. It hardened and poked at the back of his throat. Tony's mind drifted away again. Far far away...
For a moment he manages to forget about Steve's overwhelming presence in the room, until he hears another voice. Less deep, less grounding. More mischievous, burning like a sweet fire. His chuckle just as biting. It is not any less enslaving.
Tony had never asked himself. Obie had made him take the preventive treatment. Almost as soon as it was available. He was the one who insisted he got tested regularly and kept tabs on him but Tony had no idea about the man's actual status. They had never worn protection. Thinking of Obie made him feel queasy, it roiled inside and rose up to his throat, burning, dizzying. He felt suddenly dirty, it tingled and scratched and crawled under his skin.
Then he steps back and looks up into his eyes. He brings a warm and soothing hand to Tony's cheek. "Tony, I never told you but... " His expression is worryingly serious and Tony's heart skips a beat. "I'm so proud of you."
Obie's resolute hand pushed on his back to bend him over. Tony caught himself on the wall before falling over the toilet bowl and splayed his two hands against the tiles. He was tall enough to stand on his feet now, even if he had to tiptoe. His legs were shaking and Tony shuddered when the man tugged his pants down and grabbed his hips possessively.
After a moment, Tony’s moans broke their kiss. There was still a tight feeling in Steve’s chest and he pressed his face to the dip of Tony’s neck with a greedy inhale.
Well, his permission wasn’t really asked for. Steve never does. But if the all-mighty Captain-lady and Thor hadn’t left too, Tony would have been on that ship to go with Steve or died trying.
”When I was delirious, for a while I thought you’d abandoned me and I was angry at you”, he continues, bitterness hovering over his smile. ”That was better than when I remembered the real reason you weren’t there. I… I know you don’t believe in God, but I begged Him out loud to give you back to me.”
”It’s okay, we’re okay, we’re here now”, Tony tries, but he’s weak from emotion and his throat feels tight.
”I know”, Tony sighed, not bothering to hide his disappointment. ”So, besides being a cripple I’m an impotent now.”
That’s not bad, as punishments go.  The one with a small dildo on it could grow uncomfortable pretty quickly, but this wasn’t even that one, just a normal ball gag. In Steve’s opinion, he would’ve deserved the one with the dildo, that would’ve been fair. Tony’s practically being a saint.
It went on for a while, until Tony finally pulled his finger out. Steve expected to be filled again with more, but Tony rolled the chair right to the desk and pushed Steve on top of it swiftly. Steve let out a surprised sound, falling onto his back, his eyes drinking in the sight of Tony standing in front of him, still fully clothed and in charge.
Steve’s heart fluttered at the softness in Tony’s voice. Years, and he was still so helplessly in love.
Oh. Tony has no recollection of that. Then again, when he gets up, hits his foot into an empty bottle and turns to look, cursing under his breath, there
It didn’t really matter that he was smaller than Steve, Tony thought idly as he laid his head back down on Steve’s broad shoulder. They had fit perfectly just like this for over ten years, and they still did.
Tony realises how much he’s trembling when Steve starts kissing his way down his stomach, making his breath catch a little. He tries to steady himself, but he feels so much and he’s not good with that, never has been.
”Look”, Tony said after taking a steadying breath, reaching to frame Steve’s face with his hand. ”I’m here. We’re here.”
Steve knows what destroying the mind stone means for Vision, but it’s not his first concern right now. The connection crackles.
”Thor’ll stay with you”, Nat tells him, but Steve doesn’t even look at her. He stares at Thor, who just shrugs and gives him a nonchalant thumbs up.
”But aren’t you… since when has Asgardian biology been like ours?” Thor certainly smells like an alpha, heavily so. But Steve has always thought Asgardians weren’t like them.
Tony understands well. Everything they feel is haunted by guilt and grief, be it good or bad, and there hasn’t been a lot of the former lately. Allowing themselves something good feels wrong, even if Tony recognises that it isn’t so. Remembering how they’d fought in this very bathroom in the spring, Tony’s just happy if Steve is able to show him how he feels. He wishes he were better at it himself.
He lies on his back with no air in his lungs and tries to reach Tony through the bond, but there’s just static. Tony’s alive, though. So are Kieran and Emmett, and Steve refuses to give up. Even though his whole body is in indescribable pain, every piece of him aching, he slowly forces himself back to his feet, beginning to limp towards Thanos again.
Tony sighs in wanton frustration, trying to fuck his cock into Steve’s hand but Steve doesn’t give him any friction. He wets a finger in his mouth and rubs it over Tony’s nipple, pinching it softly as he tempts Tony with his ass again. Tony whimpers and Steve can feel his cock weeping as the tip pokes his lower back.
But Thor insists that he shouldn’t have done it. He can’t really say aloud that he should’ve gone the other way, because it
”I can bring you breakfast here if you’re not up for coming downstairs”, he tells Steve as he gets up and starts looking for clothes, noticing how his omega snuggles under the covers to keep warm without him.
”Bucky and Sam insisted on getting Kit and Emmy costumes”, Steve tells Tony with an amused huff, rubbing his cheek against Tony’s hand. ”Emmy was a lion and Kit.. a dinosaur, I think? You should’ve seen Emmy. He was so pissed at first, but then Sam went all ’Simbaa’ with him. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Emmy laugh that much. Bucky hadn’t seen the movie and he was staring at Sam like he was a madman.”
Tony sets a slow pace of thrusts and Steve’s body moves like on its own, catching onto it quickly and beginning to move along seamlessly.
”You know what I’m going to say.” They’d talked about this before and Steve had already reminded Tony how well he was recovering multiple times.
It had been a couple of years since they’d last done it this way, and Steve knew that he’d have to take his time. He was more than ready to do that.
