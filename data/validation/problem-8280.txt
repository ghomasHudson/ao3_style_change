If Steve never wants to look at him again, he won’t blame him.
It’s only after the hands close around his arms that he realises how fucking
Steve rolls his eyes, letting the blaring music sweep over him.
“I know, I just-” he hesitates, but then pushes on because does he really have anything to lose? “Your designs, what you build, the way your brain works. I love it.”
He has such a goddamn honest smile.
Tony’s expression doesn’t change in the slightest, his lid on everything so, so tight, and Steve feels a flicker of pride.
Tony turns to look at him, and there’s so much sadness in Steve's eyes, such an endless, echoing grief. It’s the guilt that takes his breath away. He wonders if it’ll ever leave. Because Tony may have forgiven Steve, forgiven him a long time ago, but he doesn’t know if Steve will ever be able to forgive himself.
He tries to slow his breathing as he turns around to face the guy behind him. He can only really see half his face, but there’s a smile there.
“You okay there?” Steve says, and his voice is filled with quiet amusement.
He wants to stay awake, he knows that he needs to, he just-
“No.”
“I have to go,” Rhodey says, and he sounds sad. His fault. It’s Tony’s fault that he sounds sad. “Call me if you need anything, promise?”
Tony, still trembling, doesn’t move. Steve can feel his fingers curled around his shirt, and he doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know how to deal with this, doesn’t know how to
Steve flinches as if he’s been slapped, and Tony seems to realise he’s gone too far and draws back, but his expression doesn't change. The warmth in his chest has vanished as Steve stares at him with wide eyes.
There’s a hand on his arm, guiding him out of the room and down the hall. The grip is too tight. There's a sound of another door opening and closing. Silence. It’s finally quiet. He doesn’t feel anything, and his
That’s anger, well concealed but
“Hi Obie. Traffic?”
Tony grabs his hand, unable to resist the smile on his face. So much for the ice.
“This is my lunch break.” He says with a frown. “They can’t have burnt down the campus in twenty minutes.”
He laughs a little, and then immediately regrets it as his whole body aches.
“Nothing,” Tony says quickly. Too quickly. “It was nothing.”
the only one that’s nearby is goddamn closed.
“Just hurry the hell up.”
means nothing is broken, but he can’t be sure.
come over here?”
He holds her gaze for a long time, and she holds it right back, unflinchingly. Seconds pass, and then Tony shakes his head, breaking eye contact and glancing away. “Fine, whatever. I’m not having this conversation with you in the middle of an alleyway. I’m guessing you’re not offering me a ride back to SHIELD?”
“So?” Tony says calmly, gaze steady on his own.
His eyes snap open.
Tony nods slowly.
“It won’t take long.” Rhodey says, voice flat. Only Tony catches the way his hands tremble slightly with anger as he slides them into his pockets.
They try. They’re trying. Tony gradually, slowly, opens up his life for Steve again. He puts him in his old room in the tower, avoids him as much as he can.
Tony has never wanted something this much, ever. Steve’s hands are steady, and his voice is steady, and so soothing, so
“Tony.” Is the only thing he manages to get out, and a wave of pain shoots through him. “Tony-"
so fucking much, and yet the grip he has right on it all now is terrifyingly strong. Steve wonders again what the breaking point is, if there is one.
It’s fine.
“He… he also said something else.”
trying not to smile now.
They walk away a second later without a backwards glance.
“No. You’ll be booked into a hotel for the weekend.”
he doesn’t want to fuck this up, he doesn’t want to make Steve lose any of that innocent joy.
“Fine my ass. You’re not going back to class right now Steve, Jesus Christ.”
Tony doesn’t know what to say, isn’t sure how to deal with Rhodey defending him like this. He forces himself to look at Steve, and there’s nothing but devastation on his beautiful face.
She breaks off mid sentence, eyes widening slightly, and Steve turns around as Tony pushes open the door.
He tilts his head to one side, looking almost amused.
So of course Steve has to be sitting right next to him. Steve, the barista he had asked out. Steve, the barista who had definitely
"Io sono mezzo italiano,” Tony glances at Steve, and smiles again. He never wants to stop seeing Tony smile. “But my friend isn’t, so maybe we can stick to English.”
he’s going to go insane. The memories of the endlessness of space coupled with the memories of his mother’s eyes makes him want to break things. Or have a drink. Or do something reckless and stupid like call Ty Stone.
“Apologies.” Tony casts a glance at Steve, a once over that he knows will leave him feeling like nothing but dust on the bottom of a shoe, like a mild inconvenience at best. He’s always been good at giving that particular look; his father had taken care of it. “The staff here don’t seem to know the meaning of speed.”
If Rhodey hadn’t been with him, Tony is pretty sure he would have lost his mind three hours ago.
“Please, please. Shit, Steve
It’s over in less than three minutes.
He can’t move, can’t breathe. His ribs hurt, his face hurts. He doesn’t know if he’s bleeding, doesn’t know if something is broken, doesn’t know-
all because of the
“Tony, listen.” Steve says, and Tony really does look now, because there’s something in his voice that gives him pause. “We can go as slow as you want, with literally everything. Any time it gets too much? You tell me, and I’ll back off.”
“You know I am darling, so don’t even try to deny it. You nearly back?”
quick note: the italics that are ALSO bracketed are quotes/lyrics/lines of poetry/things that i wrote. they're not thoughts, and are more like a commentary on the scene/whats going on. Think of it as a sort of anonymous narration if that makes sense lmao. Normal bracketed things are just the character's thoughts! Hope you enjoy xx
with amusement.
His chest hurts, he hasn’t been in the suit since he came back.
“What the hell do you mean?”
, just to hear Tony laugh like that again.
He watched as Steve takes a step back, hurt flickering over his face, and part of Tony wants to just run, and get as far away from the entire situation as possible.
He has another drink, smirks at a couple of girls, avoids his father.
He often wonders how much she knows.
He blinks again, shaking his head. “Yeah. Sorry. I’m with you.”
When he gets up to his office, (top floor, he wanted the bigger windows) Obadiah Stane is sitting at his desk.
Tony backs away, slamming into the wall, still shaking his head. He looks frantic, panicking,
Steve leans down, kissing Tony gently, and the world erupts around them.
Steve processes that information, making the next coffee without any sort of interaction, body working on autopilot as he tries to order his thoughts.
“I’m not-“ Steve takes a deep breath, flattening his hands on the counter. “I don’t think you’re a slut.”
They all spin around as someone Steve guesses walks through the door. He recognises the voice from that phone call. James Rhodes. Rhodey.
“Nothing broken, just a lot of bruises, and a few stitches.” Tony says quietly, as if he can read Steve’s mind. Tony has always been able to do that, always been able to read him like an open book.
Steve breathes out slowly, closing his eyes for a second. “Okay. Do you… is it okay now? You don’t feel funny?”
“It won’t.”
Tony considers the last twenty-four hours, and a slight embarrassment flashes through him, along with a fair amount of guilt. It certainly puts a damper on his mood a little. He had… he had shouted a lot, too much. Given away far too much. But he doesn’t think he regrets it, because Steve hasn’t run, he’s still here. Even though he had said awful, horrible things, told Steve the worst parts about himself. He’s still here.
Then Ty’s voice reaches his ears again.
“Yes to the question you just asked you idiot. Yes I want to move in with you, yes I want to live with you. Yes.”
Steve looks at him for a long, long second.
“I’ve got us a place, just don’t let go, okay?”
TW for non consensual drug use and attempted rape, it's not graphic but i'm putting the warning in anyway.  Be careful xxx
his brain supplies.
Steve takes a step towards him, and Tony turns those dark eyes on him.
“Steve.” Tony whispers against his skin, and it’s the first time he’s called him anything other than cap or captain or Rogers, and it makes his heart skip a beat in his chest.
“Read me the date.”
“Maybe.”
Tony wonders if Peter is actually smarter than him. Probably. The thought of that makes Tony smile. The kid is a genius, he just doesn’t know it yet.
“I’m afraid I can’t allow it at the moment. They’re still running tests on him, and so far it’s nothing to be too worried about. I can tell you there’s nothing life threatening. But I can’t let you see him yet, I’m sorry.”
Tony closes his eyes, hands gripping Steve’s arms. “You’re evil.”
Steve laughs, but it fades in a second, and he shakes his head. “Fair.” Steve swallows. “Tony, listen I’m-”
fear that he hasn’t felt in a long time.
He isn’t breathing, forces himself to start again. He doesn't know how Steve figured it out so fast, but maybe he's not as good at hiding as he had originally thought. In, out. In, out. His mother- she doesn’t know, and she never will because he’s just trying to
He can’t. He can’t see him like this, can’t explain what and who and
Rhodey’s voice is heartbreakingly gentle, and if anyone other than his friend had ever spoken to him like that, he would have shut them down in half a second with a cutting remark that went right for the throat.
A second later, Tony realises he’s stopped in front of the Ancient Greek section. It’s one of the newer exhibitions, he remembers reading something about it in the random leaflet they’d given them in class. There’s a nagging in his brain now, pushing at him to go back to class. They’ll notice if he’s gone for too long. and yet-
Tony shoves open the door of his lab an hour later, sending it slamming into the wall. Sitting at one of the work benches, head bent over a project, sixteen year old Peter Parker nearly jumps out of his skin. There’s a loud crash as his chair tips, and then a torrent of language that makes Tony proud.
He waits as Tony makes the coffee and then he comes over to hand Steve a mug, retaking his seat on the sofa with a smile.
Tony nods slowly. “I want a copy of that file too.”
If he calls him, he’ll come.
Tony’s stomach sinks. However friendly his teacher can occasionally be, he knows Fury has a zero bullshit policy about sneaking away from class. And no matter how many times Tony pretends not to care…
“I’ve just been emailed your schedule for next week.” It’s Pepper, and he loves her for calling this phone, for keeping it professional, because he doesn’t think he would be able to keep it together if she hadn’t. “Your parents-”
Steve is perfect, in every way possible, and they laugh and kiss their way through it.
Steve goes with him as his knees give out and he drops. He remembers something a nurse said to him once after Clint had gotten alcohol poisoning and Steve had to take him to hospital at three in the morning.
For the first time in a while, the next breath isn’t a struggle.
He just goes.
[1] Are you okay?
will find out.
Okay so hi, this one was a little more exciting! Sorry for the wait, unfortunately my updates aren't going to get much better, especially once I start school again in september. I'll try and keep you all updated, and will probably do so either through my instagram or tumblr (both are linked below, and my username on both is @/wordsxstars)
There’s something that flashes in Obadiah's eyes at that, but for the life of him Tony can’t work out what. He counts four seconds of silence in the pounding of his heart and then-
It’s too bright, and now Steve has spent enough time around Tony to have a pretty good idea of when he’s bullshitting him. He still can’t tell his smiles apart sometimes, but then again, it’s something he suspects Tony’s been perfecting for half his life.
And yet…
Steve rolls his eyes, waving as he closes the door gently behind him, Tony's laugh still ringing in his ears.
nervous-
“I-” The feeling of safety has vanished in seconds. Howard is here alone, god knows why, but also, Tony has a pretty good idea. “What are you doing here?”
Tony flashes a smile, and Steve gets the urge to laugh, because Obadiah Stane has no damn
“You- you’re what?”
There's a beat of silence, and Steve just lets himself stare for a second, before Tony breaks him out of his thoughts.
Tony just shrugs, pulling the police warrant from Rhodey out of his pocket and throwing it onto the desk. Obadiah pales slightly, and Steve bites back a grin, fighting to keep his expression neutral.
Tony laughs. “I’m pretty sure she agreed just to shut me up.”
His friend must see something in his gaze, must hear it in his voice, because he nods, giving in.
Steve shrugs, feeling slightly uncomfortable.
“No.” But despite the glare she shoots him, Steve knows there’s no malice behind it. “No free coffee.”
He likes making things in a lab, it’s the only work he
He blinks. “What?”
He shifts slightly, reaching out and brushing some of the hair out of Tony’s face. Tony huffs, and Steve feels his grip tighten, hands curling around his shirt as Tony burrows deeper into his chest.
“I love you too.” Tony leans forwards, resting his head against his shoulder for a second. “Just be careful.”
Steve shakes his head. “You’re not. This isn’t- this isn’t
“Let’s go.” She says quietly, steering him towards the door with a final, brilliant smile directed to Obadiah. Tony doesn’t look back as she half pulls him out of the restaurant, dragging him down the street until they reach a side alley. Then he pulls out of her grip fast. She doesn't comment on the speed of the movement, and he's grateful for that at least.
because I couldn’t just-
about the rest of the world right now.
Steve shrugs, ignoring the blush he can feel rising on his face and not bothering to deny it.
“Tony.” He says gently. “Yes.”
He doesn’t care.
When Tony smiles, Steve’s heart breaks a little, because he hasn't seen a smile that sad in a while.
“They don’t care.” His tone is bitter, resigned. “I’ll be one second.”
“Oh.”
warm, and Tony wants nothing more than to stay here, learning more about how Steve feels, how he kisses.
“You think that’s why I want to be with you? Because I want to be able to say I’ve fucked a celebrity?”
“I have to go.”
“Now. The options have been presented to you I believe?”
Tony smiles, and it’s less practiced, more genuine. “Yeah. New York traffic is a bitch.”
Even so, he’s struggling slightly.
“Tony-”
“You actually want to live with me.”
“Fury pushed you too much on that.”
But then he thinks of Obie’s smile, the blackmail, the manipulation. Threatening Rhodey. Threatening Steve.
“They’re serving you?”
The robot beeps at him again, sounding almost concerned, and he blinks hard, dragging a hand across his eyes. He won’t cry, he
“ Bucky, I am not sure how many of you are gonna to give me some gangbangs? ” Steve seriously questioned.
Clint was trying to shoved his hand inside the box before Rhodey shook him with a jump scare which flinched him and released his hand out while tip toes his running foots with a frightening face.
“ Come on, Scott. This is getting so fun.” Erik shoved his giant cock into Scott and slowly opened its hole to enter in. His legs wrapped around his shoulder, pulling him closer to his opening and played with his own nipples.
“ Maybe, Thor. The God of Thunder will do anything to test his worthy.” Carol poked at Thor’s shoulder. He released ahem from his voice before he stood behind the box. Simon and Rodney were eagerly agreed that the God of Thunder was alway worth the wait to join the game.
“ Oh wow, I never though you will stop playing it.” Clint answered.
“ Oh well, tell me if I can put my hand inside ?” Simon felt amused.
“ I am glad T’ Challa isn’t with us. He will be mad why we will drink some alcohol as a beverage.” Tony’s drunk voice came out from his mouth.
“ Hang on, is that crab I am touching it ? ” Tony curious questioned.
“ Well, is this challenge is only for men ?” Tony asked which remaining Avengers had yet to play the game.
“You aren’t done yet, Steve,” Clint while trusting slowly on Iron Man.
They were having some times off even when Steve and Tony have a lot of communication including some conflicts or issues. They were always got each other back. Bucky was impressed when Steve had a strong heart to show its compassion and purpose to bring hope for the Avenger. Many peoples and front liners were amazed about his leadership during back to the World War time.
“ Wrong, Captain. Try another guess.” Clint shouted objected. Tony also sounded so wrong.
“ It is moving ? ” He asked. “ Yeah, it is, my friend.” Thor amusing answered. “ Oh no, I am freaking out, man.” Simon grew anxiety in his head and run to the side.
“ Okay, here come the never ending ride.” Steve threw himself on a big couch where the other guys could make some room.
He took another deep breath to touch the stuff once again and eventually got an answer.
“ Hey not so fast, how about another round.” Bucky started to fill the glasses once again. Eventually, they repeat the cycle and now they're five shots in as the booze was starting to take affect. Two liquor bottles had finished emptily out and the men had never felt so high in the sky before. Everyone was feeling more relaxed and slowly embrace this whole idea.
Scott just started Hank down face straight. “ I think you could have some spaces with us. ” He was handling Erik with hands grabbing on the hips. He never thought if he could cut in with them.
“ My friends , All I am want to say is you all give me some opportunity to learn some of your human activity .” Thor grinned at his team.
A huge smile spread across Thor's face as his head filled with memories. “ We find pleasure in our shield-brothers’ bodies to soothe the blood lust of an unsatisfying battle. I propose we should invited all the best gentlemen for a bar party for our celebrate mission in stopping Loki’s invasion and yet you are the best leadership in handling the team since you are a World War 2 …”
“ Well, how is it? ” Janet admired question him. “ Is that dirt or nasty soil ? ” His shaky hands were hovering around in the box after touching with finger tips.
“So am I.” Clint huffed. “ The launch pad isn’t even an advanced position. ” He took off his own sleeve shirt and laid out his jean down. Hank undid his pants and let them slide down his thighs followed by Scott who undressed himself completely and the scene moved on.
“ Man, it’s good everybody have a lifetime. I need to stretch out all the mess we made.” Tony scratched his head.
Steve knew given the pressure suggested by his teammates earlier, he decided to give them the information right now. “ Well, how about we do an orgy sex? That’s gonna to get us know more about each other.” Thor kept a big smile on his face the whole time as he reminisced on the many great orgies he's participated in the past.
Rhodey was next to do the game. He removed the curtain from the box which revealed some spikey bowling green ball, the Avengers approached of this object were priceless and surprise.
“ Good job, Clint. Let’s hope you are not mad at our tricks.” Tony said with a beaming smile while shaking hand with Clint. He seemed to displease about the way they treated him.
Steve breath out before he put both of his hands through the box without looking down. He determine to do it since many of his teammates had encourage him, he hoped he would not let down and overcome to do the challenge. Just then, Steve was touching something like a soft plushing object. On the bright side, his face turned from anxiety nervous into steadily calm after he knew what stuff he was holding. He squeezed the fabric material which didn’t create some sound. After several touch, he began to release some answers from his mouth.
“Excuse me, Steve. Do you have any stuff we can do for tonight ?” Sam suggested.
“ My final answer could be a small crickets.” This time Thor sounded more convinced. Their reaction were priceless before they released a thunderous shout.
“ I can’t keep my eyes on it…” Janet whispered toward at Carol who was watching it. Simon can’t help but covered his mouth from laughing out loud. Even Thor found this situation looked entertaining. “ Whoa, Rhodey. Don't be a naughty man.” Tony looked at him.
The Avengers began to spectacular as they exclaimed happy. Even Rhodey felt dismissed and turn around to see that a spiky shape like ball covered with grass surface. Tony patted his back while giving him some support.
“ You bet he’s gonna to do it.” Carol smiled sneaky at Janet who covered her face.
“It’s a jello-jelly.” Clint answered while feeling confused.
“ Oh Thor, are you curious how you can do it without letting us drop the ball because there is no way neither of us would dare to touch these things .” Tony winked at him.
“ Is that a spiky grass ball? ” He looked toward the Avengers while touching it.
Hank and Simon managed to snag a condom and roll it on themselves which make Clint huff out an almost soundless laugh.
This was not to say Simon and Hank had drank so much would be an understatement, those guys weren’t a strong drinker therefore it was assumed that they could get easily dozed despite drank it dry.
Tony felt confuse with his hand tickling his backhead, he thought he felt enjoyable having to sex with man and women and suddenly he felt like a bad idea when it come to bonding orgy.
Tony pushed them all around until Thor was kneeling beside Steve, everything was burning hot, but not with pain. They were all jerking their cum covered cocks as they surrounded them again. He needed more than he can articulate right now, which caused this feeling magnified. The men all felt like they were getting close as well. It was clear by the way they were all grunting more and increasing their pace, pounding him harder and faster as their orgasms mounted and tearing sobs of pleasure from him as they did.
Thor's hands were roaming over Simon’s thick butt as he kept bouncing. A moan broke free from his chest, high and sharp. He was close, so close, and he could see his orgasm coming, saw the shape of it, especially how much he was stretching to accommodate Thor's monster cock but it felt absolutely amazing. “ Oh gosh, I am flattening by this move.” Simon was sweating and panting when Thor gave him another hard thrust, shaking with the force of it.
“ Wow, that’s good. Hey Bucky, how about if I switched side with him sucking my dick? ” Tony requested. He carefully easing his softening cock out of the archer’s ass and headed toward Steve laying down.
There’s Clint showing off a little over how he already knew where to press his mouth on the Hollywood Man’s throatvby making him desire more. There’s Sam smoothing the smirk right off on Bucky’s face, hard enough to push him back into the another couch and leave him glassy-eyed and gripping Bucky’s shirt. There’s Hank taking Erik’s hand, kissing him slow along with Scott as a threesome , one hand on Scott ’s waist as he grazed his teeth over Hank’s neck.
“ Okay, I will.” Steve slowly reveal a slight smile.
“ Come on, God of Thunder. Show your fearless attitude and bring it on.” Janet cheered.
“ I thinck you need to wash your hands after that.” Janet said.
He cried out sharply as Erik gave a particularly hard thrust, and nearly screamed when they repeated the motion even harder. “ Scott, I don’t take things lightly. Since I am a big guy with the power man, you better hold your mouth.” Erik said. Scott tossed his head and arched his back, pulling himself further out and thrusting back in just as deep.
“ By the way, do you guys have any plans after the party ?” Steve patient asked.
“ Okay, Anyone is next to try out the challenge? The next one is gonna to be difficult one.” Janet asked.
Bucky finished his last sip of the liquor in his glass, setting it on the table in front of him before asking, “Feeling better?”
“ Oh gosh, this might be the worst thing I ever seen.” Janet anxiously looking at it. But Thor had shown no fear in his mind and determine to touch it without battling an eye.
“ Come on, Steve. Who make every men need some confident and justice ?” Janet shouted at him doing the challenge.
“ Well, all we can do is giving ourselves occupy with something with our dicks slap into Steve’s face.” Hank turned his head a bit.
“ Come On, Steve. I know you can do it. After all, you’re the one who can defeat the nazis, fight the giant monster or take out some supervillains. There is no way you are gonna to get scare out this small things.” Tony said.
He tried again and put his hand inside the box and that’s how he approached his little fingers on the slimy things. The Avengers were anxious to see if he could guessed what’s stuff was that.
“ Alright, let us handle this kind of situation.” Simon explained.
“ Look like we finally have our next volunteer.” Simon answered. Janet and Steve also seemed convincing. Hawkeye looked like he got busted and was forced to entertain them in front of everybody.
All of suddenly, Steve was being hostile by the guys. Simon jerked in him sharply at the same moment that Thor pressed against his prostrate and Scott tugged at his cock, and Hank clenching around and pushing himself against the three of them.
“ Okay, my hands start to sweat out. I hope I am not to pass out from getting jumpscare.” Tony gulped in his mind. His hand was hovering in the box as he slowly used his fingers to touch it. The transition of the object was smooth and had a hard shell.
" Great, because I am about to bring some liquor for all of you to enjoy." Tony pour out some liquor into the glass.
“Yeah, you know it could actually work.” Bucky said while patting Steve on his back.
Thor continued picked up these insects with both hands through the box. He finally figured out long and started guessing the answer.
“You're such a whore for cock, Steve,” Clint grins tiredly. He slowly pulls out of Steve's mouth and fists a hand in blonde hair to pull his head back.
" Great, thank for clarifying." Steve turned and faced toward to most of the guys.
Erik Josten aka Atlas was strangely invited to the Avenger Tower. He was a former criminal villain called Goliath, who constant wanted to take down with the Avengers. Like Simon, he had an ionic energy that can help him to gain channel into augmented strength and durability and the power to grow to gigantic sizes. He didn’t want to show up at first because the Avenger won’t allow him to come since he had a criminal record but Clint insisted him that they were looking for a big guy to give a suck.
“ I am sure you will gonna like it, Erik. After all, you are now part of the hero community.” Clint encouraged some support.
“ Let me guess, a plush toy.” He wondered again.
Tony slow down his breath before he put his both hands inside, he seemed to know where he was supposed to touch it. As he leaned down on the thick shell, his fingers were seen tackling on its head and it shaped like an antennae. It was rough and hard the way his hands slide smooth on this thing and moreover it had a claws. It took awhile to know what stuff he was stuffing. The Avengers look closely the way Tony was doing the challenge.
“Wow guys ,Tonight everybody who come to our party I am glad to say we have a hero who deserved some honour after all this time he lead the inspiration for us.” Tony leaded the applauded for Steve.
Tony continued touch around the stuff until he figured out and had an answered. “ I know, is that a sea lobster? ”
“ Oh yes, here’s one bottle on the table.” Tony fetched some lube to him as he rubbed some liquid on his hands.
“ Actually, only the tough guys were playing the game, which also mean your’s time is up.” Janet pointed her finger on Tony’s chest.
“ Wait, this doesn’t look so dangerous.” Clint said. “ And it’s look so moisture soft and have a shaky object.”
“ My friends, it will glad to be your service.” Thor greeted them heartfully.
“ Oh please, you are gonna to like it.” Clint begged with a wink eyes.
Simon’s eyes closed, and Thor could see and feel him let go of him, as his thrusts became uncoordinated and arrhythmic. “Simon. You are great to deserve with this crazy move. My friends would probably bring you to the highest point. ” Thor groaned, shoving in deep, and Simon could feel the heat that meant that Thor was coming as well.
“ Okay Tony, look like the last box is here for you.” Steve recalled and pulled out the curtain away from the box. They started to release a loud “Ooohhhh” from their mouths. Inside the box had a giant shaped like crab with claws and a small long tail, they didn’t know if this animal was alive or not but the way it looked, it seemed a freshy shell. If they caught a real living sea creature, Namor would be mad at them for killing his own kinds.
Team orgies had been a thing since shortly after Steve had joined with the Avenger. There had never been a discussion about it or anything - it just kind of happened. But it became a trend topic after he started to serve as a leader of the Avenger along with Iron Man. Tony may not believe himself how he manage to get corporate with Steve Roger.
“Fuck you, Simon, but you’re gorgeous…” Thor heard Clint hiss, then moan as he pressed forward, slowly until he could feel his balls against his ass.
“ Well, that was awesome,” Simon stood beside Erik.
After the event was over, the Avenger girls were leaving the Tower because Janet wanted to show some new fashion outlets with them. This left the guys finally had their moments together, they began to gather in the sitting room one by one. Surprise, some of the Avengers from different team also showed up and former supervillain who becomes Thunderbolt heroes like Atlas was presently during the party.
Hawkeye again put his hand inside the small hole of the box again, but in cautiously and steady. He slowly approached an object, when he touched it, it looked so smooth and have a liquor obstacle substance on it. The object was placed with a small plate inside the box.
“ Well, at least I try. But that’s easy one.” Steve gentled answered.
“Wait.” He was suddenly interrupted by Steve, pulling Thor back to reality. “Are you suggesting we have an...orgy after that?” Captain America asked curiously for the answer.
“ I don’t want to get touched with this sticky stuff on my body.” Rhodey looked revulsion at Wonder Man.
“ That’s correct, Thor. You truly are the God of Thunder! ” Hawkeye jump out from the chair with exciting before Simon pocked fun at him to do the challenges. The God of Thunder turned around and saw some of the crickets loosing around in the box.
They wind up in a tangled heap, everyone trying to touch each other. Tony and Steve joined along with Bucky and Sam to grind in. Steve’s head thrown back to rest against Sam’s shoulder, his arms wrapped around him from behind and allowed himself to insert the length of his cock, felt the heat around the body while wrapped his lips around behind Sam with his hands holding the head as he thrust. Tony was kissing the neck of the winter soldier who was grabbing Steve’s hip to pound.
“ Hold up, I am gonna to cum now!! ” Tony could feel his orgasm building but it still caught him off guard when it hit, his vision blurred out and started to bust some liquid inside Bucky, filling his ass full of cum. The same went for Clint and finally Thor. All these cum were filling up in Steve’s hole. But it had yet to end, Steve, Erik, Hank and Simon were spraying a heap of mindless pleasure and cum all over. Most had landed on Steve’s body. Some of them covered Scott and Sam’s faces. His tired hand slowly stop shaking his dick and eventually lay off.
“Bye Tones.”
Steve gets an almost overwhelming urge to hug him and never let go, but he doubts the billionaire would appreciate it.
Tony shrugs, tapping the bar gently, and the bartender refills his drink. He can see Steve watching the amber liquid hit the bottom of the glass, and then looking back to him.
He has two texts from Steve, and they’re both wishing him luck with dinner. Steve’s iPhone sent the message twice
“I can’t-”
“Shouldn’t you be getting home, kid?”  Tony says quietly. He can hear the exhaustion in his own voice, and normally he would be working against letting anyone hear it, but right now he doesn’t care.
jealous. He refuses to be jealous of the fact that Tony Stark smiles at everyone like that, like they’re the only person in the world.
as the billionaires eyes light with laughter, the bright sound echoing through the kitchen. He loves how Tony laughs, it’s shameless, not dampened by worrying about what anyone might think. There’s no sense of self consciousness, it’s just pure
“You’re sure?”
Tony shakes away the memory of Obie’s shark smile. Not now.
By the time he gets to the store, he’s beginning to regret going out at all.
So the lake is where he goes to remember his mother now, and Steve is the only person who’s ever come with him.
He googles Tony when he gets home that evening.
again had increased rather a lot.
“I-” Steve blinks, glancing between Tony and the clock above the door that reads 1am. “What?”
written across the screen.
A phone rings.
On the first December 16th with the Avengers, he takes his car and drives off for the day. It’s after the battle for New York, and if he doesn’t get
Obadiah couldn't just let it go.
“So tell him that.”
The question is no longer accusatory, but resigned. There is no smile on Obadiah’s face anymore, not like last time, and the man straightens the lapels of his jacket, looking Tony dead in the eye.
“Thanks. But that’s not why I called-” He’s cut off for the second time, and some of the walls slip again. Steve sees it happen, sees the real depth of emotion flickering over his face. He’s struck with the thought that Tony
When Tony opens his eyes, they’re aching. His brain clicks into gear slowly, memories filtering in. There’s someone warm underneath him, someone breathing steadily. His hand is curled too tightly around his shirt.
And then he kisses him, because he doesn’t fucking
The voice on the other side is a little louder now, and Tony grits his teeth, turning away from Steve. It’s like he doesn’t want him to hear, even though they’re still so close that it would be impossible for him

He shouts, taking a step closer. “Because you are literally the only
eyes that Tony could get lost in. He really fucking wants to just get lost in them.
“Shit.”
When Tony finally plucks up the courage and asks Steve why he’d come back and left Bucky, Steve just shakes his head, giving him such a sad look. He thinks that all of Steve's looks are sad now, though he’ll never say that to anyone else.
He doesn’t talk to Ty, but kisses him hard. Eventually, despite everything, the roaring fades to something numb.
She shrugs, folding her arms.
“Uh… yes. A bit.”
“Not a lot. You kept saying you were dizzy. You were sick as well. Really out of it.”
“It’s beautiful.”
Tony smiles, tracing a finger across Steve’s palm. All his awkwardness seems to have vanished  “You sure you can deal with dating me sweetheart?”
Tony laughs, but there’s no humour in it, and when Steve looks at him again, he can see shadows in his eyes that weren’t there before.
And then he’s gone, black coat sweeping out behind him as the door slams shut. Tony raises his eyebrows.
“Tony?” Steve’s voice is serious, and for a second his heart jumps in his chest.
Tony winces slightly. “Might be a good idea.”
“I never hated you.” Tony says again, softer now. There’s an ache in his chest, but it’s bittersweet. “God, I don’t know if I’m even
“Of course I don't. It’s not going to be fun. There are certainly some people there I’d rather avoid. But I have to.”
His phone buzzes again.
He raises his eyebrows, taking the apron and biting back a laugh.
He pauses, turning around at the use of his first name.
He should have stopped loving Tony Stark years ago, but it’s too late now. He couldn’t then, he can’t now. He isn’t sure he’ll ever be able to.
He can
The snow is falling heavily now, but he can’t feel the cold. Snowflakes settle on Steve’s face, and he’s so beautiful that it hurts.
“Obadiah Stane sends his regards.”
“He was your
Dark curly hair, expensive suit. The boy named Ty from the past- The one against the wall is Tony. He would know him anywhere. Steve’s first instinct is anger. Tony with someone else, clearly drunk-
It’s Steve’s turn to blush now, and Tony feels a twinge of satisfaction as the Captain looks away. When he turns his attention back to Fury, the director is watching them with raised eyebrows, a humourless smile on his face.
Steve’s next question answers that.
His voice is steady. He doesn’t argue with Tony often, even though the billionaire has so many secrets, and Steve let’s him deal with shit alone even though sometimes the look in his eyes after work makes him want to kill someone. But this-
anything but this.
“That’s why you haven’t told him about Ty. That’s why Obadiah didn’t do anything.”
Steve loves him. He
“Can we get coffee afterwards?”
Tony is half way to his feet when Rhodey’s hand curls around his wrist gently.
“Are you sure your
“Fine,” he says with a laugh. “It was incredible. Happy?”
Tony raises his eyebrows, and something dark and almost empty flickers in his gaze before it vanishes, and a smile tugs at the corners of his lips. Something tense in Steve uncoils at the sight.
Obadiah raises his eyebrows, leaning back in his seat. “Tony boy, this isn’t an interrogation.”
He knows because when Tony had woken up alone in Ty’s hotel bed three years ago, he had called Rhodey first. It had been the first time he’d broken down in front of his friend, first time he’d reached out to him for help. Rhodey had come, and Tony had never really forgotten the look on his face when he had seen him. He had been convinced there and then that his friend was going to find Ty and kill him. He hadn’t, but if Ty had been there-
But then Steve had mercy. He looked up at Bucky's open smile and something warm inside of him spread itself out in his body. He loved this smile. Slowly, his eyes locked with Bucky's, he moved upwards, still aware the man, watched every single move he made. Of course, Tony was also his close friend but Bucky’s relationship was what he saw him as precious.
“ This is crazy, I am about to lose my mind. “ Erik touched his forehead, hoping he didn’t get caught himself throw up. He deeply hold his throat while breath softly.
“ Well, I am.” Bucky answered Steve. “ So do Thor, Clint and Me.” Tony agreed.
“ That’s almost close, Tony. But keep going.” Carol gave a point while the Avengers nodded their heads.
“ Well, me? ” Steve curious answered.
“He’s very flexible.” Erik grabbed the archer’s shoulder while flexing the muscle.
At almost exact same moment both Steve and Sam came as well. Each of them moaning into the other's ass as the vibrations just making their orgasms more powerful. Each of them shook from the pleasure their whole bodies seeming to vibrate trying to contain it.
“Ooh, yeah,” Clint sighed, stood between those men whom pushed each of their hips. “How is it Steve?! Isn’t it great?! Cause that was only a taste of what’s to come!”
“ Tony, I am sure this is just a game. So please take this calmly and steady.” Thor muttered said.
“ Geez, Clint. I never wish you dare to touch that stuff.” Rhodey shot an eye on him.
“ Just bring any hands in any sides but slow and steady.” Clint gave a shoutout while felt cynicism about it.
Scott Lang would like to have Erik being his soulmates and they started let go from the drink and kiss smooching. The tastes of the alcohol make the guys doesn’t matter if they willing to embrace the anticipate.
Tony look liked he had been accepting surrender and shrugs. “ Okay, you all want me to do the challenge. Challenge accept.”
“ Are you kidding me, there is no way this look like a monster.” Clint smugly smile at him.
Erik met his gaze, and grinned a little wickedly. “Hank, I think Scott’s response looks interesting ,” he said.
He put his hand on the plate before he leaped out and felt tickling. His hand seemed to have a weird, smelly sense he sniffed. “ Eww, What’s that ?” Simon looked toward the Avengers.
“ I am not sure it is poisonous or not? ” Simon guessed while looking at it. A stunned Rhodey went pale when he overheard this. Carol and Janet were covering their mouths from laughing. Man, this was humiliated.
“ Don’t worry, I can take care of this business.” Simon switched himself to get f@# by the God of Thunder. Clint grabbed the cheek of the man and gave him some small kiss. Thor seemed to take Clint’s pleasured gasp as a positive response and suddenly stepped back.
" Well, most of us didn't since it was only some beverage on the bar." Hank said.
Hank took a deep breath, and Scott could see the tension under him leave. His smile was weak but joyful when he looked down to kiss the lip of Scott where he wanted it. Erik started fingering Ant-Man harder, making him grunt in pain. He could felt himself stretched open, longing for something thicker, making soft noises that get lost in Hank’s flesh. Erik lifted Scott up while Hank stand behind to shove his lube covered cock inside the small hole of Atlas. He started to push all three together.
Tony was pulling the napkin curtain away from the big box. Which revealing some object inside the hole of the box. Both side of the box revealing some small holes cutter so that the player could go through his or her hand inside to touch the object while guessing it. The heroes who watched the challenge were Thor, Clint, Rhodey , Carol, Simon and Janet. They were siting on the couch and chair in the living hall to watch the reaction of Steve. They knew he was a super-serum soldier, despite trying to make him felt the nerve every time he put his hands into the hole to play the game.
“ Oh you are right. Hey guys, let switch some positions right now.” Bucky answered. All movement seemed to stop around them.
“ Did you feel something, Tony ? ” Steve asked while Rhodey and Clint were twerking their eyebrows.
“ Oh you are right. I kinda like that idea. But is there’s anywhere how to do so ?” Scott asked.
“ Maybe pick on the left.” Rhodey suggested him to do so. Tony cautioned put his hand into the small hole of the box.
Steve never did get to use any though because of his teammates since his partner encouraged him to not let the other Avenger downs, he closed his eyes and sigh a breath.
Tony had a bright bulb in his brain and started answering to Steve. “ Well, we do have a plan afterwards and Thor is exciting because he wants to tell you something.”
“Oh my gosh, this feels fucking amazing…” Hank groaned.
“ Fuck, dude! I can’t believe anyone can work a cock this good! ” Bucky gasped.
Then Clint leaned closer to Tony’s ear and whispered something that Steve couldn’t hear.
“ No need to throw shade at you. I am glad Bucky was there to pull out some giant explosive gun that can manage to take down the frost giants.” Steve said.
Steve hummed a positive sound, staring dazedly at nothing in particular, before replying, “Thanks for making me a dork , you all .”
“ Hey, come on. You can do this, Rhodey.” Tony approached him while his hand slowly tick off the thin layer of the ball. “ Okay, do you get it what object it is? ” Carol confident asked him.
The first brief moment of entry gave Steve some ways, Tony fingered stroked his jaw, gently pulling him away from Steve’s mouth, and Steve felt another cock pressed against his lips. His eyes turned up to see Bucky with a big smile and felt his fingers stroke his lips to encourage them open. Steve took him willingly into his mouth. Bucky’s cock tasted faintly of soap, but he sucked him eagerly, enthusiastically, without reservation because the other guy’s cocks . Bucky threaded his fingers through Steve’s hair and moved his hips , fucking his mouth around the whimpers the others caused.
“ I am not sure if I am going to drink that?  ” Erik looked down on his glass while feeling nervous.
“ Wow, I like how Steve can continue to pull this move. It won’t be long if we all gather around to give him some tastes.” Tony continued to hold Steve’s hip.
“Thor, is this okay?” Clint asked, voice gravelly and restrained. “I need this, but just tell me... if I need more energy.”
Scott Lang was there because he once helped the Avengers during the mission. He always get underappreciated despite of his efforts that give them some coordinated where to plan their attacks and strategy. He hoped that night he could enjoy some moment with them.
“ Okay, it’s game over. Anyone know what’s the next plan ?” Janet sincerely asked the Avengers.
" Oh well, here we go again." Steve was so happy that this might actually worked. The team was closer then ever, working together in the field and getting along at home. He never been proud to take the title of the team, a smile on his face.
Hank and Scott were on the bar table with Scott let his tongue slide the cock under Hank, The push and pull of his cock inside always sent him soaring however something was pulling him from that pleasure. Erik was being quite vocal about how he was enjoying himself.
“ Well, I didn’t mean it my friend. Just stay calm.” Thor gentled smiled before him and they continued it.
“ Yeah, me too. I really need to pump up some energy.” Rhodey suggested.
“ Man, I never get use about wearing this.” Sam talked about how every guy needed the condom.
Tony clapped his hands and pulled the sleeve before he deep down his breath to do the challenge. “ Alright, which sides am I suppose to put my hand first ?”
“ Okay, now that Rodney is done, who’s next?” Simon guessed. Carol and Tony were looking at him before they turned to the others and said. “ Well, It’s turn Simon.” Janet pointed him before he got hotshot.
“ Trust me, It won’t hurt you. It’s gonna to make it work.” Simon fist hold while cheering him. “ Just grab it. Just go for it.” Rhodey continued to touch the layer of the object completely until he realised that the Avengers were trying to drag him down. He knew the surface layer had a gentle tickle as each giving wand forms a cushion. He guessed what was it. Thor knew his trustworthy and fearless attitude had helped him to win the challenge.
“ What is that? ” Steve continued.
“ Mhmm, I don’t know guys. I hope it’s not a dangerous living creature that is hiding in the box.” Steve grunted.
“Come on, let’s see if you like to get spring on. ” Scott coaxes, rubbing steadily until Steve was a shaking mass of nerves in his arms. “Show me, let me see what you like. I want to make you feel good.”
Of course, Steve moved between them all. Pulling the buttons, chasing mouths, and stripping out of his shirt, pant and shoes got another hot stripper. He’s the leader, and he’s more than happy to lead the way in getting naked.
Hank irritated whether he could join any gang while gesturing with his hands on the other hips. He tried to get someone attention.
The Avengers were thrilled to see if the Markman Archer will guessed correctly in this challenge.
Steve yelped a bit as he felt Thor's lubed cock pop into his ass. He still wasn't entirely used to the feeling but he went in much easier than the other Avengers. Scott and Sam were opposite between him trying to suck the skin of the dick. Bucky grabbed Clint from behind, fucks his way inside as Thor kept fucking Steve.
Thor could hear Clint’s laughing and Simon let out an impressive moan, but then things get muffled. He was holding the archer’s back while giving him some gangbang .
But this time, their response reacted with cheerful smile and joy with fist held firmly together. “ That’s correct. You finally did it, Steve.” Tony congratulated. Carol and Rhodey gave a wink smile at Steve. He looked around and saw inside the box was a Captain America plush toy that can bought from the gift store. He seemed pleased to see a plush toy of himself.
“ Yeah, It always makes me cum so hard.” Erik answered.
The Other Avengers were cheering his name aloud while some clapping their hands . “ TONY ! TONY !! TONY !!! TONY !!! ”
Wonder Man was nervous as he stood in front of the box, he hoped it was not an object that could end up killing him. He pulled out the curtain from the next box which resulted some of the Avengers felt disgusting and unbelief. It had a plate filled with oily, muddy soil and small little things ran around the slimy mixture.
“ Let me guess, Is that earthworm that I am touching it ?” Simon wandered.
There was Hank Pym, also known as Giant Man. Shown up during the party. He wanted to dedicate the Avengers team effort despite suffering from bipolar disorder that cause the misunderstand the team due to his actions. He was lucky that the Avengers still invited him to join the gang together. But he isn’t sure whether if he could bond an orgy? Didn't at least try this and his team fell apart he's never forgive himself. That's just so crazy. This was one of the difficult decisions he had to make and for someone like him that was saying a lot. He couldn't help but wonder what everyone else was thinking.
This is basically just badly written porn with feelings. I'm so sorry.
“I told her I needed a personal trainer, not assassination lessons,” Tony’s lips curve into a smirk.
Pepper has ordered Tony to stay away from the office for as long as he needs, which suits him perfectly because he’s always preferred to be in his workshop anyway. He does the whole boardroom and meetings thing when he has to, but he’s always been better when he’s elbow deep in metalwork or computer parts. It calms his mind to be able to build things, to shape things. After dusting off the Iron Man plans, Tony dived head first into building the thing. The project was something he had thought about since he was a child, but he’d never had the means to do it until now. So he spends his recovery time crafting and shaping, bringing the exo-armour to life. Each part is a shield, made to measure to the curves and angles of his body. Each section is an extension of himself just stronger, better. He has to build the machines to help him build it first, and that means that he has to upgrade J.A.R.V.I.S. to do it, pride blooming in his chest as he watches his finest creation evolving and learning. It makes him feel powerful and useful. It helps him to push the feeling of weakness that Rumlow’s attack has left him with to the back of his mind. It feels good. And if he’s drinking a little more than he usually does, he tries not to think about that either.
"Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk."
“Huh.”
****PLEASE HEED THE WARNINGS ON THIS CHAPTER****
“Don’t S.H.I.E.L.D. usually handle all that shit?” Tony asks.  “I mean, aren’t you guys like, their super sexy superhero branch?”
“Yeah, well…”
Tony looks up from what he’s doing with a puzzled look on his face. Clint and Natasha? Huh. He waves his hands over the floating images of the Iron Man armour and it disappears before he throws a tarp over the already fabricated parts on another of the workbenches. He’s not sure he wants S.H.I.E.L.D. finding out about what he’s doing. At least, not yet.
“Yeah, been busy with these idiots,” Sam jerks his head towards the other Avengers, which gets a snort of laughter from Steve.
boy, this is new.  Rogers doesn’t say anything, doesn’t break eye contact, but he does extend his own hand to shake Tony’s, and he’s firm and warm and
It’s the Avengers.
, thanks to you,” Tony’s grin is a little lopsided as he jabs  Steve on the chest, which he tries not to find adorable because the sub is pretty drunk.
Steve tilts his head to one side as he considers Tony, the twitch of his lips slowly becoming a smirk as he takes in the fire on Tony’s eyes, the jut of his defiant chin.  He’s young, very early twenties he thinks, and very, very pretty.
Tony eventually claws his way up through the darkness to the light and when he blinks awake he finds himself in his bed at the mansion. The curtains are drawn, the bedside lamps throwing a soft light across his bedroom. He can’t tell what time of day it is, but he doesn’t think he cares right now. He’s home, safe.  He’s propped up, angled to one side against a wedge of pillows behind him and he lies still as he takes stock of his body. His toes, feet and legs seem fine, but there’s a dull, stabbing ache in his ass and his breath stutters when his brain supplies fragments of why. Moving up, his stomach and chest feel a little sore, the sheets a little lumpy from bandages he thinks, but nothing too bad. His shoulders are aching and sore, but his face feels the worst. He brings a hand up to feel and notices a cannula in the back of it and follows the tube up to a drip hanging by his bed.  He skims his fingers as gently as he can over his face and winces when he feels stitches and swelling. He flops his hand back down and blinks at the ceiling. How long has be been out? What happened? Who found him?
“Well, there’s that,” Tony replies when he can breathe again.  “But are they right?”
“Tell me, please? I...I need to know,” Tony pleads.
Lastly, yes I lifted another lil' chunk of dialogue from IM1.
“And how do you propose I do that birdie?” Tony tries really hard to keep his rising anger out of his tone but fails miserably, but Clint just shrugs it off like he usually does.
It takes him the rest of the morning to compose a reply.
“Captain Rogers,” Todd says, his smile wider now that Steve has reached the desk, and he points at small electronic box on the counter in front of him.  “If you would please sign in using the scanner here. Mr Stark is expecting you.”
“Reed managed to open up yet another portal,” Nat almost slips on the goo left behind by one of the creatures after Sam shot it.  “Eeww.”
"Captain Rogers, leader of the Avengers but please, just call me Steve.” Steve returns warmly, a tiny twitch at the side of his mouth giving away how amused he is.
Steve uses the time to think about how he intends the meeting to go. He knows that his reason for being here is flimsy at best, but he’s been thinking about Tony since they’d met at the function two weeks ago.  There’s something about him that Steve feels naturally drawn to. There’s so much he wants to know about the sub, so much to discover. He’s not naive enough to think that Tony will want to get to know him in return, but Steve thinks he’s fascinating and he wants to know more. S.H.I.E.L.D. already has a contract with Stark Industries to supply weaponry and tech, but Steve thinks that a contract exclusively with the Avengers would be extremely beneficial.  S.H.I.E.L.D has a lot of red tape, but the Avengers are pretty much an independant team. Yes, they work closely with S.H.I.E.L.D., but that’s only because they’re the only agency out there currently equipped to deal with what the Avengers do. Steve really can’t see the army rocking up to a fire fight with beings from another dimension and being able to handle it with the same level as S.H.I.E.I.L.D. Those guys know what they’re doing and they don’t hesitate. Perhaps Steve can approach this from the point of view that Stark Industries would make some serious money from a deal with the Avengers, and in turn the team get the latest in defensive tech.
CAPTAIN AMERICA!”
“Well believe it or not Tony, I actually like to go out and have fun with my friends,” Steve smirks and Natasha laughs even more.  “Or did you expect me to be the kind of fella who stays at home wearing khakis with a crease ironed down the middle while he listens to the wireless every night? I may be 98 sweetheart, but I'm not dead.”
* * * * * * * * * * *
It’s even more gorgeous in red and gold and Tony is definitely deeply in love.
Yeah.
“I am,” He says eventually and gives Tony a warm smile, blue eyes lingering on the sub’s plump lips for a moment before flitting back to his eyes.  “Although sometimes I wonder if there’s something missing.”
submit, to anyone,
“We did it Jarvis, we really fucking did it!” Tony breaths in wonder, eyes wide and hair wild.  “A mini arc reactor. It’s perfect, you’re perfect.”
Did i lift some of the dialogue directly from IM1? Yes, yes i did and i regret absolutely nothing.
An update on this story
“Aww, are you guys having a moment?” Tony interrupts and a look of realisation crosses Sam’s face.
“Uh-huh,” Rhodey’s brow creases in worry, but he knows that Tony will tell him when he’s good and ready.  “You still need a shower though.”
“And why would that be I wonder?” Tony mimics Steve’s head tilt.
Howard hasn’t allowed Tony to go and see Rogers, despite the fact that he was being rehabilitated in an SI facility.  He didn’t deserve to be around a Dominant like Captain America, wasn’t worthy of being in the presence of an Alpha. The perfect Alpha.  He would spit insults at Toy about how he would never be good enough for someone like Rogers, never be enough, for any Dominant really, but especially not Rogers. Someone like Captain America deserved someone pure, obedient, quiet, not a sub who ran his mouth constantly, and had ideas above his station.  Not that Tony fucking cared. Captain America was dead, a legend passed down through history.
“Great, I’ll speak with her on the way out,” Steve sits forward to put his glass down then stands and heads to the door.  He stops next to Tony and puts a hand very lightly on his shoulder and it feels like a searing brand to Tony. Then Steve leans down, using a little of his weight on Tony’s shoulder to make his point as he gets level with the side of Tony’s head, and being sure to enunciate every word he purrs in Tony’s ear “It’s been a pleasure,
"My dear boy, no need to apologise,” General No.1 says on his right, his cheeks bright red from the amount of port he’s drunk this evening.  “Duty comes first. We know that better than most.”
* * * * * * * * * * *
“We’ll stop when you tell us why you’re suddenly not seeing anyone,” Nat puts down her fork to cross her arms and fix Steve with a look at would make lesser men squirm in their seats.  “Although, we pretty much already know.”
So he goes about his business of leading the world’s only team of superheroes, but at the same time, he also speaks to government officials, sits in on legislation committees and speaks at activist rallies. And on top of that, he advises the military and lectures on weapon safety. It's a pretty full schedule, but then Steve has never been one to sit idle, not even when he was skinny and under doctor’s orders to stay in bed.  He’s always been a stubborn asshole and that’s never going to change.
“Steve, and no thank you, I'm good,” Pepper gives him a nod and goes back to her desk, leaving Steve with the view while he waits.  She sneaks little looks at him as she gets back to work, but he pays it no mind. It’s not the usual staring he gets, this is much more calculating, like she’s assessing a threat. Which he thinks is fair considering that she seems to essentially run Tony’s life.  He’s torn from the view when he hears a door swing open with a bang to his left and Tony comes striding out, apparently still on his call.
He’s still not entirely sure why they gave him the Alpha Dom designation, he just thinks of himself as Steve. But the powers that be seemed to think the serum made him “more” in all ways, including his Dominant side. Not that he’s really had much of a chance to figure out how the whole Alpha thing makes him any different from just being a normal Dominant. Sure, he’s had lovers since he came out of the ice - it’s been a decade, he has needs. It’s just that he’s not felt completely connected to anyone on that level yet, not since ...since Bucky. The pain is still there, and Steve knows that it always will be. Bucky was his, and he always will be. It will always feel like there’s a part of him missing, he knows this. Any bonded pair feels like he does when one of them...when one of them passes. It's a void that won’t ever fade, always there.  It is possible to bond again, Steve knows that, but it’s extremely rare. There are only a handful of recorded rebonds, and because that's over centuries, Steve knows just how rare they are. And he thinks he’s ok with that, truly. He’s made peace with the fact that he won’t find another bond. But somehow, since he came out of the ice and found himself thrown 70 year in the future, he’s had a few brief and fleeting hopes that being in the future might mean he stands a better chance of finding someone.
“Am I missing something here?” Sam asks in confusion as he looks at Steve then Natasha.
Seriously, his hand is literally the size of Tony’s face.
“Let’s try this again,” Tony gets himself ready for another attempt with the boot thrusters.  “Day 11, Test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, DUM-E is still on fire safety. But if you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. And please don’t follow me around with that buddy, because it makes me feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down,” Tony says to the ‘bot, and DUM-E makes a sad little noise and lowers his arm. Tony’s face softens at that. “Hey, if something happens, then come in.” DUM-E makes a much happier sound at that. “OK, we’re gonna start off with just 1% thrust capacity. And three...two...one…”
“Gotta piss,” is all Tony manages to force out before he’s heading for the bathroom at an almost jog. He’s relieved to find it empty for the moment and goes to one of the basins so that he can splash cold water on his face and get a fucking grip on his libido before he has to go back out to his friends.  He leans his forehead against the cool surface of the mirror over the basins and tries to remember how to breathe. Tony Stark does
“And you Captain Rogers,” Todd is positively beaming now as Steve moves off towards the elevator.
Tony’s chest does a weird fluttery thing and if smiling didn’t hurt so much, he thinks his smile would be wider than his face right now. Steve did that, for him.
“I don’t doubt it,” Steve says, and he does smile now, soft and genuine.  “You’re not at all what I expected from Howard’s son.”
Pepper calls him regularly to keep him updated on Tony’s recovery, even though he hasn’t asked her to, and he appreciates it more than she knows.
“Gonna teach you a lesson you little sub bitch,” He hisses in Tony’s ear, a hand against his head pushing the side of his face that he hit on the basin into the tile making him cry out as blazing pain shoots across his skull.  “Pretty thing like you with that mouth and no collar acting like a whore. You want it. You
“Captain Rogers,” The blonde switch behind the glass desk says warmly as she stands. She has no name tag like the people in the main lobby downstairs, which means that most people  who make it up to this floor have probably already met her previously. She extends her hand to Steve and he takes it. “I’m Katherine, i’m the administrator on this floor. Mr Stark is currently running a little late so please, make yourself comfortable while you wait.  Can I get you anything to drink? We have excellent coffee up here.”
“Pepper called me.”
“Having fun Capsicle?” Tony grins as he mimics Steve stance against the railings.
It’s another week before Tony can get out of bed and get down to his workshop. His legal team come to see him in bed along with Pepper and the police.  Pepper’s eyes are red-rimmed and bloodshot and she never lets go of his hand when he has to recount every last detail that he can recall to the police. He sobs silently into her shoulder when the others have left and she strokes his hair and holds him close.
“Who carried me?”
“Beat it Fonzie,” Tony fires a warning shot as his eyes go back to his reflection and he tries to make his hair look less like someone grabbed hold of it.
That’s…holy
,” Tony almost squeals (yes, Tony Stark squeals) with excitement and delight as he makes a beeline for Captain America, Rhodey forgotten because
“Wait, the Tony you talk about is Tony Stark?” Sam asks Rhodey.
Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, brat.
Steve hears a door open and a stunning red headed switch strides into view. He stands, because that’s what you do whenever a lady enters a room, and she beams at him, walking over and holding out a hand.
“Now that I can confirm is wholly true,”Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows at him and Steve’s smirk gets bigger. “You should swing by my office at SI, let me show you just how much fun I can be.”
This was my NaNo project for this year, and CH9 got me past my 50k goal, but it's being such a fucking bitch to write. I took a couple of days off writing when NaNo finished to see if that helped, but alas....
His phone starts ringing as he stares at Tony’s text, desperately trying to think of a reply.
. Um….

“As much as I appreciate the fact that you’ve all been my personal matchmakers for the last decade” Steve complains,  “last time a checked, I didn’t need any help in that department.”
I'm so sorry Tony. I promise that the next chapter it's comin' up Stark. Seriously, i'm planning on like, 10k of porn next chapter.
Coulson says, more gunfire sounding.
Also, if you're reading this Romilly, you thieving piece of shit, I hope you step on lego and become deathly allergic to your favorite food. Fuck you.
There's rock bottom, then fifty feet of crap, then Tony Stark.
“Huh?”
Just know that this will get a rewrite at some point later this year, so this chapter will have ALL of the porn. I basically just want this story finished so that I can move on with something else.
“And are you? Happy?” Tony asks. He has to tilt his head up a little to look at Steve’s face. The Captain scratches his beard thoughtfully for a moment and Tony watches several emotions pass over his face.
Rhodey looks back at Tony who hasn’t yet seen what’s going on at the bar, thank fuck. Maybe he can get Tony out of here before he sets eyes on the Captain because fuck, Rhodey really doesn’t want to have to deal with this shit right now.  He starts to make his way to the dance floor so that he can drag Tony out of the crowd and away, but all the writhing bodies are making it difficult. He gets there eventually, wedging himself in between Tony and a very young looking sub.
Steve has to stifle a snort of laughter at that because this man has never put duty before anything before, none of them have. God he wants to get out of here. Just a few more hours...
Tony is frozen to the couch.  He knows that he should get up and see Steve out but he can’t seem to get his body to move.  He feels...he actually feels like he’s about ten seconds away from coming in his pants completely untouched and that's….
“Yeah?” Is all he manages to breathe out when Steve’s mouth gets close enough to his ear that he can feel warm breath against his skin, sending a wave of goosebumps skittering across his flesh.
Tony has dragged him to one of New York’s most exclusive clubs and is now watching his best friend being sandwiched between no less than three pretty young things that are grinding all over him. Tony is well on his way to being blind drunk and he doesn’t seem to have a care in the world right now as he joins the writhing bodies on the dance floor. The only reason that Rhodey had said yes to this was to get Tony out of his basement workshop and back to reality. He knows how Tony gets if he hides for too long, knows how hard it is for him to adjust back to work and life. He also knows that what he really needs is a firm hand to take him down and apart with cuffs and a whip, then piece him back together with praise and soft touches. He knows that he’ll offer that later when they get home, because he always does when Tony gets like this. And Tony will say no, like he always does, because he refuses to put Rhodey in that position. Then he’ll go to one of his preferred places tomorrow and have a stranger do it instead because that means he doesn’t have to burden his friends with having to take care of him. Again.
Katherine nods with a smile and then disappears towards the corridor, presumably towards a kitchen area that Steve can’t see as he settles himself in one of the leather chairs.  She returns shortly with Steve’s coffee in a glass cup and saucer and places it on the squat table in front of him before going back to her desk. A comfortable silence settles over them both, Katherine tapping away on her keyboard as she works.  Steve reaches for his coffee and Katherine is right: it really is amazing coffee. But then, this is Stark Industries, why would the coffee be any less than perfect.
“Anthony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries. But you can just call me Tony.”
Steve remembers Clint wrapping his jacket around Tony to cover as much of him as possible, and then moving to slide his arms gently around the bleeding sub, pulling him in close to lift him up  and get him the fuck out of there. Happy had been waiting in the car outside and he’d driven to the hospital as fast as he could, while Steve and Rhodey both tried to soothe Tony with quiet voices and gentle touches.  Both of the Dominants had realised that they had to keep Tony awake, keep him calm before he could spiral into a head space that no sub wants to go to. It’s an extremely dangerous place to be, and there are recorded cases of subs who have never come back from that experience. Once at the hospital, Steve hadn’t let go of Tony until the ER doctors prised their patient away from his arms with gentle reassurances.  After that, Steve never left Tony’s side the entire time he was in the hospital, watching over him while he was being kept in a medically-induced coma to stop his brain from swelling further after the impact with the basin.
Just a little interlude before our boys meet again.
Another finger is shoved in and Tony screams again as he feels something tear. The pain is blinding and there’s nothing he can do about it. He thinks he might be sick as he feels his asshole get wet not with lube, but with blood. His head swims as he fights down the bile and the panic, trying to get the hand that’s trapped between his hip and the wall out so that he can flail behind him, but the man sees it coming and stops shoving his finger inside Tony to grab his wrist before he can try and claw his face. That arm joins the first in being twisted behind him, and how fucking big are this guy’s hands that he can hold both of Tony’s arms behind him with just one hand?
Pepper is waiting by one of the last doors along the corridor and Steve walks past her and into the office to find himself in large, airy open space.  There’s another wall of glass, this time behind a huge desk with no less than four computer screens. Beyond it isn’t a boardroom, but New York herself sprawling out beneath them and it takes Steve’s breath away.
“Your visitor’s pass will give you access to most of the building, including the top floor where Mr Stark’s office is. Please make sure it’s visible at all times,” He hands Steve the pass, which he quickly clips to the pocket lip of his suit jacket.  “The elevator to the left behind me will take you directly to the penthouse level.”
“Wow,” He breaths and steps over to the huge glass panes.
* * * * * * * * * * *
“OK, let's do this right,” Tony says to the workshop at large. “Start mark, half a metre and to the right. DUM-E, you’re on standby for fire safety. U, roll it.” Tony takes a deep breath and gets into a stance he feels will be best.  “Activate hand controls. OK, we’re gonna start off nice and easy. See if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. In three...two...one…”
* * * * * * * * * * *
“Well, this has been a delight,” Tony lies as he looks around at the other Dominants, all still speechless. He gives Steve a lingering look from under his lashes  and, in return, receives an eyebrow raise and a hint of a smile.  “Captain, you know where my office is so don’t be a stranger. Office hours are 8 to 6. Good evening gentlemen.”
“Jarvis, do you still have all my M.I.T. files locked down in your auxiliary memory banks?” Tony asks and waves his hands in a very specific way in front of him so that blue, floating numbers and shapes appear out of thin air in front of him.
“Yeah, ah,” Rhodey replies.  “She’s worried about you. You need to me to go kick Captain America’s ass?”
“Nooooooo,” Tony complains while trying to grind his hips against Rhodey.
he wants it all, but his brain is keeping him in check, reminding him that he’s not a possession, a trinket to be owned, that’s not who he is. Submitting to Steve, to anyone, would mean that he’s no longer free to work, to run Stark Industries. That would all pass to Steve if they bonded, and Steve doesn’t strike Tony as the kind of Dominant that would let him carry on doing what he does. He’s Captain America, Mr Apple Pie Life. He’d expect Tony to take a back seat, stay at home, do the dishes. Well fuck that, never happening. Maybe he can get Steve to fuck him tonight just so that he can say he’s fucked the Star Spangled Man once. A sparkly new notch on his bedpost, something to tell the grandkids about.  Yeah, Tony can do that, and that’s exactly how he’d like tonight to end. He pushes off the mirror and takes a look at himself. He looks wrecked, which is actually OK if he’s honest. Hopefully it’ll make Steve want to fuck him up even more.
Clint asks through the comm from his perch, picking off another couple of the babies with one arrow. “
Tony mentally shook the image from his mind as he forced his thoughts back into the stifling hot room and the drone of the Dom talking to him. This one was ...Master Sergeant? First Sergeant? Fucked if Tony can remember. Fist Master Boring McFuckwit is what Tony keeps calling him in his head and he giggles to himself, hiding his smirk behind his tumbler of really rather excellent single malt whisky. Smoky, with a hint of peat, rich and delicious.  Tony doesn’t drink like his father, not to get drunk. He drinks because it helps with his somewhat crippling social anxiety, which no-one except Jarvis and Rhodey know about. Plus, it all fits in with the outward public image that he’s been so carefully cultivating over the years. Oh, the copious amounts of sex with a neverending string of beautiful people is definitely not a cover. Tony loves sex. And he loves very pretty people, so the sex is just…..for pure pleasure. But everything else that the public sees?  Yeah, that’s all a carefully placed mask. The Tony Stark Media Face, Rhodey named it, and he’s not wrong. But its a wall of armour that Tony uses to keep people out, the people that don’t matter anyway. There are those who know him for his true self, and he can count them on one hand: Rhodey, Pepper and Happy. And J.A.R.V.I.S. of course and yes, his AI absolutely counts as a person. Not even Howard and Maria know him, not really. Obie thinks he does, but that’s just because Tony lets him believe it.
“Steve,” Rhodey looks a little puzzled for a moment before he catches on. “Didn’t let go until he handed you over to the ER doctors.”
To everyone who has left comments, kudos, and love on this fic - I cherish each and every one of you deeply <3 I hope that I can one day finally finish this fic as a way to show how much I love and appreciate you all.
“Thank you for the coffee Katherine, it was delicious,” Steve says with a warm smile, because manners cost nothing and the Alpha in him likes it if people flush a little when he praises them and hey, he never said he wasn’t a little bit of an asshole.
come from?
“Thank you Todd, I appreciate it,” Steve smiles.  “Have a good day.”
“Heeeeeeeey!”
“It sure is,” Steve hasn’t been up this high much since he came out of the ice. Something about height not sitting right with him since… since he lost him.  But this view is nothing short of spectacular.
Sam grouses.
“I apologise for my friend the fanboy here,” Rhodey steps forward looking exasperated and offers his hand to Steve.  “Colonel James Rhodes Sir, nice to meet you.”
“Can I get you something to drink Captain Rogers?” Pepper asks eventually.
* * * * * * * * * * *
“You’re a doll!”
* * * * * * * * * * *
As Tony suspected, getting Howard to sign off on the things he needs from R&D is a pain in the ass. He gets interrogated about why he needs all the items he’s asked for, and what he intends to do with them, and Tony only just manages to convince his father to sign the forms. It’s fucking ridiculous that he has to get his father to give him permission when it’s Tony that’s the CEO of the whole fucking company, but R&D is still mainly under Howard’s remit despite him being semi-retired, so everything has to go through him first. Add to the fact that for some reason, certain items on the list require a Dominant’s permission to be used, especially by a submissive, and Tony is in a fucking foul mood when Steve next calls him.
“Urgh….”
“Oh, that much is obvious,” Steve shoots back, and he keeps his smile soft. This kid is…well, he’s someone that Steve thinks he could form something with. A friend, or maybe...  “You’re much more fun.”
I promise you guys that chapter 9 is coming, it;s just kicking my ass is all.
“Let him in J,” Tony sighs and slumps against his workbench.
Steve can’t help but agree because he knows that subs still have a shitty time when it comes to all things official or legal. It’s one of the reasons that he stays as involved as he can with the Submissives Rights movement, to lend his voice and his standing as not only an Alpha, but as Captain America to try and get laws changed. Submissives still don’t have anywhere near equal standing with Dominants, something that Steve has abhorred since he was a child.
* * * * * * * * * *
“I’m here on behalf of the Avengers actually, but i’m sure that Miss Potts has already told you,” Steve stops in front of Tony’s desk as he walks behind it and sprawls in his chair.  He waves a hand in the direction of the couch and chairs and Steve settles in one of the chairs. It gives him a direct line of sight to the door and it’s an old habit that will never fade.  He’s a soldier after all.
Tony, c’mon,” Rhodey takes Tony by the wrist and starts to drag him away from the dancefloor and out to the club lobby.  He knows that Happy will be waiting outside with the car, and the mansion is only about 30 minutes away. Tony is trying to pull away, not getting far, and then he hears:
Yeah, Tony is totally hiding. But hiding means inventing, and he’s been doing that almost non-stop for the whole four days.  Food appears as if by magic (Pepper or Happy more than likely), and he passes out for cat naps on the couch whenever J.A.R.V.I.S deems him too exhausted to carry on and shuts down all his computers.  He’s actually got a lot done, and the R&D department of S.I. have now got more than enough to keep them occupied for the next five years at least, but he still feels like he has an itch under his skin that he just can’t seem to scratch. He’s jerked off more times than he wants to admit, but it just seems to make it worse. A near constant four day hard-on is a painful and frustrating thing.
And if you wanted to come yell at me on tumblr, my ask is always open: @fishcustardandclintbarton.
“Pervert,” Rhodey laughs, then his face turns serious.  “You OK Tones?”
“You’re not paying attention Stark,” Natasha sounds frustrated as she pulls Tony back up off the mat in the mansion gym again.  He resolutely ignores Clint’s snickering from his perch on the window ledge. “And you’re getting frustrated which is making you sloppy.”
Ty takes a single step towards them and Natasha is between them in seconds.
He’s no longer listening; all he can feel is dread. He would have thought that by the second month of being in New York after graduating, the dread and panic would have lessened.
He sounds like a child, he
“It’s okay,” Steve says softly, taking his wrists gently and pulling him tight against him. Tony fights it, because he doesn’t want his pity, he wants to protect him and he just wants him to be
The last person Tony expects to see across the bar from him is Steve Rogers.
“Obie?”
“Having a drink. It’s the only thing worth doing around here.”
Steve stirs, rolling over and opening his eyes, and Tony mutters a curse in Italian, going still, caught halfway to the door.
But even if I did, I still wouldn’t tell you.”
looking at his literally perfect abs, nope. He’s not. He’s
“Business calls.” The other man says, and there’s a faintly amused smile on his face.
“You wanted breakfast. Why don’t we go down to the cafe, get some waffles.”
and nods, gently disentangling himself from Steve’s arms. The loss of warmth is enough to make him huff a bit, but he isn’t worried. Steve isn’t going anywhere.
He hears him before he sees him, the quiet sound of bare feet on tiles before arms wrap around his waist. Steve kisses his neck and Tony closes his eyes, leaning back against him.
“Yes sir?”
But when they’re done, Nat hands him back the money he’d paid her with another wink, pouring them all more coffee.
“Fun wouldn’t be the word I’d use.”
“That’s human, I won’t hold it against you.”
“Yeah, you said. But also, it’s not every day that your best friend gets into bed with a billionaire.”
But a secret identity is a secret for a reason.
“Yes.”
“I paid for-”
Steve gives him a hesitant smile, handing him a cup of coffee. It's not rocket science that Tony likes to drink it, but the fact that Steve noticed and bought him some... some of the weight in his chest eases for a second.
It’s a dream, it’s a nightmare, it’s the only thing he’s been thinking about for the last three days.
For some reason, he can feel guilt settling in his stomach as he types the name into the search bar, even though he’s completely entitled to look him up.
“I hate you,” he says, nothing more than a whisper. It’s a lie, he could never. He thinks he’s crying, he knows he is. But he doesn’t care about anything anymore because Steve fucking messed it up and now Obie will hit back because that’s what he
When Steve’s phone rings at 11pm, he answers it embarrassingly fast.
Eventually, even the thought of Steve’s stupid, startlingly blue eyes can’t push it back, and the numb detachment sweeps in. He wishes he was scared of it, because then maybe he would fight it more.
“Yeah, it’s interesting work.” His tone is so careful, so neutral.
“Yeah,” he says, brain not really processing the words. “Just- I’ll forward you Rhodey’s number. Can you call him?”
Obie’s words filter back to him. His mother had been driving. An accident. But she was careful, too careful, never drank, never went over the speed limit, never slipped.
“We should go in. I made reservations for 8.”
“Sure?”
“Still late.” Fury smirks, and Tony leans back with a sigh, closing his eyes. He hears the door open and close again, but still doesn’t move to look. He resists the urge to put his feet on the table, because pissing Fury off right now is probably a bad idea.
Tony, do you know how fucked up that is? I don’t care that I got hurt. I wasn’t about to let him go
Tony isn’t fucking
He clears his throat, shoving away the urge to kiss him and kiss him and-
“I’ll kill him,” Rhodey says quietly. “I’ll fucking kill him.”
Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing anymore, never wants to do anything else again other than hold Tony, be with Tony,
When Tony gets out of the coffee shop, Happy Hogan doesn’t wait for more than a second before he’s holding out his hand for the cappuccino
The grief surges again.
“You have three minutes and thirty seconds. I’ll be over here with Clint and Sam, pretending not to be listening to whatever Tony has clearly been itching to say since you two arrived.”
Nat glances at the giant countdown.
And somehow, no matter how hard Tony tries to shove down that feeling, it keeps creeping it’s way back in.
It’s his voice that gives him away,
This time, it’s both of them who spin around, coming face to face with their history teacher, who’s supporting his trademark humourless smile. That, plus the eyepatch that is infamous for being a mystery, makes Tony feel a
Tony’s brows furrow a little as he looks up, and Steve wants to kiss him so fucking badly it hurts.
“A compilation of your sins. In simple terms, it’s everything I’ll be showing the judge at your trial.” Steve sees Obadiah's fingers tighten around the folder, and apparently Tony does too, because he laughs quietly. “I’ve already made the necessary copies, so you can keep that if you wish to.”
“Yeah. I don’t want… you’re ridiculously hot. But I don’t want to rush, or do anything you’re not okay with.”
He releases a breath, turning to face Obie.
Fury waves a hand, cutting Natasha off as she opens her mouth.
“I love you.” Steve says softly. “You’re nearly there, and you can do this.”
Tony pulls away, and there’s something so vulnerable in his eyes, something that makes Steve catch his breath. Tony leans forwards, pressing their foreheads together, and then they’re both just breathing, and Steve can feel something inside of him relaxing, every part of him sliding into a sort of peaceful bliss. Happy. Tony’s happy, they’re both
“Fine.”Tony's tone is more even now, and he sounds pissed. Good. “Are we done here? I have work to do.”
Steve opens his eyes.
Tony releases a shaky breath, and there’s not even a point in lying anymore because Ty has told him everything anyway. He keeps his voice flat, emotionless.
But maybe it can be, maybe it will be now.
“A movie would be good.”
“I-“ Tony can think of about six other things he wants to say, and none of them are flattering. His sometimes thinks his vocabulary is a little
Tony glances between them, hesitation and dread curling in his stomach. If he says yes, that’s it. He’ll be going on a mission into the middle of a group of people that are known for being able to kill a man in over 30 ways.
“You want to keep your boy safe?” Obie says, smiling slowly. It’s not a question, not really. He knows he’s won. “Then go back in there and get rid of Colonel Rhodes. Then do as you’re fucking told, and entertain your guest.”
It's silent for a few seconds, and then Steve speaks again.
He breaks away from Steve, a smile spreading across his face. It’s a genuine one, not the camera one. Tony at least, knows the difference.
Obadiah leaves, and breathing becomes a little bit easier. He can feel the panic tugging at his chest, and his nails bite into his palms. He can’t break though, not here, not now, because he can see two cameras without even turning around, and Tony knows that seeing him lose it would be like Christmas come early for Obie
It doesn’t matter. What
Steve laughs, feeling a flood of warmth run through him, something light in his chest.
Tony shakes his head, pushing away the faint memory of Ty's hands, and focusing on Steve’s face.
Tony turns around and leaves before he can change his mind.
are the first words in his head. But that’s not what he wants to say.
Steve. No of this is
“You want to fucking know?”
“Are you okay love?”
They reach his apartment, and Steve turns, bending slightly to kiss him. The billionaire relaxes into it, smiling against his lips. When Steve pulls away, the words are out of his mouth before he can take them back, and he doesn’t think he wants to anyway.
The rest of the evening goes quickly, and when they leave, Howard pays in cash, and its showy and loud and the exact opposite of what Tony does when he goes out. He paid by card when he took Steve out for dinner. With his father and Obadiah, it’s always cash. Always a show.
Tony laughs quietly, loosening his hold on Steve’s hand. But he only grips tighter, his smile open and honest.
“Yeah.” Steve looks… he looks pissed
Rhodey gives him a strange look, and Tony raises his eyebrows.
“No. I know. I was just-” there’s more talking, and Tony closes his eyes. Steve wants to reach out, wants to take his hand. He doesn’t move. Seconds later the other person hangs up, and Tony shoves the phone back into his pocket with a lot more force than necessary.
He wants to ask, wants to know what made him look like that, what it was that made him think that all Steve wants is sex…
Peter rolling his eyes, even if the kid is way too star struck to actually do it in Tony’s view. But then he deflates as Tony sits up, glancing over his work.
Minutes later, Tony has put Steve's number into his phone, and he’s feeling lighter than he has since moving out when he was 15.
Tony leans into his touch, and Steve feels him relax, the emptiness in his eyes fading into something more like the person he knows.
“Some warning would be nice, some sort of warning. I just-”
“No. Never. I just want to have a conversation with you where I can properly see you.”
“You okay?”
out of this.”
Tony runs a hand through his hair, and there’s something close to anguish in his eyes.
“Yeah, I looked at it but I haven’t fixed it yet. Should only take five minutes.”
He feels a sudden sharp urge to get defensive, accompanied with a flash of panic that he suspects won’t ever get old. It’s not like she had shouted his name in times square but… he’s nervous, too nervous about it. It’s a weakness, to have a secret like this, he’s well aware of that.
Tony lets out a hiss, flinching slightly at the contact and Steve lets his hand drop.
They are made of memories,
the whole time what had happened. He’d seen Tony’s grief, the grief that had nearly torn him apart. And he’d lied, he’d kept it from him.
“He fucking- how is this my fault?”
“You’re good at so many things, you know.” Steve finally says when he trusts his voice, clearing his throat a little, glancing at the floor again to check he’s not about to break Tony’s toes. But the dancing is coming back to him now, from what little he’d done before and during the war. No professional… but enough.
“Yeah Happy, I need you to run him through the system.” Silence for a second, and Steve strains his ears to listen. “Yeah, it’s fine.” There’s another pause, and Steve is barely breathing as Tony continues. “This was my fault Happy. Don’t try to drag other people into it, okay?”
They sit in silence for a while, and Tony marvels at the way the light catches the water. It really is beautiful, beautiful in an untouchable way.
“Sure,” Steve says softly, that smile still on his face, and Tony wants to cry. He needs to explain, needs to get him alone, away from Obie watching, and just explain. He can hear his heart in his ears; it’s beating fast.
“You have to be able to compromise Stark.” Fury grits out, and Tony feels a flicker of annoyance.
“Me, if you want to be dramatic about it. Or dum-e, if you want to blame a robot for the entire thing.”
Steve smiles slightly, but it’s not mocking.
In the end, Steve spends half the evening writing and deleting messages, because nothing feels quite right. He doesn’t call; he doesn’t know what to say. What is there to say anyway?
Obie smiles. He’s always had a predators smile. “Your coffee boy. Steve Rogers, right? Goes to the NYU institute of art?”
Tony unfreezes, knocking Obadiah’s hand away and stepping in front of Steve in the space of a second, effectively cutting him off. Tony glances once behind him at Steve and then turns back to Obie, but the split second is enough. He sees the anger that had previously been on Tony’s face again, but this time it’s ten times stronger, fire flickering to life in his eyes. Steve has a flash of clarity, and realises
“Listen,” he says, dropping the volume of his voice, speaking quickly. “I need to-”
Tony isn’t sure he’s breathing, isn’t sure
“Okay,” Maria says softly, and for the first time, he doesn’t think she believes him.
“Got rid of your bodyguard darling?”
Maybe you’re not such a saint after all.”
“Natasha actually. Her exact words were
“Tony?”
“Here. I believe this just about covers it.”
“Bet she loved that.”
Okay, so maybe he’s a little more interested than he had originally thought.
He’s one minute late, but he’s not going to start something now, not while Howard is just looking for things to make a point out of.
who wants to be comforted by his mother. He doesn't have that though, hasn't for years.
“Your little college boy?” Howard’s lip curls. “The one who serves coffee?”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be with you in a minute.”
Steve sees him, he can see him and he’s not turning and running. And even though he doesn’t know everything, he's not pushing and he’s not forcing him into anything he’s not comfortable with and
“Hi,” he says quietly, because he doesn’t trust his voice to do anything else. “Can I have two double shot lattes and a cappuccino?”
flashing in Obadiah’s eyes. But then he jerks his head towards the two chairs in front of his desk.
But they’re in public, however alone they may be right now. All it takes is one picture, one sighting, and then it’s an article, a video, then Obie will call, then his mother will call, and then and then and then.
Floor two, room 191
It’s not that he’s
“Not exactly.”
It’s 2 now; he’s not sure how the time has gone so fast. He forgot to eat lunch, but that doesn’t matter now.
She blinks, before looking back at him, seemingly remembering something. “Oh! Sorry, yes. We have an emergency.”
Steve doesn’t reply, eyes wide as he takes in everything around him. There’s a countdown on one of the huge screens, ticking down from the five minute mark. He can’t see the route they came from, it’s long since been swallowed up by the crowd. For once, it doesn’t bother Steve. They’ve made it just in time.
Steve kisses him, which has always proven effective. This time is no different. When he pulls away, it’s Tony’s eyes that are wide.
Nothing more, not a CEO, not even a businessman.
glad that he has enough self-control to stop his mouth dropping open.
that way. “But no. They don’t know. No one does, apart from you and Rhodey.” Pepper probably does, she’s too smart not to, and Happy isn’t stupid either.
If possible, Tony’s smile becomes even more guilty.
A humourless smile twists Natasha’s lips. “Maybe he needs to pick your alter ego’s brain for something.”
He’s never meant anything more in his life.
Tony, who wants to dance with him at one in the morning.
Steve looks away, pulling a face at Natasha. She smiles slightly. Then his brain processes the image.
Steve knows what that means, knows that Tony is definitely smart enough to figure it out with or without his help. But he can’t bring himself to say it.
“You should really go home kid. You can come and finish this tomorrow morning”
Then he follows, makes another pot of coffee, and locks himself in his workshop for the rest of the day.
It’s a different sort of fear though.
When he gets back, Tony is still asleep. He sinks back into his position on the floor, and stays put.
“The date JARVIS.”
“You’re eighteen years old, get a grip. You should know how to take a punch by now.”
Tony steps out of the tower, and dimly realises his hands are shaking as he fishes his personal phone out of his pocket.
“Maybe just be a little more careful with your lab work genius?”
“So maybe… you could make your little coffee breaks a regular thing?”
would go that far.
The press would die to get their hands on something like this. Though that can be applied to most stories when it comes to him. Ty had once called him the
He can’t really see properly, can’t work out what’s going on, where he is. It hurts but it doesn’t hurt at all anymore, and his brain is saying
When Steve’s voice comes back to him, it’s low, and there's an anger in it that he knows isn't directed at him.
He doesn’t speak, can't speak right now. He drinks the water slowly, stomach calming down, and tries not to think about the last time he had accepted a drink from someone else.
Everyone laughs, smiles a little, tells him with no real feeling that he should
When he knocks on the door, his only thought is
“No, just curious. For someone so famous, I know virtually nothing about him.”
Too many years knowing Natasha has trained him out of the jerk reaction, but old habits die hard. He doesn’t even think the Captain realises what this is doing to his heart rate. To him, it’s just a casual question, a curiosity.
“Sex with Tony Stark.”
He doesn’t look like he’s laughing anymore, and Steve wonders
He can’t speak, can't
If he ever comes back to the cafe that is, now that Steve has made such a monumental fool of himself.
“Hey Steve?” Tony says quietly, and Steve wonders if it’s normal to feel such a sense of total peace at the sound of a single voice.
“I’m not a what?”
Of course he followed him outside.
“Is there a reason you’re back from lunch early?” Peter asks carefully, and Tony raises his eyebrows, amusement dancing in his gaze
His friend sighs heavily, tapping the bar, and the bartender refills both of their drinks. Just as Tony is about to take a sip, a new voice sounds behind them.
Even he can understand that much, but for the second time, he see's Tony's face light up as the billionaire laughs with a nod
and he’s just-
Apparently a lack of quick answers had confirmed their suspicions. Of course.
“Okay, you’re okay now.”
“I break everything I touch.” Tony whispers, and there’s something shattered in his voice. “I fuck it all up and put everyone in danger and I can’t-”
weapons to terrorists. And without the joy of knowing who… there had been no way he could’ve risked continuing to make them. So he’d left, walked away, not looked back. But somehow…
He hears his friend sigh, but there’s no real anger behind it.
“It’s nearly all gone from my body. So yeah, I would say it’s fine.”
The rain is coming down hard now, but he can still fucking see Steve’s face and Steve’s eyes. They’re breaking him, because they’re in so much pain but they’re still so fucking innocent and god this is Tony’s fault, he should never have involved him in any of it. Selfish, selfish, selfish.
Any lingering hesitation hardens to an unbreakable will.
your brain freaking out.”
“You worry too much.”
“Any of what,” he says quietly. He remembers the look on Steve’s face last night, the smiles, the gentle hands, gentle lips, and everything else.
“Oh.”
you're staying here.” He doesn’t give Peter a chance to respond, instead glancing over his shoulder again.
“I’m sorry, I was busy. I didn’t see the calls.”
Saying no is suspicious, but going normally is also suspicious.
Tony runs a hand through his hair, glancing around the room. Ty is talking to his father now, and Obadiah is watching Tony with an expression that can only be described as one of triumph.
“It’s worth it. I want to ruin his life, and I want to do it perfectly.”
“Baby,” he says quietly, “are you sure you want to?” His voice is barely more than a whisper, and Steve laughs softly.
fucking sorry, Jesus
“You’re sure you have to go?”
His head jolts up, forgetting the rule of avoiding Steve’s eyes for more than one reason. They’re so blue. How the hell are they so blue?
“I have to get into work early.”
Tony nearly flinches.
Nat smirks at him, eyes glittering with humour.
He isn’t sure how much time passes, but eventually, he hears footsteps approaching, and then Tony is next to him, dropping to his knees on the sidewalk.
“You can’t send me to prison without a trial!”
“What are you not saying?”
“No.” Steve  says instead, an embarrassed smile ghosting his lips. “I mean, I used to be able to. I can a bit, probably. But then I sort of started fighting Nazis, and dancing was uh… less of a priority.”
When Steve looks at his boyfriend, his face is calm.
is breathing.
Vulnerable.
Tony shrugs, pushing the laptop back towards him.
“Dinner. Friday night. They’ve booked somewhere in town. Your mother wanted you all to go to Malibu for the weekend, but Howard said no. They asked me to let you know they expect you to have lunch with them on Saturday as well. I’ll send your assistant all the information.”
anything
“Oh.”
“You didn’t- your parents don’t know?”
“No, but we need you back. There’s a student who has accidentally set something on fire in your lab.” She says, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. It’s the
“No, I’m not sure you quite
Obadiah waves a hand. “Go, don't worry about it. I’ll see you soon I suspect.” There’s a look of faint amusement on his face, like he knows something Tony doesn’t. He ignores the faint flash of nausea that accompanies this thought, standing up and grabbing his jacket.
Tony tilts his head to one side as he looks at him, a half smile on his face.
There’s a tiny bit of hurt in his voice, or maybe Tony is imagining it, amplifying his own guilt because he’s always been self-destructive like that.
The last time he had woken up like this, Tony had slipped out of bed and tried to sneak out, tried everything he could to hide from the feelings he knew were building inside of him. This time…
He’s trying to control his voice, he really is, but someone has
_________
Tony raises his eyebrows, and when he speaks, his voice is flat and emotionless, the change in him instant. “You’re that eager to get Tony Stark into bed?”
As he reaches the end of the road, he realises there’s someone behind him. And it’s fine, it doesn’t matter, but all he can hear is Tony’s voice.
“So,”  Obie says when Tony’s halfway done with his drink. He’s resisting the urge to tap his fingers on the table, refusing to give into the nervous habit. “How have you been Tony?”
“You’re drinking
Steve brushes a thumb over the back of his hand, keeping his voice low, soothing.
Tony finds himself smiling back a little bit.
“Reason?” He doesn’t sound suspicious, just bored.
is making him feel a little lightheaded, because he loves him, but this is Tony Stark, and Steve knows that he flirts with pretty much everything that breathes. It’s not personal. It’s
Whatever the reason, she glances at the number on it, and then hits the elevator button.
He thinks as he watches light reflect off the lake, warmth expanding through his chest.
“Darling. I literally live off coffee. There won’t be any complaints about that.”
“Cap.” Tony says, raising his eyebrows. “Sit down. I’ll be done in a minute.”
He starts drinking again. A lot. Too much. He doesn't tell Pepper, doesn't tell anyone else. It doesn't matter.
It had taken Tony an hour to warm up after the shocking cold of the rain had finally hit him. The shower had most definitely helped, especially when Steve had knocked on the door gently to see if he was okay, and Tony hadn’t even hesitated before taking his hand and tugging him into the bathroom.
He hesitates for half a second, and then picks up the phone.
Nick Fury pauses at the door, turning back to face them, addressing his question to Tony.
, he thinks,
Fury rolls his eyes. “I’m sure I have. Let me know if you’re ever looking to go into my line of work Stark, we could do with someone like you on the team.”
“I know, I’m sorry. I’ll stay an hour later this afternoon.”
“You’re so stubborn,” Steve mutters, but then he kisses him again, and again, and again.
The sun rises.
“I think,” He says quietly, and Steve is immediately looking at him, searching his eyes. “I think it… an accident. I don’t think it was an accident.”
“I’ve been instructed by Colonel Rhodes to bring him a change of clothes for tomorrow.”
Then Tony smiles at him, and he swears it's like the rest of the world falls away.
“Tony.” He reaches across the table, curling his hands around both of Tony’s, and gently taking the fork, laying it back down on the table. “Yes. We should go out again, I would
.” Is the only thing out of his mouth before his stomach is turning and he’s lurching out of the bed, moving almost blindly towards the bathroom. He hears someone swear, hears footsteps follow him, but his head is-
wants to take a picture of Obadiah’s face and frame it.
“I didn’t do anything he wasn’t already
“I know baby,” Steve murmurs, pulling him closer and just holding Tony as he breaks, shatters over and over into a thousand pieces. Steve is holding him together, is the
Tony-"
He looks at Happy and Obie, flashing a smile.
Silence. And then Obie smiles, clapping him on the shoulder.
“Are you calling me irresponsible sweetheart?”
“I know, I know. Just hold on for a bit, okay?”
“Even more reason why I have to buy you waffles. I don’t make the rules, sorry.”
His parents. Dinner. His
“Tones. I know what your IQ is, so don't play dumb.”
Obie raises his eyebrows, a smile spreading across his face.
“I know. I know I hurt him. I know.”
him for it.
Instantly, Steve is blushing, because he
Steve closes his eyes, sliding the laptop off his lap, and bringing his hands up to run them through Tony’s mess of curls as he tugs him closer.
Tony nods, feeling a shiver of unease race down his spine. Everyone he interacts with knows him as Mr Carbonell. His mother’s maiden name had been an obvious choice for his entire life, especially once he’d decided to open Stark Industries. People knowing he’s Tony Stark can’t bring anything good. So Carbonell it is, and the myth and mystery surrounding Tony Stark and who he really is only grows.
“Am I interrupting something?”
Tony runs a hand through his hair, flopping down on the sofa next to him. They’re back in Tony’s apartment, and the place is warm.
“Please.”
He swallows hard, pulling the sheets over Tony, before grabbing an extra throw and adding that too. Then he goes into the bathroom, running one of Tony’s towels under the warm water and taking it back to him
Finally, Tony turns to look at him, and Steve can see the walls crumbling, despite the facade of amusement. Tony blinks hard, the shadow of grief still on his face, and Steve wraps an arm around his shoulders, tucking him into his side.
No, he really,
His AI’s voice is… soft. It’s more careful, almost concerned.
He won’t see anyone today; he knows that Howard is in meetings. His mother is at the house in Malibu. Obadiah... he doesn’t know. But he’ll only come and see him if he wants something.
“You- of course you did.” Steve laughs a little as Tony tugs him around the crowd until they reach a clearer area, closer to the front.
“You know I don’t care about that anymore. I’m just worried about
don’t. Don’t. I can’t. I
Steve tilts his head to one side. “Twenty three, and you’re one of the most successful businessmen on earth?”
“Just relax sweetheart.” Tony says, lips far too close to his. A shiver runs down his spine and it’s not from the cold. “Follow me, the rest will come. Muscle memory is a lifesaver.”
“Morning.” He says with a laugh, kissing him again.
was clingy, but it’s literally only been ten minutes. Tell me you’ve found the store.”
Tony has always wondered how his questions somehow manage to sound like orders every time.
He leaves soon after that, because something is aching in his chest, and he’s blinking harder than before. He misses her. He misses her. He misses her.
Steve frowns, and Tony’s heart is
“But it made me feel a lot better, so there’s that.”
The guy looks at him, dark eyes unfaltering. He smiles, and it's a practiced thing, all sharp edges and bedroom softness.
“Hey.”
“Your roommate won’t be annoyed?”
So he doesn’t answer, glancing around the room. Just as he’s about to ask, his mother sweeps into the room and Howard gives her a smile, and all Tony can think is how light he face looks when he smiles, and that he can’t remember the last time his father smiled at him.
Tony grins, and Steve is no longer sure whether he’s intimidated by his boyfriend, or turned on. Or both.
He’s on his second glass of some spirit he doesn’t know the name of, and he’s convinced the bartender is spying on him. Which is also totally fine, except that means Obie is spying on him, and Steve is
Slowly, so slowly, they pull away. Steve is breathless, heart pounding, eyes wide. Tony opens his mouth, moving back a little bit, and his stomach drops because Tony looks scared, worried.
He wonders if he ever would go back to work for Obadiah. He suspects not, even though the temptation is there, small as it is. But however you look at it, the facts remain the same. Someone had gone under the table and dealt to terrorists, had dealt
“This isn’t a suicide mission.” Fury says, steepling his fingers. “Here’s what it is. The Captain infiltrates the Hydra organisation base we’ve found. He's the best, the survival rate goes up. You go along as the brains of the mission. We need to be able to decrypt all the intel the Captain collects on the scene, because we need the information to be correct and straight from the source. If we don’t have to transfer it to be decrypted, survival rates go up. Fewer opportunities for someone to betray us. We don’t know what you’re going into, so I need the best we’ve got for this, which unfortunately means you as well Tony.”
Tony just looks at him, and slowly, the hard, unreachable look in his eyes fades slightly.
“Always good.” Tony says with a quiet laugh, lacing their fingers together and leading him back to the sofa. “Now sit down and relax for a bit, okay?”
It’s not a question, not really.
His friend only laughs, giving him a smirk.
“You,” Tony says, voice deadly soft, “do not get to fucking
“Hey,” Tony says, flashing a smile. “I got bored of the tour.”
Steve pulls away, taking his hand and tugging him into the bedroom, and Tony doesn’t hesitate before following.
So he says no to Steve’s offer of company, even though he really wants to take it, and spends the day by an old lake out of town, blinking away tears.
“If you’re going to ask me about the alcohol, or the slut thing, or the continuous public fuck ups, maybe wait until I’m on my third drink.”
and all Tony wants to do is kiss him until he’s breathless.
“Tony.” Steve says, and the anger is gone, evaporated like it was never there, but he can see the intensity in his gaze. He can’t look away. “What the hell is going on?”
“Oh.” He says, eyes wide.
“What the
He sees Tony square his shoulders.
Thank god. Thank
When Steve opens the door (it opens fast), he smiles, and even though it’s a sad smile, it’s still so goddamn beautiful.
“I’m in love with you,” Tony says, and the anger is still there but it’s muted now. “I’m in
The first thing he does when he leaves the next day is go to Steve’s apartment. Obadiah has left a note on his floor about how he can leave when he wants, and he’s one hundred percent sure it’s some sort of test, it always is, but he doesn’t care right now
The rest of the world falls away.
Suddenly feeling nervous, and far too out of his comfort zone for his liking, Tony clears his throat, stretching a little. “Peter said you needed something earlier?”
“I have an apartment-”
Steve isn’t sure he’s breathing anymore he’s so angry, and angry isn’t really appropriate anymore because Ty would be dead if Tony wasn’t drugged out of his mind in his arms right now.
“Baby, I'm just running to the store.”
A part of him wonders if it would be better to just say fuck it, fuck Obadiah, fuck Howard and fuck the company. But then he remembers staying with his parents in the summer, and any lingering courage wilts and dies.
The quiet doesn’t leave.
When Tony wakes up the next morning, he thinks he might be dreaming. He rolls over gently, trying not to move the bed too much, and picks up his phone to check the time. It’s 5am.
“Okay.” Tony whispers again, and maybe he’s lying, Steve isn’t sure. All he knows is that both of their grips are tight, and there’s no one else in the world right now apart from the two of them.
“Had to, Obie said… had to.”
he says, and that’s ice cold anger. “You don’t get to fucking
He figured out a long time ago that it’s so much easier to love Steve Rogers than to hate him.
He shakes his head, closing his eyes for a second.
As he looks, Tony starts talking, counting things off on his fingers as he does.
Steve feels Tony’s smile against his skin, and looks down to see his lips curving upwards.
Tony mumbles something against his shirt that sounds a lot like
Steve’s shirt is soaked with Tony’s tears, but he doesn’t care, just adjusts their positions so that he’s leaning against the wall, pulling Tony into his lap.
The cold remains.
and I just had to-”
“About what?”
The boy, Ty, pulls away from where he had been whispering something in Tony's ear, presses a kiss to the hollow of his throat and smiles. Steve sees Tony flinch slightly at the contact, and every rational thought leaves his head.
It hurts, and he’s so
He’d known. Steve had fucking

“God Steve, there’s no need to be so
“I’ve got everything I need.”
Howard’s voice drops into something terrifyingly soft, and Tony realises in a shock of clarity, that it was never going to end any other way.
That fucking
Steve just stares at him, taking another step forwards. Tony goes still as he moves, eyes wide as Steve reaches out to touch the bruise, gently running his fingers over the damaged skin.
He glances back over his shoulder, a small smile rising on his face as he sees Steve lying asleep face down next to him, the laptop abandoned on the floor. He rolls back over, just letting himself admire the boy in bed next to him. He’s half in shadows because of the dark lighting in the room, but
“Sweetheart don’t get so wound up, it’s just a bit of fun.”
“I know.” He forces his voice to remain neutral, calm. “I know, sorry. I was talking to the Captain about some of the tech he needs repairing.”
Steve’s hand cups his face, thumb brushing over his cheek. His eyes are bright. Tony thinks it could be tears.
“Steve?” Tony’s previous anger has given way to shock, and Steve fights for breath as they face each other. The hallway is empty, and everything echoes a little in the quiet.
“I need some air.” He says again, ignoring the look on Steve’s face, shoving open the front door and walking out of the apartment.
“I swear Rogers, you’re incapable of doing anything for yourself. Go for dinner.”
“Yeah, honestly it was just tiring. I’m glad to be back.”
Rhodey stays, and Tony is so beyond grateful. Less than twenty four hours later, Pepper is back, and she has donuts, just like that time so long ago.
He rolls his eyes. “Okay sweetheart.” A wink to Steve. “You can tell your
Steve finds himself thinking. The pain tears through him but he lets it happen, lets the tide sweep in and drag him out, lets the agony wash over him in waves. The images are bright in the forefront of his consciousness.
Tony pulls away, looking up at him with raised eyebrows.
“Yep,” she says, popping the P and smirking in a way that makes Steve feel more than a little afraid of her, and very glad she’s his friend. “That sounds about right.”
“You okay? Want some water?”
The sun hits the lake, the world turns golden, and something that Tony has been missing for a while finally slides back into place.
and he doesn’t believe he would-
sorry for the long wait, but i hope you all enjoy 😌
Tony’s hands are on his cheeks, running over his face. It’s so gentle. He leans into the touch, eyes closing.

“Nope.” Tony grins, and it’s something so

“Any other tricks?”

Steve shrugs, dipping his head to kiss him gently.
He would dismiss it, but his teacher seems… worried, concerned almost.
Steve is the furthest thing from weak. He’s steady, a mix of a raging fire of emotions and the never-ending presence of the ocean. It’s almost infinite, how deep Steve’s loyalty goes, how good his heart is
He doesn’t bother locking the door when he goes into his room. It’s not like Obie and Howard don’t have keys to it anyway. His brain works on autopilot as he changes, getting ready for bed.
hand with a nod, refusing to look at Fury. “Tony Stark.”
“Steve.”
All things considered, the situation is now a lot less fine than it had been five minutes ago.
He doesn’t call first, because his goddamn phone is still in his jacket in his apartment.
Tony gives him an innocent smile, running a hand up Steve’s arm, dragging a finger over his chest.
Steve raises his eyebrows. “Seriously?”
Steve nods, reaching up and brushing some hair out of his face, and Tony wants to cry again because everything about Steve is so gentle and soft but so strong, and he

“He needs his
Tony shakes his head, leaning forwards until his forehead rests against Steve’s shoulder, closing his eyes and just breathing. He can feel Steve’s fingers running through his hair, and every touch sends another flash of warmth through him.
He doesn’t want to let it go, doesn’t want to let Tony sit and deal with whatever the hell that was alone. But they’ve known each other for less than a week, and it’s none of his business.
His mother wants to stay in the hotel for dinner, but Howard, as always, gets the last say. A fancy restaurant in town. Someone comes to his room and tells him that they’re leaving in an hour, and that he’s expected downstairs in fifty minutes.
The Captain raises his eyebrows. “Tony?”
“Yeah.” He says, deciding not to push it, not now. “Sure, you know I always do.”
He doesn’t call him.
“Yep.”
Steve laughs quietly. “I won’t.”
His mind is blank.
Gentle, his touch has always been so gentle.
He goes to sleep, and tries to put Tony’s dark eyes out of his mind.
“Drop it Maria,” says Howard, and there’s enough bite in his tone that Tony’s stomach lurches. His father is drunk, or has at least drunk enough to crack the composure a bit. He shifts closer to his mother, and instantly knows it's the wrong decision, because Howard’s eyes darken slightly.
Rhodey looks like he’s about to step in and argue, but Tony gives him a tiny shake of his head. Because he can’t do anything here, and Obie could destroy Rhodey’s entire career in a second, and it would be done without an ounce of hesitation.
exactly I’m here.”
That, and the whole working for a secret government agency deal, which he doesn’t intend to mention any time soon.
Tony learnt to control his expressions so well. He’s not sure he wants to know.
“Well Cap, it’s a good job you have a teacher.”
“Now Tony, is that any way to talk to someone who only came to give you news?”
Steve assures him that the place where the art is being shown will be nearly empty by the time they get there. Tony doesn’t worry about it, because he trusts him.
It seems like a thousand years pass before Tony shakes his head again slowly, but Steve sees his shoulders relax, eyes losing some of their defensiveness.
Tony cuts off as half of a sandwich hits Rhodey in the back of his head. They both turn around slowly, and Justin Hammer smiles.
Something tells him that she’s not just talking about the journey back to SHIELD headquarters, and he doesn’t know what to make of it. Natasha has always been cryptic, but this? This is extreme, even for her.
“Is everything okay? Aren’t you meant to be at a party with him right now?” He doesn’t try to hide the worry in his voice.
“Shit, aren’t they supposedly death-” Tony shoots him a look and the teenager backpedals with a wince. “I mean, wow! That will be... fun?”
“Yeah. I’ll text her on the way.”
Fury opens his mouth again, and then Natasha shoves opens the door, face set in stone. It brightens as soon as she sees Tony.
he’s ridiculously attractive.
Now he’s scrambling again.
Steve has gone utterly still, whole body frozen.
Tony swallows hard, hands trembling, and he’s never hated anyone this much, not even his father. Obadiah wants him to beg, because it’s all a fucking power play with him, it’s all about breaking him. Just like every idle touch, every tiny physical contact that he knows Tony hates because he fucking
Steve’s arms tighten around him, and he can hear his heart, the steady beat is loud in his ears.
if time doesn’t stop for a while.
They have time.
“I just thought it would be nice,” he finishes, flashing his trademark smile. “I like to take cute baristas out for dinner.” Let Steve infer what he will from that. If the look on his face is anything to go by, the words had their intended effect.
“I’ll drive. Explain on the way.”
who is on the other end of that phone.
“Howard?”
Steve’s voice is so loud, and Tony’s heart is beating so fast.
Tony makes him brave.
Tony has just opened his mouth to say, undoubtedly, something stupid, when Peter cuts in, standing up with a smile.
And now she’s gone.
what is about to happen. They both sit down, and Steve resists the urge to fidget.
Tony smiles, something he’s been doing more and more recently, and squeezes Steve’s hand in thanks. Then he moves, dragging Steve towards the door, barely giving him time to pick up his jacket.
He’s not laughing anymore.
“I suggest you say what you came here to say and then
“With the Captain?”
“Already there. I got them badges last week.”
It is without a doubt, the most bullshit thing that’s ever been said, and yet somehow it works.
“Point made. Listen baby, I have to go, but I’ll see you tomorrow maybe?”
“Hey,” Steve says quietly, “What’s up?”
“It’s fine man. Just take some aspirin before the customers start coming in. You look like death.”
Hope you liked this! If anyone wants to come and yell at me, my instagram and tumblr are @wordsxstars. Thank you for the support on this!
It’s dark out, which he suspects is deliberate on Tony’s part. He doesn’t fully understand his worry about being seen together, but the least he can do is respect it for the moment, at least until he knows some more.
“Fuck off.”
“Perfect,” says Obadiah smoothly, pressing a hand against the small of his back to move him forwards. Tony does finch this time, and it’s barely noticeable, but he knows Obie feels it, knows he’s losing this battle of wills.
“You want to live with me.”
The clock ticks down to zero, but there’s nothing. It’s just silent.
He opens his eyes, and when he takes his next breath, he strengthens the walls holding the pain back. Breathe. Strengthen. Breathe. Steve is staring at him like he’s seen a ghost.
The dread sits inside of Tony like a physical weight.
“You’re Tony Stark.”
“I don’t need you to do that.” Steve says quietly, anger deflating. “You know I don’t want you to do that.”
He reads about Tony Stark, the son of the billionaire, the boy who’s been heir to Stark Industries for his whole life. There are countless of stories about him, and Steve is certain that at least half of them are bullshit. There are pictures of him with girls draped over him at fifteen, pictures of drinks in his hands, pictures of him with wide, unfocused eyes.
The restaurant is close enough to Steve’s apartment that they can walk, and they make their way back slowly, seeing as Tony has insisted on getting him home safe. There’s a part of him that warms at the words, despite the amusement that accompanies the feeling. Tony is shorter than him, and built more like a dancer than a fighter. His fingers are covered in calluses though, that much he can feel from the tight grip on his hand.
Tony shakes his head, drumming his fingers on his thigh. “Nope. Obie launched a full scale investigation into it, they found nothing. Whoever it was is either hiding it incredibly well, or long gone.”
“Hi Tones. I’m here, I’m right here.”
“Somehow I doubt that. You’re studying at NYU right?”
The next hit drives straight into his stomach, and it knocks the wind out of him.
It's the shock in his voice that makes Tony feel defensive, feel the need to explain himself, even though there's really nothing to explain.
“He’s selling under the table.” Steve says softly, and there’s a sort of horrified resignation in Tony’s eyes.
a little nervous. “I was never talking about him.”
“Is it finished?”
“You still with me?”
He hasn’t changed a bit. The last time Tony saw him was three years ago, and he had sworn he would never go
“Your parents?”
His blue eyes are wide, and god knows Tony should let it go now, should back away and leave before he ruins this boy. The world has been far too kind to Steve Rogers, and Tony doesn’t want to be the thing that teaches him hate and manipulation and shows him just how fucked up the world is, shows Steve just how fucked up
Obadiah smiles at him as he takes a seat in the chair opposite, and Tony forces one back.

“I know.” He says, trying to keep his voice steady. “I know. But leaving won’t help.”
“This isn’t over.”
Steve pulls a face. “I’ve had it for a while, but it works.”

“Well, you are my
“You don’t need anything from here, do you?”
“I’ve never done this before,” he murmurs against Tony’s neck, and he nods, pressing his lips against Steve’s gently.
“See you.”
He only leans in though, kissing him.
And then she’s gone, vanishing into the crowded streets of the city.
Tony swallows hard. "Then nothing.”
where this anger is coming from.
His friend just gives him a look, taking the glass out of his hand, but doesn’t argue.
, and Tony has to look away, something in him unwilling to meet his gaze. Everything seems to have suddenly fallen away, and the teasing humour has vanished. It’s not a bad feeling, but it’s a quiet one. Like something is holding its breath.
“Didn’t expect to see you here. Aren’t you usually late to these things?”
When he gets to the stories about what exactly goes on at these parties, and who exactly Tony Stark takes to bed, he stops reading.
When they’re done with the wine, Tony stands and kisses him, and it’s slow and sweet. Steve tastes like mint. It’s warm in the apartment, and the lights are soft. It’s quiet, but not silent. It’s never silent in this city.
For a second, there’s no sound in the apartment.
“I’m sure he can tell you himself, once it’s all out of his system of course.”
He nods. “Yeah, at The Institute Of Art. I want to do something with art in life. Maybe teach kids, I’m not really sure.”
“It’s ridiculously nice, and I’m underdressed.”
It’s not a peaceful sleep.
“Okay go. Text me when you’re home and I'll let you know what the plan is over the next few weeks
Neither of them answer, and Ty walks away.
“Tony.”
He feels Steve trace a pattern over his arm. “That’s- that’s so good love.”
He doesn’t move, and he knows his expression is blank. Knows it because there’s a look on Steve’s face that he never wants to see again.
“Tony.” Steve says softly, kissing him again. Hearing his name on his lips makes his whole body relax, as if he's been waiting to hear it his whole life. Maybe he has.  “I love you.”
Tony smiles a little, and it’s more relaxed now as he feels some of the tension in his chest easing.
was in his drink.
“I’m sorry to come and make it crazier then.”
In the split second before everyone descends into chaos, there’s a moment of dead silence. Tony’s heart is pounding, adrenaline crashing through him, and his mouth tastes strangely like salt. Milliseconds later, the sound starts.
“Rhodey.” Tony says, shooting his friend a look, voice not leaving any room for argument. “I’ll see you in a minute.”
He can feel the panic looming, just beyond the wall of stone he’s had up all day. Tony isn’t sure why now is the time the panic attack he’s been putting off for hours has decided to crash back into him, but he just-
The door slams on his way out, and then Tony is alone.
Nat finds the spare key that he knows Tony keeps hidden by the side of the door and unlocks it. Steve leads him towards it, and Nat touches his shoulder gently.
Tony blinks, snapping himself out of his own thoughts
Steve is here but he’s rubbing his back gently, whispering reassurances. A minute later, when the nausea lessens slightly, he hears running water and a glass of it is pressed into his hand.
“Oh, yeah. Fury asked me if you could have a look at some of my gear for a mission I’ve got to leave for tomorrow. Trackers and that kind of thing.”
It’s when they get to Steve’s works, right at the end, that his words catch in his throat.
His head is spinning now, all he wants to do is sleep. Everything feels darker.
.” He runs a hand through his hair, trying to calm his heartbeat back to normal.
“Tony?”
Nat shrugs. “He’s allegedly a genius, though I don’t know if that’s just rumours or not. I wouldn’t be surprised if his father had bribed him through college.”
“What the fuck do you want me to say?” He yells. “That yeah I wish my father didn’t go for me every time he has a fucking drink? Do you want me to say I hate that I don’t have the ability to forget that Ty got me drunk and dragged me into his room when I was fifteen? That I still have nightmares about him-”
Everything is aching with something he can’t identify. He doesn’t think he can move, let alone talk to his friend.
“I'm not saying anything on record without my lawyers.” Obadiah spits, slamming the folder onto the desk. “You can't officially charge me with anything.”
But then he looks again, looks again because it’s
“Please continue.”
“Going to what?” Steve says, playing for time even though he knows
“Peter.”
“Hey, she’s just curious. Don’t be pissed with her if you need to be mad.”
“Hey, hey baby. You with me?”
“Sure. You need something?”
The God of Thunder slowly stretched his arms before he dug one hand into the small hole box. He tried to grab something that’s is so fuzzy, a cylindrical body like beetle that so slippery filled with disgusting dirt.
Clint suddenly had a propose . “ How about we have a shawarma in the Shawarma Palace near the street because boy I am starving.” He continued to touch around the stomach.
“ Is this a porcupine spike ball ?” Rhodey answered, but some of the Avengers nodded their heads. Which mean wrong.
“ Hey, did anyone keep some lube in this place ?” Erik asked around the room.
“ By Odin’s beard, this look like a small living creature.” Thor gasped and releasing his hand out of the box.
Steve could feel it; twitching against his godly thunder body, shuddering and tensing up as he came. He curled his legs around those bucking hips, gripped Thor 's arms hard, moaned and wriggled and felt every second of it. It's so fucking good!
“ You gotta do what they said. “ Clint supported his decision and insist to drink it.
“ Aww, come on. Don’t you all give me that scary, frightening looks.” Clint felt teased by his teammates.
“ Yeah , I know right.” Clint‘s mind isn’t concentrate due to the alcohol effect.
“ Oh boys, I never thought I could do it.” Hank’s mind slowly lose its balance and started to act like a walking dead. His reaction was priceless since he couldn’t make straight face while under effect.
Hawkeye was standing in front of the next box as he removed the curtain cloth which revealed another object. This time, he seemed gulp in nervous as he slowly calm himself down since it’s just a game. The Avengers were astonished to see how the marksman archery was going to play out in this challenge. He tried to put his hand inside the small hole of the box. He did not wear his glove while doing it.
They finally cheered with a loud applause, Janet jumped out from the couch feeling excited and happy. Even Steve and Clint were giving a triple hug together with Tony. Iron Man looked around in the box to see a fake lobster inside the box laying down. They all felt enjoyable to play the game with the team. Even the game was quite challenging to guess what stuff they’re touching. They knew it’s just a game and it looked nothing like how they battle or encounters any dangerous threats or villains during the missions.
“I think I can handle you both .” Clint said with a smirk as both Thor and Simon headed to one of the large plush couches and sat between the two of them. Clint laying down and leaned over to kiss Thor deeply letting their tongues play, then he did the same with Simon.
“ Okay guys. Please don’t anything that make me peer my pant and I swear you all gonna bust some big laugh at me.” Rhodey felt pressure at the reaction of his teammate.
“ To victory.” The guys all repeat before clinking the glasses together and swallowing the strong alcohol down.
“ Arggh, shit. I can’t believe it.” Clint palmed his face with disappointed.
Meanwhile at the other side, Clint was letting Erik’s cock slid right in. He was fucking him faster, easier. The sounds of Erik rammed in his own ejaculate made Clint dizzy. The idea of being filthy and filled-up wildly turned him on. His cock was already hard again, balls aching from his previous orgasms. Still, the intensity of his curse only made that ache more desirable. He wanted to fuck and come until he couldn’t feel or think anymore. Tony rocking his hips, gyrating inside of him. Clint looked down between their bodies. His filthy cock, smeared with come, was trapped between their sticky bodies.
[7] Now isn’t the best time
And then he’s gone.
“Okay.” Tony sounds scared, and Steve’s throat tightens. “That was a stupid question. Just stay with me, okay?”
Steve laughs against his lips as they trip, tumbling onto the bed. He can feel Steve’s hands on his skin, and there’s nothing too loud or too quiet in his head.
When Tony gets down to the lab, it’s starting to get dark and Peter is still there, bent over the thin wires spread across the table.
Of course he had. Of course Ty hadn’t been able to just ruin him without digging the blade into Steve as well. Steve, who Obie had threatened. Steve, who Tony would go right back to Ty to protect without hesitation.
“Why?” He asks later, because Pepper is his best friend aside from Rhodey, but she also thinks coffee is the equivalent of drinking weed killer.
“Leave it,” Steve murmurs against his skin, kissing down his neck. Tony’s breath hitches, but he shakes his head, pulling away gently.
When Steve unlocks the door and leads Tony towards his room, he has a moment of doubt. His room is… a mess. The place is a mess, if he’s honest. Clint isn’t the tidiest roommate, and he never makes an effort to clean up properly.
He doesn’t give a
“I love you.” He repeats with a small smile. “So you can stop worrying about that.”
He can’t explain it, how can he? How can he explain that Obie finding out isn’t only bad, but dangerous, for Tony
“I made coffee if you want it,” Steve says, trying for a smile as Tony opens his eyes, taking a deep breath.
He splashes his face with cold water, closing his eyes for a second. He feels more jumpy than he had earlier, and some of the numbness has faded. He just-
of hating you Steve.”
Tony smiles at him, brushing a thumb over his cheek. “You're so welcome.”
Once Tony is gone, it takes Natasha all of three seconds to be back in the room.
He’s just picked up his phone to call Happy when he hears a key turn in the lock. For a second, hope jumps in his chest at the thought that it could be Steve, Steve could have come round and-
“Nope.”
If he tells it first, he doesn’t have to hear it. He can take it, god knows he takes it enough from Obie, from Howard, and from the rest of the world.
“What did you do?”
“Clingy much?”
Tony resists the urge to swallow and instead nods, refusing to pull away. “Yes.”
He watches as he swallows hard, clearly dragging himself out of his own thoughts. When Tony smiles at him, there’s an ache in Steve's chest, because it’s the practiced one, and it’s no longer fully real.
Everything’s spinning. It won’t stop spinning.
This is what he wants, and just for today, nothing else in the world matters.
“Got any more interesting?” He mutters as he slips silently back into the group. Rhodey shakes his head. As he shifts, Tony catches a flash of the earphones in his friend’s ears, and smiles.
