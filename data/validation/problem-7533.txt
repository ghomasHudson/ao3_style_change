“How far d’ya think word has spread?”
After he’d successfully cleared that plate and loaded up on seconds, he spoke again.
Tony's very confused. The Stark-Rogers go on a day outing! Steve and Tony have a little chat.
They knew Bakuto was smart but he had picked up on the missing information faster than they had hoped and in retaliation, he had sent them photos of both Clint and Tony, bruised and bloody, looking incredibly tired and malnourished.
A moment later, she heard footsteps and then the black-haired, green-eyed man came bounding down the steps, not eager to be accused of making Sarah Rogers wait. He smiled at her, extending his arm for her to take and she did, first kissing each of his cheeks and then he led her up the stairs to the office, asking her how she was.
Clint’s nightmares woke him. It was dark in the room but he focused his efforts on not freaking himself out. Instinctively he reached for his hearing aids in the place where he was used to them being beside the bed, his pulse speeding up when his hand only found cold, hard ground.
For the first time in his life Tony wanted to be touched, pulled, held. The height difference made him feel safe, not small. The kiss made him feel whole, not lonely. The closeness to Steve warmed the darkest and coldest parts in him. And so he wrapped his arms around Steve’s middle and moved his lips gently against Steve’s.
James’ eyes were shiny as well, the tears sitting there, threatening to well over and roll down his cheeks because listening to the man he loved cry so hard and so much was officially the most painful thing he had ever had to endure second
“You really think it’s the same person?”
Steve wanted to say he wasn’t escaping. That he had no intention of running scared from anyone but he knew that wouldn’t sit well with Tony. “There’s a set of house keys in the car. Ma will be with you, she knows all the secret ins and outs of his home,” he told him. “I’ll meet you there. No one knows I live here but the guys. My address is listed as halfway across town. To keep you all safe, I have to come separately.”
He decided to get familiar with the house and walked through it, apart from Sarah’s and, of course, Steve’s rooms. He took his time, careful not to tire himself out so early in the day.
They fell into silence again, each processing this information. Tony and Clint had probably talked about this, said their goodbyes to each other when they thought they had reached their final moments. They wondered when it had first dawned on them, when they had first concluded that no rescue was coming.
Blood went everywhere and James dropped him, stepping on him as he moved to get to Steve who was trying to keep his breathing even but was quickly bleeding out. “Steve, Stevie, hey, hey, stay with me.” He was lightly slapping his face. Steve had lost a lot of blood already and he couldn’t keep his eyes open.
“We’ll need two coats for each of them as well, scarves, gloves and a big boy hat for Benni,” she said and made Tony sit down. “You be good, I’ll handle everything.” She gave him a glass of water and went to choose whatever it was she just said. Tony was feeling overwhelmed and wanted nothing more than to sleep.
Natalia had been nodding slowly as James spoke and he assumed that was a good sign but now as he waited patiently for her to say something, he began to have doubts. What if it was still too materialistic and not enough sentimentality?
The door unlocked and he made it outside where he was greeted by harsh and cold wind that stung his eyes almost immediately. How was he supposed to make it in this weather? He needed to try. He promised Clint! There was a chance that he would be back with Steve soon. What was the cold when he had Steve to look forward to?
People jumped out of the way left and right as Steve went bounding down the blocks, gun in hand. He came to an abrupt stop when he reached the deli. The lights were off but the door was left ajar. He pushed his way in and to the back where he assumed the passage was into their home.
, maybe he could get over Tony like he did James.
Clint shrugged. He inhaled deeply and then banged on the door. Honestly, they couldn’t have thought so little of them to not even guard them at night, right? And then Clint thought about it from their point of view: a deaf, broke bar owner and a, well, for lack of a better term, kid. He could see how they might assume James and Steve were the only fighters in the relationships.
Steve gave Tony a squeeze and then gently pulled away, caressing his cheek as he passed him to go over and inspect the food and see what was on offer for tonight. Sarah swatted him away but pressed up on her tiptoes to kiss her son’s cheek.
“Barnes,” Rhodey supplied.
Tony got up, smiling. He loved that she always looked out for her family.
“We’re sorry, Sam,” Steve said. Tony nodded and agreed.
The door opened and Phil Coulson smiled back at James. That is, until his eyes fell on the six-foot-two block of muscles that was Steve Rogers.
“A little too full from dinner,” James assured her, helping Clint up.
He wondered what kind of space he was being kept in. Was he given a blanket? A cot? Something other than a hard floor, at least.
“Just text him, Tony. I realize I can’t stop you,” he sighed, helping himself to more pasta and an unnecessary amount of parmesan.
After dinner he got his brother ready for bed, they brushed their teeth, he read him another chapter in his book and kissed him goodnight before heading back downstairs with his own book. It was then that he noticed he hadn’t seen a television in this house yet and somehow he preferred it this way.
It still helped to actually see Steve lying in his bed, even if he looked pale. He would recover. Sarah kept holding onto Tony until they stood right next to Steve’s bed. Quickly Tony got her a chair so she could sit down, holding Steve’s hand and speaking in Gaelic to him. Tony grabbed the chart to see exactly what had been done to Steve and took the information all in.
James let go of Steve, steadying himself and making his way over to Clint. With his inhibitions infinitely lowered, he bent to kiss Clint, his tongue slipping into his mouth as he kissed him breathless and then pulled away, still smiling.
She eyed him. “There are lines we don’t cross even in this business. Bakuto has crossed them all and then some.” She sipped her tea again and then Li Qiang re-entered, coming over to set down the documents and leave. She pushed the folder towards James. “We have a saying in Mandarin:
“No, nothing on heaven or earth could drag me out of Belfast,” Pinky laughed. “Least of all, America. Er, Cap, was it this one you were wanting?” He gestured to the car they were in. “Or another?”
“Do you think they’re together?”
“Well, just make sure to call often and I’ll put the phone to his ear,” Natalia said, smiling. Clint leaned to press a kiss to her hair. “By the way, how’s life without that cinder block on your leg?”
Steve pulled Tony’s hand to his face. “No,” he said softly, “no, this is enough.” He brushed Tony’s knuckles along his cheek, closing his eyes. He turned his face quickly to press his lips to his hand and sighed.
“Feeling better?” he asked, his head turned so Clint could see.
“Why is that?” Clint asked outright, more than a little tired of feeling like the town pariah in this house whenever Steve was around. “Is it because of how protective you are of James? Or is it because of Tony?”
Tony sat up and hugged his knees close to his chest, resting his chin on top of them and taking deep breaths. So much was happening. He didn’t even know where to begin to sort his thoughts. If only everything was as easy as numbers, doing chores, running the store. How did one deal with any of this?
“I’ll handle it,” Dugan said dismissively, stomping his cigarette out on the sidewalk.
to pay for
“I’m fine.” There was no way he would ever leave Steve’s side if he didn’t absolutely have to. She looked to Steve and then back to Tony, her gaze softening. She kissed the top of his head and thanked him. Together with Benni she headed home—to which one exactly he didn’t know. They’d probably go back to Steve’s house soon.
“Fine. I don’t know why.”
“Dmitri won’t be there?”
“We don’t have to go, you know,” James said, his voice softer. “We can stay here. I’m guessing it’s been a while since you were with someone who knows what they’re doing.” He moved closer, close enough that he could feel Steve’s shaky exhale on his stomach.
They reached the gym of the other building and Steve made sure to lock the door behind him. It had two latches and a deadbolt. Falsworth was in the gym when they arrived, going toe-to-toe with a sandbag and he nodded to them as they passed.
Clint leaned forward and pressed a kiss to his forehead. “See that? That’s just a preview. You won’t even know we’re on a plane by the time I’m done with you. So tell me more about this fear. Why does it exist?”
“Aw, feck off,” he told him, going over to Tony and putting a hand on his own. He gave it a light squeeze in hopes he’d wake slowly, peacefully.
“Hmmm, thirty minutes is plenty of time if you want,” Tony said in a rather suggestive tone, knowing well what it did to Steve.
“I mean,” Steve began, “a large part of it is just because I haven’t been this close with James in… years, actually.” He hadn’t realized it until Tony mentioned it just then and then he’d spent those moments thinking about it but it was true. After Steve got back from the war, he and James were still close but there was a tangible distance between them.
desserts tonight,” he said, looking up at Steve from beneath those inky black eyelashes, his meaning crystal clear.
Tony sat down and looked at the files but every now and then he looked at Steve, listened to his voice—sometimes stern, sometimes a perfect American accent, other times very thick Irish—and at one point he got up and walked around the desk as much as the line allowed him to. Tony paid special attention to how naturally Steve unbuttoned his jacket when he sat down, straighten the back of his jacket, how he buttoned it up easily with one hand when he got up. He was very good at it. So good you’d miss it if you didn‘t know he was doing it.
“I love you. You know that, right?”
Dmitri took the Patek first. It was beautifully made, lightweight and sleek. The face was large and the leather band was soft against his fingertips. The face displayed the time, day of the week, and the month. It had a very simplistic elegance about it that Dmitri personally felt could very easily sum up Clint. While Clint seemed rough around the edges, Dmitri had seen him shoot downstairs in the range and knew that Clint had a precision and elegance about him that rivaled James, he just chose not to showcase it.
respond when I call you!” Howard turned his son around forcefully, making him drop a few olives. “What did I tell you about wasting food?” he yelled and Tony was quick to pick up the olives and run them under water to clean them off properly.
“I told you everything I know! I—”
They made sure to visit every animal they could, walking around and taking their sweet time. They even had overpriced and stale sandwiches and Tony absolutely loved it.
“Okay,” he said quietly. “As much time as you need.” James gave him a smile and left.
“Good, just widen your stance and take a shot. Don’t forget the forward lean. I don’t want you doing more harm than good.” Tony took a shot and this time it landed on the target. Not the bullseye but within a ring and that was progress.
Clint was relieved that Tony seemed as excited to see Clint as he was to see him, smiling and following Tony over to the couch. He propped his crutches up on the couch and carefully plopped down, keeping his casted leg raised.
“What happened?” Clint asked, sitting up a little to see if he was hurt anywhere else, his eyelids still tinted a little red from the tears but all in all he felt better than he had.
“I will react when you call me by my name,” Tony said as he dried the olives and put them in the container with the others. He didn’t even see his father raising his hand to hit him, barely even felt the strike across his cheek from being way too tired and used to the physical abuse. All he felt was his cheek warming up and a slight stinging.
Steve shrugged. “He doesn’t like asking for help and certainly doesn’t like anyone thinking he
“Last I recall you told me no when I proposed,” James teased, poking his side, and Clint turned his face so he could look up at him.
Tony blushed for some irrational reason when Steve pulled the covers away. After last night there was really no reason anymore, was there? At first he didn’t understand what Steve was apologizing for.
It was such a small touch but it made all the difference to Tony. It made focusing on the movie much more difficult. Every now and then when he reached into the box of popcorn, his and Steve’s hand would brush against each other. It was an accidental touch. Even smaller than his knee against his thigh. So small but so warm. A warmth that spread through Tony’s body once again. A warmth that Steve caused. Fuzzy, fluttering, comfortable, safe.
When the phone rang a second time, Clint sighed loudly and decided to answer it. He headed downstairs, which was noticeably easier without his cast—getting that thing removed had actually set him off on a high that lasted a few hours—and into the kitchen where the phone was. Lucky followed and headed for his food bowl, happy to find some kibble.
Natalia looked up from the notebook and winked at Clint. She handed it over and Clint thanked her.
With the light on he could see Steve next to him. He traced the strong features of his face down to his neck and shoulders, tracing smaller and bigger scars that were scattered around on his torso, each one telling a different story. Those that were still the freshest were hurtful reminders of how close Steve had come to being killed. And now they were here, in the middle of nowhere together. Just the two of them.
Even when Steve turned away, Tony continued to look at him. There was even more to take in. Tony brought joy to people? He knew Benni loved him, but for the longest time he had assumed that wouldn’t always be the case. Especially not if he got to a better environment than what they were used to. And even though they had a new home and new people around them, Benni still loved him, would continue to do so. And even more than that Steve would have been sadder without Tony. There was that fluttering in his heart again, the warmth that spread throughout his whole body and felt better than a hug.
Once out of his clothes and in the bright light of the bathroom in his room, Tony saw himself in the mirror and flinched. That couldn’t be him! He looked nothing like that! There was the shadow of a beard on his face, he looked exhausted and all the colors of the rainbow were on his body.
Inside again, Steve led him into the living room, sitting him down on the couch with his arm still around him. “Tony?”
The mention of his brother made Tony’s heart ache even more. James didn’t leave out anything, did he?
Steve grabbed him by the wrists, feeling the man’s pulse speed up even faster as James walked towards him with the thin metal rods in his hand. They were about the length of a chopstick but just thicker than a needle.
“Time to party,” he said, grabbing his jacket as he swung open the bedroom door and they headed downstairs. With perfect timing, Dugan came in and they all headed back out to their cars, driving there separately.
“The last time you were that far away, I spent every day wondering if I’d ever see you again,” Natalia confessed and Clint only tightened his hold on her in response. “At least this time I won’t have to worry about that. Well—”
“Some are, some aren’t. I’m not even sure how Falsworth and Jones will react once they inevitably find out. For some of those trigger-happy drug addicts,” he said, knowing his men were involved in much worse things than homosexuality and yet, “being what I am is the worst sin out there. I’ve heard ‘em talking enough. Saying they should bring back public execution for people like me. Burning at the stake, all that shite and in the same breath they’ll mention how they stabbed a man for not sharing his seat on a bus. Some of ‘em just need to go. It’s time.”
“Does your father do any work?” He asked, just the right amount of venom in his voice for his liking.
Tony laughed again, swaying with him slowly. “Alright. What do I get once I have all the cars? What else do people buy with money?”
would’ve done; taken the spoil and gotten rid of the loose ends for kicks,” Steve said bitterly but there was something else to his tone that sent a chill down James’ spine.
They pulled up around back and went inside, James’ right hand man, Dmitri opening the back exit for them and greeting them both. Steve ate his apple as they made their way to the fifth floor where there was a permanently closed wing. It had been closed since the start of the Great Depression and World War Two hadn’t seen it in operation either. James tended to use it for unsavory business. Now it was being used for just one person.
Despite Steve and James’ requests and suggestions for heightened security, they must reluctantly accept that they’re dating equally stubborn and persuasive men. Unfortunately, this is one time Clint and Tony should’ve listened.
“Well, if he steals Lucky, I will be heartbroken but then I’ll visit more and maybe James will let me adopt more dogs too,” Clint said, his hand on his chin as he pondered the pros and cons. “Biologically, just one. An older brother. But I think of Natalia as my family. And honestly Dmitri too. I’ve known him almost… wow, almost eight years, I think.” To think that he had been that close to James all this time was insane and a little sad but he had him now and that was all that mattered.
“How’s the pain, pet?” The question was of course directed at Tony. It had been a while she figured since he’d last taken a pain tablet. It must hurt.
“They had to reset your leg. Your tibia was fractured and had started to heal incorrectly. They checked your ribs as well.”
Steve listened to Tony talk, watching him like he was just the most precious person in the world. Seeing Tony get flustered while talking confused him but he chalked it up to them not being used to just chatting like this and because Tony kept slipping up in what he was saying. Complimenting Steve’s looks and then his eyes but by his expression Steve assumed he had just noticed but didn’t want Steve to misinterpret it as more than observation but that was fine. Steve was just happy to know Tony had noticed things about him.
“I know, Tony.”
“In the meantime, I’ll start canvassing the area. See if any of the businesses nearby saw anyone come in or out of Clint’s bar this morning,” Natalia offered, waiting, surprisingly, for the go ahead from James who nodded and she pushed up and away from the table, saying a polite goodbye to Sarah before she left the kitchen.
“How do you make these things look comfortable?”
“In your dreams,” Steve said, walking over to offer his mother his arm as they headed upstairs.
“Pepper. She gave Benni the invitation the other day. It’s all official and planned out.” He hummed, pressing another kiss on Steve’s head. “Is Dugan serious with his bird?”
“And all mine,” James said.
yet warmed Sarah’s heart.
“It’s all good and well, Rhodes. Thankfully I didn’t break into the Zodiac killer’s apartment. In fact, this guy is cute as hell and even almost offered me coffee.” Tony was grinning over at him and yeah, Steve had noticed that his intruder was devastatingly handsome, even hungover and disheveled as he was. “Come get me please.”
He paused and then continued, but slower, not sure if he was hearing pain or pleasure but he assumed the latter until he heard a soft thud and what he thought was a sniffle.
The next morning Tony felt exhausted though he never slept more in his life. It was the weekend and he knew that would mean no work, no school and with that not a lot of things to do to keep himself distracted. He really liked the work he was doing for and with Steve. How would he continue doing that?
“Yes, actually,” Tony answered before yawning. He nuzzled against Steve’s chest, pressing a lazy kiss on top of his heart. “You’re my favorite pillow and I missed you.”
“Yeah, kinda. You kinda grew on me,” Tony said and snorted. “You do have James and Natalia though.” He’d only met her briefly but Benni had told him a lot about her.
Steve found those eyes he loved so much a few seconds after waking and he was deeply, deeply ashamed. “I wanted to forget for a while. The first part is always fun, the second part… not so much. Tony, I am so sorry.” He wouldn’t say he didn’t mean any of it because he’d meant all of it. Not that he didn’t want Tony around but just that he wanted to be left alone.
He didn’t let James’ identity stop him from getting to know James or from flirting. He didn’t let getting chased that night stop him from walking home. He didn’t let all the things Bakuto and his men had done to him stop him from calling Bakuto a stupid fuck
“That I do but,” he said, putting a hand on either of Tony’s shoulders and looking at him in the mirror, “you got this. Now go enjoy your date.”
“Hand it over,” Bucky said, coming back out of the kitchen, removing his rubber gloves and reaching out for the folder in Steve’s hands.
“I see Benni’s taken to Lucky,” James said and Clint nodded. James switched to Russian and said,
Steve sighed, merging into the turning lane as he racked his brain an answer. “Cars?”
“Steve!” Tony said carefully, as if saying that name out loud might wake him from this beautiful dream.
“Very noble and not very selfish.”
Steve walked back downstairs with Sarah in silence, doing his best not to look towards Tony’s bedroom as he passed. He stuffed his hands into his pockets to give himself something to do and Sarah sighed.
Sarah held out her arms for the incoming hug and cheek kisses and was led to a comfortable leather chair in the office that sat across from the big oak desk at an angle. The office was much more elaborate than Steve’s. Steve had simple but good taste. He liked things well-built and beautiful. He didn’t need additional designs or embellishments if they weren’t a part of the initial creation and added no functional benefits.
been born yesterday if you think I only have one.” He entered Falsworth’s space and the man swung at James again and again, but James dodged each one like he knew it was coming and then he grabbed him, holding him in a headlock. James stabbed him in his side with the second knife, making Falsworth drop the one he was holding and then James pulled the original blade from his shoulder and slit Falsworth’s throat. He didn’t have time or the desire to prolong his death.
Steve shrugged. “Happened to me. Happened to James. Happened to a lot of my men when we came back from fighting.” And then he corrected himself, “
Steve chuckled. “How about a driver’s license first? I can already see the headline: Italian man parks in the middle of Times Square, the Irish mob shows up, everyone confused.”
“Yeah, he just arrived. I told him Jones needed some help, which he does, just with some sorting. You want him back in here?”
Steve stared at the man. At James Montgomery Falsworth. He swallowed hard.
“There’s no other way.” Tony nodded and looked back to Sarah who was now holding his hand and asking for something to drink. He nodded and headed out of the room to get her water and some juice, as well as coffee for himself.
When he spoke, his voice was eerily calm. “There’s a good chance that had you told me this earlier, they would still be here. So just know that what Rogers will do and what I will do will be two separate punishments. I don’t know if you’re religious but if I were you, I’d start praying Bakuto doesn’t lay a hand on them.”
target on Clint’s back
Steve was quiet for a moment, his mouth moving around words he couldn’t quite form.
“The tea in that warehouse was lukewarm. Either they don’t know how to make tea properly or they hadn’t been gone all that long,” Dmitri said.
“Hi, darling,” she said, her lips tugging up into a mischievous smile that James matched.
The door was shut and, he assumed, locked and then he was alone again. They shoved food into the room about an hour later—a bread roll and some cold vegetables—but Clint had no appetite, so he did what he had been doing a lot lately. He took the bread and he tucked it away underneath the blanket they had brought, deciding he might eat the vegetables later.
Tony thanked him silently and took the glass to take a small sip. His throat felt dry from the startle but the warm drink helped. “No, thank you. It’s loud enough in my head as it is.” He handed Clint the glass back and scooted closer, turning his eyes back to the small flames.
When Sarah stood in front of Tony she didn’t need to say a word. After Steve had missed his check in time Tony had been worried, now he just knew that something was wrong, so terribly wrong. Benni was asleep but he quickly wrote a message, telling the boy to stay at home and not go anywhere.
“The Irish are coming. Their boss is with them. Fix up the best sides and sandwiches! Quick!” With that Howard left Tony in the kitchen. Had another week passed already? Their so-called protectors had come picking up the protection money a few days ago. Or was time blurring again?
“Oh god, why does that sound like we’re in trouble?” Clint groaned but the hand holding James’ really did tighten around his fingers and James sandwiched Clint’s hand between both of his.
“I don’t like girls, Benni. I’m not like most men.” He paused for a moment. “It’s frowned upon and if anyone knew we could be in trouble, Steve and I.”
Clint waited, not sure where this was going. He finished the rest of his milk and Lucky huffed, going back to sleep.
to be. “Mr Rogers?”
“Two,” Natalia said, smirking as she was given her menu, “dessert
“What happened?” James asked again, not entirely prepared to ask a third time. At least, not nicely.
“Hm, okay good to know. Coloring is one of my top talents but maybe I can teach him sign language,” Clint hummed, thinking. “How old is he?”
James and Steve?
Maria looked at all the knives on the wall and then to the one in Natalia’s hand. She looked back at James and stood a little straighter, as if trying to make herself seem tougher. James and Natalia both did their best not to coo at her innocence.
“Not really,” Benni admitted.
Tony let out a surprised sound, not having expected that at all, which made it so much better. There was nothing more attractive to him than Steve doing whatever it was he wanted to do. Preferably to and with Tony. The kiss also left him speechless and he didn’t know what to say.
He would—
“Upstairs are the bedrooms. Benni has his room on the left side of the hallway and Sarah moved down the hallway too… for reasons.” Tony blushed a little and cleared his throat. “Anything else? Oh, towels and such are in your bedroom.”
“See, you two are at fault. Besides, it’s not like it’s something we haven’t seen. We’ve all watched po—”
Tony watched the men leave and smiled when he noticed how a passerby reacted to seeing them, then looked at the deli and quickly moved on. Another man stopped walking and greeted Mr Rogers. Tony couldn’t help but wonder what having that much power must feel like.
“Alright, next time but nothing that will hurt you,” James added, going quiet when he realized that Clint was still talking, his voice just low and deep with the threat of imminent unconsciousness.
On the third day, after having worked until the early afternoon and then going back to training in the evening James joined them in the basement and after watching Tony for a while he walked up to him.
rude, at least.
When Tony regained consciousness, everything was dark but warm. So he ended up in hell? That seemed fitting given everything that had happened. He leaned back and closed his eyes to get some more rest. If he was dead, why did his body continue to ache? That hardly seemed fair but when had life ever been fair to him and why would it be any different now that he was dead. Tony wondered if there was any way he could find out about Benni and if he was okay.
James pulled him closer. “Nothing to thank me for. I’m just happy you enjoyed yourself.”
“You think I oughtta pull the trigger?” He asked, his blue eyes hard, unwavering. The kid didn’t speak. “Come on, one last chance to plead your case. Nothing?”
So he fought back, throwing out punches but they weren’t quite as strong as usual. He was exhausted and hungry and despite landing a few good blows, he was quickly tossed on his ass by the two men in his room and hit again.
Tony nuzzled against Clint’s chest like he did when they had been locked up. Now however there was a dog present, it was warm, comfortable and peaceful. Plus, he and Clint had gained back some of their weight, which made Clint even more comfortable now. The fact that they were showered and in clean clothes also helped. All in all it had been nice to sit with Clint but now it was even nicer.
“No,” James laughed, shaking his head.
When Steve groaned for the second time in ten minutes, Tony set the papers aside and looked up.
“Sorry,” Clint said, leaning against the doorframe to support his weight and get it off his foot. He would stay where he was until it seemed alright to come closer. “No, it’s just… you know, bad dreams. Thought I’d treat myself.” He lifted the glass of milk and shook it gently. “What about you?”
“I eat while I work. Coffee’s fine for me.”
They sat down on the couch in front of the windows and looked out for a minute, watching people and cars.
Steve took the scrambled eggs out of the pan and put them into their plates. “Talk to me,” he said, handing Tony a plate while he brought over the toast and sat.
“Did you?”
Lunch went great. Sam was a delight, even managing to get a reluctant smile out of James with a few of his jokes and Clint-related anecdotes. They were seated at a booth in a far corner after having arrived and entered through the back. Dmitri, despite trying to sit away from them but with a direct line of sight, was seated with them at James’ behest.
” in the softest way ever. When had he managed to pick that up from Maria? How much did he remember, Tony wondered.
James called him beautiful too often for Clint to not at least believe it a little bit but that was before. This was now and—
Tony sat down and before he could say anything she was already working on getting the sloppy bandages off his arm.
When Steve sat up, creating more space between them Tony got scared. He should have not said that. He was going to lose Steve. That was it? He sat up as well, bracing himself for whatever was going to come as he looked down at the couch.
Tony rested his hand on top of his shirt, touching the dog tags underneath.
Sarah.” Tony added with a nod.
“Go on then. Don’t keep them waiting.”
Natalia’s who wasn’t even involved in this to begin with. All thanks to you, Steve,” James snapped.
“I’m not. This was a fluke. Maybe even first date jitters.”
She nodded again. “Yes,
“Yes.”
“I don’t want to,” he said, forcing himself not to break eye contact. “Are you… sure?”
“So,” Clint began, “why the balcony?”
“You want to be with him, right? Want to be here? You know you don’t have to?” She kept her voice low but to Tony it felt like she could have been yelling. Her question repeated in his head over and over again.
Steve turned to him and pressed a kiss to his temple, lingering for a moment. He hoped like hell that Clint could help, that he would stay. All he wanted was for Tony to feel better.
Dugan came over to the desk and handed Steve an envelope, which Steve, after checking the sender, put into a desk drawer and locked it. “
“I don’t know. Sleep peacefully? Watch one of my shows you hate? Clean? The possibilities are endless,” he teased and Tony rolled his eyes.
“A wee bit overworked but otherwise good, thank you for asking, Dmitri.”
Tony nodded and before Sarah could say anything, Dmitri was already on his way and Tony turned back to Steve, still holding his hand in his.
“What? We’ll have to consider
James tossed his paper onto the floor and wrapped his arms around Clint, pulling him over into his arms to hold him. He rested his face in Clint’s hair and breathed in slowly and deeply.
“I’ve seen better days.”
Meanwhile Clint was trying his hardest to pretend he hadn’t noticed the dirtiness happening over at the oven. Steve really loved his little Tony, Clint thought to himself with a smile, averting his gaze so he wouldn’t see anything else he wasn’t supposed to.
for me.” He looked away, only bringing his face back to see if Tony had anything to add.
Howard looked at Tony and it obviously took him a moment to recognize him. When he did, he laughed and leaned against the wall behind him.
This was what he’d fought for, was determined to survive for. Not what,
“Fitz, what happened?”
He picked up the papers with shaky hands, bringing it to his face and removing a pair of glasses from his pocket. He looked over the page and each time he switched to a new one his breathing picked up.
“Food?” he asked, confused. “I didn’t expect them to bring us anything anymore.” He took a good look at Clint, taking in the bruises he could see, assuming that there was a lot more underneath the thin layer of clothing. “Are you okay?” he asked, now sitting up, grunting and groaning as he did.
Tony got his pants undone and then worked on his own but he only got the belt open and zipper undone before Steve’s hands pushed his out of the way as he broke the kiss for the moment.
“Mom would drag me and Barney there at the crack of dawn for mass,” Clint continued. “Everyone looked down on us, treated us like dirt. They were mean to my mom because my dad didn’t show, they mocked our clothes, called us poor and uneducated to our faces.” His nostrils flared in anger and he shook his head. “I hated it.”
.” The man scrambled over to the desk and stood in front of it.
Steve nodded and sat up, pulling Tony up with him, holding him in his arms. “So,” Steve began, his voice serious now, “Ma knows, Dugan and James and Dmitri who’s close to James all know. As far as this house goes, you do with me what you like but how will Benni feel?”
Steve and James watched their interaction with warm smiles, going to greet each other with a hug and when they pulled back they realized that yes, Tony and Clint both looked better but
“Pleasure to meet you,” Monet said, her voice soft, pleasant.
“Your job right now is to heal and get well. Yer not used to that, I know.” She rested her hand on his hand. “If you want, we can go out. There are some things that need to get done. I could use two lads to help carry everything.”
And as it turned out he did. He really had gone all out on his home safety since James’ last impromptu visit. The fact that they had still gotten in with minimal effort made James chuckle and Dugan turned to look at him.
Back in his office three days later—the doctor had all but forced him to stay four days at least—he sat at his desk and looked through all the files Dugan, Jones and James’ men had already crossed off. Nine of the twelve files. The original two who ran away after Steve was shot and Falsworth, still missing. Two more Dugan had cornered that morning but only one needed weeding out.
Clint had lied to Steve. He hadn’t lost his grip, he’d flailed out of bed at a nightmare, tried to land on his feet, and then fell onto his bottom when that endeavor sent a fire up the left side of his body. He was dizzy with pain and recovering from the nightmare when Steve of all fucking people knocked on his door. The one person in the house he didn’t want to talk to at that moment.
On one afternoon in particular he was making pastries with Sarah while listening to the radio. “Can I ask you a question,
An hour later, James returned, rolling his sleeves up and he nodded to Sarah. She sighed in relief, so tense for that hour she thought she’d never get her shoulders back down.
“You’re more than welcome. And hey, no pressure but Melinda would probably kick my ass if I didn’t at least say the raise would be nice. I do have a baby girl now.”
The last few weeks back home had been interesting for Clint. Saying goodbye had been a little bittersweet but it was nice being back in their bed, waking up and going into the kitchen dressed however he wanted to be dressed or sometimes not at all, much to Dmitri’s annoyance. And he missed his little group, the way his home setup worked. He liked being at the Rogerses’ but Dmitri wasn’t quite welcome to come and go as he pleased and Clint had really missed hanging out with him, teasing him.
I’ll call Dr Reyes after breakfast. Perhaps she can see us today.”
“He does work overtime often but he’s usually in his office. You have his number though. Just text him and ask him.” Rhodey watched Tony’s expression, factoring in every little nuance.
Steve chuckled. “My friends say I’m too healthy for my own good. Maybe tonight I’ll switch things up. Live a little. The cheesecake sounds good.”
A hand wrapped around Loki’s waist, the other snaking around him to grab a hold of him by his jaw and Steve pulled him close, tilting his head to speak into his ear. “Give Dmitri the gun or I’ll snap your neck.”
Tony nodded along. Good answers. “Rhodey wouldn’t tell me. You’re gay?” he asked and again Steve was surprised at the tactless questions. Maybe this wasn’t as good of an idea as he thought.
He wrapped his arm around him as tightly as he could and turned his head to press a kiss to his temple and hold it there.
They went inside the room to see Steve sleep, doped up on morphine, and in a hospital gown. He looked like he was just sleeping but James knew if he lifted that gown he would see the thick white bandages.
Steve laughed again, shaking his head. “You know, you need longer periods in between comforting James and jackass James.”
“Everything alright?” Sarah asked and rubbed Tony’s shoulder which made him flinch for the first time in weeks.
Before either of them said anything, James looked up at Dugan and then Dmitri. “If you two wouldn’t mind waiting outside.” It wasn’t a question, wasn’t even a request, and Dugan and Dmitri immediately excused themselves.
Fifteen different clothing stores and a handful of other specific retailers later, Dmitri was opening James’ car door for them to make their way back home. James slid inside and Dmitri started it up, pulling out of their parking space and checking on James in the mirror.
is selfish and you’re selfish because you’re
When they got to the house, Steve sighed in relief. Still cautious as ever, he entered through his office and in any case, that’s where Tony was. He knocked on his office door and the Dugan yelled, “come in!”
“Steve,” Tony sighed softly. “I don’t see how one thing has to do with the other. I’m quite comfortable and as long as you are, just enjoy your… how did you put it? Basic human... something.”
“I mean, if he allows it, I want you, Tony, and Benni staying with James until we can be sure either the traitors are weeded out or those who know don’t care.” Steve looked away and then back to his mother. “He won’t talk to me. Perhaps you can?” She nodded.
The door was shut and Clint decided not to see if it was locked because he figured there was someone standing outside his door and he wasn’t quite ready for whoever it was to know that he was awake.
Tony was about to say something about how Sarah didn’t make requests but he didn’t get to do that. Instead Steve showered him in love, held him and made Tony question how he worried in the first place.
“He talked to you today?” Tony asked, tapping his phone every three seconds just in case Steve texted him and he had just missed it.
Steve wanted to pull him all the way in his lap and cuddle him to his chest. To press kisses into his hair and wipe away any sign of tears. He wanted to rock him and sing to him until he fell asleep in his arms.
“Yes, sir.” Steve circled him as he spoke and every time he passed behind the man, Callahan tensed up.
The man wanted to know about Loki’s political aspirations and Loki had attempted to leave but was forcefully sat again by another man. He wanted to know what Loki was willing to do to continue moving up in the world, to which he had said, “Anything.”
Unfortunately, he was wrong. He heard them speaking and one called for Tony to come out. They probably thought he was a homeless person looking for shelter from the wind.
It very rarely failed to amaze Clint that the man comforting him, kissing his forehead, cooking him dinner, and coming to pick him up after a bad day was the head of the Russian mob. The same man had also proposed to Clint before, had given him a sweet pet name, and was soon taking him on a trip.
Clint walked over to the door, standing by it and closing his eyes as he counted to ten and then loudly shouted, “Hey!”
handsome, charming, well-spoken, and had made Steve laugh more times than he could count.
James was about to grab Clint’s hand when Benni touched him to ask him about teaching him Russian and James turned to the boy to chat. Clint had never felt paternal ever in his life. Never had the thought of children been one on his mind but now watching James interact with Benni, he felt a strange twisting in his stomach.
Tony looked at the papers in front of him. This was really happening.
“I do,” Clint said, his voice, although quiet, full of emotions. James smiled softly. “I love you too.”
him wanting to ask and it just—” He cut himself off, sighing and sipping his coffee. “I got mad at him on the way here, snapped, but seeing you helped. It’s nice.”
Steve nodded. “Good eye,” he agreed. “This is her favorite one. She likes to sit right there.” He pointed to the end of the couch closest to the fireplace. On the little table beside it was a book and he could see the little piece of yarn sticking out that she always marked her pages with.
, which in Mandarin meant something along the lines of pervert or low-life. Very fitting.
“Exactly,” he laughed. “Oh, the views! They’re spectacular. You’ve seen that picture in my room?”
“Five dollars,” he squeaked. He cleared his throat and once again turned his attention to Steve. “If you’re not here to collect then why…?” He trailed off, gesturing to the man in question.
The doctor swallowed hard and looked at the surgeon.
“Fuck off, Tony, I don’t want you here,” he told him, his voice flat and hard. He reached for the morphine button again, maybe he would just keep clicking it until it ran out. Until he didn’t have to feel bad anymore because all the bad feelings he’d been bottling up since his own father was around up to now were suddenly rushing towards the surface and he was not about to deal with that sober. Or conscious, if he could help it.
Natalia’s deep voice cut through James’ thoughts and grabbed his focus. He turned to give her a smile as she came in the room, a starstruck Maria in tow.
“Alright. I’ll allow it. Only because we have guests.” He let go of Steve and looked up at him. After a second he reached up to put a hand on Steve’s cheek, gently rubbing his thumb over his skin. “
“Would you like to go out again?”
“Well, had you told me earlier, I wouldn’t have had to. If someone found the connection between you and Clint, I’m sure they know about mine with Tony. It’s not right that you kept this from me.”
He knew they meant well and that they wanted to comfort him but those words meant nothing to Tony. He was the one to blame. His best hadn’t been good enough after all. “I should bring him to bed,” Tony said and got up slowly. Since Benni had been eating a lot more he also got heavier but Tony refused to not carry his brother to bed. He wouldn’t fail him again.
Tony flipped over, his eyes immediately sweeping up and down the paragon of perfect physiques that belonged to Steve Rogers. He made a vague gesture to all of Steve.
James clenched his fist around the hearing aid in his hand, his eyes stinging as he stared out the window. Bakuto had so much pain to look forward to in his immediate future.
Sarah rolled her eyes and shook her head softly. “Subtle as a shotgun, you two are,” she told them, leaving to go back to the living room. Steve grinned, taking Tony’s hand.
It was Sarah who found Steve and Tony hours later still curled up asleep on the couch. She could tell by the way Tony was rolled up into a ball against Steve’s side that he wasn’t handling it very well. Not that there was a good way to handle it and not that it came as a shock that he’d handle it this way either, but still.
“That a knife in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” Steve teased. James only barely smiled.
“We didn’t even bother with a church, just went to the courthouse. Nat had on a dress she’d scammed off this fella who owned a nice store and I was in a suit that would make James glare if he knew I owned it, let alone
“Were you busy?” Clint asked quietly after a long silence. He was doing everything in his power to hold himself together. He was too ashamed to have another breakdown right here so soon. He hoped he wouldn’t have another at all but especially not before he even had the chance to leave the bar.
before James and I were an item, ya floozy.”
Steve pulled back, an eyebrow raised in curious surprise. He glanced down and then back up at Tony, chuckling, his cheeks red. He was smirking when he spoke. “I… was unaware I had such a profound affect on you.” He let go of him and sat back, giving him the option to stand if he wanted.
“Tony, love.” He reached up with his free hand to wipe away the tear and then kept his hand on his cheek. “I promise. Nothing is more important to me than you and ma and Benni, alright?
“Alright,” he said and looked back at Steve. He wanted to say something else.
But his best friend was the only person he wanted to talk to right then and he couldn’t. Not only that, he
Clint opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again, unsure. “I was and then I wasn’t. It helps—being around you, it helps for sure. It’s just so sudden.” He scratched his head. “I guess it’s just been a while since I was a guest anywhere. It’ll be a lot to get used to. Being here.”
“Good morning, Timothy, love,” she said, once he was at the steering wheel, adjusting the mirror so he could see her. He nodded his head at her and smiled.
“It was that bastard’s and he’s being dealt with.”
“I appreciate it,” Steve said, nervous all of a sudden because had he done something?
” Tony said with a heavy sigh. “Why? You guys just started talking again.” He bit back another sigh, knowing that it wouldn’t help anyone if he told Steve what he likely already knew—that James wouldn’t like it and that it would probably mean two steps back with his closest friend. That wasn’t what Steve needed.
When he looked up from his glass of whiskey, his mother was staring at him from over her book. He put the glass down and decided to move away from her piercing gaze over to Benni who was drawing on the floor.
Now Steve was truly curious and Dugan stepped back to hold the door open for a woman with Steve’s blond hair and blue eyes but an even kinder smile.
The men at the doors nodded to her respectfully, opened the doors and offered to take her coat, which she accepted and they hung it up on a hanger in a big closet near the entrance.
It must have been around the two week mark when Tony noticed how thin he had gotten already. And wasn’t that just something? He hadn’t even noticed how much he had gained in the past few months in Steve and Sarah’s care.
“Jesus—” Bucky started but Sam gave him a look and he shut up. Sam Wilson was the only person on earth capable of silencing Bucky Barnes and Steve found himself somewhat amazed every time it happened. Even all these years later.
He looked up at him again. “Okay,” he said quietly, pulling the tray closer and sitting it beside his bed but not touching it. Maybe they weren’t going to poison him before but perhaps things had changed now. Maybe they were using Tony. A nice, innocent face.
“Don’t remember inviting your kind here,” Steve teased and James scoffed, sipping the drink Sarah poured him.
Tony got distracted by the sloppy and rather audible kissing coming from in front of him and he blushed. He pulled Steve in for another kiss and whispered in his ear. “I hope the only reason why you don’t greet me that eagerly is because of the others here.” He gently pinched Steve’s thigh and held his hand under the table.
Steve’s hands cupped Tony’s face and guided him in for another kiss. This one was sweet and gentle and way too intimacy-packed for two people who hadn’t even been on a second date yet.
She put it down and walked back over to him, taking his hand. “There’s nothing weak about admitting you need help.”
. Heartless and bloodthirsty? He thought back to seeing Howard at the hospital. Thin, wounded, tired. James and Steve had done that. Neither of them had explained why they did that to him. Even so Tony knew that it was because of what Howard had done to him.
James peeked around the corner and saw that once again the bedroom door was left slightly ajar and the room was dark. He pushed it open gently only to find it empty, Dmitri standing behind him looking over his shoulder into the empty room.
“It’s not that rare,” he told her. “I like both. I could probably find a wife if I was lookin’ but I’m not. I love Tony.”
, Rogers,” Falsworth spat. “To think I’ve spent all these years working under some vile beast of a man.”
And then other days Clint’s mind was just mean to him. On those days, Clint could land anywhere on the spectrum of moods—extremely clingy and needy, in dire need of alone time and sleep, or just… vacant. He was like the living dead, roaming the house, staring blankly, and not doing much else.
Tony shifted again, leaning closer to Steve. He knew that Steve had feelings for another or at least that he used to. Whatever the current situation was, didn’t matter. But Tony still needed to ask the question.
“Did you hear that? C’mon, we’re eating now,” Benni said and tried to unwrap Tony’s arms from around his legs.
Tony sat up straight and looked at Steve. He started several sentences but no sound came from his mouth. “But—” He looked at the papers in front of him. “That’s—” His heart almost stopped beating when he did the math in his head. “That…” He wrote down the number but it did nothing to help him clear his mind. “But... why?” He asked, completely out of breath and unable to move, the pencil still in his hand.
“Steve,” he said in a way that almost sounded as if he was scolding Benni. Almost. “I used to be last in bed and first up. I got four hours sleep tops. This counts as a full night’s rest.” He shrugged. “Your routine sounds much more worrisome.”
“No. It’ll be summertime. We’ll leave a little after Steve and Tony,” James told him, flipping to the next page and as always pulling out the sports page to hand to Clint who sat up to read along with him.
So maybe if the man said ‘jump’ I’d ask ‘how high.’ That’s not important here, Natalia. Measurements, now.” He held out his hand, opening and closing it impatiently.
He served their food, Steve pouring Benni hot cocoa and then looking at Tony and pouring him the rest.
“You got him?” James nodded, miming a throat cutting action, his face serious.
“Steve Rogers and you’re welcome.”
“Are you seriously trying to set me up with the guy who was too drunk to remember where he lived?”
He stood with Tony safe in his arms and carried him upstairs, lying him carefully on the bed before slowly removing his clothing.
James walked in, Benni on his hip. He put him down at the door and he ran over to Steve. James gave him a look, his eyes roving over Steve. He’d seen worse happen to him and he looked great already, all things considered.
Steve grinned too, catching Tony’s lips in a kiss before he answered. “So demanding,” he teased, kissing him again. “And yeah, I have a few.”
very close.
On the fifth day, Dugan asked Steve when he and James would be meeting for their drink and Steve said it was indefinitely postponed. Dugan contacted Dmitri but he didn’t pick up. Instead someone else he didn’t recognize did, though it was the phone in Dmitri’s office.
James studied his face. “Not going to push back even a little bit?”
“How did it go?” Tony asked.
love you,” he said softly. “I was scared you’d hate me if you knew… it’s... a lot to get used to right now. Bear with me?”
let’s get you cleaned up and changed.”
“Yeah.” He put his cup away and reached his hand out for Clint to take. He still needed the contact. “I don’t want to tell him. He feels bad and I don’t want that.” He leaned his head against Clint’s shoulder but sat up, thinking Clint still needed to read his lips for them to have a conversation.
“Why me?” He asked, leaning back away from Tony, enough that Tony’s hand fell away from his face. He sat up on the couch. Steve was aware that he was good-looking, rich, powerful and that these things were attractive and not that that was what he thought attracted Tony but it had happened in the past that someone he cared for was only interested in one or more of those things. With Tony, he worried more about a sense of duty, of gratitude, a need to repay Steve in any way possible even if Tony didn’t realize that was what he was doing. Steve needed to know Tony loved him for him.
Clint’s eyes narrowed. “Listen, I’m deaf and reading your lips. Did I misread or did you say you’re seeing a very influential person?”
In an attempt to hide his watery eyes, he rested his head on his knees again and tried to take calming breaths. Then he remembered that Clint couldn’t hear, so he allowed himself to take those shaky breaths that seemed to be stuck inside of him and needed to be released.
“Thanks,” Dugan said, nodding up at Tony. Steve just watched, curious, his hand coming up to his chin.
Tony caught glimpses of James when he came and asked to speak to Steve alone. That surely didn’t help reduce Tony’s paranoia or anxiety. Though it lessened his appetite, which Sarah noticed immediately and made sure Tony knew she knew.
“Thanks, Cap.” Steve had told Benni he could call him ‘Steve’ but after hearing the others call him ‘Cap’ and getting the story behind it—Steve’s time in World War II where he, as their Captain, lead his men and helped most of them keep their lives—he’d started using that nickname. Those remaining men were Timothy Dugan, Gabe Jones, and James Montgomery Falsworth.
All in all he was in surgery for five hours. They lost him once more and panicked but managed to get a pulse back and close him up. The prognosis was good but it would be a long road to recovery.
Falsworth went five shades paler. James walked towards him slowly, his eyes cold and expression murderous, literally. “You have something that belongs to me and you hurt
“I’m so sorry,” Clint breathed, not even sure he had actually voiced the words or just mouthed them. What the hell had he been thinking? Risking Tony’s life like this? He gently touched Tony’s fingers, curling two of his around them and giving them a very light squeeze. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
“Building 234?”
Tony nearly choked on a vegetable but managed not to go into a coughing fit and took a sip from his water. “Never got to try it.” He felt quite ashamed at that.
Tony held onto Benni, making sure he knew that he was still there for him too. When Benni didn’t answer at all Tony gently rubbed his back.
“The more the merrier,” Tony said, though if anyone else joined there was a good chance he’d glare at them. Rhodey sighed and they walked on, actually doing a tour now since Rhodey had fully intended on just showing him out.
While the man was still passed out, Tony quickly looked around the new room. It was definitely warmer and there was no draft anymore, but it also lacked privacy. Privacy to lick his wounds and miss Steve; to daydream about better times and say a quick prayer.
It had been nice having Pepper here. It was nice to see Tony catching up with an old friend, someone his own age. Tony was mature for his age and Steve never wished he were any older, but he also at times forgot that they weren’t the same age and that maybe having someone like Pepper around more often could be nice. Clint was older than Steve so he didn’t count.
“You look like ya seen a ghost,” Pepper joked, stealing a marshmallow from Tony’s untouched hot cocoa. “Does it bother ya not to be the big brother anymore?”
“So what do you do, Tony?”
Suddenly he heard a noise, something that sounded like someone putting a cup down too hard on a saucer. Tony didn’t know how far away it was or even where the noise came from. He counted to a hundred to give himself enough time to gather the courage to continue.
,” he said with a sly grin.
Fury was standing outside his office talking to his assistant Maria as they walked up. She nodded to the three men who greeted her and then went off to make the copies Fury needed.
“With you and Tony missing, no one really felt like celebrating anything. Besides, a big Christmas dinner isn’t quite tradition and after this and last year, I don’t see it ever becoming one.” He tried not to talk about what had happened, not even in vague terms, because he knew that it of course still affected Clint. James had been able to get him to talk about it a little bit but mostly, Clint didn’t want to and he respected that but still he worried about him.
“Not even dinner?”
Steve chuckled. “So I’ve been told. It’s skittish, though.” He looked over at Clint and then flat out said, “I’m sorry. You’re a guest in my home and I haven’t been very welcoming.”
Tony smiled and let out a shaky breath he didn't realize he was holding. It felt good to hear that from James directly. He nodded and turned back to Steve. "That's your food. Be good and eat it," he said with a small grin as he sat down on his bed.
He stepped backwards, trying to pry his eyes away from his reflection. Hideous. That was what he looked like. And not like himself.
Tony felt comfortable, he really did. So why was his heart beating so fast and why did he feel the need to run away? He bounced his leg nervously under the table, nibbling on his chicken.
“We’re all ears,” Maria said.
“So how much next time, Stark?” Dugan asked and it was very clear that he was frustrated with having to ask a second time.
Steve raised his eyebrows. “You? Nervous?” He scoffed. “That’s hilarious.”
It took him a minute to calm his breathing. What James and Steve did was none of his business. Sarah probably knew, she must know. She knew everything. It wasn’t his place to judge or say anything. Not that he would. How had he not seen it before? Granted, there had been a lot of things going on and he didn’t see James around a lot.
“‘M stubborn as an ass,” Steve told him. “That’s what ma says anyway.” He reached for Tony’s hand and James didn’t react beyond watching the interaction he’d never truly witnessed.
James nodded. “Tea?” he offered, raising his cup.
“Did he seem… uncomfortable this morning?” Steve asked her. She thought back and then shook her head.
Tony held his pounding cheek, tasting blood again, and keeping his eyes shut. Why was this so difficult to endure?
“What is it you’re asking?” Steve taunted.
“I’m going to have to call it as well. You coming?” He asked, standing and looking down at Tony with a smile. He reached over to grab his discarded clothing from the other couch and moved slowly towards the door, waiting for Tony’s response.
“Hey there,” Steve said softly, his hand going to Tony’s hair. “Have a nice nap?”
James asked a few more questions and got answers to only some but confused ‘no’s to others. He whispered something to Dmitri who nodded.
“You can do whatever you want to,
Steve slammed his fist down on the table and even Dugan winced. “Out, take the girl,” he told him and Dugan stood and took Pepper by her arm, gently, and led her out, shutting the door.
“Clint,” he said, speaking quietly because he a) couldn’t hear his volume and b) wasn’t sure if the men were standing outside listening to his every word. “Who are you?”
“I do know that,” Clint reassured him again. But Tony was young, he was small, and he repeatedly mentioned how accustomed to safety he had become under Steve’s protection. Clint knew he could look after himself but when he added up all of those factors plus the fact that he liked Tony, it equaled big brother Clint.
“Tony?
She reached out to Benni and ruffled his hair and he smiled. Then her eyes fell on Tony and Steve. She wondered what had happened since she’d been gone but she didn’t ask. She was still processing everything with James.
Steve trailed his finger down Tony’s chest to his thigh, making a little circle on it before going back up.
Tony didn’t just change oil or fix broken hubcaps, he modified, restored, and sometimes even completely rebuilt old cars, new cars,
Steve turned to Tony, reading the anxiousness in his features. He pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s cheek and then turned to the rest of the table, clearing his throat to briefly interrupt the conversation between Sarah, James, and Clint.
“Let him be,” Sarah told him sternly and Steve dropped his head, feeling a little ashamed. She put potatoes on his plate, some duck, and some asparagus and then did the same for Benni but a third of the portion she gave to Steve.
did I not make clear to you?” He was walking Tony towards the sleeping area, a small room lined with single beds for the times when they or the other shift had to stay overnight or simply needed a nap.
Sarah cleaned her hands on her apron, the calm, sweet smile ever present on her lips. Tony knew what she was going to say.
Steve decided to down his drink first, wiping his mouth. “What if… what if a small part of them fears us? Resents us? Since then, the idea has seemed sillier and sillier but I still can’t quite get it out of my head. What they went through… what was done to them... we do that on the regular. It’s the job, James. That
“I’ll miss you too,” Benni said and Steve smiled, warmed by his words.
This went on for four days before any of them saw him again. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to see them, he just didn’t want to talk about it. About how he was feeling or what he was thinking or how much he missed James already. It wasn’t because four days had passed without his presence but because he knew these four days were only the beginning. There was a good chance he wouldn’t see James again for weeks. Months maybe.
Clint chuckled. “Tall, might have been a Greek god in a past life, the voice. I mean, blonds aren’t my thing but Steve? I get it.”
“The clock is ticking, Romanov. Your little pet won’t sound as well the next time I call.”
That thought hurt Steve’s heart. No, Tony might not have trusted Clint but at least he would have someone to talk to. Someone going through the same thing.
joined
“What happened,
let anything bad happen to him ever again. The next person to so much as think a negative thought towards him would be get—
The blanket was the nicest thing that happened. From there everything went downhill. Every day he was woken up in the loudest way possible and they seemed to enjoy seeing Tony jump. Every time they brought the food—usually not more than two plain potatoes with a few carrots or some peas on the side—they insulted him.
Not having expected that at all, Tony startled and could feel his heartbeat quicken.
And Steve had been busy. It had been the busiest two days of the summer so far and that was really saying something when he factored in the possibility of them having stumbled upon a serial arsonist targeting diners in Brooklyn and Queens.
be here. He wasn’t ready, he’d only come back because these were dire circumstances.
“At least, nothing that we think either of them would be willing to do,” Steve clarified.
“I really like Mars because it’s red and right next to us. Did you know our moon is not a planet?” Benni asked.
“Falsworth?” Steve called before they left out, curling his index finger back and Falsworth came as called. He got right to the desk and Steve spoke, in Gaelic, “
Steve put his hands on his hips, looking down at the ground. He let out another sigh, his cheeks puffing out with the effort.
“The office.”
“Should it have?” He snapped and James ignored his tone.
Even though his wrist was still giving him a hard time Tony would not ask Pepper for help again. And then the phone finally rang and Howard didn’t make it to the phone before Tony did. Dugan placed their usual order and after a moment of silence Dugan told Tony to make his personal favorite. As per usual he didn’t care to wait for an actual reply and hung up on Tony. His personal favorite?
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” James said, taking his hand and squeezing it. “Don’t you even
“Alright, I’ll make brownies next. I don’t have much experience with chocolate but I’ll try.”
“Her and James in the same room is not a room I would like to be in. Imagine they wanted to know something from me. I’d tell them everything.” He chuckled softly. “Benni needs time with new people. He’s shy and gets scared easily.” He wanted to say something but was cut off by a yawn. “Do you know what Steve and James are talking about?”
