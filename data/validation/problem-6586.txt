“Why don’t you listen?  Huh?  How many times—Jesus, Tony, I was still working with those!  Now, they’re—junk.  Useless.  Put in some stupid toy,” Howard said, voice going high and tight, too loud in the quiet, with just the soft whir of the camera recording and the heavy silence that followed Howard’s outburst.  He was bent over, shaking the robot in front of Tony’s face, and Steve could taste metal in the back of his throat and realized his whole body had gone rigid with the need to move, to do something, to stop this, this dawning horror, because he had been there before, on his knees, tiny and small and scared while someone shouted, someone loud and big. Someone who could hurt.  “I told you not to go poking around in my lab, didn’t I?  Didn’t I?  Answer me!”
Stane shifted slightly.  “If he touches him again, you can shoot him,” Tony said almost lightly to Happy.  And for the first time, Steve noticed that there was a bulge under Happy’s evening jacket, a reminder that Happy was, after all, Tony’s bodyguard, and for the first time, actually looked the part.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve said softly, turning to look at him while one hand hung loosely on the eyepiece.  He reached out with his other hand and wrapped it around Tony’s wrist, over the pulse point, just for an instant, before drawing back.  “I like listening to you.”
“Got it in one,” Tony grinned.  “Some guys, I don’t know, like they think it’s more manly or some shit to top.  Since, you know, women bottom.  Or something.  Hey, don’t look at me like that.  I didn’t come up with this,” Tony objected, holding out his hands in a placating gesture.
A few months.  He only had to keep Tony’s interest for a few more months, only had to do this for a little longer, and he could be free.  Why was joy not singing through his veins at this gift?  Why did his stomach feel hollow and his throat so tight?  Why could he not seem to swallow?
The guy, Tony now, sat the tablet down in his lap and angled his torso towards Steve.  “You have absolutely no idea who I am, do you?” he said with a tone of amazed amusement.
“Ha. Funny. You’re funny. You insane alien idiot! You could have been killed!” Tony shouted, spreading his arms out in emphasis.
“Fifty bucks says it’s paints,” Barnes smirked up at Tony from his place on the sofa, eating Tony’s food and drinking Tony’s beer and being obnoxiously observant.
Tony nodded. That was so considerate of Bruce, Tony thought as he stepped around the Mark Twenty-Seven, tugging Steve behind him. Bruce was really so thoughtful. “Sentry mode,” he told the armor. Just in case. You never knew. Couldn’t be too careful and all that.
about Tony getting all twisted up thinking about it.  He would be hard and ready by the time he got here, Tony knew from experience.  Maybe they wouldn’t even make the bed.  He’d gotten carpet burns once, though Steve felt terrible about it the next day.
“I know,” Steve replied after a beat, though there was something off about his voice.  Hoarse, maybe.  Wrong.  Maybe Steve thought Tony was too old for him.  Lots of Alphas wanted young Omegas for reasons that were both obvious and gross.
“I’d blocked from my mind how much Matthew loves his horses,” Tony sighed. He rubbed at his forehead and flattened his mouth into a slight frown.  “I nearly fell asleep over dessert last night. I blamed Steve for tiring me, of course, which is true--you just picked that up off the ground and you’re going to eat it?  I can’t watch. Steve, you see? This is
Steve’s head snapped around, sure he hadn’t heard correctly, but Tony was already lowering himself into the limo and slamming the door.  He looked to Bucky in confusion, but Bucky was grinning gleefully.  He turned to Steve with a wry smile, pulling him inside the building’s front doors as the limo sped off.  “You know…” he started, scrunching his face and tapping his chin with one finger, pitching his voice in an exaggerated fashion as if he was pondering something, “You know, it’s possible I was wrong when I said Stark didn’t have real feelings for you.”
“I ate too much and boiled down some rye to help and it turned out to have some kind of contamination on it that caused a momentary hallucinatory episode,” Bruce explained.  “That’s all, Tony. And it wasn’t a village. It was a few walls that were damaged, some furniture, and a couple of scared servants. Hardly the stuff of destiny,” Bruce shrugged, then made a sharp, excited sound as he bent to pluck a bouquet of strangely cloudlike mushrooms that were growing from the base of a large oak.  “Ah-ha. See?” he said proudly, holding the mushrooms up for Tony. “Do you know what this is? Of course you don’t, because you never read the books I give you, which, you could do every once in a while. I know, I know, it’s all soft, squishy science, but it
“It’s horrible, I know.  When we get back to Malibu, I’m going to work on something nicer.  Not much I can do about the size, but I’ll see what I can—“ Tony started, fighting back the sickening feeling in his stomach that always came when he thought about this thing that was in him now, that someone had put in him, and he couldn’t do anything about it except try to make it his.  He was trying.   It had been so long since he’d hated a part of himself, but damn if it wasn’t easy to pick right up where he’d left off.
“Get back into bed, Tony,” Steve said in a flat, tired voice.  “You don’t need to do this.  You should be resting.”
“Calumnies.  Lies. Aspersions,” Tony objected.  “I have never mocked the badges.”  There was a loose smile on his face, and it was obvious this conversation was a rehash of one of many, but Steve could feel the affection between the two of them.  How many times had he and Bucky spoken their own, secret language, he wondered a tad wistfully.  It had been a long time since they’d talked like that.  Well, it had been a long time since they’d really talked about anything that wasn’t overlaid with guilt and remorse, and at some point, the retread of those conversations got so tiring, they both just stopped talking. Listening to Tony and his driver, Steve couldn’t help a tinge of jealousy at their easy camaraderie, though it was the kind that simply coveted the same, not that wanted to take it away.
When the King finally did raise his eyes from his work, Steve felt the gaze like a sudden jolt that made his whole body stiffen and go rigid.  Heat wisped its way across his skin as the King’s eyes settled on Steve’s own, then slowly worked their way down Steve’s body in a leisurely sort of inspection.  The King leaned back in his chair and rubbed at his chin with one hand, then got up and walked over to the long table that ran along the wall of the room.  He opened a drawer, took something out and walked over to stand in front of Steve.   He bent down and placed a small, round marble jar in front of Steve, then went back to his seat and moved the books out of the way, pulling one of the larger sheets of parchment in front of him and going back to writing out long lines across the page.
“Hmmm,” Tony murmured under his breath, then made a chuffing noise.  “Well, I shall endeavor not to go to any great height, then.” Tony must have seen something on Steve’s face, because his eyes softened and he leaned forward until he had one hand braced on the bed next to Steve.  “Hey, Steve, it was just a dream. It isn’t real. I’m fine, as you can plainly see.”
“Hmmm,” Tony murmured, still scanning the pages. Dammit, Steve. Dammit all to hell. What were you thinking? Tony had thought about a prenup, though it had run in and out of his head somewhere around ring-coffee-yes-god-please-right-there. “Yeah. Maybe. Fuck, I don't know. Why?”
“You were the one broke my heart,” Tony reminded him, clearing his throat when the words came out rough and scraping instead of teasing.  “Rhodey insisted on ice cream, I had the urge to watch Bridget Jones, listen to ‘I Will Survive.” I don’t know.  Pretty sure there were manful tears happening.”
that you do.”  He looked up at Steve and slowly shook his head.  “You’ve no way of knowing how remarkable you are.  Perhaps it is better that way,” he said with a trace of resignation that he quickly wiped away behind a smile that didn’t reach his eyes.  “Yes, I am most generous.  We’ve already discussed that, I believe,” Tony murmured, teasing now, or trying to make the attempt.  “We discussed my generosity, I believe.
“Fine,” Steve replied.  “Oh, ah, speaking of reports.  You can stop monitoring Tony’s purchases. I don’t--Nat told me about the crickets,” he tried not to smile--a
“No.  No,” Tony repeated.  “Just an observation.  I just…can’t risk any loose ends.  Loose ends like upset boyfriends, who show up and make a scene in front of the shutterflies still camped out in the lobby pretending to be tourists.”
He could hear her now, down at the club, picking at a salad with the dressing on the side and two glasses into a bottle of wine to make up the calories, talking about how her son’s Alpha invested in artwork, something that will only increase in value, Alice, so smart, isn’t it?  And something they can enjoy together.  Oh, and he likes to show Anthony off.   Red.  I know, I know, it is a little scandalous, Alice, dear, but he just loves how it sets off Anthony’s skin.  I spent years trying to get that boy to take care of his complexion, but you know how it is, one word from his Alpha…
The elevator doors pinged and slid open.  Steve was standing in front of him wearing one of those damnable plaid shirts and khaki pant combination that made Tony want to put Prada on speed-dial, body poised in the motion of stepping into the elevator before realizing it was occupied, a flash of surprise arching across his features, then embarrassment, before he carefully schooled them.
“You took college classes?” Steve asked again, looking down at Tony.  “You said it was an online school.  I didn’t realize it was college classes.”
“Something could happen to him,” Tony said, banging his helmeted head against the glass lightly, so as not to break it further, because he knew, he really did know somewhere deep down, okay way deep down, that he had lost the plot entirely.
“With the taking care of me.  With the not shooting Clint.  With the not panicking and ordering solid rocket boosters,” Steve finished for him.  Oh yeah, that.  Damn, he really had done well, he thought proudly.  “You didn’t order solid rocket boosters, did you?”
-memory that clung to his mind each morning that he always failed to capture. He craved this moment, though. This in-between, before he fully woke, when he was sated and happy and everything seemed exactly as it should be in some unfathomable way.
“He’s rich,” Natasha said as she swirled her stick of olives around the edge of the martini glass before picking it up and pulling one off the end.  “Rich, smart, funny.  The whole package.”
“Huh?” Tony startled out of his reverie.  “Oh, ah.  Yeah, just some…ah.  It wasn’t anything really.  A few intro things, nothing—“
Steve swallowed past a suddenly dry throat, feeling something warm heat its way through his belly.  If Anthony said yes…if they Bonded…he blinked and wiped a hand over his brow. He didn’t need to be thinking about that. Not now.
“He’s good, Tony,” Rhodes said lowly, one hand cupping his chin.  A frown marred his face, though to Steve it looked more like confusion than concern for Tony.  “Real good.”
“Well.  You think about it, and just…just let me know,” Steve said a bit more easily, probably misinterpreting Tony’s smile for excitement about the observatory as opposed to pondering immensely powerful theoretical energy sources.  “I know you, ah.  You like the stars.  The telescope?  And all that about the astronauts.  You—you seem to know a lot about it.  Space and…all that.  What is it about astronomy that you like so much?”
Tony lifted Steve’s hips slightly, and there--oooh, Steve squeezed his eyes shut at the sudden burst of pleasure deep inside.  A breath of air punched out of him as his body rocked with the motion. His cock bobbed, twitching with interest, as Steve’s spend leaked down Tony’s stomach and thigh.  Sex and musk and sweat filled his nostrils in a heady combination. He breathed it in. Tasted the air on his tongue. Tony rutted between his legs, his thrusts growing harder, losing their finesse.  Steve’s body blazed, the coldness driven from him.
“I’m just saying, you get all Heathcliff on the moors about it sometimes, and I don’t know what to do then, so I just…I don’t know what to do.  Do I say something?  Leave you alone?  I told Coulson you were fine, but we all know that’s a lie.  Not that you’re ready for an I-Love-Myself jacket or anything.  I don’t—I’m not good at this, is what I’m saying, but I want to help,” Tony finished with a frustrated shrug.  He ran a hand through his hair, then up and down the back of his head before looking back at Steve.
“Alright, yes,” Tony nodded, shaking his head and tossing his hands in the air, “but, this is an idea that we already know will work! You need someone to share this Gift with, and as we figured out, I am, what did you call it? Compatible.”
“True,” Tony grinned. He patted Steve’s shoulder, then ran his hand up Steve’s neck, carding through his damp hair where it clung to his head.  “I am glad.  I do not know if I could bear to be without you for so long.”
Not his fault at all. Really. That seemed mostly, almost true, but when he closed his eyes, he could see Steve's hand shaking trying to get the key into the lock, a simple task that had become an accomplishment at some point.
If you liked this one, what is essentially this story in reverse can be found in one of my other fics, Gift With Purchase.  Thanks for reading!
Steve’s mouth twisted into a rueful grimace, and he rolled his eyes heavenward, but shrugged off the robe and allowed Cam to attach the chain around his waist.  The circles dripped down in a graduated triangle shape between the vee of his legs, leaving a good portion of his cock exposed.  His ass was entirely bare, save for a thin chain with a red jewel on the end that fell from the clasp around his waist to sit just above the crease.  He swallowed thickly and glanced over at the mirror, then sucked in a breath and looked back down at the bed.  A bright patch of gold caught his eye, and he reached down to pick it up, holding it in front of him with a frown.
“Sleep,” Tony muttered with a sigh.  Steve wasn’t sure if he was telling himself that or Steve, but it seemed to work for both of them.  He fell into a fitful sleep, dreamed of slipping into a dark, cold void of nothingness, and woke to light filtering in the windows feeling like he hadn’t truly slept at all.
“Tony,” Steve whispered, voice hoarse and raw, as he stood there, not quite returning Tony's embrace, but not exactly pushing him away, either. Steve let out a long, low breath, and his eyes dipped closed for a fraction of a second before focusing on Tony. “This isn't a good idea.”
“So,” Rogers repeated, sucking in a deep breath and squaring his shoulders.  “Um.  Right.  So, like I said, thank you for coming here today,” Rogers began, which had the ring of a practiced speech to it.  “I wanted to meet you and—and give you the chance to meet me before we…settled on anything permanent.  I know we don’t exactly have a lot of shared life experiences, but I thought it would be a good idea to see—to see if we’re…compatible.”
Shampoo?  Or would that seem vain?  He wouldn’t mind one of those razors with all the different trimmer heads.  He could try growing out some kind of beard again.  Every Alpha liked a well-groomed Omega, right?   But, then maybe Steve wouldn’t like facial hair.  Seemed a safer bet to get that online, where at least Steve wouldn’t feel like he’d been duped into inadvertently helping Tony if that was something he didn’t care for.  God, this sucked.  Write down what you want, Tony. Anything you want.  Just put it on the list.  What if he picked the wrong thing to ask for, though?  The list was a fucking minefield, he thought with a flash of annoyance.
“Romanov is going to be with him?  Well, that’s something,” Tony conceded reluctantly after a moment.  At least it was a familiar face, and someone he distrusted just slightly less than most everyone else.  “You going to tell him she’s there to do the dirty work or just wait until he figures that out?  How did keeping stuff from him work out the last go round?” Tony parroted Fury’s own words back to him.
“Some Hydra trick thing you saw back in the day?” Tony asked as they sprinted through the maintenance door and down the completely non-maintenance related corridor behind it.
“He kept watching you.  When you weren’t looking, he’d look over at you, and his face would do this thing,” Cam told him, making a terribly exaggerated expression of coquettish pining. “He said I was to take care of you for him.
Somewhere in the distance, a bird called out, and Steve jumped, letting out a small yelp.  The forest world was alive again, Steve thought, then frowned at the strangeness of the thought, though it was true, he had to admit.  He could hear the rustling of leaves as the wind blew, the trilling of crickets, and all the other night noises he would have called silence just a moment ago, though he knew better now.  Had the man scared them all away somehow?  But, what kind of man could make the wind cease its howling? Or make Steve not hear it?
“Casting aspersions on the character of your King is a capital offense. Probably,” Tony amended, canting his head to the side and gnawing on the bread.  “Besides, I spent a great deal of my unfortunate captivity talking to you, Brucie-bear.
Tony glanced again down at the roses, his mind instantly going to the little ink drawing that was leaning carefully against the dresser mirror back in their suite.   It had thrown him, that strangely romantic gesture.  Grand stunts, epic moments of showmanship, over-the-top gifts meant to substitute for whatever it was he didn’t want to deal with, that was what relationships were built on, not scraps of paper inked with a depth of emotion that Tony couldn’t quite name. Not yet, anyway.
It was heady, all this at once, making Steve feel a bit light-headed, like he had been spinning in place just a moment too long, but God, it was so good.  He hadn’t known it could feel like this in real life, but here he was, moaning like one of those guys in those videos Brock liked to watch.
“Now Steve, don’t get your panties all in a twist,” Brock began, holding his hands up in front of him in a placating gesture.
Then Clint was saying something about the lady from Marketing calling Tony about Steve’s poster.  For a moment, Steve was confused, thinking the message must have been about the sketches he’d done of Tony for the revised Iron Man poster and feeling himself blushing at the memory of what those sketches had inspired., but then he caught sight of Tony’s expression, which had gone from happily mocking Barton to something like he imagined one would look if you just swallowed a bug while simultaneously realizing that you were naked.  Clint looked a bit like the cat who ate the canary, which was also troubling.  Mentally replaying the conversation, Steve realized what Clint had been talking about.
“Don’t worry,” Matt said, standing up and starting to walk down the hallway as he tapped out a path in front of him.
He owed it to Tony.  That was what it came down to.  He couldn’t trade on Tony’s happiness, and that was what he had been doing.  Tony was gone. The universe was in ruins.
“Helpful of you to involve Rogers in all of this,” Obie continued, snapping Tony’s attention back into place.  Obie smiled flatly. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to explain your sudden demise. I mean, someone has to take the fall for this, and who better than a stripper you married out of nowhere?  It isn’t like anyone really cares about what happens to some stripper, is it? Convenient,” Obie continued nonchalantly, catching what must have been horrified panic in Tony’s eyes. “Oh, come on! It’s far too good of a story to pass up.  Sure, I had something else in mind,” he shrugged, “but what am I supposed to do when something like this falls into my lap? Tony Stark marries some Vegas stripper, who just
They stepped inside as the pod slowly rotated.  Eight large video monitors circled the top of the pod, though, thankfully, the usual video of trivia and Vegas highlights had been replaced with some kind of eighties technicolor light show set, somewhat incongruously, to a soft Elvis ballad Steve recognized, though couldn’t quite place. A small table draped in a white cloth and flanked by two red velvet-covered chairs sat near the far glass window, with an open bottle of champagne chilling in a tall silver stand next to it.  Domed silver dishes were waiting on the table, with a single, long-stemmed rose in a vase in the center.
After their match, Steve showered for the second time that day and changed into his usual khakis and the blue plaid shirt he thought Tony liked the best.   Or at least hated the least.  He’d decided while tossing Clint to the mat that he had to talk this thing out with Tony, if for no other reason than he couldn’t let Tony think he’d spent the night with someone when that wasn’t true.  Not if there was some possibility that was hurtful to Tony.  That would be cruel and selfish of him to let Tony think that just because he was afraid if he said something, it would turn out he was wrong and Tony would just offer to help set him up with someone.  He scrubbed a hand over his face and patted a non-existent wrinkle out of his shirt.  He realized he was taking more care with his appearance than he did preparing for battle, but found the comparison somehow oddly comforting.  If he could think of this as a mission with an objective and parameters of success, he would probably get through it a lot easier.
“I heard,” Fury replied, sounding vaguely uncomfortable, though, to be fair, that could be because 26 was tracking his movements rather intensely. “Fine. Well, I guess that’s my signal to go.”
“What do you need?  Take what you need, baby,” Steve asked, barely a whisper, but whip-crack loud in Tony’s head.  Yes.
He also remembered watching his father drink himself into a stupor when Challenger blew. Though, to be fair, by that point, Howard hadn’t needed much of an excuse for that.
Thanks again to everyone reading along!  Very much appreciate the comments and kudos. I'm not able to reply, but that doesn't mean that I don't do a twirly little happy dance with each one.
“Nnuh-uh-uh, can’t have that kind of attitude, now.  I had a nice talk with Lord Sitwell about you, and I think…I think you and I, we’re going to need to come to an understanding about how things work around here.  This,” Zola said, swinging an arm wide.  “Is…I’m sorry, what’s your name, boy?”
“Captain America is drooling on me,” Tony remarked, watching a long line of spittle make its way down Steve’s chin and onto the arm of the suit that was wrapped around Steve’s waist.  “’Naught that will last’?” Tony demanded.  “Captain America is drooling on me, and you’re telling me not to worry because this is going to wear off eventually?  Eventually, when, exactly?  How many Wiggles videos are we talking about having to watch here?”
on it.  He’d tell Steve, without being asked.  He thought Steve would like this.  That this might please Steve, and the idea of that, pleasing Steve, sent an involuntary jolt of warmth low in his belly, making it tighten with heat.
“Home,” JARVIS’ voice said.  The strange mental image of himself laying on the table, like a reflection, opened up across a panorama in his mind, then was gone.  “Heal. Home,” JARVIS’ voice repeated.
The first, a sleek, slate grey colored one barely fit over his shoulders. The second, a dark navy, worked better, so he settled on that, pairing it with one of the deep blue shirts that had been sent along with the suits. Apparently blue was the new neutral, he thought as he buttoned up the shirt that seemed the best fit, though it was still a bit tight. He couldn’t help run a hand over the material, which had a slight sheen to it. None of the items had a price tag on them, which he assumed meant that if you had to ask, you probably couldn’t afford it.
“Seriously?  You’re really okay with this?” Tony asked. “I’ve been told I get annoying after a while, fair warning. I talk a lot.  A
The alien canted his head to the side. The furrow was back on his brow as he regarded Tony.  Then, to Tony’s surprise, the not-gel covered him again and lowered his legs back to the table.  The alien shuffled off the end of the table and went around to one of the screens on the side. He spent long minutes tapping away at it, then finally, seemingly satisfied, he nodded at Tony.  Tony stared at him, suddenly unsure and oddly...distressed. Upset and...frustrated.
“So,” Steve repeated after a moment, turning around to face Tony. He looked haggard and more rumpled than Steve was used to seeing him. Steve’s eyes narrowed, taking in Tony’s appearance, and he felt a wave of exhaustion that he wasn’t sure was entirely his own. They were all tired. He was their leader, or supposed to be, and here he was, wallowing in his own guilt and… and whatever this was he needed to do sometimes.
“So, there’s this little place a few blocks from here, makes a great cappuccino,” Steve suggested.  “Oh, hang on, I’ve got to call my friend,” he said quickly, pulling his phone out of his pocket and dialing Bucky’s number.  It rang once, then again.  Steve frowned over at Tony.  “It’s ringing.”
“I never really felt ashamed of what I was doing,” Steve told him with a slight grimace.  “I wasn’t proud, but…I wasn’t ashamed of it, you know? I’ve killed people because the guy in my ear told me they were the bad guys, so this—I mean, yeah, I hear my Catholic grandmother in my ear sometimes, but—I was handling it.  I was a little embarrassed, sure. But, not ashamed. Not exactly, not—not until…and now, there’s these videos, and,” he stopped, shaking his head and pinching the bridge of his nose, letting out a long breath through his nose. “People are going to look at those and laugh and—they’ll know, you know?  They’ll know what I was willing to do for money. They’ll look at me, and that’s what they’ll see. Just some—somebody, some guy who takes his clothes off for money, and it’s like, when they do that, it’s like I’m not even a real person or something. I—I just—I don’t know what to do with that.”
“Really, it’s—it’s late, and.  You can’t even really—it’s not—it’s not clear, with the lights, so you can’t—you can’t see much from here.  So,” Tony said, stumbling over the words like his mouth had marbles in it.
Tony drew back, pulling his cock all the way out, so only the tip caught on the rim of Steve’s hole, and Steve was
“God, you can’t be real,” Tony muttered.  He had one hand over his face, but dropped it to his side and looked down when Steve.  “We’re doing this.  Jesus. Fuck. We’re doing this.  Please don’t let me—“
“We are doing neither of those, because we are not nineteen, but rather, mature men, who are over that kind of---you know, a high-five would not be out of order,” Tony responded with a wide smile.  Rhodey raised his palm in the air, and Tony slapped it, feeling stupid and giddy and happy all at the same time.  “He quit his job.  We’re dating.  We had dinner last night…this great dinner—thanks, Pep—and we talked about, God, I don’t know. Everything.  Us.  Our relationship.  What we wanted.  Sex.  I think Steve needs some sex.  Like, a lot of sex, probably.  But, slow, no pressure, you know?   I need to research.  I don’t want to—to have it happen too fast or make it a big thing, but then this morning, we were joking, and maybe it isn’t a big thing, and I’m making it a big thing.  Am I making it a big thing?  Shit.  I haven’t been this nervous since, well.  Since the first time, I guess.  Though, that was mostly just because I understood basic principles of volume and capacity.”
“My mother used to tell me that her people used to worship the Great Spider, back before the faith came for her people’s lands.  Our world sat in her web, they said. She would weave certain souls together,” Steve said. “I always liked that story,” he added, pausing for a moment, then wrapped his hands around Tony’s where they gripped his and cleared his throat. “I love you, Tony. More than...more than I ever thought possible, too.  I will…” he began, swallowing thickly and looking down at Tony. He started again, his voice strong and sure this time. “I will love you with all of my being, forsaking all others. My hearth shall be your hearth. My table shall be your table. The children of your name shall be the children of my name. I bind myself to you, in this life and the next. So, as I say, it is done,” Steve finished, watching Tony visibly relax, his eyes growing bright and watery.
Relief flooded through him, loosening his chest and letting air fill it again.  Had he been holding his breath?  He didn’t remember doing it.  Tony raised his eyes to Steve’s and let out a shaky breath.  It was okay. Steve was here.
“It’s, I mean, I know I have a type of, and you’re pulling things from my head that I, ah...yeah, nevermind,” Tony stammered as the alien watched him curiously.  “You’re really going to need to warn me when we’re doing this whole mental thing, by the way. It’s kind of freaking me out,” Tony asked, rubbing at his forehead.
“He said he didn’t remember much of anything.  Someone drugged him at the conference two weeks ago, something new that Friday didn’t catch.  We think it was on a watch that was delivered.  The delivery man was also found unconscious when his van hit a parked car a few miles away.  Anyway, that’s the last thing he remembers. He woke up here,” she shrugged.
“How do you,” Kirk started, shaking his hand in front of him and mirroring the action with his head.  “Word so little?  Ugh.  No wonder you’re wound up so tight you could Cameron Frye a piece of coal.  So. Tell me about this art therapy thing.”
He would go wherever Steve went, of course, but that was different. Steve was Alpha. And Steve was...Steve. Steve was everything. He blinked up at Steve. He remembered Steve standing between him and Tyber and the other Clan men. He remembered the carved lion. He remembered that Steve loved the things Tony made, like his spear-thrower and his trapes. He remembered Pleasures. He remembered the roar Steve let out when he charged at the man who called Tony an abomination. He remembered that Steve said he was good.
Tony was uncharacteristically quiet in the elevator ride down. Steve found himself casting furtive glances Tony’s way or watching their flattened, hazy reflections in the elevator doors.
“You like the Jetsons, so I’ll go with them,” Steve said, bringing Tony up short for a second.  Steve remembered that stupid little detail.  It was…unexpected.  The way Steve paid attention to him, like Tony mattered.  Like even the stupid stuff about him, the stuff that made him ridiculous or different, mattered to Steve.  It probably shouldn’t make him feel so good, Steve’s approval.  Probably shouldn’t make a difference. But it did.  Vindication, Tony supposed.
Steve held the phone away from his ear, startled.  “Um, hi Ms. Romanov.  Um, I wanted to talk to you.  About last night,” Steve ventured.
“I have nothing to wear,” he muttered to the full closet.  Blue.  His mom said blue.  So, clearly, that was out, he thought, reaching for a pair of tan slacks and a cream button-up shirt.  He did settle on a blue striped tie, though, if only because it was all he could find, stuck down in the back of his sock drawer.  The silk was wrinkled, so he laid it on his dresser and put a few books on top of it in the hope that gravity and pressure would work.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll cut out the matchmaking, but you can’t blame me.  Look around.  Stark’s a good look on you, Steve, you have to admit,” Bucky pointed out.  “This could be something good, that’s all I’m saying.”
The tree was huge.  That was his first thought.  Not as big as the one Tony put in the Tower and decorated with the most garish ornaments of all of them he could find, but big.  It stood in front of a large, bowed window and star on top nearly reached the high ceiling.  Colorful lights twinkled from boughs laden with ornaments.  Packages were stacked underneath, wrapped in festive papers.
seem to recall that he got a reaction out of you like pretty much no one ever,” Bucky replied. “You wouldn’t shut up about the entitled, obnoxious poser who came to play soldier for a day and had the unmitigated gall to hit on you while simultaneously insulting you.  Got you all riled up.  I should’ve known right then it was true love.”
The jet slowed as they approached the Tower, shimmying a bit as the wind flaps went up.  Steve didn’t care for that very much, and started to make a long, nasally wailing sound.  “Hey, hey, you’re fine,” Tony murmured, patting a metal hand against Steve’s back.  “Just landing.  It’s fun, see?  Wheeee!”  The cry cut off abruptly at that, leaving Steve staring up at him, eyes wide.  “You like that, huh?  Wheeeee!” Tony repeated, garnering a smile from Steve that lasted until they hit the landing pad with a jolt, which Steve really didn’t like.  “Okay, okay, all done.  See?  Not so bad.  Steve thinks your landing skills need improvement,” Tony said to Clint as the other man unbuckled and got out of the pilot’s seat.  Steve’s hiccupping cry seemed to affirm that observation.
There.  He said it.  He felt relief loosen the invisible band around his chest that he hadn’t even known was there.  Shellhead’s shocked face pivoted towards Steve, his mouth opening, then closing a few times in some kind of pantomime of trying to figure out what to say.  He finally managed a burst of wet, chirping noises that Steve took for some kind of effort at protest.
Steve blinked and shook his head in wonder.  An action figure.  That was what they called them now when they were for boys.  Action figures.  This one was ridiculously muscled, wearing the bright red, white and blue, legs and arms splayed wide, like he was girding for a fight, with a small, plastic shield molded to one hand.
“Yeah, I’m sure.  You go ahead. I’ll come find you in a bit,” Steve promised.  Tony regarded him for a long moment, then nodded and gave Steve’s hand a light squeeze.
“God, right? That was--he had to be kidding, right?” Brock stammered, walking over to where Steve stood near the railing.  “Some weird rich-guy joke or something.” He laughed, but it didn’t sound quite right. “Rich people are fucked up, right?  I mean, who knows what goes through a guy like that’s head?”
“Yeah, yeah, got it, thanks, J,” Tony cut in brusquely. He reached up, fingers hovering over one of the buttons on the communications panel for a moment.  “Going dark.”
, he could come up with a fantastic evening that seemed like it had been tailor made just for Steve. Maybe it had been, Steve realized with a slight start as he recalled Tony looking through his phone and all the searches he had done on there about things to do in Vegas.
“You get in that car and every night, it just takes more and more out of you.  I see it happening and God-dammit if I know what to do about it.  You’re about as stubborn as they come, Rogers, when you get something in your head.  But I know you.  And I know what this is doing to you.  You can say you’re happy all you want, but this isn’t happy.  This is you trying not to fall apart and calling it happy because calling it what it is would destroy you.  I see the way you stare at that phone, waiting for it to ring.  You have no idea what your face looks like when that buzzer rings and his car pulls up.  You’re in so far over your head it isn’t funny.  And the only way this ends is for you to get chewed up and spit out.  So…so just don’t go.  I know the money is great, and you’re helping your mom and that’s fantastic, it is, but she’d never want you doing this, Steve.  Never.  Hell, she’d kick my ass for letting you.  I said we’d find another way, and we will.  Just…just stop this…this
“My—my file?” Steve asked, frown deepening.  He sat up, body coiling tight, going rigid.  “That’s—there’s nothing, I mean, it’s just the same—”
Tony. How could he possibly do that to Tony?  Tony, who only asked this one thing of Steve. This one thing.  The only thing Steve didn’t think he could give him. Sometimes, he wished he could be that person, the one who could, the one who would love Tony, as Tony loved, completely and without reservation.
“Hard to top the image of Steve sleeping on Barnes’ couch with a giant bear, sorry Tones, gotta give Barnes that one,” Rhodey acknowledged.  “Okay, so both the idiots are giant, sentimental saps.”
“Pepper’s sending over a few things to keep you occupied. Nothing fancy, but, you know, enjoy. Whatever,” Tony said with a flat grimace.
“Don’t tell me Stark was terrible in bed because I’m gonna die laughing if that’s the case,” Brock said, making Steve wince a bit.  “Figures some rich prick like that probably pays a PR firm to spread stories about him or some shit.”
Tony offered him a wan smile, but he wasn’t going to lie, the reassurance, hollow though it may be, felt good.  This thing with Steve had the disconcerting feeling of being both a slow march towards something predestined and an infinitely fragile moment of sheer happenstance where one wrong move would destroy everything.  He didn’t want to lose Steve, but more than that, he didn’t want to
Bucky sighed and pursed his lips, glancing away for a moment before looking back at Steve.  “You’re boyfriend’s a dick.”
“Okay, then.  I know how you can be about this kind of thing, so I’m not going to waste my breath trying to change your mind, but I mean the second, Steve--”
Tony looked again at the closed door, the color coded letters on the wall next it a rainbow equivalent of ‘we don’t know what the fuck we’re dealing with.’  None of that explained why his first reaction to hearing Steve had lost his memories was so damn selfish.  Why did he care if Cap remembered their little trysts?   They hadn’t meant anything.  That much was clear enough, even for someone as emotionally blind as Tony to see.  Hell, they barely even liked each other most of the time, always waiting for something to set one or the other off, and usually managing to find it.  That wasn’t entirely fair, he knew, but it felt like something that should be true, too familiar and expected to simply let go of just because…just because sometimes Steve made him laugh out loud until he lost his breath and sometimes he looked at a problem in a way Tony hadn’t considered, not that he would admit that, but still.  He rubbed metal fingers lightly over his scalp, massaging absently at his temples.  It didn’t matter, anyway. They were done.  Now, more so than ever, he supposed.  The least he could do was help Steve deal with this crap as best he could.  He owed him that much.
Based on a prompt from a Tumblr Anon, it's 2am and Tony drunk dials his ex.  He gets Captain America instead.
Tentatively, Steve reached up and brushed his hand across his chest, then over one side of his face.  That was nice, he thought. He didn’t often touch himself like that. No one did, except Tony. Back home, if anyone was touching him like that, it was probably to patch up some wound, or when he was younger, his mother applying some bitter-smelling poultice.  Not just to touch to feel good.
“Think of me, and how it will feel to be back in my bed tonight.   You’ll come on my cock again tonight, I think.  I liked watching you.  Feeling you as you did,” the King continued, stroking his thumb along the slit at the head of Steve’s cock as he did.  Steve did groan then, half surrender, half plea, and leaned closer, until he could feel the brush of Tony’s lips on his cheek when he spoke. “You’ll be so beautiful, riding me, chasing your pleasure until you’re desperate with it.  Think of that, while you’re missing me.  Don’t touch yourself, though,” the King warned, dropping his other hand down to circle Steve’s cock.  Steve bit his lip to stifle a groan, but couldn’t stop his hips from juddering forward, seeking the warm friction of Tony’s hand.  “This is mine.
He was weak, hesitating like this, being selfish. He knew it, it was just...hard sometimes, not to beg Tony to just--just what? Trust him? Like him?  Give him a chance?
“Good! That’s wonderful to hear.  I know it is a big step, and I’m not suggesting jumping in right away, of course,” she rushed out.  “Just think about it, is all I’m asking.  I’ve taken the liberty of having a few files put together for you to consider.  Agent Coulson was kind enough to help,” she demurred.  Steve wondered briefly, almost hysterically, what kind of form Coulson had for that, though he said nothing, just stared at the stack of folders on the doctor’s desk when her eyes fell on it.  “When you have time, look them over.  Perhaps a few will catch your eye?  They are all very beautiful, of course.  Well educated by the finest finishing schools or private tutors.  I think you’ll find several who share your passion for the arts, even.  Omegas are so accomplished these days.  They paint, they play music, cook these fantastic meals, know all the latest trends.  Why, a friend of mine’s son can throw a party together in no ti—“
“Tony.  Wait,” Steve said quickly as Tony moved to get out of the bath, sending water sloshing over the side as he did.  He reached out and grabbed Tony’s arm, holding him there, though his touch was light.  Finally, Tony turned back to look at him, something like trepidation lining his face with a worry that shouldn’t be there.
“You don’t regret it, do you, Shellhead?” Steve asked with a sort of breathless nervousness at the sudden thought.  “Is that why you…I—I mean, you’d have said if you didn’t want to, right? Did I…did I do something wrong or—”
Steve was pounding into him, mercilessly, grunting with the effort, the slap of his balls against Tony’s skin punctuating his grunts.  It wouldn’t be long now, Tony had time to think, and then he felt Steve’s thrusts stutter, and he gave a shout above Tony, then rammed into him again, deep and hard, gripping Tony’s hips where there would be long, blue bruises tomorrow morning. Tony felt a warm shot of cum fill him, felt Steve’s hips judder, jerking in rapid, short thrusts as he chased his orgasm.  More and more cum filled him.  Tony could feel a trickle of it leak out around Steve’s cock, and then Steve let out a long, husked-out groan, thrust deep one more time, then collapsed on Tony, managing to brace his fall with one hand, though it still forced the air out of Tony’s chest in a short, startled gasp.
,” Steve replied with a grin. “You had to talk to a counselor, big deal.  Another rules violation and you’d have gotten in real trouble.”
“Wasn’t doubting you, Shellhead, just impressed,” he added as he went back to rowing.  He felt the boat rock as Shellhead let go and saw him gliding along beside it, occasionally darting underneath or disappearing for some time, though never long.  When the island was a speck in the distance, Shellhead popped up and bent over the side of the boat, pointing at the mast.
He had dreamed.  One of the dreams that often visited him in a long night in an unfamiliar place.  The one where he could hear Tony crying, down in the dungeons, but he couldn’t find him, no matter how long he searched.  He could only hear him and do nothing.  It was always the same dream.  It had been the same dream since they were children.  Tony crying while Steve searched, on and on, running down tunnels with no end.  Tony’s whispers echoing out to him.   Calling to him as he grew more and more frantic, more and more certain he had taken a wrong turn.  Make some kind of horrible mistake.  He had promised, after all. He could still hear it, if he closed his eyes, even as the dream seemed to have already faded.
Okay, that was enough of that.  The doctors had said not to get the wound wet and Steve usually followed their orders, either out of respect or habit, but Steve wanted a shower more than he’d wanted much of anything in his life.  Though he’d tried to clean himself up as much as possible back at SHIELD, the grit and grime and stench of battle still clung to him.  He could handle that.  He was a soldier. Not like he’d never fallen asleep with the stink of the fight still sharp in the air.  In an odd way, it was almost soothing even.  The ozone, ash and metallic ting of blood provided certainty that you were alive.  Best post-battle lullaby there was, as far as Steve was concerned.
Shame, deep, gut-wrenching shame washed over Steve.  He swallowed and started to get up, but Tony’s hands came up to cup his head, tilting his neck back so Steve’s vision contained nothing but Tony.  There was a manic desperation ghosting behind Tony’s eyes, some kind of determination solidifying there that Steve couldn’t read.  Then Tony’s mouth was on his and his lips parted immediately, allowing Tony’s tongue entrance.  Tony swirled his tongue around, tracing the lines of Steve’s mouth, darting in and out, frenzied and wild.  Tony moved his hands to unbutton Steve’s shirt and push it off his shoulders, hand roaming over Steve’s frame as he did.  Tony kept his mouth pressed to Steve’s, beard scraping along Steve’s jaw, as his hands pressed Steve back and down against the bed.  Tony made short work of Steve’s fly, and Steve lifted his hips to help Tony pull his pants the rest of the way off.  He knew he should stop this.  Bucky had been right.  Tony had been playing a game and no one had told Steve the rules.  No, that wasn’t fair.  Steve had decided to ignore the rules.  Now, it was all laid bare.  Tony wanted this part of him, but nothing more.  He should have enough dignity to get up and walk out, but instead his hands came up to wrap around Tony’s shoulders and wind up through his hair, pulling Tony’s length along his body, letting their limbs entwine.
Was he really going to turn his back on Tony because he was embarrassed?  Brain damage. Bruce had said brain damage was possible, and here, Steve was contemplating leaving Tony to that possibility, all because he was, what, uncomfortable? Because Tony fantasized about him.  Not like he hadn’t had his own thoughts in this direction regarding Tony.  Not quite this…creative, but still.  He could hardly condemn Tony for it.
“Would you go see that?” Stane asked, looking down at Tony.  “Or is that, as you kids say these days, ‘
“About the wind,” Steve explained.  “Ever walked past the Flatiron when the wind’s really blowing?  Twenty-three skidoo.  Mom said that’s where it comes from.  Guys used to hang around there on 23
Steve looked at Bucky in confusion.  Bucky just shrugged.  “Yoga instructor,” he said, as if that was some sort of explanation.
He woke, again, to light.  Familiar light, this time. The soft, pinkish glow filled the room. He sucked in a sharp breath that felt oddly deep and good as a tide of memories hit him.  He blinked, then immediately shoved some kind of weird blanket that had been placed on top of him off and grasped at his belly and looked down in shock. It was flat again, thank God. He must have...absorded the...whatever they were.  He wasn't sure if it was relief he felt, but he'd take it. His hands and eyes trailed up his chest, and he felt an instant of panic, drawing in another, harsh breath with a cry of alarm in it, his mouth dropping open in a gasp.
“She’s not wrong!” Bucky shouted back at him as Nat brushed past him and headed out the door.  He grinned at Steve and shoved a piece of toast in his mouth, then shut the door behind them.
“No,” Steve said. “No, not that.  I was…frustrated with you, but…” he trailed off with a frown, recalling the night and walking back to his cell at Zola’s only to find a cold bath waiting for him.
“No,” Steve replied.  “I didn’t.  I still—I don’t.” He rubbed a hand over his mouth and flattened it into a thin line, side-eyeing Tony before going back to looking out the window.
“You never tease back,” Tony mumbled, letting out a huff of air that sounded more chagrined than pained.
“That…sounds about right,” Steve replied in a low murmur, looking down at the folders in his lap with a frown. He opened the first one.  A blonde woman with long hair and pale skin smattered with freckles dressed in a soft, blue skirt and smocked top that bared her shoulders smiled back at him. She was standing next to a dining table set with fine china, seemingly caught in the act of arranging a vase of flowers.  Emma, her file said.  Loves to garden, cook, knit and sing, and looks forward to being able to care for a mate of her own.  She volunteers in her church’s nursery on the weekends, under appropriate supervision, of course.  Steve closed the file, and looked back up at the therapist.
“SI needs to diversify.  We’re too dependent on wars, which, okay, sure human history being something of a benchmark, not a terrible strategy, but we should at least be looking at other technologies,” Tony pointed out.  “Look at Apple.  It stopped innovating—or, rather, it stopped buying companies that were innovating—and now they’re blowing through market share like Cartman through his bag of cheesy poofs.”
He was being maudlin, he knew, though felt somewhat entitled at this point.  He’d been the perfect gentleman all day.  Hell, he’d even given a toast.
“Not hungry.  I ate one before I patched you up.  You were still out from the trip up here,” Steve replied, the lie falling easily from his lips.  He wasn’t hungry, that much was true.  That should probably concern him, since he was usually in some kind of suspended state of hunger nearly all the time, but it was hard to muster the energy to care.  To be fair, that could also pose some kind of concern.
“MIT.  A pilot program. Just for me.  Isn’t that great?” Tony rasped out around a shuddering gulp of air.  He picked at nonexistent lint on the leg of his jeans and looked up at the image on the television screen, where his shadow self held the phone to his ear and kept shifting on the sofa in fitful, jerky movements.
“Great.  Great.  I’m great,” Tony spluttered.  “It’s just a bit like deciding to take up mountain-climbing and suddenly finding yourself clinging to the side of Everest with half an oxygen tank and no Sherpa.”
Steve stood up from the bed, turned away from Tony and began methodically stripping off his uniform, boots first, then the leather tunic and belt, followed by the undershirt and finally unlacing his breeches and pushing them off. He could feel the firm weight of Tony’s gaze on him as he did, watching everything with the same intensity of focus he got when he was down in his workshop, mixing his metals and potions, lost in what he was doing. As he straightened, he couldn’t help but wince at the sudden bite of pain that striped across his back. He didn’t try to hide it, not this time. He had sworn, and Tony asked this of him, so he would give it, all of it, all of him, because Tony had promised.
Tony paused for a moment, then, when he couldn’t think of anything else to say and couldn’t figure out why he wanted to say anything else, gave up and walked down the hall, leaving Steve to his post-midnight snack.  He stopped in the bathroom, then headed to his room, though he stopped short on the threshold and glanced back down the hallway.  Steve was sitting at the table, arms cradling the container of food with the fork was standing on end, stuck into the risotto.  He was staring at the tabletop and seeing nothing, or seeing too much, Tony wasn’t sure which.
“I’ll stand,” Tony said, watching Steve straighten in place, like the sudden flurry of easy motion that had been sustaining him had been turned off.  He looked over at Tony, finally, really looked.  Whatever surprise or maybe embarrassment that had sparked the initial cordiality seeming to leak out of him.  Tony could practically hear Steve’s teeth grinding together from where he stood.
“Not him.  Just you.  He stays,” the King interrupted.  Steve glanced over at him in shocked surprise.  Zola let go of Steve’s collar and looked back and forth between Steve and the King, before an insipid smile split his features.
“I know,” Steve said, the words dragged out from some deep well in the pit of his stomach.  He kept his gaze down at the table where his favorite foods melted in the afternoon sun.  He couldn’t bring himself to look at Tony.  It hurt far too much, this stabbing, insistent pain where his heart was said to be.  “I’m sorry, Tony.  I don’t mean to—to make you feel that way.”
!  How could Zola possibly think I would ever--” he cut off and looked away at the fire for a long span of heartbeats, then back at Steve, a frown darkening his features.  “I never called again for a concubine he sent.  Once the night was past, I cared not.  He would have assumed you were the same.  He would have no reason to think you were different.  That
Tony headed for the kitchen, mostly for something to do and excuse if he was caught.  Not that there was anything wrong with being up.  Just that wandering around the house in the hopes his cock would soften was not going to be his go-to reasoning, should he be discovered.  Someone, meaning Steve, had put Tony’s popcorn bowl into the dishwasher, he saw, as he pulled his mug out of the top rack and filled it with water, which turned out to be lukewarm and vaguely mineral tasting.
“You don’t even know me,” Tony protested, his mouth twisting and flattening.  “Ask anyone. I am not that guy.”
“The two in the middle, you could use for hockey pucks,” Rhodey replied.  “I think I heard one of the ones on the edges moo.”
Steve spent most of the ride back to SHIELD staring out the car’s window while Allen chattered on about interest rates and something to do with points.  Steve had money now.  More than he ever imagined having, that was for sure.  Back pay. Hostile Fire pay.  Per diems.  And, apparently, the Army had decided that his time in the ice qualified as some kind of prisoner of war status, which meant he progressed in rank the whole time.  Seventy years of promotions without doing a damn thing.  Must be the US military, Steve thought with a sigh, though said nothing as Allen droned on about the closing.  Technically, that gave him the pay of modern-day four-star general, though, as he’d told Coulson, he was a bit attached to the moniker of Captain, whatever his pay stub might say.
“James B. Barnes, also of Brooklyn, New York, a year older than your ball and chain.  Enlisted out of high school.  Sniper, mostly, it looks like. Made Sergeant pretty fast.  Not like your golden boy, but record’s good, clean.  Impressive confirmed kills,” Rhodey said. Tony could hear the forced nonchalance in his voice.  Great.
Bread arrived, and the sommelier returned with the wine.  He poured a tasting sip into Stark’s glass, got a dour look, and filled it generously before pouring some for Steve.
Steve hesitated only slightly at the bridge.  Though chunks were missing from underneath, up close now, he could see that repairs had been made in the form of iron bars that criss-crossed through the rock at all manner of angles. What he had thought were merely pillars along the bridge actually held the remains of six statues that stood sentinel that along the bridge in various states of damage.
Tony.  Tony, always Tony, but God help him, thinking about Tony was so much better than thinking about everything else.  Tony ordered crickets.  A
Alright. He could do this, Steve told himself.  First things first, he needed Tony to focus on him, not the fantasy.  That seemed like a decent first step, anyway.  And the easiest way to get Tony’s attention was, well…okay, well, so, he wasn’t going to do it quite the
“Yeah.  Deal,” Steve said, with a quick, shy smile before he looked away.   “Think I’m getting the better end of this deal, but yeah.”
Tony grinned. “Dinosaurs.  For me.  It was dinosaurs.  Loved them. I was obsessed. I tell the press it was robots, because that’s a better soundbite, but triceratops?  The best. They made these Dino-Rider toys when I was a kid.  Kind of militarized, trained dinosaur things.  I was
“Thanks,” Steve said drolly. “They took my shield. I want it back,” Steve mumbled, sounding adorably petulant about the whole thing. Tony clucked sympathetically.
Rhodes gave Tony a wry, disapproving look, but strode onto the mat with nothing of Tony’s brashness, just a steely calm that Steve recognized.  Steve watched Rhodes approach with a new wariness.  He had a good bit of muscle on the smaller man, true enough, but Rhodes was a knight, and not one for show, but one who had seen true battle. Rhodes was fresh, and Steve had just spent the better part of the hour grappling with Tony.  There was sweat dripping in his eyes, and his breathing was shallow from the exertion, but he could feel the familiar steadiness come over him as Rhodes walked towards him.
The man smiled again, a flash of white teeth this time, and Steve’s heart clenched at...something, and he thought, maybe he should leave.  Maybe this wasn’t right, after all, though he couldn’t quite figure out
“That’s not his name,” Tony muttered, pulling back and giving Steve a reproachful look, which just made his Alpha grin all the wider.
“Go on,” Tony urged.  “It’s fine.  I’ll be fine.  Go.  Get tuda choppa!  Sorry, sorry, that was terrible. But, really, when do you get a chance to use that quote?  Like, never.  Unless you’re you.  Or Bonded to you.  Seriously, you shouldn’t let me leave the cabin, you know?”
Sometimes, when he didn’t have the words, Anto would tell Steve things in the Clan language, and Steve would watch him so intently, it was almost disconcerting.  Sometimes, Anto would notice that Steve had need, but he ignored it, as best he could. It stung, true, but Steve was a good man, and he couldn’t help that Anto was a big, ugly Omega who no one wanted, except Tyber, and only then because he hated Anto and knew Anto didn’t like it.  Now, though, he could just let it happen. He could close his eyes think of Steve and his words and the way he smiled. His easy acquiescence and lack of reaction seemed to enrage Tyber all the more, but Anto didn’t let it matter. Not anymore. He would leave one of these days, go to some place where people were kind, like Steve, even if he was big and ugly and slow-minded.  They would teach him more words, and maybe, he could build things like the canoes joined together that Steve said would work, as if Anto didn’t know it would work.
Tony swallowed and looked down at his feet, then back over to the cabinet, where the award for best tomatoes shone in the light.
had ever seen.  He reached up and tapped at the cage, fascinated.  The little, golden owl raised its metal head, opened its mechanical beak and made the sound again.  As it did, Steve could see the insides of its chest whir and patter, and its wings clicked outward, then tucked themselves back into its chest.
“I asked Pepper to arrange to have a pair of those brightly colored ones that speak brought to the menagerie.  He’ll like that, I think,” Tony said.
“It would likely just induce nausea,” Jarvis protested, shaking his head.  “Speaking of your Alpha, I was under the impression Captain Rogers would be joining us?”  There was a question under that question, but Tony ignored it.
Steve’s mind stuttered to a halt at the image, his heart pounding, his cock throbbing in echo.  His chest burned cold.
By the time they made it outside, Happy had the car waiting with the door open for them, and Steve ducked into the backseat after Tony.
“I don’t care about the money,” Steve interjected.  “Okay, I mean, yes, I care about what we agreed to, only because I have…there’s a thing I’ve been saving for, and that’s—that was the goal, yes,” Steve rambled on, noting Tony sort of winced at that, though he didn’t make any comment about the seven grand this time, as he usually did, so that was something.  “But, that’s not what this is about.  If you want me to sign something or whatever, I’ll do it.  All this, I mean, yeah, sure, it’s great.  Not going to lie.  All this stuff…it’s nice. Pretty sure Bucky’s going to clean out the towel rack, by the way. But, your money is probably the least interesting thing about you.  And it’s definitely not required, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
Steve mentally replayed the dinner conversation again as the movie flickered through a space battle.  It would have been impressive if he wasn’t so distracted by Tony and their conversation.  Their respective ages.  He had almost flubbed his answer, then caught himself.  He was, as he told Tony, twenty-five. By one count, anyway.  He felt older.  A
“I’m sorry that I try to…if I made you feel like you weren’t doing something right or if I made you, I don’t know, uncomfortable or—I mean, I—“ Tony stammered, looking up at Jarvis.
Steve grimaced flatly.  He bent over and cradled his head in his hands, scraping his fingers through his hair.  Was he really happier now than he was before he met Brock?  For so long, he had been so wound up with trying to do the right thing, say the right thing, be what Brock wanted, and it was never quite enough, just tantalizingly close enough that he kept thinking, if he just could… be better, then Brock would love him, he would be worthy of that, and he would finally be truly happy.
Steve walked over to the bed and stared at it for a moment.  He could refuse to do this.  He gripped one of the bedposts and held on, swaying a little.  The image of Tony in the garden came unbidden to Steve’s mind.  Tony, looking every bit the King he was.  Formidable.  That was the word for it, Steve thought with a slight shiver.  Powerful and full of vengeful anger on Steve’s behalf, standing like an impervious wall between Steve and those people.
Peace—true peace—could not exist without justice, that much Steve knew. Anything else was an illusion to protect the powerful. The Jerak’ho was part of that protection. It would split walls and fell enemies, yes, but it would also perpetuate a system that kept untold numbers under the yoke of slavery, and it was impossible to both wish for Tony’s success and despise the system that allowed it.
Steve looked up at him from where he sat in front of the fire, scraping a whetstone across his sword. When he dipped it in the bowl of water next to his feet, it came away dripping a dark brown that painted his sword in long rivulets that almost looked like veins.   He looked at Tony curiously for a moment, then dipped his head back to his task.  Tony flopped back against the pillows on the massive bed that took up one wall of the room and picking at the soft furs that covered it.
“I don’t know what you mean,” Maria rushed out.  “There’s nothing—this hasn’t happened before, of course not!  What are you suggesting?  Jarvis.  Jarvis, you tell her.”
“Greetings, Omega Tony, and Companion Dummy,” Tor said, a wide smile splitting his features. He elbowed Steve, pointed at Tony, and made an encouraging sound.
.  I’ve spent the past ten years doing what I thought was right to make things better.  Better weapons for our soldiers.  The scholarships.  Working for Omega rights.  Being an example.  None of that mattered.  None of it made a bit of difference out there.  To those soldiers in the Hum-vee.  We were—God, we were taking selfies and then my stuff,
“Look, I tried to make up for the whole stripper pole on the jet thing with being a completely awesome wingman and buying you a lap dance with Mr. American Pie, and now you’re in like and having feelings, and I get that’s freaking you out, but there’s no reason to call me out like that.  Besides, Ferris, if I’m anyone, I’m the hot sister who can’t get away with shit and tries to get you to behave, but ultimately hates The Man more,” Rhodey protested, giving Tony a firm nod.
“You used to boil me potatoes. At the cabin,” Tony said in a thin, breathy voice.  He squeezed his eyes shut.  He could feel heat fan out over his skin in a prickling sensation.  Long, slow strokes of Steve’s hand, the softly grating catch of paper-thin skin on skin.  A puff of breath punched out through his nose, and he looked down between them again.  Small, white beads of fluid dotted the slick-soaked skin of cocks and Steve’s hand.  He wasn’t sure if it was his or Steve’s or both.
This is what you saw, Tony thought, biting the inside of his cheek. This is why Vegas.  He caught Pepper watching him, and quickly turned back to the snake-oil guy.
It began as simply trying to get Tony to relieve himself of some of the burden of rule, getting him to talk about the issues he was dealing with, and Steve did love to watch Tony’s mind work a problem, like some great machine come to life. It started that way, or he thought it had.  Looking back, he wasn’t sure how much had been Tony’s well-intentioned manipulation and how much had been simple happenstance, but their evenings quickly became far more of an exchange than Steve had ever intended.  Tony could see so much, how it would all fit together, but in doing so, he sometimes missed the pieces themselves, and that was where Steve slowly found himself offering a few suggestions until their nightly dinner sessions were as much strategy and possibility as anything else.

“That’s—I—I’m sorry. Sorry,” Tony said.  He swiped at his brow with his hand and gave Steve a narrow, questioning look.  “Are you—are you being serious?”
“Because of all the talking through things we’d have done?” Steve asked, giving him a long look that went straight to Tony’s groin. “Actually, you’re probably not entirely wrong,” Steve admitted, because Steve was obviously very reasonable when he wasn’t being a stubborn, unreasonable jackass about things like custom t-shirts.  “I think you’re…insecure…about this because we haven’t…I mean, usually that would happen, but, um, you weren’t here yet when I was, ah, when I woke up…so…well.  There’s that, uh, issue.”
“How does a concubine know anything about the mechanics of trebuchets?  Thought the only things that ever came out of concubine’s mouths were pretty lies,” the King asked, sounding only mildly curious, as if the answer didn’t matter, but there was an undercurrent in the King’s voice that Steve couldn’t name.  “Not that I’m complaining, mind you.  It was a good suggestion.  Inspired, actually.  I should’ve thought of it, tell you the truth.  Affix the damn things to the walls.  Why not?  Just because it’s never been done before, not that I’ve heard of, and I’ve heard of a lot.  It’s been…a while.  Since someone managed to surprise me.  So.  I ask you.  How does a concubine know anything about the mechanics of trebuchets?”
“Yeah, yeah.  Wants to ride shotgun, I know,” Tony replied.    “You let me deal with Ross, how about?   Though, if you want to tell me how Rumlow got the drop on you, I’m all ears.  Among other things.”
“Yeah, no.   Forget assassins, the plaid would kill me.  Slowly, which is just cruel,” Tony smirked, while Steve looked down at his—okay, fine—plaid shirt. “I’m in pain, right now.  It physically hurts. You’re married to me, remember?  Got to look the part.”
“Yes.  At the Tower.  Come back and marry me and see him,” Tony huffed back.  “I’ll program him to officiate.  Remember that cryptkeeper we had in Vermont?  Smelled like—“
Honestly, this was fucking California.  Where were the God-damned earthquakes when you needed one?  This was false advertising, is what it was.
Steve nodded, unsure what to say at this point.  He wound his arm around Tony’s again, and they slowly walked in tandem out of the ballroom.  The private elevator to the Presidential Suite was marked by a small, gold plaque and a security sensor, which one of the guards waved his card over to signal the car.  Steve watched the numbers above light up as they counted its descent, his hand still holding Tony’s in a too-tight grip, but he couldn’t bring himself to loosen it. He needed to feel that connection, and Tony, who was rocking back and forth on his heels next to him, occasionally bumping against Steve’s shoulder and giving his hand an even harder squeeze, hardly seemed to mind.
“Why do I get the feeling we both know that isn’t true?” Steve retorted, his eyes meeting Tony’s and there was a question there, uncertainty, sure, but there was something else, too.  Tony had seen it too many times not to recognize it, felt it too much lately not to know it.  Hope.  “The dreams, the inside jokes, the drawings—why is it always you, Tony?”
The Doomsday Clock was still jauntily ticking away on the mantle as Tony entered the cabin and walked over to the kitchen sink.  He looked down at the countertop for a moment, then put his hands over the cracks, balling his knuckles into fists and rocking them against the spidery lines.  His eye caught on the flash of gunmetal-gray that circled the ring finger of his left hand.  He still couldn’t identify the metal, which was impossible, yet, like so much to do with Steve, still managed to be true.
Tony stared at them all, eyes flicking around the room and briefly catching on the camera, which slowly lowered, as if Daniel hadn’t even realized he still had it in his hands.  On the screen, shoes and a khaki-covered pants leg filled the screen, while two fingers brushed in front of it, clearly trying to surreptitiously turn it off, with little success.  The film rocked to one side, as what Steve recognized as Tony’s jeans-clad leg rocketed past to shouts of his name following him.
“Barnes?” Tony asked, frowning in confusion.  Steve nodded. Not that he didn’t care about Barnes, but holy hell, Steve—Steve had to be…how was the guy even functioning?  He reached out for Steve, wrapping his hand around Steve’s where it had been picking at the edge of the counter, and pulled Steve to him.  “Hey.  Whatever—whatever it is, I’m right here, okay?”
“Don’t apologize,” the King said quickly, cutting Steve off.  “Let us say that I find it…refreshing,” the King finished with an odd sort of half-smile and that same intent, puzzled look that Steve was growing familiar with.  The King waved a hand at him, stood, walked over and cupped the sides of Steve’s face in his hands.
“Seventy years,” Fury repeated, cutting Tony off and leaning back in his chair and making it rock slightly. “Of no suppressants.”
Of course, none of that mattered if he had misread things last night or done something he ought not have.   How was he even supposed to know what Shellhead liked? What if, Steve wondered with a sour twist to his stomach, he had done something wrong?  It wasn’t as if he really knew what he was doing anyway, and certainly not with someone like Shellhead.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve added after a moment.  He licked his lips and looked at the strap again.  It filled his vision, crystal clear, while everything else went hazy at the edges.
“Foggy would say that’s a fairly typical reaction to knowing me. Shall we go in?” Matt asked, sweeping out an arm while Barnes mouthed, ‘Who’s Foggy?’ at Steve, who just shook his head.  “Our witness should be waiting.”
Steve pushed in as slowly as Tony would allow, but he was already sliding down and wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist, pumping his hips up to meet Steve’s thrust.  Finally, Steve felt Tony’s body give, and his cock slipped deep inside him until he was fully seated. Steve grunted, shifting a little on his knees, and lifted Tony’s hips as he pulled back a bit, then pushed in again. Tony’s eyes flew open and he let out a sharp cry as Steve’s thrust found the right spot.  Picking up the pace, Steve drew back, then thrust in again, pistoning his hips over and over, the head of his cock pounding against Tony’s prostate. Tony was making a high-pitched, keening noise in the back of his throat. His eyes were wide and fixed on Steve, his mouth parted as his breath came in pants. Steve pounded into him, rolling his hips, and alternating between shallow and deep thrusts, keeping Tony’s body on edge as the pressure built.  Tony’s body was a tight, hot, wet mess, slowly falling apart under Steve’s thrusts.
Steve had wondered, this morning, how Tony would treat slaves who were not sharing his bed, and here was his answer.  He does not see, Steve realized, looking over at Tony, who was taking another cup of chilled wine from a girl who might as well have been invisible.  He cannot allow himself to look.  If he did, Steve knew, Tony was far too smart not to see this for what it was, so he simply did not see.  Trained to blindness from birth.  They all were.  Except, each day with Steve, Tony saw him, truly saw him, more and more, and that was what terrified Zola.  Not the collar.  Not the namesake.  Not the gifts or the status.  That Tony might see Steve and one day, not be able to look away.
“Look at you,” Steve said, voice rough and hushed, like it was tinged with awe.  It sent a spike of something hot curling through Tony’s belly, filling him and making him feel empty at the same time.
“Perhaps,” Rhodey acknowledged, albeit grudgingly.  “But it is an illusion that has stood against the wheel of time without faltering, my friend, and this,” he stopped, shook his head and let out a huff of air through his nose, “this world you seek, this ideal you want to believe in…what I’m trying to say is that it is good for Tony to have that, too, and not just the whispers of what must be.  All kings must be realists, if they are to last. But, you’re good for him.  I’ve seen it.  In the Council chambers, in Court, talking through things with him since you’ve been here.  You give him something I don’t think any of us can give.”
Once upon a time, matchmakers were used help find someone compatible, or that was how they billed it anyway, until technology replaced the village witch throwing stones and chicken bones in the dirt and trading divination for your prized cow.  Now it was all online, sophisticated search programs, registries, trans-national immigration agreements, the whole world seeming to have embraced the idea once science gave them permission to believe what everyone wanted to believe all along.  That there was someone out there for you, your match, your mate.  It was comforting, he supposed.  Maybe we needed it now more than ever, as fractured and disconnected as we were.  As alone.
“It is a beautiful land, truly,” Tony said after a moment, watching Steve with an intense look that Steve could feel sink into his skin, the way it always did when he had Tony’s attention.  “The Dark Sea at its back, down the Ridge with its mines and quarries, to the Greenway, where Lord Ellis’ keep sits in a crescent of fertile valleys.  Lady Van Dyne’s Great Harbor at Koltun is nothing short of a marvel. The Red Mountains are like nothing else in the world.  Even the wastes beyond the Gate have their own kind of beauty.  The land is…it is truly remarkable, as is its people,” Tony said.  Steve could hear the pride in Tony’s voice, alongside the pleading.  “I would have you care for it and its people, as I do. I would not have your thoughts of this place be colored by the ones from when you first saw it,” Tony finished with a somewhat grim set to his face. “It would…mean a great deal were you to come to care for this place and the people, as if they were your own.”
Tony sucked in a sharp breath, then raked a hand over his face.  “Is it because of what happened on the platform, do you think?”
Tony grinned, wide and leering, clearly enjoying whatever it was he saw on Steve’s face.  Oh, he definitely knew, Steve thought.
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.  “Ready to head back?  I guess I should try on whatever suits might be delivered.”  Brock nodded and finished his drink in one, long swallow, then they weaved their way through the flow of people and towards the casino doors.
“Speaking of a few more days of our little arrangement, Pep is setting up a press conference,” Tony told him.
He stood there in front of Tony, in only his collar and the cage around his cock, letting Tony’s gaze wash over him.  It enveloped him, pushing back at the pain, the longing, driving away everything that wasn’t whatever this was between them.
Steve figured he had sand in unfortunate places, so hit the shower.  He knew Tony wouldn’t join him.  Tony still didn’t want to remove his shirt in front of Steve, no matter how many times Steve told him he wouldn’t be bothered by whatever scarring there might be.  As far as Steve was concerned, whatever scars Tony had earned from his ordeal were ones that meant he could come home, and that was really all that mattered.  Life lines, Steve thought to himself as he shucked off the wet trunks and waited for Jarvis to get the water heated and jets set.  He washed the sand and salt off his skin and out of his hair, then reached for the small tube he’d grabbed from the nightstand while Tony was changing.
“I’ve known him my whole life, Steve.  My whole life.  Since I was a boy.  He’s been by my side longer than you have been alive.  I rode on his shoulders through the bailey, for God’s sake, making an absolute fool of him.  Everything I know about running a kingdom, it came from Obie,” Tony protested.
“Can we—can we talk about something—anything—else?  Please?” Steve asked after a long, awkward moment, causing everyone to immediately look away in vague attempts to seem occupied.
The King’s withdrew his tongue, then delved in again, deeper this time, lips brushing against Steve’s rim.  And then, the warm wetness was gone, replaced by the sudden, rough scrape of the King’s bearded chin across Steve’s hole.  He cried out.  He thought it might have been the King’s name.  His hips juddered against the King’s mouth, and his cock bounced at the motion, sending drops of fluid across Steve’s stomach.  The King sat up and stretched across Steve’s prone form for the warm oil that brewed in the small pot over the candle by the bed and dipped his fingers in, coating them generously before running those same fingers down the crease of Steve’s ass, swirling them around his wet hole, mimicking the path the King’s tongue had taken moments before.
These are some snippets that I did over on tumblr for my follower celebration once I hit 10k followers. Of course, then drama happened and I ended up getting off tumblr.  So, here's a few things from various fics that people requested.  Sorry for typos, not beta'd.
“Tony. Come here,” Steve called out, holding a hand out into the space above him. A moment later, Tony’s fingers laced through his, and he felt Tony’s lips scrape across his knuckles. He brought Tony’s hand down to the curve of his stomach and pressed it against the hard flesh there, just below his navel. Tony’s hand splayed out, fingers flexing against his skin for a moment before he stilled. “We’re going to have a baby. A
“Why do I feel like that about sums up our relationship?”  Steve teased, mouth twisting into a grimace as his eyes flashed sharp and bright at Tony.   “Fine,” he conceded with an exaggerated sigh at Tony’s pleased huff of laughter.  “If this is what you really want…”
“It may not be everything, but it is something, Tony,” Jarvis interjected gently.  “Something you deserve.  Very much, I believe."
Steve pushed himself up to all fours, head bowing low and breaths coming in deep, heaving pants, muscles shuddering with some effort Tony couldn’t comprehend.  They were too far apart, Tony realized, after being together for so long, this was too much.  He kicked his jeans and boxers off the rest of the way and half crawled up to kneel at Steve’s head, wrapping his arms around him as best he could and drawing him closer.  Steve obligingly curled into Tony’s embrace while Tony ran his hands up and down Steve’s skin.  They were both a mess, sticky and sweaty, and he was pretty sure those were carpet fibers in Steve’s hair.
“Who are these people?” Steve demanded.  He kept his voice slow, controlled, sliding over the words carefully.  “Ross? Who else? Who would—"
“Nothing,” Steve said quickly, ducking his head and scraping his shoe against a groove in the alleyway.  “It’s fine.  Everything’s fine.  I just--I--I guess I kind of had a fight with Brock, and needed somewhere to cool off, that’s all,” Steve told him.
It was a little after five in the evening by the time Happy dropped Tony off outside the building where Steve worked, and already dark enough for stars to be visible and headlights to form a chain of white dots, punctuated by insistent honking, up and down the street.  The temperature was dropping fast.  Tony’s lungs were already burning with the cold night air, and he could feel it seeping through the layers of clothing and settling over his skin.
Steve felt a second finger slide into him, and it felt, for a moment, like he was being torn apart. Then the splintering feeling settled into his chest, and his hole gave way as Tony thrust his fingers in and out and peppered kisses over Steve’s back and shoulders and down the curve of his arms where they strained behind him.
“Just your run-of-the-mill blind date, Officer,” Tony called out, then grinned up at Steve and drew him in for another kiss.
“Ambulance,” Steve husked out, slowly releasing his grip enough to turn Tony around so he was cradled against Steve’s chest, almost hidden by the bulk of Steve’s arms.  Safe, Tony thought, and pressed his cheek to the center of Steve’s chest, just over his heart where he could hear the rapid beats pound though his ears.  It sounded reassuring somehow.  From underneath Steve’s arm, Tony caught sight of the flashing lights in the distance.  He frowned.  Leave it to Howard to somehow manage to screw this up for him while being unconscious.  Typical.
“I haven’t really thought much about it,” Steve said.  “Have you? The company, I mean.  Not the—other thing.  Have…have you thought much about it?” Steve was blushing. That was cute.  In a God, why must you torture me so, kind of way.
“I know,” Steve said softly, almost sadly, tilting his head so his forehead rested against Tony’s.  “Someone knew about your squirrel missile,” Steve said, changing course with all the subtlety of Liberace’s gayness.
“Fun?  This was only, like, the best day ever.  Or, at least right up there with the time the Skee-Ball machine at Chuck E. Cheese accidentally started spitting out tons of tickets, and I got to trade them for the remote-controlled monster truck and two pixie sticks.  Kind of a tie,” Tony grinned.
“Not even a tiny bit close,” Tony replied with a too-bright smile that seemed to momentarily throw Hammer off, though only for a moment.  Steve looked between the two of them, momentarily befuddled. He wondered what in the world Tony was up to, making a beeline for Hammer, though it wasn’t like he could just ask.
Tony hummed, a pleased note, then tipped his chin up just slightly, encouragingly, and thrust his thumb into Steve’s mouth again, rubbing it along the flat of Steve’s tongue, then around, swirling it and sliding it deeper before drawing it slowly out again, leaving the tip dangling from Steve’s bottom lip.
“Welcome to the Ridge,” Lord Rand said by way of greeting.  “Should you need anything, Master Eram is our harem master. He would be honored to assist you,” he added, gesturing towards a tall, balding man with a thick neck and soft belly who had the look of a kindly grandfather about him that Steve suspected was far too carefully cultivated to be genuine.
“I knew it!  I fucking knew it!” Brock yelled down at them, taking the final few steps so fast that he was looming over them before Steve could do more than shove Tony to the side and angle his body in front of him.  “You little slut, this is what I get, huh?  Fucking figures!  You think you can do this to me?  To me!?!  No fucking way, Rogers, no
“Like you said. I mean, I didn't like how you said it, but, you weren't wrong,” Steve conceded in that same tired, listless tone, the last of his words punctuated by a hard glance at Tony.
“Alcohol doesn’t do much for me,” Steve said as he pulled the pitcher helpfully labeled lemonade in black marker out of the refrigerator.  It was a small thing, of all the things since yesterday, so Tony couldn’t say exactly why it made something tighten, then loosen, in his chest.  Maybe because it was so freely given, not out of any kind of obligation or guilt or worry about Tony, just because, apparently, it was true.
“I trust you had an enjoyable evening?  Such an honor, and so richly deserved, of course,” Zola tittered, shuffling a bit closer as he did.
“Night, Rhode-kill,” Tony grinned, tossing Rhodey a wave.  “Do not let Happy make security badges for my tenants.  I’ll grant you, the building needs some upgrades, but we are not turning this into a demilitarized zone. I know how he loves the 3D printer, but just print out a kidney or something to distract him, would you?”
“Yeah,” Steve nodded.  “But, there was this one passage.  You were—you were talking about being at MIT and your parents and all that,” Steve said, eyes going soft and far away for a moment. “That you worked with the car companies to improve safety features after that. Then taking over the company, and how you felt this obligation to the troops to make sure they had the best gear.  How that was what kept you up at night, wondering if you’d done enough, or if some spouse or parent or child was going to get a call like you got.  I was in the middle of trying to decide whether to re-up, and I guess that resonated a little more than I wanted to admit.  Worrying that you’re not doing enough, and someone else is going to get hurt because of it,” Steve finished, looking down at his lap before turning his head towards Tony.
“I wish you’d just say whatever it is you want to say to me about it,” Tony muttered.  He took another bite and looked at Steve over the half-eaten sandwich.
“Eh, it’s really what they expect. Me and some big scandal or whatever, I mean. No offense,” Tony said quickly, holding up a placating hand.  “You do know that the literal last thing I am is ashamed to be with you, don’t you? Tell me you know that.”
“So, we’re just not going to talk about how you made a CD of Songs in the Key of Carol?” Tony asked.
“He is annoyingly wealthy,” Tony agreed.  He looked back at Steve again, pursing his lips. “If you’re going to be king, it is better to be a
“Wasn’t—wasn’t your fault,” Tony objected with a weak shrug.  “Not a big deal.  I was the asshole, anyway.  I--I really am sorry.  About your friend, I mean.  And…for what I said.”
A familiar frisson of worry snaked down Steve’s spine at the thought, though he resolutely pushed it away.  Those thoughts were not for today, he told himself firmly.  They would leave the city tomorrow to begin their journey to the desert wastes that fanned out from the Red Mountains, where Tony’s Jerak’ho would be demonstrated for the intractable General Ross, who led the realm’s southern defenses.
“Coulson said you were having fun,” Steve chuckled, mouth tugging up at the corners.  A warm burst of pleasure bloomed in Tony’s chest at the sight.  It wasn’t relief, or at least, not entirely relief.  He hadn’t screwed up.  He hadn’t embarrassed Steve, who, come to think of it, was beaming a knowing smile at Tony.  So, relief, yeah, okay, a little, but floating above that, for the first time in God only knew when, there was pride, undiminished by fear or self-loathing, and it was such a heady rush of emotion that for a second, his vision swam and the room seemed to slant before righting itself again.  He sucked in a shaky breath and pointed at the, well, pieces of the drone.
“Mr. Jarvis,” Steve repeated, extending the hand that wasn’t holding the bag of food.  “I’m honored to meet you, Sir.  Tony’s told me a lot about you.”
He was jumping way too far ahead of himself.  The fact that they both liked each other wasn’t exactly a declaration of, well, anything.  It didn’t necessarily mean what Bucky seemed to think it could mean. Tony probably dated a lot, Steve thought, sort of vaguely remembering tabloid headlines in the checkout aisle blaring their speculation on Tony’s various partners over the years.  Starlets and models. Sports superstars.  The occasional writer or academic, and twice, actual royalty.  Not too many down-on-their-luck-ex-military-strippers, Steve had to admit.
.  Brock was right, it was Tony Stark.  How bad could it be? Plenty of people would do it for free, let alone for a million dollars. He wouldn’t be human if he didn’t at least
Tony sucked in a deep, shuddering breath, trying to steady himself when his stomach swooped at the thought.  So.  He was going back.  To Steve’s. This time, with Rhodey in tow, so there was that, but the reality of having to see Steve again, when he hadn’t prepared himself for it, when he’d told himself that it was just that one time, one time, and they were done, was settling in his gut like a stone.  He just wasn’t sure what name to call it, or maybe he knew, but was afraid to name it.
“What if I’d said no?” Tony blurted out before the words had even fully entered his head.  It was what he wanted to ask, but he didn’t mean to want to ask it, let alone actually say it.  It was out there between them, though, floating in a cartoon talk-bubble he could almost see.  “You said you didn’t think you’d like it if—if you didn’t have me.  What if I’d said no?  That day at SHIELD.  When we met.”
Belonging. That was the word his mind was searching for.  He had belonged to someone since that night, and someone to him, tethered by an invisible thread. Bound in blood and night, that was what Tony said, Steve recalled with a slight shiver.  And tomorrow...tomorrow, he might not ever feel like that again.  It punched the air out of his chest, the thought of it. His stomach sank, even as his blood thumped through his veins, echoing a primal need he could barely name.
“I should be getting back to SHIELD and leave you to it.  There’s a link in the letter to an Admissions packet with all kinds of information.  Some of it won’t apply to you, of course, and there will be some…adjustments, I guess you’d call it. Chaperones, when you’re attending class.  And you’ll have to live off-campus. No Alpha lab partners.  They’ll give you some flexibility on, ah, working around your—your cycle.  That kind of thing.  I’m sure Captain Rogers will talk you through the specific arrangements when he gets back,” Coulson said quickly, shifting a bit in his seat with obvious discomfort.  “Tony…are you sure you’re okay?” Coulson pressed with a frown after Tony didn’t respond.
It didn’t hurt, not really.  Startled Steve more than anything.  It was the sound of it that shook him out of whatever inertia had taken hold.  The sound.  He knew the sound.  That sharp crack of flesh hitting flesh and then silence, as if the sound had sucked every other noise into it, like some kind of black hole.  It didn’t hurt, just stung a bit, but it
“Home with you now, Steve,” the man instructed. Steve frowned harder at the man, and, if anything, the man’s grin grew wider.
“Title of my autobiography.  Anyway, I’ve been told that I butt in too much,” Stark countered, then huffed out a low laugh at Steve’s slight scowl. Steve heard a ping, and Stark looked back at his phone again.  “Your wayward boyfriend is in the bar up on the top floor.  Only one bay of elevators goes up there, which I’m guessing is why you got turned around. I suppose he did lose track of time, what with all the drinking and chatting up bar hottie there,” Stark said, eyebrow raised.
“I guess,” Steve agreed with a frown.  “I suppose it makes sense we both have nightmares about each other.”  He watched Tony’s face shift, an odd expression, almost like confusion, crossing it.  “What?” he asked. “Tony, what?”
Then there was the night that Steve found an old chess set in the top of one of the closets, and actually looked proud when Tony managed checkmate in four moves without really meaning to.  Alphas and Wookies.  Better to just let them win, as Tony had learned at an early age.  But, Steve had been ruefully admiring, and seemed to have no desire to pull either of Tony’s arms off, though he did insist on a rematch.  Took eight moves to Bobby Fischer Steve that time, but only because Tony had been distracted by the way Steve was rubbing his thumb up and down over one of Tony’s knights, because apparently chess porn didn’t just mean Kasparov’s Immortal.
He couldn’t exactly deny Rhodey’s words, mostly because that whole couple of months was a blur of terrible decisions, trying to decide if he hated himself or Steve more, and finally hitting the rock bottom coin-flip of Ty and a black eye.
“That, I definitely know,” Pepper agreed amiably. “You sent the jet for James? I've got a notification from the airport that his flight plan says he'll land at one. I'll have Happy pick him up.”
Tony paused his ministrations and broke his mouth from Steve’s nipple and his fingers slid out of Steve’s body, leaving him feeling wide open and empty at the loss.  A thunderous expression that flickered across Tony’s face before he drew in a breath and seemed to regroup.
“He always took care of me, my David,” Charles replied.  They were approaching a pair of tall, wooden-paneled double doors, flanked by a doorman in a pristine black tuxedo, with a gold plaque next to the right door signifying they had reached their destination.  “Now, I get to take care of him.”
“Well, we’ll…” Tony started, then stopped because he actually had no idea what to do about that. Bruce was the serum expert. He just built stuff for Steve to throw or otherwise mangle. So what, exactly, he would do about this, he had no idea. Fix it sounded wrong somehow, and he found himself oddly resistant to suggest that. The serum had corrected Steve’s ailments, but it hadn’t ‘fixed’ Steve. There hadn’t been anything to fix, wasn’t that Erkine’s whole point and the unfortunate lesson Bruce had learned the hard way? “We’ll figure it out,” Tony finally settled on, having nothing more to offer at the moment.
Tony wanted to.  He wanted to so very, very badly.  Love you, he thought. He couldn’t get the words to come out, though.  He could breathe easier, but everything else was still stuck in slow motion, moving forward one frame at a time.  He gasped, a soft, hiccupping sound, and tossed his hand to the side, pointing in what he hoped was the direction of the case, but which proved to be more or less his hand flailing uselessly at his side.  God, his chest fucking hurt like someone huge had stepped on it. He reached up, pawing uselessly at the place where the reactor had been, his eyes squeezing shut before a gasp of pain forced them open.
Tony, it turned out, liked eighties rock, mostly what Steve considered the “loud screaming” variety, not that he was going to criticize much since he favored the more-cliche musicals. To his surprise, Tony didn’t mock his love of Rogers and Hammerstein, but instead mentioned how much his mother always loved hearing him play that music back when piano lessons were apparently mandatory.  Steve found his gaze drifting again to Tony’s hands and thinking that he had really nice, long, dextrous fingers, good for playing piano, and then his mind went to other places and he nearly choked on his bite of salad and had to cover it by downing half his glass of water.
To Steve’s surprise, Tony knelt down and slid his hands under Steve’s foot to lift first one shoe off and then the other, then stood up, smoothing his hands up Steve’s calves, over his thighs and the curve of his ass as he did.  He continued his path around Steve’s waist and up his chest, palms gliding over Steve’s nipples just hard enough so the vee of Tony’s spread fingers caught on them for a moment before moving on, hands roaming over Steve’s collarbone and shoulders, tracing the column of his throat, his jaw, his cheeks, where the latticework of metal still covered most of his face.
“Can’t hang out in one place all night, Spangles,” Tony said in false cheer, “Besides, I have a thing.”
“Well, I have to call you something,” Tony pointed out. Suddenly, familiar images flooded his mind, and he laughed and shook his head.  “Okay, I am not calling you Brad Pitt or Han Solo or whatever you’re pulling out of my mental spank bank. It’s weird, I mean, I know them, and I can’t--I mean, not Han Solo, but the actor--nevermind.  Got a bit of a himbo vibe going on there, don’t you?”
“Uh-huh.  Always kind of liked getting turned around myself,” Tony said, his eyes sparkling and mouth forming a little moue, like he was sharing a joke.
Steve nodded slowly, turning back to look at the tunic clutched tightly in his hands. This was what Tony had meant, out there on the path, and back in the woods, too.  He’d been unsure, nervous even, wondering if he was doing the right thing, wanting so badly to give Steve what he believed he wanted.  Steve dropped the tunic on the bed and tugged his shirt over his head, then kicked off his boots and pulled his breeches down.  He grabbed the underclothes out of the bundle and donned those first, then the soft, fitted breeches, also done in a dark blue and the shiny leather boots over top of those.  The tunic, he put on last, feeling Bucky’s hands behind him as he pulled it over his head, smoothing it down.
“Sometimes, I...when it’s me,” Steve began, then broke off, swallowing past the lump in his throat and looking away, hot shame flooding him.
Steve came with a strangled cry. His body shuddered with the waves of pleasure as long, thick rope of his seed splattered the carpet. His breath came in heaves as the aftershocks crested through him. Tony’s tongue worked his hole as he shook, until finally he stopped shaking and his breath slowly steadied.
Steve took the two rods and tackle box and handed Tony the picnic basket.  “There’s a trail down to the pond just over there on the other side of the driveway.”
Tony managed to nod, his head lolling back against the back of the sofa as he stared up at Steve.  “Just relax,” Steve told him.  He slid off of Tony’s lap and knelt on the floor between Tony’s legs.  Tony huffed out a small puff of air, but said nothing, just watched Steve with wide, dark eyes, glittering in the low light.
“Yeah.  Don’t judge me for it, but yeah,” Tony admitted, a half-smile tugging up the corner of his mouth.
“Oh,” Steve said after a long moment, drawing Tony’s gaze to him, and God, did it hurt to look at him and think that he might have screwed this up so badly he wasn’t going to get this.  Steve cleared his throat, letting his head dip to his chest for a moment, then returned Tony’s stare.  “So, Thai tomorrow then, huh?”
I can make him happy, Steve thought with a grim sort of determination.  On the heels of that thought came a fast mental rejoinder reminding him he couldn’t make himself happy, so how did he imagine he could do that for Tony? He didn’t know.  He just...he had to try. And maybe, if he did, if he made Tony happy, even just a little, that would be close enough to happiness for himself, and he could--he could...do whatever came after that.
“There,” Steve said after about twenty minutes of pretending to be interested in the mountain vistas that stretched out into dark swaths beneath them.
“Yes,” Steve replied hurriedly with what he hoped wasn’t too much eagerness at Kirk’s, well, not complete rejection followed by running out of the room with the next two weeks of Steve’s grocery money tucked in his pocket.  “I don’t even have to do your face, if you don't want me to,” Steve assured him.   “Just your…body.  I thought, you could sort of…lean on the bench? Or, I could get you a—I don’t have a chair, but I could stack some books, if that’s better…” Steve trailed off, watching Kirk’s expression alternate between horror and an apparent desire to burst out laughing that he was currently doing a rather terrible job of suppressing.  “It won’t take long, I swear. I’m really fast.”
“Just thinking, Shellhead,” Steve said with a slight sigh as he shifted, trying to get comfortable.  “You ever lay awake at night sometimes and think things you can’t seem to let yourself think during the day?”
“I like how you show your gratitude,” Tony said.  The look was gone, a smirk that didn’t quite meet Tony’s eyes replaced it.  “Please, feel free to express your appreciation—“
Tony let out a long, wheezing breath and turned his head so his cheek rested across Steve’s shoulder.  From this vantage, Tony could see the pulse point jumping in Steve’s neck, the rigid set to his jaw that screamed, but it was the his eyes, though, full of sorrow and a desperate, frail sort of longing that Tony recognized all too well.  He’d seen it in the mirror too many times not to know it.
“It’s nothing, really.  Just a hobby,” Steve demurred, taking another bit of the fish.  It actually was pretty good, he had to admit.
“I—I know. It’s just…now. With the…I mean, maybe. I mean…it’s just—you know what, I’ll carry it,” Tony insisted, grabbing the tray from Steve’s hands and marching out to the table on the patio. Steve sighed and followed him out, sitting down in his chair next to Tony, who passed him a plate of food and poured him a cup of coffee, then looked at it and promptly poured it onto the concrete patio. “No caffeine,” Tony said somewhat sadly, as if the loss of coffee for anyone was truly tragic.
“While it still wouldn’t be a good idea to actually go into the room with him, you can come to the observation level.  There’s a room there equipped with an intercom system, so you’ll be able to chat.  I think it would be good for you to talk to him.  I’ve told him a bit about the Avengers, given him files on everyone,” Fury continued. “Yes, including you.  It might help his adjustment to meet a fellow team member, someone that he knows he will be working with, not to mention someone who has a name that is at least familiar to him.  For some reason that escapes me, I don’t think he entirely trusts me,” Fury said, eye wide and unblinking as if he really couldn’t fathom the lack of faith.
Tony stared up at the creature in mute shock, but the panic had blessedly receded. No, not receded, Tony realized. It was just gone.  The alien drew its hand back and studied him for a moment, then smiled. On anyone else, Tony would have called it a gentle smile, but for all he knew, that was the alien’s I’m About to Eat You Face, so all in all, not especially comforting.
Who took care of Steve?  The five-million-dollar question, thanks Howard.  With Barnes sidelined, Nat’s hands full, and Thor locked away in some dusty monastery vault pouring over ancient tomes, who put Steve first, even just here and there, even if it was just when they could and not all the time?  Who made sure he got to doctors’ appointments, rehab, all that crap?  Made him rest when he needed to, got him to laugh about it when he could, cried with him when needed that, too?  Tony knew the answer, but he couldn’t quite let himself think it.
“Here,” the large man said, taking a silver flask out and tipping it into his cup and then Josh’s.  “Anyone else?  No?”
It made Tony think of his phone call with his mom, her tapping her nails on her desk, probably impatient to get off the phone with him once she’d accomplished her goal.  That made him think of David.  Dear little David, who was getting fucked according to an expensive timepiece.
People gasped and pointed, called out his name and dug for their ubiquitous phones to snap photos.  Steve smiled down at him, easy and bright and completely fake, as Tony slid his arm around Steve’s waist and maneuvered them towards the hotel doors.
Naturally, he’d managed to nick a couple spots on his face, but he pulled off small dots of toilet paper and stuck them to the drops of blood that welled up.  The ‘naturally’ part of that was mentally added when he pulled open the bathroom door and found Steve standing there with one fisted hand raised mid-knocking motion.
“Judge says: Funyuns, not Cheetos, so it counts as apology food,” Barnes put in, earning a firm nod from Wilson. “Matt, back me up.”
To the far side of the tent, a vase filled with star-shaped white lilies seemed to stare accusingly back at him.
“How are you doing?  I’ve tried not to bother you.   I know how it is, newly Bonded and all,” she said with a tittering, nervous laugh.  “Probably don’t want to hear from your poor, old mother, now that you have your Alpha, but you could at least email sometimes, Anthony.  Your father and I were beginning to worry.”
, in every sense of that word, but beautiful, Tony thought.  No use pretending now, Tony supposed. He was letting the alien who found him in space fuck him back to life or whatever, so admitting the alien was attractive was probably the least of his many, many issues for therapy later.
“Apparently, he is a friend to the young Lord Rand, who was unaware of…the circumstances of our acquaintance, let us say,” Tony replied, a bite to each of the words.  “Ty applied for the tourney, and he knew no reason to disallow it. He is, after all, a knight and a noble,” Tony huffed out a bitter laugh. “Lord Rand offered to withdraw the invitation, of course, but if I agreed to that, then it would obviously be because his presence bothers me, and I refuse to give Ty that satisfaction.”
“How did you--JARVIS, that you, buddy?” Tony asked hesitantly.  The helmet’s eyes glowed the same strange, pinkish color as the not-gel instead of their usual ice blue.
He smelled incredible.  Steve breathed in his scent again.  Like rich, deep wood and coppery metal.  Like his shield.  Like...like Iron Man. He didn’t consciously do anything, but Steve could feel his mouth and jaw…shift.  Elongate.  And he wanted.  Craved.  Needed it, this gift, this wondrous gift.
“It’s fine,” Steve said, reaching out and moving his piece.  “Your turn.”  Cam did as the King had instructed, effectively castling his King.  Steve moved his Pawn, as Tony had suggested, because, damn, that was actually the better play, much as it annoyed him to admit.
Calhoun looked up at him, his hands rubbing at his neck, a cough spluttering out of him each time he tried to breathe, making him sound a bit like something mechanical that was losing its power.  Steve rather liked that thought.
It still managed to leave him in awe that someone like Tony would want him, when he could have any Omega he wanted. But if he hadn’t wanted Steve, they would never have Bonded. Tony loved him, just as he was, which was both amazing and humbling at the same time. And now, it was his turn to take care of Tony. He felt a smile break over his face at the thought and wondered if Tony would be surprised or if he would expect it, Steve being from the Pleistocene era and all, as Tony liked to tease.
'Yeah,” Tony breathed out after a minute, his face scrunching into a wince. He clicked the phone off and held his hand over his mouth, breathing warm air over the icy skin and blinking against the sting of the wind in his eyes. The wind. Yeah. Keep telling yourself that, he thought harshly.
“Sure.  You do that, Private…Smith.  Okay, totally not a made-up name, whatever.  Look, you want to call it in to whoever, go right ahead.  I’m sure Steve—ah, Captain Rogers—will understand why I’m not where he asked me to be because of…bureaucracy and protocol and all.  People think he isn’t understanding of things like that, but he totally is.  Well.  Like, most of the time.  Some of the time.  Sometimes.  Whatever.  I mean, sure, sometimes, he’s all, “Someone gave you a hard time?  Over that?  After I explicitly said…”  And I’m like, “Steve, babe, calm down, it’s cool.”  Point is, you call.  Do your chain of command thing. I’ll just wait.  It was…Smith, right?  Smith,” Tony repeated, saying the name with a pop of his lips as he tapped his fingers across the steering wheel.
“Oh, God,” Tony moaned.  “Oh, God. I’ve stepped through some time portal to 2005.  Why does the ringing in my ears sound like Coldplay?  Should I buy Pepper a shrug sweater?  How will I know I’m a good person without my LiveStrong bracelet?”  Tony groaned and covered his face with his hands.  “No Wi-Fi?  Seriously?”
The black, curled number six hung on another door, this one a dark grey color. Steve pushed it open and stepped inside. The room, much like the desk and the building, looked like some kind of Xeroxed copy of the first place. The same, but not
“Preach,” Josh said, shifting around on the sofa.  “Ugh, God, Hugh is always there. Puttering around, building his little model airplanes, listening to the news all day and telling me how we should put all the money in gold.  I swear, if he croaks, and I have to dig up the petunias looking for his God-damned stash, I’m going to go bonkers. How’d you get so fucking lucky anyway?” Josh asked, turning to Michael.
“It’s been handled,” Steve said. The elevator opened, thankfully, though Coulson stepped inside next to him.  Apparently, this conversation was not over.
“Anthony, there you are!” his mother’s voice called out, breaking the spell.  She rushed up to Tony and wrapped her arms around him, pressing her cheek to his with an air-kiss in her version of a don’t-mess-up-the-make-up-hug.  “I thought I heard the door.  Honestly, Anthony, why are you skulking in the hallway?  Your father and Obie have been waiting to see you!  That’s not one of the suits I sent you, is it?  Well, at least it’s been pressed.  Captain Rogers, welcome.  We’re so glad you could finally make it.  Please, come and join us.  Can I have Jarvis get you a drink?”
“Good news for SI, then, huh?” Obie said in a speculative tone that was trying hard to be placating.  “Army, eh?  Science Board’s a tough nut to crack, Howard.  Looks like Tony here’s something of a golden goose, as they say.  Hey, look,” Obie said, putting his hands up in the air, palms out.  A gesture of surrender, Tony thought.  “If the military folks don’t care, then I don’t care.  I’m just the money guy, okay?  Someone has to look after the books if we want to keep enjoying this kind of thing,” he said, waving a hand around the room.  “But, Tony’s the one they want, fine by me.  We’ll be progressive.  Hell, this is California.  Probably get some good press out of it.”
, he thought, and it lingered for a while at the tip of his mind.  Tony’s answering smile was gentle. Reassuring.
, Steve thought, a stab of anguish punching the words into his gut.   He was failing (falling) at all of this, and somehow, Anthony, or the idea of him, anyway, had become tied up with everything in his head.  Maybe because the therapist had thrown the idea of Bonding out like some kind of lifeline, a magic pill to fix whatever was ailing him like the old tonic ads used to promise.  Whatever the reason, Steve had grabbed on and held, and he thought it might be the only thing keeping him here.
—this thing between them, whatever it was. What did that say about him? His mind flashed again to the strap on the bed, to kneeling at Tony’s feet with Tony’s cock in his mouth while time flowed over him like a river, and he felt his own cock harden all the more, pressing at the delicate fabric of his robes.
Steve blinked awake, then reached up to wipe the sleep from his eyes.  He didn’t quite want to wake up fully just yet. He was far too warm and contented as he was.  During the night, he had somehow migrated virtually on top of Tony, using Tony’s chest as a pillow, and now, he could feel the steady rise and fall of Tony’s breaths underneath his cheek and hand and the comforting thump of Tony’s heartbeat.
Tony’s fingers buried inside him, swirling around and around his prostate, pressing hard against it and refusing to let up, until Steve wanted to sob from too much sensation, all the signals getting crossed in his mind because it hurt too much and felt too good, and he hadn’t known what to do with that, except that he wanted to beg Tony to stop and make him promise to keep going at the same time. Tony’s knot swelling inside him until it filled him completely, brushing against every part of him at once, different than the slide of Tony’s cock, bigger and wider and deeper, so much deeper inside him, keeping Tony’s cum there. Where it belongs, he thought, feeling a fierce surge of pleasure at that thought.
turned him in for hacking into the system and changing his grades, but Daddy got him into Cal-Tech, I hear,” Tony muttered through his teeth.  “So, punching is really more a West Coast thing. Sorry, Sugarbear, you know I love it when you defend my ever-so-slightly besmirched honor.”
Steve spent the time with a pencil moving up and down a sketch pad making low, scratching sounds when the end wasn’t propped between Steve’s teeth waving a giant ‘Oral Fixation’ flag in Tony’s direction.
, Rhodey, okay?  I’m fine. I’m good.  I got this,” Tony said, holding both hands out in front of him in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture.
The soft thunk of the door closing seemed a fitting bit of punctuation for the ending of Steve’s evening with Tony.  Steve stared at the darkened television screen a while longer.  There was just enough light from the kitchen to see his own dim, distorted reflection caught in a bright star of reflected light.  You’re seeing things, old man, Steve thought, scrubbing at his face and resolutely pushing himself off the sofa.
He was half way to seriously considering reaching for his phone when his head snapped up. Honestly, his first impulse when he heard the key grate into the lock was to hide, which was both ridiculous and impractical, given the relative lack of hiding spots in Steve's tiny closet of an apartment. Steve shuffled in, wearing the same set of work clothes he'd been wearing the other day when Tony ambushed him on the street, ground to a stop and gaped wide-eyed at Tony for a moment, looking around the rest of the apartment uncertainly, like someone might jump out and shout 'Worst Surprise Ever,' at any moment.
Or, Steve hoped it was still there.  It only showed on a few of the older maps in Tony’s collection, and Steve had no way of knowing if it had become impassable due to some calamity over the years, but it was his best chance.  Horses couldn’t follow, so being on foot wouldn’t be a disadvantage. The high ground would let him see anyone approaching. And if he was right, it would lead, eventually, to the other side of the mountains and the sea beyond, where he hoped he could find safe passage back home.
“Be an artist,” Steve blurted out.  That was true enough.  “I mean, there’s no way I could have, of course, it’s…what use is there for that kind of thing? Painted shields and leathers, maybe, but…” he trailed off, shaking his head, though Tony had canted his head to the side and was regarding him with a look of utter delight.
Ms. Potts had apparently called ahead to warn the store, which turned out to be a good thing, as a flood of people suddenly descended in desperate need of picking up and putting down all the stuff they couldn’t afford.  The salespeople helpfully ushered them out and closed the glass doors across the front of the store, giving Steve and Tony the run of the place.
“Good,” Tony said, adding a second finger, pushing in and out, curling them up and stretching them wide as he pulled them out.  The added pressure and stretch drew a sharp gasp from Steve, but before he could settle into the feeling, a third was added.  He let out a sharp, hitching cry that fell into a moan as Tony pushed all three fingers in deep, then pulled them out, leaving Steve suddenly empty.  Steve felt a warm, wet finger trace around his rim, then a second, hooking each side and tugging.  Another moan rattled around in Steve’s chest, then worked its way up and out of his throat in a long, low keen.   Tony’s hands cupped Steve’s ass, kneading the flesh and spreading him wide, until Steve felt cool air across his hole as Tony surveyed his progress.
“Yes. Yes,” Tony nodded, his eyes sparking with understanding. “Disbursing weapons to the other tribal leaders under the auspices of protecting the borderlands would certainly make Ul-Tarn think twice about any kind of uprising.
“That… seems like a terrible idea,” Natasha said as she sipped from her coffee cup where she was curled into the wooden chair opposite Steve with one knee propped up.
Tony watched the two Alphas trade uncomfortable looks with a surge of satisfaction.  When the elevator doors finally opened, they scurried out and down the hall, shoving at each other and anyone else who got in the way of their escape.  Ah, the brave men of SHIELD. It truly warmed the heart.
“You really think,” Steve began, voice low and incredulous.  He struggled to push himself up on his elbows and lean over towards Tony, looking up at Tony with sharp, clear eyes.  “That I’d let you go off to MIT without me?  To a place with all those—those people?  Where I couldn’t look after you? What if…what if they were mean to you?”
“I know you did not just hang up on me,” Rhodey said pointedly.  “Look, I get how this looks right now, okay?  I’m not saying it’s an easy thing, something like that.  But, it isn’t on you, Tony.  It just isn’t. Not the way you want to take it on you, anyway, because you’re Tony Stark and you know all, and so anytime something goes wrong, that’s on you.  I know how you think.  You’ve done that to yourself for years, but this one?  This one’s on the guy who sold weapons under the table to make a few more bucks than what you were already giving him, and the assholes who used them on their people and our soldiers.  Yeah, you’re smart as hell, but not even you can control everyone and everything, no matter how hard you try.”
“I didn’t exactly ask you to visit,” Tony pointed out, pulling out one of the kitchen chairs and sitting down to watch Jarvis putter around the kitchen.
“I know,” Steve replied. He reached up and ran his hand through Tony’s hair, letting out a sigh as his mouth flattened into a grimace.  He did know.  He thought he might even want it or had wanted it, once upon a time.  It was hard to say what he wanted, except this. Except Tony.   Blood and night,
“I don’t know, man, based on what I saw on Twitter this morning, that might help,” Rhodey argued. “Where is your other hand even at in this one?”
“You could just tell him, you know.  I know, I know, the Circle of Secrecy, but come on, man.  It’s Captain America.  He’s not going to out you,” Rhodey said.
If he moved forward any at all, it would almost be an embrace.  For a second, Tony could almost feel the slight tug of the chain digging in to the back of his neck, or wished he could.  He looked up, only to find Steve’s eyes on him, dark and hazy under the shadows cast by the trees as the wind caught the branches.
“Right about here, I think,” Steve said, leaning forward for a long, soft kiss that melted into something else entirely.
“His lawyers are still saber-rattling, but it’s going nowhere,” Tony answered, looking down at his phone for no reason other than it provided a distraction.   “Showing up at a strip club is practically a rite of passage for a congressman, sure, but hanging out at one that caters to a gay crowd?  We’ve come a long way, baby, but not that far.  He’ll let the punch slide.”
, more accurately.  It gave them a window where they didn’t have to be entirely precise, but also a fixed point in time where they knew the exact place and time where the Tesseract would be.  Get the Tesseract. Take it to Wakanda, instead of Asgard. Explain. He even had a digitized message from Shuri that was still tucked on a Kimoyo bead in his pocket. Then, they could…figure something out.  They would have years. Years to figure it out before Thanos and his minions showed up.
“Ah,” Kadina sighed and something that might have been sympathy passed over her face, though it was gone quickly.  “You are most fortunate, then, to find yourself here.  You’ve the look of Lord Stone.   This is why Sitwell chose you.  Not much of it, but some.  Enough, I suppose, for Zola to think the King might enjoy you.  But, Zola is a fool when it comes to our King.  He treats him like his father.”
“Still,” Steve insisted, shifting slightly in the pool, because, well...Tony was suddenly talking about Steve thought they were decidedly not talking about.
The shield was lighter than he expected.  It almost vibrated as he lifted it, wrapping his arm through the leather straps on the back.  It felt contained.  Waiting. Expectant, he thought.  He couldn’t keep the grin off his face.  He was holding Captain America’s shield.
Steve’s mind wandered through the possibilities for most of the rest of the flight.  By the time they got off the plane, collected their bags, and got a cab back to Brock’s apartment, it was too late to do much of anything except change out of their clothes and fall into bed.  They didn’t even bother to upack.  Steve took the check out of his pocket and looked at it once under the light of his phone before he sat both down on the bedside table.
The door to Tony’s apartment was ahead.  Crap.  He’d left his keys…somewhere.  At Ty’s maybe. He couldn’t remember.
“I’m not saying no or anything…but I need the weekend to…get things in order,” he finished, knowing she’d probably see right through him.  He had to tell Tony about his mom.  Soon.  Friday was the Board meeting on the clean energy project and the dinner afterwards.  Let Tony get through that and then they could have a real conversation.  Steve still wasn’t quite sure how to break it to him, other than being certain that before they went much further, they simply had to get everything out in the open.
