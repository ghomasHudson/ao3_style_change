Tony is yelling as he sprints away from Steve as fast as he can up the street, ducking and weaving as Steve takes chase, firing snowballs at him with expert aim. He nails Tony in the back on more than one occasion, the pitcher able to dodge out of the way if he dares stop to look over his shoulder.
“You’re a dick…” she repeats, taking a deep breath. “But… It’s sad to see you go,” she admits begrudgingly.
Without fail, Tony rebuffs him every time. At least he’s consistent. Steve becomes more frustrated as the days pass, not sure why Tony is being so purposefully distant from all of them. Steve wants to chalk it up to just trying to adjust to the switch-up in his lifestyle. The kid was barely out of his teen years, and just moved across the country and away from his home team. That’s enough to set anyone off kilter.
Luckily, the press is more focused on the actual active players rather than some retired old fogey, and he’s able to sneak around to the back side of the stadium, flashing his access pass to the security to be allowed inside.
get to see,” she sighs, running a hand through her strawberry blonde locks. “Tony knows that if his secret gets out, his entire career is over, and there’s no way he’ll be able to fall back on Stark Industries, even with his father not around anymore to disown him. Messing around with a fellow teammate? It’s just asking to get found out,” she sighs.
That at least puts Steve’s worries of drunk driving at bay. "Okay, thank you." Steve heads back out to the bus, finding Natasha and Janet. "Did you guys know Tony went home already?"
Exhausted, Steve collapses onto his bed without even fully undressing. He’s still riding the high off the adrenaline from the drive, the unbelievable conversation he had with one of the most influential people in baseball, and the residual excitement of winning their final game of the regular season.
“I know,” Tony fishes something out of his pocket. Steve hears the uncapping of the bottle. “Turn around.”
Wow, this guy isn't joking or just trying to be polite; He's a
Tony breaks out of the holds of the two women, stepping forward. He feels Natasha grab at the back of his suit jacket to stop him, Hammer also jumping back by a step. He doesn’t look scared of Tony at all, smarmy grin still on his face. “Hey, hey, hey, I’m being sincere! It’s
“Ow,” he hears Steve’s muffled voice before there’s a hand shoving his foot back into the tangle of sheets. “Get up.”
“I had to, Steve,” Tony tries to reason with him, stepping closer. Steve shrinks against the wall, halting Tony in his tracks. “We needed to end things before they could get any worse—”
The booth is quiet for a while, Tony downing the beer in a few swigs. Dove covertly manages to replace the empty bottle with a full one without engaging the mute couple. Steve takes a slow sip of his coffee. Just this once, he’s not going to talk first. He’ll happily leave the ball in Tony’s very volatile court.
Tony groans loudly, garnering attention from the couple sitting in the booth behind him. "So frugal! Boring! C'mon, man, you're telling me there's no big dream purchase you had in mind?"
“So is Peggy your aunt by blood, or marriage?”
“Tony,” Janet starts carefully, leaning forward slightly with her palms upturned on the table. She’s treating him like a wild animal she’s being careful not to spook. “Alexander is the owner of the Knights based in D.C. and Maria and Phil are the managers of the team.”
Having their relationship be so thoroughly scrutinized is easier for Tony than it is for Steve. He’s immensely grateful to have someone so used to being examined under a lense to bear this weight with him. The positive impact their coming out and following public relationship has on the world far outweighs all the hatred and slander they’re subject to. They’ve changed the perception of gay athletes by action more than anything else by being undeniable power houses in their own right. They would become household names so synonymous with baseball thanks to their talent and careers that they would be impossible to talk around.
“Snow’s gonna melt before we get out there if you keep moving at that pace!” Tony yells from down the hallway, front door of his apartment left open. His exuberance chips away at some of the jaded edges of Steve’s thoughts, a smile on his face as he follows Tony into the elevator.
“What do you mean?” Bucky’s frowning at him not in confusion, but in frustration. “You never slack during practice, don’t start on my account.”
Steve keeps staring at Tony, raising his eyebrows. "...Yeah?"
There’s not much room for conversation as they set off on their trek, Carol taking him on a winding path through the town, down to the beaches, back up into the hills and through the woods before doubling back. It’s nothing like the leisurely jog he and Steve had gone on, Carol constantly snapping at him to pick up the pace and tighten up his form.
If he was less attentive, Tony might’ve missed the small flash of a smile he sees flit across Steve’s face right before he readies up for his next swing. The pitcher fires a ball at him, a two-seamed pitch. Tony’s eyes widen in disbelief, knowing exactly what a pitch at that velocity and trajectory will mean for a power hitter like Steve.
“Cool. You can tell me all about your schedule after you fuck me, Steve,” Tony climbs off of him long enough to shove his pants off the rest of the way and kick them to the other end of the room, yanking Steve’s down his legs as well.
Another laugh. “We’ll see about that. Good luck tomorrow. You’ll be great.”
friend.
“Well thank you for your time today before the game, both of you. It’ll be starting soon so we’ll let Peter get out of here, but I would like to wrap things up with you, Tony.”
with everything out on display.
“Mmhm,” Tony sighs happily, tucking his face into Steve’s chest. The sound of the machine’s incessant beeping is replaced by the steady thumping of Steve’s heartbeat. “Had a dream… Can’t ‘member it now…”
“You guys are so freakin’ cool!”
"Oh really?" Tony asks with a half-smirk, not sounding very surprised by this.
He knows their rules and the reason for caution, but he’s feeling bold. It’s early, there’s no one around, and Tony can’t bear to let Steve go without one last parting kiss. He leans down to stop Steve from entering the car completely, pressing their lips together in a melancholy goodbye. He expects it to be over just like that, a quick farewell, but Steve melts against him. Tony sighs against his mouth, running his hands over his body to just
Steve’s eyes betray him, darting up to Tony’s face in surprise. There’s a brief moment of eye contact, Tony’s eyes still devoid of any comfort Steve can recognize. He looks away again, brow furrowed in frustration. “So are you.”
The night wears on, Steve and Bucky have split up to socialize in their own little groups. It isn’t just Stars players filling the bar. Wives, girlfriends, friends, and family are all joining in their celebration. Steve recognizes some of the other coaches and managers of other New York teams as well, though he isn't sure he would ever remember all the names getting thrown at him. One person with notable absence is Chester Phillips, the owner of the Stars. Phillips owned a much larger corporation and had bought the Brooklyn team quite some time ago. Once a very involved owner, he has become more of a recluse within the past few years, Steve having never even met the man in person. Any announcements from Chester were given to them from Peggy instead. There are rumors about Phillips having some grave illness that he’s keeping under wraps, but Steve tends not to participate in the gossip.
Steve grips the top of the separator, his other hand curling into a fist in the back of Tony’s hair. He wants to pull him off, but his mouth and throat feel so good that he can’t bear to force him away. His hips stutter slightly as he hears footsteps coming down the hallway, turning to see Clint poking his head around the corner.
, to his defense). They’re the last players to arrive, Janet shooting a dirty but knowing look their way as they take their seats next to her and Thor. She reaches over and catches the stem of Tony’s sunglasses on one finger, pulling them away from his face to examine his bloodshot eyes and dark circles. Neither of them exchange words, but Tony can sense the disapproval radiating from her as she shoves them back up onto his nose and sits back in her chair. She’d rake him over the coals for it later, but at least he actually made it.
“If you don’t have something nice to say, Tony…” Maria chides. Though the reminder is soft, there’s a glint in her eyes that shows she’s not to be defied. Tony rolls his eyes but doesn’t argue against it further. “But of course, you don’t have to be so formal with us, Steve,” she says, adapting her son’s crude observation into a much kinder suggestion. “The real question is: what’s it like coaching our son? I imagine he’s more than a handful for even the strictest captain.”
“I’m persistent.” Steve barely manages to catch the keys that Tony suddenly tosses to him.
Full of energy and raring to go, Tony slides over the hood of Steve’s car to jump into the passenger side, ignoring the indignant outcry from behind him. Maybe a few more scuffs here or there would finally tip Steve over the edge to buy a new car already and get rid of his
The exchange appears to be imperceptible to the rest of the table, other patrons quickly placing their bets, attention diverted elsewhere. Tony makes a sound in his throat and turns a ninety degrees so that he’s facing Steve. He takes a long sip of his vodka sour, Steve doing a slight double take when he glances over and realizes Tony is staring at him and not at the table.
“The truth is…” Tony stares down at the flimsy yellow notecard in his hands, the paper crinkling at the edges as he subconsciously clenches it tighter. He’s hidden this part of him away for so long. He had to shoot down Hill and Coulson’s attempts at trying to pin this on the supposed “mystery man”. That he was some manipulative, scorned queer that attempted to take advantage of him, or blackmail him with staged photos that ended up leaking to the public. He can’t stand the idea of Steve thinking that Tony would use him as a scapegoat, even if the world never finds out it’s him. The idea repulses him. He has to protect the man he loves, which means lying to the world about what they’ve seen. Play this off as nothing more than a horrible, disgusting lie the media has attempted to spin to ruin his career. Confirm that he’s straight, as if his sexuality should have anything to do with whether he has the ability, or should be
“It’s third degree, it has to be.”
The doctor nods to the two nurses who quickly exit the room. She straightens her glasses and sets her clipboard on the tray attached to the hospital bed. “He was found by a few pedestrians a few blocks down from a bar over in Kips Bay who called 911. They said he was going in and out of consciousness when they found him, but he was completely out when paramedics showed up. The people who found him said it looked like he was beaten within an inch of his life. We contacted the police in the area to keep an eye out for suspects, but we haven’t heard anything back yet.”
He isn’t sure how much time passes, he feels like his body is getting jostled around, he goes from laying on something hard to something soft. There’s something cold and metal and plastic pressed against his ear.
“Thank you, Dr. Cho,” Steve adds with a polite wave before jogging to catch up to Tony who practically sprints down the hallway and out of the building.
He expects some runs scored in the first inning, but not
Tony is already walking over to the sidelines, well aware he’s the reason for the time out call. Steve reaches out and clasps a hand on his shoulder, giving a slight squeeze. “What’s going on, Tony? I know you wanted to play and you hate hearing this, but I think your performance speaks for itself,” he’s keeping his tone even and diplomatic, sensitive to the unmeasurable weight bearing down on Tony’s shoulders. “Do we need to pull you?”
“But I didn’t,” Bucky wipes angrily at the tears before they can slip too far down his cheeks. “I didn’t, because I thought I couldn’t. And I didn’t want to drag you down with me, but here we are anyway,” he shakes his head bitterly, looking down at the little pile of ham cubes on his tray. “I’m not going to give you some cheesy garbage that I’m always with you in your heart or whatever, but you don’t need me to be there on the field with you to be a good ball player, you idiot. You’re doing this for both of us next week, okay? And you’re going to play amazingly, and you’re going to fucking
“Ah, right. You just hate me because I’m better than you. Not a homophobe, just an asshole.”
The door to the hallway swings open to admit Bucky, joining them in the lounge that the Groom’s party have all been sequestered away to in the time leading up to the big event. Bucky looks dashing in his own tux, not usually one for going the extra mile for how he looks on the surface. Steve himself only started putting those kinds of efforts into his appearance over the past few years because of Tony’s meticulous influence. Bucky’s beard is carefully trimmed, hair still long but tucked behind his ears and away from his face, dark locks resting against the tops of his shoulders.
“Steve is his sodding
He glances outside to where all his friends are sitting. He catches Tony’s profile, laughing at something Monica has told him, unaware of the big-life-decision conversation his boyfriend is having on the other side of the glass. Every time Steve comes to one of his games, or tosses a ball around in the backyard for fun with the man, he
I do, Tony. You know I do.”
Tony hesitates. While he’s tried to shove the meeting into the recesses of his mind for the past few days, he hasn’t really thought about how he wants to breach the topic with Steve. Part of him thinks maybe he can just ignore it and then it’ll all go away. His contract will go through, he’ll still be playing on the Avengers come Spring, and no one even has to know this was even open for discussion.
Steve closes his eyes, turns his head, and kisses the inside of Tony’s palm. “Okay. I trust you.”
Curious, Steve steps away from the power rack he was doing pull-ups on to turn the volume knob up on the television. The fuzzy screen has just cut back to the two newscasters, the picture of a smiling young Stark still on the screen behind them. The reporters seem to be in the middle of a heated discussion.
Steve waves away the cigarette smoke, taking a step closer to Tony despite his better judgement. He gets a whiff of the kid who smells like if he took a shower in the past two days, it was in nothing but booze. "Tony—"
Steve nods, knowing that there’s no need to explain himself or come up with excuses. He supposes that if he wasn’t able to hide it from Bucky for very long, it’s no surprise Tony’s closest familial figure figured it out either. It’s different than Pepper, a friend and a confidant knowing. Peggy is family to Tony, and she’s the only family he has left. Her support in this means the world to both of them.
. Of course, no one looked at him twice before his growth spurt that came well into his baseball career, his muscles finally developing and some of the awkward features on his face balancing themselves out as he aged. Steve strikes a naturally imposing figure, but Tony doesn’t seem to care about any of those norms, easily taking control and guiding Steve along for the ride.
prick. Why bother trying to find the good in Stark if you and him aren’t ever gonna be close like you and me are?”
“Upstate to see Clint and his family. His wife just had their new baby a couple of months ago and I have yet to meet the little stinker. I’m leaving tonight before the roads get too bad.”
"Why not sign me on for one or two seasons? Chester wanted me so badly that he thought I wouldn't want to stay on the team after this season if Bucky wasn't able to play?" Steve asks angrily.
Tony notices the tendon appear on Steve’s neck as his jaw clenches at that remark. In his early years in the league, Steve’s very first interview was one he had fumbled his way through, eventually telling the reporter almost too cheerily that he was determined to go “above and beyond!” For his team. This peppy mantra stuck to him, a tagline that accompanied his name in every article in the paper or segment on a radio show. Tony didn’t know until now that it would rile the man so much. Good. He’d take note of that.
They find a happy medium for both of their checklists in a three-story townhouse in one of the more historical districts. Steve is head-over-heels for the colonial architecture, the foundation of the building itself incredibly old, while most of the interior has been ripped out and redesigned to be more modern, the outside of the building getting a facelift as well. It’s a bright red painted brick with white trim, pillars on the porch out front, bay windows extruding from the house, and a small yard in the back with a black iron fence. The building itself is slim and tall, crammed in between houses and duplexes of varying styles that all appear to have been gentrified in this neighborhood. It has steep staircases leading from one floor to the next, a decently sized master bed and bath, old fashioned sconces on the walls, and even an attic area that is pretty much barren and just begging for Tony to move his workshop in. They sign all the paperwork right then and there, and the place is now his for the coming year at the very least.
He jerks off in the shower. He can’t help it, knowing he’s probably not going to get laid all week with Steve as his roommate. He can maybe pray for some good timing, or try and find someone else with their own room he can retreat to for an hour or so of fun, but it’s certainly not going to happen tonight with Steve babysitting him. They have a few days before the game and then get to stay an extra night after, so if Tony really tries, he can probably find a window of opportunity to get his rocks off elsewhere.
He had left in a hurry. That, or Janet had forced him to. The locker room feels odd in a way, and if Steve hadn’t been so preoccupied with the fact that it must be Tony’s absence, he might realize that none of the TVs are on as they normally were, running some kind of news cycle or sports coverage on low volume.
“I’ll kill that bastard for fucking up my face,” Tony grumbles in annoyance, flinching again as Pepper layers Neosporin gently over the scratch marks.
"Yep, Master’s in physics and engineering. Talks about working on a doctorate after graduation too."
Steve is quiet for a long moment. Tony hasn’t really made it clear whether or not he would be going, which makes his stomach lurch uncomfortably. “And what does Pepper think you should do?” Steve knows Tony well enough to know that there isn’t anyone with opinions he puts any stock into aside from that woman. “And Janet and Natasha?”
And one by one, strikes are called as each and every player misses. Every ball Tony throws is deemed 100% fair, and before Steve knows it, he’s up.
. Even with his eyes shrouded by orange-tinted spectacles, there is no mistaking that lopsided grin and casual strut onto the field even from a distance. Steve's head is swimming with questions. Tony holds so much notoriety right now that it would be near impossible to keep him transferring teams a secret, especially considering the team he would be leaving is owned by his own family.
“Strike two!”
Three frames left. Tony takes a deep breath. The odds are stacked against him, but this isn’t a dice roll at a Craps table. He’s got three innings and absolutely zero control over what their offensive line-up can accomplish, but if there’s one thing he does have authority over, it’s making sure the Pacific League doesn’t score a
Tony’s eyebrow climbs higher. He experimentally squeezes the bulge between Steve’s legs, beginning to rub his hand over the denim of his jeans. Steve squeezes his wrist tighter, but this time in coaxing him on as he tilts his head back, hips pressing closer. “And when’s the last time you slept with a woman?”
His bat completes its path with no resistance. Steve stumbles a bit, not expecting to miss. He turns his head in surprise, Natasha rising up from her crouch to return the ball to Tony.
Alongside his manager is a man who looks to be in his late 40s, streaks of grey woven through his dark hair that is combed back from a handsome face. He adorns a suit that probably costs as much as Steve's first Brooklyn apartment (it probably cost more than his current apartment too). He’s carrying a short glass of brandy and judging by the red blush on his cheeks, it’s not the first glass he's had that night.
And a Circle Changeup to round out his trifecta.
“Then we lose,” Tony states through gritted teeth.
There is suddenly a lot more focus on Steve now. It gets to the point that Peggy has to field out a few of the more personal questions, reminding the media to stick to the parameters set beforehand. Steve isn't sure why his current marital status is that important to the papers, but he supposed not everyone gathered were from reputable sources.
Steve places a hand on his thigh and Tony shoves his arm away, getting to his feet. He ignores the ache in his chest and paces halfway across the room, needing to put the distance between them. Steve stands as well but doesn’t attempt to come any closer. “Tony… We shouldn’t have to be ashamed anymore. I know you didn’t want me to come out because you were scared for what it meant for both of us—”
He sees Tony's back as he sits on a lounge chair on the balcony, a cigarette in one hand. Steve slides the door open, Tony glancing lazily over his shoulder. As soon as he sees it's Steve, he sits up to yell back into the suite. "Hey, no one is supposed to—"
“Tony,” Steve balks at him as the woman slides open the little glass door and gives Tony all of his chips. “That’s insane.”
“You caveman. Fire bad,” Tony replies sarcastically but picks up the glass and dutifully downs the whole thing in a few chugs, wiping his hand off on the back of his mouth. He starts to actually look around the apartment now, Steve realizing it’s the first time Tony’s ever been over to his place. He doesn’t really have any guests other than Bucky, but he’s at least glad the flat is relatively clean and organized. “What are you reading?” He asks suddenly.
(See the end of the chapter for
He does make the time to excuse himself, going back to his hotel room to call Bucky. Of course, his longest friend had known as soon as it happened, always staying on top of the games. Honestly, he’s kind of similar to Tony in that sense, somehow always knowing what’s going on. They end up talking for an hour, just catching up and reminiscing in some of their memories from big moments like this that they had when playing for the Stars. Emotions heightened from the events, Steve has trouble not breaking down and sobbing on the phone. He’s not quite sure how he manages to keep himself past hysteria, eventually saying goodbye so he can go back and celebrate with his team.
“Carol is fine. And he better,” she throws a wink Tony’s way. “It’s nice to finally meet you too. Nick speaks very highly of you as well. Congrats on your Championship win this season, by the way.”
, immediately twisting around so he can get a better angle on the kiss and deepen it.
“Go on, impress him,” Dr. Erskine said, nodding in Steve’s direction. “You’re already doing an extra set of every exercise since the last time Rogers was here. Just take your time and show him how much you’ve improved.”
As always, comments and kudos appreciated!! Hopefully I'll get chapter 3 up in the next week or two. ❤️ Thanks for reading!
Maybe Howard was right about the sharp-eyed teenager that Steve had first seen in an interview from four years ago. A cocky, self-righteous child who had been spoiled to believe he’d been blessed with pietistic abilities that no other player could touch. But that isn’t the Tony sitting across from him in this diner today, poor-postured and vulnerably exhausted.
, entering Tony one last time and feeling his entire body jolt with the force of it. Tony calling Steve’s name echoes in the room around them, the sound helping Steve over that edge as they come together. Tony’s muscles squeeze him impossibly tight as he jerks his hips upward with a renewed vigor, emptying himself inside of the man. Tony comes, completely untouched, spurting his seed between them, streaks of it landing on both their chests.
“Thank god you’re okay,” Steve breathed out, still holding his face. “The doctors said you woke up yesterday morning but I had just run out to get breakfast for Peggy and I—”
Tony is still yelling for Steve to stop when he pries the younger man's fingers away from the knob, forcing the door open. "I'm sorry, Tony, but I have to—" Steve freezes when he stumbles onto the scene.
He swallows and steps aside so the next person can be helped, rasping out a quiet thank you before taking his seat. He sits with his head in his hands, staring down between his feet.
He turns, slowly, to face Tony again, taking him all in. He opens his mouth to speak and Steve holds up a hand, side-stepping towards a chair. “Just… Shut up. For a second.”
“Do I look like I’m laughing?”
He was almost grateful when the news came that he would be moving down to the Triple-A league. Despite moving up in the ranks, one league at a time, Triple-A was the one league Steve never played in. The Stars had called him up after four seasons of playing in the Double-As, so he had skipped right over the top league in the Minors.
"Mom, you've never made hors d’oeuvres in your life," Tony sighs, wearing a warm smile.
Steve stands at the sidelines with Natasha, assisting in her duties to be third-base coach, something not really practiced much in the minors, but it never hurt to have the added assistance during Spring Training. Steve doesn’t try and strike up conversation, her green eyes like steel for the entire duration of the second-half of their double-header.
Tony notices the slight change in his batter’s stance right as the pitch is thrown, and he internally curses. He takes off again, no time to think or look back as his batter hits a ground ball towards the shortstop. They both have to act quickly as baserunners right now, because if either of them are out, then that’s it. The ball bounces almost too perfectly, right in front of where the shortstop had run forward to. It bounced high in the air, going right over his head and practically out of reach. He fumbles with it in the air and rather than fire it towards first, turns and tries to get it home.
“Yeah, and you shouldn't be,” Steve says with a smirk before setting the remote down and looking past Tony next to the woman massaging his shoulder. “Hi, Dr. Cho. He giving you too much trouble?”
that.”
Suddenly, all the electricity in the apartment cuts out, a loud burst of electrical energy suddenly shutting off resounding around the apartment. There’s sounds of confusion from all the people in the room, as well as a few startled yelps at the sudden blackout. Tony turns semi-blinded and reaches for Steve, grabbing him by the collar and pulling him down into a kiss.
Tony zones out as Thor prattles on about his newest obsession with astronomy or astrology— he’s not quite sure which one— staring at the back of Steve’s blonde head. Playing with Rogers and the rest of the Avengers for the past year and a half had started to change him in a way he hasn’t expected. He held years of resentment for the fallen golden boy from the Brooklyn Stars and a couple of seasons of playing under him wasn’t going to cure that. But Tony has learned to
“I had Bruce and Rhodes give me some input too,” Steve says bashfully. “When I called this place to rent out the whole thing, I think the owners were surprised to hear you were turning twenty-three, not twelve.”
Whitaker shakes his head, looking back down at the roster with a furrowed brow. "I'll see what I can do. And Stark?"
“Yeah, yeah, I’m just getting some air,” Steve waves them off, slipping out into the hallway.
” he told Steve after having to start over from fourteen months sober, ruined by a single beer he instinctively grabbed while tinkering in his workshop that turned into ten beers to follow. “
The more Steve realizes how people see Tony, the more he’s able to sympathize with the kid. Steve has dealt with his fair share of being held to unrealistic expectations, but it isn’t nearly to the extent that Tony is forced into. Steve is constantly trying to rise up to fill the image of a proper leader, an All-American, wholesome athlete that young children look up to and adult spectators can respect. No matter what Tony does, it seems like he’s shown in a negative light, to the point where even the people who are supposed to stand by him shun him as soon as he exhibits the behaviors that have already been assumed. Tony’s headstrong and pushes back at the first sight of opposition because he’s so used to being written-off before he’s even given the chance to show people what he’s capable of.
Steve follows after the Starks, his eyes glancing Tony's way as they fall into step behind his parents. Howard hadn't even so much as looked at Tony, let alone greet his son in any way. Any affection Tony carried in his expression thanks to Maria now melts into an unreadable impasse as they walk through the halls.
His last pitch is a Sinker, a feeble ploy to try and convince Steve he could swing on it. The Captain’s position remains true, the ball coming down and too close to his thigh to be even close to a fair pitch.
Bucky’s right. They take the World Series.
The roster usually has around thirty players accounting for possible call-ups and injuries, but thirteen of those players are actually chosen by fans, media, and the coaches. There isn't a doubt in Tony's mind that he won't get chosen to play, no matter who it's left up to. He has an enormous fan base, he's the media's darling, and even if he wasn't Howard Stark's son, the managers and coaches throughout the Pacific League would have to be fools not to want him on their All-Star team. The rest of the seventeen players would be chosen by the league owners just to fill out the roster for possible substitutes.
Honestly, Tony doesn't see what is so special about the guy. His father's voice is echoing in his head,
He hears his house guest come tromping back down the stairs, the banister squeaking in protest while he swings around it like he’s in a musical and comes bounding towards the kitchen in the back of the house.
Tony swallows.
A whistle blows and Steve still doesn’t move for a few moments as the Stars move off the field and the Mockingbirds begin to take their places. “Steve… Hey, Steve,” Dugan gets his attention with an arm around his shoulders. “Come on, you’re almost on deck. Keep your head in it, kid, I’ll get Hodge to sub you out but let’s get shit done first, okay?”
"Um, is Tony in?" Steve asks, immediately feeling bad about the broken lock.
Tony follows behind Steve as they drive to their destination. Steve can see the skepticism on his face before they even get out of their respective cars when he sees where he’s taken him. “You know, when you said Italian, I thought we were thinking a little more upscale pasta joint, not a pizza place at an abandoned strip mall.”
Tony doesn’t beat around the bush, piercing Steve with his unwavering eye contact. “I came back to play one last season with you.”
He doesn’t hear anything for a few moments before Tony walks into the foyer, carrying a book in his hands. “Morning,” he says noncommittally, not looking up from the worn paperback in his hands.
"It's amazing. I'm so used to looking out windows and seeing nothing but city," Steve replies honestly, tearing his gaze away from the setting sun on the horizon as a man enters the room with a cart carrying a pitcher of water, a couple of bottles of wine, and a bottle of brandy.
Tony jumps off the bench when Steve’s thumb brushing against the top of his spine makes all the hairs on the nape of his neck stand up, ignoring the shock that went through him from the touch. He’s too keyed up right now to pay any mind to a touch that’s meant to be soothing that only puts him further on edge. “I’m not putting faith in
Peggy's smile was bashful now and she waves a hand. "Thank you, thank you. It's a shame that Chester's condition has only worsened, but I'm very happy he chose to leave the team in my hands rather than just sell it off to the top bidder."
Having to be escorted through a mansion by a butler was almost too much for Steve to handle tonight. "That's alright," he admonished awkwardly. "I'll find my way, thanks."
Dove swings back around to their table a couple of minutes later, her eyes darting over to the bathroom door. “You two doin’ alright over here?” She asks, a slightly nervous lilt to her voice. “Can I get you anything else?”
Tony huffs out a laugh, shaking his head slightly. “That's just for show; I don’t play.”
Predictably, Natasha grabs them both by the ears and scolds them for showing up late, hurrying them into their uniforms after accepting Tony’s clean bill of health from Dr. Cho. He’s not batting today, but Natasha has him slated to pitch all nine innings as long as he can handle it. And he will.
or fucking, whatever you two want to call it
Steve puts on one of his favorite records, Attica Blues by Archie Shepp. Passionate tenor sax fills the small apartment as Steve starts digging around in the fridge for materials to make any sort of meal with. They really need to go grocery shopping since it seems like their current stash is mostly condiments at this point.
“—It’s okay, Captain Rogers, really! I don’t want to bother him if he’s resting!”
What starts as an attempt to build a human barricade to keep the two away from each other soon descends into chaos when there are a few too many limbs attached to a few too many inebriated bodies involved. Natasha and Rhodey are combining efforts to try and drag Tony away from the brawl, Clint and Quill are caught in a scrap with Irons players who came to Hammer’s defense, and even the third-party players who are attempting to diffuse the situation start to accidentally tousle with one another in the confusion. Drinks are flying and it’s near impossible to tell whether or not it’s accidental.
“Don’t take it personally,” Steve sighs, oiling up his glove. “He’s been stubborn about his elbow since we were kids. You’re not just preaching to the choir, Doc—” Steve tosses the oil back in before shutting his locker and brushing past the man. “You’re preaching to the whole damn congregation.”
“Oh,” Steve breathes out in surprise, bracing his hands against the wall and letting his head go slack. Warm water rushes down the back of his neck and along his jawline, dripping down onto Tony who doesn’t seem to mind. His eyes are closed as he bobs his head, Steve quickly hardening in that hot channel.
“I’m down here, dipshit!” Tony yells from the kitchen, his eggs quickly turning from over easy to completely scrambled as he gives up on trying to recover his breakfast.
“I think you were doing okay,” Steve places his hand on a comfortable position around her waist, taking her other hand in his. He’s never been a big dancer, but Natasha seems to know what she’s doing and is probably able to make his stepping in a circle look a lot more impressive than it is.
“I’m about to play a
“I’ll tell
Janet sighs and digs a folded piece of paper out of her jacket pocket. She scans it for a moment before putting it away. "Room 2071," she sighs.
Tony likes Thor more than he thinks he would have upon first glance. He still doesn’t know the guy’s real name— some impossible-to-pronounce Norwegian moniker. He’d been fondly nicknamed after the Norse God of Thunder because of the unmistakable power he had to his swing, mimicking a clap of thunder that rocks the stadium every time he hits the ball.
“If you have any more issues,” Natasha interrupts. “You can take it up with Fury or Van Dyne, okay? This wasn’t my decision. All I know is that from where I sit, we needed a star pitcher and now we have one. My job isn’t to make sure Steve Rogers’ life is all sunshine and rainbows every single day. My job is to keep you lot in shape so The Avengers can keep winning games, got it?” She brushes her hair back from her face in frustration. “I’m sorry you weren’t made aware of this before today, I really am, but now you know and as captain of this team I expect you to be professional and move forward with this decision.”
Ty scoffs, shaking his head as he turns his back on him and heads for the door. “You still lose, Tony. You can be as bitter as you want from the sidelines while
,” She chastises, dragging his name out in that way she always did. “This is going to be a PR nightmare. Can’t you just play nice for this one game? All you have to do is go back out there and sit on the bench and look supportive for the rest of the team. We can spin it that you were just frustrated about an injury or something— You needed to get some air.” Tony keeps walking forward, ignoring his manager. “Listen, I know maybe the game didn’t go how you wanted it to, but you had an amazing three innings! There are going to be a ton of reporters wanting to interview you, and there’s the dinner after the game with
“I remember when they were that age,” Clint sighs from the next table over. “Cherish it while you can. You’ll be missing the changing of diapers and three a.m. crying sessions before you know it.”
“Sure. Do you know if your parents are around? I’d like to say goodbye and thank them again for dinner.”
“Our friends are right— not that you’re ‘too young to retire’ or any of that. I know the only reason you came back to play in the minors was so we could play together again, but even after I left… you stayed.”
“You sure haven’t made it easy on me,” she teases, catching him in the ribs with an elbow. “But… the team is gonna miss you.”
The Ninth feels like it stretches on forever. Maybe that’s just how Tony feels since he’s not in the batting lineup. It’s agonizing as calls are contested, plays get reviewed and then re-reviewed again, last-minute substitutes are running on and off the field, Obie and Rezzo both critical of each other’s lineup cards, arguing with the Umpires. It goes back and forth. The IL scores a run, but the next player hits a pop fly that’s easily caught by the PCL’s defense. One of their players gets tagged out while running home, a blow that’s quickly soothed by their second run scored, brining the game to a tie.
. It’s a win on all sides, right? No flack from the media for kicking me off the team because I’m gay, but all the close-minded fans will be happy someone like me won’t have anymore game time. They can always just fall back on the excuse of my injuries keeping me from the active roster. Me getting the shit kicked out of me was the perfect scapegoat to fall into Pierce’s lap so The Knights have no blood on their hands.”
Natasha smiles cruelly. "You know what? You changed my mind. We can negotiate." She points at the pitcher's mound. "You're going to pitch a ball to every single player on this team. Every ball they hit is an extra fifteen minutes on today's practice for you."
Gabe turns to Jaques sheepishly to let him reloop his tie. Steve double checks his own appearance, making sure nothing is amiss. He's never done a press event before. There's been the occasional short interview before games, but this is a much bigger deal.
“Yes, well, I wonder where he might’ve gotten that from, dear,” Maria says. Even though she’s smiling, it comes across cold.
“So...” Steve opens in such a painfully conversational tone that he’s already dreading the conversation that he knows is about to follow. “You never told me how your meeting with Janet the other day went.”
“Hey, Tony?”
“Uncle Tony!” Monica is the first to jump out of her seat and fly up the steps to launch herself at him. He’s ready for it, kneeling down to catch her and spin her around in his arms.
“Call a timeout, I need to talk to him.”
Steve just snorts and busies himself with the menu. “You’re absolutely ridiculous, you know that right? And here I thought I was the one who was going to come across as overcompensating.”
“You can’t blame yourself for that,” Bucky scolds, slinging an arm over the back of their booth. “Some people don’t wanna be helped, y’know?”
Tony searches his face, mouth set in a tight line. “That’s different. It’s because I was back with you guys. But now…” he sighs, staring off at their nearby friends, many of which have retired or moved onto other teams and other leagues. “It’s not the same anymore.”
“Bet five grand on red,” he dares.
“Barnes, I really think you should at least let me take a look—”
Career-wise, it’s a great time for Tony. His talent and successful plays are constantly headlining in the sports world, the buzz never quite dying down around the already infamous player who has finally joined the big leagues. Whether he wants to admit it or not… He’s actually
It’s a bright day in New York. The light of the sun is diffused but undeterred by the thin stretch of clouds covering the grey sky that stretches out above the stadium in front of Steve. He walks into the Polo Grounds with a renewed confidence that this is going to be a remarkable season.
They’re finally at the point where the rest of the team will now be joining them for practices, all of which Tony has yet to meet. He has no disillusions that this will be anything like the Avengers, but even if the Knights don’t become like a second family to them, he hopes they won’t be as cold as the Irons had felt.
passed, I think you should take a step back—"
Howard's cool exterior distinguishes as soon as he reaches out to shake Steve's hand, rather vigorously. "It's
Steve resists the urge to roll his eyes. “You know I’m on the good doctor’s side, Buck. If he wants to look at your elbow, I think you should let him.”
“I’ll join you in a bit. I think I owe Nat a dance,” he smiles, allowing his boyfriend to part from his side and put a little space between them. Hopefully the less perceptive guests won’t have noticed their joint disappearance.
Tony’s mouth is immediately on his own, tasting of sugary sweet peppermint and spiced rum. He barely has time to flick the pictures onto the coffee table before he has a lap full of Tony, the other man wasting no time in straddling one of his thighs as he surges forward.
"Funny, people don't normally frown that much when they're glad," Tony responds, smirking up at his coach.
here in the Majors. Everyone is fighting for a spot on that roster, and there are some games where even Tony ends up bench warming.
He would like to think it isn’t like that between them. Surely Tony can’t fake the kind of connection they’ve had these past few days. All the sidelong glances, the tender touches, quiet moments just spent in each other’s company. Tony is such a lonely person that Steve can’t imagine
As much as Steve pokes fun at Tony likening machines to people, he might just be onto something there.
Steve is playing darts with Bucky, Falsworth, and Dernier when they hear the stereo stop and turn to see Peggy standing atop one of the tables with a beer in her hand, shouting for everyone to quiet down.
. There are enough opposing forces that bear down on their relationship already, and if they have to add the distance and contrary schedules to that, Tony can’t imagine how things will last.
“Well I want to reopen it,” Steve insists, shifting a little to fix his stare on Tony who reluctantly opens his eyes. “Tony, I want to come out too.”
Tony winks as she goes, his eyes following her all the way into the kitchen. Steve snaps his fingers to bring him back down to earth. Tony smirks at him. “Jealous?”
The room takes a moment to stop spinning as he twists around to view his friendly assailant, his face immediately lighting up. “Pep!” He cries out, drunkenly grabbing her by the face and laying kisses across both cheeks at least a dozen times. “Oh my god, you made it. I’m so happy to see you,” he gushes.
The table erupts into cheers, Tony feeling elated gazes turn in his direction and a few hands reaching out to give him a congratulatory pat on the back or shake of the shoulder. He ignores it all to watch Steve’s expression, not seeing any shock or euphoria, instead only getting a close-mouthed smile stretching across Steve’s lips, his eyes closing as he gives a small shake of his head. Tony knows the look well by this point: an understated, amused disbelief at his antics. A mirthful grin he’s trying to fight to try and preemptively avoid an I-told-you-so.
"Howard,
Tony and Steve both stare after her before looking at each other. “Well… that happened,” Tony says.
“There are far worse things in life than being sandwiched between two beautiful redheads,” Tony replies before a loud interruption comes from somewhere behind him.
He’s been treading water ever since.
Before he can stop himself he’s streaking across the field, blowing right past a referee, Natasha, and the Irons’ third baseman who’s coming over to help. “Steve!” He drops down to his knees beside the man who’s still laying on his side. “Steve, are you okay? Can you get up?” He asks frantically, reaching out to help him back to his feet.
"Ignore him," Bruce sighs, shoving Clint against the wall so he has something to lean against. "He's completely wasted."
to see you go, Tony, myself especially. As many grey hairs as you’ve given me, I’d take a million more if it meant you could stay with us for a few more seasons,” she fixes melancholy eyes on him, reaching out to squeeze his arm. “I’m going to miss you, Tony.”
Tony returns a second later, apparently picking up some renewed vigor along the way as he plops down next to Steve, crossing his legs. He fiddles with the golden band now back on his ring finger as he looks over the selection, eventually dragging the carton of pork dumplings over first.
It's a Stars tradition to go to Kurtzberg’s at the end of the season. Steve goes over to his locker, right next to Bucky's, and changes into his street clothes. "Going straight to Kurtz’s?" Bucky asks. "The boys are trying to rally together a carpool and we're running out of seats."
Tony’s less abrasive when he asks him a direct question or gives him a suggestion during warm-ups or between innings. It’s not until Dallas that they actually play a game together for the first time.
Tony’s full on glaring down at his plate now, mashing a lemon wedge into a pulp with one of the many fancy forks provided. Maybe trying to shine a positive light on the kid’s behavioral issues wasn’t the best method. Steve really has no idea how to handle Tony, on or off the field.
“Oh my god,
Tony sighs, knowing the jig is up. “Coach, I really just needed—”
The first batter takes his place. Tony’s lucky, because it’s Longoria, his old teammate who he’s seen at bat hundreds of times in hundreds of situations. He hardly needs to think about it, the process almost happening automatically as he works out the perfect pitching pattern in his brain.
Anyhoo, I can make no promises on when I will update next, but I am SO dedicated to getting this fic done as soon as possible without fully frying my brain because of it. I will hopefully be on a once a 2-3 week upload schedule, but forgive me if I don't manage that over the holidays. I'm going to do my best and really do apologize it took so long to get this chapter out.
Steve stands awkwardly in the quiet now, slowly drifting closer. “What time is it?”
That single action comes back to bite Tony in the ass. He just isn’t expecting it to happen so soon.
Steve smiles. “I’m fine with anything, but I am more of a steak and potatoes kind of guy.”
“I grew up around it,
“Because I wanted to see you. I wanted to be with you,” he corrects, confident now in his honesty. He meets Tony’s gaze again, hand instinctively reaching up to brush a limp lock of hair back from the man’s forehead. He lets his hand drift down, settling on cupping Tony’s face gently against his palm. He can feel a bit of two-day-old stubble against the heel of his hand, his thumb resting against his ear while the rest of his fingers curl attentively into the short hair on the nape of his neck. He leans forward, lips barely parting to ask, “Can I—?”
He feels two fingers on the center of his chest, numbly tapping three times.
“I’ll get the order in. Be right back with water and tea,” she smiles at them before disappearing into the kitchen.
After he tags the base, he looks up at Steve, tipping his baseball cap up a bit to get a good read. They make eye contact for a few tense moments, Steve the first to break it, focusing back on the game at hand. Tony's turning over his options for a sarcastic remark, but Steve surprises him by speaking first.
He leans down to let Tony loosen his tie and yank it off over the top of his head, mouths messily clashing as Steve drags him into a kiss if only to slow his frantic lover. He drops his hands to Tony’s belt, slowly undoing it and dragging it out of the loops, his hand teasing along the seam of his zipper where he can feel Tony’s hardness underneath.
"Yeah," Tony holds it at eye level, turning it back and forth before setting it back down. "You don't have to pretend to be interested. I know your brain probably runs on possible plays and defensive line-ups."
“Well, to start, it’s just you and me here Coach, you don’t have to say
"Is the bouncing baby billionaire in twouble?" Clint slurs with an exaggerated pout, hanging onto Natasha for dear life. She slides his arm off her shoulders and he almost slams his face into the bar after losing the only support keeping him upright.
“Oh, shut up.”
"Well no one's more capable than you. Chester made the right decision," his smile fades a little. "So he's not doing so well, huh?"
or moreso for the lack of words he had wanted to hear. “I just wanted him to tell me to stay. That he’d be hurt if I had to leave.”
Steve grabs him by the back of his jeans and pulls him back down before he hurts himself or breaks something. “What, I’m curious!” He laughs. “You talked about hating my guts growing up, so I’m sensing a disconnect somewhere.”
Steve scoffs, rolling his eyes up towards the ceiling. “This might be surprising to hear, but breaking up with me and disappearing for a while did
The balcony is freezing this high up, a light dusting of snow still clinging to the railing and the concrete outside. He has a throw blanket from inside wrapped around him, but it does little to protect him from the cold. He does his best to try and shield his lighter as he attempts to light the end of his cigarette, but the blistering winds continually put the flame out.
“Steve,” Tony interrupts, wincing slightly as he sits down on the bed, not quite crawling under the covers yet. He’s been doing nothing but laying down for two weeks, and if standing didn’t take so much damn effort, he’d happily keep doing that. “I… I don’t think you should stay.”
Steve rubs his eyes as they walk off the stage, the bright flashes of the cameras leaving sunspots in his vision. The papers were probably going to be full of group shots of the Stars’ lead players with Steve blinking like an idiot. He feels a warm hand on his back and turns to see Peggy.
“You’re drunk, Tony!” Steve yells at him, trying to wrestle him into submission. “Cut it out
“Stay down,” He advises Hammer’s unconscious body before stepping over it to join the rest of the Avengers in ushering a belligerent Tony away from the scene.
"Can you just promise me we won't bring Hammer? That guy is such a douchebag, and he totally blew it last year."
“Strike one!”
Steve sighs. "I'm sorry. That's all." He's sure Natasha is checking her watch right now so he makes haste in getting to the parking lot. She doesn't say anything as he gets onto the bus, sitting in a row by himself.
“Pretty sure that doesn’t apply to
He feels his chilled body warm to the sound of
Thankfully, no one finds it odd that Steve will be dropping Tony off last thanks to the fact that their apartments are the closest together. Driving for a bit with the windows down and forcing plenty of water down Tony’s gullet has helped him back off the precipice of total belligerence to a much more manageable half-past tipsy.
The cacophonous roar of the crowd drowns out the announcers as they always do to the players down on the field. Steve never listens anyway, always finding it as more of a distraction than anything else. There is no way they could let the Serpents get another run. As soon as they get one, they’re that much closer to being tied and that’s when the team is going to start falling apart.
enough for you?! Oh, there goes Tony again, throwing his tantrums
“Just the last few years. I graduated high school early and started playing in the rookies. Was only there for one season before I was recruited to be an Avenger,” he seems to choke on the last word slightly, admiration shining in his eyes. So he’s not just a fan of Tony’s then.
"Largest in the U.S.," Howard is quick to point out. "Most generous woman on earth in my eyes."
The starters are already taking up their positions in the field, Tony rushing to grab his mitt from the dugout and get to the pitcher’s mound. As the home team, they’ll defend at the top half of the inning and then go on the offense. His own spot on the batting roster will be filled by designated hitters today, Natasha not wanting to risk any additional strain or injury since Tony is determined to pitch for all nine innings. It’s a trade off he’s not happy with, but willing to take to keep a hand on the wheel at all times.
He starts asking every teammate of theirs he sees if they've seen Tony, no one knowing for sure where the pitcher ran off to. He double checks the bathrooms, the lobby, and the outside patio where he bumps into Rhodey.
“Steve,” Natasha calls after him.
Bucky is still glaring at the wall, but he eventually takes a deep breath and starts to rotate his arm. Dr. Erskine is holding it gingerly at the wrist and elbow, keeping it as straight as it can currently bend as he twists his forearm slowly, back and forth. Steve can see his arm is shaking, but he gets through all five rotations before Erskine allows him to put the brace back on. “See? You’re almost up to a full ninety degrees. Isn’t that good, Steve?”
thing he wants.
“We need a call,” the referee says quietly to Natasha and the medic amidst the arguing.
Steve almost drops the barbell on his chest. The weights tip to one side and Tony dodges out of the way while Thor, his spotter, grabs the barbell from him and carefully sets it on the rack. Steve sits up, a little out of breath. "What?"
“How old are you again, Steve?” the question from Peggy is a surprise.
Hammer holds up his hands. “Whoa, there! No need for the hostility, buddy! I’m just making a statement. We were all sharing some stories about our dear friend Tony, weren’t we?” He stares around the group with wide eyes, now holding his hands innocently over his heart. “I just wanna express how happy I am that your new teammates don’t judge you for being a faggot.”
Tony bumps into him as he shoulders past to pick up his... whatever it was. Some kind of contraption with propellers on it. Tony's muttering to himself under his breath, walking over to plop it down on a table. He scoops some kind of handheld remote control off the ground as well, placing it next to his flying doohickey. They're almost the same size, the remote having about five different joysticks and twenty different buttons in it in addition to a huge antenna sticking out of it.
Peter is staring at him openly, mouth hanging open ever so slightly as he looks at Tony like he personally provides the air he breathes. Tony raises his eyebrows slightly as the silence stretches on, looking between Steve and the seemingly catatonic kid. “Hey, you must be Peter,” he greets, looking the kid up and down. He has a similar build to Tony when he first started playing ball, slim and a bit gangly beneath his faded Nintendo t-shirt and flannel tied around his waist.
The amount of remaining Avengers dwindles further as Steve remains in the showers, catching Tony’s naked figure out of his periphery as he finally makes his way over. There’s only a few players left, plenty of available showerheads. Tony takes a stall on the opposite wall of Steve’s, in the far corner of the room. Every time Steve throws a cursory glance over his shoulder, doing his best to be subtle about it, Tony is still facing away from him, humming a random tune to himself as he lathers up with soap and starts to scrub the day’s grime off of him.
“Why don’t you give him some advice on how to deal with me then, huh? The tried-and-true Howard Stark method?” Tony finally snaps, breaking his vow of silence. He tosses another broken leg onto the dish in the center of the table, Steve only just now noticing how much crab Tony had gone through in his efforts to remain quiet. The small mountain of hollow crab shells toppled and spilled onto the table, the integrity cracked by the figurative final straw on the camel’s back. “Although I’m not sure Rogers will see the value in getting trashed and smacking me around a few times whenever I so much as
I don't even know what to say other than thank you for reading and giving feedback. I love this story SO MUCH and I've never been so inspired or written so much content that I love for a pairing I love as much as Stony. I'll see you guys soon for the epilogue and am so happy any of you have given this niche little fic a chance. <333
“We’re going to be okay, Tony. We all knew coming in that the PCL’s defensive line-up is statistically stronger than ours. Rezzo was expecting this, you have to have faith in him,” he tries to reason, his hand moving to rub comfortingly against the back of Tony’s neck, holding him there.
“Now, Tony,” the interviewer directs his attention again. “Is there anything else you’d like to say about today’s game before we cut to inside the Stadium where the players are getting ready for the big game?”
“Eigh— Erm, nineteen,” he answers sheepishly.
“Nothing sweet for ya today?” she asks, leaning her body forward in such a way that Steve feels it necessary to avert his eyes to save his own dignity rather than hers.
,” he pulls a face, comically pulling at his collar.
Tony’s right, he is alone right now, but he still has plans tomorrow to drive upstate and spend Christmas Day with Bucky. Tony doesn’t have anyone after an impossibly tough year. Impulsively, Steve hangs up the phone and immediately goes over to the door to pull his snow boots back on. In his surprise to speak to Tony at all, Steve realizes he also completely forgot to thank him for such a thoughtful gift. He places the camera back in the box and tucks it under one arm, haphazardly throwing on his scarf and hat before exiting the apartment.
He places a hand on Tony’s chest and lifts himself up slightly, hovering above him on the couch. He hates himself for doing it, but he can’t let himself get too caught up in the physical aspect of things and endanger how he really feels. “I… I think I need to take things slow.” He smiles sheepishly. “You okay with that? This is all still very,
"Oh, excuse m—" Steve blinks, utterly shocked. "Peggy?"
Almost imperceptible smile lines now appear around his mouth and the crinkle at the edge of his eyes, another noticeable line between his eyebrows from all the furrowing he did while tinkering and inventing. Strands of premature grey shimmer in the light right around his temples, a stark contrast against the deep brown of his shorter-cut hair. His facial hair is a little more managed as well, cultivated into a sharp goatee that’s spotting the same salt-and-pepper treatment. It makes him look refined, although part of Steve wants to start his due diligence of firing back the old man jokes Tony used to throw at him so cavalier. His skin is nicely tanned as well, clearly coming off of some vacation to somewhere much sunnier than New York is in the winter months, the little freckles and sunspots on his nose and cheeks darkened and much more noticeable now. Steve wants to run his finger along them and watch his nose scrunch up in response beneath his touch, Tony’s laugh echoing clearly in his mind.
Hammer does it again, a second curveball that is slower than the first, but still dips out of reach.
Tony ends up letting Steve pick where they go first as they make their way through the crowded streets, the sun having just set. There are already plenty of inebriated tourists and locals alike bumping into each other, people in all sorts of crazy outfits coming from and going to the different shows around the area.
Steve immediately reaches back and grabs Tony by the wrist, bringing his hand forward to show that he had the hotel keys sandwiched between two of his fingers. Rather than take the keys back again, he drops Tony’s wrist, letting him have this win. “Only because if I don’t come with you, you’ll be out until ungodly hours getting absolutely trashed.”
Bruce looks at Steve imploringly. "Are you okay? Is Tony?" The others in the elevator are still arguing about who's the biggest lightweight and aren't listening to their conversation. Steve is quiet, unsure of how to answer. "I saw you running around looking for him. You looked— You
The next day’s practice gets rained out, but Steve had already planned on heading to the Stadium gym to work out his knee. Dr. Cho has been staying on top of him about his ACL, making sure he was still working it out regularly to build the strength back up while also taking the appropriate breaks from overuse.
“It’s beautiful…” Steve leans in closer, coming to a stop with his nose pressed alongside Tony’s. They share breaths for a moment, Steve letting Tony make the decision to break through the last inch of space separating them. Tony kisses him as gingerly as he had played the song, no overtly sexual energy in the exchange, but the same butterflies are stirred up in Steve's stomach. He breaks the kiss, resting his forehead against Tony’s. “Will you play some more?”
years.”
Steve sets a hard gaze on Tony.
“Oh shut up,” Steve huffs, covering Tony’s face with his hand and shoving him away. “I’m starting to regret having this conversation.”
at him. Broad and toothy, that familiar glint in his eye before he becomes a blur. Movement as quick and agile as a feral cat, he tears towards third base
Steve’s eyes flicker with sadness, but they don’t stray from Tony’s face. “I’m glad I could be that person for you who made you start to love baseball. Before we were together, before we were even friends, I saw something in you that everyone else seemed to want to ignore. I want the world to see how special you really are. And of course leagues and awards and fame don’t really mean much in the grand scheme of things, but it would kill me to watch you keep playing below your level, especially if you were just staying for… for me.”
He’s surprised to see a genuine smile break out of Tony’s steely expression, lifting them out of this sea of sensual abandon into something a little easier to manage. Just two people, two bodies, together at last. “Don’t worry about me for right now. Just let me make
It hardly counts considering they’re both in the outfield, right and left wing. Steve knows Natasha’s trying to move Tony around and feel out how he does in every position, but it’s clear the outfield is not a good fit for him. As proficient of a player as he is, Tony shines more with accuracy and prioritization in strategy. Being a fielder is a more static position, meant to be support. It’s not much of a surprise that Tony gets subbed out pretty early on, not having the arm strength to be able to get the ball all the way into the infield without needing to use their center as a middle man. There’s only a single inning of crossover between them with basically no interaction considering there’s rarely a reason for passes to be made between their positions.
There are still boxes pushed into corners and spare closets, framed but unhung graphic design art pieces leaning against the walls and stacked on top of each other. The bookshelves around the place are full but unorganized, and the furnishings only look passable because of the interior designers he had hired to fix up the place. It still doesn’t really feel like
