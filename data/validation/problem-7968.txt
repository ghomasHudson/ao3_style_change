They didn't look like a family unit, but they treated the space, and each other, with an ease that spoke of well-worn familiarity.
mortals?" said Steve, teetering on the verge of hysteria.
Soon enough, Stark's hand was behind his head, lifting him up, and Stark's dick was in his face. A few strokes took him to full erection, and Steve willingly opened his mouth for it, sucked it right in.
"And now, for trying to run away." Stark held up the empty glass like a toast. "I'm going to remind you where you'd be without me."
"From the way the old man went on about you, I would have thought you were pure sex in spandex. Hell, I'm shocked he didn't have a go himself, at this tight ass."
Steve's arms were still free, but even as he flailed them, he held back from trying to push these people off of him. His body was crying out for air, he wanted more than anything to grab the intrusion cutting him off, but he knew he couldn't, he knew it would bring him a world of pain if he tried to push this woman away, and so he just took it, choking and groaning.
As he began to writhe in his restraints, heedless of the leather digging into his flesh, she touched her ear and murmured something.
Instead of another strike, it was Stark's hand that fell onto his shoulder, but he still jerked and whimpered at the touch.
Stark's room
"Yeah, I get it," Stark snapped, cutting off another lecture that seemed to be building. "I'll head out in ten." The phone was still haranguing him when he hung up and dropped it in the cart. "That means this thing is going inside you in five, one way or another."
The heart monitor was going a mile a minute now, and a couple nurses were coming over to investigate.
"Where?" Stark grinned. "Show me."
Day 28 (again): Hunting Season
"For the greater good," Steve croaked out. His voice sounded like the creak of a rusty old gate. "To serve my country."
When the room got into some kind of ruling debate, Steve couldn't take it anymore, and began to buck his hips backward, rocking himself against the intrusion, just to get it over with. Anything to get it out a little sooner.
The self-proclaimed god drew aside his robes, to present his cock for worship. It was long, and slender, and slightly curved. Steve had been a prisoner long enough to know what was expected of him now. Without having to be told, or forced, he took it into his mouth, and went down on it until it gagged him, bobbing his head over it, choking down more of it with each pull, until it drew tears to his eyes.
"Here, sweetheart." Stark took the straps from him and finished the job, pulling just a little too tight for it not to be malice.
"Goddamn, Nat," said Clint, just before he came with a groan. Then: "God. Damn."
"We're going to take a nice walk down to street level," Steve replied, already racing through it in his mind. A building like this had to have elevators. That would take forever, though, to get down all those floors, in an indefensible position—basically a metal box dangling from a wire. Maybe the stairs instead?
"Oh, very nice. Well, if you insist. Hold still for me."
A name, plain and final, a statement in itself.
Flopped onto his side of the bed, and pulled the covers up over himself. "Arms and legs," he yawned, waving vaguely. "Like a good boy."
"I don't understand," Steve gritted. "Can you help me, or not?"
When he pulled out, Steve could feel the come seeping from his hole.
"That's right," said Stark, "we spent a lot of cash fishing you out of the depths. You're welcome, by the way. You can start your repayment by giving me a proper thank you. For your life."
Straining for a new breath that wouldn't come, he looked upwards to see two gauntlets fly to Stark, intricate pieces flickering in an insect-like dance, fitting around his forearms like, well, a glove. Steve once again considered the idea that he might actually be centuries in the future, but it was a distant thought. The rest of him was wrestling with the collar that was choking the life out of him, unable to even dig his fingers under it to find a grip.
The metal bars were deceptively thin; Steve wasted a moment to test them: they felt ominously solid under his grip, and didn't bend under any force he could apply.
Instead of hurting him, the cool touch seemed to soothe the pain in his head. The ringing in his head went away, and the nausea with it, almost like Steve's concussion had been healed.
As she spoke, she threaded the purple tip of her cock into Steve's mouth, and he took it delicately, wrapping his lips around it. It tasted of plastic, clean and artificial, and was still warm. From his own ass, he realized.
But as he slammed into the corner in his haste to turn it, and then took way too long to gather himself and keep running, he heard behind him the distinct sound of pursuit.
As the door swung shut behind him, he sagged into the plush carpet, and tried to gather his wrecked thoughts. His cock was shamelessly hard, dribbling, hot as a brand when it brushed against his thigh.
"Is that how you get your kicks, you sick asshole?" he managed to gasp out. "Does whipping someone bloody turn you on?"
When the widest part made it inside, it was almost a relief. His muscles closed around it, sealing it in, and he was just left with the impressive, aching fullness. Stark tugged backwards a little, and the plug wouldn't come out. It just nestled there inside him, making its presence constantly, aggressively known. He could feel every dimension of it pressing against his walls—and against the devilish spot that had bewitched him earlier. He flexed a little, trying to push the plug out, and his knees would have buckled if he hadn't already been strapped in place.
He made it into the last minute this time, before he came again, sobbing brokenly. It hurt so much, he couldn't go through it again. But he hadn't been able to hold it, and the timer pitilessly reset.
Stark shouldn't have had that kind of strength—those gauntlets alone had to weigh a ton, and he was wearing them and dragging Steve at the same time.
When she came back, she was holding up two hands. One had a strip of black fabric dangling from it. The other held a syringe.
He'd never have that last dance with Peggy.
When his hand was released, Steve clutched it to himself, and couldn't answer around the nausea.
He was cut off. It seemed to go on interminably, Stark pounding into him, turning his air off and on like he was idly flipping a switch. Steve struggling fruitlessly every time, dragged down into a tunnel of pitch blackness, entire being narrowed down to nothing but the desperate need to breathe. When it was finally granted to him, he floated. The rest of the world came rushing back to him, the sensation unbearably intense, like he was suddenly jammed back into this body that was being fucked and assaulted and stimulated beyond its limits.
"Which will it be?" She lifted a sculpted eyebrow.
But for a brief moment, seeing Stark lying there, like a storybook monster slain, Steve had felt a long-dead spark ignite within him—a brief but vivid dream of freedom, one that he wasn't ready to give up yet.
Defeated, he wormed down on the bed until he could loop his bound ankles over the hook, where they caught unpleasantly. His arms, he stretched over his head, reaching blindly until felt his wrists catch as well. As soon as he was in place, the hooks tightened. He watched the one between his feet pull back into the panel, holding his bound ankles firmly in place, and imagined the other one doing the same above his head.
Oh god.
He knew that this latest performance was going on those videos too.
Shortly, Stark fell asleep.
As he came down from his orgasm, the shame began to set in. He was kneeling naked in the halls of his last kidnapper, and coming willingly for his next. Still marked with Stark's use, he was now covered in Loki's spend. He couldn't have looked or felt more disgusting. He tried to lower his head, but Loki's fingers caught him by the chin again, forced him to look up.
. A steady, regular beep pulsed somewhere near his head, and made him repeatedly wince. A number of bodies bustled around him—nurses?—some calling loudly, others pushing carts or carrying trays loaded with clattering metal instruments.
The sound of the door startled Steve's eyes open. "Wait!" he cried. "The collar? You said you'd take it off. Stark, please."
Steve thought his body should have fought back more, but he was limp with exhaustion, Stark had prepared him well, and the cock slid home like he'd been made to take it.
Eventually, Stark must have deemed him trained.
He noticed—but quite not soon enough to stop himself mid-stride, and stepped right in front of the open doorway, where he froze in horror.
Assuming that Stark's word was to be trusted, he had to keep it together. He had to hold out, had to end this. All he had to do was not come for fifteen minutes, for crying out loud. He wasn't a teenager anymore.
"No?" Stark's hand passed over his face again, and then it was Peggy standing there, still grinning luridly beneath her crown. There was even lipstick smeared on her bared teeth.
Well, he wasn't even sure why.
"Don't let me interrupt," said the nurse, giggling nervously. Steve wanted to die. "It's just, your IV got knocked out by your last, ah, visitor. The sedatives, you know..."
The alien blue glow.
Steve shook his head, and without warning, ice rose from the ground, with another great rippling crack. It swallowed his ankles, and when he tried to kick out against it, sent him careening forwards onto his knees after all. He caught the ground on the flat of his palms, and turned with an animal sort of desperation to pull at his feet, but they were encased in ice, so gut-wrenchingly cold on his bare skin, and it was crawling up his ankles, his knees, like a living thing.
Steve couldn't breathe with the collar on. He had to do this. He remembered how those fingers had traced lasciviously over his rump, and his lips tightened grimly. Got down on his hands and knees, and presented himself for Stark's gaze. He couldn't quite bring himself to slap his own ass, but it seemed to do the trick.
"Stark," Steve whimpered, actually whimpered. His teeth were chattering, his body starting to shiver under the cold assault. The ice was getting heavy, inches thick all over him, arms, neck, everywhere, and showed no sign of stopping. He was going to be buried alive. He was going to freeze all over again, and the nothingness that awaited was an old acquaintance that had never left him, but only waited there, patiently, with arms yawning wide open, ready to receive him.
of smut, but there's no sex in this chapter.
Steve looked over at the others, as if they would help him, or even take pity on him and untie him after Clint was through with him, but none of them looked his way, any more than they'd look at the bowl of popcorn they were snacking from. Clint was sitting a little ways off from the others, rather than sharing their couch space with them, aloof and distant. Steve had no way to get their attention, even if he could convince himself that was a good idea.
"Try and shock me now," Steve said into Stark's ear, pressing his naked body flush against the back of Stark's suit jacket. They were skin to skin, back to front. A shock would hurt Stark as much as it hurt Steve.
Where was he? How had he gotten into this position? And what had been that voice?
But not for long.
His first day, jerking himself off desperately on the carpet the second he had a chance, grinding his ass into the carpet.
Day 25: Disorientation
"I... I thought I could offer some tactical advice," Steve stammered. "I used to... In the army..."
Steve couldn't.
Steve hadn't even noticed the pain, but Stark kissed his palms mockingly. Steve didn't quite have the presence of mind to claw at his face before his hand was dropped.
"Oops," said the voice in Steve's ear. "He's more persistent than I thought. Best of luck, big boy."
Soon he was sobbing again, but it was to an altered tune, an entirely different sort of desperation and want. A new urgency was building within him, terrifying and shameful. He couldn't see a way to get out of these restraints, but he had to get away from that invasive touch. He couldn't let it... make him... well, he just
Steve woke on his knees.
Steve was sure his body was shutting down. In the numbing cold, he felt weightless, like his plane was plummeting down to Earth and he was at zero-g within. It might have happened years ago, it might have been centuries ago for all he knew, but for him it hadn't even been weeks. He'd been a hero, he'd had a life, he'd had Peggy, and Bucky, and then there was ice, and then, nothing.
It was liquid fire, running across his back.
He was already running on fumes, aching, sweating, clutching the meager of his bedsheet around himself. Every hurried step sent a jolting ache throughout his body, his well-fucked ass, his bruised and cut limbs. He couldn't outrun a tortoise at this rate, but maybe he wouldn't need to. He was nothing, he was just a sex toy, an object. Whoever this man was—Stark's enemy, Stark's executioner—surely he wouldn't be bothered to chase after Steve.
As he got up, and drained the last of his drink, Steve made one last desperate plea, with a voice that was already failing. "Please, let me out, and I'll do whatever you want. I won't fight you, ever again. Fuck me, whip me, whatever you want, please, I'll do it willingly, just get me out of here."
"Yes," Steve said tightly. "I love this."
If so, he would have expected Stark to gleefully explain from the ceiling what lesson this was designed to teach, but nothing came. Shattered, broken, for a moment Steve just laid the wrecked shell of his body back down on the mattress, prepared to docilely just waited for his torment to continue.
A larger one to go. He didn't waste time lying in a heap of cramped muscles, pins and needles. The first thing he did was reach around and pull the plug out. It took a couple tries to dig his fingers in under the horrible thing, still stick with some futuristic space lube that stayed impossibly slippery even now.
"I must warn you," came Jarvis's voice from the ceiling, when Steve tore off the shower curtain, and wrapped it around his fist, so he could try to smash the window open with it. Did that guy never sleep? "This is unlikely to be successful, and Master Stark will be very displeased."
Someone else.
How long had Stark been planning this?
The next time he woke, there was a wooden box waiting for him, carved with the same "Property of..." tag that Steve bore on his skin. He lifted the lid with some trepidation, to find an array of familiar-looking toys, neatly numbered from 1-10, and sized accordingly. They were arranged on soft felt, each nestled into an indent formed exactly to its shape. There was a even a bottle of lube tucked thoughtfully into the corner.
"There's a good boy," said Nat, stroking his bulging cheek again. The fabric of his blindfold was wet with tears. "I knew you could do it."
This was it, Steve thought, whimpering around the intrusion. Fingers reached into his mouth, stroking down the length of his tongue just because they could, just because Steve couldn't close his mouth against them.
Steve jerked back to awareness, and immediately regretted it.
His ass had eagerly sucked the toy inwards, and seemed reluctant to give it up. It took a steady pull on Stark's part, a burning, friction-laden drag, before it was released with an obscene pop. There came the clatter of something dropped on a tray, and then another squelch of that damned bottle. Steve imagined that Stark was lubing up the next one, a size up, and snarled, "Don't you dare put that thing in me!" Or tried to. No one heard it but the gag, and soon enough, his next torment was making its way in.
Too soon, Stark touched the thing inside of him, making him jerk and grunt. It was pulled out slightly, and then sank back in. Out and then in again, changing angles with each stroke, until abruptly it brushed something inside him that made him jump within the limits of his bonds.
His hands weren't even bound behind him, but resting at his stomach. Not attached to any furniture. No one watching him.
He took another step closer, so that he could take Steve's his chin in icy cold hands, and tilt his face up. "You promised me. If I got you out of there, you'd do anything for me, anything at all. Don't you remember?"
Immediately he was plunged right back into the ocean depths, into the freezing senseless dark, and as he began to struggle and thrash, the water resisted movement, resisted even the possibility of movement, he might as well have been buried in
In response, the hand only squeezed harder.
"Have I told you recently, Nat?" said Clint, between thrusts.
Somehow, Steve made it into the hallway, the torturous thing wagging inside him with each step. His thighs were quivering from the effort, and he was nearly sure he'd explode if he made one more movement.
Either he'd forgotten the impossible size of the first one, or this one was much, much larger. He was sobbing into the gag now, his shoulders aching from how desperately he was trying to get free, to get just one arm loose so he could defend himself. The bonds didn't allow him to move so much as an inch.
“Enough!” Howard slammed his hand down, making a loud noise and startling them all into a nervous silence. This was already much further than Maria used dared to push Howard.
Steve entered and gave Tony an approving pat on the shoulder. He walked towards the back of the jet and sat down, strapping in. Sam sat across from him, next to Clint, and he handed the archer some cash.
At the bottom of the pad there was a line for his signature. As the guy in charge (supposedly, he hadn’t actually gotten a say in anything so far) it was his job to sign off and submit the final decisions. Before he could second guess himself he dragged Steve’s name to the top of the list, signed it and hit submit. Screw them for trying to hide things from him. They wanted to play games with him? Well Tony was the motherfucking Game Master. He’d show them games.
Steve didn’t respond. Tony forged on anyway.
Tony landed with a clank and walked them in. The staff ushered them in and Tony laid Steve down on a gurney. A nurse approached with a hose and turned on the water, staying down his legs to try to wash away some of the mess. Steve jerked away. PAIN COLD WET he was flying and then he was going dowN DOwn dOWn cold WET-
“Fifteen grand in three weeks? Not without selling cows, and without them we’d be right back in debt. Are you sure it’s not enough?” he asked desperately. The banker pretended to look contrite but Steve could practically smell the waves of predatory satisfaction rolling off the man.
Tony opened his eyes and looked over to where the Captain was shifting and muttering uncomfortably in his sleep. Tony got up and rewet the rag to cool his fever, feeling his forehead. He was burning up, and seemed to be doing much worse. He replaced the cloth and put a hand on the Captain's shoulder to still him before he ripped his stitches. His eyes blinked open blearily, and they lived around the room before focusing on Tony. He rasped something out and choked on the dryness in his throat. Tony carefully helped him up so that he was leaning against the wall, and poured him a cup of water. The Captain’s hand was too weak to grip so Tony helped him drink until he turned his head away.
“Looks like two pills.”
There was an enormous cheer and Tony stepped out from the wings of the stage, waving to the crowd.
“Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.” Tony snarled, and stomped out of the room with a angry huff. There were a few seconds of awkward silence.
Steve stared at him. “You can just….make a patent? In like three weeks? And sell it for thousands of dollars?” He squinted at him doubtfully.
They all stepped out of the quinjet into a sea of black wings and feathers.
Tony blinked up at him. “Yeah?”
“Do you like Carol? Or what about the wizard guy? Stephan?” Steve suggested.
Tony left the room and came back with their tiny pair of scissors from the first aid kit, along with tweezers. He kneeled down again and carefully cut and removed the thread in a few of the smaller cuts. Steve winced as he did it, but once it was done he felt much better. He had let his skin fully heal over stitches once, and after spending a half hour in the bathtub trying to cut little pieces of string out of his thigh he swore to never let it happen again. Tony wiped all the tools down and rewrapped Steve’s chest, his hands shaking slightly. When he was done, Steve put his shirt back on and grabbed Tony’s wrist.
He arrived at Steve’s place at 3, and waved to Clint before trotting up the stairs. Steve was standing in the hallway, arguing with the delivery man who was trying to drop off the fridge.
Steve laughed again and gave him a peck on the cheek as he went to the pantry himself to get the box. “This is why I love you, so funny.”
On the broadcasts they always made it look like a careless tribute had lost control of their campfire, whenever flames started to spread. Little did viewers at home know that military grade weapons had started the blaze. Apparently there was more to being Game Master than making sure no one got out of the arena. Now that Hammer was in charge, he wanted to give the people back home a show to remember, and that meant fire and excitement.
“Well Captain, I guess we've found what Kane meant by a complete set. A missing piece of the Crown Jewels, held by a collector in America of all places!” He shook his head in disbelief and turned back towards Raymond. “Please expect a call from the Queen in the next week.”
He tossed the remote on the table and frowned at Steve. "Could you scootch over?"
“Clint, what did he do?”
He closed his eyes, and thought of the last time he plowed his way into the ground, in his very first suit, then again in the second, and the fifth, and had it really been that many times? He should give up and install a parachute at this point, except right now it was a little too late, the ground was approaching fast and it wasn’t going to wait for him to go back to his lab and tinker. Tony braced himself; this was going to hurt.
“Part of the history of my family too. Here is a check I received from Mr. Stane, written out to me. It should cover the full accounts on both the house and truck.”
“You’re lucky you did. I don’t want to think what would Stane would have done to you if you didn’t.”
“Thanks for talking with me, I think I get it now. I won’t try to interfere with anything between you and the new guy. Goodnight, Tony.”
“Whatever I did-”
“The big ones need to stay in, at least until tomorrow. Some of the stitches for the smaller cuts might be alright to take out, if they’re really itching.”
The man tilted his head towards the staircase at the end of the hall. “Steve is the last apartment on the left side of the third floor.”
Tony made a face of disgust. They were
He should have taken a picture of the food before they ate it all, it had been an impressive spread. Still, the occasion of enjoying such ambrosia needed to be recorded and he hadn’t posted anything yet today. He scooted around the table to be on the same side as Steve and took a picture of them in front of all the empty plates, Tony grinning wide and Steve slightly more hesitant beside him.
Tony kissed him and Steve pulled him closer.
“Well,” he started. “You know what this means.”
It’d been a while since his playboy days and sometimes he missed the flirting. He liked this Brian guy, he was fun.
“Oh, what a shame, straight into the catcher’s mitt.”
Steve stood up, and brushed off his pants with a sigh as Tony jumped around with glee.
The other tribute dragged him up again, and before Tony coughed up all the water he was gasping out his acceptance. The other boy let him go and Tony crawled away, coughing and hacking.
“You don’t understand, I have done terrible things, I have hurt others-”
“I volunteer! Take me instead of Bucky!” he shouted, his breath wheezing.
I'm getting my wisdom teeth out today, weather and snow permitting. Wish me luck.
“So what's wrong with me? Why’s Bucky so much better?” He complained, crossing his arms on the table and resting his head on top. She shrugged and took a sip of her beer. It took her two tries to get it back on the coaster.
Well, worse case scenario, he had thirty five other cows to introduce him to.
He hadn’t realized how long he had been staring until a stylist offered him a hand to lead him on stage. They were all treating him like a wounded animal, speaking soft and low, every moment telegraphed to avoid startling him.
He followed the scent of the badger, smelling as it waddled along, as it had a standoff with a snake, as it continued on down into its den. Disappointing, but to be expected. Clint and Jan bounded up, and quickly assessed the situation. Clint nosed at the entrance of the den with a whine, and started digging between tree roots. Tony caught up last, and eased to a stop beside him, panting loudly. Not too bad, Steve thought to himself. It was unlikely that Tony had ever run this far this fast before as a human, certainly never as a wolf, so he didn’t judge. He would be fun whipping him into shape, starting tonight. He gave his side a gentle nip, and took off, running between the trees then turning to see if he was going to play along. Instead Tony collapsed to the ground, sticking his legs in the air, metaphorically telling him that he was down for the count. And that wouldn’t do at all. He ran back and gave him another playful nip, dodging his paw as he swiped at him. He danced back and forth around him until the brown wolf suddenly rolled to his feet and got a mouthful of white fur. Then Tony was the one darting off, weaving between the trees like his life depended on it. Steve let out a happy howl and the chase was on. He let Tony get ahead, not wanting to use his knowledge of the woods and superior stamina to end the game too quickly. But after a few minutes when he still hadn’t caught up, he became confused and put on the speed. He broke into a clearing and stopped. No Tony. He put his nose to the ground and retraced his steps. He caught the scent of cinnamon and metal and followed it as it made a sharp turn, then ended. He looked up, confused. He tried again and it still ended in the same spot. He let out a worried howl.
Tony pet his head. “It’s like touching a fancy rug! Oh my god!”
Stane reared back in shock, and continued his trajectory until he toppled over backwards, hitting the ground and lying there, still, as a pool of blood started to form around his head.
Home, huh? It was nice to see he wasn’t the only one to see it that way. He shrugged the best he could with the bandages holding his chest immobile.
Tony ran his hand down Steve’s back and Steve grabbed his hand and stopped him before he got below the ribs. “But Thor is hurt so we can’t. We have to go back.”
“It’s his royal highness, now. As you may have noticed, there’s been some changes.”
“You should smell Clint’s room. What else?”
The people around him let out drunken cheers. The introduction was always broadcasted live at eight, and it was barely two now, so Tony had no clue why he had to be there so early.
“This place is a fucking dump.” Said Tony, snapping his gum. Too bad keeping it safe seemed to include marrying possibly the worst wolf in the entire world. Certainly the most annoying. And obnoxious. And rude. And foul mouthed, and probably lazy, and most certainly spoiled, with that amount of suitcases. What the hell had he gotten himself into?
“I have never heard of a twice bound dragon.”
Tony lead the cart to the long shack where all of the miners slept. He looped and arm around the man’s shoulders and dragged him inside, laying him down on the bed next to Tony’s. He pulled his boots off, and laid the blanket over him. It would be best if Tony was here when he awoke, to offer him water and check how he was feeling, but the overseer watched from the doorway and Tony knew he would be expected to return to the mine. He dragged it out as long as he could, checking the Captain over for any other injuries, and using his rag to wipe off his hands and face. Others had survived worse, and as long as infection didn’t set in the Captain should make a full recovery. Under the grime he was a handsome man, with light hair and a strong jaw. Tony brushed a hand down his face, idly wondering what color his eyes might be. It felt odd to meet a legend up close, to see small bruises ruining the image of the untouchable victor. Tony wondered if he would live up to his reputation. It was a lot to live up to, between being the first to tame a wild dragon, to leading the charge in the battle of the keep, and commanding the troops to victory in the great war. Not to mention his years of loyal service in times of peace.
“Near the edge of the arena, on the west side. We were on the east side when were separated, and I’d like to see if anyone is still hanging around the tree leading to the tunnel. That’s where we agreed to meet if we were separated and all of the others are still alive so they might be there too.”
“Take this road until you get to Apollo street, then make a left. There’s a sign with a dog out front.”
He ate it methodically as Jan and Clint wandered downstairs. He went outside and the frost from the grass collected on his boots. He opened the doors to the barn and the cows ambled outside as the sun peeked up from behind the mountains. The barn door was warping as the waterproof paint peeled off. He would need to fix this too. He added it to his already overflowing mental checklist, and went back inside. Clint and Jan were more awake now, having a quiet conversation between themselves. Tony was no where to be seen, probably still sleeping. Steve left the kitchen to go wake him up, and realized that he didn't actually know which room he had picked.
“You have done well. You are a legend in these lands, and even now we trust you to lead us to the rebellion, then all of Thor’s loyal men to victory over Loki.”
Steve frowned. He didn’t see it either. He scanned the rows again. Silver, silver, silver, there was gold one, too old to be Tony's, silver, silver, a thin gold band, one with a ruby, one with a blue gem, what were those called? Sapphires? Then that was it, the next row was earnings. It wasn’t there.
Then Tony was scooping him up and the world seemed to blur into one big streak. He tapped on Tony’s golden mask.
Absolutely nothing was going on, and somehow it was all too much. Around noon, there was a gentle knock at the door. Steve didn’t respond, and after a moment Jan let herself in. She took a breath. “Look, I’m still mad at you for yelling at Clint and trying to go after him. But I think it’s important that everybody gets along, so maybe you want to come get some lunch, and we could talk it out?”
He leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. “I don’t know. He was crazy. He called me a monster! All I was doing was sitting there, what’s so monstrous about that?”
“Does that mean that the two of us have permission to stop him?” Jan asked, already ready with her precious loopholes.
“C’mon, break it up you two. What’s wrong?” Almost a year of this, and it still felt weird to Steve that it was now his job to play peacemaker rather than picking a side and joining in.
“Maybe,” Steve agreed, and shut the oven door. Tony put another ten minutes on the timer and they sat at the counter.
He shook his head. “Sorry Sir, a lot of people come through my store in a given day, I can’t remember them all. I don’t keep records, when so many of my customers pay cash. That’s the risk of using a place like this instead of getting a loan.”
“Excellent, excellent! Please turn your attention to the Coliseum doors!”
“Tony stays.”
Steve was doing push ups in the training simulator. The mechanical claws hanging from the ceiling were supposed to represent Chitauri soldiers, and they jerked around the room unpredictably. One came towards him and he vaulted gracefully over top before returning to his push ups. There was commotion in the hallway and a tall man with black hair and a goatee charged into the training room. He ducked under a claw and walked confidently forward as a second claw passed inches from his face. The man came to a stop in front of Steve and put his hands on his hips. “My name is Tony Stark, I got the Chitauri leviathan blood on me in the attack on the German front tomorrow. I’m stuck in a time loop like you were in in New York.” He rushed out.
Steve tried to unwrap the bandage and Tony screamed. Tony covered his mouth and Steve put his hand over top a second later. Tony felt tears build in the corners of his eyes.
The banker put a hand on his shoulder. “Now Mr. Rogers…”
“No, you were right, it was inconvenient, and I probably should have asked or at least mentioned it to you guys. I tend to get really excited about a project, and I sort of forget everything else. And I didn’t need to have a party anymore, since we celebrated.”
“Never.”
There was a banging from the kitchen and Tony looked over the back of the couch.
“I thought Hammer might be a likely name for a smith. Because they use hammers?”
Then Clint burst into Steve’s room with a shout, interrupting his train of thought. “Steve! You’re getting married!”
“-a puppy with delusions of grandeur.” Steve finished. “He grew up rich in the city, he’s not gonna want any dumb flowers. And he doesn’t like me like that.” he tried to explain a little desperately.
The peacekeeper spun his heel and ran out of the room. Tony looked around to make sure no one was paying attention to him, then pushed Steve into a small storage room.
Tony laughed at that, rough and hearty and honest. Steve really wished he wouldn’t do that. It made him look sweet. It made him feel bad about freaking out about signing his future away and dumping all that rage on him, when he got screwed out of just as much.
The problems started, like many of the Avenger’s problems, with an innocent suggestion.
And something about the look in his eyes and the whole messed up situation made Tony break down and laugh. He laughed and laughed and Steve pulled him against him and he was laughing too. He had felt everything under the sun for Tony, from hatred, to confusion, to something that he was honest enough to admit was probably lust, then frustration and hope and a hundred, no a thousand other things.
Tony had the arc reactor back.
"Watch out, Steve’s in a mood.” Tony said sourly.
The icing on the cake was Steve encouraging his tinkering. Even Pepper got mad at him for that.
Tony obediently stood in front of the green sheet and repeated the lines from the teleprompter word for word. When he was done Obie sent him home with a slice of cake and a pat on the back.
Tony came back out of the kitchen. “You guys ready to eat?”
There's nothing in it for us, and as alpha, it's my job to do what's best for my pack.” He leaned back in his chair, looking smug. He took another puff of his cigar.
“I’ll have more of this one then,” Tony said, already dumping more of the haberno sauce straight into his mouth. “It burns so delicious,” he said, tearing up. “It’s worth it.”
Not-Cap laughed. “Are you alright? I'm guessing falling out of the sky like that isn't an everyday occurrence?”
“There you go. So as I was saying, kids these days are too much for me. I feel like you. I can never make fun of your old man ways again.”
Thor leaned forward, earnestly saying, “My shield brothers and I would be honored to join you on your noble quest to save your kingdom.”
Scenario five. Before he gets to the meeting room, he gets a call on the burner phone. Tony tells him not to come at all. The deal has been called off, they’re stuck in Wakanda forever. He would have had to fight to get the Government to hear them out. He wouldn’t have to sabotage anything to get the decision reversed, just not fight as hard as he could have, and the whole thing might end before it starts. Steve never sees him again, things never get resolved.
Steve seemed willing to humor him with a subject change. “That’d be pretty swell Tony, but how would you power them?”
“You need to step back. It isn’t any of your business what goes on in my pack.” Steve snarled, taking out his rage on whoever was nearest. So, Tony. But since it was Tony, he wasn’t taking it lying down.
As the team steps in and S.H.I.E.L.D agents slap handcuffs around his wrists, Steve doesn't resist at all- only watches Tony silently as he's led out. Almost expectantly, he feels a hot agony burrowing into two specific spots on his body, and feels the marks fade away.
"I know it is."
I shouldn’t have just laid out all of my feelings like that. It’s a burden. I’ve thought about it, and I don’t think I should keep leaving messages.
"I'm not resigning, Tony. I'm just... I'm trying to break up with you, can't you-"
None of them say what they really think. That maybe no one there is left. That everyone has left. God, but Steve hopes Tony is still there.
Tony Stark's inner wrist is imprinted with six sections of black, simplistic numbers, divided by colons. He likes numbers because they're logical and solvable. They're inevitable, right or wrong, not varying shades of gray like his morals or the people of this world. But when he meets Pepper for the first time and the timer is far from fading, it feels like somewhere out there, the universe is laughing at him.
"Enough of this sentimental crap," Tony stands. "We're superheroes. Act like it."
Immediately, he responds. They're already entwining together onto a quality Stark chair, lips trapped in something sweet and beautiful, Steve's thoughts going fuzzy with the taste and feel of Tony
He is nothing but blood and bones, remnants of alcohol pulsing through his veins and shards of shrapnel struggling to pierce his pumping heart whole. He wants the world to see he's human, but the red and gold paint an indestructible exterior. Tony can't even look directly into the azure of Steve's eyes (a color he usually doesn't mind) without a spark of anger stirring within him.
"No! No, nothing like that," comes the flustered reply, and a faint splash of pink tinges the strip of skin below Steve's eyes, across his nose. "I just... sorry, I know this is personal, but... do you have a soulmate?"
"That is why you will go home, and figure it out." She doesn't move, doesn't speak, until he slowly stands up and the two begin walking through this desert.
either one or two chapters left guaranteed.
I think I would always just split myself open for you, Tony. You already know my heart.
When at last the battle spirit is dissipating and Bucky begins to stir, Steve kneels over Tony's body.
"Tony," says a familiar voice, "You were having a nightmare."
Which I think is the same thing as missing them.
"He's already gotten to me," breathes Tony, and he swings his legs out of the bed and feels cold shock run through them at the splat of hard ground. Pain slices through his midsection and there's nothing to show for it except a slight grimace on his face-
"Yeah," he nods, turning a corner. It's a good thing he doesn't get lost much in the building anymore.
When Steve Rogers turns 18 and enlists himself into the military, he wakes up one night in a cold sweat. The cot is hard and his stuffy tent reeks of sweaty men, but he still shudders as agony
"No-"
Steve stiffens up for a second and then is kissing him back just as fiercely. Then Steve pulls back. "I almost... I killed you, last time. You killed me. Don't you remember?"
But he looks around at all of his wealth, power, luxury, and concludes that he's got everything he needs besides love. And Tony decides he'll wait for that; he'll wait for love, he'll wait for the row of zeroes on his left arm.
“They kept talking about, you know, conquering the Universe, and their master, Thanos. Trust me, it was clear. Anyway- Tony and the kid- Peter- snuck onto the spaceship! The donut looking ship! And it blasted off into space. But he dropped this phone on the road and the only number on it is yours. So I had to call.”
Steve enters, clears his throat, opens his mouth to say something, and closes it again.
She frowns, and he wants to smooth the crease between her eyes. "Tony, you cannot get angry at me. I'm sorry, alright? But you knew this was going to end sooner or later, Tony, you knew. We both did. You know it."
Steve never had a timer before the ice. Neither did Peggy, though, and that was even enough for the both of them to believe they were already soulmates- just not marked by clocks. "We never needed those," Peggy tells him right before he boards the fatal plane.
I-I have to go. Sorry.
"What?" says Tony, and he starts to scream as Steve's face distorts and warps into nothing, into bones, into blood, and the man folds in on himself in a grotesque origami sculpture of flesh. He looks like Peter, and his eyes melt away until there's nothing left in the sockets, and worms crawl through his skin and outwards...
And there's no victory, and there are countless losses, and it seems punishment just to live and breathe everyday when their souls have been roped into somewhere unreachable. Or maybe their souls have been pulverized. Either way, they're gone.
Steve looks heartbroken and humiliated at the same time.
Steve glances down and tries his best not to break down in the middle of a conference.
"There's too many of them," and then there are nukes heading towards the city. Tony looks up at the rippling portal of deep outer space split open in the sky, and he gets an idea. He looks up at the frightening wormhole, bleeding and spilling toxins (just like he is), and he gets an idea.
During his first stay in the Stark tower, he nearly jumps after seeing the familiar letters carved into the billionaire's golden cufflinks, and then stares.
How did they get here?
Steve lays awake in his for a long time, thinking.
“Good to hear you too, Steve. But- oh right, right, sorry, there’s a pressing issue at hand. THANOS is HERE.”
Do you remember when we were fighting again, about Ultron, and you said we weren’t going to be prepared? That Thanos had been in your head all this time?
Always, in the nightmares, there's his corpse rotting on the ground, bones tearing through blackened skin and lips purple. Eye sockets emptied and overflowing with maggots, flesh half-decayed and furling with fungus. The body doesn't disintegrate. The body shows no mercy. It only stares up at him, helpless and gone, and behind it is Peter asking,
Upon arrival to Earth, Tony stumbles out into bright sunlight. He only sees muddled visions of people and nothing clear, nothing tangible from ghosts or friends. That might be Natasha, with silver hair, or Rhodey in the War Machine suit. It might be Bruce stepping nearer and Thor greeting him enthusiastically, golden locks gone. Two Wakandans... a raccoon?
Tony raises an eyebrow.
He kisses him.
And then Tony starts laughing. Something borderline hysteric but just in the edge of panic, he laughs and clutches his stomach even though the stab wound is really doing a number on him. "What are the odds? That out of everyone that blew away... we're still standing? The two of us?"
And the clock is so close, but an angry Norse god is endangering the city downtown. Tony's a big boy, so he pushes his dread down and flies swiftly to the square, only to be met with something tall and painted patriotic colors. It's dark outside and Loki surrenders, armor dissolving in flashes of golden light, as Tony's armory of weapons, all assembled and aiming at the villain, are folded away. "Mr. Stark," acknowledges the hero beside him.
He looks, blearily, and Steve is really there. Halfway out of a chair, clearly about to come rouse Tony, face confused and concerned and maybe a little...
"I guess I just wasn't prepared," he grits out. He's being so irrational, but he can't stop. "I'll just wallow in self-pity after you leave to go fuck someone else, but I understand. Everyone leaves."
"We were star-crossed lovers, Steve," he laughs painfully. "Literally."
, Steve slides his arms around Tony and lifts the upper half of his body up towards him, teardrops falling freely down each cheek. He cradles the man he loved-
"You are faltering because of a stab wound. Earthlings are unimaginably weak. When Thanos tore me apart limb by limb and ripped my eye out, my brain out, I still stood and fought. I never stopped fighting. But you..." The disgust on her face is evident. "You have been stabbed, once, and you cannot even walk."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I-No," Steve replies slowly, lowering his eyes, "I don't think so."
As they bicker and exchange arguments, Steve's scars (he doesn't know what else to call them) seem to burn under his shirt, demanding attention and remembrance. Tony feels it, too, and their eyes meet across the room as everyone else's voices seem to fade away around them, and all that exists in the world is each other.
“We can… wow… we can discuss that later. But yeah... the Avengers did break up. There was a fight and... everything. But it’s good to hear your voice, Bruce.”
"I'll stay here," Steve says determinedly.
“Funny story, actually. So on this bright day a giant spaceship came down to Earth and Thanos’ minions jumped out and began fighting with us. Dr. Strange came and he and Tony were fighting the evil guys.”
He tears the helmet off with a ferocity that surprises himself, and sobs as Tony's face comes into view, eyes closed, lips parted, and a thin trickle of blood traveling down the right side of his head. His cheeks are already paling, and it hasn't even been five minutes. Even as he hears the officers and heroes arriving outside the wreckage and Black Panther silenty padding closer to the scene inside, movement is not something that comes to mind.
So Steve remains optimistic, because he loves his friends, he loves taking down villains, and he loves being celebrated by America. His life is good, and it'll just be even better with someone to be in love with.
JARVIS slides it open to reveal Steve, just as Pepper shouts, "I'm not even your goddamn soulmate!"
It's mere days before the Battle of New York, the one that will change his life forever, although Tony has no idea. But he's a genius. He can predict whether the end of the world is near, and it's difficult to predict whether a super soldier out of time, a Norse god, an intimidating redhead, and a snarky archer can stop it.
And someone running to him. Someone with a new beard and chocolate hair but with the same glinting eyes, who shouts, "Tony!" just as Tony begins to fall. His side hurts. And he's caught by strong arms, a face that presses his leaving wet stains, and then nothing but darkness.
“I explained it, Steve. She’s my wife, let me worry about her, okay?” He grit out beneath grinding teeth.
“And, God, when everything went down with Bucky. When my reactor got destroyed, it felt like my heart did too. But, I pieced what I had left back together, with Pepper.”
“Are you going to say something, Steve? Or at least shield your eyes in disgust so I can gauge your reaction?” Tony asked, sounding a little anxious/aggravated at the silence.
Tony felt his heart clench.
Tony was faring no better as Steve's dick kept pushing against his sensitive spot, the deep slide knocking the air out of his lungs.
He hated it. Hated everything about the stones, and what they resembled, and how they had singlehandedly destroyed everything Steve ever believed in.
The blonde pulled away, fumbling for the oil on the bed again, watching as Tony’s entrance clenched and unclenched.
His eyes were closed though, and they would never open again.
Tugging at his hair, he felt the room start to tilt around him, making his vision hazy and the air thicker, cutting off his breathing.
Tony looked at him like he was stupid, folding his arms and sitting back.
“Get off you prick!” Tony howled, trying to flip him off.
What the hell was he going to do about this?
Tony almost came when he heard the Brooklyn slip through Steve’s voice.
He was rambling, and that was always a sign that there was something crashing around in his mind.
Silence, but Steve was too fired up now to stop.
"F-fuck you." Tony managed to hiss, his hands falling on Steve's ass to clench the pale flesh, smacking both globes loudly.
Steve gasped, turning his head to look at the other man in confusion.
Tony was pouring the water into the pot when she said that, the words making him splash a little bit of the liquid over the sides.
Natasha would have already told him to suck it up.
Tony growled, throwing himself back into Steve’s hits.
Putting his head in his hands, he squeezed his eyes shut, trying to block out the image of Tony’s half burnt face.
"I think it would be wise if we told Morgan a little bit further down the road. When we have everything figured out." Pepper muttered.
Stephen sighed then, running his fingers through his goatee.
“W-Woah there buddy, not as limber as I used to be. What are you doing?”
“No. It’s not that. St-.”
The blonde had been right, of course.
“Sleep? There is no sleeping for me right now. Not after…” Closing his eyes, he willed back his tears again.
“This might hurt, Tony.”
“S-Steve.”
Natasha nodded, cupping his cheek tenderly.
Out of the corner of his eye, he watched Pepper stand as tall as she could, pushing her hair back.
“Move on me, Tony. Take me deeper. Yeah, there you go. Fuck.” Steve gasped, watching as the other male fucked himself on his dick. Throwing his head back, Steve pulled against Tony’s thighs, drawing the man closer, moaning loudly at the warmth that kept enveloping his cock.
Steve was drowning.
Tony just stared at her, feel nausea roll through him.
Steve loved him?
The blonde turned toward him again.
“Just a little…paranoid? I guess you could say.” Tony answered, steeling his nerves, Pepper could see right through him most times. He really hoped this was not one of those times.
Steve snarled.
“Well, in this timeline, we know what happens when Tony sacrifices his life. It’s my turn.”
It wasn’t what he said that would wound her, it was his expression when he said it.
And ached for what he didn’t know he possessed.
Then stepped through.
The brunette shook his head, looking down at the other man between his legs.
"I-I'll admit it, if you,
She wasn’t that person, but her and Tony had built a life together, with their daughter, with that stupid Alpaca in the back yard.
"I was angry. I‌ don't know why I did that."‌ He finished, lamely.
“Fuck!” Tony yelled, his fingers digging into Steve’s shoulders, hips bucking helplessly as another, intense orgasm washed through him, steeling all his sense with it.
Steve didn’t say anything, just continued to stare at Tony.
Silence.
She just shrugged, not knowing what to tell him, not knowing what to tell
Steve blanched, sighing.
And the thought, when it hit Tony, scared the ever-living fuck out of him. Because, he had never felt that way towards anybody before. And from then on, it grew and grew until Steve was always on the forefront of his mind.
“Fuck yeah, Steve.” The brunette gasped, locking his legs around the mans waist.
Pepper didn’t deserve anything remotely close to that.
“We should move this inside.” He muttered against Steve’s lips, flicking his tongue out to run across the seam of his mouth.
There was so much pain.
Reaching up, he grabbed a hold of Steve’s shirt and threw him away from his person, watching as the blonde fell over the fallen equipment.
Tony really was a beautiful man, even when he had gotten back from space.
Iron Man, no matter what suit he adorned.
Steve just stared at him, his chest rising and falling with his pants.
The brunette growled, twisting the fabric of the suit between his fingers, tugging at the blonde, snarling in his face, watching as the blue eyes widened, defeat nestled in the depths of them.
"Tony, I'll never be sorry for the life we built together. We built a
They both pulled away for a second, looking into each others faces.
“Jesus.” Tony muttered, sucking in a breath, roaming his hands over the perfect abs that were displayed in front of him.
“Tony. Listen to me. And this might frighten you.”
Nope.
God, it made Steve respect Tony’s resourcefulness, and damn stubbornness even more. That man had refused to die out there.
He wanted to tell her that there was no
Keeping his back to the man, he heard Tony move across the floor, planting himself in front of the blonde male.
The brunette just stared at him, gasping a little bit when he felt the tip of the mans cock push against his opening. He tried not to grit his teeth together when Steve pushed forward, but it was a liiiitle difficult.
The blonde turned to him, eyes devoid of that spark Tony always longed to see.
Looking down, he observed Tony’s cock, straining against his belly, leaving small beads of precome behind on his skin.
“You don’t know what you want, Tony.”
Steve growled, “All on me, huh? All on me! And you’re the victim? You’re not a victim here, Tony!”
And he didn’t want it to stop now either.
What was that about today? Tony seemed really angry that
Tony sat down with her, both on opposite ends of the couch.
“Till the end of the line, Stevie.”
“Where are the coffee beans in this place?” Tony snapped, trying to remember where they used to be located.
The thought alone made Tony grit his teeth, forcing his eyes out the window, trying to find his happy place.
Stephen only stared at him.
“And my mother, you think she deserved that, Steve? What if it had been your mother?!”
They were working on Steve’s suit, orchestrating a safer, and more diligent management of the shield, and getting it in Steve’s hand faster.
She knew exactly what happened.
Steve’s eyes were glazed, chest still rising and falling.
“I’m glad she could make you happy.” Steve murmured, watching as the brunette adorned his glasses and waved the waitress over.
“I’m so sorry, um, I can help clean it up if you’d like?”
He was more, so much more.
Clearing her throat, she watched as her husband sighed and sat in one of the porch chairs, looking out towards the lake.
“I know you told me to shut up here, but if you don’t stop teasing me, this is going to be over way before I want it to be.”
“I’m sorry, Pepper.”
Dread.
…can’t, get too close. If that makes any sense.”
Dogging it, he bent low and tackled Steve to the ground, rolling with him, until he had him pinned down.
She wanted to weep, because she knew if Tony knew that Steve felt the same way for him as he did for that man, he would have a hard time carrying on with their marriage.
“I heard you were rude to
“Steve? I know you’re hurting. But, Natasha, she did what she had to do, to get that stone. You know that.”
That was his in!
His hands…they were firmly planted on her hips, her breasts all but grinding into his chest.
Tony smirked, God, couldn’t he handle this maturely? Apologize for being rude to the woman he didn’t know, and just move on with his day?
you did that, really Tony?" She asked, feigning disbelief.
He stopped, flaring his nostrils.
Before he slipped by Steve though, the blonde shot out his hand and gripped the shorter males bicep.
Strange’s eyebrow merely raised,
Suddenly, the lights were turning down and Steve was shoving his hand in his stretch pants, grasping his cock.
“Steve?”
Pushing Steve to the side, Tony sat up, putting his head in his hands, taking a deep breath.
This revelation brought his face up, watching as Pepper rolled her eyes at herself, sniffling.
Steve rolled his hips, humping against Tony’s thigh.
Tony glared.
On the wall in front of him was Tony. Just pictures of random events, his Iron Man suit, galas, conventions.
Tony.
“You’re sorry! You’re sorry, huh?!” Tony yelled, grabbing his shirt off the floor.
“Of course, I got a little irritated, because I knew, just by hearing him say your name, that there was no way he was involving you with this issue, there was no way he was calling you to involve you in the chaos that was about to ensue.”
Steve turned his head towards Tony, arms crossed in full
Tony’s eyes widened.
Steve just watched him go, a little confused, and unsettled with how quickly he had shut him out.
Shaking his head again, he cleared those thoughts, wanting to find sleep sometime tonight, and with that mindset going, he’d be invaded by nightmares of expansive space, and Tony screaming at him, asking why he betrayed him, and left him in a bunker to get home all alone.
“So…I haven’t seen
“Well. Tell me if it’s any good. Invite the moochers, they’ll love it.”
Steve lay beside Tony, after cleaning them both up, his hand trailing along the brunettes skin lazily.
Tony landed again, reaching out and grabbing the front of Steve’s uniform, throwing him across the track.
He couldn’t speak, the words were clogging his throat, along with his breathing.
Tony made his way over to the super soldier, bending in front of him.
Smiling, Steve jammed his hand inside the gauntlet, feeling fire and electricity race themselves through his limbs, chest and mind.
Steve moved back, letting Tony's legs slip free and his thighs wound around his hips, the same finger slipping deep, now accompanied by a second.
"Put my fucking legs down." He grit out, the fingering becoming more and more difficult.
“N-Not that there’s anything wrong with t-.”
The super soldier nodded his head.
Silence.
, and especially a horrible friend.
"I‌ remember the aftermath following the fallout between the both of you. It was like watching a car wreck." She said, trying not to unleash the full extent of her resentment towards him and his feelings.
Silence.
“Woah, hold up there, Cap. Unlike you, you know human perfection, I’m a mere mortal, and I don’t look as good as you with said shirt off my body. So, could I leave it on perhaps?”
Oh, Jeez.
It wouldn’t have bothered Steve if he had, knowing that hair was natural.
“It makes a lot of sense, Tony.”
Growling audibly, he turned and made to snap at the jackass who took away his reading material.
“Excuse me?” Steve stuttered out.
He looked…
And alive.
Steve didn’t budge as Tony struggled in his grip.
“I uh, I’m Cortney. Steve’s friend from our group. I hope you guys don’t mind that I spent the night last night. Steve and I were up late trying to put together this party for the people who attend.”
Tony gasped, his legs trembling.
“As you know, Tony didn’t even make that call. Bruce Banner did.”
“What did you say?” Steve asked him, voice low, but lethal.
Steve narrowed his eyes, nostrils flaring at Tony’s sarcasm.
Steve pushed forward then, melding their lips back together, his fingers running over the smooth skin over Tony’s stomach, backing the shorter man up into the bed.
Steve continued, his tongue gliding down the firm muscles and quivering stomach, stopping at the seam of Tony’s pants.
What was there to say?
Tony felt his heart thundering against his ribcage, picturing Pepper and his daughter at their lake house. Clenching his eyes shut, he tried to pull himself away from Steve, telling himself that this was wrong, wanting this man was wrong, loving him when he was married to a wonderful woman, was fucked up.
"I‌ have watched you...
“Tony!” He screamed, running up a rock and jumping…
Silence.
“I’m really sorry.” He whispered, his face turning blood red.
If he even wanted it to stop.
Silence.
He had been decked in all black, from his shirt, all the way down to his shoes.
“Nothing! Absolutely nothing, we were just going outside.” Steve stammered out.
“You’re a puzzle, a contradiction. The first time I met you, you were just another uncaring bastard happy to send me off to my death. I didn’t expect to see you again after the interviews, let alone for you to end up in here with me. Then when we got separated at the cornucopia I thought that that was it again… what chance did a pampered Capital boy have of surviving alone in the woods?”
“You could try giving Tony a second chance.” Jan suggested gently.
And Steve would make something stupidly anti-patriotic up.
Tony made the shift back to human, the process long and painful, though he didn’t let the strain show on his face.
Tony sat back down, and clasped his hands together, leaning forward. He had his “I fucked up” face on.
Before he could ask any more questions the green guy was hustled off the stage and it was time for a new contestant. Tony would have to find him later. For now he suffered through another twenty contestants, Christine cutting him off whenever he tried to talk and the teleprompter no longer showing his name, until they reached the last one.
“I think I’d like that.”
“Didn’t Tony give you an override? One that didn’t change?”
“It’s not like that and you know it.”
“Especially my boyfriend, who sees me struggling and does nothing to help.”
Steve was looking at him, a mixture of curiosity and pride waring in his eyes. “You know many things for a healer.”
“Reunion not what you hoped for?” He guessed.
“See, the whole time we’ve been here, I haven’t been able to get you out of my mind.”
Tony cleared his throat. “Ok, well, I’m going to go fast because I don’t do sentimental, just ask Pepper.
Another week passed, and Steve was outside fixing up the fence, for the ten thousandth time. Dottie stood nearby, watching her escape hatch be blocked up yet again with terrible disappointment. Still, it had to be done. He straightened the fence post and began rewrapping the wire. He heard a rustle behind him and assumed it was Dottie so when Tony tackled him he let out a squawk and fell into the fence post, knocking it back over.
“I’m going to need to get going today.”
“....I wouldn’t be opposed. No one said I had to go back tomorrow. If anything, it’d be easier if I stayed. Less paperwork, you know?” Tony hedged, looking at Steve out of the corner of his eye, body tense as he picked up a wrench and fiddled with it.
Sam crossed his arms and leaned back in his chair. “So we’re supposed to sit here on our asses and wait?”
Tony started pulling off his clothes off and Steve waited to see how he would do. He shouldn’t have worried. After a short pause Tony’s fur started to grow in in waves, his bones and joints reforming with only a single painful sounding pop. In less than a minute Tony hopped up with a happy yip. Steve returned the happy yip, congratulating him as well as he could with no way to speak. Steve trotted over and gave him a greeting sniff and recoiled. The scent of metal and soot was a lot stronger with his wolf nose, and Tony had spent most of the afternoon trying to fix the oven, then the washing machine. Tony gave his paw a sheepish lick, then made a face of disgust and gave up. He rolled around in the dirt to cover up the smell, leaving himself dusty and with a leaf perched comically on the top of his head. Steve shook his head at him in fond exasperation, and trotted off deeper into the woods. His pack followed loyally behind him, as he searched the air for the scent of something to hunt.
Tony would whisper, “I miss you, I love you, I’m sorry too, let’s go back to the way things were,”
Steve crossed his arms. “So we're going to have to deal with furniture everywhere for the rest of the week, and have to deal with all of the noise and security risks of a party? Great.” he sighed.
Above them a fake clapping track played and Tony tried not to wince. The illusion worked on TV, but in person it felt jarring. Were there really no people for this part? Was this new, or has it always been this way and Tony hadn’t paid close enough attention to notice?
“C’mon Stevie, give him a chance!”
“What is Tony doing?” Steve asked Jan as she walked up beside him.
Tony smiled back widely. It felt good to be close to someone in the chill of the tunnel, and being around Steve made him feel better. He had been scared out of his mind when he first entered the arena, and he had been in a constant panic until Steve stumbled out in front of him and he dragged him into his cave. Having someone else there, someone else to turn to when he was hurt or struggling, was the only thing making this horrible experience bearable.
“Well it’s not good enough!”
Was it wrong of him to wish she'd quit being so goddamn understanding? That Clint would stop looking at him with such hope, like there was nothing to worry about because good old Steve would always find a way out for them? He felt like he was drowning and his packmates were thanking him for pulling them down with him. He was out of ideas and out of options. He never would have gone to Stane otherwise.
He followed Sam down the hall, where they met Natasha in the mess.
“All three days of it?” asked Jan with a snort.
“That must be why I trusted you from day one,” Tony responded playfully.
“You’re preventing me from doing my job. We were separated by glass, there was nothing he could have done.” Tony complained.
“We’re going to negotiate the terms of our return to the US and to the Avengers, I have a list of reasons why it would be beneficial to all parties-”
"What? Why?" Tony asked. This was the only part of being Game Master that he had done right so far, he wasn’t going to leave in the middle!
“I don’t have a lot of shame, but I’m not willing to blow you on national television. Pass me the pills.”
“You’re still a threat,” Tony said, but lowered his hand and refolded the gauntlet into a thick watch band. He flopped back down onto his bed with a sigh.
He reached out a hand and rubbed away the condensation, and jumped back in shock.
“Tones? What happened today? They hustled you out of there really fast.”
She ignored him. “They’ll be spending the next week training, and I’ll see you all again for their final score before they go into the games!”
The kid had introduced himself as Bryce or Bruce or something like that and was squirming awkwardly in his seat, clearly uncomfortable with being on TV. Tony wondered why he volunteered if he didn’t want to be here.
Now it turned out that Steve needed to take care of Tony much more than Tony needed to be taken care of.
“I’ll just cook, all alone, because no one in this tower loves or appreciates me.” Tony yelled.
“I didn’t even know the last guy retired, he seemed so young.” Tony mused. “I tried to reach out to him to get some tips and I couldn’t find him anywhere.”
He liked that version better. He liked the idea of all the doubts he had had over the last few months being drowned out by a loud resounding “I love you”, all his insecurities soothed by a balm of kisses, all the baggage burned away by a fire of passion.
Tony grinned up at him with bloody teeth. “You can’t kill me, the whole world is watching! They all want to see the winner of the games and there will be questions if they don’t! You want to take my winnings? Go for it! I have more money than I know what to do with! You want to beat me? Good luck doing anything worse than what I’ve already been through.”
Steve gestured at the rows of tables, and dragged him around the corner to reveal a second area as big as the first.
“We always fight, that's how siblings work, Mister Only Child. It'll all work out, you'll see.”
Was that the boy’s name? James?
Tony offered Steve some caramel corn. “So, who’s Bucky?”
“I am. That’s why you love me.”
Tony opened his eyes and blinked up at Steve. Steve kissed him then pulled him into a hug. From over Steve’s shoulder Tony saw that the room was filling with people. The Dragon Guard, the rebels from the mining camp. They all parted to let the other man from the prison pass. He had washed off his face and pulled his long hair back into a low ponytail, for the first time in months he was once again recognizable as Thor Odinson, the rightful king. Tony and Steve struggled to their feet and started to bow. Thor held out a hand and stopped them, instead pulling both of them into a bear hug.
“I can’t promise I’ll be able to change anything, I’ve been branded a traitor, no one would listen to me-”
“Fine!” Tony spun and stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him. Steve laid down on the bed, eyes staring vacantly at the door.
“She was born three years ago.”
“Why?”
And thus ended his wedding day.
“Clint. Enough.” Steve said, crossing his arms. The game was up.
“You’re like, two months older, if even. That’s nothing.”
“Right, Thor, he needs help.” Steve was awkwardly trying to lean back without looking like he was pushing Tony away. Tony leaned forward, immediately closing the space again.
Steve tiredly rubbed his face. “I guess. If he still wants to stay tomorrow, he can stay. If he wants to go, I'm not stopping him. The best you'll get out of me, Jan, so just let it go.”
Many of you left me kudos and/or incredible comments, which I appreciate so much. You guys are what make publishing worth it!
He scowled. “I’d rather Tony be mad than dead. We’re going.”
“I don't give tours,” the man said with annoyance. “Look, this number is for serious business inquiries only. Who are you and how’d you get my number?”
“Surrender,” Tony demanded. Stane let his hands fall to the ground, open palmed. Tony got up, and held out a hand to Stane. He would get a trial, and his fate would be decided by the people he controlled for so many years. Stane grabbed his hand and used it to pull him to the ground. Tony clipped his head on the corner of the desk and fell with a pained shout. Stane got up and stomped on Tony’s hand, forcing his fingers to open around the knife. Stane grabbed him by the front of the shirt and slammed him on the desk. He stabbed him over and over, Tony’s back arching with pain and his mouth filling with blood while he screamed. The knife got stuck in a rib, the handle too slippery for Stane to pull it out, so he left it and rested with one hand on the edge of the desk, panting as Tony struggled to draw a breath. Tony felt the world grow dark and fuzzy around the edges, the pain seeming to grow until it was the only thing he could feel, his hands and feet going numb. His tongue felt thick in his mouth, fighting for space against the blood welling up and pouring out down the corners of his mouth. He tried to speak and it came out as a gurgle.
“Super soldier, can't get sick.” Steve reminded him. “Now we need to make the glaze.”
"Does anyone have anything we could wrap this with? Natasha? Clint?”
He pulled out the bottom drawer of the dresser and grabbed a pair of pants and a shirt. Even if Bucky returned, Steve still felt like an intruder in the space that had lain empty for so long. He hurried back downstairs, half expecting Bucky to be gone and for all of it to have been a dream. He rounded the corner and Bucky was still there, sitting in the kitchen and laughing with Jan and Clint. Steve could almost pretend that the last year hadn’t happened, that they were just fooling around before dinner like normal, and any second now his Ma would come downstairs and yell at them all to get helping with dinner or get out of her kitchen. Of course, Tony had never been at the table back then.
Tony pulled away a little, now composed, and shook his head. “I don’t want to take some other person’s family ring, in some sort of loop of shitty luck. We’ll figure something out later.”
Clint agreed, barely listening as he ran his hands up and down the shiny silver finish, mumbling about how much left over pizza he was going to save now.
“When was it unsuspended?”
Tony made sure to watch only the legal requirement's worth of the games after that, and at night when most of the contestants were sleeping and there was nothing going on.
“They’re hurting each other just because they wanna?”
The guards cuffed their hands roughly and dragged them into the castle where they were hustled through the hallways until they reached the throne room. The guards marched them inside and forced them to their knees in front of the golden throne, where Loki sat. Upon their entrance, he had risen to his feet with a frown on his face. When he realized who it was in front of him his frown turned into a wicked smile.
“Who cares for the past?” she scoffed.
Steve took the bait, more than eager to talk about her. “She is, isn’t she. From the first second in her presence you can tell she is strong of body and kind of heart. She saved my life more times than I can count. Her name is Liberty.”
“What happened to being honest?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve gave him a kiss. “Happy birthday, Sweetheart.”
Hammer sat down and grinned at the cameras. “Alright, let’s get this show on the road! May I present the 74th winner of the Hunger Games, Tony Stark!”
He wanted to know what technology the districts had access to. His first stop had been the public database library, which primly told him that the districts refused to use anything more advanced than a wood burning stove, which clearly wasn’t true. He needed to go directly to the source, and who better than the guy who had opinions on quantum computing?
“So now it’s time to set you up.”
“Everywhere in all the bedrooms, including under all the beds and in all the closets, and all the living rooms that aren't blocked off. And none of the boards are disturbed. And he wasn't in the barn when I went to let the cattle out.”
“Catapult maintenance. His royal highness suspects that the rebels are gathering in the mountains and wanted everything to be prepared in case of assault.”
Time passed and Steve dozed, not asleep, but resting. Tony shifted rolled over in his sleep and Steve pulled him close and wrapped an arm around his chest. He felt something cold and hard and he stiffened. He carefully felt around Tony’s chest, his fingers following a diamond shaped outline of metal resting under the thin fabric of his shirt.
Once the games ended, would they never see each other again?
Steve blushed. Ok, yeah, maybe he had been staring. Tony had a good nose, even for a wolf. Or maybe he should quit putting off laundry.
“Where do you think they took Bucky?” Tony asked.
Tony accepted his kisses with good grace and stole a cupcake from Clint’s tray.
There was a pause on the other side of the line. “Though I am under contract not to discuss any ghostwritten pieces, I have a strong history of published work and could show you some writing samples if you’re looking for a discrete author.”
Steve shrugged. “The ranch is safe, if that's what you're asking. And…. just nothing, I guess.”
Steve seemed very sure of himself, so Tony dropped it for the moment. The members of the alliance would most likely turn on each other like rabid dogs, just like every other year Tony had watched the games. Still, until then it could be useful. Tony had limited food, and Steve knew the location of his cave so he would have to move on anyway. If he had to survive in the woods he would rather do it with people who had been outside a city before.
“That’s not the point.”
Thanks for reading!
Clint and Jan finally got over their shock enough to run over and join the hug. Steve opened one of his arms to include them, and kept one tight around Bucky.
Tony stepped back, half in shock. Steve grabbed him and hid his face in his shoulder, and Tony could feel him shuddering.
“I just had a brilliant idea. How do you feel about arranged marriages?”
Natasha got him interesting mechanical wind up toys she had seen on a mission. Bruce got him a fancy type of coffee, and Thor and Jane got him a device they had created to detect magic. The rest of them got him gag gifts, Clint giving him wrinkle cream for being such an old man. Pepper got him a pen filled with invisible ink, so if he forget to sign paperwork again he could claim he did sign it, invisibly. Rhodey got him a Iron Patriot t-shirt, which Tony balled up and threw at his friend’s head.
“You got another hostile approaching from the back, Cap, duck!”
Sam yelled at his retreating back, “You’re going to remember this conversation tomorrow!”
They brought the milk inside where Jan was trying to casually interrogate Tony. Some people would call it harassment. Jan called it “Getting the deets” and was downright ruthless. Tony didn’t seem phased. Probably was used to worse, with a larger pack back home.
Bucky sighed. “See, that’s what I’m worried about. I’m trying to look out for you.”
They stared at each other for a beat and Steve wondered if he had pushed Tony slightly too far.
“Jan!” he gasped, scandalized.
Natasha got up. “I can go hunt or look for berries. We should try to save the gifts for important things.”
Steve is reckless, Tony doesn't follow orders, I'm sure that's a huge surprise to everyone
Tony laughed wetly. “You’re such a sap.”
“I didn’t know it was him.”
Steve immediately flushed bright red and Tony smiled. Oh, this was going to be fun. “It seems like we’ve hardly had a moment together before unfortunate circumstances are ripping us apart. First being sent here, then the rest of the team finding us, and now poor Thor.”
He started to wrap the bandage and Tony grabbed onto Steve’s hand in a death grip. Steve shook him off and back away, his face red, uncomfortable with being touched now despite how close they had slept last night and his blase attitude about it this morning. Tony would have wondered about it more if it didn’t feel like someone was going at his ankle with a hammer. Could they just chop the whole foot off? It might hurt less at this point.
How many victors had lashed out against anyone that came close, Tony wondered, their minds ground away by the arena until everyone and everything appeared to be a threat?
Natasha kneeled down beside him and pulled him into a hug. Clint bowed his head in grief.
In previous chapters, Steve decides to marry Tony to get his dowry to save the ranch. Problems arise, but they're are finally able to pay off their debts. Bucky comes back, and is worried about Steve's decision because he doesn't trust the Starks and thinks Steve is in too deep to see clearly. After a fight, Bucky leaves to go investigate further.
“What if you made it bigger? Made it the circumference of the whole top of the boot and had them put their leg through the middle?”
There were several loud bangs and the doors to the office were kicked open, the Avengers rushing in with Shield behind them and Steve leading the way. The last thing Tony saw before the world blurred away was Steve reaching for him, agonized look on his face.
“Um. No. See you around, Tony.”
Before he had time to come to terms with that, they were sending him to Stuttgart, Germany, where the Chitauri had started a second invasion. New York was the first time they had won a victory against the aliens, and now they needed Steve again. With all his friends dead, he had no reason to say no. He headed out to the front tomorrow, this time with no loop to catch him if he stumbled.
“You tell me.”
Steve put his head in his hands. “Jesus. Not enough. Nothing is ever enough, is it?”
Tony pulled his shirt off and turned the battery in his chest until it clicked. He pulled it out and it lit the shadows of the room with a soothing blue. He used his crippled hand to hold it to his stomach as he carefully cleared the broken shards out of the casing in Liberty’s chest. He eased the battery in and Liberty drew in a breath. Tony felt himself tilt backwards and he found himself staring out the broken roof and up at the stars. They all seemed to blur together into a swirl of light. He was sad that he had never gotten to go flying with Liberty. His view was ruined when Steve dragged him upright and leaned him against Liberty's side. He put both hands on the sides of Tony’s face. “Tony, listen to me. You need to let us in.”
“You don’t have to be perfect, you just have to be you, and that’s more than enough. The team doesn’t follow you because they think you have all the answers, or because they’re caught up in some warped form of hero worship. Well, maybe Scott is a little star struck. Everyone else though, we follow you because we know you’ll always try to do the right thing, and you won’t stop fighting until you get there. You’re an idealist in a world of cynics, and when you speak to us you shine with a light of conviction that’s blinding. You burn away everything until all that is left is the fact that the world isn’t fair, and we have the power to make it better. You’ve always had that inside you, regardless of your stage name or whether or not you could bench press a car.”
Steve shrugged and lead them down the stairs and out the front, waving at the man and his dog as they passed. “If I cared about writing I’d publish under my own name. Ghost writing puts food on the table while I wait for my career in painting to take off.”
Tony’s mind immediately went into the gutter. It took a huge force of will to keep himself from asking Steve if he would let Tony get to second base. Stupid baseball metaphors. He cleared his throat. “I think that’s as good as I’m going to get when it comes to baseball.”
“You’re shivering,” Tony countered.
“The point is that the list goes on, all situations where I was trying to help and everything spiraled out of control. I never talk to you until it’s too late and all the chips are on the table. And when I don’t talk to you, you don’t talk to me.”
“What the hell?” he whispered to himself. He fisted his hand in his hair and leaned forward, staring blankly at the floor.
“Are you even hearing yourself? That’s crazy. Beyond crazy. How much did you have to drink before you came over here?”
He walked across the stage, and instead of sitting in the interview chair like a good little contestant he charged up to Tony and started jabbing him in the chest with a finger.
Clint slapped his hand to his back pocket with a gasp. Jan covered her eyes in embarrassment and Steve looked at him in disbelief. How Clint had gotten this far in life without learning even the very basics of lying was beyond him.
It sounded stupid to Tony even as he said it. They couldn’t all win. Eventually they were going to  have to turn on each other. He didn’t want to think about it.
“You cancelled it? Why? I mean, the chairs in the living room weren’t great, but we could have lived with it for a few days, you didn’t need to cancel the whole thing.”
Tony scoffed. “That was a home run worthy swing. Get a real ball, and I’ll prove it.”
Tony blinked at him. “What? Is this a joke? Did Clint put you up to this?”
anytime soon.
Brian nodded and stood up. He grabbed a pen from the waitress and walked behind Steve to Tony. He took Tony's hand and wrote his phone number down in large black numbers.
“No! You can’t put that you liar! You didn’t even ask me that one yet!”
“I’ve been missing you too, Darling,” he drawled, low and husky.
I'm sorry guys, it's been like two months since I last updated. I got a full time internship and I never got around to quitting my job that I did at nights, so I had absolutely no free time the whole summer. Now I'm back at college so I have time to write again, and I know not to start posting stories until I'm done writing them. It's very stressful leaving a story incomplete. Hope you enjoy the ending, and thanks for reading!
He had been wearing dirty clothes for over three weeks and he was sick of it. He shoved the clothes in a basket, walked downstairs to the basement and tossed them in the washing machine with a cup of soap. The machine made a horrible grinding noise as he turned it on, and the wheel inside didn’t spin. Steve opened the door, and manually gave it a push. The motor caught, and the laundry started turning. He shut the lid, his arm now soaked. Tony was standing behind him.
This wasn’t the time or place to push it. The shop owner cleared his throat, and gestured at the case. “There are other rings here, if you’d like.”
The light on the camera shut off and Tony stood, grabbing Steve as he toppled forward and keeping his head from slamming into the wood paneled floor. “I’ve got him, come on, let’s go.”
A couple months later Steve tossed the last of Tony’s suitcases in the back of the truck as the sun started peeking out from behind the mountains. They both got in the truck, and Steve started it up. Only took him one try, since Tony redid the wiring. Steve drove them both the long drive to Stark Industries where he parked the car and Tony got out. He watched as Tony made his way to the front door and stepped inside.
The hot fan he had met in the coffee shop ended up being named Christine, and he left the shop with her number and an agreement to get drinks that week at a bar that he had written about in his book.
Thankfully Yinsen didn’t fight him, instead looping an arm around his shoulders and helped to support his weight as they traveled as quickly as they could. The forest was large and they could have headed in any direction, so Tony hoped that Raza wouldn’t be able to catch up despite their slow pace because of Tony’s limp. They traveled for about ten minutes, and Tony felt hope building in his chest. Maybe they had escaped safely?
“I’ll do it,” Steve responded without hesitation. Strange sighed and shook his head, but agreed to perform the spell to send Steve in. Steve laid down on the bench next to the table, Tony already filling that. Strange waved his hands and the faces of Steve’s team mates disappeared in a swirl of orange.
“The contestants are volunteers, right?” he asked desperately when Rhodey picked up.
In this chapter, they get good news then bad news then good news.
“You like me right?”
So, never.
In previous chapters, Steve agrees to marry Tony to use his dowry to save his ranch. Things don't go to plan and they pawn their stuff to buy a computer. Tony must try to use the computer to earn the money, before the bank forecloses on them or the wedding happens while Tony's ring is still at the pawn shop. Despite all the stress, they have a nice day running around as wolves.
Tony pressed a hand over his eye. He knew Steve was lying, he was trying to convince Natasha, but each word cut deep, because most of it wasn’t too far from the truth, was it? Their relationship was founded on lying and manipulation. Steve had hated him the first time they met, and the longer they had spent together the better they had started to understand each other. What could grow between them if they were given a year? Two? Ten? Instead they got three days, three short days locked up in an arena where pain and death hid around every corner, and their number one priority had to be survival over honesty.
“Do they really need to set us up though? We’re engaged, it’s a done deal. Though, you are a tiny bit hopeless.” He said, holding up his fingers a little apart to demonstrate his hopelessness in terms of physical inches. It was three inches of hopelessness, by Steve’s estimation. He crossed his arms. Did that mean he didn't like him anymore? Was he right earlier and Tony wanted to string him along to embarrass him? Was this flirting? Should he flirt back? What should he say? Would he get mad if he said the wrong thing? Probably. No, definitely. Tony had a shorter temper than him, and he didn’t want to piss him off again in case this really was… something. He didn’t know what to say. It should be interesting, he wanted to impress him. Wait, since when did he ever care about what other people thought? Fucking feelings, always being confusing. And now Steve had zoned out again, he needed to say something before it got weird.
$21,000 was printed, neat as you please, made out to Rogers.
It was too late, they were already gone. The man moaned in grief. From what Tony could see in the dark, he was covered in dirt and had a long beard. Whoever he was, he had been trapped here for a very long time. Tony peered at him through the bars of his cell.
“We might be here a while,” he said sheepishly.
“Thanks Nat.”
I came here lost. I was reevaluating my life to the point where I no longer knew who I was. I hated what I was doing, and when I stopped I wasn’t welcome in my pack. I had nowhere to go, until I came here, and found acceptance. For me, and for my wolf. I was always trying to deny a part of myself, locking up my wolf, thinking I was dangerous, a monster on so many levels. You loved me to the point where I learned to love myself.
not doing laundry, and put on the cleanest of his shirts. He trotted out to the barn, and opened the door to let the cows out. He grabbed the basket by the door, and started gathering the eggs from beneath the sleepy hens. He filled his basket in no time, and went back inside the house. He slotted them into cartons without washing them. Eggs naturally had a coating around the outside protecting them, and washing it off made them spoil faster. It probably wouldn't fly in the big city supermarkets, but out here people appreciated it. He filled as many cartons as he could while still reserving eggs for his pack’s breakfast. The stove was still in pieces, so he cracked the eggs into a pot, whisked them together with a fork and shoved them in the oven set to ‘volcano’. Jan wandered downstairs into the kitchen.
Steve’s fingers curled back and he tried to draw back his hand. Tony held on, his thumb rubbing gently across the pulse in his wrist. It grounded him.
“I don’t have a middle name.”
“Yeah, that guy. He’d give us money to pay everything off and we could start over.”
The peacekeeper slapped him across the face, and as Tony stumbled back he felt the cut inside his mouth reopen. He carefully pressed his fingertips to his cheek where the skin strung hot and red and looked up at the guards. Steve stepped up behind him and pressed an ice pack into his hand and held Tony’s wrist until he held it up by himself. Steve put an arm around his waist and tugged him forward, with two peacekeepers in front and the other two falling into step behind.
“So if he did like you like you like him, you’d like that he like likes you?”
“It’s coming from the parachute,” Clint said, pointing. Their eyes followed his finger to land on a white speck, coming closer and closer. It landed on the ground in front of them, still beeping softly. Steve stepped forward cautiously and picked it up. There was a white paper note attached to the top of a metal container. Steve twisted the container open to reveal a thick roll of white bandages.
“He'll come around in time, promise. And if he doesn't, I'll marry you anyway.”
Steve just shook his head in pure disbelief. Bucky. After all this time, Bucky was here, he was alive, he was healthy. Jan and Clint pulled him to the kitchen table to weasel out more details about where he’d been, and Tony tentatively joined them. Steve went up stairs to grab his brother some clothes. When he pushed open the door to Bucky’s room a cloud of dust swirled up. No one had been inside for the entire time he had been dead. Except he hadn't been dead. Just missing.
“And come back in two hours because I miss my computers. And maybe you too.”
“That didn’t stop me from going after Bucky and it will not stop me now. Two people stand no more chance of being spotted than one, and this way I can act as a look out while you do your work.” He turned to everyone else at the table. “Gather everyone capable of fighting, we march for the castle at first light tomorrow.”
At Steve’s look Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I was having a bit of a melt down and Obie wanted to shuffle me out of the way before I did something really stupid and hurt the pack."
“Potato, potahto. It’s for your own good.”
“You’re such a dick sometimes. Would one little photo really hurt? It’d make Obie happy, and you want to make him happy don’t you, after all he’s done for you.”
eggs.”
Tony looked down. “I have picked up things here and there.”
Cap turned his gaze to the other man. He was dressed in a combat uniform much like his own, but with the British flag stretched across his chest in bright red, white, and blue. Steve spoke into the comms, updating his team. “The hostage is not a civilian, it's Captain Britain. He seems dazed but unharmed. The hostile has not tried to engage, I'm going to try to initiate peace talks.”
Tony nodded. Later wouldn’t matter, since he was leaving as soon as the battle was over. They made their way to the guard tower, and down the stairs inside until they reached the bottom level. Tony lead them around the back of the stables, to where the planes were kept. They walked confidently, like they had every right to be there, and no one questioned them as they entered the large double doors and shut them firmly behind them. Steve stuck a broom handle through the door, so that no one could get curious and wander in on them. Meanwhile Tony was bent over the first plane, tugging at the battery. If he unplugged it completely it would set off an alert for the pilot, who could simply plug it back in. Or if stolen, it could be easily replaced. He needed to make it so that the gauges all read that there was power, but the planes would crash as soon as they made it out of the hanger, exploding straight into Loki’s troops and wall defenses. He finished his work on the first plane, and moved on the second as Steve paced nervously behind him, and Tony could feel his anxiety.
Jan and Clint exchanged a look, communicating silently. Jan nodded at Clint, and he darted out of the room with a muttered excuse. Jan then grabbed Tony’s arm and led him to the kitchen. “Well, let’s get some food into you before we send you off.”
“You never played baseball as a kid?” Steve asked.
“Yes!”
There were three arrows left, and the one with the tip was still there. Natasha had been the ones who sunk them into the ground, so she had to go last because she had a greater chance of knowing which one it was. Tony and Bruce looked at each other, and Bruce held out his arm, offering Tony the next pick. Tony slid down the side of the cornucopia, and shivered as he stepped away from its heated warmth. He carefully considered the three arrows remaining. All their feathers ended at the same height, and none of them showed in cracks in the wood of the shaft that might have indicated that they were broken. There was no way to tell which one was the one. He took a deep breath and pulled one at random, closing his eyes as he pulled. The arrow slipped from the dirt smoothly and he knew the result before he opened his eyes.
“Right now? A mess. I’m hoping it will somehow turn into muffins at some point.”
“We’re going.” Steve said firmly.
“You’re very forward today.”
Stane dragged Tony from the chair and slammed him down on the desk, knocking the breath out of him and sending papers and pens flying. Tony’s hands scrabbled at Stane’s hand where it was wrapped around his throat, trying to force him off. Stane slammed him down again with a snarl. “The Capitol will prevail like it always does, and at the end of this waste of time I’m going to kill every single district rat involved, and I’m going to start with you.”
“No.”
Yay, happy ending! I ended up finishing in less chapters than I expected, but I'm glad I finished before Endgame. Thanks for reading my story, let me know if you liked it!
Steve crawled out of the cave and the girl helped pull him to his feet. “I’m fine. Are you all ok?”
“Tony wouldn’t do that,” he insisted with a scowl.
“Steve, you’re hurting me by locking me out.”
But enough of that, it had been months since Steve had gotten to spar, and if anyone deserved a good bite, it was Tony. Steve made the first move, stepping forward and trying to get a mouthful of Tony’s tail. Tony spun out of the way and returned to circling. Steve lunged forward with a snap of his jaws and his opponent ducked back again.
Everyone shuffled together their things and got up, leaving the room as a tired pack. Most of them headed towards the dining center but the peacekeeper held Tony back.
Pepper sighed in exasperation. “What are you going to do with an Instagram?”
Howard scowled at her. “No one has ever said that they have to kill each other.”
He was lonely.
“I regret ever loving you.”
The two younger wolves pouted, but went out to the field to start milking the cows. He still didn’t like Tony, and he was better than to lead someone on just because they were useful to him. He wasn’t going to pretend to like him just for free work then send him home as soon as he stopped being useful. Unless something changed, Tony was going home tomorrow.
“I was looking for inconsistencies,” Tony tried to explain as Steve frowned at him. “It was mostly train footage, I’m not stalking you.”
Steve was unimpressed. “Let him go and I'll get you to prison in one piece.”
He looked back in confusion. Going on? Wait a minute, he thought.
“I’ll be here.”
“Where are we going? Hey, you can’t do this to me! Obie! OBIE!”
“Steve, we like him. We’re keeping him.”
Welp. That was enough for the day, time to go crawl into a ditch and die. He turned around and Jan grabbed his arm and pulled him back. “Go talk to him!” She hissed.
“When you say it like that, it’s a lot of stuff. But I never notice any of that. I go to bed and stare at the ceiling and everything is so dead quiet it makes my thoughts a hundred times louder until it’s been hours and it’s dark and I can’t sleep because everything is just rattling around and I just really need to know if you like me. Because we sort of had a moment, like a
After his funeral I went home, and reevaluated my entire life. Everything I had ever done could be summed up as building bigger and bigger bombs. And what was the point of that? Why did I spend every waking moment forcing my wolf down, containing the beast inside me so that I wouldn’t hurt anyone, so that I could turn around and kill hundreds with my weapons? The wolf wasn’t the monster, I was.
“Then whose fault was it?”
“Yeah. It was easy, I was the one who designed them. Though they were meant to be to protect our borders, I have no idea who approved their use in here. Once I’m out of here I’m going to be having strict words with people, I don’t know how this mistake could have happened.”
Jan was sharpening her pocket knife on the porch when she heard a loud banging from inside. Curious, she went inside to investigate. She found Steve smashing at the washing machine with a hammer.
“You mean we should ask the sponsors?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded. Tony shook his head. “It made you upset last time when we kissed. I’m not going to force you.”
“Steve? Steve, you need to wake up, Steve, please, baby please wake up, c’mon…”
“Not Pepper-”
“I knew you would see things my way. Come, my camp is this way.”
The first contestant entered and the skill trials begin. Each contestant was ranked between 1 and 12, the higher the better. There was no set requirements for what they had to do, it was up to the contestant to show off what they thought was most impressive.
The broadcast ended and the tv switched to playing a reality show. Tony turned it off.
Tony went upstairs and came back with a clean shirt. Steve switched tops as Tony neatly cracked the eggs into the bowl using both hands. Steve added the lemon juice and Tony mixed the wet ingredients together and poured it into the dry. He mixed that too, as Steve got out the muffin tins and rubbed them with shortening so the batter wouldn’t stick. Tony carefully poured an equal amount into each cup, and Steve slid it into the oven and set a timer for twenty minutes.
“Hello, Mr. Rogers.” the aging man said.
“Our team is here, let’s go eat. You can build rocket boots for strangers later.”
It gave.
Tony clenched up, and Steve stopped entirely, finding the lube, squirting more on where they were joined, rubbing slightly to warm it up.
“Steve.”
Steve inhaled, licking his lips.
She understood.
Silence.
Tony was about to give him a funny quip, but lost all thought when Steve’s fingers trailed up his thighs, stopping when he pushed against the back of his sac.
“I don’t want you to have to worry about anything if I tell you, Pep. It’s just…honestly nothing. Just a fleeting thought, really.”
“Steve.” The soldier corrected, raising an eyebrow.
Steve took in his broken posture, feeling his chest constrict at the almost child like expression on Tony’s face.
“Why did you do that, you stupid fuck!” Tony was yelling at him, trails of tears streaking his face.
“I know baby, you got another in you though, I can tell. Come on, come for me again.” Steve goaded, feeling his balls draw up, his come rushing out to burrow inside Tony’s ass.
This wasn’t happening.
Steve tensed up, but didn’t try to shove Tony off, if anything, he pulled him closer by the upper arms.
"Not just like that, Tony! But, I'm not enough for you! Don't you think it's better to end this with a whisper, instead of with a scream? And it will, in due time. Because like it or not Tony, you know I'm right and that we just,
Steve chewed his lip, to keep from crying as well.
“It’s not all on you, Tony. It’s on me as well. It’s just…Christ. I don’t know.” He finished lamely, hanging his head, moving himself off of the other man.
Steve huffed but clenched his fingers into the bed sheets, watching as Tony settled his weight on Steve's hips.
Could Tony handle him leaving?
over that man for years. The last five were better, I‌ suppose. But only because you were angry at him. But you gave him your arc reactor." She said to him, betrayal on her face, her heart pinching, remembering when he had given it to
All his fault.
Steve tried to get back up before the brunette was upon him, pinning him to the gravel, his metal fingers holding him down.
“Thank you.”
And she waited, wiping tears off her cheeks.
“If it was nothing, you would have told me by now.” She said to him, unimpressed with his lackadaisical excuse.
“I haven’t come without being touched in years Steve, and you saying that almost made me shoot off like a 15 year old virgin.”
like two friends. But, even before then, he watched the super soldier, and it really annoyed him that he was
Yeah, she knew all about Steve, and how her husband of five years was in love with him.
“Hm. Barnes? That’d be a little difficult I guess.”
“And right now, I’m having a very hard time controlling myself.” He whispered to the brunette.
“If you think that this is easy for me, in any way, than you’re an idiot.” Steve hissed, glaring at Tony now.
That night, in his bed, Tony laid there, staring up at the ceiling, recounting the events of the day.
Steve watched as the man rambled, layers of clothes falling back on his person.
Her hands were shaking though, but she didn’t want him to see.
Oh God, he was in pain.
Steve smiled, nuzzling his temple gently.
Pepper looked at his paling face, his fingers shaking as he clenched them together, the blood no doubt draining away from them.
Strange raised his eyebrow.
Tony rolled his eyes.
“No. I was in my little shop downstairs, doing more research. I couldn't fall asleep.”
Steve smiled, nudging Tony's hand with his cheek.
The deepness took Tony's breath away, yet left him wanting more.
“I don’t understand. You have never shown a hint of loving me, not at all.”
She sobbed then.
Turning, Steve moved to leave, but Stephen stopped him.
She smiled up at Steve, “Sure, of course.”
He hadn’t responded to the calls, but he had shot off a few text messages, telling her things were really wound up here, and he needed to stay.
Tony snarled, shoving at him, managing to move him a little bit out of the way.
Reaching up, Steve moved to cup Tony’s cheek. The brunette jerked though, away from Steve’s hand.
your feelings for him to the side. Remember that? Remember the binges, Tony. I‌ have never seen you that broken up before."
“When I touch you like this, it’s not to…goad you into something that will screw you over, it’s because I care for you. And I want to see you safe and happy. I’ve been trying for months to show you how much I care for you.”
“Let me tell you about destiny, Strange. It’s nonsense.”
Pepper shook her head, clearing her thoughts, the events of the past making her stomach hurt.
mouthed brat has you wrapped around his finger."
“No Tony, this has absolutely nothing to do with Sharon. I don’t even, Christ, I don’t even talk to her. I spoke to her
“Um, well, it could stem from the fact that I watched multiple people turn to ashes in front of me.” Steve mumbled in a gravelly voice.
Steve watched, not moving from his spot. Not knowing what to do or what to say in this situation.
Steve didn’t chuckle, his face falling.
“You could have fooled me.”
But, Tony was Iron Man, and he would always
“Why would Mr. All American perfect want to be with me?” Tony asked in a hiss.
"Something did happen tonight, and God, I'm so sorry." He said, wringing his hands together.
“Um, are you looking for these?” A female voice caught his attention.
And he succeeded.
The super soldier didn't know the
Steve sniffled, and moved back from Tony.
He felt himself harden.
Pepper was eyeing him, observing his expressions, watching as he paced in front of his table.
Tony nodded, brushing a thumb through his goatee.
Steve rubbed his nose, sniffling.
“Don’t be crass. You know that isn’t it
"Take it Tony, goddamn you, fucking
This was not her fault. It was his fault, and he had no right to feel any anger towards her.
“No! Steve! I love you too! Please, don’t go! Oh God! Steve!”
“I will carry him, Anthony.” Came Thor’s voice, the taller man moving forward to kneel before Iron Man.
“Shit. Shit.” He moaned, gritting his teeth, flinging himself forward.
Silence, save for heavy breathing.
“They should have left me in that ocean. They should have destroyed me, as soon as they found me. I’ve done nothing but bring horror to this world. None of this would have happened if I had just told you about your parents. We would have been together, we could have stopped him. A-And Natasha wouldn’t have had to THROW herself off that cliff.” Steve mumbled, every word hitting Tony like a bullet.
The blonde in question was panting, anger in every crevice of his face.
Tony wound his hips in circles, lifting up a little with his thigh muscles, Steve's length leaving slightly to be forced back in.
“I don’t go around sleeping with everyone I meet Tony, and right now really isn’t the time.”
Silence.
“She slept in the guest room, we are not doing anything like that with each other.”
“Tony made that sacrifice play because he couldn’t watch you do it. And you are right, it was between him and you. But, I knew, he would never let that happen.”
“Well, do I know this person? Anyone from group?”
"Pep, there's something, something I have to tell you. And-I think you need to sit down for it. I, uh." He stopped, rubbing his eyes.
Pepper felt him tense up more and more, and she pulled away, looking into his face.
The blonde didn’t try to cover himself, or move away.
He had lost…Tony.
Oh, he liked that.
“Uh, the leggy blonde at Shield who drools over you every time you’re in her vicinity?” He snapped right back, a storm brewing in his eyes.
Gasp.
He picked up speed a little bit, jerking Tony off while sucking him, the room growing damp with the sex that was currently happening.
“Y-You’re hard, Steve.” Tony whispered down to him, watching Steve flush at the words.
Steve nodded, licking his lip, feeling the sweat start to form on his hairline.
Tony spun around, coming face to face with the same woman who was here yesterday.
He was leaving?
Tony squeezed his eyes shut.
." She gasped, lower lip trembling, trying to keep the tears at bay.
Tony though, was smiling widely at the ass that he got to stare at.
“Steve?” Tony croaked, feeling the stale air starting to choke him.
The man attached arched his back, groaning.
Two hours later, in the midst of reading a book that was going on and on about the soul stone, Tony felt the book be lifted from his hands and laid on the table.
What was she doing here so
Sighing, he sat back in his chair and rubbed his temples, his brain firing neurons too quickly.
“Friday?” He mumbled, rubbing his temples.
Gritting his teeth, Steve curled into a ball on his bed.
God, this was so wrong, and Pepper didn’t deserve it.
God, had it really been five years?
Tony didn’t know how to respond to that. How was he supposed to tell Steve that he saw how broken up he was on the pier, and didn’t want to leave him behind to deal with this grieving process all by himself?
“Nat? Have you seen Tony?” Steve questioned the spy halfway through the night.
“Y-Your chance? What do you mean by that?”
“What do you think?” Tony muttered, cracking his fingers.
The blonde looked up, watching as Tony shot his way.
But, it wasn’t only that. It was the way Steve
Jealousy, and longing.
"What? You don't believe me?" He questioned hotly.
It wasn’t supposed to be that way.
“Language.” Tony sneered, activating his thrusters to leap out of the way of an oncoming hit.
He knew Steve was gone.
The brunette brushed it off, flapping his hand in dismissal.
Steve was in his outfit of the battle, shield battered and torn in half. Looking around, he noticed it was towards the end, minutes before Tony would be distracting Thanos and grabbing that damn gauntlet.
“No, you’re definitely not. I didn’t mean to imply you were. Just that I like touching you is all.”
Steve glowered even harder, twisting his fists into the bedding.
“Fuck Steve, you can’t do this for very long. I’m teetering on the brink already.” Tony panted, sweat already breaking out on his own forehead.
“It is impossible.” Strange’s stoic voice pierced through him.
Tony watched them interact, watching as Steve gave her little smiles, and she told him things that he found humorous.
for everything.
“I wouldn’t be opposed to it. She is cute.”
It was a feeling that would never be able to be replicated within Steve’s heart.
But he didn't look at her.
“Because you didn’t want to choose, Captain.”
“Captain.” She responded, turning the lights up in his room.
He needed to get home.
“You can move, just go slowly, add more oil.”
“Jarvis, we both know he’d try his level best to break down my door if I said I was feeling even remotely ill.”
Steve didn’t mind, he could’ve fingered him all night and never get tired.
“Steve? What’s going on? Why are you calling at 2 a.m.? Hello?”
"After everything that happened between us, you're lucky I'm still using you like this at all." Tony grumbled, grinding down on Steve's hardness.
Gasp.
Tony whimpered at the words, sparks of arousal racing through him so intense, they sped up his movements.
Silence.
, fuck, if you admit you'd be so empty without my cock filling you up. Admit it, Stark,
“I can’t continue with what we’re doing, Tony.”
Tony snorted.
Tony was stricken, couldn’t bring himself to look away from the man in front of him.
Pepper processed his words, then threw up her hands, looking at the ceiling.
The Captain looked up at him, eyes filled with tears.
, Steve.”
“Why do you wear shirts, Steve?” Tony questioned him, trying to seriously understand why.
Tony nodded, arching his back, unclenching his cheeks, trying to find some comfort in their positions.
Yes, it was for wounded veterans, but, it brought up way too many of Steve’s insecurities.
“Jackass! What the hell do you think you’re doing?” He huffed out at the man climbing off the floor.
Tony howled then, Steve's abdominals rubbing on his cock while Steve's cock rubbed his prostate.
He seemed borderline hostile about it.
To hell with comfort, they needed to hash a few things out before tomorrow.
Steve followed.
The brunette nodded quickly, huffing his hot breath against Steve’s cheek as they pulled away from each other.
"Morgan is sleeping. I‌ don't want to wake her with loud whispering, or yelling, alright? We always said we'd never let her hear us argue."
Tony flinched.
It was amazing. The pleasure was nothing like Steve had ever experienced.
“What is it, Tony? If you want to stop, just let me know. Anytime.”
She couldn't stay sitting down, she had to pace, or, or something.
Steve groaned, feeling said finger run between his cheeks and push against his own hole, penetrating him and hooking up to graze his sensitive spot.
It was happening, the wind was picking up again, and Steve knew he had to distract the brunette from grabbing Thanos’s hand.
“What’s weird Cap, is you had plenty of time to tell me about my parents. And, what was even more laughable is on that letter you sent.” Tony gritted out, dodging a kick, “You said you were doing it to spare me the pain. Fucking liar.” He hissed, and threw a punch that sent Steve reeling.
Tony nodded, his own hands reaching up to close over Steve’s.
to form, and
“So…nothing between you and Barnes, huh? That isn’t why you fought so hard for him?”
Steve smirked, pushing himself up.
“Me too.” Steve gasped, shoving his nose into Tony’s right ear, panting roughly against the sweaty skin.
“It’s Steve, that’s all. You know how he gets under my skin.” He said flippantly, shrugging his shoulders, feigning annoyance towards the other male.
Steve tucked in and rolled away from an oncoming beam that was coming right towards him.
“And, Pepper will chop off my pecker if I don’t deliver on this. Uh, thanks for the…well, you know, amazing orgasm, Cap.”
in passing.”
"Only if you give it to me Roger's, fuck yes, damn, right there."
Steve nodded, his own face reddening.
“There was nothing between us, I told you that. Do you really not trust what I say, still?”
The brunette arched his hips up, groaning right along with the super soldier.
Steve nodded roughly.
"Off." He grumbled to the blonde, the lax body moving to collapse in a heap by Tony's side.
Steve slowly smiled at the alien fucker, who had finally gotten that he no longer wore the gauntlet when he tried to snap.
Fuck.
One on one this time.
He was stuck.
Steve tried to control the feelings of jealousy and near resentment of the image, but he couldn't help it. Just looking at Tony made him feel so much guilt, it was near crippling.
He had been married, he’d had a child. Domesticity. All the above.
Tony sniffled, wiping his nose quickly.
He stayed in his room for two days after that little scene, not wanting to face anybody, feeling foolish.
Tony growled, glowering right into the stormy blue eyes that looked down at him.
The blonde nodded, grabbing Tony’s thighs again, but running his hand down until he gripped Tony’s left ankle and drew it over his shoulder, leaning up, towering over the smaller male.
The brunette did look at him then, fear and hysteria etching his features.
Tony growled at the last name, bristling at the situation they were now in.
It seemed the respectful thing to do. Not only on Tony’s part, but on Peppers as well.
Tony nodded emphatically, reaching out and grabbing her hand, squeezing her fingers.
Steve saw it in his eyes too, if his shocked expression was anything to go by.
Silence.
Rubbing his temple, Steve let his hand drop heavily.
"I'm sorry." He muttered again, looking directly at her.
"I told you,
She nodded, concerned etched in her expression.
“I’m heading to bed, Tony. Don’t stay down here too long. Big day tomorrow, and you are having breakfast with Morgan before you go, correct?”
Steve shut his eyes tightly, breathing in and out again.
Moving his left hand up, Steve cupped his cheeks fully, stroking his skin.
“Steve? You’ve been locked in your room for going on three days now. I’ve given you space, now, I want to know what the issue is? It’s not like you to shut yourself up in your room.”
“Ah!” Tony moaned, his toes clenching together.
Nodding dumbly, Steve’s left hand played with Tony’s balls lightly, but his right hand wedged in his middle finger, curling them slightly, avoiding Tony’s prostate for the time being.
“So, when you took Bucky to Wakanda you two didn’t spend your wedding night together? Didn’t spend time watching the sunset over the trees? Damn, poor you.” Tony ground out between clenched teeth, knowing he was treading on ice.
“This is my fault, believe me. I missed my chance, and like a selfish bastard, I took it tonight. I’m really sorry.” Steve muttered, sniffling.
“Is that what the kids are calling it these days?” Tony sniggered again.
It left bile in the back of her throat.
“Liar.”
Suddenly, Tony’s face went pale.
Tony sneered, hoisting himself up, grabbing Steve's cock, aligning it with his hole.
“No, it isn’t.” He leveled him with a Captain America stare.
Tony gasped at the quickness of the position change, watching as Steve's blue eyes blazed down at him, big hands gripping his thighs, spreading his legs as wide as they could go, planting his ankles on Steve's shoulders.
He really hoped not. There was no explaining that.
Everything was dimming significantly now.
Pepper caught his eye and held his gaze.
A feeling of possessiveness ran over Steve and he leaned up to take the head of Tony’s manhood into his mouth.
“I’ve seen your kindness and your strength, I’ve seen the best and the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You’re a hell of a man. You’re the one, Tony. The only one…for me.”
“I’ve wanted this for a long time, Steve. Longer than I care to admit.”
“Hands. Off. Rogers.” He hissed, gritting his teeth.
“Look at me.” Steve breathed huskily, twisting his hips in a circle, thrusting slow and deep.
Silence.
Tony slapped Steve's hands away from his hips, growling down at the blonde.
“Better?” He asked, and Tony nodded, patting his arm, rubbing his pale skin.
It had taken him forever to track it down.
Steve tried his best to almost
“I’m not doing this, Steve. You should get some water and go to bed.” Tony said to him, turning his back, meaning to bury this, and walk away.
Not usually good for the two men.
at him, his blue eyes sucking Tony in.
“Mmph.” Tony mumbled against his mouth, laying his full weight on the blonde man, shuddering at the hardness that was pressed into his thigh even harder now.
There was even an occasion where Tony mumbled Steve’s name while sleeping, and that…that was horrible for Pepper.
Friday was turning the lights down a little bit, talking to him in a comforting way.
It was easy to diagnose, really. Tony suffered the same guilty conscious on a regular basis. He always had, especially back when he was destroying the SI weapons.
Blue eyes glared at him.
“It didn’t change our timeline.” Steve murmured, eyes not leaving Tony’s.
Sliding up beside Tony, Steve breathed in his scent, the feeling of comfort washing over his person.
Tony’s lakehouse.
How would that look?
“God, take this off, Steve.”
It may have been minutes, hours or days before Tony got his heart rate under control. His eyes gained back their focus as a heavy weight laid on his right shoulder.
It wasn’t fair.
He was just embarrassed now.
Moving Natasha back a little bit, he looked in front of him, and there stood…
The brunette drew back from him.
“I understand your personal views about sacrifice, Captain. But, has the thought that Tony knew you’d try to wear that gauntlet ever cross your mind?”
The rest of what he was saying completely faded away when Pepper heard the name Steve.
“I have some R&D stuff to finish. Big proposal really, I’ve already wasted a lot of time today, can’t lose my focus on that.”
Tony sneered, shrugging.
“Mm, let me taste that.” Tony whispered, their lips laying claim once more.
"You're not sure? Is that your final answer? I‌ didn't see a picture of Steve when I stepped into your workshop the other night?" She snapped, feeling tears start to form.
Psht, like hell.
Tony groaned, running his hands over Steve’s suit, trying to pluck at the fabric.
“No! I’m not going to let him die. He isn’t dying because he had to lay on the wire! Because he had to be a self sacrificing idiot!”
“Look. I’m not here for your damn permission to go, I wanted to know if the same event would happen if it were me instead of Tony. And you’ve made it abundantly clear that that is the case.”
Leaning back over the man, Tony propped himself up, lining himself up with the blonde male.
The boy's face was a mess of fear. It haunts. They had played and fought and come near to death, but not too near, and now it really happened.
Silence. Then- "I am in agreement," bellows Thor, "This battle is not yet over."
On the way up, he calls Pepper, because even though they had a nasty fight and she has a soulmate now and he will never be with her, she's still one of his best friends. She's stuck with him through the thick and thin, and he can love her platonically, too- he knows he can.
In the nightmares, he
But you were right, Tones. Thanos is coming. When he does, I wonder, would you call me?
I think that’s when I fell in love with you.
Then none of it really matters anymore, because Loki escapes and Chitauri invade Manhattan like an infestation of robotic aliens. Because that's literally what they are. Robotic aliens.
"You're not going to help?" Natasha asks. Not in disbelief or hatred, but a genuine question.
"Steve," whispers Tony in a cracked voice and he reaches out to pull him close.
"It's alright, buddy," Tony doesn't know why he lies. "You can still settle down without a soulmate, y'know. Lotta girls want to be with Captain America, if you catch my drift."
"I need you. You're CEO. You're the love of my life," he states simply. "You're not allowed."
Tony can sense a gentle hand sliding down his suit, over the arc reactor. Hopeless, limp, defeated. He hears the roar of a thousand men, and awakes to the sight of his beaten, bloody, beautiful team.
is also his
"You know what I mean. It would be
Secondly, Pepper is gone. JARVIS tells him she left yesterday night, after the mess of a fight they had. She wasn't supposed to leave until next week. It hurts. But he knows he deserves it, somewhere deep inside his egotistical conscience.
When Steve meets Tony Stark, he's nearly infatuated. Love at first sight. Well, almost, anyway- after he gets over the snarky remarks and irritating wisecracks. Iron Man's sleek armor and the way he soars, ever so gracefully, over New York City is something he can never get enough of, day after day as they fight alongside each other and argue affectionately.
It's long. Tony curls his fingers behind the nape of Steve's neck. "It'll work."
At least then I could feel you. At least I could touch you. Now we’re thousands of miles apart.
It's a whirlwind of fist to- metal?- before time lapses in a frighteningly tiring play-by-play. The team is exhausted, but there's so many more, and they can do it...
"As you wish, sir."
"Thanos sits in peace somewhere," she continues, "You cannot let him rest."
A flicker of disappointment passes over Steve's face, and it's so sudden he can't tell if it was even there in the first place or not. "Oh- I- okay. Just... just wondering. Sorry to bother you."
She breathes deeply, and then furrows her brow. "Tony, I'm breaking up with you."
What the fuck?
Tony smirks in reply, leaning down on the counter top even as he sits. "Don't hate you either."
But she doesn't pick up. The love of his life doesn't answer.
The truth is: he's lonely. There's Sam and Natasha (great friends) but they have busy lives of their own. There's Bucky, who's being mind-controlled by HYDRA and is off murdering innocents god knows where. He wants someone to hold at night, to greet him early in the morning, to
lives with.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter's hands don't falter until he falls.
"I'm sorry," he always wants to choke out, but he can't, his mouth always shuts on him, and the boy disappears.
"-zeroes, really-"
"Thanos won," he says, dryly, without much feeling, though he knows better. A finality in the statement.
With fumbling hands, Tony reaches for the little switch and pumps up the morphine dosage level, by one, two, three... "I'm going back to sleep."
God, you would be laughing at me for saying that if you were here.
“Steve? Oh- God, thank God, Steve- he’s coming- this place is already ravaged- and Tony and this wizard guy left, they left for space- and we need to prepare now! We need you-
"We were the only ones left." Nebula spits like it's all of their faults. Maybe it is. "The wizard gave up the Time Stone to Thanos to spare his life." She gestures to Tony in contempt. "But he is useless and weak. He does not have a solution."
"Alright, maybe just a hundred times." They laugh, it's easy.
"You have people to return to at your home. Some of them may be gone, but there will surely be people left." Nebula almost quickens in her pace. "But I have no one left. The only one who loved me lies dead. You cannot feel the loss like me, and so you will keep walking."
He bolts out in mere seconds, without a destination in mind. Maybe a bar.
He gets home to find the numbers he's been waiting for lined up, stacked along as if an organized taunt. Iron Man breaks down in the bathroom, clutching his arm to his chest and curling in on himself because
"That's not the way I see it."

"We will make a solution," Thor says determinedly.
"Wait, you're the one that carried me to bed yesterday-"
"I haven't seen you for two fucking years!" Tony screams into his face. "Don't fucking touch me!"
"Yes. Yes, no, wait. Tony, be quiet." She takes a deep breath. "I'm breaking up with you. I found... I found my soulmate."
Maybe he can drink all his sorrows away.
"Not-
It just reminds me how much has changed.
"Something big's coming, Pep," he tells her one day, fumbling around with some tech between his fingers, but ever since the conversation with Cap, it's been so hard to concentrate. Every time his mind wanders, it flashes back to the dejected look on Steve's face.
Sorry- sorry, I didn’t mean to curse.
Yeah, no shit. I should quit leaving messages on this burnout phone to a man I nearly killed two years ago, who doesn’t even open them. Maybe I should stop. Maybe that would be an okay idea.
huge huge apologies for breaking my rule. it's been a week. i was going to post this chapter much earlier but got caught up in other work, and the ao3 maintenance thing, and just ugh. won't happen again, promise :')
But I cooled down. It’s not good to stay angry for that long.
The Avengers are assembled at a vast conference table, smooth and black, situated in Stark Tower. Thick and heavy with tension, unspoken words seem to hang in the air like a crushing pressure that's weighing down onto everyone. Steve feels guilty, especially for the incident concerning Wanda last week, and if it's one thing he hates, it's disagreeing with Tony.
"You're not allowed."
it like it's so fucking real. Down to the exact shape of the kid's skinny limbs and his arms, holding on, deceivingly thin but underlying with superhuman strength. That kind of strength, not letting go. The way his face twists against Tony's neck, something beyond anguish.
Steve still holds Tony tightly.
Steve had lost Bucky again. Like a kind of perpetual cycle, like the Universe was laughing and cackling down at him in mirth. He had lost Bucky on that snowy mountaintop as he fell, and he lost him to the spell they'd put him under, and he lost him to ice, and he lost him to Thanos.
It’s been a while, Tony. And I still haven’t moved on.
Tony stumbles, sits on a rock, tries not to let any tears fall. The sun is constant and scorching on this baked planet. It's not even nighttime, it's daytime, and the light is harsh and neverending, reminding him of where exactly he failed and where the others fell.
Steve stays.
"I'm sorry for lying," Tony admits, expelling the apology from the deepest regions of his (seemingly) self-absorbed mind. "I didn't want... I didn't want your pity, I guess. And I didn't want to believe my soulmate was someone who didn't even like me."
Bucky is knocked away quickly, passed out, and it's just Tony and Steve in the desolate building.
I miss your lips. I miss the taste of you.
Steve recoils immediately, like he's touched a hot poker. Tony breathes, says, "I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm... I'm going insane, Steve. God."
But then he wakes up seventy years later to find that she's old and soulmarked, with grandchildren and children and a head of gray hair. Of course, he doesn't notice his own timer until a scientist studying his preserved DNA whistles suddenly to say, "Damn, seventy years and clock's still ticking."
But you’re not here. That… tends to put a damper on everything. Sometimes I wonder if I just don’t remember how happy I could actually get with you, so I fool myself into thinking I am.
parrying his hits and blasting back right now- it can't be.
Steve gets up. "He's playing with you, Tony. You need to get him out of your head. He's- I don't know what he's trying to do with you. What he's planning. But you can't let it get to you."
Tony knows that too; he's not an idiot. But his heart pulls him to stay here, in this place, where so many dissolved. "I don't know why he spared me," he says. "I have no fucking idea what to do from here."
"...The same ones twice?" Steve doesn't want to ask, can't bear to ask, but he
But he can't let this go.
“Tony?”
the end. this had like no plot whatsoever but I hope you enjoyed just for fun
"You know there is a solution." Nebula snaps back sharply. "The wizard spared your life for a reason. We must return."
Happy birthday, Tony.
I just… the magnitude of that sentence. A year is a long, long time- enough for someone to grow and change and maybe become a different person. Are you the same person, Tony? I know I’m not. I mean, I’m still just Steve, I think. But I think I’m different… I don’t know.

Remember, after our fight against the Chitauri? You were lying there motionless and I really, for sure, thought that you were dead and I could already feel my regret. Pulsing intermittently. But you awoke, and you said we should all get some shawarma.
"Enjoying the view?" Tony grins, clad in rosy-tinted sunglasses and a three-piece suit (probably Armani) as always.
"You don't know him," Pepper sighs, and he wants to kiss the splash of freckles along her nose. "Met him a week ago. I'm sorry, Tony, I really am. You know I love you, just not... like that."
"Call it, Cap," he shouts over the chaos, and then they're fighting. It's a satisfying break from all this dealing-with-emotions shit, and Tony soars through the air, feeling the content push of repulsor blasts exploding from his hands with every command. The suit is glorious, powerful,
"It'll work," he replies, nodding through the words, and then they're kissing.
A sigh. "I can't leave you here," Steve says, like he needs to uphold his morals or face death at the moment, and then he's carrying the other man in strong arms. It's awkward. Tony knows he reeks of alcohol, but hears no comment on it, and instead catches sight of the zeroes along Steve's arm. "Who's the special lady?"
The inevitable meet.
"We must return," says Nebula, more of a command, and her inky black pits are unyielding. Those eyes have seen the unimaginable. The brutal form of Thanos day after day, shame and pain and maybe a seed of impossible love for him. And a seed, a sapling, a furling tree of love for Gamora, who's corpse likely rests at the bottom of the cliff somewhere, freshly blue against stark snow and fingers unmoving.
So Tony is sucked through the portal, and all he can think about is Steve and what could've been. It's so cold in here, god, it's fucking freezing- the kind of cold he's never felt before, that vibrates through his bones and leaves him breathlessly agonized. In the distance, there's a colossal mothership, surrounded by gigantic aliens, a cold contrast against the beautifully stark background of space behind it.
pain.
"I'm sorry," Captain America tells him clearly, loudly. "I don't hate you. I'm just having some personal issues right now, and you're involved. but- indirectly, and it's definitely not your fault. God, I..."
The next day is very, very awkward.
–almost fucking unstoppable! He won’t-“
Do you ever think of me, Tony? I can't stop thinking about you.
This phone is the only thing left of you.
to be with you, like finding a piece of yourself-"
It's a powerful wildfire, but he always aims it the wrong way. "Put on the suit, let's go a couple rounds," and Tony can just feel them rubbing each other the wrong way like the friction of grinding metal in his workshop. But he can't quit the unnatural anger that takes ahold of him now, and something about Steve indicates he's frustrated too, but he can't tell why.

"Because I still love you," Tony says, and his voice is hollow, meaningless, like a quiet echo resounding off the walls of a vast room. He stands as if under a trance, making his way towards the door. Leaving Pepper there with all her lies. All her lies and zeroes and god, he just wants a drink, and when did his face get wet-
Numbness. That's what registers in Steve's head as he throws punch after punch, bruising knuckles, into the unyielding crimson-gold metal suit, and he knows that's what Tony- no,
