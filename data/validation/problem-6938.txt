"You call that training?" Peggy asked, looking Toni over again. Toni's hair, which was in a high ponytail, was a mess; sticks were sticking out everywhere. Her uniform looked disheveled. "Maybe, Steve can train me."
Rogers narrowed his eyes. "Maybe, it would be best if you stayed put." He clearly did not like the idea of her coming with them, but there was nothing he could do about it.
Somehow, the man looked angrier, ready to burst. "People are concerned about you, Toni. I'm concerned about you," he said, loudly. Hurt tones found their way into his voice, mixing into his anger. "And you find this is a joke."
Peggy looked between the three of them, just observing the three of them as they talked. It was clear that she was scrutinizing and analyzing every word that they were saying.
"Some stuff you leave there, other stuff you bring back. It's our job to figure out how to carry it. Is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little man-purse? It's up to you."
Her brain snapped again, when she realized what was going on and whose arms she was in. She couldn't let him be the one to comfort her, and also, she did not need anyone to comfort her. She was not a child. "Let go," she stated as she pushed him away.
The door to the apartment flew open, slamming against the wall. It snapped Toni out of her mind, bringing back to the present, though she was still a fog. Not a second later, a blond woman shot into the room with a gun trained and at the ready. With a purpose, she scanned every inch of room looking for any possible threat, much like you see in a cop show. Seeing no threats, the woman turned and gave Toni a dirty, nasty look. "Are you okay? I heard screaming?"
She narrowed her eyes at him. "What's with my face?" she asked. "I think my face is just fine! Thank you!" Her voice carried, making a few heads turn. Blood pooled in her cheeks as she felt eyes on her. Barnes laughed, making her turn away. She tried to calm down by distracting herself by the people on the streets. Just when she was about to turn back, she noticed someone on the corner.
"Really," she said, her hands dropping to his chest. She was amazed at how easily he could change her mood with that stupid grin of his. It was magic or something.
That was a loaded question if she had ever heard of one. Plus, there was the fact that she was seeing things. Barnes alone scared the crap out of her.
Seeing her device, which was locked away in a heavy duty case, she spoke, "Nope, you're still that bad." Her eyelids felt heavy and she could barely keep them open. If only she had enough energy to get to her device, because no matter what the risk was, she would use it to get home.
Tony knows he should be happy at the news, but he can't. It hurts too much. "It didn't feel like that a few months ago, when you and your buddy were beating the crap out of me. Was that because you care? If so, I don't want that. Don't need that." He knows he might be going too far by bring up the past, but he can't help it. It hurts. Just hurts to be this close to him.
Natasha's eyes flicked to Toni before they rested on Steve. "We'll get the missions detail on the jet."
He had already thought this about her, but man, he couldn't help but think she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. "Oh, did anything else come to mind during this realization?"
"No, not the plan," the first one objected. "But get him to leave." Toni felt the man shift, like he was waving at something. "He shouldn't be here."
"You just want to touch this, let's face it." She motioned to her body, which looked amazing even in the loose fitting military uniform. To cover the reactor's glow, she was wearing a long sleeve shirt under a loose fitting short sleeve one. Her cargo military pants were tucked in her boots and belted at her natural waist, which was annoying as it made her feel like a grandma. She had never worn pants that high. Dog tags, with her fake last name, hanged around her neck, worrying her slightly as it clanged whenever it bounced off the reactor. Thought it wasn't loud, it was noticeable, or… maybe it wasn't. She may have only noticed it because she knew there.
Howard took a deep breath. "You're hurt. Take the rest of the day off. Put your sexy legs up. A Lady does not need to work this hard."
And with Bucky, I know it feels too soon, but there is a reasoning behind it. And again, we all know he will be back. :) At least, she seems closer to her father, right?
"Don't go there," he snapped. Natasha, in the past, had accused Toni of planting ideas in his head as if Steve couldn't think for himself. He may admit that Toni may not have liked Fury and SHIELD, which was something she admitted to, but she never forced anything on him. "I don't think I have ever really trusted SHIELD, and trust me, I wanted to. It was the soldier in me that called to that life, and without it, I probably would've been lost. I can admit that, but that isn't the case anymore."
She felt like she was under arrest for murder with these questions, and she didn't like that, not at all. "Well, you can ask Steve, but we didn't do much sleeping," she replied with a wink, as she tried to chance the subject. "He has some stamina in him."
"Such a turn on," Loki smirked. "Please slap me." He took a few steps toward her. "I have a craving for you."
Toni narrowed her eyes at him. She could have said the same thing, but she didn't. She also didn't tell him that she handed the control of the company to her secretary. "I can do this on my own."
"What the hell are you doing?" Toni snapped as she kneed down to the Private, who was trying to push himself up. "Are you okay?" she asked as she tried to help him. Covered in blood and dirt, he looked like he had gone through the ringer. Though she couldn't stand the man, she didn't want him dead. That was reserved for a very special person.
, and no one was safe from his anger. He had lost count to how any people he had snapped at for merely walking by and the many pointed looks Natasha had given him. He knew he should calm down as they wouldn't find Toni if they didn't. However, that was harder said than done. His anger was getting the better of him, because he couldn't understand how SHIELD—Yes, SHIELD—couldn't find
Toni had a love hate relationship with Harley, and she wasn't quite sure if she hated him. Sure, she hated kids by their ages alone (though not as much as she did previously—damn it, Steve.), but she didn't exactly hate this boy…not saying that she liked him. He was annoying as hell. "Why can't I be called Iron Man?" she asked, with a deep sign.
Toni wasn't in the mood to deal with his flirting. "What is it, Barnes?" she asked, not having the energy to fight.
Toni stared back the monitor and narrowed her eyes. He had a smile that could light up a room, but that didn't mean she would let him in. However, she had to admire his attitude, even if she could barely stand him.
He had an accent, which Toni of course knew of, but it caught her off guard. It made her feel like she could trust him…What was it about accents that drew people in? "I don't have anything to tell."
in front of the window. She should be dead, but yet, here she was. There was only one reason why she wasn't hit, and that went back to the shooter. Besides being a super soldier with a metal arm, the man was an expert level sniper. He had to be a world class sniper… who wanted her. "Not surprising. Maybe, you should let me at it."
"Just stop it," she demanded as she dusted off her ass. Her journal was still safe in her belt, which gave her some relief. It held some of her secrets.
Steven took a deep breath as he recalled the events from the night that he found the woman. Just moments before he found her, he was laughed out of a recruitment office for the first time. Yes, laughed at, because no one could understand why anyone like him would want to enlist. He could hear the whispers from everyone, teasing that he could be killed by a look alone, and that hurt. It wasn't like he cared what others thought, but these insults hurt because he thought the same. "Can't think like that," he told himself. Like he was doing now, he had taken a long walk in the cold that night; however, he doubted he would come across a bleed woman again. God, he hoped not. He didn't need to be worrying about two unknown women.
"And lets just go with the pot-a-dots," she said. That one had a zipper in the back, while the other dress had buttons going all the way up the front. She could handle the zipper while buttons would give her trouble. Though she stumbled a few times, she managed to get out of her clothes.
Phillips looked at her. "I want to know why you were in that field and how these devices works." He placed two photos in front of her. One was of her unnamed device and the other was her reactor, which made her glance down at her chest. It wasn't visible through the black shirt she was wearing. "And I want to know who you are." He eyed her. "I don't believe Sark is your name."
"Oh, you want to bet?" she asked. "I b-" The genius didn't get to finish her sense as Steve grabbed her by her waist, picking her up and place his lips against hers. They didn't break apart until he heard the room groan.
When the Captain saw Banner picking up the Sector, Steve's mind almost instantly let go of his anger and frustration that he had. The instant he saw it was the instant his mind went into overdrive to protect the brunette next to him. Without really thinking about it, he stepped in front of Toni, blocking her view of Banner. He wasn't going to let anything happen to her, even if it pissed her off.
Shaking his head, Steve turned to a man who had stepped out of one of the vehicles and was walking toward him. He looked like a man who had seen a great deal of things and deserved respect, but Steve wasn't sure if he wanted to give that to him just yet. He looked like one of those men from the fake room.
Steve grabbed the box from Natasha, who didn't put up much of a fight to keep it. "We didn't have electric lights growing up. Too expensive," he said with a smile as he crossed to the tree. "Granted, we didn't have a tree like this. We usually went hunting for a tree in the trash, but they were never this nice." There was a smile on his face as he set the box down. "Well…. I hated looking for a tree in the trash like we were…" He drifted off, unable to finish that.
Steve had on the biggest, goofy smile on his face as he stepped toward Natasha and reached into the box. He pulled out a string of beads and lights. "Not junk. You should've seen the stuff that Bucky and I used to hang. That stuff was junk. Nothing matched, and each bulb was different," he said, softly. "Now, this is not junk."
There were some scantily dressed women in the park to Toni's surprise, granted she supposed why they were though she kept wondering why in this weather. She could
"Oh, yes we do, Stevie!" Toni whined. Her voice, though loud, sounded forced, and it was clear that she was struggling to stay awake.
"He was beating you up." She recognized the tension in his shoulders, which was the same tension she had always seen in him when he was talking to her in the future. Why was he so pissed at her? "Did you want me to let him? He could have killed you."
When Toni looked back, there in Howard's place stood a military doctor. "I don't need a doctor," she stated as she reluctantly allowed the doctor to take her arm. She bit down on her lip as he extended her arm.
I'm starting to believe you," he stated, interrupting her. "I want to keep an eye on you." He opened up the file in front of him and skimmed it over before sliding it toward Toni. "You rotting in a cell won't help anyone."
Tony glances at the two from the corner of his eyes, reading their stoic forms. James and Steve are two different people, and that's perfectly clear. Steve's emotions are written over all his face; he's worried and tired, but yet, there's relief on his face as he looks at Tony. Bucky, on the hold hand, is stiff and closed off, and he's angrier more than anything else. He looks like he's ready to pounce on someone, and that look alone can scare small children—though he can do that to pretty much anybody.
"I think he'll believe. Afterall, he's getting his prize, and he won't want to miss it." Pierce turned back to Rumlow. His eyes turned deadly. "So, get it done. I want those two dead, and I want Iron Man."
She closed her eyes, as she picked up her head and leaned back in the chair. There was the cold a draft in the room that assaulted her when she titled her head back. It sent shivers through her body, but she couldn't find the energy to move. However, the air was a shock to her system, keeping her awake. "Can you prescribe me some sleeping pills?" she asked, knowing full well that he couldn't.
Toni's eye twitched tired of being lectured, but she guessed that Sassy Pants was right. That man was going to hurt her. "You can let me go," she stated as she yanked her arm away. "I can walk myself."
"I wasn't going to do anything," she replied, quickly. However, she could tell he was not buying it at all with that look of his. "I'm not." She wasn't sure yet if that was a lie or not.
"How can you get sick of my face? And my face is not ugly. It's a face of a god," he joked, as he sat on the top of one of the lab tables. In his hands, he played with a metal, torture tool, which looked like some kind of scoop.
"Well, I'll show you," Fury said, taking control of the massive television wirelessly with a device in his pocket.
Toni glanced at Bruce for a second as he finished wrapping her ankle, before she returned her attention back to the TV. She normally didn't care for news, and even if it sounded cold, she didn't care who had died in this large city. Yes, she hated the idea of human lost and she would protect it, but she couldn't find it in herself to care now. It was his fault after all.
Both Steve and Toni's heads snapped to the door to see Bruce in the door room. "How long have you been there, Brucey?" Toni asked, eyeing the man. Though most of the time Bruce slept more often than Toni, it looked like she had won this round, as he looked like he hadn't slept at all.
"I don't like people watching me." Toni stared at the monitor, trying to figure out what was going through his mind. "What do you want anyways?" His tone changed slightly with the departure of Pepper.
As this conversion went on, she was still angry – she wasn't the property of her father! – but she wasn't as angry as before. This conversion had turned into a fun game and Toni did find herself enjoying it, but she had enough. She just wanted to get her device and go home. "Can we all stop talking about my sex life, geez?" It made her wished that she had one, as she couldn't remember the last time she had sex, which was pretty bad. She did not go through dry spells like this. "Besides none of those guys are kinky enough for me."
Taking another slip of her now room temperature coffee, Toni took a step toward the floor to ceiling window. Her eyes looked pass the large shadow in the corner, focusing on the scenery she knew was out there. Though it was completely dark, she was able to make out the outlines of the ocean and the beach, and even if she didn't get many chances to look out into the sunset, she enjoyed the view. She enjoyed the lines in natural, fascinated by the design of it all…. Even if she wasn't a huge natural fan.
Steve kept close to Toni, and no, it wasn't because he was scared that Toni was going to collapse. He was just worried, worried what she would do if he left her alone. Even if she didn't tell him, she
Howard reached for her left arm and hovered it there for a few seconds before he clasped her arm in a sign of support. "Your guilt. It's eating you alive."
She turned from the mirror looking around the room for something that she could use. On the window, she noted a rubber band, which she knew would rip out her hair, but she had no choice. Though she wanted to put it in a bun, she settled for a low pony tail, which wasn't all that neat. However, she was happy with her work and headed to the restroom. She noticed Barnes eyeing her, but he didn't say anything to her.
He said something back to her but they were just words, as she faded back into darkness. However, she could rest in peace as she was safe and Barnes was alive, though she would give him hell the second she came to.
Clint walked into the room. "It's who she." He eyed Natasha, as she walked to the chair beside the couch and sat down. She had a drink in her hand. "She isn't use to having so many people, who would care if she died, looking out for her." He crossed to the bar to get himself a drink.
Fury may not like her on her worse day or any day, even when she tried, but he would never do this…However, Fury was dead. She had watched as he was brought in covered in blood. She had watched him take his last breath as the doctors did everything that they could to save him. She had watched as Hill and Romanoff's world shattered in front of them. Fury, though Toni could not stand the man half the time, was more than just a master spy to them or anyone. He was a dark hero, who was willing do whatever it took. Though his ways may be unethically, someone had to do it and he was willing.
His eye twitched at the nickname. "Dr. Erskine is dead," he stated as he stepped to the bars of her cell. A key dangled in his hand.
"Hey, Pep," Toni greeted as cheery as ever. Was this the end of them? "How can I help you? Make it quick. You're interrupt my special time with Rogers."
"—ark, are you there?" She asks, focusing on the flicker in his eyes. "Are you okay, Mr. Stark?" the Doctor asks, as she moves the light left to right in front of his face. "Are you with me?"
Impulsively, Toni glanced toward Phillips who was staring at her intently. When they had first met, Phillips had teased her about not having matters, and Toni had let it slip that her mother had died. Now, Toni knew what that look meant: an order not to say anything. He had nothing to worry about. She wasn't going to say anything like she did with Barnes and Rogers. She was going to remain silence like the heartless person that she was.
Being at war, they didn't have the fortune of four star meals, and at the apartment, they couldn't really afford anything like that. The plate in front of her had a nice sized steak, mashed potatoes, and some green beans, and she couldn't take her eyes off the steak, almost reaching to the fork just to taste it. "Is this a joke?" she asked.
Steve glanced up at Clint, narrowing his eyes at the man. He hated this, just sitting around and doing nothing, but his skills were on the ground, not computers. "Where are Rumlow and the Strike team?" he asked. He hadn't seen them in some time with the last time with them looking stressed about something. Maybe, they found something?
He eyed the man for a second before he wiped the bloody knife on the pant leg of the dead man. This man's blood was everywhere, almost covering every inch that it could, but there were a few bare spots on his dismembered legs unlike the rest of the body. The upper half of his body was covered in blood as it laid in a puddle of its body fluid. The asset's own uniform was covered in blood, but he didn't give it much thought. Being covered in blood was normal for him; killing was normal to him. Seeing this body in this form was normal for him, though this time was different.
On any normal day, he wouldn't be worried. She was Iron Man, fighting/beating anyone who looked at her funny, and she had the scars to prove it. She was feisty as feisty could be, and that mind of hers could spin her out of anything. However, she wasn't working at 100%. She was working on very little sleep, haunted by her guilty. Right now, she was drowning in it, seeing ghosts. In that state, she was no good to anyone, especially herself. It was one of the reasons why he was upset that she went after that Metal armed Assassin alone, and his fear only grew seeing her out of the suit with said man hovering over her. She was a strong woman, but there was only so much she could take.
Steve flashed in her mind for a brief second, but that was all she needed. It kicked her back into the driver seat, back into action. With someone to fight for, she knew she had to get out of here or else. She needed to get away, but nothing was working: her body, her suit.
Toni struggled with the chains again as he eyed her. "I can't sleep all day long, now can I? I don't need that much beauty sleep," She replied, not taking his eyes off him. Judging by his movement, he was up to something, though he was always up to something.
"Sleep headache," she muttered to herself. "I must've slept too long." She laughed as she thought about her sleeping patterns. Usually, she never slept this much, only having about 4 hours of sleep a night if that. She had been yelled at so many times about it by every single Avenger and…Pepper. Toni would rather face each Avenger and even Loki than face an angry Pepper.
"Tones," he started again. "I do trust you on a good, but look at you." His tone was soft but hard, clear that he was concerned. "In the military, we remove soldiers from the field when they're in emotional state or failed a psych test. Right now, your mind is your worst enemy, and you aren't in the right mind set. I doubt you could pass a psych test right now." He paused to take a breath. "I'm your best friend; I'll do anything for you, but you're scaring me right now. It feels like you're waiting for death. Waiting for something to happen like you deserve it."
Toni's hands tightened around her, her hands digging into her shirt. "So do you even want to be here?" she asked, her voice breaking. "Or just forced? You have other things to do? You know Captain America and all."
"Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in." Sam said, smiling as he stared down at file. He had slimmed the files down on the table seconds ago with a grin on his face.
Her eye twitched, not liking the idea that someone was watching her. "Well then your men suck," she replied. "Didn't stop me from breaking into your company."
"Old married couple?" She questioned as she narrowed her eyes at him. "A married couple? That's what you come up with?" Why did she find that so insulting? "We aren't anything close to marry."
Fury looked at her, trying to read what she was thinking. "It'll allow us to get some idea of where she is and how we can get her back. We might need her brain for that."
After attempting to remove the paint from her face (failing horribly), she waved good bye before taking off in the Iron Man suit, which cued more flashes. There was no doubt this college visit would hit the media in a matter of seconds.
Toni chuckled with a wink. "Can't blame a girl for trying." However, she still had no idea of what he wanted from her, or maybe, that was the point. Maybe, he just wanted to make her crazy… but would the point be in that? Did he get some kind of joy seeing her sweat? "But you can still let me go."
"Thanks," Steve muttered as they both left the apartment, which was near the top of the old building. "I don't know where she would go. It might be worthless to go look for her and that worries me." New York was a big city and there were so many places that Toni could've gone. At this time of the night, there was no where she could go to get out of the cold. What was he going to do if he couldn't find her? Could he just leave her out in the cold, where she could die?
Toni's nerves kept growing as she wanted to get this over with. She glanced toward Phillips for some kind of support, but his glances were only warning. "Peggy is so not my mother. Too classy for you." Her heartbeat was racing, putting yet another stain on her tired body.
He looked at her as he unchained her from the chair, but her hands were still tightly chained together. "I would like to show you something," he stated as he grabbed her by her forearm.
Steve glanced toward the Christmas tree then toward Toni. There was a frown on his face as he looked at her. "How long are we gone for?" he asked with a blank look.
Steve closed the distance between them. Paying no attention to her question, he stated, "Not changing my mind, Stark. I'm not going anywhere, and there's nothing you can say that will change my mind."
Always getting up at 4am, Peggy, who was never late for anything, would fold her blanket and set it at the end of the cot and leave soon after. Toni's glance dropped to Peggy's items, which were neatly packed and stored under the cot. Though Toni had tried to be neat, her side of the tent could not compete with Peggy's. It looked like her clothes, which was impressive as she had only a small amount, exploded on her side. Peggy, like always, did not approve.
Toni looked down and stared at her hands. "This isn't something I can just test and see if it works. I have to turn it on and see where it takes me." It was a big risk and it could kill her if it was anything like the last time, but she couldn't stay any longer.
Someone snap inside of her, she tilted up and scowled into his deep blue eyes. "Do you?" he asked, her voice getting an edge. "How would the
As soon as Toni walked onto the bridge with Agent Coulson, Steve's eyes were on her. He may not have no idea of what she were saying most of the time, but there was something about the way she spoke that drew him in. She had a self-confidence about her.
He didn't care that he got the last name treatment from her-okay, maybe a little-, but he was glad that she was here. "It's you. It's really you," he said softly, grabbing onto her extended hand. "How's this possible?"
in the basement of his mother's house while thinking of her. He also seemed to be like the type to have a shrine too… maybe, two shrines. Seriously, look at him! Who was this creepy man and how had no one murdered him yet? How had he not murdered anyone yet? He totally seemed like the type to have people laced up in his basement naked and bleeding…Maybe, his mother protected him or she was helping him; he did seem like the momma boy type. Maybe, she probably protected the world from this crazy man.
Through her hands, she glanced at the clock and groaned at the blinking time: 3:27AM. "Fuck," she cursed as she pushed herself up. Her body protested as she stood. Only working on half an hour of sleep, it felt like she was going to fall over at any second. One would think that kind of sleep would be good as she would be too tired to dream, but that wasn't the case for Toni. No matter how tired the brunette was, she always dreamed.
"Two of the Howling Commandos. Gabriel Jones and Timothy Dugan," Steve stated. His tone was odd to say the least "They served with me during World War II, and this is Trip, Gabe's grandson."
Toni got down on her knees and opened the pack on her back. "If Stark's correct, it shouldn't take me too long," she replied as she pulled out some tools. With a screwdriver in her hand, she crawled under the control board and removed one of the hard panel coverings. She needed to get to the wires if she wanted to hack into the system. Unlike future technology, there was no USB ports that she could plug into. A minute later, she was able to find the two wires that she needed. After to exposing the wires, she took out the same device from before and popped open the top. She took out two wires and split them so she could connect the wires to the control panel. After assuring the connection, she watched the device lit up, but it beeped a few times as the device struggled to make it through the fire walls.
"You think Fury's hiding something?" Steve asked, meeting her glare. He would see her sizing him up, almost expecting him to fold under her glare, but he knew how to handle it.
"Let's talk about something cheery now," Barnes said as he offered his arm to Toni, who just stared at it. She wasn't one to take an offered arm, no matter how hot the guy was. "I was thinking we could go to the Stark Expo. I hear Howard Stark is unveiling something." He smiled and lowered his arm when Toni didn't take it.
Toni had no idea this kid could talk so much, though she shouldn't be so surprised. This kid hadn't shut up since she met him, and she was ready to hit someone. If Harley wasn't so young, she would punch him. Sure, she was being too harsh, but she couldn't take the talking. There was enough of it going on in her head already. "No idea. I'm not-I don't care."
Steve's jaw locked, trying to put on his Captain's voice. It wouldn't be good if Clint was calling and sounding like that. "I'm here. Did you find her?" he asked, though he knew the answer already.
Her eye twitched at the word miss. She wasn't sure why she was peeved at being called a miss, but it angered her. "I'm fine," she stated as she wiped herself off. She looked up at the large man with a huge mustache. He was a good few feet taller than she.
"So? Are you the only one who can?" he asked annoyed. Bucky, who wasn't sly at all, was a ladies' man and could get any woman that he wanted, which had annoyed Steve. There were times, though he tried to be sneaky about it, that Steve had seen women leave his room, which was awkward to say the least.
It was only ten minutes later that Fury returned with another folder, a newer folder than the ones that Fury had given him before. "Here's Toni Stark's folder. I don't know what you're looking for, but you won't find it with her. She won't be that anchor to the past for you."
Bruce's eyes widen as a realization came upon him, but before he could voice it, Natasha spoke, "If Pepper didn't do it, then who did it?"
She was pissed. How dare he talk to her like that? Who in the hell did he think he was? He didn't treat Agent Romanoff like this, so why was he treating her like his? She could take care of herself; she had been taking care of herself for years. She didn't need anyone and she really didn't need him. She didn't even know why she was even on this team. Director Fury didn't want her on the team to begin with. He thought she was egoist and riskless, which was true, but she was dying at the time. It still bugged her that he used that to judge her.
Clint laughed. "I would love to give Rogers the shovel talk," he said with an evil laugh. "However, you'll have to worry about Nat giving you the shovel talk, and for some reason, I think her talk will be scarier than the Hulk's."
"Geez, Stark, not going to share with Rogers?" Natasha asked, eyeing Toni. Steve could see the worry in the assassin's eyes as she studied the genius next to him. He knew Natasha cared about Toni, even if she would never admit it.
"I…I don't understand," Rogers replied slowly. Nothing was making sense to him. Why would Howard name his child after Toni? Did she leave a lasting imagine with him? However, why couldn't Fury find a Toni Sark in his record?
Barnes stands still, eyeing him. "And here I thought we were something more. I guess not," he says as he turns away. "Don't worry. I won't make another meal for you."
She thought to herself. "We've better hurry," Toni stated, pulling the pack to her back. Her journal was buried at the bottom of her bag, hiding it from the world, as she didn't wanted anyone to read or even know about it. It was the only thing she shared her secrets with, but she wondered if that was smart as there was a chance that someone would find it.
There's no doubt to that, and Tony has chills thinking about it. He hates to see the damage those two can cause together. However, he can't be upstairs, not with Barnes and Rogers. "…I can't," he says slowly.
Getting down on her knees, Toni kneeled down in front of her father's headstone. Her fingers traced the deep engraving of her father's name as she fought back the tears that were forming in her eyes. It wasn't fair. Sure growing up, she hated the man, who never seemed to care about her, but after getting to know him, she realized it wasn't the case. She didn't know what was going on in his head, but she knew he cared.
Needing a life line, Toni just listened to the woman's voice, just focused on her. She forced herself to count backward, which finally worked. After a few long seconds of warmth, everything started to come down. The world slowed to its normal pace, and things stilled. Feeling more like herself (though her heart was still racing), Toni pushed herself back and looked up. The first thing she saw was the blond hair, followed by the woman's strong eyes. "S-Sharon," she uttered, both confused and surprised. Sharon was the last person she expected to see. The last person she thought would comfort her, but here she was.
Mixed in Toni's fear was anger because she was tired of her face being grabbed. She glared to hide both her fear and to show her annoyance. She tried to pull her head back but his grip was too strong, and she was forced to look in his eyes.
That pissed her the hell off, because she was just as good as any man. "Asshole," she yelled as she kneed him in the groin.
"She wasn't needed," Barton said, coming to her defense. "The three of us handled it with no problem."
Philips looked up at Toni. "You heard right. Men, can you leave us for a few minutes?" he asked as he turned to his desk. "And close the flaps when you leave."
Blinking a few more times, Toni, annoyed at herself and live in general, willed her senses back to normal. She would not allow herself to be weak in front of him. God, what was that device? Whatever it was, it didn't matter as it would never work on her again even if it was the last thing she did. "What do you want?" she demanded, looking up at the long hair man. There was someone about him that struck her, but she could not place it.
"Captain Rogers, the likelihood that you would guess the code is 1.2342%," JARVIS stated. "It is futile."
The expressed on Jim's face morphed. "Where the fuck is Rogers? Did he do something? Do I have to beat his ass?"
She glanced back at her device for a second before she continued to the entrance. "Don't make me kill you and steal your company," she hissed as she pushed open the flap. She took a step out and looked around the darkened camp for any sign of movement. She didn't see anything, but even in the dark, she could make something out on the ground and as she stepped closer to see what it was, her breath was stolen from her.
Clint pouted as Natasha stepped away from him with the bulb in her hand. "Let's get this tree decorated," she said.
With two plates in hand, Sharon returned to the oven. "I doubt he doesn't know," she said, honestly, as she removed the pan from the heat. "He probably knows what I'm cooking right now, though isn't that an uncomfortable thought." She glanced at Toni, studying her with her eyes. There was something there, just behind her eyes. It wasn't quite readable to the genius, but it was there. "However, my job is Rogers. To watch and protect him if needed. Nothing else. What you do is not a part of my assignment. Fury won't hear about this from me."
Who could she call? Who would care enough to pick up? Maybe, Barnes was right? She was worthless, and the world be better off without her. Feeling completely alone, the phone slipped from her hand, and she dropped to her knees hard. She wanted it all to stop. She just wanted Bucky to stop. "I can see it," she uttered, her voice cracking.
"Next time." After giving her the biggest smile that he could, he turned Sam. "Need a medic?" he teased, see his heavily breathing.
"If there was a home for me to go to, I wouldn't be asking for a homeless shelter," she replied. She held the bag, with her belongs, tight in discomfort. And there was pity in his eyes, which was something she really didn't want. It almost made her want to punch him.
"Why are you pushing? Didn't you hear me when I told you I was playing you? It was all just a game to get what I want," she said, her voice shaking. She knew she wasn't fooling anyone with her shaky tones.
Clint turned to him and explained the conversion that Natasha and he had with Fury. "I told Natasha this, but I will tell you this: 'If anyone happens to Toni because of him, I will never return to SHIELD.' They can consider me their enemy. I'm dead serious."
"If you think about it, they didn't need all three of us," Romanoff stated. "Two of us would've been fine."
Toni cracked a small smile as she glowered at the ground. "I knew it was stupid." She was beginning to worried, because she would have nowhere to go if Barnes didn't let her stay with him and Rogers. "What gave it away?"
"What would a fifty dinner look like?" he asked her. His eye brow was raised as he stared at her. "I think there would be aliens or something, right?" He laughed.
After a few short breaths, Toni kicked her feet over the cot, as she had to find a way to distract herself. When nightmares plagued her, there was only one place, or rather one thing, that could relax her and that was the lab. Creating and learning new things was one of few things that could distract her from the pain that she was feeling. It kept her sane, though Pepper and Rhodey wouldn't agree. She had gone days with little to no sleep, making herself sick, but it hadn't and wouldn't stop her from doing it.
Toni put on a smile as she looked ahead. She could see her tower ahead of them, and it gave her hope. She would soon be in her lab again, where she could hide from the world, and once she had her Iron Man suit, she would fly back to the camp to look for herself. It wasn't like she didn't believe them about her device being destroyed; she just had to go back and check. She had to see it for herself. She needed to work out that false memory of those S.T.R.I.K.E. men from her head. "That my friend is the definition of being a Stark. I would've thought all of that time with my father would've taught you that."
Steve walked pass Natasha, who looked unaffected by what she was hearing or seeing. "What's going…" He started but drifted off seeing one of Toni's Iron Man Armors. He couldn't tell for the life of him what Mark it was, but he knew it was one of the recent ones that she had created… or so he thought. "Why is that out?" he asked, his eyes narrowing. He glanced toward Rhodes who were sitting on a bar stool with a glass of something in his hand.
And did you all hear in the new Comic of Iron Man, Tony Stark was adopted. I am not sure how I feel about that. It kind of changed the whole story of Iron Man, doesn't it?
Her heart was about to pop out of chest, her mind going into a downward tailspin. She tried to remember how she got here, this room with no windows, but all she saw was Bucky. Bucky in his bloody uniform. "This isn't real. You're both dead." Her voice was shaky, and she felt like she was drowning in everything that she had ever hoped for. "I'm dreaming. This isn't real."
Toni's head snapped up, and before she could process what she was about to do, she picked up a bulb and flung it at the archer as hard as she could. Yes, it was childish, but she wasn't in the mood for his comments.
Toni would let him be happy today, because he would probably not see her again. Either she succeeded and got back to her time or failed and ended in jail. Though she felt bad at the thought of leaving him, she had to do it. She had to get her device back, and now that her cast was off, there was no stopping her from breaking into Stark industries.
Her only hope was that Barnes and Rogers would find it. Just as the Commander marched toward the door, the Swiss army Knife dropped from the bag. Her eyes widened as she saw it dropped. She couldn't let it hit the floor or she would be screwed. She reached for it, panicking, as she felt it slip from her fingers. Just as she thought she lost it, she was able to get a hold of it. She pulled out a random tool and stabbed the woman in the face.
"It's not that," Barnes stated as he turned back to her for a second. "It's your I-don't-care-about-others attitude. You can't treat people like that and expect people to like you." He disappeared into his bedroom. She was going to open her mouth to protest, but she decided against it.
Barton stepped away from the suit, but he kept a few feet from Steve. Barton, though he would never admit to it, always kept a safe distance from Rogers as if he expected the Super Soldier to snap at any second. "People are starting to notice Toni's disappearance."
"Stark," the man called again, but this time she felt something on her shoulder. She flinched under the touch, which was painful, but the man only seemed to squeeze harder. "She…to…a-waking…"
Steve let out a playful sigh. "Only if you listen." He replied. "You know we should listen to people, when they tell us things."
"…Better not…dead….Punk," one says, panic clearly in his voice even if he tries to mask it with anger. "I'll….back…life just…kill..."
However, Steve's relief was shot lived as Thor raised his hammer again. With sheer determination, he angled him and aimed himself for a spot between Toni and Thor. He was going to do whatever he needed to do to protect Toni. "That's enough!" he yelled as he landed hard. He straightened himself up with his shield pointing toward the fake god.
Barnes took a step toward her. "I told him that if he ever touched you again, I would beat the shit out of him. He touched you, so I touched him." He didn't look sorry at all.
Steve gave him a look before stepping toward the door. "I don't know who you are kidding. She was exactly herself."
Jones gave Dugan a shake of the head, silencing his friend. Dugan looked like he wanted to protest as he leaned heavily on his cane, but he remained quiet as the two elderly Commandos stared at each other. With a deep breath, Jones replied, "That we shall. Will you be fine while we visit an old friend? Trip can help you-"
Toni's eyebrow rose as she stared at her father. The second she wondered how the hell he had her when he was goof ball was the second it went out the window. She knew he had woman lined up to be with him, which made her wonder if her mother one of them. She hoped not.
"You're impossible, Stark," Romanoff said, with a sigh, as she turned back to the reporter, who had taken that moment to dash away. Either of them could've stopped the man, but no one chased after him, knowing it was best to let him go. "You know that photo of Rogers and you kissing is going to be on the six o'clock news."
As she laid there in agony, Toni felt stupid. She, one of the smartest people on the planet, felt like the stupidest person on the planet. It was laughable, which was just what Toni did. For a good few seconds, she laughed as it poured on her. She was really an idiot, wasn't she? She twisted her ankle, chasing after a ghost. A freaking ghost. She was going crazy, driving herself crazy, as she kept seeing things that weren't really there. What was wrong with her? Did she—
"Maybe, so, but better safe than sorry." Sharon replied, giving her a soft smile. "To be honest, I supposed it has to do more with him being a man out of time than his ability to protect himself. Fury just wanted someone here."
Toni glanced between the two and that pukey feeling from earlier returned. Why were they staring at each other like they were going to eat each other? Why in the hell was Peggy wearing that dress? Was she just trying to show off? If she was, it was sure working, because Rogers was looking at her with such an intensely that it annoyed Toni.
The Asset couldn't recall how many years later it was before his handler finally found the picture, but he remembered the pain. The punishment was severe. He could assume it was due to the fight that he put up when the handler took the photo. He may have killed a few of his handler's guards, but he couldn't recall. He was focused on
Her face soften a bit as she looked at him. Was this why Steve seemed out of it? Or was it something else happening? And why happened to Toni make cause her to need 'space'?
"Yea, and I bet her idea of a good date would be torturing you, though I would be up for that," he said.
"I'm right here," Steve said, waving his hand. "And what do you mean when you stated he didn't make contact."
Toni couldn't take it anymore. Why couldn't Peggy understand that she didn't want to talk? She wanted to be left alone. "I want to go home, okay? I don't want to be here anymore." She was sick of this time, and even if she would have to deal with all of the lectures from the Avengers, she wanted to be with them.
"No, what I need is to get out of here," Toni replied, trying to sit up. "I need to work on my device."
Peggy turned back to her. "We have deemed the two items safe. We cannot do that with the other device."
With a deep breath, Steve turned to Natasha, Clint and Rumlow, giving them a look. He wondered for a second if they could see how broken he was. He could imagine how he looked at the moment, losing count to how many times he had jumped into ocean. There was no doubt he looked like a wet rat, as his clothes were ripped to pieces. He was also bloody, a result from his jumping into the ocean and the physical assault, but he wasn't worried. He healed fast. "Don't."
"Dugan," Steve called standing a few feet from Dum Dum, who was joking around with another resident. They were in the common room of the Nursing home, which was filled with visiting family, other residents, and nurses. Dugan and his friend were eyeing one of a female nurses, who was currently assisting another resident.
Steve's nickname for Barnes snapped him out of his fog; he had completely about Toni. How could he forgot about her? It should've been impossible with that loud snarky mouth of hers. "Toni," he stated. He wasn't sure how Steve would react to this, but he had to know. "She's here. Schmidt has her."
"It's ahead by an hour," Pepper stated as she changed direction. She picked up the clock and changed it back to the correct time.
"You think I'm not?" Toni asked back, a bit snappy. "Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables." Her hand dropped from Bruce's shoulder to the lab table. Her fingers traced the edges of a meter.
She tried to work out what she was feeling. She had known that the Shrimp had a thing for Peggy, though she was unsure of what that thing really was, but hearing it from Salty annoyed her. She wasn't sure why, but she didn't want to think too much on it. It shouldn't matter what they were anyway.
And on a different Note: I am not sure I can take Captain America: Civil War. Have you see that trailer? It killed me. Angst! The Angst! If I make it that far in this story, I am not sure my chapters can make it.
Without Toni realizing it, Steve had laid her the sofa and pinned her with his body. With one knee between her legs, he pressed his body against hers, though he was careful not to put his full weight on her. With a gentleness that no one would ever thought the Great Captain America was capable of, he ran his hands under her shirt, caressing the skin up and down her back. He smiled against her lips as his hands worked their way up her back. She could feel her body tremor, as his lips left her and traveled to her neck ever so slowly.
"Yes, we will, and you'll take care of us," Bucky says, breathing into his ear. "I want to feel your mouth on my cock."
As she slipped her feet into her boots, her eyes glanced to the empty side of the room. After the first time that Toni had woken Peggy with her nightmares, she asked for a separate room. She said it was so she didn't disturb the Agent, but the real reason why because she didn't want Peggy to see her like this. She didn't want anyone to see her like this.
She asked herself as she had proved herself right, though she wasn't sure why she was doing this. Was it to show Peggy or herself? Then there was another question, did Barnes really care or did he just see her as something to conquer? "I can distract everyone with my wilds," she stated as she mockingly flipped her hair and pushed out of his arms.
Clint let out a loud sigh as he needed a knife to cut the tension in the room. "Then get her to bed. Nat and I have a date with a pirate," he said, breaking the silence, as his eyes shifted between the two. Natasha didn't say another word as she turned and left. There was a stiffness in her shoulder as she walked up the steps, and that didn't sit well with anyone. "…She's just worried about our genius," the Archer added. "As are the rest of us."
"If that was the case, I would be gone by now. You're too much work for a piece of meat," she said with a smile.
However, would there a point? She was stuck in this cell, and there was no way she could get out unless someone let her out. Was it worth it to try to escape? The colonel had already proven that she was predictable and he knew what she would do. If she did get pass Salty, how would she get back to the future? She had no idea of how her device even sent her to the past.
Mr. Spector took a step to her before he opened his suitcase. "Not everything. There was a session of the will that was omitted before you read it." He opened the suitcase just enough to put out a fat, large, yellow envelope. "In it, it gave strict instructions not to give this package to you until this very day. Until you were here at his grave."
Taking a deep breath, Steve closed the magazine and set it on the table. He knew since Toni had become Iron Man, she had quiet down and kept a low profile. She had only done a few articles since then, but this was the first time that she had posed for one wearing a bathing suit since getting the reactor. She reminded each of them of this as she shoved the magazine in the Avengers' face.
Steve laughs. "I was jealous at first, seeing how close Bucky got to you at first. I want to be in your lab with you."
“Yeah,” Clint confirmed, his tone light and obviously very happy to be back. It was written all over his face.
He could basically hear Rhodey roll his eyes and grinned at him extra-brightly when he sat down on the other couch. He bounced Ian on his knees, laughing with him as he giggled even more.
Everything in Tony itched to take scans of his bionic arm, itched to prod and improve, but he knew a thing or two about objects being stuffed onto one’s body without consent. The arm seemed to be functional for now, and everything else would have to wait until Barnes was awake.
From his position on one of the small beds, Fury sat up. He watched everyone file in, took one look at Tony and rolled his eyes. “Of course it’s you,” he said and made to stand up on somewhat shaky legs.
. To lick his wounds in peace, and not have anyone pity him for having fallen for the one person who would likely rather stop dating altogether before they would give
His blue eyes were so close, Tony could have counted his lashes. It took him a moment to remember that there was something he’d meant to tell Steve as the two of them had a moment of quiet.
Those weeks must’ve been a horror for him, too. At first, there had been days upon days of trying to deactivate the mental implants in Bucky’s brain, and once that was done, Tony had jetted around the US, promoting their case and trying to keep Bucky from going to prison.
The room served as some kind of boathouse, it seemed. There were a few rafts and paddles hanging on the walls. Everything was coated with thick dust as well, and as soon as Steve had reached Dummy, holding his claw to keep him from moving away any further, a dreadful sensation took hold of his heart.
A week in, Tony had a little meltdown, yelling at the room and trashing a bit of furniture. They both had realized early on that leaving the room wasn’t much of an option. They’d simply find themselves walking through a door, only to reappear on the other side of the room. Outside the windows, it was always the same scenery: New York by night, though Steve had noted that his dream-memory of the skyline wasn’t quite as accurate. A few buildings didn’t look right, but then again, it supposedly didn’t matter.
Steve almost choked and could barely contain it. He felt his cheeks heat and glanced sideways, but no reaction came from Nat and Clint. At least Tony had the decency to use a private channel. That wasn’t always the case.
Tony arched a brow and leaned back. The cold wall against his shoulder was suddenly comforting in a bizarre way. This was getting a bit out of hand, wasn’t it? But Steve was
One of his own hands ran up Tony's back, safely over his shirt, and cupped the back of his neck when it reached high enough. "That's… unexpected." Steve was careful not to give any negative feedback here. It was, after all, good to have a few healthy kinks.
“Could you save it for when I’m not around?” Bucky asked next to them. “I don’t, I… It’s giving me a headache.”
Coloring butterflies, as it turned out, was a nice change of pace. Ever since he’d set foot in Clint’s home, greeting Laura and the kids, the tension between Tony and him had only grown. Ignoring him during a smaller fight was tiresome enough, but ignoring Tony’s troubled gaze
Tony gasped at the first contact, thrusting back slightly and groaning when that didn't get him what he wanted. Steve's voice was low and sensual, leaving him lightheaded and panting.
The armor looked horrible, the paint almost gone, leaving it with the vibranium’s silver color. There were dents and ashes and while there was no blood on Tony’s face, he looked shaken.
—it felt like Tony had at some point crawled inside his skin and made himself at home. Steve knew deep inside that his life would never be the same.
Twists and coils of wires hung from the low ceiling of the dark room, their ends feeding into strange machinery he didn’t recognize. Here and there he spied a familiar piece of technology. And there, built into the wall, was a mosaic of screens. Though they were blank, every movement the people around him made sent a slice of light across their dark surfaces, as though the room was watching them.
“So,” Tony prompted, unable to hold back a small smile. “If for some reason, I happened to kiss you again, you wouldn’t object, is that it? Maybe you would even… encourage such scandalous behavior.”
It was all… pretty great, in Tony’s opinion. They were surprisingly good together, now that the drama had subsided a little and Steve wasn’t freaking out about the age thing, anymore. He'd even come to sort-of-like Barnes and his scary girlfriend-but-not-girlfriend. They were teasing both Steve and Tony about their relationship pretty much full-time, but with every joke, it seemed Steve eased up little more, and it didn’t take much for Tony to figure out that Barnes was doing that on purpose.
Steve and Bucky were out helping the movers with their bed—a situation full of nonstop funny as far as Tony was concerned—while he and Rhodey tended to the more tedious aspects of moving day. Tony acknowledged that it was likely a bit cruel to have Bucky move something that he didn’t want to even consider in relation to him and Steve, but similarly, he enjoyed the hell out of it.
Steve swallowed. He knew Tony had a point, and he wouldn’t argue with him on this. He looked at Bucky for a long moment, before he stood up. Then, he reached out a hand and pulled him up. “You alright?” Steve asked.
“You can go faster,” Tony all but pleaded, moving his hips down to take Steve all the way inside, trying to regain some form of ground. “You can just… just take what you need. Whatever you want.”
“Let me go!” he grunted, pushing back so hard that he and Steve both tumbled off the bed and against the wall behind them.
point to all of this and I can’t fucking believe you’re sacrificing our once-in-a-lifetime-trip for a chance to pop your cherry!”
Steve would never forget him, though. That much he knew. He would go on, sure, but he would carry these days with him forever.
A few days ago, Tony had even ordered him a new tuxedo. And as Steve soon learned, a seamstress with two assistants and unlimited use of the Stark funds could achieve amazing things in just a few hours.
Ms. Potts didn't seem too worried about it when she glanced at the large man and approached him the next moment.
, Steve’s mind supplied unhelpfully. Tony was stroking himself, slowly and softly, to a rhythm that seemed as practiced and habitual as the one Steve employed on the days when he went for a bath and tried to think about faceless girls to relieve himself.
Tony’s back was to him. Steve was no longer encased in his warmth. He wanted to touch him but didn’t know if he should.
to wait for better times. If we start living that way, we’re never gonna get what we want. And… I figure the darker it gets the more we should try to make the good moments count, don’t you think?”
“Yeah, sure. Just trying to figure out what’s going on here,” Tony said, and a second later, his eyes became their usual oily black, even as he kept walked right past Steve.
When Tony straightened up again, his gaze travelled over the vast space of the workshop. His body stilled. “I used to come here to clear my thoughts, you know,” he said without looking at Steve. “It was my sanctuary and I came here at least once a day… even when life was at its busiest.”
Tony opened his mouth to protest, but realized that—yes, that was exactly what he should be doing. “You think it’s that easy?”
If he was perfectly honest, the feelings for Tony had taken years to unlock. He had been so afraid at first that he had kept his attraction for him very close to the heart. Had turned himself away from all those revelations whenever he’d been near him.
As so many things in Steve’s life, it seemed to be an unfathomable coincidence, a string of events that could’ve easily led into a whole other direction. A part of him thought it was sheer luck that they were here now, but as he held Tony in his arms, a much larger part of his heart liked to think that they’d earned this—to be here, to be happy.
At a loss as to what else to do, Tony picked up the stack of mail that Steve had left in its usual place on the cupboard. He rifled through the letters with only the mildest of interest—he could already see from the envelope that those were SHIELD reports Steve had filled out and were not worth opening.
Adrenaline was still spiking through Steve’s veins, and the battle with Johann Schmidt was on constant replay in his mind. He had freed Bucky—had managed to find his still-alive friend against all odds, and now, he could finally do what he had always wanted to do.
“Yeah, you should’ve,” Steve agreed. “But I wouldn’t worry too much. He’ll be mad for a moment, and then he’ll be cool with it.” He leaned down and pressed a kiss against Tony’s lips. “I told Bucky.”
Before they left the tent, however, Tony yanked him back to kiss his breath away one more time. Steve didn’t find it in him to complain. His soft mouth touched his lips, and Steve closed his eyes and allowed himself to get lost in Tony for a little while longer.
There was a longer pause, and something in Tony’s expression gentled as he stepped up to him, reaching for both of his hands. “How’re you holding up?”
They’d decided to meet in the middle, in some smaller village near Lisbon. The room itself was nice enough, there were a lot of plants and greenery, and almost everything was made out of a lighter wood.
Sex with Tony still was breathtakingly, toe-curlingly, mind-blowingly perfect. They were completely in synch with each other, and after years of being together, they had memorized each and every one of their buttons and how exactly to press—or not to press them.
Tony let Steve cover him without any resistance, or maybe he was just too sleepy to care what Steve did. He only reached for him when the blanket was set in place, and Steve took the extended hand and squeezed it gently before setting it back on top of the blanket.
“Yeah? Seems to me half the people I know have turned out to be cunning bastards and we don’t know where anyone stands right now.”
“Put it out in the open,” Steve demanded with a hard tone, as always opting for the most up-front way possible. “Let everyone know that SHIELD is compromised.”
Steve hugged him back. “You know I am,” he agreed. “Watch this.” He reached for the baby’s left hand and gently stroked its palm with one finger. The boy’s little fist uncurled and he instinctively wrapped his own fingers around his father’s.
“I’ll be in slow motion. You’ll see it coming. You respond at any speed. Whatever comes naturally, okay?”
He reached for her hand, delicately caressing her knuckles with his thumb. “I’m sorry about what I said earlier… when I found out. You’re a good friend, and you care. I know that…”
Tony raised an eyebrow, smile firmly in place. Steve couldn’t remember seeing him do anything but smile the entire evening, and he probably wasn’t faring any better. “Did you tie a red ribbon around your dick? Because, I gotta tell you, my plans for tonight are kinda single-minded.”
Steve hummed, glancing at the clock. Tony was right, it wasn’t even past nine. “Where would you have us go?”
him and Steve felt the wonderful way their bodies pressed together. His own arms immediately moved to wrap around Tony's waist, anchoring him close and leaning his head down to smell his shampoo—Steve's shampoo, he realized with a sense of warmth he couldn't explain.
, Steve realized they were the best friends of the man he wanted to have at his side in any way said man wanted to be. And there was every chance that they would never accept him. They would never accept him at all.
"So, where would a quasi-fascistic high security organization keep extremely confidential and dangerous alien projects?" Tony asked as he peered through the windows they walked past before coming to a halt at the end of the corridor. Steve caught sight of the familiar barracks that Tony was gazing at now and exhaled lightly, knowing the answer.
Carol almost had the gauntlet before a whirl of purple light hit her square, blasting her off Thanos. Their strongest chance and she had been thrown away.
. It did get purposeful though, steady steps of waking and listening. Steve moved back to Brooklyn, getting a better reaction from Nat this time, and volunteered with
Tony should be calling for Stephen or Reed at the least, but this was the most bizarre yet fascinating threat he had faced in the last couple of months and he was kind of looking forward to it. He wondered when he began having preferences in threats but put that aside as he lowered his arm.
“In the Hudson,” Nat sounded skeptical but Steve nodded, “If this is your way of telling me that I should look on the bright side, I might – hit you with a peanut butter sandwich.”
He jumped in when Thanos’s frustration got him whaling on Tony, dragging the armour down by a leg. The shield wasn’t doing much damage but it got Thanos’ attention and Steve fell back on years of training, weaving between blows to find his spots, vibranium protecting him the best it could.
“Then you should go there now,” he answered, holding her gaze as he felt Rhodey’s eyes on him, “She’s smart, she’ll guess something is wrong too.”
“Among other things, yeah,” Steve admitted, taking a quick look of Tony’s more put together appearance, “What are you doing here?”
“I figured,” Sam lingered at the kitchen and turned to eye Steve, a muted sadness in his eyes, “I heard about Nat.”
"We've got him," Helen declared as she greeted them at the landing pad and Bruce came up behind her to help take Potts in.
Until the first missile dropped, and Steve raised the shield over himself and Thor in the last second before impact. It wasn’t enough though and the last visual Steve had before the roof caved in was of Tony’s visor covering his face.
The black dot racing across the pathway was loud, blazing over gravel and a less travelled road, and Steve didn’t stop his frown from smoothing over. His eyes tracked the arriving car and he watched as it went past him a few feet, engine whirring to a stop before it reversed, retracing the steps back to where he was. Steve felt the beginning of a smile as the window rolled down before rolling his eyes at the teasingly sad face.
It had probably also helped that Rhodey and Nebula had returned too, Rhodey effortlessly fitting into conversations with Clint as Nebula followed Tony around with a remembered protectiveness.
“That means he hasn’t got his hands on the gauntlet yet,” Steve surmised with a grim realization and beside him, Thor began rotating Mjölnir in one hand.
"Fascinating, isn't it," Steve heard from behind him and turned to see a floating man dressed in the same colour scheme as his fortress, "The loops of time."
He could hear Steve gathering the weapons from the bots they had disarmed but didn't turn to check, eyes flying over the flashing digits. Kang was a right bastard but his security was intricate, gossamer threads of intelligence that would have seduced Tony's AIs on a bad day, and if he didn't suspect that the guy wasn't taking credit for the work of other minds then he might have been impressed, to say the least. He almost began missing Scott when he finally cracked the last wall and slapped the pad sharply as he got to his feet.
“Should be something you could be doing too,” Steve pointed out and Tony looked at the ceiling before shooting him a baleful look, leaning forward to pick up the bottle of water, “Are you really trying the guilt route with me?”
He could still look Steve in the eye without wanting to throw himself out the nearest window and Steve could still hand him a screwdriver without telling him in a creepy tone that he wanted to test if his ‘screw’ would match Tony’s ‘bolt’.
“It’s not a tracker, I don’t need that,” Tony cracked the chip and grinned up at Steve, the first honest smile he had seen since he had met him again, “I’ve got Libby.”
"Wherever you'd choose," Kang replied and Steve's hackles rose at the casually dismissive tone that he'd heard from enough dictators, "I'm no slave to boundaries of land or space, Captain. My home is one with the flow of time, and you are privileged to witness it now. Come, I've waited for your arrival long enough."
The water was boiling slower than the soot travelling up the sides of the vessel and Steve couldn’t bother. It was a rarity, to not care.
Steve looked ahead at the holotable in front of them and let the thought settle in his head. His hand slipped into his suit pocket and he pulled out a ring, offering it to Pepper.
“We’re about 20 minutes from Detroit,” Steve leaned back on his seat and grinned sheepishly at the wry tone from the driver’s seat, “Why’d you have to be such a sucker, Rogers?”
“Thanks, Jarvis,” Tony said and the man blinked but Steve moved before he could question the casual affliction in tone. Jarvis left them to go inform Howard and Steve took in the room around him, noting the details and handpicked furniture.
“I’m sorry, sir, but this is reserved for vehicles only,” the guard at Janet’s fashion show repeated when Steve tried to find a spot for himself in the parking area.
The brush of lips against his made Steve blink, eyelashes brushing his cheeks, as he saw the irises of Tony’s eyes closer than he had ever gotten. Tony started to move back when Steve leaned forward and tried it again, this new experiment that felt better than he had imagined to be.
Still, Steve distractedly wondered if he could figure out when they had first done this. He clearly remembered the raunchier beginning, the first time they had 'slept together' with no real trace of sleep or clothes. It was the softer parts, the simply lying in close company, that didn't show the starting point in memory.
Steve couldn't keep himself from eyeing Tony a little hungrily, when he came out of the toilets with only his pants fastened loosely around his hips. He had taken the liberty of cleaning up their mess and collecting Tony's discarded clothes while Tony was busy, and was waiting with the items in hand outside the bathroom area.
Steve laughed and Tony found himself laughing with him, but then, he sobered immediately as he remembered something. Back then, his MIT presentation had been at the same day that Steve had gone to Lagos. Immediately, a million thoughts filled Tony’s head, but he dared not voice them.
“Come on,” Steve whined, propping himself up on his hands. And then he was looking at Tony over his broad shoulder, and Tony had to keep himself from laughing at the disgruntled look on Steve’s face. “I’m so close.”
“At ease,” Tony’s robotic voice resounded, and Steve heaved a breath of relief when Tony reached for his helmet and pulled it off. There were a few bad cuts and hematomas on his face, but otherwise, he seemed to be physically fine.
Tony laid his head back on his shoulder and Steve cradled him there. Steve’s heartbeat was unmistakably strong… and steady. “I used to wish that we could have just five more minutes together—after you’d left.”
Tony raised Steve’s hand to his lips and brushed a kiss across his knuckles. “They just want to get to know you. Make a good first impression, that’s all.”
Instead of giving an answer, Tony leaned up. In cases like these, there was usually no better answer than grasping a handful of hair and tugging someone down to his lips, swallowing him in an eager kiss. His tongue delved into Steve’s mouth, a whimper clawing at his throat at the sudden movement it caused.
Still. Why was he meddling in things that weren't his business? Because he was worried, sure, but also because he couldn't in clean conscience let Tony go through with his plan without at least trying to stop him. Bruce would never forgive him if something happened, and Steve wasn't keen on getting on the good doctor's bad side.
“I want us to work together,” Steve corrected. “Not work for me. Doesn’t work that way with us. If you realize halfway through that this isn’t it for you, you can still quit.”
His eyes landed on the aspirin Rhodey had placed at his disposal; the scent of fresh coffee hit the air. With another sigh, Tony snatched the pills and obediently followed his nose.
He nodded, more to himself, as he made to sit up. "I know I was a bit of an asshole yesterday, but you surprised me, with the whole, well, dramatic scene and all. And I didn’t mean to insult your friend,” he added, needing to explain, even though it didn’t seem to matter anymore.
The voices around him were yelling now. With tangible relief, he realized one of the voices belonged to Steve, and while hands pulled him back down on the cot, restraining him with some shackles, he pressed his eyes closed.
“Least that way we won’t end up bleeding all over the floor,” Steve said. He quickly grew silent, the words too portentous after all. “Sorry.”
The movie didn't really catch Steve's attention. He'd been thinking about the hallucination he'd had earlier, and was contemplating telling the others, but for the time being he decided not to, and just let their hangout continue as usual. When Tony came into the living room, however, he straightened up and turned to look at him and Bruce.
Steve was so wretchedly confused with himself he could barely move. Yet somehow, he managed to drag himself to the shower. His first shower after
Natasha crossed her arms and jutted her chin at him, eyes dark and serious. “Look, SHIELD’s modus operandi might have changed since we stepped out, but they’re still playing on our side.
"I can give you his excuse. Will that work for you?" Bruce didn't seem too affected by Steve's rant, he just stared at Steve contemplatively. "He's finishing his PhD."
“Sweetheart,” Steve prompted when he noticed Tony’s face fall. His mouth covered Tony’s then, and Tony felt fingertips brush across his chest, across his heart, as if Steve was trying to pull out the hurt. And it felt—it felt as if it was working.
“The stupid Secretary is only sending four?” Tony asked Ian as he walked further into the room. “I think I’m insulted.”
Things with Steve were… complicated, at best. Tony had been secretly crushing on Steve for the better part of his high school years (which, okay, weren’t all that much—he was by far the youngest graduate—but that wasn’t the point). So for the last one and a half years, he’d allowed himself to simply bask in the World Wonder that he’d managed to get Steve’s attention, at all.
When he walked out of the penthouse’s bathroom a good ten minutes later, JARVIS alerted him quietly of Bucky’s presence in the living room. Steve pulled on briefs and a t-shirt and slowly walked through the short hallway, only coming to a stop right before the last corner.
During the next couple of days, Tony spent most of his time in the workshop, discussing time travel and its risks with Bruce and Stephen Strange.
When Steve nodded, Tony leveled his mouth to his again. Meanwhile, he wrapped his free hand around Steve’s neck, pressing his brow intimately against his. And when Steve’s cock sprang into his hand, they both moaned for the feel of it all. His tentative fingers, so shy, so careful, running down the length of him in a way that turned him on more than anything else he’d experienced.
Once they’d left the corridor, Bucky walked over to the fridge, opening it and looking inside for a moment, before he retrieved two beers. He came back to the sofa area, sitting down next to Steve.
Keeping his breathing even, Steve clenched and unclenched his fists once, twice, then shook his head. "Funny," he said around a chuckle. "It's when people say 'no offense' that they say the most offensive stuff, isn't it?" He was shifting his weight from one foot to the other lightly as he spoke. "Do enlighten me,
“…a lot to deal with, I know,” Tony said, his voice sympathetic. “If I’d realized sooner who you were, I wouldn’t have told you. It’s not something you should know.”
Tony huffed a little.  It hurt to say, so badly, but now it was said.  And he felt better that he was no longer burdened by it.
He walked over to the bed and climbed in, straddling Steve's hips.  "I have no idea what you're talking about," said Tony innocently, reaching down to play with Steve's zipper.  "I'm just a dumb furry squirrel. Got any nuts for me?" He grinned wider, tugging at Steve's clothes.
Steve's mention of the other Avengers helped Tony sober up a little.  He hiccuped, looking down.  Feelings of guilt and embarrassment.  Tony was used to feeling guilty; he was plagued by it, ever since Afghanistan.  But embarrassment was a new one.  Tony Stark was not a man who was easily embarrassed.
Tiberius smiled sadly.  "I know what it's like to have an unpalatable neck, believe me.  Just mate him without biting him, Tony. Take him from the front, look into his eyes.  Relax. Steve chose you. The gland doesn't have a brain. Just ignore it."
! Do you think you serve as a good role model for other omegas who were force bonded?!" a woman said, her voice so loud she was almost shouting. Steve blinked.
"I mean, he has flashbacks sometimes," said Tony with a small shrug.  "Normally he's more responsive but it's probably just the heat... he's just gotta work through it... he'll be fine... back
it was HYDRA). With HYDRA Steve could be cold, merciless and not feel bad. He felt a little bad about all this.  The man was unarmed and unconscious and wearing a suit, as if he were a normal person.
Banksy had been the first to ask about Steve's neck directly; not even Tony had really brought it up.  He and Steve were both relieved that Tony's mark had been accepted again, at least partially, but Tony didn't want to talk about it to Steve.  He couldn't help but feel like the whole reason their bonding issues had been solidified was because of that dirty little trick Frond had taught him with the scent glands, and it made him feel uneasy, thinking they had actually gotten something beneficial out of the AU conference and out of Frond's terrifying D/s theories of partnership.
.  And he doesn't have to be.  Not anymore.  It's 2010, Hammer.  Wake up and smell the coffee," snarled Tony, ignoring Steve entirely.
He wiped his mouth with his napkin and set it on the table, indicating that their little dinner (well, dinner for Steve) was over.
judging my drinking habits, now, too," warned Tony.  Since Steve had moved in, JARVIS had picked up a new dimension of sass, which included the occasional old-timey curse.  The first time he'd casually exclaimed "Horsefeathers!" Tony had laughed until his sides ached. He thought about resetting JARVIS, but he sort of liked how Steve was influencing him.
do something mental he tries emotional blackmail," Steve muttered to himself, frowning as he turned a corner sharper than he should have. "Typical. Fucking typical. But you know what? My self-esteem isn't low enough to put with that shit," he half-talking to himself but he was okay with that. "He's
he thought.  Behind him, the heart monitor beeped a little faster, but it was too late, he was going under and he couldn't--
If Pepper had been around, she would have mentioned to Steve that part of Tony's cow-towed-ness was it being March.  Tony often suffered through a series of self-depreciating personal revelations in March. Sometimes they stuck, and sometimes they didn't.  Tony lost track of himself in the first two weeks every year, which is one of several reasons Pepper cancelled all his appointments during that time.  Tony couldn't be trusted to make rational decisions. Period.
He didn't like the smell of cigarettes. He never had. Steve associated it with coughing fits and cold walks home through streets full of dingy-looking bars. Back in the forties omegas never smoked. It simply wasn't the done thing. And it probably would have killed Steve if he'd tried to pick it up.
Steve stepped forward and the screaming died down; it was quiet for a few seconds, the crowd softening a little in respect. "The future is great and it's getting better, all the time.  But we can only do this if we work together. This isn't about focusing on what divides people. This is about focusing on what we have in common regardless of status, and regardless of biology. It's important to celebrate diversity, and respect it. But it's more important to see that we have so many similarities over our differences, to see ourselves in other people. To have empathy. That is what makes us strong as nation. Solidarity and support. I know for a fact that America can change for the better- it already has. And with the help of people like you..."
panicking. When the plane landed he was relieved, absolutely. He just wanted to get home, for both their sakes'. Tony was awake but not all that coherent. There was no one around to see so Steve just picked him up, his head tucked against the crook of his shoulder. He held him tightly, securely, not even noticing the sharp tug in his leg with each step and the ache in his stomach. All that mattered right now was getting Tony
He stomped down the hallway, carrying Steve, who was squirming a little, and Tony glanced down to murmur at him.  "I've got you," he reassured him.
Tony took his time trimming his beard.  He slid on a pair of rose-tinted sunglasses and loped downstairs, pulling on a wrist watch.  Pepper and Aria were standing impatiently by the door, each gripping a tablet and a couple of folders and binders.  Pepper's Blackberry was chirping with such frequency that a normal person might have thought it was broken. Aria was frowning at Steve, Steve was demolishing a pastry, and it occurred to Tony that they expected better from Steve, at least.  If not for him, they could have left early.
"Hello, everyone, welcome, welcome to the fourteenth annual Omega Auction for Charity..."  More clapping.
He sat up and ran a hand over his face, grunting a little as he felt the bullet wound tug unappreciatively.
"...do you mean president Roosevelt?" asked one of the agents, looking curious about this little historical fact.
Tony stared at him in shock, and then drew himself up.  His expression resolved into one of smug yet polite agreement.  "Fine. I'm a man of integrity and you did win me, fair and square.  Which car?"
Oh Shit. Tony was right. He stared down at himself, as if he required some sort of physical proof and the strange hot sensation in his gut wasn't enough. But then, Steve was still getting used to heats, proper ones. He'd only had a handful of them.
Donner was visibly nervous by the time they'd passed through the lobby and into the hotel lift. Chantelle squeezed his cheek with one hand. "Just be your nice, cutesy self and we'll be fine, Donnie."
"You just can't stay away from me, can you?" asked Tony.  He dove, twisting in the air, trying to make sure any shots fired were going up, not down and into the crowd, but it was impossible; he felt like he was in the middle of a fireworks display.  He was relying more on the digital navigation than his own eyes because the air was thick with smoke and lights; he was dodging every shot but just barely keeping up.
Steve frowned. He obviously wasn't impressed that Tony had gotten drunk, today of all days, and in front of a load of kids. "I'm coming back to talk to you lot," Steve said, giving 'Paul' a warning look before he grabbed Tony's arm and pulled him off towards their tent. He was becoming increasingly aware that this wasn't just about saving the omegas here but also showing them what right and wrong meant, and breaking it to them that someone had done awful things to the people they kept in the annex. But omegas like Paul had to know what they'd done, so they didn't do it again, or let other people do it to them.
"You argue with people you love. You...negotiate, you work things out. You can't just do everything he tells you and call that a relationship, that's like the definition of--" He could say
"Pietro.  Get the papers," hissed the man on the ground.  "Get them to Strucker, don't let--" He couldn't finish; Steve was twisting his ankle too hard.
"Something like that," Steve nodded. He wrapped an arm around Tony and lead him to the elevator. Just as they stepped inside Steph appeared, handing Steve a bag of chips and a collar. "Thanks," he told her and she flashed him a smile.
that moment in his heat was more than biology. Tony was possessive, he was an Alpha. He liked showing off pretty things. But that was about where it ended. At least, for him and Steve evidently. Steve didn't want to be upset by it. It was ridiculous. But having a drunk Tony going through a load of gorgeous women who all looked at him like competition, or something. It didn't put Steve in a good mood.
, if anything. The way he'd treated him. After everything he'd done.  Liberating his camp, against orders, no less.  And yet here Steve was, asking Bucky if
Tony wiggled a little, enjoying the feeling of being stuck inside Steve, knowing Steve was filled up him.  He turned his head to try to spit out some of the bitter flavor from Steve's neck, to no avail.
Steve was strangely relieved when Happy left the car. He didn't like this. He was always so sure of himself. So
"Maybe we should use a condom, if we do that again," Steve mumbled into a pillow. "Surely tricking my body like that ups the chances? I dunno, should check with Gleason..."
to get donuts at Winchell's the next morning... he doesn't care after he fucks you.  His assistant escorted us out and everything.  It was so embarrassing."  A few tears slid down her cheeks.  "I'm sorry, I'm drunk... I'm drunk and emotional... I just... I wish he'd fight over
Steve was strangely flattered that Fury trusted them with this, but that certainly didn't stop him from being annoyed. He gave Tony a weak smile and squeezed his hand. "The only reason I ever ended up in your lap in the first place was because of Nick," he said quietly. He'd actually never thought about that before this moment. But Fury had sent him undercover; it had been his suggestion. So for their anniversary, in a very strange way, this was oddly fitting.
He pushed aside the blankets-- he felt too hot anyway.  He slithered off the couch, kneeling on the ground with Steve, leaning forward to kiss him, his hands gripping Steve's bulging forearms.  Tony's eyes closed as their lips brushed, dry and soft and sensitive; he pushed Steve's lips apart with his tongue and slowly began exploring the folds of his mouth, working his jaw against Steve's, running his tongue over Steve's lips, letting out the occasionally, possessive growl.
He and Tony were lying in the bed, their hands tangled together.  They were alone, except for Tiberius, who was sitting beside the bed gently wiping sweat from Steve's forehead with a wet washcloth.
"Nope," confirmed Steve.  He breathed out.  "I'm scared of myself, Tony. I didn't know I could be like that-- that I could go that off the rails so badly.  That's why I want you in charge."
"Not really," mumbled Tony, immediately wrapping himself back around Steve when he came back to bed.  Based on the light streaming in through the windows, it was around dinnertime.  They'd slept away most of the afternoon.  He should probably eat; he'd only had a bowl of cereal all day.  But there was nothing he'd rather do than this.  He nosed Steve's neck, kissing him again, biting his neck.  Reclaiming him, as if he might have forgotten who Tony was during his brief trip to the kitchen and Tony had to re-establish that he was
Tony felt nothing but relief when they walked into their suite.  Gideon had spared no expense; there was an expansive living room and kitchenette, and in the bedroom, a bed large enough for several people.  There was no doubt a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. A vase of white roses sat on the table in the entryway and Tony touched one of the petals; they were indeed real.
They'd spent the last two months apart because of Steve's previous bond, which had mostly healed.  But now it was back, big and bold and unapologetic. Steve's bond with Bucky was no longer the ancient, wispy thing it had been.  It was a real bond... or at least as much as it could be, considering the state of Bucky's mind.
There was a blur of movement and Maria was knocked down onto the floor. Wanda stepped into the room and Aria watched in horror as she reached a hand out, her eyes flowing a ferocious sort of red.
"I don't think you need to think of it as a choice," disagreed Clint.  "The whole point of me inviting you here, Steve, was to show you that omegas don't have to be limited.  I think you need to talk it over with Tony and you two need to make a decision. And obviously, you need to protect yourself.  But hell... if you want two Alphas, I say go for it. It's not the forties anymore and it's okay for an omega to double-bond."
He waltzed out of the bathroom before Steve could get him any more aroused and slid one of Steve's towels around his waist.  He wiped away the steam from the mirror.  "Steve, do you have a razor I can borrow?  ...please tell me you don't still use a straight razor.  My face is a disaster, Steve.  My beard is supposed to look like the Stark Industries logo and instead it looks like someone from Nike tried to shave me in my sleep.  Ugh."
"I think we can all agree that the world really had improved quite a bit for everyone," said Louisa Ellis, firmly, diplomatically.
Steve practically sighed in relief as Tony's arm curled around him. His eyes fluttered open as he reached out, curling into Tony's touch with his hands bracing over his chest. "Better now you're here," he whispered, tilting his head under the crook of his shoulder. He breathed in his scent and savored his warmth. Steve didn't know what to say, how to explain how he was feeling.  He just hoped Tony could feel it too.
Tony gave Steve a small smile and fingered the sheets.  "Yeah. Memory foam's great," he agreed. "...probably the best thing about the twenty-first century, along with Dippin' Dots and Slinkies."  He got up and walked over to the closet. Taking a cue from Steve, who was dressed, Tony pulled on some lounge clothes. Tony "lounge" style was a rather crazy amalgamation of things: a pair of MIT sweatpants that were probably older than Steve was, an extra-large olive Jack Daniels shirt that was Tony had gotten free at a bar trivia night, and a silk dressing gown that was probably worth several thousand dollars and had previously been owned by his father.
"Don't think you really need mind control to convince a half-retarded Alpha to take a spade like that to town," said the other mildly.
Tony resisted the urge to slap DeSoto.  It wasn't his fault he was like this; no doubt seeing Trickshot disappear had been traumatizing.  Ron probably threatened DeSoto with the same fate, all the time; no wonder DeSoto was so meek. "But he got rid of Trickshot, didn't he?  He had to take him somewhere, didn't he?"
"Oh, and more bad news," said Clint.  His speech was off just a little bit, as if he were drunk.  It was clear he couldn't hear himself and so his words slurred just a tiny bit.  It took some getting used to.  "You know Sitwell? Well, uh... he's completely off the hook.  Because our detention and interrogation was considered illegal and coerced.  SHIELD canned him but they can't arrest him, so he's pretty much getting off scot-free."
There was a great round of applause when they stepped in and Steve tried to steel himself for the many countless conversations he would have to endure that he would probably have very little interest in.
," he said. "And the fact that it got all the way into the house makes you guys seem like easy pickings. And even if they just got recordings of you doing...that, it could definitely damage Steve's reputation."
"'s time for mission?" he mumbled, cracking open an eye.  Steve's eye, bright blue, was in his field of vision. "Lemme get a shower and throw on my suit, gimme a sec."  He yawned expansively and stretched, making no move to actually get up.
He wanted to yell that, no, he wasn't bothered by Steve's neck, but he wasn't technically allowed to speak.
Clint helped ease him back down onto the bench as Phil fanned out the blood samples on the surface beside him. "They took my blood. I think. A lot of it," Steve whispered.
that he was right.  Telling Natasha would spark a fight that would not end well.  Ultimately, the only thing that mattered was that Barney was safe.  Picking off old scabs would not change the past.
Danielle and Banksy were both offering him cards.  Banksy was offering him, specifically, one card, and it had his personal number on it.  Danielle was offering him four cards, one for herself and three others for members of the SA: Remi St. Laurent, Tiberius Stone, and Wendy Germaine.
"The only problem with sending in a plant is...we know exactly what we're sending them into," George said quietly. "Like...they could get seriously hurt in one of those places."
He gave a small, experimental tug, wanting to get out of Steve.  Still too early.  He heard Steve give a small noise of pain and he buried himself back in quickly.  "Sorry."
Steve's mind shuffled through a few different ways he could kill Melinda and a few ways he could hide the body without being caught. Perhaps it was mildly insane, but it helped calm him down.
Irshad smiled a little.  "He's got a good heart.  We're going to change the world.  Good-bye, Mr. Stark.  I'm sure we'll see each other again soon."
"I've never ridden a horse, actually. Thought always kind terrified me," Steve admitted. Riding horses for fun, especially in the forties, had been something for people who came from money. Steve certainly didn't and never had. He wasn't sure how he'd cope with the Stark lifestyle of extravagance. He'd always been a humble man from humble beginnings- buying a
Sitwell smiled suddenly and shook his head, amused.  "There's a bit of irony in it, isn't there? HYDRA wants him to breed, SHIELD doesn't... and here's you, his little beta friend, saying it's
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's go," said Tony, stooping to grab his helmet.  She frowned and exchanged a look with Clint. There was no doubt in her mind that if they came across the Winter Soldier, Tony would completely lose focus and the fight he would get into wouldn't be one based on logic, but on Alpha instinct.
When Steve stepped outside he stopped short; DeSoto was sitting on the couch.  His eyes widened. "How long have you been there?" he demanded.
Tony flipped open a ledger.  At least, he was hoping, at least Jarvis got paid a fair amount.  Howard didn't seem like someone who would pay omegas and Alphas differently.  He flipped through the old family finances, searching for Edwin Jarvis (or Ana Jarvis's) income, not finding them.  Were they on an annual salary instead of a monthly one? Tony kept flipping. Surely having two live-in servants would be in here somewhere.  He saw the wages for his nannies (
"You could pull strings.  You got leverage," he murmured as he began working his fingers into Steve's scalp, shampooing him.  "You and Fury had a falling out.  Tell him you'll forgive him if he'll put me on the fast-track to join.  You can even use me as a consultant or whatever... I just wanna be there.  Y'know, in case you guys can't solve a problem by punching it."  Steve's head lolled under his hands.  "I know what you're thinking:
"I know it's been a while, Buck," Steve breathed, his tone patient and admittedly manipulative. He moved up onto his knees.  "Do I need to show you what being bonded means? Why would we should never hurt each other?"
?"  Banjo's expression was conflicted.  "The special ones?  The misbehaving ones?  The ones they can't use in the kitchen?" tried Steve desperately.
again. Steve kept up a steady pace, exiting through the wrought-iron gates and following the curve of the Pacific Coast Highway down toward the shore. He was soon on the beach side. They was a few other odd joggers, and he passed an old couple. No one seemed to be recognizing him; he was blending in fine. The sun was warm as it kissed his skin too. Maybe he would finally get a tan.
!  Just the man I was looking for!  Can I steal him for a sec, Keisha?"  He gave Steve's arm a tug. "As if you even need makeup," he scoffed.  "Come on, let's go have some omega talk, I want you to meet Danielle.
It was like being drunk, Steve realized. Not a sensation he'd felt much since getting the serum.  Being bitten on the back of the neck had been the final straw for him; he was so chock-full of hormones that he felt like the whole world was coming in through a dreamlike haze, and it was difficult to parse out what was happening.  He tried to push himself to sit up but he couldn't quite make it. He frowned. "Buck. I can't-- I don't know-- how did we end up here?"
"  Tony was lost.  Was she saying she'd had an arvicolinectomy, like Ty?  She didn't smell weird like Ty. She mostly smelled like vanilla and cinnamon and Tony would have gladly taken her to bed if he wasn't with Steve.  Cartier had picked a damned good rep and even though it was manipulative of them, Tony couldn't help but admire that sort of business-oriented attitude.
"That depends on whether Malick actually loves him, or not. If he loves him, he'll forgive him. If he doesn't see him as a person..." Steve trailed off. The thought of Donner at one of those auctions sickened him. But he'd told Donner to call him if he ever wanted to leave Gideon. If things got that serious Steve sincerely hoped he would call.  Or maybe Donner had family and he'd just leave Malick and go to them.  He hoped, whatever Donner chose, it was
"Pew... pew.. pew..." whispered Tony under his breath.  They were crouched on the roof together; Tony was eyeballing a pair of patrolling guards below them, pretending to shoot them with his fingers.
They all piled into the two cars they had waiting for them. Aria handed Steve a tablet in his free hand. "The billboards are almost ready to go up," she told him excitedly. "The photoshoot has had great ratings. They're releasing the new range next month officially and you're its main face. They're paying you a lot. I'll direct it all to the 84 fund."
Steve had to wait for Tony to shower and get ready before he could venture outside. It was frustrating to feel so penned in, especially wit DeSoto lounging around in the living room. It never occurred to Steve that omegas oppressing
"Dunno.  Don't care.  Hope they fire Gideon's pasty white ass and send him back to whatever hole he crawled out of," snarled Tony.
"Nine hundred and eight-four," reported JARVIS automatically.  "Excluding the one Mr. Stark smashed over your head last week."
Suddenly the crowd went quiet and it took Tony a moment to realize why.  Then he spotted him.  In a full suit, Rhodey was standing there, back straight, jaw set, fists clenched.
"Hey, c'mon, man, I was a POW," protested Tony weakly, tapping his chest.  "...and I wasn't even enlisted!"
"Yours." Steve affirmed gently, running a hand through Tony's hair. He rested his head atop of Tony's and closed his eyes, sighing in relief as he felt the tension easing out of his Alpha. He squeezed the other's shoulders gently, wishing so badly that he could just make Tony feel better. But the whole point of this was that it was irrational, that was why it happened in the first place. "I love you Tony. And I'm not going anywhere."
at him. "Oh," she breathed, lips twitching up in a half smile. "You are good at this." Then she pulled back. "I see there's a lot of bad habits to iron out. Goodness knows why he thinks he's in charge."
They set Pietro and Wanda down on the floor leaning against one of the walls. Happy handed out the McDonald's. Aria started stress-eating fries, and feeding Steve the occasional chicken nugget.  Even sedated, Steve's ravenous super soldier hunger made him crave food.
Tony happily met Steve's lips when everyone began cheering, licking into his mouth and running his hand down his ass.  For a moment he was lost in Steve's mouth, in the firmness of his body and the taste of his kiss. Then Steve pulled away with an affectionate tug on his lower lip.
She laughed lightly.  "Mad that I seduced your omega?  Don't take it personally, Stark. If you want, I can teach you how to do it.  It's not Steve's fault he was born that way. And, no, I didn't want to swallow you whole.  The first round of poker is starting and I wanted to know if you wanted to be dealt in."
Tony was grateful when everyone began leaving his house, especially since he didn't want Donner to be around when Gideon kept calling.  Who knows... he might even try to show up. That would be bad. And George, with his irreverent sense of humor and own past, seemed like a decent guardian for Donner, at least for the present.
The agent in the elevator didn’t seem to notice much of them at first but Steve could feel her gaze linger on him, just a beat at first and then again. Any minute now she would recognize him and they would be done for.
"You need to stay down," he told as he dodged the weak attempt to stop him and eyed the state of Potts' wounds, "Doctor Potts, listen to me, we'll find a way to stop him but you need to rest a minute."
“Nothing,” Steve dunked the plate in the water again and picked up the other one, “I’m just trying something new this time.”
He would write every emotion over and over again if Steve was looking for it, and he let him read. He knew how precious it was, to
Sam hooted behind him and Steve let the thought slip, letting the rushing wind keep him in the present.
“Ask me later and I’ll let you know,” Howard laughed, the shock still fading from his voice but he took a breath before gazing at Tony, “For now, you still want to meet my baby girl?”
Potts hovered over him and muttered something in his ear, a constant stream of words too fast to catch on. He could hear bits of ‘realign', ‘paradox', and ‘same' but it didn't make sense till Tony's head came up.
"- and I didn't want to," Steve completed, letting the pause in conversation stay as he tested the wall's corners, "Okay, we need a new plan. Any ideas?"
They didn’t talk really, not on call or in visits, but somewhere during the third year after Thanos he had sent his first message on the number Pepper had passed along. It had been an inconsequential question, something about putting together an IKEA cabinet because he had finally opened the one he had left in Sharon’s apartment for storage a long time ago. She had insisted that he try one, though he suspected that it was mostly to laugh at his irrationally obsessive tendency to either buy only second hand furniture or buy off a catalogue of model homes. He hadn’t ever gotten to opening the package till he had finally gone to her apartment for the first time since the Snap and something about its complexity reminded him of Tony.
Steve raised the hammer to the sky, his intent fierce in his mind and called for lightning, feeling it answer in curls around his hand sparking up to meet the flash reaching down from above. With all his might, every ounce of him meaning the action in entirety, Steve brought the lightning down and threw Thanos off his feet.
“They’re not my bots!” Tony yelled as he dragged himself free from the nodes attached to his temple, “Go for the chest circuit!”
"And he doesn't want to know about a new version of his husband coming from nowhere?" Potts said with a dry tone of doubt, nodding when Strange stepped back, "Or you sent a message without telling these details?"
“So who do we talk to about this?” Scott asked finally and Nat stared at Steve that made him want to sigh.
“Right, all of that, agreed, but if you stay here,” Tony shifted the suit to the crook of his other arm and patted the hood of the car, “you’re toast too. Me, they won’t recognize. Also, we have two things to steal so if you’ve got a way to clone me right now or make me teleport to two places, I’m all ears. If not, we could stop trying to make you a human shield and get this done. Together.”
“What – Rocket, give her back her cutlery, good God,” Tony looked caught between being horrified and just plain tired.
“It’s open,” Steve said as he looked up from his bed, putting his file on his lap when Tony came in with a small eyeroll, “You were the one who knocked.”
“I’ll let you two get some rest then,” she said and kissed him on the cheek before leaving the room.
"You said there was a threat coming?" Strange asked as he dismissed the orange flashes of light from his hands, watching Potts as the man kneaded his neck.
“With occasional tasteful inputs, of course,” Tony shrugged, chuckling when Steve finally reached out to wrap his arms around the genius’ waist.
“But not seek him out?” Tony sounded perplexed and Steve could understand that. He knew his own tendencies well enough to know that it was expected of him and it wasn’t far off an accurate calculation. Tony knew him that way. So did Bucky, Steve remembered the last conversation he had had with the man before leaving on this journey.
There was an evening back in 2021, right before the Snap’s anniversary, when the roads of Manhattan were back to being busy and Steve had walked in the midst of an ignoring crowd. It was warm enough to skip a jacket when he had set out from his apartment but his hands were getting cold then, so he trudged the pavement of Park Avenue with his hands stuffed in his pockets. The Tower had long since lost its symbolic A and a more obsolete O gleamed down from the peak, jarring to Steve's eyes.
Peggy looked like the woman he had loved, the woman who would remember him without intervals of blankness.
Steve may have been away from his partner for a recent while but his image was steeped into his senses. He could recognize Tony in pitch darkness, with a curve of muscle or a brush of elbows. He had touched Tony's face in every degree of passion, traced dip and scar with bolder fingertips, and had etched out memories over his closed eyelids every waking night.
Today, Tony sat in the seat beside him lost in his own thoughts, staring out the window with his feet up on the dash and Steve didn’t bother to tell him to take it off.
"You are," Kang laughed, the curiosity of a powerful man about to step on someone's neck, "You always will be, in every point of time. And that is why you must be stopped. But you will be stopped only if he is stopped, I have learned that now."
It took a minute for the answer to come and Steve closed the phone before letting himself spend a moment in the silence of nowhere. One more moment of quiet and he moved forward, climbing back on his bike to start his way.
“It worked,” Tony repeated and outstretched a hand to switch the light out, “It just didn’t work with you. The stone gave the chance to someone who was closer.”
Steve shot him a mildly incredulous look and pointedly looked around them before meeting Tony’s eyes again.
"Yeah," Potts finished the last of his juice and placed the bottle at the bedside table, "Team, Tony."
The disappointment that washed over him, bursting his bubble when the man turned around and Steve faced a stranger; that never left his mind. Broken hope was worse than unwise belief.
for the Shocking Blue. Bruce had introduced him to the song once, during the early times of getting to know, and it had been his ice-breaker. He had spent fifteen minutes talking about why the song mentioned ‘godness’ instead of ‘goddess’ and his fascination with psychedelic bands before stopping to ask if Steve was bored. Tony had barged in then, coming from a meeting with Fury, and had answered for Steve whatever he thought fit.
"Hi," Steve called out, closing Benjamin Alire Sáenz's account of why Aristotle was torn over his affection for Dante, "Bruce finally kicked you out?"
“I think I’m drowning,” he stopped the fifteenth recording when his voice devolved into more cracks than sound.
"N-O," Tony tapped on the console's side and chanced a fleeting glance Potts' way before getting back to work. He may not know the man in depth but he knew pain, knew the irregular rhythm of it flashing in jerky movements, and Potts wasn't nearly as superhuman as he wanted to convince them Extremis made him. Tony had personal connections with the virus, an accidental affair that had probably been the unaddressed beginning of his miscommunication with Steve, and he knew that Potts was overselling his own fitness. He'd prefer that they didn't send back a dead man to the man's husband but they needed to get out of the current trap if that was to start.
"Alright then, that's fair," he looked back at the bed, rolling his shoulders with a wince, "You mind if we have this conversation while sitting? I didn't exactly stretch this morning and I hadn't planned on getting thrown four decades into the past with no warning."
“You do know that I’m driving,” Steve kicked his stand off with a show of a put upon sigh, “Also, we’re not racing anyone. That’s reckless talk and –”
Stephen insisted on checking the authenticity for himself and Tony sat on the other side of the lab, specifically atop Reed's table to watch as the sorcerer tried a spell on Potts to detect any falsities.
“When?” he asked instead and the panic in his heart was mixed with hope, a foolish hope that Tony didn’t look betrayed or annoyed.
It felt odd to Steve that Kang didn’t detect them making their escape but as they passed the corridors to the control chamber, he caught sight of the fortress detecting presence of the Avengers Tower while simultaneously targeting other areas of their friends. The security screens changed locale with every passing minute but they didn’t have time to pause and parse out a plan.
"Hi," he said and watched Steve's eyes skid over his face before jerking back to the plate he was cleaning.
“I’d be mildly worried if I didn’t understand the context,” Tony spread his arms apart and shrugged, “Still me, 2023. The last thing you saw me do was pull a cheap trick and say a cheesy line.”
There were a lot of them, photographs framed in simple borders placed on the mantle. It was like someone had needed proof of every memory, stored to revisit happiness whenever doubt threatened.
"No one's dying," Steve shook his head, eyes flitting away behind Tony before looking back at him with a fierceness that glistened in his eyes, "And I'd really prefer if you stopped taking anything I said as an attack. I'm not trying to insult you."
"I'm coming to the aerial bridge in 60 seconds, get there," Potts declared and grinned as he hit a final button, "And dampeners are down, comms back on?"
“Is Reed’s Bridge still active?” Steve hefted Potts to his feet, checking over Tony quickly as they stood.
citrus, no matter who made the rounds to the store. It was a habit to always ask Sam and the answer was the same.
Tony nodded because he knew about those who had loved Steve, deeply, devotedly, and with a dedication that had built its own legends. It was easy to love Steve Rogers, they said. It was beautiful to be loved by Steve, Tony could say. To be held by a man who pushed ahead to hide his vulnerabilities. Someone who would kiss with nerves because he wanted to, because he needed to, even if he didn't know how. Someone who waited for those were already his.
“What?” Steve turned to Tony but his husband was already walking forward, an intense focus on his face, “My phone can’t work in intergalactic networks, Tony.”
the nerves bundling together in his arms and brows consciously avoiding a frown. Tony pulled up a chair and sat down, watching Steve work at the dishes.
“You got the vials?” Tony asked when they finally were on their way back to the secluded parking, one quick stop to pick up the shield before they could leave. His voice was steady but Steve pretended to ignore the way Tony’s hands were flexing at his sides with an empty ache.
“T’Challa had to go back to Wakanda,” Sam told Steve as they left Rhodey with Fury, walking back to the house, “Hill is coordinating the clean-up with Ross.”
"Found it," Potts called out, straightening with a bitten-off wince before his screen widened to show a blueprint with notes in the background.
"Yeah," Tony said softly and Steve felt a pang of echoing understanding in his heart before Tony continued in a stronger voice, "Uh, yeah, got it. One Tesseract in the bag. You have the vials?"
When he finally tracked Tony down, he saw him with another man who left another jolt of familiarity in Steve. Howard had never been the closest when they had been friends but Steve had lost many friends who had proven to mean more after their loss. It was strange to count Howard as one of those now but maybe that was okay, Steve decided as he caught Tony's eye and gestured at his wrist. Maybe memories were easier to navigate than possibilities.
Now there was darkness and Steve stared down, peering into the quiet as Carol flew silently. He usually flew with Sam, who was now back and Steve hadn’t checked in-, hadn’t told him that he was going. Everybody was back, too many lost faces regained, and none of them had registered for Steve in the moment.
"I've never been good at pep-talks for myself," Potts didn't miss a beat as his fingers kneaded the wet mud, nimble movement of a practised engineer, "Warnings, though? That I'm good with. So, you want one of those?"
“Thanks,” he smiled at the server, pulling out his battered wallet and paid the bill with more tip than was probably expected but Steve wasn’t saving up for student loans or a roof over his head. The thought of going back to Brooklyn gnawed on his mind and the memory of staying at Sharon’s apartment hurt, but he still had some time to get there. Stepping out of the diner, he straightened his bomber and looked around for a bit before pulling his phone out. There was a message from an unknown number and one from Nat.
The words were casual but Steve had been her friend longer than he had realized and he could read the cautious hope, the test of re-evaluation. He knew he couldn’t stay the way she had, wear the name of either Avenger or Captain America. It wasn’t his mould right now and he couldn’t lie to the one person who had given him more honesty than he should have deserved.
Steve nodded, a cautious truth in the movement of neck and mind, and Tony's heart warmed a touch more at the understanding because this wasn't who they were before. It had taken time and Tony would never take back any moment of it because he could
“Before we moved to New York,” Tony spoke and Steve leaned back, noting the iron grip on the notepad, “Before you went guns blazing and exposed Zola, I met the man regularly. In the lab at New Jersey.”
She had witnessed it once before, when the media flaying had exceeded a line and it had been - a mess. The only reason that had been contained was the man who had been lying on a bed now.
“You burn water,” Tony said with the force of the Sahara in his voice, before turning the phone back to himself and peering at it, “And of course this needs an explanation. Everyone except me saw you like this.”
“Okay,” he repeated and ran, the baby tucked close to his chest, shielding her with his body as his feet raced towards the control room that was one floor below.
“Fine, that’s fine, but pick a place. Any place here,” he waved a hand out, looking between the two men, selling a pitch more real than he had anytime before, “Don’t be strangers.”
"I've got mine for now," he replied and hit the button for the hatch to close. He heard Strange comment about Steve's alternate self but it wasn't clear and the door shut to leave him alone.
It wasn’t a good sign when they landed in the parking lot of a government base and Steve dragged Tony down behind the nearest car when he heard movement.
“If I want?” Tony repeated and turned his seat around, making Steve take a step back to avoid hitting his knee, “Wait, that’s your battle-face. Why do you have your battle-face on? If I want what?”
Rhodey moved and Peter was stumbling towards him, past him to fall to his knees in front of the man who had been waiting for the kid for five years.
“Use the other basin,” he heard from behind him and it was Tony, Steve could see him in the reflection, standing at the entrance of the bathroom. Steve blinked at the mirror and then looked down at his hand. There was a beat of silence and then there was another hand over his, tanned and warm, fingers closing just above Steve’s wrist.
He didn't know if he trusted Natasha.  But his only other option at the moment was Fury.  So he didn't really have a choice.  "...take us to a conference room or something," he demanded.  He fought the urge to ask her when she and Steve had talked about bonding, what they had said.  There would be time for that later.  He wanted to sit Steve down and help him regain control before the inevitable interrogation started.  Tony was reminded, vaguely, of Monaco, how many people had attacked him with a barrage of questions when he'd been fighting for his life only minutes earlier.
Bucky stared at Steve, confused.  Karpov wasn't a bad man. Karpov was a brilliant, kind, selfless, perfect handler.  He gave him cigarettes, and orders.
been dying and a guy should really get a mulligan when it came coming face-to-face with one's impending, inevitable mortality.)
"--so you have to attend an awards ceremony in D.C. next week, and Aria has Steve's travel schedule before your anniversary with regards to his commencement speeches.  When you get back we have the charity gala planned for June 11th, which is a Saturday, and one year and ten days after your bonding, I've got professional botanists to move all these flowers to the ballroom the night before, we're doing it at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they can accommodate us and besides, Steve likes art... then the second week of June, Tony, you have a meeting with IUPAC about naming your new element, they absolutely will not let you name it 'badassium--'"
DeSoto appeared to being enjoying himself, even with Tony's telling off. Maybe he was enjoying not being around his Alpha, having a change of scene...or maybe he thought he really was a 'good' omega and thought he was setting the right kind of example for Steve. Whatever the reason, it bothered Steve...just like the pink scars on the man's shoulder. He knew him and Tony screwed up and sometimes upset each other but the thought of fighting, of Tony
for him. "I wouldn't be grateful. If someone bought me against my will, no matter what they gave me, I wouldn't be grateful," he said quietly. "And I don't think wanting to be with your family is a 'syndrome', Jesus Christ..." Steve leaned forward, head in his hands. What kind of bullshit did DeSoto's Alpha tell him to make him believe that kind of shit?
Steve gently moved to take Tony's hands and pin them under his head easily with one hand. He didn't squeeze. Tony could easily pull away if he wanted to. His other hand he braced by Tony's head, getting purchase and ready to ride. He rocked his hips down once, Tony's knot teasing at the edge of his hole but he hadn't taken him all in just yet.
He stopped by the soldier's holding cell to check on him.  He was lying there, shaking, eyes staring blank and unfocused.  The hair on the back of his neck had spiked and he had an impressive erection.  Both normal reactions to electroshock.
“Someone leaked this.  Someone told the press last night,” said Aria slowly.  “Steve being bonded before… that’s private.” She looked around suspiciously.
Tony settled down and turned on the TV, flipping through the channels idly.  Steve was still hovering. Tony didn't know what he wanted. He stared at the TV screen, trying to think of something to say.
He followed Steve toward the kitchen; Steve slammed open the stainless steel doors and a woman holding a pan of hashbrowns shrieked and dropped it, spilling potatoes everywhere.
He was morbidly curious about how they'd bonded without mating; had Bucky pinned him down, bit him, and then just walked away to beat off?  What kind of sick fuck could do that?  After biting Steve, Tony had felt like he couldn't help but mate him, too.  The amount of self-denial and willpower required

"You could've had any Alpha in the world and you paired up with him," Natasha muttered  to Steve, flashing him a smile to let him know she was kidding.  Bonding wasn't always rational.  It simply... was.
"Once we've got lunch," Steve murmured, pressing a kiss underneath Tony's ear. He squeezed his hand lightly as they headed back into their suite.
"For the last time," snarled Karpov into the phone, "the Winter Soldier program and Project Guiding Star are
"if by some magic, you lost the serum's effects and you were a little sick guy again, I'd still want you now," offered Tony.  "We're bonded and that means that I love you exactly how you are... even if..." He trailed off and began tracing Bucky's mark again.
"I only started having problems with Bucky since I went in the simulator," Steve breathed. "I really don't think that's a good idea. I was awake for months and nothing. I saw him in the simulation with a metal arm I couldn't have possibly known about. I mean- if you want proof that the simulation is bad for me then that's it. I'm not going back in that thing. No way." Before Sitwell could get a word in edge-ways Steve had convinced himself of his opinion.
"Don't people usually go to a fancy restaurant for their anniversary?" Steve asked and Aria gave him a look. Bucky and him didn't exactly do anniversaries; they'd never had the means to. It was a treat if there was food on the table and Steve wasn't sick.
Would Tony kill him?  He wasn't sure.  He didn't feel good about what he was doing, but having Steve here, in danger, was making his moral compass go haywire.  He would have done nearly anything, no matter how despicable, to protect the blond.  But feeling Jack writhing in his grip wasn't making him feel good about himself.  And the smell of fear rolling off of Justin was palpable and upsetting.
"...I like drawing to it," Steve hummed with a half-smile. He liked to exercise to pumping and hyped-up music; he found that the sixties and nineties had had some fantastic pop music.  But to draw he liked softer sounds... he liked to take his time. Steve hoped the soft music would will his heat to take its time, too.  "No...no frostbite," Steve echoed, brow taught in concentration as he flexed his fingers under Tony's hand. Yes. He could feel them. It was okay. Steve let out a shaky breath and his eyes slipped shut in relief. "None."
They had to swing by the hospital on the way to the airport; Trickshot was waiting for them in a wheelchair in the lobby, chatting animatedly with a nurse.  His face broke into a grin when he saw Steve.
him, and it felt like he did. Steve whined loudly as he was filled, aware of that sensation and little else. His body tensed and his back arced up and Steve only realised he'd come to when he felt the wetness of his stomach. He squirmed beneath him, looking at his Alpha with a dazed expression like he was only just now seeing him for the first time.
? Jesus Christ!" He ran a hand over his face. Steve had thought domestic abuse was illegal now. (In the forties things were a lot more lenient. They used to hear their neighbours argue all the time in Brooklyn. Steve saw the wife come out with a black eye once. Bucky told him he shouldn't report it to the police. Steve hadn't and he hated himself for it for months until the couple moved out, and even after that).
The Alpha laughed again. "Am I really supposed to believe that our precious Captain America is capable of torture?"
Steve could still remember it. He could remember it like it was yesterday. The burning blue heat from it and the ghoulish light that  blinded his eyes as he was-
leaves him, he's done. Sure, everyone's for equality with his face on it. But they won't like him when he's just a reject. Even if Tony just cheats on him, but doesn't leave him, Steve is
He was lightning-fast; he grabbed Steve and threw him off-balance, an easy maneuver, considering the state of Steve's sprained ankle, and slammed him into the wall, pinning him with his left arm.  With his right, with surprising delicacy, he stuck a syringe into the crook of Steve's arm.
Steve let out a desperate and relieved sound as Tony pushed a third finger into him. He could take more, he knew could, but this was enough and when the other's middle fingers brushed that special spot inside of him it made him see stars and Steve gasped under him, eyes rolling back in bliss as he could feel himself growing close. Tony's mouth was sinful on his cock and he was beginning to understand now why Tony had been so appalled before at him not knowing what a blowjob felt like. Because it was fucking
Steve sighed loudly enough for Tony to hear. "Right. It's been like an hour, Tony. You nearly died once today, isn't that enough?" He almost sounded like PA Stan, because really there hadn't been much of a difference. Sure, Steve had been a little more professional and less confrontational. But he hadn't
.  I don't want people thinking you're cavalier or that you're celebrating getting off.  Don't make a joke about getting off, Tony."
"Peggy said one of her favorite shows was thing called Blackadder; maybe we could watch that? I think it's supposed to be funny," Steve said and JARVIS piped up from overhead.
...Tony remembered, though, that Steve had been sick.  He's seen pictures of pre-serum Steve.  He probably wouldn't have wanted to fuck the fragile omega either; Steve had looked so terribly breakable, so delicate.  Tony's stomach turned; what if, once the other Alpha saw the new and improved Steve, he decided he wanted the omega after all?  Wanted to mate him properly?
Steve moved to plate up their food as Tony sulked over his steaming cup. Steve fetched cutlery and then they sat down to eat. He crossed one leg over the other neatly and picked up his tea, sipping it with an approving hum. Steve smiled again at Tony over his mug when their eyes met.
He had rolled off Steve during the night.  He wearily, automatically clambered back on top of him, protectively, nosing his neck affectionately.  "...'mega..." His voice was thick with sleep. Steve winced a little and Tony realized there was a heavy bruise on his neck.  Steve was fair, and bruised easily. Tony nosed him again, gently, an apology for hurting him. Sleep was already dragging him back down.  "They sedated me, huh?" he mumbled, hugging Steve to him. "...love you... sorry, Stevie... gotta sleep... no more fights, 'k? ...I can't always be comin' up from the docks to save you... "  He mumbled something else, in Russian, and then he was out again.
"...I don't know if this helps, but Tony's here," said Clint quietly while Phil poked around Steve's mouth.  "He came with us. He's the one who carried you out."
"I'll meet you outside, okay?  You go wait outside, I'll be out soon.  The gantry for the four takes, like, ten minutes," said Tony breezily.  The Mark IV had been roughed up back in May, when he'd fought Rhodey in it, but he'd patched it up over the last few months.  In between patching up that, and the suit that had been dented up at the Expo, and the V, which Vanko had really fucked up in Monaco, Tony hadn't gotten too much work into the VII yet.  He had to admit, he was itching to get it done, but he doubted he'd get the actual flight test for at least a year. Once he figured it out, though, building non-gantry suits would be a snap.  Ha. A snap.  Snap on, snap off.  That was the plan.
Steve practically jumped, his eyes flying open. It was Dani. She had a hand on his shoulder and was smiling down at him politely. He stared back dumbly.
never been to a charity gala before," said Tony, rolling his eyes a little and clapping along with everyone else.
"And what is it that you do, exactly?" Steve asked, catching Bennett a little off guard. The Alpha looked up at him, polite enough to not look surprised at Steve talking to him.
"My two favorite boys," she said, beaming, giving Steve's arm an affectionate squeeze.  "And just in time, I just put on the kettle..."
"It's okay... I got you... we're okay..." murmured Tony soothingly.  The words were without any real meaning, just comforting white noise.  Steve's body was stiff and shaking.  Tony was shaking, too.
That night they were given their own private room. Both Steve and Tony were sore but still insisted on curling up together in one bed, Steve's head tucked under Tony's chin on his chest. The day had been chaos and death and a battle. It felt so strange for it to suddenly be
He could have played around all day, but he wanted to get back and have a few drinks before Steve returned.  He zipped back to the house and went down to the basement, feeling refreshed.  He mixed himself a martini at the minibar in the corner after the suit had been pulled off of him, taking a few shots of straight gin to tide himself over.
How long had he been asleep?  He'd gone down at seven but the light coming in from the west windows was long and hazy and orange and he felt completely disoriented.
He was forced to admit that Fury was right.  Their bond, though wonderful, was extremely exploitable.  Tony had gone forty years unpaired, thinking that it was stupid and pointless, but he had never realized what he was missing.  Now that he had bitten Steve, the thought of being without him was unthinkable.
, thought another part of Tony's mind, and he laughed out loud, his hand tangling into Steve's hair, his hips bucking up, seeking more of Steve's mouth.
"It's nice to meet you Charlotte," Steve told her when the two Alphas clearly weren't listening. Charlotte's whole face lit up at that. She pushed a strand of hair out of her eyes and smiled at him.
"You don't understand," said the omega miserably, looking up.  His eyes were puffy.  "You don't understand what you'd even be forgiving me for.  What's the point? There isn't one." Steve sniffed, shoulders trembling instead of the violent shake from before. He was calming down, if very slowly.
He relaxed on top of Steve, laying his head on the other's chest, listening to the beat of his heart and enjoying the steady up and down movements of his breathing.  He closed his eyes and before he knew it he was--
"He's not a dog, Pietro.  He can take care of himself," said Wanda gently.  "But it's not safe for him to be around you."
Steve gave Pepper a strange look but still followed her out of the room, just as Rhodey was walking in. He blinked in surprise at seeing a room full of agents. "Sam Wilson, Colonel," Sam greeted, easing away the awkwardness as he held out a hand.
generation." He glanced over to Tony by the bar.  He was looking a little worse for wear, and who could blame him? If Steve could get drunk he would drowning every one of his sorrows right now.  Not to mention the ache in his stomach and the stab in his leg.  It really was troublesome that painkillers stopped working on him within the first ten minutes. "Please excuse me," he murmured and then slipped away to Tony's side.
He was tense.  Prepared to receive his due.  The worst-case scenario was the chair, a re-training session.  But he also expected to be slapped around a bit.  They did that, when they were frustrated.  He wasn't looking forward to it.  He healed quickly, but nonetheless, he'd had surgery recently; the eye that had gone fuzzy was fixed but he still got terrible headaches behind it, and his teeth were delicate after the doctor's attention to them.
"Retro shirt, retro boyfriend," said Tony, tugging off the V-neck and swapping it with the grey shirt.
"The tesseract is bad Tony. This isn't something to be excited over," Steve said, his eyes dark with the memory. He remembered death. The manic gleam in Johann's eyes as he fantasized about it, the greedy excitement about getting his hands on the cube. There was nothing good that could come of that glowing cube.  That much Steve was sure of.
No, Tony was one of those people who worked late at night, from hotel rooms and from private jets and, in one memorable instance, in the bathroom of a Ritz Carlton.
"He'll be fine, though, right?  He's awake, they said," said Banksy in a hushed voice.  "They said he's comfortable-- he's a fighter. That's Boz, he's a fighter, you know, and he's very healthy for his age.  He-- he was fine yesterday, perfectly fine."
Tony had let Steve lead the way through the museum lobby... but when they got to the exhibit, he'd instantly become single-mindedly fascinated.
." She gestured to both of them like their bond was tangible in the air. Aria was a beta; she couldn't feel it but she'd worked with enough couples to know what she was dealing with.
"Do you either of you have any idea what you're looking for?" Lydia said, "or have you come in with an open mind?"
"Oh, great, then we're all pals!" exclaimed Tony with delight.  "That was easy, great, I love it when things are easy.  Here's your drink back."  Tony handed her an empty glass.  "If you'll excuse me, I think I see Chloe over there... hey, Stan, I'm starving, grab me a drink?"
lucky to have been given this chance," Maria pointed out sternly. "And to have gotten to see you again."
Donner seemed to consider then, then looked at Steve again.  Disarmingly, he smiled. "So I'm going to have a baby?"
Steve's own cock was hard and leaking where it was curved against his abdomen. His thighs worked easily as he rode Tony with abandon, fucking himself down a little harder to bring Tony to release.
Tony was well-aware that a lot of his views were old-fashioned.  His father had been in a traditional trio, for example, with a proper wife and a subservient omega, and Tony was used to omegas being butlers and maids and things of that nature.  But Steve was slowly turning all that on its head and Tony wanted to help because wasn't that his thing, shaking things up, saving the world, making it better?
"If Barnes has made it this far, he can keep going," Clint said. "He has a good skill set. He can look after himself."
Tony stared at the little building spinning on the floor with the shield in the center, panting, shaking, heart piercing his chest with every painful beat.
"None of them appear to have punctured anything vital.  You're very lucky, Captain," the doctor informed him.
They disappeared out the door a few minutes later. Donner watched with a frown, waffle being chewed slowly.
They had tried to put a couple of different pain medications into the IV bags but nothing seemed to work especially well; in the end, they had simply kept replacing a cold, damp cloth on the back of Steve's neck.  Steve's body tore through the IV bags like crazy, clearly desperate for both water and nutrients.
"Enjoy your honeymoon. Call if someone tries to kill you again." Natasha threw them a deadly smile over her shoulder as she pulled up to one of the airport's gates.
"Sorry to interrupt the pow-wow.  I'm going to go talk to our little friend, I'll be back in time for..."  Tony trailed off, staring at them.  All three looked.. magnificent.  Pepper's hair was shining with a coppery gleam and Steve's muscles were taut and even Phil had a certain sort of understated charm.  Tony's mouth went dry.
Tony wanted to turned and yell at Steve for making this all about Bucky.  For asking that scientist about him and for using his death to justify all those other deaths.  But Bucky wasn't dead, was he? Because when Steve had asked about him, asked about James Buchanan Barnes, the scientist had known exactly who he meant and he said he didn't have clearance to the Winter Soldier program.  That pretty much confirmed what Steve had been saying all along.
She gave him the coordinates.  A quick glance told Steve that they were for somewhere in Montana, which seemed rather odd.  There wasn't anything in Montana, nothing of significance, in Steve's memory. Montana was one of those lonely, unimportant states people sort of forgot existed.
He took a while getting settled in. Steve had a long shower and dressed in a fresh set of clothes. Dark jeans and a navy sweatshirt. Then he unpacked the necessities. Toothbrush, computer and knife (courtesy of Natasha) which he left on the bedside. Getting it through airport security had been laughably easy.  Someone, thought Steve idly, oughta do something about that.
he mentally corrected himself, remembering that Bucky-from-the-forties and Winter-Soldier-from-Yemen were the same person.  But the public didn't know that. In their minds there was Steve's-old-mate-from-the-forties-who-was-like-ninety-years-old-now, and the-guy-in-Yemen-who-force-bonded-him.
"You don't have many omega friends, do you?" he said.  "It must be really lonely, working for SHIELD with a bunch of Alphas and betas.  I know Mr. Malick oversees SHIELD because Donner told me so. He says it would be better if there weren't omegas, because they could get hurt.  ...it doesn't sound any better, your life. You got shot twenty times, you said. Most omegas here haven't
Tony propped his head up on a fist and his elbow on the table, looking amused.  "Honestly, not so great, pretty sure I'm about to be murdered."
"You said that name before.  Karpov.  After the practice simulation," Natasha said softly, gaze darting between the two of them. "Steve, we should go.  ...Steve?  Steve!"
The room reeked like desire, like sex.  Tony could smell the slick between Steve's legs.  But he couldn't just let Steve...
Tony snagged a bottle of liquor from the bar.  "I'm going to bed," he said. And that's exactly what he did.
He laid down over him, kissing the salt off his cheeks, wriggling his hips, thrusting into Steve with grunts of effort, Steve's body clenching and drawing him in with every rhythmic push.
"There it is... there you go," murmured Tony, both hands caressing Steve's body as he came.  He nuzzled the back of Steve's neck, peppering his skin with kisses.  "Good omega... good boy... yes..."
"Pals. Yeah. Ha," Steve let out a bitter sounding laugh. Buck would use that word all the time. They were just
"Here. They told me you'd be cold." Brock offered him his jacket, which Steve reluctantly accepted. It smelt of the wrong Alpha but it was warm, at least, and that was something.
In the other room, he was texting, trying to get in.  He needed to talk to the man who'd nearly killed him.  Needed to find out who the hell he was, where he'd gotten the arc reactor design.  He was calling in every favor he could to go see him and he was pretty sure he was in.
like last year," she said with a sob.  "Only, last year, instead of a fight, me and Tony and Regan and Mercedes went upstairs... but then he
Steve practically preened at the praise, his back arcing prettily in a feline manner as he nuzzled against Tony's jaw and the dip of his neck. Something about Tony calling him a
"Oh, and the video you made Steve. We still want to release it online even though you'll be there. If you're going to be on the ground you'll be pretty busy all day. Think of it as your press release, so the rest of the world actually know what you're doing. Then you can focus on the kids and ignore the press on the day, yeah?" Kerry said.
He glanced sideways to see Clint perched in the rafters, looking bored as hell. One leg was swinging down idly.
He had lost himself.  He had been... not him.  His memories, his thoughts... it was all muddled up in dreams of Russian winters and wars fought before he'd even been born.  That was the worst part.  Not the death or pain or any of that stuff.  The loss of
"I'm not your Alpha," said Tony after a moment.  The words were so hard to grind out, but he did that with surprising steadiness.  "You're just fucking with me, aren't you?  Is that how your team does it? Sends cute omegas out to recruit?  Tries to manipulate people into joining the dream team by pair bonding them to omegas?"  It was a vicious accusation.  Even Tony knew that while he was saying it.  Maybe that's why he said it.  He couldn't afford to have Steve hang around, ruin the safe life he'd created for himself.  "Well, it didn't work. I don't even want your omega.  You can take him back, Romanoff.  In case any of you got the wrong idea, we never mated; he doesn't want me, and I don't want him. I'm happy being single and I don't know what his deal is, and I really don't care.  I care about Iron Man.  End of list.  And now that the reactor problem's been solved, I'm back to business as usual. Which means I don't have time for your stupid little diversity project, and I sure as hell wouldn't want to join knowing the uppity little omegas that you guys use to get shit done.  I'll pass on joining the team.  You can tell Fury to go fuck himself."
Bucky opened his eyes.  It was evening. He was lying on the pull-out sofa of the motel room and he could feel him.  Feel his omega. Feel that tough-as-nails sense of indignation and pride in himself, and it made Bucky's heart ache for him.
Tony felt something inside him churn almost painfully. This wasn’t the right time, nor the right setting for this conversation. “If by sources you mean
Steve rolled off of Tony and pulled him into his arms. He usually didn't display the full extent of his power with his one night stands. He didn't need to, and was worried it would freak them out. But this wasn't a one night stand, and Tony knew his powers well enough. So he encircled the man in his arms and breathed him in. It would all be fine. He and Tony would work it all out.
Tony huffed, genuinely surprised. He hadn’t expected that. And it was actually a bit funny, that in the midst of it all, they had both searched for a way to simply talk to each other. “Was that—”
before, but it makes sense, right? Of course I’d be dreaming of you when my life goes to literal hell. You were always there when I needed someone and I… I wracked my brain trying to get over the idea that I might’ve hurt you, and it’s crazy…”
Tony snorted. “I kind of own the place,” he said. “Not officially, but I will, in a few years, so…” He shrugged. “No objections.”
, Tony thought to himself. Before he could get a word out, however, Steve let his shield sink. Just a fraction, but it was there.
“You wouldn’t have,” Tony said, not unkindly, then cleared his throat. “And to be fair, it wasn’t anything you could have reasonably agreed to—not anything we could have discussed by looking at pros and cons. It was… the logical conclusion of everything that has happened to us so far, a look into the future, if you will. The Chitauri was just the beginning when it comes to us against an infinity of otherworldly threats, and I
Another two inhales and exhales later, curiosity got the better of him, and Steve pushed himself into a sitting position, pulling his sweatpants back over his hips. He grabbed a swipe from the box on his nightstand and rubbed it over his hands before he followed Tony through the door. On most days, Ian still slept in the cradle next to their bed. Only when things got a bit more, well,
It was the same strange feeling with Stark Mansion. He’d looked at it in newspapers before, sure, but he’d never imagined seeing it with his own eyes. And in his wildest fantasies, he’d never envisioned a time when he would be driving inside a limousine, holding another man’s hand, dwarfed in the shadow of such a monumental building.
With a pleased smile, Steve pushed at Tony’s pants, trying to get them off as well. While Tony raised his hips to help him, he was also trying to shove Steve’s pants down. They struggled, getting in each other’s way.
Steve smiled. Something caught in Tony’s chest and started to swell. “It’s not wasted if it brought us here.”
He saw his mirror image in the ice. Distorted maybe, but that was his face—it had to be. He squinted as his features, gauging his every move.
By that time, Steve wanted nothing more than leave this horrible ball. Or at least slip away to some quiet room for just a few minutes.
Steve felt heat rising to his cheeks. “I, uh, that… that would’ve been yesterday, I guess. I’m, well, I’m bi.” Every time he said it now, it did roll off his tongue a little easier.
Luckily, the door was unlocked. Steve wondered about it for a second, but the room was quiet and he preferred not to wake up anyone if he could help it. Looking around at the mildly messy room, Steve located the empty bed and raised his eyebrows in question. An affirmative nod from Tony was enough, although Steve wasn't entirely sure if it was an actual nod or just Tony falling asleep.
As if knowing what Tony had offered, Ian immediately held both his hands and lifted them in the air. Tony took him in his arms, and hopped him upwards the slightest of bit, which roused a happy laugh out of Ian’s mouth.
It felt a bit obscene to do this with his pants still pooled around his ankles, but it sort of fit the whole scenario, so Tony went with it. Steve was standing there in full Captain America regalia with only his dick hanging out, and it was so unbearably sexy, Tony didn’t know why all of his brain cells hadn’t fried yet.
“Tony,” Steve said after another beat, and heaved a low breath. His voice was crackling, electronic clicks breaking through the receiver. “I know it’s you.”
a chef. If you don’t watch out, I might not let you go again,” he mumbled, bowing his head a little.
Landing on his feet, Steve quickly raced to where the chip had fallen. As soon as he got his fingers around the device, though, Bucky shot at him and Steve barely had the time to raise his shield to block the bullet.
, in some way. He’d heard the warning loud and clear, had understood that Tony thought himself to be so broken and undeserving that he’d wanted Steve to keep the professional distance between them. However, Steve had cast all that aside, kissing Tony instead, pouring all of his repressed feelings into that kiss, wanting Tony to know that, however dark his past might had been, their future could still be something good.
I don’t. But I can’t fight our teammates either, no matter the cause. I can’t fight James. Look at me and tell me you’re not gonna pull your punches if you have to face Steve.”
A jolt of heat shimmied down Steve’s spine. He licked his lips and reached for his hand, pressing it down until there was no inch between them, looking down into his eyes intently. “I might not have realized it sooner, but I think the feelings were always there, too. One day, I didn’t even know you, and the other day you’d already taken up my whole mind.”
No matter how he'd tried to forget about their kiss, it kept pestering him. He hadn't responded at the time, and didn't get a proper taste, and he found that he absolutely couldn't wait to have it. He wouldn't.
it. She could talk me into anything. She’d say stuff like ‘I bet twenty of those won’t even fit in your tiny stomach’ … and I
Tony sighed and pressed himself further against Steve while tucking his head into the space beneath his chin. He loved the softness of Steve’s skin there, and without giving it a thought, brushed a fleeting kiss on his Adam’s apple.
Steve's hands reached up to cup Tony's face, gentle and careful. He forced the thought of how he'd so short a time ago had these hands at Tony's throat, and instead pulled him in for a light kiss. When they parted again, he closed his eyes.
“So we’ve got everything we ever wanted,” he told Bucky firmly, because now that his best friend was back at his side, safe and as well as could be expected under these circumstances, it was finally true.
He grinned toothily, grinding down because the position called for it. “Well. My first official act will probably be letting you fuck me on my new shiny CEO desk, and then, yeah, I will fire him.”
,” he said and then, a little more serious, “You’re the only reason I haven’t dissolved into a big puddle of unhappiness by now.”
"Me neither," he said truthfully, then pulled a little back, letting his eyes roam Tony's form. It was amazing how sexy he was, how much of a turn on just seeing him sprawled under Steve could be. "You're amazing," he whispered, then reached for the lube and condoms. Making quick work of opening the box and removing one foil pack, Steve tossed the rest of the condoms aside. He handed the condom to Tony and shifted their positions until he was settled between Tony's legs. "Alright?" he asked, reaching for the lube.
Natasha hummed, clearly not believing a word he said. She grabbed for her black sweatshirt—the most casual clothing he’d ever seen her wear—and walked towards the staircase. “Goodnight.”
Steve was quiet for a moment, like he always was whenever Tony asked him a question about the future, then said, “You improved it a few months ago.”
“I don’t know how to fix this,” Tony admitted, and for the first time in so long, he was able to see beyond the rage and grasping that tiny chance that might not have been lost, after all.
He was so immersed in the music that was far too happy for what he felt, that he didn’t hear the soft steps behind him. Only when Ian squealed and asked “Baba, up-py?”, Tony’s fingers slipped.
Steve agreed with a desperate nod, fingers abandoning Tony’s hole to rip his shoes off and then both pant-legs free. He stepped up between Tony’s now naked legs, winding both of them around his waist. “Sure you can take it?” he asked, and Tony could barely refrain from rolling his eyes.
Rubbing a hand over his face, Steve put the picture back down. He frowned once he spotted the one next to it. Another photograph. And this one… it was a photograph of Steve, Sam and… and Bucky. They were at some kind of theme park, wearing stupid hats, and cotton candy, and popcorn and…
"Thanks," Steve said, giving him a small smile. He ignored the boyfriend comment entirely and headed for the mentioned room.
It was a tight fit, and Steve grimaced at the friction at first. Tony, however, only cried out in ecstasy and he gasped as he clenched around him. Steve stilled for a moment, letting Tony get used to him. He saw his eyes trailing to the ceiling, full of awe and passion behind half-dropped eyelids.
Watching Steve’s eyes light up was the best thing ever. So he tugged him down for a kiss that rapidly lost control.
It was dark outside, only the moon cast a soft light down on him. Once he’d heard the door to his room opening, he spotted Steve’s silhouette behind the windows and Tony’s breath caught a little when he lingered on his profile. He really was beautiful. How had he never admitted to himself how beautiful Steve was?
Bucky rolled his eyes. "You mentioned a surprise," he said with an impatient huff. “I'm really not the most patient guy out there.”
He didn’t know what he’d expected, exactly, but the west wing didn’t look any different than the east wing. Every time he’d thought about the place where Indries had lived—the place that was now empty—he’d envisioned a forgotten place with cobwebbed walls, drawn curtains and white sheets covering the furniture. He’d envisioned a place no one lived in any more.
Clint grimaced. “Well, there’s something about Laura I’ve been meaning to tell you for a while now…”
“He’s in full Cap mode,” Natasha mused, and surprised Bucky with a kiss to his cheek. Then, she was about to open the door so they would make their presence known. Bucky stopped her with a touch on her arm, because—dammit, he knew he was being a coward about this, but they all seemed so
of trying to talk to Tony and failing monumentally, Steve was going to take whatever tiny chance he got.
. He only got a glimpse of Steve’s chest before his own shirt was dragged off him. Without pause, though, his eyes snapped back to all of that bare… skin… as soon as he could.
“I don’t know when things started to change, exactly, don’t know when I…” She sighed, closing her eyes with shades of self-irritation. Natasha wasn’t one to allow herself to show emotions at the flick of a wrist, and the possibility alone had Tony spell-bound. “I loved him as much as I could,” she continued. “Which wasn’t much considering who I was. Who he was. We were never what you’d consider a real couple. We never had what you and Steve have. We weren’t close… You can’t be close to someone who, as soon as he starts to realize that you might mean something to him, is already about to forget you again…” Looking down at the drained bottle of water, she asked, “Want another one?”
“Business associate,” Tony said promptly, but couldn’t find his words after that. The anger in him slowly losing to despair. He turned around again, not wanting Steve to see, and instead leaned against DUM-E’s frame.
“I want you to be happy,” Natasha said, her voice serious. “None of us have been particularly happy as of late. And you and Tony… I thought after everything, you would
Tony was laughing with him, a happy gleam in his eyes as they chased each other around the stream. And they were cold, and yes—still hungry. They were far from home and would potentially face even worse obstacles very soon, and yet, in this moment, Steve couldn’t imagine anywhere else he’d rather be.
Tony sighed and leaned up more fully, until he was halfway lying down on Steve again. One of his hands stroked Steve’s face, his hair, then he kissed his mouth again. “Don’t lose hope, alright? If you lose hope, I will lose this, too. And that’s not an option.”
Blinking, Steve stared down at his hands instead, moving them back and forth, as if they held the secrets of the universe.
After grabbing some pajamas for both him and Steve, Tony left for the bathroom. It did feel a little like a strange sleepover at a friend’s place, what with changing clothes in separate rooms, and vowing to keep his fingers from getting potentially inappropriate, but Tony would take what he could get.
Tony nudged his forehead with Steve’s before dipping to brush his lips against the nape of his throat. Steve shuddered when Tony took his pulse point between his lips.
Bucky waved a hand at both of them dismissively. “Steve’s too noble for his own good. Always has been. You probably still never had a proper girlfriend.”
“Tony,” Steve said in a low warning voice, his eyes not leaving the creature. In his peripheral vision, Tony saw him slowly reaching behind himself and taking hold of the shield that had been leaning against the couch table.
“Well,” Steve said after a moment, brushing hair out of Tony’s face. “That’s a hell of a thing, isn’t it?”
God, he couldn’t believe it. The boat had been in the ocean for months, far over a year. And it resurfaced today.
“Sorry… it’s nice to meet you, too,” he finally managed to say, his voice positively shaking. He wanted to say more—
Even in the dim light, the various injuries marring Barnes’ pale skin were painfully visible. Bruce had removed his jacket, shirt, and boots when he’d brought him into the room yesterday, needing the access to those wounds on his chest. He’d cleared off the excess blood before he’d covered each of them with gauze.
Steve sighed. He really tried not be too annoyed about these kinds of things, but Tony zoning out in the middle of a conversation was definitely something he’d never get used to. “Tony, come on…”
have a learning system. If everything had worked the way it was supposed to, DUM-E would’ve been able to make his own decisions, to learn what he wanted to do, and behave accordingly around others and…
Eventually, Bucky had come to a standstill near the sofa. A stack of books lay beside it and he stooped down to read the titles, most of which he probably recognized, because Steve’s fondness for classics hadn’t changed much in the last seventy-something years.
In the grand scheme of things, everything had worked just as Erskine and Stark had hoped it would. And still, Steve wasn’t enough. Colonel Phillips had said as much. He wouldn’t let Steve go after Schmidt, wouldn’t let him join the fight on the front lines.
“He is,” Steve agreed, then chuckled. “He’s also a real jerk. Infuriating, crass, arrogant… but underneath all that, he’s a good man. That’s all that ever mattered to me.”
There were no tears, no wet cheeks, just that: Dry, choking sobs leaving his lips because he didn’t know how to deal with being the reason Steve was gone.
Steve put both of his hands over his face, rubbing his skin. Then, after he regained some sort of composure, he drew in a deep breath and turned in his seat. “Let’s say I might have… feelings for him. You really think he’ll return them?”
He didn’t want much. Just a distraction from the waste he’d managed to turn his life into. Something that helped him to forget the look on Steve’s face after their fight with the Doombots—the way he’d looked at Tony like he was worth
“Yeah, whatever,” Tony said on an annoyed breath. Russian wasn’t exactly his forte, and he only caught on a few words. Still, he was almost relieved that Barnes was talking to him at all—and in full sentences.
Steve nodded harshly, his racing mind determined to keep up with every sensation. He was nervous and split apart with pleasure, focused on the wet slide of his erection inside Tony and, at the same time, the look on his face.
At some point, he’d become this broken shell, and he hadn’t yet found a way to piece himself back together again.
be safeguards,” Tony whispered against his lips once he’d drawn back a little. “We’ll find a compromise together, and we’ll work on this paper until we’re all satisfied with the outcome. I won’t force you to do this if you aren’t agreeing with every single word in there, but… sometimes it’s not enough to be against something, Steve. You have to be for something better.”
Steve nodded. He fisted the material of Tony’s sweater and tore the cloth away, wasting no pleasantries before he reached for Tony’s cock as well.
Did Steve know about them? Had he been as shell-shocked as Tony? Would he come back and leave as soon as he laid eyes on Tony, getting as far away as possible?
“I know. He can have his papa’s height as long as he keeps my hair,” Tony said fondly as he nuzzled the brown wisps of hair on Ian’s head.
“Well, when you put it like that,” Bucky agreed, grinning madly as he and Steve switched places so he could shoot two of Klaue’s guards, effectively clearing their way to the next level.
Steve took a deep breath, then nodded. He wrapped his arms around Tony again. “Love you,” he said in his ear.
The rest of the team was mingling around the ambulance now, and Steve looked over to where Wanda and Pietro were standing somewhat offside. They seemed awkward, standing here at all, as if they couldn’t decide if they were dismissed, now that the fight was over.
The second the words were out of Tony’s mouth, he regretted them. He couldn’t take it back now, though. Steve had decided to bring them to this level, and if Tony started to cower, he didn’t know if he could keep it together much longer.
This wasn’t what he’d wanted to create. This hadn’t been his vision. Ultron literally juggled the weight of chaos and order in his hands, and rejoiced in it.
He knew Tony had taken the brunt force of SHIELD’s downfall, and Steve… Steve had let him. He’d been in a bubble, isolated from the outside world. For weeks, nothing other than Bucky had mattered, and now that he could finally take a breath without the worry bearing down on him, he realized how much he had truly neglected Tony.
It happened too quickly for Steve to do anything. A fierce electric shock surged through Bucky’s body, and there was a moment of hurt-betrayal flashing across his eyes, before he went completely limp. He dropped forward, and Iron Man didn’t stop him from tumbling down on the floor.
So eventually, he’d called in a team meeting for later this day, also calling Rhodey and Pepper, because they deserved to know. Pepper couldn’t make it to New York on such a short notice, but she promised to visit soon. Rhodey, on the other hand, had arrived about half an hour ago, staring at Tony like he’d grown a second head.
“Flatterer,” Tony said. “But what I meant was these past two hours. Have you been enjoying the ball? I heard on fairly good account that you had no lack of willing conversation partners…”
There wasn’t enough alcohol on Dad’s green earth to drown out the harsh light of reality. And fuck it, Tony had tried. In the last few hours, he’d taken shot after shot, which only seemed to have the reverse effect. He couldn’t get drunk. Being the devil, getting drunk was a commitment of both the body and soul. He had to immerse himself in a
When Tony stirred, Steve reluctantly let his arm fall away from him. Tony glanced up and he still looked tired, a bit feverish—and already thinner than he had when they’d arrived here.
“Tony,” he whimpered, as Tony slipped a hand between them. His fingers encountered the waistband of Steve’s pants and diving beneath them without ceremony. And then Tony was touching him, a firm hand wrapping around his length, stroking him just the way he liked it. Tony was everywhere—oh God—his legs splayed on either side of Steve’s, his mouth peppering kisses all over his face. He had his cock in his hand and was stroking the hard length of him with such self-assurance.
Phil had left a little while ago, but he’d made his opinion perfectly clear. He was going to protect his agents, and since that involved at least one inhuman, he had already been wary about regulations from the beginning. Luckily for Tony, though, he couldn’t exactly make his opinion publicly known, since everyone believed that SHIELD no longer existed.
“Your people are crazy,” Bucky murmured and only slowly dragged his gaze away from him and Tony. There was more he wanted to say, Steve understood that, but now wasn’t the time.
The words hit Tony right where he didn’t need them. What was there to do? He had long stopped hating Steve for what had happened. He had allowed himself to change, too, and for better or worse, here they were now. He had never thought of Steve as a true friend before, but he could admit that the notion didn’t seem as far away. Steve was so… near.
Tony could see the hope in Steve’s expression crumble somewhat. “Bucky,” Steve echoed hoarsely, hands coming up as if in surrender. “I know you don’t remember… but your name is
The glass door of the workshop opened and Pepper walked in, spiking up the competence in the room by about a hundred percent. She looked around, assessing the situation for a heartbeat, then cast Tony a long-suffering look. “So, ‘knocked him out’ wasn’t a metaphor.”
. The way Tony had felt, in those few minutes, more valued, more cherished, more loved than he ever had in his entire life.
At that, Natasha woke up. Her green eyes were wide with confusion as she stared down at her arm, confused at first, before understanding dawned.
Strange had really done it. He had sent Tony back in time. With all his memories intact. Which meant that he had a real chance of changing events over the next few years.
Steve still had doubts, of course. While he never said anything outright, it was plainly obvious whenever they talked about it and by now, Tony’s greatest fear was that he’d somehow talked Steve into this. After all, he had been very clear that kids weren’t on his ten-year-agenda, and it was likely that the only reason they were even discussing it now was Steve settling for something Tony wanted.
Despite the fact that Natasha had meant those words to soothe Tony, Steve knew the second they had left her mouth that Tony would, in fact, freak out right now.
“Buck,” Steve said with a harsh voice, earning six wary glances. He was so tired of Bucky and Tony fighting all the time. He cleared his throat and turned his gaze back to Tony. “We’re grateful that we could come along. Bucky just doesn’t know how to show his gratitude.”
But—a more reasonable part of his brain supplied—he needed to face reality at some point, he needed to face Steve. And Natasha was right. She deserved better than to live down here in this cell. And he needed to find out if there was a life outside of this room waiting for him.
Steve frantically reached for his shield when the man leaped over the top of the hood to get to Bucky at the other side of the car
“We need to fix this,” Strange tried again. “And we need to do it now. Go back to the beginning and work from there. That’s why I brought you here.”
Steve watched his teammates with a sharp eye. On the far end of the training area Natasha and Bucky were going after one another with ferocity unmatched by any of the others; but that wasn’t unusual, so he wasn’t concerned.
Steve sat back down, took hold of Tony’s chin and forced him to look at him. “What. Happens. With. Us?”
They both smiled as their lips touched and kissed unhurriedly for a few seconds. These days, every moment they had for themselves needed to be treasured. Having Tony’s arms around him, his scent filling Steve’s nose, it was everything.
On his way, Steve's thoughts wandered back to the conversation he'd had with Tony when they'd gotten home the night before. He'd told Tony everything he'd gleaned from the visions, holding back no details in hopes of finally understanding what these visions were really about. He'd gotten a bad feeling about that last one—not the sex, obviously, but he didn’t know what to make of the conversation afterwards—Tony, however, seemed to think it wasn't a big concern.
As the sun’s rays shone down on them, all hundred thousand eyes in the area searched for a glimpse of the moon. And there it was—the huge fiery orange disc in the sky with its upper right corner sliced off by a tiny crescent.
“Oh God,” Steve rolled his eyes. “Yeah, he’s really getting up there, isn’t he? Seems like it was only six weeks ago that we brought him home. Where
A snort left Tony’s lips before he could even help himself. “Nope, no idea,” he answered, “you feeling anything yet? Headache, nausea, sudden tightness in your pants?”
“You hurt me, too.” Her tone wasn’t accusing or angry, just very, very soft. He gave a slight nod, moving his head as much as her grip would allow. Her gaze was piercing; she only ever looked at him like that when she tried to read him. But there was no ulterior motive now. There was only…
. But I really won’t hold it against you, alright? Or tell anyone. Besides, we both know it could’ve been anyone, so it’s not a… problem, right? And… look, Steve, these flashbacks keep coming and you really should tell me what’s triggering them so we can avoid that. Please?”
There was nothing for a long minute. Stane grew still, his inhuman eyes blinking once, narrowing as he met Steve’s confused gaze. “No, certainly not. Mrs. Stark never used the east wing. She didn’t like it much here, since there’s no view of the sea. The only good view is from the west wing. That’s where Tony and Mrs. Stark’s private rooms are located.”
“You as well,” Steve replied truthfully. Tony was wearing a black tux with a waistcoat that was of the same blue color as Steve’s tux. He looked perfectly comfortable and devilishly handsome.
“I just talked to a contact of mine,” Natasha said. “They’re heading towards Leipzig. To the airport.”
“Shit,” his lips formed the word before he could think it and Tony let out a strangled laugh, the numbness breaking in increments as the reality began hitting him in waves.
The only concession Steve had was that the robbers had been enhanced with advanced technological weapons and bodysuits. Somehow he gathered that it wouldn’t be enough to appease Tony right now.
It was a poor facsimile of a joke, an attempt to make Steve look less like he was about to have a breakdown maybe and he would, he knew that he definitely could at this point.
