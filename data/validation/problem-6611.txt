"SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap," Fury replied, harshly.
He tried to argue with himself, saying she wasn't his Toni; this Toni Stark was someone who looked like his Toni. It wasn't uncommon for people to look alike.
For a while, Toni just watched him, seeing how much he enjoyed what he was doing. She could see the happiness in his eyes as he worked, and it hit her. For the longest time, she had thought that he had hidden in his labs to hide from her. She thought he couldn't stand to be around her after her mother's death, but as she watched him, she realized it wasn't that. He hid for the same reason that she hid. He hid in the labs as it was the only place that brought him peace, which was the same with her.
Toni's eyes widen at Clint's icy tone. What the hell was going on? "Um, did someone die?" she asked. "Did World War III happen when I was away?" she asked. "Did someone eat the last piece of cake? I know c-"
At the moment, she was sitting in a beach chair at her Malibu mansion reading an interesting article about herself. When she saw it on the racks at the store, she plucked it right up as she wondered what they were gossiping about her now. Some of the stories were quite funny and they could always lift her spirts if ever needed; however, even if she didn't, it was always a good laugh. Right now for example, she was very chirper and was reading it as she spotted a fascinating article in it. It was one of those 'how did they know that.'
"I don't know what to do." Wiping her eyes, she glanced back toward his direction, her eyes focused on her device. She got the power core connected, and though there were some bugs, it should work. Maybe, she should just go home, and forget about everything. However, it was risky, because she hadn't tested it yet, and there was no telling where it would send her.
"Why not?" Toni replied. "This is my tower. It is my elevator. I can leave whatever I want wherever I want."
"You know how to get me all crazy, if you know what I mean," Loki said, smirking. His clothes, though still dainty, fit his frame better, which made it seem like he was taking care of himself.
"Boss, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes are requesting to communicate with you on a private channel," FRIDAY announces a moment later.
"And you also shouldn't leave a lady," she said, punching him in the shoulder. She cursed at herself when she saw him wink in pain. She really didn't mean to hit him that hard….granted, she didn't really hit him hard. She kept forgetting that he couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag. "You ditched me, Steve! Or should I just call you Rogers again."
Today was no different, but it didn't last. As soon as Carter left, Toni was wide awake. Kicking her feet over the edge of the cot, Toni buttoned up her shirt, which was partly undone to allow for some freedom around her neck. The good thing about rooming with Peggy was that she knew about the reactor and Toni didn't have to hide it, though she did catch the Agent staring at it. The reactor, which was dim as ever, had seemed to have stabled, but that didn't mean anything. It could still fail at any moment, and she knew for sure it would fail if that device misfired like it did before in the lab.
She stopped laughing and stared at her boyfriend—yes, boyfriend. Even now, it was hard to believe that she was dating someone. That she was committed to someone;
"Tony," he utters, putting his hand on his knee. It sounds like there's something else that he wants to say but he doesn't.
His mind turned back to Toni and her plan. Why did she go out with the 107? Was this whole thing planned? "I'm surprised you didn't ask me about Corporal Sark," Phillips stated as he ignored the look from Peggy.
With a deep breath, Toni followed Steve into the lounge, fighting the urge to reach out and grab his hand. It was difficult to focus on anything but his hand, his strong hand. She wanted to place her hand into his and hold on tight. She wanted to feel his strength as he held her. He was her rock, keeping her calm, and even with her overwhelming guilt, he was keeping her sane.
After a few deep breaths, she was able to settle her mind and get her breath back, but when she looked up and saw Rogers and Carter together, she almost lost it again. There they were still locked in each other's arms, staring at each other with an intimate disgusting look that it made her want to throw something. Why in the hell were they kissing?
Toni narrowed her eyes. "If was a bomb, I wouldn't just have got a broken arm." Though her memory of that night was hazy, she wouldn't describe it as an explosion. There wasn't a hole in the ground. There wasn't anything in pieces besides the pieces from her time. Everything just looked like it fell from a great height. Either way, how was she even alive? "And it wasn't like I did it on purpose," she stated. She didn't even know how she did it.
Killian's eyes widened as they dropped to her stomach for a second. He glanced back up and grinned. "I see. I can't say that I'm not disappointed, as I am, but I understand. My father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'"
Steve didn't waste any time as he took the head set from her and put it on. He could feel every eye on him as Natasha unmuted the comm. "Rhodes?" he spoke into the mic. "Is everything okay? Did something happen?" He didn't like being this far away from Toni, unable to see her daily. Unable to talk to her. He hated the radio silence required for SHEID missions, especially when she was struggling with her guilt. If there was a way he could go back in time and fix it, he would, even if it meant losing her.
"Why do I even try?" he asked, placing a kiss to her temple. He could feel her shiver as he kissed her, but he didn't let that stop him. If she didn't pull away from him, then he took it as a good sign.
Steve made a face as he let out a deep sigh. "It isn't a good fit, but yes, that's one reason. I want to be with you."
His heart pounded against his chest. Did she say what he thought she said? Was he hearing things? No, she really did say those words. He bounced back to his childhood and the countless light heads he suffered through as a child. She was making him feel like that sick kid again with a few simple words, but it felt different. "I love you too." He spoke, feeling her breath against his face. God, that felt amazing.
Rhodes, who Steve wasn't quite sure he liked, shifted in the stool. He looked highly uncomfortable in the Captain's presence. "They want to send it out, to give the illusion that everything is okay."
Using the radio frequency on her homemade scanner, she created a wireless link between the control system and her scanner, so she could tap the security feed while not in the room. As the footsteps were getting louder, she disguised the fact that the system was hacked, but she knew Howard would be able to figure it out in no time, however, that would be after she was gone.
Toni kept her gaze on the heels, hardly seeing Aunt Peggy not wearing them. Usually, whenever she heard the soft clicking of heels, it was a calming, knowing her favorite Aunt was there to see her. With Peggy, there was no judgement, and the genius loved that. She loved that she could talk to the Agent about anything. "I don't know if I agree. I feel like I don't know him at all," she said, slipping her right foot into the boot. It was a struggle with the laces still tight.
Steve glanced toward the window before heading to the door. He wasn't going to let her to run in this weather, not at this time. He wasn't sure what she was doing or what was going through her head, but he knew it couldn't be good. He couldn't help but blame himself for being away so much. He wished he could remain close and not have to travel to DC as much. DC was cold; New York was his home, even after all of these years. He didn't feel like himself anywhere else (Well besides the battlefield), and it wasn't because Toni was here, though it helped. Helped lot.
"Fine, later," Toni said, waving him off. "But definitely later." She would so like to continue this in her room.
He shrugged. "I think that normal for a parent-child relationship," he said, his hands still twitching in his lap.
On her shoulder, there was a discoloration, which drew his attention. "What is that?" he asked, trying to mask his growing anger. After getting to his feet to get a better look, he could see how far the darkened, yellowish bruise went down her back. "Who did this to you?" he asked, trying to keep his anger under control. He knew it wasn't fresh as the bruise was healing.
Toni squeezed her eyes closed, forcing herself to take few deep breaths, as her heart was off to the races, threating to pop out of her chest. In her head, she yelled at herself that this wasn't real, repeating it every few seconds when he didn't disappear. This wasn't real. Barnes wasn't real. He was dead, and no matter the tech invented, the man wasn't going to come back to life. He was
Florida wasn't on the Asset's list of favorite places, granted he didn't have a list to begin with. To have a list would mean he was more than a weapon, more than property, and he was not. He was a weapon that was sent places, ordered to kill and come to back when ordered. He was nothing more or less, and if he didn't obey, he was punished, punished severely. He wasn't human. He didn't have emotions or rights, and he had accepted that—not that he had any other choice or fight in him to go against this programming. His programming was law, his DNA, and he would follow it to the T, though at the moment that wasn't the case.
The sound of bullets rang though the ship as another explosion rumbled through the ship. Steve could hear people yell and shout, even as the alarms sounded. He could hear someone kill orders over the speakers, but it was all mumbles to the Captain, who was forced on the woman he loved. Fear flooded him as he imagined her death, which almost made his heart stop.
"Hey, Hey," Howard protected, waving his hands. "Not in front of my kid. She doesn't need to know this…However, I know how to protect myself."
Hearing footsteps, she guessed they were Pepper's as they were too light to be anyone else. "It is, so please take it easy on her today," Pepper ordered. "Please just let it go. She doesn't want to remember it."
Natasha walked past the stilled Toni, giving Steve a look. The Captain had yet to move as he eyed Toni. "I'm going to go in before they kill each other." Without waiting for a response, she disappeared into the room. The genius could hear the room silenced at the sight of Romanoff, and Toni had to give it to her; Romanoff could control a room with ease. It just took a single look to do it.
"Toni," he yelled. He shook her a little harder. "He doesn't have you. He won't hurt you again, Toni."
Barnes's glance went back to Toni for a second before turning back to Steve, whose nails were digging into his skin as he watched her struggle in pain. It was clear that she was hurt worse than she appeared, which pissed them both off.
After hearing what Jim wants, Tony knows he has to say no, even if the pilot fights him. He doesn't want—can't go to Movie Night, as there's no doubt that the Brooklyn Twins will be there, and he can't deal with them at the moment. His emotions are all over the place, and it's hard to think straight. "No," he says strongly without missing a beat.
With a deep sigh, Toni sat on the roof of Avengers' tower, and all she could do was stare out at the city that never slept. Though there were some people who didn't care for this city, the genius loved it, loved that there was always something to do. She loved that she could get pizza at any time. Loved that when she couldn't sleep that she could walk out at 3am and talk to someone. The sounds and lights of the city put her to peace like nothing else. To her, it was art, something that she could look at endlessly. It gave herself to focus on, well most of the time. Sometimes, it felt like a curse.
This was why he wanted and needed to kill the Blond who had a bad habit of touching the Brunette, though it seemed like he would need to kill two blonds…Both of these blondes didn't know that the dark hair brunette didn't belong to either of them, though the Asset couldn't say why exactly he thought that. No matter the reason, he wanted to show the both of them, who she belonged to—Wait, when did she become his?-, and he would do anything to show them that. The creepier of the two, the fake blond, was the one that Asset almost hunted down at that very second and killed, barely reframing from doing so. Killing him would anger his handlers, and he had a mission to complete which involved not being noticed. Killing someone as flashy as the Fake Blond wouldn't help his mission; in fact, it would hurt his mission, and he needed to succeed. He would succeed. He would get the brunette to submit to his handlers and be the prefect asset like him.
Toni thought as she pushed herself up from her seat. She had drifted during her shift and almost passed out, which would've been a bad thing. One: she didn't trust the guy she was working with, and two, she didn't need to have a nightmare in public where everyone could see. She was already the talk of the camp and she didn't need anything else added to the rumor mill, which was worse than the present day tabloids. These damn soldiers sure liked to gossip and Toni could've sworn that they were all teenage girls.
"Toni," Steve called, interrupting her thoughts, as he spun her his arms. "You're thinking too loud." He gently place his hands on her cheeks and held her still. "Listen to me, Toni. I have no interest in being anywhere else but here. So for once on your life, stop using that big brain of yours and kiss me."
"I need-" She started, but Phillips cut her off. "You're not going. You're staying back with Stark," he said. "It's too dangerous, and you
The man pushed himself up, slowly getting to his feet. His eyes weren't on her, looking past her at something. He looked almost scared, but Toni didn't look back to see what he was looking at. He would probably jump her once she turned her back. "You're not worth it," he snapped, before he turned and walked away. Still not looking behind her, Toni watched him walk away, before she turned back toward Central Park.
Being the genius that she was, Toni hardly went anywhere without her phone, so there was no way she left without it. So, where did she go? Should he go looking for her? Where would she have gone? Unless, she went to the Iron Man suit on the roof, which was his best bet. Turning around, he headed back out the door; however, he didn't have to go far. Toni was a few feet from his blond neighbor's door. Sharon—if he remembered the woman's name right- stood in her door framing with a…protective look in her eyes. Where did that come from?
"It's different then I remember," Toni distantly heard Peggy say. The agent was speaking softly, but her voice drafted through the air as there was nothing to drown out the sound. Phillips said something in reply, but Toni paid no attention as she stared at Peggy.
Toni could hear the panic in the young boy's voice, and she almost felt guilty, not that as she could at the moment. There was only one emotion screaming in her head, making everything else feel distance and cold. "Right, and then you said it, by name, while denying having said it!" she said, loudly as she leaned backward toward the car.
Fury crossed to his desk and stared at the papers on it. "Loki has the ability of illusions, and he has a vast knowledge of portals that no one else has."
If that wasn't bad enough, she had to deal with the Sassy Agent. She could handle the cold shoulder from Peggy, but it was draining. That woman never let up; she kept going and going and her insults weren't direct, but Toni knew they were about her. At first, Toni didn't blame her, but now, it was annoying. She had no idea why the agent was such a bitch. Was it because she brought up Rogers? Was she as close to him? Was she jealous? Why in the hell would she be jealous? There was and would be nothing going on between Rogers and her. Toni took a deep breath as she thought about it. Maybe, it was wrong to bring up Rogers, but Peggy shouldn't be taking it so seriously.
One of the elderly gentlemen smiled lightly as he spoke, "She had gone through a lot. It's best if there isn't people coming at her from every direction."
"I'm peachy," she replied, as she narrowed her eyes at him. It was the same answer that she had given her father, and it would be the same answer that she would give Phillips.
The man stepped into the light with his hands in the air, revealing who he was. "Relax," Barnes stated as he smiled at her. "It's just me."
It also brought out the reader's tears, though it was more than the words. There was another stain that caught the reader's attention. It was decade old blood that was speckled up the left side of the letter and photo. There wasn't enough to make the letter unreadable, but it made it harder to stomach. It was clear that this letter and photo was on the author as he died. Though the situation of his death was unable determinable from the items, it was heartbreaking to read the last thing the author wrote.
Shaking her head, Toni left the control room to give them some space, and it wasn't like either of them wanted her there. If they were saying goodbye, they would need some time to themselves and she was going to give them that. Not knowing where to go, Toni just stood outside of the control room and stared at Phillips who standing across from her. He was giving her a look. "Hey, Salty," she said weakly.
Deciding it was best to end it before they lost something more than their relationship, Pepper ended. She ended it quietly, without giving him a chance to fight, to argue this point, to do anything. She left with very little said, leaving Tony alone to his thoughts, which is never a good thing. For a while after that, Tony had locked himself in his lab, refusing to leave unless the world was coming to an end. However, in his line of work, that happens a lot.
, he bitterly thinks, because Tony doesn't remember the last time he has seen either Barnes or Rogers. The entire time he has been down here, neither of them has come down to see or talk to him. "Yea, just working on something," he says, trying to ignore the pain in his chest. He can take a hint. He isn't stupid.
It was night and day as Harley's eyes widened. His fear disappeared as he realized Tony was referring to. Pausing his struggle, Harley quickly reached in his pocket and used the device that Toni gave him, which blasts Savin to the ground with ease. Seeing the man stung, the boy wasted no time and placed distance between them as he could.
Toni's eye was still twitching. "I can take care of myself," she replied. She had heard of military women getting harassed in her time, but she could imagine that it was worse now. It scared her a bit to think about it; however, she wasn't going to let it get to her. Men were like dogs; if they smelled fear, they would attack.
Toni reluctantly let Peggy pull her, because she knew she couldn't help. She had to let Steve go down, even if she wondered what would change if he didn't. Maybe, the world would be a better place. Maybe, she should help. Sure, he was useful during the battle of New York and his leadership had saved them, but she didn't think that they couldn't handle it without him. Plus, it wasn't like he was going away. He would still be there, just old, which would be funny and Toni would love to see that as she danced around him. "Yea, I should be able to help," she said, shakily into the microphone. "There is nothing that I can't do. You know me."
"Don't do this," she yelled. She didn't want him to do this to himself as he was anything but a horrible friend. She on the other hand was a different story. She was
Steve looked at him with an eye brow raised. "Did something hit you in the head?" He paused as he thought about it. "Time travel? Have you fallen asleep reading a science fiction or something?"
It also doesn't hurt that Barnes and Rogers are the finest men on the planet. Seriously, Tony could and does drool every time they take off their shirts, and who wouldn't? James and Steve are pure muscle without even one ounce of fat on their bodies, and they're like two finely chiseled gods. Two examples of perfection that everyone- including straight ass men- can't help but look at. And when they wrestle each other in the gym for sport or in— oh, god, help him—the bedroom for pleasure, Tony can't help but watch at times. Seriously, he can get off just by watching them.
Yeah, that's the way you like it, isn't it? Your prey tied up and helpless." Her tone was completely nasty.
"Fine, I'll leave. Stark, have fun being alone," he replied, as he placed his hands on her small shoulders and pushed her back softly, which Toni allowed him to do so. As he walked away, he stated, "There's food upstairs. You should eat."
"I agree with the Colonel," FRIDAY states, cutting through the tension. If Tony doesn't know any better, there's a tone in her normally monotone voice. "Cease your actions and step-"
Toni couldn't see it, and she had no idea of where he was getting at. There was no way that he knew that she was his daughter. "A theory that you're completely and utterly insane?" she asked.
"No, but Banner's looking for answers in Stark's lab," Natasha answered from the corner of the room.
Before she could make out his face, she was pulled from her thoughts, as Rumlow lifted her off her feet, drawing her hazy attention. It was battle to look at him, as sleep wanted to pull her in. She compelled herself to look at the man, who held her, and even if she was too exhausted to think clearly, there was something about him as well. Though she didn't get a good look at him, he had a well-trimmed body and rustic look to him that Toni had to say was attracted. There was no doubt that he had the charm to go with it, but there was something off.
Natasha remained silent as she took a step forward, but she was giving Steve a look, a telling look. It was if she was telling the Super Soldier to do something, but Steve didn't move. He just stared at Pepper as she led Toni to another room. His eyes were narrowed, calculating, but he didn't move. Bruce glanced around, standing perfectly still. There was a clear struggle on his face as he glanced between Rhodes and Pepper, but he didn't say anything either. However, Clint was anything but silent. "Why? So you can spout your bullshit? Too afraid to admit it in front of us?"
She rolled her eyes, not sure if he was joking or not. She hoped he knew she was joking and that he was joking with her, because if he didn't, she didn't know what to do with him. "You're joking, right?"
"Toni, please wake up. Please," the voice called loudly. She wasn't put off by his voice as she was too busy trying to learn how to breathe again. Then all of the sudden, the air came rushing back to her lungs, almost overwhelming her, and she started to cough violently.
Steve had to hold back his glare at the sound of Fury's name. He didn't want to alert Fury just let, because he wanted to talk to Toni first. He wanted to give her time to adjust to being back. "Let wait a few more hours before we do that." He replied.
I do not own anything Marvel and I do not make any money off this. And i did use some Winter Soldier quotes. I think it is clear which ones those are.
"I'm but still can't sleep," he replied, allowing Bruce to change the subject. However, he didn't like the idea of using the Tesseract. "And I'm stuck on the sidelines."
"We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt's ass. What do you say, Rogers? It's your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?" There was a smile on Phillips' face that Toni hadn't seen before.
Sensing the tones in her voice, Rhodes backed off. "Okay," he replied, looking her over. In the Iron Man Suit, it was hard to get a good reading on her, but as her best friend, he could only always get a reading on her when he looked hard enough. "Why don't we get Rogers? Or he can meet us? He would come running if you called. He's deeply worried."
"Oh, yes! A crime against nature," Toni cried, as she reached for the door handle. Without wasting a second, she pushed the door open and chased after Romanoff. "A crime, I tell you."
"Clint is an idiot. I will deal with him. And don't listen to Rumlow or Rollins." As soon as Natasha could get Steve alone, she pulled him side and refused to let him go, trapping him in a corner. She was determined to talk.
consider herself a soldier. She didn't consider herself a hero in that sense. Those who really served were the heroes, like Rhodes and Wilson.
Rogers stood up and took a few steps toward her. "I wanted to explain, but I couldn't find the right words." He took a deep breath. "I….It isn't about you saving me. I just don't want to be saved. I want to be strong enough to save myself." He paused. "I hate being useless, which is what I am." He closed his eyes for a second before looking up. "I want to say sorry; it wasn't meant to be an insult. Please understand."
Toni shot up almost instantly, trying to get out of the bed, but Howard wouldn't let her. He held her tight, even with her intense glare. "Let go," she screamed angrily. She had no interest in being sedated, it terrified her. The inability to wake up scared her, especially with her nightmares. She didn't know what she would do if she couldn't wake from them. "I don't want to be sedated. I can't be.
He took a deep breath. "I don't know if I want you off my mind, Toni," he muttered as he laid his head on the table. Thinking about her also kept him sane as well. He didn't know if he should believe everything that Directory Nick Fury had told him, though it would be hard to disprove. Though it didn't matter if it was true, she was his focus point, his anchor.
Toni's stomach growled, but she ignored it. "Don't need reason, don't need rhyme. Ain't nothing I'd rather do." She crossed to her work desk, wondering if she could get food delivered to her. Maybe, she could get Happy to pick her up a burger from Burger King. "Going down, party time. My friends are gonna be there too, yeah." But she doubted the gang upstairs would let him through that easy.
"Rogers!" Toni said as she got to her feet. Being a solder soldier, Steve was already at the door before she could get off the ground. She knew there was no way to catch him—unless she got her suit, but she wasn't going to let that stop her. She didn't care that the rest of the room was laughing at her (and that Clint was starting a wrapping paper fight as she got out the door). She didn't care that her legs were screaming at her. She was going to get this man.
In Tony's distraction, Bucky doesn't waste a moment to get in front of him, and a second doesn't pass before Barnes' hands are on Tony, touching every part of him.
Why was his door unlocked? That wasn't good, but that didn't mean anything. Toni was here after all, and when she had an idea in her head, she tended to be forgetful. "Toni," he called out as he entered his apartment. "Toni?" he said a little bit louder. His eyes scanned the apartment, looking for any kind of movement. "Toni," he called one last time before giving up. She wasn't in the apartment that much he could tell, but he wasn't sure when she had left. He panicked for a second, worried that she left for New York before saying bye. However, that didn't last for long as he spotted her phone the night stand.
Gabe added, "I bet she knows a lot of people. Maybe, she can introduce Dum Dum to someone. That way he can stop harassing Nancy. Poor Nancy."
Letting out a smiling chuckle, Sharon sets the plate in front of Toni. "But hey, I look at it this way. I'm doing this to help someone. Doing this for the greater good. Not to look good."
Picking up the device, she reached for the screw driver. She was going to take it a part, because there was something wrong with it on the inside. She was ready to give up on it. "Highway to hell. I'm on the highway to hell." Taking off the metal covering, she stared at the wires.
Tony snaps back to reality, popping up. "Rhodey," he replies, not hearing his best friend enter. He wonders briefly if FRIDAY had alerted him, and he just missed it as his mind is on other things. "Dum-E, no." Tony yells, turning around in his chair. "Stand down." Though he knows, he shouldn't laugh, but the genius can't help but smile at the scene in front of him. The bot is chasing Jim around the lab with the fire extinguisher in its metal arm. "That's not the proper use of a fire extinguisher! Down boy. Down." He let out a smiling chuckle. "Don't make me give you away to a locate college."
"Cut off one head, two more shall take its place." Dr. Arnim Zola uttered, his voice completely computerized. It was unnerving.
"No. No, I don't." It didn't take a genius to know why Salty didn't need the answer. "Against my better judgment, I'll let you go, Stark." He paused "You're going to kill me, you know that?"
Steve was never one for long explanations, but Barnes expected something more from him. "Did it hurt?" He wasn't sure what else to say.
It felt strange to be here, even if this place was her home. It was also weird to see all of the bright colors and moving signs after being trapped in the 40's for so long. It was bizarre to see how differently people dressed and acted. Granted, she grew up and created the technology around them, it was strange to be around it again after being stuck in the past for so long, but it felt nice being back, even if she felt out of place. "Oh, you're pulling that card?" she asked, laughing hard. "Never thought you would do that,
Steve, who knew he had to, had no interest. He wanted to break down every door until he had Toni in his hands. He wanted to rip apart everyone who had ever looked at Toni funny. He wanted to run Rumlow through with his shield, before turning his attention to Rollin. He wanted to rip apart the man who dared to put on Bucky's face, for destroy the memory of his best friend. For the first time in a long time, he wanted to kill someone. He wanted to let his anger take over him. He wanted to- No, he couldn't let himself go down this path. Toni needed his head in check. He needed to levelheaded to save her. "I know," he said through his teeth.
"Still not getting into my pants, Private," Toni stated, as she folded her arms across her chest. She gave him the famous you-are-an-idiot glance, which Future Rogers hated. "You got to at least buy me dinner first, but I ain't a cheap date."
She was holding back the tears as she reached her breaking point. There wasn't anything else that she could do but sit there, and it was that realization that hit hard. There was some part of her that thought this was her fault, and there was another part of her that thought she deserved this. She let Barnes die without even trying to save him. What kind of person did that? A selfish person. There was no denying that she was a selfish person not caring about anyone else.
Toni fought back her chuckle at finally annoying him, knowing it would be a bad idea. "Technology is not as good as it should be. Is it really hard to believe that you cannot find record of me?"
Toni knew when she was trapped in a corner. Setting the gun on the floor, she turned to face Salty fully.
She recalled the 'look' in both of her mother and father's eyes. She reminisced how she could look at the two of them and get this visceral feeling deep in her gut. It was this overwhelming heat in her chest, realizing the strength of it. There was no doubt they loved each other. No doubt they would go to the end of the earth for the other. They would die for the other. Grasping how intense that could be, Toni recognized the fear that leaked in. The fear of losing someone so special was gut-wrenching, and the fear was genuine. When her mother died, she saw how
"No," he says softly. He's right. That relationship isn't going work with him, not when he's an ass with an ego the size of the moon. It was right to end it before anyone got hurt, not that he isn't hurting. It feels like someone has ripped out his heart and stepped on it. "What is your assessment of my mental state, FRIDAY?" he asks, softly.
Years after killing the familiar man and stealing his photo, the Asset wasn't sure of anything besides the countless bodies that he had dropped. Time meant nothing as it flew by, and all of those deaths meant nothing. Even after the chair, he remembered and only cared about that picture. Nothing mattered, besides that picture, even if he had no idea of why. That picture of the unknown woman meant everything to him, even if he knew nothing about her. That picture was the most important thing he owned, even if he could no longer remember where he got it from.
She felt his hands drop and him dodge. "Hey!" he yelled. Opening her eyes, she throw another punch at him and he was able to dodge that too. "What the hell?"
"I understand," Steve replied, resigned to agree. It would be pointless to fight as it was clear they couldn't change their minds. "When do we head out?"
Toni knew he wanted to lecture her, to yell at her, but she was glad he wasn't. She couldn't take it, not now. Not when she was flashing back to the nightmares. She just wanted to stay in his arms and hide from the world. "You know it, Cap." She said, her voice still shaky. She felt so weak.
With a trouble expression on her hand, Toni didn't take the card, only stared. "I'm not a soldier," she said, shortly. She didn't serve…Wait, did she? Fucken time travel. Yes, she was given a rank in the Army when she traveled back in time. She was given assignments. She was sent into the field during WW2, but she did
"I want to talk," she stated, ignoring the looks from the other officers in the hallway. She felt herself falter again, but this time, she was unable to stop herself and she fell forward. She put her arms out, ready to brace herself, but she found herself in a pair of arms. Toni glanced up at her savior and smiled as innocently as she could. "My hero."
However, there was a problem with that. She knew well enough that the Colonel Phillips wasn't going to allow her to take the Tesseract off base or even use it, but she would have to try. If he did, she had to find a place that was stable enough to withstand the waves. But first, she needed her device.
Toni can see Peggy wanted to say something, but she was refraining. Unlike her, Agent Carter could keep silence and listen, even if she didn't want to.
Toni glanced back toward Barnes, who was a few feet behind. He was giving her his stupid smile as if she needed it, which she didn't. "So I can clock you again?" she asked, still wearing her glare.
They didn't stink up house, making everything smell like pine. God, she hated that smell…Was she un-Christmas if she hated that smell?
In growing fear, she shakily tried to move her arms, but they were tied securely behind her and there was no wiggle in the chains. The only thing Toni could do was lift her head to look around the room, but she couldn't make anything out but fuzzy shapes. It was, however, painfully quiet in the room and the only thing she could hear was the pounding of her own heart in her ear.
Toni didn't watch as they left, but she felt their judging eyes on her. She could guess what they were thinking and it wasn't something that she would like. After hearing the flaps close, she spoke, "What can I help you with, Salty?"
The genius almost flinched at the voice, as the chair was suddenly removed from her leg. "What?" she asked, as the blood went rushing back to her legs. Her legs were tingling and it was almost painful. As if on their own, her eyes wandered back to the spot where the Bucky Lookalike stood, and she could feel the urge to go after him, though he knew it was completely stupid. If she did go after the stranger, it would prove that she was crazy, which she was not. Could not be! Damn it all and her fucking legs.
"Thanks," Toni stated, not expecting Nick to do that. She exited the shop with a smile on her face. Walking outside, she took a look around just to make sure she wasn't being followed. She hadn't seen her stalker, the guy who had been tailing her since the diner, in the last few days and that had her worried. Did he already have what he wanted? Did she scare him off? Or worse, was he still watching her and she not know it? That freaked her every time she thought about it and she hated that feeling.
However, seeing Peggy pull Steve back and give him a kiss wasn't what Toni was looking for, and she would not admit it that she felt relieved when Steve pulled away quickly. Why did Peggy think it was necessary to kiss him? Was she afraid that Steve wasn't coming back? There were some doubt in Toni's mind, but she wasn't going to think about that. She was going to be her cocky self, who believed in the awesome power of herself.
"Sure, we can," she answered, as she tried to think of some ways that she could get his confidence up. She couldn't get over how different he was from the present day Rogers. "Let me think of something I can be." She stood up and put her hand to her head to think. "I got it. You really?"
"Are you going to be around for that?" Barnes asks. "Or are you going disappear again? It might be safer if I ask someone else." His eyes are drilling into him. "Not some indecisive jerk, who doesn't know what he's doing."
"Toni," he said, his voice firm. Bruce was never one to buy her bullshit, but he was never one to call her on it in most cases. "I know something happened, beyond simple time travel."
The Asset's hands balled at his side, ready to fight, as the familiar man took the woman into his arms and kissed her. He was to about snap and hunt this man down, as she was
Even in his death, Jarvis had meaning and influence in her life unlike any other person. Sure, she had people in her life, but there was no one compared to JARVIS, which was why this was hitting her so hard. The AI felt so far away, and it left her feeling exposed. It made her feel like she was out in the open, waiting to be attacked. Waiting to be beaten into the ground. With JARVIS, he protected her, kept her sane when everything else failed. He kept her straight.
Did he really consider this a better mood? He must be crazy, though she had to admit that she less snappy than before. "Don't make me beat you," she threatened. It was a buff really; as the last two times she dealt with him, she was saved by Barnes who wasn't in camp at the moment. That also annoyed her as she was
After obtaining her device, she laid it out in front of her. She stared at it for a second, wondering. Should she do it here? Take it somewhere else? If it was anything like the last time, it would attract a lot of attention, and she couldn't allow that.
Steve, fighting his negative thoughts, didn't look at the file until he had gotten back to his small messy apartment. He usually was very organized as messes weren't tolerated in the army, but he couldn't find the urge to clean up the tossed files on the floor. Those files were painful reminders to something that he had lost to the hands of time. It weighted heavily on his mind that he was the alone, which was probably why he was pushing so hard to find Toni.
He shook his head, because this couldn't have been a coincidence. There was no way that Howard would have known his daughter would look exactly like Toni.
Toni glanced at him with an eye brow raised. If she didn't know better, she would think he was jealous, but why in the hell would he be jealous? He had a thing for Peggy, didn't he? And if he didn't, she was surely not his type. Shaking her head, she had to be wrong. Maybe, he was just being protective, knowing Barnes. "Nothing. He was just bugging me about a nickname."
Toni's eyes widened before she buried her face in his chest. "Steve," she cried. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean it."
When Toni came across Howard, he was alone in the science station, working hard as he always did when it came down to it.
This is why he spends much of his time in the lab, so no one will learn the truth. He doesn't need them to know that he has a crush—No, not a crush. He's not a teenager girl. He doesn't get and have crushes. He's grown ass man for crying out loud, though he isn't sure what to call
"It would also be wise if you stop trying to get me in your bed. There's no chance in hell that I would sleep with you and there's no way that I would take your deal," she said, getting angrier with each second. She balled her hands yet again as she tried to calm herself.
Toni took a deep breath, fighting back the tears, before she turned away. It was oddly quiet as it seemed like she was the only one visiting this section of the cemetery. It was strangely cold, though Toni had no idea of what the exact date it was as she hadn't bothered to look before she left. She just needed to get out, and this was the only place she could think of going. However, the silence wasn't her friend, as it was when her nastiest thoughts came out, and with everything that happened, it was so much worse. Her guilt was eating her alive.
"Howard did. Back in the lab before you vanished, Toni jokingly told him that, but he didn't figure it out after you disappeared. However, we didn't find out until after she was born and we wondered why he named his daughter after Toni," he said. He tried to laugh but it came out as a cough. "He puffed out his chest like a proud father and gloated that his daughter would invent time travel."
"Hey, Salty! What's up?" Toni asked as she hopped to him. She didn't know what it was, but she was happy to see the Colonel, who was a thrill to tease.
Toni's head was spinning and she had no idea of where she was or what was going on. All she knew was that she was tied to a chair, unable to move, and the ropes and handcuffs were digging into her. It was hard to breath, but that wasn't what worried her. What worried her was the last thing she could recall, which was Barnes being ambushed by hydra Soldiers. She had tried to help him, but she was grabbed from behind, and no matter what she did, she couldn't break free. Before the man had knocked her out, she watched as Barnes was taken to the ground unable to fight the men off. She had no idea what happened after that. He could be seriously hurt or worse dead, but she did know that if one of those asshole hydra soldier hurt him, she was going to beat their asses.
Barton sighed. "I get it. It was funny to see Rhodes huff it back to the Quinjet, but it could've been deadly. Sure, no one likes Rhodes, but geez, trying to kill him? That's a bit much."
"You don't know me very well, do you? I'm Toni Stark. I don't know how to shut up to save my life. Why don't you shut up like the hissy that you are?!" she replied, eyeing the steering wheel. Though her mind still felt like it in a fog, it was still spinning. How hard would it be to yank the wheel from him? "I'm tired of this game. You are-"
Toni's legs felt like jelly beneath her, and she was to stay to her feet for the time being, but she knew she wouldn't be able to stand for long. "Time travel doesn't exist."
Though Toni was worried about Rogers as it seemed that Hydra knew about the future attack, it was a relief to be referred to as Sark. It meant that Schmidt did not know who she was, though it all could be a trick. "You know if he haven't been kicking your ass, I might believe you."
But, he knew that she wasn't dead. She was too stubborn to die. Too stupid to give up. However, being on an Intel mission, he had been watching the mansion for hours and knew all of the happenings around the house. He could see the enemy helicopter approach on the beach mansion from miles away, and if he had a weapon capable of taking it down, he would have. He would have done anything to save her from any kind of pain, including killing, and that was something that he especially would not let his handlers know. He would killing anyone, which included killing his handlers, and he was willing to risk the chair for her—though he still didn't know why.
For the eleventh time, the Soldier's eyes scanned the room, while keeping an ear to the hallway even if Rollins was watching the hallways, not that they expected anyone at this hour. The Senator, the two S.T.R.I.K.E., and the Asset were the only people in the building, well besides the guards on ground floor. However, there was no chance that the guards could save the Senator. Not one guard had seen the trio enter the building, and when the time came, no one would see them leave either. The three of them, especially the Asset, could enter any building without anyone noticing.
After he was thawed, his brain didn't snap back right away and his dreams took a few days (or what felt like days) to return. There was no real way to tell when his mind snapped back to his body and when he began to feel once again, but it all came back to him. His dreams were not of Agent Peggy Carter, the one of three women he had ever been kissed by and the last woman he had kissed. When his dreams came back, they were of Corporal Toni Sark, a woman he had kissed once, a woman he didn't know a lot about; however, he was completely in love with her.
him. Their looks compliment the other, and even, their personalities are a good match. They're the perfect fit for the other as they balance the other, and that balance doesn't include Tony. He sees it now, and he'll only hurt this perfect couple if he stays—not that he can. He, Tony Stark, is a completely asshole, who cares for no one but himself unlike these two. Just look at them. They save cats from trees while he just laughs. "I'm fine," he says, unsure what else to say. What can he say to Bucky?
"After I got over the shock that you liked Toni, I couldn't help but notice all of the signs, and let me tell you, your unrequited loved is cute and a bit sad. You're like a puppy." He paused to laugh at Steve's red face. "Natasha, Clint, and I are taking bet to when you snap and shove Toni against a wall and kiss her."
Rogers smiled as he squeezed her arm lightly. "If I'm the Cowboy, what does that make you?" he asked as he pushed himself to his feet.
." She had no idea of where this woman's strength came from as no one was this strong normally. It was
Though Steve understood why they wanted it quiet, he couldn't understand why that was startling or what that would have to do with the suit. People were going to notice as Toni was hard not to miss, but why did it matter? It wouldn't change anything. It wasn't like there was a ransom or anything for her. She was in the past, though they wouldn't want that out. "Why the suit?"
Tony is fully aware of what Steve is implying, and he's all for it, even if this wasn't the plan when Rhodes had pulled him out of his labs…Okay, maybe, this is too soon after everything that had happened. The Brooklyn Boys still abandoned him for a week, though he now understands why. Bucky's night terrors are nothing to joke about, and they need to be taken seriously, but Tony does to as well. However, they know this. They know everything.
Romanoff eyed him before turning toward the door. With her hand on the door's handle, she glanced back at him. "We can't have you pretending to be fine, Rogers. If you can't operate, then you will need to sit out."
"It wasn't," she countered. "And besides, you had already made up for it… Dad." The word felt weird on her tongue, but the look on her father's face was priceless.
And Again, I hoped you liked it! Hint hint. You can tell me how you feel in the reviews. Reviews are like candy that keep me going and writing move. This story has been a ride, and I hoped it wasn't too boring. I hoped you had fun reading this. I know i enjoyed writing it.
"You do not speak," Schmidt said as he stepped toward. "You have nothing to fear, Corporal Sark, well as long as you tell me what I want to know. I promise I will not hurt you."
thoughts out of his head, and he will, even if he has to take a hammer to his face. He needs to move on,
"Oh, god," Peggy uttered, pretending to be scared. "That's scary. You will definitely need your Aunt Peggy."
With a smile, Bruce leaned forward in his chair and took a deep breath. "The three of us made a bet of when you would snap and reveal your love to Toni. Clint had already lost. He thought you would've done it when you saw that centerfold of Toni. He was being overdramatic for a reason."
Steve turned to him and replied a little too fast, "I'm happy, well happy as I can be with Stark missing."
She returned his look with one of her own. "No, you don't, but you don't need to worry. There's nothing going on with Barnes and Me." Toni would make sure of that. Salty was correct: she didn't need that relationship. "And Rogers and I are just friends. In fact, I'm trying to play match maker with him and Agent Carter."
Natasha's elevated voice cut through Steve's thoughts and the jet as her voice risen two folds. "How did you get this frequency?" she asked, clearly annoyed. "This is a secured SHIELD channel. How did you get the authorization?" The assassin's voice was firm and smooth, refusing let her annoyance show.
When they were within a quarter of a mile of the base, the group separated into three groups. Dugan, Jones, Dernier, and an unnamed soldier were in the first group. Rogers, Folsworth, Morita and a second additional soldier made up the second team. In the third group was just Toni and Barnes, who were going to stay back until they received the all clear signal. It would be easier for them to sneak pass the guards, if they were distracted by Rogers and the rest of gang.
Rogers, with an unreadable look in his eyes, tossed the folder back to Phillips. "I think…" He drifted off.
She knew Pepper was going to do this, but she didn't expect it out of Rogers… Okay, she did expect it from him, as he thought he would fix everything, which included her. Even with all of their fights, he thought she was something he needed to fix. "What do they want?"
"I thought there would be no future talk?" He sighed as Toni glared at him, which was her response to his question. "What if you're captured?" He eyed her. "Regardless of gender, anyone will fold under continuous torture." He stood up and crossed to one of the flaps as if he was going to leave. "I doubt that my own men could keep silent under harsh torture. How could you?" he asked as he motioned to the officers outside of his tent. "I cannot allow future knowledge to fall in Schmidt's hand."
Steve just needed to find her, and he needed to find her before she did something stupid—though it could be too late. For a genius, she was pretty stupid at times, acting before thinking, which was pretty normal for her. However, Steve knew why she did this, and for that, he loved her. She had the biggest heart that he had ever seen before, though she would never admit it. She put up this wall, pretending to be cold hearted, but she had a heart of gold, making sure everyone was safe and okay.
While kneeling in the cold mud, Steve mindlessly looking through the wreckage, but he wasn't really looking for anything. His mind was on Toni, not on the scene in front of him. After finding the single piece from the Iron Man's hand blaster, it meant she was here, but it also meant she was in a fight, which didn't sit well with him. It meant Toni had dug herself a hole, and Steve had no doubt the Mandarin would strike while she was down. They would see it as a challenge. "Barton," he said, placing a gentle warning in his voice. "Not now."
"He isn't happy about a lot of things," Steve muttered, sighing. They hadn't talked much since the night Toni had disappeared, and it wasn't because they were worried about the lost genius. Hawkeye and Captain America worked well together in the field, but off the field, their two different attitudes didn't match well together.
Pepper turned, glaring as she was sick of hearing that. She hated the idea of giving Toni space, because that woman did stupid things when given space.
The assassin gives him a look. "Wanda's idea," she says. "She thought you'll be comfortable in here. She seems to care about you… well, for the moment."
Just as he turns to go upstairs, he spots an empty plate on one of the work benches. His heart beats rapidly as his chest feels tighten at the sight of it. "He didn't come down today," he utters. The dish is from yesterday when Barnes came down with a plate of Chicken Penne. He isn't sure why it stings so much that he didn't come down today, but he knows it's for a best. He doesn't need to get attached to Barnes, not that he isn't already. That Stupid Soldier fought his way into his damn heart to join Rogers, and that annoys him. He isn't some teenager who falls in lo—nope not love. He does not love, but he isn't some person who falls for someone simply because he or she takes care of him.
Toni narrowed her eyes at him. "Have you seen him?" She had no interest of correcting him, as she really didn't care what he thought.
Before she could dial or ever light the screen up, Rollins ripped it out of her hands and tossed it at the back of the car. "You won't be needing that for what we have planned." The smile on his face was a mixture of creepy and more creepy. It was like he couldn't chose between a smile and a glare, as he looked at her. "So, shut up or I will make you shut up."
Not giving him a chance, Toni leaned toward him, grabbing onto his arm—not that there was any away he could escape from her unless he jumped through the glass. They were in the corner of the diner. "I'm stuck to you like glue."
"Leave him alone," Toni ordered, marching into the room. She was ready to call for Suit if needed. "You've gone crazy, Romanoff."
"I won't do it," she protested, kicking the blankets off of her. She was tossing and turning wildly. "Stop it. Just stop it, please." Her voice was weak. "…Please."
"I don't know anything about that," Toni said, smiling faintly. "It would do no good to talk about it." She didn't want to talk about it as she didn't want to relive it. "I have nothing to talk about." She stared off into space.
"Yea, we thought it was Barnes' night with him and you didn't want to impose," Natasha says, while shrugging. "And we kept seeing Steve carrying you to bed with that stupid look in his eyes."
Okay, that did it. That took his very breath away, though it didn't curb the happiness bubbling through him. "Toni," he utters.
But he's angry at himself for being a damn fool. He's idiot and he knows it. He hates the idea of love and here he is, falling for two—not one, but two—guys he can't have. Again, he's an idiot and he knows it. He knows he's fucking screwed, but what's a guy supposed to do? Tony isn't sure, but he is tired of this. Tired of his emotions. Tired of how they attacked him. He isn't supposed to fall for them. He isn't a teenager with uncontrollable urges, damn it.
"Let's see them," Toni stated as she turned back to Gabel and the game. "Maybe, if you win, I might call you by your first name." She winked at him.
"So are you going to talk about it?" he asked as he took a seat on the chair next to the couch. His eyes flecked to the broken down phone on the table, and from his spot, he could see some of the pieces were burnt. He didn't ask though.
He glanced up at the monitors before he pushed the hair out of her face. "I'll be back. Can't leave you after that kiss," he stated, smiling. "I have to go," he said as he kissed her again.
His hand dropped to his side, as he took a step back. His eyes narrowed as she refused his help and used the wall for support. For a few seconds, he watched her slowly get the feeling back in her legs. "I was hoping to speak with Pepper."
She looked down for a second before looking back up. "You'll have to deal with my mood swings, and…negativity," she added, slowly. He could sense her hesitation as she spoke. He could hear the tones in her voice change.
Steve wanted to say they didn't want time for a lot of things, but as he dripping wet, he had no interest in talking. He wanted to find Toni, and once he did, he wasn't going to let her out of his sight. And if someone tried to tell him she was dead, he was going to punch that person in the face.
"Well, it's the best explanation we can come up with for that thing being in your chest," he said with a smile. "I would love to be a robot myself."
Steve gave her a crooked smile as he put his arm around her, drawing her in. "I don't know about that. You look like walking death."
Though uncomfortable, Toni buried her face into the hard mattress, hiding herself in the blankets—worn from years of use. With a strong aroma, she couldn't help but flash back to Aunt Peggy, smelling the old spices the woman was known for. God, it was overwhelming. She missed the spunky woman Peggy used to be, not the shell she was now. Toni hated that she was being robbed of her time with Aunt Peg, and she
He knew this baseball game. "The game, it's from May 1941. I know because I was there." Steve replied sharply as he got to his feet. "Now, I'm gonna ask you again. Where am I?" He took a step toward her.
Shaking her head, Toni pushed herself up by her elbows. Even with the rest, she could feel her worn-out body fight her. Her body shock, but she pushed through them. She needed to figure out where she was and what was going on. She also needed to check her reactor to make sure it was working properly, though if it wasn't she would be dead.
"Yes, soundly, I might add." Bucky hadn't heard anything from her, which didn't mean she wasn't having nightmare. He really couldn't tell unless she made a noise or something. He had checked on her randomly to see how she was doing, and everything seemed okay.
The genius was still having a difficult time putting things together. She wasn't sure of what was happening, besides the cold water running down her warm face.
"We know this," Barnes said, sounding exhausted, as he crossed to her, offering to help her to sofa. There was a bit of hesitation when he offered his arm, but she let him help her without a protest. "We know this all too well. Right, Steve?" There was a hint of amusement when he spoke.
Schmidt turned to Captain America. "Why do you care so much for her? I doubt she cares as much for you as you do for her. She's probably using you like the fool that you are." He stepped closer to Rogers.
Fighting back her wild imagination, Toni's eyes widened as she turned back to the window on a dime, telling herself that she was seeing things. It was all in her head, and when she looked back, this was confirmed as she found herself looking out into angry ocean. Nothing more. Nothing less. "JARVIS," she called out trembling. The man seemed so real. "Scan the surrounding area. I want confirmation there's nothing out there." Toni stared out the window, looking for anything suspicious. She couldn't have imagine that, could she?
In her bag, she had the t-shirt and jeans she came in from the future, and though it did not fit the time, it would keep her warmer than she was. She took out the articles and laid them on the couch. Without taking off the nurse's uniform (an annoying dress), she went to put her jeans, but she didn't know where to begin. She got down on the floor and laid out her jeans in front of her. Using one leg to hold down the pants, she slid the other leg in. After she had one leg in a little bit, she put the other one in. "How am I going to pull them up?" she whispered to herself.
Bruce got to his feet and stepped toward them. "You better give them to him, Toni, or else we might find something in the air ducks. It probably won't be pretty."
She shook her head. "You better be careful or I'm going to give you a nickname that you don't want!" She stated as she jokingly punched him. She didn't back away from him as she stared into his eyes. There was something about his eyes that just pulled her in. "What ab-"
Toni glanced at him before looking away. "No. W-why am I here?" she asked, noticing an IV in her arm.
Nevertheless, thinking like a computer did help Toni whenever her emotions go wild. Even with an overthinking brain, logic was her friend and thinking like a computer helped. It also helped that Harley reminded her of who she was and what she did: she was a mechanic. She was a builder, a fixer. It also meant there was something to focus on, something to create, which was what she needed. She just needed a task.
The doctor eyed him and Steve wondered what was going through Banner's head. He didn't say anything for a few minutes as if he was trying to think of what to say. Banner took a deep breath. "I bet," he stated. His tone was soft, which surprised Steve. "It's me who should be sorry." He paused. "Time travel is such a tricky thing and there's no telling what she's doing and how she's changing the timeline. I can't even begin to understand what that feels like to have everything change on you."
The Super Soldier listened to him, getting angrier with each passing second but he refused to let it show as he had a mission to do even if it was his fault. They should have let it in the ocean, but it was too late now and he had to stop it before it did any more damage.
Tony huffs in annoyances as he rubs the back of his head. The pain medication is wearing off, and it's making him grumpy, though it can be something else entirely. "Picking on me just like everyone else is. Geez, I feel loved."
Pepper tried to keep back her glare, because she knew she needed to calm down; however, it was so hard lately. She had been feeling out of the loop lately, and it was only made worse with Toni's disappearance. "I thought you three were looking for Captain Rogers," she asked. She kind of hated that the Captain right now.
Barnes raised his hand up as if in self-dense. "Geez, relax." He paused. "Let's talk about something else."
Rogers turned to her and he could see the worry in her eyes. "I'm fine," he replied. "My eye will heal on its own." He eyed her as she walked toward him. "This isn't the first time I got a black eye."
Having lost count to how many times she had heard his voice, it no longer surprised her. Instead, Toni let out a deep sigh, doing the same thing that she always did when she heard Barnes' voice. She ignored it, because it was one thing to hear voices. It was another thing to talk to them. That was a true sign that she was crazy if she started to have fights with herself- because that was what it really was. Bucky was dead; she was just hearing her own guilty. That was all.
The whiskey, not as good as she was used to, burned her throat on the way down, and it felt good. It numbed her system just like she wanted; it numbed her to the world. She hadn't had a drink in a while, and god, did she miss it! In the future, she could barely go a day without a drink, which was a serious issue; however, it wasn't an issue that she wanted to think or talk about. It… wasn't like she got drunk all of the time; she just enjoyed how it made her feel. She felt free with each passing second as her worries just seemed to disappear. Even her nightmares disappeared if only for a few hours.
She tried to jerk her arm away from him as she could feel her arm start to bruise, but she couldn't break free from his grab. "Why are you trying so hard?" she snapped. She was too exhausted to be friendly, not like she would've been friendly in the first place.
There was a chill in the room and the thin fugly sweater Toni was wearing wasn't keeping her warm. Her hair was standing up on her arms and she had the goose bumps up and down her body. She had tried to adjust the sweater, but she couldn't with a broken arm and the other handcuffed to table. She couldn't move her chair either as it was bolted to the ground, which annoyed her, but it didn't annoy her as much as them, the Colonel and company, their stupid tactics Sure, she was their prisoner, but they couldn't- wouldn't get under her skin. She was tougher than some cold room.
look at him. "If I wanted Barnes, I could have him without anyone playing cupid," she stated, sitting down.
This was the Rogers she could handle. Why couldn't the future one be this sweet and soft instead of the righteous asshole, who yelled at her for everything?
heart. As he was going down, there was only one person he wanted to talk to and it wasn't Peggy. His heart ached to talk to Toni but he couldn't and he knew it. It was the worst feeling in the world and at the last second before he hit the ice, he wondered if he had made the right choice in not pursuing her.
"I have to get ready for the next base," Steve said. He glanced at Toni before he turned to leave. His tone was hard.
Natasha smiles. "Not too hard to imagine. You aged well." Tony glares at her. "Well you do, and after Steve asked you out, we thought-"
With a look that could cut right through a person, Natasha's eyes narrowed, scanning the genius head to toe without saying one word. Clint, on the other hand, was all word, reminding Toni of herself when she was only running on 3 hours of sleep. "Toni! Look, Nat. It's Toni. So good to see you." His smile took up his entire face. A kid at Disney. "Wait, does that mean Rogers is in a good mood? Because, man! He has been a beast. A beast, I am telling you." He paused for a second. "He has to be, considering you're wearing his shirt. It means good things, right?" He gave her a wink. "You-"
"NO," Toni yelled. She couldn't- wouldn't talk to her, as Peggy wouldn't understand. Besides, Toni had no right to talk to her, after everything. "You-"
Never let anyone tell you that a Super Soldier didn't feel pain, because right now, he felt like he had been hit by a bus, a double decker. Considering he jumped from—he didn't recall how many floors—the elevator and plummeted to the ground floor below, he was doing quite well. He would have several nasty bruises in the morning, but he would live to tell the tale. Just being hurting.
Interrupting again, Howard stepped forward. "I think Colonel Phillips is getting annoyed," he said as he nodded toward Phillips who was still staring at them. "I do think it is time."
Rhodes looked at Toni for a few seconds, before getting to his feet. "Pepper," he called softly. "Slow down. Let's talk about this."
Clint was not happy. No, he was downright pissed; besides the fact that he felt left out of the 'let's kick everyone's ass' group, (Hello, Nat was
Narrowing his eyes, Steve pushed off the wall of the Quinnjet and turned to Natasha. "Is everything okay?" he asked, as fear creeped into his mind. There could only be one reason why Rhodes was calling: Toni.
With the sudden return of feeling to her body, Toni's brain was spinning, and she couldn't make out completely what he was saying. Was he even referring to her? She wasn't sure. She wasn't sure of anything besides her growing headache.
"Can't wait," Bucky says, stepping away from Steve and shifting Tony's weight completely to him. He's now holding him bridal style as he stares at him with a goofy smile. "Let's just get you to bed."
Rogers gave her the look of disapproval, which was normal for him. He was always giving her that look. "I see that bump to the head didn't affect you." Again, there was something in his tone that Toni couldn't place. It was like he was mad or something, though it could be because he was Captain America again. "Shouldn't you be resting?"
Bruce didn't push. "Toni is hard headed and this would've happened with or without you. She had been pushing herself to the breaking point before she met us and she'll be doing it after we leave."
Jim Morita let out a chuckling sigh. "We're getting our butts kicked. Who taught you how to play?" He glanced at her before staring at his cards. After a sigh, he placed the cards on the table.
Schmidt glanced toward Barnes. "He fancies her as well. He might steal her from you, Captain. How do you feel about that?" he asked as he turned to the door.
When she caught up to the super soldier, he was at a long window, which overlooked the city, in her bedroom. The room itself was dark with the light of moon (and city lights) providing the only light. Barely able to make him out in the darkness, she stared at the back of him for a second before she crossed to him. There was a glare- a playful glare- in her eyes as she stomped to him. "You!" She yelled; however, it died in her throat. When she got to him, she noticed he had rotated and was on his knee…on one knee. Her playful anger froze as she looked at him. Shock took over.
Listening to Peggy as she spoke to Steve was heartbreaking, and Toni didn't know how she held back the tears. To hear Steve sound so broken was almost too much for Toni, who didn't understand why this was so hard. Her heart felt like it was about to break and shatter. She knew that Steve wasn't going to die, and he would be back, but it felt like he was dying. It felt like the end.
"What? It can't be a good sign that she hasn't given him an answer," Barton replied, fire off another arrow. "I am just trying to be helpful."
"You're just saying that," Tony says softly. "You don't mean it." Maybe, he needs to be fighting to get out of their arms.
The genius glances toward the warm hand on his shoulder before looking up at Rhodes' face, and he hesitates for a second before he sets down his tools. He can see the worry and concern in his best friend's eyes, and he finds it hard to tell him no. Besides, Jim knows him well, and he will call any buff that Tony tries. "And do what?" he asks, tiredly.
However, that isn't the only reason why he cares deeply for those two. He adores their laughs, the tones in their voices, and he finds himself doing things to make them smile and laugh without even realizing it. Stupid things. Really stupid things that he had never thought he would be doing. He, in fact, had made a rule way back when that when he started dating to never do these things, but here is he doing them… Maybe, that's what his father meant, but Tony doesn't want to look at it like that. He doesn't want to see it as them controlling him. He wants to see it something more, because it has to be if it makes him feel like
Toni crossed back to the device and loaded it into the suitcase just as the door to the small lab opened. "Stark," she greeted as she glanced up. She was getting him her famous glare.
Pierce reached into his pocket and pulled out a rectangle, folded paper. Judging the worn edges and shiny paper, it was a photo, an old photo, though the image wasn't visible from any angle. "She's be more willing to bend and fold to the will of Hydra."
Loki kicked his feet over the cot and stood up slowly. "Have you thought about my offer?" he asked as he stepped toward Toni. He looked the same as he did when he appeared to her in the cell, but his skin looked paler. If Toni didn't hate him, she would ask about it. "It would be wise to accept."
This is unbeta so forgive me for my sins. I had sent a copy to my beta, but we seemed to keep missing each other. So when she gets the chapter back to me, I will post the updated Chapter.
Sitting there in silence after placing the device down, Toni placed her forehead against the cold metal table for a few minutes. She knew she should get up and get something to eat, because Pepper was right. She needed food. She needed to eat. She was hurting herself by not eating but it wasn't like she was doing it on purpose. She was just busy.
However, this time, he couldn't help but wonder, as this wasn't anything like his normal missions. Unlike the others, he wasn't allowed to kill or torture this target, which was somewhat annoying. He was ordered to watch his target, only to watch, and strangely enough, he was ordered to allow her to see him, though not to interact with her. For once, he was supposed to allow his target to notice his presence, though the Asset had no idea as of why. What purpose would it serve to allow his target to see him? Would that do more harm than good for her to see him?
"Steve's the dog in this relationship!" Clint yelled, earning a glare from everyone in the room. "What? He is. He follows her around like a lost puppy."
"Really that's your worst nightmare?" she asked. "…Okay, that's pretty scare. Who wants to be the man?"
She could feel the Captain's breath. "The man you knew maybe, but he isn't the man I knew." She looked down, not wanting to see his eyes. Toni didn't want to speak to him, but somehow he had gotten her to come out of her lab, when she didn't want out. She didn't want to think about what that meant. "Please just leave me alone. I don't want to talk about him with you, especially you."
"Because I realized that I don't know you, not really. Why were you in that lot? Did you ever get your memory back? Did you really have memory lost in the first place? Why are you here, fighting in this war?" he asked. "What happened to you to make you close out the world? And I know that this isn't about Bucky."
"You gotta share, Punk," Bucky says as he turns Tony to face him. Before Tony or Steve can say anything, Bucky's kissing him, and he's kissing him hard. He doesn't gives Tony time to think as he takes control. It's a wet kiss as Barnes leaves nothing on the table. It's clear that he wants say it all through the kiss.
"Toni," Maya uttered. Her tone was unnerving, and no one knew what to make of the growing softness in her tone
But with Barnes, it seems like he wants Tony to like him, though Tony has no idea why this is so important. Why does it matters? What does it change? What good does it do? Again, Tony isn't sure, but Barnes is, which is why he keeps coming down to the lab. He remembers the first time the former assassin came down to see him. He didn't say one single word the whole entire time. He just dropped the food off, stared at Tony for a few seconds like he had wanted to say something but couldn't, and left without a word.
Tears were running down her face, as she fought against the hands, holding her in a warm embrace. "Please, no," she begged, seeing the shadow's death.
"Take away Rhodes access immediately. I don't know why I gave it to him in the first place." Usually, she wouldn't be this upset at the thought of Rhodey in her suit, but right now, she was pissed. She needed it to escape before anyone could stop her. She knew she was being stupid, but she couldn't deal with her emotions. It felt like her father had died all over again. It felt like she had lost everything again.
Toni stared at herself in the mirror of the lady's room as Steve went to find them seats for the movie. She couldn't believe that she had slipped up. Taking a deep breath, she tried to shaking the feelings of utter failure. How could she be that stupid? If she didn't wise up, she was going out herself, which she couldn't have. After splashing water on her face, she walked out of the lady room and toward the theatre auditorium.
Toni wiggled in her seat, trying to get a better look of him. She couldn't see his gun, which would've been helpful right about now, but she spotted a knife on his belt. She eyed it for the few seconds before willing herself to grab it. Her hands were trembling as she reached forward, and it felt like someone had turned up the heat as she felt his hot breath against her face. Her heart was pounding as she wrapped her fingers around the handle. With a soft exhale, she puck it from him. She froze for a second, waiting to see if the man would wake. When he didn't, Toni leaned back in her seat and went to work on the seatbelt.
"You even gave one to Schmidt, but not me," he whined, playing the hurt card with his hand on his chest.
The genius takes note of Cho's use of Tasha's first name, but he doesn't give it much thought at the moment. His pain is slowly coming back, working its way up his legs, and it's too becoming difficult to think, not that it isn't already. His brain won't stop, and he has already come up with ten ways that the Brooklyn Boys are going to break up with him. "When can I get out of this place?" he asks, putting on a pouty face.
Steve couldn't believe she was acting like this. "And you need to focus on the problem, Miss Stark," he said, coldly.
"I'm ending this," he says, turning slightly. He avoids looking at them in the eyes as he stares in their direction. "You two," he starts, waving mindlessly at them, "can do whatever you want but without me."
"Here," Clint said, drawing Steve's attention. He stood a few feet from the couple, holding a couple of towels. "And let me tell you, Stark likes to hide the towels. I felt like I was looking for the lost-"
She closed her eyes for a second as the cold air blasted her and she buried herself deeper into her father's chest. After readjusting herself to the cold, she thought about opening her eyes, but she couldn't. Her body wouldn't listen to her, no matter how hard she tried. She was too tired.
Pierce nodded with a deep sigh. "Fury's going to be a problem. Well, we already knew that, but we're going to have to take care of him sooner than later. He wants me to put a stop to Project insight. We can't allow that."
Trying to regain her breath, she took a deep breath and pushed herself up and onto her shaky legs. It was a battle to stay on her feet as her soaked clothes were almost impossible to stand in. Her hoodie probably gained 25 pounds or more alone in the heavy, cold rain, but she wasn't sure that she was willing to take it off and expose her arms and chest to the freezing rain. She already felt like a popsicle. What would she feel like next without it?
"O-oh, shit…Don't think my insurance covers that," he says, his voice cracking. It hurt to talk…well to do anything.
"Back to what we were talking about," the Colonel stated. "When the need calls for it, you'll have to wear the dress uniform which does have a skirt, but around the base, you can wear pants."
Toni stopped and exhaled slowly. "Does it matter?" She dug her hands into her pockets as she stared down at the ground. She didn't want to ask that question, even if she already knew the answer. It would be a no.
Natasha looked like she wanted to protest or say something. There was a clear struggle in her. Barton may have accepted that the matter had been closed, but Romanoff looked like she was ready to go to war.
"Toni," Steve uttered, automatically taking a step to her. He scanned her over, looking for some kind of clue to what had happen between Pepper and her. However, he didn't notice anything but the change of clothes. She was dressed in an old, worn-out, oversized MIT sweat shirt that was a dress on her. She looked so small in it that he wondered if it was ready hers; however, even in the old, discolored item, Steve still found her attractive.
Schmidt released Toni's tongue, dropped his arm, and backed slowly from her. "I thought I said I wanted to be left alone," he said coldly as he looked toward Madame Hydra, who had stepped in with quite a few hydra Soldiers.
"So they told you." She wasn't expecting that, though she didn't know what she was expecting. She took a deep breath, trying to relax.
Howard gave Peggy a look. "Crazy? It's not my fault that I have so many things to prepare for before my genius offspring is born."
Why did everyone say that about her? Did she have a certain face? She needed to fix that. And was it a bad thing that she thought things through? What was wrong with that? "Are you going to tell the Pirate about this?" she asked, pushing her self up into a sitting position. She kept the blanket tight around her, like a warm shield.
Rhodes let out a sigh. "She was mad when I borrowed the Mark 2. I hate see it when she finds out I took out the Mark 7."
Toni didn't know what or how to deal with what was going on in her head. Shaking her head, she glanced up from her spot at a lab table to her father, who was doing something with something. She hadn't spoken to him since that day in the lab, but she knew he was watching her like she was about to break. It annoyed her, but she didn't want to say anything as she wanted to avoid what had happened in the lab from repeating.
Natasha's eyes scanned through the codes on the monitor in front of her, looking for some kind of the hack. Even if she wasn't a computer expect, it only took her a few seconds to find the cause. "We're being hacked," she replied, coldly. "I'm looking for the hacker now."
As it was late, the tower was pretty quiet and empty beside a few security guards at the lower levels. Steve normally didn't mind the silence, but at the moment, it ate at him. With a deep breath, he started to hum as he tried to block out the silence. With the humming keeping his pace even, he made it to the kitchen in little time. Not feeling like cooking anything at the moment, he decided to make a sandwich, as it was something simple that he could do without much thought process. It was very hard to mess up a sandwich, though in his current state Steve just might; however, he was able to manage it.
Snapping back to reality, Steve suddenly turned from the door and faced this three teammates. "What are you three talking about?" he asked, having not paid any attention to them.
Worst of all, her panic had started to disappear, and she started to forget why she was scared in the first place. Why was she fighting if her pain was gone? She was free and was no longer scared, so why was she fighting? If she just let go, she would be able to rest. She would be freed of the worry and stress of being alive…wait, why was she feeling this way? She shouldn't be feeling like this. She should be fighting…but she didn't have the urge to. Why? Because she was… Wait, what was her name? She couldn't remember. Why was she here? The last thing she-
The Private hobbled behind her; his left eye was slowly turning black. "She doesn't need you," he teased.
Rogers popped up into a sitting position frustrated. How could he sleep when all he saw was pain? He didn't know how it was possible to sleep when his past life kept haunting him. It wasn't just about his memories of Toni; it was about Bucky, whose death still haunted him. It was about everything. He saw everything. He wasn't sure why he couldn't get rid of them.
"I respect a lady's wishes," the doctor stated as he turned back to her. "You did ask me to leave. I will not impose myself on you."
That wasn't what she wanted. "I'm Howard Stark's daughter and he's a part of the project. I know because he knows. He had told me about it."
"Who?" he asked, holding her closer. Toni didn't answer, only stared at her hands. "It's okay. I got you." He rocked her.
He shushed her softly as he continued to rock her. "It's okay. I'm not going anyway, Doll Face." There was no way in hell that he was leaving Toni's side for the foreseeable future. Sure, he would have to leave her side at some point as he was Captain America, but that would have to wait a few weeks. Not leaving her now. Not her guilt. "I promise you that."
It had always annoyed her that she was treated differently than men. "Let me tell you, I hate when people treat me with kid gloves. I'm just as good as any guy." She fought the urge to hit him, which she couldn't do any ways.
That took Toni's breath away because there were no bright colors or no flashes ads like in her time. She felt so out of place in this city, because it looked nothing like her New York. Was this how Rogers felt when he realized that he wasn't in his New York and he was asleep for 70 years? Did he feel alone and that he didn't belong? Was he still feeling that? Toni never really thought about what he was feeling or how it was like to lose everything that she ever cared about. She knew Peggy was still alive in her time, but he wasn't going to contact her. He was too much of a gentleman and he was going to allow her to die in peace.
"Loki? Seriously?" he snapped as he slammed the bottle down, shattering it. The alcohol splashed, covering him, but he paid no attention to that. He was too pissed to care. "He almost destroyed New York and we're turning to him?" He didn't want that psychopath near Toni, especially when she was defenseless.
"Well since you offered," Loki started, stepping toward the glass wall. "I think I saw a magazine with a certain dark headed brunette. Why don't you get that for me? I enjoy her sassiness."
watching him. Is he channeling a dinosaurs? "I don't think that's something you should be proud of." He wants to enjoy this banter, but he just—
Toni could feel her heart race as she didn't know if she could handle this right now, not now. Granted she knew Steve and her father were right about her guilt; it was still a struggle, a struggle not to hate herself. And with her emotions all over the map, she wasn't sure that she could deal with people, not a crowd of them anyhow. "So this is what happens when I leave? Geez, People. Geez."
Natasha makes a face as she moves toward the empty spot on the sofa next to Tony. "What about a movie without aliens who want to enslave the planet? I had my fill of aliens in my life time," she says, honestly as she eyes the empty spot. There's a smile on her face as she inches over to it.
"You don't want to see me win, Steve?" Toni asked. "It might knock these fellas off down a few pegs." There was something up with him, and it annoyed her slightly. She couldn't deal with his moods; it was like he was a woman on her period.
Toni snorted as she folded her arms across her chest. "A warning would've been nice. What kind of team members are you?" she asked, pretending to be hurt. "Can't trust anyone, can I?" There was playfulness in her tone that wasn't here when they got off the elevator.
As they approached him, his mind kicked into full gear, and they would need more than just two soldiers to stop him.
Shaking her head, she noticed a newspaper on the table. "Great, now I can see what year this is." She picked up the paper, but she didn't look at it. Underneath the newspaper was a white letter like paper. She knew she shouldn't look at it as it wasn't her business but she couldn't help it. She never could mind her own business, which she was yelled at constantly about.
Howard crossed to her, and ever so slowly, kneed in front of her. With a smile, he placed a gentle hand on her knee, like any father would to comfort a child. "Oh, but we aren't. We couldn't leave you. We love you." There was something just behind his eyes that stuck the genius. "We need you like you need us."
Forcing her eyes open, she was startled to see Barnes, who was looking at her with a deep concern. "What the hell?" she yelled as she pushed him off. "What are you doing here?" she asked, trying to play it off. Nightmares weren't anything really as they were something that she could deal with. Besides, another rule of hers was not to show weakness. Having nightmares were a sign of weakness.
Bruce chuckled as Pepper gave Barton a look. When did Toni and Steve become the mother and father of this group? She wasn't sure how good those two would be together, though he might give Toni something to hold on to. He could ground her, which was what she needed, but Pepper was scared that he might do the opposite. He could end up destroying her.
"That would intent you coming to DC, Miss. We all know how you feel about the city. And a body would only limit me."
Fury turned back, giving him a look. "I thought you would be more agreeable as Stark finally said yes."
"I'll stay if you stop asking and if you tell Rogers about your enlistment," she said, poking the beast.
Toni turned to see Rogers who had a curious look in his eyes. She wasn't sure how long he was standing there, watching her with that look. The shrimp Rogers was much quieter in his movements than the giant Captain Rogers. He had been able to sneak up on her a few times already, which irritated her. Shaking her head, she took a deep breath as everything he did seemed to annoy her. She knew he was trying his best to get her to like him, and if she didn't know the future Rogers, she would like him, but she can't get the future asshole out of her mind. However, if he knew her, he wouldn't care if she liked him. He wasn't the only asshole; she was one too but bigger. "It's fine," she stated as she waved him off.
She picked up the wrench and pointed it at him. "Don't make me kill you," she stated, knowing that she could never really kill him with him being her father and all.
Even in her tired status, Toni felt herself twitch. Why were they under the impression that she belonged to Rogers? That they belong together? There was nothing between Rogers and her besides pain, pain that she had caused. It was all that she did. She was the reason for so much pain in the world. "I don't know about that. Rogers loves his sharing."
Toni couldn't see anything besides the dripping water that was haunting her, mocking her. It sent her back to the time in the torture room. It brought her back to that fear and pain. It brought that feeling of dread, and she couldn't shake it.
However, there was no calming the man, who looked high. Gary the Cameraman was hopping like a loud rabbit looking for a mate, causing anyone to either cover their ears or be prepared to be mentally scarred. "Toni Stark is in my van!"
Rogers turned to her. "Sometimes the world needs a symbol," he stated. "I guess you wouldn't understand." He glared at her for a few seconds before turning away.
yes, threw her- her to the ground like a sack of a potato and shielded her with his entire body. Toni didn't know how long he held her there, but she could only focus on Fury, who collapsed in front of her with a loud thump. That sight of him staring with his mouth open would haunt her for the foreseeable future. To make it worst, blood poured from his chest like a river, making it difficult to determine how many times he was shoot.
Shaking his head, he picked up his pencil and started to draw the building, which was striking compared to everything else around it. To him like other buildings around the city, it was an ugly building, but it stuck out to him, drawing him in. It was something that she created.
"Y-you'll t-think I'm crazy," she uttered, sobbing into his chest. "Y-you'll l-leave me. T-too m-much work for you. B-broken." Her fists were buried into his uniform, holding on to Steve for dear life.
The End for now... Soon we will be getting into the IRON MAN 3/Winter Soldier story lines. Those will be fun, don't you think!
"You better," Rhodes replied. "And when you two finally hook up, make sure to reframe Toni from referring to it as getting a slice of apple pie." Everyone looked at him on that. "I
Central Park at night didn't scare her, as she was Iron Man, and she could call the Iron Man suit at any time. It was her nightmares that scared her. She could handle this joker, who didn't know who the hell he was talking to, and anyone who thought they could take her. "Why don't you go bother someone else," she hissed.
"It is an elite team of SHIELD agents," Steve answered, staring at Toni. He was trying to read her. "Whenever Fury sends Natasha, Clint and I out, Rumlow and his team are also sent."
Not caring about the scene that she was causing, she bolted from Rhodes and passed the many Stark Employees, each giving her a look. She didn't care about the whispers or the stares, as she just needed to get out of there. Everything felt so small, so compact, and she needed air. She needed space to breathe, as she was about to have a full blown panic—no, not panic attack. She
"You doing anything fun Saturday night?" she simply asked. "I'm sure there are a few places you can take Toni in D.C."
Taking a deep breath, Toni tried to calm herself down. She needed to think rationally and getting pissed wouldn't help her. "What do you want from me?" she asked.
Sorry for the long wait. I got distracted by Fanfiction. Other Authors updating stories and posting them. Geez, keeping me distracted...
"It is okay, FRIDAY," Vision says, his voice echoing. "Sergeant Barnes and Captain Rogers means no harm to Mr. Stark." He goes silent, and FRIDAY does not speak again, but Tony knows there something going on between the two.
words. Get your mind out of the gutter, Tony!" He's staring at Tony as if he's daring him to say something. When the genius doesn't, Jim continues, "And for some scary reason, Vision agrees to help, which is frightening. Those two teaming up is terrifying. So glad that I'm not you." There's a grin on his chest.
"I think it's just our nerves, gentlemen," Peggy stated, trying to cut through the tension. "Let's take some deep breaths and
"…But…" She started, closing her eyes. A few second passed by before she took a few deep breaths and continued. "…After everything that I had said and done, you're still here. Still willing to be here for me, and I don't know why. Why would you come back after everything? Why?"
Clint turned to Natasha, giving her a nod, and without saying a word, the red head disappeared into the apartment with foul expression on her face. Though Toni couldn't be sure, she was sure there was a knife in the assassin hand, as she made a beeline to the super soldier. "I can't…I can't believe this shit," Clint hissed, holding the genius in place. "When Nat is done with him, I'm putting an arrow in him. I don't care who he is. Captain America be damned. He deserves m-"
Toni closed her eyes, knowing it wasn't fair to Pepper. She knew it all along, but she didn't care. She kept being selfish, asking the impossible from her; she knew it was unfair to Pepper, forcing her to do things by using their friendship. She thought she would always be there, no matter what. "I know," she said, softly. "And I'm sorry, but I can't leave."
"Nope, that would be helpful, wouldn't it?" she joked. She eyed him from the corner of her eye. This conversion was the longest conversion she had with Rogers without an argument.
Toni found herself blushing like a virgin at his words. Seriously, why did he do this to her? What kind of power did he have over her? "Then why aren't you? You don't have much time? I leave in a few days."
Sure, he would be laughing; she bet everyone was laughing at her. Was this some kind of joke from God? "You have taken my private property. I demand it back."
Steve turned to her and he couldn't help but glare at her non-expression. He couldn't understand how she could be so emotionless about things. "Why? What's he planning? This isn't just a show to the general public." That man was up to something.
Toni's head bobbed in her exhaustion, and it hurt like a bitch. She so wished Roger would come soon and beat his ass, because she couldn't deal with it anymore. "Why would you need me?" she asked.
Tony doesn't want to hear this and wishes they would all move the hell on. There's no going back. "And I wasn't there to see that?" he mocks. "Dang." He leans back into Rhodes' chest as if to hide from the rest of the room. It doesn't take long for Natasha to rest her head on his shoulder and pull his legs into her lap. Within seconds, her hand slips into the tight boot, massaging the tender skin beneath. The Genius can and might fall asleep like this, feeling contented against these two, and he hasn't felt like that for a while, which is probably why he can't recall the last time he has slept for more than two hours.
He shook his head. "You wouldn't understand," he said as he pulled her away from her slowly. Her hand moved to his leg, which stopped him from pulling away.
, he thought, turning back to her. She had yet to move from her spot or spotted them. She was curled up, trying to hide.
Steve glanced to the man, as everything for him came crashing down. Toni wasn't there, because she couldn't have been here. She was gone. Gone from him forever and it broke him. Maybe, Phillips was right. "Yeah, yeah. I just had a…" He drifted off because he didn't know what he had. He had told himself that he wanted to see Toni to tell her everything, but he couldn't do that now and he didn't know what to do now.
"You were dead for a few seconds before the doctor brought you back. You need to rest," the nurse said, her tone cold. She held Toni's shoulder to keep her down, and Toni was too tired to fight.
Toni squeezed her eyes as she suddenly felt the hot, beaming sunlight on her face. It was too bright, and she felt like her face were burning. She groaned again as she tried to move.
Toni did want to eat, but she couldn't just take food from them without getting an earful. She stared at the door, wondering if they liked her artwork, which she was very grateful for at the moment. "Tell them I want to be left alone."
Toni's spinning head was throbbing as that memory started to replay, but it was like watching a skipping DVD that she couldn't control. She couldn't stop or slow it, and it made her skin itch. It felt like every part of her was on fire, and all she felt was sweat pouring down her skin. She could feel herself shaking as a tremor rocketed through her body; however, before she could collapse, she felt a pair of strong arms wrap around her and pull her into a warm embrace.
Toni didn't know when she fell asleep, but she did, and she had no idea for how long. She would've probably remained asleep if it wasn't for the death grip on her hand, and it really was death grip as she wondered if she could have a hand afterward. She could tell a lot by the grip and it touched her heart as the man seemed to care. Without opening her eyes, she tried to pull her hand back, but she couldn't break his grip. Instead of letting go, he squeezed tighter.
Again, the kid didn't stop. "Are you…are you going completely mental?" He replied, following after the genius as she stumbled forward. His eyes grew large as Toni grabbed at her chest. "I can stop. Do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?" He was talking loud and fast, as he was filled with some unknown energy.
After what seemed like a few long minutes -though only a few seconds-, Toni was able to free her legs from the rubble. She left out a harsh sigh as she struggled to get to her feet. She wimbled on her feet as she slowly made her way toward the Savin. She only spared him a glance before kneeling and stealing his car keys.
Toni watched Barnes as he turned down the asshole. Turning to her, he gave her a worried look. "Things are fine," she lied as she stared at him. Seeing Barnes was draining all of the control that she had; she had to get away or she would break and she could not allow that to happen in public. "I got to go," she stated, louder and squeaker than she intended.
Now, the Black Widow wasn't balling her eyes out (has that woman ever cried?), and neither was she freaking out like most would do in this situation. She was perfectly still with her eyes as the only part of her moving, but she was boiling just under the skin. Maybe, Toni just knew the woman well enough to see the break in Romanoff's shield, or maybe, the woman was just that shaken by Fury's condition and her emotions were getting the better of her. Whatever it was, Natasha was cracking. She was breaking seeing Fury on that colder table top. She was setting herself up to kill the person who would dare hurt this man. "Tell me about the shooter," she demanded, and just like that, her shield was back up. She had a mission.
God, was there an answer for that? "I don't want to talk about this." She said pushing back in her chair.
It was like they were in a movie where the bad guy won. It was a story with no ending. Toni didn't know how to explain it. It just felt
Steve held back his frown at the dark mark on her face that he hadn't notice before. Did someone hit her? Or one of her inventions? "Hop to what?" he asked, eyeing her.
Just as Toni was about to disconnect the motherboard from the device, it somehow sent a shockwave through her arm without even being connected to a power source. "FUCK," she screamed as she dropped what she was holding. She cradled her right hand close to her chest as she rocked. She couldn't feel her arm, which didn't scare her too much. Her frustration of being bested by her own damn device was overshadowing the shocking pain. Why couldn't she fix it?
"Then why did you state 'she will be doing it after we leave?'" Steve asked, studying Banner's face.
"Come on!" the man yelled, angrily. Like an angry teddy bear, he picked up speed and tried to catch up to Steve, who was now a few good feet away from him in a matter of seconds. With lungs battling for air, he slowed and stopped a few seconds later unable to carry himself anymore. With annoyance on his face, he paused to rest—not that he could make it another foot. Picking a random tree, he leaned back and allowed himself to fall, landing with a thump.
"This rooms so needs a makeover," she stated, taking a long look around. Nothing in the room really matched, and it all looked like it came from a junk yard. "…Wait, is this Rogers' room?" Was Rogers in the lobby as well? She didn't see him but he must've been if she ended up in his room. Why did they have to put her in
"No, you don't," he said, standing in front of her. He reached for her again, to pull her back into the bed, but she pushed his arms away. "Relax."
Pepper was shocked by his question. "She has to be alive." She looked around; there were no signs of blood. "There would be signs if she's dead."
. For while, it had just been them, but shit, Toni had warmed her way into his heart and took hold. She was a sister he never wanted. Even if she was scarred, she was innocent. She was true.
"I won't." It was a promise, and he wouldn't break it for the world, even if the world was ending- though the world did seem to like to do that…so maybe, he shouldn't think like that.
However, he had to find her and disappearance before anything happened—as something would happen. He was the Winter Soldier-, and once he did, he wouldn't allow her out of his sights, not that she would have any choice or any interesting in doing go. They also wouldn't be able to stay in one place for long, not when his handlers were hunting him; nevertheless, they wouldn't be able to get anywhere near them, not when he had his brunette. He would protect her from his handlers at all cost. He already had a plan, ready to use. He just needed to find her.
Aldrich Killian was glaring down at Toni, while at the same grinning like a Chester cat. "No more false faces." He announced, loudly. "You said you wanted the Mandarin, you're looking at him! It was always me, Toni, right from the start. I am the Mandarin!" With his chest showing—puffed out like an idiot-, he proudly walked to her.
He thought to himself. It just had to be there; there was no way that it wouldn't be there. Fury had stated these files were all the personnel involved with the SSR, so it had to be here. So he looked for the file yet again, but it was nowhere to be found. He took a deep breath, as he tried to calm himself but his anger had gotten the best of him, and he hurled the files across the room. He watched as the pages flew everywhere, landing everywhere.
"They got sent on a high priority assignment," Clint replied, though adding, "And don't ask me what it is. I don't know," quickly. Unlike Natasha, Clint was not safe from Steve's anger.
Shaking her head, Toni was tempted to leave him there, but she couldn't. She kneed down again and put her hand on his shoulder to shake him. He moved slightly under her touch, but he didn't stir. "Rogers," she called, but he still didn't wake. "Rogers," she called again. She had no idea that he was such a heavy sleeper. "Steve," she stated, switching to his first name. It felt weird to say it. She shook him harder.
After he got passed it and even after saying 'he didn't want to see it', he could see that Toni was beaming. Not only was she proud of the article, she was clearly proud of her body. She may not flaunt her body by wearing short skirts or skin tight dresses, but it was clear to everyone around her, even when she wore oversized t-shirts, that she had an amazing body. He may not have agreed verbally whenever she brought it up, though he did confirm it with glances whenever he thought no one was looking. There were a few times he had thought that Natasha and Clint had caught him as he noticed both of their smirks.
When Toni came back, she felt druggy and couldn't find the strength to move. It took everything she had to open her eyes, which felt heavy. When she was finally able to, it took a few seconds for her vision to focus. Everything was dull shapes and colors, and she couldn't make out where she was.
"Don't baby me, Barnes," she said as she slowly got to her feet. Her legs wobbled under her, forcing her lean on Barnes for support.
Toni raised her eyebrow. "Why do you care about my chest piece?" she asked as she crossed her arms against her chest. "You don't need to worry about it." The screwdriver dangled from her hand dangerously.
"She's resourceful. She'll probably figure it out on her own." He reached for the unfinished, nonworking device. "So if we are able to get enough power to this, we should be able to travel back to Toni."
"He wasn't jealous of you, you idiot," she says, slapping the back of his head lightly. "He was jealous of Barnes. Jealous that Barnes got to spend so much time with you."
"Why back a losing team? My forces are far superior in every way," he stated as he stepped back. "You seem to be highly intelligent. I could use you." He paused. "We'll just need to control that mouth of yours."
Steve smiled as he took a seat next to her with a hand on her knee. "You worry me when you're like this," he said, his voice soft.
Pepper couldn't believe any of this was happening. How could they lose her again? Was this all Steve's fault? "And this is why!" She snapped turning back to Clint. "This is why I am bringing Toni back with me. This act of hers only got worse."
His heart pinged as pain flashed in his mind, remembering his best friend. He missed Bucky, even second of every day. With a deep breath, his eyes were on the tags as they hanged over her half-hidden Arch reactor, which glowed softly under her sports bra. With a light blush formed on his cheeks as he stared, his mind was forced back to Toni. Even with the scars, she was breathtaking; however, the curve of her chest could only distract him for so long.
Toni pushed herself up so she could eat, which she munched down in record time. It tasted so good that she had a hard time slowing down, though she knew she should. It wasn't healthy to eat this fast, but she was hungry.
Toni shook her head and leaned into him. She stared at the darkened blue spot on his uniform, a wet spot from her leaning against him. She buried herself in his arms, holding onto him as tightly as she could.
He was their best weapon, and a part of what made him the best was his ability to remind hidden. The reason why he could do his job so well was because he could do it in the shadows without anyone realizing. He could kill his target and be gone before anyone knew the target was dead. He could hide in plain sight in a room with highly trained agents and no one would be any the wiser, which was what made him the best. It also made him feel whole as the Asset only had one task in his life and that was to kill whoever his handers asked of him. But yet, here he was, watching. Watching a woman, who he wasn't allowed to approach. Just letting her see him at times.
His shoulders fell. "I hate that you call me Rogers. Why can't you call me Steve?" He sounded depressed.
"You could always work with Mr. Stark and invent weapon instead of managing them," the remaining soldier stated as he unpacked the new weapons. "You don't need to lower yourself to
About 4 in the morning, Toni found herself startled awake in a puddle of cold sweat. Considering how many sleeping pills she had taken before she had went to bed, she expected to be out until morning. "JARVIS," she whined, loudly. "What the hell?"
Shaking her head, she closed the journal and stuffed it in the rim of her pants. She would go page through page, reading everything that he had written later, but her desire to find that missing photo was greater. She needed to find it. She just needed to. It was one of the last things her father held.
Shaking her head, she glanced over her shoulder at Howard, who was working on something. At his sides were a couple of lab techs in lab coats. He was working on something that Toni didn't know anything about. Yes, he probably would've told her if she asked, but she didn't want to know. She watched as Howard spoke to his techs, pointing at some of the tools on the walls. His laugher broke across the room at something that one of the techs said in response. Howard patted him on the back and told him something, which Toni couldn't quite make out from this distance. She eyed her father as he returned to the welder in front of him.
Steve knew he was right, but it hurt to hear him say it. He didn't want to leave her alone; he finally found her, and he wanted to see her, hold her, kiss her, and never let her go again. And this time, they might have a chance. "How did you figure that out?" he asked. He wanted to protest and say that he could go and see Toni without changing the past.
The man, with amazing, unyielding strength, didn't gave Toni any time to recover and reached into one of his pockets. "Просто оставайся на месте." He said, as he tossed a small circular device at her.
Toni exhaled slowly as she made her way through a thin crowd of soldiers. It was rather quiet, and she didn't know what to make of the silence. Her mind wasn't helping. Each time Barnes went out, she expected him die.
He stepped even closer, almost threatening. "What part of shut up do you not understand?" he asked, staring down at her.
However, it was more than just that. Her fingers were also…burning? Though she knew the side effects of long exposure to the cold, this burning sensation took her by surprise. Almost taking over her senses, it took her everything she had not to remove her lays, as Toni knew that her body was lying to her. That shook her to her core, revealing how much she couldn't trust herself, and that scared the crap out of her. True, her judgement was shaky at best, but she never truly doubted her own senses. Yes, she doubted her decisions, but she never doubted herself—her body.
. Trying not to think about it but failing, her mind went to Steve. Though not at this moment, Steve was a soldier as well, and he would follow any order to the end, including betraying her. That ate at her.
She could not get over the pleading in his voice, wondering why he was letting his fear soak through. He was trained to hide his fear when speaking, and though she knew he had fears, she never heard it in his voice. Yes, she had heard annoyance and anger, but not fear. Hiding his fear from his tone, he was able to keep his team calm, which was what she needed. Did her state really frighten him?
Needing a few seconds, she fished in the desk and pulled out a flask. Smiling at the sight of it, she twisted off the cap and whished the flask around. As she bought the flask to her lips, she hesitated for a second, knowing she had an issue with her drinking. A big issue. She had thought she had a handle on her drinking, but with everything that had happened lately, she knew she didn't. Even if it was unhealthy, it was one of the few things that calmed her mind, take the edge off. It also helped her sleep for a few hours, now that her pills weren't as effective.
Seconds after wrapping himself in a blanket that he has pulled off the back of the couch, the famous Brooklyn Boys enter, and he can feel the temperature rise in the room. Tony can hear the squealing of shoes as the owners force them to a complete stop. There're probably marks on the floor from their shoes, which will probably take hours to clean. Tony's perfectly still as his eyes shift to the right to get a glimpse of the two soldiers. Even if he can barely make out their forms from his angle, he knows their attentions are zeroed in on him.
Tony, even with the pain, is smiling, though he can barely feel it through his happiness. "Let's not do this again."
Barnes took a seat next to her at the bar. "I don't think I can judge you considering I was going to drink alone too," he stated as he waved the bartender over. He ordered a drink before turning back to her. "You should be resting."
The man's eye brow rose as he offered a hand to the genius. "I wasn't expecting you, Miss Stark. I was looking for Miss Potts. However, it is a pleasure."
He had studied the hole and watched the security footage. He was shock at first that JARVIS even allowed it as Bruce did not have the authority, but it seemed that the AI cared about Toni's safety, even though JARVIS had no heart. The footage was croppy and kept skipping, which he couldn't understand. JARVIS told him that there wasn't anything wrong with the video.
Not climbing out of her blanket cocoon, Toni peeked her head over the top and looked at Sharon. It was weird. Toni could admit that. It was said many times- much to Howard and Peggy's displeasure- that they weren't friends. They could barely be in the same room together, but here they were. The night before they watched Star trek together, and now, Sharon was making her food, after providing her comfort and a place to sleep when the world was coming down upon her. It was odd. Why would the blond come to her rescue? Did she want something?
Fuck, Toni thought. She knew she was in trouble, because only Salty knew her name. Peggy must have spoken to him and she must have seen her photo. "I do not do easy."
Toni let out a chuckle—a much needed chuckle. God, she loved this AI…Was that weird? Okay, it was weird, but JARVIS was more than a program to her. All her AIs were. "Good. I'll be making the call." It was a call that both of them knew would never happen. She would rather shoot herself. "Just…" Stopping in her tracks, she spotted Steve running with what appeared to be another man, though Toni wasn't sure if she could call it that. Even from a few yards away, she could see that Steve was passing him, which seemed to annoy the man.
Tony isn't sure when he has fallen asleep, but when he comes too, there're two pairs of strong arms around, holding him tight. There's also a hand in his hair, combing through his hair, and neither of these large hands belong to Natasha. "Barnes, Rogers," he utters as he opens his eyes.
With Morita and a few unnamed soldiers trailing behind her, Toni made her way toward the control room to see if she could find anything out. After finding her device and making sure it was still function, some time had passed and she had no idea of how the battle was going. Plus she had no idea what happened to Schmidt. Did he get away? As she hated this not knowing, she was on a mission to find out what was going on. She couldn't let anything happen that wasn't supposed to happen, and that would include making sure that nothing happened to Steve.
Toni took a deep breath, suddenly remembering that they had learned about it when she was out cold. She had heard it had confused the guys massively and there was some talk of her being a robot, which she wished she was. If that were the case, then she wouldn't be feeling this overwhelming guilt.
She wasn't sure why her father had dressed her in huge fluffy dresses in her early years, but he dressed her up more than her mother did. She wasn't sure if it was because he knew his time with her was limited or if he wanted to make up for the fact that future Toni hated dresses and he wanted to fit them in. She had a book full of photos of her in many different dresses, though she hid those books well. Though she thought warmly of those times, she would surely die if Clint or anyone else found them. She had a reputation to keep up, and wearing fluffy dresses did not help it.
voice, only the one rugged voice. She didn't know when she started to hear Barnes' voice, but she heard it daily. She heard it in the shower. She heard it in her lab. She heard it in her sleep. And at times, she saw the man from the corner of her eyes, almost like he had came for a visit. Or how she saw it, she was being haunted by his soul, cursing her for allowing him to die. Feeling ashamed and crazy, she kept it to herself. Who saw dead people?
Tony lets out a chuckle as he steps into the kitchen. "We know it isn't for the money," he says, putting on a smile. He can feel every eye on him.
"But it didn't last. I pissed her off and she stormed back in." He rubbed the back of his head, because he knew he had made it worse. "I put my own foot in my month."
Clint let out a huge sigh as Steve step away. "You're going to get me yelled at. I'm not supposed to let you leave."
Getting back to the tower as quickly as he can, Tony asks FRIDAY where the boys are and heads straight for them. He doesn't care about the looks from the rest of Avengers as he makes his way through the tower. He can see Rhodes yelling at him to stop, but he doesn't. He can't. He needs to see them for himself, even if they want nothing to do with him. He doesn't expect them to, not after how he had left.
Toni hugged her back. "I know," she replied. "And I am sorry." They remained in each other's arms for quite a while, not moving, as they each knew what was about to happen.
The Asset couldn't fight the warming feeling in his chest seeing her defend herself. He wasn't sure why, but he liked the idea that she could protect herself. He liked the idea of her being able to fight, though he had no idea of where these flashes came from. Maybe, he did need the chair, because he couldn't handle these strange feelings. He needed to be cold. Emotions were something that clouded the mind, stopping him from completing their task. They were the enemy for someone like him, but he couldn't rid himself of them.
"It is the device," JARVIS answered. Each time it went off, Toni's location jumped. "It is not the video, Sir. It is Miss Stark."
Pierce turned to Sharon, his look cold. "Miss Stark refused SHIELD protection at the hospital. I do not know where she went; though, I assume her to fix her Suit. She has a one-track mind."
Not answering right away, Rhodes groans loudly, as his hold on the genius loosens. This is a losing battle and he knows it as he looks at Vision. "Fine, but if you two hurt him, I
No, she was in trouble. There was no doubt about that, as that was who she was. She didn't understand how not to get into trouble, as it coded in her DNA. It was in her blood, in her veins. She didn't know how to shut up or standstill, as she always had to be on the move. Always doing something. Just by watching her, he knew that there was always something on her mind, always something 'processing' in that massive mind of hers, and if her sleeplessness was clue enough, she couldn't rid herself of those thoughts. Like his empty, murky mind, her mind was full, unrelenting. Like his hunted him, hers hunted her, always 'on'.
Toni didn't know what to do or say, because it wasn't just her anymore. Her decisions affected more than her, it affected everyone; she had think about them, which she never had to think about before. Plus, there was someone else she had to think about, and that was Steve… She couldn't leave him, not after he had been there for her. "Pepper."
Pepper took a deep breath. "If you can't sleep, go get clean up and eat. You can't go on like this."
The idea of sitting out didn't sit well with Steve. "If it gets to the point that I'm jeopardizing a mission, I'll be the first to point that out and I'll sit myself out."
Toni had to admit that just being with these three took some of guilt way. They made it difficult to be depressed. They made her want to smile, which was shocking. She had never been this close to so many people before; however, she didn't know what she would've done without them. "Oh, thanks you, Salty," she replied. "I always have thought I am prettier."
Shaking her head, she took a deep breath and held it for a few seconds. Exhaling slowly, she kicked the heels off her feet and stretched out her legs. "Stupid heels," she muttered. Holding up her legs, she glanced down to her feet.
Gary was the oddest man that Toni had ever met, and she had met a lot of people…She was counting Loki in this, even if she couldn't really compare the two. Gary wasn't insane or murderous like Thor's adopted brother, whose master plan with her was still a mystery, but that was another story for another time. The cameraman, however, was
"Yes and yes," he replied as he turned from the table to a suitcase by the door. Toni watched as he picked up the case and brought it back to the table. Her eyes drifted down to the suitcase as he opened it and took out a few blue prints. "I had a few ideas. Sure, I haven't gotten a good look at the device in a while, but I think this will work," he said as he laid the plans out in front of her.
She raised an eyebrow. "If I could hit you, I would." Toni could feel the exhaustion flow through her; it was like she hadn't slept for days, and then there was her stomach, which felt like she hadn't eaten in months. "What do you want? My throats hurts too much for this game you play."
"Careful, Bird Brain. That's my trademark," Toni said, giving him a look before looking back to her bleeding finger.
She had to give it to Skully on the view alone, because it was a truly breathtaking sight. With the snow covered mountains, it looked like a winter wonderland that Toni would love to explore in her Iron Man Suit and a snowboard.
Schmidt glance down at his prisoner, and squeezed her arm tightly, making her scream. "I did not tell you that you can speak."
Pepper was annoyed. "How can you people be a team?" she asked, moving out of the way. Something was going to happen and she wanted nothing to do with it. One, it would be deadly, and two, they weren't her responsibility; Toni was.
"No, I was told that that was one of the worse things you can do," Barnes stated. "We have just to comfort her through it."
"Let's leave her be," Phillips said, grabbing Toni's arm lightly. "There're a few things to wrap up here."
Howard had been here? He had seen her? Closing her eyes, she tried to relax herself, because if her breathing kept at this pace, she would go into a panic attack. Toni Stark did not have panic attacks. "Howard was here?" she asked.
Toni's eye twitched. She did not belong to Barnes. "Well to any girls," she clarified as she took another slip. "Maybe, you can teach these two!"
Toni narrowed her eyes at him as she yanked the folder from his hands, knowing what it was instantly. She tried to fight looking over to Rogers, who was feeling just as guilty as she was about Barnes, but she couldn't stop herself and turned to him. For what felt like an eternity, they made eye contact as if he knew what she had. His eyes felt like they were drilling into her, and she couldn't help but shudder.
She glared at him, fighting to stay awake. Her body felt stiff and heavy, almost alien to her. "Just go on with your theory." Her head was spinning, and she knew if she tried to stand, it wouldn't end well.
The man didn't respond, just stood there like a towering statue. It was creepy to say the least. It reminded her of a scary story, and it only got worse when the man took a step forward. He looked like Michael Myers as he stomped toward her.
Soldier, leaning against the horribly painted glass doors. She got lost in his eyes as he looked at her with such fondness that it shocked her.
Being frozen in ice for seventy plus years was a numbed experience in which he didn't feel a thing. It just went by in a blink of eye and he felt nothing. It was complete and utter nothing. He didn't dream, he didn't think. It wasn't even known if he was alive during that time. How could he have been alive? He was frozen; how could a body survive such harsh temperatures? No one should have been able to survive that, but he wasn't just anything one. He was a soldier… and not just any soldier. He was Captain Steven Rogers, a super soldier with unknown strengths and weakness; however, it seemed one of his strengths was that he could survive extreme temperatures for decades.
Shaking her head, she laid in Barnes bed and stared at the ceiling. It was strange to sleep in his bed as she still couldn't get pass the smell of his room, which smelled like him. Even the colors and fabrics of the room were so strongly him. Toni could almost see him laying in bed with her, and it made her sick. Rolling over, she covered her head with his pillow as she tried not to think about Barnes' death.
There he went again, pulling at her heart strings. He knew how to get to her; he would be dangerous if she let him too close, which was a problem. He was already too close.
Toni's hand balled and her nails dug into her skin. She wasn't playing anyone, though there was a time in her life that she did.
Toni took a deep breath. Her fear rose up: her father after her mother's death kept replaying in her head. "Yes."
"Why don't you walk away with your tail between your legs before you get hurt?" She said, glaring. With the dropping temperature and a raw shoulder, she now wanted to go back to the tower.
She needed a plan and she would come up with a plan before she tried anything. Or at least, wait until her broken arm wasn't so useless…. That could be months, she thought to herself. Could she wait that long? The longer she waited the more damage she could be doing to the timeline, which she couldn't have. She would like to be born and the tiniest thing could change that. However, she had other more practical things to worry about like where she was going to stay. It was freezing and she wouldn't last long out here for long, but she had nowhere to go. She had no money on her to rent a room and there was no one she could turn too. She had no friends in this time that could take her in.
Pepper's eyes widened because there was only one person who could've done that, and that was Toni. Yes, Toni loathed Rhodes touching her personal suits, but she wasn't a dick enough to do it while he was piloting the suit…okay, she would, but not in a middle of a mission, and if Toni did, Pepper knew that Bruce and Trip were right. Toni was drowning.
Steve looked at her, with those annoying puppy dog eyes (that he would deny). It was hard not to be mad at him looking at those puppy dog eyes. "You know-" He started but he was cut off by Barnes again.
Toni exhaled. "So I hear," she muttered. She was a mess, both physically and mentally. She hadn't washed up since getting back to camp, only using wet towels. She couldn't bring herself to take a shower or turn the water on. She couldn't even look at a faucet, without going into a panic attack. However, she told herself that she should be happy as she wasn't thinking of her stalker. If he could get her now, she would award him.
Again, she was pretty, but Steve wasn't lying when he stated he hadn't noticed. He only had eyes for one gal and that was Toni Stark, who reminded him of the small man that he used to be—not in a bad way. She made him remember who he was and where he came from, and he loved that. That wasn't to say that they didn't have their moments. No relationship was perfect.
They glared at each for a few seconds before Toni struggled in Rhodes' arms, sensing the rising tempers. "Still need to breathe, guys!"
"That was what my nannies told me when I was a child." She had gone through many nannies in her youth.
Toni's eyes switched again, which was quite painful as her left side of her face was sore and any movement hurt. Her face was turning into a deep shade of purple and black. "Figures," she stated, glancing at Peggy. Right now, that Agent was pissing her off. Sure, they didn't get along to begin with, but lately, she was pissing her off just to piss her off. If Rogers was Mr. Perfect, Peggy was Mrs. Perfect and she couldn't take that.
"Are you ready to go, Sark?" he asked. He scanned the area around the base, looking for anything surprising.
"Like a weekend getaway?" Toni said smiling. She knew how to get on CEO's good side, well some times. Right now, Pepper was stressed and needed time off, which was why Toni wanted to give her a vacation. When Pepper didn't respond, she added. "A week?" Still, no answer. "…A month?"
Steve turned suddenly, almost falling off the couch. "Wait….What?" Natasha laughed, which was rare. "Is he inferring that Stark and I are…?" he asked, turning to Natasha. Clint started laughing, seeing Steve's face was blood red. "We haven't done anything. We're just friends…" He paused and looked around, trying to locate a good spot to stare. "There's nothing going on between us…"
"There's only one Toni that I'm aware of and that's Toni Stark, but I highly doubt she was involved in the SSR."
Reaching into her pocket, Toni pulled out her phone, which was luckily waterproof. Even with a slick, wet phone, it only took a second for Toni to dial the tower. "J-JARVIS," the genius stuttered into the phone.
Jim let out a groan before he could stop himself. "I don't want to hear these things," he said, as the mood suddenly changed. "I will never unhear that." He moaned as he closed his eye, trying to block her out.
The genius stilled and held onto the Soldier for a good few minutes, not saying anything. Her fingers dug into his skin, almost as if she was afraid to let go, and for a few second, Steve thought Toni had fallen asleep. However, she was wide wake, though she was clearly struggling to stay up. "Do you ever feel like you're drowning?" she asked, softly.
"In their room, probably doing some unmentionable things to each other," Barton answers. "I wonder who wins-"
"How does what taste like?" Tony asks, stepping away from the counter. He needs to get out, before everyone in this kitchen realizes that he's teenager. He doesn't remember being this horny in his life for crying out loud.
"Thanks, JARVIS," Steve replied, as he finally let go of the Genius and untangled their legs. He smiled at her as he turned away from Toni. "We'll be down shortly to see him. I want him to check out Toni's ankle."
3) And poor Toni. Hydra is having their way with her away. How long do you think it will be before they break it?
"Fine," he muttered, softly. His mind was on Toni and how exhausted she looked when he left her. He hated that he had to leave her, and it was a battle to leave her alone—Yes, Bruce was there, but he didn't count… well not to Steve. The only person who counted was him, and as soon as he could, he would be at her side. There would be no stopping him.
"I can." Toni, glaring, looked up and studied him. This man was different than the man, who raised her, and it pissed her off. "I have no interest in making friends."
Toni side stepped Steve without saying a word, but if eyes could kill, he would be dead. "Bruce," she called, her eyes switching to Bruce.
"He's right, Toni. It isn't your fault," Peggy said, interrupting them. The way she talked and walked, it was clear that she was unsure of herself. "No one blames you.
Sharon reached for her phone, turning the screen on. She flipped to another picture before setting it directly in front of Toni's face. "Do you love him?" This photo was of Steve and Toni on his bike with her arms wrapped around him. It was older, but they had the same expression on their faces. "Do you love him?" she repeated, switching the photos. The next one was taken after a battle (Toni didn't remember which) and Steve was full on 'Captain America.' However, his eyes were focused on the Iron Man suit hovering just a few feet above the ground. Even in his mask, it was impossible to miss the smile on his face. "How does these make you feel?"
Toni's expression turned hard, as she heard him ask that. Though it wasn't a serious question or even a question about her identity, it cut her to the core. Her relationship with her mother was cut short by Maria's death, and it still hurt, knowing she wasn't able to learn from her. There were points where Toni wondered what her life would have been like if she had a mother and wasn't alone with her father. "My mother died when I was young."
He rested his head on hers as he reached for the fallen sheet to wrap around Toni's naked form. "Why don't you tell me about your dream? Or not. Just talk to talk, Sweetheart. Just talk," he said, as he started to rock her back and forth. "Just let me heart your voice."
Toni glanced at him before turning back to the window. "I was going to leave but I had nowhere to go, and it was cold. I was too chicken to face the snow." Her voice was quiet and it was hard to hear her.
The smart ass in her wanted to say something, but she couldn't. Not only were her words distance to her, her throat was sore. Her lips were quacked, and she could taste the blood whenever she opened her mouth. What was it about time travel? It was no wonder that she was out for the week when she traveled to the past. It completely drained her.
"Won't work," Toni replied, still fighting. "They know where you're base is, and they're going to destroy it."
"And I can't forget to sign you up for some self-defense class. I can't have my daughter getting kidnapped all the time. How many times has it been so far?"
Fury stared at him, confused. "I didn't. Miss Stark wasn't even born in the 1940's. She's Howard Stark's daughter."
. After meeting beings of fire with regenerating limbs and aliens, zombies may be possible. And man, wasn't that a scary thought? Knowing their luck, they could run into Zombies.
The genius went silent as she didn't know what to say. She didn't want to answer, but she didn't want to
The world around her spun again, and her head started to hurt yet again. Everything felt like it was trying to attack her and it took everything she had to keep her sanity. Still trying to focus, she stared at the two shapes, which had now turned into men. She knew she shouldn't be shocked by their presence, but she was. She was surprised by everything really. If she wasn't so exhausted, she would be amazed and laughing. She invented time travel for crying out loud; who wouldn't be dancing? Sure, she
Even in her exhaustion and grief, Toni let out a sigh of relief as she spotted a petrol station. However, thanks to her bad luck, there was no one there. It was a complete blank and empty, and she had no way to warm herself up. There was also nothing she could do to sustain her energy, which was something she needed if her growling stomach was to judge. On the plus side, there was a wooden Indian with a fugly but warm poncho. Though she wouldn't normally even look at a poncho, she grabbed it like it was a gift from a god, and she pulled it over her without wasting a second. Her hands were shaking heavily as she pulled the heavy, itchy fabric over her head. After she pulled it down, she wrapped her arms around herself for a long second, as her shivers over took her.
Toni followed behind Barnes directing him. "Shouldn't be much farther," she told him in hush tones. She was hearing fast moving foots steps, which seemed to be getting closer. They must be running toward the fighting, she thought as she heard something explode in the distance.
Toni tiled her heard, trying to make herself look cute and innocent. Pepper had accused her of using her cuteness to win fights, and Toni had always denied it; however, she would admit it here and use it. She needed to win this battle. "You know how smart Stark is. Do you think Stark Industries wouldn't be able to create a time machine?" She said, wording that carefully. She didn't want to give too many details away like the fact that her father was dead in her time.
She chuckled again. "I was playing," she stated with her tongue out. "Besides, I know you only have eyes for Agent Sassy Pants." She elbowed him. She still had no idea why they liked each other, which annoyed her, but she would help him get some. He needed some. Maybe, that would help him relax; plus, she loved how red he got.
At that moment, the flaps to the tent flew open and Peggy pushed through. "Are you okay?" she asked as she looked around the tent. "I heard yelling. Were you talking to someone?"
Toni's eyes widened, not expecting Steve to be back already. "He's in the tower?" she asked, shocked.
Steve gave her another sorry look as he opened his mouth to say something. He could've been saying something as his mouth was moving in a specific pattern, but Toni wasn't focused on him anymore, wasn't paying him any attention. She was focused on the man who had stepped out of the craft and headed toward the door. There were a few agents waiting on the pad, but it was the first one that caught Toni's eyes, which widened in recognition.
"Yes, was, but the main purpose changed. The power sucking is just a side effect to the new purpose."
"If a father cannot tease his daughter, what else is she good for?" He laughed as he allowed her to pull out of his arms. He met her glare as she stared at him with an intense look. "Plus, it's good for you. It helps build character and keep your high horse in check." Her glare only seem to intensify. "Okay, I will quit." Howard took a step back. "However, I wished we could've talked more. I would have liked to have known you better."
Toni shouldn't have known better. She didn't have the best of luck, and she should've expected something like this. In her life, something was always ready to hit the fan when things were looking up, and it felt worse recently. Between the nightmares and the breaks, she couldn't catch a break. Did someone hate her?
The Genius tried to break the Commander's grip on her neck, but she couldn't pry the hands even an inch. With failing vision, Toni glimpsed up at up the woman as her grip tightened around Toni's neck. Toni never expected this woman to be this strong; she didn't even look like she could pick up 30 pounds let alone pick her up like a sack of potatoes. If this woman wasn't choking her to death, Toni might have called her pretty or be amazed by her, but she couldn't think with the lack of oxygen.
Toni thanked him before taking the cash filled envelope. Considering this was the 1940's, it wasn't a large amount, but Toni was okay with anything. Plus, she was glad that he was willing to pay her under the table, because there wasn't any other way. Even if she knew what her SSN, it wouldn't be good in this time. "Thanks," she said as she pocketed the cash in her grey dress.
With his head tilted, he lowered himself down to her level and looked at her with interested—though that could be all in Toni's head as his face was behind a mask- look. "Your suit is a hindrance," he said—English this time. His voice sounded different, sounding like a different person. It also sounded worn and dry, making his sound like an old man who hadn't spoken in a while. The Russian had hidden it.
She shook her head as she expected him to be mad. "Not in my family," she muttered as she picked up her speed to get away from him. She needed to figure out what she was going to do.
"She did," he stated, still eyeing her from the corner of his eyes. "She knew you needed to talk and you wouldn't talk to her." He placed his hand on her shoulder, stopping her. She didn't fight him, but it was clear that she had no interest in talking. "You've been through a lot. You need to let it out."
That hit home, more than she would have liked, though she shouldn't have been surprised. He always knew how to hurt her with his words. "Shut it," she demanded, as she pushed him into a table.
"The Autopilot had kicked on and changed our course," Clint replied, as he started to switch controls and gain control of the jet. "Won't go back to Manual."
"We don't really know if she overheard us earlier," Steve countered as he reached for a towel to wipe the liquid. The expensive Whiskery, as Toni wouldn't buy anything cheap, smelled strong.
Both Peggy and Phillips laughed. "You know what they say about a daughter?" the Colonel inquired. "A punishment to the father for all of his sins."
For a while, Toni just laid there as she stared at the ceiling mindlessly, not paying attention to anything besides the dirty ceiling. The only thing in her mind was the cool breeze of air hitting her, reminding her that she was still alive. When she was in the coma, she had thought she was dead and had gone to hell, which was where she thought she belonged. She had sat back and allowed two people she cared about to die or be hurt. She allowed everyone to suffer, because she did nothing. She did nothing when Rogers came to her in tears, sobbing over the death of his best friend. She was the reason why he was hurting
When Banner had brought up the idea of time travel, Steve shot it down, saying it was downright crazy; however, it had merit. His memories from the 1940's, which he wasn't all too sure about, had Toni in them. Steve shook his head. It was those fuzzy memories that made him fall in love with her, even if the present day Toni was an asshole. If it wasn't for the same glow in memory Toni's chest, he would think they were different people. Shaking his head, he tried to get her out if his mind. Thinking about her only made him feel worse.
"I can't make any promises," Steve smiled as he exited, leaving Bucky alone with the still sleeping Toni.
"Everyone thought she was Barnes' girl, but in fact she was yours. She always was. I knew during the poker game when she lit up at the sight of you. It just wasn't the right time."
Tony can't help but groan as FRIDAY brings up the footage. Why do these two think it's their job to take care of him? Bringing him food, making sure he has gotten some sleep. He likes it better when they thought he hated them. Why did he tell Barnes the truth again? Tony isn't sure, but he doesn't like how Rogers in the footage picks him up and moves him to the couch. He doesn't like the look in Roger's eyes when he sets him down, and he hates the feeling in his stomach. He isn't some fuck teenager! He's a grown ass man, and he doesn't fall like this for anyone!
Steve turned to the TV, knowing what would be on the screen, but the image took him by surprise, and he couldn't help but stare. He couldn't help but smile either as he looked at it. Toni had her arms wrapped around his neck, while his hands were on her hips, holding her close. He realized he wanted a copy of that picture. He wanted multiple copies of it, and he wanted it everywhere.
"Yeah, probably because you don't have a driver's license, old man," she said with a small smile - all she could muster in her exhausted state.
What was with people wanting her to talk? Sure, talking about engines and fuel intakes was one thing, but she couldn't talk about her heart. She didn't have the heart, remember? "Why do you care?" she asked. It came out harsher than she intended, but she didn't care. She just wanted to know why he cared.
"I-" Steve started but was interrupted by an explosion that rocketed through the ship sending them all to the ground. For a second, everyone was in the daze as the craft shook below them, and it took Steve a seconds for him to regain his composure. It was a second later that his mind went to Toni, who was struggling to her feet.
Toni laughed, really laughed. There was no doubt that her laugh carried down the hall, and there was no doubt that it had turned a few heads with a few cell phones in their hands. "And everyone thinks that I am the naughty one."
Ignoring the annoyance of being called Miss, she answered, "I came with someone, but I can't seem to find him. He's like this high." She put her hand up at the approximate height of Steve. "He kind of looks like a child." She hated to refer to him as a child because he wasn't.
Phillips could tell Rogers didn't like the idea of leaving a man behind, but they had no way to save them. "Yeah! It's called winning the war."
"Then who will locks all of the doors on Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes when they try to enter?" FRIDAY asks.
She silently stood there for a few seconds thinking before she turned back to him. "I don't know what you want from me, Rogers."
On the plus side, she hadn't seen her stalker since the night in the alley…though, it didn't mean he wasn't still following her. He could be and she might not be aware of it, which scared the shit out of her. As she took a deep breath, she told herself that she couldn't allow it to get to her. She had shit that she had to do and she couldn't waste time on feeling scared.
Toni couldn't feel her face, and her head was spinning. "Maybe, I can just kick your ass, Bitch," she replied, trying to reach for something else, anything else.
"I was in serious trouble the day I was born," Toni stated, remembering the story that her mother had told her. A nurse had tried to steal her from the hospital the day she was born; her father's security had stopped her before the nurse could step out of the building. That wasn't the only kidnapping attempt Toni faced when she was a child. "This is nothing new for me."
"I'm just fine." She reached for her army issued coat and put it on. Taking a deep breath, she headed toward the tent's entrance. She paused for a second and added, "And I'm sorry for hitting you."
"Who are you?" he asked. He remembered lowering himself down to her and being shocked at seeing a glow under her shirt. He wasn't sure what that was, but it peaked his interest. What could possibly be glowing under her shirt? At that moment though, he couldn't spend too much time on that as he had to save the woman. However, after making sure she was alright, his mind went back to the glow. He had mentioned the glow to the authorities, who stated he was imagining it. There was no glow. He dropped it, because they were probably right. Why would her chest be glowing? Even if it was, there was probably a reasonable explanation to it.
Steve looked at him. "You're probably right." He glanced back to his bedroom before turning to the couch.
Giving up, she headed toward the back of the room, where she came in from. An usher, standing by the door, was staring at her. Though she knew she was a distraction to the whole auditorium, she did not him staring at her. However, she could ask him if he saw Steve. He would remember seeing someone like Steve.
With a deep sigh, he stepped to the door; pausing when he noticed his apartment number. It was still on the door, but it was askew. It may be nothing, but there was no reason for the number to be askew, unless someone was messing with it. Granted, it could have been a kid playing in a hallway, but that was too much of a coincidence. He was Captain America after all. He doubted someone was just messing with his door. With a flick of his finger, he pushed the number aside to see if his spare key was there. Seeing it was gone, he put himself on high alert as he entered his apartment.
"Guys, this is not the time," Rhodes said, putting a hand on Toni's shoulder. It was a firm grip that the angry, tired brunette couldn't break free of. "We just got her back. We don't need to fight now."
Natasha glanced at Toni, ignoring her angry expression, as her glance dropped down to Toni's purple wrist, which seemed to have gotten darker in a matter of seconds. "I know Stark is an ass-"
He looked back at her as he wiped the bloody knife on the dead hydra soldier's clothing. Blood soaked the ground and he was careful not to step in it. "I thought I told you to stay," he said, putting the knife away.
"Toni," he said, grabbing her arm softly and pulling her back. Before she could react, Steve pulled her into him arms for a hug. "This has been killing me, not knowing if you were alright. I had been so worried about you. I couldn't think or function. Oh God, I was worried. I didn't know what I would've done if you didn't return."
He leaned forward as his hands twitched in his lap. "…Feeling guilty?" She didn't answer him as she started at his hands. "I know the feeling. It's the feeling I get each time I make a new weapon. Sure, I feel excitement for creating something new, but guilt follows as I wonder if I just signed someone's death certificate. I know I'm going this to save lives, but it's
"You still don't know a bloody thing about women!" Peggy stated as she stormed away. Rogers just let her do so.
Why couldn't he just leave her alone? Would her death calm him? Didn't he deserve that? If so, didn't she owe him that? He did die because of her.
The words came out of his mouth before he realized that he was speak, "There's a chance you might be in the wrong business." It brought SHIELD to the forefront of his mind, that shit show would end all shit shows. If he wasn't careful, he would drown in that, especially when he remembered the howling commandos. It hit him like a ton of bricks, and he felt sick. It was too much; his heart was about to burst. Steve worried about Toni, who hydra—fucken Hydra—wanted to turn. The thought turned Steve's stomach. Toni would never help Hydra, but she wasn't seeing Hydra. She was seeing Bucky. She was chasing James Barnes, giving
A week or so has past, but the genius hasn't left the lab—not that he needs too. He has everything that he needs in the lab, including a small kitchen and a bathroom. There's no reason why he needs to go upstairs and face the rest of the Avengers. Why go upstairs and face their questions, when he has everything that he needs and wants? There's no reason to. He
Steve wasn't sure what Rumlow was hinting at, but he wasn't in the mood to guess. He just wanted to return to DC as soon as possible to hand in their report to Fury, and then, book it to California. After that, there would be nothing keeping him from Toni's side. There was a rotting, nasty feeling in his gut, and it got worst with each second. Natasha had said it before at the tower, and he had no doubt that it was still true. Toni probably hadn't slept a wink since he left, not that he had gotten much sleep as well. He just laid awake as he wanted-
"Are you look for the Captain and Barnes?" he asked as he looked at her. "They're checking on something. They'll be back soon."
"I know," she stated annoyed. She wasn't stupid; she knew it was cold out here. "Do you always ask strangers if they are crazy or am I just lucky?" she asked. She didn't know what was up with herself these days. Her mood was constantly changing and she was beginning to wonder if she was bipolar.
Then there were the nightmares that destroyed any chance of her sleeping, and now the nightmares had only gotten worst. She would woke up every few hours in a cold sweat with shivers running down her back, and even with Steve, she woke up alone. Unlike before, she couldn't get drunk at some bar and bring home some random guy, not that she wanted to. The idea of having sex with some stranger and waking up next to someone she didn't know didn't have the same draw as before. She didn't want that anymore, and it wasn't because she was in a committed relationship.
He glanced back to Toni, eyeing the expression on her face. "Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes…here." He turned back the hologram and pointed to a spot. "This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded."
They both looked up to the camera, looking almost relied that she answered. "Toni, come out," Pepper demanded.
Okay, that hurt more than he expected it to. How could she say that? "Toni. You know that isn't true. We-"
What were these flashes? Where did these words come from? The Soldier had no idea, but there was something in these words. There was some kind of loyalty with them, the likes that weren't found in Hydra. The idea that people were loyal without fear was new to the Soldier, and he couldn't understand why or how that worked. Why would someone follow anyone if they weren't forced to? It didn't make any sense.
Something in her head snapped as it felt like the world had crashed down on her. Barnes was dead? She knew he was going to die, but it was different to experience it. To know that he was dead was a blow to the heart that Toni didn't expect. She thought she had prepared herself for this, but she was wrong. "Steve," she said as she watched him hunched over like he was in pain.
Toni snickered, knowing Peggy. Even with a hand tied behind her back, Peggy could still take her. "Well, I'm a lousy shot, but I can still put up a good fight."
"I won't," she responded, fighting the urge to pull him closer. "I won't. I mean it." She had never seen him like this. Even before the serum, she didn't think he had this in him; she didn't think he was capable of breaking down like this. It broken her to hear him like this.
Toni was sitting on her cot, staring at the wall of her small quarters that she shared with Peggy, who was more annoying than ever since that kiss with Captain Ass.
He shifted in his seat due to discomfort. Holding his side, Fury showed them another text; 'Just us.' "Just…my friends." He adds, verbally.
"C'mon, just look at these eyes," he replied within an inch of her face. He still hadn't let go of her wrist.
"Probably not," he answered as he took a seat in the chair across from Steve. "But I will ask again. How are you?"
Steve looked up and glanced around the room. His face heated up, turning red with each eye on him. "Nothing," he said, fighting back the redness in his face. There was a bit of hesitation in his step before he crossed (running almost) to Toni. His pink face disappeared as a smile emerged on his face. It was probably one of the biggest smile that Toni had ever seen, but she didn't get a good look at it as he dumped an arm full of torn paper on her head. Big pieces. Little Pieces. It didn't matter. She was covered in it.
She pushed herself up and onto the couch. "Did you think it was because I don't want to talk to you?" she snapped. "I'm sorry that I don't tell strangers my deep dark secrets." She regretted her tone and words the second she heard them.
She did a chuckling sigh. "I would love to see you fall on your ass." She took great joy whenever he failed or fell on his face. It meant he wasn't perfect.
Tony wonders if he should've stayed away. It would've been easier. "Is that anything different?" he asks.
Again, he allowed the silence to overcome them as he looked away, but this time it wasn't him who broke the silence. It was Toni as she opened the box. "ID tags," she uttered.
she yelled at herself. "How many times have you been here?" She asked. She didn't need him to answer, as judging by the look on his face, it was a lot. "Steve."
"Would you tell me if she did?" he asked, annoyed. He wasn't sure what he was getting at, because there was no way that Stark could have altered it herself. Even if she did, why would she?
"Don't kill her. The Boss wants her alive." Came Rollins' rasty voice, which just confirmed Toni's fears.
Her eyebrow rose as she turned to him. "So you're up in the middle of a night for a theory?" she asked.
"Because it's true," the agent stated, stepping toward them. "I know what both Barnes and Steve meant to you and how hard this is for you, but you don't have to feel guilty. We each would have done the same thing."
It was correct. Toni had made her choice, and she would be sticking with it, even if she wasn't hundred percent sure. "I wouldn't say it was me, who made it, Pepper. It was you. You made the choice. Don't put this on me."
Phillips glared back. "That would be a nightmare." She was glaring at him with such an intensity. "Okay, Okay, relax. You're sensitive."
. The battle of New York affected her more than she let on. She took a deep breath as she hated to hear that lecture if the gang ever found out.
"You didn't even like me at first, so why are you Mr. Protector now?" she asked. "What changed?" She didn't understand what was going on, and that annoyed her.
Natasha's eyes narrowed at the genius before she turned toward Steve, who hadn't move from Toni. Clint and Bruce followed in step behind Natasha, who was dressed in her SHIELD uniform as was Clint, a clear sign that something was up. "A SHIELD quintet is on their way. We have a mission," she said, calmly.
Toni's eyebrow raised, because she knew it was more than that. "What's going on? What is it, Pep?" she asked, noticing Pepper's stiff shoulders. She pushed herself up slightly, to get a better view of her CEO.
Pepper wasn't too focus on them; her mind was on Toni and Steve. She wasn't quite sure what was going on between the two, who never seemed to stop fighting. First, they were yelling at each other, and then they were refusing to talk to each other. Then, it seemed like they were love sick over the other, and then they were fighting again. It left Pepper confused; however, whatever it was, they needed to have a real conversion, which was difficult to pull out of Toni.
Steve just grinned, as he placed another kiss to the top of her head. His lips lingered as he pulled her closer. "The floor more likely. I can do the floor. The floor isn't bad. Sometimes I like it better."
Before Steve could react, Toni stole the bowl back from Steve, causing the popcorn to fly. "Mine," she claimed, as she stuffed her mouth.
