So much of my love for writing just withered and died, because it really felt like whispering into a screaming void that swallowed everything I could manage.  And when you fought and kicked for hours to manage those small whispers, and they're gone before they seem to be heard...
“I want to die,” Tony said, as Steve wrapped a blanket around his shoulders.  “Hey, I-” Steve took hold of his shoulders, pushing him down onto the couch.  “I'll fight you, Rogers.  I will fucking fight you.”
“I’m very proud of you.  Everyone.  Be like Parker.  Go away so I can saw my feet off in peace.” No one moved.  Tony sighed.  “What is wrong with you?”
"Sir, if you have nothing useful to add to this educational process, perhaps it would be best if you focused on your own situation rather than ours," Jarvis said, his voice calm.
DJ crossed his arms over his chest.  “Tried to EAT me,” he reiterated, his voice stern, and Strange nodded.
Memory echoed through him, and something like laughter bubbled through his chest.  He’d stared into the nothing in the barrel of a gun before, once before, or more, he couldn’t remember any more, he couldn’t remember anything.
Tony chuckled.  “Maybe.  Stop falling over when you're standing still on the floor, and I'll consider giving you the ability to hurt yourself when you're asleep.”
He turned a corner and paused, waiting for Steve to draw even with him.  “For now, Captain Danvers has you and Barnes sticking to the main square, and the markets.  Stay to the patrols you’re assigned.  Some of our more…” His jaw worked.  “Difficult residents need a bit more of a diplomatic hand than I’d expect you to have right now.”
“We're already swimming, Tony,” Rhodey said, not bothering to open his eyes.  “You're the one who's late.”
Cynthia's eyes flicked in his direction, then went back to staring straight ahead.  "The first LGBTQ kid to come looking for you."  She reached for the door, and Steve got there first, pulling it open for her.  She gave him an exasperated smile.  "It happens a lot around here."
Bobbi’s face was still.  “It let me be who I knew I was, and let me do everything I wanted to do.  I learned to outrun the cops and fight and drink.  It gave me connections, to people who found me amusing and people who found me useful.   I got to do whatever I wanted.  Spit in the face of authority.  Kiss some boys.  And some girls.  Mostly, it let me be who I’d always known I was, because as long as I drove well, and fought well, and fucked well, well…” She shrugged.  “I could have it all.  And didn’t have to pay for any of it.”
"You know you're not actually my body man right?" Tony asked him.  Which was a shame.  It was a crying shame. Of course, if he had Rogers dressing him every morning, and undressing him every night, he wouldn't last the month.  Shaking off that lovely thought, he gave Rogers a wry smile.  "Or my nurse maid."
“It's 'let my tech rock your world,' actually,” Tony said.  Steve stared at him, his mouth hanging open just a little.  Tony grinned at him.  “What?”
“I’m pleased to hear it,” Jarvis said.  He gave the quilt a quick shake.  “Excuse me, please.”  Steve stood up, and Jarvis spread the quilt over Tony’s slumbering form.  “There,” he said, and he smiled down at Tony,  his expression soft with affection.  His fingers smoothed Tony’s hair away from his forehead, lingering there for a long moment before he straightened up.
"I'm here, I'm here.”  Stark leaned into the bedroom, one hand braced on the doorframe.  His hair was damp.  Steve wasn't sure when his small bedroom had become public space, but he focused on trying to get his jacket buttoned.  “Happy warned me that you had made it past the wall.  Heads will roll, I assure you, but in the meantime, what are you doing here?”
Sam leaned forward, his head tipped to the side.  "Steve.  I'm never going to tell someone who they are, or what they feel.  What I think about the situation-"  He shook his head.  "It means nothing.  The only one that matters here is you.  You're the only one who gets to determine who you are or how you live your life."  He rocked back on the bench, his hands cupping his knees.  "But I have seen your sketchbooks, and-”  He smiled, just a little. “If I was drawing conclusions, I could draw conclusions from those.”
Tony stared down at it, not sure what the churning sensation in his stomach meant.  But when he flexed his fingers, the ring felt like it had always been there, as familiar as the armor against his skin.
“No.”  Steve sat up, and god, Tony had never seen anything as beautiful as this man, all broad shoulders and sleek, firm muscle.  “My plan was to grab all the linens and run for the closet, leaving you stark naked.”
Ellen squinted down at the picture.  The man on the right, the dark haired one with the facial hair, had been caught in profile, his head tipped up to give a perfect view of his jawline.  Her eyes narrowed, a vague sense of familiarity hovering in the back of her mind.  "It's...  A goatee," she said, but she didn't sound certain, even to her own ears.
“Right,” Jan said.  “So next time that you try to block me, Stark, do a better job of covering your tracks, because that was dumb.  That was-”  Her head tipped to the side, big brown eyes considering him.  “For you, that was unforgivably stupid.”
“Oh, I know.”  Steve watched as Clint loaded a canvas sack with potatoes and dried beans.  He added a bag of rice, and another of onions.  He disappeared back into the pantry, and Steve looked back at Mickey.  “You’re not on the support rolls?  Three little girls, you should-”
Tony hit the ground, the impact shuddering through him.  Hip, shoulder, elbow, heel.  He felt boneless, like a puppet with all its strings cut.  He flailed out with one hand, ignoring the spike of pain as the side of his forearm slammed against the leg of his chair.  He hissed out a curse, wishing his head would stop spinning.
"Well," Clint said, drawing the word out into an entire unspoken sentance, "I happened to be around when Mr. Stark needed a cook."
“It is Tuesday,” Wang said, walking past with his arms full of orchid plants.  The flowers swung on their spindly stalks, and an odd, discordant music floated behind them as he disappeared through the door on the other side of the hall.
"What I've found, sir, is that when you are presented by a small, scared child, you find a nearly limitless reservoir of baseless optimism, because the alternate is untenable." He smiled.  "You have ten minutes to pull yourself together, and then we will both be going to be reassuring.”
Not that Steve was going off the cuff on this, either.  “I…”  He stopped.  “I don’t want my reaction to it to weigh in his decision here,” he said at last.  “He clearly didn’t want me to see it, it happened accidentally, and if he’s upset about it, or mad, I don’t want to make him feel worse.”  He looked up.  “If he got it when he was drunk and now he regrets it and he’s going to get it removed, I don’t want to…”
"He has..." Jarvis paused.  "I suppose 'regressed' is the best word that I can use to describe the situation."
“Uh-” he said, which was almost a word, it was as close as he could get to a word, because Tony was working the damp fabric away from his skin, cursing under his breath as he peeled the top of the suit away from his shoulders.  The muscles of his chest and shoulders flexed, and Steve turned away, desperate for something, anything else to look at.
“I'm going to leave,” Tony said, gesturing behind him.  “I'm just going to, you don't need me here for this, I don't think I have to-”
“Thank you.” Tony ruffled DJ’s hair.  “Let’s go.  Find some seats that suit us a bit better, all right?”
He wasn't sure why it felt so intimate.  And it didn't really matter.  It probably looked good for the cameras.
“Let’s just say that I’m looking for a little peace and quiet and somehow-” His head tipped back, letting the music wash over him.  “This is the best I can find.”
“Uh-huh,” Steve said.  He grabbed a few pieces of clothing off of the floor on the way to the bathroom.  With any luck, at least one of them would be his.
Before he could reach the top stair, the doors opened.  Jarvis was back lit against the vestibule, his expression hidden in the shadows.  “Officer Rogers.  I’m pleased you’ve returned.”
He grinned at mob, raising his bottle up over his head.  “Did I find me a party?” he asked, the words slurring into each other.  His head rolled to the side, and he scrubbed at his nose with the back of one hand, splashing liquor down the front of his filthy jacket.  “What’s…”  He stopped, his gaze going glassy for an instant.  He blinked, and he cast about, confusion sweeping over his face until he looked over, catching Steve’s eye.  His face split in a grin.
“For Pepper and DJ,” Tony said, going back to his work.  Pepper gave him a look, and he shrugged. “Rhodey likes movies, I'm sure he'll go, and you're welcome to join them. There's plenty of seats.”
Callie peered around Clint, her fingers still locked on his vest.  “Is it...  Still there?” she asked, her voice shaking.
Natasha’s eyebrows rose, but whatever she was thinking, she didn’t say it.  “Of course. Anything else?”
“Because a surprising number of them live there,” DJ said.  “And the ones that don’t, love it.”  His head tipped forward.  “Have you ever seen Owovalrahk, scourge of six realms, destroyer of the dark dimension of Vorkas, first among the ancient ones do card tricks?”
“Thanks for giving that all due consideration,” Steve said, pushing DJ’s hair away from his forehead with a gentle hand, the gesture familiar and easy.  DJ leaned into it, relief sweeping over him. “Will you eat some soup?  For me?”
Natasha took a deep breath.  “Well, you’re batting a thousand,” she said, and he wanted to argue, but didn’t see the point.
“Excuse me?” Tony asked, insulted.  He braced a hand on top of the box.  “I have vast amounts of control, vast and-”
Tony let his eyes flutter shut, savoring the pressure of Steve’s mouth, his body, his fingers.  For a long, sweet moment, he just let himself sink into a mindless haze of hormone and need, listening to the soft, needy sounds that Steve made against his skin, and the sound of feet skipping across the floor.
“Clint’s probably fallen asleep in the shower,” Tony said, serving himself an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms.  He forked up a bite and considered it for a moment before he popped it in his mouth.  “Lewis is still getting dressed.  Harris is getting fitted.”
The neighborhood had sustained some damage, but a block or so away, the affects were much less obvious.  Here and there, people peered out their windows and shop owners cautiously unlocked their front doors.  Tony waved at everyone he passed, making a show of his presence.  Either it would help them feel a bit more secure, or it would give them a focus for their ire.  He didn't really care.
“I mean, want a tail?  They have robotic ones that swing when you press a button, Harris is trying to figure out how they work, and-”
DJ nodded, but he also reached for Stark's plate, his fingers twitching a piece of bacon from it before anyone could say anything.  But to Steve's surprise, Stark just smiled down at him, his jaw resting on one hand.  “You can have your own plate,” he said, over the rim of his coffee cup.  “Unless you just like sharing?”
DJ looked up at her.  Then down at the first floor.  “Didn’t you just-”  He stopped, not sure how to verbalize ‘fall through the floor.’
“Any number of things,” Stark said, his voice flippant.  He pulled the sealed envelope from the file, tossing the rest of the paperwork down on the table.  “What's this?” he asked, turning it over in his hands.
Tony met Steve's eyes, his expression almost desperate. Steve gave him an innocent look. Tony's jaw went tight. 'Help me,' he mouthed, something uncomfortably like affection stirring in his chest.
Steve was laughing against his chest, his fingers tight on Tony’s hips.  “Yatta yatta?” he managed, and Tony grinned at nothing in particular.
A small scuffing sound brought his head around, and he smiled at the little boy who crouched down next to him, his arms wrapped around his knees.  He grinned at Steve, his eyes glinting under the dark fringe of his hair.  "Fixed it," he said, in his usual, halting cadence.
There was a beat of silence on the other end of the phone.  “Why, are you getting me a corsage?” Sam asked at last, and Steve’s eyes rolled up towards the ceiling.
“I mean, it was a flesh wound, the doc’s already got him patched up.” Happy jerked his head towards the car.  “Let’s go.”
“Why?  Are you serious right now?”  Phil stared at him, and Clint stared back.  “Okay, you’re serious.  You honestly thought-”  He stopped.  “Okay.  I’m just gonna-” Clint leaned forward, fishing in his pocket, finally coming up with his phone.  He held it up.  “Going to get a second opinion.”
Jan took it away from him.  "Mostly.  We're missing a few here and there.  Mostly ones we were expecting."  She squinted at the fork, checking it for fingerprints before putting it back in place.  “Stephen Strange is always a question mark, no one even knows what plane of existence he's inhabiting on any given day, and Sue says that her pack are coming, but Reed's unreliable at best.”
“Well.”  Jarvis was silent for a moment.  Then the elevator stopped and the doors opened. “I am glad.  If you can calm him, I will be...”  The words seemed to break, like an almost imperceptible burst of static.  “Grateful.”
"Because you're a cynical, cynical man," Tony told him.  "Come on.  Let's find the local equivalent of an overcooked hot dog.  My treat."
Jan waved her off.  “I know the way.  And I promise not to sneak any of Tony's baubles into my purse on the way out.”
“You still do need to eat.  Fuel for the fire of genius,” Pepper told him, tapping his notebook against her cheek.
“Dinner,” Sam said, with a great deal of enthusiasm, and Greer nipped in for one more quick, light kiss, her lips brushing against Sam’s.
Nicholas’ head swung towards T’Challa.  “Why do I get the feeling that whatever is about to come out  of that boy’s mouth is not going to be particularly respectful?”
“Just an observation,” Steve said, because Tony was laughing into his chest now, and he could feel it, through his breastbone, through his whole body, warm and comforting and the realest thing he’d ever felt in his life.
“Sorry, I’m all closed up for the night,” Steve said, as she paused in front of his chalkboard, her head tipped to the side.  “I’ve still got water and some cookies.”
Steve closed his eyes, before the stone fell into place, telling himself that he couldn’t feel the darkness close in around him.  The passage closed with an almost silent scrape of stone on stone, and then there was darkness and stillness, broken only by the soft, lilting jazz music.
Franklin nodded, but Val's eyebrows drew up.  “How long?”  DJ looked at her.  “DJ, how long did you wait?”
“He should be used to that by now,” Carol said, tripping over her own feet as she tried to follow Jess through a complicated step that Steve was pretty sure had been a fox trot once upon a time.  Laughing, Jess did a side-step and a shimmy, keeping her feet just out of reach.
“Yeah, but I promised Steve I wouldn’t collapse reality in my general vicinity anymore.  Makes him nervous.”  Tony pushed himself to his feet and headed for the storage locker.  “Then again, fuck it, Steve isn’t here, so what the fuck do I care?  Guess it’s Black Hole Happy Hour from here on out.”
"I am sorry," Jarvis said, cutting him off, and DJ reared up, throwing a pillow at the nearest camera.
“Are you having a breakdown right now?” Darcy asked, her hands braced behind her on the bed.  Her legs swung idly through the air.  “Because this seems a bit like a breakdown.”
“Right. Like that’s something I can ever cash in.  Get out of here, before you ruin what’s left of my reputation.” He tucked his hands in his pockets.  “Feel free to take both of those wizards with you.”
“And what if he’s not intending to tell Rogers about the rest of the passages?” Natasha asked, not really concerned about the answer.
Phil looked up, catching Clint’s eye.  For a moment, he just stared at him.  The he raised one hand, gesturing at the stack of files.  “That’s because I am,” he said, and went back to his form.
Stark took it with a sound of relief.  "Kid doesn't like the dining room," he mumbled into the cup.  His eyes fluttered shut.  "We've decided to slum it today."
Steve exhaled, and Tony hated himself.  Hated himself for thinking about just how warm Steve's breath was against his skin.  He gritted his teeth, trying to concentrate on the steady, slow beeping of the machines that surrounded them.  They were in SHIELD medical for a reason.  Steve was hurt, Steve was in pain, and Tony knew he had no shame, that he was a selfish asshole, he didn't need more goddamn proof of this.
“Mom and dad don't know,” Val said, leaning her chin on her her hands.  “Mom's not going to be happy when she finds out, Franklin.”
“How is less important than why.  The old one came with news, of Strange and Clea, and various…”  Agatha’s eyebrows arched.  “Disturbances.”  She stood, folding her napkin into neat quarters and setting it next to her tea cup.  “As much as I have enjoyed the company, I think it best that I speak directly with Clea, especially.”
“Okay.  Well, I was going to sweep the snow off of the landing pad for your father, do you want to do that?” Steve asked, his fingers tapping against the sides of his coffee cup.
“Don't care,” Pepper sing-songed at him.  “As long as you show up.  Ten minutes.  Wear something warm, it's an outside presentation.” Tony let out a long, pained groan, and she hummed in agreement.  “Wear your gray coat and the blue scarf.”
“From both a childcare as well as a pruning perspective, yes,” Bobbi said.  “But if there’s one word that could be used to describe Stark, it’d be contrary.”  She tucked her hands in the pockets of her overalls.  “The harder Rogers argues, the more Tony’s going to dig in his heels.  Until one of them-”
“Got it,” Rogers said.  Tony was almost certain he was smiling, that slight, uncertain smile that Tony knew so well.
For a moment, he had no idea where he was, or why he was awake, but the body curled against his was familiar.  Steve relaxed into the pile of pillows, listening to the steady sound of Tony’s breathing.  His hand stroked across Tony’s ribs, coming to rest with his fingers just below the arc reactor, savoring the slow rise and fall of his chest under his hand.
“I expected him to leave.  Or ask me to leave.  Instead, he just sat there, watching me mix bread dough.  And when I was done, when I was about to leave, he suddenly said, and I remember this, even now, I remember…”  Her knife went still.  “‘Is he all right?’”
Tony paused.  “Yo ho ho,” he said, droll, and Steve threw a pillow at him.  Laughing, he ducked out of the room, heading for the wine closet.  The sound of cheesy eighties rock ballads chased him down the hallway.
“DJ,” Steve said, holding the sunglasses out, and DJ snagged them from his hand.  In an instant, they had disappeared into the pocket of his sweatshirt.  “Thank you.”
“A lot of cooking for a lot of people from a lot of places,” Clint said with a grin.  “A show like that picks up people as it moves, and all of them want out of where they are, but all of them sort of miss the place they left.”  He tapped the spoon against the side of the pan, the sound like a gong.  “And families from all over Europe, bringing their own dishes.  Jambalaya.  Fried chicken and catfish.  Pot roast and chicken and dumplings.  Macaroni and red beans and rice.  The things people want to take with them.  The things they want to remember.”
Tony made a face.  “I fired the chef last night,” he said.  “I fired everyone last night.”  He raised an arm, pointing in the general direction of Jarvis' voice.  “I'm fairly certain I fired you last night.”
Steve caught himself smiling.  "I had heard that."  He glanced at his watch out of the corner of his eye.  "You're late."
Jan made a face, even as she spread marmalade on her toast with a heavy hand.  “Yes, well, a childhood of etiquette lessons and dance classes will do that to a person.”  She blew a lock of hair away from her forehead with a huff of breath.  “Even if they weren't to his liking, Tony doesn't like to be bad at anything.”  She took a dainty bite, her tongue flicking out to clean the marmalade off her lips.  “So yes.  He's going to be able to do a waltz.”
Steve was still for an instant, looking at Tony and then the cup, and then back at Tony.  Tony just sat there, the cup extended to him.  He arched an eyebrow.  “Not to play on your sympathies,” he said, with a slight smile, “but this is my injured side, and it’s starting to remind me of that.”
This was pathetic.  Tony let his head fall against Steve’s shoulder, hating himself for it, but too tired to lift it again.  “I can’t…”  His voice trailed away, and he let his eyes fall shut.  “What do you want?”
“You can put ‘Santa’ on the tag all you want,” Clint said, scooting his chair back to the table.  Greer and Bruce moved theirs aside so he could huddle between them.  “I know that they’re from Tony.”
The slow, incremental dawning of Steve's smile was still one of the most beautiful things he'd ever seen.  “I'd heard things,” he said.
Justin cleared his throat.  “You shouldn’t, uh, you shouldn’t tweak him like that,” he said.  He fiddled with his fork.  “Can’t you-  Just keep your mouth shut for once.”
Agatha smiled.  “Ah.  Well.” She adjusted her spoon with a flicker of her finger, pushing it into place next to her cup.  “A needle might be much smaller than a sword.  But a needle, properly honed and wielded, can kill as easily as any blade.  The difference is, the needle can repair, just as easily as it can destroy.”
“I’m guessing there’s something going on here that’s a problem, but I don’t know what it is,” Steve said.  He smoothed Tony’s hair back from his forehead.  “It’s Christmas, Tony, and I know he’s been buying presents for everyone, so-”
Steve shrugged.  “Never really was comfortable with them,” he said.  He swung his shield off of his back, settling it in front of him, braced on a chair.  “Don’t really need one, though.”
“Bruce removed all the knives from his station and says anyone who gives him anything sharper than a spoon is going to be fired immediately,” Peter said.
“What do you think of this font?” she asked.  She held it up in front of her, her big brown eyes peeking over the top.  “It seems very...  Fussy.”
Steve ran a spoon through the sauce, and Tony intercepted him.  “Stop licking my food,” he said, laughing as he took the spoon out of Steve’s hand.  “For heaven’s sake.”
May’s head tipped back as she stared up at Steve.  She nodded.  “There are bigger problems than this?” she asked Pepper.
“I mean, same, sir,” Charlie said.  More murmuring.  “She wants me to tell you that she’s brought a cake.”  A beat of silence.  “And she has.  She has brought a cake.”
“Yes, that is the worst thing I can come up with,” Tony said, at the same time Peter said, “I don’t want to account.”
“You are undermining my authority,” May said, her voice very stern, and Steve smirked at Tony from behind her back.
“No sparring, only dancing,” Jan said.  Sam and Jess ignored her, but she was used to that.  To Steve, she said, "Put on the glasses.  If he asks about them, tell him the truth.  That you had a med check today, and you were told to wear them tonight.  Which you were."  She spread her hands.  "Simple!  No lies!"
So.  Thanks to each and every person who struggled through last year with me, even if I don't know you and you don't know me.  Thank you to every person who fought through their own fears and trauma and isolation to survive a year that did its best to kill us all.
“It’s going to look even worse tomorrow,” Bruce said.  He slipped his glasses back on his nose.  The frames had gotten bent somewhere along the way, and they were crooked now.  “But he should make a full recovery.”
“A very interesting question,” Tony said, his voice arching.  He pulled out a wire, ignoring the way it sparked between his fingers.  “Pep?  Do we have an answer to that very interesting question?”
“I’ve eaten worse for breakfast,” Steve admitted, pulling a chair away from the breakfast bar.  “But knowing the state of this place-” He nodded at the bag in Rhodey’s hand.  “I did bring an offering.”
Billy was waiting on the stoop in front of the orphanage, his cap pulled low over his eyes.  “Where’s Sean?” he called as Steve stepped out of the car.
“The legal kind,” she said, one boot heel bouncing against the floor.  “So.  No.  I can’t.”  She looked up.  I do have a question, though.”  She looked at Tony.  “How did he end up here?”
"No one invited you," Jan said.  She lifted her foot off of Steve's spine, and Steve flopped onto his back in relief.  Jan didn't seem to notice.  She put her hands on her hips.  "Natasha's getting the equipment, and then we can start.  You-"  She made a shooing motion with one hand.  "Go."
“I mean, I was the last one to break my word on that, and I really think that should count for something,” Stark said, and Rogers looked up at Coulson.
DJ picked up his glass of juice, balancing it precariously on his pad of paper while he reached for his pencil.  “Downstairs.”
Chuckling, he snagged one of the extra pillows.  “Can you sit up?  Real quick, and I can-”  He didn't even manage to finish the sentence before Steve was struggling up into a sitting position.  As quick as he could, doing his best not to disturb any of the monitors or Steve's IV, Tony slipped up to sit at the head of the bed.  He dropped the pillow in his lap and then wrapped an arm around Steve's shoulders.  “All set.  Lie back down.  Careful.”
There was fabric draped everywhere, bolts of it stacked up on top of the gym equipment and leaning against the walls, draping across the floor and trailing behind Natasha and Jane as they danced a delicate waltz, despite the music and the faux togas they were wearing.
“Not to that gate,” Natasha said.  “And both Jarvis’ key and the one kept in the house collection are both accounted for.”  Her head tipped towards Tony.  “No sign of forced entry so far.  Bobbi and Clint checked the main floor and are moving up from there.”
“That's your defense?  For avoiding something that would definitely improve your business?  Something easy and close and barely costing you anything in time, effort, or money?  Your defense is simply 'Atlantic City?'”
Clint raised his hand.  “Don't want to be the one to point it out, but that thing was not pulling its punches, no matter who it was swinging at.”
“Tell me they're not going to do that again,” Clint said.  “C'mon.  Doesn't New York have enough problems?”
“Yeah, no, I…  I didn’t,” Tony said.  His head fell back as he stared up at the ceiling.  “Because now I have nothing but questions, and I’m doing my best not to ask any of them because I suspect that giving voice to certain chaotic concepts will lead to a complete breakdown of how I understand the universe.  And I think we all know that I have many excellent qualities, but tact is not on that list.”
“Would you have preferred I told you that it made it look like you had a thing for one of our teammates?” Sam asked, his voice flat.
Seeing the door close behind them would've been depressing in a way that he didn't really want to think about.  Tony shook off the thought, bending over the piece of machinery he was working on.  He could almost remember what he was doing, and he paused, rubbing a hand over his face.  “Focus, Stark,” he muttered.  “So you're alone.  That's fine.  You've been alone before.  You've done this alone before.”  He reached for a set of wire cutters.  “And you're going to be doing this alone for a long time to come.  Best you get used to that now, no matter how depressing it is.”
She sighed, her shoulders slumping.  “Himself,” she said, and Steve nodded.  She opened one eye, giving him a look.  “You know, I believe I prefer Okoye.  At least her scolding is honest.”
“I didn't do it!” Peter said.  “I mean, I know I'm the obvious suspect, but really, he got himself into this mess.”
One of Tony's eyebrows quirked upwards.  "This?  This is nothing."  He reached up to pat Steve's hand.  "If I get into trouble, I'll just tell everyone in attendance to imagine you naked.  That'll give me enough time to escape."
She covered his hand with hers, her grip firm.  “Sam,” she agreed.  She looked concerned all of a sudden.  “We were-  Talking about Sam?” She ducked forward, trying to meet Steve’s eyes.  “Are you-  Are you all right?”
He sank down to one knee, his elbow braced on his upthrust leg, his head bowing forward.  "For your service to this kingdom of New York, for your bravery in the face of overwhelming danger and your efforts to defeat the greatest threat our kingdom has ever known-"  He felt the gentle flick of the dowel against one shoulder, and the then other.  "I dub the Sir Rogers," Stark said, and there was something unexpected in his voice, something Steve didn't quite understand.  Steve glanced up, meeting his eyes, and Stark smiled.  "Arise, Sir Rogers, and greet your adoring public."
DJ looked down at the cup, and back at her, his breathing heavy and rough in his own ears.  She wiggled her fingers at him, a stern ‘give it here’ gesture, and DJ leaned over, gingerly collecting the tea cup.  He held it out to her, careful not to touch her when he handed it over.  “Where-”  Words were hard.  Harder than they usually were.  “Where am I?”
"Well, then, why do you ask?" Clint asked, bouncing up the stairs behind her.  He squinted across the yard, watching the cop work his way around the edge of the house.  He shook his head.  "What is he doing?"
“What?” Clint glanced at her. “No.  No, it's not.  It's not going to-”  He gave her hand a little tug.  “It's not going to kill you.  We're not going to let that happen.”
“Yeah, me, too, I hate having to re-evaluate my prejudices and general parenting, so, let’s just shift gears,” Tony said, leaning an arm on the containment unit.  “Go print out a mailing address, we’re sending a birthday cake to the Baxter building.”
“Go?  Go where?” Tony asked, but the timer went off, and he couldn't think about that now.  He couldn't think of anything now.  He had six more courses to go.
Steve paused, his head swinging in her direction.  “He’s…  He’s been by, has he?” he asked, picking his words carefully.
Tony kept his attention on Rogers and Strange.  “Did you finally decide to show up?” he asked, holding out his hand.
Sam's eyes dropped to Steve.  “I don't know.”  He looked back up.  “He looks like you did just fine.”
May’s foot came down hard, stomping on Obie’s wrist.  He screamed, and the gun thumped against the carpet.  “Mr. Jarvis, if you would?”
“Well, the hotel room’s in my name, so…”  Harris wiggled his way past a display to find Darcy waiting for them on the other side.  “Where’s DJ?”
Steve gave another cough, moving away from the computer.  “Thanks,” he managed.  He stabbed at the keyboard with his free hand, looking for a particular webpage.  “Can we just go with Maison Villatte?”
“Because it calls their attention down on you,” his mother said.  She took a sip from her spoon, her eyes narrowed.  “And no good comes of that.”
Tony nodded.  “Steve?”  Steve looked back at him, but Tony was back at work.  “You’ve been my guiding light through troubled waters for a long time.  Longer, maybe, then you’ll ever know.”  His chin dipped in a slight nod.  “I will always need you.”
The large solarium, just off the main hall on the first floor, was designed with huge glass panels that could be closed against the weather, or thrown open to catch the cool breezes of summer.  The marble floor gleamed beneath the electric lights, but the rising moon cast cool shadows across the rolling lawn just beyond the glass doors.  It wasn’t hard for Steve to imagine the summer parties that had happened here, the guests spilling from the grand hall and out onto the lawn.
Tony lunged for him, knocking him back a step, the kiss hot and deep and all consuming, one hand sliding along the length of Steve's neck, up into his hair. “You're going to make me insane,” he whispered against Steve's lips, and Steve shuddered, his body pressing close.
She paused in the act of removing her wrap.  “Yes,” she said, her voice very patient.  “Book club.  Where we gather, and have a discussion about the text of a book, which we have all read.”
Steve’s head snapped up.  Tony was standing on the second floor landing of the grand staircase, straight and whole and ALIVE, and Steve staggered to a stop, his pulse pounding in his ears.
“The child isn’t an orphan,” he said, and Tony stood.  Obie looked up at him, his brow furrowing.  “Tony?”
Steve hooked a thumb over his shoulder, still wiping down his flattop with his other hand.  “Read the sign,” he said.
Tony’s bed was the biggest piece of furniture that Steve had ever seen.  It seemed, at first glance, to be bigger than any rooms he’d ever rented, and for the first time in years, he could stretch out to his full height, his full reach.  When his fingers clawed at the linens, desperate for something to hold onto when his head was swimming with pleasure, he hadn’t even come close to finding the edge.  His heels digging into the mattress, his back arching, his face buried in pillows, trying to hide the flush he was sure was visible in his cheeks, he never found anything but more space.  More room.
Slamming the cup down, he grabbed a folio at random from the blotter, flipping it open.  “At this point, college is going to be a bargain.”
For a moment, Harris just stared at him, his expression confused.   “You..”  His eyes went wide.  “Oh.”
Darcy nodded.  “So, you can’t, like, it’s not possible, or you won’t, because you don’t want to bother?”
DJ slipped away from Rogers, darting over to catch Jarvis' hand.  Rogers straightened up.  “We don't want to cause trouble, Jarvis, we can just have a sandwich on the patio, if that's all right.”
“What?”  Steve looked down at the envelope in his hands.  “Oh.  I don't know.”  His fingers twitched against the need to rip it open.  “I suppose I should wait to open it, or ask...”  He looked at Sam.  “Right?”
“Shit happens,” Tony said, squinting down at the laptop.  “Do we have a better scan of this?” he asked Coulson.  “Because this is, this is useless, SHIELD is useless, and I was doing other things, important things, things involving missles, so-”
He watched as people passed, and it sure looked like SHIELD.  But if it was SHIELD, he should be able to reach Jarvis.  There’s no way he’d lose the connection, not just across the length of New York City.  He craned his head, trying to see if there was a window nearby.  Maybe a SHIELD facility somewhere else in the world.  Not the helicarrier, he didn’t think, he’d be able to feel the vibrations if it was-
Steve bit back a smile.  “Nothing,” he said.  “Or-”  He stopped.  “It’s not his fault, I think, I just-”
Each hotel, each property, each sign, each spot had its own pattern, its own purpose, its own design.  But when combined as a whole, it was chaos, and DJ could’ve stared at it forever, and been happy.
“I know,” Steve said, taking a sip.  Then he set it down on the table.  “Tastes better on your skin.”
“We don't know,” Coulson said.  “SHIELD doesn't take minors into custody, we were securing the scene.  By the time we had everything under control, she was gone.”
"It's like, a greenish yellow," Clint said.  He was barefoot and shirtless and Steve didn't know how that had happened, but no one working around him was complaining.  "Or just a yellow?"
His fingers stilled, one painted nail digging into the paper.  "But he didn't."  He smirked at her.  "Did he?"
“We do, Miss Van Dyne,” Pepper responded with a bright smile.  “Thank you for coming, I really was only hoping you might have something in stock that might fit him.”
“Yeah. We have to-” Steve rolled upwards, taking Tony with him. When he was upright, Tony in his lap, leaning against his chest, he started fumbling for whatever piece of clothing he could reach. “We can't stay in this car forever.”
“All right, let’s see, what do we have here?” Steve said.  He pushed himself away from the desk, pacing around the office.  “Looks like he settled his tab at the Starkbucks in the lobby.  Twenty-six dollars for that.  He bought a-”  He pulled up the transaction with a flick of his finger.  “A brush pack for one of his graphics programs.” Steve looked at Tony.  “He gave the artist that made the brushes five dollars.  There was a twenty dollar kickstarter pledge for an adventure game, and he renewed his subscription to ‘Puzzles and Puzzling Monthly.’  That was a whole thirty six dollars for a year.”
"I did do my best," Marcy said. He wasn't sure if she sounded apologetic or just exhausted. Possibly both. "He's..."
DJ went back to the Rubik's Cube in his hands, his fingers flying over the surface.  “Not hungry,” he said.  Steve waited, hoping for more, but DJ was focused on the puzzle now, arranging the colors in complicated, irregular patterns that meant nothing to Steve.
Steve patted him lightly on the ass.  “Strip down, Stark, and meet us at the pool.”  He headed for the elevator.  “C'mon, guys, we'll go inflate some pool floats.”
He picked up a few books, a sketchpad, and a stack of mismatched socks, shifting them over to the chair so there was room for him to sit down next to DJ.  He took a breath, and let it out, slow and careful.  He shifted, his legs stretched out in front of him.  "I need to talk about this, Deej.  I know that's probably hard for you.  It's okay if you don't talk back." He looked at DJ, meeting DJ's eyes without flinching.  "Is that okay?"
“If I can be blunt, you’re always going to make me a little-” Tony’s jaw worked.  “You can be unnerving, Clea.  Unlike Doctor Swishycape, you don’t do it deliberately.  You’re not trying to…”
“Seven hundred people,” Tony said, and there was such warmth in his face, in his voice.  He smiled.  “We’ve got…  We’ve got a lot of pastry, Steve.”  His eyes flicked down.  “Don’t take it out on the hardware, Cap.”
Tony choked on a laugh.  “What’s your play, Captain?” he asked.  An expression flickered across Steve’s face, there and gone in an instant, that Tony didn’t understand.  His eyes narrowed.  “Steve?  What’s the plan?”
“When they come in, see if you can keep them in the kitchen.  Ring me if you can’t.”  He paused.  “I don’t want my current negotiations to be misconstrued.”
“It’s outweighed by that secret sense of pride you feel when your child outsmarts you.” Steve pressed a kiss to the back of Tony’s shoulder.
Tony wondered how he managed to pack so much judgment into so few words.  “I didn't design the house,” he said, the words tart.  “And no one said my father had good taste.”  He headed down the stairs, taking them two at a time, and Rogers kept up with him, his long legs eating up the distance.  “He made it for my mother, and it was her favorite spot in the house.”
“Please stop talking,” Steve said, and there was a note of desperation to his voice. Laughing, Tony let himself be towed along through the building, his feet almost flying over the carpet as he struggled to keep up with Steve.
“You’re fired,” Tony said, stomping up the path towards the front door.  His feet slipped on the snow covered stone, and he fought to keep himself upright, grumbling the entire way.  “Has anyone bothered to shovel in the last week?”
“Usually we let Mrs. Parker make the hot cakes,” Natasha said to DJ, “but I think she won't mind that I took over for her today.  Would you like some?”
His eyes dropped to Val's fingers, which were tangled in her hair, twisting the strands in a tiny, intricate braid.  Her hands were steady, and DJ felt some of the tension go out of his shoulders.  Faces lied, but other things, other things were harder to hide.  He was pretty sure it was because people didn't think about them.  That made them more...
Heat washed over him, fast and sharp, and Steve caught Tony’s chin in the cradle of one palm, pulling him up for a kiss.  Laughing, Tony met him halfway, that dangerous, wicked mouth of his drawing Steve in and dragging him down.  “Maybe later,” he whispered against Steve’s lips, and Steve kissed him again, because if he kept talking, Steve was going to lose his mind.
“Actually, that is not a bad idea,” Agatha said.  She snapped her fingers, magicking a stack of white, adhesive backed nametags and a black sharpie out of thin air.  “Here.”  She held them out to Clint.  “Do your part to unravel this mess, Mr. Barton.”
He tossed a piece of melon into the air and caught it in his mouth, then chased it with a piece of bacon.  “DJ!  Lewis!  I gave you your costumes an hour ago, how long-”
Tony reached down, picking up a familiar toy from the pile.  “Don't grow up too quickly, okay, kid?” he whispered, tucking Furbro into the curve of DJ's arm.  “Your breaking your old man's heart.”
Tony held up his hands in a gesture of surrender.  “Begging your pardon, I would never dream to imply that you didn’t.”  He flopped back on the couch, throwing one leg over the arm. “Where’s the urchin?”
“Good boy.”  Obie’s hand landed, heavy and firm, on his shoulder, his fingers squeezing, and Tony felt some of the tension in his chest bleed away.  He held on, just for a moment, and then he was gone, walking past Tony’s seat without a glance back.
“Yeah, that was quick.”  Steve said, as DJ ducked around him.  Steve shut the door behind him, and turned back towards Tony.  DJ hovered at the foot of the bed, one foot braced on the other, one hand picking at the hem of his shirt.  Steve caught Tony’s eye, and Tony shook his head, a barely perceptible twitch of his chin.  Steve exhaled.  “Since no one likes it, I’m going to go see if I can find some pants.”
“One, the door to the yard.  And two, the door to the pantry.”  Clint snagged a heavy earthenware jar from a shelf, flipping the cover into the air and digging out a scoop of flour before catching it.  “Message was pretty clear.  Take some food.  And get out.”
Steve groaned.  “Tony.  I don't care about the state of your kitchen floor, and I'm not going to make it back to my place.”
“Shut up, I’m still not sure why you’re here,” Tony said with a smile.  “Who wants a burger?  The carnie wants the cheapest food possible, and I’m too tired to argue with him.”
“Waste of time,” Tony said.  Someone nearby was selling something fried, he could smell the crisp, heavy smell of melting sugar and hot oil.  Tony followed his nose, leaving Steve to trail along behind him.  “The line for punching Doctor Doom is short.  Just saying.  We could get that done now-”
He stopped, as if realizing too late what he was saying, but Steve just smiled again.  "Before I came back from the dead?" he filled in.
“Yes, you know, the-” She straightened up. “'I have a shovel and no one will miss you'?” Steve stared at her. Jan looked at Sam. “He's never gotten the shovel talk.”
“I am an emotionally supportive boyfriend who loves you and so I encourage you in any and all things you choose to do to come to terms with the hectic and unhealthy world we live in,” Drew said, his voice breezy.  “But darling.  I do know about the five pound bag of Rollos you’ve got shoved in the back of your sock drawer.”
Tony leaned back, rubbing at his uninjured side.  “I was going to have to talk to him eventually, Jarvis.”
"We just saved the world, like, twice last month,” Tony said, flapping a hand in the general direction of the world outside the windows.  “The-  The entire world!”
Steve could hear Bucky’s voice in the back of his head, the only ghost he’d ever admit to carrying.  “Rogers.  Don’t.  You.  Dare.”
Steve opened his mouth.  “I…  Appreciate it,” he managed.  He stood there, watching Tony walk away.  When the elevator door shut after him, Steve took a deep breath.  “That,” he said, his voice dire, “was not my fault.”
“Press the button.”  DJ tucked his legs up against his chest, bracing his chin on his knees.  There was an impish grin on his face that Tony wasn’t sure he trusted.
“We have cars, some of them even run,” he said, shrugging out of his jacket.  He tossed it aside, the fabric falling over the hood of another car.  He didn't seem to notice.  Or care.
“Generally not where I come from, either, but yes, I definitely appreciate your sense of self-preservation.” Jarvis paused.  “I’m sorry to ask you to act as his driver.  While I appreciate Happy’s finer points, he would…”  His voice trailed away.
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  He leaned back in his chair.  “Well, who doesn’t like praise?” he asked, his voice flippant.
Pepper’s face swam into view, and she was beautiful, beautiful and pale, her eyes wet, her hair loose around her shoulders in a copper colored cloud.  “There was…  There was an attack,” she said, and that was as far as she got.
Miss Potts nodded.  "Then you can leave through the backdoor, through the laundry yard," she said.  The look she gave him was half scolding, half amused.  "Or are you going to let me go down in the dark, empty kitchen all by myself?” She pressed a hand to her chest, her eyes wide in mock alarm.  “What if someone's waiting down there?"
He woke in the small hours of the morning, squinting against the sunlight that filtered in through the mostly closed curtains.  Grumbling to himself, Tony tried to roll over.  The sheets tangled around his chest, and he flailed at them with one arm, finally getting himself free.  There was an odd, sharp pull at his shoulder, and then he was free.
“I work with what I have, and what I have has been severely deficient as of late, since you have refused to continue outfitting the house,” Jarvis told her.  He caught DJ under the arms, lifting him up onto the chest at the foot of the bed.  He put DJ's shoes in his lap.  “Your feet will be cold if you don't have shoes, young sir.”
Tony stared at him for a long, silent moment, then turned on his stool, going back to the open journal in front of him.  “You really need to read the things you’re passing off as your own,” he said.  “So you can, at least, help sell that lie.”
“But it's implied, when two men enter into these arrangements, and I don't think that there's any harm in wanting to keep certain things private,” Joy replied, her voice sharp.
"Didn't say worst."  Sam tried to reach around Steve for another bag of trash, and Steve got there first, snagging a bag in each hand.  Sam gave him a look.  "You gonna let me help?"
DJ didn’t say a word, his teeth digging into his bottom lip.  Tony tried to smile.  “But no matter what.  I’m not…  Sending you back.  You never have to go back to Hammer’s.  Not if you don’t want to, DJ.  You can stay.  If that’s what you want.”
“The closest Tony’s going to get to cheating on me was that time I got concerned about his cholesterol levels and made him an organic quinoa and chickpea kale salad for dinner,” Steve said.  “And he snuck past me to go eat nachos while hiding in Sam’s truck.”
“Don’t be so impatient,” Shiro told him, taking another bite.  His eyes narrowed, he took his time chewing. “It is good.  If it wasn’t you, it would pass muster.  But you know better.”  He shook his head.  “Ramen can be served quickly, because the time is spent where the diner cannot see.  The broth, the noodle, the ingredients, all of that requires patience.”
“Look, we don't have to get into the reasons WHY I'm banned, it's completely unimportant, the only thing that mattes is that I am going to go stir crazy if I have to sit here and watch SHIELD grunts make a ruin of my plane, and we've got a day pass in our passports.  Wanna hit the town?"  He tucked his hands in his pockets.  "We're dressed for it."
Steve's head fell forward, a curse pushing hard against his gritted teeth.  “Right,” he said.  “Right.  The truck.  Right.  I...”  His voice trailed away.  He didn't know where he was going with this anymore.
“I can wait-” he started, just before Clint dropped a plate in front of him, brimming with eggs and crispy, sizzling bacon.
Steve watched them, his chest aching.  “Let’s get you home,” he said, straightening up.  His legs trembled under him, and he locked his knees to hold himself upright.  “Both of you.”
“All right, one small child, freshly scrubbed and pressed,” Tony said, ushering DJ back into the room.  “I even combed his hair.”
Somewhere above them, something dropped to the floor with a solid thunk, and Steve looked up.  Footsteps creaked across the ceiling, and Steve turned his attention back to DJ.  "I'm never home, in any case, and you deserve better."  He stood, unbuttoning his pants.  Once he was down to his under shirt, shorts and socks, he pushed the blankets back on the bed and crawled in.  "We're going to find you some real parents.  Right?"
Her smile was like a burst of springtime sunshine, destined to melt even the iciest heart.  “So am I,” she said.  “But I'm sorry it took us dragging you out of your bed.”
Tony was wearing his shirt again, a little too large for him, hanging around his muscular thighs.  It was half buttoned, the light of the arc reactor peeking out over his folded arms.  The gray fabric of his borrowed shorts were just visible beneath the white fabric.
Sam fell into step beside him, a towel thrown over his shoulder, and his running shoes dangling from one hand.  “Figured there were enough people talking over each other in that room, you didn't need to hear it from one more smartass.”
“What, Happy’s not ridiculous enough for ya?” Happy asked, peering into the fog.  A man by his feet groaned, trying to roll over, and Happy kicked him in the ribs, making him yelp.  “And not to disrespect your very specialized skill set, Mockingbird, but maybe-”
“We gather here today, to bless the union of Steve and Tony,” Trip said, affecting an exaggerated drawl.  But there was warmth there, and laughter in her eyes..  “To bear witness to their love, and accompany them as they take this, the next step on the journey that is their life.  All lives are a journey, all paths we take intersect with the paths of others.  These meetings and partings make up our lives, they lead us on, they change us, they make us stronger, they make us better.
His eyes canted upwards, dark slits under lowered brows.  There was something unreadable in his expression now, almost, but not quite hidden by the slight smile on his lips.  “Yeah?” he asked, leaning back in his chair.  “And what would that be?”
“Sure.” Rhodey opened the door, not surprised when Steve took it from him instead of stepping past him.  “You going to call over when you’re ready for a visit?  Happy or I’ll be happy to come pick you up.”
Trip left the card on the desk.  “Oooookay,” she said, drawing the word out.  “I’m just going to take your word for it and say, okay, we can’t get a marriage license, we can’t register it with the state.”
He stopped dead, just inside the door.   The couch was empty, the blankets trailing across the floor.  “Tony?” Steve shoved the door closed with a foot.  He glanced at the bathroom, but the door was open.  “Tony?”
“They’re less mobbed up and more corporationed up, and that’s worse,” Clint said, his fingers drumming on the steering wheel.  “At least with goons, you know where you stand.  Corporate guys?”  He made a scoffing sound under his breath.  “It’s not like we’re robbing the place.  Hack it.”
He stopped, and braced his hands on his knees.  “I don't know if I know how to explain this,” he said at last.
“Steve?” DJ’s voice was small.  Quiet.  And Steve would’ve heard it, even if he hadn’t been waiting for it.
“You're not letting out a jacket right now, we're twenty minutes from dinner,” Stark told her.  “And Obie's coming, so we're starting on time or I'll never hear the end of it.”
Steve squeezed his eyes shut.  “Kamala brought her friend Sam down,” he said, his voice dire.  “Between them and Eli, Isaiah seems to think that he's got the makings of a great new kitchen staff.  Or army.”  He pushed himself up, rubbing his forehead.  “With Isaiah, it could be either.  Or both.”
DJ took a deep breath, and let it out, and then there was no need for breathing.  Things went flat and stable, all the confusing feelings and exhaustion and strain gone in an instant.  Just like that, he was balanced and controlled and things made sense.
May wrapped up a fresh turnover in a napkin, holding it out to Tony.  He shook his head, and she scowled at him.  “You need to eat.”
Before he could follow, Jan reached out, bracing  a hand in the middle of Tony’s chest.  He paused, watching as Hank disappeared up the stairs.  Only when he disappeared through the door on top did Tony look back at Jan.  “What?” he asked, his head tipping forward.
Steve glared at the door.  Tony considered reminding him that it was one way glass, and they couldn't see the disapproval, but that seemed secondary.  He was pretty sure Steve just wanted to BE disapproving.  "I understand the firing squad.  It has a purpose."
“Right, and I’ll be buying a costume company and, I don’t know, lighting its inventory on fire,” Tony said.  He scowled at the costume.  It was a horrible shade of orange-red, with metallic gold ink stamped on in places.  Neither the ink nor the seams seemed straight, and Tony had a sneaking suspicion that if the bag was opened, it would stink of plastic and chemical residue.  “Why would you-”
“Are we going to get him back in time for the actual party?” Jan asked Pepper.  She didn’t sound overly concerned about the answer.
“I’ve got a bed for you in the barracks if you’ve really got a problem,” Sam said with a bright smile.
“You don’t even live here,” Johnny said, and ducked as his sister swiped at his head.  “What?  She doesn’t?”
1. I know zero about fashion and cloth.  I read a lot of bespoke clothing forums.  I might get stuff wrong.  I apologize, but I don't care.
She grabbed for his shoulder, then his arm, then his neck.  "Not at all," she said, her voice rising to a panicked pitch.
“Everyone,” Jarvis said, without a single sign of regret, and if there had been something in reach, Tony would’ve thrown it in the direction of the nearest camera.
“So here's where the party is.”  The small, slim woman whipped her wrap off of her shoulders, handing it to Jarvis and brushing a kiss against his cheek at the same time.  “Jarvis, darling, should I really be here?”  She pressed a hand to her chest, her eyes wide in mock shock.  “A bedroom full of eligible men.  It's all just so shocking.”
“But I don’t,” Tony said.  “Look, kid, brutal honesty time.  I’m going to take a guess and say that the only reason the Stark line has lasted as long as it has is that people find us somehow charming.”  He shrugged.  “Don’t beat yourself up.”
When the kiss finally ended, he pulled back, just far enough to meet Tony’s eyes.  “How does being married feel?” he whispered.
Pepper struggled not to smile.  “I don’t think that burying you under the furnace is a sustainable solution, Tony.”
Chewing his way through a mouthful of slivered carrots and bok choi, Tony watched Steve scoop up a bite of egg foo young in the tips of his chopsticks.  Steve caught his eye and paused, the morsel halfway to his lips.  “What?” he said, a smile creasing his cheeks.
Tony hummed into his coffee cup, watching as Peter wobbled across the lawn, DJ perched unsteadily on his shoulders.  Steve followed them, just a few steps behind, a bushel basket braced on his hip.  Tony had no doubt that he had collected twice as much fruit as the two boys combined.  As Tony watched, DJ reached up, carefully pulling an apple free from a branch just above his head, and handed it over to Steve. Steve held it up in front of him, as if this one piece of fruit was worth the full force of his attention.
“Let's just assume that I will, in fact, take it the wrong way, because if history has taught us nothing, it's that I am incapable of taking things the right way,” Tony pointed out, “and therefore just not say it.”
"We didn't 'lose' him," Tony said, stressing the word.  "We put him to bed last night, and woke up this morning to find he wasn't there."
"I have to, I have to-" Tony braced his hands on the edge of his workbench, rocking his weight against his palms.  "You've seen the specs, my tech is embedded in those designs, and I can't have that.  I will not have that.  I need to go over there, and rip every single one of my components out of those damn things.”  DJ set a cup of coffee down next to him, and Tony glared down at it. “Is this what we're doing here?  Really?”
Stark took it, his fingertips dirty against the crisp paper.  "Wonderful," he said, his voice cutting.  He leaned back against the billiard table, his hips canted forward as he flipped through the pages.  "I don't suppose he had anything useful to say?"
“Are you both out of your ever-loving MINDS?” Bobbi yelled, bringing their heads around.  She stared at them across the length of the road, her hand gripping the door of the car.
“Oh.” Tony straightened his shirt, looking down at the street below them.  “I mean, technically I did, but it was a controlled sort of fall.”
Rogers smiled.  “Always.”  His fingers stroked across Stark’s cheek, cradling his jaw in his palm. “I’m sorry I scared you.”
It seemed perfectly natural for Tony to slide his arms around Steve's waist from behind.  Leaning into Steve's back, he was hyperaware of the weight of the arc reactor in the center of his chest.  He shifted, trying to put some space between them, and Steve's hand gripped his wrist, tugging him closer.  “Hold on tight,” he said, and some of the tension went out of Tony's shoulders.
“Don’t bother.”  Steve made every effort not to look at it.  “I won’t be wearing it again.”  He headed for the main hall at a deliberate pace.  That was the problem, wasn’t it?  He’d forgotten who he was.  He’d forgotten what he was here for.  He wasn’t a man of leisure, he wasn’t one of the fancy set.  He shouldn’t be lounging in plush seats in swell clothes.
Rogers smiled, his head tipping forward. "We're all just fighting the good fight," he agreed, and when Al left, it was with a euphoric expression of pleasure on his face.
“The same thing that’s happening now,” Tony said.   He shrugged. “For all intents and purposes, Pepper’s been running the company for years.”
“Good?” Tony said, and Steve laughed, reaching the bottom of the stairs and turning to wrap his hands around Tony's waist.  “Hi.”
Tony looked like his jaw was going to break.  “Give me one good reason-” His phone rang again, and Tony stabbed at it.  “Pepper, no, seriously, I can’t tell you why, I just-”
“Need to get dad,” DJ finished for him.  He tapped Furbro on the nose, and Furbro nipped playfully at his fingertip.
"No, wait, did anyone have Steve in the pool?"  Jan leaned back in her chair.  "Natasha?  Did anyone really-"  Natasha held up one finger, and everyone groaned.  Jan gave up on sitting like an adult, hopping up to kneel on the chair, her arms folded on the back.  "Who?"
He set down a bowl, heaped high with rice, filled with chunks of sausage, peppers and celery, smelling of onions and garlic.  Clint looked up, meeting the boy’s eyes.  “Eat.  You’re not taking it out of your sisters’ mouths, I promise.”
“You take a swing at me, pal, and we’re gonna have problems,” Happy said, his voice rising to be heard over the roar of the engine.  Outside of the car, the scenery flashed by, blurring into nothingness.
“We're going to come down here some morning and just-” Stark waved a hand through the air.  “Find you passed out on the floor, surrounded by empty pie plates and covered with the remains of your crimes.”
“And I am never going to be king,” Steve said.  They were approaching an intersection, the road forking off in two different directions.  He made an effort not to look at the sign.  “So that’s not a concern, is it?”  He glanced one way, and then the other.
“You can look around if you want,” Trip offered.  “We don’t get busy until later on in the evening, and you shouldn’t commit to the first place you see.”
Tony took a deep breath, and it tasted of copper.  “Yes, it was a long night,” he managed, as the glow faded around his feet.  He yawned, doing his best to keep eye contact with Hank, who was leaning against the wall at the foot of the stairs, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Not like you wait for me to open the shop.”
“Do not go down beneath the hill,” Steve said, his voice soft.  Almost reverent.  Bits of the old language was mixed with the new, and he shifted in his seat, remembering the thrill of fear her dire warnings had brought him.  “As some gates, once opened, cannot be closed again.  Do not follow the sound of the mournful horn.  It guides you down dark paths, and you’ll have no such help getting back.  Do not drink from their cups.  Even their water is like wine, and you will lose yourself.”
“You don't know-” Peter started and Tony turned a gimlet gaze on him, and he swallowed the word mid-syllable.  “Right, Chef.  I'll just-”  He waved at the door, his feet tangling as he scrambled in that direction.  “I'll just go and, and do that, I'll be-”
He sucked in a breath, and then another, and that was it, that was his entire world.  The thudding of his pulse in his ears, the hollow, raw sound of his breathing.  He sucked in a breath, and he could feel the grit of stone dust on his lips, on his teeth.  He was blind, he was lost, and he wasn't alone.  He'd gotten to her.  She was here, her head tucked into the cradle of his palm, her body pressed hard against his.
Rhodes braced a hand on the edge of the hood.  “Right,” he said, but he was smiling, too.  He reached for a wrench.  “You gonna help me with this, or just stand around looking fancy?”
“Probably,” she said, because she was bad at sugar coating things.  Her brow furrowed.  “Don't kiss him back.”
“Shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup,” Tony sing-songed, still holding Jan’s gaze.  “Van Dyne.  Snap out of it.  This is not a problem.  This is the opposite of a problem.  This is something that we’ll laugh about by the end of the night, or probably not, because Steve looks like he’s going to cry and that makes me incredibly uncomfortable, so we’re going to laugh about this next year, but for now, you’re going to snap out of whatever pity party you’re throwing and focus on the pretty party we’re actually throwing.”
Tony tried to get up again, and Steve caught him.  “Stop,” he said, his voice sharp.  “For once in your life, can you not be like-”
“Tell me a secret,” he said, because he was an idiot, because he wanted something he couldn’t put in words, and this wasn’t it, it wasn’t right, but it was was close enough.  Tony stroked Steve’s hair away from his forehead, his fingers lingering in the strands there.  “Something you’ve never told anyone else.  Something…”  He took a breath, and it didn’t hurt the way he’d expected it to.  “Something no one else knows.”
Happy flicked him a salute that wasn't nearly as mocking as it should've been. “Right you are, boss.”
Clint gave him a look.  “Try harder,” he said, ignoring the way that Rhodey was laughing at both of them, his arms crossed over his chest.  Even though he wasn’t moving, he was swaying in place, seeming more in tune with the music than either of them.
“No, but you’re paying for it,” Peter said, struggling to separate his chopsticks.  Clint reached out, took them from him, snapped them apart with a quick twist of his fingers, and handed them back.
Tony stepped aside, letting them pass.  He was pretty sure they left glitter in their wake. “No,” he said.
“Me, too,” Harris agreed.  He held out a hand.  “Shake?  Or hug?  I’m okay with-”  The breath was knocked out of him as DJ slammed into him, half a hug and half a tackle.  Laughing, Harris wrapped his arms around him, giving him a quick, hard hug.  “Okay, then.”
“True,” Hank said, crossing his arms over his chest.  “You also have a problem with pretty faces you’re not allowed to touch.”
“I can't believe you gave Pepper my plant.”  The picture was a deliberate taunt.  The caption was worse.  'I think this was supposed to be for you,' Pepper's text read.  'Steve threw it at me.'
“They were charging three dollars for a bag of Doritos,” Darcy said.  “Like, a lunch bag sized bag.  Who…  Who is buying that?”
“Actually, I went to the building across the street, to see if I could seen anything.  With my camera,” Jesse said.  She was smiling now, just a little, a small, smug smile.  Ellen was pretty sure she'd earned it.  “I like my camera.”  She flopped back on the bed, her arms thrown out to the sides.  “But I'd like to point out that I out reported you.”
“Pardon me, I got five of them before you stopped talking, and you used to be better at distractions,” Natasha said, shaking out her hair.  She gave Steve a slow, considering look from under the sweep of her lashes.  He tried to steady his breathing, because that was easier than putting his thoughts in order.  Nat smiled at Steve, even if she was still talking to Happy.  “But you were tethered quite tightly to a wrecking ball, so I suppose you did the best you could.”
Some idiot had pulled back the shades in the living room, bathing the penthouse in cheerful, golden morning light.  Tony considered hissing at the world in general, but contented himself with trying to figure out where the kitchen was.
“Yes, Ma.”  Steve fished a potato out of the soup with the tip of his spoon.  “Want to know what I think?”
It happened so fast that Steve couldn’t even track it.  Something sliced through the night, so close that he could swear that he could feel the air part in its wake.  The cigar disappeared in the blink of an eye, and a dull, vicious sounding thud came from the wall behind them.
Her face softened, just a bit, her wide mouth relaxing into a smile.  "Of course, Captain Rogers."  But she tucked her thumbs into her belt.  To the boy, she said, "Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?"
“Pretty sure that you didn't tell 'em that your 'resource' might throw a bus at their teenage daughter,” Clint said.  “I mean, most parents would object to that.  In general.”
“I'm about to share my living space with a man that I've been having very dirty dreams about since the age of thirteen,” Tony said.  He rolled his head in Rhodey's direction.  “A man I am now married to.”
“Then, no,” Steve said.  “I didn’t.” He took a breath.  “The orphan thing wasn’t your idea, was it?”
“Captain Rogers had already finished his run and returned to the building before the rain began,” Jarvis said.  “He is on his way up now.”
“Yes, can't imagine why that is,” Tony said.  DJ had settled down on the carpet next to the desk again, his attention focused on a massive book of mechanical diagrams that Jarvis had found for him.  Sprawled out on his stomach, he seemed perfectly content to pour over every page.  Tony kind of wished he could join him.  Instead, he reached for another stack of paperwork.  “How much more of this do we have?” he asked Pepper.
Sam grinned at him, even as he reached for a box of fried rice.  “There’s like eight of them in there, you can spare one,” he pointed out.
Steve realized he was smiling.  “I think you just might be right.” He was moving around the table, without even thinking about it.  “So.  Everyone except Pepper, Mrs. Parker and Jarvis?  And Bruce?”
Bucky looked back at Shuri.  “He was covered in mud and straw and was trying to prop the whole mess up using his own shoulder, trying and failing,” Shuri said.  She grinned at Steve.  “Broad shoulders.  Not broad enough.”
“Is it?” he asked, flipping through the manga.  He got the distinct impression that Steve was not the target market for this.'
“I liked it,” DJ said.  “It was-”  His head tipped to the side.  “Kind.  Fun, and nice, and clever, but it was kind, it was kind to the characters, and the player, and a lot of people liked it.”  He stopped, the sudden flow of words exhausting him.  Harris was just smiling at him, his glasses still crooked, his hand still moving against the cat’s fur.  DJ scrubbed at his face with a hand.  “A lot of people liked it,” he repeated.  “And it was nice.  Reading what they said.  What everyone said.”
“Yeah.”  Steve glanced at the door.  This was the right choice.  This was always going to be the right choice.  He took a deep breath and told himself that he absolutely couldn't smell Tony in the air, that familiar mix of expensive cologne and machine oil.
Obie frowned, taking a sip from his glass.  “Tastes just fine to me,” he said.  He arched an eyebrow.  “Want a fresh cup?”
“So two weeks pass, we’re running short of soldiers that haven’t already made a try at this,” Shuri said.  “There are arguments amongst those who have gone and the council.  None of the guards we put on him have returned.”  She paused.  “It was a particularly slow time for gossip, so you can imagine, this was all anyone was talking about.
