“Don’t break the bed Steve,” he said before slowly rising and pushing mini Cap into him. He didn’t open himself up enough for this, but he wanted to feel the burn, it had been too long since they’ve had this and he wanted to feel every part of it. Under him, Steve’s hips bucked up, pushing Steve’s dick further and further in, Tony was quick and pressed the button on his watch to activate the vibrator, which only made Steve push up until he was fully inside of Tony.
“You gave your parents a heart attack, and Tony was the one who made you that suit,” Steve said wondering how his own kids didn’t understand that their parents knew everything. “We let you kids have KAREN as a defense, we don’t interfere with her, but it would be nice if you guys would warn us a little when you actually decide to use your powers.”
“No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke,” he was voicing his opinion on the whole thing, it had been a small experiment on Lang’s end. “And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?”
Walking into the house and seeing it from Tony’s eyes was one thing that Steve had never thought about before now. The living room was the first thing you saw, the dining room was turned into a makeshift study area before the door to the kitchen. All of the people who lived in the house played baseball, but they were all on scholarship as well, so they had to study no matter what to keep their grades up. They only had parties at the end of the semester, and if they won a game during the season, other than those days the house was pretty quiet give or take the random sessions of them playing on one of the video game consoles.
“Don’t date someone you knew in diapers,” she had told Steve after he and Bucky had broken it off, which had only made him laugh.
“Yeah just like that,” Steve said with a fierce determination that Tony knew so well from the years that they worked together.
“Who would have thought you and Howard’s kid, the man would have a coronary if he knew, but I won’t tell him, I’ll just stay close to Tony, and when you find him in the future wherever you are, I’ll make sure you cherish him as much as you do now.”
“Liar take it back, my handwriting is fine,” Steve said defending himself, and of course it was fine, Tony knew this, but for some reason teasing Steve was the most fun he’s had in the last day.
“God you’re a fucking terror,” Barnes said pushing away from the bed as Steve grumbled about being stuck there. “I don’t remember you being this much of an asshole.”
“Tony... We have to take a stand,” Natasha said and he wasn’t sure just how much he was willing to lose over a half-baked plan that may or may not work.
“There are a lot of planets in the universe,” Carol said calmly the room silent as they looked between her and Sharon. “And unfortunately, they didn’t have you guys.”
“Oh, I guess I misread somethings,” she said, looking down at her hands while twisting one of the rings on her finger.
“Holy shit, the rumors are true,” Bucky said from the door, holding his laundry bag, which was full of Bucky’s clean clothes, courtesy of his Bucky’s mom. “Dude, that’s Tony Stark, shit my roommate is Tony Stark.”
“It was as funny as that day we were playing cards against humanity and you got that Hitler question,” Tony said laughing even harder. “You.... you wouldn’t even look at me, or the kids.”
“Will you ever tell me who it is?” he yawned as he tried to smile, he was glad that she found happiness.
Steve couldn’t help but feel powerless over everything, he had moved on with Tony, they had all tried to move on, some better than others it seems, which made Steve wonder just how much him and Tony had missed in the last five years if Clint is out there going after bad guys, and Nat is working herself to death because of her guilt.
Well at least this would throw off the whole Hydra thing, they would only chalk it up to Loki messing with them just to get the scepter. But for his other self he knew that he had to find a way to reason with the man. He remembered what it had been like during that time, just out of the ice and only one thing moving him forward. This was before he had his team, his family, when everything was ready to fall apart at any turn.
“Okay... yeah... sure,” Tony said wondering if this was going to be the thing that would bring them together, or keep them apart.
“Lightning won't help you, love. It's gotta be me,” Bruce said before shaking his head. “Actually, it has to be Hulk, you saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.”
The rest of the week went about the same way, he was either with Rhodey at the Rhodes house, or spoiling Pepper and May, by taking them out to dinner. He wanted them to have a good break, but also it kept him from being too lonely. Jarvis and Ana came to the house on Saturday and they baked all kinds of treats for Tony to take back with him. He hadn’t seen anyone else even when they had driven him back to school the next morning, Natasha had called and said that Jan and her were coming back late, something about the flight being delayed because of weather, so in the end he was actually alone on the way up. The car smelled like cookies and home, but if he were being honest, he really just wanted to see Steve again.
“They’re so good together,” Rhodey had said looking at Tony with this glassy eyed look. “I can’t get between that, and there’s a kid, they’re happy, so I’ll drink to my crush, and I’ll let it die.”
“I wonder what the world would think about your filthy mouth,” Tony said before leaning in to kiss Steve on the lips. “And the plug can stay, maybe after a nap we can go for round two.”
“Oh, hi Steve,” the other guy said smiling while his glasses slid down his face, his big brown eyes drawing Steve in, which was bad, he couldn’t get into a relationship with Bucky’s roommate, what would happen if it didn’t work out. “I’m Tony.”
“I don’t think so,” he said feeling happy and depressed at the same time was killing him and he knew it. “It’s just that... well before you showed up, I got into a huge fight with that guy from my fiction writing class.”
After a while the rush died down, Thor smiled happily from the door, especially when his boyfriend had shown up, which surprised Steve because he hadn’t thought to ask Thor about his life. Though if Thor looked as happy as he was then Steve couldn’t fault him anything. He greeted customers and walked around, every once and a while grabbing a book off the shelf and looking through it.
“Stop,” he said before pulling his brothers apart. “You can tell me about this later, for now I just have someone I want to introduce to you guys.”
, the message said, it was Natasha, of course it was Natasha and she was going to force him to move and he didn’t want to.
Everyone in the room groaned at Scott’s question, none of them wanting to answer, instead Bruce turned to Clint and pointed at the platform, indicating that he should get going before they diverged into something in even more ridiculous.
Nebula starts walking towards them when Rhodey lands in front of Lang who drops the rest of his taco.
“My darling Anthony, until you and your Steve have jobs and don’t live at home, you will both be boys, but you and your brothers would always be my boys.”
“Take care of them,” he said watching as the others were standing out in the hallway, suited up and ready. “I’ll be here waiting some food when you get back.”
“You don’t need to question it, I really like you Tony, not because of your family, or who the world thinks you are, but as the guy who wears sweaters that are too long.”
“Well considering Steve is standing in front of me at this moment, I would say you may have a story to tell, but not one I’m supposed to know.”
“I still can’t believe you made me get up so early just to come back here,” Bucky said slumped over at one of the tables. “I could have slept in you know.”
There was also the fact that a flustered Tony Stark was a turn on for him for some reason, although this whole encounter could just be in his head, but he hadn’t hit his head he only hit his foot, so that whole hallucination thing was not entirely possible at the moment.
The meeting, as any other that they’ve had since Steve started them, went the same, they drank coffee, and talked with friends at first, sometimes a new person showed up, and they got to know them. It was the one time during most of their week where they were allowed to grieve for the life they once had, the families they lost, the friends that they would never see again. Miles talked about his biological parents, telling the group about how his adoptive family has helped him, no one knew that Steve was one of his adoptive parents, Tony hadn’t wanted the kids to become targets because of their parents, so other than the papers that declared them a family no one actually knew that they were a family. Outside of the Avengers and their friends, the world only knew that Tony Stark had married Steve Rogers, they didn’t know that the couple had four kids, the only one that had been adopted publicly in anyway had been Morgan but even with her, they had made sure to keep everything quiet.
“What, what do you mean, they fought that whole year,” Steve said knowing that while Buck was bi, Sam was as straight as an arrow. “They fought because of me, Sam was pissed at Bucky because of what had happened, not because he liked him that way.”
“Don’t worry too much,” he said slowly moving his hand under the hem of Steve’s pajama bottoms, touching his leg slowly as he moved to the side of the bed and kneeled onto the mattress before he ripped the fabric all the way up. “I know what I’m doing.”
“Yeah well we didn’t get away with it completely last time either,” Tony said to him before pulling him down for a kiss. “This is different though.”
Steve watches as Tony’s sent flying, his heart can’t take watching Tony die, he’s not sure if he could survive losing Tony after everything. Using his shield, he charges at Thanos but is immediately pushed back, he tries again but the Titan all but throws him across the field.
“Oh, the whole world, well I’ll be the judge of that,” Tony said as Steve got out of the car and walked over to Tony’s side to let him out, the whole gentleman thing was really doing it for him tonight. The sweater, the dinner, even the thought of sitting with him under the stars, it was nice to think that Steve had put this much thought into their first real date. He wondered what he should do for their second, the only thing he could think of was actually showing Steve DUM-E which he knew Steve would like. Maybe a picnic, though he wasn’t the best cook in the world, but he did know how to cook simple things, and some of his mother’s favorite recipes as well.
“So, does this mean that you’re dating Tony Stark?” Bucky asked and Steve knew that they were curious, but Steve wasn’t sure about the logistics of it either, because while they talked and had fun, they hadn’t kissed so it couldn’t be considered a first date.
Tony pulled away once he saw Professor Coulson walking towards them, “I’ll be back in maybe five minutes.”
An hour later, they were all laying around the room, no one moving as they all thought about the other three stones that they needed to locate, they knew that they would have to go back to the day the Avengers first formed, but they also had to figure out the time stone as well. Both Tony and Natasha were lying on the table, papers scattered all around them, Bruce on the floor Thor soundly sleeping on his lap, Steve was off making dinner for when the kids arrived, Shuri was with Scott and Hope adjusting the suits, while Rhodey and Carol went off on a walk. Nebula had disappeared, and Tony was certain that Rocket was making a bomb outside.
He was half asleep in his writing class, he knew that he wouldn’t survive like this much longer, and he could have skipped today and gotten some sleep, but Professor Coulson was giving out their second assignment while also giving back their first. Tony was surprised to see an A on his paper but a B- on Ty’s. The other boy wasn’t mad at him, just smiling at the fact that he had gotten such a high grade. Tony did the first thing he could and hid his paper so that it wouldn’t be a reminder of who he was. His name had been plastered on the paper, but Tony always smudged it enough so that no one could read it. He knew that he was on borrowed time when it came to his name, the fact that he looked nothing like his pictures helped, but eventually people would notice. He’s amazed that his roommate had been the only one to realize that he’s the actual Tony Stark. Though he still couldn’t figure out how Natasha had stayed out of the spotlight when she still looked the same.
Before Tony could say anything, his professor was surrounded by students, and Tony was afraid that he had done something wrong again, but he knew he hadn’t, the story had been perfect. He knew that he shouldn’t freak out, but he was going through a million possible scenarios in his head about what could have gone wrong. If he had been paying attention, he would have noticed that someone was following him to the professor’s office, it wasn’t until Ty’s stupid grin was right in front of him that Tony realized that whatever it was that was going to happen it somehow involved Ty and it wasn’t going to end well.
“No, not really, it’s nice that they’re still all lovey dovey, my parents are only like that when they want to embarrass us, or when they’re alone, it’s not something they do when they’re in public, I never understood why but I’m sure that it has everything to do with this image that they want to project.”
It was a few hours later, as he looked at the device in the back of Scott’s van, with Hope there calibrating the whole device, Bruce and Shuri working around Tony’s theory. Where Steve was wondering if it was a good idea at all.
She patted him on the back as she let go, “This is going to work Steve,” she said before walking off towards the ship that Tony had gotten out of, the ship that had kept him alive and helped him make allies, the one that could bring him a new hope or his death.
They all needed something to come home to, “Yeah lets,” he said before she wheeled him out of the workshop. “Clean up in here boys, I’ll be back by the end of the day.”
“Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir,” she said never looking at anyone in the room, the stone floating around in front of her was the only thing holding her attention.
Bruce nodded from behind the console, “Clint, now you’re gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift,” he said as Clint took his place on the platform. “Don’t worry about it.”
“Good,” she said smiling at him. “Now let’s go eat some dinner, so you and Tony can have your time with your kids.”
, and it was the best thing he could have asked for. “When this is all over, you have to come for a visit, Morgan is so big, and Riri has some designs she wants to show you.”
“We didn’t know what would have happened with this, they could have gotten hurt,” he told him and Steve took his hand. “I can’t lose them too.”
He looked at the helmet, knowing that he made it, the car, Steve’s suits, the suits for all the kids, everything was made out of a need inside of him to keep everyone he cared about safe. He upgraded all the armors constantly, he made weapons for Natasha, a new arm for Nebula, clothes for the Hulk, pretty much anything he could think of. There were still threats out there, things that could come after them, people hell bent on revenge after the decimation. It was the fear of something happening that caused him to create things for everyone he cared about, even when he himself feared going back to being Iron Man.
“Now, I will get the mind stone,” Steve turned towards them, and while Tony knew that Steve hated his plan, it was the only one they had. “Scott you’re going to have to work with Tony to get the tesseract, his face is too recognizable, so you both have to work on getting a hold of the cube without bringing too much attention to yourselves.”
“I would, otherwise I’d be hiding in a corner waiting to go home,” Tony smiled leaning into Steve’s hands. “I don’t talk that much, it comes from the trauma of being kidnapped, but also from being in a family full of loud brothers. I think I’ve talked to you more in the last few months than I’ve ever talked to anyone outside of Natasha.”
When he came too a few minutes later, Steve was free from his restraints and Tony was now tied up to the bed using just Steve’s now ruined pajamas. “Well this isn’t fair,” he said struggling to get out.
Tony couldn’t help but look over and see the man standing next to him, his clothes were a little looser, not the same tight shirts they had all made fun of over the years, the beard was still a sight to see, but Tony missed the clean shaved Captain America he had come to know. Steve’s depression beard was just another reminder of what had happened between the two of them in the last few years. Tony as much as he didn’t want to have a fight with Steve, was still holding onto some of the resentment over it all. He had the urge to tinker, he needed a moment where he wasn’t overwhelmed by how many people were around them, how much had changed, or the fact that there were a lot of people missing from their lives.
“Really,” Tony said shaking his head at what he was seeing. “Clearly they have no sense of self preservation.”
Quickly placing a kiss on Steve’s thigh, Tony moved to fit himself between Steve’s legs, his supplies placed just under Steve’s leg. “First, let’s give mini Cap his present before he gets to big for it,” his eyes meeting Steve as he said the words.
Jumping out of his car, just because he was excited, he walked up to the dorm, not really sure if Tony would be there, or Bucky for that matter, he had literally just drove there without knowing if anyone was home. He walked up the steps to the dorm, hoping that someone would be there only to see Tony trying, and failing to open his door.
“You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already,” he says to her as he slumps over on the bookshelf finally letting her know that he was there.
“It was fine,” Steve said mainly because he didn’t want to give too much away. “I mean he actually is Tony Stark, but we went to Shake Shack and at burgers, it wasn’t anything fancy,” he wasn’t going to tell them that they had stayed out until almost three in the morning talking, while walking around Manhattan, which should honestly be a bad idea, but he hadn’t cared.
“No,” he said before pulling Tony further into the room. “We’re not having this conversation, whatever they do in their personal time is up to them and if they want to tell us they will.”
"Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?” Natasha continued her questioning as if there was something there that no one was seeing, which was now worrying Steve.
“Hello, Ms... umm,” Steve started but he didn’t know who Pepper was and Tony hadn’t given him her name.
Steve hadn’t gotten to finish Tony’s latest story, the one where Iron Man’s identity is revealed, but he thought that Tony would be the best one to choose that, but in Steve’s eyes, just like how Captain America was modeled over him, Iron Man could be Tony.
“Steve, the ambulance is here,” Darcy said from the other side of the door, which meant that the cops were also there.
It had been barely a few seconds before Clint rematerialized on the glass platform, he was panting, his hands on his knees before he buckled and hit the glass panels on the ground. Natasha was the first to get to Clint while the rest of them hovered over them.
“The girls are coming,” she said her eyes scrunched up a bit. His father stood there, dumbstruck, and Steve wasn’t sure of what to do either. “Hospital Joe, get me to the hospital.”
“It’s because your head was stuck inside of a book,” Natasha said as they packed everything away in the back. “Though I don’t know who took it, the account that posted it could be a fake, I mean how can we miss someone as famous as Tony Stark inside of this store.”
“Not yet, she’s really good at taking care of herself, and technically she’s older than me, but our brothers might say something if you get to that point in your relationship.”
“Fine but you’re going in a wheelchair and you can’t complain about it either,” Steve told him before standing up and grabbing the wheelchair that Tony swore hadn’t been there before. Before he could move to get into it, Steve picked him up and slowly put him in the chair, blanket and all. “No complaining.”
He hadn’t realized that Bucky had left until the door swung open and a guy came in carrying a box full of stuff, while mumbling to himself about how hard the mattress was, and how he didn’t get any sleep because of it. Steve, being who he is because his mother taught him manners, helped the guy by taking the box out of his hands.
“Steve,” Natasha said from behind him, he hadn’t noticed that Scott and Hope had left, but there was a lot of things happening. “I need to go somewhere first,” she told him and he knew that where ever it was it had to do with Clint. Clint and the kids had been her family a lot longer than the Avengers had.
“Uhh, magic wand?” Natasha said while holding onto Loki’s scepter. The thing that started it all, these two stones had caused them so much grief in such a short amount of time.
“I’m not sure just yet, he’s still in the prototype phase, I need to ensure that his coding works, but hopefully once done this could be helpful for uses within an automated workshop,” Tony answered, although he was sure that the bot would be called DUM-E, because he was a little well dummy. In a way he was Tony’s crash test dummy, the thing that would help him create better versions of his projects, including his bots.
Tony had just taken a bite of his burger as he heard the question, he almost choked on it for a second and then it took him a minute to swallow it down, because honestly, he was starved, and he was going to take his damn time, plus there was that whole breathing thing that he needed to do. “Well, I’m not the only one, my sister is here too,” he said outing Natasha to his roommate, but since she said he was hot then she probably wouldn’t mind. “But anyway, I just didn’t want to go somewhere that my brothers had already been, unlike them I have to make a name out of myself without all the perks of being a Stark.”
“Oh,” Stark said and Steve could see the man blushing, they were the same age he was sure of that, so why would Stark be embarrassed over this. “Well, actually, um, I know the person who used to run this place.”
If he needed something to make sure that what had happened that night had been real, it had happened a few hours later, as the sun was rising over the horizon, and Bucky slammed the door wide open and startled the two of them out of their sleep with the loud thud of his bag.
“Did Natasha really hit you,” he said looking at nothing but Steve’s hand in his, he didn’t know what to believe, but he knew that Steve wouldn’t just sit out in the cold for who knows how long just to break things off with him. “I mean she could have stabbed you, she has knives.”
They had to take the campus shuttle towards where Steve’s house was, this was something that Tony hadn’t known, mainly because Steve was almost always nearby so Tony had assumed that his place was within walking distance. But he also knew that Steve had a car so most likely he drove towards campus and at times went out of his way to make sure that Tony got home safe from the library. It was things like this that Tony knew they needed to talk about, because even though they talked they didn’t talk about the mundane things in their lives. He wanted to know more about Steve Rogers, for some reason he craved it, but it also scared him.
“Well,” Tony said averting his eyes before they landed on the little box on the bedside table. “I was going to bring this up with you earlier this week, but you just had to be an asshole and jump in the way during that fight.”
“They’re asleep in his room,” she said to him her hands nervously moving to fix something around her. “They’ve been there all night, from the moment I told them that I was going to drag their father kicking and screaming back to the states.”
“Yeah, and I don’t much care for it, but we need to give the others some time to dig themselves out,” he told the god who nodded at him.
“Shut the front door,” Bruce said startling Thor out of his nap, the god smacking his head on the table. “Sorry Thor... sorry,” he murmured
Steve knew that while those kids weren’t biologically his, that he wouldn’t trade them for the world, superheroing ran in the family, it was bound to happen that the kids would follow suit, especially with two of them sporting actual powers, and a genius in their midst. Before he could say anything else, because the one thing that the kids had agreed to were secret identities if they ever used their powers, the small group that joined them started to come in. They were there to tell their stories, to talk about their lives, to find some way to move forward.
“It’s the same and yet different at the same time,” she said as she broke it down and went over it piece by piece. “I don’t understand why though.”
“Why did you wait until now to tell me this,” Tony said not wanting to fear the worse about why Steve hesitated to talk to him.
“Boss, Thanos is here,” Friday said over the com and Tony could feel his heart stop, time really was messing with them and it had brought a blast from the past with it.
“I like you too Tony,” he said to him, and Tony started crying, he wasn’t sure why, it could have been the stress from his everyday life, or everything that had happened recently. “Don’t cry Shellhead.”
“Cap,” Tony said, which meant that something had gone wrong since Tony wasn’t calling him by his name. “We got a problem.”
“Maybe it doesn't need to be done,” he tells her, knowing that maybe it was time that they let go of the life that held them to the Avengers.
“How’s it going cyborg princess,” he said to her, a reminder of their trip, a reminder of when they became a family. Even though she didn’t say anything, her arms came up around him and held on. It was her way of showing affection, without saying anything, it was her way of saying
“Thanks for the pep talk, pissant,” Tony rolled his eyes at Steve, which meant that he was annoyed by Scott’s questioning. “You trust me?”
The kid’s name, Miles Morales, and he hit it off with Steve, both of them from Brooklyn, both of them had a love for art, and honestly both of them were troublemakers, who had started a war against the girls, all the while Tony watched and made sure that they didn’t hurt themselves too badly. Miles, was like Peter in many ways, including the powers, which threw Tony for a loop, because how could there be two kids with the same powers in such a short amount of time, and how had these infected spiders gotten out. Tony just filed it away as another coincidence, and just watched the kids as they got along with one another.
“Look, us sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So, this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty,” Thor answered, and Tony knew this was more for the man to make amends to himself for what happened five years ago.
“I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?” Howard asked him and Tony almost wanted to shake the man and scream at him for letting someone from Hydra into SHIELD.
“She’s right Tony, it will be healthy for all of us to get through this by talking, maybe Sam could do it if this time travel heist works,” Steve said while slowly rubbing circles around Tony’s back. Tony who was still pouting leaned into his touch.
“We’re on it,” Kamala said her voice cheery, especially when they’re faced with the end of the world. It was all he needed to get up and keep fighting.
“Over the weekend, while I was agonizing over whether to run and find you or listening to everyone else and what they had to say about the whole thing, well I sat down and read everything you wrote, it wasn’t that hard to find either because no one out there would write so much about a character that didn’t exist in the comics my dad created.”
“Don’t go,” he called out, stopping the other man from leaving before they even said something remotely normal to one another. “Sorry, it’s just that, well you’ve given us all of this free publicity,” that was a stupid thing to say. “And I just want to thank you for it,” because honestly, he thought the whole thing was a joke. “So, if you don’t mind, do you want to have some coffee,” as if he didn’t get the stuff for free. He really couldn’t keep up with the internal monologue in his own head.
“Tony,” Steve pulled him close as he said his name, wrapping his arms around Tony in a half hug that made his heart beat in a different way than the feeling he was having from the almost panic attack, it was good to have a distraction. “Maybe that event shaped your life, maybe it made you more wary of people, but it made you want to be who you are now, think of the things that you want to do in your life, of the things you have done.”
“Well let's hope that the post brings in more people,” he said pushing his thoughts and their conversation aside.
Steve shook his head before walking towards the machines and getting to work, “It’s on me,” he said with a smile, which had way too much power over him.
“Listen, if you think it was a date, then it was,” Steve told him as they walked in. “If the other person hadn’t realized it well tough for them.”
“Maybe, or just maybe the whole team, you called them the Avengers before, and I think that maybe that’s what was missing in his life, a team.”
The armies from Zandar, and the Ravengers came from one of the portals, Duranna and her father heading one of the groups. More and more people he hadn’t known would show up suddenly appeared, Valkyrie flying out on a Pegasus, along with Sif and the rest of Asgard’s warriors. The Wakandan army walking through, he could see Bucky looking at him, a sad look on the man’s face, which meant that Natasha hadn’t come back. Steve wasn’t sure how Bucky knew, but he would have to ask later about it. Next to Buck was Groot, who had landed next to Rocket, just as Wanda walked out, stunned to see Vision standing there next to them.
Honestly, Steve was pacing, he watched as Tony’s professor walked Tiberius to the Dean’s office leaving Tony in the room. He knew that Tony would be nervous, but what they talked about he wouldn’t know outside of what he overheard. Steve was glad that Tiberius would be getting some form of punishment, he knew how much it had hurt Tony to have part of his work stolen, they hadn’t discussed it much but when they had he saw the hurt in Tony’s eyes. He would have punched the guy if it hadn’t been for Tony, not that he didn’t deserve it, especially when Stone’s family used Tony’s connections to S.I. as a way to get in with the company.
“Hello Captain Rogers,” Vision said looking over at Steve. “It is good to see that you two have reconciled.”
“Call me Pepper, and yes I do, I wouldn’t be one of his closest friends if I didn’t,” she said to him and he nodded, there was so much of his past that was intertwined with Tony’s and he hadn’t even known that much. “Just so you know, he’s a good guy, his parents wanted him to take over the company, and they’ve been grooming him towards it, but he fought them tooth and nail just so that he could teach part-time, he loves teaching and his students are always interning at Stark Industries because of it too. They’re all very bright, but there had always been one place where he had never stepped back from, and his mother knows this because he once told her, when he had been twelve, that he was going to end up with you.”
“Mom,” he called out only to see her head pop out of the den, a smile on her face as she walked out with her hand on her belly, his father not far behind. Steve knew it was because he was worried, but his mother would always do what she wanted as long as her boys were all taken care of.
“Steve, what if trying to fix everything brings more problems? What if trying to change what happened costs us what we love the most?” he didn’t say it, but he was afraid that even Steve would leave him, if they tried to change everything.
“Like you’re one to talk,” she said and laughed at the redness rising on his neck. She knew for a fact that he still hadn’t done anything with Steve, he had told her that he wanted to wait just a little longer. Steve had been okay with it as well, so most of the time she just found them cuddling on the same bed from the year before, because instead of moving in with Steve, Tony had decided to stay in the same room as Bucky.
“I didn’t really, I just knew that there was something bigger that we had to deal with, I know you and Tony have your issues, hell Tony’s issues could fill three hundred books and still not be enough, but I knew that we needed to start somewhere,” he said to Steve and he knew that it was the truth. “Honestly speaking, you two can’t function without the other, the fighting was inevitable, but in the end you both end up gravitating towards one another.”
“But it’s not verified, we all thought that it was fake,” he still did, he was hallucinating this whole encounter.
The next chapters will deal with the team remembering things, not as strongly as Tony and Natasha though, as we get closer to the first step in the fight against Thanos, and what happens as a result of Tony's snap.
“You want me to wear your stuff... is this a kink or something? Because I haven’t taken anything from you at all, I tend to steal Rhodey’s sweaters all of the time because they’re huge he’s like almost as tall as you and is in his school’s ROTC but he’s going into the air force so he’s huge compared to me,” Tony told him, it was the honest truth, because Tony was a little on the shorter side, and all of his friends had always been taller, he always stole their sweaters. He had poor blood circulation at times and was always cold, plus Rhodey’s sweaters were always longer so Tony used them as blankets.
“You hang out around me too much, because you’re starting to sound like a smart person... I don’t like that, go be the artist you are, because if you become rational then I’ll have to actually eat my vegetables and be responsible, and I don’t want that.”
“It’s alright,” Steve said smiling. “If you want, we’re going out to dinner later, you can join us,” smooth Rogers, really smooth, you’re supposed to distance yourself not ask him out. He wasn’t sure if it were possible to yell at himself in his own head but apparently it was happening.
He hadn’t noticed that he had fallen asleep until he had woken up in a completely different room, and he wasn’t in his regular clothes. Man, he really hated hospital gowns, they were so revealing and scratchy and stupid, and they probably had him on something strong because his head felt light, and he could swear that Steve was glowing.
Now that he was out of the house though, he had made a promise to his mother that he would work on his social skills. But Tony was notorious for staying away from people and hiding away in a lab, or on his laptop, his mother was glad that Natasha would be close by to pull him out of that deep hole of a life. They lived in the same building, though Nat lived one floor above him on the girl’s floor, so it was easy to move into the dorms, Loki and Clint helping Nat, while Thor helped Tony. When they were all moved in, the Stark siblings went to eat at one of the local Italian restaurants, they needed to know that it was legit Italian, their mother wouldn’t have it any other way. Once they finished, Nat went to her dorm to meet her roommate who was a close family friend, and Tony well he sat alone in his own room, not sure of what to do next.
“Thor put him in the office in the back,” Steve kneeled down next to Tony who was now bleeding heavily from his nose. “And stay with him until the cops come,” he really shouldn’t have stayed in the back for as long as he had. “Nat, Bucky’s in the back, can you get him to cover the front door for Thor, and also call an ambulance for Tony.”
“It’s not, I’ve seen how happy she is, well at least the little amount of time I’ve seen her, I’ve been a little busy.”
“I can’t believe you made me think that you were getting a triple B.A.,” James said pointing at the article that Natasha had read from. “I feel like I should complain to the school for sticking me with a know it all roommate.”
“Are you glad you made him into Vision now, even though he’s currently laying in that cradle, not moving, and with the possibility of him never coming back,” she said but he also knew that it had to do with the possibility of everyone they cared for never coming back.
“Oh well, I’m doing three different things, mechanical engineering, programming, and writing, well the writing is more for me, the others are because I like making things and it’ll prepare me for my future because of course I’m a Stark so I would have to work at the company when I finish up school,” he said rambling, but he could see the surprised look on his roommate’s face. “What too little?”
“Yes, and honestly I don’t know where to start Big Green, I really don’t know,” he sighed before sitting in the chair next to Bruce. “When I had to get here, when it was just me and Nebula, there was a million things to worry about, a million things to do, and now I feel a little lost about where I should start.”
“I created him, I guess as a way to put myself in the same world as Captain America,” Tony said sitting at his desk, looking up at the image of the metal man.
“They say that the body changes once every seven years, so maybe your body just did what it had to for you to get to where you are.”
When they pull up to the Hospital, “I live near here, I wonder if Thor would want to meet my parents today too,” Bruce says as Tony starts to get out.
“Natasha,” Steve called out as he walked in. “Don’t threaten the man, trust me I’m sure that Tony’s lawyers would be enough to keep him out of here and anywhere else for a very long time.”
“But would you be able to rest?” Steve asks him, looking into his eyes, and Tony knows that he wouldn’t. Shaking his head, feeling as if he had already lost everything.
“Look...It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you you're in no condition right now to do this,” Tony told him. “Thor, you need time to calmly think about this and that’s something we don’t have.”
“I have a library date with one of my classmates from writing class, so I won’t be in the way tonight,” Tony said to them before heading towards the door, making Steve wish that he could try and say something. “I’ll see you later.”
“We should at least discuss it,” Scott said looking at Thor, while Hope watched the interaction from his side.
“No, I’m not,” Steve said in his defense, he didn’t want to go to that stupid party. “Bucky’s going, I’m actually going to go home and sleep since I have tomorrow off for once.”
“The plan,” Tony said while giving Steve an apologetic look, “Is to essentially give me a heart attack.”
“Oh, hello,” Bruce said holding his hand out. “It’s good to meet you, Thor’s been telling me about some of your projects at school, especially the miniaturized arc reactor project that you’ve started.”
“Wait, the only deal I’ve heard about recently was with Viastone, I heard mom on the phone with Thor, they were talking about the whole thing, mainly because Thor tells mom everything, and he doesn’t like the deal, they’ve been in talks for a while now, dad wants it to go through but Thor says that the whole thing doesn’t feel right.”
“Hello,” his mother’s voice came over the phone. “Boys stop fighting already and go do your homework.”
Deep in his own thoughts he had almost missed what Steve had said only catching the tail end of the words. Steve had repeated it after Tony had explained that he was a little confused about what was happening. Mainly because he couldn’t get out of his head long enough to listen to anyone, especially when the failure was one that would haunt him.
“Fine whatever,” Tony said throwing his hands up in the air, which in all honesty was the worse idea because it only made his chest hurt more. “How’s our new guest?”
“I wasn’t really looking,” he said which was the truth, he had been looking for something more up to Tony’s standards and ended up finding the fixer upper instead. “I guess we just needed something to do for a little while.”
“'Cause I got some important shit going on here. What do you think?” he said without thinking.... he was in so much trouble. “I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.”
“Hey, homie!” Rocket said as he walked out of the ship. “Where’s Big Green?” Tony couldn’t help but smile, mainly because even when he wasn’t hulked out, Bruce was still Big Green to the raccoon, who had saw the man as a friend.
Peggy stood stock still for a moment, Steve saw her reach for her weapon, but when her eyes settled on Steve she stopped, her eyes wide. “Steve,” she said and it felt like the whole world stopped.
“We all are,” Steve said to him the blushing Captain gone. “We’ll find him don’t worry, until then we just have to stick together.”
“No, I wrote most of it, you just cleaned it up for me,” Ty was defending himself against all of the work that Tony had done on a story they had both worked on. “Tony, you’re a good writer and I’m glad you helped me, but this is my story.”
“No,” Scott answered but Tony knew that it was a lie, the whole plan screamed of something Peter would have thought up, which sent a sharp pain right into his heart.
The laugh was stuck in his chest, he didn’t want to laugh, and he was trying really hard not to, but he knew of only one person who worked there that would want to go with Clint to anything wrestling. It was the same reason why he had to fix a broken shelf the other day, which was the reason why he got to talk to Tony in the first place, but he still couldn’t help the laugh that was bubbling up inside of him.
“So,” Steve said after five minutes had passed, Tony could see the unholy glee in Steve’s eyes, because he knew that they were right, and Tony would have to tell him.
“Well I had a right to freak out, I wouldn’t have been able to see you or Cassie, and I didn’t want to go back to jail, I had just gotten my life back together.”
Steve couldn’t help but sigh, he was weak when it came to Tony, “Fine, we’ll go to Mr. Fury's flower shop.”
“Come with me,” she said before she led them to where Thor was standing, he was with Bruce and the two of them were talking to a few of the workers, all the while Thor was swinging their joined hands back and forth. Tony felt bad because he knew why his mother had looked for Thor and not anyone else, he had the fastest car out of all of them, Clint only had a motorcycle his girlfriend had driven them, and Loki was a little preoccupied with their father.
“Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him,” Scott said running his hands through his hair.
“Okay, I’m going inside the core area now,” Scott told him as Tony saw Alexander Pierce walk up to the 2012 Avengers.
“Seriously,” Tony said looking at his roommate. “How blindsided have you been, the two of you have been going on dates for the last month, I know because you always come here with that doofy grin on your face.”
So, he sat there in the library, working on one of his stories, thinking about Iron Man and Captain America, and wondering about the possibilities of him meeting someone named Steve Rogers who looked like the comic book character. That had been a one in a million shot, he couldn’t get lucky twice and have that guy fall for him too. It didn’t help that his characters were now starting to look more like him and Steve, but it didn’t matter, Steve wasn’t a fan of Captain America anyway so there was no point in thinking too much about it, even though the image of Steve in the Captain America uniform was very appealing.
There was something about walking over the rubble of something you built that made this whole thing a little too real. Tony had all but crawled out of Afghanistan fifteen years before, he was a different man, he became a husband and a father, he had saved the world countless times. But seeing their one failure sitting there in front of him, just brought forth a million feelings, and so many losses. He couldn’t stand to think of it happening all over again.
“Thank you Shuri,” he said with a small smile. “You have my notes to get started, if anyone asks, I’m going to take them to Pepper’s, I’ll be back soon.”
Tony shrugged his shoulders before getting out of the car and heading towards the trunk. “That’s the EPR paradox,” he said ignoring Steve’s question, because he knew that his husband wasn’t incline to hear the complete story. “Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might’ve wound up pushing time through Lang. It’s tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should’ve cautioned you against it.”
When Tony finally came out of the room, Steve was relieved, especially with the smile that Tony had on his face, it was a smile that Steve loved, but that was because he was falling for Tony, and would do almost anything to keep that smile on his face.
“Sure, thing Honey buns,” Tony said, and Steve couldn’t help the flare of jealousy that came over him at the moment, just from hearing a nickname. He shouldn’t be jealous, but then again, this man had something that Steve couldn’t ever really have, he hated himself for feeling that way. “Steve, this is my bestest friend, or at least one of them, James Rhodes, but I call him Rhodey.”
“I don’t have anything,” he answered knowing that he had to get something else to eat now that his roommate had scarfed down his breakfast and head off to his room just so he could go to the robotics lab. “I’ll see you later,” he called out to Bucky before rushing to get a bagel and another cup of coffee and running off towards the dorm for his backpack.
Riri’s godmother, was Natasha, who taught her combat skills that she could use as self-defense. Natasha knew that Riri was away a lot for school, and she didn’t want anything to happen to the girl that had brought Steve and Tony closer together. Steve wondered if Riri’s godfather would have been Bucky if he had survived. He knew more than anything that Natasha was struggling to keep the Avengers together, trying to find a way to help everyone to the point where it was consuming her.
“Also, you have to stay in that bed for the rest of the day,” Rhodey said which made him groan. “I know you hate it, but the Hulk broke two of your ribs, and while I know that you think that you’re invincible Tones, you’re not so stay put.”
“No Tony, you were down there since yesterday afternoon,” Pepper said giving him a look that he only knew about when she was angry at him for working too hard. “So, after you both eat, you’re going to bed, and neither one of you can say otherwise.”
“Okay,” he said his voice a little quieter, he knew that he was on the spot now, he knew that he was holding onto hope somewhere in his heart. Taking a deep breath, he continued on with the story.
When they arrived, NAF looked like another world, Tony helped with the upkeep, but he never came back to the facility, it felt like the place where his greatest wishes and his greatest fears had come to life. It was like coming home after being away for a long time, but the grounds were barely upkept, and the darkness of the early morning made it feel like it was another world altogether.
“Nat is adopted, all of my siblings are, plus she likes to hide from the press sometimes, and when she doesn’t want you to know who she is she damn good at it too,” he told him. “I guess she just wanted a moment where her every move she made wasn’t being scrutinized.”
“You like talking about the things you create,” Steve told him, and Tony could feel him smile against his hair, as his breathing changed. “I noticed it when you first started talking about your story, the first time I asked you to tutor me, it’s actually nice to see someone so passionate about something.”
“And what do you have planned for us now that you have me all tied up with no where to go?” Steve asked before pushing his pelvis up to meet Tony’s ass, and my god he wasn’t going to survive being in control tonight, because even tied up Steve had all the power over him.
Every once and a while Steve could swear that Thor’s powers were manifesting nearby as the crackle of lighting hit the skies above. They were all hurting from this, but Thor was trying to think differently about what had happened, swearing that there would be a way to get her back. Steve knew it had to do with Bruce’s reaction to Nat’s death, they had all been close, but those two had learned to live in a world all their own and losing their friend was a hard thing to have happen. They had all been doing so well until this happened and Steve hated it, he hated that whenever they got somewhere, or found some form of happiness the universe saw fit to throw a wrench in their path.
Tony hummed as Steve led him to the bed, slowly making him sit down so that Steve could take off Tony’s shoes and lay him down. Steve couldn’t help but smile when Tony sent him a quick wink before yawning again. It took some work on Steve’s part to help Tony get ready for bed, as the genius was flopped over half asleep already. He quickly took off Tony’s jeans and almost laughed when he saw the Captain America boxers that Tony had on, before tucking him into the bed.
Steve was smiling at him, almost like Tony had given him something that he had never had before, a family for Captain America. It was something that Tony hadn’t known that he had wanted to see, maybe it was because Steve had lived all of his life with the knowledge that his father had created something for him and then put all the pressure on his own son to live up to that. He could just be projecting his own issues with his father, but that’s something he didn’t want to go too far into.
He was leaving it up to Tony, not wanting to rush into anything too quickly and ruining what he was sure had happened in the middle of the night. He rushed off without telling Tony where he was going, and he regretted it the moment he got into his car and drove off, sending Tony a message was not an option while driving and he was already running late, so it would have to wait until at least lunch time, but now he wishes that he hadn’t run off like he had. It had been a stupid move on his part, and hopefully Bucky would cover his mistake. He didn’t want to lose something he barely had.
It was that time of the week, where Steve went to check on Natasha, she refused to give up working, even after him and Tony had settled down, oftentimes talking to the new Avengers, wherever they were. Steve knew that he was going to have to pull her away from the job one day, but he knew just how hard it was for her, the guilt was consuming her at this point. Steve couldn’t make himself speak up as she sat at the table making herself a sandwich while talking to those that they knew who were scattered around the universe. It was still a strange concept for him, even after the trip to the planet that Thanos had been on, that they could have universe-wide communications.
“Oh, it's just a book,” he said but Tony grabbed it and turned it over, seeing yet another history book.
“Morag’s a planet, it’s located in the Andromeda Galaxy at the Eclipsing Binary Star, it’s mostly oceanic, and they have these little annoying rodents that get into everything,” Rocket answered Scott, which only made Tony curious because there was so much out there that he could study. “Quill is a person,” he said as an afterthought.
“Yesh,” he said before pulling out his phone, he remembered the night before how Steve had looked at the thing in awe, mainly because it was the only one of its kind, Tony had made it for himself alone because he hated the way most smartphones looked. Tony pressed a couple of buttons before the screen lit up with the call and handed it over to Steve, who was even more surprised when Pepper’s face popped up.
“Someone peed my pants,” Scott said looking down to see if it was coming out of the suit. “But I don’t know if it was “baby” me or “old” me... or just “me” me.”
“Yeah well, like you, my dad started to put more of my own life into the comics, Bucky is the Winter Soldier, my friend Sam is the Falcon, things like that, but the Winter Soldier story came from the year that Bucky and I broke up, I had been really heart broken, so my dad who already had issues with my relationship with Buck, turned the story into that.”
There he was sitting in the hospital waiting room, wondering how everything had gotten out of hand so fast. It had been a regular day he had been thinking about whether that dinner with Tony had been a date or just what it was dinner. People were buying books, and everything was going smoothly, he had even taken the time to look at one of those books his college roommate Clint had told him to. Apparently, Steve was bad at flirting according to everyone, but that still didn’t explain how he was now waiting for Tony to get an x-ray because a customer had elbowed him in the face. It was just supposed to be a normal day, one where he took the chance to actually ask Tony out on a day.
“It’s just something I invented, though it’s not as strong as the one I gave you earlier,” Steve told him with a shrug. “I want to make sure you go to sleep after this.”
“No problem, I’ll see you around, maybe I could get you to read some of your stories to me,” he said before waving at Tony and walking away. It was nice, at least he thought it was, that him and Steve could actually start being friends.
“Both of Captain Rogers legs seem to have fractures and will need to be bound before he attempts to walk, he also has a slight concussion, as well as five bruised ribs sir,” JARVIS answered him showing Tony the scans on the suit’s HUD.
“Anyway,” she said looking between Miles and Steve. “You already know her... I mean... well Miles was the one who introduced us, but for now we want to keep it quiet, because it’s new.”
At that Rhodey looked to the ground, if it were possible for the man to want to hide, it was at that moment, “She’s fine, we caught up a little, there’s a lot to unpack.”
“They’ll be fine, and you’ll be fine as long as you don’t fake any more heart attacks, plus they can come home on weekends, and we still have Morgan here.”
When they reached the waiting room, Tony was a little disappointed, Steve wasn’t there yet, and from the look on Natasha’s face, Bucky was missing as well. Rhodey was standing in a corner with a tall blonde, next to him were Pepper and May, who were both smiling. He saw Sharon with Aunt Peggy, along with Sam Wilson, Steve’s roommate and one of the people involved in that whole misunderstanding, though he was glad that everything had worked out for all of them.
“That I am,” Steve said before licking his way up Tony’s chest, before settling on Tony’s nipple and sucking it into his mouth. It took Tony a minute to realize that while Steve had taken his ring off, Tony’s was still very much on and it was very tight all of a sudden. “I still have your special vibratory in my ass, I wonder if you can feel it in yours.”
“Really, but you have all of these,” Steve pointed at all of the pictures, “Are these from people who admire your work?”
“Why Thor? I mean it’s great and all, but why him. The whole coincidence with him and Bruce is one thing.”
Tony sat there for five minutes, having a weirdly structured debate in his head about the merits of seeing Steve, versus finishing his project. Things like, he needed a break, he needed to eat, and maybe seeing Steve would recharge him. But also, the doom and gloom in his head over whether he would finish the bot in time, because the project was worth more to him than most people thought. He had ignored his fiction writing project, not finding the energy to actually work on it at the moment, not as all of his projects started piling up on top of one another.
“I don’t want to know, but listen you, if you ever do something stupid like you did the other day, I won’t be so nice.”
“Miles I have your dad for that,” Tony answered keeping his eyes on the road, he wanted them somewhere safe, nowhere near where they were in case something happened.
Ty smiled at him as if Tony had given him the keys to the world and Tony couldn’t help but blush, it was nice to not be a Stark for once. “I’ll see you there,” Ty said before Tony waved him off and rushed off towards his next class.
Before Tony could say anything else Steve left, he didn’t want to overstay his welcome, hopefully he could find something that they had in common, something that Tony would feel comfortable talking with Steve about. He wanted to at least make it up to Tony, and become his friend if anything.
“Wait a minute, you mean to tell me that you’ve been hiding from me because of this?” she asked him.
It had been a suicide mission, it had been a ray of hope in all of the darkness, the chance to get everything back to the way it should be. Except now Steve hated the outcome, he hated Thanos, and if he had had the chance he would have taken the titan’s head himself instead of letting Thor do it. The thought that the mad man had destroyed the stones after using them to get his paradise, after taking away half of all living beings in the universe. He wasn’t sure what it should mean, what it could mean other than the fact that they no longer had hope for their own future. Vision was still in the cradle as far as they knew, they hadn’t heard otherwise from Tony on the way back. Everyone in the ship was morose in one way or another, none of them talking, Thor had left the ship twice before returning, Nat stayed quiet, and Steve had excused himself to throw up.
“Was he the reason you were acting like that,” Tony said pointing Ty out, who started walking further down the hall, and out of sight.
“Ouch,” Steve said Tony saw a bit of hurt in his eyes, there’s always going to be the possibility that their past relationship was going to be a factor, but Tony wasn’t going to think about that, he wasn’t in any kind of relationship with Steve, they were just friends.
The thought of not being able to bring them back, the thought of failing, was something he didn’t want to deal with, but he also knew that he needed to help her regardless of his own fears. He needed to be strong for those who were with them, but he didn’t know just how long that strength will last. They sat there and ate the food given to them, Tony looking at all the people he picked up, all the people saved, wondering why did they survive, why did he live.
“Yeah I do, one time on a date he took me to a field and set up a telescope to see some meteor shower,” Bucky said but Tony’s heart skipped a beat, that was something that he would have liked, he could see himself and Steve just making wishes on falling stars. “There was also that time in Junior year where we went into the city and he took me to some random Shawarma place, he swore that it was because we had never tried something like that.”
He could feel his knees buckle right before he threw up again all over the floor, they had messed up, not just him getting thrown across a room by the Hulk mess up but losing someone they loved. Nat who painted his toes when she wanted the right nail polish color, Nat who told him really crazy stories about Clint as a father, the woman who looked out for him when he ignores all medical advice, the one who had stabbed him in the neck just to give him more time.
There was a fine line between flirting and moping and Tony was on the border, mainly because he didn’t know what Steve wanted out of their date the other night. He really tried to read the other man, but even after hours of talking and walking around, the night just ended with Steve waving at him as he got into an uber. To top it all off Tony hadn’t slept much, and ended up oversleeping, so he couldn’t stop at the bookstore before his morning class for coffee. Which was just a lie, because it would have been a ploy to just see Steve and maybe try asking him on a second date. He wasn’t even sure if the guy was anywhere on any spectrum, but since they had talked about things Tony was almost certain that there was something there.
“I don’t understand half the things you say, I can remember all of it, but in the end,  I just like hearing you talk when you’re excited about something, but this, Tony this could fix everything, not just for us but for all the people that lost something that day.”
“I’ve got some here,” Steve said handing him a bottle as he placed the tray on the bed, “I’m not going to keep you plugged until tomorrow, I think I got a little too excited since we’ve been… well you know.”
“Yeah, we went to a paintball place last weekend, she creamed me,” Bucky answered with a smile almost as if being beating with little paint ball pellets by Natasha was some kind of foreplay, which honestly is shouldn’t be, he knew how much those things hurt. “I also liked watching her dance in the gym a few nights ago, and we went to an MMA fight too.”
“Got to hustle, Winghead,” Tony said as he watched them pack everything up. Tony couldn’t help but marvel at how much everything had changed since that moment.
“I know, but now is not the time to have a mini crisis, right now is the time to be the man I know you are and work with us to find a way to fix this.”
“I could just get the keys for the chalet in Aspen, my family hasn’t gone in a while and I’m sure my mom would be okay with us going,” Tony said smiling, “We could even ask to use the jet.”
“I know, your dad is just a little over protective of his boys, hell Bruce called earlier saying something about his boyfriend, who we still haven’t met, and Hank was dating some girl but that didn’t work out so much for him. Peter is talking to some girl named Michelle, and Harley... well I don’t know if Harley likes anyone at all.”
“Hot Tub Time Machine, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.”
“Shit,” he said reminding himself of the family he had, the little girl who was about to lose her father.
“Those are good teams, hopefully this will go the way it should,” Steve said to him before pulling a casserole pan out of the oven.
It was Tony rolling his eyes that go Steve’s attention, “No honeybear, just no,” Tony said but Rhodey ignored him, and continued his train of thought.
“If we do this, how do we know it’s gonna end any differently than it did before,” Bruce was still pushing, he was a scientist and Tony knew that he wanted all the variables, but Tony was losing patience with the questions, he felt guilty for being alive when Peter hadn’t lived and the Guardians hadn’t lived, when everyone that have been dusted from the snap had lost everything.
Do you know just how hard it was to put this together, because there’s so many more people alive now, so many people to move on the chess board, and thank you Thor for the people who are transcribing the movie script onto Transcript Wiki (https://transcripts.fandom.com/wiki/Avengers:_Endgame), because that helped sooo much you have no idea.
“No,” Tony said to him before looking down at the carpeted floor. “Listen have your moment, I’m not stopping you.”
“I want you to have this,” he said taking out his dog tags, the only thing he still carried around from his past. “I want you to give them back to me when I step off of that ship, just to remind me that I’m home.”
“Yes, but now, I guess seeing him through your eyes, I think I’m ready for something different, so read the rest,” Steve said and Tony knew that something in their relationship had shifted, because if Steve was trying to see everything from a different angle then that would mean that maybe, or at least Tony hoped, there would be something for them in the future.
“Yeah, actually it’s Anthony, so if you could suggest that name to your friend, maybe his wife won’t name him something weird,” Tony said and Peggy smiled at him.
“That’s not the worse part, his father told him to make friends with the Stark kid who was going to school here, I bet he didn’t know that the two of us were here,” Tony said knowing that because of that Natasha would already planning the guy’s demise. “His father got a deal with S.I. because of this, and I hadn’t known about any of it. The whole semester he used me without me knowing and I guess that’s what threw me.”
Deciding on not listening to them, mainly because they wanted to either attack his inability to get a haircut, he tuned out the conversation, not wanting to say anything about his roommate because they kept asking, and concentrated on mapping out the schematics of the artificial intelligence project he was going to use as his final project. He was going to implement a part of it on Butterfinger’s brother and if it worked, he would try and work on a full-scale model for himself. He still didn’t have a name for it but as long as he kept working on it, well it would be alright.
“Not really, I’m more amazed that you haven’t run screaming from me at this point,” Tony said, and Steve’s heart hurt to hear him say anything like that about himself.
“Really, that again, I swear Steve keeps asking me that too and it’s so stupid,” Bucky said before going off on a tirade about his scholarship and how he had wanted a single but there hadn’t been any. It was nice to learn more about his roommate, they talked about other things like Bucky’s job, and the girl he was crushing on, which made Tony laugh because he knew from the description that the guy was talking about Natasha and she would eat him alive. He wasn’t going to interfere, it was up to Nat to say yes or no, though Tony didn’t want to tell Bucky that it was his sister either, because if there was one thing that Tony wanted to avoid it was being in the middle of that.
Honestly Tony didn’t know what was going to happen, but he did send his story off to his professor. He named it The Young Dancer, it’s the best parts of his childhood, the ones where him and Nat grew up together, before the real pressure had set in. He changed a lot of the story, mainly because it was based on his life, but it’s a good piece. One that hadn’t been touched by Ty. It was mostly about that one night that Natasha had taught him to dance when they were kids, Tony remembered it because his father had yelled at him for trying to replicate Nat’s dance moves a few days earlier. It had been a magical night, and one that he didn’t share with anyone but her, but it was also a story that he had wanted to tell. He sent it to Natasha once it was done, and he got a smiley face back afterwards, she was his number one cheerleader, even if they haven’t hung out together much in the last few months.
It hadn’t taken Steve long to get away from the woman in the elevator, he was sure that they wouldn’t have enough time once she put two and two together, he was glad for one thing and that was the fact that the phones weren’t fancy like the ones that Tony had back at the house. He picked it up and called the extension for Hank Pym that he had found in a book on the side of the desk and called up the number.
Before Bucky could say anything, he walked out of the room, his bag on the ground, Tony was certain he had spent the night with Natasha, but he wasn’t going to touch that with a ten-foot pole, not at all. What his sister did in her own time was her business, especially since they’ve been spending less and less time together. He was taking too many classes, and she had her own schedule and a boyfriend to boot.
Steve turned to him and smiled. “In plain sight,” he said pointing at the suits who were clearly not soldiers moving towards what looked like an ammunitions bunker.
When the little girl popped out she put her hand up, because of course Steve had decided to show their little rugrat videos of her dads as heroes and like their other three kids, Morgan also wanted to be a hero as well. So she had a light on her hand, like it was his replusor gloves and pointed it up at him.
“Why do you hate him so much?” Tony asked him back, and Steve knew that he was going to have to give a little before Tony told him anything at all. “I mean Bucky said it was because you had been bullied over having the same name, but I can tell that there’s something else there.”
Steve couldn’t help but look at him dumbfounded by what he was saying. “What do you mean you blew up the TV?”
“Listen, I’m not going anywhere near what ever freaky things you’re planning on doing, I just came up here to see why James went downstairs grumbling about.”
When he woke up three hours later, Steve was missing and Tony’s ass felt full, it took him a moment to realize that Steve had used one of the bigger plugs and not their standard ones. His hands were free, although his wrists were red from being tied to the bed, he wondered where Steve had run off too, he was due to take his medication soon, and he was still healing. Though the majority of the healing had finished, Tony felt guilty for doing what he had done.
“We just want you all to be safe about this,” and it was the most truthful thing that Steve could say to his own kids.
“Don’t worry too much,” Ms. Potts voice came in from behind him walking in with two cups of coffee, “He’s had worse.”
“What do you mean?” Steve was honestly confused but it’s been a very trying time for all of them, so he didn’t know what was up from what was down.
“Do I even want to know how you five all fit in there?” he asked as they all tried to recover from the fall. “Or better yet why you’re all here in the first place?”
“I love you too,” Tony said holding Steve as tight as he possibly could. “Would you change anything if you could?” he asked knowing how much pain Steve had gone through, even if Steve thought about it, going through the whole man out of time thing, he wouldn’t change anything either.
Even with his wish to go to bed and actually sleep, it had been a week of first classes, and a tired Tony, because his roommate came in at all hours of the night, the guy worked part-time at one of the restaurants off campus, so he also smelled like freshly baked bread for some reason. Tony usually got a few hours of sleep in before his roommate came in a jarred him awake by kicking down the door as he came into the room, and because Tony is the kind of person that once he’s up he can’t go back to bed, well the whole thing messed with his already lacking sleep schedule. So, he was happy when Thursday came, and his first writing course was well on its way. Because he wore contacts and was well groomed when he took press photos with his family, no one in class or the school knew he was the same Tony as his public persona. Blame it on his unruly hair, and the glasses, he’s was blind without them, and though his mother and sister had both told him that he could get Lasik eye surgery, Tony had a thing about people putting needles or knives of any kind near his eyes. He was now very grateful for having to wear them, people didn’t point at him, hell the only person who had realized it was him was James, or Bucky as he liked to be called.
Bruce and Shuri started pressing buttons, Steve wasn’t sure what any of it did, at this point everything was to test one theory or another.
“Good for Uncle Rhodey, now go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys,” he said knowing the lie wouldn’t phase her. “Night, night.”
“I bet, and thanks for the present,” Steve’s eyes landed on the foot of the bed where the vibrator was now sitting. “It was nice of you to think of me.”
“Oh, yeah,” he answered trying very hard not to have a flashback, as he saw his father standing in front of him.
“Actually yes, because James and I have a very normal relationship, on that involves communication and actual flirting.”
“Sorry,” Tony said looking down at his eggs, not sure if he actually wanted to eat them, his stomach a little uneasy.
“Yeah well, she’s five, what's your excuse?” Riri said as she walked in Kamala, Pepper and Happy right behind.
Natasha looked over at him surprised by this, “And if James was going to drive down with Steve it means he’s there as well.”
When Tony’s eyes became droopy, and he had fallen asleep, Steve breathed a little easier, it was hard to function when the person you liked was talking like that. After the conversation with Ms. Potts, Steve had kept an eye on Tony, she had said that they were going to need to keep this out of the press until the official story was out. Steve still worried, not only about Tony, but also about the store, especially since he had left so quickly and now with everything that was happening.
“Good, just as long as we are all in agreement,” Thor said as the lighting engulfed him illuminating the area around them. Out of the rubble came Thor’s axe Stormbreaker, and Mjölnir, Thor now clad in full armor. “Let’s kill him properly this time.”
“Funny,” Steve said groaning as he got up. “What happened? Are the kids okay, Carol was yelling earlier.”
If Shuri’s call had been a warning, what was about to happen was a full-on storm, and he wasn’t ready for it at all. Sending Morgan into the house with her sisters, he watched Scott told him what he had learned from the Quantum Realm, as Hope chimed in, as Steve looked at him worriedly, Nat’s face not betraying much. They already knew what was going on, and Tony’s not sure how he feels about it.
After that, he had made it a habit to show up at the store every other day, he read faster than most people anyway, and he was always going to need a book. Though he had restricted himself to only one book for every visit, or just coffee if nothing caught his eye. He tried not to always take pictures of Steve, he didn’t want to feel like a stalker, he really didn’t, but that weird childhood crush had come back with a vengeance and he couldn’t help himself. Luckily for him, Bruce would be there with him most days, they would take a table and order coffee just to grade papers, or talk about their classes.
“We can snap our own fingers,” Natasha said, and Tony knew that it was he way of getting something she lost back, he wasn’t sure what, he never really asked what she had lost, or who it had been. “We can bring everyone back.”
“Shit,” she said again and Tony wanted nothing more than to hit his own head against the table. Steve was going to kill him.
There was a brief moment where something flickered in Tony’s eyes, Steve wondered if it was the fact that Sharon had been the one that he had seen with Steve, but then there was something in Sharon’s eyes as well before the two of them were smiling.
“Fine... fine,” he grumbled pushing her off and getting off of his newly comfortable bed, “But I need to go to the bathroom first, so give me a few minutes.”
“Yeah but it’s worth it,” Steve smiled through the worried look on his face. “Hulk feel free to smash if things along the way.”
Honestly Steve didn’t know what to think, the swelling on Tony’s nose had gone down after they had fixed him up and give him some medication, he wasn’t stuffed up anymore either, but what they had given him had been very strong if the other man was talking like this. Just hearing that Tony had liked him when he had been twelve, which would have made Steve fourteen was something else. He had been a scrawny kid, his asthma had kept him from doing a lot, but at sixteen he had grown out of it and hit a growth spurt at the same time.
“I know, he’s too good to try anything else, trust me we never got past kissing and maybe the occasional groping session, his mother would have castrated me if I had done anything to her boy,” Bucky let out a shiver that frightened Tony a little, he was afraid that Steve’s parents wouldn’t like him, that they would think he’s just like Bucky or something. “Don’t worry Mama Rogers would love you, she always said that Steve would end up with someone special, and honestly no one is more special that the youngest son of the Stark Family.”
They stood there, Bruce introducing his boyfriend, who also happened to be a Stark, to his family, and Steve couldn’t help but think just how small the world really was. Even as his father called them into the room to introduce his sisters to the world, knowing in the back of his head how his father was already thinking of creating characters for them.
“I know, trust me, I’ve been thinking about this since Scott and Hope showed up, it’s a lot to think about,” Steve said as he held onto Tony’s waist. “Trust me the thought of going through all of that again, the Civil War, Ultron, me lying to you, any of it, it hurts. But we have to think about it because we can’t let people lose everything and not give them the chance to get it all back.”
“Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?” Tony said looking at the soldiers in front of them, the people milling about. “I mean that would have made the whole boy from Brooklyn thing a lie.”
“Good to go,” Tony said and Hulk huffed out for a moment before turning to the glove. Bruce must have told him about what was happening at some point because the Hulk didn’t even flinch.
Morgan Stark-Rogers' favorite pair of shoes were light up sneakers, they were cheap, and if Tony had his way they’d be in the trash just because they made what Tony dubbed and unholy screeching sound. The shoes were never thrown out, even with the threat constantly being made, but it was one of those things that Tony endured for his family, just like Steve’s need to draw in the lab, even though he had a studio. Miles’ need to tag up half of New York, even though Tony would have to pay the fines. Riri’s weird obsession with making her father into an A.I., which Tony found creepy and weird, but didn’t stop her. And Kamala’s need to follow Carol and Rhodey around like they were her gods, because Tony hadn’t expected to not be his kid’s favorite anything.
“Let me work on it and come back in an hour, hopefully I can fix it and add to it as well,” he told him pushing Ty off of him and towards his cart before turning to the notebook, as he turned on his computer.
“I don’t anymore,” Bruce said looking at him. “Remember I told you about how Thor was coping with everything, well in the end he also helped me learn more about myself and about the Hulk. We’re not the same, we would never be, but we’re together in all of this, we’re like brothers except we share a single body. So, I learned, and left thing for him to learn, in the end what happened was a coexistence of a kind. I let him out more, he stopped trying to take over, we learned to be.”
“You remember... everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years,” Tony explained to him.
“We got really lucky,” he said and Tony knew this, even after everything they’ve been through over the years, they had gotten really lucky in finding each other.
Unfortunately for Tony, he couldn’t implement his plans because Pepper had shown up and dragged him away to his office in the tower. The office was a part of Stark Industries’ administrative floors, and thirty stories down. He hadn’t signed or looked at any paperwork in weeks, not since the first of his toys had arrived. Mainly it was because he was busy with work for S.I. and the Avengers, but there was also a lot of him and Steve doing all kinds of things. That just so happened to be nearly three months of Tony neglecting his boring work, and Pepper had had it, and had JARVIS lock him into the office until he was done. Even locking his hidden exit behind the closet door, which sucked because he was sure that she hadn’t known about that particular exit.
So, he planned their date for Friday night while working, and he also planned on driving them to his parents on Saturday so that the next week, when Steve met Tony’s family, they would have already been through one introduction. Yes, Steve was nervous about meeting Tony’s family, but Natasha liked him, so it wouldn’t be that terrible... would it??? He couldn’t think about it too much, it would only make him nervous and then the whole thing would be a disaster.
“Give him some time,” Natasha added though from the look in her eyes, even she knew that it would take a lot for Tony to actually listen to him. This was that wrong place wrong time moment, and it broke his heart to think that he could have lost something good before it even started. “Steve, Tony’s been burned by people before, but if I have to sit him down and talk to him about this I will.”
“You look a little young to be here,” the guy next to him said as he pulled out what looked like one of those leather Barnes and Noble notebooks, the ones with the parchment paper that had that string around it. Tony had one like it filled to the brim with story ideas and codes for an artificial intelligence that he was developing, though the code was hidden in the stories because he didn’t trust his father enough after the man had patented something Tony had made as a Stark Industries design without Tony’s permission. The guy was giving him this smile as he pulled out his pen and a bottle of water.
Tony couldn’t help the smile on his face, he had always had girlfriends, even though he had known that he was bisexual since he was eight, he had had a crush on Rhodey before he thought better of it and just wanted to be friends, and they were better as friends than anything more, but this was the first time he was truly surprised at how much Steve being jealous over a sweater turned him on. It was stupid, and he really liked it, he took off Rhodey’s sweater and changed it for Steve’s, it was dark blue, with white lettering, but the red and white stripes on the sleeves made it all the better. It made it look like Captain America’s sweater, and Steve Rogers no matter how much he tried to deny it, was Captain America in a lot of ways.
“So, we keep it that way, we need a plan,” Steve already in captain mode and while Tony was happy about it, he knew it was a fool's errand.
The elevator only had one other occupant, and since Steve’s picture had been in the facility, Tony tried his best to shield his husband from being noticed too much. There was also the fact that he was a possessive son of a bitch, and having SHIELD find Steve standing right there in front of them would cause Tony to lose his husband.
Steve stopped a few feet short of his car and turned his attention fully on Tony, “Am I going to have to go after him?”
“I think we’ll be here for a very long time,” he answered, hoping that the owner of the building wouldn’t raise their rent too much in the next year.
“Yeah, but I don’t know... I feel a little jealous,” Steve told him, his face flushed with hints of pink, it was cute, and Tony’s heart did a little dance.
His eyes were closed when he walked into Tony’s room, but he figured that he could just sit there with him for a little while. Steve had brought some cookies that he had made as well as some books that he had his grandmother recommend, though why Tony Stark would read romance novels was beyond him, but his grandmother had insisted that it’s what they normally read. He put the books on the bedside table along with the cookies, they were shortbread and a little more on the sweeter side because he usually drank it with his grandmother’s tea, and he thought that Tony would appreciate it.
“How was that a win?” Steve said, his voice hitting a register that was normally saved for when either Tony or the kids did something stupid.
“Good job. I'm saved,” he said kissing her on the head, before turning to Nat, Hope, Scott and his own husband. “I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys,” he said to the other three. “it was... Oh, and table's set for nine.”
“No, not really, but on the way back she was late, James and I were well on our way before she appeared next to us all.”
“Heya Pops,” Miles said smiling from the table. “I hope the coffee came out right cause I’m never sure if I put enough in the pot.”
“Fucking hell,” Steve cried out as he chased the pleasure building up, Tony could feel it in the thrusts, but there was only so much release they were both going to find.
“So, I, uh...” she started, it was always hard when they had to share something that was truly intimate. “I went on a date the other day. First time, you know? Sit there, dinner... I didn't know what to talk about.”
“I left mine at home, mom is so strict about that rule that I hadn’t bothered to bring it at all,” she told him, she looked so calm, if it weren’t for the way she was gnawing on lip, he would think that everything was fine.
It was one thing to be reminded of that vision he had from Wanda all those years ago, but to see Steve in the rubble like this, it was bringing back some awful memories. “Steve,” he called out as he retracted the glove before reaching out to check Steve’s pulse, sighing when he felt the steady beat of the man’s heart. “Come on buddy, time to wake up.”
“No, it’s nothing like that, he just always saw the differences in the two of us, things that had been clouded for me because I only saw everything one way where as my dad saw everything at every angle, he had told me that one day Bucky was going to break my heart, and we fought over it and all, but he said that I had to make my own choices and let it go. The break-up happened, and I finally saw what my dad did,” Steve sighed as he told the story, Tony wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear any of it mainly because he was sure that Steve was still in love with Bucky. “And what my dad had seen was the fact that even though we had grown up together we both changed, we liked different things, like Buck likes to go out, you hear about him taking your sister out all of the time, but I prefer to be at home and watch movies. Buck is more of a free spirit in a way, he needs someone who moves like he does.”
She would too, and he knew it, for some reason their parents had indulged her in her love for knives and he couldn’t understand why. He knew it was because it meant that she could defend herself, but she when threatened him with bodily harm if he tried to get out of something then it was just going too far. His sister was a scary person sometimes and he never crossed her, not matter how tired he was because he valued his life.
“Yeah well keep it a little quiet, will you,” he felt his face flush at what Steve was saying. “I didn’t bring anything for anyone else... well except the bracelets, but we kind of need them for this little adventure. We’re getting everyone right?”
“I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?”
He sighed before leaning into his husband, “We’ll try, but the first thing we’re going to have to do is get everyone here, we’re not doing this alone, we need a team.”
“They’re our kids,” Steve said smiling as the family played around the yard, Kamala and Miles both getting ready for college. “You’ve done good with them.”
Steve wasn’t one who liked to be late for anything, he had been looking forward to this since Tony had told him about it. Of course, he was nervous, who wouldn’t be when meeting their boyfriend’s parents, but if Tony could get through meeting his crazy family, Steve could get through it as well. His bow had been tied by his mother as he had gotten ready, he had plenty of time to make it to the party, he was just waiting on Bucky. He should have known that life had another plan, nothing ever really went right when it mattered did it.
“Why is that thing so complicated, I don’t even know how to turn it on,” she said as she slid it into his pocket.
“I’m not all that certain about that,” Bruce said to her. “We’re not certain about anything if you think about it.”
“They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them,” Thanos answered and honestly that was going to be the reason why Tony shoved a boot up his ass.
“No one,” he answered but he knew that she knew that he was lying, especially when she was staring at him the way she was at that moment. “Fine, the first thing was that one of my stories for class wasn’t a hit with the professor, because I was dumb enough to give him one of my own fanfics, and then.... well my writing partner turned out to be an ass who made me do most of the work and then decided he was going to hand it in as his final project without giving me credit for the work.”
“I never knew that I would end up having a home for lost wayward kids, but they’re ours now and forever,” Tony smiled feeling like he was finally moving forward.
“Started it,” Tony lied, he didn’t want Ty to know that he was struggling to start at all. “How’s yours coming along.”
“J, blackout mode for the room, no one comes in or out until we’re finished,” Tony said as he ran his hand up Steve’s leg.
Bruce on the other hand just hit himself with the palm of his hand as if this was the worse way to bring it up. Instead he sighed and looked over at Thor, “Listen Thor, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about this.”
“Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?” he said wanting to scream out about the whole scenario, it was too much, he had too much to lose now versus what they had before.
“Mom and dad don’t hate you,” Harley said, all the while Peter was nodding as he pulled out a giant bag of marshmallows and some how hot dogs on a stick.
His roommate would arrive the next day, the freshmen had to be there on Friday, while everyone else moved in on Saturday, though Tony wasn’t sure why his roommate was a junior, but he took it in stride. He had three older brothers, he would survive a few months with his roommate, it wouldn’t be that bad. He didn’t really go to bed that night, the bed feeling too new, the room too bare, he spent the night putting up his Captain America art, as well as some Iron Man art that one of his readers had done for him. It had been strange at first, that someone had loved his stories so much that they had wanted to draw it. He had drawn a few renderings of the first armors, the ones mentioned, and then others had taken them and drew them with Captain America for him. Those were the ones he loved the most, and the ones that were sitting above his desk as he started the next chapter of his story, he wanted to finish writing it before the final volume was published in May.
“You thoogt ish was a date,” Tony said, and Steve could see the look of hope in the other man’s eyes, and he felt like kicking himself for not noticing earlier.
“Just make sure you dress warm,” Steve told him before giving him a quick kiss as he walked out of the dorm.
The majority of the buildings in Manhattan didn’t have fire escapes, not where they were anyway, hell Tony wasn’t sure which ones had them anymore, stupid glass buildings didn’t even have anything that Steve could have grabbed, and he had gone down like a sack of rocks. Of course, that was when Tony had had enough of the whole fight and blasted the motherfucker off of his freaking horse, it’s a literal floating fucking horse too, like this was some modern medieval fight. He charred the horse too because he wasn’t having it, all he wanted to do was get to Steve, let the others take care of bringing the asshole in.
Before Tony could say anything else, Miles landed next to them, pulling back his mask and looking at Peter, “I like the suit man,” Miles said with a smile.
Later on, after they had blown up the TV and DUM-E had used the extinguisher on them, Tony knew that he was going to be in trouble with Steve. The TV blowing up was an accident, and there was a spare one in the family room anyway, but Steve had told him to never upgrade anything in the house without him knowing first. Especially after the microwave copped an attitude with him and made his lunch explode.
“Are you suggesting that we have an intervention with a God,” Natasha said as she slid into one of the seats across from them. “Because if we are, then all of the Avengers are going to need some kind of therapy.”
“Hey,” Sharon called out smiling at Tony. “I haven’t seen you since your birthday party back in May,” she said to Tony.
Somehow without him realizing, he almost always attracted people with special powers, or potential beyond anything he could imagine, and it scared him. Not because he was always surrounded by people with special skills, but because the world around him was evolving to match the threats that they would possibly face in the future. So, on days when he thought too much about everything, mostly on days when Steve was at his group meetings with Miles, Kamala joining them on weekdays when Riri was at MIT, Tony found himself headed over to one of the orphanages that had cropped up after the decimation. He knew that if he could help those kids too, he could also heal himself a little more. He didn’t have to think too hard with the kids, he could have fun, and do silly things for a few hours.
Tony held himself back for a moment looking at Steve which made him feel self-conscience for a moment, before Tony said, “Thanks,” and walked into the room.
“You can’t just leave when you want to,” Lila yelled as the rest of the Avengers watched. “You have three kids, Nate’s never sure when you’ll be back, Uncle Tony and Uncle Steve shouldn’t be the ones taking care of us, that’s your job,” she was heaving, as she stopped, fresh tears in her eyes. “You weren’t even there for my first date, Cooper had to act like a dad is supposed to act, and it hurt.”
“Fine, but after I tell you this, you have to tell me your half of the story,” he said wondering if this would ruin what they had and not caring because he wanted to be honest with Tony. “My dad is Joseph Rogers, he had created Captain America for me, just like he had made Spider-man for my little brother, even creating characters for my other siblings, but for some reason Captain America had been his first real big break as an artist.”
“Exactly,” Nebula said in the way they had known her to be, short answers and to the point. Tony had once told Steve that it was just the way she was, she hadn’t had the chance to have actual conversations with people until recently, and when she was on mission for anything she wanted to get straight to the point so that they couldn’t deviate from their objective.
“Who’s they? What are we going?” Scott continued with his questions not caring that he was being ignored.
Steve hugged Miles smiling as he watched the kid count the cups on the table, “It should be fine, the coffee at home is always stronger than it should be, but that’s cause your dad likes it that way.”
Tony already knew that he was going to pass the class, the only course that he was really worried about was his fiction writing class, and lately it felt like the more he thought about it, after everything that had happened in the last few weeks, that maybe just maybe he had made a mistake. The whole thing with Steve had probably been a mistake, the whole first semester had been a huge mistake. He was a genius, but he had felt so stupid just giving up a huge opportunity at M.I.T. just to go to some small school.
“It’s Iron Man,” Tony told him, though it feels like he’s revealing something about himself. “I created him a long time ago, I write stories about him and Captain America being friends and helping one another.”
“That was after Thor talked about everything Bruce had ever worked on, it’s very intriguing stuff,” his father said smiling, which was strange to see because Tony could only ever remember the scowling face, but maybe his mother had been right about one thing, maybe Tony never really looked at his father to see if he were proud or anything. “Now, let's get this party going, I would like to be home before midnight tonight.”
“No not really, I have to get home and finish up with my paper, and I want to add things to this,” Ty said still looking at the papers he had printed out. “There’s a lot of work I still want to do on the story.”
When he finished cleaning up, he dressed quickly and walked towards the med bay, seeing Tony through the glass window on a hospital bed. The Hulk must have done a number on him, and Steve felt guilty for insinuating that Tony had asked for it. He stood at the door, not really sure if he was welcomed in the room, but he was fine with that, he needed to gain the man’s trust once again, he needed to move forward. It was just one step at a time. He needed to see Tony for who he was, to listen without reacting, to just be there for the other man.
“I know,” he said holding onto the man that just a few days ago he swore to keep close to his heart. “But we owe it to them to keep trying.”
With his glasses on and FRIDAY in his ear, it hadn’t taken him very long to find the lab that held the tesseract, which only made the lack of security a little troubling. He remembered that the tesseract would burn his skin if he touched it, so he was careful to put it in the case he had secured on the way there, using one of the Iron Man gauntlets which had formed on his hand.
“It’s because I’m more myself here with you and Bucky and Natasha, then I am when I have to be in public, I had to create this persona for the public to see, one that wasn’t me, because I when you live under a microscope you want to keep the parts of yourself that you only share with those you’re closest to.”
“I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do,” Thanos says as he stands up in front of them. “I will shred this universe down to its last atom,” he put on that god forsaken helmet and Tony just wanted to find a way to rip it off his head and shove it up the titan’s ass. “And then...With the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. A grateful universe.”
Before he could say another word, his other self moved forward, shield at the ready, and went at him, sending him backwards. He really hated himself at that moment, which was strange, but hell he hadn’t known just how much his own punches hurt. Steve took a swing at captain America, he really hated that uniform, and Tony knew it.
“I don’t want you guys to hate Bucky, we were friends before we dated and we’re friends now, it’s not going to stop, we just weren’t right for each other.”
Next chapter is the last chapter for the movie verse, and then the actual AU part of the story begins, I have five chapters between the end of Endgame and the fix-it part that are kind of what-if chapters. I've been plotting them for a while, so look forward to that. Some of them are in correlation to what happened, one during the 2012 time jump with Steve and the Bucky is alive thing, the other has to do with 1970.
“What, it’s not fair if Tony got to meet the parents, and they’ve been together for a week, while we’ve been dating for over a month and I haven’t met anyone,” Natasha said to Bucky pushing him back with her body.
He couldn’t look up to see what Bucky and Natasha were talking about, he couldn’t hear them anyway over the pounding in his ears, it was weird that one moment he was on top of the world and the next it can come crashing down. He wasn’t sure if Tony would listen to him, not unless he talked to Sharon, or even checked with his own sister.
“Okay,” Steve said sighing as he pulled into the parking lot, “I’ll be there this weekend, Friday night actually, just make sure that the camping stuff is there and not ripped, I don’t know what Harley and Peter get at when no one is looking, but it would be nice to be able to not freeze to death, I’ll see you then,” he hung up before his parents could get into it again, they were the best he could have asked for, but once they started they wouldn’t stop talking.
“We didn’t do anything,” he said in his own defense. “I was packing snacks, so I could go talk to Tony, because I know he’s really busy with his finals, mine are a cake walk compared to the ones he has. I just wanted to see him work, maybe draw a little, I’ve never had a moving subject, well not one like Tony, and I’ve been wanting to draw him for weeks.”
“How long were we down there,” Tony said as the sun hung over them, warming up the air around the large group of travelers. “I was sure we were only down there for a few hours.”
“Most likely no, it would just create an alternate timeline, and that timeline wouldn’t have to deal with Thanos, it wouldn’t change our past at all,” Bruce answered.
“How strong are we talking about?” Steve pulled out a note pad, ready to take Tony’s order, though he noticed that it was the same kind of paper that he had written his number on a few weeks before.
They looked at each other, and Tony knew that of all the things that could have happened this was not what they were expecting. “What did Carol say to you before we finished with the glove?” Tony asked trying to piece everything together.
Tony didn’t remember much from the first few months after the team had returned from wherever it was that Thanos had run off to. He doesn’t remember the drive to the lake house, only the moment that Steve had kneeled down next to him and talked to him. He worked on the house with Steve, but there had been days when he would find himself just sitting there doing nothing because he remembered how Peter would send him message after message about what he had been doing around Queens as Spiderman. Steve constantly pulling him out of his head whenever he got too deep into the memories.
“I love you,” he said without thinking, he had been so sure that Tony was asleep, that when he felt the shorter man stiffen beneath him, he was surprised. “Forget I said anything, go back to sleep,” he wanted to kick himself for even saying it out loud, Tony would probably tell him that it was too soon for this.
“He sees the future,” Steve said remembering the things he saw at Tony’s desk on a day when the genius was out. Mathematical equations that no one Steve knew could understand, even when tutoring Steve, Tony would talk about math in a way that made him light up like it was the one thing in the world that made sense.
He knew that she was fiercely protective, she had chosen the children’s books because she liked kids, but this was another side of her that no one really got to see. You see the one thing that most people didn’t know about Natasha was that she was a real momma bear when it came to protecting children. The reason stemmed from how she had grown up, she had always told him that no kid should have to live like she had.
“You know you’re terrible at keeping secrets,” she said to Miles. “I mean I already know that Steve is your dad, no kid in those dorms have a picture with Iron Man and Captain America, it’s impossible especially since they’ve been out of the spotlight for five years now.”
“It... it can’t be undone,” Clint said, and Tony could hear the heaviness in the man’s voice, there was something about losing someone close to you that made it all the more painful, and for all of them Natasha was family.
“But Dad the Ironheart armor is safe, and you’ve upgraded every single protocol for all of our suits,” Riri started, it felt almost as if they had planned on ambushing him with their intent on helping.
“My friends call me Mr. Secretary,” Pierce said, while Tony had to bite his tongue before he said something else. “I’m going to have ot ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.”
Both Steve and Bucky were staring at them, he wasn’t sure why until they started laughing, “What it happens a lot, plus they would never mess with Nat, not after one of Clint’s collectable figures was found dismembered in bed next to him, which one was it.”
“No, I’m not going to ground you especially since you’re in college, but you have to come home this weekend, Riri is going to be there, and hopefully Kamala will be there too, I’m going to set some ground rules with you three about being heroes, because I saw how your dad was with Peter, and after what happened I don’t what to think about how he would react if anything happened to you three.”
“Do you have some weird eating disorder,” Bucky asked him after he had come back from showering his hair up in a bun while parts were damp from the shower. “All you ever eat is what’s in that fridge which I noticed is only packed in with smoothies and coffee, and those weird granola bars you hide under your bed.”
“Oh, I never thought of it that way,” all he had done was created a story where he would work with Cap, he hadn’t known it could have any kind of impact on anyone especially the person it had been based on.
“You’re Tony Stark,” Peter said before launching into something about artificial intelligence, that Steve couldn’t keep up with. Peter was smart, he created a spider-bot that works from some kind of AI, but he was struggling with it. Tony was the best person to talk about it with, but Steve was still trying to get past his brothers at the moment, and failing. Though how Peter knew about Tony’s work in artificial intelligence was beyond Steve.
“Yes,” Steve said do him and Tony wasn’t sure if he wanted to see this version of Cap, it wasn’t that he cared about what Cap looked like, it was just that thinking of Steve in that way would give into his childhood fantasies, the ones where he would be at Captain America’s side, fighting the bad guys, and eventually falling for the guy. “I want you to see them, but I also want you to see something else.”
“The doctors said that she’s dilated at what 8 or 9,” his father turned, when he was worried about something, he tended to forget things very easily, his mother being in her late forties meant this was a risky pregnancy, so of course it meant that his father would worry himself into exhaustion.
“All right. You heard my man,” Tony said before turning to Steve and planting a kiss on his lips. “When we get back, we’re going back to our room and having words,” he whispered to Steve with a wink before turning to Shuri, “Hit those keys Shuri.”
“Wait, when you say a planet, you mean like in outer space?” Scott asked his eyes wide which only gave Rocket an opening to mock the man.
If he were honestly speaking, it could just be the fact that they hadn’t had a single moment to themselves in a long while, so the rising sexual tension was also in play, and neither would probably last too long, but he did want to have fun with it all.
“Yeah it was her favorite, mom had been so proud if her for it,” Tony had remembered that day, mainly because he had been proud of her too, but also because he had learned all of the musical pieces and played them for her on the piano so that she could practice at home. He hadn’t realized just how much he misses hanging out with his sister, but he knew that this whole separation thing would have happened eventually.
Morgan rested her head on his shoulder, she was happy and comfortable, her sisters were home, and all that was missing was Steve and Miles, both of which would show up by dinner time. He hears the car before he sees it, it’s Steve’s Audi, the one that Tony had gotten him for his trips into the city, the one that he wasn’t allowed to install FRIDAY on because Steve liked the quiet. Tony’s not sure what to think when he sees three other people in the car with Steve, he knew it was the time of the week when Steve checked on Nat, and usually dragged her to the house for dinner, but he really wasn’t expecting the two other people.
“Not all of us,” Tony said pouting, which Steve thought was adorable, even with the heaviness of the subject at hand.
“I needed Mr. Stark to give permission for you to use this story as your final project, if not you will have to write another story before the official end of the semester,” Professor Coulson told them both, and Tony knew what was happening, it was up to him whether Ty would have to rewrite his whole story or fail the class.
“I’m not, I just didn’t have my morning coffee,” or any coffee for that matter, he was tired and literally living on red bulls at the moment, so he should probably get some food at some point as well. “Are you going to see Thor today?”
“I said we’d lose, you told me that we’d do it together, and guess what we lost Steve,” he said his voice getting louder, and he knew that everyone behind him could hear him and he didn’t really care. “
“We can’t get her back,” Clint said his face despondent never really looking any of them in the eye. It hurt because she had been his partner, so losing her after losing his wife was weighing heavily on his shoulders.
“I can tell that this is a surprise to you, you probably thought that the reason I called you here was to deal with Mr. Stone’s use of your words, but honestly I hadn’t planned on having you sit in on that discussion until the Dean advised me to get your opinion before moving forward,” Professor Coulson said to him.
“The A.I. in the story is real,” Tony told him with a smile. “Right now, it’s in its first stages, but I want to create a full interface A.I. one day, though I don’t think that the world would be ready for something like that when I’m finished, no matter how advanced technology is.”
“We’re here to help,” Kamala said as she landed next to her sister, placing Lila, who was now wearing a purple outfit Steve’s never seen before, next to her America running up to them like she’s ready for a fight, just as Miles swings up and lands next to him giving him a pat on the shoulder.
“I have a story I want to read to you,” Tony said smiling. “It’s still a work in progress so no one’s read it, and so I hope you like it.”
“Because son, as young as you think I am, I can’t keep up with drawing and writing all of these series, the Spider-man series is taking off, mainly because Peter is so excited about it and sometimes helps with filling in the color on his computer after I’ve drawn everything out,” his father said a fond smile on his face. “But my hand cramps up sometimes, and I’m not sure how long I can keep going without getting carpal tunnel and losing the ability to create.”
“I just wish that we had the time to fix what Hydra had done to him, for him to remember me, for none of this to have happened, we all lost so much but I gained a family when we became the Avengers,” she told him and while he knew that she was trying, Riri had given her something more to hope for.
Steve couldn’t help but groan, Harley had grown over the years, but he wasn’t at Steve’s six-foot three-inch height, hell he was taller than all of them with the exception of Hank and their father. “Be nice Harley,” Steve said to his brother before turning to Peter and seeing his eyes wide open.
“But why did that help when nothing else did?” he asked knowing that he needed to look into this himself. “Can you send me the notes on the whole,” he waved his hands not sure where he should start.
“Yeah that’s a lie, I saw like three of your tags all over campus, and it was my school’s campus,” Kamala said, and Miles just glared at her.
“You weren’t supposed to die,” he whispered to no one, the slight smell of her flowers in the air, an overturned bottle of nail polish on the nightstand. Tony wondered if he had a sister growing up would she have been like Natasha, brave and fearless, but also kind and caring. He couldn’t help but hold the bottle, it was a part of an Avengers collection, and it was the same red as his armor.
“I don’t think I would, I mean I hate that I went through so much of what I went through over the years but in the end,” Tony said looking at him as if he knew that the answer wouldn’t change who they were. “I think if I had to do it again, I would because it’s led me to this point, it led me to you and the Avengers, and our kids.”
They landed back on the Quantum platform, barely two seconds had passed before Tony rushed off to heave out whatever was left in his stomach, Steve following him towards the nearest trash bin, once again rubbing his hand up and down Tony’s back. He really hated time travel, and he was glad it was over because it meant that his stomach would stop heaving so much. He really couldn’t understand why it kept happening, he flew around in a suit of armor, but apparently this was the one thing that wasn’t going to let him have an easy time.
“It’s a family business,” Miles said with a shrug, Vision landing next to Miles, his powers fully operational, which meant that Shuri had been able to finish, with time to spare, this time around.
“I’m going to go help them,” Steve said pointing at the others on the far end of the Testing chamber. “Before the Hulk decides to put in an appearance because Scott did the wrong thing.”
Tony looked down at the sheet and smiled, he could do this, math was easy for him, it wasn’t relationships or roommate drama, math was math, “Sure, no problem,” he said wondering if Steve could hear how hard his heart was hammering away inside of his chest.
Much to his disappointment, she had told him that she was going to move down south with her son and his wife, but she was leaving the store to her grandson. The same one Tony had a crush on all those years ago, and for some reason she was hinting at something.
“You can’t go camping in this weather,” Peter said over the phone, his voice muffled as Harley tried to take the phone from him. “Damn it Harley, let me talk...” Peter said before his voice came back on the phone. “Steve it’s cold outside, your balls would shrivel up and fall off.”
“Is that even safe?” Tony asked knowing that Clint’s competence in the kitchen left something to be desired most days.
“Come on Steve, let’s go... wait where’s your car?” Bucky said looking around as Steve started the mini-van. “I’m not going to this thing in your dad’s mini.”
Pepper had finally looked up to see that she had been facing Steve and not Tony, “Who are you,” she said before he pulled Steve’s hand towards him, “Oh my god Tony what happened, are you in an ambulance? are you alright? Should I call your mother?”
“Gods that hurts,” he said before watching Giant-Man kicking him away before rushing towards more of Thanos’s army.
“Is that what I did?” Tony asked looking around, and Steve knew that if Tony had gotten hit by the Hulk it wasn’t his fault, but he was taking the blame anyway.
“Get up, Pepper is bringing Chinese food, and we know you haven’t eaten yet,” Rhodey said though he didn’t even try to move at all, smothering Tony into the couch cushions. “She’s bringing May too, so we can watch some movies or something.”
Steve looked down at where Tony’s body had been, a question on his lips that had been there since after that first fight with one of Thanos’ minions, “Why did you forgive me so easily?”
With a quick kiss to Tony, he took a deep breath, “Don’t die,” he said before turning to Thanos’s army, “AVENGERS,” he called out as everyone took their place, calling out to Mjölnir as he yelled out. “ASSEMBLE.”
“Yeah, that would be swell,” geez now Steve was rubbing off on him. They were almost home free, he just needed to get pass Howard, and an entire army battalion and meet up with Steve, no problem.
“I can’t,” Tony said kissing Steve’s hand. “I have three kids to ground, and a husband to climb like a tree when this is all done.”
“You promise me you won’t die?” Scott said and Tony knew that this plan wasn’t one hundred percent full proof, hell it wasn’t idiot proof and Steve called him an idiot enough for him to know, but they were idiots together but that was a story to think about another day.
He hadn’t noticed the man sitting at the café with a cup of coffee in front of him taking a picture, but when the shot had started trending an hour later, and Peter had come rushing over, Steve wondered how he had missed the whole thing happening.
“Well he should know better than to leave me alone for long periods of time,” he said as he pulled the three of them into a hug. “But now I have you to blame it on.”
“No, I told her that Sam was in love with her and that I already had someone that I wanted to be with,” Steve turned towards him and took his hand letting Tony feel just how cold they felt. “Tony I was going to leave a party with some of the best people I know because I would rather have been with you,” Tony felt his breath hitch at the words because there was no way that this was happening at this moment. “I want to be with you and only you. I want to take you camping.”
“Bucky gave me a key,” Steve said that smile still on his face, his blue eyes distracting Tony enough before the words that Steve had said could sink in.
Everyone got up, some went for coffee, others to talk to one another, Miles was in the center of the room animatedly talking to America, Steve knew that it was because he was proud of his friend for sharing something for once.
“Yup,” was the only thing he said back before getting into the machine itself. He could automatically feel Steve’s presence as he walked into the room. They were so attuned to one another that it was instinct when the other one came in. “Hey,” he said as Steve kissed him on the cheek.
He could do this, he could keep Riri from saying anything, and then he heard Kamala say, “What happened to the TV?”
Steve dropped off his duffle bag in his attic bedroom, sighing as he listened to Sam and Bucky bicker a floor below. His room was the same as it had been when he had gone home for the summer, his easel in the corner, his drafting desk, which he had made in high school, against the vaulted wall. He had gotten his supplies delivered the week before, and even drove down to bring them to the house. He sighed looking at his room, his younger brothers not around yelling and screaming at one another. He liked the quiet that came with going to college sometimes. Taking one more look around he smiled before going to help Bucky move into the dorms.
“Well he has a lot riding on his shoulders, yes he has brothers who also work at the company, but even they all knew that Tony was going to be the head of the company one day, there’s no way around that, he’s a genius, he’s sees the world differently than everyone.”
“Really, remember when we pulled you out of your house because you spoke with my mom, and you worked hard yes, but at the same time you were freaking out about being at home in time before the Marshals came and you ended up in back in the raft, but we got you back in time, no problem.”
“From the tesseract,” Rhodey said causing both Steve and Tony to look at him. “I read up on your first battle together, and when I asked her while you two were having your little fight, she told me about an explosion from a battle and a blue light.”
An hour after they gotten there and sat under the stars, Bucky and Natasha came barreling through the backdoor, Steve’s brothers not far behind, while Steve’s father yelled something about letting the riff raff into the house. Tony felt Steve laughing before the sound ever reached his ears, it was like feeling a slow rumble making its way up, and he liked it.
“Not at all, but I do want to know if you’re going to be okay with him, I mean I saw what happened the other day, misunderstanding or not.”
“It wasn’t my fault, it was Harley, he wanted to know if we could make a rocket, and well.... the first two attempts ended in failure, but mostly in us burning something really badly in the pit and dad yelled at us.”
“Also, you elbowed Tony Stark in the face,” Natasha added, and it was only then that the guy blanched. “Yeah next time you put up a fight make sure you know who you’re hitting.”
“Yeah I know that Sharon wanted to date Sam too, but we all thought that he was pining over Bucky, so we never put two and two together, it just shows how bad we are at matchmaking,” she sighed and looked Steve right in the eye. “Don’t hurt Tony, he doesn’t deserve it, not after everything he’s been through, and if you do, I have a pair of four-inch Jimmy Choo’s with steal heels waiting for your balls.”
“Love,” he said, he couldn’t focus on anything, but he just wanted to say the word, he was going to hold onto Steve for as long as he had him. His arms were burning from being bound up, even as he struggled to get free.
He stood there for a moment, taking a few quick breaths before looking back at his other self and realizing that what Tony and Scott had been saying was right, “Geez, I’m never going to hear the end of this,” he said to himself. “That’s America’s ass.”
The words hung in the air, a reminder of what he couldn’t stop but he also knew that this group of people, if they tried hard enough, they would help move the world forward. They just had to, because Steve couldn’t risk failing his family again.
“We don’t know, I mean it gave Vision some advanced powers too, but that’s something we never got to the bottom of, we only really had two stones in our possession,” Tony told them, wondering just how much power those stones had, they’ll never know until they find Thanos.
The last person to speak to the group was a young Latin woman, she had only started coming to the meetings a few months before, but Steve knew that she wanted to say somethings, and while she had only shared the basics of her life at first, she had finally opened up.
Tony walked into the lab where Bruce was working on Vision’s vital signs, Shuri long gone after passing out from working too much without sleep. They had all lost something, but she had lost her brother and Tony understood how that kind of pain was going to drive her, hopefully in a better direction than his own pain had driven him when he had found out the reason why he had lost his mother.
“You’re not going to stand there and pine over whether or not Tony was going to walk through the door,” she said with a smile, but Steve could only glare at her.
“I mean, he helped me edit but I wrote the story,” Ty said defending his work. “He only did maybe twenty percent of the work.”
“Listen the only way they’re going to be distracted enough for us to get that stone is for when they’re about to get it out of the building, we have this slight altercation with SHIELD over letting Thor have it while they’re all in the lobby, that’s the only time we’ll be able to get it. Especially if my other self is having a slight heart attack, which would be caused by the reactor, that had been in my chest at the time, having a slight malfunction.”
“That's right,” he said to her. “I won't. Leave it. Got a family,” he looked directly at his husband who was now standing there quietly. He hadn’t heard Morgan run out to him until Steve’s eyes darted to their daughter.
“I remember that, and afterwards she ended up telling him that she only liked him as a friend, because as it turned out, she was already into someone else,” Natasha added which made Steve hate his friends just a little more.
He wondered if he was going to be this lovey dovey with Tony in times of crisis, because this is a crisis if there ever was one. He sighed, texting Tony about what was happening now that he wasn’t behind the wheel of the car. It was weird that Tony wouldn’t answer the phone, even stranger that he wasn’t answering the messages.
That was the moment when the whole disaster of his life came crashing down, it was one thing for Steve and Bucky to know who he was, for his professors to know and keep it secret so that he could just be a regular person. But Ty knew, and Tony wasn’t sure why, but it hurt him even more, probably because he thought that for once in his life, he would get the chance at being normal, but of course the universe had other ideas.
He listened to Tony’s breathing even out before falling asleep himself, his thoughts never straying from the genius in his arms. His dreams filled with Tony’s world, the one where the Avengers fought together, maybe one where Bucky and Tony’s sister Natasha were also a couple. Iron Man and Captain America fighting side by side, saving the world.
Shuri had taken Vision and the cradle back with her to Wakanda five years ago, the girl had become obsessed with reviving the android, even years later when Tony knew she had settled into her role as Queen she hadn’t stopped searching for answers. He knew that she should really have been out there being a kid, having fun with her friends, but he also knew how it felt to lose all of your family at once. For him it had happened twice in his life. So, whenever she called, he always made sure to talk to her, he also sent Kamala and Riri out to Wakanda so that Shuri would have friends closer to her age, and as smart as they all were, it sometimes backfired on him when they would invent something weird. The last time it had been a prank bomb, that had turned him and Steve blue, it had even seeped in through their clothes, so they looked like the Blue Man Group from head to toe.
“See now you’re nervous,” Steve said kissing his forehead. “We could meet each other’s families, and if we survive that we can survive anything.”
Resigning himself to his fate, and turned around and walked further into the office, there were windows on the other side letting in some light, but it was dark enough that they wouldn’t notice him standing there. He needed to think, he needed to find a way to make it outside without people noticing, because they were definitely on the lookout for them now.
“Yeah, he was in the army with my dad a long time ago, they’ve been friends for years,” Steve said smiling. It was one thing for Tony to know about Captain America, it was another to see Tony’s face when he realized just how many of the people in the comics were real people.
“Whatever, you and your logic over here can leave Cap alone,” Tony said because in a way he was also defending Steve, and while Steve didn’t really need defending from someone who didn’t know him, it was still something he needed to do.
“Sorry,” he said to Steve who was rubbing his back as Bruce handed him a bottle of water he had gotten from an overturned hot dog cart.
“I know,” he answered as another wave of sadness hit them both, this could be the start of something bigger or the end of it all.
“I think I’m happy that I’m an only child if you have that many siblings, but then again I did grow up with Steve and his crazy family, so I don’t really know what to think,” Bucky said grabbing Tony’s attention, because telling anyone saying anything about Steve to him was like giving a kid candy.
“Very well Mr. Stark,” Professor Coulson said with a smile. “Please stay for a moment, I need to take Mr. Stone to the Dean’s office so that I may give her the final decision on this matter.”
There was something about hearing Tony say things like that that made Steve happy, mainly because Steve never thought about his parents that way. When you’re a child you always just see them as parents, people you look up to until the next person comes along that catches your interest. Children have short attention spans when it comes to certain things, but their parents are a constant in their lives. Steve wondered when he stopped seeing his parents as heroes, and just saw them as mom and dad.
“Come on Morgoona, let’s go eat and then we’ll make something together,” Tony said and his little angel girl squealed at him. She knew that she had him wrapped around her little finger, there was no denying how much he loved her for how happy she always was, even as he remembered just how sad she had been as a toddler when he had first met her.
That had been the last summer he had seen Mrs. Rogers’ teenage grandson, she had told Tony that he had joined the military. He had kept up with her, built his own library by buying books from her store, and even converted one of the houses down the street into his own home. She had made him feel welcome in a world of high school bullies, because he had been a kid genius and no one really wanted him to succeed.
Yes, Steve didn’t want the store to have any bad publicity, but she had assured him that they weren’t especially since everyone knew that it was one of Tony’s favorite places. For Steve though, it wasn’t so much as the press finding out, but the fact that Tony had gotten hurt, he was afraid that they would turn it around and blame it on Steve instead of the guy responsible, all the while Steve was worried about Tony being hurt.
“That he is,” she sat down next to him looking out at the space Tony had once occupied. “Peter, in a way I think, reminded him of himself, that curious energy that Tony carries with him. I think if it were possible, Peter would have been Tony’s son, they’re both crazy smart and have the tendency to get themselves in trouble.”
“I haven't,” Scott said raising his hand. “I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.”
“What,” Steve looked at him, Tony could see the surprised look on Steve’s face. “Did the comics inspire you?”
Even now he still couldn’t get a hold of Pepper and Happy and he wasn’t sure what to do about that, he didn’t know if he could deal with anymore loss. Instead of saying anything else, he tapped Steve’s shoulder and walked off in search of Bruce, with the need to help Vision’s recovery along a little more. He knew that he was leaving behind Steve to deal with whatever the hell was happening out there, he knew it wasn’t the best to just walk away but he couldn’t stop thinking about everything, even after a good night’s rest and waking up wrapped up in a super soldier, there were still so many things he needed to get off of his chest, but he didn’t want to tip the balance over whatever for of peace they had gained. Too many were gone, their friends and family were hurting, he didn’t want to have that conversation he just wanted to let it go, and if the only way he could do it was to walk away at that moment and collect his thoughts, well that’s what he was going to do.
“No problem,” he couldn’t help but mumble, he wasn’t sure why he was shy about the whole thing, but when he saw Tony packing up his stuff, he wanted to stop him, he wanted a moment to get to know him a little better, even for just a second.
“No, you should have told them to go home,” he said wanting to yell but holding back. “They shouldn’t be here.”
“It’s a thank you,” he said to him before they walked back into the night, he wasn’t sure if a water would be a good repayment, after being angry at him when they first met but it was a start. “Hey can I ask you a question.”
“I’ll finish the last of it in the morning,” Tony answered, because all he needed to do was clean up the story a little bit, nothing more. “Everything else I finished already,” he actually finished weeks ago, but the other night after his talk with Steve, he decided to scrap his project and start new, which was dumb, because the first project was already done, but he really just wanted to invent something.
“Sorry, I guess I should have just read it myself,” Steve answered but Tony shook his head, because if he were honest with himself at this moment, he liked the fact that Steve was so close to him, and that he actually liked the story.
“Yeah well, I already have a lot to say, but I wouldn’t know what to get your dad, moms are easy, I know because my mom loves getting flowers all of the time, she likes to make things out of them once they dry out and everything.”
Tony nodded, he knew the pain of it all would be crazy, but he didn’t know how to go about it all without dramatically changing the past, without altering their futures as they knew it. He didn’t know if he could really give up his kids, his life with Steve, it was something that they really needed to think about, and it was something that was going to take more than one day to figure out.
“You’re good with them,” Steve had told him, after the war had ended in all five of them covered in paint and DUM-E spraying them with the fire extinguisher. “You gave them all a family, you became my family.”
“We’re here,” Miles said plopping himself down on the ground. “She’s faster than she looks and I have superpowers.”
“Hey Steve,” he said walking into the room seeing his boyfriend half dozed off on the bed. “Did you take your medication?”
“Why do you like Captain America so much?” he asked leaning back, letting himself see this side of Tony, the side of him that liked superhero comics and wrote about the characters like they were his own. “I mean, there has to be a reason why.”
“It was probably a good thing that Fury was so paranoid then,” he said, even though he hated the secrets that Fury had kept when everything had happened.
“This old lady would love to see her grandson settle down one day,” she had told him when he had come in that day. He wasn’t sure if it had happened or if he had hallucinated the whole thing. So, he had made a deal with himself that the day Steve took over, he would go over there and talk to him at least.
“No, I’ve told you that I’m over Bucky, and if you thought that every time, we talked about him I was pining, well it just means that I wasn’t obvious about my feelings or we could just be bad at realizing what we have right in front of us. I’m not dating anyone else either,” Steve told him wanting to have this moment. We can take everything slowly it’s up to you. “Honestly I thought you were dating that guy from the library.”
In Professor Coulson’s office Tony felt weirdly calm, sitting in the leather chair next to Ty, Tony felt confident, even though he wasn’t fond of Ty or what he had done, because it didn’t matter anymore none of it did, he realized that just from standing outside with his boyfriend, his friend and his family.
The company had seen major changes over the years, the most notable happened when Tony had been fourteen, and his mother had been shot using one of Howard’s own designs. It had devastated the man, because while Tony was often criticized by his father, he was also the only witness to what had happened since he had been with his mother. Howard Stark’s Achilles heel was his own wife, Tony wondered why a man like Howard who damned so much of who his son was, could love anyone. But he had grown up in that house and had seen the way his parents were towards one another, and he knew with absolute certainty that Howard loved Maria and he would do anything for her. Maria’s injury was a result of her shielding Tony from the bullet that had put her in the hospital, and his father had yelled at him for not protecting his mother better. His mother told him that his father loved him, he had just been scared, but Tony knew better and spent more time with his Captain America collection looking for ways to protect his family.
“You have no right,” the man tried to say, and of course just when he yanked his arm away from Natasha the guy’s elbow slammed right into Tony’s face, hitting him right in the nose. “What the fuck,” the guy yelled out, right as Steve’s familiar face came into view.
“Yes, Tony,” she hadn’t been looking at the screen to see what was happening which meant that she had answered from her desk at S.I., and she was in the middle of work, when she should have left for the day.
Natasha had been home for a little over a week when the news came, and the Stark house was full of cheer, Howard sometimes grumbling about having too many kids, but Tony knew that his father loved them in his own way. Yeah, he had been a little harsh on them over the years, but he had wanted what was best for them. So, now to Tony, born at the end of May, just a few months younger than Natasha, he had come into the world too soon and too small. Screaming and crying, seven weeks premature, his brothers had told him that they had all been afraid that he wouldn’t have made it. They had seen the sadness in their parents’ eyes, Tony had been a miracle when they hadn’t thought it was possible.
“She’s been sneaking into the garage, last week I caught her grabbing one of your prototypes,” Steve said as they walked into the kitchen. “Maybe we should lock the workshop when we’re sleeping.”
“Together,” Steve said with a smile, even after that argument five years before, even after everything that had happened, there was something about them being together, all of them working towards something better, that made it all the worth wild.
“Plus, we know you have a hot roommate,” Natasha said to him, “Jan said so,” her sing songy tone reminded him of what they had been like at home when they had fawned over the guy, they had picked to play Captain America in the movies.
They entered the house and Tony could feel the bass of the music flood over him, he was familiar with the loud reverberations, he usually listened to his music on the same volume, but for some reason this was just adding to the pounding of his heart and he wasn’t sure if it was a good thing or if he would have a heart attack and die at that moment.
“Ahh, there’s always something isn’t there, and you’re bribing me with coffee,” Tony smirked at him as he took another sip of the coffee, honestly, he only made it taste like caramel because sometimes when the sun shined on Tony his eyes looked like caramel, and Steve couldn’t help the smile on his face as he watched Tony drinking it. “If you bring me some coffee tomorrow, I’ll tutor you.”
“Sorry,” he said holding onto to her hand for a moment, “We’ve got enough for one round trip each, that’s it. No do-overs. Plus, two test runs,” his hand accidentally pressed a botton on the suit activating the particle and shrinks down, Hope sighing next to him before he grows back to his normal size. “Okay one test run.”
He remembered once, a long time ago, what feels like another lifetime ago, when they were all standing in the Tower’s living area, when they had all joked about being able to lift Thor’s hammer. He denied feeling the power flow through his hands all of those years ago, even now after everything he’s put them all through, he doesn’t think himself worthy, but if it would save them all he would try. There was something about Mjölnir, it called out to those who were worthy of wielding it, it was pure power, and even when he denied it, he could feel it’s call. He saw as Thanos was fighting Thor, as Thor’s own weapon was used against him. Steve reached for that part of himself that he had denied so much, he reached out for Mjölnir and saw the hammer floating up before it flew towards him.
Hours later, Steve was in Bucky’s room, Bucky had gone to shower after taking a three-hour nap on the couch at Starbucks, leaving Steve there on Tony’s bed. He could have sat on Bucky’s bed, but Steve was almost certain that Bucky never actually washed the sheets since the day he moved into the dorms. When they were kids, Steve remembered that Bucky’s mom would yell at him over the way his room smelled and that he should go wash his sheets or burn them. Steve really hoped that dating Natasha would change that, but he wasn’t going to ask whether it had actually worked, at least not at the moment.
“That sounds great, especially since I didn’t have any real ideas about what to write about,” Tony said, the only story in his head with his own fanfiction story, he hadn’t put much thought into what to write for this project so having to do the other half of the story that was already essentially written... well it was something that he was good at.
“I do, I was getting ready to go see him when Sharon came into the room,” he said in his own defense, the food still on the counter because he never found the bag. “She’s should be talking to Sam right now actually.”
“Yeah I know, and you’re right, plus I wanted to tell dad about how the web shooters were working, I may have to have them adjusted a little.”
“Trust me Steve they know, and if they don’t well it doesn’t really matter, all that matters is you and me know,” Tony said before walking out of his room and seeing someone in a dark corner, it didn’t take long for Tony to realize that it was Ty, he was talking to someone in the dorm, but he ignored the guy and walked to Steve’s car before Ty could stop them and ruin their night.
Steve got up without thinking, he needed a moment, so he just got up and followed Tony to the door and walking with him towards the dorm’s back doors surprising Tony. “Hey Tony... um...,” he said stopping the younger man for a moment. “If you get out late call me, I’ll come and pick you up,” he couldn’t understand what compelled him to say that, Tony had said date, which meant that the other person would want to walk back together. He felt so stupid, but he said it and now he wanted to commit to it.
“You two have to eat,” Clint said as he slowly pulled Tony’s wheelchair away from the computer he was working on.
Instead of walking him towards the dorm, Steve pulled him towards the parking lot, Tony knew that they were going to go for a ride, but it was too surreal for him, he had been pissed at everyone over the weekend. Mostly at his own luck, so what were the odds that when one person had used him, Steve would be there to pick up the pieces. This was new, and not something that he was really expecting.
Natasha just sat back against the seat with a smile on her face, “That’s fine, I was actually going to go with Jan to Italy and meet up with her mom and do some shopping. Mom said she’d meet us there and that we’d have a girl's trip,” she said, and Tony could see the excitement on his sister’s face, though he wanted to complain about being alone, he knew that in the Stark family holidays together were rare.
Sam and Bucky had started nagging him on it, “You’re supposed to be sellin’ them not readin’ them,” Bucky called out from the café, his Brooklyn accent coming out as he said it. Natasha smirking next to him as she shelved a few books.
With a sigh Tony settled himself on Steve’s lap, “First, I’m going to open you up, and shove my nice new, gold titanium alloy Iron Man special vibrator up your ass, but I’m not going to turn it on just yet,” he said as he watched Steve lick his lips, honestly that shouldn’t be as hot as it was, “Then,” he cleared his throat, fucking hell his clothes felt tight, the room felt like it was a million degrees inside. “Then, I’m going to put a nice little ring on mini Cap.”
The two of them walked over to the dining hall, Tony was quiet for a moment, it was a Friday so most of the people in their dorm were getting ready for one party or another, the dining hall wasn’t full, so they found a table near where everyone came in from the food line. Tony had a plate filled with fries and another with two giant cheeseburgers that had ketchup dripping out of it, along with a giant cup of coffee that had Bucky looking at him like he was crazy.
“Yeah but I saw how your last relationship went, I could kill that evil wretch, but I let it go,” she said, and Tony knew how protective Natasha was of him, no one messed with her baby brother, no matter how many months apart in age they were. “I just want you to be happy.”
“James Barnes, the guy you’re dating, he’s my roommate,” Tony said, and Natasha’s wide eyes were all it took for him to know that she hadn’t realized this. She was good at finding out thing before Tony did, so the fact that she had been half flirting with his roommate for weeks and he’s known it before her was a feat that he was willing to be proud of. Jan had this look on her face like she had blocked out that Tony had a roommate at all, and then remembered that conversation that they had had so long ago about Steve.
Tony resigned himself to his fate and picked up his foam-covered daughter, “DUM-E, U, clean this up please,” he said as Morgan laughed from his shoulder as they walked away. “And you missy, you need a bath.”
“No laughing,” Clint said but Steve couldn’t help it, because now Clint had brought it up and he was laughing in the man’s face.
“The relationship development between the two of them is incredible, and it would be groundbreaking if we ran it, but can you really take on something like this, I mean you still have a year and a half left.”
“Okay,” he said as she went off, she had the ability to be seen when she wanted to be seen, and stay hidden when she didn’t want anyone to know where she was going. While Tony on the other hand, stuck out like a sore thumb, because he usually tripped on something on his way out, or he looked too obvious while sneaking.
Tony was worried, he knew that this would change a lot of things, and he wasn’t sure if he was prepared for it. It had taken him a long time to move on, to be able to let go of one of the biggest failures of his life. What did it mean when the past started to come back to him, he wondered, especially if he was willing to risk losing his kids in the process.
They ate in silence after that, it wasn’t until later, when Thor had come back that they saw just how much he cared for their opinion. “You’re the only family I have left,” Thor had said sadness in his eyes, “I am afraid of losing you all as well, Asgardians live very long lives, and after everything that had happened, I realized just how much it would hurt me to lose you all as well.”
“Shuri, it’s Scott,” Hope said with a hint of glee in her eyes. “As adorable as he is this way, I do like him as an adult.”
Walking back into the room, he could see the look that Bucky was giving him, they hadn’t discussed anything about Steve liking Tony, but for all he knew it was because Steve hadn’t told him.
“I hate camping,” Tony said but they all just ignored him. He fought like this whenever they tried to bring it up, and usually they rented a cabin so it wouldn’t really be camping, but he knew that one day they would really end up going camping and he was dreading it.
“Yeah well I don’t like holes in my walls, Thor buddy, we’ve talked about this,” Tony said wheeling himself over to the hole to inspect the damage, Steve with an exasperated look on his face, let him go.
“Tony has these moments, where the press wants to get at him,” she said her eyes had this fondness to it, which meant that she had some stories. “But I think you’ll be fine as well as your store, so you don’t really have to stay.”
“To our futures,” she said winking at her brother. “May it be filled with love, success, and unlimited happiness.”
“Don’t do anything mean to him,” Sharon called out as they disappeared up the stairs. “I’ll come after you if you do.”
“Okay, so Iron Man’s other personality is a mixture of my life and my family’s business, or at least what it used to be, when we still sold weapons, and from there I created a kidnapping where his kidnappers wanted him to build this weapon with this insane destructive capability,” Tony knew that he was rambling, but he rarely got to tell anyone this side of the story, even his readers had expressed more interest in the relationship between Captain America and Iron Man, or when would Iron Man reveal his identity. So, because of this, Tony had kept Iron Man’s origin story to himself, but hearing Steve’s interest in it, he just wanted to spill on everything. “I mean it could wipe out a whole mountain range, anyway the day of the kidnapping a bomb exploded next to him and the bomb embedded pieces of shrapnel into his chest, even the bulletproof vest he was wearing wasn’t enough to stop them.”
“I have a life, I have three kids in college, and one at home, who is probably blowing something up with her father right now, because Tony had that manic look on his face this morning, even though I told him to take it easy before I left,” he said sighing as he thought about the crazy things that his husband was probably up to. “Honestly though, Nat, you need to let go of this, at least for a little while, have Rhodey take over and just take a vacation.”
“I eat,” Tony said in his own defense, but he knew that without Jarvis to force him to eat he usually just hid out somewhere and ate whatever was nearby, or his lunches with Natasha and Jan, which only happened every other day, because he didn’t want the two of them to track him down.
The door to his room opened and Bucky found him sitting on the edge of the bed, he knew he looked like hell, and this had only happened within the last twenty minutes. But Buck didn’t say anything, he just sat down next to him and stayed quiet for a moment, letting Steve cry right there. For some reason it felt like the end of the world to him, which was stupid because he’s known Tony for barely four months, but this is different than what he had with Bucky.
“Stop,” Steve said slowing the man down, “Slow down, why would you want to give us business, we don’t even know you.”
Steve didn’t say anything more, they had kept track of Tony in the time that the team had been separated, mostly just Steve keeping track, but he guessed that Natasha had as well. She used to tell him that they were a family, and even if they were in a rough place, they would find their way back to one another. Steve just wished they had done so faster, that he hadn’t been stubborn about it, that he would have just sent Tony a message before the first attack had happened. He was sure that Tony would have never opened it, but he just wanted to say something, anything.
It was Steve’s turn to put Morgan to bed that night, and Tony was happy for it, because his mind was waging a war on itself over the whole thing. So, he started washing the dishes, a habit that Jarvis had gotten him started on, which was something he did when he was overthinking everything. As he’s finishing up, he accidentally drops a plate into the sudsy water, splashing water and soap everywhere. His mind was everywhere, and not very helpful at all, but when he sees the picture of him and Peter, Peter holding his Stark internship certificate upside down, he remembers the kid’s last words.
