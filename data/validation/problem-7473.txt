“Six legionnaires are taking up position around the hospital to protect Sir while he remains here.” Jarvis informed the team, “You may rest assured nothing shall happen to sir on our watch.”
“What about Zach?” Steve asked, they had spoken on the phone during the flight back from Miami, but not in detail.
Steve balanced Lily in his arms, sitting at the conference room table, before the Avengers team, with Tony by his side.
Natasha lifted her chin in defiance, “Your employers too, Captain. Remember, they are paying for your apartment, bills, and groceries.”
Yeah, not his brightest move.
“What does Steve Rogers think of this?”
“Of course.” Steve said resigned to the madness of Avengers Tower, his eyes narrowed as he noticed something on the range, “Why is my shield there?”
“Should we contact Clint, do you think?” Steve asked, “Or get the others involved?” He hadn’t fought alongside Rhodey yet, their trip to Leheigh aside, but he’d read about War Machine and knew he’d be a hell of an asset to them, as would Hulk for that matter.
“I see,” Steve said seriously, “And what will he call himself?”
“None of us are innocents.” Natasha coolly stated, “I am a spy, a thief, a manipulator, a liar, and a murderer. Sam and Steve are soldiers, they’ve both fought in wars and taken lives, they have taken more since then in self-defence and the defence of others, as has Tony. We all have blood on our hands, all have stains on our souls, innocence is something that none of us can boast of, including yourself.”
“Don’t.” Zach pouted, sticking out his bottom lip.
“I know this must be a terrible shock for you, but your arm was beyond saving. We did our best but the damage was too severe.”
“Getting back to Hydra.” Steve said, “I don’t even know where to start. Zola said they’ve infiltrated Shield, so does that mean everyone is involved or just a few?”
Bruce snorted while Steve made choking protest, his cheeks flushing crimson again.
“Why?” Steve asked, sounding equal parts angry and frightened, “Why would you do that?” he demanded, he grabbed hold of Tony by the shoulders, turning him around so he was facing him, “Why would you throw your life away like that?”
“Then leave it urgently.” Tony shot back unrepentant and lightly tapped Zach’s fingers as he tried to steal the pizza from his plate, “Don’t think I don’t see what you’re doing you little cheese thief.”
“Think so.” Tony looked over to where Peter was swimming with Zach, keeping a small distance so Zach wouldn’t get over excited and splash him by mistake. “Well, here goes.”
“This is unnecessary, you do realize this, don’t you Captain?” Rhodey said, “For one thing, Tony is a grown man, he’s very capable of making his own decisions, he’s also been married and has two children.”
“Sorry Steve.” Bruce apologised, “The human brain, any brain for that matter gives different readings during sleep, especially in REM sleep.”
“No you won’t Cap.” Tony said, “I’ve room for you too. We’ll head to the Mansion, get cleaned up, eat, and then move your stuff from your apartment.”
Contract of agreement between Avengers and Dynamic Productions.
“Scream and I plunge this into your jugular, got it?”
“Nor does Tony have fake tits, which that bride clearly has.” Natasha scoffed, “They look like a couple of cantaloupes shoved down her dress.”
Over the next eight days the media went wild as news of Tony’s hospitalization and severe injuries were made public.
“What the police will be charging you with.” Steve said, “Over The Winter Soldier murdering Tony’s parents.”
“I didn’t realize I was staying in an asylum.” He said with chuckle.
With a sigh Tony archived the e-mails, planning to look into the pre-schools when he returned to New York. He’d get Pepper’s opinion too, and Happy and Rhodey’s. He would need to thoroughly check out the security of the schools before he sent Zach there.
“Jarvis?” Rhodey asked, the first to recover himself.
“Oh wanna play hard to get, my metallic masturbation fantasy?” Deadpool tilted his head and spoke in a quieter voice, as if he were addressing an audience, “You see, sometimes, no matter how hot and irresistible you are, the object of your desires is not going to give out without you putting in some work.”
At barely six am, Tony was leaped on by a far to awake Zach who latched onto him and wouldn’t let him go back to sleep at all.
Once Peter had MJ’s scent he set about following it, finding the direction she had gone and ran after her. His eye sight was better than hers in the day and at night it was far better which put him at a greater advantage. MJ would have to stay to the paths to avoid tripping over obstacles she might otherwise not see, but Peter could use any path he chose, and could leap up over benches, take the trees and swing himself up and over the children’s climbing frames and swings.
Tower
“You don’t know shit about by world, or about what I have lost.” Steve roared, “I was prepared to die there, but then Lily would have died too. The daughter that Tony loved above anything, whom he would have wanted to live. So I left to ensure that she would live.”
Tony snorted having heard Natasha and Sam looked amused too, Steve shot them a half hearted glare, “Fine.” He agreed, “2pm.”
Tony shrugged, “At least I’ll know where he is.”
Peter sniffed and nodded, “I love you Mamma.” He whispered, it was getting rarer that he said it these days, his teens were encroaching and he was starting to head into the years where terms of endearment were seen as uncool and gross.
“You’re going to be alright.” Steve said to Tony, keeping firm hold of him, “You’re going to be fine. We’re going to be laughing about this later, you’ll be making stupid jokes while I’m fussing over you.” It was a good thing that his face was already wet because it made his tears unnoticeable.
They had been confused by the new, different Captain Steve Rogers who’d appeared on the TV with the Mechanic that Hydra had always been interested in. They heard words they didn’t understand about dimensions and multiverses, and figured that some crazy science thing had happened to bring this Steve here.
He might be Iron Man, but he was also a Billionaire, Zach, as the Pup of a billionaire was a kidnappers dream. Any school Zach went to would have to have air tight security or he simply wouldn’t be safe.
“He’s the strangest Mince Pie I’ve ever seen.” Steve laughed softly, “And the best Christmas present I’ve ever received.”
Something impacted against Steve’s shins and stopped dead, looking down to see an adorable curly haired little boy staring up at him from where he was sat on the pavement having run right into Steve’s legs.
“Mamma!”
The smug look the Captain shot him every time that Tony glared told him that he was well versed in having to get his Tony to eat instead of work all the time and that he would not be able to get away with his usual tricks while under the Captain’s watchful eye. From his left, Pepper kept shooting Steve pleased looks, at his ability to get Tony to eat a decent meal, which would have set Tony sulking at the fact they were ganging up on him, had it not been for the fact that the food was very good, the triple chocolate mousse they had for dessert especially.
Tony shrugged, “I didn’t say they weren’t, but it doesn’t mean you can’t have the support of other heroes does it? And should Thanos attack, we will be ready for him, and with any luck prevent what happened on Steve’s world from happening here.”
*****
“Are we going to tell Bruce and Thor?” He asked as Tony dithered over choosing which car to drive back to the Mansion.
“A year.” Tony said, “To build them and get them launched in space, I would need a year.”
“Tony?” Steve tried to reach out for the Billionaire, but Tony pulled back with a yelp, as if he were afraid of being hurt. He clenched his hands into fists and closed his eyes tight, whispering to himself as he sucked in harsh breath after harsh breath. It was only thanks to the serum having enhanced his hearing that Steve heard Tony speak at all, and what he heard confused him.
“Could be that they are planning to?” Steve suggested, “They could be planning to move all of this?”
Tony shook his head, “Kids.”
Steve felt pinpricks in his hand and glanced down seeing Tony white knuckling his hand. "Will he be alright?" The Billionaire asked in a tight voice.
“You were with Pepper.” And now you’re not, was left unsaid.
“We cannot…”
“Hold your horses babe.” Tony said giving him a grin, “We’ve found one energy reading that matches between my brain and the object, we still have a long way to go before we can neutralize the energy.”
The two of them went out into the corridor just outside of the door so they were still within earshot of the boys.
“Slowly lower him onto the gurney.” A Doctor instructed, her English perfect but accented. “How long has he been unconscious?”
Steve’s eyes narrowed and he looked through the doors at Tony who was helping Zach with his spelling.
“Just say you’ll take care of Zach.” Tony said turning completely serious, “If anything happens to me, take care of him, don’t let someone like Stane anywhere near him.”
“Shell head!”
He was taken through the factory which was practically deserted, to where a tall slim man was waiting.
“I like plums.” He said, “And Winter likes sweet things.”
Curien awoke in pain. His arm, or rather where his arm had been was a blaze of agony. His leg wasn’t much better and his abdomen ached with every inhale and exhale.
“How dare you?” He growled, rising to his feet and towering over Norman. The Businessman stepped back a pace and swallowed hard knowing that he was at a clear disadvantage against such an Alpha.
New York
“Is he still in DC?” Peter asked.
“And you thought that I was making do.” Steve finished making Tony wince, it sounded even worse when spoken outloud, an insult to Steve’s integrity, and Tony did expect Steve to storm out of the bedroom in insulted disgust, but to his amazement Steve did not do that, instead let his shirt fall from his hands crossed the room to take Tony into his arms and kiss him very gently.
“What then?” Natasha growled, advancing on him, her fist raised ready to strike him. Slattery cowered begging her not to hit his face and proclaiming himself to be an actor.
He also impressed everyone by scorching the ground by his feet and making a fireball appear in his palm which he snuffed out as he closed his fist.
“Guys, is everything alright?” Sam called.
Clint Barton’s family.
“It was a limited edition!”
“Uh-huh.” Zach said, “Wanna look at the stars again.”
“You can use my phone.” Sam offered but Tony vetoed that,
“Ha, no pain, no gain.” Clint said picking of bunkers and tanks with the cannon as Natasha floored the accelerator and somehow still managed to steer them through the trees.
Swiftly Tony surveyed the room he was in. The only exit was too far to reach, he was running out of material he could throw in Killian’s path, not that it was helping to slow him down much anyway. He needed to get some distance between the two of them. Scowling, Tony looked up and spied a catwalk above them. Ignoring Killian he calculated the trajectory and took aim with the repulsor, blasting it at the floor which propelled him up into the air and smacked into the catwalk on his side, just between his ribs and pelvis. Scrambling madly he managed to hook his arm over the metal grate of the walk saving himself from what would have been a fifteen foot drop.
“Fine.” Tony grumbled stomping over to help Steve get the tents put up, “But when we are brutally murdered don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“I should think so.” Tony said, he was still leery about letting Zach go to his friends houses, he still had a terror of Zach being kidnapped, but he had met Cal’s parents and knew they were good people and he didn’t want Zach to be without friends or have these kind of fun days, so he forced himself to quash his protective instincts a little and allowed Zach to have play dates.
“I’m not going anywhere.” Steve said slipping a hand through Tony’s, “We’ll do this at your pace, take your time and if you feel uncomfortable we’ll go back to the bank.”
Bruce’s cheeks were glowing by now and not green but red, at the back of his mind Hulk was rumbling with laughter, the oversized bastard was enjoying Bruce’s discomfort!
Baron Von Strucker beheld the sceptre as it lay upon the work table resting in a stand that had been built to house it.
“You mean sexual equality, Racial equality, legalization of homosexuality.”
Peter had then grabbed the purse and run back to the old woman, handing it back to her and made himself scarce. He didn’t dare stick around, he didn’t want to attract attention to himself and was very thankful that the old woman hadn’t told the papers what had happened to her, had just been thankful to have her purse back.
Where in physical terms the Steve Rogers native to this reality was in his late twenties. This new Steve looked to be in the late thirties by Tony’s reckoning, he also held an air of maturity and worldliness that the younger Steve did not.
“Perhaps young Peter’s analogy of Wargs is correct since we now have Ents.” Vision observed to Tony, as he rose onto his left leg, keeping the right off the ground and balanced on his repulsors.
The threat of this made Steve want to fight, but this was not the sort of fight he could win like he did battles against villains. He couldn’t plan a court fight, he had no experience on that, didn’t understand law, he would be defenceless against the system, relying on Lawyers to fight for his family. It made him feel impotent, useless, made him want to go and beat his fists into a punch bag until he’d gotten his frustrations out, and if that was how he was feeling, he could only imagine the turmoil that Tony was suffering as they waited in limbo.
For several minutes the two just lay there breathing heavily, the, after he got full function back in his limbs, Steve went to get a wash cloth to clean them both up with.
“You can have him!” Tony grumbled, “Damn traitor, I am disowning him, you hear me Zach, that’s it, for this treachery you are disowned, cast out, I am putting all your toys on ebay and I will buy a chimpanzee from a zoo to replace you with.”
Despite Bruce’s attempt at reassuring him, Tony wasn’t convinced and wouldn’t relax until the Doctor visited and made a diagnosis.
“No!” Tony stressed. “I don’t need either of you getting food poisoning.”
“Yeah, why don’t you go and get Tony settled into your bed Cap?” Natasha drawled, emphasising Your Bed and bringing colour to Steve’s cheeks, “You can stare into each others eyes while I call Fury and get him to deal with Maximoff.”
Once the base was secured, the Hydra operatives either dead, incapacitated, or run off, Vision went and retrieved the new family, carrying Tony while Steve carried Morgan out of the base to where Natasha and Wanda were waiting with the War Machine and Iron Man armours while Sam and Clint went to get the quinjet.
Rhodey gaped at him, “Are you stoned right now, is that what’s going on?”
A genius.
Tony coughed and spat into the toilet bowl. He hated this, the side effects of the hormones he was taking. The symptoms of early pregnancy were common symptoms, and he was suffering all of them. Sore breasts, metallic taste in his mouth, nausea, vomiting, bloating, water retention, weight gain, and mood swings.
“Shut up!” One of the thugs spat at him.
“Hey, Pete, Zach. I hope you two are behaving for your Uncle Happy, I want you to be very good boys for him, and very brave too.” It was difficult to keep his voice steady and tears were rolling down his cheeks.
So where would he hide….the lab, of course his lab had a bathroom, well a toilet and sink. If he wanted to hide this kind of thing he’d do it there because he was the only one to use it.
Tony had, had enough already, “Alright fuckwit, the Mandarin, the real one, has kidnapped my Son, put one of my best friends in hospital, and my elder Son, not to mention blowing up my house and nearly killing me. I am right at the end of my frigging rope with this shit and if you don’t start talking, I am going to do so much damage to your ugly mug that not even your dentist will be able to identify you!”
“You underestimate Sir.” Jarvis said sounding commiserating, “Sir was merely unhappy that he had not been present for the shooting of fruit and other objects.”
“The judge probably won’t grant it, not full immunity, but he may get a soft ball sentence in a low security prison.” He said to the industrialist, “And his testimony will crucify you.”
Steve’s eyes were on him, baby blue orbs beneath a furrowed brow were searching him out and Tony gave him a weak smile, raising his mug in a mocking salute, “To us basket cases and our fucked up nightmares.”
"They're both fine, you were the only one who got bitten." Steve told him, "You suffered a very bad reaction to the bite, anaphylactic shock the Doctors think, but they'd never seen a case quite like this."
“Dear God,” Sam whispered, looking sickened. He wasn’t the only one. Looking around, the rest of the Avengers looking as horrified by Steve’s tale as Sam did. Even Tony, who had already heard the story.
He spoke to the boys every morning New York Time, while they had their breakfast, and every night before they went to bed.
He watched the family leave feeling that desire for a child of his own stirring inside him again.
Another thing that slowed them down on going to see Harley and his family was the discovery that the Sceptre, which had been secured in Tony’s vault, had gone missing along with some arc reactor prototypes.
Yes Stark was down, he was wounded but that still wasn’t enough, she wanted him to be suffering beyond imagination before he died, she wanted his whole body to be ruined and broken, she wanted him to be beyond begging for mercy before the end, an end that would be a long time coming.
“I’m fine Mamma.” Peter whispered his guilt growing worse for worrying Tony and Steve.
How anyone could have done that to someone Steve had no idea. He knew it was done to corpses to determine cause of death and to teach medical students, but to do it to the living, to a child? The person had to have no conscience or morals at all.
“That’s exactly what I am.” Tony cried, finally meeting Steve’s eyes, “Normal people don’t heal like this, normal people don’t have huge white cell counts, normal people don’t survive having their spleen and aorta rupture inside, of getting their chest full of friggin’ shrapnel.” He snorted, “Guess now I know how I survived open chest surgery in a fucking cave. Anyone else would have bled out or died of blood poisoning, but not me, I get to live with having a lump of metal in my chest cavity, hell, maybe I can survive without the reactor, maybe I’ll survive the shrapnel tearing my heart to pieces, God knows I’ve been told often enough that I don’t have one anyway…”
“People who are scared of things they don’t understand and are too ignorant to want to learn.” Steve explained to Thor.
“It’s Spy Lady!” Zach said with a bright smile, “Hi Spy Lady, have you comed to Spy with Mamma?”
Being around Rogers, being around the Avengers at all, had not done anything for Tony’s self-confidence or esteem. Clint was cool, when he’d been around, but Romanoff and Rogers never let up on berating Tony for every mistake and misstep. Poked holes in armour and ridiculed any attempts he made at friendship overtures. They would also laugh meanly and give Tony pointed looks, whenever Thor compared Tony to Loki, both in appearance, since he was shorter than the rest of the team, darker than them, and had devious and intelligent mind.
“Please.” He said sucking in a breath and choking back the pain in his throat as the phone rang and Happy answered.
“What?” Tony looked from Peter to Steve who looked as perplexed as he felt himself.
“Hey, got some info on the Mandarin, or at least I possibly do. It’s connected to A.I.M. They are based out of Miami and according to Rhodey the military have traced the broadcast signals the Mandarin have been using back to Miami.”
*****
“Relax Feather-head.” Tony said, he was the most relaxed out of everyone. Having had cameras around him all of his life he knew what to expect and how to respond. “Just chill and be yourself, then everything will be fine.”
“Fucked if I know,” he winced and looked down at the infant, “Don’t tell your Mommy and Daddy that I swore, okay sweetiepie?”
“Tony.” Steve admonished.
“They took her!” Tony cried out, “They took my daughter!”
Tony didn’t need to say anything more, Steve was right with him, heading to the lift and going down to the lobby bare foot and in a pair of sleeping pants, just as Tony was in one of Steve’s shirts and a pair of boxer shorts.
“He mistook you for someone else.” A lie, the asset could read lies too, he was always being lied to. No one ever told him the truth.
“Watch it, or you are going into Time Out.” Tony grumbled as he tried to keep his legs from buckling under his body as Steve lowered him back onto the floor. “This had better be life or death or I’mm cutting off Pepper’s Jimmy Choo allowance!”
Tony put an arm around Peter’s shoulder’s “Peter was extremely traumatized by what he went through, he was in a coma for days.” He said glaring at Norman. “And he was too ill to return to school for weeks.”
Tony panted and moaned, he was beyond speech, beyond anything but fulfilling his bodies desire, he writhed beneath Steve, trying to pull him in closer and hold him in deeper. Steve’s alpha was strong, wanting to utterly posses Tony but he still had enough sense to be careful and not unleash his full strength not wanting to damage the Omega, he came swiftly and paused panting, his knot only half formed and Tony still in the throes of heat, he wouldn’t come until Steve’s not had fully expanded which could take another couple of ejaculations with Tony in heat. The Alpha’s body would ejaculate more semen to further ensure a conception, and once Steve had regained his breath his cock began to harden again for the second bout.
As soon as MJ cut the alarms Peter broke through the door and marched into the lab. He make out shapes of things but it was too dark to see anything clearly. Fumbling around he found a light switch and gagged at the what he saw.
Starting from his sleep over at Ned’s and his first successful patrol of the city, Peter began to go out onto the streets regularly. On his first night out, with Ned and MJ in contact with him via their phones, he had stopped three muggings, a couple of drunks brawling, two drug deals, and had the embarrassment of seeing a hooker doing her business with a punter in an alley.
So much blood, and even more had been dripping down onto the floor of the quinjet, a puddle of it had formed beneath the stretcher despite Bruce’s pressure on the wounds.
Steve winced and nodded, “I’ll be right there.”
Tony went to the bathroom and took several minutes washing his hands and face. Staring at himself in the mirror he could see the weight of stress bearing down upon him, his eyes were bloodshot from a lack of sleep, his hair was a mess, his beard untrimmed and cheeks bristling with stubble, he looked a mess and felt like a mess, and fuck, his life was a mess right now, his kids lives were a mess and it was his fault.
“What would you think about me and your Mamma maybe having another Pup or two?”
He was still scared shitless over Social Services becoming involved, so far there had been no sign that they would do so, but the possibility was hanging over his head like a damn sword.
Everyone was there of course, sitting around the table with mugs of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate, glasses of juice, and plates waiting for the pancakes, bacon, sausage, and eggs that Steve was cooking up.
Rogers had found his face could get him into practically anywhere, and while being someone that people recognised did have its downsides, but in cases like this, where he could walk into one of the biggest hotels in Manhattan and be allowed to go through to a gala, it definitely made the downsides worth it.
A Patriotic Affair.
“Take a seat, Champ.” Happy said pulling out a stool for Peter to sit on, Bruce busied himself making tea and getting cookies out which he set on the table.
“I’m sure that could be discussed.” Pepper said.
“Sir…?”
Zach closed his eyes tight and held his breath waiting for more pain to begin but the pain never struck as suddenly there came the sound of an explosion followed by Killian swearing and taking his hands away. Zach let out the breath he’d been holding and strained his upper body to sit up, looking about the lab and at the computer monitors which showed the outside of the factory and the destroyed gates where War Machine had set down and was firing at everything that moved. Two other monitors showed The Black Widow, and Hawkeye at different points in the factory, Hawkyeye from a vantage point shooting at Killian’s men and Natasha fighting on the ground.
He wasn’t even aware of the tears that were spilling down his cheeks until the principal handed him a tissue and awkwardly patted his shoulder.
Tony allowed the teenagers to stay up until One AM as it was Friday and they wouldn’t have to be up early on the Saturday, he then sent them off to bed, wishing Peter a goodnight before going to bed himself with Steve.
“Chatter.” Steve said, “What have I said about the coms being for important information only?”
“So you think that going public is the right way to go?” Rhodey asked, raising at eyebrow at the drool Lily was depositing on Tony’s shirt!
“Whats all the excitement then?” He asked,
“You can put your hand right through it.” Tony said to him making Steve startle and his cheeks flush. “Go ahead, it’s fine, you won’t damage anything.”
Tony pulled Peter into his arms and hugged him tight as Peter sobbed against his shoulder.
“House arrest?” Bucky asked, having not heard the term before.
“A date.” Peter corrected, “And I don’t know, I guess it depends on whether or not it works out.”
Tony swallowed hard, conversations about Obie were never easy, he had tried very hard to forget the bastard, but Zach didn’t know that and he had every right to speak about his Father, Tony knew he was getting curious about the man who’d Fathered and he was dreading having to explain the truth to Zach, frankly because he had no idea what to say.
One week after Peter’s suspension, Himself, Steve, Peter, Harry, and Norman were gathered at the school with the Principal and several members of the school board to discuss the fight and Norman’s demands for Peter to be permanently excluded from the school.
“Damn right I hit you!” Steve shot back, as he helped Tony get to his feet. “How dare you speak to Tony like that, let alone raise your hand to him.” Steve looked Rogers over, his top lip pulling back to reveal his perfect top teeth and his nostrils flaring as if he smelt something unpleasant. “You walk around all puffed up and proud, convinced of your own superiority and entitlement, when you are nothing more than a common back alley bully throwing your weight around on those smaller than you.”
So far they had found quite a few anemones, a hermit crab, some mussels, and plenty of shells which Zach and Peter had collected and put in their bucket.
Tony sniffed and wiped at his face, “Why can’t kids remain cute and innocent, why do they have to become teenagers? Its like they become demonically possessed the second hormones hit their blood.”
The Merc with a mouth studied him and Steve with his head tilted to one side, “God, I so need a camera to capture this moment. I wanna take a picture and put it on my bedroom ceiling so I’ve got inspiration for my morning wood!”
“Well fuck me and leave me fifty on the dresser, if I’d have known I’d be seeing two Captain Amazing Assess wrestling, I’d have got dressed up!”
As it was DC the roads weren’t totally clear even at half one in the morning, but they were quieter and there was less chance of Tony hitting anyone when he ran red lights.
“Who said they’d be indecent.” Tony replied with a shrug, “They could be very decent acts, I wasn’t suggesting we do anything really kinky, I was gonna leave tying you up to the privacy of our bedroom!”
Years of military experience had Rhodey ducking and dodging out of the way, taking refuge behind a parked car. He silently cursed as his trousers tore at the knees and the gravel ripped into his flesh as they took the brunt of the fall as he was not able to use his hands which were keeping Lily pressed against his chest.
“Head in via the woods, the trees will give you cover.” Sam advised, “We’ll attack from above and try to drive the troops out to you.”
“Holy shit, you’re Tony Stark!”
“Stark!” Clint yelled,
Gulping Peter leaped at the ceiling and began to climb back to the sky light, “I said stop!”
“What do you mean? You are still you, Tony. You just have a few extra goodies, but you are still my Tony, nothing will change that. Not Howard, not white blood cells, not even puss leaking sores the size of a tomato growing over your skin!”
Steve looked up from his daughter, gazing into Reed’s tired eyes, “I don’t know if I can survive,” he said, “I’ve lost everything Reed! My Husband, my friends, my home, I’ll be all alone again, in a world I don’t belong in!”
“That is enough Tony!” Rogers snapped, “There is no need to get insulting, and you know that Wanda has been through a lot, cut her some slack won’t you?” Tony opened his mouth to respond to that, but Rogers wasn’t done, “You might own the building, but we are The Avengers, and we are the ones who have the right to decide what goes on in our building.” He straightened up, standing to his full height, towering over Tony, using his mass to intimidate the smaller man, “Besides, you are on very thin ice after all you have done lately.”
“I’m scared Steve.” Tony said, “I’m scared for Peter, for his future. We don’t know that we’ll be able to help him get control of his temper, what this enhancement will do to him.” He bit his bottom lip and shook his head, “He’s so young Steve, he shouldn’t be dealing with this, he shouldn’t be struggling and worrying about this.” He clenched his fist in frustration, “I should have the answers for him, I should be able to fix this for him.”
Very weird.
Peter scuffed his foot on the lab floor, “You were right though I was showing off and shouldn’t have been.”
It was late afternoon by the time the raft was completed and Steve had caught another three fish which set them at a fish a piece for dinner. Before he got on with preparing them, he helped push the raft out into the lake and waded out with Zach riding on the raft, the only one light enough to do so.
“They were attacked by Hydra.” Bruce said, “They escaped but want to remain hidden so that Hydra can’t find them.”
“How about we take the day off?” Steve said, “Just leave work alone for a day and go to Central Park, or Coney Island, or just sit around watching movies all day?” Tony frowned,
Peter bit the inside of his lips looking guiltily at Tony, his shoulders slumped and he ducked his head quietly making his way to his room wishing he could take back his words.
“Science snob.” Peter muttered.
“Sir, are you well?”
Steve paced the halls with the others as they waited for news from the Doctors, who had been babbling about broken bones, internal bleeds, and medical jargon that meant nothing to Steve but Bruce seemed to comprehend it and sank down into a chair, hunching over looking pensive.
The guards nervously looked at one another, weighing their odds with hand guns against Tony’s suit, “I’ll count to five.” Tony said.
“I was and still am an artist. During my down time I would sketch a lot, even doing caricatures of myself and the Howling Commandos. Creating comic book adventures for us. My friend Bucky decided they were good enough to publish and sent them off to the New York Times, who liked them so much the ran a strip in the paper, which eventually became weekly comic books, dubbed Captain America.”
Steve was trying very hard to convince himself of that, to believe that and only that, not to entertain the thought that Tony might not make it.
Sokovia.
Clint shoved past Natasha and grabbed the Skrull by its shirt, dragging it back and slammed it against the wall. “What does that mean?” He snarled into the creatures face.
Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy were Tony’s next visitors, Pepper and Happy were uncertain and tense having had no experience of dealing with a permanently disabling injury, Rhodey on the other hand had dealt with plenty of them, he’d seen many airmen suffer similar injuries, or amputations and had learned how to deal with it and relax.
Steve chuckled and kissed Tony’s head, he knew that Tony was joking but a part of him wished they could keep Peter and Zach small. They seemed to grow up so fast, Peter especially, it was way too fast, all too soon they’d be completely grown up and going off to college and living their own lives.
Nassau Hospital.
“It’s a Whale.”
Natasha was besides him, dragging herself along the ground with her hands, pulling her ruined legs behind her leaving a trail of blood in her wake, when she lifted her head to look at Tony, blood poured out of her mouth, a thick crimson flood that soaked the ground beneath her.
“Well at first it was painful.” Peter explained recalling the first few weeks, “Every noise was so loud that I thought I’d go mad from the sound and the lights were so bright that my eyes felt like they were burning. I felt sick all the time, the smell of everything was overwhelming and making me nauseous and I couldn’t stand anything but pure cotton on my skin. Even food was a problem because the taste was so extreme, I could only eat really plain bland stuff, like an apple, or porridge made with water, no milk or anything to sweeten it.”
“You’ve nothing to be sorry for sweetheart.” Steve assured Tony, reaching out and locking his fingers into Tony’s hand, he was briefly heartened by Tony’s fingers tightening around his until he realised how weak the grip was and how cool Tony’s body felt. “Baby hold on, I know it hurts but please just hold on for me.”
“We do Sir, we will begin the trials right away.”
Tony rolled his eyes, “Can’t you sing another song, Romanoff? You’re starting to sound like a record with the needle stuck in a groove.”
“Stay still baby.” Steve said he looked down at the wound in Tony’s back and felt his stomach turn over.
“Yeah, it’s a form of punishment without a person going to prison. They are electronic tagged and made to remain in their homes between certain times of the day, but they can still move freely otherwise and interact with their families and so on.” Tony swiftly explained.
“So she decapitates me for being the messenger, thanks boss!” Happy yelled after him.
Maybe he could get up, slip away into the bathroom and take care of his little problem before Tony woke up.
“Sir considered it, but figured that Thor could return to Asgard when he wishes and so would not require a safe house in a country safe from extradition.”
“Hey Lily, it’s alright, we’re safe now,” Steve cooed to her, he became impossibly tender and gentle that he completely belied his size. He was bigger than the Steve that Tony knew. His shoulders were easily a foot wider than the Steve from this reality, he was a couple of inches taller too, his eyes were darker a more brilliant and vivid blue than the pale baby blues that this reality’s Steve had, and  he was older.
If anyone could keep The Black Widow and the Mind Raping Witch away from him it was Stark. He knew about the Maximoff creature from the news, knew that the Black Widow was in league with her. After escaping Hydra he was never going back to having his mind taken from him and turned into a puppet for someone’s amusement.
Peter groaned and rolled over, nearly clocking Steve in the face with a flailing hand.
Steve snorted and rolled his eyes, he went and put the wash cloth back in the bathroom, then re-joined Tony in the bed. “Perhaps I will be rescuing you from evil villains.” He said, “And in gratitude you will give yourself to me.”
“Perception is everything.” Norman agreed, “And I need people to perceive me as innocent in this business.”
“I figure we’ll need money in the US.” He said, “We can exchange the cash for dollars when we get there.”
Steve jolted awake and sat bolt up right, fists clenched and muscles tensed ready to fight, he relaxed after a second when his brain caught up with his body and realised that there was no threat, just an over excited child.
“Mr Stark the Social Services are here…”
Tony smiled humourlessly and tried to sound casual, “Yeah, well, you know how it is these days, then camera adds ten pounds and if I’m not careful middle age with start spreading…”
“I’m sorry.” Steve said, “I shouldn’t have… it won’t happen again.” Steve was closing in on himself, his shoulders hunching as he avoided Tony’s gaze.
The Portal sputtered and flared for a moment, then faded away leaving the figure standing in Tony’s lab.
With a small smile Natasha cut in, “Putting levity and Stark’s pyromaniacal tendencies aside for the moment, I think it would be best to stay on track?”
“It’s my Ten-Thousand Calorie challenge video.” Clint explained about a mouthful of pancake. “These things are Youtube gold.” Natasha said something cutting in Russian that had Tony snickering and Clint place a hand on his heart, a wounded expression on his face.
“Always Sir.” Jarvis replied, Steve was also wearing a com and could hear him too, as could the others.
"Okay I'll Natasha and ask her to get him." Steve said, taking his phone out of his pocket and swiping the screen, he brought up his contacts and called Natasha who answered after a single ring.
“Again!” Tony insisted.
******
The peak of the Empire State building.
“I’m safe, for now.” Natasha replied, “I have some bolt holes I can hide out in. What happened to you, me and Fury were attacked by Rumlow and his men, they were in Hydra uniforms, or I assume they were Hydra by the insignia on them.”
Stark may not have wanted for any of this to happen, but he chose to become Iron Man, he chose to withhold his weapon from the American Government, he chose to continue being this icon which naturally singles him out from others and in doing so he put his family at risk.
“Watch it, or I’ll dunk you and leave you down there permanently.” Tony growled at Clint. The archer stuck his tongue out and settled down to enjoy the sun for a while.
“Because I’m not.” Tony said, “I’m not your Tony. I’m not young anymore, I’m not perfect, and…”
The asset was ready. His mission had been given to him, his targets identified, all that was remaining was a location, something that was changing it seemed.
Steve lowered Tony down onto his feet and the three wavered uncertainly for a moment until the driver of the car got out and shouted for them to get down as she aimed a hand gun and fired at the Hydra agents following them, when the clip was spent she shouted at them to get in the car, ducking back into the driving seat.
Rogers’ face darkened and he took a menacing step forward, “How dare you?”
Tony smiled and let out a sigh of relief, “Good job big guy.” He said, squeezing Bucky’s hand a little, “Okay, just keep your other hand where they can see it and don’t struggle.” He advised as the Police came closer. “It’s fine fellers, the Sergeant is cooperating, but he is very nervous and distressed, so please don’t do anything to make this worse.” Tony said to the Police, “I’m going with him to whatever station you decide to take us too and I am calling my lawyers.”
“And its not like I’ll be fighting anyone.” He reasoned with himself as he opened the storage bin and began to go through the Kevlar, choosing the largest cuts that he could use to make himself a suit. He wouldn’t have enough for full body protection but he would be able to cover his chest, abdomen, and his back.
That brought a grin to Peter’s face as he imagined himself as a superhero. What would he call himself he wondered, Extra-sensory Man, Hyperaware Man. Super-High-Five?
“We’d have penny sweets when we could afford them and read comics, pretend we were gangsters on the run from the law, or soldiers guarding our base. Our mothers would be at their wits end with us coming home filthy, our shoes scuffed, and trousers torn.
“Really?” Tony looked at him in surprise, “Okay, I guess I can make you something, you won’t need it in Kevlar.”
“You need to treat your own wounds Cap.” Tony said, feeling very exposed before the alpha and male beta. He never used to have an issue showing off his body, but that had been before Afghanistan, his chest was littered with scars centred mainly around the arc reactor which glowed brightly from his chest, he was also very aware that his body was not what it had been before he’d had Zach. While he had lost the weight he’d gained during the pregnancy, his core muscles were not as strong and his belly not as flat as it had been, he had stretch marks and his pelvis was wider, the muscles having been stretched by the pregnancy and birth.
The silence that followed made Peter wish he could die, while MJ might have meant well, she’d just increased the attention on him ten-fold.
“No, I’m definitely not.” He replied.
That was a fair point, Norman was smart when it came to playing the stock market but on practical things like that he was useless and as for innovation, he had less imagination than a by the book physics teacher.
The Avengers showing up at Harley’s School and them singling him out to join them on the stage at the front of the school during assembly sent Harley’s popularity sky rocketing.
Sighing, he poured a cup of coffee and lifted it to his lips to take a sip, only to drop the cup, shattering it on the floor, as a blinding white light exploded in the lab, a swirling vortex appeared in the centre of the light, spreading out until it was six foot by six foot.
Rolling over on his bunk, Steve looked at Natasha sleeping soundly as only a soldier could, having learned to just fall asleep whenever and wherever they got the chance to conserve energy, and Wanda, curled up in a ball in the bunk beneath.
“Umm, Dad said I’m grounded until next week and can only use the internet for school work.” Peter said, “Would researching how to make some kind of web like spider silk count as school work?”
“Yes lag-brain. And there was some messed up shit on there. Like crazy ass experiments. Stuff to make hybrids, and I don’t mean Cockapoos or Ligers and stuff, but like breeding cross bred animals for like military use.”
Pepper’s eyes widened and her mouth did an almost comical Oh shape before her face creased with sympathy and concern.
Steven Grant Rogers 2023.
“What, like an understudy, absolutely not!” Trevor seemed insulted by the suggestion.
If Tony hadn’t killed Stane, then Steve would have gladly done so; he would have taken his time on it too, made the swine suffer for all the pain he’d inflicted on Tony, was still inflicting even now he was gone.
“It’s likely Zach’s been taken by the Mandarin.” He said shakily, “I have to find this fucker, there has to be something connecting him here, he’s been blowing shit up all over the place.”
“That’s right champ, no one wants to see any dangly bits.” Sam said taking a sip of his orange juice, “So remember to keep your pants on at all times.”
“You will die alone, fool!” Proxima declared to Rhodey,
The reporters and journalists quietened down, and Pepper glanced down at her notes noticing that her hands were shaking, not much, but enough for her to notice and despise her bodies weakness for it. She cleared her throat and began to speak;
Steve didn’t care that Tony’s hair was greying, didn’t care if it went completely white or all fell out. He didn’t care if Tony’s skin turned bright green, if he sprouted a second head (expect for the double amount of talking) he was in love with Tony for Tony, not for his appearance. Okay so visual attraction did still play a part, but a few extra pounds, a few more lines and wrinkles, and some greys didn’t radically change anything.
Fuck. Fuck to the power of fuck, fuck! This was not how Tony wanted this to go.
Steve snorted and without even thinking about it pulled the Omega into a hug, burying his face into soft dark hair, “Thank you, so much for this.” He said holding Tony close.
“Uh huh, back in school my friends say maths is hard but it’s easy.” Zach said, mayonnaise smeared over his lips and dripping down his chin, his happiness dimmed slightly as he thought of his friends and the school he was separated from.
“Indeed they did, especially Wanda’s.” Jarvis confirmed, “There is a lot of footage of her, most of which I suggest you do not view as it is….disturbing to say the least, especially when she is using her powers on her test subjects.” The team grimaced, if an AI found the footage disturbing that it had to be horrific, “Other tests revealed that Wanda became especially volatile when shown images of Sir, dangerously volatile to any around her.”
*****
Stark Tower.
Those dreams had been hard enough to deal with, they’d left him shaken for days afterwards. But they’d not been every night and he’d been able to comfort himself with the knowledge that Obie was dead, Raza was dead, the Ten Rings had been destroyed, they could never come for him or his family again.
Steve’s suspicions were proven correct, as he sat at the kitchen counter, feeding Lily her breakfast, while Tony downed a succession of three cups of coffee in the time it took Steve to drink one!
Harry smiled as best he could with his mangled mouth, “I want him to hurt, Dad, I want him to hurt like he made me hurt.”
“What is it with Tony Stark and the universal belief that he is not perfect?” He asked very quietly, “Is it some kind of blind spot you all have in you that keeps you from seeing how beautiful you are?”
“Um weren’t you just bitching me out for practicing unsafe weight lifting experiments with him?” Steve asked Tony.
Over several weeks Peter managed to gain control of his senses and was able to expose himself to more materials, flavours, scents, light, and sound.
His partner and children.
He knew Tony was struggling, not knowing exactly how to help his Son; the ice cream trip had been partly to get Zach out of the tower to Tony could speak to Pepper and see if she had any advice for him.
******
Steve tried to picture himself and Tony then, ten, fifteen, and twenty years from now. Would they still be avenging or would they retire somewhere peaceful, maybe to that Island of Tony’s where they could just lay in the sun all day and probably complain about their greying hair and aching joints, assuming Steve could even get aching joints and grey hair.
“So I will be hearing from you on a regular basis then Sir!” Jarvis shot back, “And while we are on the subject, your blood work has come in, your cholesterol is a little high.”
“Cool, although not the junk food part, at least not for me.” Tony said, “Not all of us have enhanced metabolisms and at my age everything goes to my ass already.”
Proxima went down and one of the Hyena’s flew at Bucky, getting webbed by Peter before its jaws could land on him, “OHMYGOD they’re Wargs, there are wargs!” Peter cried,
The tears Peter had been holding onto began to break free as soon as he sat down and he buried his face in Pepper’s chest, shaking as she rubbed his back.
Steve cleared his throat, “Has there been any news from Rhodey and Vision yet?”
“Yeah, I guess so.” Steve murmured pulling Tony in closer as they neared other couples, the Omega’s scent was stronger and Steve felt the stirrings of arousal, Tony would be in full heat by morning and Steve had to fight the urge to sweep him up into his arms and carry him away to a nest right then and there.
“Pizza and burgers.” Steve agreed going into the lift, “We’ll hit some obstacles on the run, jump some benches and such, get your agility working too. If you enjoy it maybe, we can make a regular session a few times a week.”
“Yeah, at least then I won’t end up legless….” Tony trailed off and frowned thoughtfully, “Jay, if I can use these braces to move my legs, why couldn’t I use them to walk, outside of the suit as well as inside of it?”
The press were just as bad, swarming like wasps, wanting interviews, soundbites, photos, anything that they could print. Steve and he had to fight their way through them everytime they went to get food or go home.
“It means gives.” Tony explained, “Now, why don’t you go and draw a picture of Uncle Platypus in his armour, and don’t forget the big guns he has on it.”
Zach frowned and opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly he was being encased in the Iron Man armour, “Mamma!” He yelled struggling against the metal chassis that was big enough to fight almost his entire body.
“We’ve got to calm him down.” Natasha cried, backing up as Zach’s screaming grew louder and he began to melt the tiles on the floor and scorch the ceiling tiles above him. His little body shuddered and there was a wild look in his eyes, a frightened panic shining in them, that increased as he began to pant. He wasn’t just having a fit of rage now, he was going into a panic attack and that fear was feeding into his powers making them that much more intense.
“Really?” Pepper asked, “Will there be much point? It’s been more than twenty years, I don’t think there’ll be much left to find.”
Natasha was of course the best at skating, her poise and grace which she had learned from ballet made her able to glide over the ice practically effortlessly, Bruce and Clint alternated between supporting each-other and helping each-other back up when they fell, Steve had never skated before so he ended up on his backside several times much to the amusement of Zach and Peter. He’d been concerned at first that being on the ice might trigger another panic attack, but he found himself enjoying his time there, eventually finding his balance and was able to make several turns around the ice.
Tony gave Clint a shark like smile, “Feel free to drop dead of Ebola, Barton!” Trying not to eye Steve up as they went to the lift, he turned and called over his shoulder, “Don’t mess up my tower!”
“A Starfish!” Excitedly Zach jumped up and ran over to the rock pool, kneeling down to have a look, “See those shells sticking to the rocks? Those are limpets. And you see right down on the bottom, there’s the Starfish.”
“It’ll be alright, trust me.”
Zach scowled at her shoving his ice cream away, "Lies." He said sticking out his bottom lip in a pout, "If he were fine, they would be here, they'd take me to the hospital to see Pete."
“I am so very sorry for your loss, Mr Stark.” Vision said, meaning Tony’s parents. “Though I cannot imagine your pain, I can, perhaps empathize with what the loss must feel like.”
A horrid feeling of helplessness filled Steve. He was on his own here, Natasha had gone to stay at Clint’s until after the new year, Sam was still in DC, Thor was God knows where, Bruce was hulked out, Pepper was being taking to a hospital, or Steve assumed she was, Rhodey was incommunicado on his mission, and Tony was….
“That means no.” Tony took Peter into his bedroom and sat down on his bed, “Talk to me, Munchkin.”
Seeing what they were doing, Steve stopped beating the shield into Thanos’ face and wedged it into his gauntlet to prevent him closing his fist. Roaring Thanos back handed Steve across the battle field and grabbed at the shield to pull it free, but he was too late, Tony lunged at him, grabbing onto his arm and yanked at the damaged flesh, ripping it off with an arc of blood.
Red and black spots were beginning to dance in front of his stinging eyes and his head was feeling heavier and heavier. His entire body was growing numb as everything seemed to be fading away.
“Well he could but I don’t think…”
Single Mamma Stark.
“A decent computer terminal, long-nose pliers, wire cutters ad wire strippers, tweezers, and a full welding kit.” Tony listed.
Jarvis zoomed into Sokovia, going to a town on the outskirts of which a large castle sat upon the mountainside with woods on either side.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, at least making the effort not to laugh. Besides him Peter yawned and blinked owlishly looking adorably disoriented. Tony’s head popped up from the side of the bed and he glared at Zach.
“We had fish for dinner, Daddy caught them with a spear.” Zach told Rhodey, “And we made a raft that I rode on, and went on a big climb, and this lizard sat on me and Peter said it would eat me!”
“They approached me, with a role.” Trevor said, “And they knew about the drugs.”
“Isn’t that a little mean?” Steve asked as he zipped up their tent flap and crawled into the sleeping space where Tony was stripping down to…..nothing?
Again Tony laughed but inside his mind he immediately began to think about a repulsor powered wheelchair, maybe he could design a combat one too, or perhaps he could fit a cradle into an armour to support his body from the waist down, perhaps even make the limbs work while he was in it.
“His white cell count is abnormally high. Yet he showed no signs of prior illness or injury, not even a minor infection or virus that his body could have been fighting. He also responded to treatment with far greater speed than would have been expected. Remarkable speed in fact.”
His little sister Emma was jealous at first, until she was gifted half a dozen new dolls with accessories and a custom made doll house from Tony. At this her face lit up and she threw her arms about his waist hugging him as tightly as she could.
Tony didn’t mind sharing his bed with his Son once in a while, but with Zach running into his room every night for over a week it was starting to get worrying.
Twisting away from Steve Zach reached out towards Tony, breaking Steve’s heart as he cried out for him and began to beg Tony to wake up.
“Damn,” Sam said looking Steve over, “I wouldn’t mind that myself.”
With Bucky back and Rhodey in America for the foreseeable future Tony began to reach out to other superheroes to set up a network for big scale attacks like New York. He made alliances with Spider Man, Ant Man and the Wasp. The Black Panther who actually approached the Avengers as the Young King T’Challa was looking to end the isolationism of Wakanda and open the country up to the world.
“You like that he gives you shit,” Steve said, grinning fondly at Tony, who nodded,
The sofa and coffee table looked like they belonged in the shared apartment of a poor college kid who was struggling to pay rent, tuition, and was having to make do with ratty old furniture that should have been thrown onto a dump a decade earlier, not the state of art futuristic lab of Tony Stark. Steve suspected that there was a story that went with these pieces of furniture, that they held some kind of special place in Tony’s heart and that was why he hadn’t thrown them out. At some point he’d ask about them, either Tony, or Rhodey, as the Omega’s oldest friend if anyone knew why Tony had these things then it would be him.
“Yes, thank you Bob.” Tony cleared his throat and sat up as straight as his back brace would allow, “As you are aware I suffered severe injuries while on an avengers mission two weeks ago. I was outside of my armour and exploring the lab that belonged to Hydra when I was shot by an enhanced individual at point blank range while my back was turned.
“Hellair!” The toddler parroted,
“A computer tablet.” Tony said rolling his eyes, “And Jarvis, get J in here, we need to start designing a whole new suit with prosthetic limbs that will work without nerve impulse.”
Tony then turned serious and pulled Steve into a hug, “Really though, thank you. You didn’t have to do that, put yourself at the mercy of the media, that was very brave even for Captain America.”
“If I may?” Vision interjected, “I think that we should focus on the greater matter?”
“Dumbass, he’s not wearing spandex.”
Maybe they would be welcoming grandchildren into the world, Peter and Zach having children of their own, Christ, now that was a terrifying thought.
Their meals consisted of what the team brought in for them and what they could get in the cafeteria, both grimacing at the terrible coffee but drinking it anyway to force their tired bodies to stay awake. Sleep was consisting of an hour or two snatched sleep in the chairs by Peter's bed.
The UN gave a unanimous vote of agreement to Tony building the weapons to guard the planet stipulating that they be given half of the command codes needed to trigger them, and that the remaining codes be held by Tony and Vision.
“I know.” Tony whispered, “I love you Steve and I’m sorry about all this.”
“This is like a high school wet dream come true, or was it a pot induced hallucination in which I was butt naked and in the showers with Steve Rogers?”
“A no no word?” Thor asked curiously.
His physical strength had also increased greatly, something that was discovered by accident. Bruce had been shifted some lab equipment and it had toppled over, Peter had grabbed it and lifted it with ease not realising until after he’d done it that he’d been lifted four-hundred pounds without so much as a grimace.
“Maybe you can become a professional skater.” Peter said wiping his mouth which had a chocolate moustache.
Every Superhero in the world was on alert and had taken to the streets along with the military to defend the shelters against Thanos’s forces.
“No, Tony, don’t go in alone…” Tony disconnected before Rhodey could complete the sentence.
Sam immediately began to protest, offering Steve his own bed while Tony scoffed at Steve’s chivalry,
“Chocolate!” Zach yelled ever eager to indulge his sweet tooth,
There was an endless amount to go through, and with him not being an Avenger anymore he had more time to spare on them, especially on the Winter Soldier, whom he was still trying to search for.
She’d blurted out that she had invaded Tony’s mind in Strucker’s base in Sokovia, as she sat at the kitchen counter with Steve, sipping at hot chocolate and munching on cookies.
He spun around and turned his attention upon the scientist, “You have the test subjects ready?” He asked.
Sometimes Peter would join in, using his gangly growing limbs to cling onto Steve’s back and hang off his shoulders, helping his brother to pull Steve to the ground and pound him with pillows.
“And you’re all about style.” Steve sneered, he felt his cheeks colour as Stark looked him over.
‘He protected us, Got between cops and us.’ Winter said in Bucky’s head, ‘He is good for us.’
When Peter awoke again it was to Zach sitting on his stomach grinning at him and holding up a sketch pad with crayon writing on it.
“Wait!” Tony cried, holding a hand up to the cops, “We got this, just… wait.” He looked pleadingly at Bucky, “Please, you came to me for help and I will help you, but you have to trust me now, which I know is asking a lot, but I need you to do as I say and let these guys take you in. I’ll go with you and I will stay with you the whole time, I swear I won’t leave you.”
Clint burst out laughing while Tony gaped at his son in utter shock at the treachery there. “I love this kid.” Clint declared, ruffling Zach’s hair.
“Gotcha Cap, and you want to make this special.”
Bruce cleared his throat and stammered as he tried to answer the question, while wondering how it was possible that such adorable chocolate brown eyes seemed to pin him in place more than an academic board of assessors ever had.
“Pocket-sized!”
“See, I told you it was a good idea.” Steve said,
“I’ll burn you alive!” Killian roared at him, he grabbed Tony by the repulsor covered hand and began to heat up the metal, burning Tony’s hand as he did so. “Everything you are I will destroy!” He seethed at the Billionaire, grabbing him about the throat, “Your legacy will be ashes!”
“God spare me from sulky AI’s.” Tony grumbled going to the oven where he was cooking Bacon, sausages, and eggs. He turned the sausages, swearing when he burned his fingers but continued to use them anyway. “FRI, the sausages are looking burned.” He complained,
Thor wore a pair of scanty, skin tight swimming trunks that were only just longer than a speedo, he was also carrying a bucket and spade as he had read that making sand castles was a Midgardian tradition when visiting the beach.
Desserts were served with a sweet dessert wine, a choice of Chocolate lava cakes topped with vanilla ice cream, strawberry and macadamia mille feuille, or lime and mascarpone souffle.
“They can’t get here, they are far away.”
Not all the news crews were pro homosexuality at least, nor all groups for that matter, several of which had taken to making him one of their figureheads, something that made Rogers flush with pride at being though of as righteous and heroic enough to be made into a figurehead again in this modern era.
“You’re still stiff.” Natasha said, “You need to loosen up in your pelvis, bend your knees more so you can lean your full body weight into the swing.”
“Buh buh,” Lily agreed, blowing a raspberry,
Aldrich Killien’s attack on Tony Stark and his family.
“Pete…,”
“Miss Potts wants confirmation that you are cancelling the party.” Natalie said eyeing the blackened veins on Tony’s neck.
Tony smiled faintly, “Maybe you should tell him that,”
“Go for it.” Tony said walking backwards away from the storage facility.
The building should have been vaporized, but thanks to Hammer tech being as shit as it was that hadn’t happened.
Steve was on his knees before Tony in a second, taking his hand and stroking at his wet hair.
By the end of the explanation Sam had not only poured them all a glass of scotch each, which Tony pushed away, he hadn’t had a drink since before Zach was born and he wasn’t going to start again now. But Sam also got the ben and jerry’s out of the freezer and a couple of spoons from the draw saying that this called for comfort food and alcohol.
“You can.” He said, “But you and Zach will be responsible for caring for them.”
And that whatever food was in their vicinity, whether they would like it or not, the children automatically assumed they had taste testing privileges so he was very often sharing his food with Zach and Peter, and if they liked what he was eating, he would be leaving his own food to grow cold while he cooked more for them.
In truth he did not. Oh, he had shed tears when she had died, but he had never felt the loss the way Steve had described or been as bereft as Thor now seemed. His heart not felt broken when she had been placed in the ground with Howard, and soon Tony’s tears had dried for her.
“Well, I have a broken bone in my arm which is going to take time healing,” Tony explained, “This cast helps protect and support my arm while it heals.”
Pale faced and breathing hard with pain, Clint half sat up and looked over to the others, “How is he?” He asked.
“You want to shower next?” Steve asked him and Peter nodded, he went to the draws and got himself a clean T-Shirt and shorts to wear, padding into the bathroom when Tony came out with Zach, both of them refreshed, Zach was wearing one of Tony’s band T-Shirts which hung on him like a night shirt, under it he had on a pair of underpants but no shorts. Tony was similarly attired in a pair of boxers and a vest top.
Opening the window to his bedroom Peter looked out into the City. It was fine night, the air cool but not cold and there was no rain. The drop was rather terrifying and Peter had to steal himself as he climbed out onto the ledge. Taking a deep breathe he balanced himself before he stood up and reached out to place his hands on the wall, and fired the web fluid onto the wall. It affixed to the wall and Peter tugged on it hard to check before he trusted his weight onto it.
“Seven Bird-brain, every one is welcome to the lab to see Mt Stark erupt.” Tony declared, “The film crew too.”
Tony bit his lip, “He did. He was a…. he was a bad man; he did a lot of bad things. I was going to explain when you were older, I didn’t mean for you to hear it like that.”
“Honestly, I don’t know.” Tony replied. “Scientifically speaking it’s because our bodies stop being able to repair our cells after several decades of life, that being a death of old age. Other’s it’s because of severe injury or illness which the body can’t recover from. As for why this happens, I don’t know, no one does. It’s just the way things are.”
When my car is found there is going to be a media shit storm over our whereabouts and I can’t afford to let the world no that I’m alright and Steve’s alright because that will give away our location to Hydra. However, I don’t want Zach and Peter worrying, or Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and Bruce for that matter, so I need you to let them know that we are alright and to hold the fort for us.”
Steve nodded in agreement. No one was going to stand in his way, no one was going to stop him from getting to Tony and their baby.
“Well, I’ve still got to take you out on a date.”
“Go to hell!” Rogers spat. He rubbed his jaw again and headed for the exit, seething over Tony once again getting the last word.
Sadly for Tony before his heat came he had an engagement he had to go to, or rather all the Avengers had to go to.
“Wow Penis, do you always get girls to fight your battles?” Flash sneered at Peter, “Well I doubt fat ass there is any use, and your such a limp dick you can’t do shit yourself.”
It was huge, over course, it was more like a luxury apartment rather than a hotel room. With three bedrooms, a huge bathroom, and a lounge area with a fully stocked liquor bar, and a balcony complete with a table and chairs to lounge outside.
“For what?” Tony asked genuinely perplexed,
"His body has reacted badly to the bite, an alergic reaction." Bruce explained to Zach, "It's made him sick but the Doctor's are doing their best to help him body calm down so he can feel better."
“You can?”
“If I did Killian, what happens to your soldiers, to you, to your product?” She asked, backing away but keeping the hypo against her throat, What happens when you burn too hot Killian?”
“No, you just upgrade appliances and give them questionable personalities,” Clint agreed, “How is Toby the toaster, Cathy the coffee maker, and Micky the Microwave?”
“True.” Tony said, “The serum made you super healthy, where my body has been through a shit load of abuse. It really might not be possible and….well as much as I love you Steve I don’t think I could face IVF, the treatments are really gruelling and not guaranteed.”
“Is that so?” Steve asked, lifting Zach up onto his shoulders, “And you gave your allowance to the shelter? That’s very generous of you.”
“He’s a cuddler.” Steve confessed in a whisper, “But don’t tell him I told you.”
The private quarters of the Avengers will not be entered unless permission to do so is granted.
“There is still no word of Tony Stark or Iron Man. CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts was lifted out of the mansion by one of Tony Stark’s suits just seconds before the mansion plunged into the ocean with the billionaire still inside.” A Reporter said into the camera. She was dishevelled, her suit stained, hair falling out of the French twist it had been in, make-up streaked down her face, and the hand she held her microphone in was trembling.
“Puurreow!” The culprit jumped up onto the sofa and was promptly pulled onto Zach’s lap and petted.
The press parted so Tony and Steve could head for the car, several more photos and news coverage was taken of them as was their getting into the car.
The nurse took Tony and Steve to a small family waiting room, offering them drinks of tea or coffee and getting them to sit down in the chairs provided. "Peter has been admitted to the Intensive Care ward where he is undergoing treatment for what appears to be a severe case of toxic shock." She explained to them, "We have been given information on the type of spider that bit him and thankfully it is not a venomous breed, however Peter's body has reacted violently to the bite. His body temperature has climbed dangerously high, and his airways became compromised. He has been intubated and put on a ventilator, we are also trying to bring his temperature down and are giving him drugs to combat the shock."
“I apologise Sir, but Master Peter called. He needs to come home rather urgently.”
Natasha grimaced “Sadly I could not forget it.” She said.
“Stay back!” The man said, “Stay back or I will kill the little freak.”
“You suck!” Zach shot back and threw a fry back at him.
“Me?” Natasha squeaked completely taken aback by Tony having arranged an escape strategy for her.
“And if you wanted a business meeting why didn’t you arrange an actual meeting with Stark. Go through the proper channels, then you’d have met him sober and coherent, not practically about to pass out and start drooling over himself!” Clint added.
He had begged ignorance about what had been found in the factory, had blamed Curien for everything. Well, what did that incompetent jackass expect? He was hardly going to take the fall himself, let the bastard swing for this.
There were also less than subtly questions regarding Rhodey’s return to duty, he may be on compassionate leave but said leave was not indefinite.
“Why?” Steve asked with a frown.
By the time Sam arrived back at the house, panting, sweating, and clutching not only a bag of bagels plus toppings, he also had a couple of burner phones with him which he set on the table before going to shower.
“Why can’t the Fuckwit Four ever be present with Victor Von Dumbfuck decides to attack New York?” Tony countered, blowing another bot out of the sky and zooming towards three more that were trying to get the jump on Natasha. As they exploded behind her she turned and inclined her head in acknowledgment.
“You can’t honestly be saying that this is Tony Stark’s own fault.” The interviewer said incredulously while the studio audience booed and jeered.
*****
Curien wet his dry lips, “I understand he whispered hoarsely, and just about collapsed on the pillows when Tony let him go.
“On my count, one, two, lift.” The stretcher rose and with Thor leading the way and Bruce keeping his hands firmly pressed on the bleeding wound they made their way to the exit and down the ramp.
“Oh my brown baby, he is growing up so fast!” Deadpool cooed, “You’re a parent, right?” he said, whipping around and pointing at Steve, “Don’t they grow up fast? I mean one minute you are teaching them the intricacies of kidnapping their cousins, while they are driving you to hits, and next they are running over perverts with their taxi after they have helped you save a really hot handed teen with a drop of diabetes from a future guy with racism and a robot arm, who actually turns out to be useful in saving your future Baby Momma from being shot in the heart was an asshat who you can then kill with a cheese spreader!”
“Yes Sir.” Ned whispered shamefaced and biting his bottom lip. MJ was much the same, her shoulder’s hunched and head hung low.
The name meant nothing to Steve, but he couldn’t afford to turn away potential information right now.
Clint and Natasha followed their fellow Avengers and Colonel Rhodes to camp Leheigh, keeping a discreet distance so they were not discovered and watched as Tony and Steve went into the defunct base.
“I know sweetheart, just lay still and try to rest, you’ll feel better soon.”
Wisely or maybe foolishly he decided to leave the Maximoff’s behind, sending Pietro out into the field to fight and leaving Wanda to guard the base, he had left her with the means of contacting him (If she survived) if she did then she would be worthy of joining him in his new base, if she didn’t then…well he would cut his losses.
Tony let out a bark of mirthless laughter, “That is the stupidest and most ignorant thing I have ever heard you say. Hydra is the only threat? What about AIM, or IS, or Al Qaeda? They are just as big a threat as Hydra ever was.”
Finally Zach, his precious baby boy, burned and charred, struggling to draw in air through his blackened and blood spattered lips as Tony fell to his knees and reached for him.
Peter mumbled and yawned, “Thirsty.” He said.
This press conference was going to be hardest in her career because it wasn’t about Stark Industries or the latest product, it wasn’t about the Avengers, well, partly it was, but mostly it was about the Stark Family, something she didn’t want to be talking about in front of the worlds media, especially not under such circumstances, but this had to be done.
“I wouldn’t dream of it, Mr Stark,” Steve promised, pulling Tony close to him, “Just relax, you’re safe with me,” he whispered into the billionaires ear, making Tony shiver in delight.
“Jarvis,” He murmured wanting to be wrong, wanting the receptionist to be wrong, “Is Tony on fertility treatment?”
Chuckling Rhodey set Zach down and he and Peter headed for their respective bedrooms squabbling as they went.
“We were attacked.” Steve said wetting a cotton wool ball with disinfectant, he bent to start cleaning the cuts on Tony’s side, but the Omega pulled away.
At the studio Steve was introduced to the host and was given another once over by another stylist who added just a touch of highlight to his forehead before declaring him complete, he was then sat in a comfortable office chair sitting at an angle to the hosts chair with a decorative coffee table between them and the cameras pointed at the both. The Host explained that they would begin with some talk about Steve himself, how he had felt waking up in the twenty-first century, how he’d adjusted, found his new purpose and family, which would then lead into the issues that said family were going through right now.
“You and me both.” Rhodey agreed. “Other than that, I think you’ll have to find your own way, I can’t really advise you any further.”
Groaning he struggled out of bed and had just gotten to his feet when Steve came back into the bedroom wearing a pair of too short jogging bottoms, drying his damp hair on a towel, an army surplus T-Shirt tossed over his bare shoulder.
“Umm, I should point out that the deaths aren’t their fault, that’s on Osborn and whoever he had running that freaking place.” Clint pointed out, not wanting the kids to think themselves murderers. “Investigators have got to go over the facility but from what I saw, considering the epicentre of the blast and the way it blew, it was a self destruct that was set off, not an accident.”
Stretching, he got off the bed, and someone groaned from beside him. Steve paused and saw a sleepy and rumpled Tony Stark coming too from where he’d fallen asleep on the bed besides Steve the night before.
His Mamma was talking to his new Daddy, he sounded upset, his voice was low and sad sounding.
It took a full six weeks for Peter had enough control over his senses to be able to return to school.
“What happens now?” He asked Obie as he sat on the bed his knees to his chest feeling used and raw.
“I am certain Dumm-E would oblige me if such a thing came to pass.”
Nassau University Medical Centre.
“Your sure you don’t mind?” Tony asked really not wanting to get out of bed yet, Steve leaned over and kissed him, “This is your holiday too, have a lay in.”
“You mean you won’t be dancing to the Star Spangled Man for my personal entertainment?” Tony placed a hand over his heart as if he were hurt making Steve snort with laughter.
“It probably works through a kind of telepathy.” Bruce hypothesised, “Beings like Loki who are capable of magic, may be able to communicate with it in some way, although I’m not sure to what extent nor to what extent this object could actually be controlled by anyone.”
“Are you kidding, I wouldn’t miss my Nephew’s birthday party for the world.” Pepper exclaimed, “What have you got him?”
“What will this mean for the Avengers, for Iron Man?”
The images of the twins came up on the holographic display listing their date of birth, estimated height, weight, and their enhancements.
“We should be able to walk right around the mountains and come down the other side of the woods, then we can circle back to camp in time for dinner.” Steve said checking the map, the mountain fed into each-other with only shallow dips between their peaks so once they reached the first summit they would be walking a fairly even trail.
Gritting his teeth and clenching his fists, Rogers forced himself to keep his temper, he didn’t want to be pictured fighting with his alternate self, even if the insufferable bastard deserved a damn good kicking, as did Stark for that matter.
“Yep, nothin’ special here, just bog standard cock and balls, ohh and speaking of balls, your buddy with the metal masturbating hand has a huge fucking pair. I swear I would love to suck on those sugar plums!”
“We understand M.S Potts, thank you for being so understanding given the circumstances.” Mr Leeds said.
Tony gave Natasha and Clint a floor to share and Sam moved into the guest room on Steve’s floor. Tony said that he’d get them individual floors given time, but no one was upset about the arrangement, especially since the floors, while being shared, were three times the size of a normal apartment and far more luxurious than any of them could afford.
Tony couldn’t speak, all he could do was gape at Steve as he chuckled fondly and stroked his thumb over Tony’s cheek.
“Okay then.” Steve pulled out into traffic and had to break hard as he was cut up by a sports car. Norman Osborn’s angry face glared at him from the drivers seat and Harry was scowling in the passenger seat.
“NO!” Steve lunged forward managing to grab hold of Tony by the shoulders as his body began to fall. The momentum brought Steve down onto the ground, landing on his front hard.
Peter wasn’t used to seeing his aunt Pepper anything less than immaculate, seeing her now shaking, with mascara streaks down her cheeks and dark smudges under eyes was frightening.
Tony looked tiny and swamped by the hospital equipment that was covering his body, a rigid body brace was strapped to him from his shoulders down to his pelvis keeping his spine completely still, allowing the undamaged bones to heal and prevent further damage being done.
Decision made, Steve swept Tony up bridal style and grinned at the indignant noise Tony made at being carried in such a way, striding out of the office and telling the startled Secretary that Tony wasn’t feeling well and was going to bed.
“No!” Tony said immediately, startling himself, Jarvis, and the Nurse as she pulled down the bed sheets. “I’m fine.” He added in a softer tone, “Its nothing, I’m sorry.”
“Thor, Thor, Uncle Thor!”
“Perish the thought Sir.”
“Hey, Captain Cute-butt, lemme in, the winds getting nippy around the nether regions if you know what I mean!”
Tony made a face, he didn’t have a high opinion of Shrinks and certainly didn’t want to take his Son to one of them.
“What are you doing here, where’s your Daddy?” Tony asked, handing the tablet to Jarvis so Zach could climb onto the bed and lay down besides him.
The boy was sat up on the hospital bed looking lose and alone. As a parent it broke Tony’s heart and the guilt was like acid in his gut.
Tony shook his head, it was a lie, he did feel sick, sick with himself, he was disgusted with himself.
“How about you finish those pancakes and get ready for school.” Steve said patting his shoulder.
“Isn’t it?” Tony asked, “First I encourage Peter to lift cars and motorbikes, then I ground him for taking a risk with his own safety, pot calling the fucking kettle much? And lets not forget my calling out Aldrich Killian.”
“That is enough!” The Consultant snapped, rising from his seat and leaving the bedside to speak with the cop, Curien tuned the conversation out, because he knew it was true, he would be lucky to live long enough to get tried, and not only because of the hatred felt by the general public, but also because Osborn was not likely to leave him alive once he learned that he’d survived the bullet and the car hitting him.
Natasha was still unmoved, “I didn’t touch him.” She said.
“You dare upload this to social media and I swear I’ll fill all of your arrows with pink glitter.” Tony warned him, trying to move, but the sand was keeping him too well pinned down.
“Okay Daddy, Love you!” Happily Zach bounded across the bed to help Tony put his clothes away when Steve put him down, unaware of the jolt his words sent through Steve. It still made Steve catch his breath every time Zach said that he loved him, reminding Steve of how lucky he was and how very rich and full his life had become.
“Do it.” Steve said, “Have Thor help too, the more we know about the Sceptre and the Maximoff’s powers the better.” Steve made to go into the hospital room then paused and turned back to Jarvis, “Thank you.” He said offering his hand, the Android paused, the face plate almost looking surprised or bemused, however Jarvis took Steve’s hand and shook it.
He thought the caption (Cap got your tongue?) would do quite nicely, even if both Pepper and Rhodey would kill him for it.
After they’d finished they talked for a little longer before Natasha and Clint decided to head back to Shield for debrief, promising to update the others as soon as they could, Zach was falling asleep on Tony’s chest so they Billionaire went to put him to bed, asking Happy to show Steve, Thor, and Bruce to various guest rooms, apologising for the mess as he and the boys had been in the middle of moving into the tower, something that would have to wait until it was repaired.
“Get off!”
“The Widow, The Witch. I saw them. I don’t want them near me, don’t want the Witch in my head, I won’t go back to being like before, Winter don’t wanna neither.”
With Norman on his heels, Curien didn’t dare to stop, he staggered out into the street uncaring of the cars coming towards him, bracing himself he let out a hoarse cry as a car slammed into him, his legs breaking on impact and his skull thumping against the bonnet as the car screeched to a stop, then, with his vision fading he slithered down onto the road letting darkness take him.
Tony sighed heavily and rubbed the back of his neck this was all he needed after the day he’d had.
He’d had nightmares after Afghanistan, nightmares where he’d be back in the cave, being tortured by the Ten Rings, with Raza looking on, sadistically amused as his men brutalized Tony.
“My God you are actually rationalizing this and I think I am developing Stockholm syndrome as this is actually making sense to me. So, I am going to go to my lab and hang myself!” Tony said.
“Smooching are we?” Tony mock growled at his Son, “And you are a little sneak, and do you know what happens to sneaks?” He asked advancing on his Son, “They get tickled!” Shrieking Zach tore off with Tony running after him, leaving Steve laughing and finishing the last few bits of unpacking before he went to join his family.
Tony wanted to keep his eyes shut, to spit out whatever was in his throat, to curl up and go back to sleep, to escape these dreams and everything, but someone was touching him, urging him to wake up.
Any recordings of Zachary Stark and Peter Parker will be pixilated to protect their privacy.
“Bucky, stop,” Rogers garbled, wavering on his knees, “I’m your friend!”
Steve bit his lip and Tony sighed heavily, “It’s to be expected of course. He was bound to get curious sooner or later.” He tapped his fingers on the countertop, “I was hoping it would be later, a lot later. So I might have had a chance to figure out what the hell I’m going to tell him.”
“No.”
“No silly!” Tony laughed, “You’re getting floor’s each!”
“Then I guess these guys are Orcs!” Ant Man panted, growing to ten foot tall and crushing several chitauri, as Hulk smashed a dozen more.
Vision, having spent days locked up with Reed in the lab, went and gave his last stand against Thanos, getting ripped apart by the mad Titan as he tried to defend one of the few remaining emergency shelters. His sacrifice was noble, but it afforded nothing, the shelter was slaughtered along with the Android.
“Yup, let wagons roll.” Tony said pushing himself towards the door,
“58th,” Tony repeated, the name ringing a bell, “Oh shit, the Exo program, the falcon wings. Damn, that was a badass project.”
“Yeah yeah, party pooper Potts.” Tony said dismissively, “You handle the boring legal shit and let me and the fun people celebrate our collective and by our I mean my brilliance.”
“I never knew my Mother or Father.” Peter replied, “They died when I was just a baby, I don’t remember them. But my Aunt May and Uncle Ben told me about them and they sounded like nice people.”
“Rhodey’s managed to get us cleared to fly to New York.” Natasha said, “I assume that’s where you want to go?”
“The similarities were found are like that of the super soldier serum.” The Doctor said, “It is not identical but very similar, it seems to effect your immune system and strengthen your healing, but does not give you greater strength as it has the Captain, maybe because it isn’t identical to the super soldier serum.”
“Come on, lets get back.” Tony said pulling away from Steve,
“We’re not getting anymore weight on this bar and I’m no where near my limit yet.” Peter said setting the bar down and pursed his lips thoughtfully, “Lets got to Mamma’s garage.”
Snorting Steve pulled away from Tony but took hold of his hand and tugged him back to Peter’s room.
“Just give him a few minutes Zach.” Bruce said, he smiled gently at the ashen faced Peter, “He’ll be alright.”
Over head Thor swopped through and decimated another tower sending the occupants toppling down onto the ground where they had to run or risk having Natasha run them over.
Tony shook his head, “They can come here. It just might take a while.”
The two of them were, as Natasha put it “Tooth rottingly cute together.”
Yeah, a chance. A mind rapist, a Hydra volunteer. Steve had let a wolf into his home and didn’t realize that sooner or later it would turn around and rip his throat out.
*****
“What is he doing?” Sam asked hearing yelling from above.
“Not without breakfast you’re not,” he ordered, balancing Lily in one arm and pushing Tony down into a seat with his free hand, “I’ll bet you haven’t eaten in far too long,”
No, the funniest part was that Stark was unaware that Steve was doing it, and that he was reciprocating. His body leaning towards Steve, seeking him out, wanting to bath in his scent if he couldn’t be in contact with him. He wasn’t completely baring his neck, but there was a drop in his shoulders and a slight incline of his head when he looked at Steve, suggestive of what his inner Omega desired.
“Sir, you must stop right there.” One of the guards said, his voice shaking as much as the hands which were around his gun.
“Mr Stark we need to take Peter now.” One of the social services said,
“Three.”
“Thank God.” Steve breathed, while he didn’t like the thought of Peggy being in a home, he could understand why her family had put her in one, for her safety as well as for her health.
While Jarvis had kept silent about the 800lbs he did alert Tony to this, which was how Tony came to find his teenage Son holding his porches over his head.
As soon as Rhodey’s call came through the team sprang into action, which for Deadpool was literal as he leaped onto Vision’s back as the Android was taking flight and made a cowboy cry as if Vision was a horse!
“Tony…” Steve whispered having to force the name past the thick lump in his throat.
“Hmm, fun.” Tony murmured, “Friday, do we have the codes from the UN?”
As Tony’s friends and family rushed to Prague to be with him, Jarvis had another task. In case of emergency, Tony had given him very specific instructions to carry out, which the AI initiated once Tony had been taken into the air by the Avengers.
He tried to make himself as comfortable as possibly and closed his eyes, hoping he would slip back off to sleep again or at least a pleasant dose, only he heard something that had his senses on alert.
Zach recovered from his chicken pox after ten days of being miserable. After his initial tantrum he settled down and put up with having oat baths, even though he didn’t like it and vehemently refused to have anything to do with porridge, was swearing off oats for life it seemed.
“Uh…guys…”
“Go Green J, it’s the future.” Tony replied, “Some of the trees will have to be pulled up but that’s what I want to do, pull them up by the root and replant, not just cut them down. We are going to need space for classrooms and possibly dormitories for residential students.”
“About building a team,” Steve replied, taking a seat on the battered couch Tony had in his workshop. “On my earth, The Avengers often worked with The Defenders, The Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, The X-Men, to defeat large problems.”
“Mamma!”
“Get away from me Vision!” She screamed at him,
To round the day off Tony took them all out to an Italian restaurant where they had the best spaghetti and meatballs that Steve had ever tasted in his life.
“Great, then I should go and get ready,” Tony said, making to depart, but here Steve intervened,
Natasha shook her head, “I think further than that,”
The distraction of Peter greeting his Uncle Rhodey and Zach launching into a detailed story of how he had become Fire-Cracker and how he was going to be the leader of the Avengers served as a distraction which allowed Tony to properly greet Steve.
But it was there, right at the back of his mind, tormenting him, reminding him that Tony’s life might be slipping away as he sat there watching the clock hands move. Every time the doors opened and the doctors came through might be the time they came to say they were sorry and that there was nothing they could do.
Pepper had faced many press conferences and interviews since becoming CEO of Stark Industries, she’d also arranged many for Tony when she was his PA. She’d dealt with screaming reporters, snide journalists, flashing cameras, blinding lights, and difficult questions and she had done so without fear.
“And now we’ve had our eyes melted by the sight of neon pink Thor, back to you, Munchkin, what are you trying to bribe me for?” Tony asked Peter. The pre-teen rolled his eyes,
“And we got some awesome shots to show the team back at the tower.” Peter said as he scrolled through the photo’s they’d taken. He sighed and lowered the phone from his face, “Do you think Harry’s okay?” He asked.
“For Christ sakes Stark, are you drunk?” Tony was suddenly shoved away from Rogers. His legs having turned to jelly immediately buckled and he fell to the floor shaking like a leaf,
Zach awoke again just after they got back to camp and livened up enough to have a brief splash in the lake with Peter and have his dinner, but shortly after he was yawning so much that Tony put him to bed for an early night.
This doctor performed a vivisection on Peter while he was alive and conscious, he would have certainly killed him had Tony not arrived on the scene when he did. While Tony was getting Peter off the gurney he’d been strapped to, Dr Curien set off a self-destruct which resulted in the destruction of the factory, many deaths, and injuries.
“Steve is requesting entry to the lab,” Friday asked, and yet another thing. Steve asked to be let in the lab, where Rogers had always demanded, like he had a right to be there.
Ned made a choked noise and clamped a hand over his mouth looking like he was about hyperventilate.
“And proud of it.” Tony said giving Steve’s chest a pat, “Come on big guy, lets go and get some breakfast, you’re going to need all your strength.”
“I understand.” He said as he lifted his head, “I get it, I do. I just…I don’t want to lose you.”
At the time Steve had thought that was for the best, still not being entirely convinced that Tony wasn’t responsible for Ultron, but now, after Wanda’s revelation he knew better.
This got both Steve and Tony’s attention.
The guard looked dubious and took a deep breath before he nodded and opened the door allowing the two inside the building, “You stay in my office until I’ve spoken to Mr Stark.” He said to them, herding them through to his office where a dozen screens showed video surveillance of Stark Tower.
“I have alerted emergency services.” Jarvis said over the coms,
When Steve caught up with Tony, he was standing outside, by the car, a hand over his chest, and his body bent forward as he gasped for breath.
“Trust Tony to throw a temper tantrum,” Natasha sighed, getting to her feet, she looked Steve over shrewdly, taking his measure as her sharp eyes took in every details of his physical appearance, “You should think twice about staying with him.” She said, “He might be free with his money, but its only to try and make up for his faults, which are many, and could prove dangerous to you and your daughter.”
“Okay you can open them.” Tony said, standing back; he grinned as Zach let out a scream of delight.
Tony sniffed and nodded his head, “We will.” He said, “And both Zach and Peter are as much mine as they are yours, you are their Father in all but blood, and with how much I love Peter I know that blood doesn’t matter at all.”
“No. She’s senile. She doesn’t even remember who she is these days, let alone anything else.”
“Certainly Vision. Please take care of the Boss Man.”
A couple that did catch his attention were e-mails advertising various kindergartens in New York.
Steve nodded, appreciating that Sam had taken the time to let them know and not just leave them to wake up to an empty house.
The feeling Steve had gotten while sitting on the couch watching Dr Who with Tony’s children, and cooking breakfast for everyone in the kitchen, had been one of contentment. He’d actually felt happy and relaxed for the first time since he’d woken up.
“I just wish they’d leave you alone.” Steve said scowling at them through the tinted window of the limo as it started to pull away from the car park.
“Why?”
“Sixty floors, you climbed sixty floors dude!” Ned breathed sounding awed.
It was exactly what Steve had in mind for the weekend.
“Tony.”
Hydra had certainly done a number on the poor bastard that was for sure.
“A legacy.” Fury said following after him, “Something left over from your Father.”
“Birdy Man?” Sam snickered at Clint.
Steve’s eyebrows rose and he opened his mouth in bewilderment while Bruce snorted, “Do you have any dignity left to loose at this point?” he asked Tony, who shrugged.
“I did not.” Jarvis said, “I told him only that you had nothing to hide in this bathroom.”
*****
A rumbling came from over head and some of the weight shifted from Steve’s back easing the pressure somewhat and Jarvis’s voice crackled back to life.
Zach cuddled into Tony tighter, “I hate him. Hate he hurt you.”
Steve didn’t hesitate with his answer, “Germany.” He said recalling Dr Erskine’s words to him about the Nazi’s first invasion being their homeland.
He bent down and picked Zach up, holding him against his chest and began to rub the boys back, Zach wrapped his arms about Steve’s neck and buried his face into his chest sobbing.
His Mamma wasn’t crying now, so Zach got closer, stepping into the kitchen doorway and listened to what his Mamma was saying.
The tight grip Tony had on Steve’s shoulder should have been painful but Steve barely felt it at all, he was too focused on Tony and the feel of him against him and memorizing the sight of his dilating dark eyes and shape of his mouth as he cried out in passion.
Tony looked to Steve helplessly. The Super soldier looked troubled himself and uncertain of what to say. Neither of them could say that Peter was wrong for defending his friends, they would both do the same to defend theirs, but, Harry was now in hospital, this sort of incident couldn’t happen again.
Miami.
Wanda sneered at him, not bothering to deny it. “He murdered my family, he deserves to suffer, to feel nothing but pain and misery until it finally destroys him.”
“What are they doing?” Clint asked, “Why come out to this dump?”
“Override code accepted.”
Steve frowned at the choice of words, “You… do you see this as a one night thing?” He asked slowly, “Or as something lasting.” Tony opened his mouth to speak but Steve cut him off, “Because I want more with you than one night of fun. I don’t think less of people who have one night stands but I do not have them myself. I prefer something that lasts.”
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God!
“Which would you like it to be?” Steve purred, he honest to God purred! The rumbling roll of his words sending shudders down Tony’s spine and of his blood heading south of the border too.
“So, what’s it like, really, being enhanced?” Ned asked around a mouthful of pizza.
“Friday, I am the female sibling of Jarvis, made to replace Jarvis in the event of Sir’s death or incapacity, during which time Jarvis will have other duties to attend.”
“All we have to do is get Thanos where we want him.” Vision said, “Which, considering I carry the Mind Stone, should be easy, as he will come to us to claim his prize.”
“We’ll do the talking part later.” Tony said, moving to straddle Steve, “Make up sex now, followed by celebrating making up Sex, then post-celebrating making up sex, and finally practice Sex.”
“Uh no.” Tony said, “Morgan Rogers is the name of a Geography teacher, Morgan Stark is the name of a Superhero, and you are already a superhero, aren’t you Poppet?” Tony kissed her head tenderly and Morgan huffed a contented breath.
Sam’s smile fell and a look of disbelief widened his eyes, “Twelve to thirteen miles in thirty minutes?”
“You know, I think I grieved more for Ana, and the human Jarvis, than I did for my parents.” Tony admitted to the AI. “I couldn’t have cared less about Howard. That bastard deserved all he got. But my Mother, I should have cared more about her, I should still care more about her than I do.”
“It wasn’t her fault…,” Tony began to protest but Steve quietened him.
“Murderer.” Another voice said, this one female, accented, and seemed to float around in Tony’s mind.
Steve was the first to wake, the following morning.
Normally if such a thing happened Peter would have rushed to MJ and hustled her away to make sure she was alright. But with his nerves wearing thin after having to keep extra control of his sense all day and Flash’s comments about Ned riling him up, along with the comments about himself, Peter just snapped and without even really consciously thinking about it he had leaped off the bench and tackled Harry to the ground.
Steve released him and stepped back looking bashful, “Sorry, I just didn’t know how best to thank you.”
“Super dumbass genius.” Peter said giving Tony a leer when he side eyed him. “And yeah I know I’m grounded, what else is new.”
Steve snorted and tried to hide his laughter while Tony huffed, “Just because I like scientific movies to have at least some facts to make them believable.”
“Feels pretty good.” Tony said linking his arms about Steve’s neck, he braced his forearms on Steve’s shoulders and lifted himself up and down eliciting a groan from Steve, “Sounds like its pretty good for you too.”
It seems that the spider bite enhanced Peter, has given him abilities. Peter’s strength has been greatly enhanced, no one is entirely sure just how strong he is, but a spider can lift 170x their own body weight and Peter’s enhancement are coming from a spider so Doctor Banner is using a Spider’s abilities to judges Peter’s enhancements.
“You didn’t have to do all this.” Harley’s Mother, Grace Keener said, she was still reeling over Tony having bought the bank and written off her mortgage, a sum of money she could hardly fathom him gifting her and her family no top of all of the toys for the children.
“Isn’t this the coolest thing you’ve ever seen?” Peter cried with an ecstatic grin on his face.
Months later, Steve and Tony sat on the deck watching with fond smiles, as Lily, held Morgan’s hands as she carefully toddled on the grass to their play tent, where Lily had an Iron Man mask and a Captain America Shield.
He didn’t realize what he was doing until he was round the other side of the counter and kissing Tony. He heard the Billionaire give a whimper of surprise but he didn’t fight against the kiss, just froze for a moment before leaning into it, leaning into Steve running his hands up his torso.
A parent.
“Are you sure about this?” Bruce asked the Doctor, “It couldn’t have been a natural occurring mutation?”
Pepper figured out that Tony was insecure because she had freaky weird sixth sense and might actually be some kind of Jedi Goddess. Tony wasn’t sure, but he wouldn’t be surprised if that turned out to be a thing.
“A red haired female was seen fleeing the scene, as were other potential suspects.”
Steve chuckled watching Harley struggling to keep up with the bombardment of friend requests on social media and stunned looks every time one of the kids called out his name or shouted out to meet them at lunch.
Peter worried at his bottom lip with his teeth and broke the cookie again, crumbling it on the table, “Is he okay?” He asked, “He’s not hurt?”
“No details.” He repeated and looked up at Steve, “What the hell am I supposed to say to him? That his Father was a murderous bastard, that he tried to kill me three times and would have succeeded if I hadn’t killed him first?”
“Happy, take us to the tower.” Peter said.
Peter stared at Harry wondering at first if this was a very bad joke, because really, how could his being bitten by a radioactive spider his fault? But as the second past he realized that Harry wasn’t joking quite the opposite, he was deadly serious in blaming Peter for Norman’s recent difficulties.
Steve shrugged bashfully, “I wanted you to have something unique.” He replied, “Something special.”
“Are you sure?”
It wasn’t fair. Stane was long dead, he shouldn’t still be able to have power over Tony or Zach; yet his spirit seemed to have a long reach and could still hurt them even from beyond the grave.
“What are you doing here?” he asked, frowning as Clint laughed at the infant’s antics, how she reached for her feet, seemingly fascinated by them.
“Kay.” Peter yawned, padding over to the fridge and getting out the jug.
“Steve, what are we going to do?” Tony asked, “We’ve got nothing for him.”
******
The Tony image changed and the Skrull reappeared and snarled at them, “I will reveal nothing!”
“No, master Zach, and you cannot have pancakes again.” The AI replied making Steve jump.
“We have.” Steve said, his cheeks a little flushed, “What does that have to do with anything?” His attention turned back to Tony who groaned in pain, clutching at him tightly.
Miami.
“Rogers said something, he called me a name.” The asset said, “Bucky. Why would he call me that?”
*****
“Stark is evil!” Wanda raged, “He deserves to die!”
Rhodey positioned his chair in front of the door, keeping out of the way but intending to be part of this never the less.
“Intensive care.” Steve whispered, “We can’t go back in until later today, there is an infection risk.”
Giggling, Morgan let go of the couch and took a step away from it, then another and another, she giggled louder as Tony encouraged her on until she reached him and he swept her up into his arms. “Whose Mamma’s clever girl, whose Mamma’s big girl?”
Zach wasn’t having any of it though, he screwed his face up and screamed louder, “Mamma won’t help you, he’ll turn into Iron Man and he’ll kick your bitch ass!”
“The cops can’t protect you from Ross.” Tony said, “Not even witness protection will keep you safe from him.”
“Knows nothing.” Rumlow said, “Neither does Hill. They are all still in the dark except for Rogers and Stark,” he grinned and cracked his knuckles, “I’ll take care of them personally.”
“I swear you do this on purpose!” He growled, taking off his jacket and folding it over his arm so it would drape over his erection that was trying to rip its way out of his pants, grinning unrepentantly Tony leaned forward to whisper into Steve’s ear,
Ever patient Steve waited until Tony was ready before he began to move, rocking in and out of his body, his cock pummelling Tony’s prostate and having him hard again within moments.
“Having a pee.” Peter said, “I made sure he stayed away from the poison ivy and the stinging nettles.”
“So, what has you up and about?” Tony asked getting a double chocolate cookie which he dunked into the tea smirking as Steve’s nose wrinkled at the sight of it, “Adds a minty taste.” He said, “Its good.”
“You’re ground.” Tony told him letting out an exaggerated oof as Zach launched himself into his lap and hugged him hard,
“He’s flirting again, Cap, can’t you do something about it?” He asked Steve.
With his nose wrinkling at the sight of the same sex couples on the dance floor, Rogers searched the crowd until he came across Tony, in the arms of Steve, being twirled around the dance floor like some dance hall doxie!
Tony shrugged, “Either, I’m not bothered.”
While they hoped that they would bait Thanos with the Mind Stone enough to get him to the compound there was no guarantee of that and they wanted to keep civilian casualties to a minimum, so when Thanos attacked an immediate evacuation order would be put into place, with everyone being urged to go to the shelters, which had been built with vibranium from Wakanda who had joined the global effort in defended the planet.
Mood swings.
Happy had gotten Zach a couple of toy daleks that light up and said “Exterminate”
“I can try and then leave if it doesn’t work out, right?” Peter asked.
“Copy that.” Steve said, with trembling hands he took one end of the stretcher while Thor took the other and with the greatest of care they carried Tony back up through the castle and out to the jet.
“Let’s not go out to a restaurant tonight, let’s just order room service and watch some crappy movie on pay per view, okay?” Tony asked as they headed for the car,
As he finally got free Tony became aware of just how much sand he now had in places he really did not want sand to be and made a hasty retreat to the shower to get washed up. (Stopping in the villa kitchen for a coffee first of course.)
The Billionaire look exhausted and pale, he had an oxygen canula in his nose and bandages about his head that were tinged slightly red where the laceration on his scalp was.
Slowing, Steve waited for Tony to catch up with him, “C’mon you’ve got to run faster.” He urged the Omega, but Tony shook his head and Steve heard the tell tale rattle as Tony struggled to breathe, his respirations coming harder and faster in desperation to draw in air and he recalled Tony telling him that his lung capacity was reduced.
“Hey Stark, we’re heading to the airport. See you in Miami.” Natasha called to him.
“Really?” Steve asked surprised.
Bruce nodded and Natasha gave small incline of her head, one of the decorate curls from her bouffant bouncing over her ear.
“You are correct about that, Mr Stark.” It said, addressing Tony whom it seemed to observe, the ancient cameras moving to look him over, “Anthony Edward Stark born 1974, Steven Grant Rogers. Born 1918.”
“You killed your mate, Stark?” Thor asked looking shocked, “Such a crime carries a heavy penalty on Asgard, one must honour their mate, not seek to destroy them.” Rhodey moved forward, placing himself between Thor and Tony.
“But Dad.” Harry whined, “I don’t want Parker back at school.”
“Oh.” Zach looked rather disappointed at that, “Does that mean I can’t call Steef Daddy?”
“Open the door then.” Another voice said.
Plums. James liked plums. Winter liked them too. Juicy, sweet, and crisp. They were the best fruit ever and they both liked indulging in them whenever they had the chance.
Steve opened his mouth to protest but once again Deadpool cut him off before he could say anything, “You can’t hate him!” He cried, with an exaggerated gasp, “He’s Captain Amazing pecs! He’s Cock King of America! He has an ass that everyone, but you and me, is jealous of, but only because we both have amazing asses ourselves, and have I mentioned how much I want to bite those ripe peach-like cheeks?”
“Trying to keep me in shape, Cap?” Tony teased, his own cheeks a little red from Steve’s suggestive comment.
Norman bristled at the cheek of that, but it did mean that the man would be calling again and when he did Norman could arrange to meet him and deal with that problem once and for all.
“Me? Oh yeah I’m great.” Steve said and winced at how false that sounded, he wasn’t even surprised when Peter gave him a suspicious look.
"Why, what's wrong with him?" Zach demanded, "Is it Chicken Pox?" he could remember his own ordeal with the nasty itchy blisters that had resulted in him sitting in a gross slimy oat bath. He wouldn't blame Peter for not wanting anyone around him if he was like that. But Peter said you could only get it once and that he'd had it, so it couldn't be that. "Did his Apex burst?" he asked remembering hearing about the strange organ that was in people's tummies that was never used but sometimes burst.
Tony often likened him to an octopus having an epileptic fit when he slept, but really, that was unfair since Tony was a shameless space hog and would sprawl over the whole regardless of anyone he might be sharing with, limbs spread wide and taking up far more space than someone as small as him should be able to.
At first he had thought it was just because he was latching onto him as a subconscious replacement for his lost husband. But as time had gone on, he had realized that this was not the case. There enough differences between this and his Tony, that he knew he was falling for this man as he had for his own Tony.
Tony folded his arms over his chest and studied the boy, “What’s his name?”
“Let’s get everything packed away and then have some dinner.” Steve said feeling his stomach rumble with hunger.
“Better think up a plan then.” Clint said, “Or are we going to use my favourite method and just shoot everything we see?”
“We’ll be alright, thank you.” Steve said, “Although if you have something we can make a splint with for Tony’s wrist?”
Fortunately Thor proved to be on their side and after a brief skirmish that flattered half a forest they were able to be on their way once again, arrived back a Shield where Loki was put in containment while the rest of them sat around a conference table discussing the situation which led to Stark and Banner going off to the labs to try and find the tesseract.
Steve nodded, “She still shouldn’t be taking it out on you.”
“Zach’s not gone Steve, Thor is just taking him out to calm him down, he’ll be back soon.” Bruce said.
So, Howard deemed this procedure necessary even if his wife did not.
“How are these damn things so fucking difficult?” Sam cursed as he and Steve struggled to get the tents put up.
Fury shook his head, “The situation changed too fast. I’ve had this plan ready to go for years in case I needed to lay low, I just wasn’t expecting to be taking bullets last night.”
“Get out of the way, Wilson.” Tony barked, blasting off into the air again, he dodged a wave of Wanda’s magic, and fired at the ground near where she was crouched, showering her in earth but not actually hurting her.
Shaking his head he firmly pushed that thought away and took off his t-shirt, leaving on his vest and crawled back out of the tent.
That was how Steve felt as he carried what seemed like the umpteenth take away to Peter’s hospital room.
Loud. It was so loud. Peter felt like he had mega phones in his eardrums he could hear so much noise from everywhere.
“You don’t know that…” Matt began, but was cut off, by Tony jumping up from the couch and shouting,
“Do you know the name of the assailant?”
“Worth it for make up sex.”
“Must you poke fun at the murderous Alien, Stark?” Strange asked, looking exasperated,
“I won’t.” Steve said staring at the bloody, pale face, “Come on Tony, be alright.” He said reaching out and taking a gauntlet covered hand, “Fight for me shellhead, don’t leave me.”
Tony purchased the biggest fattest turkey that Steve had ever seen, Clint joked that it was actually an ostrich since a Turkey could not possibly be so huge, not even if it was given hulk enhanced steroids.
“What?” Steve asked taking his hand away from Tony’s mouth and tried not to notice how red and kissable his lips look, all swollen and damp from kissing.
Curien was still being granted his immunity and witness protection in return for his testimony against Norman. If and when the asshole was located he would still give testimony against him in court.
“Yeah yeah, we’ll see.” Tony scoffed, very much doubting that Steve would be able to catch anything without actual equipment.
“Okay I’m feeling some strain here but I think I could still lift more.” Peter said carefully lowering the car back down.
Peter’s shoulders slumped and he nodded his head, waiting silently as Tony finished speaking with the principal and signed Peter out of the school. He then followed after his parents out to the car and silently got in, wishing he could turn back time and take Ned up on the idea of running to the cafeteria instead of staying and getting into a fight with Harry.
“It was a bomb with the name Stark printed on the side. But it was not mine.” Tony said, a small smug smile on his face, “I thought that it was one of the defective bombs that Stane sold under the table, or one stolen from the US military, which has happened in the past. So I chased up the leads and tracked down the serial numbers of the bombs used in Sokovia during their civil war, and guess what? The bomb was never mine to begin with. It was old, very old in fact, circa 1970 and issued to Vietnam during the war.”
“And my answer is already no.” Tony said taking a sip of his coffee, “You have a guilty face, so you are clearly guilty of something, therefore you will not be getting anything.”
Unable to think of anything else he could do Peter filled his lungs with as much air as he could and started to yell for help.
“Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. We all know this and Avengers know it too. Steve Rogers, Captain America is keen to make sure his team and family get a nutritious start to the day.”
The Billionaire had been inconsolable since he had learned of his Father’s experimentation. He wouldn’t have any of the Avengers near him, wouldn’t eat or drink, and screamed bloody murder if the Doctors tried to touch him.
Natasha still had her hands pressed firmly down on Clint’s side slowing the bleeding from where he’d been shot. The archer was pale and there was a layer of cold sweat on his skin but he was conscious and could move under his own steam.
“Coming.” With a backpack of his own Peter joined them following Steve and Zach out of the hotel door and headed to the lift to go down to the lobby and out of the hotel. Fortunately the hotel was only a short walk from the hospital and it gave them a chance to get some fresh air before they were cooped up inside all day.
“I don’t gotta home.” Bucky whispered hunching his shoulders and ducking his head as the first police cars screeched to a halt, by now a crowd had gathered to watch the interaction, forming a circle about them, blocking off an easy escape route for Bucky which was only serving to make him even more antsy.
“Oh my God, Tony, what happened?” Steve cried, seeing the blood and the pain Tony was in.
“I do not disagree, I read the journal, he refers to Tony as The Infant, rather than his Son or by name. He also continued to examine Tony after he recovered, testing him, his reflexes, tolerance for pain, endurance, healing. He goes into detail of how swiftly Tony healed from a broken arm when he was nine months old, I can only hazard a guess as to how the limb was broken.”
“Oh call me Tony,” The billionaire said with a wave of his hand, which he regretted as it pulled on his ribs, he heard a subtle cough from behind him and half turned, “Sergeant Wilson, meet my good friend, Steve Rogers.”
Clint Barton’s mind control during Loki’s attack on Earth.
“Bullshit!” Steve stated, making Tony jump a little at the volume of his voice, “From what you’ve said, Ultron was cause by a combination of things, not you alone. They have no right to treat you in such a way, none at all.”
Picking the tree up and replacing the decorations soon became a regular activity, as did removing a squirming and protesting kitten from within the branches.
Tony glanced to Sam, “Locate the Falcon wings from the EXO project and send me the address. Monitor Shield activity,” He paused and glanced at the time on the computer, “Has Natasha or Fury called?”
“Way to pop the caps cherry, Stark, you’ve made a big boy of him at last!” Clint teased.
Together the three of them ran towards the factory just as it exploded into a huge ball of fire.
The conference lasted over an hour before it was finally concluded and Pepper was able to retreat back into her office and breath a sigh of relief. This relief was short lived though, there was no telling how the general public would respond, and social services.
“I will carry Mr Stark.” Vision said, floating over to them. “FRIDAY?” he said, addressing the AI.
He’d been in the process of trying to cheer Wanda up. In the three months that had past since Ultron, the Sokovian girl had been struggling with her grief for the loss of her brother, something that all of the team were trying to help her with, well, the new team, Steve and Natasha, since the rest of the founding members were gone.
“No, but it is to control.” Steve said, setting the designs back onto Fury’s desk, “That was Hydra’s ultimate goal. Global control, and with project Insight at their disposal they would be able to achieve it.” He glanced at Tony who nodded slowly.
Steve choked and shook his head, “You are incorrigible.”
Tony groaned, trying to loosen Steve’s hold only to find himself flat on his back with Steve on top of him, a hard cock that was not his own pressing against his thigh!
“You’ll look like a blueberry pancake if you keep on eating them.” Tony teased, rubbing his face and smiling at his giggling and far to awake Son. “You’re gonna start turning blue and swelling up into a big berry. I can see it happening, you’ve got blue spots on your nose already.”
Will that ever be enough though? Bucky quietly thought.
Bruce groaned wishing Zach wasn’t so bright, or so hard to refused, the damn kid was so adorable that even the Pope couldn’t have refused him if he’d asked for something.
“Sure, he is an Avenger, practically the founding member of the Avengers.” Sam said, “Everybody thinks of Stark when the team is mentioned, he is always the first avenger that anyone thinks of.”
He didn’t like this alternate version of himself, this false Captain America, who acted as if he were better than Rogers. When he was nothing but a queer!
“Ha! I heard it from Pepper that it took you three hours and ten attempts to make her one omelette!”
“So I’m like a spider now?” Peter asked. His eyes widened in alarm, “I won’t start growing extra legs will I?”
“We need to find cover.” Steve shouted to Natasha, his pace increased, not to his maximum but enough to match Natasha’s. He flinched as did Natasha and Tony as guns were fired, the bullets not finding their targets but making very aware of how precarious their situation was.
“They won’t come out until dark.” Tony said, “They hunt at dusk and sleep during the day.”
“Well the water here is very deep so you must stay with myself, your Daddy, Uncle Sam, Uncle Clint, and Aunt Natasha at all times.” Thor said seriously, “As must you, Peter.”
“Shit!” Lily agreed making the adults about her, except Deadpool groan.
“No.” Peter shook his head, “He…he and Flash came over while me, MJ, and Ned were having lunch. They started bit… slanging us off about what happened at Oscorp and the lawsuit against Norman.” Peter avoided Tony’s eyes when he said this not wanting Tony to feel guilty for his lawsuit.
“Do you want to shoot him or shall I?”
“It’s not.” Clint insisted, “I shouldn’t have done that. It was reckless and stupid and you could have died.”
“Funny things are.”
“That isn’t happening.” He said taking Peter’s hands, “You aren’t going into any state home, or foster care or anything, you are coming home with me.”
He had been sneakily adding to Steve’s wardrobe over the past months, adding shirts, jeans, slacks, even a couple of suits, which fitted like a glove. Apparently Jarvis was capable of taking body measurements so Tony had been able to get the clothing tailored to fit.
Tony gave an almost hysterical sounding laugh, “Where the fuck do I even start?” He said, “With the psycho who turned himself into a fucking AI? My Parents assassination, Hydra being alive and kicking, and let’s not forget Cap’s bestie, being shoved in the freezer and used as a Murder doll.”
“He wasn’t in the suit at the time.” Pepper said as if reading Peter’s thoughts.
“Children, please?” Natasha sighed, “What proposition?” She asked Pepper.
With his own head pounding Steve brought his knee up and sunk it into Rogers stomach making him double over, he brought his elbow across the man’s back taking him to his knees, he gripped the back of Rogers uniform, preparing to knock him out only to be struck by Natasha’s widow bites which sent sprawling to the ground as electricity shocked him.
“Thank you agent Barton.” Jarvis replied, “I also have extraction plans in place for your family in case of an emergency, a pre-programmed Jet will collect them from your farm and fly them to Sirs safe house in Casablanca should the need ever arise, and the sum of three million dollars will be converted to local currency and made immediately available for your use.”
“I yelled at Captain America! I gave Captain America a dressing down in public! Everyone is going to hate me!”
Peter was practically sobbing when Tony and Steve finally arrived in the hospital room, the night staff arguing with them that they couldn’t just go and discharge Peter and couldn’t disturb him either.
“And if there is a strange noise in the bushes I am not investigating it!” Tony yelled after him,
“As are most things.” Curien murmured. Everything was about perception after all, some would say what he’d done was abhorrent and horrific, where others would see it as pioneering and futuristic. Honestly, how did people think that mankind was going to take the next step in evolution, by waiting around for another billion years and risk being killed off by another ELE? Hardly, not when they had the technology available to have the human race making those steps in the next ten years. Norman and those like him were only looking at creating soldiers to fight their wars and create a world that “They” wanted to rule over. Curien was looking further than that, he was looking at unlocking all the secrets in the human genetic code, in having humans able to use more than the standard five to ten percent of their brains capacity, to wiping out all disease and deformity, to creating a perfect race.
Steve opened his mouth to protest but he didn’t get a chance to speak as Deadpool leapt up from the couch with a loud cry of delight, “Captain hotpants and Iron Buns, God you two look delicious, it makes me want to smear ice cream all over you and lick it off!”
******
Steve looked dubious, “If your Mother hears about this….”
The two stared at each other, looking away and looking back with nervous grins and began to make small talk to try and cover up their nervousness.
Tony made a disgusted noise and threw himself down onto the sofa, “I hate everyone.”
“Armin Zola.” He said glancing to Tony, “A Nazi scientist captured during the war, but he died years ago.”
Oh the irony, Tony would laugh if he wasn’t feeling so crappy.
“You don’t have to stay here.” He said to Steve as he got up onto the bed, Zach immediately snuggling against him. “You can go and enjoy the beach, have another swim, you don’t need to spoil your holiday for me.”
“What is it?” He asked, looking down at the empty space where Tony should have been laying,
Steve hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but the rhythmic sound of Tony’s breathing and the warmth of the bed had lulled him into sleep. He was jolted awake as Friday called out to him.
“Screw you Stark, my ass is the finest in this business.” Clint called back and Tony could picture him flipping him off.
His legs would get tangled, his feet getting in one leg instead one leg each. Annoying things, pants.
Too weak and in too much pain to get off the bed Tony was forced to nod, accepting that he would have to let Vision go and find his daughter.
Steve grinned, “Yeah but it’s the best kind of crazy.”
Zach can produced intense heat and fire from his hands, his immune system is much stronger than normal, to the point he will never get sick again, and his healing abilities are far greater so that he will likely heal from a bone fracture within a few hours.
“I hate you Mamma.” Zach said filling his palms with flames and threw them at Tony who’s body instantly ignited…..
Steve was trying to appear collected but even he was showing strain, it would be the first time the Avengers had attended a public setting like this, one that was going to covered by the media and would be scrutinized by everyone who saw the coverage, they were also going to be mingling with high society, something that only Tony had real experience with. Steve had some but that was seventy years ago, and Natasha had only ever been on the fringes when she was working as a honeytrap or a double agent trying to smoke out a villain.
“It didn’t go that way in your world?”
"It is?" Peter slurred, his tongue was starting to feel funny, like it was too big for his mouth, his head was light and everything seemed to spinning, noises and shapes getting blurred, and his skin was hot, it was too hot, everything was too hot and he couldn't breathe, he couldn't breathe.....
Norman met Tony’s gaze unflinching, one businessman to another, “Your Son’s education or your precious law suit.” He said, “If he is excluded then you will have difficulty getting him into any school, any decent one anyway, and I have plenty of influence with such schools, and colleges.”
“Whats going on?” he asked, trying to figure out of he was in trouble at all, not that he’d done anything so far as he could remember.
“No.” Tony looked down, tears running down his face, unable to bear the hatred of his children, their accusing glares, their anger at his failure. “I tried…” He whispered,
Okay, so maybe he could have been a little more friendly to Captain America, but Tony still had issues where Rogers was concerned, being compared to him by Howard and found wanting still stung. He also hadn’t been in close proximity to such a dominant Alpha in a long time. Not since Stane had died. Being around those pheromones unnerved him and put him on edge, making him more cutting in his remarks that he needed to be.
Violet softened as Tony charmed her and happily spoke of her Son’s fourth marriage to a woman thirty years younger than himself.
Peter chose an Iron Man theme, wanting the wall paper, bedspread, lamp shades, and curtains in Iron Man colours and images. He was also thrilled by the miniature Iron Man action figure that Tony made for him which had a very weak arc reactor powering it so it could fly about the rooms and had voice controls for Peter to tell it what to do.
Steve typed out a reply on the tablet, “I don’t know, science stuff, I’d need a PHD to understand it all!”
“Plus he was doing crazy shit there!” Ned piped up, his eyes widened when he realised that he’d sworn, “I mean stuff, I meant to say stuff!”
Tony couldn’t help but to lean into Steve’s touch, to feel the walls he’d had built up crumble when he was met with that honest gaze. “How can I not?” He whispered, “How can you even bear to touch me?”
Tony had a far more relaxed approach and had always made sure that the party was informal, so that none of his staff would feel under dressed or out of place.
“Hopefully he burn the energy off before we get home.” Tony said to Steve with a sigh, as Zach gobbled up the candy floss and looked like he was vibrating with the sugar high, bouncing along besides Peter as they headed to one of the stalls to try and win a toy.
Tony smiled as he saw Steve and rose to greet him, “Hey Cap, what brings you to my crib?” he asked, making his way around the desk and held out a hand for Steve to take. The Captain did so, taking care not to crush Tony’s fragile looking fingers as he held them in his larger hand,
Tony and Steve explained everything they’d found out about Hydra and Zola, what he’d told them about Tony’s parents and about Bucky, the also explained about the letter Steve had from his future self and how they’d been told to go to Camp Leheigh and had uncovered all of this.
“I think I can handle anything that might happen, but thank you, Colonel Rhodes.”
Wanda was partially tempted to go to Prague, to forget the idea of going to America and to just go to Prague and take her revenge on Stark.
"God...hmmmm, yes!" Tony groaned, "Only after long, unending hours of such torment shall we finally let down our defenses, lay down our arms, and surrender to our invading force."
“Absolutely.” Tony replied, “Rhodey, how long till the weapons in range?”
“Dumm-E stop tha…” Tony didn’t finished the sentence as Dumm-E obedient bot that he was not, turned as soon as Tony said his name, but did not stop fired the extinguisher and Tony, like Zach was soon covered in foam. “Wonderful.” Tony grumbled,
*****
*****
“Stane was the one double dealing.” Steve pointed out.
“Captain?”
*****
“Wan’ be ‘ith you.” Tony panted his pain filled eyes making contact with Steve, “S’ry.”
“Hell no.” Tony said shooting a glare at Clint, “See what you’ve started?”
“Fucking incompetent assholes.” He grumbled meaning the other medical staff he had to work with, “Should have changed the damn thing.”
“I do.” Tony said, “And if it works for me then it has the potential to work for many others too, and maybe one day I’ll be able to design something for quadriplegics too,” He wrinkled his nose, “That will take a lot of planning though, they’ll need support from the neck down and it’ll be difficult to design something strong enough to support them that won’t also restrict their breathing.”
“You are in  hospital Tony, not prison.”
“DAD!” he whined.
“Yes Sir.” Sharon headed off to get the supplies leaving the others to talk.
“I didn’t mean to.” Clint said, “I thought it would be funny, a joke. I didn’t know it would hurt him.”
He was my best friend since as long as I can remember, and when ever those bullies hurt me, he’d stand up to them when I couldn’t, he’d make them back off, or he’d help me make them back off.
“Don’t you even think about running off!” She snarled, summoning her power and taking a shot at Rhodey regardless of the baby in his arms.
While Brail had been avail in printed page during his time, there hadn’t been computers designed for the blind, well, there hadn’t really been computers and Hydra certainly didn’t bother making their tech easy to use for those whose vision might be impaired.
“Call Happy back, call him, the kids… fuck, they’re never going to forgive me for this.”
Even knowing that Steve couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable about the thought of Bucky being locked away in a mental facility, even a modern, hygienic, state of the art one. He still had one of those old asylums envisioned in his mind. Those hideous places with the high barbed wire covered walls, barred windows, dark forbidding walls, and the haunting echoes of screams coming from within, the few inmates allowed outside all malnourished, shaven headed, sporting bruises and sores, their eyes vacant and hollow, anything of a real person long gone.
“Certainly Sir, I shall make that my top priority and arrange for you have the best accommodations as I complete global domination.”
“Why Wanda?” Steve asked her, “What possibly reason could you have for doing this, for torturing Tony like this?”
“Yeah I’m good.” Tony said looking at his reflection in the monitor, damn, Natasha had done a good job, if he didn’t know better he would think that hadn’t suffered any injuries at all and had been getting several good nights sleep.
“Is there a reason you are attacking my ass?” He asked hoping his hair wasn’t too much of a birds nest, he ran a hand through it, yeah, lost cause.
It was only Steve’s quick reflexes that had him catching Zach about the waist that prevented him from running outside in just his pyjamas!
Steve helped him out of shirt revealing livid bruising over the Omega’s ribs and several shallow but nasty cuts.
Bucky.
“A compound for the Avengers, a school, a full garage for all our vehicles, labs and workshops, and a full training facility.”
Pepper made a disgusted noise in her throat and went on her way into Peter’s room, shutting the door behind her so at least Peter and Zach would be spared the sight of their parents acting like horny teenagers.
“Cap’s got a super fast metabolism.” Tony explained with a grin, “He needs to eat every few hours, and the lucky bastard never gains and ounce.”
Tony could hardly believe the response that came from the press after his and Rogers’ altercation during the gala. He had expected to be made the villain of the piece as always seemed to happen, but it seemed that the exact opposite was happening.
“Oh, well, okay, I can teach you.” Tony said, “I had over ten years of dance lessons so I would know how to move on a dance floor at galas and balls, I don’t think I could still do ballet at this stage in my life, but I’m certain I can take you through a waltz, a tango, and a few other styles.”
“In the penthouse. Her Uncle Rhodey is baby-sitting,” Tony said, “Having played escort to me many times, he has a lot of experience when it comes to baby-sitting!”
Peter smiled so gratefully that it broke Steve’s heart and he was never more proud of the boy than when he turned back to Tony, that smile still on his face and proceeded to tell Tony just how much he loved him and how everything was going to be fine.
“Oh god, Oh my God, oh God, we’re dead, we’re officially dead, we’re totally and completely dead and going to hell. I’m going to hell, I’m gonna burn in hell!”
A tuna pasta salad with hard boiled eggs, a protein brownie, and because he wasn’t going completely healthy, a bag of cheese puffs and a chocolate milk.
“Oh come on! This is Shield files. It was part of their intel that Romanoff and Rogers dumped all over the Internet…” Again he froze, remembering how reluctant both Romanoff and Rogers had been to have him going through the Winter Soldier files even though it could help with Steve’s obsession with finding Barnes.
“Right here Asshole!”
“Why not.” Tony said with shrug. Peter let out a gleeful exclamation, setting down the car and went to get the bike and some chains and ropes.
Tony rose a brow at her, “You mean Hydra.”
“Where’s Zach?” Steve asked again. Bruce’s expression told him everything he needed to know, and he was on his feet in a moment, nearly falling over as his head swam, but he managed to keep his balance. “We need to call the police.” Steve said, “We need to get Clint and Natasha here, Sam too. We need to find him!”
“It seems we won’t be traveling after all.” The handler said, “It seems the targets are coming to us.”
“Well, we’ll ask you questions and such, but otherwise, yes.”
Steve nodded and stretched. He didn’t feel like sleeping, he wasn’t in the mood to draw as he was too restless. “What can I do to help?” He asked AI.
Sadly that was true, Steve was hopeless, maybe everyone was hopeless when it came to telling the person they liked that they liked them as more than a friend.
Steve tried to stifle his laugh but really wasn’t successful, alerting Tony and Pepper to his presence in the Tower.
