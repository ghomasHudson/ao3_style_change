“You’re a huge dork and I’m gonna go get dressed. But yes, I am beautiful and you’re lucky to have me.” That confidence was only half-fake, which Tony figured was good enough.
He prepared vegetarian lasagna for them both, he’d set the table up with a table cloth and nice cutlery and matching plates. He sacrificed time and effort to make it look picturesque and homely. The only thing missing was a centerpiece but there wasn’t much around to use. Besides, flowers were for tomorrow after they parted so Tony had something sweet to remember him by.
“It would definitely help,” he answered quickly, he was glad to hear that Tony knew it wasn’t him.  “I’m sorry I should have known better than to not let him know I was bringing you home.  It would have gone so much smoother, but I just forgot.” He paused, sighing.  “Bucky’s OCD can get really bad and I’m really shit at remembering things that would make it easier for him.  And I never react well when he tries to make me feel the same way he does.  That’s what the stories were about - he’s just upset.” He ran his hands through his hair, sitting up against the back of the driver seat.
He took a deep breath, then tried to decide which of Steve’s many other questions to answer next. “It’s not that nothing happens. All of my parts are fully functional. I just don’t like when they do what they’re meant to do, y'know? Once I’m hard with a partner, things get uncomfortable for me because I start focusing entirely on the idea that I’m going to have to orgasm, but being aroused by itself isn’t really bad. It’s just a trust thing. And it takes an awful long time to get me anywhere near orgasm because I don’t want it. I’m all for focusing on your body, honey. I am. And…” He blushed again. “I really appreciate you being open with me. It means a lot. I’m really attracted to you too, in a romantic, sensual, and aesthetic way. But the longest you’ve gone before an all-day sex marathon? Really? Steve? It’s been less than 24 hours since we met.” That was all kinds of ridiculous and surprisingly endearing. “Now that we’ve started, shoot me all your questions, I guess. Let’s do this.”
Steve nodded to Tony. He was used to orange, but now he knew Tony usually used yellow he could look out for that too in case Tony forgot. “People touch so often but they barely realize how much you can say with a soft caress,” he agreed. “I would like to kiss whilst we do this, is that okay?” He brought his hands to the base of Tony’s neck simply playing with the hairs and sensitive skin there.
Steve noticed Tony’s slight falter, it was obvious that worship had been abused too especially if Tony was that uncomfortable with the mere mention of it. As Tony settled onto Steve’s lap he whimpered a little with the weight as it provided friction and the heat of Tony’s warm skin against his clothed erection.
“Yeah ‘course I am.  And if Obie yells at you I’ll kick him in the face,” Steve replied, blissfully unaware of who the fuck this person was but still equally sure that Tony was not going to be facing any nasty repercussions for helping out this evening.  Steve tangled a hand in Tony’s drying hair, twirling it as he thought about how happy he felt.  He drifted off without really realizing he hadn’t finished the conversation.
Tony liked eye contact. A lot. It did tend to weird people out and he got why, so he did his best not to be upset when people looked away, but Steve letting it go on this long was really great and Tony was loving it. And the touches. Those were nice too.
He was surprised by the fast change of topic, but after raising his eyebrows curiously, he shook his head. “No, I don’t really ever. Once in a while, I’ll try, but I always get bored. It’s not worth it. Why is this an important question?”
Steve managed to find his way around the coffee machine, despite Tony’s upgrades. “I have a sketch book of portraits and intimate drawings. That’s where people go. Hopefully you’ll be in there soon enough. I wouldn’t advise rummaging through it, though. I have nudes of Bucky in there from a good five years ago when I started a new book,” he laughed a little. “I tend to only draw people I admire deeply or love. Bucky’s in there, Bucky and Nat have a few couple portraits because I went through a time of being slightly in love with them both. Yeah, it’s as weird as it sounds,” he hummed before adding, “Nat has a few pages, there’s a few pages from a couple of artists I worked with on some group projects…” he trailed off, stretching his shoulders.
“You don’t have to pay me to paint Dummy.” Steve tsked, “I’d do that myself as a gift to you. I can always paint the real Jarvis for you as well, from a photograph considering I don’t think I’d be able to paint your AI child. That is, unless he has distinct circuitry I could paint for you.”
Tony smiled, but he also said, “Don’t do that. It wasn’t that bad. I never thought you were going to hurt me. I did think maybe you’d set me up for about four seconds there, but… I’m not worried. I don’t just carry around NDAs either.” He pulled out onto the street, then drove probably a little too fast towards the edge of the city. “Are you sure about food? We could just get a pizza or something. Bring it up with us. I don’t want any weird hunger noises in the car.” The having feelings thing was somehow more frightening than the stranger yelling at him on the street thing.
Steve laughed, “hell no it’d turn me on but I was just asking because it would be a different sensation to what you’re used to with me.” Steve explained.
“Yes, please.” He squeezed Steve’s hand one more time, then buckled his seat belt.  “I’d like it if you played with my hair when we get back home.  Maybe even wash it for me? Replace all of that touch with yours? But I really don’t mind doing whatever you want to do.  And you can stay as long as you want.  You can even come into my board meeting with me, as long as you’re wearing pants.”
“Dummy is a bit of a weird name for a learning algorithm? Are you trying to be ironic?” he asked. “That’s like calling your child Craptacular,” he joked, honestly curious.
“I don’t think I want to go back home anytime soon, so chilling at your board meeting sounds fab, as long as I can buy you dinner afterwards.  We could go to one of your favorite places?” Steve bribed, nothing short of grateful for Tony’s presence at that moment.
“Oh yeah, huh, a shoulder tattoo?” Steve mulled in his head. “I could get around to this idea. Well now I know what your valentines gift is going to be,” Steve chuckled, wiggling his eyebrows. He rolled over onto his back, pulling Tony so that he lay over his chest. “Is Spring your favorite season? I think I like Autumn most. Maybe it’s the colors. I’m very much into earthy browns and reds.” He grinned, brushing Tony’s fringe aside. “Like your eyes and hair, they’re such a beautiful rich brown. An artist can really appreciate these things you see,” he winked, knowing he was chatting shit he didn’t care. Tony made him feel at ease being vulnerable like this.
“Hey, no, it’s not your fault. It’s not your fault that it took us a while or that bad things happened to me. And I’m all yours now and I’m very glad that I have you to make things better. I want you to tell me. When you’re ready to go public with our relationship. I’m not a superstar or anything, but I’m filthy rich so there will be bad news stories about it. And I don’t want you to have to deal with that until you’re ready. Okay?” He kissed under Steve’s jaw again and let his hands explore the planes of Steve’s back.
“Oh no. You’re gonna kill me,” Tony responded with a little laugh. “Baby, already. And no, I’ll… I’m good.” Dark or not, he didn’t expect Steve to jump to something with explicit depictions of abuse on the first date. “Are you, uh, free tonight? Later? I’ve got this thing, with kids, that I’m late for now, but I usually am. I should be done by six, though.” He could probably duck out to go plan their date by four or so which would give him time. Steve wanted romantic, so he could… this was probably a really bad idea, but he could get dressed up and bring flowers and stuff. “You have any allergies?”
“So which language are you gonna use to tease me tonight, huh?”
Steve half listened to the words, mainly concentrating on their sounds, the way they changed Tony’s voice. He had no idea what was being said but it didn’t seem to matter - at all. Steve could feel himself slightly losing control. In his heart, he could feel that he wanted more and he knew that was dangerous. Humming against Tony’s skin, he pulled away from kissing him. His chest was heaving, from panting and sucking in air with sighs of arousal.
“Would you like me to leave later this evening or tomorrow morning?” He asked casually, moving nearer to the bed.
Tony’s comment about trust, how he needed reasons to trust someone rather than to not trust them. It stuck with Steve. It resounded with him. When Tony kissed him he was shocked, but hastily kissed back. He had funny light-headed feeling as they walked back to the car.
Steve and Tony go on another date and things are moving crazy fast. They just can't seem to say goodbye at the end of the night, though, and skin contact fixes everything anyways.
Steve snorted, oven mitts on as he pulled the lasagna out of the oven. Putting the baking tray down on the wooden, heat resistant surface, he then served it up with a side of rocket leaves, tomato and mozzarella - traditional Italian garnish. He’d tried to be romantic and researched for it.
“He’s so polite. It makes him adorable.” Steve grinned as he let Tony lead him up the stairs towards Tony’s office. Watching Tony’s handprint unlock the office was again extremely impressive. He followed into the office, immediately struck by the amount of computer screens, sticky notes and organized chaos. He smiled, he figured this is what the inside of Tony’s brain must feel like. When the NDA appeared in front of him, Steve didn’t even read what was on it. “I promise, no telling anyone about the awesome things you show me. They can be our little secret,” he winked before placing the pen down.
. “I also have some white lacy stuff. Very form-fitting. Kind of transparent. That definitely goes with the holidays. Add just a splash of red or blue, depending on Christmas or Hanukkah… Alig várom, hogy szép legyek.”
“I mean. That wasn’t the intention, but I love them anyways.” They were the pure ones. He was pretty sure his face could be seen from space at this point. Steve could probably feel the heat coming off of him. But he just chewed the inside of his cheek and pulled back onto the road. “You’re… How did you become so amazing? I can’t… I’m not even sure that I care if you’re playing me right now because you’re doing it so damn well and… I meant it. About giving you whatever you want. I don’t care how incredibly reckless that is. I want to keep you.”
“Yeah?” He was excited that he was obviously getting to Steve, but he really loved that Steve hadn’t said no. He’d been pretty sure that he would say no after what they’d talked about that morning. Christmas was less than a month off. “I wouldn’t say no to putting on anything you picked out for me either, kedves lelkiismeretem.”
“Yeah.  Yeah, you can kiss there,” he answered a little breathily.  He touched Steve where he could, but also gave him the room and cooperation he needed to get all of his clothes off.  He smirked when his pants were moved to show his black, barely-there lace panties and gently guided Steve’s hands to rest on his mostly bare ass.  “I wore these for you.”
“They smell like early spring.” He didn’t really have much more reason than that. Tony nuzzled back and hummed.
“Please don’t think I’m mad at you.  You did amazing in there.  I…” He paused, the L-word almost slipping from his mouth.  “You showed me just how much I can rely on you and really? I’m so grateful.  I just need to calm down because I’m really upset.” Steve spoke, unlocking the car before sitting in the driver’s seat and collapsing against the wheel, careful of the horn.  “I should have let him know we were coming over.”
“I don’t see you as broken at all, and you don’t need work to fix yourself. I’m talking about helping you feel comfortable in who you are, that isn’t about making you normal that’s about helping you feel less like an alien inside your own skin. Whatever standard you’re holding yourself up to is shit. You’re clearly uncomfortable with yourself, there are things you want to feel--want to have--but no one has given a damn to help you work out what those things are and how to get them. That’s what I’m offering to do if you want it. You’re obviously very sexually complex and your partners haven’t realized the multiple dimensions you have. That’s dangerous for you. Not for them--they’re simple with simple needs, but for you. You need your complexities met. Does that sound right?” He asked, ignoring the comment about blowjobs for the moment.  “I don’t see anything wrong with the person in front of me apart from the fact they’ve been hugely underestimated and misunderstood.”
"Steve, no, I’m sorry. I was joking and then yes, it really would be nice to have a date where I didn’t end up crying in your arms because this has already been a lot of emotional vulnerability for me, but I don’t want you to freeze up over small talk because you’re trying not to upset me. If I end up crying again, it’s not the end of the world. Embarrassing as hell, but I want a deep connection too. So it’s okay.
“I didn’t learn this anywhere. Touch has always been important to my sex life. Combining that with the knowledge you enjoy full skin contact… It was easy to come up with this. I already have so many things in my head I want to try from the things you’ve told me. This is what an attentive sexual partner does, Tony.” Steve explained, his hands running up and over Tony’s ribs as he softly squeezed Tony’s body beneath his hands.
He hooked his fingers into the lace, feeling the patterns above Tony’s skin.  “Lace looks amazing on you, don’t you think, baby?”
“Good, because being the big spoon with you would be all kinds of awkward. How the hell do you get so huge on a vegetarian diet?” He put his arm over Steve’s and linked their fingers.
“I’m just going to get them to warm up our breakfast okay? Because these cold waffles look so tragic I can’t face them,” he laughed, nudging Tony’s cheek. “Yours are even more tragic, look at them. They have a few angry scrape marks in them and pieces missing.” He was teasing trying to cheer Tony up. “I refuse to leave the diner knowing that we haven’t eaten the evidence of our first fight.”
“I don’t have the money to rent a studio, so I get what I can. For obvious reasons I try not to use oils. I’ve never really been much good with them anyways. There’s a couple of small frosted windows at the top which you can open up. I try to leave the door open too. It is what it is. I do miss the airy free spaces I used to work in when I was being taught.” Steve hummed thoughtfully.
“This is really romantic,” he added, “thank you for letting me cuddle you, having this contact is perfect.” He hummed softly, using a soft melody he remembered.
“No, you don’t have to tell me everything. Just don’t lie to me in pursuit of a surprise? Don’t say we’re going to the movies and then actually take me on a romantic getaway. That sort of thing. I. Am really looking forward to those flowers now though.”
“She said she’ll bring them to us.” He reached up to start petting Tony’s hair. “How are you feeling now?” He asked, moving to trail his nose along Tony’s jawline. “If it helps to hear you were right, you were right. Talking helped.”
Tony choked back a little grateful sob and then leaned over to hug Steve again, as tightly as he could. “The two helper bots really are like puppies. They just like attention. I taught them to play fetch a couple months ago.” He reluctantly let go and threw the pizza in the back again, then started the car. “I really do have to get you to sign an NDA before seeing my workshop.” He was nervous and he didn’t want to have to, but even with the form, it would be hard to trust anyone around his newest inventions.
“It’s nice to meet you, Steve. I hope you and Tony have a nice day.” And then she left. Tony turned around and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, hugging him tightly. “Didn’t mean for the shouting to get you up. Sorry. Pep worries. You want coffee? Or more sleep?”
“You sound real cute over the phone.” He stated matter-of-factly.
Steve listened to Tony, taking in what it meant.  “That’s kinda poetic.” He hummed, “that you’re seeing the brightness of two stars, but it comes to us as one.” He appreciated them once more through the lens of the telescope before offering it over to Tony, who hummed his agreement.
“She said as long as she never had to read about her godson’s skills with his tongue she’d be just fine,” Steve was still crimson from remembering the story. “She never let me live it down, the first time Bucky stayed round again, as she left for she told Bucky not to get too carried away in case I text her and told her about the experience too,” he laughed. “God, it was so bad.” He giggled a little before adding “You ever sext much? I was crazy on it for like years as a teenager. I have no idea why? It seems pointless now? I think I’d probably only ever do bdsm scenes over text as interactive sexting now. I mean if you’re gonna have a sexual relationship with someone surely it’s better to do rather than talk about it. I mean I know you’re ace but y'know maybe you’ve done those things. Some ace people have done a lot,”
Tony nodded eagerly.  “Of how amazing I’ve been for you tonight,” he parroted back, sounding a little breathless now.
“I have one more. Personal question,” Tony clarified. “Do you believe we’re soulmates?”
“Steve… This looks amazing.” He wrapped himself around him happily and leaned up to kiss his cheek. “And it smells great too. Is the table the surprise? Because I don’t think it’s ever looked that nice.”
Steve chuckled at Tony’s joke, “sure - I would be honored to visit your place. And if--at any point--you wanna back out of having me ‘round please don’t be afraid to tell me. Tonight has been emotional, I understand if you need any time alone,” Steve offered gently.
“What about jewelry? More specifically, non-restrictive collars? I have a real thing for a beauty in a nice collar.”
Tony had never had much of a thing for stockings, but he would love to wear them for Steve. Any kind. “Would you draw me tonight?” He kissed Steve’s neck as asked, trailing little kisses all the way down across his shoulder and then moving back up to nose at his jaw. “You could draw me in this or I could go put on something pretty. I’d really like to pose for you, though.” He realized that might be pushing past what was really okay for today, but the idea of having Steve’s total attention like that was too enticing to not at least ask.
Tony smiled at him fondly, then looked back through the windshield and grabbed the door handle a little tighter than necessary.  “Hey, hey, hey brake.  Red light.”
Tony smiled at the reference, but was feeling a little too vulnerable to laugh. “It helps. With the trust. To prove you won’t run off at the first sign of trouble.” He took another bite, chewing thoughtfully. “I have meds,” he answered after a long moment. “But I don’t take them if I’ve been drinking. So that cuts down on the effectiveness. I’m an alcoholic too. And I’m not at all into sex for myself. I use it for the skin contact or making someone else happy and that’s about it.”
“C'mon you can’t just suggest something like that and leave! Surely your counter must have been moving too?” He asked.
“Are you kidding me? Did you not ever cuddle with your platonic D/s relationships?” Steve asked shocked, before adding, “I really didn’t have you down as a romcoms person, however, I have been informed that I very much act like I am straight out of one, so maybe you are with your soulmate after all,” he teased, holding Tony tight, “I can cuddle you all night if you really want. I’m surprised you don’t get regular TLC like this, it’s very much mandatory when dating me I’m afraid, you’ll be swatting me away soon enough,” he assured Tony with a smile. “I’ve never really been touched starved, I’m very generous with close contact and affection.”
“Six is great, but if you get held up, don’t worry. Just text me and I’ll look at later showing times, okay? No pressure.” He reassured, he didn’t want Tony to get anxious or wound up over a date. This was for fun, and he was a flexible person. “I look forward to seeing you again,” he added, taking care to be extra charming.
“I would love to hear you speak Irish to me.”
Traffic was bad and he was later than expected, but finally, parking where he could, he sent Tony a text telling him that he was waiting outside for him before asking him politely not to judge his crappy car.  He’d tidied and vacuumed it best he could--even hung up one of those car air fresheners in hopes of impressing Tony.  He hoped that Tony would appreciate the flowers he’d sent.  He’d purposely arranged it so they would be left with his PA to deliver when he dropped him off home much later that evening.
“Mmmng Tony you’re so sexy,” he panted, finally giving in. “Way too sexy to be teasing me like this.” He closed his eyes trying to will it away. However, all he could see when he closed his eyes was Tony modelling various different nightwear.
“I understand--they were waiting up for me because I told them I’d be back,” he moved his arm out so that he could cuddle Tony.  “I still feel bad for bringing
There was a short pause after Tony stepped in to defend Bucky’s tease.  Natasha was smiling at the floor as if she found the awkwardness of the moment genuinely hilarious.
"Okay…” Steve sighed, he felt guilty now for not going deeper - he just never saw the need. “I wasn’t purposefully not telling you - I just didn’t think it mattered in the grand scheme of things. I have… a strained relationship with control. I don’t like you giving me orders which you have done or making me feel uncomfortable for not following them but I wasn’t ridiculously upset - I firmly told you not to do it and you haven’t done it since. Trust is linked to control for me. The conversation we have had and are having about trusting someone fully before you scene with them relates to my problems over control. I will need to trust you completely and have that in return. To do that, there are going to have to be firm and clear boundaries - to me though? All of these buttons you’ve been pushing accidentally are causing only mild irritation, and will disappear when you know me. I didn’t think it would be an issue,” he sighed leaning back against the booth. He felt like he had a cheese grater being pulled down his back.
“I’m good baby, maybe not too much of that tonight? Just while I’m around?” he asked as politely as he could. “I don’t feel comfortable around people if they’re visibly drunk you know? I care for you but I’m not about to be your carer after our first date.” He established his boundaries, as much as he was prepared to help Tony he needed those boundaries for his own personal self-care.
Steve wasn’t used to being called out on his silence with regards to his feelings. He felt uncomfortable telling Tony he had done something wrong.
He really wished he hadn’t left Steve behind now because he was feeling more vulnerable than he’d intended to and could use some comfort
“JARVIS is cool with male pronouns for now. He hasn’t really learned enough to choose yet. I don’t like calling him ‘it’ though. I’m not sure he’s actually sentient. We might get there, but we’ll see. You can, uh, you can definitely meet him, yeah.” He was blushing furiously now. He couldn’t believe that Steve was so interested in what he loved.
“I think that might be your trust issues talking to me there. But I’m not about to invalidate your opinion just because my experiences tell me otherwise. How I see it first is you have to have the confidence in your partner to care for you first. From there, you build up how to care for each other. But giving your partner that trust before you start is crucial. A lot of people mistrust at that stage or don’t trust fully and then it can all fall apart,” Steve explained, “BDSM can bring you and your partner closer or help pull you both apart.”
“Having bi-polar isn’t scary to me Tony, but nice effort at trying to get me to freak out. It’s going to take a lot more than that to scare me. But you’re welcome to try if it will help you trust me more.” He took a bite of the pizza slice, wondering how Tony would react to Steve reading him so well.
Steve smiled down at Tony. “I deeply appreciate the offer, but I’m fine for now. Who knows - if this goes well maybe I’d be moving in with you anyway so renting an apartment would be pointless.” He grinned down at Tony, “I’d give you anything you wanted too, Tony.” Steve reassured, playing with Tony’s hair. “I mean I don’t have much money, but I have lots of love to give.” He ignored the question about where he went to highschool.
“No! You know what, Steve,” he almost-yelled, turning back around to face him. He hated getting angry. Hated it. But that had hurt. He’d opened up to something and the universe had taken the invitation to destroy him yet again. So he was pissed. “You don’t get to do that! You don’t get to make me believe that I could actually have someone that was meant for me and would care about me and then make me feel special and like you’re really invested and then not even recognize me when I turn up on your doorstep, ready to give things a try! You don’t get to do that! I brought you flowers because I wanted to give you that romantic goddamn moment I ruined! And then you… I cannot do this.” He turned around again, taking the last few steps towards his car.
“Uh, yeah, I have a couple helper bots with learning algorithms and I have JARVIS. He’s still a baby, really, but he’s learning so fast, it’s amazing.” He grinned and blushed a little more and looked up at Steve hopefully. No one had ever… No one had ever cared about his robots before. When Steve had asked him about passions earlier, his mind had jumped to his work, but maybe… maybe if Steve was interested, he could share this. “I would… Really like to play for you. But I’d like it more if you sang with me.”
“I don’t need to be somewhere and I’m not doing anything, thank you Steve. I’m taking a personal day.” He might be a little flighty, but despite all his complaints, Tony did actually get things done on time and go to all the genuinely important meetings. So he was allowed to take a personal day when he wanted to. “The board can suck it.”
Hugging Tony back, he’d hummed, “Uhm no, not at all. That was just to set the right date ambiance,” Steve laughed carrying the plates over to the table, setting one by Tony’s seat and the other down by his seat that was positioned opposite.
Steve jumped a little at the voice - not expecting it. “Hey JARVIS, Tony’s told me a little bit about you. I was excited to meet you,” Steve confessed. “You’re kinda a big deal. You know how special you are right?” Steve asked aloud, copying how Tony interacted with the AI. He was still staring at the ceiling not yet understanding that you didn’t have to see JARVIS to communicate with him.
“As in my-?” He paused. “My counter’s gone so if it’s based on touch… it has to be?” His breath caught, disorientated, this was not what Steve had prepared for. He caught up to Tony,
Tony immediately relaxed at the feeling of Steve’s hand in his hair, sighing softly, and he tried not to think about how much better it would be if he hadn’t put any product in his hair to slick it back. “Some of the time it’s red and some of the time it’s blue. And I like all music. All genres. I’ve even sung along to a country song once or twice.” He started to rub little circles into his back with his thumb. “I can’t wait to see your art. What kind of stuff do you do? Tell me about it?”
“And oh my god you were so hot.” Steve praised again with a chuckle. “You’re like a drug induced sex hallucination. I couldn’t imagine someone hotter,” he praised gleefully. “If our sex life is just that for the rest of my life, I’m fucking lucky. You look so good in lingerie,”
When the Tony Stark said his name, he abruptly turned around. He saw the roses on the floor, connecting it with the fact this… celebrity had turned up on his doorstep. ‘Didn’t realize I looked quite that bad’… Oh shit, Tony. “Woah, jesus fuck!” He shouted, running after Tony, trampling the flowers without realizing in his rush to not lose his… soulmate?
Steve didn’t witness the blush in its full bloom as it grew on Tony’s cheeks. He did, however, feel the small tuck and cuddle Tony gave him afterwards. He watched Tony walk off the embarrassment, before getting off the bed, undoing his zip he popped the button of his jeans before wiggling out of them. He pulled back the cover of the bed peering into the mattress and throw pillow pile. It looked to die for. Rolling between the sheets he felt like he was swimming in velvet.
He shrugged, “I really don’t like talking about things that sucked. I know you don’t mean to do things because you don’t know what happened - I don’t expect you to mind-read either. Honestly, I don’t get upset the way you seem to. Its fine.” He paused. “Besides, my relationship with my abuser isn’t so black and white. We abused each other. No one is a bad person. We still deeply care for each other. It’s a very different situation.” He tried his hardest to explain although it wasn’t really an explanation at all.
Tony hadn’t expected this to be so intense. He probably should have, since Steve had set up safewords, but it wasn’t something he’d really ever experienced before–someone’s whole attention being focused on just touching him like this. He could definitely feel how serious this was. “Steve? Where’d you learn to do this? It’s… Really nice. A lot. Doesn’t seem like it should be, but here it is.”
“And of course we’re planning gifts. We’re soulmates - time to start getting into the winter routine of spoiling one another rotten. Mm, also if you’re into seasonal lingerie it’s my guilty pleasure. For any future relevance that might have.”
“Whereabouts on my body are we having this tattoo? Where everyone can see it or somewhere only you can see it?”
Steve could see Tony was struggling, so he instantly reached out for Tony’s hand. "Thank you, for letting me know you were finding it hard. I promise I’m not unreasonable. I feel like I’m drowning if someone’s wrapped around me and I’m not in control,” he laced his fingers with Tony. “You’re doing amazing,” he offered hopefully.
Tony tried to start commenting on the theoretical physics the movie was based in, but the tickling definitely distracted him, and if he’d been able to get away, he definitely would’ve rolled off the couch, but as it was, he just laughed and gasped for air, squirming in Steve’s grasp. Eventually, he begged for mercy. “St-stop! Steve, stop stop stop! I’m sorry, fu-fuck, it’s a v-very sweet gest- ah- gesture!”
“I’m up now, coffee? If you’re taking a day off you should totally come see my art studio,” he grinned. “Not that I’m bragging or anything I just very badly want to show off my desirability as a partner to you. Oh, and you should definitely meet Bucky and Nat so I can show you off,” he preened. “They’re not gonna hear the end of it about you,” he exclaimed.
Tony turned around to hug him tightly, burying his face in Steve’s chest again. “I can’t believe you want me. Fate is… normally the worst. But fuck, I’m so glad that this… I’m getting ahead of myself, I know. But. You’re so amazing.” He would cover it though. If nothing else, he didn’t want to look at it anymore. Something really tasteful. Romantic, maybe. “I’m gonna get a drink. Then I’ll be right back.”
“Tony wait!” Steve protested. It was like he had barely listened to a word Steve had said. The reality of the moment dawned on him, and he wasn’t just about to let himself lose Tony again. Unaware of what he could to stop Tony from leaving he wrapped his arms around him. “Don’t do that angry shit where you think the world is against you. I’m not a reporter, or the relative of a rival, I’m not gonna trip you up or sell you out to the news, I’m not here to embarrass you. Honestly, I’m sorry I know how phony this must all seem to you - I jesus, especially since you’ve had so much shit from the public. I’m sorry, I just really didn’t put two and two together. I promise. I’m not here to hurt you. I’m just a little star struck.” He paused before adding, “You could even say Stark-struck.” He hoped the awful pun got through to Tony, if nothing else did. “Please don’t walk out of my life as easily as you walked into it?”
Tony melted back against Steve with a smile, laying his arms over Steve’s.  “Coffee, please.  You’re the best, édesem.” He let go after a second, then watched his soulmate as he left and came back.  “Are we going to just lay down and marvel at the beauty now?” Somehow, he really loved the idea of laying on the ground with Steve and staring up at the sky.  Though he wouldn’t object to going back into the city and cuddling somewhere a little warmer.
“No one knows their full limitations but the whole point of being in control is to stop that from happening. Sub space is supposed to feel good because you trust the person in control to know your signs. You can’t not know someone’s signs. I’ve been full-time for almost three years before, after three months I knew his limits better than he did. Before that we didn’t experiment until I knew him - it’s common sense if you love someone! You were betrayed Tony, don’t you dare tell me it’s because you didn’t know your limits and he didn’t understand your signs. This is exactly why I said you have to trust someone completely before you scene with them. Bucky nursed me back from death’s door consistently as a kid and we only started sceneing at the end of our relationship. How could you argue with me about trust relationships yesterday having been through this?” He asked incredulously.
Steve shook his head.“No, thank you.  I had some coffee when we were stargazing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
out?”
“I love your corny romance,” Tony responded sincerely.  “It… I guess it’s cliché for a reason.  Makes me feel special.” He reached over to squeeze Steve’s hand for a second, then settled back into the seat.  “I’m not worried about being kidnapped.  My parents died in a car accident and I’m just… not used to other people driving unless I’m drunk.  But it’s okay, Steve.  I’m just a little nervous.  And I’m probably going to be a backseat driver here.  Doesn’t mean you have to change anything.  Can we play some music? I want to hear what kind of stuff you like.”
“They like being close to people and being told they’ve done good,” he told Steve with a smile. “They really really are like puppies.” Butterfingers triumphantly brought back the ball and Tony rubbed her arm again while he told her how well she’d done. Dummy, curious and feeling neglected, beeped inquisitively and moved closer to Steve.
“I do think we’re soulmates, yes. You need me, and with time I’m sure you’ll see that I need you just this much too.” He continued his movements against Tony’s back. “Do you like your hair being played with baby boy?”
Steve knew exactly what was wrong. He moved round the table, reaching his hands out to pull Tony into a hug. “Okay, okay. I’m fine now but you’re not so come on. Just get it out of your system. Clearly you don’t really react well to me needing touch distance. You haven’t done anything wrong and it wasn’t a punishment. It was temporary.” His grip on Tony was loose, so that Tony could move if he wanted. “I promise you’re still doing amazing and its okay to cry in public Tony. I’m not going to shame you for it.”
“I don’t like being controlled.” Steve spoke firmly. “I don’t mind if a person can be controlling when it comes to their personal space and things, but that’s a huge part of what affects whether I find someone attractive. If they let me be who I am and give me room to breathe that’s probably the most important. I really dig passion too. I don’t care if it’s passion about the way a particular species of hedgehog eats, if someone is really passionate about what they’re interested in, by default I’m interested too. I like involving myself in other people’s passions too, especially if its somethin’ they want to share. I find it a little romantic. What do you like in a person?” He asked, similarly curious.
At Tony’s protests to Pepper’s wish to clean his clothes Steve smirked, “I don’t think he intends to have me wearing much today, but thank you,” he eased, trying to diffuse the tension with his easy smile and manners.
“It was… I’m just bad at names, I guess. But he won’t respond to anything else now, so it’s stuck.” Butterfingers rolled over with their ball, chirping in greeting, and Tony rubbed his hands down her arm affectionately before tossing it across the workshop. “Go fetch, guys. It’s over there!” He pointed, then smiled at Steve as they wheeled away.
“It seems your ass really did save the date, baby.  It should get all the praise it deserves,” Steve joked, petting the space beside him to coax Tony to get in bed with him.
“Or we can take the stairs. Up to you.” Tony squeezed his hand and leaned into his side. “You’re super cute, you know that? So so cute and gorgeous and amazing.” He leaned up to kiss his cheek, then went with him back downstairs and lead him into the workshop rather than the garage, punching in a code and letting him go in ahead of him. “Hey Dummy, why are my work rags on the floor here instead of in their hamper? Come here. Look at these. These belong here.” He picked one up and moved it to the hamper and then Dummy, instead of picking up and moving the rest of them, got that one out of the hamper and returned it to the pile on the floor. It took another three tries for him to catch on and clean them up. “So, uh, yeah. That’s Dummy. Butterfingers, honey, fetch your ball so we can play a game.”
“I can tell you’re freaked out. I always come on too strong, anyway. It’s a gift and a curse.” He paused, his bright eyes faltering a little. “There’s my number, if you feel like telling me your name and humoring me with a date. If not? You never have to see me again. I should apologize. For making you late to wherever it is you have to be,” Steve rationalized for a moment, hoping he hadn’t made too much of a fool out of himself.
He pressed the middle of the screen to play the video. Dummy was center screen - haphazardly zoomed in and wobbling. Steve was clearly laughing in the background. The bot had some of his art supplies in its claw.
“I’d like it if you’d straddle me,” he declared, patting his knees. He knew it would be easier to touch Tony that way. He wanted to make Tony feel worshipped and respected. It was obvious no one in a sexual relationship with him had respected his boundaries. This was all about boundaries.
“Both of our consent?” Tony clarified.  That’s what he was getting out of that, but he wanted to be sure.  If Steve wanted to have a part in deciding who got to touch him, that wasn’t any more drastic than Tony just agreeing to keep it as just theirs if he wanted, but he did want to know for sure that that was that he was agreeing to.  “I like the idea of that.”
“I like surprises - for the record. But sure, I promise to give you plenty of heads up about what I’m thinking. Does this mean I have to pre-warn you of everything romantic I want to do for you though? Because surprise, I was gonna get some flowers sent over so you had something to remind you of me when I’m not there,” he hummed, his eyes settling on the banoffee pancakes.
“In the morning. If that works for you. Come cuddle me? I want to tell you exactly how wonderful that was.” Open communication, right? If Steve wanted to know what he liked, telling him what was good and why would probably help, right? And he was really happy with how that had gone.
“Are you interested in the BDSM community?” Steve asked, inquisitively, his curiosity piqued.
“No, shockingly, I don’t think I would.” Tony laughed and nuzzled him. “You’ve got me,” he agreed. “What’re you planning on doing with me now?” He definitely wasn’t watching the movie now, and he was pretty sure Steve wasn’t either.
Steve laughed at Tony’s question, flushing a light dusky color on his cheeks. “I guess you could say that but it’s not integral to my sex life. It’s like if someone doesn’t like a position I’m into--its not really a prerequisite for someone to be willing to give me control,” Steve answered as honestly as he could. “But if it’s happily given to me then I’m eager to take it.” Steve summarized, before pausing.
Once Tony had changed Steve couldn’t help but lick his lips. Tony looked so incredibly gorgeous, almost like a dream. “It’s like Aphrodite themself has appeared before me,” Steve spoke, barely aware of his words. “Come sit on my lap, lemme worship that beautiful body of yours,” he garbled desperate to run his hands over Tony’s skin. He’d undressed himself so he was just in jeans and socks, similar to the previous evening together.
Steve laughed, “Yeah,” he nodded in agreement with Tony’s wrinkled nose. When Tony completely skipped the subject Steve sensed that was Tony-speak for not wanting to discuss sex, so he let it slide. He took a sip of his coffee, shaking his head with a smile. “How do you look so flawless in the morning? Like the morning isn’t a good look on anyone but I firmly believe you look good enough for one those vanity fair shoots and you’ve only just rolled out of your lair.”
Steve was walking back with a blanket tucked beneath his arm, it was as if Tony had read his mind.  Rolling out the blanket Steve sat down on the ground, patting the floor in front of him to signal Tony to sit.  “Well, we’re gonna have a coffee and admire the night sky, sure.  And cuddle a little, but I can’t keep you too late, can I sweetie? Do you have more work to do tomorrow?”
Steve jumped a little at the beep, not expecting it. He followed Tony’s lead, gently patting the top of Dummy’s head. “Hey lil guy,” he crooned. “Nice to meet you.” He felt strange interacting with the robot mainly because it didn’t have eyes. Instead, he gave it a cuddle, practically hugging it. “I have no idea how to pet robots. Is this a little too full on?”
Steve went oddly quiet when Tony asked about family. “Mom died when I was younger and I never met my dad. Bucky is my family, I guess. We’ve been close for years,” he tried to distract from the sadness. “Yourself?”
Steve laughed, “uh, nah I never had that problem,” Steve smiled, “I can see how that might happen if you got too excited with it,” he grinned at Tony’s compliment, “I don’t know why, I mostly look like a tomato stuck on a dorito when I’m blushing,” he smirked. “You look cute with color in your cheeks, it makes the bright flecks of gold in your eyes shine. You look like you belong on a Christmas advert,”
“Tony?” Steve asked, wandering aimlessly out of the bedroom. He was shocked to see a woman fully dressed in business attire staring at him wide-eyed. “Are you okay? I can hear shoutin’,” he mumbled, rubbing at his eyes again.
Steve shrugged “it’s more like - I’m seeing how obvious it is in language that everyone equates sexual fulfilment to happiness, that’s all.” He hummed, “I mean you catch me being all heteronormative - not that I am, but I could pass as it if I was with a girl. But yeah, if I was that in people’s faces they’d get annoyed - why should I treat asexuality any different? I’m genuinely curious,” he asked as they walked towards the section with all the classic cars parked and gleaming.
“I care because this is your sexuality, Tony. That’s important. You can’t jump into BDSM and not know your own sexuality, if you don’t know, how is your dom supposed to know?” He asked.
Steve hummed, “this might get personal, and you can refuse to answer, but how do you… do you not finish? Or do you need the environment for the sex to feel right to not vomit? I’m just trying to understand. Or do you just not have sex? Which is honestly fair enough. You say you can do sex, does that mean you want to? Or is it that you want to because the other person enjoys it and it’s their orgasm that makes you feel good?
“I probably ain’t gonna use love, not for a while,” Steve continued.  “Only just stopped using it with someone else, but I feel it.  That intensity, I know it’s here and I’m wild for you too.”
No. It was a lot of personal questions, but he could handle it. “If it makes you happy, I don’t mind, as long as it’s about you and it stays that way. Anything after I get an erection is uncomfortable, but that doesn’t really happen unless it’s forced. It doesn’t bother me to be there while someone else is enjoying themselves. I don’t… I don’t ever really want to, but… In a scene, my wants get mixed up with the dom and it’s confusing. I don’t know.” He was blushing and beyond uncomfortable and this was a disaster. “Why do you care? No one’s… No one’s ever cared.”
“Just wanna touch and kiss you all dressed up - like last night. Then m'gonna shower,” he informed Tony hoping he cottoned onto Steve’s meaning.
“Would touching help or hurt right now?” That had been an incredibly unhealthy environment for Steve, Tony was sure, and he was already brainstorming ways to broach that topic without making him feel any worse.  “I don’t think you’re mad at me, honey, I promise.  I’m sorry that I couldn’t make it better, but I know that wasn’t my fault.”
“No.  Kisses are very intimate.  I don’t want to have to leave you and orgasm tonight, so we’re cuddling once we’re in bed.” He informed Tony, taking the towel from around him to dry himself off.  Once he was finished, he folded both the towels back up and hung them on the rail.  “Do you want to sleep naked together tonight, baby?” he asked as he tugged Tony through into the bedroom, their fingers knitted together tightly.
“No.  And no plaid.  I liked your suspenders though.  Would facial hair touching freak
“I definitely want to show you my ass,” he agreed.  Tony sunk back into Steve’s grip with a sigh, tipping his head forward slightly.  “You’re so amazing.  I can’t believe how wonderful you are.  How lucky I am.” The elevator doors opened and he let Steve take the lead to the bathroom.  “Can I undress you?”
“Oh god no!” Steve replied hugging Tony close. “I’m not about to run away from you because someone else was a shithead.” Steve tried his best to reassure Tony. “I’m just so angry someone treated you that way, I’m so sorry if that came across as being mad at you. I’m not mad at you at all,” he nuzzled Tony’s temple, kissing it softly.
Steve comforted Tony with a few small squeezes. “Okay sweetie. We’ll play it by ear for now, go with what we know you like. Whenever you feel you want more we can build on it but there’s no rush.” Steve advised, calming Tony down - aware that he often grew afraid of not giving people what they wanted right away.
He frowned a little when Steve walked away, then his eyes went wide. “Steve, honey, can I kiss you? I love it. It’s amazing. Your amazing. I can’t believe you did all this.”
“Well, we have loads.  Hot chocolate, a collection of teas, beer?” Bucky offered as he walked through into the kitchen.  Natasha followed shortly, leaving Steve and Tony momentarily in the hallway.  Steve mouthed a quick thank you, his cheeks still sprinkled red from the embarrassment of having his romance style mocked, then he led them into the kitchen where Bucky was boiling the kettle and Natasha was fishing in the tea cupboard.
“We’ll definitely sink into it and it’ll be amazing.” He hugged Steve back and smiled against his chest. “Are you ready for bed? The bathroom’s through there. I probably don’t have anything that’ll fit you, but we can look. Not that I’d protest all the great skin contact if you just slept in your underwear.”
He dialed. Steve answered. He’d barely made it a block away and his heartbeat doubled when he saw it was an unknown number. “Steve? It’s Tony. I’m sorry I didn’t, uh... I… would like to go on a date with you. Dinner and a movie? I know all the best Italian places and you can pick what we go see.”
“I’m not denying that I’ve been raped, Steve,” Tony responded, more serious now. “I’ve been forced into things I didn’t want, I’ve been pushed past my limits, I’ve been blackmailed and emotionally manipulated, and I’ve had my safeword ignored. I have a different safeword now, which helps, but… I’m damaged goods. Trust is gonna be hard. I’ve used cages and rings. I prefer the cages, but it’s still something that I don’t want to do right away with you. I want the intimacy, but. I don’t know when I’ll really be ready for it.” He squeezed Steve’s hands. “Are you okay with that?”
“So?” she asked, pushing up Tony sleeve hoping to see the 00:00 before he could snatch it away.  “How’d you guys –?” She cut off when she saw the scar, eyes widening.  “Oh! I’m uh, so sorry…” she trailed off.  She’d heard of scars before but had never seen one.  She recoiled like she was stung.  “How do you know you’re soulmates, then?” She asked confused.
Steve laughed, “sweetheart, getting to know each other is going to hurt. We both have sensitive spots the other one doesn’t know about. You’ve trodden on mine quite a lot, I’m just like a stone, I don’t blanch easy and I know you don’t mean it. I promise no part of you is going to scare me away and I will always be here to hug you better if you get upset, but it is inevitable. We’re in a relationship. You can’t be in a relationship and have it always smooth sailing. Choppy waters are always the strongest,” he surmised, kissing Tony’s cheek. “We should probably eat…”
Pausing, Steve made direct eye contact with Tony, to show he was serious. Once all the buttons were undone he skimmed his hands over Tony’s shoulders, pushing the material off so it bunched behind him and around his wrists.
Steve moved to look up the telescope, “Mm, you don’t want to know just how badly I have it for you, gorgeous,” he joked, before taking their date slightly more seriously.  “So fun Sirius facts, show off your knowledge sweetie--I have a thing for sexy nerds,” he teased, pressing buttons and flirting back equally.
“What do you think of the newer ones? Are you a fan?” He inquired, holding Tony’s hand tightly. “I have got to show you some cool Star Wars themed art pieces I have. I just have a thing for illustrating Jedi.”
“What about you? What’s your favorite color? Also, what music do you like? I’m cheating with a double question here, naughty me.”
“Mmngf baby,” he purred tilting Tony’s chin so they could make eye contact. “Thank you for telling me, but I wasn’t planning on touching any personal part of you and I never will unless I have your direct permission to,” he hummed grazing his lips across the slope of Tony’s shoulders. His hands slipped under the chiffon robe, fingertips feeling each individual rib before moving round to run his hands over Tony’s shoulder blades.
“It was pretty obvious that you were looking for someone else. And why would you want it to be me?” He paused, leaning against a wall. “We don’t even know each other’s names and I’m a mess and I’m…” He met Steve’s eyes and fell silent, hope creeping in for a second. He really didn’t deserve this. The guy would realize that and then they’d both be even more heartbroken than before. He shouldn’t let himself care.
Steve quivered as Tony’s hands brushed against his hips.  “Your hands feel unbelievably amazing against my skin right now,” Steve replied, returning Tony’s eye contact.  He stepped out of his clothes, moving to brush his hands up underneath Tony’s t-shirt, stroking across his stomach lovingly before taking the hem and pulling it off over Tony’s head.  His hands moved back down to trace the waist band of Tony’s jeans with his fingers.
“Aw, c'mon.  It’s one language and one word and it just means ‘sweetheart.’ You’ve got it that badly for me, honey?” He wrapped an arm around his waist and kissed his cheek, then looked through the scope while he instructed Steve to make the adjustments.  “Here, Steve, look, I’ve got Sirius lined up for you.”
The unexpected hug from Natasha pulled Tony away from Steve a little, but he awkwardly hugged back.  He could probably get used to this kind of casual contact if he let himself.  It was nice.  A little terrifying, but good.  “Ah, Natasha? Right? Hi.  Good to meet you too.  Honestly, I didn’t stop talking about him much yesterday either.” This was all… Really good, yeah.  Welcoming.  It almost felt more real than his home.  And less at the same time.  He managed to pull away from Natasha and squeezed Steve’s hand, glancing back up at him to make sure everything was okay and see what he wanted to do.
Steve chuckled, pulling Tony to him, Steve gave Tony three consecutive kisses to his forehead.  “You can have three,” he teased, moving Tony round so that when he crowded Tony far enough he fell backwards against the mattress.  Steve instantly started playfully kissing and nibbling at Tony’s neck.  It was devoid of careful attention and precision, but it was fun, to make Tony laugh and feel cared for rather than to bring him any sensual or sexual pleasure.  Finishing up, Steve nudged the skin he’d playfully mouthed at before wriggling under the covers.  Sighing, he took a deep breath.  He felt so relaxed, it was positively amazing.
Tony had already kind of let that one out with the question, so he really might as well throw it all out there. “I’m a bratty sub with trust issues. I don’t listen well. But. Yes. I am interested in maybe possibly doing that with you at some point in the future. I don’t think complete trust first is possible though, because once you start, it opens up a whole ‘nother realm of things to have to build trust for.” He shrugged and pulled off onto a less well-maintained road, then looked over at Steve again. “I think it’s probably your turn, if you wanna ask something else.”
“Sure sweetheart. Why don’t we have pancakes?” He asked moving down to kiss Tony’s cheek before moving opposite him. “I’m a working artist - yes. But I also control my art and I give it when it is done from the heart. This isn’t about money, I’m doing this for you because I care about you and your little magical creations you have here,” he smiled. “I don’t want money for them.”
Tony was in a rush. He didn’t really have a reason to be rushing, but he was angry because nothing had been working in the lab that morning and then Pepper had guilted him into going to some kids expo thing. He didn’t even know what it was, exactly but apparently it was vital for the company’s PR. He hadn’t even bothered to put on a suit—or a coat, even though it was December-- still wearing the grease-stained T-shirt with a dragon on it that he’d put on to work in the lab that morning.
He chewed on the inside of his cheek, stared down at the number on his hand, and pulled his phone out of his pocket. It was going to rain soon. If he didn’t call now, the numbers might smudge and then he’d never get the chance. That was probably the worst justification he’s ever given himself.
Steve snorted indignantly, “Since when did I explicitly say I didn’t want it to be you? That’s an outright assumption,” he debated, having no clue why he was still following this person—who, very clearly, had no interest in him either. “Not everyone who loses their counter ends up alone.” Steve blurted out, “I know some people with scarred over counters and broken counters who still found their soulmates.” Why was he reasoning with this person so much? Maybe it was the shards of obviously broken self-esteem that made Steve want to make him happy, or maybe it was the air of disappointment that made Steve want to impress him. “Just ‘cause your timers broken doesn’t mean you are.” He insisted on keeping pace with Tony but he made sure not to touch him again. Not without invitation. “My counter and my instincts led me to this one meeting, are you seriously leaving without at least trying something out. Even a coffee?” He asked, again surprised at how stubbornly anti-soulmate this person seemed to be. Now that he had put it in his mind that they could be connected, Steve couldn’t easily let him go.
"I’m yours,” he agreed quietly, relaxing a little now that he was being held again. “I don’t want it to be never. I want to scene with you and for you to get to know me well enough for that. I do.” He fisted one hand in the back of Steve’s shirt. “God, you keep getting me super emotional and having to hug me better. I really would like to have our next date not end up like this. Just a little hint for when you plan it.”
Tony had been entirely calm until Steve mentioned worshipping his body, but he managed the little bit of anxiety that edged up. He took two deep breaths, turned slowly in a circle for Steve, and then smiled again and stepped closer. “I’d be most comfortable if you kept your hands above my waist tonight, okay honey?” And then he settled onto Steve’s lap again, feeling better.
“Oh god, you’re a tease and amazing. And we’re already planning Hanukkah presents? Love it. That means I do get kisses after dinner though, right?” Tony started to eat too, and was very clearly pleased with what he put in his mouth. “This is as good as it smells. You’ve earned all the Hungarian you want. I can speak exclusively in Hungarian if that strikes your fancy.”
“Oh shush you’re everything I could ask for,” Steve soothed, rubbing his large palms over Tony’s back to relax him and help him feel safe. Steve could tell the moment was probably getting a little overwhelming for Tony. “That’s fine baby, just don’t leave me too long I’ll start missing that sweet smile,” he encouraged, whilst giving Tony his space.
"You want me to find the planets that are out tonight?”
Steve swallowed thickly, it was lucky he hadn’t been chewing or he’d have bitten the inside of his mouth, hard. He cleared his throat. “Tis the season,” he replied airily, desperately trying to suppress his smile. It was so nice to hear Tony flirting with him - he felt trusted. That was a precious feeling that warmed the pit of his stomach. The arousal helped too, however.
It was really nice to have someone willing to take care of him a bit, even if that just meant talking to the waitress to get their food warmed up, and his little freak-out earlier was feeling more ridiculous by the second.
Steve wasn’t an idiot, he knew exactly what Tony had done. The guise of looking like nothing had happened was thinly veiled and Steve could see right through it. As he watched Tony sit down he quirked an eyebrow.
“Bucky you’ve made the weirdest sounds you can’t tease him.” She pushed playfully, obviously used to being the mediator in these situations.
“I think that would make a real classy shoulder tattoo. So everyone can only see it if you want them to. At the gym or the beach or the pool… Or everywhere. Depends on how much you take your shirt off.”
“Honestly I had so many walls set up to save you from this side of myself but I guess you dismantled my entire facade and here I am. Dorky and exposed,” he smiled, “I usually don’t say this sort of shit in public trust me,” Steve assured, slipping off his shoes and reclining.
He let Tony lead him into their bedroom. He paused - he just thought of it as their bedroom. Being far to aroused to analyze that, he shoved the thought to the back of his mind. Grabbing Tony’s waist momentarily, Steve kissed Tony’s neck.
“Tony are you telling me that you want to make sweet, sweet music with me?” Steve teased, with a smile on his face. “How can I refuse?” He nudged the side of Tony’s face with the tip of his nose.
“Your first boy crush sounds absolutely adorable. Mine was my best friend, fairly typical.”
“Steve, can’t believe you tried to sneak him away from us!” Natasha gushed before hugging Tony--without prior warning or permission.  “Nice to meet you! I thought that damn timer was painted on his arm,” she laughed.  “He didn’t stop talking about you yesterday.” She winked conspiratorially.
Tony giggled again at his response, then drifted off not long after Steve.
“No.” Tony took a breath, then explained, “I like the lingerie idea. I could do a ring or a pendant or even a nipple piercing or something. Maybe a cock cage if you were into that in the future. But no collar. That’s… I wish we’d met sooner. I would’ve absolutely loved that idea when I was eighteen. But no. I don’t do collars, cuffs, handcuffs, or chains. Not even decorative ones.”
“I’d like to straddle you,” he answered with a grin, “so that works out well.” He followed him onto the bed, then moved over his lap as prompted, settling onto his legs and then running his fingers down Steve’s chest. All of this was definitely plenty engaging. “Fuck, you’re gorgeous. Look at this.” He couldn’t quite believe how flawless Steve’s skin was or how perfectly defined all the muscles were.
“You bet it does, baby,” Steve reassured, but he was slightly surprised at Tony’s question.  Pulling Tony so he lay against Steve’s chest, Steve hummed, “This was amazing and we’re definitely going to talk about it tomorrow,” Steve replied.  “You did great, though.  Please don’t worry.”
Steve was glad Tony understood his implicit meaning. Even with a lust foggy mind Steve knew they needed time before they took their intimacy to the next level. It was already fairly progressed for Tony to feel comfortable dressing sexy for Steve.
He wasn’t sure if he agreed with that or not. It seemed like Steve knew what he was talking about, but genius or not, Tony’s skillset rested in stem fields–not in sociology. “Maybe? I see what you’re saying, I think, but I also don’t want you hiding any part of yourself from me because you think it’ll make me more comfortable.” He got the keys and started the car, then waited for Steve to get in and drove them a few blocks over to the diner.
Prince Anthony would have to renounce his way of living, his home, his people and become akin to the lifestyle and mannerisms of the East should the marriage take place and Steve did not think neither he nor his family were quite fond of the idea. There were bound to be objections even in his family and court.
“No I am not going to sing anymore.” Tony had a very playful tone. “I am not that good. If anyone hears it in the palace they will throw me out.” As other Omegas in the room giggled, Steve frowned. He had to let Tony know that his voice was beautiful.
“I wish there was a way out Pep. I have tried to think of everything. In a few days I’ll be married to a cruel, unforgiving man who would control me for the rest of my life. I just want this to be a nightmare.” Despite Tony’s belief that by now he had exhausted all his tears, his eyes were now freely flowing.
"I bet you 10 bucks they will start as soon as we leave" said Clint with a smug smile. Natasha raised an unimpressed eyebrow and replied "Like I am gonna bet against that."
“Um Steve, I am not feeling well. I think I need to si-…”
“Now, His Majesty can enjoy the meal,” Agatha said with satisfaction.
He came across many of Tony’s Omegas in waiting on his way. They gave way to let him pass, chattering and giggling excitedly amongst themselves while also bowing down to the Emperor. That is when the voice also stopped but Steve’s trance wasn’t broken. He was still being dragged to the Omega’s royal quarters.
“Captain! Will you be attending the Stark Charity Night?!”
“Well you are the Emperor Consort. This is nothing Your Majesty.” Natasha smiled.
Tony was desperate. He was beyond desperate, he was panicking. He could not go back to another life time of abuse. He had had his fair share with Ty. But he also knew that he was not in a place to say no. His father had already decided his fate and the Emperor of the East had sealed it. As an Omega, he anyway did not have much say.
This particular subject has been worrying Steve too. He knew war is taxing on the economy but it was a necessary evil. He decided he needed to discuss the matters with his most trusted courtiers. “This subject requires special attention. Therefore, we will discuss this in my private court,” Steve announced. “Next subject.”
“You dramatic idiot! I love you so much…I always have. I just could never tell you before all the shit that happened.”
“I have heard that the Emperor is a man of great beauty. It is said that he has muscles cut out of steel, face chiselled out of marble and the stature fit for an Emperor. Betas and Omegas alike throw themselves at him,” said Pepper.
“My Liege, pardon me if this offends you, but they consider us, people of the East, as sex hungry savages. They believe that once you lay your eyes on the Prince, his back story would not bother you My Lord.” Said Sam with an apologetic look.
“He is leaving for Long Island to take care of some important business,” Pepper answered with a frown.
“King Howard’s son, Prince Anthony, has placed two conditions before me. And he would only consent to our marriage if these demands are met. His first condition: I will have to make sure a safe and comfortable accommodation for all his people travelling with him. Second, he wants to have a separate room for his inventions and experiments.”
Living in constant chaos was a part of being the Emperor to a Great Land. The court room hearings, the constant battles, the violence, the blood and gore, the royal formalities, all of them made Steve tired to the bones. But he did it without complaint for his people, his father’s dream and his mother land.
Emperor Joseph Grant Rogers passed away suddenly, 9 summers after his son Steven Grant was born, leaving the burden of running and expanding his empire on his child. Taking advantage of the political crisis in the Rogers’ Empire, Thaddeus Ross, the leader of a large warrior tribe called Hydra attacked the capital city of Brooklyn, in the hopes of conquering the land of East America.
“Nick, Sam” Steve  greeted the two men with a curt nod and a warm smile while they bowed low with a sweeping gesture of their hands. Steve was their mentee and best friend yes, but he was the Great Emperor first. Formalities were now the norm.
Natasha saw the dilemma on his face. She indeed was the best spy Shield had recruited. She knew that Steve’s stupid and unnecessary guilt trip would just lead to him getting a solid punch from Clint. She had to do something now.
Currently they were sitting in the carriage carrying them to Brooklyn. It was just him and Pepper. Tony knew that Pepper was only trying to lighten the mood and ease his tension. They were soon going to enter the Rogers Fort – a foreign place. Tony chuckled at that but did not say anything further. His thoughts were still occupied by the Emperor, his efforts, his gentleness with Tony and the anticipation of meeting his in-laws. They were about to reach.
Rogers looked like he was about to burst. "Is everything a joke to you?" "I already told you Cap, only funny things are" Tony said in a bored tone. He thought he possibly could not piss Steve off further so decided to end the argument quickly. He needed that bed now as another wave of dizziness passed through him.
“I don’t know Tony. What do you want me to say?” Steve replied with a sigh.
“My Prince, I would not even lift your veil without your express permission but I want you to look me in the eye as I say this to you.” Steve did not move from the place he was standing in, he merely hoped that Tony would do as he said.
Looking down upon the battered man, Steve was reminded of his 13 year old self. This time he was not a mere apprentice to the great General Fury. This time he was Emperor Steven Grant Rogers and he would not let any custom or person come in between him and doing what was right.
Despite being less in number, the highly trained Rogers’ army under the command of the Great General ended the battle quickly. Thaddeus Ross was then brought before the Emperor for the customary beheading of the enemy.
“Keep this vial of poison… It is better to end your life than to face a lifetime of abuse.”
Fear crawled up Tony’s spine. He knew that his mother-in-law was not trying to scare him, rather she was telling him the truth so that he could be careful. He wondered what would happen if Agatha did not warm up to him. Would she be able to persuade the Emperor to send him back to California? As much as Tony wanted to go back, he did not even want to consider the disgrace that would fall upon him.
“Who is this man that dares to speak to the Emperor in such raised voice?” Tony asked Clint. Was it normal that Tony was getting angry at this strange man for speaking to his husband like that?
“Sam, there is something else. Please have no fear. Speak freely.” Steve comforted him. It was strange to see his childhood best friend hesitate before saying something. This is how Steve knew that he was not going to like what was coming next.
“You stop crying yourself.” Said Tony as he wipes Steve’s ‘single man-tear’ from his cheek.
“Listen to this!” Clint said. “Now the Prince’s delicate fingers will grind spices and stir metal pots.” His tone indicated that he believed it cannot be done. “Surely that will be done.”
There were sighs of relief and agreement all over the room. All of them knew that Tony had a very short attention span and he would get bored of the medical area before the doctor would finish saying medicine. He also had this constant urge to move. The resting idea will not work very well with Tony.
Tony bent low and touched her feet but unlike Sarah, Agatha made no movement and waited for Tony to get up on his own. After he did, Agatha just nodded at him and didn’t utter a word of acknowledgement. She eyed him warily. Tony felt a chill run down his spine when he met her eyes. He ignored the feeling of danger he got when he looked at Agatha, chalking it up to his paranoia.
At the Charity Gala....
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Enjoy <3
you are necessary to fulfil every scarcity in my life.
Tony laughed at that and was about to respond when he was interrupted.
Tony made his way towards Miss Harkness to greet her by touching her feet when she spoke in a cold, harsh voice. “There is a difference between dreaming and attempting to fulfil those far-fetched dreams,” she said. “Do not fool yourself into believing that a Prince has become an Emperor Consort.”
“Cover!” roared fury, as a handful of some of his most trusted soldiers blocked the view of the prisoner, the general and the young emperor from the army below them. General Fury charged forward and swung his sword in one smooth motion to sever the head of the hydra leader. The blood sprayed across Steve’s face, leaving a permanent scar in his mind and heart.
Pepper had a look of absolute determination on her face. It was a very common expression for her specially when she had to reprimand Tony for doing something stupid. There was no way Tony could say no now. He knew that if he did object and forced Pepper to stay back, no matter what, she will find a way to follow him to Brooklyn and then he may also be at a risk of losing an eye or a finger perhaps.
“We have to do this. As the queen you must be willing to do what is best for your people. Plus, an alpha male of the Great Emperor’s stature would benefit Anthony’s omega status. Imagine he would produce the heir to the Great Empire. He shall be the luckiest omega to ever live.” Howard said as he got up to leave.
His mother looked away and quickly wiped her eyes before turning to him again. It was in vain for new tears replaced the old ones. She spoke in a broken, desperate tone. “Then, my dear,” she said as she pulled Tony’s hand into hers. She placed a small copper vial in Tony’s upturned palm.
Trying to put his friend out of his misery, Tony interrupted. “It is alright, Pep. To tell you the truth Clint, I do not know what love is,” Tony said in a teasing voice. He was way beyond Tiberius Stone. It was no more an issue to him.
Rhodey removed the cloth covering half of his face and fixed Tony with a sideways look. “Tones, this isn’t fair. I was just about to win when the page distracted me.” Even as he said the words, Tony could see that Rhodey had accepted his defeat.
“Eye of the Hawk, you must refrain yourself from hitting our leader. I have full faith in him. He can never hurt one of his own.” Thor asserted. He let go of Clint’s arm and turned his gaze towards Steve. “Oh, Captain of this blessed Nation, do tell me what happened in the meeting room.”
Sam continued, “No ‘self-respecting’ royal family in the West would accept Prince Anthony as their Omega now. King Howard’s coffers are running dry as a lot of his alliances have also withdrawn because of what happened with Lord Stone and his son. He is losing control and power steadily. His only solution was to come to you My Liege, someone in the East who is extremely powerful, rich and would not pay heed to Prince Anthony’s back story.” Then Sam hesitated.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Why not?” Tony was genuinely confused. Why was this such a big deal?
He continued to speak. “Today I have witnessed the true honour of the Westerners. I salute Prince Anthony’s courage and candour. Let me take this opportunity to inform him and every one present here that us Easterners are very broad-minded when it comes to what our Omegas can do. We, as an empire do not tolerate any kind of suppression and unequal treatment of anyone. Everyone is equal before the law of the land, even me. I have decided that this marriage alliance with Prince Anthony is…” Steve took a dramatic pause mainly out of spite as he felt joy when sheer panic flashed in Howard’s eyes “… acceptable to me.”
Tony lunged forward in a strike which Rhodey had been expecting. He easily diverted the blow with his sword and spun around to strike the sword at Tony’s abdomen. The metal sliced through empty air as Tony moved backwards. Rhodey aimed a blow after blow at Tony which Tony dodged by ducking low. Rhodey drove his sword at Tony’s chest and Tony bent backwards to avoid it. It was a close call with the sword swishing past just inches above his eyes.
“We need to get this checked immediately.”
Steve put his hand over Tony's trying comfort him but Tony quickly drew his hands closer to his chest.
The Emperor smiled at Tony and shook his head fondly, eating the food anyway. He seemed to like the way the dish tasted for he had some more. Tony turned to glance sideways at Agatha and found her looking at him in confusion and shock. Tony couldn’t help the smirk that formed on his lips when he saw the disappointment in her eyes and this time he did not hide it.
His people were suffering because of him. He had to step up.
Currently Tony was lying awake in his bed and thinking about the events of the past month.
Steve  nodded, content, and turned to his best friend. The ferocious General looked deep in thought and at once Steve knew that Sam wanted to discuss something very important.
“You fucking asshole! What the fuck did you do to him?” Clint yelled as he barreled down the hallway, his fists turning white and face turning red. None of them had changed out of their uniforms, rushing down to see their fallen team mate. Bruce immediately rushed inside the room where they had taken Tony. He was a doctor after all.
The Emperor met his eyes and Tony knew that he had understood what Tony’s intention behind preparing the meal was. For a moment, they were lost in each other’s eyes, the world around them forgotten, smiling softly at each other – that was until Agatha Harkness stepped forward and spoke.
is not dependent on reaching its destination.)
“Because…” she paused for a moment as if she were expecting Tony to understand her meaning. He had never seen Natasha at a loss for words. “Because you are the Emperor Consort!” she stated.
I love you with so much intensity,
“Good Night My lord.” Said Tony with a curt bow.
“I should be allowed to make a scene after what you did. And once we are back, you will lock yourself up in that lab of yours and not come out till next week! Let’s talk this out now!” Well damn his stubborn ass. Arguing with Tony was anyways like rolling with a pig in the mud. Sooner or later his opponent would realize that he liked it.
Thank you so much for the GREAT RESPONSE.
The Prince hesitated only for a moment, probably intimidated by him, but then spoke in a determined tone. “All my people travelling with me to Brooklyn shall be treated with utmost respect. Their living conditions shall be reasonable and they are to serve no one other than me.”
“Stark…” Steve said in a warning tone. Oh fuck him! Tony could do this. It was just a cut and Stark men are made of Iron. He didn’t need anyone for crying out loud. He had been alone in the toughest points of his life and he was still alive.
Tony knew he did not need to hide the letter from her. She could see Tony’s emotions as clear as day, after all they had been friends for roughly 18 years now. Pepper was the daughter of the royal cook, who accompanied Tony during his play time. Over the years she had earned Tony’s trust and friendship. Other than Rhodey, if there was anyone Tony could confide in, it was Pepper.
“Well then just do one more thing will you?” Tony said with a playful smile of his own. “Stop calling me Your majesty. Just Tony will do perfectly fine.”
“I am the Head of the Home Ministry here in Brooklyn. I run the Empire and this Palace and on behalf of all of us I extend you a very warm welcome.” She said with a proud smile. It was very difficult for Tony to comprehend that an Omega was allowed at such high posts in the East.
“Guys I want to talk to Steve alone.” She said in a tone that left no room for argument. Both Thor and Clint caught onto this and wisely chose to give them some space. Clint was still seething but he knew Natasha could handle the whole thing better than anyone could. They made their exit to the nearest waiting room.
“The food is exquisite,” the Emperor said. He looked at Tony with a tender look in his eyes that softened the war-roughened features of his face. “Every morsel deserves praise. I have enjoyed the meal so much that from now on, on every fourth Royal dinner, I will only eat Italian food from the Emperor Consort Prince Anthony’s kitchen.”
. He quickly withdrew his hand.
King Howard looked up in surprise and so did Steve’s own courtiers. Famous for his indomitable and fiery temper, they were expecting their Emperor to get angry at the outset of being bound by conditions. “All his demands will be met to his satisfaction and let me emphasize that I would be most pleased to do so.”
Tony on the other hand, unaware of all that was happening, was still in the middle of his rant.
“A hello would have been nice sweetheart” Pepper knew there was no way that Tony was gonna miss a night so special to his mother just because he couldn’t control how he felt about Captain America.
Currently none of them were paying any attention to Fury's usual 'shouldn't have done this' 'shouldn't have done that' shit. Bruce was unabashedly dozing off in the corner and Clint and Natasha were murmuring quietly to each other. Meanwhile Thor, fascinated with the new StarkPhone Tony had gifted him, was once again trying to text Jane. Steve was busy trying to control his anger and Tony was looking forward to his bed, feeling unusually tired.
Hey guys!
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve continued. “Because from now on I will make my own decisions. Not only will I make decisions for myself. I will do what is best for my motherland and my father’s dream in my own way.” The General knew that any protest or rebellion now was futile.
---------------------------------------------------------
As he entered, he could here Tony’s chatter and Steve could only dream of the day when Tony would feel free enough in front of him so that he could hear him rambling. This was followed by a harsh clanging noise. He was in the room designated for meeting outsiders when he saw how much Tony had changed the interiors. They had a very Western touch to them now. The cushions, the curtains, everything was from the West. Maybe this was Tony’s way of feeling more close to home. But he still couldn’t see Tony, he was deeper into the quarters.
“As you wish, your highness.” The boy retreated with another low bow.
“No, Pep,” Tony said, wiping his tears and walking towards his bed, the parchment still in hand. “I will be hurting my people by doing so. Mother said that this marriage was essential for the safety of our people…”
“Pardon me, Tony if this is out line,” Pepper said from above him. “What if we manage to send a message to the Great Emperor himself, informing him that you are against this match? He couldn’t still be willing to marry you if he knows that you do not wish to go through with this wedding.”
Steve prayed as he knelt at his father’s grave. “Dear Baba, help me. I have come to your sacred grave with a dream – your dream of a united America under the Rogers dynasty. Bless me so that I can turn it into a reality.”
“Why was Bruce of the House of Banner appointed as the new Prime Minister and not me?”
“Do not try to teach me the meaning of marriage boy,” Miss Harkness hissed. “Which marriage are you talking about? The one that hasn’t been consummated yet?” she said in a sneer.
“Which is almost always.” Pepper smirked. “Now I have a company to run. Will that be all Mr. Stark?”
Tony decided to end his misery and stepped forward. “It wasn’t Pierre’s fault, Your Majesty. I had asked him let me prepare the feast.”
Tears were now freely rolling down Tony’s cheeks. He understood all that. He did. And he was just as concerned about the well-being of his people. But, he still could not believe that he was being used as pawn in the political game of chess, with his feelings and opinions being spared no thought. The worst part was that Rhodey was also deployed now. He did not have anyone to share his grief with.
“Nothing you say is gonna convince me to attend the Charity Night. There is no way Pep. No way. Nuh uh.”
“While I absolutely condemn the bruise on Tony’s wrist…I mean you should know better to control your strength. I can see that your anger was justified. Stark needs to understand that he cannot offer himself as the bait during every mission we go on. He is not the Shaggy or the Scooby of this gang.” Steve gave her a small half-hearted smile. “I understood that reference.”
this one-sided journey of mine,
Tony was speechless. He had tears in his eyes. Natasha was not wrong after all. Suddenly Steve moved away. “I know you don’t want this. I hurt you and I am sorry. I will never bother you with this again. I hope this, my feelings, don’t come in between our friendship or the Avengers. I just - ….”
“Oh, darling I don’t want you to say anything. All I know is that you don’t care about me. You sure would have shown more emotion if something actually happened to me on the miss - ….”
“Long live the Rogers Emperor Steven Grant,” said the chamberlain, his call echoed by the other courtiers.
“What are his conditions?” Steve’s voice was as calm as it could be in a situation like this.
Steve sat on the side of the bed, slightly facing his Omega. He felt Anthony tense up even more by his side. May be the Prince was just nervous like he himself was? Steve decided to at least make the first gesture and then gauge his reaction.
“Pray speak,” Steve said.
Steve heard a huge applause break out from the stands of the arena along with Bucky’s proud and distant cries of ‘that fucking idiot!’ and looked over to see his friends Bucky and Sam standing there with 3 other men. From their attire, Steve deduced they were from the West. Two of them were Alphas and the one woman who accompanied them was a Beta. He smiled at them and urged the elephant to move towards the royal stand with his feet.
The trio stood there and watched as Steve got on small stage that was set up for the performers and sat on the grand piano that was laid out.
"YOU ARE HURTING ME TONY. YOU ARE HURTING THE TEAM. I KNEW YOU WERE NOTHING BUT A LIABILITY TO US."
His courtiers, once more bowing low, left the court room walking backwards so as to not show their back to the Emperor as was rule. General Barnes and Wilson were the only ones in the room other than Steve, King Howard and his men.
The feast was ready. As per custom, the Omegas were walking towards the dinner set up at the royal courtyard. Steve along with all his important Generals and Ministers was sitting at the table. It was a party of around 200 people. The courtyard had been elaborately decorated with a Western theme. The typical abstract and bold patterns were making the courtyard look absolutely exquisite.
“Remember, my dear,” she said, “Agatha’s word is law here. Steve has the utmost respect for her. Even I do not compare at times. I was away for almost 15 years of Steve’s life. It was Agatha who nurtured Steve with love and warmth and made him into the Emperor he is today. At times, he may ignore what I say, but, he always follows Agatha’s advice.”
Steve got to his feet and closed his eyes, letting the rhythm of Tony’s voice wash over him. The song was a siren call. As if in a trance, Steve walked away from his throne, cutting his way through the courtiers that were staring at him. His heart pulled him towards the source of the magical sound and his feet moved of their own accord.
“This is a very special song, for a very special someone. I have really hurt this special someone in the past and was never able to tell them how I feel about them. This is my lame attempt to convey how I feel because I do not deserve a conversation with them and I can no longer sit on my feelings. Here it goes…”
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The King smiled and nodded but then his expression turned grim. Steve knew that with a man as calculating as Howard, this was not the end of his bargain.
He looked at Pepper who had entered to wake him up and probably get him ready for the journey to Brooklyn. Tony surprised himself when the first thing out of his lips as soon as he woke up was, “Where is the Emperor?”
Oh how wrong he was.
Try as hard as he might, Tony’s voice shook. What his parents were asking of him was too much. He could not possibly marry and live with an Alpha who was potentially abusive, dominating and more controlling that Tiberius had been . His parents were asking him to accept things that were against every fibre of his being.
“Yeah buddy actually I am looking for an answer to the question that why did you call me sweetheart that day on the helicarrier?”
Steve was broken, but his hope wasn’t and now he was determined to at least make Tony aware of how he had felt all along and a determined Steve Rogers was a very scary Steve Rogers. Bucky’s words not his.
It really was peaceful in Captain America’s arms. Tony chuckled to himself. He was feeling sleepy now, maybe he could close his eyes for two seconds.
“Will you stop this time or do I have to bring an army of superheroes again?”
“No, Sam,” Steve interrupted. Steve was curious to know what his people thought about his marriage to the Western Prince. “Let Brock speak his mind right now.”
He was expecting his Alpha to claim him on their wedding night, his own will be damned. He had not been able to hide his tension as the Emperor had entered and when he had tried to touch him, it had taken everything in Tony’s power to not shake like a leaf. The Alpha was huge, he could have easily killed Tony if he wanted.
CHAPTER 3
ALSO MAJOR TRIGGER WARNINGS FOR ABUSE AND SUICIDE. PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHILE READING.
“Let him go Sam. He’ll be fine.” That was Bucky. Uh… he can’t thank God enough for bringing his best friend back into his life.
Tony had spent the entire night before he was to leave for his wedding, carefully packing all his plans, notes and tools. He did not know if he would be allowed to do this after the marriage, but he was willing to take a chance. May be he would be able to hide it in his room? May be, by some miracle the Great Alpha would let him do this if Tony was a good Omega? So he called Pepper for help and before he could fit any of his clothes in, he filled the large boxes with stuff from his lab. The whole process was unsually calming.
both belong to you more than they belong to me.
Tony was in his lab, his safe place. He knew that no one, whom he did not want to see, could enter. Despite this, he shut the door to be safe and closed all the curtains through which the setting sun was shining. He went to his desk, lit an oil lamp, grabbed a piece of parchment along with a pen and began writing.
“Bring me the vessels in which Prince Anthony has tasted the food. I wish to eat from the same plate,” the Emperor announced. Tony looked up to meet his husband’s eyes and found them smiling at him with unbound affection. “The food will taste better that way.”
“Welcome, welcome, my dear Prince,” said a blue eyed omega who Tony came to know as Clint Barton, bodily ushering him towards his quarters. He was supposed to be the head of his Omegas in waiting at the Rogers Fort. He had already become friends with Pepper and anyone that Pepper trusted automatically had Tony’s trust.
Steve wondered if he had misheard. The King expected Steve, the Emperor of the East to marry a Prince of the West? Not only was such an engagement never heard of but Steve  found it surprising that the King would be willing to let somebody from the East marry Prince Anthony. The feud between the East and the West was centuries old and Steve was the only Emperor till now who had dared to not only venture into but also conquer several parts of the West. He knew that most Royal families from the West were either in great fear of the Rogers army or thought that he was rotten to the core. May be even both. This offer had shocked Steve beyond belief. Even Bucky and Sam were standing there with their mouths open.
to live without you, O heart, is so difficult.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
it is a prized possession for me, since you were the one who gave it to me.)
The spell was broken by some kid calling for the captain and Tony immediately knew he had to go back. He couldn’t take this any longer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
“I declare that from now on every prisoner of war will be treated with utmost kindness.” He now raised his voice and addressed all his Generals. “I declare that there shall be no beheading, no insulting and abusing the prisoners of war. It is against every fibre of my being.”
“Pep I am telling you, he his gonna be there, with his baby blue eyes, stupid perfect hair and that lumberjack beard. He will look at me with his sincere eyebrows and I will fucking melt Pep. I would go fall straight into his arms and he will push me back, like he did last time and Pep I swear to God I will not survive it a second time.” Tony was breaking her heart with his pleading tone.
“The hell I would be. I have a lot of plans of my own sour patch. And specially after what happened with Ty. I don’t care what dear old dad, the king, has to say about it. I have tons of shit to invent. Have you looked at my plans for the village far east? They are bound to impress even you. Marriage is not something I am planning on anytime soon.”
Steve saw exactly when Tony left. He had his eyes on him the whole time. He could see that Tony was crying but then he left. As much as that confused Steve, he knew he had to complete the song. Complete his thoughts, his one-sided conversation. He continued singing.
The following two years that he had spent hiding, were the most difficult years of his life and that is including the time he spent fighting in the war. Probably the difference between now and then was that back then he had no home that he had left behind and now it was the love of his life that he left had broken and beaten in the middle of nowhere.
A red haired, petite woman made her way towards him and greeted him with a low bow. She looked as deadly as any General Tony had ever met. But how was that possible? She was clearly an Omega. Were Omegas allowed in the army in Brooklyn? Tony knew how hard he had to beg Howard to merely receive training in swordplay from Rhodey.
With every word that Brock spoke, Steve’s blood boiled with rage. “My Lord…” he growled low in his throat. He couldn’t believe that his people were spewing degusting words for his Omega and him. Steve had always tried to ensure a sensitivity to the Western culture in his empire. A hatred towards his Omega to this extent was shocking.
Making up his mind, Steve rolled on the ground between the animals legs and reached the other side. Using a shield on the wall as a foothold, he jumped on the Great Elephants back. The elephant roared and tried to shake him off its back, almost causing Steve to fall over in the process.
He held the royal sword in his arms in front of Steve. “I, Nick Fury of the Noble House of Shield, loyal servant of the Rogers dynasty, reminds you once more today that the fate of the Rogers dynasty is in your hands, Steven.” Though overwhelmed, Steve took his sword with steady hands.
He had expected a burly old man to step in, ask him for his demands, snub them, move on and force Tony to marry him at sword point. He was not expecting a man, straight out of his fantasies walk in, talk to him with utmost respect and then not only accept but appreciate his demands publicly.
He appreciated that Tony held his eye contact. Steve had mastered the art of eye-fucking; the powerful, steady stare came naturally to him and he loved to use it in intimate moments. He leaned closer to Tony, moving one of his hands to that he could run the fingertip of his index finger over Tony’s jawline.
“I guess you’re really not used to my sort of intensity, either,” he smiled, “it’s okay, we’ll take today easy, although I’ll miss all that fantastic skin touch we had last night,”
“Orange it is then. And green to kissing.” He swallowed, but held their eye contact. “What are you planning on saying with your caresses, Steve?”
“I’d love to do a double celebration of Hanukkah and Christmas. Traditional cross over huh?” He smiled, “A joining of the old and new testaments, even if one is just a good bit of fiction,” he winked, joking about the Jewish perspective that the New Testament was not valid scripture.
“Back to the Future sounds perfect,” he agreed. He couldn’t help but love Steve. He knew it was way too soon for that, but he was so sweet and kind and understanding and he liked the bots and said dorky, awful things like ‘fab’ and he couldn’t help it.
“I’m not sure. The Princess Bride, maybe? I love the whole concept of Stargate. I watch that a lot. And there’s a couple cheesy holiday movies that I watch every year. The Santa Clause. I like that one, even if it is very definitely Christmas and not Hanukkah. And I’m a sucker for Hallmark romcoms.” He cuddled back appreciatively. “I haven’t been touched this much in years. It’s… Really really nice.”
Nat burst out laughing--she hadn’t heard that one before.  “Oh my god.  Pulp Fiction Steve? What the fuck?” She was biting her lip and chuckling as she shook her head choosing to pour the hot water as distraction.  Bucky was smirking too, mimicking Steve.  “I’m ready to blow, Buck,”
Really, though, any positive feedback would be really appreciated by both of us. Kudos and bookmarks are amazing and wonderful and you guys are great, but even just a single exclamation point in the comments is a little more personal, and feels a little more special. And! You can add that to every chapter so we know you're sticking around! Questions are good too. Feel absolutely free to ask questions in the comments.
Tony looked down at his phone when the call went silent and then shoved it into his pocket. He had to focus on this expo thing for at least an hour.
Maybe watching the sunset would be… Maybe it would be enough. Maybe Steve would do all the talking and Tony would actually be able to just sit back and listen for a change. And Steve trusted him enough to get in a car with him and go to an unknown location, possibly far from civilization, at sunset. That was. Impressive. Unless it still was a setup and Steve was planning to murder him and steal his car.
“Thank you, so much,” he deadpanned at Tony sarcastically, finally focusing on him. The chiseled cheekbones and sharp jawline were quite breathtaking but this person obviously wasn’t anticipating a soul meeting and he’d been through a similar heartbreak before--there was no way he was repeating it now.
“It’s okay to mourn what you didn’t have. Has anyone told you that? But it’s also sometimes for the best that it happens the way it does. Your Butler and his wife have raised a beautiful person. I give them every credit for it, the same way I hold respect for any single mother.”
“Sure, I’ll just grab a little sketchpad and pencils, totally would love it if you’d be so kind as to model for me,” Steve smiled, winking, before letting go of Tony to dash inside the house. He refused to let Bucky go out or even to the door to just look. The more he thought about it the more horrible it seemed to be. Imagining people gawping at you whilst you’re trying to live. He shook his head. It’s rough.
“Fuck, sorry, I’m sorry. I’m… I’m being dramatic. I swear I don’t mean to be, I’m just… I didn’t think… I’d ever have a soulmate. And then I convinced myself, but… Fuck, you start shouting at your friend like that when you see a celebrity on the street, too? That was… All kinds of awful. No, I don’t want to meet your friend. Especially if he’s gonna be Stark-struck too. Just… Let’s go enjoy the movie? Maybe we won’t miss it?” He looked mournfully at the poor trampled flowers and reluctantly pulled away from Steve. He did feel exposed, but he wanted to run–not hide.
“Sure I am,” Steve cooed, smiling down at Tony. “No one’s been possessive with me--I’ve never had an exclusive relationship, remember?”
“I’d want you in my sketchbook. For the people close to me,” he panted, part of him determined that Tony needed to be in there. “It’d take a while too - do you really wanna sit for me that long?” The kisses tickled his neck. Tony’s lips were soft and warm against his skin. “Can I see you in something pretty despite there not being much of an occasion to do so?” Steve asked, eyelids heavy and ready for sleep.
“Holy shit that’s so cute. Butterfingers squeaked at you like a guinea pig?” He looked spellbound. He watched the bots grapple with the ball. “Awerh jeez that’s adorable.” He still wasn’t sure how to interact with them yet, so he just watched them astounded.
“Baby if I got a man-bun Bucky would rag on me for trying to be him.  But I can grow it out a little for you, if that’s what you’re digging.  I still think Bucky will rag on me though; I feel it coming.  Besides, I think he liked the short hair.”
“You know your ass looks amazing in everything right? I’m an artist; I know what a masterpiece looks like.”
“Of course it’s okay - honestly I was just trying to think of ways we could be compatible.” He defended weakly, worrying Tony would get the wrong impression now. He didn’t quite know the right words to say that he was angry Tony had been used as someone’s emotional and probably physical punching bag. Nevermind the fact he was asexual on top of all that. Part of him didn’t feel like he wanted to broach the topic of sex again for a while. An awkward silence rolled past them. Steve definitely talked better with his body.
“You think so, huh? Alright, what’s your full name?” Steve looked down at Tony, placing an arm behind his head so that the position was more comfortable. He’d been played at his own romantic game. His cheeks and the tips of his ears had a smattering of rouge across them. Tony liked the color of his eyes. Not only that, but the image of Tony in a red and green Christmas sweater made Steve inwardly croon. He took Tony’s advice about the name, although a flower tattoo wasn’t really his style. Maybe a single daffodil, to represent Tony. Maybe.
Tony leaned back more so he could turn and kiss Steve’s cheek, then asked gleefully, “This is one of the most romantic moments of your life?” He brushed Steve’s hair out of his face and traced the edge of his ear with one finger.  “That’s so so sweet.”
It wasn’t the word in particular. It was just that Tony hadn’t really thought about Steve touching him at all. And worship implied that it would be about him, which was the opposite of what he wanted. This was about Steve.
Steve crooned at how adorable Tony was being. Resting his head against Tony’s he hummed thinking to himself. “Well, I’ve spent a very long time with my ex, since I was young enough to get hard, so a lot of my funny stories that I immediately can think of involve him. Is that okay?”
“I would really like that,” Tony responded sincerely. He brushed Steve’s hair back and then leaned up to kiss his cheek again. “You’re being such a gentleman,” he teased. “I like that. I think it means you get to choose a movie. And maybe we’ll do your favorite cuddle position this time.”
“It… It is nice, yeah.” He wasn’t sure about romantic, since they were in this position because he’d had a bit of a breakdown. For the second time on their first date. And wow, their relationship was probably really going to be bumpy if this was any indication. He definitely didn’t want the night to end though. Nobody had ever just held him like this before. Not without an ulterior motive. Which Steve still might possibly have, technically, but that was beside the point.
Tony was about to issue his next orders, about which dish was to be prepared first, when an attendant arrived into the kitchen.
“ENOUGH!” roared Steve.
Tony’s eyes were wide open and mouth agape. Miss Harkness’ presence always put him at unease. But, she had never uttered more than a couple of words to him. He was just as surprised at hearing her talk to him and he was confused about what her words meant.
Now, comparatively calmer, he continued, “Yes, the flag of the Rogers Empire will be flown across all of American land but along with the flags of humanity and compassion. We are not invaders who loot this land. We are rulers of America and we will act as such.”
Steve glared at Bucky. It wasn’t his fault – he was just the messenger. But, he was the Emperor and conditions were being imposed on him. It was annoying. After all, it had been Howard’s request in the first place. Now that everything was set up, all their families and relatives were here, there was a possibility for the marriage to get cancelled.
Tony pulled back and spun Rhodey’s sword on the axis of his blade, gleefully, mischief shining in his beautiful brown eyes. Rhodey put his hands on his hips and looked at Tony with amusement and pride. Tony saw the cloth on his best friend’s face flutter as he sighed.
you are my god, and you are in my prayers too,
“Sam I am surer about this than I was about joining the army. I spent two years going through hell because I couldn’t tell the man who has my heart about how I felt. Now even if Tony hates me, I can’t spend one more day without expressing how I feel and that my feelings are not dependent on his. I will love him no matter what and to be honest, I know Tony would never sit down with me and have a conversation about feelings. This is the only way.”
“But, the protestors in Queens may have a point, Madam Harkness.” said Alexander Pierce of the House of Alexia, one of Steve’s Nobles and spiritual advisers said as he stepped forward.
“Let me go Steve. This is not funny.” Tony’s voice was weak and he was getting dizzier by the second but his determination of walking back to the tower was not subsiding. He looked around for Natasha to be the voice of reason here. Steve always listened to her.
It wasn’t long before that the opposing king was brought before Steve, bloodied, bruised and on his knees.
(this journey is perhaps more beautiful than the destination,
And Tony did. He cried till his heart’s content and then some more. The tears just wouldn’t stop.
“I have made my decision Maria.” Howard said in a firm tone. “I am not here to ask you for your opinion. I am here to tell you that it is your job to train Anthony to be on his absolute best behaviour when he marries into the Great family. God knows that boy is trouble. Specially his new obsession with inventions. Do you know he blew up the entire stable day before yesterday? No wonder Lord Stone’s son dumped him.”
“I am pleased and proud that you have entrusted California to us.”
Four summers after the death of the king, the war came a head. Steven, all 13 summers of age and newly presented as an Alpha, had already started grooming up as the Emperor his people looked up to him as, under the guidance of the loyal General of the Rogers family, Alpha Nick Fury of the House of Shield and his wet nurse Omega Agatha Harkness. He was supposed to lead his army to victory in this battle.
His voice dropped down to a steely whisper, "You ungrateful brat. You don't even appreciate the power you have. The chance you have. This whole thing has always just been you satisfying your ego."
“What do you understand?” Tony asked.
He stared at the Great Elephant straight in the eyes and then roared like the true Alpha he was, letting the elephant know that he was in charge. Beside him, the other fighter, one of his loyal servants who had decided to help his Emperor, dodged the Elephants trunk by moving around haphazardly. Steve tried to mount the elephant by holding its large ears but the beast shook its head wildly, making him lose his grip.
“The honourable Phil of the House of Coulson,” it was announced. Phil, Steve’s finance minister stepped forward.
And what could Tony say to that? He just politely asked his mother to be left alone. He had some thinking to do.
His happy thoughts were interrupted by his phone ringing. It was Pepper.
“For that reason, Prince Anthony wishes to have a private audience with His Majesty in his royal tent,” As Bucky read from the parchment, he looked uncomfortable under his Emperor’s stern glare.
He grabbed a hold of Steve’s wrist. “You really do care don’t you Spangles?” Tony said in a tone that he thought was mocking but really came out as hopeful.
Steve only partially regained his senses as he was about to leave the court. He turned around to find his courtiers looking at him strangely. He swallowed hard, wondering what it was about the voice that made him want to abort a court session. “Disperse,” he ordered.
“The piano is ready as per your request. You have 3 minutes.”
A smile slowly formed on Tony’s lips as he blushed like a tomato once again. The glow returning to his face.
Meanwhile in Brooklyn…
She was right. Tony was a fighter. Why was he submitting mindlessly to the whims of his father and the Emperor? He had to take a stand. He had to have his last attempt at defying this union. Tony knew for a fact that he was good at pissing people off. Perhaps he could push the Emperor into cancelling the union himself.
Steve gave him a gentle smile and put his hand on king’s shoulder. “Your people will prosper in the Rogers Empire. You will be treated with the respect you deserve. Buck…”
The Rogers Fort was architectural masterpiece. It was designed in such a way that when a sound is made in a certain spot of the Fort, the walls reflected it so that the sound was heard in another, distant part of the fort. It was especially useful when the Fort was under attack and the guards on the other side of the Fort needed to be intimated or the spies had to keep a track of the enemy’s plan. But, right now, the design made it so that Steve could hear his Omega sing softly in his palace.
“No! Get away from me! I am getting the hell out of here.” Right as Tony was about to storm off, he heard the announcement of the next performer which made him stop dead in his track.
The King visibly steeled himself before talking. Perhaps, Steve should have steeled himself too. For what he heard was not something he ever expected to hear from the other King.
“Greetings to you too Miss Potts.” Tony loved the fact the Pepper was being treated with full respect.
“I have
“What is it, Sam?” He had asked Sam to investigate further into Howard Stark and his proposal. He knew something was up. This was not what a well-respected King of the West would do if they had another option.
“It is quite beautiful,” Tony said softly. “Inform the Emperor that I like his gift very much.”
“How long was I out guys?” Tony had completely forgotten to ask this question.
He got up, took a deep breath and willed Steve Rogers away as he switched to his Captain mode. He needed to be strong for his team.
Tony stopped his play with the swords and answered. “Tell the Queen that I will be with her shortly.”
Tony sagged in relief. He had these weird feelings about Steve since as long as he can remember but his brief state of trance right before passing out articulated his thoughts for him. He was in love and the forehead kiss just pushed him over the edge. It was the sign Tony was looking for and now he had a date. With Captain America.
Tony felt his face heat up even more – which at this point should have been impossible. He cursed his body for reacting so much to the Alpha’s touch. Moreover, the Emperor had not been angry with him. Just busy. For a person who took pride in the fact how quickly he could piss people off, Tony was very happy with that confirmation.
“Prince Anthony, enjoy the world of the Rogers. But, don’t ever try to be a part of it.”
“Nick, how is my dear Maria?” Steve  asked, smiling fondly and the memory of Nick’s little daughter who had no regard for these formalities and had proceeded to climb on the Emperor’s lap to pull at his beard the minute she had met him. “I hope all is well at your home?”
“Victory is still a victory sour patch.” Tony couldn’t help but gloat. He too removed the protective head gear, freeing his luscious brown locks. “I have defeated you and you succumbed to the might of Prince Anthony Stark” he said with a smirk and held his sword up. Rhodey smiled and retrieved his sword from where it was hanging on Tony’s blade.
Steve glared at him briefly before shifting his focus to Bruce once again. “They are transferring him to his room as we speak and you can go see him after.” Steve nodded and made a beeline for the Private wards.
Tony, on the other hand, was desperately trying to free his wrist from Steve's hold. But he was no match to Captain America’s strength even though he knew for a fact that Steve was not using his full force. He was literally yelling at Tony, holding him forcefully and all Tony could think about was how close he was to Steve.
“On your guard!” a palace solider announced as Steve entered the court room. This was the informal one, saved for special matters and occasions and a personal audience with the Emperor. It was large enough to fit at least 500 men comfortably, with silver and golden engravings on the wall. The court room itself was truly magnificent.
“Thank you My Lord.” Tony was still looking at the ground but he did not offer anything else. Steve wanted to hear him chatter again.
There was a moment of uncomfortable silence as the Omegas began to serve the food and Tony was still looking down, not meeting anyone’s eyes. Then to his absolute shock he heard the Emperor say…
What can I say Rhodey bear? You can’t know you can only believe.” Tony laughed.
“Yes, it is,” Tony answered truthfully. Because it really was.
“I appreciate your courage in speaking your mind. And I am quite honoured by your proposal and by the fact that you would consider me as a good match for your son. I thank you for it. Let me give it some thought. I am leaving for my monthly visit to my father’s grave tomorrow at dawn. I will give you my response after I return.”
And then, a few days ago, as Tony was deep into his plans for the running water system, he received an invitation from the Emperor asking Tony to join him for a walk. Wanda, the Omega who had brought the invitation to him was giggling and blushing all the while conveying it to him. Pepper and Clint nearly lost their minds and immediately started fretting over how he looked.
His plate was placed in front of the Emperor and the attendants served the food to the other courtiers as the tension in the hall eased. As the Emperor made to taste the ravioli, Tony stepped forward in a hurry.
“Talk to him about what Bird-Brain. I have nothing to say.”
Steve sighed. “Have we given them the last chance to call off the battle?”
“Come on, everyone, listen to today’s menu,” Clint said and all the other chefs followed him. Tony saw the large pot in which the meal was to be made and made his way to it.
