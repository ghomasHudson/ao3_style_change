The archer often pranked the team, but mostly Tony, and Tony being himself, would always retaliate bigger and better, Steve had unfortunately gotten caught in the middle of their war last time and had not been happy when his hair was dyed pink for a month. They were lucky that during public events he could wear the suit with his cowl up, or their punishment would have been 100 times worse. A grin comes to his face at the memory of Tony and Clint doing all the cleaning and Anything else that the Avengers needed for 3 weeks.
30 minutes and an ice pack later, (Bruce got thwacked in the face with his wing while wrestling it into the harness) Steve was set, now all he needed was a shirt and they would be on their way.
“Steve..ugh” Tony tried to push Steve away but Steve didn’t budge. “Steve... I'm gonna.” Tony tried again to push Steve away from him, but Steve just swallowed again and hummed. Tony cried out Steve’s name as he came in Steve’s mouth and down his throat, Steve swallowed everything Tony gave him and then licked his dick clean before he crawled up to see the debauched inventor who was still panting from the strength of his orgasm.
Tony clapped to get everyone's attention, “Loki, thank you for your help, you can go do whatever it is that you do in your rooms,” with that Loki smiled and zapped back out of existence. “Bruce, let's get the scans and whatever other tests you need to do so we can all get settled and calm down, alright?” Tony looked at Steve where he was still on the bed. Steve nodded and they all watched as Bruce moved around the lab gathering supplies for doing some quick tests and taking samples.
so i have been getting a lot of people saying that they don't like the gender changes, and i was questioning if i should go back and take that part out of the story. i would try to change as little as possible, just take the gender changes out and make it still readable and continuous with the plot. please tell me what you guys think.
This is it, after three years of hard work the story comes to an end. I would like to thank each and every one of you for coming along on this journey with me. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did, please leave a kudo and comment below, and stay safe!
"He doesn't want anyone to know. Even when I asked him to see if he would talk to you, he just about started freaking out again. I'm not allowed to tell you anything but if you can get him to tell you then that's fine. Believe me Tony I want to tell you, I wanted to tell you from the start to get your help but he is having a really hard time with this and just needs a friend right now. Will you talk to him?"
“I think it is time to wrap up, its late.” The Captain turned to Loki and gave him a look of utter sadness and guilt “Sorry you weren’t able to join in, maybe next week?” Loki was so caught off guard he just stared at the man before nodding. Steve smiled that megawatt smile and then turned to herd all the avengers back to their rooms after cleaning up the room.
“It's good to finally be free,” his voice is low and seductive. he smirks and sashays, there is no other word for how he moves, over to Tony. Tony lifts both of his hands and points them toward the other Steve realizing that he was the one to be fighting.
A few minutes of teasing later Rogers made a questioning noise and walked back over to Tony’s prone body, he pulled him up by his hair into a standing position and circled him like a hunger shark.
“You did an amazing job, I am so proud of you and how you have handled all of this. You are so strong, I don’t think I could deal with all this if it was me.” Steve shifted so he was laying more on his back and he could look up at Tony. Brown eyes met blue, Tony's face softened and he continued to stroke his hand through Steve’s hair. Steve reached up and stilled Tony’s wrist, rubbing his thumb across the pulse point.
They got out and walked into a large pink building called Victoria’s Secret. If the explosion of pink and everything lacy didn’t tell Steve what they were getting here then the half-naked women posted all around the store did.
An evil grin crossed Steve’s face and she quickly got up and riffled through Bucky’s shirts until she found a rather large one and changing into that one while dropping her pants leaving the shirt to fall almost all the way down her thighs covering the boxers, she climbed back onto the bed and quickly straddled Bucky’s waist.
P.S. for the 30th chapter I am planning to make it a long one so it may take me some time to get it out but, i promise it will be good!
Steve slipped them on and found that they were incredibly soft and felt amazing, she turned and saw the was that the gold lining cupped her ass and she couldn’t wait until she showed Tony, he would probably combust from just one look.
“Hell, we didn’t even do anything more than hands and mouths till he saved me from the Hydra base that first time. physical stuff was always hard for him before the serum, he couldn’t always get it up because of his poor circulation and even if he did it wouldn’t last for long. I think he thought that with everything else he could still be himself, be a man. To bottom would have made him a dame, but one who didn’t have curves.”
After a humiliating check up with Bruce once he arrived, Steve and Tony had went back to Steve’s floor and watched a movie on the couch. Steve had his wings relaxed at his sides, but one wrapped itself around Tony’s shoulders.
Steve swallows a few times around his length and rubs his tongue against the sensitive underside, then lifts off and lets Tony fall from his mouth with an audible ‘pop’.
“Jarvis dim the lights.” the lights dimmed and the flickering candles cast weird shadows around the room. Once they rinsed off they went to bed not minding to put on more clothes and Steve fell asleep on the pillow next to Tony's head.
“Fine then. You look an’ tell me if the boys at the dock ever talk about that, I'm quite interested to hear how much you know about
Tony grinned and leaned over to lick from Steve’s ass to his dick. Steve let out a single squeak of pleasure and Tony did it again. It was so much and not enough at the same time. Steve never felt so good before. It was embarrassingly fast, but after another few licks Steve shot off onto Tony's tongue. Tony kissed his stomach and pulled back. Steve just laid there for a little trying to get his blood back to his brain.
"Sure Cap, see you in the morning." Tony called over his shoulder, he and the rest of the team continued on to the den while Steve retreated to the elevator.
Natasha was much better at wrangling his wings into the harness than Bruce, she didn’t get injured. Once he got a shirt on, both of them got on the elevator and went to the penthouse. When the doors opened Steve stepped out, but Natasha didn’t.
“Because he saved my life, Loki will be staying here. He was banished from fairyland, There. Now shut up and leave my kitchen, its too early for this shit!” Tony threw his hands up and walked away as he finished explaining. He slammed the door to his room closed and flipped the lock, knowing full well that it wouldn’t keep anyone out but knowing that it would detour some. The sound of the door slamming woke Steve and Bucky who were sitting up on their arms and looking at him with that same lost puppy dog look. Tony just let out a long groan and flopped back on the bed between the both of them.
There was a cacophony of noise, Steve’s shriek, Bucky's interested groan, Loki's laugh, but she ignored all of it. She strode over to the cleared section of the lab where Jarvis was scanning Loki when they walked it.
Tony woke up for the first time in a while feeling rested. He slumped out of bed and took the elevator to the common floor so he could get his morning fix of 3 cups of coffee. Someone (Clint) stole his coffee maker again so Tony called the elevator and went to the common floor where there was always about 3 coffee makers going at the same time.
Steven groaned at the feeling of the hot water pounding on his tense muscles and cleaning him off, he basked in the feeling for a bit before he decided he couldn’t put it off anymore. He carefully slid his hand down his back and traced his ass, he took a steadying breath and leaned over so he had better access, when his finger first probed his abused hole he nearly whined at the raw feeling, he scrunched his eyes closed and worked to clean himself as best he could.
“Why don't you put your toys away, I've always been more of a lover than a fighter.” he takes a gauntlet in his hand and pushes it to Tony’s side moving even closer until he is chest to chest to him and he whispers something in Tony’s ear that makes him blush. Before he moves away he kisses Tony on the mouth and turns around walking back to Steve and he licks his lips as he grabs Steve by the throat and backs him to the wall. “You are such a little shit. Keeping me bottled up for so long, it got boring after a while, feels good to stretch my legs. I haven't been in control since that night after she died.” he smiled when Steve let out a whimper and tears slid down his cheeks. The other him jolts and falls to the ground, behind him Tony holds up a repulsor. Steve falls to the ground like his strings have been cut.
“Whatever is going through that thick skull of yours right now, just know that we love you; nothing will change that. I'm sorry we reacted badly, it was just a shock, I'm pretty sure if he wasn’t so worried about you Tony would be hyperventilating right now.” That got a bittersweet smile to pull at the corners of Steve’s mouth. “We need to figure out what this all means, what we are going to do and what has to happen now.”
"You were offline and Master Rogers asked it be kept a secret from the rest of the team. The next morning when he had... difficulty's he inquired about you, but I had no way of contacting you. I proceeded by taking scans every day to show development and growth." Jarvis pulled up the growth charts next to the others to show just how large Steve's wings had grown in 5 days time.
Steve nervously walked further into the floor and to the door that led to the bedroom. Steve put a hand on the door and bowed his head, taking a deep breath he knocked on the door. His super hearing could hear shuffling and a groan from inside.
"Found the prisoners, or... what's left of them." He called out as he looked through the cages again and instantly regretted it.
“There, all done, now doesn’t that feel better?” Tony kept his tone soothing and he continued to cradle Bucky to his chest until the shivers stopped wracking through his body. Once he settled down a bit Bucky held onto Tony like he was a life preserver, Tony just sat and accepted the physical touch.
“Well from what it sounds like it’s a knot. Which means the DNA I couldn’t read was canine.” A muffled voice that sounded far away could be heard over the speakers as well.
Before she could answer Clint, she was grabbed by each arm and ushered out of the room by Nat and Pepper...
“Very well sir,” Tony could swear that he heard a hint of humor in his voice as he left the lab and took the elevator to Steve’s floor.
“Missed you so bad, Buck. I-I want you. Want all of ya’.” Bucky looked up at Steve and saw the pure love in his eyes. They had never gone that far before, just hands and mouths, sometimes rubbing off on each other. But, now, just the thought had Bucky aching for it. He
When Steve woke it was dark out and Tony was wriggling around and talking to J.A.R.V.I.S in rushed frantic tones. Groggily he let go of Tony and sat up rubbing at his eyes and stretching his wings out from where he had been laying on them.
“Hi Mr. Thor God of Thunder, sir. I am Peter Man- no, I mean Spider Parker-” Peter was stumbling over his own tongue and Tony could feel how painful that was, he pulled Peter over and tucked him under his arm.
Steven looked around when he awoke, he immediately saw Rogers and Tony pressed together still, even in sleep. He dressed and slipped out of the bed to use the bathroom before coming back in the room and standing for a few seconds, he didn’t know what to do but figured that standing in the dark and staring at Tony and his evil twin cuddle was probably weird.
It reminded him of when winter would come around and he would set up in bed for weeks at a time from the colds and other bugs he caught, the image of Bucky puttering around his room taking care of him and fetching him this or that brought a sad smile to his face.
“We are going to talk about this further later, but now I want to get into my own bed with the two idiots I love and sleep forever.” Steve’s shoulders lowered slightly. At least Tony wouldn’t try to kill Loki (or Steve for that matter) right now and they could talk about it. “J.A.R.V.I.S, take Loki to the guest floor.”
“I see that you are awake now,” the HYDRA goons that walked in were followed by an older man in a lab coat, his face dripped with pleasure as he watched Tony on the table. He walked around the room to a refrigerator behind Tony and pulled a bottle out of it. Carefully, he measured out a syringe full of the liquid and flicked it to get the air pockets out.
“Go ahead and talk while you still can, I have a feeling later you won't be as lippy with me.” with a grin Rogers pulled away from the wall and walked them to the guest room. He set Tony down rather gently but the second Tony regained his stance Rogers had a hand wrapped around his throat, it wasn’t cutting off his air, and it wouldn’t likely leave a bruise, rater it was a physical way to remind Tony that Rogers was in charge.
It was early and the sun was rising so he wouldn't be able to fly over the city for much longer. He landed and decided to walk to the warehouse-like building the Winter Soldier had been seen frequenting.
“Want to feel you around me, being the good little cock-warmer you are.” it wasn’t a question but Tony answered anyway.
Tony’s lips were soft and sweet, everything Steve had ever imagined and more. Steve, once out of his shock, started to kiss back. He leaned over more and slotted their mouths over each other. He took Tony's bottom lip between his and sucked on it, drawing a whine from the smaller man. Tony’s tongue traced the seam of Steve’s lips making him gasp. Tony deepened the kiss, his tongue licked into Steve’s mouth, making a noise of pleasure leave the taller man. Steve had backed them up to the wall and pressed Tony against it. His hands held Tony’s hips and slid over his ass, he gripped under the genius' thighs and pinned the smaller man to the wall. Tony’s legs wrapped around Steve’s hips and Steve thrust their hips together, they both let out a moan. The feeling of their still clothed dicks rubbing together was mind blowing.
“Steve. Breathe,” she pulled him down to sit on the bed. “Ok, explain to me what happened and what you are doing.” Steve didn’t look at her, his head was dropped and he was staring at the floor. Natasha moved between his thighs and took his head between her hands, pulling his gaze to her. “I know it’s hard, but you need to tell me what Loki did, we can help you Steve, but only if you let us.” Steve nodded and took a steadying breath.
Steve woke to unbearable pain in his back, His sheets clung to his skin with how much he was sweating. He had to decide what to do, He
“who said that I was helping you?” Steve looked at Bucky as Loki grabbed his shoulder again and took them back to New York, he could swear that he saw a glimpse of recognition in Bucky’s eyes, he watched as Bucky dropped his stiff posture and a pair of beautiful obsidian wings unfurled from behind him before Steve’s vision was clouded with the searing green of magic, and he had to close his eyes.
Bucky dropped down from above him and kicked him in the back, right between the shoulder blades where the sensitive oil glands resided. Steve dropped a few more stories before he got his wings under him and he furiously pumped them to get himself back to Bucky. Bucky, however was fast and he led Steve to the roof of the tower. It was an open space covered in gravel where they could continue their fight. They both dropped from the air onto the gravel and got right back to their fight, the rocks crunching under their feet as they ran at each other again. They grab at each other and hold the others arms so they can’t punch again, this causes them to resort to using their wings like battering rams into each other's sides and sensitive under wings.
This entire week was a shit show. Steve sagged against a brick wall of a demolished building that fell in the fight. Clint had broken his arm, Bucky’s flight feathers had gotten singed off by the flames of one of the stupid bombs that Steve hadn’t seen fast enough and to top it all off, Tony was gone. He dropped his head onto his knees where they were pulled up close to his body, he felt every bit that sick little kid from Brooklyn, not even able to carry his own weight. Something soft brushed his cheek and he flinched but when he looked it was just his wing, they had wrapped around him like they always did when he felt small and helpless, he reached out and dusted off some of the grime from the fight. His lip wobbled as he thought about Tony, how he washed both his and Bucky’s wings with such care.
“There you go, now, I didn’t tell you right away because you were sleeping for the first time since the fight and you needed it. Secondly, if you hadn’t worked yourself so hard I would have, but you are no use in helping Tony if you can’t keep your head up.” Bucky gave Steve a glare but ran his hand through the soft golden hair.
"Allowing access to the footage taken while Masters Rogers and Banner were conversing is breaking Doctor-patient confidentiality, and I cannot in good conscience allow you access to those files, sir." Jarvis's cool British tone only further angered the inventor, who was running on coffee fumes after a 3-day inventing bender in the same lab where every night, he tried (and failed) to find out what was wrong with Steve.
Steven jumped when large hands slithered around his waist. Rogers pushed his hips up against Steven and he could feel the heat of his erection through his shirt.
"Nice pectorals Cap" Steve flushed his signature blush and this time Tony could see just how far it went down. When Tony saw Bruce his eyebrows furrowed together.
“Steve,” Tony kept his voice indifferent and he tried not to let any of his curiosity leak into his voice as he asked the question that had been on his mind since he found out that Steve wasn’t straight. Steve’s head shot up at his name and looked at Tony. “Do you love Bucky?” Even though Steve had expected something along those lines from Tony, his whole body froze. he felt like he was in the ice again, he physically shivered and then tried to answer Tony’s question.
“-best if I looked at him now.” Steve looked down at Tony in his arms he was half asleep and was finally calming down.
The silence stretched on, Steve couldn’t take it anymore and he darted out of the room and down to the Gym where he flew and perched himself on the highest ledge he could find.
“glad you enjoy it.” he said and dipped a finger into the cup with Steve. Steve wrapped his arms around it and gave it a little squeeze. Tony twirled his finger in the cup, pulling Steve along for the ride.
"My mother was an Irish immigrant that came to America for a better life, before the war, and even after as I have learned, there were still and there continue to be divides between people and I am sorry that it is somehow still happening in our beautiful country. I in no way am trying to take away from what is happening to you with my story, but I tell it to you hoping that you will know that there are people who understand and who do not think any less of you for who you are."
“I think it’s starting to go down.” Steve slowly sat up, mindful of their situation and then proceeded to thrust his hips a little, the movement jarred Tony and he let out an whine. Some cum leaked out and Steve tried again, this time he was able to pull out with a ‘pop’, Cum steadily leaking out of Tony’s abused hole.
“OH~” Steve groaned as Bucky moved his hand a little lower. “Mmm, Fuck! Oh god it's so good!.” his head falls back in ecstasy and Tony chuckles and starts to move faster to get Steve’s attention. “Ughnn, Shit! So good, it's sooooo good to have both of you, unhh.”
He exited the room and started to cook some eggs, when they were almost done Rogers stepped out of the room, fully naked still except for the smug grin on his face. Steven ducked his head and blushed, going back to stirring the large pan of scrambled eggs.
“Buck,” he said when he got his breath back. Bucky ripped his hand away from Steve’s body. He shrunk in on himself and turned to hide, he knew that Steve would never punish him like Hydra did but, the fear of acting without an order was still ingrained in his mind.
“Sorry, I can't understand you. I'll work on something to amplify your voices wavelength and have Jarvis order some doll clothes that are in your sizes.” Tony turned around and handed Steve a little piece of paper towel and then filled a cup with warm water.

“Greetings fellow warriors!” Thor’s voice boomed out as he made his way over to them. “Friend Tony! It is good to see you. I see that there are a few new faces among us.” Tony couldn’t tell if Thor already knew about the wings and was prepared for it or it was just one of those things that didn’t faze Thor, simply because he had seen it before.
“Steve.” Tony rasps out. He whimpers when Steve pulls off with a ‘pop’ and looks up at Tony, Steve leaned up and kissed Tony again. Steve’s hand traces its way down Tony's body, he rolled his balls in his hands, then moved down to rub at his entrance.
“Do not cry, it has been long since then and though they still hold a piece of my heart with each of them I have found that time makes all easier. that was only the story of my first born there is 4 more, do you still wish to continue?”
“I-I can’t. Nat, what if he’s hurt! What if Loki brainwashed him like Clint! I need to see him!” Tony was hysterical and he didn’t notice the tears running down his face until Natasha pulled him into a hug after wiping his cheek.
I have started to go back and edit the previous chapters in this story, all the chapters that have a name have been updated, all the ones that still say chapter 13, chapter 14, etc haven't been updated. not much has been changed, I mainly just wanted to go back and fix mistakes that I have made.
“Tony, I'm fine. I tripped and fell while trying to make a sandwich, nothing is bruised but my ego.” Steven chuckled to try and lighten the mood and pushed himself up from the floor, he hissed in pain and almost fell back down, but caught himself on the counter top and clutched it with a white knuckled grip until he got a hold in his breathing again.
The second Tony got back with the others, he went looking for Steve, but Natasha caught his bicep and pulled him back from the doors, she had a pitying look on her usually stoic features.
Steve glued herself to Nat and Pepper’s sides as the browsed the shelves of lingerie. They moved to the shelves of some more safe looking bras and Steve began helping tell the girls what she liked and what she didn’t like. Once they had picked out a few that Steve felt ok with Natasha and Pepper followed her into the changing room. They had one of every size bra that Steve picked out and they got to work fitting her.
“Hi Mr. Stark!” Peter’s voice reached him as he stepped off of the elevator, he patted DUM-E on the arm as he passed.
“Mmm, smells good. What is my little housewife making me today? Eggs? Well, why don’t I give you a little treat, does that sound good?” Rogers slipped his right hand down and cupped the obvious bulge in Steven’s pants. He chuckled and Steven felt the sound through the vibrations in his chest. “Look at you, just begging for it, once you let yourself have a little taste you can't stop, can you.”
There were three Hydra agents terrorizing people where they landed. Steve quickly knocked them out with his shield and took off again.
“Yeah, you remember how much you liked it, having his cock in our ass.” Rogers expressed his words by grabbing onto Steven’s hips and grinding his erection along Steven’s ass. Steven turned so red he matched his shield. “You want it, a cock up your ass, filling you up and splitting you open, let's see if that ass is as tight as it always was.” Rogers grabbed Steven by the back of the neck and bent him over the island, with his other hand, he tore Steven’s sweatpants off of him and curled his arm around to pull at Steven’s erection,
“Strip,” She stepped back and crossed her arms in a passive-aggressive manner. Steve opened her mouth to complain but Natasha had the look on her face that she got on missions. Steve reluctantly stepped out of Tony’s sweatpants and took the hem of the shirt in her hands again.
“I know that you are in pain, but I promise that it will feel so much better once we get rid of the damaged feathers. I'm not going to lie, when they are pulled it's going to hurt like a son of a bitch, Stevie here cried like a baby after he had to pull one that got damaged,”
The radio was softly playing in the background and that little crease between his eyebrows meant that he was so absorbed in his art that he hadn’t noticed Bucky was home yet. Bucky leaned against the wall and watched for a while as Steve sketched.
“U-ncle!” he was out of breath and just laid on the floor for a minute trying to get his breathing regular again before he got up and smacked Tony on the back of the head. Tony yipped and somersaulted over the back of the couch, leaving it and Steve between the two of them.
When they got back to their floor and got ready for bed Steve was pink and trying to make himself small again, Bucky and Tony both noticed, but decided to give him a chance to tell them what he was thinking about, when Steve laid down with them in bed and had still not said anything Bucky had had enough and finally poked the bear.
He threw away the garbage and the old gauze before he stood with his hand on his hips in front of Steve and just waited.
“Calm down,” Tony’s face held a mischievous grin. “you look like you are marching off to your death. It’s nothing bad, actually, if I’m correct it will be pretty awesome.”
“You have to massage it to get the oil, and then spread the oil over the feathers one at a time. If one is out of place  try to fix it, if not tell me and I’ll pull it, that really hurts so try to fix it as much as you can.”
“I want an interview set up with a reputable paper and a talk show, lets also set up a meeting with Xavier and some community service events where we can make an appearance. Oh, and send DUM-E up with the shirts I have been working on.”
Tony had always found Steve attractive, hell anyone with eyes would find Captain America attractive. Tony may have a little bias because even when he was barely 2 weeks old Howard was already shoving Captain America down his throat. (it was actually a rather patriotic poster of Captain America that he had in his room that he first figured out he like men because of). He had been pretty sure that Steve was a straight as a ruler, but with this ‘Evil twin’ thing going on, there must be at least a sliver of want based off of how much Rogers flirts with him.
“Sand·wich, noun, an item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal.”
so tell me what you guys think, I love hearing from you and it makes me so happy to read all of your comments.
"Oof" a little rush of air left his lungs when he flopped down on his bed, spread starfish on his stomach. He fell asleep the second his head hit the pillow.
“Ok Ok. I'm up, I'll start on the communicator once I get some coffee in me," Steve gave a little chirp and pulled the wing closer around him. “and I'll look into those clothes.” with that Tony got up and went into the bathroom to do his business.
“No Jarvis, I have to talk to him face to face.” Jarvis didn’t reply, so Steve got into the elevator and pressed the button for the common floor.
The whole team was eating lunch in the common floors kitchen when the assemble alarm went off. Steve stood up immediately took charge.
‘I have breasts. those are real breasts attached to my actual body.’ his mind helpfully supplied him (her?!) with this information.
Tony comes first setting off Rogers and as Rogers fucks through his orgasm Steven yells out and cums all over his stomach and chest. Sweat pools with cum in the divots of his abs. Rogers pulls out and then Tony does, both exhausted fall to the bed with Tony on the middle.
Steve woke up before Tony again. He turned over to look at him, his weight shifted the bed and Tony turned over on his back but stayed dead to the world. Wait a second, he was big again! He almost woke Tony right then, but he had better a way than just shaking him awake.
Bit of a long chapter but i wanted to really show the relationship between Tony and Bucky. i hope you enjoy!
“I'm going to let you guys talk this out yourselves, but just so you know Steve, if you hurt him again, you will pay for it.” She kissed his cheek and stepped back into the elevator letting the doors shut and leaving Steve to talk to Tony.
Tony knows that he isn’t going to last long, between the blowjob and the 200lbs of horny Super Soldier rubbing against him he is surprised that he hasn’t gone off yet. Tony shifts his hand in the gauntlet and is able to enable the release. Steve doesn’t even notice, too busy bouncing himself on Tony’s cock intermittently with circling his hips on the downstroke, grinding his ass into the cradle of Tony’s hips. Tony quickly undoes the other arm and then his hands are running all over Steve.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is requesting your presence on his floor,” J.A.R.V.I.S’ voice pulled Tony out of his sleep, He curled up under the covers for a second before he rolled out of his bed and put on some clothes before he stumbled into the elevator relying on J.A.R.V.I.S to take him to Steve’s floor.
They were silent as the elevator ascended to Steve’s floor. They arrived and both excited, it seemed that they were at a standoff over who would break the silence first.
“Are you ok?” Peter’s eyes were double the already ridiculously large size that they were normally. Tony waved him off and pulled up the paper.
“You're right, I'll go have some tea.” Bruce could feel his shoulders sink as he left the room and boarded the elevator that would take him up to his floor.
After the ‘helping hand’ Tony gave to Bucky he told Steve. Steve was fine with it. They both decided that there should be no more sexual advances placed on Bucky until he was in the right mind and fully able to consent. This caused some confusion, Bucky didn’t understand relationships, at all. especially romantic or sexual ones. He seemed to be in a constant state of confusion so Tony helping him was hardly on his radar.
"It's ok Steve grooming is mainly done by a mate and is very common to create that reaction." Steve turned even redder if that was even possible at Bruce's insinuating about the erection he was sporting at the moment.
It turns out that Bucky had an 18-foot wingspan to Steve’s 20-foot, but Bruce says that is likely because Bucky is shorter and weighs less than Steve so his wings can work without being 20ft wide. They also find out that Bucky is more agile in the air than Steve who is more direct in his flying. This is contributed to the fact that Bucky had been in possession of his wings for likely much longer than Steve and has had time to train with them. Tony immediately notices the pull the arm has on Bucky and Bruce shows him the X-Ray took of his spine, it shows the arm is wired into his spine and is likely pulling his spine out of his back with the weight it has, it is surprising that he can still fly with it but Tony notes the large flight muscles pushing and pulling his wings while he hovers in place like Bruce asked, he decides then and there that he needs to get his ass in gear and finish the arm he has been messing with.
“Wha-” Bucky’s eyes bugged out of his head when he saw Steve sitting on his naked stomach in that big shirt of his that fell just right, the low light of the room accented her breasts and the shadows the fabric made were pornographic. His arms automatically went to her hips and he could feel himself tenting his underwear already. “Stevie,” Bucky was panting and his hands trailed up and down her thighs, petting the soft skin that surrounded his waist.
“yea- yes, th..they did.” once Bucky could speak he wobbled out a few words that broke Tony’s heart, he was going to burn Hydra to the ground, after he cut their dicks off and forced them down their own throats. Tony hugged Bucky and smoothed a hand over his sweat damp hair in an effort to quiet him.
When Steve walked back into the room Bucky was still with Tony, he got into a defensive position when he saw Loki trailing in behind Steve. Steve simply raised a hand and Bucky settled back on the bed but he remained vigilant.
“HA! Take that bird brain!” Tony had a shit-eating grin on his face and a mischievous glint in his eye that Loki had only seen reflected back at him before, Loki’s disdain for the mortal lessened when he saw this.
Steve began to breathe heavy and his eyes went dull, Bucky had seen that look on Steve’s face only two times in his life and now, a full century later he has the word for it. Panic Attack.
“So, what's the next step, Doc?” Bucky's sudden question startled Steve, he had expected Bucky to stay quiet around him like he had been.
Bucky Stood and extended his hand, he left it there in the pregnant (ha!) air between their bodies. Steve hesitantly reached out, and threaded his fingers into Bucky’s.
“OWW! What the fuck!” Well, that got him up. “what the hell was that for Steve?!” Tony said, his hand cradled to his chest. Steve just stood on the pillow and pulled a wing around to cover himself as he had been doing since he woke up.
"it's called molting Steve, when a bird or in your case someone with wings loses their feathers to make place for new ones to grow in." Bruce stares some more. "Can I examine them?" Steve shudders, but then asks where Bruce would like him and sits on a stool he pulls over.
“Stevie, there ain’t nothin’ out there that I haven’t seen or heard of already, the guys at the docks are always talking’ you know that.” Steve visibly deflates and crossed his arms over his chest.
“Good to see you are awake,” Tony had a icy outside but Steve could tell that he had been worried about him. Steve walked over to the glass and get a closer look at his clone.
“What the hell Tony, are you blind!” Clint dropped his bow and pointed to Loki like a little kid. “Can you not see the guy that tried to take over the world is sitting on your couch?”
“Are you completely stupid? Did the Hydra agents shrink your brain? That is still Steve, no matter the size and you have probably just earned yourself another 3 months of cleanup and butler's duty.” she looked over to Steve for confirmation he nodded, thought about it, and then held up four tiny fingers. “4 it is.” she said and then forcefully pushed him into the elevator before getting in herself so she can take advantage of his now forced servitude to her, and all the other avengers, but mostly her.
“Hi Tony, I know that Natasha is going to kidnap me the second that everyone finds out so I want to get that over with, I'll get some pants on and we can all go down to show the team.” Steve left the room and returned a few moments later in one of Tony’s pairs of sweatpants which fit better on her than Bucky’s but she had a different shirt of Bucky’s on, this one had a picture of the shield on the front. “Let's go.”
“Ok,” Tony ran his fingers through his hair again. “What do you think the Serum didn’t ‘cure’?” Steve turned a whole new shade of red and decided that the carpet beneath his feet was the most interesting thing in the world at that moment.
There was a collective gasp and both Natasha and Pepper caught each other's eye and then leaned in to discuss possible world ending plans.
Tony had his natural charisma that he always oozed for the public eye, he was obviously trying to take some of the spotlight from Steve, but the moment Steve stepped into view there was an uproar, some were cheering even louder and screaming, others were booing and cursing him. There was a group that tried to run up and mob him, but the security guards stepped in and escorted them out. This did not make Steve feel any more confident about his situation, he had to physically stop himself from throwing his wings up and recoiling from the world. luckily, Nat was quick to think and grabbed his wrist and pulled him away and out of his panic, half dragging him to the chair next to Tony then, she plopped herself down on the other side of him acting as a human barrier between him and the audience, he sent her a grateful look and sat down.
When he turns around in the mirror he is speechless, his mind comes to a screeching halt. His back was... moving? At first, he thought it was his muscles flexing with the effort to twist himself to see his back but this was so different from muscles. He turns back around to calm himself.
“Well, my chest is heavy,” Steve brought his hands up to cup his breasts through his shirt. There were twin groans next to him and he smiled but brought his hands back into his lap. “My pants are strangling my hips and it is weird having nothing between my legs. Other than that, the hair is long and gets everywhere,” he flicked his hair behind his shoulder and went back to speaking. “The wings are obviously different too; I've gotten so used to having them.”
“I am going to just check for overall injuries and maybe clean him up a bit but I will wait till we get back to medical to do anything further.” both Steve and Bucky nodded and Steve detached Tony from him so Bruce could get a better look at him. Bruce kept his face impassive as he cleaned and checked Tony over. From what he could see there was some likely fractured ribs and he didn’t even want to think of what else he would find when he did his examination back at the tower.
When Steve walked into the room, he was freshly showered but only had pants on and was wringing a piece of leather in his hands while pointedly not looking at Natasha.
"No. Calm down Steve, you are overthinking this, get your head together and come up with a solution like you always do.” He said to himself attempting to sound confident, but failing miserably.
It had been a few days from when he first noticed Steve going into Bruce's part of the lab every other day and coming out of it a few hours later with a grim expression on his face. He no longer wore the skin-tight running shirts he seemed so fond of, instead he wore nothing but baggy sweatshirts. he was also being reclusive, not participating in team bonding, preferring to slink off to his floor and not come out unless there was a mission or something equally important.
“Jarvis raise the platform.” Tony's voice cut over the muttering Avengers. The platform began to rise out of the floor it was sometimes used for training with obstacles, but the other smaller platforms didn’t rise, not fully at least, they created a ramp for him to run up and jump off of.
“I know you want it, you always wanted it, but never let yourself have it, only once. It’s a shame…” Rogers trailed off and watched as Steven flashed back to that night
“Move” he gasped out. Steve pulled out and thrust in again experimentally once and then twice, he started a rhythm that had Tony making the BEST noises. When Tony opened his eyes, he thought he had died and went to heaven, Steve’s wings were spread out, the golden undersides shone and the low light was creating a halo on the blonds hair, he looked like the best thing in the word and then some. Steve’s thrusts were starting to speed up and get more frantic. A large hand wrapped around Tony’s aching cock and in half a dozen pulls he was coming all over Steve’s hand and his stomach. Steve sped up his frantic thrusting, pushing in once, twice more, then spilled into Tony. Tony felt himself stretching further, and further, he tried to squirm away, but Steve held him there and, Oh my god! Steve was STILL coming. Once Steve had come back to himself he leaned in and kissed Tony then tried to pull away, causing both men to let out a pained noise.
After a little while Bucky relaxed further against Tony and he dared to speak again, though he still kept his voice low.
When Tony made it out to the room, he saw Steve lounging on the couch while reading a book and Bucky in the kitchen trying to make it look like he was doing something and not just staring at Steve, his wings were up and fanning the air lightly as he stood behind the counter. Steve turned around and realized why Bucky was acting so weird.
“And this is the hard part,” Pepper and Nat shared a look and pulled off Steve’s shirt and looked up and down her body before she could cover herself with her hands.
“I'll give you some privacy, if you need anything you know how to reach me.” with that Bruce gathered all his stuff and exited the room, making sure to close the door behind him.
another rather fast chapter, i have my AP US History test on Friday so i have been procrastinating by writing about Steve and his adventures as a girl. i hope you enjoy! as usual tell me what i think and leave kudos.
“If you think that was bad you won’t survive the ‘full work up’ you are going to get.” Steve walked into the room with some chips and set them down in the coffee table before he plopped down on the other side of Tony. He leaned over with his arms on his knees and his head in his hands. His wings drooped falling over the couch and onto the floor.
“And I'm here too” Both men jump at the sudden addition to their little world. “Yeah, I saw enough.” Tony makes his way over and sits next to his lovers and takes one of Steve's hands in his. “Steve, I love you. We both love you. Nothing you say will change that. It hurts me to see you hurting and I would put good money on it that Bucky feels the same.” he glances at the other and he nods his head in agreement. “You can tell us anything.”
"I know it's probably nothing but my back was bothering me, if it wasn't for the serum I wouldn't have come.”
“STEVE!!” That was Tony's voice coming from beyond the wall of feathers. A hand grazed the outside of his wings and he pulled them closer to himself.
“Let's wait until next time when everyone is settled down and then we can research how and why these things do what they do,” Bruce looked down at his feet sheepishly and nodded to Tony.
“Very well, if that is all I will be back to my rooms.” Loki popped out of the room before anyone could say anything and with that everyone sat silently for a little while before leaving to their own floors to get some rest.
When Tony finally calmed down, he seemed to snap back into reality and began frantically checking Steve’s body for injuries, going as far as to pull at his shirt, almost ripping it in his haste. Steve caught his hands and untangled his fists from the material.
“firstly,I am not your Brother. And no, it was not my hand that changed them. I am the one that tried to reverse the effects those puny mortals did.” Loki didn’t look angry like his tone suggested, rather he looked...annoyed by the problems caused. “Because they had no knowledge of magics of any kind they made it impossible to reverse the effects fully, I was however able to cure Stark of his ailment by transferring it to the Captain. Due to the nature of it though I don’t know everything I would like to know about how it will act and if it will have any lasting effects on either of you.”
“I need you to lay across the couch so I have access to your whole body. This may take a while so I suggest that you get comfortable.” Steve moved to the couch and sat on the middle cushion before swinging his legs up and laying across it lengthwise. He wasn’t sure what to do with his hands so he folded them over his stomach, Loki tutted at him.
He set out the clothes he deemed ok to wear for the day and started doing push-ups, pull-ups, and other exercises he could do in his room. When he finished he put on the large sweatshirt and sweatpants he set out, but found yet another problem. Although the wings were covered they only covered the tops. His wings were almost as tall as he was and would drag on the floor if he didn't hold them up. In his anger his wings fluffed up and spread fully, his shirt was ripped to shreds.
“me neither, It looks like we will be going on a shopping trip,” Pepper called back to Nat as she returned with another piece of fabric in her hands.
“that good huh?” Steve repeated what Tony had said to him yesterday with a grin in his face. Tony leaned up to kiss him licking into his mouth and tasting himself there.
When Tony woke for the second time, he was moved into a different room. He was still naked but this time he was in the center of the room on his hands and knees, he was strapped to another thing, his legs were spread apart obscenely and his pelvis was held up by a pedestal that his body was draped over, his arms were tied to the legs of the pedestal and his face was pressed to the cement floor. He knew what this was but, he still couldn’t believe what was happening to him. His ass was wet with what he hoped was lube and there were HYDRA men all around him, they quieted when they noticed that he was awake, soon after someone stepped up. He walked over to Tony gazing down at him with predatory eyes, he crouched down and ripped Tony’s head up by his hair. Tony let out a pained hiss and the man chuckled at his pained sound.
“I think I found Tony.” Steve jumped up so fast he fell over because his legs got caught in the blanket that Bucky had draped over him while he slept.
"Take your shirt and the harness off, then stand in the middle there." Bruce points to the open area. "I want to get a better look at just how much wing you have, so if you would please extend your wings out as far as you can." Steve slowly unfolded his wings off his back and spread them gradually wider and wider until they were fully spread.
“Shh, yeah, it’s me. We are going to get you out of here now.” Tony curled into Steve, and Steve for the first time picked up on the sounds of a fight coming through his comm, that meant that at some point the team had gotten there and were now fighting their way through the rest of the base to find Tony and Steve.
“What do you care? I highly doubt that you worry for our well-being.” Steve did a double take on what Bucky said. He was right, Loki had no reason to be worried for them. Something was up.
“I need access to your entire body. You can place your hands on the sides of your body, you may find it soothing to hold the furs under you.” Steve moved his hands and buried his fingers in the odd fur below him, Loki nodded to himself and then hovered his hands about an inch from Steve’s skin. He worked from the top of Steve’s head and gradually moved down his body, the strange feeling of static tickled his skin where green mist flowed between Loki’s hands and his body.
Everything goes white and when Tony comes back to himself Steve is draped over his chest, passed out with an arm slung protectively over Tony.
When Bucky moved Tony so he could clean him he wanted to vomit, and when he opened Tony’s legs, he barely reacted only whimpering a little and curling into Steve’s chest a little bit more. After he had cleaned him as best he could Bucky finished dressing Tony and stood to call Bruce over. Steve was still kind of protective, keeping Tony covered by his wings but eventually let Bruce get close enough to check Tony out. Bucky knew that Bruce likely understood why Steve was so protective and that they needed clothes, he wasn’t stupid and had likely deduced what happened but he could see the tensing of his shoulders as he saw the state that Tony was in. even with the clothes hiding the worst of it you could still see the marks on his throat and wrists, his face had been hit against the floor he had crusted blood on his head, his lip was split and his eyes were swollen from crying. He was clinging to Steve even in his unconscious state, his ear was pressed to Steve’s chest and his bloodied hands gripped Steve like he was the only thing keeping him up.
“What?” Steve sniffled and reached a hand to rub the place here his wings would normally rest against his back.
“He’s gonna be ok, he’ll be fine. His sugar probably got too low or something like that.” Tony quietly soothed Bucky with placating words and drawing his fingers through his soft hair and equally soft feathers and Bucky buried his head into Tony’s neck.
“You said that I could help next time, Please Mr. Stark?” Tony tried to remain stern but Peter was giving him those puppy dog eyes (he must be getting secret lessons from Steve).
“‘M’kay, I'm good.” Tony watched Steve’s face as Bucky pulled out and then pushed back in, the expressions on his face was changing so fast Tony couldn’t read them before they changed, but by the way Steve’s cock twitched in Tony’s ass meant that at least one of them was pleasure. Bucky put his hands on Steve’s hips and thrust in a little harder this time, the force pushed Steve into Tony and then they all were moving together. Bucky thrust into Steve and in turn Steve thrust into Tony, Tony loved watching Steve’s face as he got taken by Bucky and the feeling of Steve’s arousal inside of him was the cherry on top.
“I have a feeling you guys are going to have a lot to talk about, so i will let you go, but I am going to want a full work up when I get back.” And with that he hung up.
Steve walked them into the bathroom where Jarvis had started the shower already. The water was the perfect temperature as Steve set him down under the spray. He tilted his head back to get his hair wet, Steve chose this moment to darken the bruises he had left last night on Tony’s neck and collar. Tony was pushed under the spray fully and Steve followed him trailing kisses to his mouth where he playfully nipped at Tony’s lip and deepened the kiss licking into the wet cavern of Tony’s mouth. Suddenly Tony was no longer warm from the constant water showering on them the sounds of water falling was muted and sounded far away, he reluctantly broke the kiss and looked around. Steve’s wings had encircled him again and was acting as an umbrella for him, keeping the water off of him. Steve’s face was red in embarrassment.
Tony finished his coffee and set the mug on the table turning to look at Steve, his eyes narrowed and Steve could see as his brain worked to figure out what was wrong.
"I know how it feels... when I woke up in that, that cave, in Afghanistan with a car battery in my chest I thought I was in hell, I thought I would be tortured for all eternity. penance for my crimes, Did you know they called me the merchant of death? Yeah, my weapons caused so much pain and suffering. I still have days where I think about just ripping this out of my chest." He taps on the glass of the arc reactor. "Will you please come down now? You don't have to see me if you don't want to but I'm here for you if you need it." soon there is some shuffling (and flapping) on the other side for the line.
“Where do you think you are going? I know you want it, just admit that you want it and we’ll give it to you.” Steven bowed his head and shook it slightly but remained silent. “If you are so stubborn on this, than explain Jack.” Steven flinched at the name and Tony must be worried because Steven heard him take a step towards them but he didn’t make any more advances and decided to see what happened.
Once they got to the tower and Tony was in a bed getting looked at by Bruce and the medical staff. it became clear that this was more than the doctors could handle.
“also... I need to know if we are going to go public with our relationship. The team needs to know what they can and cannot say....” Tony trailed off and wouldn’t look Steve in the eyes. Steve thought about what to say for a bit.
“Why didn’t you wake me the minute you found it! He's with HYDRA! Probably hurting or even d-” Steve cut off and crumpled to the floor. Bucky got off of the couch and sat in the floor next to Steve pulling him into his arms and pulling his good wing around him, the other was still healing from the burns he got in the fight but most of the feathers were back they just had to grow in a bit till he could fly again.
Tony curls long, deft, fingers around Steve’s cock. Steve is so wet with precome that there is no need for slick. Tony strokes Steve is time with Steve’s movements over Tony’s body. Steve lets a high-pitched whine and then he is pushing down on Tony’s length one last time, unable to lift himself again Steve grinds his ass on Tony’s pelvis as Tony jacks Steve’s dick at an increasing rate. Steve is letting out little breathy ‘oh, oh, oh,’ noises and that is when Tony swipes his thumb over Steve’s cock head and Steve shoots off for the second time.
"Hey Steve, I heard you had a bad day. are you ok?" Bruce had never heard Tony sound so soft before.
“I'm in. No one so far, but I’m guessing there will be soon.” Steve whispered back as he slowly walked down the hall, Shield in his hand ready to go. The first corner had guards posted around a door, they were talking about some party where apparently Jerry had got drunk and drove his car into a pool. Steve rolled his eyes and slipped by without their knowing. He made it to the control room where all the camera feeds were shown on screens, he took out the guard with a hit to the back of the head and started searching the feeds for Tony.
“You can land now, I think I am done for today, I'll have a recommended food list to complete with the enhanced metabolism and likely some pills to help counteract the drugs they had you on by tomorrow.” Bucky nodded and Bruce left them to go back to his lab.
“I don’t think we can reverse engineer the ray guns, Tony.” Bruce told him for the 50th time. “It will probably wear off in a week or so, Hydra isn't exactly known for being the most reliable in building tech, and coupled with the serum Steve should be fine.” Tony looked up a Bruce, he had a hand on his shoulder, Steve fast asleep on a small cushion in his other hand.
“Please.” his voice was small and strained. He crouched between Bucky’s thighs like earlier and pulled off his borrowed sweatpants. Bucky’s cock sprung out and Tony could see the place at the base where he would get a knot, he made a mental note to tell Bruce the new information. He had found that with Steve it was incredibly painful to pop a knot on nothing so he would have to hold the knot the whole time Bucky ended up coming. luckily, Tony had found a way to get Steve off without causing him to knot, which had come in handy when he was blowing him or giving him a hand-job. Steve said that being able to knot Tony felt the best, but after 70 years of not even getting an erection Tony didn't think that this would last long anyway.
Pepper pushed ahead into the closet and began rummaging around and gathering a rather large pile of clothes before Nat stepped in Steve’s view and began reaching for her shirt again like she had on the elevator. Steve squeaked and grabbed the hem of the shirt to keep it down. Natasha glared at her and then huffed out a sigh that sent a strand of her loose red hair flying.
this chapter comes directly after chapter 4, chapter 5 was a throwback to show how Tony and Rogers got in the position Steven found them in.
Bucky went back to the workshop, after wrestling Steve into a horizontal position on the couch and gave him a shower and a meal replacement drink. He went over to Tony’s desk, on it there were a million papers everywhere, notes scribbled in Tony’s familiar chicken scratch. Bucky put his hands on the desk and lowered his head, he needed to find Tony.
“My friends, I have come to Midguard seeking my Brother. Heimdal has told me that he had come to you in seek of refuge from my father in return for his aid in the mystic arts.” there is a flash of green and then Loki is standing to the side of the roof in his full armor.
“I found some of Rhode's old shorts and I have a sweatshirt that I stole from him that should fit you- oh! Sorry, I'll just set them here.” Steven was surprised that he hadn’t slipped and cracked his head open from how much he had jumped at Tony’s sudden appearance. Steven was sure that Tony hadn’t seen him and was just reacting to the sudden image of Steven in the shower. Steven pointedly cleans the rest of himself with spartan efficiency and gets out of the wonderful warmth, the door is closed so the steam swirls around trapped in the room with him. on the counter sits a pair of shorts and an old well-worn M.I.T sweatshirt under it sits a large plush cream towel that Steven wraps around himself protectively and just stands of a minute, feeling as the wisps of warm, moist air flood his lungs.
Rogers kissed and sucked his way up and down Tony’s neck to end at his ear, he suckled at the lobe before letting go so he could whisper into his ear again.
“Buck? Why didn’t you tell me or one of the medics that you were hurt? We could have helped.” Bucky didn’t look at Steve he kept his head lowered between his shoulders and stared at the floor. Tony got up and rounded the bed again, he crouched and caught Bucky's eye before he spoke.
When the Soldier awoke, he was in a bed. quickly he scoped the room looking for the exits and possible weapons when his eyes found the man with the wings, like him. but. not. He was curled up in a chair that couldn’t be comfortable, one wing pulled over him like a blanket and the other was propping his head up on the joint like a pillow.
“Well, now we know what type you like,” pepper gathered up the rest of the panties and put them back before opening the drawer that Steve assumed had the underwear that was most like the ones she had picked out. “Nat, come here for a second…”  there was a lot of whispering and a few excited giggles before Steve saw what they had brought.
Even though he kept count of every hit of Rogers’ hand on his ass he did not know how many times that large hand came down on his raw backside.
Tony wasn’t sure how long he had been in the dirty cell but from the ache in his stomach it had to be at least a few days, he knew that Steve and the others were looking for him but he wasn’t sure they would find him while he was still... well, him. He didn’t feel any different at first but as time crawled on, he began to feel hot, he was sweating on the cold metal table and it made no sense. It kind of did when he factored in that he had been shot up with some crazy scientist guys wing serum 2.0 but, this wasn’t like how Steve had described it. But that was it, wasn’t it, he didn’t get the same thing that Steve and Bucky got, he got an unknown formula that had likely never been tested before and he didn’t think his already weak heart could take it. Shivers wracked his body and his head felt like it was stuffed with cotton, he could feel himself fading from consciousness but he couldn’t do anything about it.
“So, you are saying that I had big tits before the reactor? Ha! I knew it!” Bruce pinched the bridge of his nose but Steve could see that he was trying to hide a smile.
“I am personally more interested in how you managed to acquire those,” Loki pointed to where his wings were keeping him in the air. “from what I am aware, Midgardians do not have such appendages except you and one other, just like you captain, is it a- how does that saying go again? OH yes. A forties thing?”
“Oh, you like that idea. well, it’s not much of a punishment if you like it now, is it?” Tony heard as Rogers set something down and walked back up behind him, pressing against his back and speaking directly in his ear. “I guess I'll have to do something else for your punishment.” a shiver ran down Tony’s spine at Rogers’ words.
"'J' I'm worried about him," his voice caught in his throat. "can you please tell me he's ok? Maybe bring up his stats?"
“I was planning on having some fun with you, but it looks like you lost that privilege, instead you get a punishment and maybe then if you are good I'll let you suck me off like the good little slut you are.” Tony groaned at the steel in Rogers’ tone his cock gave an interested twitch in the tight confines of his workshop jeans, he tried to get some relief by rubbing against the side of the bed but was caught off guard by a large hand coming down hard across his ass.
please leave comments and kudos, tell me what you think or if you have ideas on what you might like to see happen next!
“Well, are you gonna tell me what's got your shield in a twist or am I gonna have to pull it out of you?” Steve didn’t seem to be willing to talk, but Bucky knew better, the best weapon against Steve is himself, leave him alone in a room with just his mind and he will tell you anything you want to get out.
“You are going to feel so good, all open and slick for me.” he leaned down and captured her lips in a dirty kiss, the taste of her pleasure shared between them.
“Oh my god, that was so embarrassing!” Steve said to Tony after Bruce hung up. Tony was sitting on the couch tapping away at his phone and Steve was in the kitchen getting some snacks.
“Can I get a shower?” Steven is blushing, but Tony guesses that he should have thought of that when he first saw Steven and the leftover sandwich pieces on him and what looked like mayonnaise on his sweatpants.
“I mean, finish what we started yesterday.” Tony's eyes had that hopeful glint to them, Steve melted.
Tony lifted his arms but, hesitated before he touched. “I am going to touch your wings now, is that OK?” Bucky nodded into his shoulder and his hitching Breaths rattled his whole body where it was pressed against Tony's. Tony reached up and stroked the under feathers of Bucky’s wings, slowly he moved to the spot that got Steve boneless every time Tony would pet him there. Bucky let out a happy hum and relaxed slightly, his hold on Tony’s shirt released and the neckline of Tony’s shirt dropped away from where it had been pressed to his neck.
Tony was woken by screaming in the kitchen. He slid out of the ball of feathers and arms that were wrapped around him, and groggily stumbled out of his room to see what all the chaos in his kitchen was about.
“No Steve, you really don’t. Bruce already knows and now I know, Thor is off in fairyland, Natasha could care less and Clint will probably try to ride on your back but we can deal with him later. We are your family Steve, you don’t have to hide. This doesn’t make you any less of a person, and that’s what you are Steve, a PERSON. You don’t have to be our big, strong, fearless leader all the time. you can take a break from Captain America and just be you.” Tony was holding Steve’s jaw in his hand, his thumb rubbing at his cheek. He kept eye contact trying his best to convey all the love and acceptance he could. Steve gave Tony a sad smile and pressed his lips to his for another kiss.
Steve’s chest was heaving with the effort to breathe through his words, it felt like back when he had Asthma and would get an attack when someone smelled too much like cigarettes. Bucky pulled Steve into his chest and Steve sobbed into his shirt. Tony pushed up behind Steve in an awkward hug that was more around his hips and stomach because of their bodies, but it felt so good to Steve. To be surrounded by the people that he loves, that love him. They sat like that for a while, just holding each other. Bucky’s Dark wings wrapped around them all.
Once he obtained the coffee he walked over to the couch and promptly sat on Steve’s lap, content to watch the Tv and sip his coffee where he was, like it was the most normal thing in the universe.
The shirt was plain, dark grey with a Stark Industries logo in the front, the real reason it was for Steve was the back, there were two zippers running lengthwise down the back over the shoulder blades, when they were unzipped they would allow Steve’s wings through.
“Well, that could have been bad” Steve tried to laugh it off but, when he raised his head to see the likely humor on Tony and Bucky’s faces, he instead found Bucky standing in front of Tony and using his wings to gently nudge him back away from Steve like he was a feral animal. “Buck? Hey pal, what's going on?” Bucky’s eyes remained on Steve and as far as Steve could tell he was looking at him like an enemy before a kill. In the blink of an eye Bucky’s wings fly up and spread wide, not only shaking out a large amount of flour but shielding Tony from view.
"Seconded." Bruce replied from under the blanket he was using to cover his modesty. Tony still hasn't perfected his Super Stretchy Hulk Pants™ so the blankets plentifully stored in the jet worked fine.
“SHit, shit, SHIT!” there was a loud clicking before the window opened up and the slime slid out over his boots and up to about his calf. Steve cringed at the strange feeling and stepped out of the growing pile on the floor.
“I have you on a hormone stabilizer that should help with the aggression and hopefully the arousal.”
It happens before Steve can process what is going on, all the sudden he is in excruciating pain. It feels like he is being ripped in half and then he falls to the floor gasping for breath and groaning he hears the sound of the repulsors and a shout from the man then a thump of a body hitting the floor across the room.
Tony was worried, After Afghanistan he had displayed similar actions and he is no professional but, it took Pepper finding him half dead on his bathroom floor and 4 different psychologists to get him out of his funk. He most definitely did not want to end up with a Suicidal super Soldier on his hands.
“You're right,” Bruce took off his gloves and threw them in the trash before he pinched his nose with one hand and rested his elbow in the other. “There are no foreign bodies in his blood that I can find, the only thing that is wrong is his hormones are completely out of whack, he has extremely high progesterone and his vitamin C is very low along with his vitamin D. From what I can tell the fainting may be of low iron levels, or more likely it is a symptom of the whole magic thing.” Bruce threw his hands in the air in a motion of defeat and let them fall back to his sides.
Rogers pushed Tony's legs and Tony lifted his right leg so Rogers could slip a leg between his and fully press themselves together under the warmth of the blankets.
“Too, too many clothes…” Steve moaned out between kisses, she had rucked Bucky’s shirt up and was pushing at it where it pooled under his arms. Bucky chuckled at her impatience.
“Clint and Nat, go to S.H.I.E.L.D and ask Coulson about how to contact Thor.” The two agents stalked out of the med bay with a determined look on their faces, Steve knew that they wouldn’t return until they had Thor with them. Steve turned to Bucky, now slightly behind him and with his back to the wall, defensive and scanning for danger.
“Sure.” Tony walked over to the table where Peter had all his stuff set out but when he sat, he winced.
"No! Don't want them to know" Steve shouted his voice wavered and cracked from when Bruce's earlier attempts had resulted in tears.
2 hours later the bathroom was clean, and he was able to step under the shower to finally clean himself up. A hiss left his mouth when the first current of water hits his back.
They exited the store a few hours later, Steve feeling more exposed than she did when she was fully naked, the bra she had on now was wearing a rose-pink bra that was a soft velvet fabric that held her better that Nat's old sports bra.
He circled the building a few times and then came back to the roof, he saw a figure standing by the doors and assumed that it was Bucky or maybe one of the team, he landed and soon saw that it wasn’t.
, going where she wanted him most. His lips circled her clit and his tongue stroked her, his fingers found her hole and entered her, crooking up to find that secret spot inside of her. She felt his mouth twitch into a smile when she flinched, her legs twitching around his ears as his fingers ran over her spot. He then started licking her like his life depended on it and fucked into her with his fingers, Steve couldn’t believe the feeling, it was so consuming, her legs were shaking and she couldn’t remember her own name. Then Tony hummed.
When he arrived Tony and Bucky were in the middle of what looked like a food fight with the flour, they were both laughing and Tony had so much flour in his hair he looked like he had white hair, the look contrasted with the youthful glee plastered on his face. His eyes caught Steve in the doorway and waved him in to the kitchen.
so, this chapter was a way to show Steve and Bucky's relationship before the whole ice and Hydra and wing stuff, this chapter sits as a flashback and to show the general rolls of Steve in their relationship and how he may have issues with his urges now that they have changed. hopefully this will shed some light on how Steve feels.
Once Steve came down from his pampered high, he sat up and had a guilty look on his face, Bucky and Tony shared a look over his shoulder and they knew that it was time to talk.
Steve couldn't wait for the team to go. He had taken all of 3 minutes to listen to Tony tell him about the camera in DC that had seen the Winter Soldier after a mission to eliminate a judge who was working against Hydra’s wishes and he flew low enough to be caught by the cellphone of a teenager who was videoing their friend skateboarding down a hill into a dumpster, before he threw on his suit and took off towards DC at top speed, which luckily for him was about 80 Mph and with the wind currents help he got there in about 1.5 hours.
“So, what can science tell us so far?" Tony didn't let him answer, and just kept talking. "Given the look on your face and the fact that Loki looks like he is making a sacrifice to the sun god over there I don’t think it's much.” Tony jabbed a thumb over his shoulder at Loki, he was now sitting in a sigil painted circle with the crystal bowl in his lap and books floating around him with green mist keeping them aloft while he read at superhuman speeds.
“It's just me, Tony. Do you remember me? I am the one who cleans Steve’s wings?” Tony kept his voice low and made sure to telegraph every movement he made so not to startle him. Bucky’s eyes softened a fraction and his body went ramrod straight. Then he deflated like a balloon. In a blink of an eye, he had leapt at Tony, not being able to react fast enough Tony fell back into a sitting position and stayed still as Bucky hugged him, Bucky was crying into Tony’s shoulder and his wings had lowered to cover the both of them, it was just like how Steve did it, but it was so very different at the same time, Bucky smelled like leather and sun and something slightly sweet that Tony couldn't name where as Steve smelled like warm blankets and a meadow in the forest on a spring afternoon. Another difference was the color, Steve’s golden under feathers shined like- well, gold, even with the small amount of light that leaked through his feathers when he embraced Tony like this they reflected light and it was bright in Steve’s arms, but with Bucky his wings weren’t reflective they were dark and they let in very little light, it felt like being in a warm bath and closing your eyes to just let your body be cocooned in the warm water.
Steve’s mind was swirling with everything, he didn’t notice Bucky flying up and landing next to him until a dark wing grazed his back in an effort to comfort the now trembling man, who looked a second away from tipping off the ledge of the small beam.
Bruce and Loki were huddled around Steve’s still unconscious body when Tony arrived in the medical bay. Bucky quickly stalked over to him and Tony hugged the worried soldier.
“You are really something else,” the robot made a happy noise and did a little circle around the desk. “Thanks for the cleaning, but I need to go find Tony.” The robot made another noise and raced its way back to what looked like a little house that was its charging port. Bucky got up shaking his head at the spunky little robot and got to work where Steve left off.
“Clothes first, only Bucky.” his reply was sharp and he continued watching Bruce where he stood by the door as Bucky slowly crept closer with the clothes. Steve turned himself and Tony so that he had his back to Bruce and was fully shielding the smaller man's body with his.
“Now I am going to oil them, the oil keeps the feathers healthy and helps with waterproofing. The oil comes from a gland at the base of your wing and to get it out I have to massage the gland, I am not sure how it will feel to you, but Steve loves it so don't worry, and if you ever need me to stop for one reason or another just shake your head no or I don't know.. Reach back and touch my leg or something,” Bucky ducked his head again and Tony got to work.
He hobbled over to the blanket pulling it around his shoulders and laid down, trying to imagine he wasn’t here in this cold cell alone, He was in bed with Steve and Bucky and the blanket wasn’t a blanket it was their wings, wrapped protectively around him as he slept peacefully between the two of them.
When the rest of the droids were taken out Thor and hulk helped the team transport the cages onto the Shield craft to be taken care of in their labs.
When the reach their floor Bucky sets Steve down on the couch and they both take seats near him. Steve looks down at his lap for a while before he says anything.
Sorry it took so long to get this chapter out I have never written something like this before and it took a while to figure out where I wanted to go with this thanks for waiting and I hope you enjoy!
“Have you never had a erection before?” Tony asked and saw the answer on Bucky’s face before he could shake his head “It's ok. Its the natural way that your body reacts when you feel really, really good. Now, I am going to assume that you don't know how to deal with it if you have never had one,” Bucky shook his head again. “Would you like me to help you?”
He followed the trail of love bites down again and this time kissed and licked the scar tissue surrounding the reactor, making sure to make the meaning of his words known. Then he moved down even further. He sucked a bruise into the dip in his left hip, kissed all around his thighs, everywhere except for the one place he wanted him. At this point Tony was writhing under Steve and thrusting up into nothing Steve held his hips down and gave the tip a little kitten lick. Tony just about came from only that. Steve licked him from base to tip, then took the head into his mouth and sucked. Tony had to close his eyes. The view of Captain America sucking him off was almost too much. His lips stretched around the head of his cock, cheeks hollowed and his pupils blown wide, the blue of his eyes barely visible anymore, looking up at him from under those long lashes. Steve chose that moment to bob his head and take Tony fully in the warmth of his mouth. Tony’s fingers tangled in his blond hair and Steve moaned, the vibrations traveled through Tony’s dick and made him gasp.
“Hey. Hey, Steve. Its ok. I’m fine, in fact I liked it.” Steve’s eyes were looking wet and he was doing that thing where he turns into a kicked puppy.
Bucky continued to map out her body with his hands, flesh and metal alike. Drawing his hands up he caressed the swell of Steve’s breasts. She gasped out a whine and Tony drowsily opened his eyes and when he realized what was happening, he looked at the two of them his signature grin.
“Yeah I did. I know you’ll love it, now open it.” Steve pulled the paper away to show a brand-new sketchbook and a set of pencils. Steve took a shocked inhale of air and picked up the book, flipping through the blank pages and feeling them with those long fingers of his, Bucky took another swallow of the whiskey to force his focus away from Steve’s hands.
Without warning Tony got up off of Steve’s lap and pulled Steve to follow into the bedroom with him, Tony sat Steve on the bed and left to go into the bathroom where Steve heard him turn on the water. Steve was thoroughly confused by the time Tony returned with a basin of water and some towels. Tony climbed into the bed behind Steve and it clicked, Tony was going to wash his wings. Steve hadn’t gotten them cleaned since before the battle so they needed it. Steve felt tears in his eyes, Tony was too good for him. Here he was, worried about how Steve’s wings are doing and willing to wash them for him after all the grief Steve had caused him in the past two days.
Steve started to hyperventilate, he felt like when he would have an asthma attack and couldn’t get his wind back.
“You really should get some sleep, Tony,” Bruce’s hand rested on his shoulder, and he nearly dropped the soldering iron he was using. “You are no good to anyone if you aren't rested.”
First, there was a spike in Steven’s heart and breathing rate, but they weren’t too out of range, so he silenced the alarm and went back to work. When he saw the flashing, red happen on Rogers’ box he knew something was wrong.
As if reading her mind Tony began rubbing Steve’s slit through her panties. She writhed and moaned under the attention of both men. Bucky took her other nipple in between his metal fingers and twisted, the cool metal contrasting with the boiling heat inside her, she arched her back off the bed and Bucky grinned. He moved his mouth up to suck and kiss her neck while his hands cupped and squeezed her breasts.
“S-Steve, this isn’t you. It's just that slime. You don’t want this. Come on big guy, let me up we need to get you back to the jet-”
Tony’s world shifted as he was thrown against the bed. His shins hit the bed frame and he hissed out in pain, but then Rogers’ large hand came down on the back of his neck and pushed his face into the blanket. Tony pushed his ass out further and he felt Rogers rub against him, the hot length of his erection dragged against his entrance and Tony moaned into the bedclothes. With one hand on the back of his neck and the other holding Tony’s hands behind his back Rogers hand him right where he wanted him.
“He is no fun. Why don’t you come in here and I’ll show you a good time~” The other him sneered at Steve and continued flirting with Tony from his place in the cell. “Better yet, let me out and we can go wherever you want.” Tony had his back to Steve so he couldn’t see his expression but he could tell that his body language was stiff and he made no effort to look at either of them, even when he answered.
there you go! some presenting and a fight over Tony as a mate, poor Tony what is he going to do with these two bull headed men who love him. please comment and leave kudos below!
happened at the lab? he hasn't been himself since then and if he needs your help it has to be serious. I need to know Bruce, this is affecting the team."
Bucky glances over and finds that Tony is almost done so he finishes up and then cleans up the supplies they used while Steve sinks back into the couch.
“Hey, he probably has about the entire of Fifth Ave bought and on express shipment to the tower, he won’t mind and anything that you don’t like or use can be donated.” Steve nodded and relaxed back into the cool leather of the seat, closing her eyes as they drove back to the Tower.
“I hope you are feeling better,” the soldier did not reply, he wasn’t to reply unless directly asked a question. He pulled his body away from the man and moved towards the door. “I know that you don’t remember me but, we are friends,” the man continued “I won’t let anyone hurt you anymore, you are safe now.” The soldier did not know how to act, never before had someone acted towards him this way, he was a weapon and weapons don’t get treated kindly, they get used.
“Ouch.” A groan left Tony as he pushed himself up on his elbows. He came face to face with Steve and laughed at the Stupid look in his face.
Steve starts to get ready for Tony. He takes his harness off as well as his shirt and sits down on his bed cross-legged while beginning the grooming of his inner wings. His heart is racing in his chest. What if Tony hates him? What if he is disgusted? Just thinking about losing Tony makes his throat dry with fear. He starts doing some new breathing techniques Tony had shown to keep his anxiety in check.
Steve found Tony in his garage bent over one of his many cars, music blasting over the speakers. The volume lowered when he walked in and Tony looked up from where he was working. He looked delicious, his hair messy and spiked up randomly where he had been running his hands through it, He had oil stains all over him. A particular smudge across his cheek caught Steve’s eye. There was a rag that had seen better days sticking out of his black jeans that had Steve’s mouth watering.
“Thank you. For… everything, you are a good person, Loki. I am proud to call you my friend. You have done so much for all of us.” Steve finally turned to Loki and caught a flash of something he couldn't quite put words to what emotion was on his face but then god broke out his patented grin.
For the next week Steven was able to keep out of Rogers’ way for the most part, there were instances where he was in the common rooms and he would catch his eye but he was soon to leave.
He should contact Bruce like he was supposed to if it got worse, but Bruce was halfway around the world working with patients in the jungle somewhere without a phone so that option was out. He finally decided to try to ride it out, if anything happens Jarvis will contact the others. Just to be safe he tells Jarvis to contact the team if he passes out or something of the like and gets up to look at his back.
“Is he sure? I don’t want him to rush himself because he feels he owes it to me or something else.” after a silence Jarvis doesn’t answer, just opens the elevator and Tony steps inside.
tell me below what gender and name you think the baby should have. will they be Bucky's little girl or a Tony's Mini-Me?
“I know, but without him Tony is going to die.” Bucky held Steve’s gaze for a second longer and then he dropped his eyes to Tony’s still form on the bed, he then looked at Steve again and nodded.
“Come in Cap, just try,” Clint pleaded with the stubborn man. Steve rolled his eyes pulled the remains of his shirt off and opened his wings, gave them two beats and wrapped them around himself again.
“The energy signature appears to be Asgardian.” Tony turned to Peter who was patiently waiting with his legs crossed in thinly veiled excitement.
“I know you are like 100 years old, but you shouldn’t be falling when you make sandwiches, and you are clearly hurting!” Tony gestured to where Steven’s fingers had cracked the marble counter where he was clutching it out if pain. “I know you won’t go to medical, at least come to the penthouse with me so I can make sure you don't concuss yourself with a jar of mayo next time, ok?” Steven knew that Tony wouldn’t let this go and he was honestly worried about what might happen if Rogers came back and Tony was here so he nodded and followed Tony to the elevator, he felt a warm sensation in his ass and he prayed that is was only Rogers’ cum and not blood, from the way he hurt though it seemed not likely.
“Hey Tony...” Steve trailed off, not sure what to say to the man that he loved and had ditched for the better part of the week not even thinking about how that made Tony feel. Steve knew that Tony had anxiety and issues With his self-worth to the people who he loved and that made him feel even worse, he felt no better than those Hydra fucks who used Bucky for their own gain and then wiped and froze him when they were finished, “um, I was wondering if I could get your help... with Bucky's wings. You see he needs them groomed and I can’t do mine, so I don’t exactly know what to do, so I thought that maybe you could do it or show me how if you don’t want to and then I realized that I have been neglecting you since Bucky came back and I'm sorry Tony, so, so sorry that I let myself forget about you, you are so important to me and if you’ll still have me I would like to talk with you after and maybe, I don’t know... Cuddle on the couch with my Boyfriend? I really miss you.” Steve’s rambling caught Tony off guard. Normally it was him who would burst out with random thoughts, he blinked at Steve for a moment and could see him visibly deflating, his wings that were pulled tight to his body with fear and guilt began to sag to the floor.
The chair had an odd back and he had to drape his wings around the back of it so his feathers didn’t get messed up. He turned to the host, who had a worried look on his face, but he then slid an impeccable mask of extreme happiness and turned to the audience and introduced them by name. (what for Steve had no clue, but he put his press smile on and went along, mostly trying to keep his wings from ruffling or thwacking open, again)
before he could say anything, Tony was up and crawling across the bed to sit between Steven’s thighs. Steven was still a little fuzzy from his orgasm, but he registered Tony rubbing his legs through his pants and his cock made a painful twitch at the idea of Tony between his thighs. Rogers walked around the bed to them and had Tony sit back as he pulled off Steven’s clothes and left his completely naked on the bed. Tony crawled back up between his legs and resumed his sensual rubbing of Steven’s body, Steven could feel his cock fulling and his ears burned at the thought of Tony seeing him like this.
She walked with purpose over to the soldier and he let his wings fall as she approached, unsure what to do. When she reached him, she cupped Steve’s chest just like she had hers not seconds before and let out a petulant whine.
The first thing Steve noticed was the bodies, there was about 10 people all in various states of disarray in a pile by one of the vats that held a slime like substance that must be what is making all the fog.
The elevator dinged and he stepped off and walked right into the apartment like he owned the place (technically he did).
“T-Tony...uh- please.” Steve was breathing hard and his hips made little twitches that he couldn’t stop.
Tony was lying on the bed, he looked peaceful and like he was just sleeping if it wasn’t for the oxygen mask over his face and the I.V in his arm that was dripping liquid directly into his veins. Steve stretched out his wings and laid it over Tony's body and one wrapped around Bucky’s shoulders, they each took one of Tony’s hands and sat on the sides of the bed. Steve watched the slow rise and fall of Tony’s too small chest, the way his breath barely fogged the plastic covering his mouth could attest to how bad it was. Steve couldn’t do it anymore, he hated this feeling, not being able to do anything. The last time he had felt this way he took the serum and joined the army, for all the serum could do it couldn’t make Steve perfect in this aspect, he couldn’t punch his way out of this.
“test the temperature and tell me if it’s alright,” Bucky looked over at Steve as if for permission and hesitantly reached forward with his metal arm, when he cautiously dipped two fingers in the water his eyes went wide for a split second. It was the most emotion Tony had seen him express yet, Bucky nodded and removed his hand returning it to his lap. Tony circled the bed and climbed in behind Bucky, he watched as Bucky's back went taunt and he pulled his wings closer to his body as he felt Tony move behind him.
“well, yeah, it probably will, but I don’t know if I can get through this interview without you by my side holdin’ my hand.” Tony stepped closer and took the shirt from Steve’s hands and let it drop to the floor. Tony took Steve’s face in his hands and kissed his nose.
"Hey Jarvis? I know Bruce asked me to go to his lab, but can you ask him how I'm supposed to do that without being seen?" A few minutes later, Bruce came out of the elevator with what looked like a bunch of leather straps. Steve eyed the thing in his hand and took a step back while his wings raised defensively.
There was the sound of a zipper and the rustle of clothes behind him then the man pushed into him all at once. Tony cried out at the feeling, he could feel himself begin to respond as the man pushed into him over and over again, he could see the others start palming themselves through their pants as they waited their turn with him. The man didn’t last long, thrusting in one last brutal time and Tony felt the hot cum in him as the man pulled out. He whimpered at the loss of sensation but, once the first left, another took his place. He was thicker that the first and lasted a lot longer, Tony actually came on the guys dick after it hit his prostate, there was a buzz that went around the room after he came. The second finished in him and another took his place. Tony lost count of how many after about 7 guys had him and he passed out again.
a cliff hanger *scary music* im sorry (not really). well now the boys know about the Apple pie in the oven. please tell me what you think below and as usual enjoy!
“Tony, I think Steve needs his wings groomed. It has been a while and Stevie needs to relax a little.” Bucky and Tony shared a grin and then Tony dashed off into the bathroom to get a dish of warm water and some fluffy towels.
“Miss me?” Steve and Bucky both hugged him and while he was leaning over their shoulders, he must have noticed their visitor because he tensed. “The hell is reindeer games doing here?!”
“Steve it’s me, Bruce, and Bucky, I’m here to help Tony,” he lifted his medical bag and then glanced over to Bucky so he would show the neatly folded clothes that he had been carrying. “Can we come over and help?” Steve had opened his wings to the point where they fully covered Tony so they couldn't see him but they watched as Steve ducked his head under the protection of his wing and ask Tony something.
“you wouldn’t wake up, come on, it's almost 6:00 and we have to tell the team before dinner.” Steve smiled and hopped off of Bucky, making sure to swing her hips as she exited the room.
“hey!” Steve squawked out, but Tony saw the corner of Bucky’s lips twitch up, he counted it as a win.
After the initial pain subsided a bit Rogers leaned over and took something out of the bedside table, there was a snicker of a bottle opening and then sudden cold on his ass. Tony jolted at the sudden temperature difference, but relaxed once he got used to it, it rather felt good in his abused ass. There was another snick of the bottle closing and then Rogers’ hand gently rubbed what Tony guessed was some kind of lotion into his ass. Tony pushed back into the feeling as Rogers continued massaging the cool lotion into the hot skin left from his punishment.
There was a whole section dedicated to the Avengers merchandise and Steve found herself pulled to it. Obviously, there was no shirts with Bucky on them but she felt bad just getting Iron Man stuff, She decided that when she got home she would make it up to him.
They continue to throw punches at they fall through the open air, about two thirds of the way down Steve realizes that he is falling and opens his wings to pull up, Bucky continues to fall for a second and twists in the air to right himself. Steve hovers in the air not sure where Bucky went, it seemed like he just disappeared. He was wrong.
“Yeah Buck, I'm fine- holy shit that isn’t my voice!” Steve’s head whirled around to Loki so fast he should have got whiplash but the second his mouth opened to ask what the god had done a flash of blond was in his eyesight and then his mouth was full of hair.
“I'm fine, Not hurt in anyway. Now, I will show you because I know that you don’t believe me, but calm down and let me do it so you don’t rip my shirt. Okay, honey?” Steve released Tony’s wrists from where he was holding them and put a hand on the side of his face to tip it up, he looked into those warm brown eyes and rubbed his thumb over Tony’s cheekbone. Tony gave Steve a watery smile and nodded once, Steve smiled back and kissed his nose before he let go to take off his shirt. Tony’s eyes raked down his chest and then he traced the path with his hands, he stopped at one of the harness straps and pulled it away from Steve’s skin then looked at Steve pleadingly.
Steve pushes himself up, he looks at himself and takes in the damage that he took evaluating if he can continue to fight, he sees that he is completely fine other than a few scratches that he got in the fighting. When he looks at Iron man he sees that Tony had the face plate open and he has a repulsor trained on Steve’s chest as well as to his right, when he looks at what Tony is watching he sees himself. He is wearing a suit that is the same a Steve’s but it is black and red with the Hydra symbol where the star is on his own suit,he is grinning as he shifts his stance and pulls the shield off of his shoulder mount it is also black and red with the Hydra symbol where the star should be.
“I'm surprised that the wound hasn’t healed more than I has on him,” Bruce’s voice was low and had that curious tone that it got when he found a new fungus that he didn’t understand yet from a sample after a mission. “Medically he is fine, but I would like to keep an eye on it and see how the healing progresses, seeing as he had never taken this long to heal before or has never scared it will be interesting to see what happens and how what Loki did may have affected him.” Bucky nodded and Steve got off of the table to stand next to him as he called Tony over and they went back to their room to get some well-deserved sleep.
Steve placed himself on the far side of the room where the ramp started and the Avengers were on the other side by the showers. He spread his wings, but not fully yet, then he started up the ramp. As he ran, he moved his wings and he felt them catch on the air. He reached the ledge and jumped off, his wings opened fully with a ‘thwap’ and he pumped them up and down. When he opens his eyes, he was soaring high above the other superheroes, the tall ceiling of the training room allowing him space to beat his wings. He felt amazing, his heart was pounding as he slowly glided down to the others. when flying he was fine the issue was stopping. The others jumped out of the way before he hit them, but Tony didn’t react fast enough and was knocked over onto the mat, Steve landing on top of him.
“where are we? This looks like a Hydra facility.” Loki didn’t answer him, but brought him to the laboratory and then further to the holding cells some of the cells had the creatures that were in the A.I.M lab where he got his wings. Steve mentally took note of everything he saw and the fact that Hydra and A.I.M were working together. Not thinking Steve almost walked into Loki when he abruptly stopped in front of a cell at the end if the hall, it was away from the others. Steve looked inside and saw nothing, but then there was movement in the shadows. Steve looked forcibly away from the movement and around the rest of the cell, there wasn’t much, just a small worn-out mattress and a toilet in the corner, the walls were cement as well as the floor there were stains that looked like blood, as well as other things Steve didn’t want to think about right now. Steve’s eyes caught on the movement again, whatever it was seemed to be waking up, and it took notice to them. The figure walked out to where they could see... Was...was that...
When he stepped out of the elevator, he found the place overturned, the table was broken in half, the couch and armchair was on its side and in the middle of the mess a small shaking form sat in the most defensible position in the place. he was surrounded by what looked like every piece of fabric that was on the floor, from blankets to towels to shirts and clothes that Steve must have left in the closet here. Bucky’s wings were in a defensive position and they were puffed up the make him look large and intimidating, Tony moved towards him and Bucky registered his presence in the room. His eyes flashed all over Tony, taking in who he was and the threat level that he posed. Tony crouched low to the ground and left his hands open and visible to Bucky as he slowly got closer to the scared man.
“Brucie Bear! How could you, cheating on me with Reindeer games here. I thought we were science bros?!” Tony’s over-theatrical rendition of his feelings caught Loki’s eye and he stopped levitating the stapler with his magic while Jarvis scanned him so he could come over to the group.
“Don’t worry one bit, since this guy gets his wings dirty so much," Tony jerked his thumb at Steve, who had a indigent look on his face, "I've become something of an expert at grooming them.” he took the cloth that Steve had prepared already and tested the water, it had cooled a bit so he decided to get some fresh water, he told Bucky as much and went to retrieve the water. When he returned Steve was sitting on the bed next to Bucky, Tony walked over and held the water out for him to test.
“That was exhausting.” his voice was muffled by the pillow he had his face buried in, but Tony chuckled so he heard just fine. He stepped carefully around the splayed wings so he could sit next to Steve’s head, which he pulled out of the pillow and into his lap so he could stroke his fingers through the silky blond hair, Steve groaned at the attention and his wings twitched when he ran his fingers over the sensitive place on the back of his neck.
“Sorry sugar, I'm not the kind of girl to put out on the first date.” Rogers pushed him back into the wall and lifted Tony like he was nothing, his crotch presses a searing line into Tony’s hip and Tony reflexively wrapped his legs around that oh-so tiny waist. “Is that a gun in your pants or are you just happy to see me?” Rogers eyes darkened and Tony could almost feel his stomach drop.
"Master Bruce I need to inform you about a development in Master Rogers's back issue." Bruce had just boarded the jet Tony sent to pick him up when Jarvis interrupts his reading.
“She is exhausted from the busy day, I figured that you guys would like to take her up to your rooms so she can get some real rest in an actual bed.”
“While I would like to get a full physical workup that is good for now, I understand that you guys have some things to discuss so you are free to go.”
The pull of the muscles in his back was agonizing, he felt like he was going to bust out of his skin. He bent over his knees and felt a warm sensation dripping down his spine. Before he could piece together what was happening, a loud ripping sound and screams filled his ears, he didn't realize it was him screaming through the pain. It was even worse than when he was put in that vita-ray machine and gained 100 lbs and grew a foot in 30 seconds.
"Yeah probably," Bruce concurred "Well, take off your shirt and turn around so I can see what I'm working with." When Steve did so Bruce made no sound. He turned his head to the silent scientist and saw the crease between his eyebrows.
“My turn.” his face had that look on it he got when he was presenting something he made, but that thought was soon pushed out of Steve’s mind. Tony started to truly fuck her into the mattress, his hips moving fast and the only sound in the room was the slap of skin on skin. Steve’s breath was pushed out of her lungs with the force of his thrusts, little ‘unh, unh, unh.’ sounds falling from her lips. But soon even that was silenced when Bucky captured her mouth with his.
Steve sat up and engulfed Tony in a huge hug, wings and all. He tried to put every ounce of ‘I love you, you are perfect’ into that hug so Tony would know how much he meant to him, that he was so much more than he thought he was. Tony was shaking in Steve’s arms, his breathing was hitching so Steve pulled him in even tighter and pulled him onto his lap with his wings still blocking out the world. This was their whole existence right now, just the two of them and all the love Steve could possibly feel for the man in his arms, and then some more.
“The team should know.” Steve’s sudden comment caught Tony off guard, his fingers stilled in Steve’s feathers where they had been mindlessly petting the soft wing draped over him.
Tony could feel Bucky going limp in his hold, he was probably tired from everything and the adrenaline must be wearing off, Tony started to pull away but Bucky grabbed onto Tony’s shirt like a little child. Tony hushed him and gathered him close while he slowly backed them up to the couch in the waiting area of the floor. He sat them down and Bucky relaxed a little bit. Tony had Bucky lay down across the couch and put his head on Tony’s lap and then he pulled Bucky’s top wing from behind him and wrapped it around him like a blanket. He could feel Bucky’s body relaxing as he continued brushing his hair and feathers. When Bucky finally went completely limp Tony hesitantly pulled his fingers out of their respective places and waited for Bucky to wake but he didn’t, he waited a few more minutes then Tony slowly lifted Bucky’s head from his lap and placed a throw pillow under it as he quietly walked over to where Bruce was working.
“Yeah, that should be ok. I'll tell you guys if I change my mind though.” Bucky and Tony both nodded. “And I think just call me Steve for now, I'm not sure I will be able to get used to another name.”
“I am most intrigued and accept this challenge, the power of Mjolnir is much greater than this Midgardian metal.”
“Ok, Steve. I’m going to massage the gland now.” Steve made a cute little approving noise in the back of his throat.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony continued, seemingly unfazed by Steve’s obvious feelings. “I was wondering if you would like to act on those feelings.” Steve wasn’t sure what to say; that wasn’t exactly a question, but Tony started to look like he did when he was hurting and didn’t want anyone to know so he got all stubborn and pushed everyone away.
“Loki is going to use his magic to help Tony, in return he needs a place to stay because he has been banished from Asgard.”
“Ok, I’m good now.” It had been 15 minutes and Steve was still inside Tony, from what he could gather, was still coming.
“A knot is a bulb on a male dog's penis that, when they reach orgasm, inflates inside the female to keep ejaculate inside and increase the chance of pregnancy.” There was a strangled noise and then Tony’s laughter.
“My second is named Jormungand, he is also known as the Midguard Serpent. He is a large snake that was banished to the waters here, much like you were I suppose. The prophecies speak of him killing Thor, so Odin sent him here. It is strange to be so close to him now.” Loki took a breath and continued. “I spent the shortest amount of time with him, but I remember that he loved to curl around my shoulders like a scarf. He is now able to wrap himself around your world and bite his own tail, but at the time he was no longer than my arm.”
With a smile Bucky straightened and pulled Steve flush with his body, his wings fluffed and then ‘Thwapped’ out before he leaned back and they tumbled off of the ledge, still in each other's embrace.
“Ok, doll.” he sat up giving her to Tony while he stripped out of his clothes, when he finished, he took Steve back and Tony shed his clothes just as fast. He crawled back onto the bed and pulled her pants off.
This chapter is once again brought to you by: Insomnia™ the number one reason why I am so fucking tired all the time!
"I want you to come to my office tomorrow, or I guess technically later today for some tests. I need some sleep in a real bed now, and I suggest you do too." With that Bruce got up and left. Tomorrow he would have to deal with Tony so he fully deserved some sleep.
Steven took the cap off the beer and handed it to Rogers, he tipped his head back and Steven watched as he drained half the bottle in one go, his throat moving as he swallowed. Steven licked his lips and took the bottle when he was handed it and then passed over the plate of eggs, Rogers hummed as he ate and then gave Steven the plate back taking the bottle back and Steven walked back into the kitchen to put the used plate and fork in the sink.
“Captain, what is it you require of me.” Thor’s voice was booming like it always was but he made an effort to keep his volume down. Steve let a smile spread across his face.
Steve is sitting on the cot when Bucky comes storming in after he predictably ran away from the medical tent he was forced to when they arrived.
“This might take a while, if you want to be here you can but you don’t have to. Steve here just needs to get something off his mind, doesn’t he?” Bucky tried to catch Steve’s eyes, but the guy was an expert at avoiding it now, from all the talking to’s he got back when Bucky would have to save his scrawny ass every day.
“Sleipnir is my next child, I was angry at all for taking my children so I changed myself into a mare and refused to change back. When I was lead to the paddock Thor’s steed decided he wanted to have his way with me. When I first realized I was with child I reacted in a way much like you did, I was terrified at what would happen to this child. He was born late in the spring, his coat is grey with black spots on his flank and he had eight legs. He was with me for the longest time, still is if I go back to Asgard. Sleipnir is Odin’s Steed. I was allowed to visit him in his stall every now and then, he loved apples and I simply adored him. I fear that I will never get the chance to see him again now.”
When Tony woke again The alarm was going off and Steve was already in his suit, that was not a good sign. Tony got out of bed and pressed the button in the wall to call the suit, when they were both suited up and flying to where the attack was happening was when Tony finally found out what they were up against.
Steve dropped him and the man gasped for breath at Steve’s feet. Steve reeled back his leg and kicked him right in the kidney with his steel toed combat boots. He then crouched down to be level with the man and pulled a serrated knife out of his back pocket, the man looked up at Steve in fear but he had no idea what Steve had decided to do with the knife, Steve grinned at the man and placed a knee on his chest, effectively holding him down. Once the man realized what he was doing he struggled but Steve pushed down harder and went on. He ripped the mans pants open and pulled out the man's still wet cock, he turned to watch the mans face as he sawed off his dick, the screams were music to Steve’s ears, he watched as the man jolted under him and begged to die. Steve wasn’t ready to let the man die yet but he caught whimpering and he saw that Tony was still there so he took the shield and brought it down on the guys throat, it cut right through and Steve picked up the head walking it over to the toilet and placing it in the bowl before he went to help Tony.
“Medical,” was all Steve said as he walked past Tony and directly to the elevators where they rode down to the medical floor together in silence.
The jet landed in a clearing a little way away from the actual base, the loading dock lowered and the team filed out. Bruce stayed behind to man the comms and because they didn’t know if Hulk would be needed yet. Thor took Natasha and Clint, one (Natasha) held against him with his free arm and the other holding onto him like he was getting a piggyback ride, and took off. Steve took hold of the grips in Tony's armor and they shot off after the others.
“T-Ton- Mmmm, need, need it. Please.” Steve ripped off the entire front of the suit with one last pull, his muscular chest bulging through his suit. He didn’t seem to know what to do with the sudden amount of flesh before him but after a second Steve leaned over and stuck his face in the dip of Tony’s neck, rubbing against him and humming.
wow... uh. not really where that came from but there it is. this chapter just kind of wrote itself. Steve's speech imbodys my feelings on some of the things happening in the U.S right now. i wasn't sure whether to add in something about trump or not but i decided not to for this chapter maybe in a later one. please comment below and tell me what you think, and as usual thanks for reading!
“ -you going to join us? Reindeer games?” the voice of Stark pulled Loki out of his mind and back in the present. He glanced around the room and found all eyes on him.
"Nothing to worry about Tony just getting checked out, better safe than sorry." Steve interjected before the doctor could answer.
"What do you think could change? Will I grow a tail and cat ears now!?" Steve's chest felt tight and he was panicking. The thought of another part of his body not being his anymore made him sick. He backed himself up into a corner and leapt up onto one of Clint's ledges. He sat pressed into the corner and pulled his wings around him, Bruce just stared for a second. Steve could never reach the ledge even with the super serum, but with a strong beat of his wings he was able to get up there now. Bruce was pretty sure Steve hadn't done it optionally, but he had just flown.
“show me.” the scanner was brought up on the H.U.D and it pointed to... to the shield? Why would the shield bring up life signs? Tony looked around to make sure there were no Hydra agents and he stepped out of the armor. It stayed in sentential mode ready for him to return. Tony crouched down in front of the shield and lifted it up to examine it. A small squeak brought his attention away from the shield and to the ground it had been covering. Sitting on the ground was what looked like... was that a fairy? Wait, no, not a fairy, STEVE! It was Steve but he was small enough to fit in Tony’s hand.
Bucky made a face at Tony and that was the breaking point. Tony jumped over Steve and tackled Bucky to the floor. Normally Tony wouldn’t be able to get the upper hand physically but he had the element of surprise. While Bucky was stunned on the floor, Tony used his genius brain and won the fight before it even started. Tony knew just where Bucky was the most ticklish, soon Bucky was in tears, rolling on the floor and trying halfheartedly to swat Tony’s hands away while he giggled his ass off.
“I see that you are awake and I know that you want to get out of here, but before I can let you go I need to examine you again and look over your test results.” Steve nodded to Bruce that he was okay with him getting started with the exam. First Bruce checked him over looking at the large bruise on his side and for a concussion. “You seem to be stable for now, but we need to talk about what happened.” Steve bowed his head and steeled himself for what was to happen.
“What is this to you!” Steve threw his hands up, gesturing to the entire world, “Is this all just a fucking game? Tony is down there dying and you think it's ‘interesting’? I knew that you were messed up, but this is a whole new level even for you.”
“Hela, is my first and only daughter. She was cast to Niflheim, the land of the dishonorable dead, what you would call Hell. she was so much like her mother that Angrboda shielded her from me and I made one of the most regrettable decisions of my long life, I left them. I abandoned my daughter and she grew to resent me, before I could find her again she was sent to Niflheim. Only the dishonorable dead can enter so half her body is dead and half is frozen in time.”
“I have the serum and a healing factor to do that, you don’t.” Steve was pacing a hole in the floor and Bucky was watching everything happen from the couch a few feet away.
sorry for the short chapter next chapter will be the interview. as usual thank you for reading and i hope you enjoy!
Pepper gave her a long sleeve shirt that had a V-neck and was obviously fitted to a female’s body. Steve pulled it over her head and Natasha took her long hair out from the back to brush it while she looked at herself in the mirror.
“well green bean, we better start working on something to get him back to size.” Tony said to Bruce as he carried Steve into the now vacant elevator to go down to the labs.
Tony’s eyes widen as he sees how big Steve is, it's never going to fit. Especially without a lot of prep and Steve is not thinking right now. Tony braces himself, trying to relax and let his muscles let go. Then Steve shifts up and straddles Tony’s hips.
“could you, Um...help me?” Natasha got up and took the leather from his hands, she looked at it and then looked at him, a question in her eyes.
He was torn out of his thoughts when the loud snick of a cap was opened and the bed dipped again as Rogers settled behind Tony. Tony's hands stopped moving and stayed where they were on his hips, Steven could feel the calluses on his hands as they tightened on his hip bones and Tony's breathing got faster, Tony tensed and then his whole body relaxed and he groaned, Steven looked in his eyes and realized what was happening, Rogers was fingering Tony open. Was this what he had looked like? Did Tony like it? Questions floated around Steven’s foggy brain as he watched Tony’s face while he got opened.
When they parted to catch their breaths, he took his length in his hand and rubbed the head up and down the length of her slit, gathering her slick and teasing her in the process. Steve was not having that, her legs came up and wrapped around his waist, with a quick move she flipped them so she was on top, straddling Tony’s hips.
try to go back to sleep and hope it will sort itself out, But there was just no way he was falling back asleep with this amount of pain.
“what is it big guy? Tell me what you want.” Tony swirled his hips again and Steve couldn’t reply. “Do you want me to ride you? Bounce myself on your huge cock until I cum, then take your big knot, have it plug me up while you pump me full of your cum.”
“Good timing, Loki has just come down to help me with some experiments.” Bruce called over his shoulder as he tapped away at a holo-screen.
“No! N-no can't... won't - don'wanna m' a monster." Steve's voice was frantic and broken, his Brooklyn accent broke through his sobs.
“Now that we have that figured out I think that you'll want some comfortable pants. She gave Steve some grey yoga pants to try on but she didn’t like the way that they were tight in the thighs but loose in the ankles, she felt as if she would trip over the extra fabric. Pepper then handed her some plain black leggings and Steve liked those much better. They were like the pants on her suit but with less padding and bulletproof fabric.
“Stevie, can I carry him?” Bucky’s voice was small but he was watching Tony from where he was standing a few feet back with longing. Steve reasoned with himself that if anything else happened that he could protect everyone better if he didn’t have Tony in his arms, also he had been with Tony the whole time, and Bucky was probably out of his mind with protective instincts just like Steve was right now. Steve stood with Tony in his arms and walked over to Bucky, he laid Tony in his arms carefully and watched as Bucky cradled Tony against him. Tony roused slightly and stuffed his face in Bucky’s neck, Bucky chuckled slightly at the feeling of Tony’s breath gusting over his neck as he breathed.
Bucky uses the metal arm to clamp on to Steve’s arm like a vice, Steve cries out in pain and goes down to the floor. He lands awkwardly half on his wing and half on one of Bucky’s. They both grunt out an exclamation at the pain and pull away. There is a silent truce between the both of them because they step back a few feet and investigate their damaged wings to see what was wrong and the extent that they are hurt. A large ‘boom’ makes their heads whip to the door that was thrown open, the noise was caused from the door hitting against the metal of the hall that leads to the stairway into the tower, in the doorway stands Tony with a contraption in his arms that looks like a gun but it clearly doesn’t shoot bullets, behind him in the shadow of the tower stairs Bruce watching them carefully. Steve hesitates at the sight of Tony, Bucky does not. The sound of gravel crunching underfoot is the only warning he had before he is being tackled to the ground, this time Steve flipped them midair and ended with his knees pinning Bucky’s wings and his arms pinning his, Bucky struggled under him but, Steve kept his held. There was a sharp pain that shot into his back, he reached around and pulled a tranq dart out of himself, when he felt Bucky go limp under him, he looked and saw an identical dart sticking out of his chest.
“Sorry,” Steve said, sitting back on his heels and rubbings at the back of his neck. His face was red again. “Guess I’ll have to practice my landings.”
it is currently -33 degrees outside so i have some extra time to work on this story while i am off of school. there will likely be another update soon. please enjoy!
“It's beautiful,” he said between kisses. “It is what keeps you alive, but what makes it the most wonderful thing is it’s YOU Tony, part of you, and you are the best person I know.” His words pulled more tears from Tony and he kissed them away just as fast as they could fall.
Careful of his injuries he shuffled over to the toilet and promptly puked his guts out, once he was done he went to the sink and tried to wash up the best he could at the moment and got a sip of some water for his scratchy throat, turns out when you are screaming for someone to stop over and over again, for who knows how long, your throat starts to hurt. The water felt like the best thing in the world at the moment, he still felt dirty and weak but it was better than being all those things and being covered in cum, blood, spit, and who knows what else.
Bruce's grooming was gentle and he could barely tell he was subtly examining them as he worked. When he worked his way into the joint between his back and where the wing started Steve outright moaned. The feeling of fingers there was like nothing he had ever felt before. Then he felt wetness and got confused and slightly alarmed.
"Wow! 20 feet! That's... wow. I can't wait to work with him and help him with his... difficulties as you put it, I can't imagine what he's going through."
The next morning Bucky was cleaning the wounds on both Steve’s and Tony's neck, when he noticed something weird. He first cleaned Tony while Steve waited on the other side of the bed. When Bucky pulled the gauze back, he noticed that the wound was almost completely healed except for the light pink new skin that filled the crescent shape of Steve’s jaw. Bucky didn’t want to worry either of them so he kept his face schooled and cleaned the wound.
“Hello Captain, I see you have found your ‘Bucky'. I have to say, watching you the last few months has been very interesting.” His slimy voice ruffled Steve’s feathers and made him see red.
“yes, I want to firstly to acknowledge the mutant community and say that if I had the X-gene I would be proud of it and everyone who is a mutant should be proud of who they are, that’s what America stands for, the people. I do not have the gene, and the wings are not a result of my being a mutant. I would like to apologize on behalf of the entire country, for the way mutants are treated as something less than human. It pains me to learn that in the 70 years that I was gone that hasn’t changed."
When they reached the roof the rest of the team was already waiting in their suits, Tony glanced at Nat. “Coulson had a way of contacting him.” she answered and Tony watched as both Bucky and Steve went less defensive (though Bucky was still weary but seemed comforted by Steve and Tony’s relaxed posture) Peter pulled off his mask and crumpled it in his hand and he began almost vibrating where he stood. The clouds rumbled once more and a beam of bright light broke out, as soon as it came it left and the clouds disappear with it, leaving a large figure standing in the middle of a singed circle glyph on the roof.
“Hello Captain,” Steve jumped slightly and whirled around to see Loki walk in the room. He looked soft and kind wearing a dark t-shirt and what Steve guessed were the Asgardian equivalent of sweatpants. “Would you like to get Started now?”
When Steve came back to himself, he first felt the warmth and ache in his ass and then he noticed the taste of blood in his mouth, he reflexively licked at the salty, iron, taste but that caused a groan to come from under him and his brain connected what just happened. He tried to pull away but was kept there by not only his knot in Tony’s ass but the weight of Bucky on his back, he looked down in horror at the bite mark on Tony’s neck. Tony could tell what was going through Steve’s head and he was determined to stop him from beating himself up about it.
“You will count, once I deem it enough, I will stop. If you have kept count correctly and do not skip or forget a number, I will allow you to suck me off. If you do loose count, however, we will start again and you will watch as I jerk off and you will leave, not allowed to touch yourself or reach climax in any other way.”
“What did you do to him, you slimy little bastard.” Bucky growled out as he lunged at Loki again this time with a knife, Loki popped in and out of reality 5 feet to the left of Bucky and watched as Bucky fell onto the floor where he had been standing.

“Its ok, make as much noise as you want, it means that you are liking it.” Bucky blushed and nodded his head allowing Tony to continue. Tony’s mouth was watering, but he resigned himself to giving a hand-job, he could talk to Steve about everything later. Bucky was about the same length as Steve but he had more girth, Tony swiped his thumb over the head where a bead of pearly precome had welled up, Bucky threw his head back and moaned. He was getting close and Tony could tell, he redoubles his efforts, adding in a twist of his wrist and just like that Bucky shot off in his hand. After he finished his body sagged back onto the bed and he fell asleep. Tony cleaned up left the room after putting everything away, after all he had something important to talk to Steve about.
“Well, you know back then it wasn’t good for queers. Steve was always picked on, even when he didn’t know himself that he liked guys. Always getting called a fairy and shit,” Bucky pulled Steve further onto his lap and laid his head on his shoulder as he rubbed his back and continued talking. “Even after we got our heads out of our asses and got together, he never bottomed, it was always me. I think he never thought less of someone who bottomed, but at the same time he knew that he couldn’t let himself do that.” Bucky sighed.
“that good huh?” a single, exhausted squeak answered his question and he chuckled as he picked Steve up in his hands. “let's get you some pants and then I can work on that communicator.”
Once the Captain got into the basement lab where the experiments were held, he couldn't believe what he was seeing. They, whatever they were, weren't human anymore. Most were dead or dying in small cages, their body's deformed and beaten. Across the room a lone scientist was hastily packing vials into a bag about to run.
“I’m s-sorry Steve,” Tony said catching his breath. “it's just that is what had had you pouting for the last half hour? I would love to do that with you and I'm sure Bucky is up for it too.” to show Steve just how up for it he was, Bucky rubbed his half hard cock against Steve’s ass. Tony noticed the movement and must have seen a look on Steve’s face because his eyes darkened and he grabbed the lube off the side table to begin prepping himself as Bucky was content with rubbing off against Steve. Bucky leaned against Steve and whispered in his ear as they watched Tony finger himself open.
“Well, everyone wants to know about your new additions, can you tell us about them?” Steve gaped for a second, the thought of the lab made bile rise in his throat and his feathers shivered, Nat, obviously seeing his terror answer for him.
"I can’t wait to see Clint’s face!” Tony's eyes had that glint in them that told Steve he was up to no good again. Steve leaned over and kissed Tony.
His face was on fire, salty tears fell in thick rivulets down his face. He was such an idiot. They wouldn’t want him; he was a freak.
After a few moments they parted and Tony grabbed Steve’s hand, pulling him to the couch and pushing him down so he was sitting while Tony remained standing. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and started to pace again. Bucky sat next to Steve on the couch and slung a wing around his back to comfort him. Steve knew what was going to happen, Bucky knew it too and he wanted Steve to be able to hear Tony, not just be yelled at when he finally burst.
The elevator ride to the penthouse was awkward and it was just as much so when they arrived, Steve still had his kicked puppy look on and he was fidgeting not sure where he was welcome to stand or sit.
"I agree it wasn't the smartest decision I've ever made, but last night I was so tired and I had a headache." Bruce was no longer angry, his face contorted into worry.
“Right again. All magic comes with a price, this specific one happens to take the effects from Tony and put them in you. With that serum of yours it shouldn’t be fatal.”
Still lost in his thoughts the elevator dinged to tell him it reached its destination. He walked into his penthouse and made a beeline for the large bed. He set Steve gently onto the pillow next to him and crawled under the covers, instantly he was dead to the world.
“What you thinkin’ about Stevie that's got you all hot and bothered?” Steve’s whole body tensed. Bucky rubbed at his shoulders because Steve was lying on his side facing away from them, staring intently at the wall. Tony draped himself over Bucky’s abdomen and ran his fingers through the long flight feathers on Steve’s accessible wing, a shiver ran down his spine and goose bumps prickled all over his body. He let out a low sound and Tony got out of the bed to walk around so he could see Steve’s face. Bucky watched as Tony’s expression fell and he knelled by the side of the bed. He petted Steve, his hands slowly carding through his hair and over his cheeks. Bucky pulled Steve flush with his chest mainly so he could hold Steve like he used to but also so Tony could get in the bed again and hold Steve from the front while he talked to him, as much as Bucky liked the idea of Tony on his knees that would have to wait for later.
“Well, either way let's get some rest and then go see Bruce and Loki in the morning so they can tell us if it has something to do with the magic."
Once Tony worked the first finger in he added another and scissored them, his back bowed and his eyes closed in ecstasy when he hit his prostate. He continued to hit his prostate every few thrusts and soon he was breathing heavy, his cock slick and dripping. He opened his eyes and Steve looked like he was about to devour him, his breathing was fast and he was flushed from head to toe, his dick had made a spot of precum on his stomach where it throbbed for attention, the head angry red and the place at the base where his knot would be was already half blown. Tony took Steve into his hand again and used the extra lube to slick him up as he leaned over and gave him a kiss, Steve's hands let go of where they were fisted in the sheets, an effort to not touch, and held onto his waist as Tony continued to kiss him. Tony shuffled up and reached back to line Steve up with him, he traced Steve's lips once more before he sat himself back. The blunt head pushed at his loosened rim and slid inside of the tight white-hot heat of Tony’s body, Steve groaned and just barely stopped himself from thrusting all the way in. Tony continued to take Steve and once his ass was flush with Steve's groin, he moaned at how full he felt. Once his body adjusted to the intrusion he circled his hips and that pulled moans from both of them.
A pang of sadness and familiarity was in Loki’s chest. He remembered holding Sleipnir before Odin took him. Loki shook that thought from his mind, he should be focused on Steve right now. He looked down and found that Steve was looking up at him, his eyes, pink from crying, but that crystal blue shone into his soul.
“NO!” Steve suddenly jerked up and he stilled completely, although his hips twitched a few times, rubbing against the thigh of the suit. Steve’s eyes got big and blue and Tony knew that look, the look that he could never say no to. Tears spilled over and washed down Steve’s flushed face. “Pl-please, Sta-Stay, Tony. n-n-need y-ou. Please it hurts, please. Wan’ you so much.” Steve started grinding his hips again but he shifted himself up and now Steve’s erection is rubbing right up against Tony’s. A desperate groan is pushed out of Tony and Steve goes back to licking and kissing all over Tony’s chest while he rubs himself off against the genius.
“He is good, hurry up and get it in me.” the desperation in Tony’s voice catches Steven off guard but the blunt pressure is on his hole and Steven feels every inch of Tony slide into him. Tony bottoms out, but stays still and doesn’t move, Steven opens his eyes to see why and watches Tony’s face as Rogers pushes into him, Rogers bottoms out with a thrust that pushes Tony further into Steven and all three of them moan.
“H-he said ‘our child’, but Tony is the father. He was the one who fucked me last night, you just watched.” Steve fidgeted under the gaze of his lovers, both men made eye contact over Steve’s hunched shoulders before Tony broke the silence.
For the first time since Afghanistan, he slept through the night without waking in a cold sweat from nightmares. His eyes fluttered closed, soft rhythmic lub-dub of Steve's heart still in his ears.
There was a fog of pink mist surrounding the entire building, it was billowing out of large chimneys on the roof. Tony and Thor landed in front of the building and let their passengers down onto the grass. Tony did some scans with the suit and everyone waited with baited breath.
“OWW!” Barton’s exclamation of pain made him look up and even Steve stood up on his palm to look over his fingers at the commotion. Natasha had wacked Clint behind the head and was now giving him one of her ‘you have severely fucked up’ glares.
That was of course when Tony walked out of the bedroom, his hair disheveled and a dusting of hickies visible from the low neckline of a borrowed shirt that's too big on his smaller body. He didn’t notice Steve in his still half-asleep shuffle to the coffee maker.
For the first time since he arrived on the floor Tony noticed the people in the room with him. Clint was on the couch with a bowl of cereal that was more sugar than it was cereal. Natasha was reading a book on the ledge of the window and flipping a small knife between pages. Bruce was cooking like he normally did. He was the only one of them that demonstrated the ability to make edible food so, more than not he was the one cooking. Today he was standing over a pan of eggs and dropping little bits of bacon and spinach as it cooked, omelets.
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?! Steve hasn't left his room in a week! And now he has 'appendages' that are 20 feet! Is he like a merman now and got stuck in his bathtub?" Tony let his mind wander a little bit with that thought, but he lost it with the whole 'how to sex up a fish tail' thing. He decided to give up for now, He obviously wasn't going to get any good info tonight, he closed the program and went up to his penthouse.
Steve was cold. He was cold, oh god he was cold. Was he on ice again? Did he sleep for another 70 years? Will all his friends be dead again? There was a rush of hot air over his back ruffling his feathers. That felt good, So warm. He turned and sat up in shock, Tony? But why was Tony so big? Steve walked over to Tony's slumbering face. He looked so peaceful. The lines that seemed permanently etched into his face were smoothed away, making him look so young. Steve surveyed his surroundings and saw that not only was Tony giant their whole room was huge. Wait, no, everything isn’t large he was small! The memory of yesterday came back to him.
Unsure of what to do with himself he put the rest of the eggs away so he could warm them up later and then walked back over to the couch, Rogers looked up at him and took another swig of the beer before he leaned over and placed the empty bottle on the table, in one swift movement he curled his arm around Steven’s waist and lifted him onto his lap so that Steve’s straddled Rogers’ thighs. Rogers took the back of Steven’s head in his hand and pressed their lips together; Steven opened his mouth and Rogers pushed some beer into his mouth Steven licked up the taste and once it was gone, he followed it into Rogers’ mouth. Rogers allowed Steven to explore the warm cavern of his mouth, letting Steven steer the kiss and simply setting back and rubbing his hands over Steven’s body.
Steve felt a weight in his gut drop at the silence and began to turn away. This was a bad idea, why did he think that Tony would want him after what he did to him.
“We should probably talk now so we can get everything out of the way before the team finds out, I'd be surprised if Tasha isn’t buying me bras and setting out nail polish that would match.” Bucky shifted minutely in his seat.
“Mr. Williams said that the other artists wouldn’t do it and he has a couple a’ people who would pay plenty for this so I decided that I'd do it and then maybe we could do something fun, like see a movie or something,” Steve took the paper from Bucky's hands and gave him the bowl while he put the paper away. “I told ‘ya that you wouldn’t like it. Now, I know you feel bad or whatever but I'll get my stuff packed and I'll be out of your hair by tomorrow.” that was what shook Bucky out of his daze.
“Steve… FUCK! Goddamn it, the 40’s. Why didn’t I think of it before?” Tony ran his fingers through his hair and paced back and forth a little bit while Steve looked on in confusion at the genius’ sudden outburst and then mumbling as he worked out what to say.
Tony ducked his head and took Steve halfway in his mouth in one movement, Steve gasped in surprise and thrust up out of instinct before he stopped himself, there was an equally surprised groan from behind them as Bucky watched. Tony worked Steve over with his mouth as he would normally do, but this time he dipped lower than his balls as he massaged his perineum and then over his hole, Tony waited for Steve to flinch away or go tense again, but he didn’t, fully caught up in the sensations of Tony sucking him off he didn’t realize that Tony was starting to open him up. Bucky noticed that Tony needed more lube and was unable to get it without Steve noticing so he took the tube and squeezed some on Tony’s fingers, Tony hummed in appreciation which pushed the air out of Steve and he moaned at the feeling of the vibrations traveling through his dick. Tony massaged at Steve’s hole and then slowly pushed with one lube slick finger, Steve was still focused on Tony’s mouth and didn’t tense up so he continued, somewhere between two and three fingers Steve realized what was happening and he reached down to run his fingers through Tony’s hair and guide him off of his dick.
“because I can.” Steve replied, a warm slightly heated look crept over his features and his feathers ruffled in anticipation.
“It is a shame you took my suit; it had a rather durable belt… oh, well. I guess we can save that for later.” Tony could hear the want in Rogers’ voice as he paced behind Tony, still bent over the bed and contemplated what Tony’s punishment should be.
"I don't think so, Captain" the scientist sneered, suddenly a vial of glowing blue liquid was coming at him, with Steve distracted the Scientist bolted out of the back door and disappeared down the long corridor.
Ever since he started flying he never wanted to stop. He still had some trouble with his landings, but he was getting better. Tony had to constantly be on Steve about taking brakes and eating. He chuckled to himself, they had completely flipped, usually it was Steve who had to drag him to bed or to eat. Tony was sitting in what he claimed his corner of the training room watching Steve practice over and over. He had to admit that he was getting pretty good and 8/10 times didn’t land on his face.
They were hot rod red with gold lining and in the center, there was an arc reactor. Steve turned them around and saw there was writing on the butt it said in looping gold-sparkling letters ‘Stark Naked’
Tony rolled his hips into Steve's, he felt Steve's erection jump and press harder into him. After a few minutes of grinding, both of them were fully hard and Steve was rutting up against him. Tony sat up and Steve's wings opened so he could move down and take off his clothes as well as Steve's pants. Steve watched him the whole time, once he was undressed Tony moved back up and straddled Steve's thighs. He took Steve into his hand and gave him a few pulls, Steve moaned and Tony swept his thumb over the sensitive head to use the precum gathered there to ease the way.
“Mr. Loki, if you would enter the elevator I will direct it to your floor.” Without hesitation Loki walked from the room and the three of them were left alone once more.
“Relax, Darling. You have nothing to worry for, my stubborn heart is stuck on my oaf of a brother.” Bucky stiffened but soon a groan of pleasure fell from his mouth. Loki disappeared again and Bucky let out a small whimper from the loss of contact on his wings.
Loki was startled by Steve suddenly moving and burying himself into the gods chest, he pulled Loki against him and if Loki was human the embrace would have likely broken his back. Once his shock wore off, he curled his own arms around the man.
“I know I’m not the most experienced at this but I’m pretty sure this isn’t supposed to happen.” Steve said, trying for humor to make the situation less awkward.
“wanted to thank you for yesterday.” Steve’s voice was wrecked. Tony took his right hand off on his shoulder and put it under the covers to hold onto the blond’s hair as the spit slick shaft filled his mouth. Tony's fingers tightened in his hair, he was letting out little whines as he rocked his hips up into Steve’s mouth. Steve held down Tony’s hips and pulled off slowly before sliding back onto him. The taste of pre-cum filled his mouth again, he worked to take all of Tony into his mouth. Tony scratched at Steve's scalp and Steve hummed again. He worked his throat around Tony, His nose was pressed into the coarse hairs at the base of Tony's dick. He was so overwhelmed by Tony, he was everywhere, in him, around him, the deep musk that was nothing but Tony filled his nose as he struggled to breathe around the length in his mouth. Steve swallowed and then bobbed his head, he felt the head hit the back of his throat over and over. Steve had never been so glad that the serum took away his gag reflex and he could now hold his breath for 30 minutes. He used that to his advantage and deep throated Tony over and over. When he pulled up, he licked and sucked at the head, then he let his teeth lightly scratch as he went down on Tony again.
They spend the rest of the night drinking the whiskey on the fire escape and talking to each other while they watch the fireworks. It is sometime around midnight when the festivities stop and both of them are thoroughly drunk and tired, Bucky has to carry Steve into the apartment and lay him down on their single mattress that they share. He leaves to turn off the radio and shut the window when he sees the drawing on the table from earlier, Bucky picks it up and looks at it. Both of the men are handsome and Bucky can feel himself getting hard from looking at them, when he looks at the faces trying to figure out who Steve based them on (because he
“Ungh!” Steven let out between heaving breaths as his body tried to accommodate the large presence in his ass, it felt like Rogers was rearranging his insides. Rogers leaned over Steven and licked up the side of his neck to his ear where he bit at the lobe and then pulled out and slammed home again, Steven screamed with every thrust. He was so was extremely sensitive from his first orgasm, but his cock filled again as Rogers continued to thrust into him over, and over again. His orgasm crashed over him and he came with a shout as his come splattered over the side of the island he was bent over, Rogers continued his pounding into Steven until he came a little while later and Steven felt the heat of cum fill his hole. Rogers pulled out and Steven crumpled to the floor.
“Well, how ‘bout I do my first drawing’ to thank the guy who got me this wonderful book.” Steve was already opening the book to the first page and taking one of his new pencils in his hands.
"Yes, when they first emerged last night I took scans and measurements for the file master Bruce composed when the back pain started. I deemed it a good idea to get scans and measurements regularly to see changes in them."
Steve had just gotten control of his face from their tumble together on the floor, but this sent him over the edge. He broke out in giggles, Tony and Bucky both looking at him like he was a loon as he completely lost it. Bucky’s face dropped and turned to a pout, which did nothing to curb Steve’s laughter.
“Jarvis give me visual.” Jarvis brought up some security footage and some cell phone footage, It was Loki. Great. “Wasn't Reindeer Games supposed to be imprisoned on Asgard?” No one answered him directly, but Clint could be heard yelling ‘oh hell no, I'm not dealing with that fucker now’ and Natasha radioing SHIELD to call Thor in. From what Tony could see Loki was in Times square where he was terrorizing people with giant stuffed animals. They both flew down and took down a giant teddy from attacking a group of pedestrians with cameras that were taking pictures of him and Cap.
"I'm going to go to my floor I'm feeling tired." Everyone turned towards him, Nat gave him that look like she could see right through him.
“back then I couldn’t, not like last night… I already looked the part, but they weren’t true, all those things the guys would call out at me. I didn’t do that. It wasn’t me.” Steve took a steadying breath and his wings stiffened and loosened, unable to decide what to do with himself. “‘Not sayin’ you were any worse for being that for me back then, but I couldn’t, but then I got all… Big, and then you were gone and then I was in the future and you were here but not, and-and-”
“Yes, I've actually had 5 children, but have only carried the one, Though I was a mare at the time.” Loki could see the amazement in the mortals' eyes, he smiled down at him. “Would you like to hear about them?”
Here we are guys, the baby is on the way. I would also like to send a big shout out to JustSynapses for the wonderful art they did based on this story, you can find it on their Instagram @ just_synapses
Tony let go of Steve and he let out a whine, but Tony shushed him and leaned over to the bedside table where he pulled out some lube. Tony did not know that Steve still had enough blood in his upper body to blush, but he did when Tony caught him looking between the lube and Tony. Tony chuckled and raised himself up on his knees, but still over Steve's thighs, he uncapped the lube and squeezed some onto his hand rubbing it between his fingers to warm it. He then put his other hand on Steve's sternum for stability and kept eye contact with Steve as he reached around his body and swirled his fingers around his rim, Steve's pupils were blown the bright blue now just slivers of color. Tony’s fingers slowly swirled around before he pushed his forefinger in up to the first knuckle and out again.
"Damnit! Jarvis, why am I locked out of my own system?" Tony's voice growled out into the otherwise, silent lab.
Tony nodded and walked off deeper into the lab to his area, his mind already running with the information he was given. Steve wasn't due for his bi-monthly check up with Bruce for 2 weeks he knew because he made sure to be in his lab so he could get a glimpse of those abs as the doctor worked on him. And no, he wasn't stalking or obsessed with Steve, he just could appreciate the aesthetic pleasure of viewing human perfection.
It was that look that Loki saw on Steve’s face as he felt the first stirrings of life under his magic.
“Steve, you need to change out of those pj pants, go put on those jeans that make your ass look so good.” Steve flushed and nodded as he got up and made his way to their room to change. “leave the harness and shirt off, I have something for you.”
“Fine, I'll take it off too.” Steve chucked and tried to sound exasperated by Tony but just ended up sounding fond and kind. He reached under his arm to unclasp the hook that kept the straps pulled tight and the leather fell from his wings, for a moment nothing moved and Tony got a dark look, then Steve’s wings slowly undulated from behind his back and pulled around Tony but not fully enclosing them, as if to say ‘see I'm fine’. Tony reached up and caressed down the golden feathers on the insides, Steve shivered at the feeling of Tony’s hands on his wings.
Steven watched as Rogers walked over to the bed where Tony was now lounging and idly stroking his cock as he watched the two of them. Rogers stepped up to Tony and Tony licked his lips before he took Rogers into his mouth again, he timed his hand with the movement of his mouth and soon Rogers was making moans. Tony quickened the pace, but his hand stayed in rhythm. Rogers’ hips stuttered and he threw his head back as he came down Tony’s throat, Steven saw Tony's Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed all of Rogers’ cum and then pulled off with a wet sound. Tony started to move his hand faster, but Rogers caught his wrist and leaned over to whisper something in his ear that made him groan and stop jerking himself altogether. Rogers backed away and walked over to where Steven was still laying on the floor, he crouched down and effortlessly picked Steven’s limp body up, then tossed him on the bed like a sack of potatoes, Steven landed on the other side of Tony.
“stop reading that garbage, we knew that the media would one day find out.” Steve looked up at Tony with a defeated look on his face.
In the midst of Tony’s exclamation Bucky had snuck around and wrapped her in his wings, then forced his own t-shirt over her, Steve chuckled as he watched Bucky try to wrangle Tony into the clothing.
"Ok Rogers. it's four days, you can do this for four days." Steve rallied himself and decided if he couldn't leave his floor then he would see what these wings could really do.
“If you ever feel uncomfortable, you don’t have to answer any question you don’t want to and we will stop immediately, you control everything that happens and you don’t have to do anything you don’t feel comfortable doing. If you want we can just leave now and let Pepper deal with the media.” Tony paused for a minute. “You don’t always have to be strong Steve, no one will look down on you for not going out there. You don’t always have to be the Captain, just be Steve. Ok?” Steve gave Tony a weary smile.
He quickly checked the route to the cell and found it had about 15 HYDRA agents that he would run into in the way, not counting the ones that would come once the heard what was happening. He put a bullet in the guard for the cameras head and left the room, sprinting down the corridors to Tony’s cell.
“That’s good.” Tony whispered directly into Steve’s ear so he wouldn’t wake Bucky. Steve just hummed in response and set down the sketch and leaned back to give Tony a kiss before he got up and left the room with Tony trailing behind him. They made their way out into the living room and sat on the large sofa together while some early morning television played in the background.
Steve’s hips pick up speed and loose the rhythm that they had before, he bumps his nose against Tony’s jaw but his breathing is heavy and Tony can tell he is close. A couple thrusts later Steve bites down on the junction between Tony’s neck and shoulder, Tony cries out and Steve is coming in his pants. Tony feels Steve’s cock twitch with every spurt of cum.
They stayed like that for a while before they both let go and gasped in sync, there was a blinding light and then there was only one, Captain Steven Grant Rogers was one whole being again. Memories and feelings from both perspectives played in his head before he came back to himself fully. Rogers had been naked so he was wearing Steve’s clothes, he took inventory of his body and found that everything was right, the bruises from last night were gone and everything was back to normal...almost.
Tony was jolted awake by the call to assemble the lights flashing in his room pulling him out of his slumber. Steve’s perpetual warmth against him was gone. Tony sat up and saw Steve gazing sadly at his shield.
Steve glanced up to take another look at the scene before him, having a little trouble with the shading of Bucky's feathers, and he catches Tony’s eye.
Bucky doesn’t have to ask Jarvis to know where Steve is. He has been in the same place the whole time since Tony was taken. The workshop.
“Now, now, that is not how you treat the person who saved your life. I'll ignore it this time because of shock, but I won’t be lenient with disrespect in the future.” Loki crossed his legs and examined his nails. Tony looked from Steve to Bucky for an answer and Steve took a deep breath before he explained what happened.
“W-what?” Steven stammered out, but Rogers leaned over and quieted him with a hand around his chin, he roughly turned Steven’s face so he was looking at him and licked his lips again.
"Can you show me the camera feed on my back?" Jarvis didn't verbally reply, instead, a screen popped up in front of him with his back in it. First, he tried experimenting with flexing his muscles nothing much moved that shouldn't have. Maybe it was just the inflammation and his sleep clouded mind, He allowed his shoulders to relax which he had been unconsciously holding close to his body since he woke, he quickly tensed again when his back looked like it - fluttered? Is that the word for it? His heart was in his throat. What happened to him? Is he going to die? Bruce hadn't been able to get results from the remains of his suit on what the compound was, was he going to turn into one of those...those things in the lab?
