Peter squinted his eyes a little, wearily. “Fine.” He repeated, leaning back so his back hit the cushions.
’ because MJ had been demanding that he read it for around his entire life up to date and he thought he’d humour her. Turns out, he actually does love the book.
Huffing a little to try and relieve the pressure sitting in his chest, he pushed himself off his door and headed into his bathroom, trying to comb out his mop of curls on the top of his head.
“Fine but can you make sure that any injuries I sustain aren’t life-threatening: I don’t have health insurance.”
“Watch your language, Tony,” Steve reprimanded, frowning. “But, uh, yes. Clint had an incident with the toaster.”
Steve navigated them through the small crowd of people doing some Christmas shopping, up to the food court before turning to them.
Logically, he knew they wouldn’t try anything as they were in a building that was crawling with civilians and killing a fourteen-year-old street rat probably wasn’t good for press. But he could tell he was going to sleep for a while when he finally drifted off, way through the night where fewer people would be around.
The teen was spasming in his sheets, twisting and turning so they were trapping his legs and arms, small whimpers and sobs escaping his throat.
Peter found himself relaxing as he watched the movie and shoveled salty popcorn into his mouth, laughing along with Clint and snuggling into the warmth of the blanket. It was halfway through the movie when the popcorn was finished and Clint asked him if he’d like anything else to eat.
“No, I’m good thanks, Clint.” Peter smiled a little, shifting slightly. Clint smiled back, but it seemed forced and his body tensed.
“Are you sure?” She asked, “Moving in with them, under those circumstances, must be a very trying experience, you can talk to me about anything, that’s what I’m here for.”
Peter could feel their eyes on him but decided that he was going to be stubborn and not look back, eating quickly so he could retreat to his room quicker. Just as he was about to get up to take his plate to the dishwasher, thankful he managed to eat in record time, Tony spoke up.
“If you get hungry or want something to eat, there will be stuff in the kitchen in the common room for you to eat. But don’t ask Clint for anything, he’s banned from kitchen duty for a week.”
In truth, the shopping trip was mostly going good until Peter had to try on some clothes for sizing and fit into age 14 clothing. He had sat down in the changing room cubicle and silently heaved through a panic attack with hands clamped over his mouth until Tony asked if he was okay and come in when there was no response.
“When Hitler stole pink rabbit.” Peter supplied quietly, shuffling his feet slightly because he knew why Tony was here.
Tony almost beamed and then gently led him through a hallway by the kitchen which had four doors in it.
Stephen didn’t say anything, but turned back to the clipboard in his hands, clicking his pen so he could begin to write.
Peter followed Tony out, shutting his bedroom door behind him and stopping in the living room where Steve was eating a protein bar and reading something on his phone.
“Did you tell her about the foster homes, and about Garret?” That was Wanda this time, and Peter slowly felt the anger building up inside him.
“You wanna talk about last night?” Steve asked gently, and Peter felt heat flush down his entire face and he looked away from both of them.
He wondered what Peter had seen, out in the streets of New York as a young boy. Sitting day after day in cold alleys and wishing he was anywhere else but there. He found himself yearning to march into Peter’s room and wrap him up in a million blankets and hand feed him homemade food and tell him he was safe and would be taken care of.
“Burger for me please, sweetums.” Tony batted his eyelashes at Steve who rolled his eyes and turned to Peter.
He was tempted to state that he was ‘all better now, let’s get the fuck out of here’, but Annie had been really nice to him and was now looking at him with kind eyes and a warm smile that reminded him too much of May for him to say anything other than: “It was okay.”
He stirs slowly, rubbing his eyes with a fist as he yawns, and moves his legs, only to find they are resting on something.
“Just routine checks, he’ll need to check your chest again to see how the infection is.” Peter just nodded and they stayed in comfortable silence until the doors opened and they were met with Steve, smiling with hands buried in his pockets.
No, he couldn’t do that, that was petty and mean and not what they deserved (even if they had been total asshats by not asking him if he wanted therapy). He wasn’t even sure why he was so against going to therapy, he knew a lot of people would kill to be able to get the help they needed but not being able to afford it, so he was lucky really.
“Do you need any help unpacking everything?” Steve asked, rummaging through one of the bags from the homeware store to get out the sets of sheets to wash before putting them away.
“Thank you.” He paused. “And- And I’m sorry too. For not telling you where I was going or when I’d be back. I’m just not used to someone caring that much.” He whispered the last part hoarsely, glancing up briefly to see Steve and Tony’s faces soften completely.
“Pete’s gonna go down and watch a film with Clint, god save him.” He picked up a flask of coffee and took a sip. “Ready to go, captain?”
“Kids at school.” Tony looked up from his tablet, one eye raised but didn’t say anything, which Peter was thankful for.
“It’s fine. I’m just not hungry.” Peter said sharply towards Tony who had been speaking, face flushing red as he avoided eye contact.
Peter suddenly sat bolt upright, panting heavily with a thin sheen of sweat covering him and hands shaking in front of his torso.
The drive was mostly silence on his part, Tony and Steve doing most of the talking in a quiet voice as they moved through midday traffic.
Peter set down his book that he had been reading and pushed the blanket he was using to the side, standing up slowly.
The voices stop, and he blinks around a little to find out that he’s lying horizontally and what his legs are laying on is Steve.
He tried protesting, even offering that he would prefer one of the older models but Tony had refused and Peter had been too emotionally drained to argue. So, he was sat with his phone that now contained Steve’s, Tony’s, Clint’s and Sam’s (for emergencies) and Ned’s numbers. He would’ve added MJ’s too if he had it.
But, Steve sort of reminded him of how aunt May used to soothe him after a nightmare, with a soft voice and soothing touches. And if he closed his eyes for long enough, he could probably pretend he was with aunt May.
“Now, although we are going to talk about the importance of why you need to tell us where you are going when you go somewhere and the necessity of having a phone, we wanted to ask you why you didn’t tell us where you were going?” Peter could see out of the corner of his eye Tony was trying to make eye contact but didn’t lift his head.
It wasn’t like himself and the two men across from him were like family, but they had some sort of dynamic where they cared for him and that made him antsy in the worst way possible.
They watched the rest of tangled in relative contentment, the only noises coming from their spoons and their eating in comfortable silence. Just as the film was ending, he felt his eyes drooping low, relaxed and warm and full doing wonders for his sleep schedule, and he set the empty tub on the coffee table before burrowing under the blankets further, resting his head on the sofa cushions behind him.
“No.” Peter just replied, not looking at anyone in the room, head still thrown back on soft clean pillows.
“Good competition?” Peter manages to ask Tony when the older man joins him on the bench outside the shop.
Sam whistled before taking a sip out of a glass of orange juice, “Damn kid, you gotta be smart. My nephew tried to get a scholarship for Midtown – didn’t get it.”
“Where the hell have you been?” He demanded, eyebrows creased and eyes worried. Peter raised his eyebrows, looking around the common floor to see Clint, Sam, Wanda, and Natasha all gathered in the kitchen, silent.
“It’s okay, kid.” Tony was now back in the room, when did that happen? “You can get some sleep; you must be shattered.”
“I see you finally found the tv, about time kid.” Tony jokes and Peter raises a small smile, before turning to Dr. Strange who is beginning to put on rubber gloves.
So, all in all, the past day or so hadn’t been brilliant, especially since he hadn’t given Steve or Tony a chance to talk to him; until now.
“Come on. Deep breaths, in and out. Just like that.” Steve slowly coached his breathing, and Peter had no other choice but to obey, in fear of passing out around the four unknown men.
“No,” Steve responds this time, gentle. “We won’t be your parents. More like caregivers or just someone who makes sure you go to school and eats your vegetables and stuff.”
“I’m prescribing you two weeks of the fast-metabolism antibiotics. You will also need to eat as much as possible over the next few weeks, to regain your strength, I would suggest things high in fats and carbs. Drinks like orange juice and milk would also be appreciated.”
The room was spacious, but not so big it made him uncomfortable, and he could feel some tension slipping from his shoulders just from that. There was a large double bed in the middle of one wall adorned with a thick duvet and four huge pillows all dressed in the same grey and navy chequered bedding.
“Okay well, that seems doable. We just need to check some basic things and fill out some forms and you should be all good to return next Monday.” She smiled, turned to her computer and clicked a few times before beginning her line of questions.
“It’s just-” He squeaked, mortified. “-Teenagers and young adults will be your biggest sales group because they are the most tech-savvy. But your phones and tablets are too expensive for students and younger adults with starter jobs. Plus, parents are reluctant to buy their kid's such expensive phones because, well, they're just kids.”
Whilst she typed in the numbers, her nails clicking on the keyboard was all that was heard save for the shuffling of Peter’s feet on the carpet floors.
“So, I hear you’ve not eaten much of your lunch?” Stephen says immediately upon coming into his room on the med bay. He raises his eyes from his chart to look at Peter.
Tony’s head was resting on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve’s arm was thrown around Tony’s waist. It was especially nice because he could feel the atmosphere around him was warm and cosy, found in the way that Tony stole Steve’s popcorn even though he had his own bowl and in the way, Steve huffed as though he was annoyed and then kissed Tony’s forehead.
Staring up at the ceiling, he tried shutting his eyes and going to sleep, but he was anxious and he could hear the sales meetings going on a few floors above which was making his skin crawl. So he sat up, looking around the pristine white room for something to do.
“I’m also requesting we get something to eat. I’m starved.” Tony groaned, opening the door for Steve and Peter to walk out into the hallway.
Peter felt lighter upon walking back into Stark Tower, a smile etched onto his face and a spring in his step. He had almost forgotten that he had lied to get out he was that happy until the elevator doors opened and he stepped out into the common floor.
“Can I not just get the subway?” Both Steve and Tony looked dubious, eyebrows knitting together in concern.
He stayed quiet through the entire process of making next week’s appointment, saying goodbye to Annie and the car journey back to the Tower. He could see Steve looking at him in the rear-view mirror, but didn’t look back.
“God, you’re shivering. Let’s get you back downstairs and into bed.” Steve fussed, opening the door open again so Peter could walk out first.
“Peter?” Sam asked when the game ended, waving the controller in what was supposed to be an enticing way. “You know you want to.”
Peter flushed red and immediately broke eye contact, staring down at his feet with his hands buried deep in his hoodie pockets.
Steve turned off the bedside lamp and then clambered in on the other side so they were either side of the distressed boy.
A sudden whirring noise made him jump, and he followed the noise to be the cupboard doors opening and a flat screen folding out already on and ready to go. He clutched the remote with sweaty hands, and hastily set it to the side before gently speaking again:
A few days ago, Tony had asked him why he wasn’t wearing his new clothes and Peter had begun flushing and stuttering and so Steve had jumped in with a
“Hey, it’s okay. You’re safe, Pete. You’re alright.” Steve said quickly, and Peter looked over to him, before letting out a few shaky breaths and reaching up to wipe his forehead.
Whilst Bruce gathered all the materials, he would need for the IV, Peter strained his ears to listen to the conversation happening outside the door, but due to his fatigue and lack of concentration he could only catch a few words.
“I’ll answer your question right now, don’t worry.” Yuri shushes Flynn with a finger, “So while I don’t feel romantic attraction, I still feel urges of a sort to a person. One other type of attraction I do feel is aesthetic attraction, which essentially means looks. I like your hair, your face, your body, etc. So I’m just attracted to you in a different way than romantically, nothing bad. And on the other hand while I am fine with having sex, it does nothing for me, it hardly brings me pleasure, it’s just a chore unless I’m doing it for my partners pleasure which is another story.”
Tony looked stunned at the sudden declaration as he tried to process her statement, Steve, Bucky, Natasha, and Clint looking at her with unreadable expressions.
There was a short silence that was broken by Natasha’s incredulous voice, “Is that really a hard standard?”
“Why though? Just for fun?” Theo asked, but shrinked back a little in fear, seeming surprised when Harry just smiled at him.
“Yes really, I still love you now and it’s been 5 months since we broke up.” Yuri says, a bemused smile on his lips.
“That’s great love, you’re doing amazing, just relax and let me take care of you.” Tony continues to sweet talk in Steve’s ear as he unknots Steve’s back, where Steve just groans in response as all the stress is taken away from him. Soon Tony finishes with the massage and squirts some shampoo onto his hand, wets Steve's hair and then scraps his fingernails with the shampoo through his hair.
“Yea I got over my crush on Hikari and realized that I like you, we’ll have to talk more tomorrow cause there’s still stuff to say, but for now let’s sleep.”
Tony collapsed onto the bed, stretching and relaxing all his muscles. They all just got back from a rather long mission and they were all bone tired.
“Well we have around 14 hours of flight so it’ll be good for you guys to sleep.” Veemon suggests, watching how the three droop.
“Oh of course, he’s just like me, almost.” Yufine says, staring them down, “The difference is that I am a full fledged dragon and he’s just a vessel. He’s unable to do anything I could do.”
“Why do you think I call him my dear star? He is deadly but shines just as bright as the most innocent of beings.” Elena says.
“You can do Nat first.” Wanda softly said, smiling at Tony and Natasha as they turned, a question mark in their eyes.
Lady Artemis friends- Friends that are allowed to talk to Tony without being ignored, not close to initiate conversation and know any secrets. Current: 0
Harry immediately went to the large couch, tossing his stuff under the table with a sigh, as he sunk into the soft seat. The other followed at a slower pace, as Cedric and Theo took the open spots next to Harry, and Viktor and Fleur took the single couches.
“I should hex the shit outta Ron for giving Mione this idea, I swear the next bet we make I’ll make my reward Ron dressing up in a dress and Mione in a tuxedo. Serves them right for making me wear panties. How would I have known that I would receive over 100 letters?” Harry growled lightly as he thought of the mass letters arriving at his table.
“Fine fine.” Then in a completely unexpected move, Cedric dips Harry down, who whines in surprise, and then closes his mouth over Harry’s  in a sweet but chaste kiss.
Jishuka confusedly glanced with the other before she shrugged, she went over to a rock and sat down, the others following her lead with Grid sitting across from Jishuka.
“They can come back and forth through these Chaos Rifts?” Chrom said, trying too wrap his head around the rifts.
Tony incredulously stared at Natasha, “I was part of a team with a demigod, a Hulk, a super soldier, and a super spy. The only one I felt even remotely close to in strength would be Clint since he was relatively human like me. I needed a way to be on par with the rest of the team.”
“Sure sure.” Tony waves a hand towards Bellissima, “You can go visit Ghiaccio, but make sure to bring him some puffs.”
Tony blushed, which had nothing to do with nerves and more to do with the fact that Steve was coming.
“You have nightmares?” Chrom asked in concern, even if he was slightly fearful of Robin being a vessel of Grima, he was still his friend, “Why didn’t you mention it?”
“What…” Chrom trails off as he spots the mysterious Harpist coming towards them slowly, before he can warn her for the risen, a bolt of lightning zap right past her cheek, who doesn’t even blink, as it kills the risen behind her.
As Tony starts to massage Steve’s scalp, Steve relaxes even more under the ministrations, groaning in complete pleasure. Soon Tony finishes and rinses Steve off and Tony pulls him up to his feet and onto the towel by the tub. Steve gets up looking like he’s about to dry himself off but he sees Tony lift up a towel in front of him. Steve steps into Tony’s embrace and sloches against Tony as he rubs the towel up and down Steve’s body to get him to relax. Soon Tony finishes and Tony grabs him and leads him out the bathroom and into the bedroom and slides a pair of boxers on Steve, then lays him down.
“Mr Stark. Captain Rogers. My names are Mrs. Lowitz.” She greeted, extending a hand for them to shake; which they did. “Lovely to be meeting with you.” She flattened the back of her skirt as she sat back down, crossing one leg over the other before gesturing for them to sit.
“Ready?” Tony poked his head through the door, smiling. Peter just nodded, stepping out behind the other man.
“Even if you think that I’m still supposed to help you with whatever you need.” She said gently, not once getting mad or even indicating that she was angry.
“So, a new family again huh? These ones any good?” He smiled a little sadly but Peter just sat down on his bed and plopped Neds stuffed R2D2 on his lap.
Maybe if he just shut his eyes for a minute, that would fend off the lingering fatigue. That was probably a bad idea, but he was used to them.
“Hey!” Ned greeted excitedly after he opened the window and Peter began lifting himself through. “I haven’t seen you in ages, dude. Where have you been?”
“We need to talk.” Peter paused from where he was pouring himself a glass of water at the sound of Steve’s voice and he turned around to face both males who were dressed and stood on the opposite side of the island.
They quickly arrived at Daisuke’s room, where Takeru looked around in wonder as Daisuke quickly got ready.
Flynn just stares at Yuri, eyes full of hope, wonder, affection, and resentment towards himself, and nuzzles into Yuri’s chest as he answers, “Yes, please.” He takes a moment to think, “Can we start now?”
Tony smiles as he looks down at a bleary eyed Steve and bends down and kisses the top of Steve’s head, “Goodnight honey.”
Aether turns around and sees that everyone, including the two archons, is processing Aether’s statement.
Tony winced sympathetically before he reached over and pulled Steve up, leading him to the bedroom, “I have an idea on how to destressify you.”
“This is Bucky Barnes.” Brown head #2 gave a small, almost unnoticeable, smile as he offered a head nod.
Tony looks up and just looks at Steve’s earnest expression, his bright blue eyes lit with affection, adoration, honesty, and love all aimed at Tony.
“All right, well what can I get you?” Tony got up and walked over to them as he looked at them expectantly.
“No can do kiddo.'' Davis affectionately ruffled their hair, listening to them complaining, “We have to leave so take Sunmon and Moonmon and start to get ready.”
After the shock wore off, everyone started to excitedly talk about their pseudo-quest and about what they were going to search for. Regas grabbed Grid and was tossing him up and down, always catching him protectively, while the others shared secretive and knowing smiles at the obvious chemistry between Regas and Grid.
“But I can’t rest. I have two internships along with some practical classes for Mechanical engineering.” Tony immediately shut his mouth, face pale as he revealed this.
Daisuke just grinned as he nodded in acceptance, “Sure sure, lemme just get Veemon over here and then I can explain.”
“Oh for fucks sake.” Tony groaned before he reached over and popped his shoulder back in place in one fluid motion. He then grabbed two wooden spoons that he had for this very occasion, and splintered his left arm in them, tying them with two rubber bands.
“Not permanently no.” Robin shakes his head, much to Chrom’s relief, “But I do want to go visit since I have many friends there, they’ll also possibly visit here so that's another option.”
“It means to be on part of the Armoantic or Asexual specturm. I’m actually part of both. Aromantic means to not feel romantic attraction and Asexual means to not seel sexual attraction.”
“Honey we’ve literally been all over the world there’s literally nowhere left to go, at all.” Tony gently stroked Bellissima's head.
“All right Darling, be careful.” Olivia leans up and kisses Yuri again, before walking off with the kids.
“What the fuck.” Clint whispered in shock, all of those were classes that required intense hours of studying and this kid was doing them all this semester.
Steve and Bucky took the other recliner, basically laying on top of each other, while Liepard hid in the shadows and Braviary perched on the wooden peg a foot above the couch.
“So essentially you’re gonna give us amazing armor and weapons, free of charge?” Regas said, unable to believe what he was hearing.
“Agreed we’ll fly him over to mine and Rhodey’s Malibu home, you’ll all be invited also.” Pepper immediately got a devious smile, staring straight at Steve making him sweat slightly, “Especially Steve, we’ll make Steve Tony’s caretaker.”
Tony sighed, running a hand through oil coated hair as he walked towards the school library at his college. He took a deep gulp of his piping hot black coffee, inhaling the rich scent. This past week he’s been up 24/7, pulling all nighters every day, as he studied for all of his exams, including but not limited to Physics, Organic Chemistry, Calculus 3, Philosophy, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Quantum Physics/Quantum Mechanics, Biology, Anatomy, and Physiology. He knows he shouldn’t have taken so many hard classes this semester but he had 1 year left on his Ph.D for Mechanical Engineering and he wanted to get his other classes ready for his other Phds.
The two continued on their way, the walk filled with talking about themselves and quiet caresses as they basked in each other's presence.
Aether giggled at the whispered curses aimed at Zhongli’s direct attitude before responding, “Yea but I’ve had a long, long time to get over my parents death, this is just something I do every year.”
“Why does she need to protect herself?” Estelle, sweet, innocent Estelle who is constantly worried about everyone, asks.
Robin hums, thinking how to best reply, “They’re people I met when I traveled to another world after I accidentally fell through their Chaos Rift.”
“I accept your proposal for my pardon.” Wanda says, staring Tony dead in the eyes to show that she isn’t lying.
“Come on, let’s go back to Angel’s share and I can answer any question you guys have.” Aether joyfully waves his hand to the dumbstruck group as the come over to Aether, all choosing to walk back to Monstandt.
Yuri just stares softly at Flynn, resolving to fix him and help him, “You don’t need to apologize, I understand. It’ll take a bit, and a lot of talking on both of our parts, but if you want, we can create something new so that this doesn’t happen again, we’ve both changed in these last 5 months so we need to discuss everything.”
“I vote we tie him to bed and not let him escape for the rest of his life. He’s too precious and works too hard.” Natasha said, straight to the point.
“Well I-I w-was wondering…..” Steve trailed off, stuttering and blushing as he tried to get the words out, “Maybe you want to go on a date with me?” He shyly ended, looking hopeful.
“Don’t worry I got this.” Tony got out a large pot that he filled up with cocoa powder, sugar, vanilla extract, and some salt.
“There ain’t anyone in the kitchen to come take your orders, I’m the only worker here. JOCASTA and JARVIS are AI’s that I personally coded to help me out in the shop.” Tony smirked as he saw the stunned expressions on everyone’s faces’.
Tony waved, turning his head back and smiling, causing Meg to laugh. “Correction, they're Lady Hestia friends already.”
After a rather hard mission in the mountains, Tony, Natasha, and Wanda just want to eat dinner and relax together in bed.
“So because of that she’s been able to fight and capture every assassin sent after her, so she’s sufficiently capable of protecting my kids and herself.” Yuri finishes, as they all stop at a cafe and order some coffee.
Jean, Amber, Lisa, and Kaeya arrived there first, finding spots to sit on the ground. After came Rosaria, Bennett, and Barbara, and after greeting each other, sat down. Lastly came Diluc, Zhongli, Xiao, Tartaglia, Ganyu, Albedo, and Klee and after some silent greetings, everyone sat in silence waiting for Aether to appear.
“Ohh.” Tony mutters before he waves the team around him. The team comes to sit around him, all of them making sure they can keep an eye on him. “All I did was relocate my dislocated shoulder and splinted my broken ulna and radius.”
“What are you making?” Wanda asked from where she was leaning on the door, right next to a lone Natasha.
Tony’s thoughts rambled as he walked in through the door to the library, immediately turning right to go to the coffee shop.
‘Elena.’ Robin thinks, ignoring Vaike who’s complaining about watching his back, and quickly flips to the back of his book, “Thoron.”
A large bolt of lightning immediately eradicates everything in his path as Robin moves with reckless abandon towards the noise, ignoring all risen not in his path. After a tense 2 minutes he eventually comes to a stop as he spots Elena playing her harp and shooting starlight at the enemies.
Yuri grins at how cute Flynn iis before thinking, “Well one thing I can think off is that I found out I’m part of the Aspec community.”
So like thanks to everyone for putting up with my, frankly, shitty writing (Honest opinion here, I think I suck and I'm not saying this for sympathy, I just honestly think I suck so I don't know how anyone likes my stories lol) and my horrible update schedule even if I say I'll update, I haven't had much of a motivation to write much stories, been spending my days grinding in my gacha games (I brought in 2 of my fav characters from Epic Seven, Elena and Yufine, who have an amazing story), reading fanfiction, and playing games on my ds.
“Goodnight my love.” Chrom tugs Robin closer, pushing his head to rest over his heart, as he wraps his arms tight around his shoulders.
First was Alexander Motomiya, a bright and cheerful boy who’s always willing to help Daisuke out with anything. He has windswept blonde hair that he constantly brushes out of the way, and bright emerald green eyes showing off curiosity benefiting a 12 year old. His partner was Moonmon whose final digivolution was Dianamon, an Olympian.
“Uhh what happened last night?” Cedric asked, caution evident in his tone, as he stared at the massive pile of weapons.
Harry burned bright red as he saw Cedric nod to him, quickly waving back before he walked over to the Gryffindor table, sitting on the side where he could see the rest of the tables.
“Yep, it’s basically like having every single piece of information in the world in me. I even have Friday inside me where she can monitor me for hackers or viruses.”
“Oi who are you kids calling the old drunk? Didn’t your father teach you manners.” A gruff voice broke through as another guy came to them.
Chrom breathes in relief, seeing as Robin isn’t angry, “Yes I do. I think I have for a while, but I just started noticing how my feelings toward you are. I didn’t want to say it right after finding out you were a vessel for Grima, since I wasn’t sure how you’d react so I waited. I decided right now would be the best time to say it.”
“What the hell do you mean they ARE realistic? They are not at all. If you don’t let go of your standards then you’ll never find a mate, that’s why I go with you to pick from my standards.” Tony grouched as he set Bellissima down on the couch cushion in front of him.
Rita even sometimes dropped her haughty attitude, an attitude she gained to protect herself and Karol in the orphanage, and allowed herself to let Yuri cuddle them close and kiss their heads, even allowing it in Public in time.
Alright first of all, sorry for this looooong waiting period. I've been really busy with school and trying to take breaks and studying and everything I didn't have much time to write at all. I also got one BNHA story in the works where Izuku has the quirk to use the evil pieces from DxD to reincarnate (after prior approval from them) people into his "servants". And I gott another Harry Potter fic which is a gaming Harry Potter since I love the idea. Sorry for my other uncompleted stories, sometimes when I write I get the urge to get a story out but then after around one chapter my brain dies with ideas so most stories will be quick one shots from now on. I think the only chapter one will be Tony's Kids but only cause that's rather easy to do for me I don't know why.
“She ain’t coming here to take our orders.” The metal arm guy asked, looking in between Tony and the kitchen.
“I know you can protect them, god knows you need it.” Yuri heaves a sigh as he thinks about why she needs to protect herself.
“Hmmm.” Tony paused to think as everyone leaned forward, “I was experimenting with something called nanobots, and I injected them into myself before I programmed them so they went a little crazy and ate half of my heart, half of my stomach, part of my lungs, my liver and various other organs in my body.”
Yuri’s eyes widened as he stared at her form, “Olivia Montague what a surprise to see you here my dear.”
It was a pretty large room with 4 sets of doors, one for the pool outside, one for the closet, one for the bathroom, and one for exit and entrance. The bed was nestled next to the bathroom and closet door, as the pool door was across from them surrounded by a floor to ceiling glass pane. Closets and dressers were scattered throughout the room, and a large plush green rug sat in the middle of the room.
I also have like 10 other story's I'm working on so hopefully I should get at the very least 3-4 out in the next month, hopefully.
Olivia giggled as she leaned up to give a quick peck to Yuri’s lips, expertly ignoring Flynn’s strangled breath, “My my darling what a way to greet a woman.”
“Relax already Dai, everything will be fine.” Veemon gave Daisuke a rather irritated glare, as Alexander and Tsuki started to play with Coronamon and Lunamon off to the side.
“Raspeball and Sodd for me and my brother. Thor and Loki.” Thor waved a hand between him and the sullen brown haired guy, Loki.
The three bots whined as they whired forward with the plates, the group laughing behind him. Tony placed all the plates down as the others dunked down to eat the food they ordered, all offering praise to the holy food. After around 1 hour of eating and drinking they all got up to leave.
For the next few hours Daisuke regaled them with tales of his adventure, showing them he’s the CEO of the Hakamura group, the noodle company chain stores. That news completely shocked everyone as they never expected hyperactive Daisuke to become someone of such high importance.
Silence filled the gaps as they all tried to process the fact that the bots, the loveable bots, who they thought were just simple AI, were that advanced to help him with everything in the lab.
“Ahhh that was good.” Tony stretched as much as he could, considering he was still in Steve’s arms, before he bonelessly collapsed on Steve, “I’m taking a nap now.”
Chrom says nothing, tilting his head in consideration, absorbing the influx of information. Chrom doesn’t know what to do with this, considering that this is the first time he’s met people from another world, and that these are the first Chaos Rifts they’ve ever encountered.
“What can you do?” Hermione whispered as everyone in the Great Hall leaned away. Hermione grabbed a large bag that she dragged in and opened it right in front of Harry, and much to the shock of everyone, weapons of all kinds piled out.
“Please tell me you weren’t as stupid as I thought to do what you said last year.” Pepper begged, voice pleading.
“A-alright.” Tony moved his hand, shaking from the shock, as he grabbed some papers and handed them over to Wanda, “Signing at the bottom of each page shows that you accept the proposal made by Stark Lawyers and that you agree to the listed rules.”
“Fine fine, wake us if we’re not already up by then.” Daisuke mumbles, slouching backward as Alexander and Tsuki slouch on him.
Tony winced, knowing how the team would take it with his answer, “Yes. All the times I said I was fine was because I had no idea what injuries I had, I always had Jarvis, and now Friday, scan me and see what injuries I have.”
Tony smiled as he stared at the other’s having fun and acting like little kids. He thought about all of their pasts and how this moment makes it all worth it, moments they can act with nothing in the world holding them down. No kidnapping, no missions, no world saving business, no torture, and no bad pasts holding them down. All that matters is now and the people around them.
So Digimon is literally one of my most favorite fandoms, alongside Pokemon. They will always be my top two favorite things, the characters, the movies, just everything about them is so beautiful and they're both made me cry more times than I can count in both happiness and sadness. So hope you enjoy my Daikeru, that I might write a few other oneshots later, we'll see.
“Brats go over with Olivia, she should be performing right now so you get to see her also.” Yuri says, glancing at Flynn, before he looks down at Rita and Karol.
Steve brought their faces gently together, landing in a gentle kiss that was neither desperate nor fast. They kissed for several minutes before they broke apart for air, Steve gently nuzzling his nose against Tony’s cheek.
Daisuke just glared back, “I know it will, doesn't mean I can’t be nervous,” Daisuke pauses as he takes a deep breath, “D-Do you think-”
“I would,” Taichi says, sharing a grin with the guy, “But you all already know him, so there’s no need to.”
While in Wakanda trying to get pardons for the rest of the Avengers, they learn that Tony has done something to himself.
Tony got up sliding a black apron over his head and tying it behind his back, unlocking the door and switching the sign to open. He wandered back to his chair in front of the cashier, pulling out his phone and answering texts from his four best friends, Virginia “Pepper” Potts, Happy Hogan, James “Rhodey” Rhodes, and Bruce Banner.
Tony let the calculations run through his mind as he walked leisurely to the library. “If I finish all of these classes with A’s this semester, next semester I should have only a few easy classes. Then hopefully I’ll have a 76.98% chance to relax my last year with practical work only. Though there is also a 56.6% chance that it will require more hands on experience than specified, which I will have a 45.8% chance to enjoy and a 67.89% chance to actually apply it when I get a job. Overall around a 63.56% chance that I’ll be able to hang out with Pepper and Rhodey more throughout my last year, though the percentage will go down since Pepper is busy with Law school and Rhodey wants to get his Mechanical degree done quick. I won’t be able to find any other Lady Hestia Friends, I do have Arthur but he’s in Lady Aphrodite which means not as much contact. I prefer not to get any Lady Artemis friends but it may sometime be inevitable. Meg the cashier at the coffee shop is also quickly becoming a Lady Aphrodite friend.”
‘It’s been a hell of a 5 months though.’ Yuri complained as he ruefully shook his head, thinking back to how everything happened.
“Great.” Pepper clapped her hands, the rest of the group cheering as they set up an inevitable date between them. “Now if you’ll excuse me, i have to get to class.”
After around 5 minutes everyone separated  but they made sure to stay close to Daisuke, as if making sure he didn’t disappear.
“D-Daisuke.” Ken uttered the name, causing stillness and silence to spread through the group as they stared.
She let out a groan, slamming her head down on her arms, startling all of the others around her including Tony.
Yuri just doesn’t care about feelings, can be interpreted as aromantic asexual Yuri Lowell. He also introduces his younger brother Karol to his longtime secret dance friend, Olivia Montague, a British Royal.
There was a guy with brown hair who was hanging an arm around a girl with bright red hair and massive serial killer vibes. Next was a large boisterous blonde and a quiet, sullen brown haired fellow in the back of the group. Finally there was a really hot buff blonde guy who had a shy smile as he talked with a brown haired guy with a metal prosthetic and a guy that looked pretty similar to Rhodey.
“Hmph.” Harry just turned his head as he heard the giggles of the others, “Anyway I need to go finish my christmas shopping so have fun.”
“Yea like the time that you shattered all the bones in Ron’s arms with  a mace.” Hermione dryly replies.
“For this.” Tony holds out his hand that contorts and then small tiny metal bugs fly out and over the food, eating it fast before flying back into Tony’s hand.
“Hmmm.” Harry hummed as he thought of a response, “Well it usually is just about anything you can think of. Homework help, doing someone’s essay, getting them food, etc. It can also be on a larger scale, like this bet that I just lost has me wearing Hermione’s panties for a full day. On another it was Ron and Mione loudly making out in the common room, and for the next bet I'm asking for Ron to wear a dress and Mione to wear a tuxedo.” Harry darkly mutters at the end.
Xiao, while still confused, responded, “Yes there should be a shop by the Jewellery store that sells all types of festive Lanterns.”
“Yea yea you say that everytime.” Raven impatiently waved his hand as he turned toward the group, “Anyway who are these bozos, you never hung out with your friends before, it’s always work, eat, play, sleep with your dumbass.”
“Ready as I’ll ever be I guess.” Daisuke shrugs, shuffling his nerves, “Thankfully Olivia is a good assistant and does an amazing job. Asher and Crise are great competitors and will help protect the company from untoward individuals.”
SilverPheonix asked me for a Tony Stark/Natasha Romanov/Wanda Maximoff fluff pairing so I tired. Most of them are rather short since it's after mission.
“Ah sorry Professor, I’m an avid weapons collector so I have a large variety of weapons.” Harry sheepishly said.
Regas turned pink as he looked away, “No not really, so I decided that I was going just come and help you today.”
To Tony’s right was the coffee making aspect with the regular fridge’s (Reach-in and undercounter) with several coffee machines to make frappe’s, smoothies, iced coffee, regular coffee, and espresso. All neatly organized into rows right next to the various sugars and spices.
“How are you still alive?” Bruce asks incredulity as he tries to think of a way Tony could have survived that.
Tony got a serious look on his face causing everyone to snap up, “If whatever I had on this server got out we would be having the bloodiest WWIII imaginable. Everyone would be killing everyone regardless of peace treaties between states.”
Tony got out two cups for him and Thor and after pouring some in he walked over to Thor and handed him one.
Meg laughed at the cute pout he made, quickly punching in his order as she grabbed a couple blueberry pastries and handed them to Tony after she put them in a bag.
“Mr. Potter why do you have so many weapons?” Flitwick came up, followed by the students and Sprout.
Tony just glances at Steve, confusion swimming in his eyes as he answers Bucky, “She went to visit Ghiaccio, a Walrein she met and battled on the Pacific ocean. She brought him here and after he was healed he submitted to me allowing me to call him when I want. I also have a Pelipper called Tempesta, a Sceptile named Boschetto, a Rhyperior named Monte, and a Milotic named Magnifica.”
‘Those two have definitely been the light of my life, especially after I got too busy to hang out with my friends.’ Daisuke mournfully thought, staring at a large group picture of the original digidestined along with the second group of them, staring particularly at a picture of a certain blonde named Takeru.
Pepper loudly gasped, the other jumping at the noise, “Really? But you’ve only had me and Rhodey in there for a while, and Arthur is in Lady Aphrodite.”
“What about you my dear star? Found a husband yet?” Elena teases Robin, ignoring the exclamations of “Husband?!?! Not Wife?”
“Oh?” Robin hums in interest, as he sits up straighter and crosses his legs. He knows this’ll be serious, especially froom how nervous Chrom looks all of a sudden, “I’m all ears, go ahead.”
Tony looked up, twisting his neck as he looked for who called him, finally seeing Pepper, beautiful red headed Pepper, standing next to a group of 7 people, all currently looking at him.
Steve stood back as the group walked out, all shooting smirks in Steve’s direction. Steve walked forward, Tony glancing up in confusion as he stared at the big hunk of muscle.
“You sir are grounded after this semester is over.” Pepper exclaimed, “I will force your ass in bed and sleep this entire summer.”
“Honey turn around I have to do your back, then your face and we’re done. I’ll also give you another massage once we get into bed.”
“I have to go back to the Tower for a few weeks to finish setting everything up and then I’ll also move back into the compound.”
Tony sighed as he gently picked up Bellissima and set her on his shoulder, “This girl here has been trying to find a mate for the last 5 years and she can’t find anyone that matches her standards. Even if her standard list is only one point long.”
“Hey there, I just got here after collecting everything.” Aether said, completely out of breath as he laid the flowers and lantern down on the ground.
“Absolute idiots all of you.” Tony huffed with a fond smile as he listened to his idiots discuss sharing his time.
“I said, I’m sorry.” Flynn repeats, still hunkering down but staring shyly at Yuri through his fringes.
Tony nods as he packs his stuff up and stands with Bruce and Thor, “Yea I got an extra quinjet for you guys to take to the compound if you want.”
Yuri just stared at her before breaking into a grin, “Don’t say I didn’t warn you,” He takes a deep breath, the others leaning forward in eagerness, even Flynn, “I work at Dahngrest as a tech assistant to Don Whitehouse, the CEO of Dahngrest.”
“I wish but we need to share him unfortunately.” Natasha smiled as feelings of envy rose within her also.
All the counters were made of well worn wood, all hand made by Tony himself, along with having Gardenia’s, Roses, and Freesia. All had handmade embroidery made in delicate patterns, made by his late mother, Maria Carbonell nee Stark, and his Aunt Peggy Carter.
“Stop drooling Clint before you drown us.” Natasha elbowed Clint in the side making him yelp and close his mouth, glaring darkly at Natasha.
Tony leaned back, serious expression being replaced with a carefree expression, “But the server they’d have to hack would be moi. Everything is in my head along with my nanobots.”
“Ummmm Physics, Organic Chemistry, Calculus 3, Philosophy, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Quantum Physics/Quantum Mechanics, Anatomy, and Physiology.” Tony said, blushing brightly at everyone’s stunned expression.
Daisuke called Veemon, letting the Digidestined process the information dumped on them. The call lasted 5 min as Veemon assured Daisuke that it’ll be taken care of, and he also said that Dai could bring them over for a massive sleepover at his house where Dai said he’ll let them know.
Taichi stares at Daisuke, not comprehending whatever it was that he said, before a lightbulb went off, making Taichi look at Daisuke in shock.
Tony lowers Steve into the water, who groans in pleasure as the hot water caresses his skin and soothes his aching muscles.
Tony gathered some soap before he started the same treatment on Natasha. He started at her shoulders, soothing the knots of tension he felt before he went down her arms, Natasha releasing moans of appreciation as he worked out the knots through there. He eventually finished with the arms before he went down her back and legs soothing all the muscles.
“You’ve had this your whole life? Even while we were a small team?” Natasha questions, thinking about the implications of the statement.
“Dragon Charge.” She cheerfully calls out, jumping high in the air and bringing her sword down on a group of 15 risen, killing them all.
“Come on, let’s go.” With a bright smile Steve completely disregards Tony’s questions as the heroes walk over to the quinjet, waving goodbye to T’Challa as they did so.
It was a quiet day throughout New York on March 19th, 2006. There were no villains in sight so all the Avengers were at Stark Tower in the common room watching movies. Clint sat curled up with Natasha on the single person recliner with Weavile hiding in the shadows and Talonflame perched on the top part of the couch.
“You’ve gotta be kidding me.” Yuri sighs irritably, getting up and walking over to Flynn, who flinches expecting to be hit, but is surprised when he’s pulled into the warmest hug he’s ever felt, immediately melting in Yuri’s arm and getting the unique scent of Yuri again, “First off, if you just explained your reasons to me then we wouldn’t have even broken up, I did see you kissing Sodia since I decided to visit but if you told me that she forced you then I would've been fine.”
“So essentially I wanna give you guys something of a quest.” Grid bluntly said, resting his head on his hand.
“Umm not sure, it’s our first time here.” The blonde guy rubbed the back of his neck as a red flush appeared on his face.
“Yea I know, maybe we can actually get out and have fun.” Clint grinned as he walked in with Bucky, Natasha, Wanda, and Bruce.
“Oh whatever, I’ll let you two figure the rest out.” Lissa hops up and gives Chrom a sharp look, telling him to do it or get lost.
Tony hummed in thought, missing the looks everyone shot him, “I was able to reprogram them in time and now they basically line the parts of the eaten organs. This in essence means they are now my heart, my stomach, my lungs, etc. So they basically breathe for me, eat for me, and pump blood for me.”
“It was because Robin here is a big cuddler when he sleeps, and he slept with nearly everyone that we traveled with. I swear Kayron, Kawerik, and Sigret looked about ready to murder you.” Elena fondly rolled her eyes in amusement.
Aether was in the Monstandt tavern, when he suddenly remembered something he had to do, so he declines his daily commissions, which surprises everyone, and then he goes about. (Zhongli, Venti, Xiao, Tartaglia, Rosaria, Barbara, Lisa, Kaeya, Jean, Diluc, Bennett, Amber, and Albedo) (Cecilia, Glaze Lily, Qingxin, Windwheel Aster, Violetgrass, and Silk Flower)
They walked with Harry, feeling their confusion increase gradually, as they passed through paintings and armor and in around 5 min they arrived at the 7th corridor.
Things progressed pretty much the same until one rainy afternoon Daisuke sought shelter in an abandoned Orphanage in Downtown, meeting two digidestined kids he later adopted after he earned their trust.
“Y-You have one hell of a story to tell us Mister.” Hikari hiccuped as she tried to be as threatening as possible.
“Hmm?” Tony hummed in a questioning tone as he scooped out the chicken and added the pasta, milk and butter into the pot letting it slowly sit.
Tony smiled a smile as he grabbed a paper and wrote his number on it passing it over, “Sure, call me anytime honey.”
Pepper pointed  back at Tony, “Everyone this is Tony Stark, my stupid best friend who’s going to be my bridesmaid at my wedding with Rhodey.”
Hope you enjoyed, if you did and wanna leave a kudo or comment go for it, you can do whatever you want I don't mind. And any mistakes please tell me, I write by myself and I don't usually go back to re read my stories so help me out if you want to.
He could remember the dryness of his mouth, his skin buzzing with need under the leather of the suit.
Now that they're actually friends, Steve knows it must be a Tony-thing (or maybe a I'm-too-in-love-with-him-to-function-around-him-thing. ) that made it hard for Steve to grasp everything about him.
Tony turns just a little and stares at him, tilting his head. "I'm not bothering you with all this super-husbands stuff, right? You know you can ask me to stop anytime"
"You know, their favorite trope seems to be your conviction to be unworthy of my love, how much you secretly struggle to gain my attention and how beautiful and gracious I am to let you be my lover..." He says in a mocking dramatic tone, to make everything seem just funny "You know, bullshit. As if I were really perfect, I'm the lame one of the two, they should know by now"
«Is that ... me?» Hearing his deeper voice is a relief, but then again the kid who's rolling his eyes and holding Tony tighter is very much real and now they have a new thing to figure out.
Stevie moans against his shoulder, like he'd do on a Monday morning when he has to get up early for school or something, clearly upset by Tony noticing the new presence.
Tony puts his arms around his neck and strokes his hair, a look in his eyes so fond that Steve doesn't know how he couldn't see it on Tony's face before. Steve hopes the man can feel the same when he looks into his eyes, he wants Tony to be cherished.
He tries to kiss him again and Steve is so weak that he almost lets him, his knees buckling. Tony doesn't relent, nosing at his neck, putting his lips on it and making Steve's life very difficult.
He senses sweet, tiny kisses being pressed on his head, on his neck, any point Tony can reach and lets out a sigh.
So, really, opening his mouth would just be a mistake) and Tony puts a hand on his stomach, petting him distractedly.
As a matter of fact, he likes to browse on the Internet just to check why everyone seems to think they would be perfect for each other.
Everyone else on the team keeps smirking at him and the Steves, they agree he's innocuous. So, nobody is in a rush, and they're just scattered around the living room, enjoying the little show they're putting on in the middle of it, because Tony keeps standing and the two keep on gravitating around him. Wanda is even searching for her camera to immortalize the moment.
«What do you say if we call Barnes? Or Sam? Or Natasha? You can stay with them while I try to understand what happened to you, mh?»
This was new : he's pretty sure Stevie remembers his life or at least parts of it, but he doesn't act like Steve would, he isn't freaking out about his body changing, and he's strangely attached to him, in a way Steve never was.
There's a heat in Tony's eyes, so strong that Steve shivers, feeling it in his guts too. His cheeks redden for another reason altogether.
«Natasha told me ... you talked about... » he points at Tony's hand, where there should be a ring soon «and... J just wanted to fix things between us»
Tony kissed him in the heat of the moment and surely he regretted it when he realized they survived. Now, he's back to his life, to his perfect fiancee that always loved him and protected him. There's no place for Steve and their little kiss in this picture.
Steven splutters, his cheeks going impossibly red, Tony feels kinda bad for him, he knows how much Steve hates to be in the spotlight, and they're teasing him mercilessly, Stevie included.
«That little shit. She PLAYED me. I was heart broken and confused, she just wanted me to talk to you»
He says it as this alone explains everything, like now Tony owes him something just for that. If he can't have Tony, he would at least like to hear him admit he kissed him and to know why.
He's whispering against his ear, that day he did the same. Steve gasp when he's aware of sharp teeth nipping tenderly at his chin.
There's always a twinkle in Tony's eyes every time he says a swearword (no matter how many times he told Tony he wasn't a delicate flower) and that always makes Steve smile, but there's also something else this time. It could be surprise judging by the way his lips part.
Tony raises an eyebrow, his expression and posture changing drastically. He's confused and maybe a little annoyed, Steve is at loss.
Tony doesn't meet his eyes, his stare pointed somewhere behind him, as if he's the one who's waiting to get his heart smashed. His posture is emanating self-confidence, but it's forced and fake. Steve is surprised by how he can easily read Tony now : it would have been impossible for him to do so, just a few months ago.
Tony laughs a little, because the kid is way too adorable, but he almost falls on his butt when Steven tugs on his shirt. Rhodey looks at him to check if everything is alright, he nods, still smiling and then there's a flash of a camera. Wanda is back in the room with them, she looks down at the Polaroid she's just taken and squeals happily, showing it to everyone. It wasn't the perfect moment : Steven was alarmed and Stevie had his arm raised, angry at the other one.
He seats straighter, staring down at the boy. Stevie — always better than Tiny Steve — is trying to seat on his lap and appears kind of hurt by his surprise, Tony pets his hair without thinking too much about it and his face softens immediately.
"Everybody here knows that you would be the first to pop the question, I'd lose too much time finding the right way to do that, probably"
Tony has to stand on his tiptoes to find a better angle to kiss him, he's adorable : he makes frustrated noises trying to bring him down to his level. Steve chuckles delighted, even if he's already out of breath, and puts and arm under Tony's ass, raising him from the ground.
He knows Tony wouldn't push him so much and that he's mostly jocking but he shivers, making him smirk.
Tony shyly caresses his arm, mesmerized by the way Steve's lips curls and the point of his ear reddens, he's truly embarrassed and it's the most adorable thing ever.
It's stupid to ask something and try to have a conversation with Tony, so intent in feeling every part of his body with his hands and lips. Not that Steve minds, but he's puzzled.
He doesn't know why Steven doesn't say a word. The idea to step closer and look at the phone himself is overwhelming him, but he trusts Natasha enough to wait for Steven's reaction.
His heart is in his throat when he steps in the elevator, he hasn't worked up the courage to ask Friday to announce his presence to Tony yet.
Tony's shirt is crumpled, his blond hair are going in every direction, his lips are shiny from the kiss. His eyes are restless, happy, his pupils blown wide.
It's been weeks since all this no-sense started and it's the first time Tony actually asks him what he thinks about them being so shipped.
Natasha dragged him out today, said he needed to feel how warm the sun was and to see how many people were around, happy and safe. They're sitting in a cafeteria, she's pretending to read a magazine — actually studying him while sipping some iced tea, and he's doodling, avoiding her eyes.
his brain supplies, but it doesn't make sense : Cap would crush him if he lied on top of him like this (with his giant, muscled, hot body — nice, another thought he has to erase from his mind.) and plus, Tony doesn't think he would ever do that with him.
So, the Captain wasn't hiding any skeleton in his closet, too bad. He probably never saw Steve smiling so much before, though, and he's baffled by the number of words that just got out of the child's mouth. Tony needs a strong cup of coffee and someone that could please tell him why this kid wants to be all over his personal space.
Steve looks up at the ceiling, bites his own lips like it pains him having to explain this or like he's afraid of what Tony will think about him then.
«We're both idiots» Steve puts his hand on either side of Tony's legs, confining him in his arms. He brushes his lips against Tony's again, feeling how soft they are. «but I love you too, I can't even get mad at Natasha for lying to me»
To be honest, Steve doesn't remember the ride from the cafeteria to the compound, there were too many words going around his head, he didn't even figure out what to say when he finally parked his motorcycle.
It's not the first time, or he wouldn't be so calm. Almost half of the team is been de-aged at some point in the past, but they usually acted like their older self and were aware of what was happening to them, or they were actually children, with no memory of their future.
It seemed surreal, a fantasy his desperate mind made up to sweeten the realty he was in — alone with the love of his life at arm's reach, but too far away, probably on the verge of either sacrificing himself or losing him, like many times before.
There's a blanket carefully draped on him, his tablet is nowhere to be found, and he obviously dozed off.
He shakes his head (He doesn't want to appear too annoyed, but he doesn't want to show how much he enjoys the idea of the two of them together either.
Tony is not even sure Steve's breathing anymore after these words. It's funny, because on the other hand he is hyperventilating, his lips hurt because of how much he's smiling. But Steve won't open his eyes, convinced that they don't have a single chance, like he was before. He tentatively touches his face, Steve's pretty eyelashes flutter surprised, but he doesn't move, so Tony puts an arm around his waist and drags him closer, feeling Steve's chest raising when he takes a deep breath, his pink lips open slowly like he wants to say something else.
He doesn't know what to do with those words, can't figure out what he means, it's hard to put all the pieces together with Tony's face so close to his.
He kisses his temple to sweeten the pill, taking him in his arms just because he wants to. Tony's bedroom is not too far away from his office and no one was around. Tony holds onto him.
Tony nods, remembering how proud he was and how much they fought afterwards — because even if Steve did the right thing, it was too risky and Tony 's heart couldn't take it.
Tony gestures vaguely between them, he's uncomfortable and taken back from his visit, that much is obvious. It seems he's looking for a way out. Steve winces, trying to stay calm and not let anything stop him.
Tony keeps petting him just to have something to do with his hands and because he can't really stand that sad face (Captain America's orders would be much more effective on him if he'd use that face too), Stevie holds him tighter.
Barnes is way too amused, eating a plum and shaking his head softly every time Steven pulls Tony even closer. Tony would like to shake him, imploring him to explain to him what's going on in his bestie's mind because Steve never acted this way before.
«Man, do you want to be held too?» Wilson goes as far as widening his arms for him. «Or do you just want Tony complete attention? Tony you should pet him too»
Feigning calm and security is easier than confront Tony about his doubts and when Steve doesn't stress too much about it, it's actually funny.
He should be so angry right now, but instead he's holding him closer. He can't keep from moaning a little when Tony bites down on his skin.
«Steven, could you please let go of my shirt?» Tony pinches his nose and sighs because he can't even remember how many times he's already asked him to,
Steve nods again, because it's the only thing he can do to respond to that. He clenches his fists, he doesn't know why Tony has to be so harsh with him.
Tony crosses his arms on his chest, his expression thunderous, he opens his mouth but then freezes, gaping.
Tony's fidgeting on Steve's legs, like he's waiting for something big to happen and Steve raise his head to look at him again, thinking maybe he's missing something. (Tony can't mean what Steve thinks he mean, right? It's just a hypothesis, he's joking, right?)
Steve takes a deep breath, rests his forehead against Tony's collarbone, the sight stir something deep inside of him.
Looking at Tony always made his heart tremble, a movement slowly expanding through his body. He always longed to touch, to bring him closer.
And then she goes, like leaving his future husband alone with the man he kissed a few days ago is totally not a big deal to her. He's suddenly envious of their relationship, but he shouldn't be surprised : Tony always trusted her with his life, and she obviously does the same.
«Because I'm a coward and I've almost lost you once and I couldn't risk it, it was impossible a man like you would ever love me back, anyway»
«We can't go on like these, avoiding each other. It won't make the elephant in the room suddenly disappear.»
Steve doesn't even know if he really said that, it seemed impossible to breathe, let alone moving his lips. He's pleading, but he doesn't care.
«Wait, what?» He's practically squealing, Steve can see his lips moving, repeating the words he just said, only slowly.
Steve's eyes, bluer under the kitchen light, widen again, and he scratches sheepishly at his hair, he doesn't look at Tony when he speaks again.
Stevie sticks his tongue at his older self, then he gets his arms around Tony's neck. «I would never hurt Tony, not anymore, never.»
Stevie hides his head against Tony's neck, and he just sighs, doing a perfect impression of a wounded puppy.
Steve always underestimate Tony's influence on him. The regret in the other man's voice pained him in a way he didn't expect, he thought he was ready to hear those words.
If looks could kill Tony would probably be the only one still alive in the room. He has the distinct feeling there's something the team is not telling him. Thor, especially, has an arm around Bruce shoulders and his eyes glued on his brand-new phone, laughing to himself and not intervening in any way. Natasha seems smug and pleased. Rhodey is the only one who's looking at him and not at the two Steves, so Tony tries to make sweet eyes at him and when Rhodey doesn't meet his gaze he knows something is up, but then Stevie distracts him.
There's a weight on his feet, then, and he realizes Tony is standing on them, to have some leverage.
His voice sounds way too whiny and distraught, his face must be no better. He didn't intend to appear so pitiful, but it's too late, Tony is already looking at him with softer eyes, lifting his lips in a weak smile.
For being a kid, he sure knows how to be solemn, it's a little bit dramatic. Stevie even looks at him in the eyes, his hand on his chest like he's promising something. Tony almost blushes, imagining an impossible world where Adult Steve says this kind of things to him.
Natasha valuates what to say next, it's probably the first time Steve sees her so blatantly hesitate. His hurting must be transparent in his features.
The world is back on his tracks again, they won. Everything is as it was before Thanos snapped his fingers.
They're sticking to questions for now, trying to understand if the kid is from another dimension, another time or if he has some kind of connection with their Steve.
"You know what I'd do?" Steve raises his shoulders in confusion, because he's having trouble breathing right now, let alone speak.
Steve flinches at the touch, he's still hot and bothered and not even remotely sure he was doing the right thing and Tony asking him to stay doesn't make it easier.
It's no use, Tony's presence is everything he can perceive at this moment. He's aware of his every little movement, the raising of his chest against his included.
Steve drops his pen, closes his sketch book filled with too many faces reassembling Tony and sighs, Natasha shakes her head before he can even say anything.
Tony is so small between his arms, Steve's almost engulfing him. He's conscious of every part of his body against his, of every movement Tony makes, from his slightly quickened breath to his legs tightening behind his back. But it's not something fragile or awkward, they just fit. Tony is small, but Steve's the one who feels safe.
She's beautiful and elegant as always, her hair in a pony tail, her lips red and her face a little tired. Steve can picture her so well, in a white dress, walking down the aisle, Tony waiting for her at the altar. He has to stop before his heart hurts too much.
Years ago, it seemed reasonable that their inability to have a serious conversation, at least without screaming in each other's faces, was getting in Steve's way to understanding the man.
The little thing stirs in his arms, his tiny limbs stretching, in the same way he's seen his Steve doing in the mornings sometimes. It's hard not to be endeared by it, it's just too cute.
She opens the door slightly and gestures for him to come closer, Steve can barely breathe thinking about the fact Tony is in that room.
«Well, he sure does look like you when you were little, pal. Just ... healthier. You sure he isn't ... I don't know, yours and Stark's son from the future?»
Steve's fingers are in Tony's hair before he can think about it, feeling everything he couldn't last time.
«No, I meant you'll sleep. I'll hold you all night long and then ,maybe, you'll fuck me in the morning»
He thought Tony was trying to irritate him, but it doesn't seem the case because he's still friendly, snarky and adorable with him (always spending his free time hanging out together, smiling and being so sweet that sometimes Steve has to hold back from cuddling him and kissing every inch of his body ...).
«I never told you anything about my feelings, I guess it's my fault too. It's okay, I won't take you accountable for something you did in the heat of the moment»
Oh, well, it got better : there's a kid cuddling on the couch with him, and not only he smells like Steve, but he also has soft golden blonde hair, an Irish complexion and pink soft lips.
He's being a little dramatic, but he's always been attracted to Tony — he was always torn between the desire to hit him and the need to kiss him up against a wall, to be honest.
Tony is dazed, looking at his lips, his fingers caressing Steve's hair in a way that almost makes his brain useless. He's undisturbed, still content from the kiss, and he looks like he's enjoying being in his arms.
He's so beautiful, even more up close. And for the first time, when Steve finally opens his eyes, Tony realizes how many times Steve puts on an armour to not let everything he's feeling show, because now he can see every little emotion displayed on his face — fear, anticipation, hope, happiness and love. So much love.
He was lost in his thoughts, looking at the last tweet Tony wrote (answering to a fan imploring them to marry, telling her he's waiting for Steve to ask) when the latter approaches the couch he was sprawled on.
"Oh you really put some thoughts into this, handsome. You're not wrong" Tony pauses and Steve doesn't meet his eyes while he continues talking, scolding his feature in something reassembling a thoughtful expression and not a desperate one. "But what if I really valued our new friendship and I wanted to test the waters before acting on my feelings? I mean, you never really said you were gay"
Bruce is the only one who's trying to take things seriously, but Stevie cried desperately when he suggested taking a blood sample and Tony knows for sure Steven doesn't like the idea of being examined too, so he gave up, studying the three of them from under Thor's arm.
The thing he doesn't understand is why Tony aliments everything : he replies to their fans, jokes about them, reposts the most amusing edits and a day doesn't pass without him proclaiming his love for Steve. Every time he can, he also tags Steve in his tweets.
He has to find some closure, somehow. Tony will be soon starting a new chapter of his life and Steve can't be stuck on that moment forever, not matter how that kiss made him feel.
His voice is so tiny, but somehow it hasn't lost his tone of command. He puts his hand on Tony's face and just smiles, like waiting for him to close his eyes again.
