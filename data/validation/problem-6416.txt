Hope could be a cruel thing. Tony had learned that both early and often, and he was hesitant to give into it again. But he'd heard Cap laugh, he'd seen Bruce Banner smile brighter than the sun, and he been the cause of both. He could give hope one more shot when it came to this.
"Noted." His mouth went paper dry under the man's intense stare. There was no doubt in his mind that Loki would follow through with his threat. They were friends, but his first loyalty was going to be to Shellhead. Loki would rip apart anyone who tried to hurt his lover. Honestly Steve wasn't sure even Frigga would be safe from his wrath.
Like the Howling Commandos here, his team The Imps was responsible for dealing with the Hydra threat. "We also looked for any concentration camps we could and liberated 'em." He went really quiet after that, his eyes haunted even after Tony pressed a kiss to his temple. "I saw things in there... I don't like to talk about it much, but I guess it's why I can't stand for that kind of hate. Even just a sliver of it is too much, and it ain't what I fought for. Maybe I did the fighting in a different America, but still."
"I don't want to drop by again only to be told I'm not allowed to come in," the kid answered quietly, raw vulnerability in his voice and eyes. "Mister Stark has been my hero since forever, you know? He even saved me once, though he probably doesn't remember it, and I... I know I messed everything up but I can't..."
"How about we go back to the mean old witch just long enough to tell her where you are?" A good idea, because it
That wasn't to say he hadn't grown to love the life he had built in the future. The Avengers had become family to him once he allowed himself to let them in. He worried about losing them as much as he'd worried about losing Bucky and with the lives they led he knew that was dangerous. Any mission could go wrong, any strangely costumed super villain with an ax to grind and a whole lot of crazy on top of that could be the thing that stole one of them away.
, because he knew they'd ask him to visit. They'd want to see him, to make sure he was okay. They were all dying to meet his family, and it would kill a little part of him to tell them 'no'.
The barrier had fallen while he wasn't looking, Vision and Loki supporting Strange while the Sorcerer Supreme's cloak fluttered anxiously behind him. Hulk had already shrunken down to Bruce, the scientist looking a little dazed as he climbed out of the crater; Harley was right there a second later, helmet retracting as he coaxed Bruce towards medical instead of letting him wander the battlefield looking for downed teammates to help. Peter had ripped his hood off as well and was sitting on the ground, panting as he looked up at the Benatar with a huge smile on his face. Pepper had Jess in a bridal carry, the crusty detective clearly attempting to escape a trip to medical and Pep just as relentless in the quest to get her there. T'Challa and his Dora Milaje were searching the sea of dead monsters, finding those that had a little life left after all and handling them with the help of Thor and Drax.
"Yeah, sure. Whatever. I wasn't trying to... shit. Look." Harley reached into his bag and pulled out a bunch of... brochures? Not just brochures, but ones for
The beer that sprayed out of his mouth after the question landed on the couch instead of Rhodes which was a real fucking shame in his opinion. His face was flaming, Rhodes was laughing, and he wished he could just sink into the ground and disappear. Steve tossed the bottle caps at the other man, who evaded them easily as he sank back into the couch. Nobody talked about his... his thing for Tony. Nobody except Nat anyway, so the sudden confrontation was…
"You pulled rank on me." Winter said, neatly sidestepping the topic that was still so full of hurt. "Told me you were a Captain."
right. Your handwriting is very recognizable, Mister Rogers, and you don't get to have it both ways. You very nearly killed Mister Stark--"
"You remember that I'm in charge, right? Your ass is still on the 'reserve' list, if I remember right." Rhodey was still swinging around to do as he'd asked, of course. The banter helped ease some of the tension, and he fucking
"Your ma is being awful strange these days," he murmured to Primrose as he gave her ears another good scratch. "I sorta miss being able to go down whenever I wanted, no invitation needed. Still. It'll be nice to see the boys again. I'll tell 'em hello for you, okay sweetheart? And I'll try to get Tony up here for a movie and a cuddle too. I know you hate when he ain't around enough. Enjoy your walk." He dropped a loud smooch to the top of her head, then left her to bury happily under the throw pillows on the couch so he could get ready for... whatever the hell Tony wanted him to come to the workshop for.
"Yeah, yeah. And Tony'n Shellehead too. Anybody else risks losin' an arm though." Making either Tony call him 'Winter' had seemed cruel... and Peggy had suggested he not force the issue with them if he wanted to seem friendly. Winter had, of course, taken that suggestion. Clint was the only one of the Defenders who still tried to use James, and that only when he was perched high enough to avoid immediate retaliation, the little shit.
“I still have some people to shmooze. Fury gave me a list.” He laughed at the look on Steve’s face and took the glass that was pressed into his hand. Water first of course, and he took a generous sip before he even looked at the scotch that would hopefully get him through a few more annoying conversations. “So if we’re gonna be glued together you’re going to have to put your game face on and give ‘em the old razzle dazzle with me.”
--" Tony cottoned on to the important part of what Steve had said a couple moments slower than he should have, but he did get there. "Jesus fuck. U! Butterfingers! Put that down or so help me I will donate you to an animal shelter! That's right, not even kids anymore - you've been downgraded to kittens that will pee on you."
Even beyond the dimmers, the workshop was darker than it usually was with at least half the lights turned out. Tony - who didn't seem to realize he had come in - was pacing at the far end, one hand constantly running through and tugging at his hair. Seemed to be arguing with himself too, though Steve couldn't make out more than a few mumble 'what ifs' along with his own name. It hurt seeing the man so worked up over seeing him, and he was on the verge of just leaving because Christ Tony should not be nervous about them being in the same room... but then he saw it.
“You’re cleaning him up,” he finally told Steve. “I’m not dealing with that. He’s going to want to hold a fire extinguisher the whole time and if it goes off you’re cleaning that up too. Oh, and you’re dripping that gunk on my floor, so--”
"So I need to talk to your mom first of all. If she says no, that's it. She has absolute veto power here, okay? So if she nixes the idea then we're done. That's the first thing."
The way she flicked her hair as she turned away from them made her dismissal clear, and he hoped it hurt. He hoped it cut them to their very core, because Pep was the best of them - the best period. He prayed that they knew that, that they understood her worth, so that they would understand just what it meant to completely and utterly lose her respect.
When Dum-E went after it with a shrill whistle of pure joy, Captain America tucked his hands into the front pockets of his jeans. Jeans that were a vast improvement over the khakis but could also be classified as cruel and unusual punishment. Maybe even torture. It was hard to remember that Captain America wouldn't like him ogling when the guy just looked so damned good. How was he supposed to not stare at that?
He also signaled FRIDAY to make sure she was recording the mock battle. Both Tonys would love to watch it later with popcorn.
. Not even something along the lines of 'got here safely'. What the hell is wrong with you? We have been ever so worried, and here you are, perfectly fine with fully functioning fingers. You absolute prick!"
Eventually the room was back to being mostly silent. It was sort of weird to have a teen he didn't even know curled up in bed with them, but he was really starting to think that maybe Tony had a kid - a flesh and blood one - that he just didn't know about. He could roll with it since he'd offered the boys and Fri that same courtesy. Hell, maybe he'd end up with another kid of his own.
"Aw, no fair," Clint complained when Tony immediately handed the controller over. "No passing off turns mid-tournament. It's rude, is what it is. You're only doing it because you're losing."
"Not my call. I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States, and if he wants to paint my suit--"
"He broke Clint's arm when he called him that. Right now he'll grudgingly answer to Winter, sometimes to James--"
So his plans had Bruce and Thor sharing a floor, one that would have a special room for the Hulk if he ever needed some time for himself outside of a fight. The murder twins and Captain America would have a second floor since Captain America and Nat seemed to be getting close - which he was absolutely not jealous about. He didn't care that everyone else on the team had been invited to call Captain America 'Steve', and he was definitely not green with envy that Captain America would let Nat brush casual fingers over his arm or accept Thor's arm over his shoulders while he shrank back from even the
Which was fine by him - he had a castle to manage, dragons to merge, and memes just begging to be sent to his kids.
Again - Ultron occurred because of the unforeseen influence the Mind Stone had upon the process. I can have Thor meet with you to explain it in depth, if you would like--
"Oh, but the suit just magically fit my exact measurements, huh? Because I know enough about engineering to know that that didn't just happen, Tones. You made that suit for me." Rhodes followed his words with a kissy face, which made Tony giggle and Steve growl under his breath. "Thank you for the present, and if the Air Force wants to change the name of
"Wait, you think... oh my God. Oh my--" Pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, he did his best to breathe evenly. "I have not been
"Not at all, Captain Rogers. I rather think that you will be very pleased as to Sir's plans. Thus the shower and change of clothes. Miss Primrose may come along if you wish, or I could have Master Clint come to take her on her usual walk."
"Tony…" the first hint of frustration crept into Tiny Adorable Steve's voice, and fuck but he missed that. "What can I do ta help ya believe I'm real?"
“‘Cause Clint planted those damn gunk bombs all over the trainin’ room! JARVIS said he was headed this way and I came ta give him a piece of my mind. Then I ran into all this other shit--”
already got it, no words needed. It was nice to be able to hug Pep tight and plant a smooch on her forehead and know without a doubt that Steve wasn't feeling jealous or threatened. Even nicer was the way the two of them could be close again without it feeling awkward or forced.
There'd been a phase recently where everything was 'trash'. It had been funny until it really, really wasn't. Steve heavily suspected that was why the word still showed up in the man's vocabulary every so often.
His girl made her way to the genius and stopped just a few inches away, tail wagging politely and her gaze fixed on him. Steve knew that he was a sucker for those pretty eyes and he was pretty sure that Tony would be too. Sure enough he reached out after only a moment, fingers trembling a little. When he couldn't quite bring himself to touch her, she gently pushed against his hand and let out one of her happy little sighs before sitting prettily.
Since the Nightmare Beast had managed to grab Harley and was shaking him hard enough to put the kid's neck at risk, Tony was more than willing to do just that.
"He might." It was nice to have the other man acknowledge the possibility instead of scoffing at him the way Nat did. "And then things might get awkward for a while, maybe you avoid him or the other way around for a few weeks. Maybe you don't really talk for a couple months. But you know what? Wouldn't last forever. You're one of his people now man. He wouldn't let you asking ruin that. You wouldn't lose him as a friend, not really. Not forever. So if that's what's stopping you? Yeah. Just fucking ask him before there's a fight that ends with him worse off than a few broken ribs and a concussion."
them, and you don't get bored of throwing the ball for Dum-E, you've never yelled at Butterfingers for taking your mug, and I know U has run over your feet at least three times today alone, but you never..."
Affection hadn't exactly been common in the Stark household when Tony was growing up. Most of it had happened in front of cameras or other people. He could count on one hand the number of times Howard had so much as touched his shoulder when there wasn't an audience to play to. Maria had been a little better when her peach schnapps consumption wasn't too high. If she was sober enough to talk without slurring, she usually remembered to give him hugs and speak a few fond words in Italian so Howard wouldn't scold her for being a soft touch. The weeks when Howard was off traveling were always the best - Maria would retreat and become just mom. They would spend time together, laughing and singing and cuddling. She would teach him a little about playing piano and praise him over the smallest things.
Tony knew something was up right away and gave him a look that was part pleading, part annoyed. It took Shellhead a little longer to realize the three of them were locked in the room together. When it finally clicked, he whirled to face them with a scowl on his face.
The Vision was one of the strangest, most awkward beings he had ever met and Steve had instantly wanted to tuck the android under his wing and make sure that he was really okay. There was just something so sad about him, even when he gave those small smiles to Tony and fussed over the both of them. He sounded just like Jarvis and the AI named after him, and Christ that must have ripped his fella into pieces when his loss was fresh. It probably still did to some level, but it was clear the two of them had done some bonding. Not enough based on the way they both were still fumbling a little but still. The process had started and he could tell the two of them cared an awful lot about each other.
"Tony's doing fine by the way - Fri said you've been asking and she hasn't been allowed to really answer you. He spent some time in that Cradle thing Helen Cho invented--"
Tony's hands went lax, only staying on Clint's face because the archer didn't let him go. His thoughts ground to a halt, tongue too heavy with shock for him to voice the 'what the fuck' that was flashing over and over in his brain. Processing it at all felt impossible. Getting it to make sense before Steve got there was just not going to happen. He probably would have tried anyway if Clint hadn't been there.
Steve liked that even if they weren't going steady he would never be alone as long as Tony was his friend.
. They were usually only on when the genius wanted privacy, wanted to hide whatever he was doing from prying eyes.
That voice was familiar enough that he stopped trying to keep Tony close, opening bleary eyes to look up into Winter's iron-blue ones. "What're ya doin' here?" His words were slurring just a touch - he hated battle fatigue. It was even worse than being drunk. Back when he could get drunk, anyway. "Where ya takin' Tony?"
Once they were both staring at the bottoms of their bowls, Winter and Shellhead stepped in to herd them again. This time they were led down the hall to their bedroom, which was nice. He was hovering on the edge of sleep again, his belly full and his brain mush. And he probably didn't need Winter to help him change into his pajamas, but it felt sort of nice to float along and not have to worry about anything. Pretty soon he found himself tucked in all nice and sweet, metal fingers running through his hair.
be my kid. Our kid. Me and Steve won't leave you behind, and we'll visit and have you visit all the time--"
were almost upon him - and he'd been having fun. Sure he was anxious, but he wasn't crippled by the feeling. The pit of fear that usually yawned open inside of him at the prospect of facing the Rogues was absent.
He did know. Tony had wanted to give Steve something because even if had figured out how Steve felt... well. Tony wouldn't (probably still didn't) fully believe that he deserved to be loved on his own merits. He had a feeling he was in for a lot of gifts both big and small in the near future.
"I think it'd work well for me," he said while shifting his weight from foot to foot. "I limited the destructive capabilities and added some of the features from Rescue that Fri would share with me." It was... it was the Iron Man suit, only shrunk down and re-imagined a little. "It sounds kind of lame but so are you, so I was thinking... I was thinking I could go by Iron Kid?"
In the end maybe it was a little anticlimactic, the way Steve ended up straddling Rogers and delivered punch after vicious punch to the asshole's face... but it still inspired just the smallest bit of enjoyment. Actually, guilt could fuck right off and he would admit that the sight was making him downright giddy with glee.
been true, or it would have felt like it. Steve thought different, but that didn't change Winter's truth. "What happened ta ya wasn't... ya aren't a monster Winter."
"Ha! Not my fault I have a knight in shining armor." Tony turned towards Clint and gave him a light shove - probably because if Clint knocked too hard into Nat she would enter instant kill mode. "It's also not my fault that you don't. It's because he's rude," he added in an aside to Steve.
"You have seen something that cannot be unseen," Tony intoned, going for drama and playfulness. Cap seemed in the mood to indulge both him and his silly 'bot. He wasn't above capitalizing on that. The fading pink on Cap's cheeks came back full force - he guessed nobody had danced like that back in the 40s. "So I'm afraid I can't let you go, Captain."
Harley smiled with teeth, and the kid could be fucking scary when he put his mind to it. "Good. There's no way she'll let 'em off easy."
"Steve won't let that happen, and neither will you or Rhodey. Viz'd probably have some words about it too and STAR would go nuclear, so I think we’re safe."
"Sir, I have been keeping track of the betting pool for almost two years now. I have heard you sigh about Captain Rogers even longer and heard him discuss his feelings about you with Miss Natasha more times than I can count. We have all been waiting for this a very long time. If Miss Potts had not forbidden me, I would be taking out a billboard advertisment. Sir."
"She grieves for him," he agreed with another sigh. "And he is too stubborn to accept her aid the way he ought."
where Strange and the rest were fighting evil Jedi when they took down the last active death petal. He couldn't help them out, not with the magical dome encasing them, and when he saw the streaks of red in the sky above Vision's location he wanted to throw up. His Iron Kid was still over there too, so he almost went anyway... but Harley's voice was still steady whenever it came over the comms. Harley didn't need him, so he didn't have to feel too bad about choosing to help fight the demon-dogs instead of watching Wanda fight.
So I sat down and plotted out the rest of the story in an outline, and I think I have a complete handle on how the rest of the chapters need to go. Yay! So the end is in sight, and it looooooks like there'll be 11 chapters in total, possibly twelve. So we're halfway done, and I should be able to take us there soon!
“Yeah.” Warm, dry lips pressed against his temple and made his eyes slip closed again. Even if it messed up some of the wires and made his chest ache a little he still tried to bury himself in Steve’s arms, face tucked against the man’s neck. “’M here. Not leavin’ ya ever again either.”
"I'm sorry Pegs," he said quietly, hoping like hell she'd believe him. "I wasn't thinkin' straight. I shoulda been talkin' ta all-a ya all along. I promise it won't happen again."
take care of him. Vision was on his way with breakfast, Fri sounded peppier than she had in a while, and he was sure that Pep and Rhodey would come running to welcome Steve back.
Howard’s harsh, ugly laughter in his ear reminded him how impossible that was. He was too old, too broken. Steve wouldn’t want someone like him, deserved someone way better. It was just his imagination and just more proof of how pathetic he was. Captain America overlooking his weaknesses and how soft he really was inside to be his friend was more than he could have hoped for. Reaching for the stars to try for more would only get him burned.
topping and--” Clint gagged loudly, interrupting Murder Twin One. She promptly struck out at his bicep, a blow he evaded by stepping behind Thor.
After his quality time with Viz Tony got the same while he got to hang out with one of the kids - sometimes that meant Harley instead of a 'bot. They usually played video games while he and U settled right back into drawing. Dum-E had come up with a new and complex form of fetch that involved keeping score and STAR was pretty much glued to Tony's side. She got to know her nephew during his chats with the genius.
"Yeah, but you and Thor are muscle-buddies and Nat's the deadlier murder twin. You guys were bonding over mutual toughness, not... not..." Tony didn't seem to know how to finish that sentence, so he trailed off instead. Even if Steve couldn't see his face, he got the impression that the man was pouting.
Tony expected a moment of silence and consideration. Nat and Clint were the Murder Twins; they were a set. They might fight or stab each other with sharp things sometimes, but they were still so intertwined it was hard to know where one ended and the other one started. He knew for a fact that they kept track of each other's heart rates and shit like that. So to ask Clint to keep something from her was... big. The plan that had come together in his mind in a few heartbeats had accounted for that, had contingencies that would carry them right up to Steve's arrival when he would capitulate anyway.
manage to go to sleep, he'd only wake up screaming from nightmares about how things could have gone wrong. He'd learned after his first 'real' Avengers fight that he needed to give his conscious mind some time to process before he let his unconscious mind take over. "If I have trouble sleeping tomorrow night I'll talk ta someone about it," he added, sensing Peter's concern. "That's the deal I made with Uncle Rhodey. He or aunt Carol will probably find you tomorrow to talk about coping and shit. More than they already have I mean."
“Sounds like a plan.” Steve let him go, but he only had a second to mourn the loss before a large hand settled on his lower back. Again with the couple-y stuff, and again with the impression that maybe - just maybe - he was the one being wooed.
"But if you don't stop enabling me I will be forced to make you sit in the corner with the dunce cap on."
Tony didn't want to meet any of them before then. Steve was bowing to those wishes despite his own curiosity and didn't even browse the dossiers Fri had been compiling.
Her upper lip slowly lowered to cover her teeth again, and she even settled her head back on her front paws. She was watching him though, and she made it clear that her guard was still up. A point in his favor was that she had stopped growling, and once he had sat down to make himself smaller she had stopped inching away too. He had a feeling she was either too weak to walk or hurt, otherwise she'd have been out of there right away.
A sudden, fierce hug cut off his words. He didn't hesitate before hugging back, pulling Harley in close. Since they were both people who pretended they weren't huggers it didn't last long, but it had probably done them both good. The kid maybe looked a little teary when he pulled away, but he ignored it the same way Harley ignored the way that his own eyes felt a little wet. God, he saw so much of himself in the kid... and even if Alicia would kill him, maybe he'd found someone who could carry on his legacy as Iron Man once he was gone.
He didn't see STAR zoom inside of the thing, but he could see the way her signal went patchy on his UI, and he could hear her trying to sass at them through the static that was drowning her words. There wasn't much they could do but keep the Nightmare Beast occupied, because now Tony could see why Harley had needed a new suit. Coating those fucking tentacles was some kind of corrosive substance. While the hit he'd taken had only left a few pits in his armor, prolonged contact was devastating.
"Tony," Rogers greeted, eyes only flicking to his for a moment before he zeroed back in on Steve. "It's not even three yet - not sure you should have that scotch."
"I'm on it, Tony." He had thought he would be intensely jealous of the other him, because 'Shellhead' had gotten to spend so much more time with Steve. The two of them had had years together while he'd only gotten a measly handful of months. They had a whole relationship that part of him had feared was more than friendship. Even with the other him showing appalling taste by dating
"You are overreacting, and I firmly believe in your right to that feeling because feelings are never wrong. Or something? I vaguely remember one of the shrinks I tried telling me something along those lines. Feelings aren't wrong but they also aren't facts so you have to be careful about acting on those feelings but all of them are valid. Right? Does that sound right to you?"
They were going to be okay. And if she really wanted to be a card-carrying Avenger... well. He thought the team was going to end up being okay too.
“You are aware, of course, that I have multiple cameras located in the training facility? There is also a crystal clear audio recording.”
"Tony!" Rhodey slammed into him from above, getting them both clear of the tentacle he hadn't noticed heading his way. "What the hell are you doing, just hanging in the air like that?! Keep
Then I saw Captain Marvel and like... really enjoyed it? I wasn't even mad half an hour later like I have been with most Marvel movies after I leave the theater. Pretty much since Age of Ultron I'm at least kind of angry about SOMETHING before I even get home. Black Panther is the only other notable exception, though Thor Ragnarok probably would have made the list, but I didn't see that until it came out on DVD. Anyway, with Captain Marvel I wasn't angry about my fave's overall arc getting undermined or anything like that, and the little bits and blips of plothole it added to the overall MCU didn't piss me off, more like made me go 'huh, I wonder how they'll explain/retcon that' and like... I just had that happy feeling again? The one I used to get when I watched the movies and read the fics, you know?
"Maybe not, but ya did! Can't change that now, can ya? Get that through that thick skull-a yours and get the fuck over it. Ya made a mistake - we all make mistakes. It's time ta forgive yourself for this one and move on sweetheart. For Peter if ya can't do it for yourself."
"Alas, my brother is still not well. My father's patience grows thin and there is only so much my mother and I can do to sway him. I swear to you that he was not himself when he attacked Midgard." They had been over that several times, but Thor still sounded almost desperate for Steve to believe him. "Loki did not invade this realm of his own free will. To be honest... if he had decided to do so in truth, he would have done so with ease. His trickery may be the cause of much grief, but it could win him most of the nine realms if he ever applied himself. We are lucky that he is so fixed on ruling Asgard and that his emotions regarding even that are so mixed."
Hey guys! So. Today is not Sunday, and this is... not the chapter I meant to post. But I struggled, really, really hard with the chapter that was supposed to come next, and might continue to do so for a while. I still wanted to get something up in this story, and it felt like a good time to do something just a little bit different.
of all people and in his kitchen of all places. It was just too much to handle at... 1:30 in the afternoon.
was still holding him. Some days he would swear that he could feel his lover's head tucked under his chin, could smell the peppermint of the shampoo Steve had preferred. Tiny Adorable Steve's ghost haunted him almost constantly, so he didn't think anyone could blame him for being more than half sure that when he opened his eyes, Steve would be gone.
they would show up now. Of course. Rogers and Natasha especially seemed to have a sixth sense about when he was at his most vulnerable so they could come and rip at those squishy parts of him. Since they were coming to 'save' him he figured he'd be lucky not to end up dead.
"He knows I'm talking about him. And he's keen to get home - he loves hanging out with Spider-Gwen just as much as I do. If we accidentally miss that family date because we leave here too late he's going to be pissed." Suddenly he was being hugged by himself, which was just... really fucking weird. Great, because he was an awesome hugger, but still. Didn't stop him from hugging back tightly, feeling a little bit forlorn. He
everyone and everything had initially gotten his back up. And sure, they'd both been in their superhero get-ups, but having yet another person call him 'Cap' when they touched him just... it just dredged up everything he'd been trying so hard not to think about. Howard's son was attractive, brilliant, and an amazing fighter; he was everything Steve used to let himself dream about in the dark of the night. He was also crass, took arrogance to breathtaking new levels, and he touched people like it meant nothing.
Steve's voice was so far away, hardly enough for his mind to hear over the searing electricity running through it. There was so little of him that was left, that was there. Soul took up so much space in his, had nearly pushed him out of his body, but he'd hung on to what he could with grim determination. He was so tired, and everything hurt so much... he couldn't even feel anything at the scene that greeted him when they returned from Soul's realm to the battlefield.
I would like to remind you that I am also an auxiliary member of the New Avengers, Mr. Poppleton. I am well aware of the internal politics of the Committee regardless of your attempts to downplay them. I am cooperating with this-- this investigation of yours because I believe in the Accords despite nonsense like this, and I will follow the rules and procedures agreed upon in them. You are welcome to ask questions about the involvement of SI in creating protections for our planet and the people of Earth, but I will not tolerate your fishing expedition when it comes to Mr. Stark. It is clear that you came to this meeting unprepared to fulfill your role, so I believe we are done here for now. Do you agree?
He'd been there in a way that had been constant without being suffocating. Harley and Viz had been embraced without comment, and he'd never even batted an eye at being asked to accept Laney and Alicia Keener as well. Somehow he'd worked his magic and started up family nights, the kind Tony would never admit that he'd dreamed of having with the Avengers. Movies, games of all kinds, quiet reading or working time…
Before he could try to explain the whole complicated mess, which he honestly didn't fully understand himself, they'd arrived at their destination. He could hear Rogers through the door assuring Bucky that it would all be alright; that would probably change once he realized just what kind of outside help Carol had called in. Rogers really, really didn't like him after all. And what he'd do when faced with a different James Barnes was anybody's guess.
Iron Man, after all. He didn't know how to be Tony Stark without also being one of Earth's mightiest heroes, not anymore.
Tony might have been pissed, except that Steve had just said ‘our son’ and ‘our other kids’ and his brain was maybe short-circuiting a lot.
"I just might," he had to admit as his stomach rolled again. STAR wasn't much better, flying in agitated circles around the room before landing on his shoulder, fidgeting a little and then starting the process all over again. "Ya sure he's ready for this?"
. Tony and Clint were especially cuddly, and he knew that shouldn't piss him off as much as it did. It was his own damn fault, after all. He had been the one to shun every initial attempt made by Tony. He'd flinched, dodged and brushed it off enough that Tony had stopped trying. Random fans on the street got more casual touches from the genius than he did, and his bitter jealousy meant the punching bag version had gone from 1.2 to 3.8.
"Birthday boy number two is here!" he crowed, drawing everyone's attention. To Tony's embarrassment and pleasure a cheer rose from everyone gathered, with glasses raised to him from every direction. Before he could recover from that and make any kind of snappy announcement, Shellhead swooped in. He teasingly pushed Steve out of the way, then draped his arm over Tony's shoulders. He was grinning broadly the whole time, clearly sharing the general merriment in the room.
Dum-E returned and began nudging at his hand with that silly ball, and Steve felt his smile go soft. "And this one - he wants so bad to help out. He loves findin' all my pencils and makin' sure I get 'em back. Counts 'em, you know. If I try to start a sketch before he gets all seventeen back, my buddy here gets all kinds of upset, like he thinks he failed somehow. Once he couldn't find two of them, which was fine... but he wouldn't play fetch that day." He ran his hand down Dum-E's main strut, then gave his claw a few pats. "Wouldn't let me throw the ball even once until he found those last two." The 'bot whistled to acknowledge the affection but was quick to nudge his hand again. Steve relented and threw the ball again, then watched Dum-E chase after it before shrugging.
schoolwork at all, and he couldn't wait to see the look on Harley's face when he had five adults, three robots, a bodiless AI and an android pestering him about it. It was going to be priceless. The room was big enough and had enough little corners and nooks that they'd all be able to put their own spin on part of the space. Tony had always wanted it to be somewhere for tower residents to just hang out when they didn't want to be alone. Now he was going to get that, and he knew a lot of it was because of Tiny Adorable Steve.
Talking between kisses was officially his favorite thing to do now, and as much as he loved to hear Tony ramble he'd be pretty damned okay if they just kept doing this forever. "It's in my bedroom," came out in a rumble he almost didn't recognize as his own voice. When he felt the way it made Tony shudder against him he vowed to learn how to use it on purpose.
"I get it kid. I'll get ya in, I promise. Have a little faith in me, yeah? I'm Captain America after all."
But set against that was Rhodey's voice in his ear, whispering encouragement. His honey-bear was the best man he knew and still managed to love him, so maybe Howard had been wrong. Pepper-pot was an excellent judge of character and she hadn't given up on him yet. That meant there was hope, that he wasn't all weakness and bad decisions. He had a team that he had been able to make his family; he was even almost 100% sure they would have his back no matter what.
"I mean..." Tony started while J gave an 'of course'. "Prisoner is a harsh term, but I'm afraid I can't let you leave. Not yet anyway."
"I've been worried about you every day, my mom's been trying to get through to Pepper for weeks and Laney's back to crying at the drop of a hat again and you've been busy... what? Breaking in a new boy toy?"
"He doesn't mean it," she reported after one scathing round of noises with a quivering lower lip. "He's just worried about me. And Mr. Doctor Strange was being awful rude about him earlier." Stephen's mouth pursed at the form of address while Tony and Shellhead smothered a laugh. "But honest, he's usually not so yell-y." Tony could handle the adults in the room, he decided as he squatted down in front of the girl. He had a sneaking suspicion of why they'd brought her to them, after all, so he figured he'd better start getting to know her.
But the butler he loved more than his father had only been able to show his love in small ways. Most of them weren't physical and he knew he had been touch-starved by the time he got to Rhodey. His best friend had done a lot to fix that, but then he'd left to go shoot up the bad guys and protect world peace or whatever the hell. That was when he'd really fallen into debauchery, trying desperately to make up for the giant Rhodey-shaped hole in his life in the only way he knew how.
Tony would never forgive him though, which was the only thing keeping him from making that last concern a reality.
Tony was almost 100% sure that he had never given birth to any flesh and blood children, and that sliver of ‘maybe, who the hell knows’ remaining was all the fault of magic and weird dimensional loop holes. He was 110% certain that in the universe they were currently in he had never gotten busy with Captain America and then brought a screaming, squirming Hawkeye into the world. That was just… it was a no-go, on all fronts. The only part of that he was only a little sad about was the whole not getting it on with Steve, which--
had Jan married that idiot? Hank Pym was an ass no matter what universe he was in. "They shouldn't have to arrange everything around me." Steve opened his mouth then closed it, probably because he was totally fucking right. "It's time for me to get over this."
"So. Um. Mister Steve, I asked you here today because--" his voice cracked, a testament to his age, and he began to blush furiously. "I mean." The kid - Peter something - cleared his throat while clearly trying to pull his failing courage around him. "We're here because Mister Stark won't let me... I know I didn't do so good in Berlin and that I got caught under that jetway and all and so it's my fault they - Cap and that guy with the cool metal arm - got away and I didn't listen to orders and I, you know, maybe got really excited about being in my first big fight so it's possible I wasn't taking it as seriously as I should have, but I didn't... I didn't mean to mess it all up and now he won't
The teen only hesitated long enough to take off his shoes and let his backpack hit the floor. While he had taken long, quick strides to reach the bed, now that he was there he climbed up just as carefully as Steve had. Tony again ignored that and just pulled Harley into his arms, tucking that shaggy head of hair under his chin. The teen's response was immediate. He let out a choked sob and grabbed hold of Tony's shirt, holding on tight. Soon he was crying into the genius' shoulder and both of them were trying to soothe him.
Anyway, if you guys have anything you'd especially like to see in that semi-experimental chapter that will skip us forward in time, let me know!

sweating, which was rare outside of a real fight. His body ached pleasantly, and he had a few minor cuts and bruises that were already healing. "I know that ain't how you really talk."
“I hear you’re being mean to our son.” The blond stopped dead in his tracks, the fury melting from his expression. He looked absolutely dumbfounded and turned impossibly redder. Tony was tempted to try and throw a few blueberries into his slack mouth. “I would like an explanation from you, Steven Grant Rogers.”
--" Steve was out of his arms and on the move before Tony could process what exactly was happening. Shellhead was no quicker on the uptake - he didn't get out of the way before Steve dive-bombed the loveseat and wrapped himself around Lokes in a tight, affectionate hug. The demigod immediately began to whine but didn't actually shove Tiny Adorable Steve away. Shellhead scooted to make room, and Winter was smiling a little as he watched the whole thing. Tony might have been jealous if it weren't for the flush of pleasure on Lokes' cheeks and the knowledge that Steve was the first friend the demigod had ever made - hell, he was still one of the
But Clint had been bored, and it was easier to give him joke arrows than ones that actually meant a damn.
When they watched movies together, slowly introducing Thor and Captain America to current Midgardian culture, it was in a cramped conference room with a shitty TV. Tony didn't complain (much) and it was worth the uncomfortable chair to watch Clint and Thor pelt popcorn at each other while Nat's eyes dared them to hit her with so much as one kernel. He could live with the setup to watch Bruce smile softly and try to hide it. Hell, even Captain America seemed to relax a little during the movies.
"Yeah? I don't mean... I'm not tryin' ta hurt ya, Tony, but... look. He's a good kid, and now he's hurtin'. The man I love wouldn't just walk away from that, not when he could help make it better. Would he?"
His search finally yielded results when he looked over at the bar... and what he saw just about broke his heart. Tony was there, a bottle with a familiar label in one hand and a glass in the other. Oh, it wasn't
"I been lookin' forward ta this," Steve drawled as he stepped around first Tony and Pepper and then the bar. As he moved past STAR dropped to his shoulder, orbs of arc reactor blue already flickering to life around her fists. "I saw what ya did ta him in Siberia, Rogers. Saw how ya left him there ta
and smile. Steve returned it, then brought their hands up to brush a gentle kiss over his knuckles. "I got this, sweetheart, unless ya wanna keep yellin'."
Hey, so if the Russian I tried to use is totally wrong and someone more knowledgeable than me can help me fix it I would super appreciate it. <3 Especially on Nat's end - if Steve's answer is a little off I actually like it better that way. XD
with a weapon he had improved and redesigned to better fit her needs, and he felt his fear starting to recede to make way for anger. Once upon a time - almost a year ago so maybe she didn't remember - she had met Steve, had laughed with him and liked him... and now she was more than willing to hurt the man he loved with something he'd built with his own two hands.
ta think? Far as he's concerned, Rhodey's legs got hurt 'cause-a him bein' down for the count and it's his fault Rogers and Bucky got away" he ignored the fissure of pain that shot through him at the name, knowing he needed to press this point home more than he needed to mourn his lost friend. More even than he needed to respect the hurt that flashed in Tony's own eyes. "Followin' that logic it's his fault ya got hurt so damn bad too. Why wouldn't ya hate him for all that? Not like ya been in a hurry ta prove him wrong."
"Make me." That, of course, inspired another round of kisses just the way he had hoped it would. This time the mood changed from sweet into something much more passionate and heated. Things might have gone even farther - farther than he was ready for just yet but God if he wasn't enjoying the feel of the other man too damn much to want to stop it either - if U hadn't interfered. Just as Tony slid his hand into Steve's back pockets and squeezed, the 'bot gave a quiet beep to call their attention to him.
"... you're a good man, Winter." STAR seemed to agree, because she landed back on the man's shoulder and pressed her face to his cheek in her version of a kiss. Winter himself only scoffed; Steve couldn't tell if he was pleased or annoyed by the label. "Anyway, Tony said you oughta be able ta have some fun while you're waitin' for clearance to save the world." Actually, Tony had been a lot less nice about it. His tone had been more 'keep the assassin entertained so he doesn't kill anyone', but Steve figured it all was the same in the end. "So he made some stuff for ya. Natalia and Peggy said ya could play with it long as me'n STAR are in the range with ya."
"Yes. Yes it is." Cap looked a little panicked, and Tony thought maybe he was blushing again, which was weird. Any concern was misplaced though. Wasn't like Tony was going to kill him, or could even if he wanted to. Which he didn't but only because Cap was kind of smiling and laughing around him more lately.
With his mother had gone the apartment, of course. The landlord had wanted them out for a while, but kicking the beloved Sarah Rogers out onto the street would have garnered him too much ill-will in their tightly knit community. Her son, a skinny scrap of nothing who was sweet but useless was another matter entirely. He'd been without a home practically before the body went cold. It had been hard, losing the place they'd lived in together so soon after losing her... but he managed okay. He always did.
Now he was sort of tempted to chug the scotch and do a line of cocaine in front of Rogers just to show the man how much he didn't care what Captain America thought of him.
the armor with Rogers in the room didn’t scare him more than being without out. "I don't need your protection or your concern."
He wasn't sure how much of it he would have if Steve weren't there - maybe it wouldn’t look that much different without the tiny blond - but he did know exactly who he wanted with him at the center of this makeshift family held together by something stronger than blood. So maybe that offer of marriage had come at the worst time, and he probably should wait for a little while longer before he got a ring. Despite that, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he was going to marry Steve Brian Rogers... someday.
"A good fight, friend Steven!" Thor boomed, hefting his hammer over one shoulder. His eyes twinkled like they always did when he played the loud, obnoxiously cheerful tourist. "There were several times I almost feared I would break a sweat! You fight well, and you are truly deserving of the title of Shield-brother. Most mortals are so breakable, but not you Rogers-son--"
"We won't make ya go back, but we can't let ya stay in the park either. But listen ta this - me and Tony live in a house surrounded by trees. Dunno what kind-a tree Tappy likes best, but I'm sure we've got 'em. Our house is pretty big too. Plenty big enough ta have another visitor for a while." Maybe forever, depending on how it all shook out. There'd be paperwork and questions, and he'd have to make sure to keep Tony, Lokes and Shellhead from destroying whatever woman had upset Doreen enough to be called a mean old witch. He was pretty sure they could make it work despite that.
STAR took the chance to go into battle, though she surprised him by not going right for Rogers' throat. She had always been meant for strategy though, so maybe it made perfect sense for her to go after Natasha first instead. His heart was almost ready to burst with pride as he watched the way his baby girl maneuvered through the air. And maybe Natasha used her heavy bracelets to block the first volley from STAR's arc reactors, but the way she held them up only allowed his girl a clean shot at the most vulnerable spot in the design.
It has been noted that there are very few returning faces. This has reignited concerns that Tony Stark may be more injured than was made public. Lt. Col. Rhodes, however, assured us differently. "Mr. Stark is still a major part of the New Avengers Initiative. He has simply decided to focus on developing equipment and tech for our members. He is Iron Man, however, and may join the team in active duty from time to time."
"Ugh. Fine. Your boring ass only needs to check in once a day. At least. Tony, I'm trusting you to make sure he does."
At first he had wanted to give them all their own floors - the way Pepper's eyes sparkled said she knew it too - but had eventually reconsidered. Bruce had one, after all, but seemed to constantly gravitate to the penthouse suite where he had a chance of running into Tony, Pepper and sometimes Rhodey. People did better with other people (though not him, because he was a Stark and Starks were perfectly capable of forging ahead on their own), and he figured it was important to take that into account.
Coping with small-time crooks was way different than dealing with the aftermath of a battle, he figured. So a more serious, in-depth discussion was probably warranted.
As he got older, he got even more excited when he realized that Howard - the one who had belittled his little robot dog before crushing it under his heel, then roared at Tony for crying over the loss - might get better once he had located his lost friend. Once Captain America came back, everything would be alright. And sure, Cap wouldn't like Tony much - he was too sensitive, too irritating,
Maybe it would be easier if he hadn't seen pretty much this exact scene in the movies. Sure a brightly lit frozen yogurt place usually wasn't the right setting, but for a kid who couldn't be more than fifteen it probably fit just right. And maybe he didn't have any goons hovering over his shoulder, but the teenager sitting across from him still looked appropriately awed and terrified. Where Steve was in jeans and a t-shirt the kid was in his Sunday best - bowtie and all - with his hair slicked back and a slight tremor in his hands. He was pretty sure they were getting to the part where he was asked either for his daughter's hand or for a little help making the kids bully problems ‘disappear’.
"Ya don't gotta explain ta me, sweetheart. I get it. Can ya do the other one now?" He poked at Tony's arm with the toes of the poor foot that hadn't gotten any attention and put on his best pout. There probably wouldn't be any objection, but he was prepared to fight it if there was. "Aches even worse now that I got somethin' ta compare it too."
"Boys." Peggy's exasperation drew his attention back to what was really important. The scold in her voice was enough to make even Loki subside. "He was nearly feral when we first brought him to the mansion and he realized we were not going to allow him to return to his... handlers." The moue of disgust and hardness in her eyes suggested that if he ever met said handlers he would be sorely tempted to beat them black and blue. "He didn't... he still doesn't remember much Steve. And overwhelming him with the past right now--"
"What?! No! We just... it was safer ta..." Steve floundered, his eyes fixed on STAR, and then he sighed. "Look, you're always talkin' about how they have souls. Thanos wants ta off half the universe with the Infinity Stones. If he got his hands on all of 'em..."
“So you said.” It was hard to put amusement in his voice and even harder not to shove her away in a show of disgust. She smelled like alcohol and cigarettes with a hint of cloying floral perfume to complete the mix. At his other side was her male companion, the one who had stared hungrily at Steve but shifted his attention easily enough once she had.
He was so busy watching the drama unfold that Steve's hands framing his face took him by complete surprise. "Hey, sweetheart. Look at me." The gentle urging caught his attention and allowed him to finally rip his gaze away from where Strange was setting up a containment field around himself and Wanda while Carol was glowing and had stepped up in front of Steve. "I know ya wanted ta be here, and I'm so proud-a ya for it, but I think mebbe--"
been in charge of the Avengers, which drew her attention back to him. Hatred burned in her eyes, and he could see red beginning to gather around her fingers.
He didn't know what he looked like as he floated toward Thanos, only knew that his armor was buckling under the power it was trying to contain, pieces of it falling as he... as Soul drew closer and closer. There was fear in the Titan's eyes and arrogance in the tilt of his chin; Tony felt Soul's searing contempt for the being more than he felt anything else. Thanos dared to lift his gauntlet, the toy meant to harness all the power in the universe, and Soul snarled with his mouth. A laugh that felt icy as an arctic wind left Steve's lips, because Space had always had a wicked sense of humor and was almost as childlike as the mortals who sought to steal its power. Time was silent, a sage who was done with jabs and jokes, ready to punish the wayward student who had stepped too far over the line.
Steve had the weirdest feeling that he was about to step out into a minefield, like maybe if he said the wrong thing Tony would withdraw into himself and never speak to him again. So he bought himself a little bit of time to get this
While he reached up and carefully cuddled her between his hand and the side of his neck, he got to watch Steve and Pepper close ranks. As one they turned and headed for the bar to join him, determination clear in both their strides. And maybe he knew his Tiny Adorable Steve would leave, and maybe he was a little upset that Pep had taken his
"Not for me, Captain." He was sure that JARVIS sounded warmly pleased - he always seemed that way when any Avenger treated him like a person instead of a program. "But Sir does wish to see you in his workshop. Ah..." The AI trailed off, which was not something that happened very often. He always had a ready quip or sarcastic comment to make, had comforting words at the ready. So to have him sound unsure was... kind of worrying.
"Uhh.... I've got..." Tony was digging in his pockets and looked disappointed when he didn't discover anything in the front ones. He had better luck when he reached for his rear pockets, a triumphant grin breaking out on his face. "Ah-ha! It's kind of dirty though," he said when he got a good look at it, a frown tugging at his full lips. The cloth was clearly something he used in the workshop, covered in grease, oil, and who knew what else. "Maybe you shouldn't--"
"Probably since you hosted Christmas here that first year. That was when I knew anyway. Not sure if da's figured it out or not."
STAR, meanwhile, was perched on Peggy's shoulder, and wow had it been interesting to meet such a young version of his aunt. She was a firecracker, just like Steve had described her. He was pretty fond honestly, and it hurt a lot less than he'd thought it would. Maybe it was the way she sometimes slipped into an American accent, or the way her jaw was just the littlest bit broader and her nose more upturned. Her eyes weren't right either - they were a lovely shade of green where Aunt Peggy's had been a warm but sad brown. Maybe meeting the Defenders wouldn't be quite as awful as he'd though.
Pepper sighed and reached out for the blueprints hovering in the air. She pulled them close, interacting with his holograms in a way she rarely did. He watched with a mixture of excitement and dread, because if his Pepper-pot told him that he'd gone too far he knew she was telling the truth. She knew that line a hell of a lot better than he did, and whenever he did more than toe it she wasn't afraid to tell him to knock it off. For long, long minutes that felt like forever, she didn't say anything and the silence was only broken by her thoughtful hums.
. Mostly they have given me old sniper rifles so far." From the look on his face, Winter found that fact deeply unsatisfactory. Steve didn't blame him, not with the advanced weaponry the other Defenders were carting around.
Her attempt at a Brooklyn accent drew out a bark of laughter. Tony turned their way at the sound, and Steve forced a smile onto his lips before quickly averting his gaze. Probably everyone knew that he was always staring at the genius, but the genius
and Rogers. He wasn't sure exactly how they'd ended up on the floor grappling, but he did know that Steve was clearly winning. Maybe he was tiny in comparison, and maybe his body was technically beneath Rogers', but he still looked cool and calm as anything with the larger man’s back against his chest. His legs were wrapped tightly around Rogers' middle, and no matter how the bigger man arched up and writhed - fuck, this kind of fighting would be pornographic if one of the fighters didn't borderline terrify him - Rogers couldn't escape. It probably didn't help that Steve had the guy in a choke hold too, and while his tiny adorable lover's face was the very picture of serenity, Rogers was quickly turning a bright, unattractive red.
"How would I know enough about your missions to pick one?" Tony tried for an innocent look, but from the way Clint snorted he didn't wear it as well as he had when he'd been a doe-eyed twenty year old. "It's a fair offer though. SHIELD's reports are pretty dull."
, between his two lives. He'd do it all without complaint, and he would do his best to hide how fucking sad it made him. Steve would try to get the boys to be just as understanding. He would try to stop any pranks and would be fierce in his defense if anyone else tried to make an issue of the whole thing.
"Up to a point," both he and his mop-headed kid said in unison. Harley grinned before continuing. "Our GPS is anchored to da, which means we're following his timeline even if he isn't there to live it. We couldn't go there and end up in the 50's, 'cause he's already lived past that. We're working forward from the time Lokes, Shellhead and Stranger Danger sent him back here. So--"
Eventually he was shoved unceremoniously through another doorway. He was sort of stunned to see just how many people were milling around what had to be the ballroom. Even more shocking was the realization that he knew
want to be an Avenger anymore... he still held out hope that the idea was a workable one. Surely they could put together a team that wouldn't rip itself apart... and part of him still thought the rogue Avengers might have a place on that team.
"They can't have you," he announced which was what got everyone else looking. "I don't care if they're your friends, your
"Or maybe ya just don't wanna see the truth, just like ya don't with Tony. I didn't steal him, and I didn't ruin your... relationship with him neither." God, he didn't like the way that sounded. Like maybe Rogers thought he wanted to be more than Tony's friend or something. That was just... no. "It was your choices that drove him away. That had nothin' ta do with me. And Tony lovin' me is a damn miracle that doesn't have nothin' ta do with
"Seeing a flaw in the plan, but it's fine. Recalibrating... Fri! Could you have the display for Steve's new suit go dark please?"
OMFG, this is so late. ;.; If you want the 'why' explanation, you can check out the ending notes. XD
Especially since Harley kept telling his da what to do, which meant Steve was keeping an eye on their oldest human son.
Pepper gave a little snort of laughter  - he loved when she forgot to seem elegant and just let herself be. "I think that would turn into a bloodbath, but we can try it on a small scale if you want."
kept a name. I chose my own." Winter paused, then shrugged one shoulder. "Sometimes I let people call me James."
“Precautions, pranks, whatever. The point is that Captain Wet Blanket is about to burst through those doors and I need you to protect me from his wrath. So. Bucket and Bolts! Where are y- oh, hey.” Clint fist bumping with his ‘bots would never not bring a smile to his face. The way Butterfingers immediately pulled back and dove into a more complicated handshake was just… perfection.
Without her husband there to remind her, Maria Stark forgot to be a cold, distant but polite socialite. It would be nice however long it lasted - usually a day or so before Howard's return she would start to retreat again. Now that he was older he fully understood just how fucking sad that was.
He needed to get on finding a way to transport Fri to that other world. Their kids should go back with Tiny Adorable Steve once he was dead and gone.
I have it on extremely good authority that there were hostile alien visitors well before New York. They were simply far more subtle and for good reason. Before now Earth has been protected by two things. One of those was the forces of Asgard. I think it's quite obvious why we can no longer rely on that.
Fuck, he couldn't wait until they could put the common floor to use again. Pepper would be able to have a space to spread out her work for SI and still be with them, and Alicia and Steve could have another table for their college coursework. The human kids probably wouldn't want to do
, or had a friend know the truth and refuse to tell him. Those little facts were bound to make someone a little bit more well adjusted than Tony himself was.
"As you say. Friend Tony!" Suddenly Thor's voice was thunder-loud again as he pulled away from Steve and strode toward the couches. "I see we have a visitor. It is good to see you once again, Colonel Rhodes. It is a blessed event every time I find you here in Tony's company."
though. It had been great before because it had been him and Steve, but wow. Just... wow. The serum had made his
"You're playing fetch with Dum-E? No! I will not be distracted by your shenanigans, and as for you, you bucket of bolts--" The 'bot's cheerful, downright peppy whistle was completely wrong for the situation, but Tony didn't have the heart to tell him that. "You're supposed to tell me when we get visitors. I should donate you to a preschool, let them climb all over you."
"I'm okay. Better than I was," he amended when he heard Steve's sigh of frustration. "I'm only lying a little and only because I'm starving. I thought my little beam of starlight was making us breakfast?"
Steve couldn't keep his fingers from trembling when he raised his own hands to frame Tony's face, but he didn't let that stop him from caressing the man's jawline with his thumbs. Those brown eyes fluttered shut before coming back to his, tongue darting out to wet his lips. There was so much that they hadn't said, or talked about, so much that Steve had wanted to say for so long... but none of it mattered. Not when he was so sure that they were finally,
I am offering you the chance to rethink your approach. Again, I am more than happy to go into detail regarding SI's involvement with the New Avengers and some of the leading scientific figures in protecting Earth, but I'm not sure you have enough of a working knowledge of what the project actually is to ask relevant, probative questions.
His new team made things incredibly unpredictable all the time. Dinner was no exception and he got that. Tony knew that always having someone they could eat with was a novel experience for all of them. He knew why they had dinner together every night barring extreme emotional distress, city threatening battles, or looming deadlines Pep would brutally enforce… though that last one only applied to him. They liked the routine, liked having everyone in the same room participating in the ritual. Hell, they even seemed to like the arguments they had over what they should actually eat. He totally understood and appreciated all of it.
"It's long-term. I don't need to make him my fella tomorrow, Rhodes. I can wait for him to be ready."
"Fuck yes you do. Collaborating is great and should be done often, but some of the best inventing happens on your own. Apparently I'm responsible for the care of you, your mother and little Laney because
"I'm gonna need ya ta take a breath," he interrupted, mildly alarmed at the pace and direction of the words leaving the man's mouth. "And stop bein' so damn stupid while you're at it. Do ya really think I'm gonna just go flyin' off just because--"
Soul simply moved to stand across from its allies in the body of Steve, Thanos between them. As one they lifted their hands and directed the combined might of their power at the gauntlet. It shivered and quailed under their assault, while Thanos bent his mind to using his two stolen Stones to stop them. But Power was a tricky, fickle thing and one could never really be sure of Reality either.
He leaned up to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek, hating and loving that he had to lift up a little on his toes to do it. Anyone who saw the gesture was going to have a field day; it was worth it to see the brilliant smile that broke out on the blond’s face.
It almost felt so... so normal as they exchanged a kiss in the soft light streaming through the windows. For just a second he could block out the beeping machines, the way Tony still looked so tired and hurt. He could forget that they'd been apart for actual fucking decades of his time, and the drama of that separation and their reunion fell away. Steve was just a guy with a sweetheart he adored, sharing in a moment that felt so blissfully goddamn
Steve had been losing things since before he was born. His ma had never talked much about the four small wooden rosaries she kept on her bedside, but he knew it was a match for the one he'd kept tucked in his pocket until he'd gone marching off to war. Each was for a little brother or sister lost before they could be born. A more elaborately carved rosary  had gone into a grave with his father and he'd put a matching one into his ma's coffin himself the day she was buried. Two more losses to be marked, one cutting a little deeper but both changing his life for the worse.
"O...kay?" What the hell was going on? "The thing you're not allowed to tell me about - is it good or bad?"
, not arrested, not locked away where they couldn't fight for their world. STAR had leashed her bloodthirsty instincts because she'd known it would make him unhappy to see any of them dead.
"And when it warms up a bit we can set up a tent in the yard for ya'," he added when Doreen still didn't look quite convinced. "So whattaya think? Wanna come check it out?"
Making small talk with Tony Stark was one of the more surreal experiences of my life. Having watched him in the news for most of my life, I admit I expected him to be... well. Vintage 90's Tony Stark was my expectation, and he was a very different person back then. I have to tell you I'm a much bigger fan of this new version. Not only because he fixed my phone and got the screen to stop flickering - he seemed a little offended that it was a brand other than a StarkPhone, but that didn't stop him from making grabby hands and taking care of the problem quickly when I passed it over.
Rhodey was just going to be disappointed and upset that Tony himself didn't worthy enough to be leading the team, not with the job itself.
He was blushing like crazy by the time the accusing rant was over and it was his turn to hide that by tucking his face against Tony's throat. The genius was clearly aghast, and tried to splutter a response for a while before he realized that there really wasn't one.
They both fell silent, Steve allowing himself to smile at the memory. Bucky had been like a cat with its back up, so damned offended that it had almost been enough to break though his shell on its own. The night as a whole wasn't a great memory. It was too filled with hurt and anger, too rife with the knowledge of where it had all led. Still. There had been comfort in a shared cigarette, and they had found a small bit of peace it the quiet night.
Captain Danvers ordered Rogers to hang up the phone; he refused. The team leaders of the other parties in the conversation had already been notified. Both Wilson and Barton left the call when their superior told them too, Maximoff similarly refused. Both were ordered again, with Rogers contradicting these direct orders and issuing his own to Maximoff to stay on the line while he 'worked things out'. After a warning that further refusal to comply would result in disciplinary action, a third order was given. Rogers again refused, and when Captain Danvers cut the call using the training facility's VI he accused her of being in cahoots with Loki Laufeyson. On being reminded that Loki is now an ally of the New Avengers, he broke into a rant that contained continued disrespect toward both Captain Danvers and Loki alongside more claims that Tony Stark is in danger and only he (Rogers) can save him. After Rogers showed he was incapable of controlling his outburst, Captain Danvers forcibly escorted him to his rooms where he was contained until he had calmed enough to engage in a discussion about his behavior.
"Hey," he forced himself to say, proud when it came out more word than croak. "Thanks for, ya know. Seein' me'n all. I know it pro'lly wasn't high on your list-a things ta do."
"Sorry Legolas. I don't drink to get drunk anymore, and if you slip anything in my drink I'm kicking you out on your ass."
"You're gonna be fine. Just keep breathin' and you'll be okay. Because this isn't a bad thing pops. Hell, I think it's a good thing." Harley was almost 20, so he figured he probably couldn't tell the kid to watch his language and be taken seriously. "You and da both seem more relaxed here. Happier. So it's not anythin' ya need to be sorry about. And I started with you because... well. I think da would worry more and feel guilty about it."
Then again Tony cuddled with Clint sometimes too, and he was always all over Rhodey. Bruce got just as much enthusiastic touching and so it wasn't anything special. Probably. Tony avoiding him so much lately definitely meant that it was just his tactile nature. Maybe.
"Mebbe. But once it was over ya woulda got right back up and cut 'em all ta pieces with that tongue of yours. I just got there first is all. Ya ain't no damsel in distress. Didn't need me ta rescue ya, and maybe I oughta be ashamed for steppin' in the way I did." Because Tony
For just a second, a fierce and hot jealousy flashed through him. Some other Tony Stark had gotten to be with Steve when he couldn't, and maybe... As soon as the thought formed, he knew he was being an idiot. He had the fingers of Steve's right hand still trailing up and down his arm, occasionally brushing as high as his neck or dipping down to his hip. The man's other hand was taking turns patting both of their boys, and he had left that other world specifically to be with all of them. Given the evidence it was hard to believe he'd had any kind of steamy affair with some other Tony.
fault, not yours. All ya did was what was asked of ya. I'm the one who went behind Tony's back, I'm the one who didn't tell ya what I was gonna do with the info, and I'm the one who... who made the choice ta leave. Ya didn't do anything wrong, doll. I hope ya know that." Her silence was louder than anything she could have said, and he was such a stupid jerk for not addressing this sooner, for thinking she'd just
He couldn't have stopped the smile that grew on his face any more than he could have stopped the sun from rising. "Yeah. I'm... I'm real happy Pegs. 'M sorry I didn't let ya know that. Being back here is... it's so good. It's
"Well, yeah maybe, but I got Tony'n Harley'n Peter here, not ta mention the bots and Fri and all my friends--"
"And you're pretty bendy, so I went with a material that could cope with that. In getting rid of the rigidity I sacrificed some of the protection it offers, but you strike me as a guy who'd rather evade blows anyway. I bet your Black Widow taught you all kind of flexy-bendy ways to get out of trouble. And--"
"I want to help you now. I want... I don't want to have to sit at home and... and wait for news that you’re hurt again. Next time something comes looking for trouble I don't want to sit on the sidelines and hope it all works out. I can't--" Harley's voice broke, and it was hard to know if it was puberty or emotion at work. "I can't sit by and do nothing while you could die. I want to help."
So yeah, Nat would have made sense and she would have no problem sending a concerned Clint out to do her dirty work for her. Thor would be the next suspect, but they had parted only a hour before and Steve had told him that he planned on going to bed. Bruce would have been a surprising fourth choice, but even that would have made more sense than who he found once he swung the door open.
"Yeah. Maybe it does." There was a stretch of silence where he tried not to feel guilty for not ruining his brother's optimism. He liked that Peter looked on the bright side and he didn't want that to ever stop. Harley didn't want to be the one to take that away. "Now go to sleep, alright? You did good today and you deserve some rest."
"Nice to finally meet you, Tiny Adorable Steve," the teen drawled, and even if he was a good eighty or so years older than the kid he still felt a blush creeping up the back of his neck and over his cheeks. "I hear you rock a pair of yellow rubber gloves."
what he needed. Not when Wanda could sense it, sniff it out like a bloodhound; as she stepped off the aircraft she looked unerringly his way and gave a sharp, vicious smile.
"No." Harley sounded resigned but looked determined, and he realized that he was in for a long, long day of being mother henned. He didn't mind very much. "No he won't."
Soul cuts the deepest Steven. But your lover has been feeling echoes of it his whole life. He will bear it just fine.
JARVIS had never sighed until out loud until the other Avengers moved in. Before them it had always been unvoiced but heard loud and clear in his head. With Clint J sighed a lot.
. He was damn near ready to pull his hair out. They were both so important to him, and life would be so much easier if they could just pretend to get along. Finally Shellhead took a deep breath and sat on the couch, eyes on Tony.
For that he could leave their room, he decided as he watched Tony doze in the safety of his arms. He and Viz could get breakfast ready together maybe, spend a little time talking before joining the wounded genius.
"Die mad about it," she returned lazily, coming close enough that she could skim affectionately over both their cheeks before going to land on Pep's shoulder. His CEO gave her an undeniably fond smile, then turned her attention back to the three interlopers. Tony took that as his cue to do the same, keeping his arms looped around Steve's waist. His
"He only allows her to call him that, by the way," Loki interjected in a bored tone. To pretend he wasn't involved in the conversation he had involved himself in a game of fetch with the boys, but Steve knew better. "And only when he's trying to flirt his way out of the playroom."
But then, miracle of miracles, he found out that Tony didn't hate him. He was even interested in being friends which was just... just great news. Mostly. Well, it gave Steve a way to test the waters at least. Being Tony's friend would be enough, would
His throat went tight, but it was because there was some dust or something. It had absolutely nothing to do with how touched he was, or how proud he felt that Harley looked up to him. The idea of being someone's role model was
"Sweetheart. I love ya more'n anythin' and I've got your back no matter what ya decide, but..." A crooked little smile and tense shrug of one shoulder didn't offset the quiet fury clear in those blue eyes. "I'm sorta with Pep here."
"We're fine, da. You and pops both made sure of that. And maybe havin' you both around would be nice, but I'm more interested in pops sittin' down and
"Hey..." Rhodes' hand fell onto his shoulder and gave a tight squeeze. "Breathe. I didn't mean to... hell. I think you're overthinking this is all. I won't say anything more about it though, if you don't want me to."
That would be enough to send the three of them back to work. Then it was Dum-E's turn, and he was the only one allowed to get away with shirking his real responsibilities. He was the one who would track down every pencil and bring them, one by one, back to Steve. The happy beeps he made whenever he was thanked were pretty damned adorable, and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy doing such an important job. Tony would flash the 'bot an affectionate, indulgent look whenever he thought nobody else could see him; all the 'bots received gentle pats no matter how badly Tony was scolding them at any given moment.
Even trying would make him an ass. Tony might not be interested in touching him, but if he was asked Steve knew the man would feel obligated. He didn't want that. He didn't want to make Tony uncomfortable.
Steve didn't tear his attention away from the genius until he felt Dum-E gently press a tennis ball against his hand. "Thanks bud," he said before giving the 'bot's claw an affectionate rub. "Let's see where we got enough space... ah! Over there'll work. Just watch for that big pile-a junk, kay? If it gets knocked over we're gonna have to clean up instead-a playing." There was a beat where the 'bot processed the instructions, camera aimed in the direction Steve was pointing. Dum-E twisted his claw in a move that always reminded him of a dog cocking its head to the side, then let out a beep of acknowledgement. "Great. Ready? Go!"
The new team at least, which would be headquartered in the completely remodeled compound upstate. He'd spent a lot of nights with Tony and Ben bent over blueprints, trying to get the design right. Rhodey and Viz were key parts of the conversations as well, adding insight and making sure Ben knew what they were going to need to actually let the team train properly and make their living quarters suitable.
“You’re all so fucking weird. I don’t know why I let you live here. Brucie-bear, you can stay and I guess Steve can too, but the rest of you are on thin ice.”
But as Dum-E and U settled in by the bed, STAR curled against the hollow of his throat, he thought it might be nice if he let himself give in to the fantasy of it. With Steve fussing over his bandages and making sure all the wires he was hooked up to were undisturbed it was easy to just let his
"Induction?" Steve's brow furrowed, and he found himself trailing after Rhodes like a lost puppy. "What am I getin' inducted into?"
Unfortunately checking on the other two invaders had caused him to miss a chunk of the action between his
"I don't think the Cradle would help, James." Her voice was so fucking gentle that he wanted to smack her, which was just.. fuck. So far beneath him. He needed a nap, and a shower, some food, and for his best friend to
"As long as you promise you won't shoot any of them inside the tower." Clint pouted and Tony folded like a cheap suit. "Okay, okay - one with and one without a timer so you know how they fly. But only where we have wooden floors and no furniture! Glitter is a bitch to clean up, you know. It's like sand - gets everywhere and you're finding it in the weirdest places for weeks afterwards. Once I had to deal with glitter on a
Steve's heart stopped in his chest, and not only because Loki had his murder face on. He loved Shellhead like... well. Like a brother. That Tony wasn't his lover but was still so, so important to him. He'd never meant to hurt the other man. He should have known that his disappearing act would cut like a knife. When he had gone away it was with the intent and expectation of continued communication and he'd dropped the ball. He'd hurt his best friend, and that was unacceptable.
"Look, it's... I mean. Da's from here, and I think maybe he always wanted to kidnap you and bring you here. Especially after what happened with
"We're leaving now," Loki told them all, rolling his eyes before he pressed a kiss to Shellhead's temple. "I'll prepare the gateway." The guy wasn't wearing a cape, but Tony could still imagine one sweeping behind him as he stalked off. Dramatic fuck.
"And then you, me and Peter are going to sit down with Rhodey and Captain Danvers and really hash out this whole... junior superhero thing. All the rules and safety features and what it actually looks like. I took Peter into a fight that he wasn't ready for--"
He anticipated it being a fight, because Tony never liked to admit that he was only human and sometimes needed to stop pushing so hard. Tony might not want to leave the boys either, especially since their other kids weren't even at home. He might even try denying that he'd never be able to let go and relax while in the same vicinity as Wanda. Steve's job was to get him to relent, because there wasn't anything more they could do at the compound and they both deserved a night spent cuddling in their own bed.
Maybe they would have said more, kept teasing and playing, but the sound of an approaching aircraft cut their fun short. And he
In any case they would be back in the thick of it, but he didn't know the lay of this land. He'd never gotten to learn everything about this time in this world, and he was sure there was even more to learn now that he'd been gone almost two years. Steve especially wanted a better look at the Avengers and just what exactly had gone wrong. He fully planned to be part of the team as long as Tony was, so the internal politics of it all were important. If he knew how they had failed he could help his fella and Rhodey make it better.
It was what he'd done while Steve was gone. It was what he was doing now because he really thought Steve would leave again.
"Last time I told you about the Avengers you left us." Her voice was flat, almost cold, and he flinched back at the rebuke. She wasn't wrong, and he realized that he had yet to apologize for putting her in that position.
friend, and it had him feeling kind of giddy. Especially with the way Tony had lit up like the sun the first time he had heard Steve use the name. He liked making Tony happy.
They'd think the worst of him anyway, so when he lifted his right hand and waggled his gauntlet-covered fingers, he swept the glass of scotch up in his other hand. Still not to drink - probably - but props were essential to get him through this.
"Was that back when you had to walk ten miles to school in the snow, barefoot and uphill both ways?"
his plan without demanding a lengthy explanation. It was a risky move, one that would leave them open to the waves of demon-dogs still trying to pour out of the ships. But if they could take the chick with the spear or glaive guy out of the game... he was pretty sure the other would follow. Getting half the big players off the field would do wonders for their chances.
With the Avengers it was... harder. Sure they were a team and maybe something close to friends, but Tony was never really sure. Did the way Nat kept bullying him into training without the suit show concern or a disdain for how weak he was outside his metal shell? When Thor 'praised' his tech for being 'impressive' for a mortal, was that a fond tease or the insult it sometimes felt like? Clint was a little easier to read and he was pretty sure the archer at least found him amusing. His pranks were almost never aimed at Tony anymore and he was often included in the planning process, which had to mean something. Bruce was, of course, his science bro and their love was one that would span the ages, but sometimes... sometimes he worried that Bruce tolerated him more than cared about him. He tried not to let that thought creep in too often. It was a mixed success.
"No, no. It's true. I can't science or math if I'm too mellow. I require a hint of jittery anxiety in order to reach peak performance."
"If I ever decided to disembowel you, Natasha wouldn't know to come to me for tips. No one would suspect me of anything." The sugary-sweet tone of her voice made him shudder, and he gulped in fear that wasn’t entirely pretend. Eyes dancing and lips curved up in a wicked smile, she leaned in to whisper in his ear. "And nobody would ever find the body."
A bony knee hit his side hard enough to knock the breath out of him. Nat's face stayed serene but her eyes were sharp when he looked over to glare at her. "Don't play at being an idiot Steve. It doesn't suit you." Her knee retreated and her fingers delved back into his hair, so he knew she wasn't that upset with him. "He's been mine since he decided not to kill me, but he isn't
He’d been in medical for almost four days, during which he had suffered through a teary visit from Pepper and a pretty intense facetime session with Rhodey. His best friend was stuck in the desert for another week before he could get any leave time, but he’d be showing up as soon as he could.
Also scary and confusing because he didn't know what it meant. It felt like more than a friend thing, more than even just an Avengers family thing. But was it?
"That's what big brothers are for." Usually Peter would argue, and they would bicker over how much difference a few months really made. Harley thought maybe the idea of having a big brother just then was more comforting than annoying. It was... it was nice, really nice. Being a big brother was something he was good at, something warm and good and true that nobody could take away from him.
"Our woods are big enough for Tappy's family too," he told her with a smile. "You'll have ta help us explain though, and help us figure out how ta get 'em there safely." Her chest puffed out for a moment, like she was pleased with the responsibilities, but then deflated a little. That didn't last long either before that jaw was jutting out in a stubborn set he recognized well - all their human kids wore the expression frequently.
Maverick's social media presence has been a delight for liberal political activists everywhere. He's been especially vocal when it comes to the immigration debate and is quick to call out intolerance on the part of politicians whenever he sees it. "His twitter has more followers than Iron Man's," Tony reported proudly when I mentioned all this. Steve just blushed again.
"Two away is good," Harley told him with a shrug, like it was no big deal. Like he didn't know whose workshop Tony would have had to rip apart to get their spaces closer. Bruce might never come back... but he always wanted the scientist to have a home here anyway, just in case. "And maybe I could work on that with Fri for a while then show you what we come up with. You've got other stuff to work on that takes priority."
There were things that could have been said, challenges that could have been thrown or speeches given to bring poignancy to the moment. Soul just wanted it done before the little Mechanic disappeared completely, before Steve was burned to ash under the combined weight of Time and Space. So there was no recital of the Mad Titan's crimes, no taunts or warnings.
"Tony... you didn't have to do it 'right'. You never have to worry about doing something perfect - you're already so damn close to perfect in my book already that you don't have to try so hard."
," Rogers answered Steve, voice tight. "I've seen a lot of dirty tricks in my time, but I can't believe you're using my face for this. To prey on Tony for... for..." The man turned bright red and managed to look both furious and constipated, and it was the most unattractive his face had ever looked. "Turning feelings like
Maybe he also wanted to know if he was giving Rogers a few good punches or if he was going to need to break some bones to get his point across. He might have been worried about that desire for violence, might have wondered if the serum really did go bad the way Bucky'd thought it might... but it was all for Tony. His fella had been hurt, nearly died, and he was looking to pay back some of that damage.
2 - Red1999, when I saw your comment on my last chapter I just about died. XD You pretty much guessed the plot 'twist', so congrats!! XD  :'D  I just had intended for there to be more of a physical confrontation before and after the whole soulscape journey thing. Anyone who guessed where this was going gets a virtual cookie!
"I wish you were real," he whispered into his pillow… or what he was pretty sure was his pillow. It was warmer than usual, maybe a little firmer, but there was no way… there was just no way. He was a fuck-up, with a laundry list of evidence to prove it - no one would ever come back for him. That Rhodey and Pepper were still around was a miracle, Vision was too young to know to avoid him like the plague, and he paid Happy to care about him. Everyone else left and they were right to do it. Tiny Adorable Steve had gone off to do great things. There was no way he was going to come back for one Tony fucking Stark. "I wish you were really here."
"Hell, I'd let him kill me before that happened. He and Natalia worked themselves ta the bone ta unravel what those bastards did ta him. Nearly ripped him apart inside too from what they told me. He's been completely his own man for almost two whole years now, so ya can get off your high horse Rogers. I didn't come here ta steal nothin' from ya either, ya dumb prick. I came 'cause Winter didn't want ta come alone, and he only came ta try'n help."
The gauntlet shattered, and Thanos was devoured, screaming, by the Stones he had so arrogantly assumed were his to command.
Probably-Nathan’s hand slid around to rest between his shoulder blades while he shot Maybe-Debbie a heated look. “We’re both impressed by all of your aerial maneuvers. Must take a lot of flexibility. I’d love the chance to get a close up look at that.” Sure enough his hand had started to slip down, and so help him--
like Doreen was living in a group home or foster situation. If they could talk to the woman who'd been charged with taking care of her, they could get a better idea of just what had caused Doreen to be there in the first place. It would also keep them from being charged with kidnapping if they did it all as close to the legal way as possible, so he was all for it.
His breathy exclamation was what drew Tony's notice, and the man spun to face him before coming to a complete stop. Their eyes met and held, and Steve knew his mouth was probably hanging open. Mary Mother of God he prayed the conclusion he'd jumped to wasn't wrong, because the hope he had been carefully hoarding close to his heart had suddenly grown big enough to crush him to pieces if Tony dashed it. He couldn't breathe because of the want that was choking him, and his heart was pounding so loudly in his ears that the genius had to be able to hear it.
"Almost two months ago, shortly after you left, we got a lead. Miss Margaret chased it down and he was at the end of it. We found him and we brought him home, just like we promised."
And really, even if they weren't talking because of Tony's crushing self doubt... he thought that maybe this was another one of his fella's kids. He really ought to be brought into the fold if only so Steve could stop him from looking like skin and bones the way he did.
Peter only hesitated for a few seconds before taking the offered money and heading back to the counter. There was a skip in his step that hadn't been there before. When he ordered his hands were all over the place in his excitement, the happy tone of his voice reaching Steve's ears even if he didn't strain to hear the details of the order. Smiling, he pulled Peter's abandoned strawberry to him - wasting food was still near a sin in his book, after all - and dumped it in with his vanilla. That was fancy enough for him - he didn't need chocolate chips or gummy worms or whatever the hell else was on offer.
Hoping to prevent Winter from answering that with all the sass and swagger he'd been embracing lately, he ducked in the door just before it closed with a quiet 'snick'. The second Rogers saw him, his expression darkened further and his hands clenched into fists. Maybe being the one to accompany Winter had been a mistake. He probably should have sent someone else in his place. Why had he insisted on coming along, knowing how much Rogers hated him?
"I almost peed myself when you said you wanted to name our girl that. I thought... I thought maybe you'd found me out."
"You don't." That was... that was an unfair point to make. He wanted to say that Harley didn't understand what he was asking, but that wasn't entirely true. The kid had seen a lot more than the glamorous, glitzy lie of superhero life. He'd been there for some of the ugly parts, had been there during some of Tony's own worst times. Maybe he didn't have a full and complete understanding of what his request entailed... but it would be wrong to treat this like a silly whim.
So he just did his best to smile back and hoped he didn't look too uncomfortable with the unspoken 'thank you'. In case it showed he took another long sip of the latest tea experiment - this stuff really wasn't too bad.
Food trucks were probably one of his favorite things about the future, for example. One jogging route in particular - the one he called the 'Tony won't talk to me today' route in his head - let him stop at six different trucks in under an hour to try an eat away his pain. He loved catching sight of same sex couples holding hands as they walked the streets, loved the way they didn't need to be so afraid anymore. There were so many different kinds of people that lived together, and he knew that he was experiencing things from a very particular and limited point of view, but... well. For every instance of hate and cruelty he saw, he could also find a handful of examples of genuine compassion and kindness.
He took another gulp of water to earn an approving grin, then downed the rest of the glass for good measure. “I’m not getting my other drink until I put some food in my stomach, am I?”
"Nowhere fatal," Winter 'agreed', all even-toned and matter of fact like he was making any kind of sense. "But Agent Carter said--"
It was done reluctantly and they maybe started kissing again a couple more times, but eventually they were able to separate and look down at their son. In his claw he was very daintily clutching that bouquet of flowers, offering them to Steve. Blushing like crazy and completely unable (and unwilling) to do anything about it, he accepted them with one hand and brought them to his nose to get a whiff of their scent.
So there was a little explanation/rant for anyone who wanted it or was interested in my justifications. XD
to get this right. "The stakes are always high when the Avengers are called in. That's just the deal. There's always the chance you're gonna get hurt, that maybe you won't make it, and that's always a little scary for me and prob'ly most of the others. I
"They'd be outta danger. And since the only way Thanos is gettin' 'em is over my dead body, we weren't sure the portal would still work if'n we lost. It was better ta send 'em before the fight in case they couldn't have gone after. I'm sorry we worried ya--"
Time would return to its own Stonekeeper, while Space would wander where it willed. Power and Reality were less predictable. Soul was unsure of where they would choose to rest now that the choice was theirs again. Mind would, no doubt, stay with the Stonekeeper it had helped breathe life into. It was hard to leave a being once a Stone had claimed it; Soul managed to separate from the little Mechanic only because he would be miserable if forced to leave his world and his family forever. No doubt he would find a way to build himself an escape route, and while Soul would enjoy seeing him try, there was no need to put him through that.
Tony was feeling pretty damn proud of himself when glaive guy immediately gave a howl of pained outrage, staring at spear chick and redoubling his efforts to get to her. Less proud was the moment that Spider-Man was swatted away like a bug. Maverick hurled himself up in the air to catch the kid and then they both went down, leaving glaive guy clear to struggle out of the webbing he'd been bound in. Spear chick was still fighting Captain Marvel's hold, but that fight was getting weaker, so he cut the cluster cannon and took a moment to survey the rest of the battlefield.
Steve was forced to admit to himself that Winter was right. Layers of black, oversized clothes gave the impression that he was trying to hide, as did the lanky hair that continuously fell across his eyes. Though he was standing absolutely still, he still exuded a twitchy, nervous energy like he was seconds away from bolting. Compared to Winter - whose long, carefully cared for hair almost resembled  lion's mane that nicely complimented his short, immaculately trimmed beard - Bucky looked shabby and unkempt. He was like a shadow, fleeting and timid, while Winter had re-learned how to live loudly and in full color.
"Shhh, Adorable Feisty Steve. Let me bask in my madness." Fuck, even if everything still hurt, even if every breath reminded him of the way his ribs had caved in under Rogers' assault, even if he wasn't sure he could pick himself up after this latest fall… this was the best he'd felt in a long time. The fantasy of his Steve coming back for him, the almost-real feel of his lover-- "Where'd you get all the muscles?" he asked when he registered the unexpected change. Eyes still firmly shut, he let his fingers explore and was both pleased and disappointed with the results he got. Sure it was nice to think of Steve being healthy and with enough muscle to be Captain America… but this also meant that maybe he was forgetting the way Steve actually felt and looked.
His heart broke a little, because the kid just looked so damn lost and just a little scared. It was the same helpless look that Pepper used to get. He hadn't liked it then and he sure as hell didn’t like it now. Because Steve and all his kids had turned him into an utter softy, he reached out and drew Harley in for a hug. The teen grabbed on in return and squeezed him fiercely - he couldn't help but notice that Harley had reached the underside of his chin already. Hell, the kid was probably going to be taller than him soon.
"I think yes." Before the man could protest again, he dive-bombed the couch. Loki didn't get out of the way quite in time, so Steve could wrap his arms around the mage's middle and squeeze. After a brief, playful scuffle, they ended up sitting side by side, one of Loki's arms thrown over his shoulders. "Admit it - ya like me."
"This isn't funny," he managed, doing his best to glare and pretend he wasn’t embarrassed beyond belief.
"I have no idea what you're talking about." Harley snorted, sounding so much like Steve that he had to smile. Several Defenders were sure that the kid was somehow biologically theirs and he loved it more than he should. Though he didn't like that it meant Harley was wise to both of their tricks, and was an observant little shit to boot. "Seriously. This is our getaway spot, Harls. We live in the tower."
Especially since they were suddenly standing only a few inches apart. Steve wasn't sure exactly when the distance had been crossed or who had done it, but now they were close enough for him to feel Tony's breath fanning over his skin while his scent flooded Steve's nose. Every thought that he might be wrong, that this might be another misunderstanding soon flew out the window, thank God. When he looked into the beautiful brown eyes he'd been dreaming of for years, he saw the same longing he so often found in the mirror. Tony was swaying into his space as much as he was swaying into Tony's, and he could feel warm hands gripping his sides.
"'Cause he knows it's awful mostly. Likes ta show me terrible films all-a the damn time. Did ya cry?"
"What? Oh, I... I'm sorry. It's just..." Rhodey could understand her awe and disbelief, but none of it helped the two men who had somehow done the impossible. Tony and Steve had been in a coma for almost a week - one of the longest weeks of his life. He had watched the both of them fall after defeating Thanos, too far away to do anything but give a wordless cry of fear. Of course he had shot straight towards them, all of the Avengers and the borrowed Defenders doing the same... but none of them had been able to get close.
“Because you'll go right down to your workshop and stay there too long. It's one more day, maybe two. You can make it.”
Jesus fuck. He might get the chance to kiss Steve. Even better was the hope that he might get to cherish Steve, shower him with as much love as he’d always wanted to. Maybe he'd get to link their fingers together when they walked side-by-side, and maybe he would get to pet Steve's hair until he fell asleep with his head in Tony's lap. They could argue over all the stupid things they already did, but there would be gentle touches and loving looks thrown in too. They could do soft shit like watch movies together in pajamas and bare feet, hair mussed from sleep while they got tangled up in each other.
There were all kinds of dames throwing themselves at his new body, and a few fellow soldiers had discreetly offered up a night of 'stress relief' as well. It felt like a lie whenever he gave in though, because none of them wanted Steve Rogers. They wanted the muscles and the bravery, not the artist with knobby knees. All of them whispered praises about how he looked, crooned into his ear everything they wanted to do with that body... and he let them. He had gone so long without anyone but Bucky touching him that he sometimes felt starved for it. What he got as Cap was a far cry from a friendly arm slung around his shoulder, and it was enough to have some part of him purring with contentment.
“It was fine,” he said instead of preening the way he wanted to. Steve let out a sound that was close to a growl, glaring back over his shoulder at where Tony assumed Probably-Nathan and Maybe-Debbie were still standing.
He had been the one to say 'hey', but Bruce got greeted first. That was... it was fucking fine, that's what it was. Didn't matter and it definitely didn't hurt his feelings. He wasn't a little kid anymore and he had learned not to be so goddamned sensitive. Tony was definitely not going to let it get to him. He wasn't sulking into his mug either.
"Ya really are a genius." The tease went unanswered, because the man claimed his mouth in another demanding kiss. That was fine though. He'd get Steve back later.
Thanks so much for all of your lovely comments!! They really make my day. <3 Many thanks also for reading and I hope you enjoy!
"Sounds like you've got it all figured out," he murmured as he watched a drop of condensation roll down the side of the glass. "Didn't need me at all so I don't know why you're suddenly checking in." He was being an ass and he
and our kids. Gonna do whatever it takes ta prove it ta ya too. Bucky..." Briefly there was a ball of emotions lodged in his throat, choking him. It was Tony's turn to caress his cheek, understanding in his eyes without sorrow enough to drown the whole world alongside it. "He's real important ta me, it's true. But now I know that he's safe. The Defenders'll take care-a him and I know that. So I ain't gotta go rushin' off ta see him, alright? I can wait a bit."
He fought a grin as Bruce toasted him right back, and they took a sip in concert. The tea was the perfect temperature, and who the fuck knew how Bruce managed that every single time. Tony would suspect magic if his science bro didn't swear it off as fervently as he did. So he could take a pretty good gulp right off the bat, and he tried to do the thing Bruce talked about where he 'rolled it over' his tongue to try and catch 'all the particular notes of the flavor'. There was maybe a bit of chocolate or something? Maybe some spice?
"Huh. So are there like, parallel worlds or something? Because it's not really my area but Ned - he's my best friend even if I didn't tell him about, you know, the... uh..." Blushing again, the kid, mimed shooting the webs Steve had seen in footage of him, keeping the gesture more subtle than he would have given the teen credit for. "He doesn't know. No one does."
“You shouldn’t be so modest, Tony.” The guy - Nathan? Probably-Nathan took his chance to press a little closer, fingers running up Tony’s bicep. “You’re quite the… asset to the team.” He squeezed down on Tony’s arm suggestively while peering over his shoulder. He was lucky he hadn’t gotten goosed, and fuck why wasn’t Steve walking away? Every other time this had happened Steve had turned tail - or rather, made a tactical retreat. Tony could then shake the admirers loose instead of having people in his personal bubble with fingers stroking him. Thank fucking God those fingers were staying in mostly appropriate places.
cared about all his kids, not just the ones that had bodies. "But would your friends really want to meet them?" Meet
"Do you think... look, it's stupid but..." he paused to chew on his lower lip, which just about killed Tony right on the spot. It was a struggle not to bite down on one knuckle when Captain America then somehow managed to look up at him through his lashes. The guy was at least a foot taller than him, so that should not be possible but it was giving him very inappropriate thoughts, and holy hell. Tony was going to give him whatever he wanted. "Do you think maybe you could call me Steve?"
"I don't really need Ms. Potts rescuing me. Even if JARVIS didn't open those doors in an hour, you still wouldn't get nothin' outta me." The twinkle in those blue eyes was just... ugh. Fuck, the guy was smiling, and... and... and
But we can't do it without the two of you. I brought you to Soul, Tony, and with Time I brought you and Steve together. I've touched both of you, even if I didn't claim you. Soul doesn't really need my help to use you, though.
"Shhh... don't worry. Not gonna make you take it from my hand right away sweetheart. That'd be mean. We're takin' our time to get to know each other, remember? Just wanted you to have something to eat while we did that."
"They better not try to come to the tower," Harley muttered before shoving at Kamala again. "And will you get
Before he could express his confusion, Rogers barreled right on. "Me and him, we would have figured it out - always have. After some time we would have... but then
This is soooooo late, I'm sorry. Between work and being ill I just haven't been able to write much recently. Also posting this on my phone because I'm at work, so sorry for any wonkiness. :'D
. "I'm sorry, FRIDAY. I never should have done it and I won't ever do it again. And if it helps put your mind at ease, anythin' we talk about ya can tell Tony. No secrets this time, alright?"
. "Like I've said, there doesn't appear to be any damage remaining to their bodies. Everything has healed quickly - too quickly. What's left is a little bit of scar tissue, and I don't think Steve's heart will ever be quite the same, but overall they're healthy. There's nothing for the Cradle to fix."
One day Steve slipped a ring on Tony's left hand, quietly and without any fanfare. The band was white gold, the middle inset with small gears done in yellow gold. It didn't take long for the gesture to be returned. Steve's ring was simpler, a gold band with a thin strip of arc reactor blue running around the middle. That was all it took before they slid into the 'married' category in everyone's mind. They didn't need the ceremony part of it, though they eventually gave into their kids and had one that was only attended by family.
Time and Space lingered in the little things, in the myriad of tiny aches and pains that ebbed and flowed like the tide. It had been a while (a century and another world) since Steve had felt anything like it. Since the serum pain had been temporary, quick to fade and leave him in the pink of health again. Now it lingered for the first time in a long time, an unwelcome guest that refused to leave. The new flutter and quiver of his heartbeat was the hardest thing to adjust to. He could handle the way his eyes were sensitive to light. Even if he hated the way his toes and fingertips always ached with cold for the first few hours after he woke up it was something he could manage.
that time, and he did it best in the workshop. A few hours of tinkering and building would do the man some good, and maybe he'd come to the realization that Steve really hadn't been trying to hurt him. Dinner would probably do a lot to cheer him up too, what with all the shenanigans their kids were always getting into. The two of them, Rhodey and Alicia were usually in stitches halfway through the meal and even Pepper had been known to giggle helplessly from time to time. After dinner he'd take Tony to bed and try to soothe over any remaining hurt feelings with words of love and devotion.
Comfortable silence fell, interrupted briefly when Steve wandered out in actual clothes, the loser. He caught his dorky
"When I'm having a bad day it's a definite possibility. I might have Fri do some fun edits or something. Ooh! We could make a meme?"
From the clenched jaw Rogers was sporting he wanted to demand an end to any chatter. Luckily the star spangled dick wasn't in charge, and also was busy with the horrifying dog-demons Thanos' children had brought to the party. They were on the same side, so he skimmed overhead and used his repulsors to take the worst of the pressure off. Rogers actually saluted him before barreling through the chaos towards his precious Bucky - of course.
An hour later when her head was in his lap and she was letting him stroke one hand down her side, he knew it had been.
"Okay, okay. Now who's gettin' off track? I think what I'm gettin' here Pegs is that ya think it'd be a mistake to go rushin' off ta see him."
"I trusted them too, Tony. You might be the one that almost--" She stopped herself by biting her lower lip, anger and loss and love an upsetting cocktail in her eyes and expression. "You're the one they hurt the most and I could kill them for that alone, but you aren't the only one they betrayed. I trusted them. I
Despite all of that, all of the doubts and insecurities that plagued him - the way they always had, because he was too damn sensitive - Tony was pretty sure the Avengers liked him. Maybe not as much as he cared about all of them, but still. They still
"It's not shopping, Steve." For all his indignance, Tony was still starting to blush a little. "You don't just
Those thoughts he was still keeping from his Tiny Adorable lover. He didn't need to be dealing with that, not yet. Not when they'd only just gotten each other back.
It took him a beat to respond, because talking to Tony always drove everything else from his brain and he needed to finish the line he was drawing before that happened. "Yeah? Need me to hold or lift something for ya?"
"More requests for interviews and shit," Tony murmured into his shoulder while setting his tablet aside. "I turned most of them down. If that kid Caleb asks for another--"
Studiously looking anywhere but the entrance, he didn't realize his lost friend had entered the room until he heard an awkward clearing of a throat. He didn't startle only because he consciously locked his muscles; because of
From the corner of his eye he saw Natalia slip out of the room. It made another warm, cozy feeling settle in his chest. She'd been there as a chaperone after all. He had no doubt that she'd been instructed to monitor his behavior just as much as she was watching Winter's. They'd both proved themselves and now she was showing she trusted them.
"People promise all kinds of things, Steve. When you told me that you didn't know they were going to find
, Peter. Long as ya don't let it stop you from doin' what's gotta be done. And you kicked ass today little brother. So don't beat yourself up, okay?"
Hope already had Scott by the ear and was dragging him off. She was scolding him, voice a hissing whisper. He looked terrified and wasn't even trying to fight her, which was a very small point in his favor. He'd earned a lot more when he'd sent the Ant Man suit to the Avengers Compound almost immediately after taking shelter in Wakanda. Scott had been the only Rogue not to keep on with the whole vigilante justice thing. Tony kind of hoped he turned out not to be a shitty person after all.
So! Next chapter will involve a time skip element, and I'd kind of like to show that with some vignettes in a style I don't usually do. I'm gonna have some kind of 'press release' that'll detail all of the New Avengers and reveal Steve's new superhero name.
a little bummed when the seemingly abandoned glaive and spear followed after them like faithful dogs. He'd really wanted to deconstruct and study them - it was a loss he'd totally take now that the enemy was down two heavy hitters.
. Sure it wouldn't have been romantic because there was no way Tony would want to kiss or anything else with that skinny, sickly version of him... but yeah. It was easy to believe Tony wouldn't have hesitated to get attached to little Stevie Rogers.
I just wanted to make sure I mentioned that so nobody thought I meant Uncle Ben. XD Especially since I had that flub of naming Harley's mom 'Karen' when that's the name of the AI in Peter's suit. XD I have since changed it, but one eagle-eyed reader already pointed out that inconsistency, which I need to go fix in the second chapter because I don't think I did yet.
"So it'll be fun for both-a us then. Good." Tony met his sigh with a kiss to the underside of his jaw before settling his head back on his shoulder. "Dunno why everyone's gotta be houndin' us so much. We deserve a vacation, ya ask me, not everybody demandin' we show up here there'n everywhere ta tell 'em about it for the hundredth time."
Vision had Wanda circling him like a mad dog - trying to get her focus anywhere other than protecting him would have been futile, so they used her obsession instead. Both versions of Loki were keeping an eye on that situation, even if his Loki went even paler with fear every time Thanos began to close in. Vision himself was utilizing the Mind Stone to try and keep the Titan from closing in, aided by Strange with the Time Stone and Carol with the Tesseract-contained Space Stone. The three of them so far had been able to split his attention, but Tony could read the landscape, and he knew that they were
"Look, if you're overthrowing Pepper's tyranny and declaring an end to her sovereign rein... we could be in here all night Cap. I've got all the time in the world and an awful lot of projects to work on. You're gonna get real bored, real fast."
I wanted to get this chapter and the next up yesterday, but editing didn't happen in time. ;.; I don't know if I'll get the next one done tonight, but it'll be up tomorrow if not!
So this one takes us through about a year and a half with a few scenes. There'll be another chapter to get through the next year and a half to when Thanos will be showing up in my timeline.
Steve had been assured that his re-branded super-self would soon be available for public consumption - he was pretty sure that meant it was almost time to start fighting the good fight again. He had mixed feelings about that and Pepper seemed just as conflicted. Tony though... Tony was chomping at the bit, ready to be back in the armor and defending the earth. His lover was sure they were running out of time, and he wanted to join the team again as quickly as possible.
His groan interrupted whatever it was Peggy had said which was probably kind of rude. But 'Agent Carter says' had gotten old
"You think Harley and Rhodey can distract that thing long enough for us to do a combined blast?" As they both shot back towards the Nightmare Beast, it was almost like dancing. They were so well in sync, weaving around each other with ease. It was kind of amazing, something he would be reveling in if only the stakes weren't so damned high. "Dunno if STAR's got enough firepower to blast through from the inside."
"And Tappy has a family he doesn't want to leave behind either." Brown eyes filled with tears, and he wished he knew if hugs were welcomed or not. "You aren't supposed to leave family behind."
“No, the point is that you’re covering my ‘bot in that gross stuff. Why you stormed down here instead of just taking a shower--”
As he ate and waited for Peter to come back, he weighed his options. On the one hand, Tony had apparently forbidden Fri from even
"I don't know about you two, but I feel underdressed," he said to Steve and Pep, refusing to take his eyes off the rogues. "You should have let me know this was a 'bring
She was patient as well, which was nice. Nat never seemed to mind when it took him a couple seconds to clumsily translate in his head and another few moments to ponder how to answer back in the same language.
There was a pressure building in his left temple, one that didn't make sense with the small injuries he'd taken. Tony did his best to ignore it, shake it off, but it was
He had half-expected Nat, or maybe Clint to be checking in on him. They were worried about him, especially Nat. She'd been playing the part of mother hen to a T since Tony's injury. She forced him to eat, decided when he would be sleeping, and once dragged him into the shower by his ear and proceeded to strip him down under a stream of cold water. He had finally managed to fend her off when he was left only in his briefs. By then it had been easier to just finish getting clean... mostly because she had leaned back against the door to stand guard.
Satisfied his youngest wasn't about to be shot down by a pissed off Widow, he turned his attention briefly to Sam, who looked like he might join in the fight between the two versions of Steve Rogers. When he stepped toward them, however, Pep took a pointed step of her own. He loved how unsure of her they were; he'd never given them more than a vague snapshot of what she was still capable of. Given everything currently happening and the history of the Avengers, he absolutely reveled in the way Sam immediately stopped moving, stink-eye now focused on her.
"We're connected, pops." Harley's smile was crooked but genuine, and it felt like someone was squeezing his heart but in a really good way. In the best way, really, because that squeeze was about
“You don’t need to thank me Tony. They shouldn’t have…” Steve’s lips went thin with disapproval, prompting another smile from him. “I didn’t like the way they were touching you,” he finally said. There was a touch of something dark in his voice that sent a tingle of delight up Tony’s spine.
That was a bit rich coming from the guy who'd just called their 'special guests' assholes, but Tony figured he'd let it slide. He was too busy feeling warm and loved to start scolding anyone. Harley nodded once to Steve, then sidled over his way until their arms were brushing against each other. Tony was dismayed to realize the kid was now almost as tall as he was - the teen was growing like a weed and he wanted it to stop now.
You were too young. Holding the memory would only have hurt you, more deeply than I hurt you now. I am a force beyond your reckoning little Mechanic. It would have shattered the mind of the Tinkerer you were then if you were allowed to remember me. Still. Space did us both a great favor when it brought you to me.
though. Steve rolled his eyes every time and some of the Defenders had absolutely no patience for it... but even Loki and Lokes gave quiet little smiles whenever they got to program the gate. Peter was giddy to finally be the one to pick out the symbols - he'd never been fast or forward enough to secure the right. Harley was a good brother for noticing and then correcting that oversight.
They still hadn't opened their eyes, but now... now Rhodey felt like they actually would again. The fear he'd been trying so hard to ignore, the one that whispered his best friend was dead and gone and his body just hadn't gotten the message yet, began to fade. Hope was a wonderful thing, and he couldn't wait to share it with the rest of their people.
"Sure Tony. We oughta stop on the way home'n get her some clothes. Doubt anythin' she has is better than what she's got on."
He rolled his eyes and didn't dignify Tony's snark with a response. 'Just Dance' was a weird game and that was just that. Still, he didn't mind the warm laughter at his expense or the way they'd all rack up scores that left his in the dust. It was the way things went when they played this damn game and everyone knew it... just like they knew Steve could kick all of their asses when it came to most battle royale style games.
So if he cancelled this trip he would have to deal with their disappointed faces right away. After that would be anarchy sanctioned by most of the other adults in his life. They'd all been saying he should go for a visit. Well, everyone but Steve anyway. His
"And that the guy was our sort of brother. Nephew? Either way he's one of ours. They both said that I shouldn't trust him with the cooking, which is weird. I don't have taste buds either but I can follow a recipe. It's not hard."
So this is the third time I've rewritten these two chapters. I decided I wasn't happy with them once and - in a fit of ill-tempered and impetuous writer's pique - I deleted them in such a way that I couldn't recover them. I tried again but it was garbage because I was still mad about losing the first attempts which I had decided were not that bad.
"I should really get a therapist. Fuck." Tony ran his hands down his face, a lost look in his eyes. This was as close to a real fight that they'd had since he'd come back to this world and he hated it. All he wanted to do was go wrap his fella up in his arms and promise to keep anything from hurting him ever again. Wasn't a promise he could keep though, and it wasn't really one that would do Tony any good in the end. Getting up on his feet and moving forward from what had happened to him was going to hurt - there was just no way around it.
"Tony would be f..." He stopped, because Tony wouldn't be. He knew his fella, and there was no way Tony wouldn't tear himself to pieces in his grief. "How 'bout we let the full-time Avengers do any train hoppin'?"
Harley was the more mature one of the pair of them, because he only rolled his eyes and ignored the playful dig. He pulled out his tablet and gave the surface a few taps. Interestingly, his cheeks got a little pink as he did. The kid looked torn between embarrassment and hope when he handed the thing over, eyes trained carefully on Tony's face.
So he wasn't surprised when Pepper ended up on his other side, her murderously high heels tossed away so she could tuck her bare toes under his thigh. Before too long everyone had reconvened... and he did mean everyone. The Other Loki had quickly commandeered a loveseat nearby so he could have sole cuddle-custody of the Other Tony, and it was... kind of really disturbing, so he decided to just ignore it. It was harder to pretend he didn't see how overjoyed Steve was by said couple cuddling.
"Does he always speak for you?" Winter ignored the growling protest Rogers immediately lodged - he still hadn't even glanced at him. "I can shoot him so he has to go to medical for a while. Probably heals up as quick as Stevie here, but it'd give you a few minutes of privacy at least."
Her tail was wagging again, thudding against the ground in an uncertain rhythm. The whole of her attention was now on the opened bag of jerky for dogs, and while he thought it smelled disgusting she clearly disagreed. When he pulled out a piece her eyes followed his hand but her tail stopped, posture looking a little defensive again.
"Mary Mother-a.... sweetheart, I'm not-- no. Later. You'll see and we'll talk later. I sent the Defenders that came up ta the Penthouse - thought ya might not want 'em on our floor and Pep said she don't mind. Alicia took the kids--"
"Really. Got sketchbooks full of pictures of you too, 'cause you're so damn beautiful it hurts sometimes. Why the hell do you think Clint started calling us mom and dad? Or why they all try to get you to agree with them on what we eat or watch? They all know how I feel about you and that... how's that saying go? With you goes my nation?"
It wasn't that he disliked Colonel Rhodes, who insisted Steve not use his rank when they were in the tower. When they were one on one Steve thoroughly enjoyed their conversations. The man was brilliant, fierce and skilled, a credit to the Air Force and the country. He was glad Rhodes had been born in a time where he could achieve the high rank he deserved; he'd known too many soldiers held back by the color of their skin while white men less deserving claimed all the honor. Race relations had gotten better, even if he was learning that there was still a long way to go.
He joined the fight against the hellhounds with an easy conscience, not quite believing that they might
"I do. And I'm terribly sorry for it Steven, but... I want his recovery to go as well and as smoothly as possible. Seeing you might throw a wrench in it all and gum up the works. I don't want that for either of you. I think if you give us a month or two that will change, but..."
"No I won't be, because maybe he likes me but he don't want me for that role. Still. I'll take it if I gotta because that kid needs it, but he'll be comin' ta the tower. It's my home too'n I got all-a the same permissions ya do. He's gonna be here whether ya get your head outta your ass or not. But you're gonna be the one ta tell him, face-ta-face, that ya don't want ta work with him. I'm not takin' that bullet for ya, not when I think that deep down ya know that Peter would be far better off if you're in his corner."
was like a study in paradoxes, one that appealed to the scientist and mathematician in him. Maybe Steve was right after all.
- you came back for me. You wanted to be here and they can't have you back. I'll fucking fight them if I have to." Because Fri was as much of a dramatic shit as her old man and they both had impeccable timing, the Iron Man gauntlet snapped into place as Tony finished the last word, the whine of the arc reactor already filling the air. "Last time I couldn't... they
"I get it. The thought of anyone hurting you makes me want to put on armor again and kick a little ass, so I get it. Besides - it was hilarious. You're fucking tiny and he went down like he'd been hit with a battering ram. Did you see how embarrassed he was?" Tony gave a snort of laughter, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Bet he thought you were a shrimp who'd go down easy. You sure as hell showed him. And there's footage! I forgot there would be footage. Fri, make sure that gets saved please. Forever. For posterity. Slightly lower priority than all the stuff of me and your dad here."
Steve had been solemnly presented with a golden apple years before that. Tony and Shellhead had been doing experiments with the version of Extremis cooked up in Steve's universe, and something had gone horribly wrong. The race to save them had ended with the pair of them forever altered. Tony confided to Steve that the change was one he welcomed; something about the way Extremis worked inside of his body eased the pain that lingered after Soul. Once he understood what had happened, Thor had obtained an apple for Steve; they had been forced apart too many times, he told them, and if it was within his power to keep that from happening again any time soon, then by the Norns he would do it.
so of course he would leave. Steve Rogers was always going to give everything up for Bucky Barnes - it was just the way things were going to work no matter what universe they were in.
and he'd never been good being anything other than an ass when he was in pain. Lashing out kept people from looking too close after all. If he could just piss Steve off enough then they wouldn't have to have a conversation about their feelings before the guy left, and he wouldn't have to hear any more empty promises that would only get his hopes up.
My internet situation is going to be a bit more iffy than I initially thought - I knew I was moving before, but my mum ran into some unexpected expenses because my brother is a moron, so. She can't change her cable plan for a couple more weeks, which means I only have internet at my apartment, where I will only be a few days a week. Depending on how it goes I might just aim for a different posting day.
During their side conversation Rogers' face had turned a deep shade of red, one that appeared a lot whenever he was in the room with the guy. At least he'd relaxed his fists. Though the way he was edging closer to Bucky and trying to step out in front of him wasn't a great sign.
before the 'trash' thing and didn't seem like it would go away any time soon. He still wasn't sure if he found Winter's crush adorable or disturbing; Pegs hadn't figured it out yet either. Personally he thought it was the whole 'Agent Carter' part of it that was throwing her. If the guy would just call her Peggy it'd probably clear up a lot of the confusion.
"I'm breathing," he defended, still unable to look away from the squabbling happening in front of him. Rogers was positioned in front of Wanda like she needed his protection, while Clint was standing nearby with his bow already drawn. At least Sam didn't look eager to join the fight, and Natasha was still trying to get Jess to look at her long enough to start a stare-down. "I am breathing very well, thanks."
Fuck, she was something. Maybe part of him was sad he hadn't gotten to watch her grow into herself ... but the rest of him felt pretty damn honored to see who she'd grown into.
The Titan had brought hordes against them, even more than the Black Order had. The demon dogs were back, along with what chitauri were't laying siege to the rest of Earth. Joining the returning cast was a race that looked like oversized sea cucumbers with terrifying mouths full of teeth that could spit acid several feet. Luckily they were few in number, and mostly being handled by the Iron Legion - the flesh and blood heroes had more pressing matters to handle.
Happy was fond of him in his own way, but most of that was shown indirectly. It wasn't hugs and friendly touches, wasn't a hand resting on his shoulder to help him find a way to face himself and the world. Pepper had been even stiffer a first. The cutting remarks she'd made the first few times he got touchy-feely had almost been enough to make him bleed. Now that she saw the lack of intent behind it she was better about pressing gentle touches to his forearm and letting him do the same. She sent warm smiles his way whenever he took something directly from her hands and no longer teased him about his shitty decisions. Well, not as much and not in the same way. Her judgments didn't make him feel like crying or dying anymore - he could take them in stride because it was so obvious that she loved him the same way Rhodey did.
He was one of mine, little Mechanic, just as he was yours. And he chose to give that up, chose to give his life in service of you and your world to keep Mind from spreading the taint Thanos had cast upon it. Because of who he was, who you are to both of us... I chose to accept his sacrifice. It follows the spirit of the rules, if not the letter of them. I am Soul, and I decide when such spirit should be honored. I hold him close to me, little Mechanic, and treasure him the way you did.
If the fucker would just go, he could dismiss them. Instead he was hovering with a face like a thundercloud, and Tony wasn’t sure why. It was messing with their system and now they were both trapped.
worse things to use as blackmail. Besides - dancing while he worked was part of his process and he had mad moves anyway. His singing voice was a little more questionable, which was why he mostly only mouthed along while jamming out. He didn't need his boys judging him, which they absolutely would. So it was better to limit himself to the dancing and the lip syncing because he excelled at both.
have a chance with Tony after all. Maybe they could be more than friends after all, because even if Tony was pretty tactile sometimes, hugs between friends didn't usually last for five minutes. That felt more like a romantic thing, and maybe it wasn't just wishful thinking to acknowledge that. Maybe... maybe someday Tony could love him back.
For a long moment there was only silence between them. Tony had known Steve was upset, but he hadn't realized… fuck. He'd lost so much - everything, actually - so it was no wonder he was shaken. He just wish he'd realized it before he'd gone and put his foot in his mouth. Steve deserved good things. All the good things, which included friends who knew when to stop joking and just be normal. Jesus fuck, he was the worst.
, not the way Tony'd always believed they would be. If the Rogues had refused to sign the Accords or accept their benched status... well. It wouldn't have really been any skin off the Avengers’ noses. All it would have meant was an active hunt for the Rogue's mobile base to bring them in far less peaceably. This way was for the best PR-wise, but it wasn't their only choice. Hell, Rhodey had voted it down, as had (he suspected) Steve, Harley, Pepper and Matt. The democratic approach meant they had to suck it up anyway, but it gave him that warm, tingly feeling to know they'd voted a resounding 'no' mostly for his sake.
Harley Keener was just as much a mother hen as he was, with the added benefit of being able to talk engineering with Tony. It was a weight off his mind, because there were some things he needed to do, take care of, and he couldn't do all of them at his fella's side. A few days after his return they had all settled into a nice routine. He got a good morning cuddle session in with Tony then chatted with Viz as they got breakfast ready. The android’s main responsibilities were to cut things and ask any questions that were on his mind. He didn't like to judge, but a lot of those questions were weird. Hearing about the way he'd been a bit dizzy over Wanda for a while drew out a scoff. Hearing about her very physical betrayal of him had Steve fuming and ready to fight the witch.
"So." They stared at each other, and he felt that strange tension between them mount again. He hated it, didn't know how to diffuse it, and so he just kept on staring.
They were on the prowl, the two of them. If Steve hadn’t looked so fucking panicked Tony would have let him have a kinky good time. Threesomes could be a lot of fun if you were in the right mood. He wasn’t, but they didn’t need to know that until Steve had gone to hide with Bruce.
released from medical. His team seemed pretty determined to keep him there for the doctor recommended length of time, which was lame. Fractured ribs, head wounds and minor to major blood loss were nothing new in his life as Iron Man even if he didn’t deign to share every incident of them happening with everyone. Steve and Clint in particular had seemed horrified by the doctor’s report though, so he had a feeling he was in for serious check-ups after every battle for a while. Nat had been blank-faced with concern while Thor merely grumbled something about vulnerable mortals and apples - he’d been too loopy with pain meds to really process words.
Tony's entire body froze, eyes wide and startled enough that he worried the man would run. "Really? You wanted... but she's your dog, Steve."
had already vehemently refused to use the name Captain America in this world, which was sort of a shame because the one they'd wound up with kind of sucked. As entertaining as it would be, he couldn't send the guy out to fight naked either.
A knife sprouted in the wall behind Rogers' head, having moved through the air too fast for even his eyes to track. At least Winter hadn't gone for the gun. He looked to Rogers and couldn't quite hold back a small sigh when he saw blood trickling down the right side of the man's throat. It was little more than a nick, a warning that even Rogers couldn't ignore, but he was worried that it was about to become a huge fucking deal.
"Steve decided he didn't like what he was wearing," Tony informed me, a broad grin on his face. "He's going to be so mad at himself for not being here when you came in. He'll be pissed at me if I don't offer you something to drink." It was the first time I heard Maverick's name, and he'd dropped it in as casually as he might mention the weather.
"Me and STAR get first crack though. Wait here, 'less ya decide ya wanna get a few hits in. Then they'd be all yours." From the corner of his eye he could see the way the three rogue Avengers were practically squirming with frustration at being ignored. Then Steve leaned up and gave him a sweet, lingering kiss... and half the satisfaction that came from it was seeing Rogers' jaw drop and hearing Sam's whispered 'holy shit'.
And if after all that and their parting Steve still had that stupid dirty rag, that was his business. Nobody but JARVIS needed to know that he folded it up and tucked it into his nightstand, and that was only because he trusted the AI to keep quiet about it. Even if it had only been a joke, Tony had given Steve his favor and let him play the white knight.
Dum-E zoomed after the ball, making all kinds of noises that told Steve just how happy he was. He missed the ball on the first bounce - almost definitely on purpose - then got to chase after it again when it hit the leg of a table and headed a different way. A warm smile on his lips, he turned away to start drawing, because Dum-E always took a while to get bored enough to have someone throw the ball again. When he did though, it was to find Tony standing way closer than he had been, an unreadable expression on his face.
The dog that he’d found was a shivering, whimpering mess. He wasn't sure if her fur was actually a muddy gray or if she was just covered in filth that made it look that way. Hell, he wasn't sure that she even was a she - he had just looked into her eyes and been struck with the sense that this was a lady he was dealing with. She was still flinching away from his every attempt to reach out to her, and that was okay. He could be patient, even if he longed to swoop her away and get her warm and fed. The spots of blood in her fur and the too-tight collar around her neck spoke of rough treatment. Steve was more than willing to go at her pace if it would earn him a bit of trust.
He was so dizzy with the fella it was ridiculous. Buck would have a field day if he could see the way Steve was acting.
"Don't answer him, sis," Harley told her, which was playing dirty. Fri almost always did what she was asked when he called her that. Thankfully she had yet to go against any of her core protocols, but he suspected it was only a matter of time. "We're gonna be late if we don't get a move on."
and Steve didn't even fucking have a speech planned yet. "I, uh. Talked to Thor. About what I'd have to do to get an apple. Two maybe, depending on how the serum works out in the end. He thinks I've got a good shot and he said he'd bring it up with his ma as soon as... well. Guess he's going to be talking to her soon."
"I probably won't be coming back for a while," Peggy informed him with a sad twist to her lips. "Natalia and I are running point on helping Winter and she'll probably want to be the one to visit next. One of us has to be there, so--"
He thought about Peter, who sounded like he really, really needed to believe that coping got easier.
3 - My friends, we still live in troubled times and I for one am not super pumped with how the leadership in my country has handled it. So I gotta say - if you are not registered to vote, REGISTER!! And then please, please, please exercise your right to vote! It's so important, and for those of us in the States it's just... it's so important. Mail-in ballots are not the devil, and with the pandemic going on it's critical that we all use that as a way to make our voices heard if we aren't able to go in person. VOTE!
"But anyway, my friend Ned likes to read about those kinds of theories. You know, about parallel universes and stuff. Like every decision spawns off a different one, so there are countless like, threads of this world, you know? Like, you meeting me here is happening in
Both 'bots beeped in interest while STAR jumped down on top of U, giving him a brief pat. She was far more careful when she dropped down onto the bed and then came to curl against his neck.
"I am... surprisingly okay with that. We should get a welcoming room or something set up though. I wonder how well we can refine that inter-dimensional GPS..."
Steve could find a sense of peace and comfort in other places now that he had a home, but he still visited the gym frequently. It was nice to have a few people he could spar with where he didn't have to hold back as much. Thor was his favorite though, followed closely by Tony in the armor - with those two, he didn't have to hold back at all.
It meant he'd be sitting next to Tony, who was looking over at him again while the archer gleefully shot Tony's character full of holes. This time the smile he offered was genuine - the genius' answering smile lit up his whole face. It was enough to make a guy blush, and it wasn't the first time he'd cursed his fair skin when Tony was around. He ducked his head to try to hide it but couldn't banish the grin from his face. Even though he was tempted to sit close enough that he and Tony would be pressed together from shoulder to knee, he collapsed onto the couch closer to the arm rest.
When Peggy and Loki came to their floor early in the morning, Steve feared another descent into worry and guilt and fear on Tony's part. Instead his lover gave him a quick kiss, then announced he was going to talk to Pepper about official SI business. He took that as code for 'gossiping about the Defenders'. Peggy stared after him with keen interest, probably cataloging all the same differences that he had always taken note of. Loki merely yawned and draped himself in one of the chairs because he was a dramatic fuck who was probably almost fanatical in his devotion to Shellhead.
Maybe he should have had the teen grab actual food... but it was too late to change things now. Besides, he'd feed her the good stuff after he got her home and had a vet take a look at her. Once he'd read up on what was best for her to eat and all that too. He wanted to make sure he got the best stuff to feed his new girl, after all.
"You should marry me," popped out of his mouth unbidden, which what the fuck? It was not even remotely the time for that shit, not when this could still easily turn into a real fight. Not when that bastard Rogers was still breathing in his general vicinity with the other traitors who had broken the Avengers along with his goddamn heart. Not when four members of the Defenders were still waiting upstairs to take his Tiny Adorable Steve away.
And between the protective rage he saw in Pepper's eyes, the cold fury he saw in Steve's and STAR's bloodthirsty nature... he felt pretty goddamn safe, and it let him stand tall as he watched the elevator. Hell, he almost felt
Two is that, in this story, Tony and Pepper never actually dated. They are super close, but not romantically interested in each other. They are very much 'ride or die' tho, along with Rhodey. XD
"Harley? I understand. Believe me when I say I do. But ya gotta understand somethin'." Steve's face had gone all soft and compassionate, and all he wanted to do was wrap his lover up in a tight hug and hide in him until this was over. "We're a team, right? All-a us. Your Uncle Rhodey and Carol decided we were all gonna get some input on this - they were trustin' us when they did that. Most of us decided ta put our personal feelin's aside and bring the Rogue Avengers back home. They ain't joinin' the team ta be part-a it the way we are, right? They ain't earned that yet. Right now we're just showin' a united front ta bring them home. That's what bein' a team is about sometimes. And if nothin' else, do ya think there's any way Tony's walkin' off this tarmac?"
stay still enough to keep Tony right where he was, but he gave it his best effort. The water was going to do him in if anything was, so a heartbeat after his wonderful surprise Steve carefully lowered the water bottle. He and Tony were staring into each other's eyes and his face was on fire like it always seemed to be whenever the other man was around. It might have been romantic if he didn't know that Tony only saw him as a friend.
"I might agree if you hadn't let me walk into the sofa." Pep sounded more annoyed than amused, but there was a smile tugging at her lips. Hopefully she'd stay in a good mood even after she saw her suit. "Now I'm afraid we're at war. All bets are off."
"Everyone. It's part of the gig, and I don't think that's a bad thing. It keeps us humble, keeps us from gettin' too reckless. It's
"Harley." Fuck, did his kid think his name wasn't going to be right there on the paperwork next to Peter's? He would
As Soul left the little Mechanic's body, it snagged onto Thanos' soul instead, dragging what remained of his essence into the pocket dimension that was its own. Thanos did not deserve the tender mercy of Death's realm; Soul would keep him close until he understood the error of his ways. Then someday, perhaps, she would have two Stonekeepers instead of one.
Tony Stark has been known to go to extremes to try and protect people. What's to say this won't go too far? How do we know this isn't something even worse than Ultron?
"Sweetheart?" Steve's voice broke into his thoughts at the same time as a pointed chin hooked on his shoulder and dug in. He met his lover's eyes through the mirror and offered the best smile he could muster through his anxiety. The other man's expression went soft and understanding - again, goddammit - and then arms wrapped tightly around him and squeezed. "If you don't wanna go--"
"Tony! Did you do this? I apologized for the misunderstanding dammit! You have no right to do this to us!" Face hard, Steve turned around and began a quick march toward Rogers, and fuck he hoped this wouldn't turn into a brawl. Then Harley was lifting off, leaving the whole mess behind them. Even as they flew away though, he could still hear Rogers shouting after them.
, the one that was so much better than anything he'd ever had. The one that came to him to tell him things, that worried about him, that
"Alright Captain Marvel, Fri - we're going for a serious injury here, not death - we want her and glaive guy off the field, not for the taller half to get a vengeance hard-on."
"Yes. And I hope you will do so soon as I see from your vitals and from Sir's that you are both working yourselves up into states of anxiety."
"On it. Keep the Legionnaires where they are, Tony." Armor that was so like his own swooped through the air, weaving through explosions from the Chitauri weapons and their speed cycles. "Those slugs are nasty pieces of work."
He wanted to be there for Tony in every way he could. Steve wanted to support his fella without following him blindly. The genius needed people who could argue with him, challenge him without being against him. Rhodey and Pepper weren't enough, not all the time - he wanted to be that same kind of influence. He had no desire to be the 'boy toy' that Harley still teasingly called him. Steve was hoping that this could be the start of that.
"Okay. So lets--" Winter didn't even let him finish, just rolled his eyes and then pushed the door open and stalked right inside. "Or ya could ignore me and do whatever ya want. That's fine too. Mary Mother-a Christ this is gonna be a mess."
He wasn't sure how long the elevator doors were open, or how long Fri had tried to coax them out of it. Closing his eyes hadn't been intentional, really, and he hadn't even fallen to sleep, exactly. He had just been zoning, and that zone was very rudely interrupted by voices in his ear and gentle hands tugging at his arm.
Well, not really. His stomach and internal senses insisted that he was, but he knew his feet were as good as glued down. The sensation was as unsettling as everyone had always described. The feeling intensified, and for a few moments he felt
“Doctor Who is a great idea.” Everyone else groaned when Steve agreed which - rude. Doctor Who was a great show and anyway that was only two votes. Thor and Bruce hadn’t said anything yet, so it wasn’t like they were for sure going to watch it.
He growled and rolled them over, pinning Tony to the bed. His ridiculous, unrepentant lover just grinned up at him. After a moment of the kind of eye contact that made his face flame even hotter, the other man arched his back and pressed up into his body. He couldn't help but shiver, unable to stop his hips from jerking forward. The smirk on Tony's face was begging to be bitten away, so he leaned down and did just that. It wasn't a night for slow, lazy lovemaking. Tony would need something different... and he was very invested in giving his lover
“I can't… I don't wanna joke about this Tony. When I saw…” He stopped and took a deep breath before pressing his lips together again. “I thought you were dead. You weren't answerin’ and JARVIS-- I haven't ever heard him sound like that. I never wanna hear it again either. So just… maybe just can it with the smartass remarks about dying. ‘Least until I can get the picture of you crumpled beneath a goddamn streetcar with a telephone pole crushing your torso outta my head.”
The first strand of silly string was a complete surprise. It hit him just below his right eye and was a bright green. He flinched back on reflex and was both pleased and a little scared when he saw Loki had moved into a defensive position. "It's just the kids!" he called as Dum-E began to spray him down. U, armed with neon pink silly string, began to give the mage the same treatment. They weren't allowed fire extinguishers on this floor, so with the help of STAR they had improvised.
As much as the selfish part of him wanted to be Tony Stark's everything, it was really, really nice to remember that Tony had always had people in his corner.
Disappointment wasn't a new feeling for him - it was closer to an old, familiar friend. Maybe the source of the feeling this time was especially painful, but once the hurt and fury had passed, well. Tony would be happy to sink into the dull, persistent feeling that had lived in his bones since he was four and realized Howard would never
Nat kept bringing him homemade Russian deliciousness that the hospital staff was too terrified to forbid. Clint in his turn would show up with fun, stupid little distractions to keep Tony from fuming about how he wasn’t allowed to work on any schematics until his concussion was a little more under control. Thor regaled him with epic tales from Asgard and the other realms while Bruce made sure he got the occasional caffeinated beverage and a lot of decaf tea between them.
, and dames wanted all those strappin' fellas going off to join up. They wanted to feel safe'n I don't blame them for it. Might have tried to get one of my own if I wouldn't have gotten beaten bloody for it." Tony made a small noise of surprise, and Steve felt himself start to blush furiously. "That part's not in the history books, I know. But I woulda been just as happy with a 'Peter' as a 'Peggy'. Knew I was never gonna have either."
When I stopped staring at him and finally closed my mouth, I had the presence of mind to say I didn't need anything. I ended up with a bottle of water anyway. "So Steve knows I tried, " Tony said with a shrug.
Winter was immediately, noticeably different from the man he'd known a lifetime ago. For one thing, Buck would have stayed in bed and refused to leave home if his hair had ever been so uneven. He was man enough to admit that it looked extremely attractive, however, the way the top of the man's hair and one side were long enough to reach his left shoulder while the right side was cut close to the scalp. The little braid he could see was a nice touch, and the style emphasized Winter's cheekbones and haunting eyes.
Thanks so much for sticking with me to the end! I've appreciated all the comments and kudos more than you can know.
. It would have all come out in the end, and it was better that Tony hadn't had the chance to convince himself that maybe, just maybe, Howard had been wrong. He hadn't had time to believe that he and Captain America could be
Tony woke to the smell of sausage cooking, the sound of the shower, and a slightly warm indent where Steve had previously been laying. He smiled at his thoughtful
The man looked... good, actually. Better than he'd been expecting. To be honest he'd thought maybe his Bucky would look as rough as Steve Grant's had when they first brought him in. That had been stupid of him, because they weren't the same people, not really. Not in all the little ways that counted for so much when added together. And anyway, he was Winter - why should he echo any Bucky's style?
Something was different between him and the genius, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was. Tony didn't seem distant, exactly, but he had almost had a heart attack when Steve had tried to follow him into the workshop the first day he had been allowed back. He'd been forcefully denied entry for the first time ever and it... it had hurt. Sure he was invited down a few hours later, but even then Tony had been cagey, hard to pin down. He was alternating between pressing right into Steve's space and pulling away whenever Steve touched him. He was either chatting a million miles an hour about nothing or falling into long, strange silences. And sure, he knew that he wasn't entitled to know all of the genius' business, but still Tony usually told him most of it anyway. Now he was hiding something, and it was all making his head spin.
All in all, it reeked of a move made out of terror and despair, not one that had been fully thought out. The two of them really ought to be reunited so they could work it out in person. Beyond that, Peter could probably use some support and guidance from people who knew who he was. Harley was about that same age and looking for a new school to boot - maybe they could be friends without that kind of heavy secret between them.
