I didn’t wait for him to leave before I walked out my own office. What the hell was that supposed to mean? Did he think other people didn’t respect me just because he might not?
Steve glanced over to me as he chewed a mouthful of his food. That man doesn’t waste any time, does he? It’s probably that super soldier appetite he has. The costs in groceries have gone up significantly since he moved into the tower almost a year ago now, but it doesn’t matter to me. I prefer my money going towards food than weapons.
Steve also realized that he is the only person that doesn’t change. Not only is he the only one to remember the previous Thursday’s, but he feels all injuries from the day before. With the serum his injures usually heal over night or by the other Thursday after, but he would still feel the remaining soreness or aches from where he got hurt the day before.
Steve lifted his head up after almost an hour of it being there to give Tony his version of a bitch face.
Mostly he tried to push it out of his mind. He had to figure out what was going on with him and who was doing this to him. He felt like he was out of his mind. He might as well be if he can remember 12 consecutive Thursdays and no one else could.
“What else could I possibly do? Not only is it like trying to find a needle in a haystack,” Steve paused to send a sharp look over to Tony. “That you cannot burn to quicken the process – by the way – but there’s a magical being trying to stop me.”
“Yeah, of course,” Steve nodded his head before he took another sip of coffee. “I was just curious about it.”
“Uhm,” Steve’s brows furrowed together as he counted on his free hand. “Four? It’s good stuff. Thor said he’ll bring me back some next time he visits.”
Steve set his plate of toast at the bar before sat down with his coffee and the newspaper that he got on his way back. He took a bite of toast as looked over the newspaper in simple bewilderment.
“You don’t get to call me that. Hell, you shouldn’t even be able to call me Tony,” He grounded out before he rubbed his hands over his face in distress. “What do you want from me, Rogers? The Avengers are disbanded. Bruce and Thor are MIA. Hawkeye is retired. You took Natasha with you in the divorce. And I’m not giving an apology.”
“Has it really been a long time?” Tony asked as he thought of the last time they just relaxed and talked. “I guess lately we’ve been catching up over missions or me working or you working out.”
His head was facing forward and there wasn’t the best lighting, but I could swear his cheeks turned that light shade of pink
That got Tony’s attention. He sat himself up on his elbows as he peered up to Steve. “You’re kidding, right?”
“Right on time as always,” I note as I take out a notepad where I’ve already jotted some ideas down on.
Steve just about frantically knocked on Tony’s door to his suit. He had to remain calm. He was Captian America.
“It’s…” Steve breathed out a little, his face a little more closed off than it had just been. “It’s been going good.”
He sighed before he smiled to Tony. “One movie.” Tony’s puppy eyes turned into a grin before he jumped for the remote. Steve shook his head fondly as he watched Tony before he stood up. This should be better. Tony didn’t go to the hospital and is trying to get him to stay longer.
“I…” Steve looked down to their hands, letting his thumbs brush over the tops of Tony’s hands. “I couldn’t handle it anymore,” He admitted defeatedly, his voice cracking. “I tried, Tony. I promised you one day that I wouldn’t give up on you, but that was the worst experience I’ve ever been through a-and…” His hands tightened on Tony’s hold. “I let you down. I’m sorrier for that than you can ever know.”
That simple gesture managed to calm Steve, just a couple fractions, as he let the wraps drop onto the floor. “I-I can’t say it. Not aloud. I feel like he can hear,” Steve closed his eyes, realizing how crazy that sounds. “Just follow me, okay? And bring the suit.”
Tony got off first. His hair wasn’t much of a mess, though only because he had been shielded by Steve’s torso for the majority of the wind.
Tony laughed a bit. “Army men just wanting to see girls in heels dance? Yep, that sounds right.” He leaned back after and smiled more warmly. “You know, I don’t think I ever saw any of your drawings before. You’re secretive about them, which I respect.”
Tony returned the smile with a twinkle in his eyes. “Seems like it, darling. Honestly, I’m more surprised that you didn’t expect that.”
Steve combed his fingers through his hair before he picked up his phone on the bedside table to check it. He froze in place.
“I came here to apologize, Tony. Before it gets too late. I don’t expect you to forgive or trust me. I know that’s too much to ask,” Steve rubbed his hand over his scruff. “I let my emotions get mixed up. It didn’t help that neither of us were taking the time to think. But if you ever need me, you know how to reach me.”
How could Steve think of leaving when he had someone like Tony there waiting for him when the loop is over?
I raise an eyebrow at him. “One room. Two queen beds. Is that available?” I ask straight to the point. It was better to get settled for the night fast. And by the look on Steve’s face, I could tell he saw the magazine as well.
“I’m trying to figure out which speech you’re referring to,” Steve chuckled as he shook his head. “The ones that I’ve heard of are when he announced he wasn’t selling weapons anymore with a burger stuffed in his mouth and the one when he announced he was Iron Man.”
Tony was startled at first by the kiss he didn’t see coming, but he kissed back once the moment of shock went away. His muscles untensed and he seemed to melt in Steve’s arms, finally coming to his senses. People stared for a couple reasons: it was two men who suddenly stopped and was kissing each other in the middle of the sidewalk, and they soon realized it was the one and only Tony Stark kissing Captain America.
“Such a party pooper,” Tony huffed as he leaned back into Steve’s chest and relaxed. “Fine. We’ll clean it up. Then I’m not doing anything until lunch, so I can actually enjoy my morning.”
That only aided in making Steve’s blush deepen. He cleared his throat, stood there awkwardly for a few seconds more, before he walked over to the door. “I’ll see you tomorrow, Tony.”
Tony nodded. “Yep. That. I like it.” He glanced up to Steve’s lips before he closed whatever remaining space was between them so their lips were connected.
Steve looks at my a little stunned before he just chuckles again. “As I said before, you have no absence of knowledge, Tony Stark.”
The top half was finally close enough to zip it. It was about damn time too. “Well that’s a little personal, Rogers,” I lie with a small laugh before I zip the suitcase, having to reach underneath Steve’s arms to get the zipper all the way. Christ was this man tense. Was I that hard to be around?
I grin a little to myself before I walk out the room. “Rogers, what’s the four-one-one?” I ask as I fold my arms over my chest accompanied with a curious look. I didn’t expect to see him until the morning.
As routine, he scaled a building and jumped over roofs before he snuck into the apartment. He held his shield close to himself and a knife in another hand as he looked around to see which rooms the dealers were in.
Tony leaned back against the back of the stool as he held his coffee cup close. “That’s the plan,” He replied with a nod to himself, thankful that Steve was faced away so Tony can take in Steve’s figure.
Tony pulled over on the side of the road, and it seemed to be a field. “Are you shitting me?” He turned to Steve with an incredulous look before he got out the car. “What am I even supposed to think of that?”
Steve shook his head and leaned back into the back of the chair. “No, like…” He tried to find the right way to describe it without sounding either insane or like he experienced it. “Just repeating a day. A person wakes up and it’s the same day. They fall asleep, wake up, and again it’s the same day.”
Loki was not easy to catch either when the Master of the Arts knew someone was after him. And Steve was definitely after that man.
“I can feel you staring, you know,” Steve mused as a smile tugged on the corners of his lips, his eyes never leaving the page.
“Tony let’s go out. I’ll buy the drinks,” Rhodey suggested as he walked out the elevator into the common floor. He looked around before he found Tony sitting at the bar in the kitchen. “You ready?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Steve, how many times do I have to tell you that you can’t lie to me?” He leaned forward and quirked a brow to Steve.
Steve scratched the back of his neck and tilted his head up to look at the sky. “Are you sure? I could have sworn yesterday was sunny.”
A laugh rumbled from Steve’s chest that was accompanied with a fond shake of his head. “That’s fair.”
Steve did not wake up to Friday when he went to bed that night. Even though they went in together, it didn’t work. Tony got injured again, but this time it was because he stupidly opened his faceplate to check on Steve then got a knife slashed across his eye.
. Steve. That’s not even a blurry, far off picture. It looks like they were right in front of the car with their damn camera!”
Steve stood back up in the water and walked over to the shore where Tony still was with his half-constructed sand castle. No matter what happened on any given Thursday, Tony was always there. Tony always believed in Steve. Tony always comforted Steve. Tony always opened up to Steve. Tony always worried for Steve. Tony was always…Tony.
“It wasn’t my best nap, but it still did the trick,” I reply as I grab my drink. “My neck feels a little stiff, if I’m being honest.” I take a sip from the straw, and Steve’s lips glanced down before they glanced back up to my eyes.
With a deep breath, Steve held the phone tightly in both hands. “This sort of reminds me of some twisted New Year’s.”
“Happy Birthday, Captain,” Natasha said with one of her small smiles. “I didn’t know what to expect when Tony told us he was planning this.”
He wasn’t expecting that to happen, not really. Sure, he knew Loki would spill some things regarding the loop, but he didn’t think Loki would take it that far.
Rhodey only shrugged as he stayed in the same place. “I heard you and Steve were going on a mission together soon without any service and only with each other. Just thought I’d stop by.” He was smug and it pissed me off.
“What if this goes on for weeks? How would I even handle that?” Steve rubbed his hands over his face. “The same thing over and over… I’ll go insane. The serum can’t stop that.”
A flash of disappointment crossed Tony’s face before it left, and he chuckled as he stood. “Don’t take it too seriously, Cap. Though I am flattered to see
Steve let out a breathy laugh. “I’m not one to act. And I could be asking you to act more in shape like me,” He lightly jabbed back to his friend.
No one bothered to stop him. They were either afraid to step in the line of Steve’s fury, or they understood he needed this.
Steve looked down at Tony and his hands. “Tony, I swear to God if you’re messing with me after everything I just told you—”
“Jesus, Steve. You’re like a block,” Tony groaned tiredly. He glanced at the clock before he sat up more. “You’re anxious, huh?”
Steve settled on an icepack on his forehead as he laid on the couch in Tony’s suite. He had the news on a low volume, so it wouldn’t wake Tony. Though he couldn’t take any pain medicine for a headache, he knew Tony can and would need it too.
He pondered on the question for a moment as he sipped his coffee. “Like, time travel?” Tony raised an eyebrow. He was trying to keep himself from cracking any jokes. Steve had his guard up, and Tony had to take him seriously.
Even if Steve couldn’t manage on his own with the “just friends” situation going on between Tony and him, he could easily calm himself for a while by working out. Especially with the punching bags. They were bought in bulk ever since Steve moved into the tower.
The two sat down on the couch together, and Tony pulled one leg up on the couch as he turned sideways to look at Steve. He, on the other hand, was looking down and fiddling his hands together.
“I know there’s five of you,” Steve called out as he stepped over the motionless bodies. “I know you’re here!” Steve’s voice rose as his fury seeped out.
It started with the two each slowly pining for each other – for something more than just the physical intimacy. It’s because of that the two caught themselves in the midst of a relationship more than sex.
“I just wanted to inform you that Fury wants us to leave around five in the morning for the drive there.” Steve went to continue, but of course I had to interrupt. It’s my specialty at this point.
“Steve, hey,” I greet when I pass him in the store, thrusting the keys out to him. “She’s all filled up. You can go wait in the car. I just need to empty my tank.”
Tony gladly obliged as Steve pulled him up by the hands. “What can I say? You and a bed are my favorite combo.” He winked with his devilish grin.
“Well, I had to see what my pal Captain America was hiding from me,” Tony retorted with that snappy tone of his. “Is this a new pastime or something? Or are you hiding something from me?”
It was just getting frustratingly annoying. The three weeks since the Beach Thursday ended, Steve put all of his remaining energy into trying to find his way out. But nothing came up or appeared to be an answer. Nothing. Nada. Zip.
Steve jolted upright in his bed with a gasp. He looked around in a panic before his hands went to under his chin where he was shot. Nothing. There was nothing there to provide evidence that it happened. Though he had a pounding headache from the remaining ache.
Tony sat back as Steve ate, checking some notifications on his phone. “I wanted to let you eat in peace, but Fury told me that they talked to Loki – with Thor there, of course – and he said he wanted to, well, ‘break you to break up the team’. His words.” He looked over to Steve before setting the phone aside. “Something about you being the heart and soul of the team. Which, as our leader, I agree.”
A warm hand brushed over Steve’s upper back and he couldn’t help but jump at the unexpected contact. He turned to Tony, who had a grin on his face and his hand rested on Steve’s back.
“Gladly,” Steve murmured with a relaxed smile. He gently cupped the back of Tony’s neck then kissed him again.
Steve kept his arms around Tony, desperate to hold on for as long as he could. “It’s a long story. I’m just glad you're alive,” Steve replied with heavy relief as multiple emotions flashed over his face.
Steve followed where Tony had flown to. It was just a mile or so down from where he had been, but there weren’t any families or couples around since you had to walk along the shoreline to get to that point.
“Is that a compliment I hear from you?” Amused Tony, who then was shot with one of the alien styled weapons.
Steve, on the other hand, had a tad more trouble getting those wide shoulders of his into the car. By the time he settled himself in and buckled up, I was staring amused and watching the show.
?” He asked in disbelief before his eyes snap over to Steve, and they widen impossibly more. “And you’re
Natasha smiled before she patted Steve’s shoulder. “It’s called Twitter, and that sounds like a good place to start.”
Tony grunted in response. In this conversation, it can be roughly translated to a ‘yes.’ He poured his coffee into a mug before he made his way towards Steve. Tony took a seat on the other couch as he took his first sip.
“I’ll probably do the same,” Steve somewhat decided as he set one of his bags down on the bed closest to the window.
Natasha slapped a magazine down on the counter where both Steve and Tony could see it. “We want answers, Rogers. We want all the answers.”
“Pick whichever bed you want,” I offer as I set the bags down on a table in the room. “I’m going piss and brush my teeth before I crash.”
Steve glanced over to Tony before sighing. “Yeah. It is. The mission is the exact same as what happened in the dream.” He paused and resisted the urge to shift uncomfortably. “Am I going crazy? Has the serum done something to my mind?”
“I’m just rather curious,” Steve shrugged and smiled in Tony’s direction. “And I’m not going to try to pry it out of you or Rhodey, so don’t worry about that.”
It felt like he woke up immediately after he fell asleep, and it was another Thursday. Steve grabbed his alarm clock – that was back on his night stand – and he chunked it across the room in anger.
Steve’s expression softened as he listened to Tony before sipping his coffee. “You were talking about that person you have your eyes set on earlier, and I’m quite curious about who could have taken away Tony Stark’s breath.”
“Just take a deep breath, Cap,” Tony tried to soothe, keeping his hands on Steve’s hands as Tony scooted even closer.
“Alright. Alright, fine,” Steve sighed and roughly rubbed his hands over his face tiredly. He didn’t want to talk about it anymore. It was over with. He just wanted to forget it and wake up to Friday.
Tony sighed, obviously not pleased with it, but he still took a moment to examine his arm. “I mean, considering that I just had a heavy punching bag punched at me by a super soldier, not bad,” He chuckled. “No damage. It’ll probably just be a bruise and a lot of soreness. No worries, okay? Now, back to you.” Tony crossed his arms and eyed Steve skeptically, though Steve didn’t miss the slight wince from Tony.
Steve nodded to himself as Tony countered him. He tried to prepare himself ahead of time for any possible counterargument that Tony could have. “I didn’t agree with them, Tony. We’d be like…an army if we had signed over the Avengers. The whole point of us was to be better than what any government could offer since we have better capabilities.
“Tony are you okay?” Steve repeated, more concerned about Tony’s wellbeing than what Tony thought about the numerous destroyed punching bags. “I’ll explain if you focus on you first.” Bargaining was really the only way to get Tony to care after himself.
“It’s best to leave it alone for now, Tony. At least until we figure out how we want to handle this ourselves,” Steve cautioned as he set slices of bread in the toaster for the two.
The guy blushed from embarrassment before he typed it in, handing my debit card back along with the card key to the room. “You’ll be billed for it in the morning after you check-out at the desk, so we can put it in the system. Your room number will be 128 on the first floor.”
“Yes, we are,” I declare as I pick up some of my other, more lighter bags that held various other objects. Clothes were in one bag and, well, the other bags were filled with equally important things for the mission. Different Iron Man suits being part of it. “Would you be a dear and grab that suitcase for me? It’s my last bag.”
“Thank you, Captain. Now I need to go talk to our little ‘friend’ if you don’t mind. We’ll check in tomorrow with you, okay?” Fury stood up and patted Steve’s shoulder on his way out. “Try and get some rest.”
Steve reflected Tony’s smile, it being contagious. “It’s just a little hobby I had before that helped me feel like this,” He waved his hand in the air. “Is normal. And that I didn’t get pushed into a new century that I don’t understand.”
Steve leaned into the gentle touch, making sure he kept his gaze focused on Tony. “Honestly? I have no idea.”
“Not long…” Steve trailed off. “It’s been, what? Three months?” He replied sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his neck.
In the month following their one-night stand, things had not gotten awkward for Steve and Tony. In fact, the opposite happened. They were more in tune with each other during fights and just with each other in general.
“Really? I—Why?” Steve asked with a quizzical look before he glanced into the bedroom, his cheeks getting that shade of pink again.
Music blared out from speakers set all around their section of the park. It was a warm night, and there were fireworks in the distance that the guests were able to see.
“I don’t think it was truly necessary for you to make that comment though,” Steve scolded lowly as we neared the room. “But it was also inappropriate for him to be doing what he was when he’s supposed to be working.”
“Hm?” Steve lifted the icepack to see Tony and smiled slightly. “Good morning to you too,” He mused as his eyes darted down to Tony’s unclothed body.
“Because you have an old soul?” I guess with a grin, and Steve only shook his head with a small smile.
Steve kept his hands clasped in front of himself despite the urge to comfort Tony and to hug his old friend. That moment was far from happening.
Tony went to say something, but Steve wasn’t done. If he didn’t get it out now, he wouldn’t want to continue the conversation.
Tony stopped to turn to Steve dramatically – which pretty much summed up Tony. Even in the middle of a fight he can’t help his sass. “
He stopped a few feet in front of me, his arms crossed. Oh great. I don’t think he’s going to be on my side.
“I would kill to have an eidetic memory like you,” I fantasize before I chuckle. “Not literally, of course. But it would definitely be useful for when I tinker.”
Bruce looked between Rhodey and Tony. “I wouldn’t go as far as to say he’s avoiding us, but Tony, you have been blowing off the team more.”
“Are you sure this is the right address?” Tony raised an eyebrow to Steve before he put his sunglasses on.
“Whatever you say, sir,” Jarvis responded to me, and I didn’t miss the smugness of his voice. I couldn’t have just made a normal AI. I just
“Why are you so worried about me just going on a ride? Granted, I’m far away, but you didn’t know that. There wasn’t a reason for you to be worried.” Steve crossed his arms and stopped a few feet away from the suit.
“You are only reasonable when you need to be,” Tony laughed lightly. “Which is the best way to be reasonable, if I do say so,” He added with a cheeky grin. He was finally starting to relax, but it wouldn’t last for long.
“Yes, you did, babe. You really did,” Steve laughed as he held up the bubble bath bottle that Tony dropped. Steve held it upside down to show that all the bubble bath had been dumped into the water by now. “We’ll have quite the mess in the morning to clean up.”
Tony glanced around at the people who could care less before he leaned in and whispered, “What do you say to gettin’ out of here?”
Tony grunted and grumbled to himself as he headed towards the door. What could FRIDAY possibly want to hide from Tony? FRIDAY usually doesn’t hide things, unless it’s something harmless involving Peter.
Tony flung the door open with a tired scowl. “Steve, what the fu—” He couldn’t finish what he was saying because Steve practically tackled Tony into a bone-crushing hug that he desperately needed.
He fell to the floor in a heap. Tony let out a heavy breath before he retched himself from the wall. “Ow,” He pouted like a child.
I can never understand that man. It seemed like we were finally on the same level and even agreeing with each other for once, but then he pulls that shit.
Captain America all flustered over the idea of being with me.” He winked over in Steve’s direction before picking up his shirt.
“Meet me there in five. I’ll tell Jarvis to let you up.” Tony winked to Steve before he sauntered off.
“Look, it’s still pretty early in the day. Maybe the rest of the day will go differently than your dream,” Tony attempted to comfort when he saw Steve getting frustrated. “Sometimes – I mean, it’s rare – but dreams can be pretty accurate.”
The bitterness was back in Tony’s words. Steve couldn’t take it. He was the reason it was there in the first place.
Steve nodded in response to Tony before he leaned back in the chair. “Having Bucky back was, for me, like having back a part of me that I thought was gone. I wasn’t the same when I came out of the ice. I was different. But Bucky, he was my friend. He helped me remember who I used to be.”
“It’s really about the dry and wet sand. You can’t use all dry sand, so you need the wet sand for more stability…” Tony continued to ramble on the logistics behind building The Perfect Stark Castle.
Fury looked them two over once they sat. “This one should be simple enough for the two of you together. On this mission, that is,” And there was the joke. “There’s a small group down in Queens that have been on our radar for a while, and we finally have a definite time and location for them. We don’t know if they’re HYDRA or not, but they’re currently dealing off alien styled weapons. Your mission is to put an end to it, but we need at least one alive. Understood?”
The alarm went off, and Steve opened his eyes to reveal his bedroom that he hadn’t walked into the night before. He could still feel the warmth from Tony’s body on his.
Steve sipped at his coffee as did Tony. “I sent Bucky to King T’Challa for care. They’ve helped him. He can’t be mind-controlled anymore. He’s not a threat, and Bucky Barnes never was.”
Tony loved it too. So, Steve kept it there on the tip of his tongue for the occasions where he was getting close with Tony.
“I know you’re enjoying the view, but do you wanna join instead?” Steve teasingly asked with a cocky grin. He dropped the rest of his clothes before he grabbed Tony’s tie, using it to gently tug Tony closer. “You’d make the birthday boy really happy.”
Steve couldn’t help but take in Tony’s appearance as he sipped his coffee. Luckily the steam from the coffee could excuse the blush he felt on his cheeks. “Good morning, Tony,” Steve greeted warmly and with a smile. “Coffee?”
“No,” Steve raised an eyebrow to Tony before he started to walk away. “I left the scene and came straight here.” Once said, Steve was glad his back to Tony because he was certain his cheeks were turning a shade of red.
– it was seldom anything different. Steve kept the same routine everyday unless plans were made, or a mission popped up and demanded his presence.
“Sorry,” Tony winced before he stilled his hand, keeping it rested on Steve’s back for comfort. “I’m just trying to think of all of it, but it in a different way than what I would normally so I can hopefully have new possible solutions for you.”
When I wake up, the car wasn’t moving. Aren’t we supposed to be moving? Steve was driving last I remember. Oh god, what if he isn’t driving anymore because we got in a crash while I was asleep?
Tony chuckled as he stood from his chair then made his way over to Steve. “Let’s hope the rest goes the same.” He stopped in front of Steve with a grin. “Are you ready for this?”
“Right. Sorry. I just got lost in thought,” I wave off before I look back at the menu. “I’ll probably get the double cheeseburger as is.”
“Look, Cap, I don’t want you to expect much from this,” Tony interrupted before much else could be said. “We were both drunk. Technically I was drunk, but you were
“The food usually is good. Especially when high or drunk, but we don’t have to get into that right now,” I chuckle before I pick up the front and back menu.
Steve’s smirk turned into a grin as he listened. “Your floor?” He suggested once he was able to look at Tony again.
That’s just…disrespectful,” I gasp as I pull my own burger closer to me. “How could you do that to the poor burger?”
The pair had finally confronted the relationship that grew secretly between them, and they fully embraced it. At least, only with each other. It felt nice for them to have something to themselves. They were content with their situation at the moment.
The toast was gone by the time Steve reached the gym, and he went straight to the locker room. He pulled on his hand wraps before he walked over to his punching bag.
He quietly and cautiously made his way down the stairs. Talking could be heard from the same room as every Thursday, even if it was earlier in the day. They must do most of their business from there.
Steve took a seat and crossed his arms, bracing himself for what he expected to come next. “Just tell us what we have to do.”
Steve laughed and nodded in agreement. “Oh, I am completely on board with that, Tony.” He stood up and stretched. “I’ll go grab my clothes and get out of your hair,” He yawned as he walked back into the bedroom. “I need to nurse this headache of mine.”
“Stark? Are you in here?” He asked hesitantly since I was still hidden away in my room, though I could see him from the doorway. I should probably go out there.
This kiss was different. It was deeper, and held more meaning in it, that Steve couldn’t help but pull Tony closer. It was enough for Steve to finally feel grounded, to finally feel like he had control of everything again.
Tony’s jaw tightened, and his posture straightened. FRIDAY definitely needed to be recalibrated. She was there when everything went down.
Tony rolled his eyes before he grabbed the microphone with a smile. “You’re our star guest, literally,” He chuckled. “It was only right.”
He would be back again, of course. Thursday would come again, and it would be like it didn’t happen. Because it didn’t really, did it?
It was hard though. This couldn’t be a dream. Why would he dream about the same day three days in a row? Especially when most things stayed the same.
“Jealous, Cap? Trying to size up the competition?” Tony quipped with a smirk. “Obviously I’m not going to tell you. Though the only person that knows is Rhodey, and he isn’t in town currently. Plus, he wouldn’t tell anyways.”
The door opened without any anger, but instead sleepy surprise. “Steve? You need something?” He leaned his hip against the edge of the door as he held it open, and Steve resisted the urge to draw the adorable Tony closer.
The captain almost smiled at that. It was a start for them; a new beginning, perhaps. At least, that was the hopeful thinking. “Remember, you know how to reach me.” Steve tapped on the flip phone he had attached to his belt before he finally walked out.
I pick up a stray screw to throw at Rhodey, but he was already dashing up the stairs to escape it. He knew me too well.
Steve grunted in response as he looked out the window, his face clouded over from thinking. I only shake my head before I drive back out to the road. Only thirty-two or so hours left, not including stops.
Steve’s brows pulled together as he followed me into the bedroom. “Couldn’t you take some out and put those clothes into a separate bag?”
The waiter stops over and grabs the check, walking away as he looked down at it to see his tip. He freezes for a moment before he turns to our table with his mouth hanging open, and I was already watching with a grin.
“If you say so, sir,” Jarvis complied. Lucky for me, he was mostly on my side. I say mostly because he does tend to side on the opposers side if it’s Pepper or Rhodey.
Steve nodded. “Yeah, we didn’t want to tell the team, and everyone be happy or annoyed or whatever they’ll feel, then us cut things off after if it didn’t work out. We wanted to avoid a potential public and awkward breakup. That way it could just stay between us.”
“Now I’m glad I got sleep last night,” Tony admitted with a small chuckle. “Because with a mission, I’ll need it.”
Steve sighed and didn’t even bother to reach for his phone again. It would just be useless. “They were to bring in more money for the army during the war. It was the only way they let me get close to the fight after the serum.”
I rub my hands over my face before I stomp back over to my suitcase. Now I had to pack extra clothes for the extra three days of travel time. As if I didn’t already have a shit load packed.
Tony sat up and stretched out his back with a happy groan as he felt how much looser it was now. Though he snapped his attention to Steve. “Leaving? You don’t want to see what else those hands can do?” His voice was suggestive and was accompanied by a smirk.
Tony glanced over at the clock before he turned back to Steve with a smile. “Alright, I have a plan then. You’ll spend the night here and we’ll watch movies you need to catch up on while we wait for Friday to come. You know, so then we’re killing two birds with one stone.”
So, Steve drove for hours. He stopped occasionally for gas, for a stretch, or for some food if he got hungry. All was paid in cash. It wasn’t unusual for Steve to use cash, though. He had grown up without the use or knowledge of credit or debit cards, and it felt odd for him to use one.
“Why would I kid about this?” Steve exclaimed before he grabbed Tony’s hand and led him into the living room. “See it for yourself.”
The elevator doors opened with a ping before Tony walked out and held up the bag. “Did a supersoldier order cheeseburgers?” He grinned and made his way back over to his living room. “Hot and ready to eat.”
The guy with the broken nose fired the gun at Steve, but it didn’t hit him like a normal gun would with a bullet. Instead, his ears started ringing painfully and was caught off guard. One of the men quickly took the chance and tackled Steve to the ground, and the others helped to hold him down.
Tony held Steve close, smiling softly before he pressed a kiss to Steve’s temple. “Well, now that it’s Friday and you love Friday’s a lot more than Thursdays, what do you say about making us official and going out to dinner? A real date an everything at a nice restaurant. And the next day can be the beach.” He looked down and grinned to Steve. “It’ll be our last first date.”
Tony waved a dismissive hand in the air. “We weren’t worried about that. It was more about being ready to let everyone know when we felt we were, well, certain about the relationship.”
Steve pulled out his phone and looked up pictures of him when in a battle. “Oh, come on—This isn’t even bad,” He argued back lightly. “So, I’ve gotten more muscular, and it fills in more. It’s nothing compared to the first
“Ton…y,” Steve caught himself before he slipped up again. “Of course we’re friends, and of course we’ve gotten closer. I just—” He pressed his lips into a line. “I couldn’t come to you with this. Just accept that.”
Steve hadn’t even thought about trying to mess up the time schedule of the day. He thought about it for a moment before he gave Tony a nod. “Let’s suit up then.”
“Yes, sir. Surprisingly, he’s been in there all night. The first time in weeks, sir,” He responded in his formal tone. Anyone can hear the utter surprise in the tone, and Steve couldn’t help the way his lips curved up in a smile.
“Precisely,” Steve agreed easily. “Bruce—We can say he’s off working on something important and top secret. Then Thor’s not even on Earth.”
Steve laughed lightly as our waiter came over. “The guys in the army never mentioned it, but you never know.”
At first Steve didn’t think it was a good idea for him to move into Tony’s tower. The two, well, they didn’t butt heads very well. Though Tony had offered all the other Avenger’s a place in the tower and he couldn’t very well exclude Steve.
Tony took that as a cue to grin. “Maybe you’re the genius after all, Cap.” He walked passed Steve on the way to the living room, patting his shoulder gently. “J, order four large pepperoni and black olive pizzas. You know from where.”
“There’s five of them. By this time, they’re probably still huddled around each other in the dining room discussing drop-offs and deliveries. You know, chatter of that matter.” Steve stared hard out the window, his hands clutched tightly on his knees. He was trying hard to contain all of his anger, all of his rage, all of his heartache. If he was right – and he had a hopeful feeling he was – then he would no longer be waking up on Thursday, April 24. It would finally be the Friday he’s been longing for.
Steve relished in the feeling of Tony holding onto him. He glanced at the cars around them before he sped up, weaving in and out of the cars and the lanes.
He grinned and finally passed over the microphone then proceeded to hop off the table to let all focus turn to Steve.
“Huh.” I think about what Steve said, walking through the door and over to the counter. “I like that quote.”
Steve shook his head with a smile before he finished off his coffee in one sip. “Well, I’m going down to the gym. You’re welcome to join.” He started to walk backwards to the door as he gave Tony his own teasing smirk, knowing Tony wasn’t one for a workout. Especially up to Captain America standards.
Steve slowly turned around, so he could face them with a stony expression on his face. “You bastards!” He roared before he lunged at the one who had shot the gun at Tony.
It hadn’t taken long. Since Thor was drinking, his laughter was booming more than usual. Steve stepped over and Thor’s grin widened.
Fortunately for both Steve and Tony, it was only a couple more minutes until midnight. Steve had tensed up with each passing second, and Tony felt all of it against Steve’s side that he was curled in to.
Steve let out a soft, relieved breath. “You never seize to amaze me.” He told Tony softly before he took a gentle hold of Tony’s hand to guide the two to sit down.
Steve laughed a bit as he buttered his toast. “It’s not my fault I’m not a fan of the damn thing. Technology isn’t my friend.” He purposefully dodged the conversation about the two having the tower practically to themselves.
“It’s settled then!” Tony declared with a smile. “First, we should confront the rest of the team. I’ll treat everyone to lunch.”
Tony got comfortable in Steve’s embrace, one arm wrapped around Steve and his other hand combing through Steve’s hair in a comforting manner. “Why don’t you tell me the good parts of the loop?” He suggested softly, wanting to draw Steve away from that dark conversation.
“I was wondering if you wanted to go get breakfast? I, uhm, don’t exactly know where a diner is though,” Steve admitted with a little shrug. “And I’m sorry for waking you.”
Steve glanced behind the man before he sighed impatiently. “You’re annoying me,” He stated blatantly with an expressionless face. He pursed his lips together before, in a quick motion that even caught Tony off-guard, Steve snatched the gun out of the man’s hands while simultaneously doing his signature power kick, effectively sending the man flying back.
“Sounds convincing to me,” I reply before I look down to my notepad. “The guy will probably need the library’s computers for research or parts. He might even have his own internet, but we can start there first,” I suggest with a shrug as I read over my crazy notes.
Yeah, I know. I’m not exactly welcoming to the guy, but that’s who I am. The other team members get that, so why can’t he?
“Since we were hiding this, we couldn’t very well show our affection in front of everyone, and it would be suspicious if we started spending a lot more time with each other when we normally work separately,” Steve added for more reasoning.
It was weird. Steve and I were bantering with each other and not arguing for once. Maybe it really was because we were on a “vacation” and we were loosening up. Either way, I’m not really complaining. I would rather get along with the guy just like everyone else than to bicker over everything.
Steve kissed back without any hesitation, melting into the familiar feel of kissing Tony. With his fingers still gently holding Tony’s chin, Steve moved his other hand to rest on Tony’s hip.
Steve got up first that morning. He felt it would be more awkward to stay in the bed, but he knew that he had to stay to talk about this. It wasn’t something that could be avoided.
I shake my head then turn my attention back to what I was playing with. “If you came down here to talk about that, you know I won’t.”
Steve sighed and set his drink in the cup holder. “You need a break from driving, Tony. Just for a little while,” He tried to reason.
He just went at it, punching and kicking any body that came his way. He founded his knife at one point and used it to stab one of the dealers in the neck.
“So, you mentioned that on both the Thursday’s before, you and I were assigned the same mission on each day?” Tony asked to start a conversation back up. He moved closer to Steve and started to hook up some wires to him.
Tony walked to the counter and poured himself a cup of coffee. “Do you have some secret prophetic powers from the serum?” He mused before he turned around and flashed Steve a grin.
Tony’s eyes did wandering of their own though. Steve felt the gaze on him as if it could be physically felt.
“Tough crowd?” Tony started the car and looked over to Steve, who simply gave him a look that must have said
“I don’t, actually.” Steve crossed his arms again and looked back up to Tony with a stoney face, trying to hide any emotions that tried to surface. “I came here to be alone, Tony. If I wanted to talk, I would have went to you instead.”
He left his workshop - more like stormed out of it - when he couldn’t clear his mind enough to work. That was around 9:00pm.
“Because it’s to me,” He defended before he melted in Steve’s touch. He couldn’t help it. “Just get that ass in the bath. I’m coming.”
A party was hosted at Stark Towers for their investors and business partners. This, of course, included all the Avengers.
Tony folded his arms over his chest and looked up to Steve, though he still wasn’t looking Steve in the eyes. “Do elaborate then. I want to know if I should get us some coffee or if I need to call my armor. Either is perfectly fine with me.”
“We were good friends,” Steve nodded then let out a chuckle. “Or he was just really fascinated with what he helped create.”
“Don’t look at me like that,” Tony groaned before he put a hand over Steve’s face to block the pout. “We’re not going to get into the science of it and the
Steve, on the other hand, had serious wind-blown hair. He kicked the stand down before he stood off the bike.
“Anyways,” Steve spoke to get back on track. He wasn’t much for the small talk with me. “It’s very possible that he could be copying after your work and would easily recognize you, so I thought we could disguise the trip as one to get away from the superhero lives. Like a vacation without internet and normal contact.”
He broke off mid-sentence and stood up abruptly, causing Tony to startle up as well. “Did you just have some sort of breakthrough or remember you left an oven on or something?” He arched an eyebrow.
Tony rolled his eyes before he cut Steve off by kissing him. He didn’t kiss back at first – completely taken by surprise – before he kissed Tony back with all the love he could muster.
“My type?” Steve’s eyebrows raised. He wasn’t expecting that question, but he saw it as an opening. A smirk formed on Steve’s face as he took note of Tony’s step closer. “Usually shorter than me, witty, and somehow makes being an asshole sexy.” The last part was mostly a poke at Tony’s attitude at times, and luckily Tony caught that.
Rhodey held his hands up defensively before he started to back up. “Alright. You win,” He sighs, but I could feel there was more under his words. “You go and have a romantic getaway with Captain America.”
“No, Steve,” Tony held his hand up to stop Steve from continuing, pinching the bridge of his nose with his other hand. “You said I was your anchor, right? Then what did Loki mean when he said you were willing to take your own life?” Tony didn’t want to know the answer to this, not really, but he felt he had to. He wanted to know if he heard wrong. He wanted to know that his Steve didn’t do that.
Sam snorted. “Maybe in a dream. But not in real life, man.” Steve looked back to Sam before he sighed, letting it go.
Steve took his seat in front of my desk, and he even had his own little journal it seemed. “You did say two, remember, Stark?” He replied with a raised eyebrow.
Tony picked up his fork and took a bite of his eggs. “Fine. You two want answers? We’ll give them. So, stop getting your panties in a twist, Rhodey Bear.”
“It would be a lot less, well, weird if so. How can I dream of something so accurate and so real though?” Steve asked with an edge to his tone. It was beginning to get frustrating for him.
Steve flashed Tony one last smile before he turned around as he took another bite of his toast. Even if Tony didn’t feel anything, and nothing would ever happen between them, Steve could manage his crush if they continued as best friends.
The suit was sitting on the shore leaned back with one leg resting on top of the other – a very Tony pose. Though he wasn’t out of the suit yet.
Steve slumped onto his bed once done with his shower. He was exhausted, and the hot shower helped his muscles relax him. He crawled under the blankets before he closed his eyes and let sleep take over.
They came at a later time so most of the dealers were gone, and the ones that were there were taking a nap or not paying attention to their surroundings. Steve heard where one of them were and he motioned in that direction to let Tony know to be cautious of that area.
I turn around expecting to argue over the matter, but instead I see the amusement on Steve’s face. So, he was
Steve sat there and listened – really listened – to Tony. It was mesmerizing, the way Tony spoke so passionately. Steve could listen to Tony speak all day. When Tony was done explaining everything, Steve leaned over and kissed Tony sweetly and innocently. God—Steve was falling hard.
If Tony hadn’t of already been interested in Steve before, he certainly was now. Not only was he being complimented higher than his father, but this was a compliment on physical appearance from Steve. Was he into guys?
Steve rolled his eyes before he stepped out of the car. “I did what I had to. It was either stay in a lab and be tested by your father and other scientists, or tour around America until I reach the army across the ocean.”
The door closed, and Tony led the two of them over to the kitchen. “I need coffee first,” He grumbled as he started a pot of coffee. Tony glanced over to Steve before he motioned towards the living room. “Make yourself a home. I’ll bring the coffee.”
Steve’s face fell as he realized how his words sounded against me. Well, I’m assuming he realized his mistake. “Wait—”
“Wait, you seriously don’t know?” Tony asked with a chuckle. “Cap, why do you think you’re one of America’s most wanted bachelor? Or America’s teen heartthrob? It’s not just because of you saving the world for everyone.”
Steve looked over to Tony and smiled. “We can post about it on that social media platform you were talking about. What was it called? Tweeter?”
Steve stood abruptly and looked around. He was in his room. Before he could even get a full breath of air, he was bounding down the hall and down the stairs to Tony’s suit.
“Well I didn’t want you to be alone!” Tony argued back before his demeanor began to soften from his tense figure. He ran his fingers through his hair. “You worried me, okay? Normally you would have told me. And now you’re acting weird. Whatever it is you’re going through or whatever is happening, I thought I may be able to help.”
He stared up at the off-white marbled ceiling as he gave Tony time to dissect everything that Steve revealed. His spiked coffee was long gone as he fiddled with the empty mug. Waiting for Tony to speak was silent agony and suspense.
Steve arched an eyebrow as he watched me. “I read online – on the internet – that the waiter tends to hand the check to the one who think is more dominant,” He chuckled. “Like an alpha male situation.”
Tony leaned up and stole a quick kiss before they had to pull away. “Most definitely, Cap. I will make sure no one disturbs us.”
This Steve had a beard, and he didn’t look all that put together. As in, he doesn’t look like he’s had a decent shower in days. His uniform was dirty as can be. And yes,
Tony and Steve nodded in unison, and they were filled in with the rest of the details. Once filed into the quinjet, the two sat across from each other fully suited up.
When Steve saw Sam collapse in exhaustion at the same tree, he slowed to a stop along with Sam. “Nothing like another sunny day for a run, huh?” He breathed out.
I dragged myself out of bed, trudged over to the coffee machine, and just got relaxed on the couch with my coffee when Jarvis decided to speak up. Not much relaxing when I have him reminding me to do stuff all the time.
Tony grabbed his phone, handing it to Steve so he could count down the seconds. “I’d do anything for you, Cap.” He gave Steve a small, hopeful smile.
“Then let’s get going then, Cap. My car is still outside.” Tony squeezed Steve’s hand comfortingly before he pulled them away from the debriefing room.
“Had a good workout, I see,” Tony chuckled as he saw Steve’s appearance, though his nose crinkled up. “And smell.”
Steve shook his head. “Tony, you didn’t have to. And you would have been safe and this wouldn’t be happening—”
“Baby…” The term of endearment slipped off Tony’s tongue like it was made to be there. He squeezed Steve’s hands gently, not knowing if Steve wanted him closer or not. “You didn’t let me down…and not only because I don’t remember it,” Tony let go of Steve’s hands and cupped his face gently. “But because you still tried. Steve, I know you. You’re Captain America, and you’re also my best friend. The person I love. Who I can’t even possibly compare to because, come on, it’s me we’re talking about here.”
“Hey, Cap,” Tony greeted with a warm smile as he sat upright on the bed. Shirtless. Though to Steve’s luck – while at the same time being unlucky for more than one reason – there was a bandage wrapped around Tony’s torso where he had been injured at.
“Yes,” I answer with a nod, pushing a button on the key remote to open the trunk. “That way they feel more obliged to give us a room.”
“Don’t,” Tony snapped and glared down at his coffee. “You know it wasn’t really about the accords. You used that as an excuse since you already hadn’t agreed with them. You couldn’t-You couldn’t just sign the damn papers.”
“Yes,” Steve spoke quietly. “Every other Thursday you just got injured. But I guess trying to go alone means either I will die, or you will.”
“Stop being so damn perfect.” Tony was joking, of course. He didn’t want Steve to stop doing anything he was doing. Which is why Tony kissed Steve again, and this time his passion was directed into kissing rather than talking.
“I do hang out there when I can. But I keep myself busy,” Steve attempted to justify, but that just put another thought in my mind.
Steve just ignored it and stripped of his clothes before he collapsed onto Tony’s bed. He curled under the blankets and hugged Tony’s pillow to his chest. He was
Steve looked over to me for a moment before he looked ahead. “As ready as I’ll ever be,” He mumbled in response, and I can’t be too sure if I was meant to hear that.
“You and Bucky – Sergeant Barnes – were pretty close, huh?” Tony asked with caution. He recognized the tone Steve was talking in, and he heard stories from his dad about the couple.
“It’s my turn for the radio,” I tell him as I change whatever station he had it on. Honestly, I zoned it out miles ago. Though if I’m recalling it right, it was some sports game. And yes, I might be being petty, but he snapped at me out of nowhere. So, yeah.
It was better for Steve to stay underground anyways. He was still classified as a wanted criminal, but only under the table. The government didn’t want the world to freak out over Captain America’s arrest warrant. The government still wanted to profit off Captain America merchandise.
“It started as a one night stand,” Tony let in as he finished his meal. “We were both drunk and it, well, happened.”
Before Steve could punch the guy nearest to him, there was a blast at the back of the building. Everyone turned to examine what just happened. Steve felt dread and fear build up inside his chest and stomach.
Bruce fiddled with the sleeve of his coat, giving it a small tug. “I’m sure he’ll be fine. Now, if you don’t mind, I need to get started with Clint’s chores.”
Every day he’d open his eyes to the same weather, the same alarm, the same clouds, the same mission, the same news, the same Tony, the same Thursday. It’s officially been three months, and Steve didn’t know what else he could do.
It wasn’t too long after when Tony came out dressed and looking sharp. “I’m ready with an empty stomach and a need for my morning coffee. Let’s get going, Cap.” Tony grinned to Steve before he passed the other man on the way to the door.
Tony remained silent as he resisted the urge to look over, and Steve knew Tony didn’t believe tomorrow would be Friday.
“You don’t have to say thank you. I’ll get Pepper to request a debit card from you from my account. Just as long as you aren’t a gold digger who’s just here for my money.” Tony shot Steve a wink before he took another bite. “J? Can you send an email to Pepper?”
Tony went to make another snarky comment, but Steve’s slumped shoulders and worn look stopped him. Steve was tense, but it wasn’t his normal
“Then he’ll do that. What he does isn’t my business, and I don’t think it’s yours either,” I point out and gives Steve a look. “Besides, it’s not a lot of money to me. What’s the point of having this much money if I’m not going to spend it or make good use of it?”
Steve’s eyes were now fully on Tony, wanting to pull him close and never let go. Not for any reason. “I was never truly alone,” His voice was low and soft, so Tony had to strain to hear it. “I always had you. Tony, you were like my anchor. If I didn’t have you, I would not be sane at the moment. And I certainly would not have figured it out on my own.”
“Perfect,” Steve murmured softly before he captured Tony’s lips in a longer lasting kiss. With his enhanced hearing, he could hear someone approaching quicker than Tony could, so he didn’t worry as much.
Tony let out a breath of relief once at the destination, though a little way away to not draw too much attention to themselves. He wanted to solve this to help Steve.
He re-stretched his muscles as the coffee machine heated up before he poured himself a cup. Tony trudged his way out of the elevator with his sweatpants hung low on his hips and his hair a mess of curls and waves.
“Either way, thank you for this, Stark.” Steve’s voice was sincere and dipped in affection, and this time it was Tony’s turn to resist the urge to grab Steve by the shirt and kiss him senseless.
Tony grinned at that before he gave a shrug. “The party last night was more for Steve as a surprise party than for the Fourth of July. We kissed in the car before we got out to meet everyone else.”
Steve grinned again before he loosened up Tony’s tie. “You do it to me. How is this any different, sweetheart?” He quirked a brow up at Tony.
I can’t get too mad at him. Him and Pepper are the sole reason this company is still afloat after all these years without Obadiah. I much prefer those two anyways.
Steve settled with sitting on the couch in Tony’s living area to watch some tv. Though Steve has watched some tv since he’s been in the loop, he switched the channel to a show he hasn’t gotten around to watching yet. The tv guide doesn’t change in the loop either.
“Sort of?” Steve looked over to Tony. “Really all I do is ask J what songs you played, and I’ll look them up.”
Steve huffed slightly, knowing how smug Tony was getting. “No, it wasn’t…” He glanced to Tony then cleared his throat. “Another good part of the loop is one day we went to the beach. Well, I had, in a way, ran away? I hoped getting out of state would help so I stopped in Virginia at a beach. You ended up finding me, of course. So, you stayed with me, and you didn’t make me tell you what was wrong. We just…spent a day at the beach. Together.”
He didn’t hold his punches back this time, wanting to feel the seams give way under his punches. Though JARVIS’ voice rang from the intercom.
Steve relaxed at that. Tony always believed him. “Two weeks now,” He sighed tiredly before he rubbed a hand over his face. “Nothing I do or nothing you suggests works.”
“I love you,” Tony suddenly stated with a stronger voice, though it had to have been just about all of his remaining strength. “Okay? I-It’s bad timing, but true.”
There was silence. Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah. Uhm,” He cleared his throat. “Last minute love revelation
Steve stepped off the elevator and into Tony’s suite. He put his hands in his pockets as he looked around. It was bigger than the other floors for the Avengers, but it was also messier.
“Yeah, most likely,” He finally said as he held a hand out for Sam. “Come on, let’s go get our smoothies. I remembered my wallet.” Steve grinned.
Steve stared down at his lap. He was terribly aware that Tony had been looking at him that whole time. He still didn’t want to talk about it or about anything related to it. But he wanted to be by Tony, and he couldn’t have both.
Once he finished his breakfast, Steve pulled on some clothes he can ride with before he tugged on his leather jacket. He had to leave the tower. How had that idea not entered his mind before? Probably because it felt like running away, but he felt that’s all he could do at a time like this.
Tony bounced those words around his mind as he chewed his food. “You do know you live with me, right? The Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist! You don’t have to worry about not having money. You’re a teammate
It wouldn’t stop no matter what Steve did to shake things up or even try to pretend that it was over. He felt like he was breaking. He had to at least be going insane.
My younger self would be thrilled over this, but this also isn’t the same Steve that I grew up as a kid thinking about. He definitely isn’t the same Steve that my father bragged about.
Steve paused for a moment as he looked over to Tony, who was also taking a moment to think about the proposed question. “I’m certain,” He finally spoke up, and a smile gradually formed on Steve’s face. “I’ve been wanting to tell the team for the past week or so, because I’m certain that I want to be with Tony.”
Tony nodded, though he didn’t fully understand since he doesn’t remember. Steve watched Tony before he let out a sigh.
“Perfect,” Tony breathed out as he let himself collapse on the bed. “G’night, Steve,” He mumbled as he already began to fall asleep.
There was nothing else for Steve to try. Nothing. He wasn’t meant to discover the secret doorway out. He was meant to be stuck in this forever.
“Oh god—You’re brilliant,” Steve breathed out in utter relief. “Tony, we need to get to the address Fury sent you.
“I don’t get to forget it. Which in this moment I am more than thankful for,” Steve assured and gently squeezed Tony’s hand. “And when this is over, I’m going to bring you back here and tell you all of this again, plus every single Thursday that I’ve been through.”
Doors began to open both in the upstairs of the building and down the hall he was in. Steve braced a hand on the wall to help himself stand again. Footsteps neared, and he braced himself in a fighting stance. He had dropped his knife and no longer had his shield with him – it was too far to attract to the magnets on his forearm.
“Since as Captain America I tend to be the one people respect more, I’ll go around and see what the locals have to say.”
Steve huffed before he pulled Tony closer and kissed him deeply, slipping his other arm around Tony’s waist to not leave any space between them. It was filled with all of Steve’s emotions that had been blocked from over spilling during their breakfast together, or any Thursday that Steve tried to keep his distance.
Steve suddenly stopped what he was doing. He looked up to where the elevator doors were and listened carefully before he breathed out a curse. “Someone’s one their way up in the elevator. It has to either be Pepper or Rhodey,” Steve warned as he set the toast and butter knife down.
I give it some thought then shrugs. “My best guess? He’ll either be cunningly handsome yet psychotic and manipulative, or he’ll be one of those crazy scientists with equally crazy white hair.”
“How come he handed the check to you and not to me?” I question a little offended then reaches over and grabs it. “Do they not know who I am?”
The two got caught in each other’s gazes for a brief moment before Tony spoke once more. “Happy Birthday, Steve.”
Steve took wide steps over, so he was by Tony’s side quicker. He braced his hand on the suit before he pulled it apart enough for Tony, who stepped out as soon as he could.
Rhodey was the one who finally came after me when others began to realize I was still in my workshop. I could probably use his advice anyways.
Steve nodded a little then handed the keys to me. “Alright. I’ll order then get the drinks while you get condiments, napkins, and a table?” He suggested.
“Think? I know I’m funny,” Steve countered with a chuckle before he handed his water bottle to Sam. “Here, you need it more than me. Accompanied with a shower but that water is for you to drink.”
“And what’s with you nicknaming me?” Tony stepped closer into Steve’s space, his grasp gentle and soft. “Steve, you’ve just been through something that…that I can’t even imagine going through. And I’ve been through a lot. Can’t you talk to me about it?”
Natasha sighed lightly. “You two are idiots. We would have respected either decision you made and this whole thing with us would have been avoided. Though to be fair, it would probably still be the same with the public unless you made a public announcement about it at some point.”
Steve shrugged and had what appeared to be a bashful look on his face. “When I came out the ice, Fury had S.H.I.E.L.D. send over videos and articles on you and the others so I can familiarize myself. One of the videos was the one of you telling the press you wouldn’t sell weapons anymore, and I remember seeing you with a Burger King burger. I figured you liked the place,” He revealed with the bashful look growing more present on his face.
“Hm.” Tony closed his eyes again. “Why would my injury be the only thing different? It seemed to affect everything after it too.”
Once back at the tower, Steve made his way up to the common floor where he could take a break with some coffee before he headed down to the gym.
“What?” Steve raised an eyebrow, playing casual and friendly. You know, not like he knew more than Tony thought he did in this moment. “The Genius Billionaire
“I mean what I said,” Steve spoke with a more accustomed speed this time, though his voice lacked his normal confidence. “I don’t want to freak you out, I don’t, but it…happened. No matter if I told you of the loop or not. We always just came together.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “Actually, if I’m trying to be honest here, mostly I came onto you.”
Tony let out a heavy breath. His muscles relaxed. He hadn’t realized how tense he was during that. He rubbed his hands over his face before he rested his elbows on the table. With his face covered in his hands, he couldn’t help but to chuckle.
“Mr. Rogers, you are requested at S.H.I.E.L.D headquarters with Mr. Stark immediately. A mission is waiting.”
Tony sat at the table as well, never saying anything, and never taking his eyes off of Steve, until he had to put in his input about the events that just happened.
This time Steve was the one to roll his eyes. “Come on. The nurse said you can leave.” Steve stood up and held a hand out to help Tony.
Steve’s lips turned up into a smile as they slid into one of Tony’s cars. “At least I don’t have to worry about weight gain,” He joked lightly before he smiled to Tony.
But as Tony poured himself yet another glass of whiskey, he couldn’t help his wandering eyes from going back to the inferior phone.
“It just tumbled out,” Tony sighed before he shrugged. “It wouldn’t surprise me if he already knew. Rhodey knows me better than I know myself.”
Steve chuckled as he walked over. “I came to check up on you. Do you know what time it is?” He raised a questioning eyebrow to Tony, who in return shrugged it off.
The fight was coming to him, and he had to be prepared. Though, Steve wasn’t prepared for what happened next.
Steve didn’t know what to do about it, let alone what to think about it. They could very well be casual flirts. Though he couldn’t help but wonder if they weren’t.
Steve snatched the file before Tony could and looked through it. It was the same file from his dream and not a single detail was different. “Right. Got it.” He pursed his lips together before he pushed out of his chair. “I’m going suit up. Meet you at the quinjet,” He told Tony before Steve practically stalked out of the room.
Loki was making the loop harder too. They days would sometimes randomly change to the next Thursday without warning, and Steve would feel more sleep deprived than he already had. He finally understood how Tony felt after those long nights – or
It was odd for Tony not to have come out of the suit yet, or even to not have popped open the face plate.
“Whatever you want, Cap,” Tony stated with a sweet smile as he pulled on a suit jacket over a t-shirt.
Steve favored The Incredibles and the Back to The Future trilogy – for obvious reasons. Tony stayed at Steve’s side, though he was struggling to fight against sleep. He did stay awake though, he was just no longer paying attention to the movie and instead paying attention to staying awake.
Steve grabbed the trash before he walked into the kitchen and threw it away in the trashcan. “Do you want anything to drink?” He looked back over to Tony.
“You’re welcome,” He chuckled before he looked up at the menu, crossing his arms over his chest as he looked through his options.
Tony had his eyes closed at this point, and he smiled lightly as he listened to Steve. “It was no problem, Cap. I knew you’d like it even if you wouldn’t at first,” He shrugged off.
“So, you mentioned that I tried cooking for us? What for?” Tony asked curiously, though not in a pushy manner. His voice was gentle, not wanting to cause Steve to tense up and close off.
Tony laughed before he waved his hand in the air between them, dismissing Steve’s apology. “I know all about that. When the Avengers first got called together, and even before that, I read reports on you from before and after. And I had a good laugh on the half-hearted complaints about your food consumption.”
There was no progress. And worst of all, Steve started to realize something as he focused more on every little detail from everyone around him.
“You—” Steve bit down on his lip before he got on his knees on the bed. “Fuck me,” He breathed out, not being able to form a complete sentence.
Tony looked over to Steve before he focused on Fury. “Aliens? Hydra? Weapons? Robots? What are we dealing with here?”
Tony pressed the now closed phone to his forehead, right between his eyebrows, as he tried to take a deep breath.
Steve halted in his confusion. “Tony, did you not read that part of the file?” His right eyebrow quirked up as he stared down at me, and it was my turn for my cheeks to turn pink.
His thoughts paused before an idea popped in. He couldn’t be in the tower. So, he’d just have to go away from the tower.
“I have to get going, but keep me updated, okay?” Sam gave Steve a concerned look as he held his hand out.
“Most likely,” Steve agreed with a soft chuckle. “And lately I’ve been known for having a higher chance of getting you into bed.” His words were innocent, but the smirk that tugged on Steve’s lips begged to differ.
“I figured around eight or nine we should stop somewhere for breakfast, be it drive-thru or dining in,” I share with Steve as we head down to the garage. “And then again around noon or one for lunch. For dinner we’d stop around six, maybe seven, and then drive until ten.”
” The news anchor questioned as the picture remained in the top corner of the screen. “So far we have no further insight on the apparent relationship between the two superheroes. We will…”
Steve laughed softly and finally looked down to his boyfriend and away from his book, a twinkle in his eye. “Oh, I’m not complaining.”
Steve held open the door for Tony once they reached the lobby. “Not that I’m against walking, but why is that your go-to and not a taxi?”
The difference of this particular moment was what Steve saw as he turned on the morning news. A very clear picture of Tony and Steve kissing in the car the night before had been taken and spread around just about everywhere.
I caught the sleepy smile on Steve’s face before he closed the bathroom door behind himself, and I let that image settle with me as I quickly drifted off as soon as my eyes were closed.
Tony pulled his knees up, resting his glass on his knee. It felt like a twenty-pound weight was resting in his other hand, but it was just the old, vintage flip phone that Steve had given him.
– then he may not get with Tony. Steve would be damaged and scarred after, and he shouldn’t put that on Tony.
Steve abandoned the book all together, setting it on the coffee table in front of them. “As much as I don’t want to ask this question, do we have anything planned that we’ll need to plan around for ourselves?”
Steve let out a breathy laugh. “Oh, because Tony Stark knows all about stealth when during missions he’ll blast 80’s rock music out of his suit.”
“None of this takes away what you did. Not even just you,” Tony’s jaw clenched as he gripped his mug tightly. “You teamed up against me and
Tony grabbed both of Steve’s hands. “Don’t tell me you…” He couldn’t finish off his sentence, the words left in his throat and were unreachable.
“You enjoy that disgrace then, while I bask in the deliciousness of my cheeseburger.” I shake my head then takes a bite from my normal cheeseburger.
Tony watched Steve for a few moments before he started to eat his own burger. He was worried about Steve and how he had been acting today. “I still can’t get over how much you can eat in one sitting,” He said instead of bringing up the dream Steve apparently had.
Steve hunched over and closed his eyes as he focused on the feeling of the evening wind pushing against his body. He couldn’t take it much longer, and he knew that. There was no way out.
Once Rhodey left, Steve fully turned to face Tony. “That could not have been more awkward,” He mused with a playful smile.
Tony stared at Steve as he tried to analyze the supersoldier. “Is this about that dream you had?” Tony pondered as he leaned his elbows on his knees.
“J is offline,” Tony strained as he tried to take the suit off manually. “I could-could use a little help, Cap.”
“And this didn’t happen either. Once I helped you get back here, I made sure you had everything before leaving.” Steve lips formed a line before he looked down and went back to the massage.
Tony shook his head and paused a moment before he moved to walk closer to Steve, their shoulders and arms now brushing against each other along every step they took. “No, you won’t, Cap. What I do for you doesn’t put a dent in my bank accounts nor is it anything out of my way.”
,” I groan as I shut my door. My legs felt funny being stretched out for the first time in a good few hours.
That Tony didn’t quite understand. It took a lot for someone to get such an exhausted look in their eyes. Tony knew that first hand. So, why did Steve have that look after just a day’s difference?
“I know,” Steve replied softly, resting his own hand over Tony’s. “Whether this works or not, I want to thank you, Tony. I’ll at least have a clue for next Thursday because of you if this isn’t over.”
Steve looked for an opening before he threw his shield at one of the weapons – destroying it – then punched the guy in the face. He fell down, and Steve fought with another before he was on the ground next to the other guy.
