And poor Peter. Steve had tried so hard to connect with him recently—he’d caught the quiet sighs that escaped Peter’s lips when they set out for some artistic venture. He’d thought it was just the teenager-y thing where they pretended to be annoyed by their parents. But he supposed Peter would never act that way with Tony.
Steve scowled, anger boiling beneath his skin. “I don’t get why you even came back here. It’s embarrassing enough to live here while you’re living with other people.”
“Paparazzi caught you both leaving Stark Tower last night, and every major tabloid publication has a variation of the image on their front cover. Online news media outlets have been reporting on it all morning, and major political channels have been discussing the implications of your new relationship.”
Mary Jane had only ever been kind to him—and he knew she really did care for him—but he supposed Bucky was right. She had never gone out of her way to make him feel as important as she seemed to think he was. She was an empty promise. That made her something that was not a friendly.
See, Steve had always overlooked one thing that was always present: that perfectly tuned, pulsing monster in his chest that gave him fresh blood, fresh life, fresh poison. It kept him young when he was supposed to be decaying, and yes, maybe it should have occurred to him that those perks weren’t just physical. He could hurt just as long as he could defy aging. He could inflict self-torture far beyond what any normal human being could ever take.
Peter shook his head with a little eye roll and murmured something to Mary Jane, who laughed. “Dad,” Peter said, “Just sit down. Appetizers are already over.”
Blaine glared at him before leaning down to cut the thread with his teeth. After a painful tug on Steve’s arm, he sat up again. “If there hadn’t been that hole in the fence, I would have thought you were up there trying to get yourself hurt.”
“Well I’d prefer for Jackson not to have to pretend to like my cooking,” Steve finally replied. “And I’d prefer to have the both of you able to eat it.”
He forced himself to lean in further until his forehead rested against Tony’s warm skin, until he could feel Tony’s breath on his lips, too hot and thick.
Steve wanted to warn him, but could never find the heart. It was too late to do anything about it anyway. And Emory would have him.
But he didn’t like the way the penthouse was evolving without Steve there. Morgan’s toys started to pile up in odd corners, and he was usually too tired to pick them up when he was stumbling to bed. She was a bright little thing, and sometimes liked to show him just how bright she was by hiding toys in places she wasn’t supposed to be in the first place.
Despite what he had once thought, Steve didn’t age. What he had thought were the signs of a slower aging process had actually turned out to be the effects of a combination of stress and mental weakness. Every day in the mirror he saw the same face staring back, a body far too young for all of the time he carried on his spine.
That foul, disgusting word. Divorce said that both separated parties were too selfish and too ignorant to face their own problems. It didn’t say that one husband had never been around or ever bothered to think his missing consecutive dinners and soccer games was wrong. It didn’t say that the very thought of trying to fix things was so unfathomable that Steve couldn’t even stand to focus on it for more than a fleeting second.
Bucky slipped off his rucksack and sat on the chair opposite Steve. “This ain’t gonna go the way it did back in the old days,” Bucky said, opening the main pocket of his rucksack. He pulled out a long, metal briefcase and set it on the table. With two clicks of the latches it popped open, revealing folded pieces and attachments of a sniper rifle.
“God, Tony, I don’t know,” Steve said quietly. “My heart hurts and my head hurts and the more I look at you the more I get this terrible feeling that it’s all gonna end.”
Even Bucky had made a comment about him smiling more. Bucky, who would sooner put a bullet through Tony’s skull then talk to him on the phone. When Bucky had heard about the wedding, he had pulled Steve into a hug and Steve had just stared at the wall, unable to feel anything at all. The invitation only upset him because it reminded him that life didn’t care what he was doing, it pushed on without him.
Fortunately, they weren’t in any real survival mode. The Quinjet was equipped with enough food for months, enough medical supplies to patch up a small army, and they were armed to the teeth if their enemies had somehow tracked their embarrassing fall. The only thing they didn’t have was fire (enemies could spot that from a far distance), but they had sleeping bags, a tent, and plenty of blankets.
The question echoed in Steve’s head as he sat there, staring at the floor. Peter thought he was absorbed in a fictional world. Steve didn’t even know what that meant. If anything, it had just been that he couldn’t handle city life anymore. Plenty of people were like that. Plenty of people were—
Steve smirked into the pillow. He couldn’t combat that one and he knew it. “Fine,” he mumbled, reaching over to smooth his hand over Tony’s thigh. It felt too intimate, but Steve tried his luck anyway. They weren’t going to get anywhere if they avoided everything that felt like it used to.
They gravitated toward each other, breath mixing as they sought out their familiar places. Tony looked up into those warm eyes and smiled, his chest swelling with affection.
Steve glared at him before heading to the elevator. He pressed the button to retrieve it and faced Not-Tony again, uncertain. Bucky trusted this man, so Steve had to be able trust him for one night. With weapons at the ready, just in case.
Steve grabbed a piece without hesitation, relishing in the fact that he had an order to follow. He popped the mystery food into his mouth and tasted some sort of batter, something cheesy, and some kind of seafood. It was delicious.
Steve made sure he was equipped with everything he had brought: grenades, mute charges, ammo, and that the flashlight on his MK14 assault rifle was working properly. A smile nearly came to his face when the red light inside the cabin caught on the emblem painted on the side of his rifle reading “On Your Left” underneath a white star with three stripes on either side.
“Could you?” he choked out—definitely not close to crying or anything. That would be stupid, and he wasn’t that.
Not-Tony snorted softly. “Okay, yes, those lamps are from 1945. They cost me a lot of money, too. From a cafe in Austria, the one you visited with Bucky Barnes and all of your buddies after Monte Cassino.”
Most people just thought it was about the diamonds, and the Russian and American governments wanted it to stay that way. Knowledge of the mission was on a need-to-know basis, and Emory could not have been left alone for Steve to leave for a funeral.
He realized that might seem to forward—too eager—the moment he pressed send. Too late now, he supposed.
Vison’s brow furrowed when Wanda laughed at that, and she shook her head. She reached over to the side table to pour herself another glass of wine. Her third, if he was remembering correctly. And he always remembered correctly.
Steve was reeling now. That couldn’t be the mystery woman. That woman—what was her goddamned name?—had been cold with Tony, formal. Lawyer-like even in a private meeting. But then again, Steve wouldn’t be all that kind to the man in a pretend relationship with the man he loved.
Tony regained his bearings and hated himself for saying that, even if he did think it was the truth. At least he hadn’t said what he was really thinking:
Bucky’s eyes followed Steve as he left the room and headed behind him to the kitchen.  As soon as Steve was out of sight, Bucky let out a quiet breath, lifting his hands to rub his temples. Steve going away had made all of this worse. Now that he was back, Bucky was going on about goddamn cough syrup.
The boys got to talking, so Steve checked to make sure dinner was still going to be done on time, participating in conversation only when it was asked of him.
The world was still spinning a bit, but not bad enough that he didn’t know what was going on. “Tony, why are you up?”
“And he’s also an adult. Don’t cut’m slack because he’s your kid. He isn’t stupid,” Bucky said. “I know Tony’s wedding wasn’t good for you. This ain’t gonna be any better.”
“Okay,” Tony finally said, stepping away from the threshold to give Steve room to leave. “I guess I’ll just…wait to hear from you then?”
It was hard to believe that his fairytale had gone so grim. Love was supposed to save everything, to be the tether to keep them both from straying too far.
Steve didn’t want him to remember. “Tony, let’s just get you home and we can pretend nothing happened.”
When something stirred beside him, Steve nearly jumped from the bed. Grey light from the window filtered down onto his bed, and a tuft of ink-black hair stuck from the sheets.
“Sounds great,” Tony said flatly. “But you can’t make it awkward. You hesitate for one second and it could throw everything off. Everyone’s watching you like a hawk, because you’re the good and honorable one.”
He felt Tony hesitate, but then heard the sleeping bag rustle as Tony sat up, completely moving off of him. Steve frowned.
Steve looked up again, this time scanning for any signs that this guy was duping him. But Ben’s body language was honest—a little tense, a little excited. Not a guy who seemed to have any clue who he was talking to.
“We should clean up,” Steve said, moving his hand over Tony’s to still him. “You need to get some rest. And I need to check on what the Avengers are doing.”
He’d waited until Natasha couldn’t stand to see him standing there any longer. Until he had to give up hope.
“No, Tony,” Steve shook his head.  “That’s what changed my mind. When you first told me you adopted a kid I was terrified. Honestly, I didn’t think you were ready for a child and I didn’t want to be part of it more than I already had been. I know that’s why you set all of this up in the first place.”
“Negative on that one, Rogers,” Cueball replied. “The trees are too thick, I can’t see anything within ten feet of the fence line.”
Steve nodded, and Tony grabbed his glasses off his face, tossing them to a workstation with a clatter. There. That was the Steve he knew.
Rhodey and Pepper were checking people in before they were being sent past the picket fence and off to the beach where Jackson and Tony were greeting everyone. Steve couldn’t really see any of that, but news travelled fast down the line.
Tony sat up completely, shaking his head so that the sand fell from his hair. It half worked. He still looked good, as always. Steve hated that his brain still made those mental notes.
Steve licked his lips before re-forcing his smile. Trying to look like he wasn’t on the verge of breaking down at the table and making an absolute fool of himself.
“It’s not, and we’re over. I just regret how it happened.” The one-two punch. The breakup, then the betrayal in Siberia. Steve couldn’t recover from that and he knew it. He really didn’t blame Tony for that part of things: he wasn’t sure he’d be able to forgive if the tables were turned.
“I’m sorry it has to happen this way, but I’m not sorry that we’re doing this,” Tony murmured. He straightened, nodded to Rhodey, and hurried out of the lab, looking close to tears.
Well, at least Rhodey wasn’t dead, though Steve wasn’t too keen on trusting him if he was going along with this.
Another crack of thunder caused Peter to flinch and Steve instinctively tensed to defend him from harm.
Tony didn’t care about him anymore. Tony didn’t ever think about him the way he used to. Tony had erased the past five years like nothing. Easy. No pain, no discomfort—the only unbearable part of it all was Steve. Stupid, sensitive Steve. The one who couldn’t leave it be, the one who had to keep wanting closure when the answer was just no.
“I can always buy another one if it gets ruined,” he murmured. A sly grin spread on his face and he tossed the robe to the side. It slid off the bed in a pool of shining crimson.
Tony grinned, making his way over with an uneven gait. He didn’t so much as kiss Steve when he walked by. No, that was reserved for someone else now, Steve suspected.
Steve looked away from Peter and his smile fell at once. “I don’t need ‘help,’ Tony,” he hissed quietly. “If you just wouldn’t have run up here to make a spectacle out of this, then everyone would be perfectly fine right now.”
He pushed past Pepper and got in line, cutting in front of most of the people waiting. Murmurs rippled through the crowd that weren’t friendly, but Steve hardly cared.
Tony turned to face him again, unsure. “Um. Yeah. Yes.” He sighed, closing his eyes. “Sorry, Steve.”
“Woah, woah.” Tony rubbed Steve’s arms, concerned. “Baby, slow down. Tell me what’s going on—what happened to you? Did someone hurt you?”
“I don’t just fight aliens and brutes,” Steve muttered, snatching Blaine’s towel and stuffing it under his nose to stop the bleeding.
“You’re always part of this family,” Tony said, but he wasn’t sure he believed that anymore. Steve was off somewhere else. He never checked in. He never called or asked why he hadn’t seen Peter. It was like he didn’t even want to be part of the family anymore.
Or he’d been thrown forward in time somehow. Those were the only two possibilities he could think of. It certainly felt similar to when he’d woken up from his icy slumber all those years ago, so his gut told him that he’d travelled to the future, somehow.
He lunged, and Steve brought up an arm to block the tackle. Blaine’s free arm hooked around his back, but his leg moved at the same time, ramming into Steve’s knee.
“Hey, I’m just telling you what I’m doing to knock you on your face,” Blaine said with a shrug, smiling. “That said, if I was fighting you for the first time—even if I knew you were Cap—I wouldn’t fight like I did in there. You’d kill me in five seconds.”
Steve felt no itch. Steve felt growing fear in his heart. It was too late to leave, too early to panic. They had miles to go before they hit land.
Steve burst through the glass doors into the tower lobby, not bothering with the hideaway entrance. He darted into the elevator, punching in his access code as fast as he could manage. This had to be right—it had to be. But he would only be able to tell once he saw Tony.
Steve pulled the trigger and watched stone-faced as the man’s head burst with a crack that might have been sickening for some.
And he had to admit the more nightmareish scenarios were starting to look more and more like reality.
Blaine shook his head. “Pearson found you with both your arms wrapped up in razor wire. Like you were trying to pull it down with your bare hands. That means something is seriously wrong here.”
“Mm, sure,” Tony replied, looking over the menu. “But add a pump of caramel. I’m feeling rebellious.”
A part of him wanted to call Steve right now, to try to inflict maybe a sliver of the pain Bucky had caused him. But something uncomfortable welled in his chest at the thought, and he told himself it was just because it would upset Steve.  Even on his worst day as a human being, Tony could never inflict that kind of pain, not knowingly.
As usual, they cut the line. Men grumbled behind them as they filled their plates far past the allowed amounts, but hey, today was mashed potatoes and gravy.
He settled back into the couch, resting shoulder to shoulder with Steve to watch the news. Bucky knew he had the best friend anyone could ask for, but he wanted more than that now. At least, he was pretty sure that was what this was. Friendship was fine and dandy, but not…complete. Somehow, it wasn’t complete.
Morgan laughed as he scooped her up, her shiny black shoes gleaming as she kicked wildly, shrieking with delight.
Steve only knew a few people at the table. Harry Osborne, Rhodey, Pepper, and Tony. Three women also sat at the table that Steve didn’t know. One was MJ’s age, so Steve assumed she was her maid of honor, and an older woman.
Tears didn’t come anymore when he thought about it. Those had gone away long, long ago. Back when it was raw. Back when there was what seemed like a permanent indent in his skin where that ring used to be.
Pearson stuck a disc to the door—the mute charge. The team flattened to the walls on either side of the door. Pearson gripped the charge remote. “Clear.”
Steve sighed. “You’re right, you’re right.” He supposed it wouldn’t be so bad. It had been quite a while since he’d had Tony sleeping beside him. Natasha was actually his most recent bed partner—they had shared a bed a lot while they were on the run.
Rhodey smiled. “Okay, so in the beginning when you guys were your new fancy team or whatever, I thought Banner was your guy. Steve was kinda out there, kinda clingy, but I figured that was the whole time travel thing.”
Steve wanted to say. Oh god, was that pathetic. “No, I don’t want a hug,” was what he actually came out of his mouth, and rather harshly at that.
“Uh.” Steve looked around, as though the gas fireplace would offer up some kind of answer in the flames. “I’m willing to do whatever you want to do.”
Pearson said he found him at the perimeter fence, but Steve had no memory of being there. Yet when he closed his eyes, he saw the coils of razor wire and felt the warmth spreading up his arms.  He also remembered an embrace, almost a spiritual experience.  He saw the problem too: a gap in the fence. A gap that needed fixed and secured before time was up, before the bomb exploded, before he was discovered.
Peter walked by him without so much as a glance and Steve found himself unprepared for the sting of being ignored.
Hurt welled in Steve’s chest. The divorce hadn’t caused this. He refused to believe that. Peter had adored him until…he didn’t know when it had stopped.
Steve nearly jumped out of his skin at the sound of someone entering the dining room, but more so because he recognized that voice as Tony Stark.
“I remember getting nervous before I asked you to go on stupid adventures,” Steve continued, chewing his bottom lip. “Like when I made up that stupid story about how there was that really fancy smoothie place four hours away and how Bucky bailed on going with me?”
“I just—Fuck, sorry,” Steve blurted out, his heartbeat still pounding in his ears. “You—Don’t do that without telling me first, Buck. I’m sorry.” He swallowed hard as Bucky let go of his forearms and he began looking Bucky over. “You’re okay, right? You’re okay?”
They passed through security, annoying Steve all the more as all of the officers standing there saluted him as he passed. Maria glanced at him with a questioning look in her eyes, but didn’t say anything.
Bucky opened his mouth to answer, but then Blaine and Sam appeared, drinks and baskets of appetizers in hand.
choice that he’s accepting. He won’t do that. He’ll feel like you forced his hand. Like you might not think he’s genuine.”
They had never repaired things. They hadn’t even tried. Steve visited Tony only once after Peter’s wedding, and that was just a few years ago to discuss a change to Tony’s will.
Steve’s hand lingered in the air for a minute, his eyes probing, but then he nodded once and drew his hand away.
His therapist said that Tony had no obligation to him, just as Steve had no obligation to Tony in his romantic life.
Steve swallowed. “No, I really think I should get going. I just wanted to congratulate you guys and wish you all the happiness in the world.” He gave Jackson a genuine smile. “If you ever need anything, I’m just a phone call away.” And a few states.
Tony and Jackson would love his present and he would probably be sitting with the Avengers or with Peter—though probably not Peter since he was best man, and only groomsman.  Jackson’s three sisters were the only bridesmaids, and they would probably be sitting at Tony and Jackson’s table for the reception.
This was a power move and he knew it. The penthouse was a place he never wanted to be in unless he had to be, and Tony knew it. When he did have to be there, Steve always stuck as close to the lobby as he could, just in case he had to turn tail and get out of there.
Because it was so much better than the alternative. He thought about telling Bucky, but he couldn’t. He couldn’t handle his friends sharing the same disgust for him as Peter did.
He was screaming, the pain radiating from all parts of his body. His head swung wildly, his chest collapsing as he endured the full effects of his injuries.
“Will I be able to contact you at all?” Tony asked, trying not to address it. He’d always operated on the stupid thought that avoiding the problem was the best way to deal with it.
Blaine put the syringe in a pouch and dropped it to the floor before crushing it beneath his boot. When he picked it up again, he placed it into his pack. His hand lingered inside for a moment. Steve turned his head to see what was causing him to hesitate.
Steve was glad that Tony had been out and about. Sometimes he stayed in the lab all day and never left--and those nights were usually full of night terrors. But things had really been getting better. Peter had been a huge help, even after the boost of Tony getting sober two years ago and Steve officially moving in after their marriage (he was old-fashioned, always would be).
Instead, he picked the glass pieces out of the frame, and carefully moved to his feet, wincing slightly where the piece of ceramic was still wedged there.
“Literally all of this is your fault,” Peter interrupted in a hiss. “You had so many chances to get over yourself and fix this, but you’re so fucking proud that you refused. You
“Yes,” Steve finally answered in an even tone. “If I had a chance to do it over, I wouldn’t change a thing.”
And being a single father didn’t involve as much alone time as he’d anticipated. Pepper was a constant presence in the house, though Tony was pretty sure that was because she was concerned about him getting lost in work and forgetting he had a little person to feed.
“Who says I don’t?” Bucky challenged, grabbing Steve’s spoon and leaning in. Chicken noodle. Typical Steve.
And then the humiliation in court as Tony glared at him while his lawyers shredded him in front of a room full of cameras, press, and civilians. The anguish of Peter saying he didn’t want to stay the summer. The hatred in Tony’s voice and in Peter’s.
“You wanna talk?” Tony asked, tugging at the collar of Steve’s shirt. Just lightly. “Let’s find a place to talk.”
“Pops, it’s not that.” Peter sighed, shaking his head. He looked exactly like Tony did when he was distressed. The last thing he wanted was for Peter to be distressed. “It’s just…it’s hassle if I live here, you know?”
Steve let him go, but Tony didn’t roll away. Instead he crawled closer, this time resting his head on Steve’s arm. Steve didn’t have to see his face to know Tony was thinking; there was a special kind of silence that came when Tony was deep in thought.
Steve swallowed hard and tried to relax. “Oh, jeeze, yeah. This is Blaine. We work together.” He looked at Blaine and motioned to Bucky and Sam. “Blaine, this is Bucky, and that’s Sam.”
They entered a massive room that looked like it had once been a garage. The ceilings were cavernous, the walls white with a sleek, glass finish.
Vision closed his eyes and focused. He could feel the same tug, the same confusion, the same hurt. Wanda touched his wrist and it intensified to a level that made him shift with discomfort.
Here was a man who had fought for good when he could barely fight at all. Steve had planned on the horrors of war, or at least thought he had, but he had never anticipated this. Almost eighty years after the fighting, still alive and not slowing down. It wasn’t fair and it wasn’t right. It wasn’t right that Steve was still suffering either—holing up by himself all the time, trying not to burden anyone.
The Ferrari purred to life once Tony got in, and it was the only sound as they pulled out of the driveway.
He moved to the threshold and Tony looked over at him, his eyes showing momentary…something. Regret maybe. Sadness. Hard to tell when he was so intoxicated.
“Okay, well this isn’t the Playboy calendar run, if that’s what you’re thinking.” Really, he wasn’t even sure he should be bringing this up. Talking about it with someone else made it a “thing.”
Steve nodded and grabbed the blond boy by the collar. The dog sneered up at him even after death until Steve grabbed it by the scruff of its neck and its jaws went slack.
“Yeah,” Steve said, smiling a little too wide. Peter wouldn’t come back. He didn’t want to be here anymore. A sad little apartment was no place for a boy with a future as bright as Peter Stark-Rogers’.
He never ever wanted to be this person.  Peter would probably hate him for the rest of his life for tearing them apart. And he was pretty sure he wasn’t going to be getting custody anyway, so these nights might very well be the last he ever spent with his little boy.
“Right,” Steve said, shuffling down the narrow little hallway into his tiny kitchen.  A smirk came to his lips. “Kiss goodbye?”
Steve stepped from the shower and grabbed a towel. “I’d do it, you know,” he said to the shower door. “This. Every day. If you’d just stop with it all.”
“The Accords, you mean,” Steve muttered. “Our ‘civil war’ between Avengers. Yeah. We got through that. Almost three years ago now. I just moved back to New York in the last year.”
Tony lowered projected the screen to cover the entirety of his vision and adjusted the volume—this time only to pick up Steve’s voice. He didn’t need Rhodey catching any weird looks on his face while he ran.
All he had were his dogs, Bucky, and Sam. Even Peter wasn’t really his friend anymore. Peter had missed Christmas to be with his girlfriend and hadn’t even remembered to tell him.
It wasn’t raining. That was about the only positive that Steve could find as he took a seat on one of the benches, watching as men filed into the boat from the ladder. The boys were anxious, the kind of nervous chatter that came with green troops. The new soldiers were easy to spot—they had bright eyes and smiles only half nervous. The weathered men stared at nothing, talking to each other without really talking.
So when a man sat down across from him at a build-your-own salad shop in Brooklyn, Steve prepared himself for yet another verbal lashing.
Peter snorted. “No. It’s that you had to keep making it worse after you filed for divorce. You had to make Dad miserable.”
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “Well, yeah. Steve is not gonna be like it was with Pepper. He’s like…Right out of Bye Bye Birdie or something. Going steady, no messing around on the sidelines, real relationship stuff.”
Tony stood after making a show of licking his lips, entering the shower as though nothing had happened. Because in his mind, it probably hadn’t.
It wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair, but Steve had done many things in his lifetime that weren’t right or fair to protect the people he loved. He would sacrifice everything without hesitation—not that his life was worth much.  Tearing down buildings, destroying D.C., loving Peter and Tony even though they wanted nothing to do with him—Steve welcomed sacrifice. Probably too much.
“Okay,” Steve said stupidly. What else could he say? Leaving would only make him seem like a drama queen. Staying meant living with the fact that he had done something bad to Tony’s wedding day.
It had been a beautiful home. All glass windows, perched on a private lake that was dotted with lily pads, some large enough that a dog could curl up on one if it wanted.
She really liked to hold onto his helmet while he went over notes, and if she didn’t have it in her hands she screamed until she did. It made his heart swell to see her love a hunk of metal so much, even if it terrified him to think about the next time he had to put it on.
“Thor zapped it a few times, just seems to piss it off more,” Iron Man grumbled, dodging a spray of poison. “I could use your help on civilian evacuation though. We’re trying to herd this thing toward water but I’m not so sure that’s a good idea.”
“What, did you think her parents had just decided not to show up?” Peter snapped. “That they had work conflicts, like you?”
The rooftop was silent as the hovercraft was expertly guided into place—far different from the days of noisy helicopters and reactor propulsion systems.
“You’re all right, Rogers,” Blaine said, and Steve felt the thuds of his near-silent footsteps as he approached.
Steve looked away, fighting the hurt. They hadn’t even started this and Steve already felt used. Tricked. Tony had none of the softness or desperation he’d had before.
The world around Steve froze. Not quickly, but in a creeping fashion, like frost curling on a windowpane, leaving Ben in a snowy vignette as he move in slow motion. Talking on the phone he’d said he didn’t have. Everyone always had their phone on them now.
Steve willed himself not to take that as a guised ‘I love you.’ Even if his brain was screaming that that was exactly what Tony meant.
Steve settled in under the covers, but his heart ached. Maybe he really had been insensitive with Tony. Two years had felt like plenty of time for Tony to come to terms with what had happened, but then again if Tony had known some kind of truth about how Bucky had died and withheld it…that wouldn’t be anything close to enough time. Enough time to get over the anger, sure, but not the pain.
Steve flinched, unable to meet Peter’s eye. He had always seen Tony as the one to act too dramatically, coming over to his apartment in the middle of the night, trying to call him to hear his voice again…not a man that low.
“I sent it to him,” Jackson said, sliding between Steve and Tony. “I didn’t think it was right not to—“
One Private started praying, clutching his rosary with shaking hands until the soldier behind him thumped him on the head and stuck out an egg sandwich.
“Someone must have said I was coming,” Steve muttered, fidgeting with the cuffs of his sleeves. It was endearing to watch a man so beautiful struggle with something as simple as clothing. It could also be incredibly frustrating in the right context.
Pepper didn’t say anything until they were at the final chair in the furthest corner of the seats. Back row. The place where someone sat to be forgotten about. Steve tried to smile.
Tony ducked and caught her around the waist as she went by, scooping her up. She kicked and struggled for a moment, then just giggled as he carried her into the elevator. She was a happier kid now, and every day Tony saw her coming to trust him just a little bit more. He hoped he never broke that trust.
Steve stood and they headed out the door. “Overwatch, are they using the entrance we came in? West side?”
“Hm.” Steve was quiet for a moment, and Tony tried to imagine where he was. At home, probably. Back in that shitty little apartment that barely had enough room for a bed. Tony could just see him all sleepy-faced, sheets haphazard on his mattress, shoes neatly tucked at the foot like a good little Army boy. He was probably eyeing that coffeemaker, trying to decide if he should just start his day or try to sleep.
He took a deep breath, and it didn’t shudder. There was no flaw, and it didn’t help the ache. His gaze turned to the stars, but there weren’t any. Just navy clouds, a few bits of sky that punctured them in patches too disorganized to focus on.
, he replied, and he meant it. Tony was the mastermind behind all of this, and the less he dictated, the better. He was doing his part to be Tony’s puppet, wasn’t that enough?
“I’m serious, Pops,” Peter said, his eyes welling up. “I don’t want you to think I don’t want to stay here anymore. Yeah, maybe I was mad at you, but you’re still my dad. I didn’t mean…You’re always going to be my dad, okay?”
It was funny how being stranded on an island wasn’t something they even remotely considered to be a problem for them right now. They both knew they would be rescued in a day or less. If they weren’t, Tony would find a way out. They both knew that if anything, Tony had the brains and Steve had equal muscle to back it up. They were in no danger here.
Tony didn’t like the implication that he wasn’t prepared for “real relationship stuff,” but he knew Rhodey didn’t mean anything by it. Rhodey knew his track record better than Pepper did, probably.
He laughed, a broken sound. “No, no. I just wanted to tell you that I made it through the wedding okay. It was really nice. The reception was ridiculous, just like I said it would be.” Bucky hadn’t mastered phone calls. This conversation would never happen in real life—Bucky would see straight through it. But the phone masked things. Steve picked at his thumb. “Some drunk guy started stripping on a tent pole. It’s not even six o’clock.”
“You asshole!”  Tony grimaced as he peeled the spitball from his cheek and hurled it at Steve’s face.
“Oh, really.” Tony let out a snort. “But meanwhile you’re teaching my daughter’s art class? Making nice with her? I’d call that being misled.”
“I know that’s weird,” Tony added hurriedly. “I know. But, um—the story about my Steve? I’ve only retold it once before, and Rhodey told everyone else so I didn’t have to. And I thought it’d be easier to tell you because you’re him, but…” He licked his lips, shaking his head. “I don’t think I’ll make it through.”
Steve nodded to his team and they began to set up their spots on the rooftop. Snipers found places to hide among the crumbling walls and debris while other men aimed down the stairwell, heartbeat sensors flipped up to detect enemy pulses.
Her “connections” were Peter and Stark Industries. Her threats were real. Her father was his son. Or used to be.
He swore he could feel heat from Tony’s cheeks as he flushed. “Well. I didn’t see you pulling away when I kissed you just now.”
“We made it through,” Tony said, looking up from his hands. “It was a rough patch, but we both moved past it. Things got better.”
Tony was staring up at him, brow furrowed. A moment later he propped himself up on an elbow. “What? She’s not—God, baby, no.” He cupped Steve face in his hand. “She’s not taking him. She’s not.”
“This’ll only work twelve hours on you, with the way you’ve been responding to meds lately. I only brought enough to get you through tonight, the rehearsal if you need it, and the wedding,” Blaine explained.
“Buck,” Steve groaned, rolling his eyes. “I’ll be fine. I just wanna catch up with you and Sam tonight. It’ll help me.”
Nuts. Nobody said ‘nuts’ anymore. Goddammit, Steve. Tony rolled his head to give Steve a look that said ‘nice one, old man.’
Bucky climbed up a ladder onto a wooden platform that served as a lookout post. A radio was clipped to his belt on one side, a pistol and two knives on the other. His right wrist sported a titanium cuff with an identification number, bar code, and SHIELD logo engraved in the metal.  On his back was a large rucksack, but he certainly didn’t notice the weight.
Steve snorted. “It’s my personal problems. They won’t affect the team. They haven’t ever affected it before and they won’t now.”
Steve glanced around the room once more to see if he might have forgotten anything, but his wallet and keys were tucked in his pockets, his phone in hand, and the key card to the hotel was waiting for them in the lobby.
“I haven’t changed my mind,” Tony said firmly. “But this isn’t extending to my personal life. This is essentially a business move.  It’s a PR stunt, nothing more. Maybe it helps our friendship, maybe it doesn’t.”
But Tony hadn’t met him at the tarmac. Natasha had to drive him back home, because his bike was at the tower. There were no new texts or voicemails on his burner phone when he reactivated it. He didn’t dare open up the internet, too afraid to see Tony with someone else.
“Mhmm. Finished a new suit this morning, and I’m cooking up another one to start on when I can think straight again.” He paused. “Mm, and Rhodey says hi. We went to lunch.”
But Tony had known then that Steve wouldn’t be able to handle being all alone. Tony had never wanted that for him. That was why he forced his lawyers to give Steve joint custody. Peter needed the father that would endlessly dote on him and teach him all of the family things Tony had never learned.
Steve adjusted his bag, knowing full well this was a terrible idea. But the welling of warmth in his heart was so perfect. He was happy now. Why should he not let himself be happy?
But as he rounded the front of the car, a shadow moved down the street. Tony had a good sense on gauging danger, and something in him snapped alert at the movement.
Bucky hadn’t even been invited, nor had Sam. The only people Steve would have to hang out with were the other Avengers, and he wasn’t even sure if they were coming. Thor probably wasn’t—he had only come to the last wedding because both grooms were his friends.
“I fell in love with you again before I left,” Steve admitted. “But I knew it was going to be different this time because I did this. I love the person you are now. The Tony who takes his daughter to art class and cares about her more than anything.”
“Steve,” Tony said his name carefully, watching the way Steve couldn’t stay still, the way his eyes were ringed pink and his pupils were dilated.
Tony gave Steve and apologetic smile before stepping in and putting his arms around Peter too. Tony didn’t close his eyes and Steve didn’t either, so they just looked at each other for a few moments from opposite sides of Peter’s head.
The door to his room opened and Emory stepped in, his black hair fraying out from under his hat, sticking to his pink cheeks. He lifted the gun off his back and hung it at the end of their bunk before pulling off his hat and shaking out his long hair.
“It’s not for another month, Dad,” Peter said, pulling away and brushing himself off in typical teenager fashion, quickly wiping his eyes. “I’ve still got two more times here with you before I go.”
“You fell asleep,” Steve said, walking into the living room with a bowl of soup. He offered the bowl to Bucky. “Want soup?”
His doctors and psychologists said he would never be fully recovered—whatever that was supposed to look like—but Bucky had argued enough that he didn’t have to go to therapy anymore. He hated therapy anyway; it always seemed meaningless and cheap. No doc knew what was going on upstairs, what he had dealt with. The only two people on the planet who had any idea were Steve and Natasha, and they had only fragments.
Tony didn’t connect him to BARF technology this time. He insisted that Steve still was going to be in the program, but it wasn’t going to be an active experience.
“So you’re siding with him,” Steve said gravely. He leaned back in his chair. “I don’t need to hear anything else. Just do whatever you’re going to do to me.”
But now he was alone and kidless, just the way Steve wanted him to be. Morgan was with Pepper, who had taken to her in a way he hadn’t really expected, but wasn’t opposed to in the slightest. Pepper was by no means Morgan’s mother, but she’d taken up quite the role in making sure she was always dressed nicely and—more importantly—a giggling mess of happy.
Steve shook his head, tears streaking down his face where it was hidden in the crook of his arm, his knees drawn up to his chest.
The phone rang a few times, but then someone picked up. They didn’t say hello, and there was a lot of barking in the background.
Bucky dusted his knees off as he stood. “Lookouts ain’t just gonna be lookin’ out. If we can see ‘em, they can see ‘em. And they ain’t gonna be goin’ home to mama if the enemy sees ‘em.”
Part of him didn’t even want to get married, just to avoid any similarities from that other dimension. Tony wanted a baby eventually, so Steve had insisted they adopt a girl. He didn’t know if he’d be able to stand having a son that might look or sound anything like Peter.
“She’s not going to be comfortable. It’s a fever, Tony.” Bruce let out a sigh. “Once she starts sweating—”
Tony turned to him after the car was in park. “I’m marrying him, Steve. And when I marry him, I’m staying married. No divorce this time. I’m married forever.”
He wanted to tell her never to have children. He wanted to tell her to sign a pre-nup no matter how much she thought she loved Peter Stark.
Steve snapped to look at him, eyes widening at the sight of Tony surrounded by blood bags. A mountain of them, bright crimson.  He jerked as he fought to look at his arms for any IV holes, though they probably would have healed over by now.
He looked…younger. His eyes had life in them Steve hadn’t seen since the Accords, his skin glowed, his small wrinkles looked smoothed out. This was not a man who looked unhappy, who looked like he had been pining after the man he’d dumped at the tarmac three months prior.
“It might help if you called him sometime, Steve,” Tony said. “Don’t act like this is Peter’s fault. You move to the east coast and you don’t even invite him up there to see you? He probably just feels like he isn’t welcome.”
At the end of the special, Tony flicked off the TV before the credits had started rolling. He hoped to God that wherever Steve was in the world, that he hadn’t seen that program. NBC said they weren’t going to air the segment about the engagement until they had confirmed that Steve knew about it. Not to mention they had cut out the part where Tony had spent about two minutes detailing what a fucking great father Steve had been.
“Maybe we should,” Tony said quietly. Steve turned to look at him, an odd weight in his chest. “Just for pretend. I mean, it might be more awkward not to.”
“Says the guy drinking champagne while I’m here sucking on sparkling grape juice,” Tony heard himself say in reply. It was strange to hear his own voice when his mouth wasn’t moving.
“Look at this place. Jersey’s a hellhole.” He gestured toward a balding man lumbering from his minivan and toward the door, three little girls flanking him, one with a firm grip on her sister’s hair.
“My special drawing,” she announced before tucking her face into his neck. Tony hoped he didn’t smell like Steve’s cologne, but he probably did.
Steve turned his face into Tony’s chest, shaking so hard he could hear his breaths shivering. No more were the days when his little Pete would giggle at him and ask to play baseball at the park. Maybe even in those days, Peter had been itching for somewhere else. Someone else.
“Apples,” Tony said, turning to look at his new husband. “Stop. It’s our day, yeah? Let Steve go if he wants to go. It’s not your fault he still hasn’t learned how to take a hint.”
It was always hard seeing the people he loved grow old. In Steve’s heart, they were always young, glowing with youth and brimming with happiness. When he thought of Tony, he still saw his wrinkle-eyed smile, his dark hair, his twinkling eyes. But that day Tony’s hair had been all grey, his eyes tired, and his smiles gone.
Tony turned to look at the setup of blood bags and tubing, and pressed something on a tablet beside him. Steve heard a hum, a few clicking noises, and then a rhythmic
He finished his final set and showered off in the locker room, his mind numbingly silent. Stupid. He was so damn stupid.
Tony wasn’t finished. “And once I’m married, I’m not doing this shit anymore. I’m not coming by to see you—no more surprise visits or Christmas cards with handwritten notes or calling you for advice or anything.”
He turned to see Blaine hunched over the body of the first soldier, cleaning his combat knife on the man’s jacket.
Once he’d dried off, said hi to T’Challa when he’d passed, Steve slung his gym bag over his shoulder and headed down the hall. The feeling he’d woken up with wasn’t gone, and the way his lungs burned only added to the tightness.
Tony didn’t look back as he headed down the staircase toward the dancefloor. Steve had had plenty of time to say corny Hallmark shit. Now wasn’t the time or place. Not when this party was supposed to be just a party, just an excuse get people back into the Tower and not see it as some Avengers mausoleum (and no, not to get Steve back to the Avengers mausoleum).
“West side is clear. Repeat: West side is clear,” Cueball said hurriedly. “Can’t say for how long though.”
Finally, Tony looked up from his tablet. “I invited you here to discuss how we’re announcing our fake togetherness. And to practice.”
Steve handed Tony the coffees in his hands without a word and stepped out of the car. Nikolai burst from the door as Jackson stepped out, looking a little worried.
The elevator doors opened at the penthouse. There was a crash in the bedroom, and Steve sprinted across the living room toward it.
There was a picture of Tony with a massive grin, clearly overwhelmed with joy. A chubby toddler was on his hip. Her hair was dark like Tony’s, with a cute haircut that ended just past her ears. She looked a little shocked at being photographed, with big puffy cheeks and dark eyes. She looked like she could be Tony’s biological daughter, but yet he somehow knew she wasn’t. Some familiarity about her was missing that he knew Tony’s biological child would carry.
Rhodey chuckled and took another sip of his drink. “Okay, so you like him. What’s the big deal? You gonna do anything about it?”
When Blaine removed his hand from his pack, there was a card between his fingers, perched there like a cigarette.
He almost said it, but he didn’t, because he wasn’t sure if he believed it. That wasn’t fair for someone who was already hiding things from Steve—what was one more possible lie?
Tony shook his head. “You said you needed space. Didn’t really think you needed that much, but we’ll get past it. I love you, and I know now that you never wanna do anything bad by me.” He swallowed. “Even if sometimes you do that the wrong way, I think we’ve both learned our lessons.”
“So,” Tony said, “I know nobody really pays attention to these speeches anyway, but, from Jackson and I, we wish you the best of luck in your future together. We love you both more than anything.” He raised his glass. “Cheers.”
Steve could feel his pulse thudding against Blaine’s fingers and the breath bouncing off of his arm.
Nikolai stood at the door, staring at Steve with the gaze that said he was aware of the tension. Steve smiled, even though he knew Nikolai was a dog and smiling didn’t change anything.
The nagging gold-digger with unreasonable expectations that the media loved to tear apart because he was a whole, untouched carcass fit for gorging on.
“Now Daddy and I just fight, but so did Grandpa and Grandma when I was your age. They yelled sometimes, like Daddy and me. But then …” Peter was asleep, so it was just practice, but it still hurt his heart to speak at all.
Steve looked up at him, unable to process what that meant. “Stay part of this family? What the hell are you talking about? What—so I can be your boyfriend during the work and you can have your lawyer powerhouse girlfriend on weekends? What the
“This isn’t my first leave, bud,” Blaine murmured before taking another swig of his drink. “You’re gonna be nervous the whole time.”
He couldn’t even revert back to his memories with Tony. Now it felt like trying to imagine making out with a cousin or something. It grossed him out just thinking about it, made his skin crawl.
He spooned up some soup at the same time that he caught scent of Steve’s aftershave. Bucky pretended to close his eyes because the soup was good. It wasn’t that good.
The air went still as both of them stared at each other, Peter breathing hard and Steve just…staring.
“Still don’t see why that’s a problem,” Tony said cautiously. Steve going on mission wasn’t exactly ideal, but they’d discussed this before. They would make it through and everything would be fine. Actually, it would be better than fine—it would give him time to put together the plans for adopting his kid without worrying about Steve stepping in on things.
“I think it’s time,” he said, his voice twinging with emotion. “He hasn’t responded to my texts all day, I think he’s out on a bender. I, uh, was just looking through the paperwork before you called.”
Tony didn’t respond, he just nuzzled into Steve’s arm a little more and went still. It was clear the conversation was over, and Steve was glad for it. They didn’t need to talk about it. They shouldn’t have brought it up at all.
Tony smiled, letting his gaze drop. “You know, “ he said after a moment, “we should hang out while you’re here. Not too often that both us are in the city.”
He fought the urge to roll his eyes. “What, Stark Industries’ shit? Please. Peter Stark would turn over everything he and his father ever created if you paid him enough.”
“Then and only then, I find one cruddy soup can in the cupboard, and that’s when I make your soup. That’s when I make it for ya, ‘cause I know you haven’t eaten all day.”
the way back, until only a little red film remained. It wasn’t quite as impressive as chugging a bottle of Patron, but he only had so many options as a—
He tried and failed to crack a smile. To joke it off. “Um, yeah. I, uh—Blaine says it takes a little while to get adjusted.” Bucky knew that. Bucky knew all too well. “This is just…It’s different.”
Steve kissed him again, sliding his hand back to run his fingers through Tony’s hair. Sometimes he forgot how perfect Tony was. He knew Steve was too attached to Peter, but never brought it up when Steve wasn’t ready. They had talked about it a few times, and even saw someone about it just a few weeks ago. That doctor said it was normal, to wait a month or so and see what happened.
Tony said it so casually, as though Steve hadn’t been shaking every time they boarded a train, refusing to look out the window because he had been so scared of seeing corpses piled in the fields and machine guns poking from the rocky outcroppings.
Steve just waved a second time, the lump in his throat too big to speak around. He busied himself with his phone turning it back on to receive several emails and yes, a few texts from Tony.
They said their goodbyes the same way they always did, quick and to the point. Rhodey never wanted it to feel like maybe this goodbye was the last, even though they both knew that was possible. Missions popped up at any time, and though Tony was taking  a break from them, sometimes the world just needed saving.
The waitress looked at the spitball, and trailed her eyes back to him. Tony could see her imagining a trajectory.
Blaine smirked, but it faded. For a moment he just stared at the ceiling, “You think you’re gonna be alone the rest of your life, Steve?”
Steve watched the moon with the sound of crashing waves all around him, and for a moment, everything was normal. This was a welcome vacation from the hell he’d created for himself by marrying the man he loved—the man who no longer loved him. The man who lay beside him on a goddamn beach on a goddamn island that wasn’t supposed to exist. But aliens weren’t supposed to exist either, so Steve could hardly be surprised.
“So you have a kid, right?” Blaine asked as he scooped more potatoes onto his plate and created a crater with the serving spoon to fill with gravy. “With Stark?”
The bed was perfectly made, but with a new comforter. A trunk also sat at the foot of the bed, one made of heavy wood that didn’t match the rest of the space. Tony would never allow such a contradiction in style, yet there it was, plain and oak, and fastened shut with iron.
But right now he had to focus on his daughter. He was only just starting to learn what time of sound meant what, and that her little grin turned sly just before he took off running toward the nearest dangerous object.
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “I’m going to pretend you didn’t say that. You know that would never happen.”
But he loved Tony. Still. He could never shake it. Loving Tony was part of his being—he’d taken an oath to love and protect him at all costs. Even if Tony broke that oath and severed that vow, Steve would always hold up his end up the bargain.
He took purposeful strides around to the side of the house and forced himself not to think about how life would just go on if he wasn’t there.
“Ready,” he called as he fluffed up Tony’s pillow. He gave Tony the most protected side of the bed, just in case. Steve had just recently proven he could take a few more bullets than most.
“He won’t throw it away,” Tony cut. “I want another visual from Tony’s shoulder. He keeps looking away.”
Steve sighed. “I mean, yeah. But when people aren’t visiting I’m down on my floor by myself, and no one asks me to do anything because they just assume I’m with you.”
Steve was so tired. Not physically tired—never physically tired—but exhausted all the same. He wanted to sleep, to curl up alone in the sand and pretend he could face this in the morning.
Sometimes he wondered what it would have been like if he weren’t a billionaire. Maybe he still could have become Iron Man, but even he knew his role as the man in a can was becoming less and less relevant as his fine lines turned to wrinkles and his hair was less salt and pepper and more…Gandalf the Grey. His years as an Avenger were numbered, but his role as the financial and physical support for the team would continue long after his death.
Fuck Steve. Tony had never expected him to turn out to be the asshole father, but here they fucking were.
“Well sorry, you didn’t bring your vibranium shield,” Blaine growled. “Remind me to have you bring it next time.”
With a few clicks, the static in Steve’s ears went dead. He sucked in a breath, listening to the noise of his oxygen system as it wheezed in his ears, as if to remind him he was still there, still alive.
Tony nodded, quirking his lips a little.  “If that’s what you want. Crazy monster alien stuff could be a nice upgrade to those War Machine stories.”
“Come on, Tony,” Steve said in the same way he used to when he took Peter’s side about whether they were going to the zoo or Coney Island. “I haven’t been part of this family for a long time.”
With that, the meeting adjourned. The screen went black, blending into the dark granite as they made final preparations for the mission. Bucky was shooting looks at him that said he wasn’t happy with the outcome, but Steve ignored them like he had for the past century. If Tony agreed with him, it couldn’t be too stupid of an idea.
Even if Steve had never told him what happened in that alternate dimension, only that he’d gone to one.
He had never trusted another person more. Not even Bucky. He had trusted Bucky with all of his secrets and they had been best friends, but with Tony it was so much more. Steve didn’t just trust him, he knew him. That was the only way he could think to describe it. His confidence in Tony was so strong that whenever they worked together on something, Steve knew with full certainty that they would succeed. When he couldn’t think, Tony thought for him. They filled each other’s holes. More than that, they built each other up so that even when they were separated, they weren’t any weaker. Tony made him stronger than he had ever been and Steve knew he did the same for his husband.
Tony had kissed him like this before. He really was a great actor—all of his PR grooming from his childhood took center stage when it came to putting on a show in the bedroom. Tony had slept with women all over the world for various reasons. And later, he’d done the same with men. Most of them meant nothing to Tony, even his summertime flings that lasted months on end. Fuel for the gossip rags, faked for attention. But Tony didn’t like his partners to be in on the game.
Tony observed him for a moment, then moved again, this time resting his cheek on Steve’s stomach.  Steve tried not to let his breath catch too audibly, and moved his hand to gently card his fingers through Tony’s hair. His heartbeat echoed in his ears so loudly he was sure Tony could hear it. If he did, he didn’t say anything.
Tony suddenly wished he could be one of these children and run to hide behind the legs of someone bigger than him, someone who would send Steve away. But instead he could only watch as Steve came closer and closer, as his daughter gripped Steve’s hand like maybe he’d just missed out on the whole part where he and Steve had gotten back together and were co-parenting.
Bucky yelled some more, then his voice was clear. “It’s always a fuckin’ bad time if you call,” he snarled.
He remembered his mother’s rosary, he remembered the way it felt to be on his knees beside her, listening to her quiet voice recite prayers when he didn’t know the meaning. She’d gripped hard to her faith, and he’d seen it save her many times. When his father beat her, she had a place to turn. When she was scared of the future, she prayed. When she needed just a few minutes of peace, she prayed.
Soldiers made the mistake of calling them wannabe badasses until they saw the way that operators (that was what they were called—not soldiers) lived and trained.
Somehow, Tony had done the impossible and raised their child to be a good kid who stayed out of trouble and kept a steady girlfriend and made the right choices in life. Tony had also put up with a whiny, selfish asshole of an ex husband who only thought about himself and how to be the most dramatic to get attention.
The mirage of brick fell away, revealing a door. It looked different than Steve remembered, but he supposed that made sense too. He had no idea what was going on, but he was inside, and that was what mattered.
Steve hadn’t been to church in a long time. He told himself it was because he was busy, because he’d been on the run, because the last time he’d been in a church was to carry out Peggy’s coffin. In all truth, he wasn’t sure the real reason. As he sat in his pew, he wasn’t intimidated like many people were. Church had always been a touchpoint for him. A community when he had none at home. His mother had done her best to tithe, to help the other ladies of the church bake pies for the bake sales or raise money for the homeless, even when most of them were dangling on the edge of homelessness themselves.
“Win or lose, I’m leaving,” Blaine said. He stood up, scrubbing his beanie to scratch his head and letting out a yawn. “Fuck, I swear Galipault put fucking BB’s in the sim this morning.”
thanks for tagging along on the ride, everyone!! feel free to send a prompt of your own to my tumblr (@chubbydino) and if you really, really want something cool, keep an eye out for the Marvel Trumps Hate event in a few weeks - I'll have two fics up for auction there (for charity!)!
When he couldn’t, Steve fell forward, landing harshly on the grimy subway floor. He caught himself with his hands, and pushed back up as effortlessly as he would have if he’d planned the fall.
It would have been nice, though, for Tony to ask this time.  Just in case he’d changed, just in case he wasn’t the person Tony had known before.
They would eat good food, dance, have fun when everyone got drunk (except Tony, Steve, and Thor—and maybe Jackson) and then everyone would hang out again the day after to soak up the sun before Tony and Jackson headed off to wherever for their honeymoon.
The hug didn’t last long before Sam was stepping back and asking Blaine where the hell he could get a beer.
Tony crossed his arms. “Well you could still text me. Call me sometimes, just so I wasn’t sitting there thinking you didn’t love me anymore.”
The man smiled, and it was Tony’s smile. Except this guy was about twenty years younger than the real Tony Stark. Same facial hair, though.  “It’s me, Cap. It’s Tony.”
Steve turned to see Tony dressed in sweats and a loose shirt, crossing through the open-air kitchen and into the living room with him.
Steve shuffled into the master bedroom, and found it was actually more like home than his floor in the tower. The bed frame was rough wood that looked to have been made by hand. A simple mattress with dusty blue sheets and one pillow made up the bedding. Steve unrolled their sleeping bags on top of it all anyway. Bed bugs were not fun.
“You just don’t love me,” Steve finished, brow creasing. “Tony, don’t you get how that hurts when you say that? I understand. Stop repeating it.”
Steve kept his eyes straight ahead, not wanting to look at his son anymore. His son who thought he was talking to a man younger than him.
No one ever called him a nice person anymore. When that had started happening, he didn’t know, but as he led his team through a deserted Russian town, it crossed his mind. People had once assumed him to be ignorant and adorable because of it. They smiled at him when he didn’t understand things, as though they had won some sort of game Steve hadn’t known they were playing.
But he watched her walk down the alleyway and just before she turned the corner and out of sight, his finger shifted and he touched the metal scythe at his fingertip, running down the little curve but never firing.
“C’mon, kiddo, you’re gonna be late.” Tony handed over Morgan’s little lunchbox as she came flying around the corner of the kitchen island. Tony had picked out a lovely purple dress for her—velvet—with a little white collar and matching white sunhat. Pepper said she looked like Madeline, but Tony thought she looked adorable, even if that was true. Morgan seemed to love  it, and that was all that mattered.
Steve shook his head. “I don’t think so. Natasha has started trying to set me up with people and I don’t think any of you guys should be playing matchmaker.”
Tony’s brow creased and he shook his head. “No, Steve. I’m worried about you, okay? I’m worried about what’s good for
“You were cheating on him,” Steve said, brow furrowing. As much as everyone loved to believe Tony was the kind of guy who ought to be known for that kind of thing, Steve knew that wasn’t really him.
“I was going to ask you the same thing,” Winona said, leaning back in her chair. She sat with her back straight, perfect posture and poise. She was someone who could adopt a kid no problem.
Bucky just shook his head. “Don’t you let him make you reckless, Steve,” he said, his voice low. “Don’t you dare let that happen. We came out here to get you away from him. I’m not gonna let him tear apart everything you got yourself away from.” Bucky stepped closer, just as angry as he had been so many times before when Steve was skinny and small and covered in bruises. “You start feelin’ like shit, you call me. You come to the door, you just don’t talk to him or his goddamn boyfriend. Don’t do it. Got that?”
He remembered the look of absolute disbelief and disappointment in Tony’s eyes when Steve had descended to the lab to apologize.
Tony closed his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. Now he felt like he had to call and warn him. Was it bad that he wouldn’t? They weren’t married anymore, there was no rule on secret-keeping.
Steve woke with the sun, and immediately knew where he was before he even opened his eyes. The penthouse master was his second home. He’d woken up with the scent of Tony’s silk sheets in his nose more than once. The last time he’d slept here had been years ago now, but everything was exactly as he remembered. Tony was an innovator, but he seldom changed his habits at home. Tony liked routine—it comforted him the same way it comforted Steve. There was familiarity in repetition.
Nobody said anything as he walked out. They weren’t the type of men to ask unnecessary questions about his personal life.
Within ten minutes, he was watching Steve’s face again. The way the light danced off his lips, reflecting in the dull luster of his skin.
Steve took his seat, cocking a brow at the menu: a piece of rough-cut paper on a thick clipboard that looked like it had one been part of a table itself.
Tony shifted in his spot, uneasy. He did not like that idea. Confrontation really wasn’t his thing in his personal life. He would rather things blow up in his face, yeah. He was pretty used to making things blow up in all aspects of life at this point.
“Steve, it’s Bucky. Hey, uh, I was just callin’ because I got somethin’ in the mail from Peter today. Look…I think you should call me.  Soon, yeah? I need to talk to ya anyway.” A brief pause. “The dogs are fine. I’m fine too. Kinda lonely here though. But I’ll—hey ya big asshole, get off! Steve, teach your dogs to fuckin' listen. Anyway, call me.”
Tony returned to his side, his hand resting on the small of Steve’s back in a comforting gesture. “Presents, maybe? Mistletoe? Something else Christmas-y?”
The look that crossed Ben’s face was almost a grimace, but too polite to be considered one. “Ah, sorry, I don’t have my phone on me. I’ll look it up, though.”
“Okay,” Tony said as he finally let go of his daughter. “She’s on the couch, I’m gonna go get a cloth.”
He tried not to think about it. Sometimes he tried to think about another man’s lips on his skin or about being pressed close to another warm body, his fingers tangling in a man’s hair.
“Fuck if I know,” Blaine muttered. “We just get the intel and get out.” Blaine looked up at him, eyes narrowing slightly. “We don’t ask questions that don’t pertain to the success of the mission.”
They hurried forward and into the door the man had left open. Steve grabbed the body on the way in and dragged it inside before shutting the door behind him. A security system flashed above, but the flash was green. Safe.
Steve knew he was supposed to stand up for himself, but he also knew that Peter would just see it as proving his point, that he just wanted all of the attention on himself. Maybe that was true. And no greater punishment for his wrongdoing was worse than his own son cutting him down without hesitation.  He brought a hand to his mouth, cursing himself when his tears welled over and tracked down his cheeks.
Tony stood with another draw of wine. “I’ll be back for more magic juice,” Tony told Thor, who might as well have been wagging a tail and slobbering around a tennis ball with the look he got back in return.
He missed the vacations before the divorce. The one where Peter came charging into their bedroom and jumped on the bed, waking them both up and screeching about how it was time to get up so they could go to the little park by the lake or to the ice cream shop or to the shops.
Of course, Steve couldn’t really blame him. Peter hadn’t seen him in almost a half a century. Steve hadn’t aged, but his hair had darkened considerably. And he did look different—sharper eyes, sterner lips, and his beard had even caused Tony to look at him suspiciously during their last conversation.
“Steve.” Tony moved closer, pulling Steve to him. Steve let himself be pulled, but he didn’t burrow into Tony’s shirt like he wanted to. “I should have been more open about it. I know that now. I shouldn’t have…fuck, I know the way I went about it was wrong. But I couldn’t—you always think everything can be fixed. You always run yourself ragged trying to make sure everything is fixed. And this wasn’t fixable. I knew it.”
“Come on,” Tony said, turning. His blanket swished behind him, trailing along the floor as he started walking.
Steve meant it as a funny thing, but all Tony could think about was Steve Rogers sitting alone, calling into radio stations for museum tickets (as if it could get more sad) for entertainment. He did so love to torture himself.
Tony turned to see Steve there, way too close. His vision was getting pleasantly hazy, his blood warm. He felt like a middle schooler again. Aesir wine probably had a higher alcohol content than Everclear, so at least there was that. If it could get Steve drunk, one glass was definitely enough to down him even in his glory days.
Steve paused mid-step, loosely gripping the handrail. He looked around, as though some sort of light would show, but none did.
Tony sat at the edge of a pile of rubble, his shoulders heaving, his helmet lodged in the earth beside him. The air was thick with smoke, with small flames peeking out from underneath concrete and rebar.
It sounded like Tony was just trying to convince himself, but Steve had seen it get better. He’d felt it.
“Donate, I know. I did that too. I also know that nobody doesn’t bring a gift to a wedding,” Steve said. “Is something wrong, Pepper?”
He stood up on shaky legs, grazing his fingers on Blaine’s shoulder like he did when moving up from behind him on mission. Habit.
“You’re spacing again,” Tony murmured, stepping up to him and framing Steve’s face with his hands. “Wanna talk?”
“Hey,” Steve said quietly before plopping down on the dirt beside him. They were both exhausted, but the world ablaze around them was comforting, not sinister. It was quiet, which meant the battle was over. Finally fucking over.
“I think I need to go,” Steve said quietly. As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew it was what he needed to do. He couldn’t stay here tonight, even if he’d been dreaming it for the past three months. Not if Tony had a kid here. He’d been around enough orphans in his lifetime to know that some new person in their home—especially a person there to stay—could ruin whatever Tony had built over the past few months.
Even in the night sky above, he swore he saw an enemy UAV, an oncoming Predator strike, or the flicker of a bomber wing in the moonlight, ready to turn the whole island into a bloody mess of rubble.
It was Not-Tony’s turn to look confused. But the expression wasn’t long on his face before it was replaced with a knowing calm. “Ah. My mistake. That was what I was told.”
Steve shrugged. “You used to get riled sometimes when I took missions without consulting you first.”
Tony tried not to have expectations. He told himself (and his therapist) that he knew expectations set him up for failure. Steve had to show up on his own accord. It was Steve’s choice, and Tony had to be happy to see him when and if he did appear.
Steve looked up from his dried cranberry, iceberg lettuce salad to get a look at his new acquaintance.
The boat smelled like dead fish and saltwater, mixed with faint odors of rifle grease and old sweat. It didn’t matter if he breathed through his mouth or his nose; the smells of war permeated everything.
“What are you doing here, anyway?” Tony asked, finally realizing that this wasn’t an Avengers event.
The moment Blaine was gone, his throat tightened up again and rocks settled in his lungs. The shadows on the terrace churned, hiding silhouettes of men with weapons. A flapping string of flags above resounded in Steve’s ears as the slaps of bullets tearing bodies apart.
Bucky smiled and Steve found himself unsettled by the fact that it was genuine. “Can’t say I’ve heard anything about you, but I think that’s part of the deal,” Bucky said.
The night terrors were supposed to be over. Steve had worked through them while they had been together. It had been one of their “things” in the beginning of their relationship. Tony would sit up at night whenever Steve woke terrified, gasping for air or fighting him off. Steve didn’t have the kind of terrors that were portrayed in the movies. His were always ugly, warped, and legitimately terrifying to experience as a partner.
He had to get home, even if he didn’t want to be there. Even if he didn’t want to pretend he had gotten sleep last night instead of sitting awake, wondering if every noise was one of Jackson and Tony in the bedroom next door.
Then again, his gut had also told him those eyes were familiar. Maybe a different color, but familiar.
And then he was standing at a mirror, a razor in his hand, shaving cream on his face. Except it wasn’t his face, and he couldn’t move the new body he’d been given. He was present—possessing of this body, but unable to control it, no matter how hard he struggled.
“My dad hit my mom, Pete. And I saw it,” he whispered, as though his father might come storming in with slurs in his mouth and a bottle in one hand, a belt in the other.  “We didn’t have a big house like you and I do. My daddy drank a lot of that grown-up medicine, like Daddy does, and that made him extra mean.”
Steve snatched the fabric back into place with a huff. “My clothes were soaked. I’m not about to sit around in wet clothes. Besides, it’s not like you’ve never seen me naked before.”
He held himself together though, like he had learned to do in the war. Emotional though he was, Steve had still been trained like any other soldier, and then like any other officer. If things got bad, he was the one who sucked it up and led his team.
Tony rounded on him, angrily yanking off his sunglasses and folding them on his chest. “What the fuck are you doing here?”
Steve looked like he might refuse that one too, but a smile spread across his face before he hurried along to his side again.
“I didn’t want her here when you got home,” Tony confessed, voice tight. “I wasn’t going to bombard you with that.”
Wanda touched his hand again, and he closed his eyes as the pain washed over him anew. Worst was the confusion. It reminded Vision of the way Tony had come to him in the dark.
MJ extended her hand to show off a spectacular ring of what looked like white gold and rubies. Far from the amateurish thing Steve had expected.
“Fuck, Steve, not tonight,” Tony groaned. He got out of his chair as he swallowed some of his meal and turned to face him with cheesy lips.
The boat in front of them hit a mine before they could even see land. A giant burst of white water shot up from the sea as though Poseidon had decided to try his hand at lightning.  The boat went vertical, a direct hit, tossed like a child’s toy. Men were flung into the sea. Body parts landed in Steve’s boat. A man’s hand landed on the helmet of a boy in front of him, still leaking blood.
“Come on up, slowpoke,” he said as he crouched down and offered Steve a hand to help him up the ladder.
The man’s hand moved to her hair, pulling out the hair tie and combing his fingers through the target’s shiny locks.
Steve just shook his head, his tear ducts somehow still functioning. “I’m disgusting,” he whispered. “All I’ve ever done is hurt the both of them.”
It took Steve a moment to understand. “You mean you could have sent me back all this time?!?” He could have been home, he could have been with his Tony, somewhere safe and familiar. His
Tony found himself thinking of Steve the moment he woke every morning. Steve’s name was in his mouth as though he’d just spoken it, and as he snapped to consciousness he always saw a flash of Steve’s face behind his eyelids. Even when he woke to Morgan thrashing in her crib, crying or screaming, he still thought first of Steve.
“When I was little I would spend one week at Tony’s house, on week at Steve’s. That was different than most of the kids my age and it was pretty hard sometimes. I’d forget something at one house but I wouldn’t want to ask my dad to go pick it up all the way across town. And Tony and Steve just have very different parenting styles,” Peter said. He gave a little shrug. “Tony was always there to help with my homework and Steve was always doing dad things, you know? Going to the zoo, taking me to baseball games, stuff like that.”
But tonight was all about art class graduation. Morgan’s biggest and best projects would be on display, and Tony couldn’t wait to see them. More so, he wanted to see how she interacted with her classmates. Whenever he dropped her off at class she would zoom right to a table of other kids, but she never talked about them. When he asked, she rolled her eyes. Teenage years were going to be fun, he could already tell.
Blaine cracked his neck as he slipped into his rain jacket and Steve followed suit, though it took him a bit longer only using one arm.
“Listen to me.” Tony reached over, folding his hand over Steve’s. Steve reluctantly met his eye. “Fighting is easy. It’s always easy to find something wrong. And he’ll probably do it a lot—God knows I did. And it’s not right, but it’s temporary.”
“Vacation in the Smokies,” Tony murmured as he leaned over to place the photo on the bedside table. “We took a month off every year when we first got married. Until Peter came along.”
Seawater hissed over the side of the boat, soaking the men across the deck from where Steve stood. The Major continued.
They locked eyes for only a second before the both of them quickly looked elsewhere, and Steve punched the button to call the elevator a few too many times.
Bucky grabbed his arm, pulling him back. Steve stumbled a bit, and for a moment it looked like their lips might just—
Steve narrowed his eyes at her. “Why did they want you back so bad, huh? What are you, some pop star turned reporter?”
“Leaving so soon?” Steve said as he pulled on a pair of sweats still on the floor from the afternoon before.
“You mean they never expect me to lie,” Steve clarified. As soon as he said it, he knew he shouldn’t have, and Tony jumped right on it.
Steve felt like an absolute dick, but his conscience was quick to remind him that Tony could get pretty nasty when he started a fight with Steve. Thinking back now, he’d just retaliated, even in moments where he should have questioned why Tony was starting a fight out of the blue.
If Thor were coming, he would have been here already. And probably halfway through the alcohol supply too.
Across the street, the curtains moved and Bucky appeared, eyes ringed with dark circles and his hair in disarray.
“Wings you stole from the FALCON project,” Blaine said, and maybe there was a challenge in his voice.
“Why would I—” Tony caught himself. Steve was his boyfriend now. He cleared his throat. “Steve can make decisions for himself. I don’t call the shots for him.”
He quickened his pace when the crowd started cheering again for Steve, and made it to the DJ’s booth even as adoring guests reached and held out phones for selfies. Steve had never been good at ignoring fans, and a quick glance behind him showed that he had stopped short of entering the dance floor, but he was looking over the guests with a frown, clearly watching Tony.
He grabbed his duffel, punching the elevator call button about fifty times, hoping like hell Tony didn’t leave the bedroom to come after him.
