“I love you too, Tony.”
Steve lay Tony down in bed, taking off his shoes and watching as he climbed under the covers. Without being asked he sat down on the bed, reaching over to pet Tony’s hair. The other man seemed to instantly relax, his eyes closing.
“Well what would you do to show that you were interested?”
Tony started and nearly fell out of his chair at the touch, Steve quickly catching him.
The next time he was in Tony’s workshop he found himself sketching him as he worked, penciling out the lines of his body as he stood over his workbench. He took extra care in doing so, then when he was done, he carefully tore out the page and placed it on the end of his workbench before walking out. He didn’t seem to see him leave it, which was fine. He’d find it later.
Tony frowned, then sat up and fumbled with the laces for a moment. Miraculously he managed to get them undone. Even drunk out of his mind, Tony Stark was good with his hands.
“What makes you say that?”
“What! You’re the one who-”
“You keep… doing nice shit. You draw me? And you’re actually kinda flirting back now.” Tony looked up at him suspiciously. “What do you want from me?”
He did end up staying.
Tony shrugged. “Probably.”
“What about Rhodes?”
Probably. Did you talk to JARVIS? -SR
“Maybe. You know Tony struggles with expressing his emotions in a healthy way.”
“I don’t think sober you would like that very much.”
Tony considered it for a moment, then nodded, accepting it. “Okay.”
“Yeah?”
Tony gave him an offended look. “Mean.”
Steve was a little taken aback. Even drunk he wasn’t expecting such a straightforward answer. “You… love me?”
The AI lowered the lights, and Steve watched as Tony began to doze off. On impulse, he reached out, smoothing down the messy curls on the top of his head. Tony made a content little noise, pressing his head into Steve’s hand like a cat. So he continued, running his hand through his hair, continuing long after he started snoring. Eventually he pulled back, and when Tony didn’t stir, he got to his feet and left him to sleep.
“Please…”
So he gave it time. He went about life as usual, spending time in Tony’s workshop sketching, bringing him lunch, talking him into going to bed when it was clear he was running on fumes. And as time went on, the feelings he’d been debating over just grew more noticeable. The way his smile would make him irrationally happy, or how his heart would beat a little faster when he laughed, or a fond, aching feeling in his chest when he did something small or inconsequential that Steve’s heart deemed worthy of extra affection.
“I’m your friend, Tony. Of course I’m going to be there for you.”
“Not like you do.”
Steve scooped Tony up, the other man wrapping his arms around his neck. He started carrying him to the elevator.
“And he looked really good in training clothes,” he mumbled into his coffee.
“I’d compliment him or draw him and leave it in places he could find. I made dinner a lot too, but that was mostly because I was at home while he worked.”
He carried on like that for a while, leaving Tony drawings and returning his compliments and cooking for him every so often. Tony seemed to be getting increasingly more wary, and while he accepted all the new attention directed his way, he seemed a little hesitant about it, like he was waiting for Steve to ask for something or for the other shoe to drop.
“You’re drunk, Tony. You shouldn’t say stuff like that.”
“It’s getting kind of hard to ignore. I look at him and it almost hurts. And the last training exercise we had watching him-”
He sounded so small when he said that, so fragile. Like the plea was slightly desperate, about to bring him to tears. Something in Steve’s chest ached.
In that year, he and Tony ended up close, close enough that he’d ended up with special access to his workshop. Tony had given it to him after the eighth or ninth time he’d showed up with his sketchpad to sit on his couch and sketch, claiming that it wasn’t good for him to be locked up in his lab with no human company.
“Well how about I take you out to dinner, and we can figure out where to go from there?”
“Okay.”
After what felt like about an hour, Steve got up, heading out of the room.
No, I only woke up an hour ago. -TS
A number of emotions flew across Tony’s face, ranging from shock to confusion to something that Steve could only read as ‘I’m too hungover to process this’. It was then that Steve realized he might be jumping the gun just a bit.
“But you should be. Stay here.” Steve made sure Tony was as steady as possible on the chair before heading to the small fridge he kept in the workshop. He moved around a few bottles before finding some water. He brought it over to Tony, unscrewing the top and handing it to him. “Here, drink.”
“Stay?”
Tony took the water and took a swig, spilling a little on himself. He looked up at Steve as he wiped his mouth. “Why are you so nice?” he slurred.
That stopped him in his tracks. Tony? The man who flirted with him nonstop was in love with him? Well, actually, when he thought about it in those terms, it wasn’t so hard to believe. But Tony was clearly heavily intoxicated. He probably didn’t understand what he was saying.
“So this is a… bad thing?”
“Yes, I’m sure. Very sure.”
Half an hour later he was walking into Tony’s penthouse with a bag of takeout containers, enough for both of them. He made his way to the kitchen and put the bag down, then sent Tony a quick text letting him know that he was there.
to flirt. He’d never really done it before. He’d only had one relationship in the past. One and a half if one were to count Peggy. Then again, their relationship had basically amounted to Peggy flirting and them kissing once. And with Bucky it had just been natural. Bucky flirted plenty, but Steve mostly just responded with blushing and stammering out an appropriate, if slightly lame, reply.
“-I’m going to stop you right there.”
"Of course, sir."
This time he was careful not to scare him. He made sure he could see him approaching before he put his hand on his shoulder.
“Just being honest.” The elevator doors opened and Steve stepped out onto Tony’s floor, carrying him to his room. “I think we need to have a talk when you’re sober.”
“Maybe you should tell your sober self that. Sober Tony’s kind of an asshole.”
“Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve frowned, and Tony gave him the best puppy-dog eyes he could while he was severely intoxicated. Eventually Steve sighed and scooped him up into his arms.
“You really need to stop doing this. You’re going to get yourself hurt when you’re drunk in here one day.”
“A few months ago you said that you thought you were falling in love with me. And last night you said that you did love me.” He paused. “Wait, did you actually not mean it?”
Natasha raised an eyebrow.
“Very.” Tony snuggled up close to Steve, pressing his face between his pecs. “You smell good.”
“Drink the rest of this, okay? And get some sleep.”
“Everything about you is just… perfect. Beautiful and nice and… you know.” He waved his hand, nearly hitting Steve in the face. “Dunno how I got so damn lucky. Mr. Perfect is my friend.”
“Did you mean it when you said you thought you were falling in love with me?”
It took another minute of Tony holding that stare for Steve to sigh and sit on the edge of the bed. “Fine. But just until you fall asleep.”
Tony shook his head and cuddled closer to Steve, closing his eyes. “Think ’m falling in love with you.”
“You make me feel safe,” Tony continued. “I dunno why. I think it’s ‘cause you take care of me. Always there when I need you.”
Then I’ll bring lunch. I’ll see you in half an hour? -SR
Tony looked more than a little surprised at the sudden turn in conversation, which was fair. “I said that?”
“…so I’m pretty sure I like him too.”
Steve nodded, deciding that was a decent idea.
“Shi- Don’t scare me like that.” Tony’s words were slurred, and it was immediately apparent that he was pretty far gone.
“Thank you. Water first, then bed.”
Tony groaned, pressing his face back into Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t like those. Rather be drunk.”
Steve blinked. Tony had said a lot of things about him before, but ‘nice’ wasn’t one of them. “What?”
“I’m not going to leave you, Tones. Promise.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. I just never actually expected you to like me back.”
The morning after was the same as the last. A text from Tony a little before noon thanking him for taking him to bed and mentioning that JARVIS had told him he’d stayed with him. He didn’t mention anything about him playing with his hair, so he figured the AI must have left that part out.
“Tony play nice,” Steve began and immediately followed it up with, “Now move, jerk. This is Tony’s spot.” Steve caught the small pleased smile on Tony’s face when he passed the popcorn.
“Thanks... “ Tony said, making it sound like a question and in doing so, making Steve nervous. Tony was staring at the rose like he’d never seen anything like it before
When it was obvious that Steve had moved into Tony’s place (even if the pair of idiots hadn’t realized it yet), Clint dropped from one of the vents into Steve’s apartment in the tower. He thought it was only a matter of time before he’d be called on to officiate the wedding (he was already ordained in New York, Vermont and just in case California), or to make the best man speech (he’d fight Bucky tooth and nail for it).
A few days ago, Tony had shown up late for movie night, half asleep with a screwdriver in his hand. He walked straight to his and Steve’s couch and had seemed confused at finding Bucky sitting in his regular spot.
Bucky.
“Not a demon,” Bucky reminded them. ‘But to answer your question I was born in Brooklyn, My mom fell in love with an incubus and here I am,” Buck explained. “Although, to be fair, I have been a demon-in-training for a long time now.”
And that was that. A few weeks later, Steve had moved in and they found themselves planning the Halloween party to end all parties.
The next year, during their, now, annual Halloween party, Clint showed up with graveyard dirt, a stuffed cat plush, and a kitchen knife. “I’m ready,” he told Steve as soon as he opened the door. “I want my very own demon.”
And waited.
“I’d love to,” Tony said with a smile. He put his arms around Steve’s neck and pulled him down to gently press his lips to Steve’s, who barely had time to react before Tony was moving away.
Such an innocent, common question but so hard to answer. Neither Tony nor Steve really knew how to. Bucky always did -- with honesty.
It seemed that no more magazines or google searches would be needed. To quote Bucky, he’d just have to show moxie and take the plunge. He’d have to create a good plan for it. Steve needed everything to be clear to Tony. No backpedaling this time.
“Don’t anger the demon,” Steve whispered. Louder, he said, “What do we do now?”
“I didn’t think we needed to explain anything,” Tony said and knew immediately that it was the wrong thing to say based on Steve’s pinched look. “I mean, I thought you were my boyfriend?” he added and made it into a question in case he had misunderstood.
“Ok?”
***********
Nope, he was not touching that one.
“Tony, would you like to be my date for my class’ art show?”
“Ok. Let’s see what happens. So art exhibit, you said?”
Either way, Clint figured he should start getting his material ready. And after a couple of hours of snooping, he found the best thing he never knew he needed.
The book he found there gave step by step instructions on the summoning of demons. He had everything he needed, well, not everything but he could improvise. He was sure that if demons did indeed exist, it would be the intent that would matter.
So Tony read books, searched online, and even went to a mystic store called Enchanted Chaos that was recommended to him by Natasha, who found the whole thing amusing and told Tony he could sleep on her couch if things went tits up.
After the rides comment, Tony grabbed him by the hand and took him straight to medical, insisting he might have a concussion. To be fair, Steve had just been hit in the head by a doom bot.
Lesson learned, no coffee comments.
“Your art collection is amazing.”
“Excuse me, the correct term would be Cambion for now. Demons are usually fallen angels and I was never an angel,” Bucky said. “I won’t actually be a demon like you’d see in the Bible when I graduate. My momma was human and my father an incubus.”
“We’ll have a Student Art Exhibit and I’d love for you to come,” Steve said as they walked towards a small park that was nearby. “Nat, Buck and Sam are coming too,” he added to let Tony know he wouldn’t be there alone while Steve made the expected rounds during the exhibit.
“What’s your ETA Captain Apple Pie? Doom has once again chosen quantity over quality and I have been grounded.”
This whole thing was getting worse and worse by the second. Steve was going to kill Bucky, Clint and maybe even James for making him think just asking Tony out would be enough. This was just great.
“Almost there Iro-Fuck!” He had been hit with a ray of fire? Laser? The Force? Thankfully he was able to deflect it with his shield at the last second.
“What the fuck? Move Elsa, that’s my spot next to Captain Snack-Pack,” he toed Bucky’s foot, raising an eyebrow and pointedly looking between Bucky and the empty couch next to them.
That’s when Tony found out just how superstitious Steve really was.
Tony looked taken aback, but smiled pleasantly. “I have a meeting with R&D in a few minutes, but I’ll be done by 2, if you want to meet me down there.”
At two on the dot, Steve was waiting for Tony in the lobby area of the R&D department. He had taken great care to look good for Tony; he’d even left the khakis at home and had worn a pair of designer jeans that Bucky said made his ass look like America’s Ass. Since they’d be walking to the burger joint, he was also wearing his Chucks and a leather jacket over his white t-shirt (no button up, per Sam’s advice).
“Cap, you have that face again,” Clint brought him out of his thoughts. “That face that says you’re thinking about how you’d like to bend Tony over the table and make him call you daddy..”
“I’d really like to get your, er…” Steve cleared his throat, and decided to just say it fast. Like pulling a band aid, “I’d like todateyourTonyandwantyoutobeokwithit.”
“Captain, I’m worried about you,” Tony said as his suit rose from the ground to provide air support. “Roses Steve? Really?”
James just sat there with a look of pleasant surprise on his face, which quickly changed into something darker. “And what makes you think you are good enough for Tony? Didn’t you tell him he better stop pretending to be a hero once, that you knew men worth ten of him? And now what? You want to date him?”
“Yes, and they are for you. Now please focus on these pieces of scraps?”
“Sounds great, just let me know when.”
“Can you do that?” Tony asked excitedly, only to receive a flat look from both Steve
“Yeah, and they smell nice.”
It was now or never. “Are you busy right now Tony? We could go out to lunch?” He asked Tony out. He asked Tony out. He did it.
“It is the closest distance between point A and point Hit The Hay with Stark,” Bucky added unhelpfully.
“Oh Clint, you’re making our Captain blush,” and because the universe had it against him, there was Tony. “But what is it about this time?” He asked while searching for his favorite mug.
“Not a lady, why Steve, you’ve been holding out on me,” Tony sat down across from Steve and leaned his elbows on the table, cradling the cup of coffee in his hands.
The night of the summoning came and Tony found himself holding a box of graveyard dirt, and a stuffed black cat. “It's the spirit of the intention, Steve, not the letter of the law... I'm not going to hurt a cat just to prove demons don't exist,” he explained.
She said that it had been owned by the same witch for centuries. Tony was a little skeptical (“Centuries, Nat? Really?”) but off he went anyway.
“Sam likes Bucky?” Steve asked no one in particular.
“Thanks for the save; I’d be lost without you.”
Steve felt his face heat up and grabbed his neck with his left hand in embarrassment. “I thought so,” Steve answered trying to figure out where he’d gone wrong. “Look, it doesn’t have to mean anything if you don’t want it to. You can still come to the exhibit as a friend - I get it.”
“I told you not to mess about with this stuff, Tony!” Steve yelled. He was a good Catholic boy, and his mama (may she rest in peace) would have his hide if she knew what they had just done. “We have a DEMON IN OUR HOUSE!”
Next to the table where the guestbook was, where there would normally be a picture of the happy couple, there was a blown up scrapbook page - and while Tony and Steve could have vetoed it, they loved it. Well, Tony loved it. Steve just loved Tony.
Decision made, he headed towards the elevator checking to make sure he had his wallet and StarkPhone.
“Spit it out, Steve. You look like you’re about to have a heart attack,” James said once it was obvious Steve would not be saying what he came to say any time soon.
“You know, you’re a pretty swell guy Tony.”
Pizza night with the team?
Bucky looked at them like they had suddenly sprouted second heads. “I thought we already were?” he said.
The roses, the compliments, the texts, none of that mattered if Tony didn’t realize what was happening.
Bucky set a mug of coffee in front of Steve and after a moment, added a generous amount of Whiskey. “Stevie, you’re being as subtle as the uniform you wore during your USO days.”
He was as tall as Steve, brunette, with deep icy blue eyes with a red rim around the irises. He took a deep breath and was about to say something but was interrupted by Tony.
finding the whole thing exciting though. He meant to prove that there were no such things as demons and yet, here was proof that there was something
“That was a nice repulsor shot Tony.”
“Sam wants to have my ass-kicking, leather-wearing, murder-faced babies, Steve. How did you not know that? But that’s not the point. The point is, desperate times need desperate measures.”
He put the shield on his back and cleared the car in one jump. Bouquet of roses still on one hand.
And waited for a while longer.
cambion was just so pretty, and Tony had always been a sucker for a pretty face.
“So how did you two meet Bucky?”
“Ok,” ugh, how could Tony make that sound like such a long word?
“I don’t know what to do with that information,” Tony said honestly while trying hard not to get lost in the demon’s eyes. The
And because Tony would not be Tony if he wasn’t using the scientific method any time he could, he decided to try to call up a demon, just to show Steve that things would be fine if they played a little ouija at their Halloween party.
“Yes, I’m destroying them look, see? I punched one, but I can still ask. Who stops for flowers on their way to a fight? I mean, thank you and all, but aren’t you the one always talking about priorities?”
Steve winced, remembering the harsh words Tony and him had exchanged when they first met. “I’ve admitted since then I was in the wrong. I let myself be swayed by an incomplete and biased report provided by SHIELD.”
It seemed that no matter what he said, Tony would give him this odd look - it was a mix between pensive and constipated. Not a good look for him necessarily, but nobody’s perfect.
Once they had their orders, Steve took a deep breath and prepared to talk to James about his wish to date Tony. And then took another. And another. And now he was hyperventilating.
Anyway, That’s what made movie night both Steve’s favorite and worst night of the week. Sitting next to Tony, almost feeling the warmth he emanated and watching those nimble fingers fly across his StarkPad. Sitting close enough to see the few freckles that adorned his face.
“Tony summoned me from the depths of hell,” he answered matter of factly. Every. Single. Time.
“Tony, I think you are amazing, and I wanted this to be a date. Hopefully the first of many, and I hope you want that too. Do you?”
um, Cap, Cappy, Capsicle... i think u sent this 2 the wrong person? Good for u though, get it!
Steve placed his hands on Tony’s hips, bringing their foreheads together and trying to memorize every detail of that moment. The smell of the rose still in one of Tony’s hands; the taste of Tony’s lips on his, a mixture of the chocolate shake he’d drank and coconut; the sound of the voices around them; the feel of Tony’s hands still around him. Steve cupped Tony’s face in his hands and kissed Tony on the corner of his mouth, the tip of his nose, each cheek, and finally his lips.
The walk and meal itself seemed no different than any other times they had gone out to eat, but Steve thought that was a good thing. They were comfortable with each other, no need to put on airs, or try to impress the other. This was just a new phase in their relationship. More than friends now.
**********
When they were leaving, James extended his hand to Steve and pulled him close. It looked as if he’d give Steve a hug at first, but once he had Steve close enough, James looked into his eyes and whispered seriously, “Remember that I know a lot of people, Captain. I can make anyone disappear, even a national icon.” He smiled at Steve and continued in a more normal tone of voice, “It was a pleasure seeing you today Steve. Do let me know how everything goes.”
“They reminded me of you, Shellhead,” Steve answered using his shield to aim one of Tony’s repulsors at a bot coming at them.
There was also a picture taken from a CCTV camera during a fight. It was Captain America jumping over a car, a bouquet of roses on fire held in one hand.
“Why not? It’s what I’m doing and you already said no to courting.”
“You both are terrible as best friends,” Steve said while getting up from the table, glaring at the ceiling and at Bucky.
“Fucky you too, Barton,” Bucky said with a smile while Steve just frowned and looked up at the ceiling.
“Um,” he heard Tony begin and Steve’s heart sped up. “Captain? Where’s your All American ass right now? The team is busy with their own batch of bots and another one of my repulsors is out. Hiding behind a car is not my style but it will take me a few minutes to fix it. I need support like five minutes ago!”
He was running towards the action when Tony asked if he was already on the comms. Responding in the affirmative, he pushed himself to run faster.
“I am serious about him. I just want to make him happy,” Steve said. He thought the conversation was going well, it sounded like there were no objections from James at least. And since he was Tony’s best friend, Steve decided to just ask. “How do I make him see that?”
When there weren’t that many bots around, he saw Tony’s hair behind a car and why would he not be wearing his helmet? He was going to have a heart attack. Loving Stark was not good for his health.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hand and squeezed it, looking up at Steve with a soft smile - Steve had never seen that smile from Tony and it was that which made him remember James’ words: He won’t get it unless you spell it out for him. And Steve hadn’t done that. He’d just asked Tony if he wanted to go out to lunch - something they did often. Steve didn’t call it a date, he didn't make it clear that he was interested in more than friendship.
“They are fucking beautiful Stark,” Clint said over the coms, taking pity on their Captain. “Be a good boy and say thank you for such a thoughtful gift Steve.”
He ran past a flower shop with a display of the most beautiful red roses he had ever seen and wondered if they would be there after they took care of the trouble.
Tony threw himself into the research with everything he had. Even his trustworthy AI J.A.R.V.I.S. was tasked with searching the internet for anything that might help them.
“It seems Doctor Doom has unleashed a new version of his bots. They are currently attacking the Baxter Building but Dr Richards and his team are out of the country.”
Clint did, however, share Best Man duties with Bucky. Steve challenged them to a Snipe-Out for the honor. Clint still maintained that Bucky cheated on the last shot (he did), while Bucky swore that Clint sneezed on purpose (he did).
He was looking for a pencil in one of Tony’s drawers when he found some of the notes he left in Tony’s lunches sometimes.
“Excuse me?” James said, sitting up straighter on his chair. “I don’t think I caught that.”
“I want to date him. I want to date him and give him the world.”
“Looking good capsicle,” Tony said when he walked into the room. Tony was now wearing one of his AC/DC shirts and jeans as well.
“Come on Cap! I was just pollen your leg. It’s nice to see a blossomin’ romance between my two buds.”
Ok, he could do that. He could compliment Tony. He’s a smart, good looking, generous man. There was always something to compliment him on. This was easy. He could do it.
“Oh for fucks sake Stark, just take the god damn compliment,” Steve huffed and walked out of the room, leaving behind a confused Tony.
“I apologized!” Clint said over the sound of scraping metal.
Steve watched Tony walk to the elevator from the landing pad, holding the roses close to his chest, and with a thoughtful look on his face.
“Well, Avengers assemble, I guess,” he murmured to himself.
“Yes. No! I mean, I want more than that.”
I wish I was the popsicle you were eating earlier.
Do you like flowers? I’d like to give you flowers one day.
There were little things that gave him hope though. He’d seen the roses drying upside down in the back room of the workshop last week, and he’d found an iron man sketch he’d given Tony framed.
“I didn’t think you drank coffee Cap,” Tony raised an eyebrow. Was he getting lessons from Nat?
That’s how Steve and Tony found out about the demon classes, and the demon tests, and the demon professors,and the demon finals that Bucky had failed three times already (which was NOT how they pictured hell).
“Damn right you were in the wrong. Tony can be difficult to get along with at first but inside that prickly pear exterior, there is a big squishy marshmallow.”
Steve and Bucky spent evenings cooking and prying Tony away from work and his research to spend some time together. And since they didn’t know how long their Cambion friend would stay, they also took him around New York - to touristy places, and to his old neighborhood to find if he could remember more of his human life.
“Where do you come from?” He asked Bucky.
“We need to talk,” Tony said one day, Steve next to him turning different shades of red. “Bucky, we care, maybe even more than care, about you and we feel like there’s more to this friendship. We’d like to date you.”
Making a last minute decision, Steve ran in, dropped a couple of hundreds on the attendant’s hand and grabbed the bouquet. They smelled amazing. He figured he’d stash them somewhere safe and come back for them after the battle.
“Your coffee is always very good, Tony,” there that was easy and safe.
“What kind of name is Bucky?” He asked, and received an elbow to the ribs from Steve and a flat look from Bucky.
Except, it wasn’t easy and he couldn’t do it. He tried but based on the look Tony gave him when he told DUM-E he was as smart as his dad... well, Steve might need help with that.
“You want to tap that,” James cut him off, finally taking pity on him and smiling.
“Do you have another concussion?”
“Think of it like DoorDash for supernatural creatures if it works,” he told Steve.
“Yes, he does. And I’ve tried showing him I’m interested but it doesn’t seem to work. I don’t know what else to do.”
“Wooing? Really, Cap?” Tony was now on his tip toes trying to reach his mug, which he found on the top shelf of a cabinet. Going by Clint’s shit eating grin, Steve could tell it had been placed there by him. “I could show you a thing or two.”
Somehow, after weeks of Clint strategically ensuring Tony and Steve always sat together, that became the norm, even without Clint’s intervention. Tony would come into the living room, look around and sit wherever Steve was. It didn’t matter whether or not there were other empty seats. There had been  that time when Tony actually sat on Steve’s outstretched legs and wiggled until Steve made some space for him.
“Who are you?” Tony asked.
“You have state of the art tech all around you Steve and you want a pencil? It’s like you’re trying to hurt me on purpose,” Tony had said as he handed him a pencil and closed the drawer for Steve.
“We agree on--”
“Your Iron Man suit fits you perfectly.”
“What I still don’t understand is why you used a stuffed toy if you wanted a fully-trained demon.”
“Really Tony? You’re ok with a demon here but you draw the—“
“Well, now I know you’re on the table, cap…” Tony said, raising one eyebrow suggestively. “But who’s the lucky fella?”
“I always appreciate the rides you give me.”
Tony just blinked slowly when Steve gave him the rose.
“Not holding out, just didn’t think you didn’t know?” Steve finished lamely.
"That appears to be the case," he said.
"I know how to be discreet." Tony let out a breath that he didn't know he'd been holding. Peggy got up, careful to keep Sharon balanced on her hip. "I should get back downstairs; Sharon's parents have to be wondering where she is by now. Are you going to go back to the party?" Tony shook his head.
"It's just two minutes," Drew said. "Just let me say what I need to say and then I'll go back to bed. I promise."
"The whole night."
"I'm really okay with needles," he assured. "I don't need you to hold my hand."
"No," the concierge said. "Come back with a badge and a search warrant." He then walked away, leaving Clint and Natasha standing there, frustrated. By that point, Bruce had caught up with Steve and the two of them started to approach.
"Is he okay?" Steve asked.
"Oh, wow!" Her eyes were wide, and her mouth hung open. Tony waited patiently for her to decide which question to ask first. "This is the thing that keeps you alive, right?" Good choice. Much better than the usual "does it hurt?"
Not even one whole hour had passed before Tony had broken the promise he had made to Lara. To be fair, it's not like he could help it. That little prank that Barton had pulled had scared the living daylights out of him. He could feel himself shaking a little bit. Besides, technically Tony had promised to lay off the sauce, not to abstain from drinking altogether. So, one drink to calm his nerves wasn't that big of a deal, right? Also, the early hour didn't matter as they were practically giving out mimosas' downstairs. He just had to finish it before Lara caught him. No big deal.
"Wait, wait, hold on." Tony was glad he got Steve's attention before he could finish that. "How is this now about me?" He heard the
"Not as of yet," Pepper said quickly. "Have you spoken with S.H.I.E.L.D.?"
"No, no," she said. "It's alright. You didn't hurt me. Are you okay?" Both of Lara's eyebrows shot up, almost reaching her hairline as she brought her gaze up to look at Pepper.
Now, some of you might remember that I mentioned in a different author's note I mentioned I was going to do a separate Rhodey and Tony fic while I was doing this one, but uh... It didn't work out that way. I realized I couldn't separate that story off from this one without leading to a lot of confusion and just for ease of convenience for me, I sort of worked it back into this story. So, just so you know we're going to be taking a bit of a detour in chapters forty-six and forty-seven of this fic, but remember I'm doing it for character purposes and I really hope it doesn't derail the plot too much.
"Why?" Steve asked. "What good is talking going to do?" Natasha tried to put a hand on his shoulder again – this time as a means of comfort – but he shrugged it off.
"You don't have the Tesseract yet," Loki pointed out. The Other hissed and jumped in front of Loki, coming to stop in a position that looked odd, but would probably allow the Other to kill him easier if he was in front of him and not just a psychic projection. Loki maintained a calm assuring expression. "I do not threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command you are but words." Loki felt a bit of smug satisfaction. He had been wanting to say something along those lines for quite some time. It didn't last, though.
be taken lightly."
"You would be right," Carol said. "I know I had a bit of an issue with alcohol before the explosion, but I did have it under control in the years directly before it. After the explosion… I went through a traumatic experience. I was violated in a way no one should ever be. On top of that, my powers started fluctuating. Sometimes they would work and sometimes they wouldn't. I felt useless and turned to alcohol to cope. That's when things started to get worse."
like that?" Steve sighed.
"Yes," he said. "I gave it to Betty." Lara's face dropped, but she seemed to relax a bit.
His eyes then drifted back over to Rhodey. There was a look of deep consideration on his friend's face that disappeared as soon as they made eye contact, being replaced by a form of resolve.
"Tony, please…"
"My best one." He pressed a kiss to Tony's temple.
"What the hell are you doing Stark?" he asked.
"Yeah," Clint said as he finished wiping off his hands.
He remembered she was a captain, Fury had introduced them, and that for whatever reason she had told him about her struggles with alcoholism. He was still mulling that over. Just everything she said had struck a chord with him. He wasn't sure what just yet, but he could feel something resonating within him. It was strange and he probably needed more time to properly think it over.
"You know," Tony said. "Stuff, things… In fact, Agent Romanoff, since you've been kind enough to scope out the rest of the house, why don't you check to make sure there are no 'unaccounted-for individuals' hiding in my basement?" Natasha raised an eyebrow.
"Miss Whittaker." The woman's face immediately fell, but she was able to maintain a polite smile. "Thank you for letting us in after hours."
"I just don't get this," she said. "Why does this all keep going back to them?"
"They targeted Congress and the media," Tony pointed out. "You – a no-name Secret Service agent who protected low-level diplomats – would have been safe."
Carol didn't hear the rest of his rant. Hear heart stopped and her blood ran cold the second she heard him say "Kree." All she could think was,
“There are some clothes by the sink, as well as your glasses and your hearing aid," he said softly, "When you're ready no rush."
The breath left him in a rush as the vivid pictures burned in his mind, the hot low thrum of arousal burned in his belly. Feeling bold he arched back rubbing against the hard body behind him. He could feel Tony catch his breath behind him, the arm on his waist tightening a little more.
He grunted, “Not over yet, could you keep him distracted until Friday?”
Still, he opened up the app, finding the original posters video and typing out a reply. Hiding his smile, he waited. Steve’s head was lolling again beside him Clint and Sam still scrolling when Clint saw it first.
“Mr. Stark, they’re saying this was caused by an SI employee, can you comment on this?”
“I’m sorry,” he breathed as he opened his eyes and looked out at the gorgeous view of the Alps.
“How does he do that?” Peter asked then.
Steve stepped towards him, gently nudging him back into the shower, “As long as I’m the thing.”
T’Challa clapped the big man on the back, "Come, Steve, I am thinking you have a story to tell."
His phone pinged drawing him from his thoughts, glancing down he saw Barton’s name. Curious he unlocked it.
Disappointed he felt his shoulders sag, “Friday, where’s Anthony?”
Tony smiled amused, “Try not to think?”
Anthony sighed looking down at his hands then, “It’s an agreement, contract, between two people before they get married. It’s to protect the assets of each party in the event the marriage terminates…” he trailed off squeezing his eyes closed.
Tony Stark. I can't believe you, Rogers…."
Steve nodded he could get there. He was going to be a little late, and he wasn’t Anthony, but maybe he could help the kid out. At least until Anthony could get there.
“I’ve never been to San Francisco,” Peter mused as Steve politely rapped at the door. They waited a moment before a young girl opened the door and looked at him in wide-eyed astonishment.
“Uh oh,” Steve muttered seconds before the building he was currently trying to vacate, gave up and come down on him.
He still felt heavy, weighted down, his joints ached, and he was hot. Turning he felt his metal arm pulling at his shoulder joint, irritated he pawed at it fingers feeling clumsy and thick. He knew there was a spot…he felt the small depression in the metal plating pressing it he felt the arms release falling away as he groaned in relief.
“A leggy blonde, or at least someone…I dunno more…”
“You weren’t kidding where you?”
“Rinse,” he ordered gently cupping the back of his head as Steve slid his big frame down rinsing out his hair. Tony careful to not let his face go under the water, supporting his neck as he rinsed the shampoo out.
Tony snorted, hastily wiping his messy face on his sleeve, “Pretty fucking far from ok love, you’ve been unconscious for a month and a half, we had no idea what was wrong, then Strange said it was ‘magic’ and he couldn’t do anything and - “
Fury blinked at him, unable to hide his surprise this time, he opened his mouth before he closed it again narrowing his eyes, “Why?”
Steve hummed gently holding him close, Tony leaned into him unbidden memories bubbled up from his youth. Somewhat painful awkward memories, he’d been fast-tracked through high school, starting MIT young. He'd missed out on this…all this… he heaved a sigh resting ahead on a wide shoulder.
Tony winced, “Fri, can you ask Buck to bring water and couple of shakes down.”
“Steve's expecting me, Pepper, we are going to Bora Bora…” Tony whined following his CEO rather reluctantly.
-#-#-#-
Steve shook his head, he didn’t really hold with magic, but to each their own.
“Nice to see you again Peter,” he greeted.
Steve growled, “Why?”
Recognizing the voice he stuck his head around the wall that was Sergeant Rogers, “Hi Colonel Rhodes.”
"It sounds like a rom-com; rich billionaire falls for gorgeous bartender.”
The trembling stopped, and he could almost hear Anthony thinking.
“About me?”
Steve said nothing but was secretly pleased when Buck elbowed the man in the side, “Shut up, It’s really nice, and thank you by the way, for bailing us out.”
Steve took a breath, his chest ached, his head ached, and he was so tired.
Tony turned to the screen, the other settling in to watch as well. The picture fuzzed for a  moment before Peter’s eager face appeared on the screen.
He paused frowning, “I own leather pants?”
He felt Anthony sigh against him, as he kissed the top of his hair, “What you thinking about?” he rumbled, feeling more than hearing the quiet chuckle.
“Of course.”
"Omg this one is just eggplant emoji's," Clint was showing his phone to Nat, the women grinning.
“Sargent Rogers, did you have reservations purposing to a man?”
“They want someone to blame, and Tony is an easy target," Natasha looked sad and pissed.
“So I…today that is, I was thinking, and I know I do too much of that, but hey that’s me.”
Tony nodded, “Fri?”
The god was jovial as he moved around the crowded space, passing out drinks. Peter was sandwiched on the couch with Korg playing
No, they hadn’t picked a date yet.
-#-#-#-
Bucky followed, Tasha in his arms, suitably impressed as he watched Peter and Steve move together.
“Would you like a tour of the lab Peter?”
“It’s ok,” he rasped.
Tony hummed this time understanding, he knew Steve had been struggling with the drawing, despite the incredible advancement they’d made with the fine motor skills on his arm, Steve had confided it didn’t feel right anymore.
His fiancée blinked at him, Steve let him work it out patiently staring at the far end of the workshop. He understood what Anthony was saying but he didn’t need to worry, he had faith this was the real thing, but he would never dream of taking Anthony’s money.
Only it did bother him.
“Not Steve, he’s fine as far as I know,” Rhodes assured him but Tony was already reading the current scroll of news.
“Where we headed?” Peter asked as he nimbly weaved through the people teeming down the busy New York streets.
Pepper nodded as she unshed him towards the jet, “I already have your spare bag on there, we need to get going. Call him once we’re underway.”
His fiancée looked about to say more when suddenly Buck was yelling for Iron Man and they remembered they were in the middle of a battle.
“It’s for Mr. Stark, we’ve been to San Francisco, and Space,” Peter looked so earnest she couldn’t help but giggle.
Tony thought about lying, about doing what he would have done once upon a time. Be flippant and bluster his way through. Only this wasn’t then, this was now, now with Steve who’d become so wrapped up in his life they shared everything, knew everything about each other…
Steve meanwhile was muttering softly. Tony thought it sounded like the Lord’s Prayer but wasn’t sure.
“Write him a poem,” the vents added. “Write about his ass, you stare at it enough.”
“Ok then, it’s a date,” Steve finally said and couldn’t stop the laugh that escaped him. He hadn’t felt this light or happy in a long time. He was going to do his damndest to make Tony feel the same way.
It all started the previous October when Tony and Steve were planning their first Halloween party together. They had been officially dating for two months after Steve decided they needed to have the DTR talk. They had been going out and having fun for a few months, but never got around to the conversation and Steve was honestly tired of trying to figure it out.
Pepper gave him a wide smile, “We have plans.”
He knew that voice, didn't he? But it was muffled and distant like he was underwater.
“Cool! Can we call it ‘Christmas Caper?”
Tony shifted closer, “Sounds great why don’t we get the snacks?”
"Spider-Man Sarg,”
“The Avengers! All of them, right here…and you space out on Tony Stark,
The room was brightly lit and decorated to the nines for Christmas, music played over the speakers, as a giant tree dominated the space…and that the room was filled with people.
"Mom and Dad are going?" The woman turned to Scott, punching him in the shoulder.
The reptile had him at eye level and Steve struck, burying the knife in the things beady black eye. It was not happy, roaring its displeasure, and coating Steve in saliva before flinging him away in pain.
-#-#-#-
It seemed somewhat familiar.
Sam crossed his arms, "Really?"
Wincing he mumbled an apology, before trying to go around him. Only the unknown figure caught his arm, holding him in place. Frowning he looked up at the man, trying to pull his arm away when suddenly pain exploded in the back of his head and darkness followed.
“Sam brought him flowers and everything,” Clint chimed in.
After Anthony had calmed down somewhat, the others had been notified, everyone spilling in to see him. Including a smug-looking Loki.
“Peter?” a voice rasped as the giant figure paused before him.
Surprised he looked at Steve, the big man happily sipping at his Shirley Temple looking ridiculous in that shirt.
He sped up a little still consciousness of his metal fingers buried deep in his lover, but Anthony was see-sawing between his abs and fingers as a steady stream of gabled nonsense fell from his lips. All at once Anthony was pulling away, sitting up he pressed himself more firmly onto his fingers and he ground down, riding them.
Just as the words left his mouth, there was a massive explosion behind them. Bucky actually jumped in surprise whipping around his jaw dropped in shock; the base was in flames.
Tony snorted that was putting it mildly, it had been an utter failure. It was supposed to be a huge contract, bringing green energy to the EU, it would have been monumental, and they’d balked at every turn. He’d tried everything he could think of but not a single thing actually helped. They’d actually turned him down…him, Tony Stark.
Peter shook his head, “What are you doing here Sergeant, I mean Sir I…” he trailed of thoroughly embarrassed now.
Tony rolled his eyes but was pleased to be heading home. Settling in the car he glanced at his phone trying to keep the pang of disappointment at bay. No missed messages.  He sighed pocketing the device staring out the window as they left the city behind.
Tony smiled, “Love you too Steven.”
Reaching out he knocked briskly, the door eventually answered by Wong.
He shook his head before turning back to them, "It's big on Earth, there's food and presents, and…it's just…" Quill turned to the big man, "We’ll be there!”
Thor frowned suspicious, “Why?”
Steve looked up at him chest tight as he watched the smaller man moan and wither, beg and plead. He was flushed with sex and his hair was a mess, but it was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.
Tony blinked at him over his hand, not sure what to do. Steve was giving him his sweet snarl smile, and Tony felt his own eyes crinkle in happiness. The big hand moved, “I love you Anthony, doesn’t matter what the press says. All that matters is what you say.”
Peter pulled his phone out trying to get a few pictures, half-listening to Sergeant Rogers and Colonel Rhodes as they spoke.
Tony watched pleased as those lips twitched, and big hands, one metal one flesh settled on his hips.  Tony moved a little closer, as they swayed gently to the old song, chuckling Tony rocked up on his toes mumbling softly in his boyfriend’s ear, “I listened to this in high school.”
“Better?”
Tony snorted, “You sound like Cap.”
Fury looked smug, he knew he had Steve, god the man was irritatingly perceptive.
“Morning beautiful,” Anthony called sitting before his tablet. Steve could see the bright lights of Shanghai behind him.
That dream again…that odd dream.
"We can't wait," he said adjusting the shield on his arm and gritting his teeth, beside him, Sam sighed and nodded as he prepared as well.
Drax was cackling like a mad man, while their target thrashed about, tentacles managing to smack Quill out of the air. Nebula yelled in rage.
Still moving carefully he added a third, Anthony’s cries running sweet heat down his spine.
“Sergeant Rogers, you’re here…in my apartment…” he managed blinking stupidly.
As soon as Anthony had hung up he was moving to his laptop, “What’s going on Friday?”
Surprised Steve looked up at him, feeling a little better to see the other man’s cheeks were a little rosy as well.
“Are you ok?” he asked realizing how stupid the question was, he could tell just by looking at him he wasn’t...
Bruce watched them go before heading back to Tony.
“Intel says a convoy rolled in three days ago, and no one’s left sense,” Sam all but yelled to be heard over the wind.
“Better?” Tony asked studying blue eyes, they had a little more light in them. Steve nodded jerkily, as Tony gently brushed matted hair from his face.
It had been a perfect day.
Relief crashed through him and Steve felt his lips pulling as he tried to smile, he was getting better at it. Anthony held out his left hand, the suit pulling back to reveal his trembling hand. Steve slipped the silicone band on, pressing a kiss to it before his fiancée was hauling him up and kissing him senseless.
Tony yawned shuffling into the room coffee in hand and work tucked under his arm. The only positive to Steve’s current comatose state was the amount of paperwork he'd plowed through for Pepper. He as actually ahead.
The man nodded, smiling at him, Steve losing himself in those intense eyes. There was something so familiar about him as if he knew the man…intimately.
“He sleeps with his eyes open sometimes too and that’s creepy,” Sam mumbled.
Tony paused against him, hesitating.
Steve hummed forehead wrinkling, “They told me that, who were they?”
Tony snapped his head up so fast, Steve winced for him.
Steve hummed kissing him then, happy when his lover relaxed into him, “You deserve all the good things.”
Tony shook his head, “Really?”
“Whose your friend White Wolf?” she glanced curiously, at Peter.
Thankfully they’d been able to stop it but not without collateral damage. Tony felt sick as he looked at the destroyed block, guilt already weighing heavily on his chest.
Shocked he scrambled off the bed running into the living room where Sergeant Rogers was indeed standing, looking far too big for space.
Steve knew to leave it for a bit before going down with a peace offering, coffee, and dinner would go a long way to helping him feel better. He was pretty sure he wasn’t the reason for the upset, his theory confirmed when the doors to the lab opened and he was allowed in.
He nodded and Anthony looked at the mangled half an arm he held in his hand, “Did a number on that, good thing we have a spare.”
“No it’s not alright, it’s all my fault I was being selfish and I didn’t even ask you…I just went ahead. I’m so sorry Steve.”
“I know it traditional to wait for the end of the date, but I’d really like to kiss you now…”
Tony knew the words to be the truth as he found himself collapsing shakily once more, helpless tears running from his eyes again as he clutched tight to the man that was center of his world.
Steve nodded he liked the sound of that.
And the food, there was food and punch and it had seemed worth it for that alone.
Steve cut him off with a big hand over his mouth, “It’s ok, I trust you.”
“Keep looking at me like that and I’m going to kiss you again.”
Carol shook her head as she watched them all disappear before she gave in a chuckle, she better get going if she was going to make it on time.
He had just finished replying when the phone went again, this time it was Sam.
He landed harder than normal stumbling and wincing as his head throbbed. Taking a moment, he breathed painfully through his nose, he closed his eyes, wishing he could just lay down right where he was and call it a day. Just contemplating the clean-up, they had to do, and the debrief… he wanted to cry.
Steve snorted, drawing a rattling breath, “Can’t see, my glasses.”
“Sir, Ma’am,”  he greeted politely, his voice a horse rasp, that had Hank wincing.
Anthony wasn’t here.
How could Pepper even think…even consider…
Tony glanced up at her, "Hmm?"
“Who?” She mumbled faintly still staring at one of the now numerous canvas that leaned around the walls of various sizes.
He glanced at her expectantly, but she shook her head slowly, “I wish I could Tones really, but I'm leaving for Geneva…remember? That green energy deal?”
Leading him back into the bedroom Tony helped him sit on the side of the bed, stepping between big legs he towelled his longer hair dry. A warm arm encircled his waist drawing him closer.
“Let me take a look at your head,” he said softly before those strong hands moved to his hair. He heard Tony hiss in sympathy, “Can you rinse?”
Still, he just felt, off.
Steve frowned, “No one else around?” he rasped, hesitant to answer, he was well aware of how off-putting he was.
Steve grunted turning in the others embrace so he lay facing the man, chest constricting when he saw the raw emotion in dark eyes.
Bucky could only follow helplessly as Steve lead them back towards the sounds of conflict, where Sam was holding off the reinforcements.
Laughing Tony leaned across the table grabbing his fiancée’s hand, “It must have been the shirt.”
Moaning softly he swam muzzily into consciousness blinking tender eyes.
“Sergeant Rogers, Parker,” he nodded to each of them, eyebrows lifting a little in curiosity.
“Don’t,” a familiar voice rasped behind him making him jump a foot in the air.
If it made him happy then that was what was important.
It was bad enough they’d had to deal with this ludicrous mess because some power-hungry scientist had wanted money, and they’d also missed out on all their plans; Steve he was not going to let them tear down the love of his life.
“Dr. Pym and Ms. Van Dyne, are coming,” Peter added.
Anthony turned to him frowning, “It’s a Christmas party love.”
“Less talking more shooting,” Gamora growled.
“I am Groot!”
The picture was short and sharp, he breathed through his nose, Tony was immediately worried.
“Dr. Pym was so nice, we totally read about his work in biology,” Peter didn’t even break stride.
Anthony was the first to stir, absently mumbling into his sweat-slick collar bone, "That was goddam amazing."
“Dinner,” he said softly, Anthony turned to face him, chest heaving, and sweat glistening on his brow.
Steve shrugged it really hadn’t been all that hard, Fury’s intelligence had given a basic location, and Steve had known there was a base there. He had been there before, he was sure of it…only he couldn’t remember the extent of it.
It was a big deal.
“Steve! Steve!” He could hear the frantic yells of Bucky.
“Maybe next year we’ll do a couple’s costume,” he mused aloud.
His phone vibrated on the table he looked down recognizing Pep’s number. Curious he answered glancing at his date, “Heya Pep.”
"Hello, again gorgeous.”
“They’re going to love you, they’ve been harassing me to meet you for a while.”
He heard an almost collective intake of breath from both the reporters and the others. Anthony started down at him jaw working, and Steve was beginning to feel those lingering doubts beginning to surface. What if Anthony didn’t want to marry him?
Steve grunted, “We would like you to come.”
Steve did, watching attentively as Anthony grabbed the lube from the bedside table, with a wicked smile he was back, kissing a trail across his abdomen before once more lavishing attention where Steve wanted it the most. Huffing he did his best to stand still, his restraint sorely tested as Anthony flicked open the lube, smearing his fingers before his hand moved behind him, beginning to work himself open.
“Peter asked if I’d chaperone his Halloween dance…ages ago, but I’m not sure why Steve went.”
“How was the rest of your shift?”
“As if you’ve already got over a thousand likes,” Sam shook his head.
“Dr. Pym, there’s a rather large man and a teenager to see you.”
Tony closed his eyes breath still hitching faintly, he felt weak, dizzy, he wanted to melt into the broad chest of his lover. He gave a soft grunt as Steve pulled him closer settling back into the bed tucking Tony into his side.
“Tones, we’re here.”
Steve gave a horse wheezy bark of laughter, “You did.”
"Thanks again Mr. Rogers, oh and it is a costume party, but Mr. Stark totally doesn’t need a costume. Thanks again, bye!”
“Bath?” he asked gently, and Steve nodded slowly. Tony helped him, guiding him out of bed and towards the bathroom. Friday already had the water running, Tony dumping in some sweet-smelling bubbles as he helped Steve to strip out of his underwear steadying his big fiancée as he stepped into the huge bath.
Moving easy, slowly, he coaxed Steve upright, grabbing a water bottle and holding it to his lips. CC moving to the side meowing plaintively up at them. Steve drank slowly, then greedily draining the bottle.
Steve nodded, “I think I’m happy with it,” he deadpanned.
Shouldering his rifle Steve kept moving. As he passed Sam he gave them man a gentle nudge closing the distance between the two. He heard Buck give a muffled squeak, glancing back to see Sam cupping Buck’s cheek tenderly as he deepened the kiss a muffled moan echoing in his earpiece.
“God you feel so good,” Tony whimpered before he shifted his hips, eyes open but unseeing as his mouth fell open and he moved again.
“But Steve it’s Christmas,” he said as if that explained everything, as he squirmed in his lap until he was straddling it. Steve felt the roughed palms of his lover cupping his face, as dark eyes looked at him intent.
He knew Buck was struggling, he didn’t want to admit it, often deflecting when Steve brought it up, not that he pushed, Steve knew he was the last person to confront anyone about their issues. He had found his therapy very helpful, and wished Bucky could get past his own antiqued sensibilities and embrace the 21
Steve took his hand over the table, “Just thinking you’re my fiancée,” he told him.
"Steve," he breathed feeling a throb in his chest, and heat behind his eyes, “You did…all this?” he gestured around trying not to let the quaver in his voice through.
Steve thought about it a moment, “Summer,” he decided, he liked the warmth.
Tony hummed and Steve felt warm hands pulling his pants away, leaving him naked and exposed. Instinctively he tried to curl in on himself, hide his skinny form. He felt warm kisses press to his knees and he peeked around his fingers, Tony smiling at him softly, eyes warm and full. Steve relaxed a little letting his legs fall apart as Tony settled between them, kissing up his inner thigh.
Anthony grunted, “Feel like death warmed over.”
“Of course Boss,” Friday replied.
“Doctor Strange?” Peter bumped into his back as Steve stopped staring up at the structure.
Steve nodded, looking away again before he took a breath, “Steve.”
-#-#-#-
-#-#-#-
Steve frowned, “A little,” he admitted.
Tony laughed.
Steve hummed in agreement, “I was kidnapped as well.”
“Go,” Steve rasped and Anthony nodded before he was up and off heading back towards the conflict.
Tony yawned, eyeing the snow outside the car window lazily. It was a nice night for staying in and cuddling on the couch he mused before checking his phone, Happy navigating them through rush hour traffic. Maybe they could get Italian tonight, he had a craving for chicken parm.
Steve pressed a kiss to his boyfriend's temple, he knew his mind wasn't what it'd once been but it didn't take a rocket scientist to understand. If it’s what Tony wanted, then that was more than fine with him.
“I am Groot,” Rocket nodded in agreement with his assessment.
“This your man Stark?” A shorter blonde man glanced back at them curiously.
“Sir, Mr. Stark?” The voice of the teen echoed softly in the empty kitchen.
-#-#-#-
“What the hell are you guys even doing here?” Quill holstered his lasers staring between the two.
“Where you go, I go, love," he rasped against Anthony's lips.
“It is,” Wanda sighed content, leaning her head on his shoulder as they moved through the crowed streets. She had been a little hesitant when Vis had asked her to go to Louisiana with him, but now she was glad she had. It was nice to get away from the bustle of the compound for a while.
By noon Tony was trying to decide between an exclusive island in Fiji or in Bora Bora.
Steve grunted nodding as they followed the flow of people out of the gym and into the night. Tony hung back a little watching his leather-clad lover walk away from him, those pants were doing everything for him. God lord the man was pure sex.
“That’s sweet, Steve brought me flowers in 1945.”
Tony stopped listening, trying to wrap his mind around what was happening
“Feel so good, do tight, Christ I can feel you…feel me in you,” a strong hand pressed down on his stomach and Steve was done. With a quiet whimper he fell, his orgasm hot and hard as he shot all over his own belly and Tony’s hand.
“I lo-“
Tony felt bad his jaw-dropping open, he tried to recover his shock.
“The Winter Soldier is inviting you to a Christmas party and you’re declining?" The woman was glaring at him in disbelief.
“Steve? What the hell?”
Curious Tony waited watching, Steve looked neutral, as the young girl approached. Bright blue eyes watching her, and Tony hid a smile, Steve was not confident around children. He could fight with aliens literarily one-handed, but Tony knew this child had him terrified.
“I feel off…” he mumbled frowning at the wide, warm, muscular chest before his eyes, not able to meet intense blue eyes.
If Peter could melt, Steve was pretty sure the kid did.
Jim texted again.
Steve was more than content to spend the day in bed, admittedly it had been a rather long week.
Ducking his head Steve easily captured his lips, kissing Anthony sweetly. It was soft and chaste to start but soon turned heated and messy. Anthony wrapping his arms around his neck, Steve easily taking his weight. Lips and tongues duelling, Steve smoothed his hands down the slender man's sides, moving to his hips he easily lifted the smaller man feeling Anthony wrap his legs around his waist.
It was honestly the most fun he’d had in a long time.
“God Steve,” his boyfriend breathed before the irritating ping came again. Growling Anthony smacked at his phone when it sounded a few more times.
-#-#-#-
Anthony ground down once more as his body spasmed in pleasure, pulling Steve right along with him. With a grunt he was spilling inside, his orgasm hitting him with sweet surrender.
Steve winced, Tony radiated anger, he thought to move away but he was still in Tony’s arms and he was being carried away. The blurry scenery around him made him think, they were back in the tower headed to Tony’s penthouse.
It was nonsense but Steve loved it, when those words fell from his lips, loved it when Tony praised him, encouraged and begged him to keep going.
Suddenly they weren’t alone, a large figure materialized out of the tree line, powerful arms grabbing one of the tentacles as it lashed out. Rocket only glanced at the newcomers a moment before he turned his attention back to the fight.
His voice had taken on a distinctly husky rasp, and Steve leaned forward closer to the screen.
“What?” Bucky grunted.
“Oh honey,” Tony groaned in his ear, and Steve moved again, the burn had faded, and a sweet ache was back. He wanted more…he was moving in earnest than his flagging erection reawakening.
Tony was kind and sweet….and so very easy to fall for.
“You could have,” Sergeant Rogers, pointed out.
Getting married was supposed to be happy, so why did he feel like garbage?
He could hear the other scrambling in his ear trying to reach him, but unfortunately, there were more than one of these bastard lizards running around and it was only he, Steve, Sam, and Anthony.
Cursing Bucky fired off his shield, but it was too late a large group of heavily armed men were bearing down on them.
Anthony moaned around him, sending a shiver down his spine, as he wiggled against his fingers. It was a gorgeous sight, one that Steve would never get tired of watching.
“Turkey is beautiful, not the traditional honeymoon spot,” Natasha offered.
He did like the music though.
There was a heavy sigh before, “Alright he’s not exactly what I pictured.”
They paused before one of his larger canvases, a riot of reds, golds, and an intriguing movement of blue throughout.
The room was decorated with big pine trees, that glowed with twinkling white lights, stings of multi-coloured lights were strung from the ceiling, red bows and evergreen branches decorating the space. Something painful skittered across his mind, he was forgetting something. He frowned, looking down at his hands.
“Mr. Parker is calling,” the lightly accented voice replied. Steve wracked his spotty memory for the name.
The name echoed in his head, a horse rasp, the voice unfamiliar. Steve blinked limbs trembling again, what was going on?
“I need information,” Steve began bluntly, he really didn’t have time for diplomacy.
Tony hummed nuzzling closer, he wasn’t sure why he felt off…but Steve made it better.
Peter stared at him, “Chicken please,” Sergeant Rogers replied and Peter found his head bobbing in agreement to stunned to say anything else. The waiter bustled off, and Colonel Rhodes was levelling an amused look at them.
Anthony snuggled closer, “Oh yeah?” He mumbled faintly.
“Remember when you forgave me?” Steve said seconds before he closed the distance kissing his husband soundly, surrounded by family and friends they celebrated an ending, and Steve hoped…a new beginning.
-#-#-#-
“I know you,” he squinted up at the big man a grin splitting his features.
“You ok Steve?” Tony was frowning at him in concern, nodding Steve pushed the pictures away. He was seeing more of them…coming with more frequency of late. He still had no idea what they were, it was if he was seeing another life.
“You deserve it, Stevie.”
Steve nodded unconsciously licking his lips as strong hands moved to the waistband of the pants. Clever fingers undoing the button and fly, pushing them just far enough down his hips for his erection to spring free.
Peter hid his smile while Colonel Rhodes doubled over in laughter
“Oh he will…or we’ll give you back to him; in pieces.”
It was fairly amusing to see his best friend founder, he’d had vague memories of Buck being a bit of a lady killer in his day. He didn't recall there being men, but his memory was so poor he didn't even trust himself to remember to brush his teeth. He thought they were good together though, Sam was a sweet man, he all but worshiped Bucky; more than that he
-#-#-#-
“It’s ok, sleep sweetheart…”
Tony tried to backpedal within the confided space but the young man was reaching for him. With no alternative, Tony expertly caught his wrist and with little effort twisted the man’s arm back while moving behind him. Not enough to injure, but enough to be uncomfortable.
“Yes!”
He ducked his head not sure why he was embarrassed, “Now.”
Tony melted immediately, groaning softly as he gave himself over to the tender ministrations. Steve’s strong capable fingers worked across his head, hitting all the tender points. Smoothing across his forehead and working around the back. Tony was floating, his entire being focusing on those magic fingers as they turned him into a pile of mush.
Steve nodded, and Peter gave an excited yell, “I’m starving.”
“That’s the Winter Soldier!” Ned all but yelled.
-#-#-#-
“Let’s get you someplace warm,” he rasped heading towards the tower. Hoping that perhaps Anthony would let him keep the little kitten.
“Wrong..” he gasped.
His mouth was heaven, and it had been a while…he felt a familiar warmth pooling in his groin, a delicious tension building. Gently he moved his hand to tap Anthony on the shoulder, a warning he was already close. Anthony hummed taking him deeper, hand moving to work what he couldn’t swallow.
“Yeah, you know kids getting candy, costumes, tricks, horror movies, all that sort of stuff,” Sam explained as he swooped by, ugly black critters hanging off his wings. Steve sited down his rifle picking them off with precise shots.
“Don’t worry though we won’t hurt you…as long as your boyfriend pays up.”
and he'd wanted to see that one.
Tony couldn’t seem to get the smile to leave his face. It had been a spectacular night, a Christmas he was never going to forget. One that he never wanted too. Everyone had been relaying their stories of what had happed, Peter and Steve had certainly pulled everything off in dramatic fashion. They’d been all over the world…and outside of it.
One young girl hanging back from the group caught his eye. Tony paused, watching curiously as she carefully detached from the group moving to stand before Steve. The other kids still giving him a bit of cautious space.
It had been a fairly routine fight and one that may or may not have been inadvertently caused by Thor. Not that Steve was going to complain, it was better than the moping he was doing around the compound. Bucky had been teasing him mercilessly about it, ever since Anthony had left on SI business, and he’d been dragging.
“Anthony?” he looked up seeing his lover appear around the conference room door.
Steve stiffed a yawn as he opened the fridge in search of food, he felt better after a long hot shower. Although he did wish Anthony was back, he knew how he and Strange would often get left to their own devices. Steve knew Anthony didn’t hold with magic, but he did like Strange.
Blinking he drew a sharp breath as the picture burst painfully across his mind.
“It is, won’t keep you, enjoy your night.”
He glanced up at his coworker breezed into the kitchen looking wistful. Steve frowned, Tony was here?
He wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that, but Tony thought perhaps he dozed a while when he came back to himself the movements had stopped and he was resting comfortably in his fiancée’s lap.
Briskly he strode off, Peter hurrying after him, the kid's head was whipping around so fast it made Steve’s neck ache in sympathy.
“I mean I know Steve wouldn’t…you know…” Tony sighed looking down at the table, idly playing with his silverware.
His smaller lover pulled back a moment, and Steve saw his eyes glassy with unshed tears as he offered him a watery smile. “You sure?” he whispered, still holding tight to his neck as they rested their foreheads together.
“How is everything?” Buck appeared before them, looking pleased, flushed and happy Sam at his side.
His boyfriend was apparently not willing to be soothed as Steve soon found himself with a lap full of upset Anthony Stark.
Steve hummed pressing a kiss to his temple, shifting Anthony’s weight in his embrace.
The girl apparently named Cassie was looking at him with stars in her eyes.
-#-#-#-
“Incoming,” Natasha jumped in and the teasing was pushed aside as they focused on the fight. At least Tony tried his best to focus, but he was damn glad the suit all but operated itself. He just hung grimly on as he fought back another wave of nausea.
“What’s going on love?” He asked coming up and leaning against his back curiously.
Tony nodded drifting lightly before he woke with a start, “NO!” he bellowed scrambling upright and grabbing at Steve mindlessly, “No don’t leave me again.”
“Rogers, I need you to stay late, Rose didn’t show for her shift. I’ll need you to work the bar tonight.”
Tony hid his grin against the warm neck feeing the pleasant rasp of Steve’s stubble. He knew Steve was right he was overthinking, leaning back he found those lips that turned his mind to mush allowing Steve to carry him to bed.
“What? What’s wrong? Where’s Steve?” Anthony joined him in his panic.
He woke with a throbbing headache.
“Well Doctor Strange took us here, and we’ve been looking for you for a while and we saw aliens, and there was this weird guy and-”
The man was leaning forward again smiling at him softly, “Join me for a drink?”
“I’m here you’re ok, I’m going to get you out and we’re going home.”
Tony smiled gently, “I want a copy of that,” he told here. Tasha winked.
Steve tried to work through the muffled words, “My boyfriend?”
He rolled his eyes before he lifted his head to look at his Aunt May  frowning at him from the doorway.
Floating sweetly on endorphins he turned reaching for Steve’s waistband on his sweats when those big hands stalled him out.
At the thought, Steve pulled him closer tucking him against him as he ate, the others white noise around them as he focused on the warm press of his husband at his side.
Swallowing down the hurt he tried to smile, “I thought everyone was busy?” he blustered crossing his arms and arching a brow.
Anthony cocked his head to the side, squinting at him, before a wicked gleam crept into his eyes,  “I’d still sleep with you.”
“No problem kid,” he glanced at his boyfriend, the big man was nodding, and Tony couldn’t help the sweet swell of love for the man; Steve was incredible.
“I am Groot.”
Rocket warily looked them over catching a glint of a metal arm and he remembered; Winter Solider.
“It’s really ok Anthony," Steve tried to assure the pacing man.
“Sorry, what did you say?” He rasped.
Tony surrendered leaning into the strong chest, “We’ll that’s true.” He felt a rumbled in the wide chest under his ear. Before soft lips dipped pressing a kiss to his jaw before moving lower.
“What can I do for you gentlemen?” Strange asked not even looking up from his book.
Another finger slide into him stretching him, filling him, the burn was sweet and he ached for more. His arms shook with the effort to keep him up, his knees aching, but the fingers were pulling out of him, "Tony…" he moaned lifting his hips higher.
He’d already been to six jewellers with no success. Steve had done the research online, meticulously, but he had needed more information so he’d decided to do some recon. Unfortunately, it had not been as helpful as he’d hoped. He would have asked for assistance from the others, but he'd wanted to do this himself. He also wanted it to be a surprise and honestly, they were the worse gossips.
“Because when was the last time you broke Twitter with the way you looked?” Rhodes innocently sipped his beer and Tony frowned at him, he knew damn well.... never. Sure, he had a lot of followers, and always got a lot of retweets but he’d never the sort of attention Steve seemed to be getting. Rhodey’s words found their mark; he couldn’t help the sudden unease in his chest.
“Steve, did you break the internet again?”
Done with this, he nodded to the shop assistant before heading to the change room, movements lacking his usual lustre. Grumbling he was shrugging out of the shirt and pants, standing in his boxer briefs he carefully put the clothing back on the hanger before turning to get dressed.
Steve looked up at the greeting, meeting intense dark eyes.  Surprised he stared back incredulous, he had honestly not excepted to ever see Tony Stark again. Yet here he was leaning on one arm on the bar, looking perfectly dishevelled in a suit that Steve was sure cost more than his shitty apartment.
Sipping his coffee he leaned into his boyfriend content to just be, he glanced at the others before turning back to Tony, dark hair tousled about his head, snug white tee, and dark sweats, haloed in the morning light. It was comfortable and homey…domestic…a sudden thought intruded, tender and desperate could he really have this?
Peter was belting it out and Steve was bopping along to the music as flew the jet, a small smile about his lips. The video faded out again to another round of photos that had the occupants of the room laughing as they recognized themselves, Tony glaring at Bruce when he saw the photo of the three of them.
Steve pressed sloppy uncoordinated kisses to Tony’s neck, he could feel the desperation in his movements, his whole body thrummed with tension, with a breathy moan he bit at the straining muscle in his sweat-slick neck. Tony swore pulling him down as he thrust deep the tension in his body going slack as he came.
“I have to see this,” Sam was hurriedly pulling out his phone, as was Clint.
Anthony was pulling back with a gasp, pressing a kiss to his lower abdomen before he scooted back on the bed, “Stay right there,” he panted.
“No,” he mumbled.
Something nagged at the back of his mind as he watched the women clad in a flowing dark dress and cloak, surrounded by the black creatures.
“Awesome…” Peter breathed beside him, eyes wide as he watched the man.
“Was that an invitation or a threat?”
“S-Steve?” He stuttered sure he was hallucinating, his hopeful mind playing a cruel trick on him.
"Nice to meet you, Steve Rogers, I'm Tony Stark."
"Small?" Steve asked curiously, he didn't mind having a big wedding if it was what Anthony wanted, but he got the feeling that wasn’t the case. Anthony liked to put on a show for the media, but when it came to himself he was a very private person.
They were still grinning as the food arrived and Steve realized he was suddenly ravenous. Before they ate he lifted his fiancée left hand placing a kiss to the ring there. Loving the small flush that crossed the other's cheeks.
He couldn’t help the words falling from his lips rapid-fire, was he actually going on the mission with the Winter Soldier?
“Stevie what are you doing?” Buck called, looing concerned.
Tony grinned at him, eyes crinkling as he shifted a little closer, “Hand to God, your gorgeous, but more than that…” he trailed off, and Steve met dark eyes as a rough palm cupped his face, Steve shivering as a callused thumb smoothed across his cheek, breath caught again and his heart hammered so hard he was worried he was going to pass out.
Strange finally looked up at him, eyebrows raised in shock, “You joking?”
Tony reared back, “Steve love, it was ridiculous, I was at the fitting for the suits and the kid barged in I sto-”
Tony made an irritated noise, "Some low-level goons, hoping for a quick buck they never would have got within feet of you if you hadn’t….” he trailed off but Steve knew.
He could picture it in his head, could see it so vividly in his mind it made his chest ache. He wanted it so much…but…
Despite his appearance, Bruce didn't think he'd ever met a sweeter man than Steve Rogers.
“What is this place Sergeant?” He whispered.
“Good luck, guys.”
Tony was gathering him close, soothing him, “You’re ok….you’ll be ok.”
Tony hummed moving his mouth lower down his neck, sucking a bruise that wouldn’t last on his throat.
“I’m a snack then?” Steve rasped raising a brow, pleased when he sputtered face turning red.
Sam and Bucky blinked, “What’s going on?” Cap mumbled.
Steve worked his way out of the rubble trying to get his balance without his arm, the lack of weight always threw him off for a while. Getting his barring’s though he was hurrying back towards the fight, slinging his rifle on his back he went. He could fire it without his left hand but he still had his guns and knives; he wasn’t out yet.
“No party?” He asked, confused.
“Anthony,” Steve greeted in his usual raspy husk.
“Peter,” he rasped quietly, he’d promised to tell Anthony and he’d completely forgotten.
Pepper was moving then, examining the work up close, “Tony these are brilliant,” she breathed.
Only as he spotted Tony waiting for him just outside of the pub, he was suddenly self-conscious about what he was wearing, and very much aware of his skinny, awkward self.
"Hey sweetheart, are you ok?" Anthony was before him, hands gently taking his own tangling their fingers together.
She shook her head, “Trouble?” she asked with a frown.
Tony frowned, “Steve love?”
“Shit Steve I’m coming!” Anthony was yelling in his ear as the grip of the thing tightened squeezing the air out of him. Grunting he ripped his metal arm free, pulling out one of his knives as the ugly thing raised him close to his face.
He recognized the youth beside him, eyes wide in amazement.
Ned was still staring in open-mouthed shock, Peter nudged him, his friend snapping it shut before he turned running back into the dance. Peter shook his head,  “Sorry about that, would you like to come in have a snack?”
It was fine, totally fine he'd see him, Christmas Eve, they'd have a nice quiet night together, and then they'd be off on a much-needed vacation somewhere warm.
He was gone then moving with incredible speed, “Here Sergeant!”
“Was that when we were having breakfast?” He accused the man.
“Yes!” he yelled, loud enough to draw the attention of the other patrons in the dining room.
"Steve Rogers and Peter Parker."
Turning his attention back to Steve he pressed a kiss to his forehead, keeping his voice as even and composed as he could, “You’re ok love, you’re ok, you’re safe, safe and sound.”
Steve frowned and nodded, “I don’t remember being like that but perhaps it’s still in my head somewhere?”
“I am Groot?”
“What is?” Pepper asked looking up from her papers.
Tony’s heart ached, this was part of it as well. Steve apologizing and guilty when he had an episode.
“Ok, I’ll be Captain America and you can be Falcon,” Steve rasped back loud enough for his voice to carry.
Tony had gone all out as well, had got them tickets to see some new play on Broadway, just like their first date. He’d also found a new place to eat so exclusive that he’d even had problems getting a table. Yes, it was going to be a perfect night.
“Honeymoon,” Tony, Bucky, and Rhodes all answered in unison and Steve found himself giving a wheezy laugh.
“Tony…” he heard Cap from somewhere above him.
Tony nearly choked on his drink staring at the back of the unknown person’s head. This whole night seemed rather surreal. Everyone was in love with Steve's work, the gallery owner had been beside herself pulling Steve all over to meet apparently, anyone whose anyone in the New York art scene.
They hadn’t had a call, he’d gone to work that day, been productive, they’d even made the final decisions on wedding flowers, food, and the guest list. It hadn’t been a bad day. It hadn’t been a good day. It had just been a day.
The moment was quiet and safe as they settled into it. Steve let his mind drift a little, still sorting through the odd overlapping thoughts he was having.
“What are you talking about?” Clint grunted his interjection.
Yes, he’d been surprised.
Steve smiled at him then, all snarled sweetness, he still hadn’t got the smiling down but Tony didn’t care. He kissed him slow and sweet.
Grumbling he decided to call it a day, Anthony would be back from work soon, they were staying in the tower tonight instead of heading back to the compound. He could heat his bean bag for his shoulder, maybe order in…
Moving out of the bathroom he entered into the bedroom spotting Tony seated on the bed tablet in hand.
Then a disgruntled SI employee had decided to turn supervillain and tried to blow half the city, completely ruining his day.
Steve nodded following Tony into the massive kitchen, amazed at the size of it. It was bigger than his entire apartment.
He heard her sigh as she headed out before directing his concentration back to party planning. He needed to up his decoration game at the compound for sure, maybe he could find a way to freeze the lake so they could skate…
Steve nodded to each of them, “Very nice to meet you,” Captain America shook his hand and Steve tried not to wince; the man had a hell of a grip.
“Someone pursued us otherwise,” Barton called an arm around Laura.
“We could move here, I can work part-time at SI and you can paint, take the West Coast art scene by storm.”
“Steve, love everything ok?” Anthony was panting lightly, and he could hear the faint sounds of explosions over the link. They were still fighting and he sitting nude in a Starbucks.
, Natasha was dozing in the easy chair wrapped in blankets, while he, Sam, and Buck sat at the small kitchen table. Steve briskly laid out the chain of events that had to lead them to the HYDRA base, as well as their current circumstances.
"Barkeep! Your finest mead!"  A large blonde thundered banging a massive fist on the bar, Steve stared at him, raising an eyebrow.
Steve furrowed his brow, they fought today but he couldn't recall having done anything notable. He'd kept all his clothing on. Honestly, it had all been rather boring.
Steve caught him hauling him close and Tony buried his face in his neck all the emotion he’d been feeling the last month and a half tumbling out as he wept into his husband's neck unable to form coherent thoughts.
“Ready? “
“To Tony and Steve, the two best friends…” James Barnes trailed off, voice quivering as he blinked rapidly.
Steve dozed on the couch, eyes half-lidded as a movie played quietly on the screen. Content he glanced to his dozing boyfriend propped up against the other end of the couch, tablet falling from slack hands, and a small black cat curled in his lap purring for all he was worth.
Peter opened his mouth the argue that he was a big boy and he’d be fine, but a loud knock stalled out his words.
“Spider Kid?” he guessed, having a vague recollection of Anthony talking about the young hero.
At least tonight they didn’t have far to go, stepping onto the Tower elevator he pressed the button for the main floors. Beside him, Anthony was tugging on a red and white hat. Steve frowned, something about the hat…
"That's ok," Steve replied, Tony, frowned it was hard to tell sometimes what sort of emotion Steve was feeling simply from his tone. With his ruined vocal cords it was often just a husky rasp.
Natasha groaned again slumping into him, Bucky gave up sweeping her into his arms as he glanced at Peter, “Go give Stevie a hand would ya?”
“Afterwards, Iron Man and Captain America stayed behind to sign autographs and take photos with some of the spectators.”
“Not today,” he rasped softly knowing Friday would pass on the message.
Anthony smiled then closing his eyes with a sigh, “I don’t deserve you.”
Steve just nodded in acknowledgement.
-#-#-#-
A small noise off to his right derailed his train of thought. Frowning he turned listening; silence. The snow continued to drift almost lazily, and Steve heard nothing else. About to dismiss it as something conjured up by his broken brain he turned to head back when he heard it again.
The young man looked like he was about to faint.
“Yup, look up ‘#WinterCowboy’.”
Bucky was pleased to see Sam looked just as shocked as he felt.
"Holy jeez I know you from my textbook!"
“Yes ma’am, I wanted to invite you to the Christmas Eve party at the compound on Friday.”
Tony looked back at it trying, really trying, but he wasn’t an artist. Didn’t really understand art, he appreciated the old masters, but the abstract…he didn’t get.
Steve shrugged, snagging shrimp screw next and offering one to Anthony.
"Thought I'd come by and see about that drink I missed out on last night," he was smiling at him, a sweet curl of his lips that made something hot and indefinable bloom in Steve's chest.
Steve couldn’t help the small smile that curled his lips, “Sure.”
“I got it,” he assured him hurrying towards their room, all the while cursing himself, he should have known. He’d been so stupid, he missed all the signs. He hadn’t checked in, he always checked in with Steve throughout the day. He’d just been so busy he hadn’t even realized, then Steve hadn’t shown to their cake tasting appointment, and he’d known something was wrong.
As if summoned his computer chimed with an email from Fury, it was short and brisk, directly to the point. He wasn’t coming, they were swamped, Natasha was already out and he hadn’t heard from her in a week.
Steve nodded slowly, masking his own unease, it wasn’t every day you meet superheroes after all.
“No boss, but you better take a look at this,” Friday explained as one of the screens in the workshop flickered to life, bringing up the news.
“Hey!” Tony yelled at the man indigent on Steve’s behalf.
Big shoulders lifted, “I’m sorry it’s me, Anthony is busy…” he trailed off awkwardly.
“Wow he actually came…” he glanced at Peter, the young man had stars in his eyes. Steve couldn’t blame him, he often felt that way around Anthony.
Steve picked his tray back up, stacking the dirty dishes on it as he cleaned off the table moving to return them to the back. Depositing the try he wiped his hands on his apron before returning to the front and moving behind the bar. He knew the after-work crowd would soon show for happy hour, looking for overpriced cocktails.
100% done, all he wanted to do was hide from the world for a little while. Filled with righteous anger he stepped into the bedroom, where a welcome sight met him. Steve lay stretched out on the bed in his underwear looking all sorts of beautiful.
“ ‘Sargent Rogers got me thirsty’,” Sam read chuckling.
“Can I get you more punch Mr. Rogers?” Peter eagerly held out a hand for his glass.
Steve blinked, shrugging, "Sure," he said mildly working his way through the bowl of Chicago mix in his lap.
It felt so real…
Steve grunted looking towards the muffled voice as it approached, he squinted as the fuzzy outline of a person got closer, great his glasses and hearing aid where gone. He glared in the general direction of the voice.
Those rough hands rubbed against his thighs before Tony licked him root to tip, forcing a moan up his throat. He gasped arching into this mouth as it closed around him, feeling Tony hum around him. Steve reached out hesitating a second before Tony grabbed his hand was setting it on the back of his head.
“Steve love, where are you?”
Steve’s stomach growled in anticipation making Anthony grin at him and shake his head, "And tomorrow my dear, we will be on the beach."
Steve nodded hesitantly, they had cuddled on the couch together…but the bed seemed different, somehow more intimate. Tony must have sensed his hesitation, “Would the couch be better?”
Rocket couldn’t take his eyes off that arm.
Steve tightened his arms, “Yes.”
“Are you sure you don’t want to come?”
Steve glanced at the smaller blonde grinning shoving with the others.
Tony tenderly kissed him before resting their foreheads together, “Oh love.”
Only on this occasion, there had been some disquiet from the investors in regards to Steve's less than stellar past. Anthony had been mad as hell, ready to tank the whole deal when Steve had interjected, it was a big deal and one that would see leaps and bounds in clean energy. So Anthony had gone, and Steve had stayed…and with nothing better to do the last week Steve had been closely watching Sam and Buck dance around each other.
He took a breath, gathering his courage, “Please take me apart.”
Rocket nodded in agreement, “He makes a point what the hell are you doing here?”
“They fight together well,” Sam noted echoing his thoughts.
Steve was done.
"Oh, and Sergeant,” Steve paused looking back to Fury the man far too amused,  "Report February 1, cold-weather exercise.”
He was just reaching for his clothes when the curtain to the change room was ripped aside and the shop assistant was there staring at him. Tony blinked, “Is somth-” he began but the man was lunging at him with an unmistakable hunger in his eye.
-#-#-#-
The wizard looked amused, “Does this have anything to do with Stark’s invite by chance?”
Steve wanted to snort, Anthony had been sick, and if people wanted to call him on that they were assholes….he felt aa cold rage start to simmer if they thought for one minute…
“See you then Sergeant Rogers.”
Steve ignored him, his evening was shaping up nicely.
-#-#-#-
“If I hadn’t run into them."
“Ok, full disclosure, at first it was purely physical attraction.”
-#-#-#-
“Steve?” A welcome red and gold figure appeared in his line of vision.
The song ended, and the tempo picked up again, but Tony didn't move far. He turned to lean against Steve as he watched the kids yell and dance, enjoying the evening.
Buck had left Rhodes in charge of some of the plans while they were away and his best man took his responsibilities seriously. Only Tony didn’t want to make them without Steve, it was silly, but he’d wanted the man’s input on what sort of flowers they should have or what sort of favour they should have.
Steve hummed drawing Tony back to his chest for a sweet kiss as the shower heated up, “Love you, Merry Christmas.”
Steve caught his breath, sure he had to be dreaming…it had felt so new, yet at the same time oddly familiar as if he’d kissed Tony a million times before.
Suddenly the alarm was blaring.
Anthony frowned, “Keep going,” he encouraged as he opened his dress pants. Steve moved back a little from the screen so Anthony could see all he wore was loose-fitting sweats.
Bruce laughed taking a sip of his coffee, it’d been a complete coincidence that he’d happened to be at the conference while Tony was in town. He was actually heading home this afternoon when Tony had called to invite him for breakfast.
Tony sighed, “I was, but apparently, he wants to make this a thing, I’ll get legal on it. No way I’m going to let anyone think I would ever cheat on Steve.”
“Can you shed some light on this Fri?” Tony asked his AI curiously.
“Go where?” Thor was back leaning on him with a wide goofy smile, Sam shook his head at the God.
"Yeah, Steve?"
Steve gave a horse bark, “Good.”
He stalled out as Steve gently prodded him, “Sorry,”  he blushed.
“Incoming,” Clint warned ahead of them, as faceless goons joined them on the roof of the cars cutting off Himself, Clint, and Buck from each other.
“Love you,” Anthony returned, “Can’t wait to see what you do next year, be hard to top this year.”
Until Tony’s ringing phone jolted them all upright. Everyone blinked in surprise Tony annoyed dug the phone out of his pocket swiping it open.
“Should have waited on the farm,” he sighed to himself, self-conscious in the suit he wore. He had thoroughly enjoyed meeting the Barton family, they’d been welcoming and sweet.
Tony was laughing again looking up at the man of his dreams, “Yes, yes it would.”
Steve rolled his eyes as they settled skimming the menus. Steve was intrigued to see it was an Asian fusion menu and ended up ordering a bunch of interesting-looking things.
Tony couldn’t help it, he laughed as the video faded into pictures, so many pictures, some great, some not so great, but very much reflective of the pair.
Had it been real?
Steve was having a bit of a surreal morning. Incredible sex, followed by a nap, and a rather sensual shower, he found himself in borrowed clothing eating breakfast with the Avengers. He tried not to be as impressed as he was.
Steve watched him carefully, those clever eyes had taken on a far off look, and he suddenly understood. This wasn’t about him, not really.
I love that movie, very retro.”
“Hello Steve, how are you?” Pepper answered, tone warm and pleasant. He liked Pepper, she was clever and quick. She had also looked after Anthony, and he would be forever thankful to her for that.
Anthony blinked at him, a stray tear running down his temple, Steve caught it with his thumb. He wished at that moment he could explain himself better, to tell Anthony just how humbling it was that this wonderful incredible man loved him despite everything. Steve knew he was a wreck, somedays he couldn’t get out of bed, but Anthony loved him, accepted him flaws and all; the good and bad.
The question was directed at him and he looked at the reporter deadpan, the man shrank back. He must be new, reporters did not talk to him often.
Steve slowed his stride a bit as he grunted in acknowledgment checking the numbers on the houses as they moved along.
“It’s Steve and Tony actually, someone snapped a picture of your piggyback ride today.”
They waited as the big man approached, pausing before them larger than life, “Wanda, Vision.”
Before Peter could ask the waiter returned with their food, unsure what to do he followed the Sergeant's lead putting his napkin in his lap. The dish looked amazing as he carefully cut into it. Beside him, Sarge had already started eating.
“Nothing from you,” the voice cheerfully replied, “Your boyfriend on the other hand.”
Steve stood still in the sudden ringing silence, head a mess, and heart-pounding.
Steve complied feeling Peter draw closer as they were lead further into the house, to something that resembled an office where Strange floated in midair reading a book.
“No, it’s a precaution Anthony, you’ve worked hard for everything you have. I will gladly sign a prenup if it meant you’re protected.”
Sighing he leaned down kissing a feverish brow, “Come on love, you need to try and eat a little something.”
He was roused from his stupor by yelling.
Especially with holidays just around the corner, she has been missing her twin fiercely.
Tony hummed, eyes fluttering closed as they felt too heavy to keep them open, “Feel like I got run over by the Hulk.”
He was such a fool…Tony was so far out of his league it was laughable, what would he ever see in him?
"I know," Steve mumbled before a voice was yelling at him across the bar demanding another round.
century.
The Avengers made headline again yesterday, saving the city from…”
"Oh right there, right there…" he shifted squeezing him tighter, and Steve clenched his jaw grimly holding on wanting to make it good.
Steve gently smoothed dark hair slicked with sweat, humming in agreement. He closed his eyes a rumble of contentment deep in his chest. The lay pressed together long minutes before Anthony moved first, wincing as Steve slipped from him.
Tony had no idea what to say, they must have had a serious existential crisis in the last few hours because they had been dead set against anything he’d been trying to sell.
Steve sighed heavily, giving the kid another nudge. The crowd around him refused to budge. Growling audibly Steve stepped forward, suddenly the students were eager to move opening a direct path to Anthony. Giving another pleased grunt he followed the nervous-looking Peter as they moved through the people.
“Over here,” Carol called voice soft as she pointed to the big couch on the far side of the room. Tony turned, his heart-melting all over again. Steve was sitting with his head lulled back, clearly asleep. Peter slumped into his side breathing softly as well.
-#-#-#-
The waitress returned with their drinks and taking their order disappeared, blush on her cheeks. Amused Tony shook his head, Steve raised an eyebrow at him and Tony felt a wash of love for the man.
Tony was frowning furiously, “No it’s not, that happen often?”
“What’s left of SHIELD,” he rasped as he made his way directly into Fury’s office, throwing open the doors with a harsh bang. He had hoped to catch the man off guard but if he did, the Fury hid it well.
“I like the colours,” Tony noted, it was true the colours were an interesting mix, they looked like they shouldn’t work together but somehow, they did. “And the movement,” he added watching as they seemed to spiral out from a central point in the piece.
“Stevie?” Cap asked again, smiling turning down a little in concern; something finally connected in his head.
“Fri what was the movie Anthony and I watched last week, the one with the robot that killed people…” he asked eyes never leaving the jacket.
“Only thing I’m sure of in this world,” he mumbled, and Anthony was hugging him again burying his face in his neck. Steve held onto him tight, he knew they would no doubt have to deal with the fallout of this, but as long as they were together that was all that mattered.
She made a soft sound of sadness, “I’m sorry Steve.”
Steve blinked, for a second there where two Tony’s looking at him, smiling softly.
Bucky was looking nostalgic again, a sort of dreamy far off look in his eyes, "Did you have Halloween dances?" Sam asked him curiously.
Gasping he tugged harder at the cuffs, whimpering as his skin rubbed raw.
“So we were all still superhero’s but you were…like old you? Like pre-serum?”
“It’s ok,” Steve mumbled shrugging as he rubbed absently at his shoulder.
Steve huffed a small breathy laugh as he reached out slinging his arms around Tony drawing him closer as he wrapped skinny legs around his hips, “I
Colonel Rhodes snorted.
He whimpered again, Tony settling his had firmly against his skin as Steve moved his hips slowly, grinding down.
Bucky followed behind Steve moving to help the kid with Natasha, as the big blonde cleared the way.
Tony snorted shaking his head, “Did you sell?”
“Better,” Steve rasped, even offering him a tentative smile.
Peter was still picking his jaw off the floor, “ Yes! I mean I’m on holidays but I didn’t have plans, is there a mission?”
Steve felt a warm lassitude wash over him, content and peaceful. He could see this…see them together, just like this always…closing his eyes to rest as well he felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. Muttering to himself and careful not to dislodge Anthony’s feet from his lap he fished it out frowning at the screen.
Steve was giving him his snarl smile, "It's ok I was surprised too."
Steve leaned forward resting their foreheads together, "I can't imagine a life worth living without you."
"Oh my god, that was so cool! You like…and then he….and you…" the kid was talking so fast his words fell together as he gestured rapidly.
The threat sounded too cheery, Steve let his head drop forward.
Tony was calling him but the pain was welling up, he knew…he knew he wasn't…Tony was handsome and confident…perfect and he was…

It was a weird sort of burning, he sniffed again before the heat he’d been feeling had finally registered beyond uncomfortable to burning. He looked down at his clothes, smoke rolling off them as something ate through the material.
-#-#-#-
Steve rolled his eyes, he didn’t get this social media phenomenon. Tony and the PR people had assured him it was a good thing. They'd even encouraged him to get his own Twitter and start using it but he wasn’t interested. He didn’t see a point to it really, and if that made him a little old fashioned he was ok with it.
Steve was careful to keep his approach slow and his voice calm, yet authoritative.
"Yeah, that's not a good name." Cooper said.
"Yes," Peggy said. "That's why I know. He told me because he felt I had a right to know before we pursued anything."
"Can't you see that I'm not hurting myself," Tony said. "I'm making myself better?"
go into in-patient rehab," Tony said. "I set that penalty myself, so there's no unlawful imprisonment there. Still, it's not something I
Now that the Avengers are back from D.C. things are back to normal, right?
"I hate rain checks," Steve said.
"I know that can't be the truth," she said. "Yeah, you're COO of a cosmetics production facility, but you got put there for business reasons. You hold no science degrees. You had to have had help to pull this off. Who?"
"Fantastic," she said. "Thanks for asking." Bruce frowned a bit.
"Please," she said. "I'd rather try to pierce my septum with a thumb tack." Tony winced at the mental image of that.
The man stopped speaking suddenly. Steve realized that he must have said that last thing aloud. He tried opening his eyes again and this time he was rewarded with bright streams of light pouring into his pupils. Everything was blurry at first, but after a few seconds, it all came into focus. A man with black hair, brown eyes, a warm complexion, and a neatly trimmed beard stood over him. From the look the man was giving him, Steve could tell that the man wasn't sure what to make of him.
"Sure," Tony said. "Just shut the door behind you." Lara nodded and did as he asked before nervously taking a step forward.
He immediately took off towards the portal, hoping he could do something to stop the Chitauri soldiers before they made it to the ground and started hurting civilians. Although, yes, the streets were mostly empty, there were still a few stragglers and gawkers about plus the massive police presence down below. Not to mention the reporters out to get their fill of blood and guts in living color… With those lives at stake, Tony knew he had to either contain this ASAP or at least buy them enough time to at least start running for their lives if he couldn't.
"Actually, could you run an errand for me really quick?" Tony asked.
"Down by the chemical engineering department," she said.
Tony took her hand and followed her through the crowd. Checking back, he saw Steve following closely behind. Tony shut his eyes and allowed Romanoff to guide him through the chaos, thanking whatever entities made it possible for him to get through this without vomiting all over the House floor.
"It doesn't prevent you from becoming a carrier," Smith pointed out. "I'm sorry Captain Rogers, but for your safety and the safety of everyone else, I'm going to have to ask you and Agent Romanoff to remain quarantined here."
"You will have your war, Asgardian," the Other said as he slowly walked around the God of Mischief. "If you fail; if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he cannot find you." The Other came to a stop directly behind Loki. "You think you know pain? He will make you long for something sweet as pain."
"Anytime, my dear." He patted Steve's back as he said, "Now, you better get to eating before you have to reheat that again."
"Stark's computer system was blocking the signal," Clint explained. "Hill found a work-around, so it shouldn't be a problem again."
"I'm not quite sure," Tony said. "But I know it wasn't to appoint people to your position – even on a temporary basis – without my knowledge or say so." Lara sighed.
?" Lara laughed mockingly.
"Alright," Steve said reluctantly. "If you're sure."
"Alright," he said. "So, we're all impulsive assholes and sorry about it. Good to know we're on the same page as a team." Natasha groaned.
"Commander," Natasha said without preamble. "We have a situation."
So, she was telling the truth there and it was a truth that Tony had not considered before. If she wanted to, she could have easily tried to use her position to steal from him. Not that she would have been able to do so, but she could have tried to, and she did not. Even if S.H.I.E.L.D. did not ask her to, she could have at least tried to take something to earn extra brownie points, but she did not. Tony was not quite sure what to make of that, but before he could consider it further, another board member chimed in.
He made his way around the room, meandering a bit as he kept forgetting his goal. He didn't see anyone he recognized and when he stopped to talk to people, he couldn't even remember what he was saying, let alone what the conversation was even about. He was about midway through one of these conversations when he thought he heard someone call his name.
"Nope." Stark refilled her glass and again, they toasted before washing down the shots of rancid juice. It tasted worse than the first time if that was even possible. Despite that, Natasha schooled her features into something much less reactionary as she set her glass down.
"JARVIS," he said. "Pull up what you can about Congressman Eduardo Salinas."
"The only thing I have to say for myself is that I feel like I'm about to have a stress-induced heart attack."
"Seriously?" Clint questioned.
Although it had only been ten or fifteen minutes since he had gotten back from the bathroom, to Tony, it felt like an eternity. As stated before, the motions of the plane didn't do anything to help his stomach, and he wanted nothing more than to open the plane's door and walk out. (Not in a suicidal way. The MK12 could quickly deploy from the tower and make it to him before he could hit the ground. Although, it could technically be considered homicidal seeing as everyone else would be sucked out of the airplane and killed if he did that.) It was agonizing but slowly, the waves of nausea started ebbing back, and Tony could feel himself begin to relax a bit. Steve put a hand on his back, and he relaxed a bit more.
They were led into a back room with barely enough space for all five of them to fit. The concierge took a seat in front of a computer monitor. Natasha gestured to Steve to take the only other available seat before crouching down next to the concierge. Bruce crouched down beside Steve and Clint remained standing behind Steve and the concierge.
"You wouldn't happen to have any information to pass on about that, would you?" Hill sighed.
"Ugh," Lara groaned as she got up. "Of course, he hasn't. Alright, I'll go see what's going on. Just let me straighten myself out." Just as she reached for the remote, the movie got to the best part. She couldn't help but mouth along.
"Not yours, either," the redhead shot back.
"You are most welcome, Lady Natasha." With that, the plane took off without a hitch and had lapsed into silence.
"Careful," Tony warned. "I might just take you up on that."
"Because people generally can't go into space." Natasha looked like she was explaining this for the thousandth time. "We haven't really explored it that much. Plus, it's incredibly expensive just to make one plane able to go to space…"
"Already one step ahead of you." Natasha nodded in approval as the three of them stepped out into the foyer.
"Are we done here?" Thor just continued to breathe heavily as he took in the sight of the now destroyed forest. Steve couldn't tell what Tony was thinking behind the mask, but he didn't make any move to attack. Good, they were all on the same page. "Where's Loki?"
"No, it's a general rule," Natasha said. "You have to follow it all the time."
"She'll get over it," Tony dismissed.
"Sure, it is." Lara scowled in disbelief at Tony's tone but quickly turned her attention back to her phone. Meanwhile, Bruce slid into the seat across from Steve and Tony.
Stark just stared at her, his eyes completely uncomprehending. For a moment, Jessica thought the effects of the poison might be setting in. Then he spoke up.
Although most of the Avengers' penthouse had been updated to accommodate all its new residents, Steve and Tony's apartment was rather incomplete. Tony had been more focused on getting the rest of the penthouse ready for Romanoff and Barton to move in, which they would be after Tuesday. As a result, when the elevator doors opened, Lara was greeted by the sight of plain white walls and the sounds of Tony and Pepper arguing about the apartment's condition. While Tony and Pepper arguing usually wasn't a good thing, Lara was relieved to hear it as it meant that their attention wouldn't immediately be on the fact that she had pulled the fire alarm and they should probably fire her for that. She didn't regret doing it, but she also wanted to keep her job, even if for only a few seconds longer.
"No one knows what to do the first time it happens," he said. "You did great, though."
"Do you believe in God?" she asked.
Pepper's eyes narrowed in confusion. It was clear she didn't know what that meant. Steve's eyes, though, were wide with alarm. Even if he wanted to, Tony couldn't lie. As much as he wanted to assure Pepper that he was fine, and he didn't need help, at this point doing so would absolutely be lying.
"He's a spy," Tony said. "
Before Carol could react, the door in front of her was ripped open and a shooting pain traveled across her back. Stumbling forward, she quickly lost her footing and began a rapid decent down a flight of stairs. She tried to use her powers to stabilize herself, but all she ended up doing was blasting the wooden steps into splinters that flew right up into her face. She slammed into a concrete wall hard, leaving her dazed for a few seconds as she fell to the floor.
"Us?"
"I'm sorry," Tony muttered as they made it to the threshold of the plane's exit.
"Both of those were pretty high-stress environments." Tony shrugged.
"Well," he said. "If I put an arrow through Loki's eye socket I'd sleep better I suppose." As he finished saying that, Clint took his right hand and tapped the area over his heart with his two middle fingers while keeping his thumb, index, and pinkie finger straight. Natasha nodded in understanding.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Next time I do that blast the loudest, most annoying noise possible and don't stop until I'm awake and listening."
When the sky started to lighten up, Natasha's phone buzzed. She picked it up, texted a reply, and within a few minutes, it buzzed again. It continued like that the rest of the way into the city. Steve didn't ask who she was texting, but he did hope that whoever it was, she was talking about what just happened because she needed to talk about it with somebody.
"You promise?" Pepper asked.
"No, no," Lara said. "I startled myself, really. You are fine. Don't worry."
"No," Bruce said cutting Betty off before she could say the words aloud. "I haven't told her about what my father did, or anyone else for that matter. You, Jennifer, and obviously the Police are still the only ones that know." A guilty look crossed Betty's face.
"It's okay," he heard him whisper. The thing was, Tony wasn't hesitating because it was stressful for him. However, he did find it in himself to give an honest answer to the question.
"Fuck the CDC," she said. "You kill those bugs and you kill them now. We need answers before Barton is dead."
"Can you tell me the real answer this time?" Lara sighed.
"I should probably start cleaning this up," he remarked.
"Yes," she said. "But given that there are no meetings today and for you 'no meetings' means spending the whole day in ripped jeans and doing lab work, I figured I could get away with it." Tony raised a challenging eyebrow.
"I am," he lied. The looks on both Happy and Pepper's faces told him that it wasn't being bought. "Look what do you want me to say? I fucked up horribly and I can't fix that, and I hate it, but there's nothing that can be done about it. Besides, I think we should be focusing on more urgent matters right now, like keeping Courtney Love over here from doing in her own husband." Pepper and Happy caught that he was trying to deflect, but before they could say anything about it, Lara took the bait.
Agent Duran took more than a few pictures of the rock, she took pictures of the yard, the ground, the house, and even into her neighbor's yard. This got Annabeth concerned and she started wondering if she should call the police. She was just about to go and ask one of her colleagues for their opinion when Agent Duran returned, asking for that contact list. Annabeth just puts down a bunch of fake names and numbers and sent the agent on her way. If she really was Homeland Security, she could find that information out for herself.
"Ass," she muttered as the elevator doors slid open with a ding.
"Okay," she said. "What's the problem with that?" Tony looked at her like she had four heads.
"Good," Bruce said. "I'm glad."
"Oh, it was much
"I'm fine," Clint tried to dismiss, but Natasha did not look like she bought that even a single bit.
(See the end of the chapter for
"'Learned the truth?'" Lara questioned. "Oh, don't tell me you found Christ in jail. Praise be to Jesus!"
Back when they were in D.C., Carol gave Tony a way to contact her in the event of an emergency. Well, what if it's not really an emergency...?
"Nothing," Tony said. "Absolutely nothing."
"Not a great plan," Tony pointed out as he took a sip off his drink. Yup, he could already feel the alcohol working its magic. He started to make his way across the room to face Loki. "When they come – and they will – they'll come for you."
"Oh, indeed, Mr. Stark." The HR rep looked unimpressed as she stood in front of him. "Now why do you keep feeling the need to keep interrupting my seminar?" Tony attempted to smile confidently, but that only served as another red flag to his guilt.
"No problem," he said. "We're downstairs in the lobby if you need us."
Steve was pushed back against the wall between Bruce's and Natasha's suites. Around Clint, he could see that Lara was rushing to open the door. That was all he needed to use as much force as he safely could to push Clint to the ground and pull his hands behind his back. By the time he had Clint pinned, Natasha's door had opened, and Lara had let out an overjoyed shriek.
"Update me on any and all changes in mission status," the man said.
He didn't know what he was looking for or why. It wasn't like that video of the Oswin girl before where she became more visible with each playthrough. Every frame remained the same each time Tony watched it. The only thing it was serving to do was distract Tony from his video and add to his disdain towards Freeman.
Questions are arising in everyone's minds. Will they get answers?
I've procrastinated long enough (sadly.) I'll just leave you on that happy note.
"What the hell," she said. "Might as well give it a shot."
"That's the thing," Clint said. "I haven't picked one out yet."
"Is he okay?" Tony said when Fury didn't say anything. "Is he alright to talk?"
"Well Ma said she wanted us to play outside, so we have to play outside," Bucky said.
"Whatever," Tony said with a shake of his head and a slight smirk. "Forever live in the safety of denial land. Just know that I'll miss you dearly.
"If Castro dies, break out the champagne," he said. "Celebrate without me. I don't have time for 'what ifs.'"
"Yeah," Tony said. "There's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you."
"Of course, I am," Tony said. "Like I said, I can't just take this lying down. That guy is out there
He reached into his jacket pocket…
Natasha could see the dirty look the concierge was giving her. Obviously, he didn't condone her putting her socked feet on the pristine couch that sat in the waiting area. Too bad. She was comfortable like this and it felt so good to be comfortable after a needlessly exhausting two-hour flight. Besides, at least she had the courtesy to take off her snow-covered boots first.
"I am a king!" he snapped.
"I'm okay," he assured. "Don't worry about me."
Originally uploaded to FFN on 7/3/19.
A very drunk Tony wandered out of the hotel in search of more alcohol, only to be found by Congressman Eduardo Salinas. Salinas took Tony back to his house to recover, however, Salinas' maid has just informed him that the water he was drinking was poisoned and he has fifteen minutes to live!
"Hold on," Steve said. "Captain Danvers isn't going."
Tony's cries stopped after that, but Steve wasn't sure if that was a good or bad thing. He couldn't focus on that right now. He was still being shot at, after all. Slowly, Steve tried as best as he could to stand up without catching a bullet to the head.
Loki stood dumbfounded in his cell. He hadn't foreseen this. The Tesseract hadn't shown him this. Although, he had to applaud the Black Widow. It took a lot of skill to trick a trickster, and somehow she managed to succeed in doing it.
Despite the assertion, Tony could not help the feelings that were boiling away inside of his stomach. He tried to tell himself that it would go away as soon as he was back in Steve's arms, but even that thought was not enough to spark even the tiniest amount of optimism inside of him; real or forced.
As soon as he reached the top of the stairs and turned back to check the living room, he spotted Tony fast asleep on the couch. Well, that was how it appeared at first. Closer inspection revealed that Tony was passed out with three empty bottles of scotch surrounding him. Rhodey quickly checked for a pulse. Finding one, he let out a relieved sigh.
"Women with powers?" Hill questioned. "What do you mean?"
"What's going on?" she asked.
"If it's any consolation, neither am I," Carol said. "I act like I know what I'm doing all the time, but really I don't."
"Actually, they're a more common mode of travel on Vanahiem than Asgard," Thor said. "And I never said they were 'giant', just large enough to ride."
Oswin then marched off in the direction of the front entrance. Duran followed her and was taken off-guard when Oswin stopped short. Looking out the front window, Duran saw an Asian man clad only in his tighty-no-longer-whities. Duran staggered out a shocked breath.
"You better clench up, Legolas," he said before blasting off and taking Clint to his designated lookout point. Steve turned to Thor.
"I'm sorry." Her voice was sincere, leaving no doubt in Tony's mind that she meant it.
"I do." He then leaned in and pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek. "Whatever it is we need to do to figure this out, I promise you we'll do it together. Okay?"
"Everhart's a word I can't use in a professional setting," Lara countered.
"Okay," she said. "How do I exit out of this?"
"Um," she hesitated. "Now's not the best time…"
"You and Lisa, obviously," Clint said.
"Just play it by ear," Natasha said. "I've got an apology I need to make, too, but if it doesn't seem like he's going to take it, don't."
"Agent Romanoff," she said. "I'm just here to take Agent Barton's vitals. I don't mean any harm to you, him, or anyone else."
For very secret spy reasons, Clint knew how to make fake blood out of KY jelly (which the hotel had so kindly provided.) He whipped up the recipe quick and started smearing it on the walls. Then, he pushed the mattress halfway off the bedframe and tilted the headboard forward a little bit. He didn't have a lot of cash on him, but the hotel did provide plenty of reading material. He emptied out his smallest suitcase and stuffed as many books as he could inside. Feeling satisfied that the case felt heavy enough to be carrying a few hundred thousand dollars, he strategically placed a few bills so they would stick out of the case and shut the lid.
"So," Tony said. "I believe we've been trying to have a conversation for the past four hours, only to be continuously and rudely interrupted."
"I do," he said. "Goodnight, Pepper."
"Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony," Steve said as he began to make his way over to the other man.
"That was real." For a moment, Tony was relieved, but then he remembered what happened to her.
"Fine." Steve let go of her shoulder.
"Okay." At that point, Natasha started to pull away, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. She never broke out crying as she had feared when Clint first pulled her into the hug, but she felt as relieved as she would have if she did. In gratitude, she gave him a small, reassuring smile. "Thanks, Clint." He waved it off.
That was, until she set forth to the task. Then her face was complete determination. She ran through the tests fast, which was a relief. Though, at one point during the test, Tony couldn't help but ask, "was that girl okay? Jessica?" Dr. Smith was silent for a moment before answering.
At that point, Steve got the message. So Tony was mad at how distant he was being. Fine. He could be that way. Steve wasn't going to stop. It was keeping them both safe, and he could be just as snide right back.
"Agent Jenifer Duran," the woman introduced herself. "Department of Homeland Security. Do you mind if I look in your backyard?"
"It's fine," Tony said. "It's not like anything else I've tried is even touching this thing." He wasn't even exaggerating. Everything he tried wasn't touching and he had too much to do in too little time to even bother thinking about going to a doctor. Plus, he had a feeling that if he did go to a doctor, he'd end up hospitalized. Sure, he could leave against medical advice, but that'd take too much time and he didn't want to miss his flight to go see Steve later today. Even if he only saw the guy for a grand total of two minutes while Fury had him "politely escorted" from the building, the five-hour long flight and pushing serious health concerns to the side would be worth it. Should he be worried that he was completely fine with doing both those things for a guy he only talked to for about fifty minutes, but then again, he's done lot worse things for a lot less. There's video evidence of it.
than alcohol," Rhodes stressed. "Thank God it only happened the once, though."
"This isn't a matter of trust," Steve pointed out.
"What?"
"What are you doing?" Steve shouted over the roar of the wind. He didn't get a response as a muscular man with long blond hair landed on the ramp and strode inside. Tony was getting ready to fire a repulsor blast at the man, before the man whacked him in the chest with a hammer, sending Tony flying clear across the jet. The man then grabbed Loki by the chest, dragged him back down the ramp, and jumped from the plane, taking Loki with him. Steve stood there for a second in shock. Tony got to his feet.
The footsteps approached him, but Loki didn't move. He tried to breathe as shallowly as possible and he kept his eyes closed. Something, some little subtlety he overlooked must have given him away. He should have used magic. Even if it would have caused him to use up his energy and pass out again, making him completely vulnerable to this stranger, at least they would have thought he was dead. No, instead they saw right through his act, grabbed him by the hair, and started pulling him across the coarse surface of the ground.
"That's semantics," she said.
"No," she said. "All of this was a damn nightmare, and we have to do it all over again tomorrow! It's pure madness! This is why everyone in Hollywood is on drugs. Eminem, Slash, Drew Berrymore, Amanda Bynes…"
"Why were you sitting in front of the door?" Tony asked as he struggled to remember her name. He could remember that her last name was Conroy, but her first name was eluding him. "And what are you doing here? I thought I told you to meet me in my office."
"Can't get my mind to turn off," Tony said. "I mean, I'm not really thinking about anything at all, other than how much I want to sleep, but still my brain won't switch off."
"Alright…" She looked back at Stark. "We have to go." To her surprise, he seemed to be relived at the declaration. His body visibly deflated as he let out a breath, he probably didn't know he'd been holding.
As far as Tony knew, no mental illness ran on either side of his family. Both Howard and Maria had been only children and his grandparents on both sides had died by the time he'd been born. His only extended family member had been Peggy, but that had been an honorary title. They held no real blood relation. As a result, he had no real gene pool to pull from and only speculation to fill in the gaps. Again, Tony wanted to put down "N/A," but Steve and Pepper had talked him into checking off alcohol abuse. Howard may have never sought help for his issues, but ultimately it had been irresponsible drinking that had claimed the lives of him and his wife, which came as a close enough diagnosis for them. Tony had to admit they had a point and let Rhodey check that option off. The only other option Tony had considered fitting was "violence," but he didn't want to try to open that can of worms – especially when he had no proof. As a result, he thought it best to let sleeping dogs lie and answer no to that one.
"I can't answer that." Duran then pulled a thin, silver camera out from her other pocket. "Do you mind if I take a few pictures?"
"Stark," she said. "You don't understand the entire circumstances behind that mission."
"Okay," she said. "First of all, it's ex-husband, emphasis on the ex." Tony shrugged.
First, if the Avengers had a power couple, it would be Steve and Tony, hands down. Not that the press would know it, given that Steve was still in the closet about his bisexuality and Tony (for understandable reasons) was respecting that even though Tony probably wanted more than anything to be able to run through the streets, telling the world that he was banging Captain America. Second, the media wouldn't be the first ones to assume that she and Clint were together.
The word screamed in a loud, ear-piercing tone through Loki's brain.
"I'm sorry," was all Steve could think to say.
The Raël had no conflict with the Kree. They were a peaceful race who only wished to live undisturbed. They never sought out trouble, and trouble never found them. That was until the great plague. Almost no one was spared and unfortunately that was the Raëls' own doing.
"Betty," he said, looking at her oddly, which Lara returned in kind.
Steve's heart stuttered at the slight note of despair that rang through Tony's voice at the end of that last sentence. It did not go unnoticed by the other Avengers, either.
"I've got a ride," she said as she dropped her weapon to the ground. "I could use a boost though." Catching sight of the approaching legion Steve understood what it was she was going to do and backed up a few feet until he was standing in front of the bridge's barrier wall and Natasha did the same standing opposite him.
