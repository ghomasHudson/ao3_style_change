She hadn’t meant to panic like this. It wasn’t like it was

“I offered,” she replied simply. “Goodnight, Toni.”
Nat expertly maintained her expression in spite of the non sequitur and shrugged gracefully.
They got down to business pretty quickly after that, discussing policies and ideas over lunch in one of the meeting rooms.
“I thought,” she began shakily, “I thought you’d eventually get bored or frustrated with me if I didn’t understand stuff. I mean with Peter and Harley and Shuri you guys get to talk about all kinds of things and they-” She stopped to inhale a shuddering breath. “Sometimes my teachers-”
. And she’d cried some more and how had she not run out of tears, yet?
“Seeing as I’m a part of it now, I think I have a right to know
He shrugged and sat back completely and Toni let him go. “S’just,” he said, rubbing his eyes, “my mom was really sad. She didn’t say anything but I heard her crying in her room a few times. When you came she cried less. Now she smiles more and you guys talk about the Accords and-” Cooper shrugged, expression heartbreakingly young and open. “I think she was lonely n’ even though she was mad at you too you keep her company.”
None of the shit that happened over the course of the DMMMACE(s) could be described as remotely close to the caliber of shit that hit the fan as the other shitty incidents but the fact that they just

“Being a princess is hard work,” she said with an understanding shrug. “As was, I’m sure, being a prince and heir to more than just a throne.”
of the heels against the floor of the Compound.
Sometimes Bucky felt like the proverbial unstoppable force, like a juggernaut, ruthless and unrelenting.
Natasha watched Toni straighten out her papers - parts of a speech, some notes, statistics and a mural of reminders scratched out in blood-red ink - at the podium.

She vaguely wondered whether this was what mothers felt like on a daily basis, then quickly dismissed the idea because what had she birthed other than a series of incrementally bad decisions?
— expression on his face melted into something fond and hopeful yet still self-conscious, if the way he kept opening his mouth to speak then closing it again was anything to go by.
It wasn’t perfect. This wasn’t her world, this little pocket of purity that she only belonged in temporarily. But it was pretty damn close. And it was beautiful in its own right.
I am so, so glad to hear so many of you enjoyed the previous chapter. Less plotty and more feels and coziness and now I bring you...this. This is a fairly big one, so gird your loins and get something to drink because it might take a while. As always, thank you to everybody who took the time to read this fic and leave a comment or a kudos or bookmark the story. I honestly never thought so many people would be reading this much less telling me that they enjoyed it so thank you all from the bottom of my heart.

She blinked slowly, feeling like her head was filled with cotton as thick and dense as the rainclouds outside.
“No! I don’t want you to
The only other time he’d felt this bad was when Toni had accidentally shot him with one of her upgraded repulsor prototypes. To be fair it was his fault for surprising her. It still hurt like crazy, though.
And the worst part. The fucking

when she wasn’t the only one who was hurting.
Stark was so close to the component, her nose was practically pressed against it.
Steve smiled, small and tense but a smile nonetheless. Bucky suspected he needed something familiar to hold onto while things were still so strained. He secretly wondered whether they would ever not be.
It took a moment for Steve’s sleep-addled brain to catch up with that string of words.
,” she added in a biting undertone that he was likely not meant to hear. “But anyway. I let him give her my designs. For someone whose knowledge of vibranium and Wakandan technology is so limited she caught up phenomenally quick. I suppose I shouldn’t have expected any less,” she uttered with a kind of bitterness that seemed solely directed at herself.
“They are.” Toni gently took them from him, meeting his gaze, silently asking for permission before she slipped one around each of his wrists. They constricted almost immediately, moulding to his wrists with an electric

to stay with Laura. Didn’t even really know how that happened but it did. She’d wanted to go...anywhere. Maybe out west? Maybe one of her dad’s cabins up north near the border.
“Who the hell are you?” she asked as she passed Harley.
“Don’t be sorry,” she told him, shaking her head. “You
Vision slowed his gait before speaking once more. “In several days’ time we will present our case to the Council for the last time. Toni will be called to speak once more and whatever she says will determine whether or not Captain Rogers and the other Avengers will be allowed to return.
“Yes.”
Steve didn’t know what he’d expected upon his return to the Compound. Truth be told he’d tried not to think about it. Not that the out of sight, out of mind tactic had ever worked in the past, considering the fact that every moment that had passed since Siberia had been filled with thoughts about Toni no matter how hard he tried. Now was no different.
,” she accused, looking at him with an expression that was asking him
Bucky looked up from the spot on the floor his eyes had been drilling a hole into, and managed what felt like a weak grin.
. She felt it in the way Peter stiffened, his body already turning of its own volition.
with, he reached out with one hand and carefully pushed it shut with what she assumed was magic considering he was standing about a foot away and his hand never came into contact with it.
Toni watched Shuri work, watched Peter literally crawl across the table to get in on everything to do with Stephen Strange. He and Shuri didn’t often get to spend time with one another, what with school and Shuri’s back and forth from Wakanda. But when their paths did cross at the Compound they gravitated to one another like teenagers tended to do, seeking out similar company in a world of grown ups and responsibilities, no matter how vastly different their backgrounds. There was a short period of time where she worried that they might not get along but when she saw them out on the grounds from her window one afternoon, racing a couple of highly-upgraded drones with two boxes of pizza between them and Happy yelling at them to get off of the goddamn lawn, it set her concerns to rest.
on the plant stand by the large, floor-to-ceiling windows of the common area.
But in that one moment, in that shared second, something had shifted, some determination, some strength dredged up from a frozen wasteland. And as dismal as it seemed, it had also given him hope. Just small, barely there, but all seeds could take root if given enough care.
There was a tense silence in the long moments that followed, anxiety - and some confusion - emanating from the observation room in waves. Even the bots had ceased playing and were watching their creator with concerned beeps and soft coos. Bucky couldn’t bring himself to look but Steve, he knew, was probably clenching and unclenching his fists, unblinking.
But it hurt. It hurt deeply.
“Hey. While I introduce myself to Mrs. Barton and the mini Bartons of there, I think you oughta give my driver a talking to about speed limits.” Rhodey snorted at Toni’s confused look and pushed himself around her. “You didn’t think I drove
if Toni didn’t know what Natasha was up to.
Coulson smiled and Natasha smiled back.
And this,
And all he ever wanted to be was
“Promise. Wouldn’t miss those pancakes for the world.”
One table had a cluster of stools around it and on the surface were a ring of mugs, misshapen, with the initials of whom Bucky surmised were the names of the kids Steve had briefly mentioned in passing. HK for Harley Keener, KK for Kamala Khan, PP for Peter Parker and a solid S, which was undeniably Shuri.
When he finally looked at her, she saw a man she didn’t know and yet
, and she wore it like a second layer of skin. They’d seen War Machine - Sam hadn’t taken his eyes off the screen, his expression alternating between relief, regret and joy - Spider-Man, Natasha and Vision so far. He knew T’Challa was there somewhere, but he seemed to be doing a good job of keeping away from the cameras. Wasp had entered one of the frames for a brief amount of time and Scott had whooped and cried at that short, barely three-seconds worth of footage.
chance that it might...explode and short-out the arm so we’ll need to replace all of the ruined parts or fit in the new one entirely depending on the extent of the damage. If I’m not quick enough to remove the power source before it explodes there is a chance that it could...kill the both of us and possibly destroy the lab. And a good chunk of the building.”
“That sounds like a marvelous idea. I shall get started on it in the morning.”

(See the end of the chapter for
“I think so. She’s strong. I mean, that’s what people say, right? But she seems,” Toni trailed off, watching through the window as Kamala’s chest rose and fell, and feeling something protective and aching in the hollow of her ribs. “Her body’s gone through a total DNA restructuring. Not many people could survive that, much less a slip of a girl like her. God, she’s small. She’s
“Yeah. It wasn’t even the fate of the world. And he left to help friends fight against other friends.” She scoffed, disbelieving. “I still can’t wrap my mind around it. What did he think he was doing
The only indication of Toni’s surprise was the stilling of her fingers for a bare two seconds before they resumed their work.
Just a brief, barely significant shift in her expression, but it spoke
“I need you to be awake when we affix the arm,” she said, right to his face, her expression giving him no indication as to whether she was internally restraining herself from leaping across the table and strangling him -
“War Machine, you’re gonna have to punch open a hole; stick an IOU somewhere and I’ll see about picking up the tab.”
“We can all do homework sessions together or something,” Toni said as she pulled back, grateful for the sight of Kamala’s bashful smile and reddened nose. “Plus you’ll each be getting an insight to whatever you’re all learning at school. Except for Shuri, who doesn’t even go to school but she’ll wanna join in.”
“That must be a real pain sometimes,” she mused ruefully and he gave her a lopsided smile.
“Fine,” she said with a snort. “Stupid door, is all.”
. I just...it’d be nice to be able to keep up with them sometimes rather than feeling stupid.”
“I look forward to reading it,” he said, quiet but honest as far as she could tell.
Together they stood, stacked the baskets of sprouts on top of each other and carried them back to the house, side by side.
“KAREN told on me?” He felt vaguely offended; he’d thought they’d had something special.
That told him a lot about how much time Steve must’ve spent down here himself.
Toni couldn’t allow herself to think of that because if she did, if she fell down that rabbit hole it would set her back
Natasha didn’t smile but her eyes softened mildly. “After Toni submitted her first appeal she got in touch with her. She was huge in coordinating with the CSRE in Sokovia a few months ago. The city has a lot to get through before it’s inhabitable but...it’s a start.”
, but the implication was there.
Bucky had been hungry so Steve and Sam accompanied him to the kitchen. On the way there, they just so happened to meet Clint, who had spent the better part of the afternoon with Lila, and Wanda, who was freshly showered and in need of some tea after having finished one of her sessions with Strange.
Stark looked like she was standing on the edge of a knife, like the tiniest gust of wind in either direction would compromise her artfully crafted balance.
She continued to watch his face, searching, maybe. For what, he didn’t know. Humanity, perhaps.
Instead, he asked her, “What will you call it?”
He grabbed Steve’s shoulder when it looked like Steve was going to argue. “No, Steve. Don’t take this away from me. Don’t. This is one fight you gotta back down from. Because I’m
“Somewhere in the Baltic last I heard.”
She sighed. “If you’re gonna tell me I look ‘good’ then I’m gonna have to stop you right there.” Her fingers worried the pendant around her neck, the one the kids had given her. “We both know I look like shit. Trying to change the world will do that to you.”

Toni started at the name and glared at him.
At one point Cooper had snuck away when she wasn’t paying attention, and when she hunted him down she found him out back using the table saw and she very nearly lost her shit until she noticed he was wearing gloves and goggles and was operating with an intense level of caution and artistry. It was the first time she’d seen his wooden structures, beautiful, sweeping things that belonged in a museum. The scent of varnish made her nose tingle pleasantly. She let him be.
“For god’s sake, guys,” Nat sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “Can we not—?”
and for him to be T’Challa’s first choice—
Bucky nodded jerkily then stood, feeling off-balance and unsteady in a way that was more mental than physical.
you. You’re cool and you bought my art. But I want my dad too.” He agitatedly rubbed the back of his neck, an upset furrow between his brows and the color high on his cheeks. “If you weren’t cool I’d take my dad’s side.” Then he glared up at her mutinously, as if daring, maybe hoping, that she’d contradict. “But he screwed up too, right? I mean...like when you guys came last time things got fixed pretty quickly, right? Maybe,” he choked off and Toni watched helplessly as his eyes filled with tears, “maybe it could’ve been fixed a-a-and dad- dad-”
before she left the hall earlier; she could tell by the gritty sound of his voice. “Neither the Panel nor the Subcommittee members were made aware of this so I took it upon myself to inform those that had been appointed so far.”
Bucky recalled the way Steve’s throat had worked around his next words. “December sixteenth, nineteen-ninety-one.” His fists had shook by his side. “The day Toni lost her parents. The day…”
Shuri grinned, bright, warm and real. “Invitation gladly accepted.”
Rogers and his stupid letter and his stupid phone. She’d done the same thing and left Rhodey and Pepper and Happy and Vision a fucking
She didn’t really know what to say to that and shrugged helplessly, Cloak’s collar nuzzling into her neck as she did so. “I’m...sorry?”
began seeping out from the sides of the lid.
Shuri stared at him, her brows furrowed, nervous and unsure, and Bucky felt a pang of guilt for his unnecessary outburst but he just had to
“As for your arm.” She paused and he resisted the urge to reach up and grasp his stump of a shoulder. “Vision and I have constructed the parts for a new one.
“That’s no- Jesus, that’s not the point. Speed healing’s great and all but you could’ve, you could’ve called me and I would’ve come help-”
“Sorry,” she apologized, scratching her temple and getting dirt everywhere. “I have this tendency to make everything about me.” She paused for a moment before adding, “You really should punch Clint, though. I hear it’s therapeutic. So’s shouting. And angry makeup sex according to TV.”
“That’s what I like about you, you know?” Laura said suddenly, and Toni only just managed to hide her surprise at her words. “You don’t just fix things. You look for ways to
“Still wish you were here?” she asked, dropping the rod onto the metal tray and it landed with a dull clang.
Seven words shouldn’t have been able to pack such a punch that they rendered him entirely hollow.
The world came back in the blink of an eye and she squeezed hers shut, rubbing at her heavy lids.
She felt a smile curl its way onto her lips. “Toni’s favorite.”
“It’s, uh,” he said, sounding choked and Toni hung back and just watched his back while Cloak fondly nuzzled her neck. “It’s spectacular, Toni.”

of rage. Not that anyone can blame him. Lang’s just an asshole all the time and he didn’t know us well before so I discount pretty much everything he says.” Sam rolled his eyes and it cracked a smile from Steve.
Blonde hair. That was the first thing she noticed. Not even a strawberry blonde. Just. Blonde. Toni couldn’t help but notice how well it suited her. She still preferred the red, though. It was nostalgic. Although that was probably an indicator that she shouldn’t prefer red. Clinging too tightly to things from the past created too much resistance when she had a world to change.
Some unnamed emotion crossed Van Dyne’s face but it didn’t seem that she disagreed with the sentiment.
Kids needed to be around people their own age regardless of whether they were masquerading as a superhero by night or taking part in princessly duties by day. So she didn’t take pleasure in having to interrupt their nerdy bonding session before it got underway but she was on a tight schedule here.
His footsteps stalled for a bare second before he made his way towards her and around the counter to settle into the stool opposite her.
When she moved to shake his hand, he took hers gently in both of his and squeezed with a familiarity that threw her. This wasn’t a standard Wakandan greeting, she knew.
“Yeah,” he said, looking down first at his metal palm - where Stark had pressed her own only moments ago - then back at Stark, who was already hunched over a monitor. Back in the observation room Steve was also staring at Stark’s back, but he smiled, if a little tired and strained, when he locked eyes with Bucky.
In the end, Helen had to use a circular saw to cut through Barnes’ bone with a sound that was the stuff of gratuitously gory movies and made Toni’s stomach turn unpleasantly.
And yet she was still here, determinedly partaking in the extremely thorough but straightforward presentation, and occasionally shooting discreet looks in his general direction, as if she needed to make sure he was still following.
As she turned back around, her hand landing on the door handle, her gaze locked with gray-green eyes, pale and stormy and tinged with a
Steve, who didn’t appear to have moved an inch from his position directly in front of the glass for the last ten hours.
Toni had taken in the hardness of her tone and the stubborn set of her jaw and replied quite simply, “Fine.”
She looked up, straight into the camera and Steve was lost.
Vision looked down at her curiously. “Not Mr. Barton?”
She pulled herself out of fighting stance and cocked her hip to the side, regarding him coolly. “You are

She was dragging T’Challa towards the car before he had a chance to speak. As they pulled out off the beach, he saw Agent Fern and her cleanup crew arrive in their standard AMOTF vehicles. Toni spared a quick nod for her before they passed one another.
Bucky stilled, staring at the woman, his gaze sliding to the door behind her and the hallway that led to the operating theatre that was apparently one of the more recent additions to the Compound.
She turned and waited under the scrutiny of that old -
“She was my mentor at one time,” he remarked, considering. “Perhaps, had I been more self-aware at the time I would have considered her my friend as opposed to merely an ally. But the lines these days are...blurry.”

laughed when Harley said something to her, and the genuine happiness on her face when she reached up and Spider-Man took her hand and lifted her thirty feet off the ground was...beautiful. Beautiful in a way that made him increasingly aware of the empty space inside where she had once fit.
. The entire concept was stupid and impossible, of course, but self-help books and zen blogs made a killing off promoting the so-called silencing of the mind.
“I will.” She looked up and surveyed the rest of the team in various stages of pre-sleep. With a huff, she added, “There’s nowhere else I could go anyway.”

“No more than usual.”
There was a lengthy beat of quiet, the only sound in the room being the near imperceptible murmur of machinery running through the walls and beneath their feet, and the
Then he rolled his sleeves up just below his elbows and held both his hands out, palms softly glowing a light gold. Toni chose to remain silent, still a little bewildered by the entire exchange, and just stood there with Cloak wrapped almost reassuringly around her.
“I dare say I’m richer than you.”
Having gotten herself under control during FRIDAY’s little spiel, Laura sat up straighter, still a little disconcerted by the fact that she was talking to a
And through it all none of them said a word to one another.

He gave her a withering look. “I’m angry at a lot of things.”
But Bucky, who was right here, saw something more than just the pride of a triumphant, successful creation. There was a delicacy to her touch, a gentleness that all the men and women who had ever used him never had. The arm wasn’t a weapon to her; she looked at it as she had her bots, held it aloft with the same hands she had stroked Dummy’s claw with, looked at it with as much affection as she did Butterfingers, murmured words under her breath in the same tone of voice she had used on You.
The door hissed open again at her proximity, making her jump, and she released a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.
. He fell onto his back for the second time that afternoon, feeling the uncomfortable fizz of the powerful EMP generated by Okoye’s staff still reverberating in his bones.
It took five of them to remove the final piece, having to work double time against the blood coming out of the actual open wound that was Barnes’ shoulder and against the fact that his healing factor was going a little haywire.

Peter and Harley were in one of the other control rooms experimenting on god knows what. She suspected they were trying to create a skateboard that could beat the sound barrier judging by the three explosions she’d heard so far, followed by an unrepentant duet of, “We’re okay!”

In a way she was glad T’Challa wasn’t around just so she wouldn’t have to see his I-told-you-so face, which he was probably too dignified so show anyway, but she’d certainly feel his disapproval.
Maria didn’t even flinch.
Agent Fern, less stiff than Hill but a hell of a force to be reckoned with, had rolled her eyes as she left the room earlier in a very uncharacteristic show of emotion.

“Yeah, well. The Compound may be funded by me but it falls under the Council’s jurisdiction. At least until the Panel is formed. And seeing as legal’s already drafting up a contract a hotel would just be a waste of money. Besides,” she said, finally glancing up from her work, “friends close, enemies closer, right?”
Something grim crossed over Bucky’s expression as he looked from Shuri to Helen, to Toni and finally to Steve, who could do nothing else but step closer to the glass, wishing he could be in that room.

It was funny how Bucky, larger-than-life Bucky, managed to look small in that bed, in that room, in the middle of all these competent doctors walking back and forth, checking and re-checking equipment. He looked paler than usual in his white shirt and against the black leather of the operating table.
“Rogers, you asshole,” she muttered, glaring at the floating screens and swiping them all down with a violent gesture.
When it
Can we just talk about Peter, please, and how much I love his relationship with Tony? I mean. I MEAN. I can't, guys, I just love the two of them so much.
. And it was hurtful and shitty like an endless ball of string all tangled up and there was no way to loosen the knots and turn it back into something solid again. Because the kinks would always remain, every counterclockwise twist and every fray a scar, a reminder of what they broke.
“Clint is,” she began, then cut herself off. “I dunno about Clint. He’s...going through some stuff.”
“That I have. It’s gonna be wild,” she said, with a croak in her voice that told Rhodey she hadn’t slept since their mission. “She’s in the lab with Vision as we speak. It’s all very hush hush. Way above your clearance level. I’ll fill you in on everything tomorrow, Honey Bear.” She winked and he laughed softly, gingerly settling onto the stool next to her, wincing as his tired muscles twinged beneath his sweaty undersuit and his braces clicked against the stool legs. “Guessing you guys turned up with nothing?”
There was nothing she could say to that and the raising of Toni’s eyebrows seemed to say
“She still reports in to Fury and Coulson, told us so the second she got back here. But we keep some stuff on a low-key, need-to-know basis in case either one of them starts getting ideas again.”
When all else failed, beating the hell out of a punching bag helped get his head straight for a little while.
With a flick of his wrist, the holographic interface appeared and Clint realized it for what it was; a phone.
“It doesn’t hurt,” he whispered, and she pretended not to notice the way his eyes glistened just a little more than a few moments ago. “It feels…” His voice cracked at the last word and he had to clear his throat, staring at his palms the way Rhodey had stared at his legs the first time he had walked by himself. “It feels like before.”
- that she wasn’t going to wake up again. But she had. And she’d woken up alone. And that had been that.
Toni nodded, mostly to herself. When Natasha risked a glance at Vision, she was pinned in place by his impenetrable arc reactor blue eyes. There was something dangerous there. How dangerous, she couldn’t yet ascertain. His quiet demeanor and near impenetrable facade had made him something of a wild card.
Up ahead Steve was leaning with his forearm pressed against the glass. He tried for a reassuring if pained smile when he met Bucky’s gaze, but his eyes kept traveling to Stark’s tense form and the smoking can.

“He told you about your parents’ death at the hands of the Winter Soldier.”
, Toni.” And there was understanding in the way he said it, as if he had somehow reached inside of her and touched upon a raw nerve and found that it resonated with the same frequency of pain as something inside of himself. “It’s just a thing. Just another one of your many creations.”
Either T’Challa got tired of waiting for an answer or he’d never expected one in the first place, for he dug into his pocket and pulled out something thin and metallic. It looked vaguely familiar but it was embedded with a glowing lattice of what was undoubtedly vibranium.
“I’m just doing it to distract you.”
Steve stopped breathing.
“Ah, right,” he said, leaning against the skeleton of what was going to be a control panel. “Secret identities and all. Nice work on that, by the way.”
. Embarrassment warred with indignation and finally reluctant understanding that she was one of those so-called pretentious people. Because she didn’t know what she was doing here, why she came, why she thought it would be a good idea to stop by. But she also kind of
Natasha froze.
And then I think about how much
Shuri. Genius princess and head of all things tech and cool in Wakanda.
Natasha felt like a stranger in her own home. Everywhere she looked, everything she touched and everything she did felt out of sync, like she was one step behind or too far ahead from where she needed to be.
“Know what, Toni?”
That was probably codeword for ‘as long as you think you need until you can clean up this mess you made.’ She would take it.
“Okay.”

“Both,” Steve said quietly, somehow managing to make it sound like a
the fifth time she’d called to highlight yet another aspect of the Accords she wanted them to try and break down, and then she’d promptly hung up, already very intimate with Toni’s haphazard and oftentimes manic way of thinking.
“Sorry, sorry,” she said, walking around Bucky’s bed, switching on one of the large monitors that hung from the ceiling and angling it over the bed. “That was Shuri. She said she’s good to video in on the surgery if you’re still good with that, Barnes.”

but he didn’t have to because she heard it all the same.
Any questions?”
, and her heart would’ve shattered right there. But she wouldn’t give him that chance.
“No,” Rhodey said immediately and Toni tried to bite down on the sting she felt at the sharp rejection. “Look,” he said, rubbing a hand down his face, “it’s nothing like that. Don’t freak out. Just, I’m not the one you need to be worrying about right now. You’ve got this and SI stuff to deal with as well. Sleep in or something. I just don’t want you to burn out before we’ve even started. Let me deal with my shit and I’ll come back and we can get back to this, okay?”
And while he didn’t expect Spider-Man to be present and figured Rhodey didn’t have much of a reason to witness the surgery, Nat’s absence was...disappointing, and left an unsteady, bitter feeling in his chest.
Looked like there was no getting out of that. Steve sighed and stood up straight, absently rubbing the bruise on his side.
Three days. It’d been
. All they could do after this was wait.
She smiled, and it was bright and cheeky, though the edges hardened when she met Toni’s eyes and, oh.
Because it was so fucking easy, wasn’t it?
the clang of metal against metal rang throughout the lab.
Toni worried a loose thread on her sleeve between her fingers. She knew the political atmosphere in Wakanda wasn’t the greatest at the moment and that T’Challa’s presence in his homeland was paramount to easing said tensions, but if Shuri’s sad eyes and her honest desperation were anything to go by, Toni had completely underestimated just how much stress he must be under.
“Message me the second he’s free and I’ll get right on that,” she promised, and Shuri’s grateful relief was palpable through the screen.
He’d gone too far.
“People always should’ve listened,” Rhodey pointed out. “But I agree,” he acquiesced, “that the introduction of the Accords in the first place could’ve gone better. We could’ve made people more receptive, ease them into the idea that a level of control was always going to be necessary.”
“Black P’nthr? ‘E’s the...the cat guy...e’s cool.”
. That’s. That’s bigger than you know.”
The first night back in the Compound Toni carried a proverbial iron cross and let it guide her away from every single room that contained potential memories, both imaginary and
pretty fat.
“Leng, then,” she revised.
For Stark it was a study in pain as she came to a stop, her gaze fixed on an immovable point somewhere over Colonel Rhodes’ shoulder.
“Are you
She felt him before she heard him, which was an accomplishment in itself given the acoustic quality of the halls. His presence, the
“If all goes to plan, your healing factor combined with our tech should kick in enough to heal a lot of the tissue and nerve damage caused by your current implant, so by the time we fit in the new shoulder you should notice a significant improvement in terms of both pain and mobility,” Doctor Cho was saying, and floating over the center of the table was a diagram of his torso and Bucky watched as at least three inches of flesh and bone around his severed shoulder reconstructed itself. “HYDRA’s tech was admittedly ahead of its time but the neural implants aren’t compatible with the human body, even one as enhanced as yours, Sergeant.”
Ten minutes later Hope rushed in, already in the middle of pulling on her gloves. Hopefully her expertise on body morphing would come in handy for Kamala who had already flatlined once until Toni used their only Hulk-grade defibrillator and charged it up so high that even Thor would’ve felt a bit of a tickle.
He knew what the others were thinking. What’re you doing, Barton? Why’re you taking so long? Dude, just fucking
knows. There are even people who support you. Some for very good and valid reasons some simply because Captain America is a national icon and could never do any wrong. But that is not the issue. The real reason why you have not returned is because you are afraid.”
There were many things she could’ve said. Many more that she
The others lingered awkwardly. Bucky made an aborted move to touch the metal shoulder cap then dropped his flesh hand, letting it fall to his waist where he clenched the material of his white t-shirt. Clint leaned against the fridge with his arms crossed, looking away and Wanda’s gaze darted nervously between Steve and Clint and Vision, who had proceeded to clean up the empty mugs and plates Steve hadn’t even noticed on the counter. Nat’s lips were turned down in a grimace, her stance tense.
She shook the thought away. Rhodey she would only deal with if he let her.
Anyways, I shall catch y'all tentatively next week :)
,” he added with a smirk, making her grimace. “Besides,” he said idly, finishing off the last dregs of his ginger beer, “I don’t need superpowers to take over as Iron Man once you retire.”
Stephen’s lips twitched and his eyes lost some of their worry. “I suppose. She did almost send herself crashing through the ceiling just now. Anyway. I’m sure you came here for reasons
“Okay, Steve.”
He also noticed a lightness to Stark’s work now, noticed how her fingers seemed to caress the metal after she fitted in a new panel. Her thumb would rub across the grooves between the panels and she would squint as she ensured each component was properly fitted.
- or he might have reached out to her with his one flesh hand, let it hover in the air before dropping it by his side in resignation.
“Anything.”
“I’m sure it is,” was her serene reply.
I mean can you
she thought, with a wave of indignation. A second after that she was being gently hauled in and found herself enveloped in his arms, her face pressed into the warmth of his chest.
Natasha watched her for a moment, then tilted her head towards the chair, a request.
It was very obviously not directed at her and Toni wasn’t expecting it to be anyway. Still, she felt Rhodey bristle, uttering something under his breath and that...that had to be enough.
She chuckled mirthlessly. “Some of it, yeah.” And massive understatement. “There’s a lotta people I need to convince first before I can make things happen. And there are going to be conditions.”
“On most people, perhaps,” he interrupted.
We're getting real close to the where the story REALLY kicks off, guys! I mean it's only been goddamn 70,000 words give or take so far, I mean what. Why am I like this?
“I know.”
was worth it. And she could argue day and night that she was just paying back a debt but only she ever had to know that she’d fallen in love with said family who’d taken her in and put her pieces back together just enough to get her on her feet again and give her a purpose.
“Is it?” he asked, smiling humorlessly. He stared at the opposite wall, grim shame emanating off of him in waves as he said quietly, “I hurt her.”
went unsaid. For a long moment an uncomfortable silence pervaded the lab and Bucky could picture Steve’s grim expression without even having to look.
“I heard that Nadja Kankaraš was appointed as the Sokovian Panel Head. She is a good and smart woman.”
“You got a tan.”
“What would you have me do, FRIDAY?” he asked and reached out to gently stroke Dummy’s camera unit in an attempt to ease the poor bot.
That was his curse, wasn’t it? That was
She laughed, and it was high and somewhat disbelieving, embedded with an emotion that Peter couldn’t quite grasp. “You’d be the first. But I appreciate the sentiment, Petey.”

Another image flashed behind his eyes. A shield. An arc reactor.
“I know you’re extremely busy with everything. I heard you’re organizing a trip to Lagos to meet with the victims and their families. It’s a good tactic-”

“You know where everything is. West Wing’s off limits for everybody else, though. As usual.”
she just thought she was doing the right thing.
but attributed it to the fact that Peter probably thought this entire exchange was a dream anyway.
She didn’t even think Toni knew the concept.
The Vision has entered Designation: Room 1.
Neither one spoke so she sat opposite them and clasped her hands together on the table.
“This early?”
And without thinking, Bucky squeezed back.
“Hey,” she said, turning her body fully towards Nat’s so their knees brushed. This, too, was familiar. “It’s gonna be okay. Seriously. You’re their friend. They trust you. A
Bucky looked at the back of Toni’s head as he spoke. “Yeah,” he said quietly, cleared his throat, then said again louder, “Yeah, that’s...that’s fine.”

her fingers until they released their vice grip on her bare flesh.
“The arc reactor that was in your chest.” Laura motioned to it with her chin. “Where’s the light gone?”
Also, thank you to everyone who has left me comments/messages here and on Tumblr, asking after my wellbeing and just checking in with me. That is so sweet of you and I feel incredibly humbled by your well wishes and kind words, so truly, madly, deeply, thank you.
Next to him Bucky swallowed and nodded. “Yeah. I’m...whenever you’re free I’d like...if the arm can be installed then— then that would be great.” He held his breath then added in a softer tone that twisted at Steve’s heart, “Please?”
When Hope spoke next, it was quiet but poignant enough to slice through the easy camaraderie that had enveloped the room.
“I would be very grateful if you could make a call.”
it seemed that in her pure enjoyment of talking to Shuri and Helen and just allowing herself to
“Well, when we’re running on an average of three hours of sleep per night, we better be,” Natasha remarked dryly, and Toni could see the past couple of weeks of conferences and meetings with ambassadors had taken a toll on her. Her smile was pleased, though, and soft around the edges; Toni felt something achingingly tight inside of her give way a little.

“All these food metaphors are making me hungry,” Scott grumbled from where he leaned on the balustrade overseeing the fight. He hastily backtracked when he caught Ayo’s narrowed gaze. “Not that we’re not being fed. Because we are. Like a lot. And really, Wakandan food man. Good stuff.”
But the fate of the world had never been in the balance before. Not until recent years, anyway. So she began with honesty. Because, as she’d discovered very early on in life, honesty was sometimes the best defense.
Days later and he was still wondering how they were going to fix this.
oversimplification even by Toni’s standards. And also kind of a lie.
He motioned to the girl’s hand and it was indeed, much to Toni’s extreme panic, the size of a small dog
of scarlet that made the smile slowly slip off her face.
Through the corner of her eye she felt Hope studying her.
She raised her tired eyes and looked back.
if they make any allusions to knowing that I have granted sanctuary to Captain Rogers and his friends.”
. I’m at least infinity times worse than the rest of them,” Toni pointed out, then took a long sip from her thick, sticky-sweet tea.
Laura never said anything, though. In fact, aside from the first day she didn’t make much mention of Clint at all, save for when her kids asked about him and

“And one more person was also only human.”
She angled her head a little, becoming aware of his imposing presence in her periphery.
“Look, I understand if you don’t want to join the Avengers anymore after...everything. But I just wanted you to know...there’s a place for you here. We’d be lucky to have you on the team and I’d vouch for you. Or, it doesn’t have to be me, I mean Rhodey’s awesome and so’s Vision so if you’d prefer one of them-”
She couldn’t begrudge him for it. It was, perhaps, the biggest move by any monarch in Wakandan history.
Ellis’ lips twitched minutely and he took in a slow, thoughtful breath. “I know what you’re here to talk about.” That didn’t come as a surprise to either of them. “Do you know how many pardons I’ve issued in my time as president?” He shrugged and leaned back in his seat. “Zero. And now you want me to issue
. Just let the thoughts come, be mindful of them, and let them leave when they wanted to, without actively forcing anything.
Because if it didn’t, Steve didn’t know how he was going to be able to do this.
The meeting lasted until after dark and by that point everyone was hungry and even the two Dora looked like they were itching to get into some civilian clothes. Toni for her part hadn’t slept in thirty-two hours so it was perhaps her compromised judgment that made her suggest they head into the city for dinner.
Objectively he knew, he
She’d left Rhodey alone.
She stood there breathing hard, distantly aware of the heat in her cheeks and the prickling at the corners of her eyes.
Now there was this, their choices between them and the infinite unspoken things laid out on the ground, as delicate as eggshells.
“Be safe, okay?” was all he said,
He brought up all the salient points. Masks. The importance of anonymity of their heroes - that was still a long way in the making. The unjustifiable risk of taking too long to come up with a decision when a crisis was looming overhead. It was only the first session of the first day and already Toni knew he’d made an impact.
“I heard,” T’Challa murmured, giving her hand a squeeze. He wasn’t happy about the Council’s impromptu request
“I know you can.”
“Are those vegan?” he asked by way of greeting and Toni nodded distractedly, pushing the huge plate in the center of the island top towards him.

A kiss.
“I think the suit’s awesome, and no, I’m not jealous that she’s got superpowers.
“Captain Rogers.”
“Is that-?”
She thought about the pings to her phone, indicating the number of times he’d asked FRIDAY if she would let him know when Toni was free.
“I...don’t understand,” he murmured, gripping the handle of his mug. “I’m not an Avenger.”
A second later Rhodey’s tense voice sounded in her ears. “Ditto on my side. The building’s shaking real bad. I’m hearing a bunch of micro-explosions. This thing’s going down! Iron Man, get everyone back-!”
Toni’s breath caught in her throat.
“We’re working on it,” Toni answered and Nat knew it to be the truth since she’d been reviewing his case files only this morning. It was only a matter of time. For

And Bucky had watched as Steve
That got him a flicker of surprise and perhaps a little pinkness to her cheeks. “I’m—”
He was almost grateful when she walked around him, giving his entire body a wide berth as she made her way to the exit, so that she wouldn’t have to see him physically
“And who the fuck’re
“How do you figure?”
“So you’re saying we were doomed from the start,” Steve laid out and it made Sam laugh. Steve had missed that. Missed seeing his team, his

“This is very good work.” T’Challa scanned through his own draft contract, nodding at the extra precautions they’d taken due to him being royalty as well as masked. “Once these contracts become public knowledge, I foresee that enhanced individuals will be more willing to approach us.”
“All taken care of,” was her cool, detached response. She was mad at him; everybody could tell but Clint seemed to be equally mad at her too.
A harsh sound left her throat, carrying with it a note of disgust, of sorrow and, worst of all, resignation, as if she was telling herself that she shouldn’t have expected anything less.
Now, though, the very practice was tainted by the lie.
“Sorry if I woke you.”
“Did he...say anything to you about the Accords?”
But after Bucky had passed him the document he’d been...surprised. Doubtful. Suspicious. A lot of it still filled him with indignation and he recognized the blunt and matter-of-fact style that Shanthi McMahon was known for.
Every one of them could have been his last one.
Peter sniped.
“FRIDAY,” she said, licking her lips. “What was the reaction time on that?”
“Come on. Again,” Okoye said, interrupting the direction his bitter musings were taking him. “Focus on the senses that matter. Never take a hit unless you cannot help it. What did they teach you in that army of yours?” The last part she muttered to herself, then nodded for her sisters to take their positions.
“And now you’re king,” she agreed softly. She licked her lips and leaned forward. “If you want, the next time you’re in the country I’ll build a pillow fort with you.”
He pushed her hair out of her face and studied her carefully. “Are you okay?”
The sound of breaking glass.
, Ms. Stark please don’t start crying-”
“In that case,” Shuri spoke up finally, stepping around her brother, a fiesty glint reflected in her dark eyes, “spar with me, Captain.” His surprise and uncertainty must have shown, for she grinned cheekily, a far cry from her earlier impassiveness. “Okoye has been teaching me one on one.”
A warm feeling entered his chest. Shuri had been coldly polite to Toni during every interaction, something T’Challa had not anticipated in advance, nor was her certain of its origin. Every time he tried to speak to her about it she clammed up and remained mutinously silent. Toni never seemed to hold anything against her, though, never treated her with anything other than kindness and oftentime genuine admiration. Knowing Toni did indeed like his sister and her verbal affirmation of the fact gave him nothing but pleasure.
underneath it. It filled him with something strange and stirring in his chest. Something like amusement. Maybe.
There were high points of color on her cheeks and her short hair was frizzing in the heat. She looked unraveled, and she was so, so angry. But so was he.
“I asked KAREN to show me recordings of your heroic escapades,” she admitted immediately. “For...science. Kind of.”
“Oh yeah? Which one?”
as he lowered her to the ground, and Steve’s hand was pressed up against the glass, his heart thundering in his ears.

There was something stormy in her tone, a gray, deeply felt sadness that resonated with him, an echo familiar to the bleak emptiness he’d felt when his cousin had died at his own hands. How he wished he could have saved him.

She hummed as they pulled away, her fingers briefly touching the amulet before they separated.

“Toni Stark and Colonel Rhodes.” Ellis’ lined face morphed into something both dignified and reasonable, a man willing to listen, a man who had perhaps already made up his mind but was willing to hear them out anyway. “I’ve been looking forward to this meeting for a few months now.

He huffed in amusement. “I’d argue with you about the international fugitive part but I don’t wanna fight when you’ve only just got here.”
“Toni.” It was the chastising tone that made her lift her gaze from the table. “You have to know. If I wanted to be in Wakanda sitting around with the rest of the team I would be. But I’m not. I’m
Because once again, Bucky had been braver than him,
Or maybe it had been in a bedroom at the end of the hallway of a house on a farm. When the world was falling apart around their ears. When her mattress had dipped with a solid weight. Familiar fingers lacing themselves through hers. The heat of murmured breath. The tip of a nose and the flutter of her eyelashes.
“C’mon, Cap.”

“How long have you been planning this heist anyway?” Coulson asked, sounding genuinely interested in hearing the answer, though Toni knew that the light-heartedness of the query was finely staged. “I’ve gotta say you didn’t do it very well, all things considered,” he remarked, flipping through his tablet. “I mean this isn’t really HYDRA’s MO, is it? You guys tend to be more...insidious. I mean you infiltrated SHIELD, didn’t you? But this one with Roxxon?” Coulson made a small, unimpressed noise and shook his head. “It just seemed a little…” He glanced up and Toni noted the deceptively lazy look that he pinned the operative with. “Amateurish,” he finished boredly in a way that was meant to rankle.
“Steve should go with you,” Nat interrupted. “For moral support,” she explained when they both looked at her. “And it’ll be good for more than just you to understand the procedure. Helen and Toni will understand.”
“You believe I took a side.”
, Steve.”
It was Bucky’s reaction to his contract that was Steve’s main concern. When Natasha had mentioned there would be conditions regardless of whether he chose to be an Avenger or live a civilian life, Steve had expected the worst.
Not that Vision was a kid. But then again, she thought, he kind of was. Barely more than a year old.

“I don’t know how to convince you of how important this is anymore than I already have. You’ve seen the news. You’ve seen what the world has to say.” She looked down at her hands resting on top of the empty stand. They were shaking. “We started with one hundred and seventeen countries. And today...one hundred and eighty-four. That’s...amazing, isn’t it?” She smiled into the sea of faces. “What we’ve done...what

“And that completes the Panel,” Rhodey concluded, browsing through the seven Panel heads and nodding at their credentials.
Laura was openly smiling now and it lit up her face like a slow-burning candle, warm and eternal.
“Your Highness. Princess,” he greeted, trying for a smile but fairly certain he fell short.
“Hello?”

“Who’s with him?”
“I take it that hasn’t happened before?” she asked needlessly.
“I meant what I said earlier, you know?” she said, sounding serious but earnest. “Doctor or no, we can do a lot more than regenerate a couple more inches of flesh and bone. I think today has shown that. You do good work, Toni. As Iron Man, at Stark Industries and in there.” She tilted her head in the direction of the operating theatre. “You’ve always said that you fix things, and it’s true. Now you can say that in some ways you fix people too. And I’m not just talking about Sergeant Barnes.”
“Well?” he prompted flatly.

“That’s nice for them. Sounds like they’re setting up shop as best as they can.” She licked her lips and stared at the green slush inside her glass. “Do you know,” she began slowly, feeling every word spoken, “that no one came for me?” Once they were out, it suddenly felt

Toni set her kale down and faced Laura, their knees almost touching. “For leaving?”
Would she have?
But Toni just rolled her eyes and looked away, her whole body heaving over a sigh that came impressively,
Wanda watched her from the floor below, her hands hanging loosely by her side but her fingers were curling and uncurling, languidly manipulating only the air. Though there was no sign of red, the sight of them moving like that, like a
Hope and Lang followed, hand in hand, Lang practically clinging to her. It was that that made her call out once more.
So might be a good idea to bring this up to him first before, just to give him a heads up.”
They watched Shuri and Vision work for a while, the comments passed back and forth and the almost artful way they’d learned to work with and around one another. At one point Shuri turned around and stilled somewhat at seeing Toni there. But rather than look away immediately and go back to work, she offered a small, tentative smile that Toni returned in equal measure.
“I got pizza.”
T’Challa gave him a nod when he glanced over for the sake of courtesy.
T’Challa nodded.
They stayed like that in companionable silence for a long time, just sitting there knowing they were just one other side of the phone from one another.
“Ms. Stark, they’re ready for you,” she called, straight-backed and hands clasped at her front. She gave T’Challa a lingering look but otherwise said nothing.
It was one of the smallest and most powerful weapons she had ever created. It was also one of the most cruel, crueler than the one Obie had used on her. It was one of the reasons she had destroyed all of them. Or thought she had.
After a long moment Ayo spoke again, her voice barely a decibel gentler. “I am not saying you do not have a right to be angry at your friends, at yourself, at the world or at the Accords. I am not saying that your fear is baseless. But
, “I think I’d like that. I’d like that very much. Thank you.”
There were reassuring whispers in her ear and soft hands removing the baby weight from her arms, and then she was running and skidding across gravel and grass and falling to her knees just as she threw herself into a pair of open arms.
Toni didn’t even blink.
“Yeah. When. I meant what I said before. That I was...” She shrugged. “That I was working on a way to get them back. To bring them here.” She’d almost said ‘home’, a concept she wasn’t sure applied to anything anymore. They weren’t a family regardless of how much certain members, certain members that may even have included herself, wanted them to be.

“- and yet you are one of the most powerful women in the world,” he finished primly, using the Mind Stone to solder two panels together and Toni had to bite back her reservations on the recommended functionality of the gem.
Vision didn’t even take a second to think. Then again he wouldn’t. Synthezoids and eidetic memory went hand in hand.
It had been a week since the surgery and three days since Helen had flown back to Seoul with her team, declaring that if Bucky’s body hadn’t rejected the implant yet the chances of it doing so any time soon were next to nil and that he could get the arm installed as soon as he felt like it.
T’Challa squeezed her hands and helped her to her feet, patiently waiting while she gathered herself together.

Hey guys. So, I know I've disappeared for like, three months. And I'm really sorry about that. I'm really, really, REALLY sorry about that. Life has been a mess and I've had zero time to write and getting this chapter out was like pulling teeth. My wonderful beta, Demigodscum, can attest to that (though she was very kind and very gentle with me when I was having multiple crises).

They breeze through, they do well in everything, they fight tooth and nail against one another and they succeed and become engineers and astronauts and lawyers and entrepreneurs and shit. Congrats to them. They earned it.” Just as Kamala started to frown, looking unsteady and a little hurt, Toni continued. “But not all kids are like that. Not all of them are brilliant all across the board. They can’t do sports or new languages blow their minds or all they wanna do is play lacrosse and video games or garden. Because that’s what they enjoy and that’s what they’re good at so they put their heart into it. Or maybe they can’t put their heart into anything because they haven’t

“Yes. We are.”
when she thought it would smack Shuri in the face, and suddenly Vision was there and he calmly caught it with one hand. Shuri laughed, delighted, and Vision smiled and handed the tool back to her.

about Toni only fueled his anger at the man further.
Bucky watched Steve too. In the nine months they’d been there, Wakanda had become a refuge and the Compound something hostile and unknown. He saw it in the broadness of Steve’s back and the tense line of his spine. He saw it in the clench of his jaw and the

Helen’s eyes crinkled in a smile. “We keep working together and one day we might actually be able to regrow his entire arm.”
to be right.
“It’s for you. It contains all the necessary contacts. But I think right now you’re only interested in one in particular.”
“It’s very sleek. Almost like a catsuit. Big fan of your work on the Accords, by the way. And of you in general. Went to a couple of your conferences but never got the chance to introduce myself. Can I sign one of those contracts?”
Toni managed a smiled as they traded muted banter under their breaths, neither one capable of keeping their hands off of each other. To make sure they were real, she realized.
Watching Helen work was always a study in accuracy and finesse. She was swift and efficient, constantly aware of everything happening around her at all times and every movement, every motion was both precise and practical.
She snorted and rolled her eyes because yeah, that was probably true.
It was humiliating.
“But-!”
. He heard the unspoken questions.
“I honestly don’t know,” she told him, shaking her head. “I wish I could tell you but I
“You could call too, Toni.” She’d been expecting it when all traces of warmth seeped out of Toni’s body and she went rigid and cold, so she didn't flinch. “Steve would answer,” she felt the need to reiterate.
She winced at the pang of guilt that zinged up her neck.
And it said everything.
He knew what he was.
“I’m Toni’s son. She dropped me on my dad’s doorstep three days after giving birth to me.”
“From distracting yourself.”
shoddy work.”
And then there were three.
“Was that a pun, Bagheera?”
“Just…” She felt the heat of her palms, the blood pulsing through T’Challa’s on the backs of her hands. “Be my conscience. Through all of this. Rhodey is too used to me being a total fuck-up and Vision is a dream but he’s so young and I can’t… Someone needs to hold me accountable. To punch me in the face when I go too far. I’m trying really hard not to make the same mistakes I did but I need-”
“You haven’t eaten in hours,” she said suddenly, apropos of nothing, then slid off her seat and proceeded to pull things out of the fridge. Fifteen minutes later and he had a generous portion of leftover fried rice and a rather massive, freshly-made omelette with onions and Chinese sausage in front of him, which he dug into with gusto.
. It would be easy for him, Toni thought, to block it out and just
“But I got a call about an evil mad scientist experimenting on people in Pittsburgh,” she finished for him. “I remember that day. They were supposed to be serving deep fried macaroni balls. I had to miss lunch.”
Natasha might have flinched. Toni didn’t know; she was busy trying not to throw up.
“Toni?” Pepper was reaching out for her, looking worried. “Honey, are you-?”
“This isn’t your usual training spot.”
Bucky stilled and could tell by the others’ looks that he wasn’t the only one who was confused.
He sighed. “Is it gonna be hard?”
The eldest two cheered, Nathaniel seemed happy to see his mother, and Toni...Toni felt
“No.”
“Is that an American thing?” Shuri asked, averting her attention from the cloak, who honest to god looked
They scrutinized one another and it was painfully nostalgic of the first time they’d met,
The lines of his shoulders stiffened and Toni was prepared for him to say no, until he moved and the backs of his hands rest gently,
“Of course.”
Maybe that was why they did it. Maybe Nat just wanted to protect herself, protect what they all had, for as long as it lasted.

She’d been trying not to project. Clearly her efforts had been for nothing.
“Good idea,” she said, and there was a pounding behind her eyes. “Very...very good. Makes sense. They’ll listen to you.”
. “You are not him. You said so yourself. You are not
“No, I know, Pep. I know. It wasn’t
When she looked back up at him again, she managed a small, bitter smile as she said, believing every single word she spoke,
“If you want, you can leave everything to Princess Shuri. She can do this from start to finish. You do not have to put yourself through it. It is not your responsibility, Toni.”
much nerve damage but we’ll just have to wait and see.”
Then he began to rope them around his arms, his eyes wide and worried the entire time.
They didn’t look at each other; maybe it was fear, fear of seeing the lie, fear of being caught out. Maybe it was just too hard.
She had to learn one of these days that she wasn’t going to be able to control every situation she got herself into, that no matter how hard a grip she had on the reins, a bucking horse was going to throw her off at some point.
“Well,” Toni remarked because she never took orders well and she felt like being a salty bitch because

and slung it over her shoulder, silently cursing herself for being slow on the uptake while this poor kid looked like she was literally falling apart at the seams.
She thought of him, sitting in a hospital bed while his legs atrophied, thought of him staring at the walls, lonely and angry, bitterness and resentment growing inside of him every day at the loss of what made him
Stark had murmured something to You, who responded with a sequence of musical beeps and nudged Stark on the shoulder in what could’ve been construed as a hug. She then tilted her visual input unit at Bucky in consideration, then gently patted him on his head with her claw before zooming off to the observatory window, where she greeted Steve with another series of excited, lyrical beeps.
“He kept on sticking his hand through one of his portals and making it reappear at different parts of the room. So
Helen nodded with a smile. “With a few modifications. I believe Toni is already in the process of creating his next pair of legs.”
She’d given him a hastily spewed explanation, something that went like, “I have got so much shit to do but it is going to be incredible and you will bow before me,” and had disappeared into her lab for three days before finally calling on him.
“Oh, I have many things to say, Steve,” she hissed, still staring ahead. “To you, to the rest of them and to Toni. But she’s got a lot on her plate right now so I guess we’ll just start with you.” She rounded on him and the blazing rage in her eyes and the immovability of her form made him stop in his tracks. “You fucking

“Spider-Man’s excited to work with you n’ see what you can do.”
“Hello, Toni.”
The only sound in the room.
Toni swallowed dryly.
Kamala, who had been practicing backbends with Lila, allowed one hand to leave the floor and held it out for Harley to take and pull her back up to her feet. She stumbled as she stood, laughing, and then crashed into him and Toni let her eyes linger on the way his hand hovered protectively over her waist, almost but not yet touching.
A sigh and another presence made itself known on his left. Sam.
Knowing that sleep wasn’t coming easy tonight, Toni crept her way into the hall, down the stairs and out the front door. The night was cool and the faint breeze made her long shirt waft up around her thighs. Her bare feet sank into the soft grass as she padded her way around the house. The horses made faint thumping noises against the barn walls and the leaves rustled overhead.
He was distantly aware of everyone else once again stopping in their tracks as he turned around and raised his eyes to meet hers.
“I wouldn’t let Thor throw you through a wall.”
From what Steve could ascertain he’d yet to call his wife and Steve wondered at the logic behind it. Then again.
could still be the glue that kept them together over the course of however long it was going to take to be okay again.
Vision attributed his desire to save as some form of humanity that he’d somehow attained. Friendship was a loud dinner around a table and easy banter. Happiness was the creases at the corner of Wanda’s eyes when she laughed. Amusement was the bots claw-painting something for Toni. Fondness was laying a blanket over Toni who had fallen asleep at her desk. Concern was Toni stepping out of a suit mid-battle to ease a child and her pregnant mother out of a ruined car while JARVIS, then FRIDAY, watched over her. Guilt was a friend falling and falling and crashing with a thunderous sound. Fear was wide brown eyes and blue lips, frost gathering on dark lashes. The flicker of an arc reactor.
Maria wasn't a perfect mother, so few mothers are, but she was doing her best.
That’s all.
She and Rhodey watched Ellis hum, studying them both in return. Rhodey didn’t break composure and Toni maintained eye-contact, waiting.
went unsaid but was undoubtedly evident in her expression.
“No promises,” she laughed over her shoulder.
When he looked at Bucky, Bucky looked back.
Vision tilted his head in honest curiosity. “Is she our enemy?”
Throat tight and tongue dry, Toni managed to rasp out two words.
. Like that woman who gave up her sex-fuelled life and hiked the Pacific Crest Trail. Or those people in Life Below Zero. Or that guy who gave up a cushy lifestyle to live in the wild only to die after accidentally consuming a poisonous plant.
“No,” she finally said, but admitting it did not feel like defeat. “No I can’t promise that even once we’ve managed to push all our changes through that there won’t still be things they...or
When they were gone, Toni shook her head and turned to Peter, who was still lingering, hands behind his back.

“So I’m in?”
and I am
“Steve!
He heard Steve’s slow and steady inhale, and saw his spine stiffen until it couldn’t get any straighter the closer they got to the room. Natasha’s heavy gaze shifted between him and Steve, but, like most Red Room graduates, she projected so little that had the Winter Soldier’s training not been instilled in him so deep, he would have barely registered her presence.
He didn’t say anything when she passed him her tablet; he simply took it as if he knew exactly what she wanted him to do with it. His hand spread across the back and absorbed all the necessary information contained within before he wordlessly handed it back to her.
But he had asked Toni—
“Spider-Man, what’s your status?” Toni demanded as she flew around the building, shooting a compound at all the strategic points to keep the building intact for just a bit longer.
And finally my boy, Peter~ I honestly love him so much, he is so precious <3
When he opened his eyes and looked at her, at the faint glimmer of hope in her green eyes that was slowly dwindling, he knew he couldn’t hold back any longer.
Even with one arm, even without the full extent of his memories, even when everything around them was going to shit, Bucky was with him. ‘Till the end of the line.
“It’s basically like this. Think...trying to get two sets of troubled kids from different parents to work together and live in the same house and only one set were actually picked to play on the school’s baseball team and the rest are reserve players or on the waiting list while they attend the requisite number of detentions. And in this scenario I’m a single mother and everybody hates my meatloaf.”
The image of Laura pretending to sleep while she waited on the off chance that Clint might be coming home to her made Toni grimace and she rubbed the bone around the arc reactor.
“My track record seems to suggest that I have a shitty way of treating friends,” she argued weakly, but didn’t pull away.

Hello everyone, and thank you all once again for all your lovely comments and kudos for the last chapter. I literally have a small conniption every time I get a message regarding this fic so I am super stoked that a lot of you seem to be enjoying it so far. :)
He nodded again, jerkily.
“I still do.”
He looked, if possible, even taller than before. Either that or she’d forgotten —
Exhaling heavily, she just stood and watched the video on repeat. It was fifteen seconds. She watched it twelve times before her legs finally gave way and she sank back into her chair. She watched it another five times before she had garnered enough bravery - or maybe it was just exhaustion and the inevitability of everything - to spin the chair around and look into the eyes of her guest.
Toni moved to the sofa in the lounge, sinking into the plush cushion as Nathaniel seemed to sink his little baby weight into her. She thought of Clint, sitting in this very sofa, his son in his arms, the sound of his family echoing from all parts of the house, the evening wind blowing outside. She couldn’t deny the appeal.
Shuri went on as if she hadn’t just dropped an atom bomb over his head, and to be fair she didn’t know the truth but it didn’t stop his muscles from stiffening as tension coursed through his bones.
“The least I can do. The drum was rattling and there was a bit of resistance in the drive belt that was always there. You won’t have any problems with those anymore.”
.” When her eyes started to water Toni felt the burn behind her own but forced them down. “They don’t deserve what you’re trying to do for them.”
With all their projects, hurried meals and countless phone calls and negotiations, Vision couldn’t help but be surprised that Toni had time to do something like this.

One cog for now. Just one. The rest could come later.
“Do I have to offer my arm?”
somehow take up a fast track biomedical engineering course while you were in Wakanda?”
Steve read through his contract once, twice, then went through it again more slowly this time, with a fine-tooth comb. He recognized that a lot of the issues he might have had about these contracts, specifically pertaining to him, had been circumvented in one way or another. It wasn’t perfect and he still made his own amendments here and there, but like the revised draft of the Accords, there were things he could stand by.
Toni slung an arm around his shoulders and squeezed and Harley willingly leaned into the half-embrace.
” Bucky spoke over Steve’s interruption, sending him a sharp look. “But I
“From what?”
Nat smiled back but for some reason it felt forced. “You too.”
It was like a sheer curtain being drawn across her features while her limbs mechanically lost their stiffness until she exuded an almost Natasha-like composure and professionalism as she turned to face them.
Kamala’s parents had been a little more lenient about her two-day disappearance when Toni had personally driven her home and made up some bullshit story about having found their daughter in the wrong part of town after sneaking out to a party and drinking something dodgy.
That’s...that’s awesome. Good work everybody. Okay. Okay, you keep an eye on that while I finish this baby up. Put her down, Barnes. I still gotta finish up the wiring and affix the rest of the plating.”
“Uh,” he began, then raised his hand in what must’ve been the most uncomfortable wave of his life. “Good morning.”

Toni shifted from foot to foot. “People can be good actors,” she argued but with little conviction.
She didn’t bring many clothes. She hadn’t
He stilled and set down his fork, looking out the floor-to-ceiling window and seeing something else entirely. She knew that look too.
“It is very good to see you again,” he said kindly. “I am...glad that you are looking better than when we last parted.”
She and T’Challa spent a long time planning out their pitch to the Council, and Vision helped to finetune T’Challa’s presentation on the individual hero contracts, walking T’Challa through the ones he and the legal team had drafted for the first time.
and it was the best thing ever. I remember all the boys in my class like, ewww, how can Iron Man be a
Her fingers met the cool metal of the Glock 26 but for the first time in her life, the feel of it failed to ease the quickening of her breath. Her heart lurched into her throat when Toni’s mouth stopped moving and she lazily glanced at Natasha through the corners of her eyes, like Toni knew exactly what she was doing.
And suddenly there was a niggling feeling at the back of her skull, a light, barely-there prodding of
And that. A young woman’s crushing disappointment over Toni’s failure as a hero and as a human being. That was infinitely worse than if Shuri had just hated her for being mean to her friend.
“I’d tell you to be careful with that but I already know you will, Princess.”
In the corner of her eye she saw trigger-worn fingers flex, the man they belonged to as taut as his weapon of choice.
to be free of her rather intrusive examinations. “I’ve never heard of it.”
“I don’t know,” he said slowly, keeping his eyes on T’Challa and wondering whether he was more the hurt-my-sister-and-you-will-pay or, even worse, an
Anyways, updates will start getting a little more spread out after this chapter, mostly because I'm still in the process of trying to write the next one. I've got a bunch written for AFTER but seeing as writing chronologically hasn't always worked well for me, this was bound to happen eventually :/
Or it could’ve been the week before she’d found out about the Accords and Rogers...
Stark worked with the curious combination of calm ferocity. Manic but methodical, precise but not always cautious if the numerous electrical burns and cuts on her fingers that she had sustained within the first hour were anything to go by.
“The choice,” he said, feeling the words in his mouth, rotating them around his molars - the ones he kept losing whenever he got punched in the jaw during his mission but kept growing back.
“Stark.” Red Cloak Man turned into Goatee Man as he floated down by her side and opened up giant orange sparkling circles - what the actual fuck - in front of him, then proceeded to fling them towards the building like frisbees. “Or should I call you Iron Man? Love the new suit, by the way.”
It hit him like a blow to the chest just how much of a precarious position T’Challa was in and he looked up, seeing the young king standing with his back to them, staring out of the window at the green cliffs behind the palace.
. “We have to tell them.”
It’s what she’d always done for better or for worse.
She really ought not to expect him to do anything other than what he had always done: find and protect her.
“Peter is…” Of course she knew his name. “Peter’s
“For what it’s worth from someone like me? You did real good, Peter.” She smiled. “I’m proud of you.”
“Sergeant Barnes,” came her polite voice, and Steve paused in surprise and slowly set down his tablet. “Boss and Doctor Cho are ready for you now.”
“Agent Coulson did imply that was the case. HYDRA did, after all, manage to remain undetected within SHIELD for longer than anyone could have imagined,” Vision supplied, ever cautious of his words and watching Nat closely. “Mr. Reeve’s demeanor indicates a certain degree of...overconfidence.”
Twenty-eight hours later the Council President stood up on the international stage in front of the whole world. His speech was eight minutes.
“And where is the old man anyway?” Rhodey queried over the rim of his orange juice.
Whatever he’d said, it made Rhodey smile. And to Toni that was all that mattered.
On the evening of the same day she found an old arrowhead near the fridge, one of the innumerous broadhead tips she’d made for him, embedded with tracking nanites. The arrowhead was long dead, the nanites disintegrated or crawling around the house. Holding the precious piece of metal in the center of his palm she made a mental note to gather them all up and any other errant tech that may be loose around the house before she left.

“I don’t recall you leaving the Compound.”
“You’re Iron Man. You’re the current leader of the Avengers.” She almost scoffed because she had three people and a baby spider. “You’re the face of the Sokovia Accords that is garnering worldwide response. You are a hero. And you are someone I would like to call my friend.” The last part was laid bare before her, a special kind of vulnerability that she didn’t feel she deserved because this was a king. This was the King of Wakanda, the most secretive and technologically advanced country in the entire world. And he wanted to call her ‘friend’.
“I’m going to be a florist,” she declared matter-of-factly, and Toni nodded sagely, pretty sure she’d informed her mother she planned on being a professional jouster the other day.
in general felt like a real squicky thing to do.
They filed out of the room, Toni coming up last after T’Challa. As the door hissed closed behind her she heard it, like an icy breath on the back of her neck.
Bucky saw something similar in Helen Cho as he did in Shuri.
Toni held his gaze for a long time, longer than she should have considering Happy was up ahead and waving at her in confusion.
“Why do you like him?” she reverted, keeping her tone light and curious. Because evidently Shuri had a soft spot for Barnes and if she was going to be spending copious amounts of time with him in the future she deserved to know at least one thing about him that wasn’t the Winter Soldier.
,” she reiterated, “can fix it.” She didn’t say ‘it’ll be like old times’ because there were some hurts that had yet to scab over completely. But she had visions of
So he’d cleaned everything up, spent three hours rearranging his bed, his desk, his side-table, the goddamn sofa that Sam had sneaked into his room more than a year ago because he needed space for his sound-system - it ended up being really comfortable and he’d fallen asleep on it more than once after a mission - and all the other knickknacks and miscellaneous junk he had lying around.
Harley narrowed his eyes and made a motion with his chin.
“Gee, thanks, Vision.”
Laura huffed. “To give you something to take your mind off of whatever happened. And maybe, when you’re ready, you can tell me about it.”
T’Challa clasped his hands on the table and leaned forward.
and her countless apologies. It was
“Toni.” A hand reached across her and took control of the wheel. “Let me drive,” he said gently, maneuvering her with such delicate ease from the driver’s seat to the passenger seat that he’d gracefully vacated. He barely shifted the car. His seat was warm and this part of the car smelled of his cologne.
He snorted and pushed up from the chair. “Why not?”
“Boss,” she said, sounding as urgent as an AI could, “someone’s just landed on the roof. West Wing, Building B.”
Maybe it would never have come to it. Maybe they could’ve taken it to the grave.
I have no excuse for how late this is other than the fact that LIFE happened in various tumultuous ways. I am so so sorry for how long it's taken me to get this chapter up and I'm sorry that I haven't replied to so many of your comments and your questions, but I promise you that I WILL get to them.
Toni recalled many a situation where Natasha’s singular brand of interrogation was required. She recalled the way Nat would smile, the way her voice would soften with an almost beguiling warmth as she made her marks feel victimized and wounded enough that
“I...I didn’t need you.” Then she turned around and finally
“That’s fine. Vision and I can get everything set up by tomorrow morning. Is that all?”

For a few brief moments there was blissful silence.

Then she pressed a warm, lingering kiss to her forehead and Toni closed her eyes, savoring the moment.
“I don’t really have a choice.”
Steve’s voice had cut off again and Bucky stepped up to his side, eyeing them one by one, watching as silent realization and
with them, Toni had forgotten too.

Stephen held up a hand and she snapped her mouth shut, feeling herself deflate. Because it wasn’t
“How’re you feeling?” she whispered and he made a brief mental check of his body.
Vision on the other hand felt like an entirely new person to the synthezoid she had once trained. He ignored her for the most part and spent most of his time either alone or with Toni. It hadn’t escaped her notice that Toni had been using his room as a base as opposed to her own. At one point she’d walked past Toni’s original quarters twelve times before finally suffocating the urge to look inside and
“They either wanted to be noticed or this was a diversion for something else. FRIDAY’s on it but so far there’s nothing out of the ordinary on any news channel,” Toni sighed.
“Yes,” she stated after a time, watching him carefully. “She knew it was for you. T’Challa told her what I was trying to do. She told him to tell me that if there was any way she could help she would be willing to. Very generous of her considering she’s the one who blew off your
“Hello, everyone.” Toni’s voice was quiet but strong. There wasn’t a trace of her signature snark or quick, sharp smiles. This Toni was honest. She had a cause, something she believed in; Natasha knew her well enough to read it on her face, in the stance of her body, in the
“So that’s one reason why I’m here,” he said, and his voice sounded loud to her ears. “Because whatever it is she saw was enough to frighten her. And if I can do something then I have to. And if an army is coming to Earth then we’re going to need an army of our own. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you sooner.”
“Mark it down. First reactionary test indicates the arm is functioning within optimal parameters.”
Rhodey called for them not long after and finally it was really time for Toni to leave. Having Rhodey and Vision here, though, made the event a little less terrible than if she’d had to drive all the way back alone.
There were fragments, glimpses of things she couldn’t possibly remember because they had never happened. Not to her. And yet there was just
Then Toni snorted incredulously, surveying the lot of them in amusement. “What the hell do you guys think this is, Grey’s Anatomy?” Her expression darkened, her mouth curling in distaste and fury. “Well guess what. No. No you
Words couldn’t describe that those thirty seconds had done to her.

, Stark. Colonel.” He wasn’t smiling now. There was something grave in his expression as he gazed over their shoulders, his eyes seeing something they couldn’t. “And if you say a war’s coming, Stark? I’ll raise you one and tell you it’s already here.” The words sent a chill up her spine and Rhodey shifted in his seat, frowning stiffly. “I know we need the Avengers, you don’t have to tell me that. And I know we need Captain America. So it ain’t me you gotta convince. It’s the rest of the world.”
is HYDRA’s MO. You either beat them into submission until they have nothing less or you create people like him. Sycophants. People who are willing to die for you no matter the cause.”
Her voice sent a shiver up the back of his neck and Steve felt like a steel rod had been inserted into his spine.
Nat gave him a scathing look but there existed poorly-veiled sympathy, perhaps even understanding in the downward turn of her mouth.
could’ve accidentally punched a hole between realities.”
T’Challa looked ready to get up from his seat and, well, do something. Reach for her? Stop her?
It was a weak argument but valid in its own right. They hadn’t talked about it. Not once. They hadn’t even discussed it. Just shared heavy, despondent looks and tucked it away neatly in the box of things to think of when shit wasn’t hitting the fan. This was on both of them, the first ones who’d seen the footage, who’d witnessed the one thing that would break them all apart, maybe for good.
But maybe.
“I wish I could, but my brother has reverted to the disposition of a newborn rhino calf and requires constant looking-after, and I have resorted to smacking him with an electric baton every time he acts like a jerk.” She sighed again, staring longingly up at the 3D rendition of Barnes’ implant.
She almost laughed. Or cried. Whichever would be more appropriate in front of hundreds of political heads and representatives. “Am I?”
Laura’s easy but earnest
she said emphatically and Vision detected an edge of desperation in her voice. “No, that’s not it.
I'm so sorry this took so darn long but this is one mega long chapter and it took me so long to tie all these half-written scenes together but finally, here we are, folks, here we are. I hope you all enjoy. It has been a very stressful last few weeks and I'm sorry I haven't replied to your comments but I will get on them as soon as I can, I promise! Thank you to everybody who has stuck with me this far because reading and re-reading your comments has seriously saved me when I got overwhelmed writing my own story. Thank you all so much for your kind words and support and I really hope you all enjoy this monstrosity of a chapter!
“We made mistakes,” Toni continued. “We made so many unnecessary mistakes. Maybe we couldn’t see another way. Maybe we were too focused on the mission. Maybe we should have pushed that little bit more.” She held up her hands. “But hey. We were only human.”
Natasha gave her a wry look. “I hope they haven’t already scared him away. From what I saw we could use someone like him on our side.”
“I am with you on this path, Toni. And I know it to be a good path. I can feel it. You
have taken away the suit because of all the people on the entire fucking planet you deserve it the most.”
“Dude!” Scott shouted, sticking his head in when Wanda ran back out, while Steve was kicking free of his blanket, and waving frantically. “Your pal called, the leather suit redhead. They’re on television, man!”
Rhodey nodded. “And we’ll be bringing up the whole Ross deal. Once the others are back ho-

She heaved a heavy, expansive sigh, staring at the ceiling, trying to look anywhere else except his dignified sympathy and earnestness. Because this,
A strange feeling came over Steve, then, and his thoughts turned inward, assessing.
Several eyes darted towards Ackerman before focusing on Toni once more, though Toni could tell they weren’t as clued on as they were trying to appear.
T’Challa and Shuri had been with her, discussing the upgrades they were going to be making to B.A.R.F., when she got the call from Happy.
“You won’t,” Steve reassured her, feeling a headache creeping up the back of his neck and fatigue settling deeply into his bones. “I swear, Toni, you won’t. We’ll all be quiet. We just wanna watch. Just to make sure—” He cut himself off, immediately realizing his mistake.
He hesitated, then pulled back so he could look at her with serious, swollen, red-rimmed eyes. “M’not taking sides.”
When she looked back up at the screen, T’Challa was waiting with his own drink in hand and they both smiled, raised their respective glasses, before taking a sip.
Her left hand felt funny and her fingers were cold again for some reason and she absently rubbed them together, plastering a wide smile onto her face and surveying all of them.
He only prayed that this time it would work.
All save one that remained stubbornly above her head. She frowned and tried again, confused when it didn’t budge.
But here…
They glared at each other for a long moment and with that stubborn set to her jaw Toni was so damn sure that Natasha was going to add something more, just to have the final word.
“Oh,” was all he managed.
But the most telling, the easiest thing to read on the canvas of her face was the sheer devastation whenever the phone rang and she’d run to pick it up only for it to not be whom she wanted it to be.
Just like that the buzzing ceased and the room came back into focus, like time regurgitated the other side of a wormhole.
“One thing at a time, Ms. Stark.”
She blinked.

There was a threat in his question, a warning that she knew she had to take seriously because for all that they were doing, for everything they’d accomplished, were
what the world did to beautiful things like her.
“More like there’s a black hole between the time you disappeared off the face of the Earth and turned up during that very bizarre incident in Hong Kong.” She pinned him with an unflinching look. “Care to enlighten us on what happened in between?”
“You’re getting better at our style.” Ayo’s voice was an explosion of noise in his ears.
“That one broke not too long ago. It’s so old I was just planning on getting a new one.”
That made Toni grin. “The coolest and smartest one there ever was,” she agreed. “Taught me a thing or two about...everything.”
..when the evidence indicated that he was the last person she wanted to see.
He thought about that for a moment, unpacking the hidden message behind her words and honing in on the obvious point she was trying to make.
In putting herself out there Toni had always made herself a target. But this was different. This was the big leagues, the
The various holographic screens were still floating around her and for a while she just stared up at them, flicking through the documents with quick swipes of her fingers. It had been weird in the beginning, not having to
Toni violated about fifty traffic laws in the span of that one-sided conversation and T’Challa - seriously, thank god for the people around her - answered on her behalf.
It forced a breath of a laugh out of her and she finally looked at him in his black suit and a stubborn -
“Just relax, Sergeant Barnes,” Vision said in what seemed to be a perpetually mellow tone.

“I would be honored to assist in whatever manner I am able,” Vision declared solemnly and Toni smiled.
“No. I can’t.”

than ever, she and Harley became near permanent fixtures at the Compound, declaring themselves, along with Peter, Toni’s ‘interns’. And once they were introduced to Shuri, things tended to go really crazy really fast. It turned out that giving two geniuses, an inventor and a polymorph the run of a place like the Compound was a recipe for disaster. Hilarious disasters but disasters all the same.
When she was done, she didn’t waste a beat before grabbing the parts she needed from the second deconstructed arm and began installing them. Her back and neck must’ve been killing her, bowed and bent in the same position for so long, but she gave no indication of any discomfort and her hands never trembled even once, whereas he hadn’t been able to feel his own ass for the last half hour.
Shuri blurted as T’Challa and Vision helped to extract the kid from the car and lay him onto the biobed.
FRIDAY was a big help in filtering through the influx of calls they started getting ever since word got out of Toni’s return to New York. It was the inevitable result of her going into the city to show her face to a very angry and very emotional Pepper. Words were thrown and Toni had shrunk in on herself in shame but ultimately Pepper had wrapped her in a hug and cried into her shoulder, albeit awkwardly considering she was twelve feet taller than Toni.

As well as a million unsaid things, a grief that went arc reactor-deep, a letter and a flip phone and a

you don’t want me to be here—?”
Toni swallowed around the lump in her throat and nodded.
Toni listened without judgment but the fingers of her right hand were digging into the sensitive veiny underside of her left wrist as she waited for the axe to fall.
When he didn’t say anything more, Toni sighed again and swiped the screen of her tablet off, then pushed to her feet.
in her hands was something else altogether.
in him as a friend and as a leader. With Toni things hadn’t been easy. They didn’t click like she and Steve had. Then they’d cultivated something out of the catastrophic trainwreck of their first meeting, out of the lies that curled around all their interactions like thorns, out of bitter pasts and guilt and self-hatred.
even, and rather than frustrate her his level of control calmed the sudden spike of her heartbeat somewhat.

She inhaled sharply, squeezing his hand. “You didn’t have the suit. I wasn’t sure if- I know you’re enhanced but I saw the wreckage and I thought- Jesus, Peter, what were you
“Yes.”
For Steve it had been wake up early, run, exercise, train with the Dora, accompany the Dora on border patrol, get back to their apartments, train some more, make dinner, sleep and do it all over again the next day.
There was a long, miffed and unfriendly pause before FRIDAY finally utilised her audio output.
That was of course when Peter came up behind her, still holding one of the new web-shooters they’d been designing together.
Helen’s expression was inscrutable, made even more so when she tied her mask behind her head and obstructed half her face once more.
“He asked me about you, you know?” That made Toni freeze. “He wanted to know why
She blinked again, then shook her head and stood up.
He forgot how to breathe. “Where-?” he croaked. “Where did you get the number?”
Peter Parker - Spider-Man - was indeed under the jungle gym, nestled in the shadow of a miniature bridge and slide, wearing what looked to be a hooded vest over a blue one-piece pajama suit and through his worried exasperation at the boy, he came to understand Toni Stark in that moment, and the evident fondness she’d come to develop for him.
Her voice was so quiet, drowned out by the noise of the restaurant and by the feel-good music pulsing from the speakers.
Severe bruising to his upper back and multiple lacerations, most of them superficial and his healing factor has already kicked into action. I am reading a mild concussion, however, so I recommend further scans once we’re back at the Compound.”
Face your demons and all.
“Toni!” T’Challa called, catching up to her as she burst out of the main door of the Compound and skidded across the gravel to the Land Rover parked on the grass. She was vaguely sure it belonged to Hill. Her new quinjets were still under construction but she had one of her small jets, the Dagger, still stationed on top of Stark Tower but it would waste too much time to get it here and then- “Toni, what can we do?” he urged, opening the door for her to jump in, but she couldn’t think, she couldn’t
So he clutched it close even as he walked away. He nursed it against the safest part of himself and prayed that it would grow.
The buzzing in her ears got louder and the tips of her fingers were icy and numb even as torrid heat crawled up the back of her neck and pain throbbed behind her eyes.
, that’s for sure,” she snorted. “But
“Why did you do that?” Shuri asked again, with a kind of yearning that Toni didn’t understand until she said, with such fragile loss that the revelation rang in her head, clear as a bell, “You were supposed to be

once more before making a firm decision.”
And well. Wouldn’t that be nice.
Laura smirked. “I’m sure you’ll manage.”
“I’ll write up a formal offer letter for a Stark internship. Give a copy to your mother and to your school. You join combat training starting next weekend. Like I’ve already told Peter and Kamala, homework first, though.
“I do,” she said lightly, but let an undercurrent of warning seep into her tone.
And she could make this work. She could make this
“Okay,” Toni said quietly, gaze flitting from his face to his hands. “Now stop.”
So Bucky had stayed with Steve, broad, larger than life Steve who looked as small as that kid from Brooklyn in his guilt and in his grief.
Other than the thick blanket of barely suppressed anger and betrayal that permeated the room whenever Antonia Stark was brought up he knew very little about the diminutive woman who had attacked him with such ferocity and rage and almost killed him in that Siberian bunker.
“I didn’t know your dad,” she finally said, and T’Challa met her eyes. “My dad did but, as I’m sure you’re aware, it was under some pretty shitty circumstances. So I don’t know him. But I’d like to think that I know
She smiled, blunt and professional, and held a hand out for him to shake. “Agent Fern, Captain. Pleasure to finally meet you.”
T’Challa seemed to vaguely debate this for a few seconds before shrugging carelessly. “Give him a couple of weeks and he’ll brown nicely.”
“See you later, Butterfingers!” she called, blowing him a kiss. Then she met Toni’s eyes and smiled a little embarrassed smile that Toni somehow managed to return.
President Ellis had of course been invited, as had Secretary Ross - who sent her death glares and more than one angry message from across the room during the first session - along with a hundred and thirty country representatives, a hundred and twenty-eight of whom belonged to countries that had already ratified the Accords, who were streaming from their respective offices - thanks to Stark tech, of course.
She was his creator.
Vision stepped out and Toni’s mind stuttered to a halt.
It was still hard to believe that this was her world, that these were her people. Rhodey laughing with a quietly amused T’Challa over a glass of wine, Natasha and Peter - who still wore his mask around Strange at Toni's insistence, which was ever so slowly waning - in a corner with their inside spider jokes, Strange -
“We should bring those in,” Cooper said, nodding towards the several baskets she’d picked. “It’s getting dark soon.”

“Okay,” she said at last. “Time to fit in the power source.”
to T’Challa as he weighed her words, like he was balancing them against his own thoughts and actions in the wake of Wakanda’s opening to the world. She wondered whether some part of him regretted it, if only for the sake of his own mental wellbeing and that of his people.
“And I, you, Antonia Stark,” he breathed with such affection that rang true down to her bones. “I am immeasurably lucky to have met you in this lifetime.” A moment later she felt his lips on her forehead and her eyes fluttered closed on their own, her body leaning into him. When he pulled back she blinked up at him, all at once feeling very young, younger than she could ever remember feeling. It wasn’t, altogether, an unpleasant feeling. “One day,” he promised, “I will bring you to Wakanda and I will show you my home.”

, the ladies in her life were awesome.
Steve looked over his shoulder and found T’Challa walking towards him, Shuri an ever-present shadow behind him. She was quicker to smile than her brother and when she did there was an innocence that made Steve feel older than he already was. And she was smart,
It had taken Wanda a while to request that a copy be sent to her and often had a pinched expression on her face while she read it. Bucky didn’t know much about her situation, just a few scathing remarks about Stark and the deep longing on her face whenever someone mentioned Vision. Sam had mentioned to him once that she and her brother had willingly given themselves over to HYDRA to be experimented on and blamed Stark for the death of their family. Bucky suspected that was an oversimplification scratched deep into her psyche by years of pain and rage but he couldn’t begrudge her for it. Not when Antonia Stark’s distraught face haunted his dreams and the sound of her screams -
“It’s usually civilians, isn’t it? We’re like kids with inbuilt guns and we don’t know our own strength and then we fuck up and it’s the innocent that get caught in the crossfire.” Natasha had once told her that Loki said her ledger was dripping. Sometimes Toni felt like she was drowning in an ocean of blood, a gallon and a half for every single nameless, faceless person that she had both directly and indirectly ended the life of. “But it feels a million times worse when it’s one of ours, doesn’t it?”

she stepped through the doors, turning away just as the door slid shut like a guillotine, cutting off the image of his profile as he stared at the ground looking lost.

. But as much as she wanted to, as much as she wanted to reach out to this hell of a kid and take him on board and make him feel like he hadn’t been forgotten, she couldn’t. Not yet.
She knew Fury - fuck knows where he was - liked to think he had a monopoly on dealing with the World’s Biggest Shitstorms but Toni reckoned she could take him in a fight.
“Toni, it is three a.m. here. Stop pinging me!”
to her.
“It’s good to see you too,” she offered, because it was all she could at this point. “You look well.”
“That’s...nice?”
T’Challa had partially expected Toni to pass out for at least three days after the UN talks were over, but she had managed to subvert his assumptions at almost every turn so he wasn’t entirely surprised to find her bent over one of her work stations with her legs crossed on the seat in a way that only children and tiny women seemed capable of doing.
Toni let the silence settle for a while, letting T’Challa drift into his own internal musings, his worries and his fears.
The young newscaster was in the way and Steve had the absurd urge to stick his hand through the screen and shove the man aside just so he could get a closer glimpse of Toni in the background as she stood facing the new guy.
“As do I. Having said that,” he continued, and there was something in his tone, a dangerous edge that pricked at her ears and made her narrow in on nothing else but him, “regardless of Toni’s very convincing argument about Captain Rogers and his team, I have concerns about how the Council may come to manipulate all that she has done so far.”

There’s currently no science on Earth that can explain what he’s doing. Or

“No.”
She felt her lips twitch and she rested her chin atop her fist. “Sounds like you know a lot about it.”

“You look…”
“Yeah, well. Someone had to do it. Shoulda been us.”
Toni snorted. “Cheerful stuff.”
“Shh,” she hushed, thumbing away the dampness from Toni’s sheek. “You’re okay. You’re safe.”
With a sigh, he squinted up at the sun, then wiped the back of his hand across his sweaty brow.
“I feel...it feels good,” he admitted, lightly scratching his temple. “It’s...different from the last few times we did it. My head’s...clearer.” And it did feel clearer, like the fog being wiped away from a window. “And lighter.” He looked at her, not daring to hope. “Will it last?”
much bigger.”
Bucky made an aborted twitch, glancing at Steve, who dipped his head to hide a grin, then slowly pulled the plain white t-shirt off. Vision took it, folded it neatly and set it aside before he began to stick electrodes onto Bucky’s chest, shoulder, and the back of his neck.
“I suppose that shall have to do for now,” he said. “My proposition is this: that until further notice, Toni never be left alone with either Captain Rogers or any member of his team. I believe doing so will cause her too much...unnecessary stress.”

Natasha glared at the door when Ross gave another shout, then turned back to Toni, something fierce,

Vision gave a despairing sigh. “As you wish. I am now attempting to aid Black Panther in extracting the remaining civilians. We should be able to clear the rest of the floors shortly.”
“Because right from the start, she wanted to keep the team together. That was the one thing she cared about. The Accords, Ross, all that came second to keeping the team together, to keeping us
The corners of his lips quirked up. “I run around in a cat suit in my spare time. I also lie to politicians on a frequent basis about how poor my country is. We sell fruits on the side of dusty roads. And bracelets.”
“They’ll be real happy to know it works.” Toni lingered there awkwardly, feeling a little flustered, before taking a step back. “Anyways. I should let you get back to teaching and I’ve got something cooking in the lab, so. Catch you later?”
The doctors and nurses all took their positions and Helen nodded to the anaesthesiologist.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, her body shuddering with emotion at her own words.
She snorted and rolled her eyes goodnaturedly, then walked towards the front door without waiting for him.
She knew he was referring to Rhodey, Nat, T’Challa and Hope but there was always a shadow in her mind in the shape of a cutout of a group photo. A large missing piece that took with it its own story, leaving half a conversation, laughter to a missing joke, a smile directed at no one.
“Not one bit.”
Down on the floor, Peter, Harley and Kamala were guiding Cooper, Lila and Cassie through the obstacle course that Maria’s recruits had set up. Laura stood on the sidelines with Nate on her hip, the both of them cheering and clapping at intervals. Lang was standing on one of the bottom benches, enthusiastically goading his daughter on in spite of her embarrassed protests.
that mattered most, the weight of shared experiences that forged bonds stronger than titanium. Toni, in her most vulnerable moments of hope and yearning, thought they’d had that. Yet even now, even though Natasha sat here and not
It was funny how just the night before they were all gathered in the same room smiling and tonight the atmosphere had done about a ninety-degree turn. They were gathered late into the night, dark circles, five o'clock shadows and black coffee their intimate friends. Vision was the only one who looked exactly the same but he’d taken to standing up abruptly and taking a turn around the room. If it was anyone else she might have called it pacing. Peter and Kamala were lounging on one of the couches talking sleepily - she wondered what excuses they’d given their respective guardians this time - and Harley was slumped between them with his hood over his eyes while Shuri sat on the floor against his legs, scribbling things out on her tablet.
Steve could feel her eyes on him, a question, a judgment.
“-and then there’s Rosie. She’s been dying to meet you. I think she might have a crush, you ladies’ man you.”
“Then that means-” Pepper said suddenly, leaning forward, alert.
They watched him walk down the aisle to the podium. His gaze flickered briefly to where they were seated and Toni gave him a discreet thumbs up before he began his pitch.
There was a confused beat before T’Challa asked carefully, “What does the meatloaf represent in this scenario?”
-and Scott had just sat there staring at his hands and had looked so self-loathing-
The darker part of her that had a penchant for overthinking wondered how much of that had to do with the
The day after that it was Tuesday.
She stood, adrenaline causing her legs to shake because this was it.
“I’m sure I would,” she whispered, wanting to keep this memory, this moment,
“Okay, thaaat might be stretching it,” she murmured, touched nonetheless by Coulson’s level of faith in her, however exaggerated. “Nat, on the other hand…”
He looked at her.
“Don’t imagine sleep’s gonna come easy tonight,” she said dryly. “There’s gonna be a lot of...unspoken things. Distrust. Between everything.”
They were deep underground in the most secure part of the Compound accessible only by a single elevator and an increasing number of security protocols that made the Raft look like, well, an actual
“You ready, pal?”
But the point was she kept an eye on him as often as she could and was just going through raw footage of one of his latest escapades - stopping a gas station robbery - when a reflection on the screen caught her attention and she froze.
Toni knew that and she smiled. “Can we get an uplink, FRIDAY?”
“So you took them with you,” Toni nodded. “Where they sit in your home and do-” She squinted at him. “-what exactly? What’s their contribution in fixing all of this?”
He could see her reflection in the glass; her signature red shawl was draped protectively over her shoulders.
He gritted his teeth, fingers digging into his palm.

for. But she delivered in a way only Antonia Edwina Stark could and she had barely scratched the surface of the afternoon.
Even if every step he took towards her made her take a step away from him.
He hoped she wasn’t alone, not the way he left her.
Shuri had always been good to him, funny and whip-smart in a way that was still kind. The rest of her staff had been distant but just as professional, deferring to Shuri’s authority in a way that was empirically different to how Zola’s workers deferred to him.
“Because she’d just seen your best friend murder her parents in cold blood,” he said slowly. Then chuckled, a mirthless and ugly sound. “And you knew all this while.
She felt Vision’s unimpressed gaze but continued to reconfigure the neuromodulator.
Hatred was a whirlpool that threatened to suck her deep into its depths and suffocate any notion of reconciliation that she might have clung to. And cling she did, with nails and teeth and a heart that could level the city.
A moment later and a small sound left his mouth, something soft and exasperated - a

“You give yourself away far too freely, Toni.” T’Challa shook his head. “It isn’t over yet. We have much more to do. And we cannot do it without you.”
“I’m sor-”
“For me,” she blurted around a giggle. “Are you- are you even fucking
“That’s your choice. I don’t need the Cradle. I just need Rhodey to walk again.”
A muscle ticked in her jaw. “But what if-?”
Toni kept her mouth shut and let Stephen take the conversation forward. It’d been a gamble but it looked like it could pay off. Training and oversight. Enough of it to appeal to the UN and just the right amount so that Wanda wouldn’t feel trapped by the many conditions of her pardon. Stephen could deliver that. She knew he could. Toni had been hesitant to ask him at first, what with his work at the Sanctum and with The Room, but when she’d brought it up with him he hadn’t thought twice.
And she had so fucking many.
He made to turn, then paused, seemingly debating with himself over something, before looking down at Steve.
“So we’ve done it.” The finality of her tone wasn’t lost on her, as much as she was willing away the darkness that encroached into the space around her heart.

“Yes.”
They stared at one another for a long time, Toni measuring his words until they were on the same platform, until the understanding between them evened out like the bubble of a spirit level, perfectly balanced.
“Months,” she replied and she certainly looked and sounded like she’d been awake for months on end, which he knew to be untrue seeing as they’d spent every night together for the past four.
Steve Rogers opened his eyes and turned to face his team, who straightened their shoulders when they looked into his face. He surveyed them one by one. This team. His people. When he met Sam’s gaze, Sam subtly dipped his head. When he looked at Bucky-
Some of the other doctors came in for a glimpse while others contented themselves with watching the screen on the far wall.
