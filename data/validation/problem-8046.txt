Eventually Steve and Rhodey returned from their little talk and the pack could easily note the facade Steve was putting on as he walked in. He was trying to act nonchalantly, but there was a notable color shift on his face. Pasty white compared to his usual soft pink and those fingers of his were trembling. He appeared one of two possibilities. From the very stern talking to Rhodey had given him Steve was either seething from having another alpha talk down to him, or he was trembling from the fright of it.
Something would come. Eventually. Tony just needed to wait and keep his energy up in the meantime. Emotionally and physically. He couldn’t give up hope.
Tony had no response. The only thing he could do was take two slow steps to the alpha before dashing forward, jumping the small distance and causing them both to tumble down on the ground. He kissed Steve fiercely, hoping to convey everything he felt through it. How happy, how thankful, how much he just - how much his heart was invested in him. It belonged to him. Every little broken piece Steve owned, truly.
to describe how you smell right now.”
Why would they when Tony was never going to have a heat and he had ‘taken’ the suppressants Hank had given them just before their journey.
“That depends,” Prior released a growl, “are you both leaving for other shacks, or are you leaving because you got invited to join a pack?”
“That is what I conclude.”
The omega shrugged and gestured at the empty space. “If you don’t mind being seen with me go right ahead.”
As Tony watched them eat their fill a problem came to mind. Bruce hadn't been given any of the prey to eat. Tony had fish given from the pack leader but he couldn't offer any to Bruce, lest he wants to be rude and outright insult Steve by giving away the food he had hunted down specifically for him.
“Not anymore,” Fury said. “They’re real and they’re alive. Medical have found readings of steady but slow heartbeats. We have no idea how but I suspect the reasons behind their wings might have a role in it. If their comics are based on real facts then we have three non-existing citizens that have missed nearly 70 years. There will be shock, I guarantee it.”
If not the pack mother then maybe they wanted him to be the stay-at-den omega and look after their place while they traveled the roads and defeated peace-disturbing scoundrels and have meals ready for when they returned. Of course he knew nothing about cooking, but he knew about keeping a place clean, Hammer made sure of that.
Tony wasn’t looking his direction but he was positive that Bruce was blushing, and the subject of Natasha speaking another language passed briefly in his head, but right then wasn’t exactly the time. Steve had grasped Tony’s hand and Tony himself couldn’t stop the way his heart skipped a beat. The sounds of residents talking paused and Tony could’ve sworn the entire town went dead silent. Once the moment to process what they’ve seen passed the chatting picked up, louder than before. Steve was revealing to them all his true intent and wasn’t holding back or looking embarrassed one bit.
“You’re drooling again, Steve,” Natasha smirked with a lazy stare towards Steve’s direction. Everyone instinctively shifted their gazes to him, all of them with knowing grins on their faces and while Tony didn’t see any visible drool coming out of Steve’s mouth he did note the alpha looked like someone seconds away from doing it. He blushed and gave a shy smile.
“Iron Man is down. I repeat, Iron Man is down. In need of urgent medical attention. Cap is…” Falcon’s voice trails off.
A puff of his cheeks and a stubborn nod and the child ran back inside the building.
Ignoring the stinging sensation that burned up his legs Tony planted his feet under him and pushed himself up, remembering to snatch Vision on the way. The machine continued his make-shift sleep undisturbed.
“It’s all yours, Petey,” Ben informed him and earned himself a shriek of delight.
“Good things I hope, and reasonable. They tend to exaggerate.”
“You ready?”
“You’ll see. We don’t give up easily, you know that.”
A lot of insecurity, a moment of bravery and a moment to overindulge and then regret it shortly after.
In the Hulk’s hold, they followed dutifully behind Steve through the town until they reached a large building with two floors at the farthest corner. Decently hidden and kept out of the sights of the young. At Steve’s order, the Hulk placed him down and grabbed the bags from the alpha before settling down to guard. Steve’s breathing had evened out, no longer cutting short in a worrisome manner. Tony could relax momentarily before the issue of his cycle returned in his thoughts.
Tony huffed, trying to cover up an emotional sniff. “How do you manage to make it sound so poetic?”
Tony moaned and unconsciously pushed back to get more of the sensation it created, wanting that finger to go deeper. He pulled away from Steve’s marking when a second finger entered and with shaking arms held himself over the alpha, taking note of the flush on his cheeks and the blue of his eyes barely visible from the pupils blown up in lust. The sight made Tony preen.
“We’ll have to do this fast and smart. We’ll make a dent in their numbers using that fort and pick off whoever is left. Maybe with luck, we’ll come out with hardly a scratch.” Almost all of them snorted at that, except for those who had recently joined the pack. From somewhere in their arrangement Jan could be heard whispering “as if that ever happens.” Steve ignored them. “Be prepared for a big fight either way.”
Tony shivered in disgust. “I don't know, Ty. Suddenly I’ve lost my appetite.”
Were they mated, or were they really close pack-mates and friends? Perhaps one day, when Tony was considered close pack to them, they’d offer the information themselves, or if Tony got too curious and wasn’t able to resist asking hopefully they’d answer him.
Go forth and enjoy!
“And if it’s not enough?”
“With a beta instead.”
Thankfully Steve didn't push for answers. Instead, he gingerly leaned forward, aiming for the sleeves and pulling them away to expose Tony's face. He then began licking away the tears. His tongue going slowly over his cheek and cleaning the trails. Tony allowed it, selfishly taking the comfort and enjoying the warmth that came from having Steve so close.
The silence that followed stretched out for what seemed like hours to Tony. His eyes had closed when he looked away and so he had no idea what Steve’s reaction was or would be. He flinched when he felt warm fingers touch his chin and tilt his head up and inhaled when another set of fingers gently caressed his cheek.
But if the Avengers wanted him for another reason, a specific reason that involved sharing him around or even just being given for one to use… Tony would still say yes. That was basically all he was with Hammer with a side of creating weapons. He wasn’t a mate. The word didn’t even come close to describing their relationship. No, Tony had years to think about what he had been to Hammer and he had learned to accept it. The Avengers didn’t know he could create. What else would they want Tony for if not for pack mother or a den omega? What else would Tony be good for?
“Shall we get a move on?” Tony said and began slowly walking down, hunching over to control his center of gravity. Rhodey and Pepper followed after him.
Now his fur was a disarray and jumbled, faded mess of dark brown that no high end shifter would look twice at. It was a wonder how Hammer had managed to put up with Tony’s least presentable appearance in these last few years. Any omega, or even beta, Hammer had used, from Tony’s knowledge, he would throw away like a sack of useless potatoes the moment he grew bored of them. But not Tony. Never Tony. Hammer was adamant on keeping Tony, no matter what.
Tony pulled the blanket over his head when every. Single. One of the Avengers made faces of approval. Then the scent must have finally reached them for those same faces soon wrinkled their noses simultaneously, including Natasha’s and Loki’s.
ear?”
“Doesn’t happen to me either,” another pause, “but maybe it’s about time it does. I’m willing to give it a try, but I won’t do it without you.”
Steve gave him one final long kiss. His eyes were lidded, probably ready to nap after all the pleasure their bodies went through. “I love you.”
machine? Oh my - Nat, I want one. Get me one.”
. He’d heard of them before but never actually seen one. It was eye opening. “Steve - I mean, the Captain, didn’t tell us when you guys would be leaving.”
One of Happy’s large ears twitched. “That makes two of us.”
“How are you doing?” Tony asked the other omega after settling down.
The Avengers deserved every ounce of royalty they received.
They eventually manage to find the Inn with much circling around. The voices of their packmates were loud and cheerful and were heard before the two even reached the doors. Inside they quickly spotted Thor sitting by a round table and merrily drinking with Bucky and Clint by his sides. All three downing their glasses in a worrisome pace. Jan and Loki sat across from them with their own glass, both sipping sedately compared to the three across. Rhodey and Sam were seated by the counter and were talking to the bartender. Natasha and the now shrunk Bruce were on the farthest corner of the counter talking amongst themselves. None of the citizens in the Inn were showing fear at his presence. Tony had to assume none of them were aware of the Hulk. It was a relief to know.
That seemed to snap his alpha from the haze he was falling into. He appeared sheepish, but didn't make the effort to wipe his mess. If anything he used a well crafted distraction that consisted of putting his slicked up fingers in his mouth and licking them to hold off cleaning a while longer.
Tony lifted Vision from the table’s surface with his good arm and turned to walk back to their temporary shack with Bruce taking up his side. He dared turn to get a glance after a few steps and watched as the many betas and omegas flooded the available space on the table the moment he and Bruce left.
Jarvis had the decency to look guilty, which only proved Tony’s fears. “I offered to fly and provide a view from the skies of the structure and the area.”
“Margaret Carter,” she held her hand out respectfully. It surprised Tony. No alpha would show that courtesy to an omega, especially one they didn’t know. Not from his experience at least, but if she was in friendly terms with Steve than maybe it wasn’t so shocking. Steve had proven time and time again just how different he and their pack were. They wouldn’t be friends with someone who treated others disrespectful, omega or not.
When his stomach released another outcry and the feeling of being deprived of food after regularly feeding since joining the Avengers very discomforting it was decided he’d have to risk it. Now, how to remove the arm that felt like a binding at this point without stirring Steve up? Trying to pull at the wrist was no help as it prompted the arm to tighten even more and for Steve to pull him closer, burying his face against the back of his neck and shoulders. A smile pulled on Tony’s lips as the thought of Steve unconsciously not wanting to let him go crossed his mind. It probably wasn’t the actual reason, Tony had no way of knowing, but he could dream.
That stopped his Honey bear from growling, but he still refused to move.
They were almost there with the nearest shack a run away when Steve called out his name and put a gentle hand on his shoulder. He turned around and realized that Bruce and Natasha were standing a distance away behind them, Natasha saying a few words that had Bruce rubbing his hands together timidly. Tony snapped his eyes to Steve when the alpha said his name again.
“Lie down on your back,” Steve ordered. Tony’s back was on the bed faster than he could’ve nodded, but Steve wasn’t satisfied. “Get your entire body on the bed. Legs, too.”
Having Jarvis’ and Vision’s curious and innocent eyes on him, and having Rhodey’s, Pepper’s and Happy’s protective gazes wanting to know if he had been
Just the sight of him had everyone recoiling, including Tony. It had been far too long since he'd last seen the Hulk and under the light of the sun and nothing to obscure him his presence was absolutely terrifying. Tony hadn't realized the sheer size of the odd shifter, the night and darkness having taken away from their first meeting, but now there was no denying the reason why Bruce hesitated at the very idea of the other guy. He was dangerous to those threatening him, and Tony was glad he wasn't on the receiving end.
Bucky crossed his arms. “Everytime he uses them the sky cries. Rains for days until his mood lightens up.”
Tony watched his packmates fondly. He was able to smile since he had knowledge of Bruces’ location, but his pack did not, making their reactions to what they believe to be a missing pack member genuine. They truly thought Bruce was out there lost and were scrambling to start a search. They really cared for each other and this proved it. He couldn’t wait to let Bruce know.
Steve groaned from the sensation, encouraging Tony to try on his own and lift his hips to repeat the motion. Tony's own pants trapping his dick made it very uncomfortable and straining to move smoothly, but the fabric rubbing against his slit more than made up for the effort put. He felt a small amount of slick form and bring with it the smell of lust-filled omega into the air. Steve outright moaned at that, giving a low growl of want. He pulled away from Tony’s lips to kiss the side of Tony’s neck, nipping with his lips. Tony could practically feel the alpha strain from doing something, the body under him tensing up.
The idea of a soft surface was more appealing. As long as he had that he couldn’t complain.
Tony gave himself another pinch, took a bite of his food and dared to take a peek to see if the Avengers were still there. They were. He also ended up looking at the exact moment the Captain decided to face his direction and their eyes locked, again. There was a lot of eye locking with this alpha, Tony found. He wondered if more was in his foreseeable future.
“Tony, shh, you’re safe, I’m here. They won’t hurt you, I promise. They won’t touch you again. You’re safe.”
“Careful,” hissed Loki right next to Tony, making him jump. “If you gaze at the Widow any longer the Captain will believe you are uninterested in him.”
He just couldn’t picture Stane hovering over them, whispering to Hammer on how to behave and treat his omega. Stane had cared for Tony. Once. Treated him, not fairly, but better than most. Tony had
“Tony?”
Tony continued gaping, eyes wide and cheeks flushing. The new position had him hugging the alpha in a more obvious manner and the warmth was practically draped over him like a blanket. It was the comfiest Tony had been in, and that was saying something considering he was lying on the ground. Then Vision had to release a whistle to inform him he was awake and found the arrangement interesting. Tony couldn’t see the little machine, but he could perfectly imagine the mechanized smirk. And then to add more salt to his situation he felt Jarvis hop over his stomach and nestle himself down. “I see you’re enjoying this fine morning, Sir.”
Tony was admiring the thought of such a life. He tried to imagine himself being a part of such a pack and getting a taste of domesticity he was never going to experience when the sound of a fight interrupted him. He had imagined two alphas going at it, ripping their throats out and clawing from how intense it sounded, but when he turned he hadn't expected the culprits to be four kids. Three of them going up against one small child that didn’t appear to be giving up any time soon. Without even thinking about it Tony had jogged over to them to break up the unfair fight.
Squaring his shoulders, taking a deep breath, and trying to calm his nerves Tony entered the room with no door. Inside a male shifter stood behind an anvil, holding tongs and a hammer. His arm with the hammer was raised and ready to strike the pan his tongs were holding in place. By his side the furnace was lit with a small flame, the ashes flowing through the air. Tony inhaled the wonderful scent that made him feel instantly at home. The warmth, the grease, the smell of hot metal, oh how he had missed it. His love for creating had reignited like the flame in the furnace.
Tony hadn’t expected that. Was this what Steve meant when he said to listen to the stories from the others. Was he not the only one to join the pack broken and emotional? Did they all share a similar pain or experience?
“I know,” Tony felt odd being the one to comfort the other when it was usually him broken and crying. It just showed how much he had yet to learn of the alpha. “I didn’t mean it, Steve. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to push you away.”
Before any of them made a move Clint and Sam stepped closer to Rhodey and flanked him. Determined faces on and ready for any challenge. “Listen, for the past few days we’ve been trying to be subtle, but that’s clearly not enough,” Clint said.
Her request was odd and out of the blue, but Tony did as asked, turning his head to allow her full view of his profile.
He was oversensitive from his body pushing farther than ever before and he was thankful when Steve pulled his tongue away in favor of smacking his lips. He lifted his head high enough for Tony to see his chin smeared with his slick and the alpha gazed lovingly at him. The fond expression Steve showed had him looking sweet and innocent but the bottom half of his face glossed with evidence of what he had done just a couple of seconds ago said otherwise. The imagery was both arousing and mortifying. Arousing because that was Tony’s slick decorating Steve’s face, like a mark not meant to be seen in public. Mortifying because that was
“You drive a hard bargain.”
Tony went around the happy crowd to join them. Being near Bruce helped when he was anxious and Rhodey plus his two menacing kids were a familiar comfort he was always grateful for. A comfort he could really use.
Tony didn’t want to, but he didn’t have a choice. It was the first day in the Avengers’ home - no, not the Avengers…
They knew this.
Tony blinked at the offered clothing. For a moment he thought the alpha was presenting the coat to hide away his bony body and save the Avengers’ eyesight, but that smile was too caring to be insulting him in any way. His chest fluttered as he reached for the coat and he whispered a ‘thank you’ before turning his body to put it on. When he turned back he found all the Avengers looking away from him and Steve trying his hardest to look innocent but failing. Even Bruce had looked away but he appeared to be holding back a laugh. Tony frowned but left it alone.
“Bad idea,” Bruce hissed when he saw his leg bending in ways it was never meant to, looking more awake than before. “Best not get up yet until you gain full mobility.”
Pepper Potts, who had been standing next to Rhodey, walked up and studied the wall, taking note of the turns in the pattern and the holes that appeared to have been made from long years of erosion. “Is this the only opening of the structure?”
Clint nodded, apparently done bickering with his mate at some point. “My pots and pans will live to see another day with a Stark in the house.”
The two omegas accepted the plates with a quick ‘thank you’ and were ushered to their seats by Sam. Everyone looked away the moment they sat down, making Tony breathe out in relief. It wasn’t as overwhelming this time around compared to the day before. With everyone already here and eating their share and with Bruce at his side Tony was able to feel relaxed and he happily chewed his delicious food. He accepted the cup of water handed to him from Jan thankfully and continued munching away.
Shifter. While both canines and felines (and others) had become tolerable and civil with one another there were still those specists older generations that refused to change their ways.
“And tell me,” Bruce continued, “does Natasha really look like she’d play along? Or any of the others for that matter. Sam? Thor? Jan?”
“Sarcasm doesn’t become you. What ever happened to my baby Jarvis that had manners and respected me? Who taught you sarcasm?”
The alpha leader released a low growl, making Tony jump a little until he realized the growl wasn’t aimed at him or Bruce and the growl wasn’t meant to be as threatening as it sounded. No, Steve was growling at Sam and the growl came out more from an annoyance than hostility.
If anything their grins got wider.
“Oh thank the blue skies up above,” Clint lifted his arms up, praising the blue skies, it seemed. “He’s not leaving us.”
Why they had separated and Steve had selected
-” Tony pointed at the alpha. “are that scrawny child that looked as if he could’ve been knocked over by strong wind?”
,” Tony hissed, shielding the little machine’s eyes in a manner similar to trying to cover his mouth.
The faces of the men who had been unlucky enough to have crossed their paths in pain showed him the true anguish his creations were capable of in the wrong hands. In Stane’s and Hammer’s hands. If they were willing to test his gauntlets on the helpless, who knew what despicable shifters they were willing to sell it to.
, clearly,” Tony was sure Loki had just given the snake equivalent of a grin, “and even as you arrive late you wish to continue the pursuit. How dutiful of you.”
Tony looked away for just a second. That second was all it took for Steve to disappear. Tony searched, but Steve just outright vanished into thin air. With no other choice, he left when his family called for him again, but he did look back one last time in hopes of catching sight of Steve. He didn’t.
Sam and Clint fanned themselves and each other when Rhodey marched in with a hard stare at nothing. Rhodey was oblivious to it.
Steve made his way over to the table and took the seat besides Tony. Tony tapped aimlessly at his empty plate with his fork, not having the courage to make eye contact with the alpha. “Good morning,” his voice was softer than he had intended. The guilt and embarrassment was making it extremely hard to just remain in the same room as Steve.
Tony ducked his head again. “I’m sorry.”
talk about something else?
Granted they were probably right, and Bruce had a fair point, but still. He'd rather not have it pointed out.
“Who said anything about jumping in the water to fish? I know how fishing rods work and how to make one. All I need is bait.”
“A most unique name is not reason enough to pass down in their tales. The glory comes from the skills of the warrior that brings fear into their enemies. Enemies are to cower from their capability, not for the rarity of their titles,” Loki chastited at no one in particular.
Clint openly eyed the Hulk. His eyes trailed up and down, getting every detail he could. “That is… impressive.”
He just had to get to the shacks and then this whole ordeal could finally be over. Just survive the walk back. “I’m fine. The feeling will eventually go away. If we don’t go already the sun will be gone by the time I can walk properly.”
Rhodey gave a soft growl, nipping the fur on his cheek. “Stop that.”
Steve was breathing harshly. His breath right next to Tony’s ear. He was tense. Wound up tight. He appeared to be struggling for control. “I’m sorry… I didn’t - I promised not to hurt you, and I go and do exactly that.”
There’s still the footage of his confinement, but he can’t bring himself to see it. Not yet. Not after this.
Four Avengers sat at Tony’s and Bruce’s table, the latter sitting on one edge. The Captain was included on the list of the four Avengers on their table. More specifically, the Captain was sitting
Now Tony really didn’t know what to say. What
From sheer size and temper alone he’d assume alpha, but from the first meeting and the few minutes recently past there was a thing or two that signaled beta, or quite possibly even omega. Could Bruce’s habits be leaking through to the Hulk? They did live in the same space. Perhaps, or perhaps not.
Did he want to swim with the Avengers that required him taking off his clothes and revealing his scarred and malnourished body to shifters who were in their prime and had bodies that sculptors could only dream of creating? No, he really, really didn’t. Tony wasn’t ashamed, per se, he was actually proud that his body wasn’t bulging and flabby like it tended to happen to most shifters around his age. What he wasn’t proud of was his underweight and the scars that decorated his chest. His body was a shadow of its former self, angular and scrawny and not the ideal image of an omega that could bear healthy children. His old, wrinkled clothes that he used to wear with pride didn’t fit him anymore, draping him like a blanket now, and the scars? They were a memory Tony would rather keep locked up and forgotten.
“We didn’t - I mean, we weren’t going to -” Bruce sputtered, rubbing his hands in a gesture Tony knew meant he was nervous.
Hank lifted a hand to stop him. “Just listen for now. You need to know something and I need to get it all out. I fear if you interrupt it might stop me and you can’t misunderstand this. It’s not an excuse, but maybe listening to my story will help you accept everything.” He took a breath. “You’re smart. You’ve probably figured out what I implicated earlier. Jan and I shared heats before. Years ago. A heat amongst betas is difficult to prompt, as you know, and we were doing it with purpose. We wanted a child, and we almost had one.”
After a stretch of silence Clint eventually broke it. “Think we went too far?”
Rogers’ jaw clenched. If rage was a weapon Tony would be dead already.
And the pure open and honest expression on Steve's face made Tony believe the alpha meant it.
Tony huffed and reached for Rhodey's ear, yanking it with a bit more force than necessary and making him wince.
Everyone visibly perked up when the sounds of crunching footsteps was heard and in appeared Bucky and Clint with two deers being dragged individually by them.
“The truth, perhaps.”
Rest. Tony was eagerly looking forward to it. Lie down on a bed with no bump or pebbles to press against his side or back and a pillow to place his head on. He was going to sleep the rest of the day and night away. Something short of pushing him off the bed and dragging him out of the room was going to wake him up.
Rhodey would
“I - I can work with most everything. I’ve got some experience. I - I,” he stuttered.
“I count five. They are watching us.”
They both refused to shift back, content with traveling back home as wolves. Tony sent a silent apology to Jan as he stuffed his gifted outfit in his bag, Steve helping fold them as best as his teeth and paws would allow. The alpha threw the bag over himself, not giving Tony a chance to take it for the journey back. Jarvis hopped onto his own back and settled near his shoulders. Vision followed happily besides them, keeping up with no trouble and every now and then bumping gently against Tony’s hind legs, demanding attention that both Tony and Steve happily gave. A careful swipe of their paws was enough to sate the little machine and he continued down the path back home.
“Well…”
“Morning,” Sam, Jan and Hank said together.
It was good to feel good. He shouted this and many of their teammates agreed. All together they held up a mug given to them by Thor and drank.
Steve was smiling again when he caught up to them, reaching out to grasp his good hand. “I’m sorry about that. It tends to happen a lot because of, you know, being a famous war pack. We didn’t mean to get you chased from your table.”
Those eyes grew wider. Usually not a good sign. “
The hand moved back and twirled its fingers around the long strands of hair on his front. He hadn’t gotten around to visiting a barber yet. His hair had grown considerably to the point of naturally curling at the edges. Steve, he found, loved playing with them and Tony enjoyed the attention.
“Sweetheart? Come on, up you go. I have the bath ready for us.”
On the third day of reading, one particular letter got his attention out of the giant pile. He read it over and over, wondering if it was the old letter he had written himself just last year and it was mistakenly placed in the pile, or if this was another child who was just as lonely as Tony had been.
Tony could note the moment Steve’s fingers reached their goal. His eyes became half-lidded as his eyebrows rose. His face expressed discomfort and Tony had to wonder if his mate was crossing a line he wasn’t used to. Tony reached out without a thought of where to place his hands, needing to touch, needing to comfort. If Steve hadn’t really wanted to do it Tony was going to feel horrible for letting him continue without trying to stop him.
“Breakfast time?” Clint asked as he got on his four paws.
“You got it. Guess fish is on the menu for later in the day.”
“Hold on a sec,” the alpha said, setting the pan down. “You came here for a reason, what you looking for?”
Natasha/Bruce
,” the arm that was wrapped around his shoulders startled him, but miraculously he didn’t flinch. Hadn’t flinched in the longest time. Steve released a sound that was suspiciously similar to a whine for attention. “Your packmates are mistreating me. Make them stop.”
“Oh, but he is, Dearie, and
He whined at that and hung his head, glaring at the length in his hand and willing it to finish already. If only he had someone else to touch him, perhaps then his body would agree. He imagined another hand replacing his one, running one single finger over the surface and tracing the visible veins. A second hand not his own rested on his thigh, the thumb rubbing gently over the inner section of it. The first hand stopped tracing and was now wrapped around his length. It wasn’t moving, just holding it. The second hand began rubbing up and down his thigh, slowly shifting inwards and heading further down, bypassing his member, his sack, and tracing over the flaps of his slit and dipping one finger to tease inside.
He didn’t feel that simmer. Only the satisfactory result of aching muscles and the need of post-coitus snuggles.
Sam only pointed to his own nose.
Have some jealous Steve and small misunderstanding and love. <3
“Lie there. I’ll do everything.”
Gods, he loved his alpha so much.
something at least. Just don’t leave him behind.
“And you shouldn’t need to walk on eggshells for me,” frustration leaked into his voice. Why couldn’t he just
It was considered the biggest of the races, but not one Tony had any interest in.
“Steve our pack is downstairs waiting. Clint will be very upset if he comes back to find us doing this.” His alpha hummed in acknowledgement but didn’t stop and in fact got bolder and moved his hand further down to cup his rear. Tony was seconds away from scolding him but broke out in laughter instead when Steve seized his kissing and suddenly began blowing against his skin, creating raspberries and tickling him. “Steve!”
“Yes.”
“Dick?” Steve supplied. “Penis? Erection? Meat? Sam’s favorite pastime and hopefully Rhodey’s, too?”
Those fifteen days of taking care of that egg were the most terrifying fifteen days of Tony’s life, but when he first saw the eggshell crack and the chirping from the baby cockatoo he knew he had to do everything within his power to make sure the baby bird grew up healthy and cared for. He expected the bird to fly away for freedom the moment he learned how to, but he hadn't expected for Jarvis to find a permanent spot on his shoulder instead, or for Jarvis to act as his second set of eyes, for both the ground and the sky.
In a last effort to not have everything they had done go to waste Tony snatched the alpha by the arm and pleaded. “I - I want it. Please, Steve. I want to, with you. As long as it’s with you it doesn’t matter.”
Tony couldn’t tell if the red on Steve’s cheeks were from embarrassment or the fire.
“What’s with the bags?” Sam asked when he noticed the luggage.
“He’s
Jan had a frown in her confusion, but it didn’t remain long. She understood his meaning. It wasn’t hard not to. Her eyes were wide with understanding. There wasn’t a single ounce of pity in them.
Steve made his way over, lying down on his belly right in front of Tony when he got close. “If you’re worried about that, you shouldn’t. If I know Hank he’s about to bring contraception for us. He’s probably getting the ingredients needed as we speak.”
So he waited, and waited, long after the seven days came and went. At the rate they were traveling they would cross all the land until they reached the west coast. Tony didn’t know if he should pin this success on Hammer’s and Stane’s thorough planning or if the two alphas were on a lucky spree or if Tony was merely on a very bad one.
Because they placed most of their focus trying to throw the other off Tony managed to pull off a full minute of running and almost reached a second before he felt someone pounce on him from his left and made him roll on the ground.
Tony mentally snorted, highly doubting Steve would be the smallest and skinniest child he’d ever see. Tony had already seen the smallest child, the scrawny alpha he had run into in that small town. Still, he tried to imagine the tall, muscled and powerful alpha that was Steve as the small child he was describing, but all that came to mind was Steve’s head and face connected to a skinny body and passing him off as weak. Somehow the look still matched Steve, in an odd sense.
Tony chuckled, “I’ll wait. In the meantime, you better get back to your pack and get looked at. Don’t want any broken bones on you.”
“No - but, you don't - you don't
He had no idea what Rhodey had threatened the alpha with, but whatever it had been it must have hit close to home for Steve. Tony had never seen such fury like this. Silent and boiling. Not even when Steve saved him from those rogue shifters.
“Amazing,” Bruce said. “I’ve seen a few cockatoos here and there but none of them compare to you, and you’re, what? A good three inches taller than most?”
Steve was the first to speak, looking concerned. “Something wrong?”
“Bury me,” he mumbled against the fabric of Steve’s shirt.
“Home sweet home,” Hammer said. If that was home Tony didn’t want to imagine the den. “Do you like it, Omega? I picked it especially for you. I figured we’ll stay here. Stay nice and cozy while the fire puts itself out.”
“What?” No he didn’t. Hank had every right to be upset with him for his carelessness.
Steve took a swing of his drink. They weren’t here to enjoy it, so Steve would do it for them. Not a drop would be wasted.
Oddly enough, the leader of the pack was walking with Tony and Bruce behind the line. More specifically, he was walking next to Tony’s left and was close enough to almost brush hands with a shift to the right, and also far enough so Tony had room to walk and avoid unwanted touches.
Steve’s forehead scrunched up. “I am interested.”
Tony gave a needy whine when the alpha pulled away. Just one bite, that was all he wanted. Just one.
“You're solid and you're still here, aren't you?”
, protecting, this was something he couldn’t deny. It was a skill he cherished most and now he was using it the way he’d always wanted. To protect those he loved.
He hadn’t dared bring up the truth yet. The fear returning and taking full force of him, turning him cowardly the moment Jan had left to join the others. The small hope of everything ending on a happy note that she had encouraged walked out along with her.
Steve didn’t join in on the laughter, too focused on apparently grooming Tony until every inch of him smelled of Steve. Tony had to wonder if he was truly fine with his friends staying. The last thing he wanted was to force Steve and move against his leadership. It was his pack, after all. He made the decisions, choosed who was to join and who was not, and Tony was grateful that he offered a place to stay for his friends, but just because Tony was his mate didn’t mean he had a say when the pack was involved.
“Where?”
Tony was nearly speechless. “But… but your career -”
“Oh, Tony,” Jan interrupted before kneeling to give Tony a hug. “I don’t know what any of us had said or done to make you wander off without letting us know but I swear I’m going to give them a smack or two for doing so.”
Tony tuned him out, shaking his head fondly. If ever Hank were given a moment to talk about his work he’d take it and run off with hours of the day. That man truly was proud of his alchemy.
“You’ll always be Boss, Boss.”
Tony was still confused. How did that tie in with Steve’s recent attitude with his friends?
Two weeks after finally breaking through the rage and regaining control, Steve keeps himself locked in his old bedroom. Empty and unused after having moved in with his omega years prior. There’s only the bed with stiff and musty smelling covers. No clothes in the closet or drawers. Nothing in the bathroom except six rolls of toilet paper, his toothbrush and a now broken mirror.
His breath hitched. “How did you -?”
“- Loki is trapped in a hole,” Bucky took a pause, plotting, “
He had to see what exactly he did, instead of letting his mind create the worst. Against his teammate’s advice, Fury’s recommendation and Tony’s pleading, Steve requests the video footage of SHIELD’s and the Avengers’ rescue. The footage of his confinement in the Hulk’s cell. Of everything they had available.
“Stay where you are, Tony, Darling,” Hammer said, smiling. “You wouldn’t want to strain yourself.”
“I think we need to renegotiate the deal we made together to include telling each other where the other will go alone to.” Bruce kneeled down and gently tapped Tony’s nose. “You are not allowed to do that again, Mister.”
“Keep talking like that and I'll give you a bath. See how nice and smooth your feathers will be after I'm through with them.”
His desperation grew as the seconds ticked by and Steve continued moving between his erection and back to his thighs and his folds. The heat burning and burning and burning in him. He needed so much. He needed more.
Every bit of warriors the ladies were and with nothing to lose now they all silently agreed to wage war against the Hulk. The giant was rightfully scared. In a smart move he grabbed both Clint and Bucky and held them up to protect himself from all the watery projectiles. Everyone else not wanting to partake in this battle to the death, but were unlucky enough to get caught in the crossfire chose to use the Hulk’s massive bulk to hide. They screamed like wounded wolves when the ladies’ impeccable aim (especially by one Peggy Carter) landed. Laughter soon followed.
It hurt thinking about it.
He paid no second mind to his naked glory and grabbed one of the many pails present. He scooped up some of the water resting in the tub and moved to stand on the section of the floor chipped off in a square shape with the drain in the middle. He touched the water experimentally before tilting the pail over his head and soaking his hair and portions of his body. The floor was crafted in a way that caused the water to slide down to the drain and Tony watched the water take small chunks of dirt and grass that had caught in his hair into it and disappear.
When they finally entered the tub of water it was everything Tony didn't know he could experience. Safe in his alpha's hold, warm, soothing water. Didn't remove or even diminished the potency of Steve's smell on him, but the waters did wonders to his old bones.
“Wait!”
What if he couldn’t do it? He could barely care for himself on some days. A pup needed more.
Hesitantly, Tony uncurled and faced forward. All the raiders were down, unconscious, lifeless, and on top of them stood the biggest and most vicious looking omega Tony had ever
She looked behind him in thought. “A couple of years. A little longer than the others,” she said with a nod to his pack.
“No,” Tony grinned. “He’s from across the sea, but really he’s an entire species of his own. With the attitude that comes out, he's a person in his own right.”
No, he couldn’t. Not again. He didn’t want it.
The coyote shrugged as best as he could. “Those are good odds considering how many have looked. You don’t want to know.”
“They usually don’t,” Hank offered. “The rest of the body needs the blood.”
doesn’t want me anymore.”
The alpha disappeared into the brush just as Clint, Sam and Thor decided to return back on land. Their furs were wet, they were dripping water all over the grass and they each had a variety of numbers of fish in their mouths each. Behind them near the edge of the river were three piles of fish, the biggest stacked up behind Thor. Clint and Sam looked to be a close tie.
. "Tony Stark."
Jarvis hadn’t remembered that night, could barely remember anything of his first month now with the memories of his youth slowly fading, but Tony could recall it clear as day. It was the night he realized how much he had to lose now, and how much power Hammer had gained.
It was at that moment that Ben and May caught up to them. They gave a brief glance at Steve but showed no ill towards him. Peter eagerly told them about everything that just transpired. His boy talked their ears off as Ben carried him down and May grabbed Tony’s harness. Their cue for ‘time to go.’
Surprise, surprise, surpriseeeee.
“Isn’t he? He’s an alpha, no? All alphas want is a warm hole to pleasure them. Did you manage to do enough to convince him to keep you around? Pity you couldn’t do the same for me, but maybe you’ve improved. If the great Captain has kept you this long then maybe you’re finally doing something right.”
He kept running and running, not really aware if the pack was chasing after him or not and not taking the risk to look back. He kept going and going, ignoring Jarvis calling out to him and not stopping until the cockatoo latched onto his back and bit his neck.
A short pause. “I feel there’s a ‘but’ somewhere in there.”
Tony should help them cut their losses by leaving by his own will. No sad faces, no confrontations, and no tears. Just a simple and clean “goodbye” and turn away and never look back.
“I’ll be happy to assist with that, Doctor Banner,” Jarvis flapped his wings.
it, but at the same time, he wasn't
The sun was high in the sky and the day already long started. Down the stairs Steve went with Tony safely tucked in his arms and wrapped comfortably in a clean blanket. On cue the moment one of their packmates heard the unmistakable footsteps of someone walking down the stairs and turned their head to the direction the rest were quick to follow as well and all together their eyes filled with mischief. Some of them were very impressed by the sight while others (Rhodey and Jarvis) not so much.
Tony didn’t really know what else to do to make an impression besides fixing Steve’s coat around his body and pressing away the wrinkles. As for his hair Jarvis was already working on that, grabbing strands with his beak and claws and adjusting any that strayed away and poked out.
“Great, we can use more company. The more the merrier.” Sam took a sniff. A moment of pause. “Wonder how long until Steve notices and comes running,” he commented.
“I don’t think you understand what you’re saying, Tony,” Stane took one step forward, “or understand the consequences that will follow. You’re tired and confused and need your alpha to help. Let’s go home so you can get proper rest and a clear mind.”
on the Avengers’ territory, threatening and attacking the Avenger’s pack members, and stealing the
“We talked about what this meant. She knows it’s serious, between you and me, and she’s hurt… but -”
,” Pepper scolded, the only reason they apparently needed. “You were gone, somewhere out there alone with no way to contact you. Of course we were going to leave in order to find you.”
“Huh, what a coincidence. Bucky’s name is James, too.”
Once Tony was stripped of his armor, a fairly easy task when all that was required was to switch off the arc rune and the pieces fell right off his body, he was laid back down on the ground and propped up against a tree trunk. Steve kneeled next to him and held him close. Rhodey took his other side. Jarvis claimed his left shoulder and Vision settled by his leg. All four refused to be far.
He must have fallen asleep shortly after. One blink he was on his side comfortably with a knot connecting them, and the next he was being shaken gently with no knot and no strong arms holding him anymore. Steve was hovering over his frame, pants on and hand on his shoulder as he stirred him awake.
“Are you having fun, Pete?” May asked the child sitting on Tony’s back. His height made it easier for May and Peter to be at eye level and for them both to see the large smile on Peter’s face.
“I know I’m not exactly a fine specimen,” he said with an awkward, brittle smile, “but at least I don’t look half bad for my age, right?”
He felt the weight on his chest shift and it could only mean that Jarvis was moving his head. He didn’t have to see Jarvis to know the cockatoo was staring right at him. “You wish to ask something else, Sir? What is on your mind?”
“Hank?”
Ben and May had talked to Tony about it. The two owned a plot of land but had no animals to call it home. Tony was really the only resident of the place. It fell down on him to make Peter's little dream come true. He was the one who was going to pull the carriage, after all, but his two carers would never force Tony to do so. If Tony was going to pull, it would be all by his own free will.
His tiny human boy was unchallenged and Tony was willing to die on this hill.
He went down the same path Steve had once taken him to watch the moon. He still remembered every step they took as if it had been yesterday. To think, all of that would lead him to today. How terrified he had been. How skittish. Now that he could look back to it, he could see how easily panicked he was. How little things that he now viewed as normal, had been so harmful to him in the past.
On the first of the next year, Tony was gone again but Steve wasn’t sad. He would just have to ask Santa to bring him back again.
“I know the risks,” Steve nearly barks, “but I’d rather risk a possibility than a guarantee.”
“The same underground land we found over in the deserted corners of Iceland? Close but there is an obvious lack of beast statues to curse us this time,” Tony began walking further into the land, getting closer and closer to the center.
instead of a some
“Not now at least. We got some time before we need to find some shelter for you to rest, which I
He felt Rogers’ eyes follow him. Even through the cabinet door blocking him from view, he felt those eyes burn him down.
Tony hummed in acknowledgment but otherwise continued re-reading the letter.
“Behave, both of you,” Steve retorted. “You want to be treated like pups, I’ll treat you like pups.”
“Are you the one responsible?” Tony was surprised to hear the intensity in Jan’s voice. The pure
“Couldn’t you have given me a chance to pretend I could outrun you?” Tony purposely pouted, twitching his paws that he had raised in the air.
Tony stared at them all in bewilderment. He had no idea what was going on, didn’t understand, and even Jarvis wasn’t following if the way he was twitching with uncertainty was anything to go by. Now he got what the Avengers were going through when they didn’t comprehend what Vision had said. He wanted an explanation but he got the feeling he wasn’t going to get it even if he asked.
A knock on the door had them turning. He had left it open upon entering and in the doorway stood Jan, knuckle against the frame. “Can I come in?”
“There goes my signature courting move.”
“It wasn’t you, it wasn’t you I swear -”
. The whole chest out, chin up and radiating smugness with a cocky grin that young alphas were prone to do when he answered. “Something like that.”
Would it be too much to hope the streets of the town were empty of civilians?
“You're mine, Tony!” Jan said with glee.
“We’d show you around the place, but you’re probably tired,” Steve continued, still giving one of those medal winning smiles. “We have empty rooms for you to take as your own. They’re mostly empty since no one has used them except for the occasional item left behind by Clint and Hank since they have a habit of leaving stuff everywhere. Doesn’t even matter if the rooms have been locked. They somehow manage it.”
“Look,” Sam said before anyone else could add to the teasing, “I’m sure there’s a story to tell about all this, and it’s not any of our business, but right you need to decide on what to do about your heat. Are you good with taking care of it outside with the sun watching over you? Or would you prefer a bed and walls?”
How was it so easy for Steve to say? Kids. Family. The possibility of having neither easily shrugged off. Tony being enough to give that much happiness. Tony… wasn’t worth that much love. Wasn’t worth all the love Steve looked at him with, but somehow the alpha thought the opposite and gave him everything.
had been the one in heat.” Tony covered his face with his hands and flopped back down on the bed. The youthful stamina in the alpha was cause for envy. If only Tony had a fraction of that stamina. Also, “I’m hungry.’
“There’s some towels here for you to use, some rags and different oils for you to pick from.” Steve pointed at everything mentioned. “Anything else you need?”
“And I haven’t considered courting anyone since making it official with Clint,” Sam added, saying it for both. “If he’s interested we’ll do the whole show. Compliments, flowers, walks under the moonlight and anything you three suggest to win him over and show we mean it. If he isn’t we’ll leave it alone.”
“This Inn deserves an even bigger tip than the other one, and then some.”
Tony understood why the crowd was telling tales, hell, he’d be doing it, too if he were honest. Seeing a famous pack walk across town and spotting two new additions among them, especially when those additions were two old omegas? He would be openly staring at them, as well. Didn’t make the situation any better seing as Bruce and him were the ones subjected to it.
A bit funny at parts, so please giggle at my attempts to be hilarious.
The alpha whined from pure happiness and Tony soon joined him when Steve began licking - no, not only licking -
“N-no! No, I didn’t mean -”
Simultaneously, everyone, including the beta Clint was trying to compliment, Bruce and even Jarvis, turned around to give the beta a dry look. So dry the area had practically turned into a desert. For a solid ten seconds they just stood there staring at him. Clint was apparently unaffected by the looks or just used to them because he remained as so with his crossed arms and eyes closed.
“That can’t be-” Steve stared wide eyed at the three statues. “They’re fictional characters.”
Steve preened, licking his hand and still getting the mess on it. Tony found he didn’t mind.
He didn’t even think about that. He was officially Steve’s mate, Steve’s omega, meaning he could take up Steve’s name and he could be a Rogers.
“How did she not hear or smell you? I can’t even smell you right now,” Tony sniffed his arm and sure enough he still couldn’t smell anything radiating off of Bruce. His natural scent was not there.
“...and I wanted to know if you’ve decided yet. I mean, you spent time with the pack and got to know us. Clint, Sam and Jan already like you and everyone adores Vision and think Jarvis is great. I know we have the title of famous war pack hanging over our heads but we’re really not that different, just another pack, and we’d love to include you in it. That is, if you’d like to join,” Steve managed, looking like he was going to pass out any minute.
“I’m hurrying. Keep your hat on.”
Steve quicken his movements and started grunting with every push. Tony moaned along with him as each thrust hit different spots in him and sent heat and pleasure all through his body. He could feel his walls practically squeeze around Steve with every push. Ready to keep him inside and refusing to let go. His body’s effort soon paid off as Steve’s thrust became erratic and just watching Steve lose control, getting just as much pleasure as Tony had gotten and creating something new, brought Tony to the edge. Tony came with a shout, clenching up and bringing Steve to his own climax. Tony cried again when he felt Steve bite down hard on the side of his neck over the old scar that once claimed him as Hammer’s. Steve marked over it, erasing it and leaving his own. It sent a shivering sensation all through his body and settled deep in his soul.
Even though his body tensed up the omega must have expected the question. He gave a forced smile and reserved eyes as if practiced. On his shoulder Tony could feel Jarvis hunching and slowly puffed up his feathers, preparing himself for anything.
Tony pushed himself back, dislodging the three from him. His ears and tail were low, showing his regret for making his friends worry. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you worry. Any of you. I didn’t know about the letters. I was - I was gone by that time… I think. Unless he… unless they managed to hide from me before that.”
True to his statement of feelings, Hank waved it away. “Go eat. I can hear your stomach growling from over here.”
“Says you.”
“I don’t think you have to worry about Loki sneaking up on you during the middle of the night. He seems to enjoy using his spells for fun and tricks when everyone is together. He wants others to see besides himself.”
Why did he believe he was strong enough?
“Steve slept in,” Bucky said for no particular reason other than being a wisecrack.
“Oh, Omega,” Hammer sighed, feinting concern. “You know I hate hurting you. You just upset me so much. What can I do? I have to discipline you. Getting yourself pregnant by another alpha is among the stupidest thing you could have ever done. It’s absolutely unforgivable. What would the neighbors say? No self-respecting omega would
But from the way Bruce raised his right eyebrow it was clear he had an idea of something.
“Come,” Natasha gestured her head to the stairs. “The sooner we take you the sooner you can rest.”
Jan smiled. “All the alphas are downstairs getting the plan together. Sam, Clint and Loki included because they’re just stubborn like that. Hank actually sent me to pass this along. Says I do better with conversations like this when really he has the social capability of a drunken ant.”
Jarvis flapped his wings and whistled for Tony’s attention. “Will you be finishing that, Sir?” he asked while eying the bitten peach.
“And to think we were worried about you. Tony having offed you and used you for his forge or thrown you down the river or tied you to your bed.”
“Give it to Hawkeye. We can’t afford to miss. Half of you stay outside or close to the wall. He’s going to attack when he’s hit. Don’t let him grab hold of you.”
“We can always assign other agents. I have an entire helicarrier of them willing to sign up for it,” Fury said with a gesture around the room. As if to prove his point many of the agents walking around the room and walking in and out of the tunnel turned their heads to look at them, hope shining in their eyes.
“You wanted to help,” Steve finished for him. Now that Tony was paying attention he noticed Steve’s head bobbing a little bit from the movement his wagging tail was causing. He was happy. “You wanted to make a difference, no?”
“Aye, come and join us for this early feast. Acquire as much sustenance as you are able for our journey ahead.”
“I can’t feel my legs.” Clint’s face was smothered in the lion’s made and caused his voice to be muffled.
?” Tony shouted.
“I am,” Tony got to his feet and made his way to the Hulk. Rhodey let out a sound of frustration before searching through the piles of unconscious and dead Hydra shifters for a ‘bigger’ gun. His eyes lit up after spying the biggest gun around. “
Somehow that explained everything and Tony nodded. If given the opportunity he’d probably do the same with Bruce once he was sure physical contact was accepted without the omega flinching. Perhaps one day. In the meantime, Sam had managed to dislodge Clint from his lap and was now standing, patting away the dirt on his legs.
“Got you!” Jan cheered with her tail wagging in victory. She only had a second to celebrate before Clint decided win or lose he was going to join the small pile. He tackled her and caused them both to land on Tony, who had the wind literally knocked out of him.
“She’s around. Probably scaring half of the committee for their incompetence, but she’s there.” Rhodey eyed the carriage he was pulling while waving at Peter when Peter waved at him. “You went ahead with it then. How’s carriage life?”
“I shall haunt him in his dreams tonight,” Loki said in a promise, breaking the silence. Everyone appeared to approve of the offer, nodding together before continuing the travel.
“Seems a bit of both,” Tony released a laugh when he witnessed Clint swim after something in the water only to collide with Thor. He tried recovering by using Thor as a step and hop over him but instead one of his paws slipped and he landed face first back into the water, knocking Thor over along the way.
Steve rubbing in his seed on his skin was the
“You didn’t let me…” he trailed off with a look to the spot, letting Steve know what he meant. He took notice of Steve not-so-discreetly wiping his left hand on his dark pants. So that was why.
“Yeah, but I didn't insult it.”
He doesn’t remember the faces of the alphas he later learned he killed with his own fangs. What he does remember is biting down on the many faceless, black shadows that screamed and screamed and struggled under him. He remembers their cries. Loud and wordless. Intangible in their panic and powerless in his grip.
The beta now named Clint made an exaggerated face at the pair. “Ugh, it’s too adorable. It burns.”
“They’re on that side of the shacks!”
“What are you doing?”
Breakfast was a small affair between them both. To prepare for the long trip and to avoid overindulging that would result in a slower pace and less stamina they ate a small share of fruits, bread and cheese and rationed any extras. Tony made sure to sneak a few more for Jarvis.
He never saw Rogers pushing him against the wall and kissing him coming. The move was so rough his bottom lip tore from the impact. It shocked Tony. He kissed back more out of reflex than anything. His legs dangled helplessly as Rogers held him up by his strength alone. It shocked him, even more, when he felt a very protruding bulge pressing against his thigh. Hard and pulsing and very obvious in those tight jeans Rogers was wearing.
That betrayal gave him a second chance, and he was going to make every second count.
With a sigh Tony continued walking, determined not to let the prickling pain in his legs show, and if his head hung a little lower than before, well, it wasn’t like any of them were going to point it out. It was what they wanted to see, after all.
! What do I have to do to get you out of my life! Why can’t either of you just
His alpha kept pressing against him, making him lie down with his belly flat against the ground and Steve’s front leg over his shoulder. Well… at this rate their moon run wasn’t going to continue, and everyone seemed to come to an agreement for it, seeing as they all had already gotten comfortable by sitting or lying down. Thor sat upright and managed to loom over them all with the black python that was Loki wrapped around his mane. Rhodey, Pepper and Happy kept a safe distance away from him, looking very uncomfortable at having a giant lion with a python so close. Tony could easily imagine their tails between their legs.
Yeah, sorry about this. Cliffhanger.
That made Rhodey pause, apparently the answer he was looking for because he looked remorseful as he said, “Far too long.”
“You have more company. I’d say yours. Better to stay in familiar territory,” even though he had said this Tony could notice how anxious Bruce had become. There was a fear of something engraved there. Perhaps his old pack was the reason for it, or perhaps it was learned from the experience of living in the shacks. Tony didn’t know how long Bruce had stayed here or how neglectful or physically violent the treatments could have gone behind doors. All he knew was a protective instinct flared up in him and he should might as well offer to share a shack together for their makeshift-pack that they were completely unaware they were creating.
The sight at the end had anyone lucky enough to have witnessed their posturing looking twice and rubbing their eyes in case they were seeing illusions. For at the end of the line were three new shifters, and two of those shifters were

created nothing but weapons.”
“I know,” Tony nodded, “and I understand.”
“Even if I did, you’re a smart woman. You’ll ignore me.”
This child went and decided to keep his word. Made Tony his omega. Just like that.
“You really do,” Clint said. “All teasing aside, you look stunning and incredible and outstanding and whatever else you could comment to someone positively.”
“I…,” no, that couldn't be. Jarvis had never lied before, but he was supporting Rhodey’s claims. He wouldn't start lying now… “what?”
“Told you,” Clint said.
The door soon opened after the noises died down and in came Steve, sweaty and breathing heavily but looking very excited. “Tony,” he said before leaning down and giving him a quick kiss on his cheek. “Come on, I want to show you something.”
Used to his pack’s teasing but still flushing slightly from their words Tony was able to brush them aside in order to focus on the ones he was conscious about. Bruce gave him an encouraging nod upon their eyes making contact. “You’ll be the center of attention the moment you enter a room, no denying that.”
Tony wanted to growl, but he knew the act would only encourage Hammer’s ire. The alpha was not joking when it came to threatening those Tony cared about. Tony had learned long ago the alpha would be true to his warnings. Had learned first hand what would happen if he misbehaved when Hammer nearly clipped Jarvis of his wing when he had only been two months old.
“You both will be the death of me,” he muttered as he sat upright.
The alpha released him. No doubt bruises were going to appear and match his exact hand.
“I am,” he said as he pushed his hips down. He could enjoy and take satisfaction from their coupling before the actual penetration happened and brought with it its pain. “I am.”
Steve gave a reassuring smile if a little sheepish. “I’m not going to hurt myself. It’s been a while, though. I need to get used to it again.”
“Perhaps, if there was a significance to it.”
Steve growled and crouched down, ready to dash. “No one is testing any theories.”
Tony's mind blanked out for a second. He opened his mouth to ask what Steve meant but couldn't find the words.
Tony broke and the tears spilled without his control. He cried and cried, his sobs growing louder after every intake he managed. He cried from what nearly happened, cried because of what they had been so close to doing, cried because he had been so close to reliving the nightmare all over again, and cried because, for the first time in so long, someone stopped it. Someone stopped it and
Also included in this list is the couple I had already considered, Jan/Hank!
However, no one would stand with the wealth and influence as Hammer did if they were an idiot.

scent was carried by the winds and lured anyone close enough to get a sniff.
There was a constriction in his chest. “Are you sure, Brucie?”
“If there was it’s long gone by now. Whoever got cursed is probably out looking for answers like us.”
She held out her hand. A small vial of clear liquid rested on her palm. “Take this. It’s something he cooked up for us. More effective than what you find selling in stalls or alchemy shops. Keeps our heats and ruts under control for a longer time than common remedies. Perfect for long travels, like this one we’re about to do.”
What if Steve wasn’t even ready to
To most he would appear as a dimwit, a nonsense man, taking risks that many with an ounce of sense know to be reckless. Such as selling to people who can very easily turn on him. Cheating a smith who was twice the size and had the temper to use it.
Steve’s sharp intakes of air were a reason for concern but the alpha seemed adamant to get them to their destination. Tony’s previous unease was overshadowed by Steve’s current state. He had no time to think about the citizens or their reactions to seeing the Hulk or their judgmental expressions over his unplanned cycle. He didn’t give their shocked gasps or their hurry to hide from the large wolf’s sight a second thought.
Tony honestly didn’t know the problem. What had he done wrong this time? “I - we’re having sex… aren’t we?”
. His smell was so different from Hammer’s. It wasn’t harsh or sharp or heated and didn’t make Tony feel as if he was almost choking on it. No, it was soft and fresh and calming and made Tony feel at ease, protected, and made his blood pump slightly. Tony just wanted to bury himself in the coat and never come out.
Tony. His beautiful mate standing with the help of a crutch, a cast on his leg and a sling on his arm. His face, no longer covered in bruises, now painted with dark circles under his eyes. Tony looked a shell of his former self. Thinner than before. His usual bright and beautiful brown eyes now haunted. Red and puffy. Scared. Terrified.
He wasn’t the only one to notice. “Easy,” Sam said, “you know I wouldn’t do that to you, Cap. None of us would, but you gotta give us leeway here. It’s finally happening after all this time? We’re going to tease you, and you’re going to deal with it.”
omegas we wouldn’t have spent so much time introducing you to the dames.”
“What do you think?”
Steve kissed his nose in response and Tony couldn’t help resting his head on his shoulder and burying his face and relaxing to his scent. His alpha walked them out of the room, down the hall and down to the room where their bath was waiting. Steve chucked the blanket away, throwing it next to a pile of clothing already set for them. It seemed Steve had gotten more than just their bath ready.
Tony found the answer to his question. Yes, it was worth it. Even if he had to give his omega friend a talking to and teach the cockatoo some manners. He certainly didn’t remember the feathery menace being this snarky before.
While the pair of betas were bantering to each other Tony took the opportunity to gain as much distance as possible, trying to stay low in order to have less friction against the wind. True to their hunting instincts Jan and Clint moved the moment they heard the first crunch of the grass and saw Tony head for cover behind two partnered trees with very large roots sprouting out the ground. The two still had their challenge going, trying to outdo the other while lessening the distance between them and Tony. At certain points during the running they even tried compromising each other by biting the other’s paws and bumping into them. It was all playful, of course, but it was still a game of first and neither wanted to lose.
“I thought it was obvious. I’m always a sucker for hugs. Didn’t you say the other guy was a cuddler? Where do you think he got it from?”
“Has he stated he wishes for children?”
He had long accepted it to be, but now, under the care of the Avengers, under the care of good friends and under the care of Steve, his body was jumping back. He was healthier. The healthiest he’d ever been under his old pack. Under his father’s pack.
Loki released a hiss before answering. “They did.”
When he finished shifting he waited for Steve to make a move. The alpha was still on top and tucked near his neck and surely felt the change happening. He knew what had just occurred and when he pulled back to take a good look there was no stopping his golden tail from moving absurdly fast and thumping on the ground.
“Don’t you worry your little head about that. I’ll have someone within the hour no problem. Just came in to grab a quick drink.” He made his way over to the cabinet to grab a glass. Now was a good time as any to enjoy something strong. He wasn’t going back out after this.
Steve moaned against his lips, hands consciously - or unconsciously - kneading his cheeks and running over his thighs. The twitch of strength that occasionally made itself known by squeezing enough to possibly leave bruises showed how much the alpha was holding himself back, showing an incredible feat of control. Tony had a small moment of guilt for making the alpha suffer and quickly moved to remedy that. He reached down between his legs to palm the bulge under him. He was shocked to find the bulge felt larger than he had expected, far larger than what he had ever felt with Hammer, and this was with Steve still wearing his pants.
Also walking close to them was Bruce who took up Tony’s right side and Natasha who took up Bruce’s own right. The grumpy alpha by the name of Bucky walked on Steve’s left. Both he and Natasha appeared to be keeping a watchful eye out and were searching the area every few minutes for any immediate danger. Ahead of them were the rest of the Avengers following dutifully after Sam and Clint while balancing their meals.
Hammer and Stane had a plan for him, but every plan had holes to exploit. Tony just needed to find the right one.
Thoughts about Steve didn’t help matters.
“Tony? Breathe with me. Come on, breathe. In. Out. In. Out. That’s it. Keep breathing with me.”
have done that to him.
“Are you sure? I don’t want you doing something you’re uncomfortable with.”
The beta took steps back but Bruce followed attentively, one after the other, and in a voice that sounded nothing like Bruce’s usual calm and timid tone said, “You will leave us alone.”
Hammer was never one for honeyed words. In all his time under Hammer’s care, Tony had never heard him say any endearments and actually mean them. He had only ever said them when he was displeased or disappointed with him but wouldn’t act on his feelings, restraining himself.
Tony had not stopped on Steve’s shield alone. He had adjusted Natasha’s and Bucky’s and Sam’s weapons to carry more power for each hit and tightened Clint’s bowstring for greater speeds without affecting his handling. While doing so, he also mentally listed methods to improve every weapon his packmates used with runes and thought of equipment perfect for each of their unique styles. He had been itching to get to work on them the moment he first mentally drafted the items.
Claiming the alpha. Dare he believe Steve belonged to him just as much as he now belonged to Steve? He could still feel a sting pulsing through his body from the bite mark on his neck with every beat of his heart. He was claimed now, his neck proudly showing what he had recently craved with all his might. No one would mistake him as a single shifter. As for Steve… he wondered if the alpha would ever allow him to leave a bite mark of his own.
Thank you, RerumTechnologies for being my beta in this chapter.
The Hulk’s eyes narrowed. It was no verbal answer but it was enough. It caused everyone to stare at him in a new light. There were more questions in their minds. That was obvious, but at that moment it wasn’t the right time. Not while in enemy territory and Tony’s current situation. That and Natasha was beginning to glare. A glaring Natasha was someone none of them dared to face. Not even Loki.
“Am I ever glad to see you,” Sam said. “I thought for sure we were going to have to put up with a sulking Steve. That’s something you
. This
The reasoning was sound, Tony guessed, and it was true that Bruce had his own secret to keep. Besides, it wasn’t as if Bruce was going to ask him to make rune weapons or anything. He sighed and reached out to pet Vision. “The last people who knew about my skill wanted me to make weapons. Used what they could to force me. I really don’t want others to know, not again.”
what his touches were causing. Good, wholesome leader of the Avengers, famously known as the Captain, may not be as wholesome as Tony had originally thought. Not with the way each circle caused his lower half to pulse with renewed want and need. He whined when Steve’s fingers touched near his dick
“Hey!”
The rest of the Avengers were talking amongst themselves. Tony listened in while trying not to appear as if he was actually listening. It was hard to do. Their dinner was finished cooking and each already had slices of their own. The Thor fellow hogging most of it, probably claiming two whole stags for himself. Because of their food, they started talking about one of their many hunting experiences and were in the middle of a tale that involved Thor throwing Clint for some reason and ending with him getting stuck on a tree. Tony couldn’t stop the snicker that escaped him in time and earned himself a playful glare from the beta because of it. Steve, who hadn’t said much after getting his share of the food gave him a fond look after the snicker and started laughing himself.
They all congratulated Steve and reaffirmed their happiness for finally ‘settling down’ and each, interestingly enough, thanked Tony for managing to ‘wrangle’ the alpha’s free spirit. Tony had half a mind to correct their statements. If anyone had done any wrangling, it was Steve. Sweet and patient Steve, who took every broken piece of Tony in stride. Who made sure to show Tony how much the alpha cared for him and had tried and was still trying to painstakingly erase all the damage Hammer and Obie and Howard had previously done to him. One little slow step at a time.
“We came looking for you,” Pepper confirmed to him. “Oh, Tony… the moment we heard we immediately packed everything we needed and traveled the lands for a single clue to where you could’ve gone.”
Tony stared dazedly at the plate of delicious smelling cakes. He just wanted to sink his teeth in it and lick up the entire plate, but even as the others stressed the welcoming he still hesitated. He couldn’t. Not until the others took the first bite.
If Steve had taken notice of Tony’s use of ‘Captain’ in order to place distance he didn’t say anything. His smile, however, did disappear and his tail slowly stopped wagging. He was the spitting image of a sad animal, and Tony almost felt sorry for him. Almost. Steve was an excellent actor, but Tony wasn’t going to fall for it.
Jan gave an encouraging squeeze of his arm. “Besides Bucky’s poor choice of words, we all agree that you look absolutely fantastic in this outfit, Tony. Words can’t begin to describe it.”
Tony and Bruce exchanged looks, appearing a little startled. They wouldn’t do that, would they?
I hope you enjoy! <3
“Ah, forgive me. Was I meant to?” From the way Thor was still grinning it was obvious he wasn’t sorry at all.
Their fur had Tony sighing longingly. Not for the color but for how smooth and well-kept and healthy it looked. Even Thor’s mane looked properly brushed and Tony doubted he’d find a hair out of place in the many dark strands.
Eyes going down and with a sigh Tony accepted it. Why fight against destiny?
, avoided.
Then the next day.
“I like the wings,” Steve tried defending. “It added to the fantasy of adventuring and they were unique.”
“We will have many opportunities to travel together, but this one will not be it. Do you understand?”
noticed his hesitation in the beginning. Great.
“Come for me, Sweetheart.”
“Sure is. You let me handle those pesky weapons and focus on anything else that comes in. You’d be surprised how many shifters bring their dented kitchenwares in here. You’ll have hours assigned on just them.”
“Why should I?”
They all looked so healthy and most importantly happy. So of course it naturally had nearly been ruined.
helped him
Perhaps not, but Tony couldn’t shake the feeling he
Tony couldn’t help but laugh along with him. “No, they didn’t.”
“Forget it, Tones. This is a fight you’re not going to win,” Rhodey grinned.
“If it isn’t Steve Rogers,” someone’s voice, a feminine, unknown voice, said above the sounds of the inn.
No, no,
Tony had to wonder what stories the others carried on their shoulders, for Steve to suggest to hear them first. Had they suffered their own struggles? Had their own personal demons? Had their own Stane and Hammer who took everything?
“How about it? Want to spend the day with us not doing anything?” Sam asked, gesturing at them all.
Tony’s arm trembled. Anger flowed through his veins.
“Did we, uh, meet the Avengers?”
Clint pushed the door further opened, revealing himself ready with his armor on, his bow on his back and a quiver hanging on his waist and strapped down in place on his thigh. In his arms he held pieces of armor. Hides and iron. Light in his hold, but no doubt heavier than it looked. “Came to give my old set. Even brought the good boots.”
“That does sound horrible,” he caught his breath. Calm. Be calm. “How long have you known him?”
Peter grabbed for the reins when it was all set and ready. Like on the television, he began to crack them, saying words ranging from ‘mush’ to ‘giddy-up.’ All in vain to get Tony moving. He didn’t budge until Ben gave him the go-ahead.
There had once been a time where Tony had been proud of his own work as well. Back when he believed he had been helping. Perhaps… he could do so once again.
But even so the smart choice didn’t guarantee the wanted results. Steve was quick to answer, “No,” and Tony deflated.
Bruce offered him a grateful smile, his eyes shining in familiarity. Three or so minutes later and he appeared ready to continue and they walked down through the trees after the same route they had taken the previous day. The closer they got to the open spot next to the river the more the fluttering in Tony’s chest increased. His palms were sweaty and hands were shaking and his hunger was momentarily forgotten, pushed in favor of the nervous feeling in his stomach.
“Honestly, Steve, I’m disappointed in you,” Peggy mocked from the front, already fitting back into her old pack as if she had never left. She had rejoined the Avengers, yielding her leadership of the Howling Commandos and leaving Sharon to take her place. It had been a surprising choice, Tony had thought. To leave a beta in charge when two alphas were present and capable. One would assume the pack hierarchy would be used to decide the next shifter to be the pack leader, but perhaps that was only Tony. He probably should have learned a while ago his packmates, and in turn everyone they were acquainted with, were not keen on following expectations.
“You did say we're allowed to scare you once.” Tony had half a mind to throw something at Bruce.
Tony huffed and began tapping again. “You have to get up eventually. I can’t exactly walk back to the shacks with a hunk of wolf taking up my lap.”
“Hey, Tony,” Ty said in a voice that was meant to be sultry, yet was anything but. He followed him. “Did you enjoy the race?”
. “Thank you, thank you so much, Sir.”
The hours that followed were uneventful until noises of metal against metal began to start from the outside. There was trembling from the floor, someone shouting orders, and three packmates trying their damnedest to look innocent but ultimately failing.
“Tony, I’m not invincible.”
“It’s nice to meet you, Tony.”
muscle, not a lot granted, but compared to the pasty shifters, they were defined and toned.
They had agreed to stick together, and Bruce not pushing them away and actually initiating physical contact was always a plus. Going to the northern shacks located near a city was vetoed and so they headed east instead where roads were plentiful and trees expanded as far as the eyes could see. They still ended up stopping in a town during their travels. Bruce required a new set of clothes to replace the ones the Hulk had ripped.
“Not much?”
“You betray me.”
“I just can’t grasp why you believe you don’t deserve me. I’m nobody special or important, Tony.”
He had been so young and naive, but now he understood his place. Why fate decided him as omega. It was fitting. In the end, he wasn’t meant to lead a pack or join in battle or stand amongst those worth ten of others. He was just Tony and, as life had taught him, he wasn’t worth even a proper one. No amount of white lies would ever change that.
“Rhodey, no, I can’t let you do that.”
Steve grinned, face far too shiny for this hour of the day. “We’ll see.” With one quick glance aimed at Tony and one gentle touch that brushed his fingers on Tony’s lower back he walked to the front of the cart and gestured to the empty space in-between the handles. “Get it going, Loki, and we’ll be on our way.”
By focusing on his voice, on Jarvis’ movements on his back and Vision’s soft rocking, he managed to. Tony inhaled slowly, stopping his mind from racing. Calm, he could manage calm. Hear what Rhodey wanted to say.
“And what if it is?” Tony’s voice was soft, just above a whisper. Vulnerable.
The pile stopped moving when he came closer. “Sir?”
Loki slithered forward, closing in the circle further. “You have said your peace. Say no more.”
He released a huff that was followed by a grunt when Steve licked the spot on his neck usually chosen to leave a mark. Steve’s tongue went over the area three times before he sunk his teeth gently to nibble, biting away an itch, and Tony found… he wanted Steve to mark him. He wanted to belong to the alpha, to be his.
The reveal didn’t seem to bother Steve. “I do. It’s a little different from what we’ve done so far, but the idea is still the same. You just lie there and I’ll do all the work for now. We’ll find what we enjoy together.”
Pepper cheered his name before running to him, just as excited and so damn happy as he felt. He stopped just inches before they made contact, letting Pepper decide on what to do. She met him by slowing down as well, bumping their heads together before standing on her hind legs to bat at him with overwhelming affection. She then curled around his neck to mimic a hug.
Just something I'm thinking about and if you want to endulge me. Do you have a song that matches with Tony or his situation or even the Avengers for here? I'm thinking about a playlist, but I don't have many songs to go with this fic.
“What did someone do to change your mind? Was it Steve? Clint? So help me if someone insulted you -”
“Tony…” Steve managed, resting his forehead on Tony’s shoulders to stop any temptation. “Not until you’re ready. Not until you’re ready…”
It was a prison. His prison.
Even if Tony had to share Steve’s affection with another, he still had everything. He would find happiness. Find it with his pack, with his friends, with his family. If he never came to love Sharon, he’d still have his family.
The smut in this fic will only come from Steve and Tony, so if you're worried about sexy times with these ships or any of the other ones you have nothing to fear! However, if you do want to read sexy times for any of the other ships I apologize in advance and I'll try making up for it with somewhat good written smut scenes.
That was an insult if Tony ever heard one from Jarvis and he sneakered. Jarvis wasn’t going to outright bring out his guns since the beta, or any of the Avengers, hadn’t done anything to earn his wrath, but being a bird didn’t mean he was going to take that kind of talk sitting down. From the way the beta had his mouth opened and the others were all looking equal parts amazed and amused he figured they weren’t expecting it.
While Tony felt horrible for having made Bruce wait and keeping him from the food, he was extremely grateful that he wasn’t heading down to the others alone. The nervousness lessened considerably with the other omega by his side. Nothing compared to the previous morning.
Jarvis whistled and turned his head to look at Bruce with one eye. “Pleasure, Mister Banner.”
Tony snickered into the fabric of Rhodey’s coat.
” Damn his cheesy alpha and the romantic side he had going.
“We understand, Hank,” Steve reassured, speaking for them all. “Everyone get what you need and meet up at May’s corner. We’ll round up everything on the cart and head home.”
“I’m certainly feeling the support here.”
When they reached the spot Tony found it was exactly how the two betas described it. There was a spot of open ground with grass decorating the surface and trees that were each partnered with a bush sprouting delicate looking red flowers. There was hardly any sun beside the few rays that managed to pass through the leaves and a few feet away was the river mentioned, softly flowing and making the forest smell of fresh water.
Something in him screamed in agony. His mate remained motionless. Lifeless to the world. To him. He curled around his mate, protecting what little he could. Desperate to keep him close.
“Ignore him,” Sam trotted over to the pair. “Loki loves to blow things out of proportion. A lot of folks look, but only three have actually disappeared.”
“I'm sorry,” he said eventually, apologizing for everything that had happened.
“How about I keep my bones intact?”
Bruce sighed in defeat, accepting the response. Jarvis switched from Tony's shoulder to Bruce’s and nipped his ear while Vision gently bumped against his leg. Wordlessly they agreed to wait until Bruce returned to a reasonable state before heading to where the Avengers were resting. It wouldn’t do to have the omega twitchy and jumping at every possible trigger with them. Tony offered his coat, hoping the familiar scent of a friend helped sooth away the anxiety. He was still wearing Steve’s coat so it wasn’t as if he needed it.
When Tony’s eyes adjusted from the light of the newly lit torch it wasn’t an improvement from the darkness. He would have preferred staying in ignorance than knowing where exactly Hammer wanted to lock him up in the fort.
“You came looking for work,” the alpha stated, clearly surprised by the reveal.
Clint grinned from behind Steve. “Who said we need a table to finish eating? We can eat anywhere, trust us. You got someplace you’re heading we can use?”
If possible he turned pinker and whirled around to his pack in order to hiss something. One of the pack members, a female alpha with intense red hair, rolled her eyes and walked past the stuttering alpha. She marched right up to the two omegas, causing them to tense up. If she picked up on it she didn’t say anything. She simply put her hands on her hips and said “Our pack leader is interested in recruiting you. What do you say?”
This is fluff, angst, comfort, angst, comfort, bit of smut and more angst. All in that order.
Bruce opened his mouth to answer but didn’t get a chance to say a word. A howl from a distance away rushed through the trees and made them freeze. It wasn’t a howl to signal victory or signal a start or even a playful howl for the moonlit night to carry. No, it was a howl to call everyone together in emergency. The howl was meant to call for help.
It didn’t take long for Jarvis and Redwing to find something suitable. Jarvis whistled for their attention and said a curt “This way,” before turning to fly towards Redwing. They all dutifully followed after the cockatoo, dragging their feet as the activities of the day were finally catching up with all of them.
, we're supposed to be bathing, not making it worse.”
He surged forward inside, dragging Steve along, who was chuckling good naturedly at his excitement, and found everyone already gathered and waiting.  All of them were present and wearing just enough to be considered decent and be able to easily take off for shifting, all of them except for Bruce, who Tony barely realized wasn’t going to join them on the run, not when his shift form was the Hulk. It was like a bucket of cold water was thrown on Tony. Here he was, excited to take part in a moon run with his new pack, but Bruce wouldn’t have the same pleasure.
He wanted to, he wanted to so much, but he felt exhausted now. The idea of just staying inside and doing nothing sounded great, but he couldn’t do that to Steve. “I am.”
He fucking
The list went on and on until Tony’s own name was thrown in the pile. To find a Steve all one needed was a Tony.
to be won, and Steve would never allow them to undervalue themselves to simple appearances and skills. Not that Sharon would accept it sitting down. Tony imagined she was the kind of beta who argued right back and wouldn’t stand for prejudice on her person, not even from Steve. While Tony… well, on a good day he was lucky he could ask for help on mundane matters from his packmates without feeling a burden on them. They had
Steve was in deep thought as he curled his fingers on a strand here and there. Tony took that moment to admire him. Admire his large blue eyes. His jaw and chin fit for an alpha of his stature. Hardly a single line of age in sight. If he focused hard enough he could see the fraction of a second where one eyelid blinked slower than the other. What an interesting quirk. He wondered if Steve was aware of it.
Tony Stark lived a very promiscuous life. Often, the first thought that came to mind at the mention of his name was his very sluttish behavior. It was no secret he had sex. It was on his title, under his resume, probably in some autobiography someone was currently writing and listed on the very top of his wiki page.
“Stop trying to steal my Tony, you jackal. Get your mate to take care of it. In fact, maybe this will get Rhodey going.”
was why. He thought it was a typical alpha moving in on another alpha’s territory and needing to defend it, not fearing his mate was going to run off with another alpha and leave him behind. “I’d -
Steve slowed his pace, causing the pack to halt as well, and searched the area. “We’ll rest here for the night.” Everyone sighed simultaneously. Tony wasn’t the only one relieved to rest. “Between those trees,” Steve pointed at an open spot with surrounding trees that could be used as cover.
Tony hummed and closed his eyes to fully enjoy the feeling of his alpha’s knot. “At least one of us is enjoying it. Maybe I got sprayed by something? I’ll have to figure out what so we can use it again later.”
“You don’t have to say anything. I just wanted you to know.” Steve lifted his head up to stare at the ceiling. “I want you to know how much I love you. So much it almost hurts. My chest feels heavy each time I look at you and I fall a little more in love from it. I want to see you every day. I want to see your smile, hear your laugh, learn about everything that makes you happy and the things that make you sad. I want to see your best and your worst and feel you in my arms every hour of every day and make sure you're eating and getting plenty of rest.” He looked down again, blue eyes connecting with brown. “I love you so much that the thought of losing you is… is… I can’t even say it.”
As predicted the Avengers followed the order and didn’t say another word about Tony’s situation, but strangely enough they did so with wide grins on their faces. Bucky, who was sitting on Steve’s other side, let out a snort, shook his head and said “Ever the protective one. I get the feeling you’re going to become unbearable after this. I’m going to need drinks.”
“You can’t be serious.”
Jarvis did a bird impression of a snort and even covered his beak with his wing to mimic a human hiding their face in amusement. Bruce, who was sitting on Tony’s right, released a chuckle that turned to an open laugh as Vision continued. He managed to pick up some of Vision’s wordings over the course of the time they were together and Tony knew Bruce had an idea of what the machine had said. The Avengers, however, had no clue on what was going on and perked up in interest, wanting to know what had been said that caused Tony to blush furiously. Steve especially. He searched for an explanation, almost desperate to know the reason for Tony’s blush.
With one loud moan he did just that for Steve, soaking the watered floor and his alpha’s fingers with his slick.
“I - yes, yes it’s beautiful,” he managed. The flush returned, but this time it wasn’t from misery. Still, even momentarily distracted he couldn’t stop his thoughts from returning back to his unstable emotions. “I’m sorry for - for what had happened. I don’t know why I… I -”
“Yeah, yes I do.” He sighed again. The hesitation and fear was still present, but the smallest of hope of everything turning out just fine built up. “What am I going to say?”
“An armor set just for you. I even painted it blue.”
I need water.”
“It’s nearly flooded on more than one occasion because of them,” Jan agreed.
be the ones overwhelmed,” from Bucky and it did
“Ben,” the alpha said. “Call me Ben.”
“How about I just scare you once?”
walking?”
“With all due respect,” Jarvis pecked him softly on the cheek, “your sanity is not at risk, Sir. Your humility, however, may not be left unscathed.”
“You’re in your head again. What has you distracted?”
Tony that’s not sex, not when you’re clearly hurting yourself
The Avengers were also openly staring at him and Bruce now, shifting their gazes back and forth. They were waiting for an introduction, no doubt, since Bruce was making no effort to try and talk to any of them. Hopefully, they didn't take it as an insult and decide to retaliate. The last thing any of them wanted was to cause Hulk to make an appearance. At that moment it really wasn’t a great time and Tony did
The machine whistled a ‘you’re welcome’ before asking to be picked up. Tony cradled him under his arm, using his hip to hold him still and made for the door, picking up his pack with the few coins he still had inside along the way. He didn’t know if the others were already awake or what time they were supposed to be ready to head out, but it was better to be safe than sorry and head down and wait. Better he be the one to wait instead of keeping his new pack waiting on him. Even if the panic from the previous day haunted him a little. Just the thought of joining the others and possibly experience another distressing scene made him nervous.
The silence that followed was deafening. His heart beating in his ears. Outside were only faint footsteps, steady and close, and the splitting of gravel from the carriage’s rushing wheels. Nothing erratic like the previous sounds from fighting to hold onto Pepper. No shots from hunting down a feathery cockatoo. There was no screeching nor flapping of wings. No sounds that Jarvis was well and alive. No Jarvis. No Pepper.
He had so many people to thank for his healing.
He wasn’t, but with a new option present and Jan to help settle the situation, maybe the reprimand and his place among the pack won’t be so bad. “I am.”
was the alpha Steve had talked to him about. Steve’s previous second in command and the one who would knock Bucky unconscious for speaking out of line. Of course she knew the others. She used to be part of the Avengers pack.
Did that mean Steve had never claimed someone else before him? Had he never had a young and rushed love that ended in separation? Someone out there didn’t carry an old bite wound that had belonged to Steve once?
“I didn't mean to, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Tony, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm not mad, I'm not upset, not with you. I'm sorry.”
“You really have nothing to worry about,” Sam said after everyone shifted had settled down.
“Contraception?” What kind?
The sounds of clattering metal rang around them. Their packmates all took off the heavier pieces of their armor, leaving the lighter material that still offered protection for the night. Tony jumped a little when one set of armor landed too close for comfort. The culprit responsible smiled at him. Proud to have caught him off-guard.
“Reason for it?” When Tony nodded the alpha continued. “I’m not going to ask. Your history is your history and if you experienced something that’s kept you from making weapons than that’s your business. Just, indulge me for a moment, would you? You don’t have to give me an answer if you don’t want to.”
It terrified him to no end knowing he was completely alone and being hunted.
“He would've given them heart attacks and that's it,” Tony assured him.
“Yes you did,” Bucky interrupted. “You meant every force on that bite of yours. Your friend was in danger so you reacted. Not like any of us haven’t done the same. Just don’t make biting me a habit. My mate won’t enjoy seeing someone else’s mark on me.”
Steve walked over to the cart. “Might have broken my shield in half but at least it lets me know it did its job. Now it’s time to break in this one.”
Bucky grunted, unable to respond with his mouth full of food.
,” Tony growled, slamming the cabinet door. “Kids don’t understand what we do outside of the Avengers and if they somehow ask about the birds and the bees because they read some tabloid they shouldn’t have gotten their hands on in the first place then that’s their parents’ responsibility. This has worked for me for the past twenty years. Don’t rock the boat.”
He gingerly made his way over to Hank. He searched for any signs of the beta not wanting company before taking a seat a distance away and getting comfortable. Hank didn’t react to his presence, remaining still and thoughtful. Tony kept quiet, waiting for the beta to say what he wanted.
To be honest not all of them were glaring. Most of them had green faces of envy while others tried their best to show they were indifferent by very obviously turning their heads to ignore them. The ones that were staring with spite were very few, but their angered eyes made it feel as if there were twice as many.
“Ben,” Tony repeated, smile on his face. “I’m Tony.”
Steve and Rhodey and the others would have to do more than salt the Earth to get him back.
The alpha took a moment before deciding on a thought and taking a large bite of the carcass, loosening the skin and muscle and making his way around to the thigh. When he was finished he cheerfully presented the leg to Tony, bloody snout and all.
“Sir, remain calm, and do not turn around. I believe we are being followed.”
“You’ve got no other choice. You’ve been hurt long enough. I’m not going to let it happen again, Tones.”
Still, no matter how dangerous Tony wasn’t going to leave. He liked Bruce, and after that night of meeting the Hulk, he had a general idea of what to expect and perhaps how to handle the giant. So long as he didn’t overstep or was an immediate danger to Bruce the giant wouldn’t make an appearance.
“Can I help you?”
The alpha female, newly named Natasha, ignored her pack leader and waited for Tony’s answer.
Steve caught on. “And you didn’t just want to create weapons.”
He could really use an ice box big enough for him to fit inside. Maybe modify it with runes to keep the temperature at a constant instead of relying on ice that would melt over time.
“Acting oblivious isn’t becoming of you, Tony.”
Thanks for reading!
From his side he felt movement followed by the scandalized sound of Vision apparently sharing the same sentiment as Jarvis.
Steve didn’t need the truth haunting him when he had so much already to worry about. The contract, the journey, their pack’s safety.Tony had no right to throw his own issues at the alpha when he least wanted to hear of them. And so Tony kept quiet. His secret a ticking explosion just waiting to happen and dangerous to hold at such a vulnerable time.
Tony turned his head so fast he both heard and felt it crack. “Are you sure?”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice was laced with so much emotion that it cracked under the pressure. The alpha was no longer in a rage, and if not for the blood painting his snout and paws no one would have ever guessed he went through one and somehow managed to snap out of it on his own.
Tony shut his mouth instantly, panicked. Steve had
“I really am.” The few things good in his life he found were some of the best that a person could have. He was going to cling to them as a limpet and fight anyone who tried to take them away.
Steve stares at the screen in horror as he sees himself stand over the unconscious form of Tony, surrounded by bodies upon bodies, blood and gore. He’s on all fours. His face twisted with madness and dotted with red. His eyes dark and his golden hair covered in red splatter. His suit torn, filled with bullet holes. Filled with an amount that would kill a man and should’ve killed Steve. He releases an inhuman growl at their arrival.
That didn’t make Tony feel any better, but he had to look at the bright side. At least he had still remained. The same couldn’t be said about the betas and omegas that fell into Hammer’s clutches. Not even the omega that ended up pregnant was safe. Tony still didn’t know what had happened to that omega and child. One moment they had been there and the next they had disappeared.
Here I bring you angst, small progress, understanding and Loki being an ass, but he's a wise ass.
What made you decide to stick around and continue reading?
Once on the ground May asked him to close his eyes. The prospect of a present finally settled in and excitement soon took over. Peter closed his eyes, going so far as to use his own hands to stop himself from peeking.
He was just a problem after another for his pack. All of the issues caused by his own hands. By this point what war pack in their right mind would consider taking him along for contracts? Considering he couldn’t handle disappointing others or being a nuisance without getting emotional, he was nothing but a liability to everyone, especially to Steve.
Pepper glared at him while Happy huffed. Rhodey rolled his eyes.
“We’re teaching them we’ll always
centaur.” With a smile, she headed off. “Good luck!”
It’s Tony’s pleading for help, begging for Steve to come save him, that finally makes Steve snap. After screaming himself hoarse for these bastards to stop and leave his omega alone, his mind finally breaks. The despair, the hopelessness, the fear, it all takes him into a full range.
“Fair enough. I'll give you
He prayed Steve wouldn’t eventually demand the same of him, that perhaps he still needed to warm up to Rhodey, needed to get used to the stranger alpha hanging around his pack. But as the sun appeared and brought with it the next morning Tony realized Steve would require more than a day or two to finally feel comfortable having Rhodey nearby.
simple!”
Everyone winced at that except for Bucky, hands not so subtly moving to their crotches. Tony was covering his own even as he said “Please don't. I happen to like his… uh, his -” Crap, maybe he hadn't thought that through. Everyone was now looking at him in surprise and he couldn't stop his cheeks from coloring even if he tried.
“Oh, my God, Steve,” Widow is not seen, but her voice is crystal clear, trembling at the shock of the sight.
Now on the second day, the Quarter Race was on. Much like a regular horse race, the centaurs were running to a finish line. The difference? Centaurs didn’t need riders and they certainly had no need of a marked track. No, instead the town had a pathway that had been created years ago that cut through the forest surrounding their town and ran down the main road of the town itself. It started at the festival, went through the main road, entered the forest, returned back down the same main road and finished where they had started at the festival. To and from.
What could Tony
“Seeing as I am a mere bird I hold no input in the decision. My opinion doesn’t matter. Whatever you decide I will follow.”
“Then you won’t be alone. I promise you that.” A very easy thing to have said, but a hard thing to actually do.
He knew it wasn’t pity. Steve had stated many times he was interested in Tony, wanted to court him… or at least that was what everyone had been implying. Natasha wanted Bruce, so it wasn’t pity for him either. What the beta had said was a lie, but Tony couldn’t help the small voice of doubt in his head… what if Steve and the others
Steve looked down at Tony. “Don’t listen to Clint. He’s saying things.”
Was she an old interest Steve still held feelings for? His alpha’s reaction seemed to support that theory. Tony didn’t know how to feel if that were the case. It wasn’t as if Tony was unfamiliar with his alpha chasing after younger and lovelier flesh, but he had hoped he could keep Steve all to himself.
“Yes,” was all Tony managed to say before Steve claimed his lips again in a fierce and possessive kiss. His hands moved lower, cupping Tony’s ass and sending sparks to go right to his dick and cunt. With the grip Steve lifted him up as he stood to sit back on the bed, causing Tony to sit on his lap with his knees folded on the edge. His slit rested right over the alpha’s bulge, pushing his folds to rub ever so slightly and causing more slick to build and for some of it to leak out. He rubbed against the bulge, imagining the alpha already in him and causing the same pleasure that came from just having his dick stroked.
“If you don’t want to fight it is! Also, there’s a purple liquid in the back. Drink that and you’ll fall into a deep slumber. Nothing will wake you for a good forty eight hours. Very effective and simply incredible! If you find yourself nauseous there’s always my home remedy of -”
“Have at thee!” Thor boomed and right when it looked like he was going to charge against Steve he whirled around and started running at the last minute. Loki managed to latch on to him before Thor got too far away. Soon after everyone except for Tony followed suit.
Bruce didn’t voice his mind but it was clear he was worried. Before Tony could have processed another thought a voice from behind stopped them in their tracks.
“Maybe I can't do this after all.”
“We’ll have them moved to the helicarrier soon and checked in by medical. We can’t risk any complications. I want you three to be nearby but not make contact yet until they’ve been cleared. We need to know more about these wings of theirs and what they’re truly capable of. Clearly there’s more behind it than what we’ve read. Make sure they don’t go in shock or lose control, understand?”
This time Tony couldn’t control his flush coming almost full force. “That’s not what I meant!”
Steve had him bent over his own anvil in the very same shop he had gifted him. His pants were down his knees, legs spread out with Steve in-between them with his tongue shoved in his folds. A roof over their heads, walls on every side and a makeshift window acting as the smoke ventilator were their only cover from curious eyes. The prospect of getting caught by anyone with the misfortune of time did nothing to slow Steve.
“Aye,” Thor nodded, his grin broadening. “Two young future warriors. I have no doubt they will be strong and healthy. Your own magic is making it so. It aided in protecting them through your ordeal and will continue to do so.”
A hat plopped on Peter’s head. A stylish little brown cowboy hat. It made Peter shriek even louder.
“Loki has his reasons to be absent. Do not rush him.”
Thor and Loki didn’t need any modifications from him. Both feline and serpent were very well adjusted. Hank favored his own work greatly so Tony didn’t dare to touch him. For Rhodey, Sam, Bucky, and Peggy he improved their pistols and rifles. Rhodey had taken a liking to the gatling gun he had taken from the first Hydra pack they had fought. One rune in the back of the thing had lifted much of the weight, allowing for Rhodey to easily handle it. Bruce, besides improving his armor, didn’t require much. The Hulk was already a perfect combatant. Nothing much Tony could do for him.
Tony had to be thankful Hammer at least allowed him to have this one thing for himself.
Tony tried swallowing the lump in his throat. He wasn’t worth leaving a pack for and yet that was exactly what Rhodey, Pepper and Happy had done. They traded in their homes for traveling the lands searching for him, all the while Tony had been sleeping comfortably on a warm bed with a roof over his head and cuddling together with his pack. They had given up their comfortable lifestyle for his sake and he had nothing to give back to them for it.
Bruce didn’t answer, only ran a hand down his neck to his shoulders. It was enough for him.
“I’m sure. Another time, perhaps.”
Tony had done it once. He was sure as hell going to try again and escape with Pepper.
“He can try.”
that did so and it was wrong of Tony to think anymore of it. It was pathetic, really, that he kept thinking back to that moment, wanting it desperately and imagining his life if it had happened only to feel extremely guilty afterwards because,
As it turned out, and Tony shouldn’t be surprised, Jan’s outfits were in high demand. Her stunning and well crafted designs alone gave Jan a well-known reputation in Hattan that in turn passed on to the near towns around it. The fact that Jan also had the title of Avenger on her name sealed a lot of the deals. Many fans would go weak at the knees from the very thought of owning something created by one of the Avengers. A good portion of coin came from Jan, coin that she happily shared with the rest of them. Near the same amount of coin also came from Hank, who apparently enjoyed spending a fair amount of his time studying organic matter and herbs. The well-known alchemist that Hank was brewed potions that ranged from fragrance and flavoring to soothing stomach aches and curing illnesses.
He failed to notice everyone giving him and Bruce looks of contentment.
The voice sounded familiar. A familiar he didn’t think he’d hear in a long time to come. A familiar that reminded him of home, of a good home and friends that were family and made him feel protected and secured and… and
Tony went tense for a moment and pulled his head enough to look over Steve’s side to see Jan awake and grinning. To the right of her was Clint with his head resting on the ground and his eyes open. He turned his head just enough to face Tony without disturbing Sam, who was still asleep and using the back of Clint’s neck and his shoulders as a pillow.
Eventually everyone finished and as soon as the last person ate their last bite Steve stood and ordered for them to prepare for their trip. Everyone made their way out of the kitchen and to their goals, leaving Tony and Bruce to stand awkwardly in the common room with Hank and Sam. The beta pair were humming contently, swaying back and forth a few times before deciding they might as well get a head start.
“Which you’re currently in,” there was a smug smile on the alpha’s face, knowing exactly how Clint would react to the information. “On that very bed we’ve rolled around naked as I ate him -”
, had informed. He wasn’t losing his eyesight already, was he?
As a result, while Tony wouldn’t outright complain and silently kept his discomfort to himself, it didn’t mean he would say no to a bath. The exact opposite. One of the few things he found himself being selfish of when he asked Steve if he could order a wash for him.
On one specific day they were downright stubborn about letting him near the doors. Thankfully he had no work on that day, Ben having ordered him not to show up, but after so many days inside the urge to run around and breathe in fresh air was strong, but the omega and two betas were stronger.
“Get your weapons ready,” Clint advised from the top of a tree her perched himself on. “They're about to move and we have five coming our way from the right.”
With a feeling of loss he grabbed the clothing and put them on. The loose shirt with long sleeves covering all the way to his hands and the pants that barely defined his legs weren’t exactly flattering or even respectful enough to spend an important evening with someone but… he really had no other options.
“How were they?” Bruce carefully wrapped his wrist again. “Were they everything you hoped for?”
He moaned and bucked his hips a bit to show how he felt and made Steve groan from it. He involuntarily squeezed from the movement he caused and the alpha whined from the added pressure on his knot.
His guess was proven correct when Rhodey asked how he felt about others getting closer for a talk. The alpha gave a short howl to signal the others to come and Tony held his breath over the scolding he was sure to receive and well deserved.
“You’re starting your heat and we were just in a fight. Don’t tell me you’re not cramping or need some water. I remember how your heats were back then. I can already feel you warmer than usual.”
“And you’re also an idiot,” Natasha commented to the beta.
“True. Right now, though, we’re not looking for adventure. We’re looking for answers and our answers may just be behind this wall. We need to get a move on before we lose more light. Rhodey, you’re up.”
From Tony’s angle, he could see his alpha’s jaw moving. A sure sign he was speaking to both the female shifters, but there was no possible way to make out the words. The brunette had now joined the blonde in frowning. Then, together, they mouthed two words with eyes wide and their mouths were open in surprise.
Eventually, a clearing appeared. A small one to designate the grounds of what appeared to be an old fort. Eroded and covered in green with barred windows and three large wooden doors. It wasn’t grand. In fact, it appeared to be a small military post most likely set up for covert purposes or a fallback. Lifted and abandoned decades ago.
“You’re back early. What, quick night?” No mistaking the jab.
, he concluded. Of course the Avengers would take some right before traveling the lands to complete long contracts. No traveling pack, especially war packs, in their right mind would risk ruts or heats in the middle of their journey, not at their most vulnerable time.
“Sounds great.” Four was certainly pushing it and he was thankful his alpha decided to take a break.
(See the end of the chapter for
, and these omegas were wearing
A couple of days after trying out Jan’s outfit Tony woke up bright and early on an ungodly hour. The plan was to rise and start traveling to Hattan before anyone had the chance to spot him. His goal was the blacksmith and working for them, and his hope was to do it alone and avoid revealing his skill to his packmates, at least for now. Tony wanted to pass disclosing anything to them involving his building hands and magical qualities for as long as he could keep it secret. If he were to announce or if anyone were to see him making a trip to Hattan they would surely join and follow him to the blacksmith. No, he had to go with only Jarvis and Vision as his company.
As Hammer’s second, Tony could see why Stane played a big part in everything. Even with Howard, Stane played a big role in handling the business and the tough decisions they had to choose, but even then Howard always had the final word. To say Stane was largely the main contributor to his mistreatment was crediting the man excessively, but more often than not Tony was wrong when it came to seeing something in front of his face, so perhaps Rhodey had a point?
“Nothing. Just tired and a little hungry,” which had been true, before he saw his mate walk out the door. Now, his hunger had gone and nausea had taken over.
Everyone nodded their heads, including Jan. “If you don’t mind.”
He pulled the blanket down just enough to reveal his eyes and get a good view of everyone and the room. It did nothing to hide the flush for sure.
“I see my name precedes me.”
If he smelled as Jarvis described than the possibility of luring raiders and thieves and shifters with bad characters, in general, was very real and that posed a serious threat. Rhodey knew of this and yet hadn't forced Tony to get moving to return to their pack and to safety. Tony wondered if perhaps the pack was already in the area and were keeping an eye out for enemies while Rhodey calmed him down and gave him his talk. That would explain Rhodey’s relaxed demeanor.
“All the more reason to try.”
The clearing was coming within sight but there were no outlines of the war pack. The Avengers must have been hiding behind the trees still in the way, but as they got closer Tony’s fluttering chest started growing heavy and his heart sank when they came upon the entire clearing. There wasn't a single soul. They had missed the Avengers.
