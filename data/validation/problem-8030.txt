It’s not the smoothest flight, but Tony hasn’t ever been hauling 200+ pounds of American hero before. Steve is calm and—when Tony has a chance to glance at him—enchanted by the city blanketed below them.
Just as well. He dented it during the last mission, shouldering Tony out of path of a very large tree.
Finally, I want to acknowledge that if you decide to read this, you’re putting trust in me. I will do my best to be worthy of it. I hope you find some joy here.
“We’ll have to debrief Fury about his intel. How much yelling is acceptable in a debriefing?”
Steve does that jaw clench that means he’s hiding a smile. “I think they’re waiting for you to say something, too.”
“Steve,” Tony protests. “I—come on, you know I’m a mess. I’m sure to fuck it all up, even with the perfect all-American man millions swoon over.”
“Shut up and take your shirt off.”
“You’re all evicted,” Tony says.
This, Steve knows, is going to be a long week.
Tony squints at the collage he’s made of Steve, the notes he’s thumbtacked up and string connecting pictures or phrases. “Digital blueprinting wasn’t working—do you have a point here, Barton?”
He passes all the tests Bruce can think to try.
“You keep too much locked away,” Tony says, when they’ve curled up in his bed later.
Steve smiles, letting his relief bleed into it. “When do we leave?”
That’s what he should do.
Tony strolls forward. “How about a preview?”
“Thought there might be something on Asgard,” Tony replies. “His ma’s something of a whiz with magic. Witch with magic? Whatever. He said he’ll be back in a few days with whatever Frigga can tell him. Until then”—Tony motions at Steve—“the part of Captain America will continue to be played by Steve Rogers.”
“Remember that whole thing Nat wrote about you being impulsive? Not just dangerous because you’ve got a high-powered wearable tank. You ever think about what would happen on missions if you fucked a teammate and then blew them off the next day?”
“You bring the suit?” Steve asks.
Nat leans her hip against the table and folds her arms. “Short of making out in public, I don’t think anyone will make the jump to ‘they’re dating.’ And you’d probably have to be caught a few times for it to stick—never underestimate the power of heteronormativity.”
“Welcome back, sir,” JARVIS greets. “I have indeed verified the meeting was added to your schedule by unidentified third parties.”
“Well, they told me I could not only save the lives of young Americans who were fighting for justice but also the civilians caught up in the war, who were stuck between two armies trying to kill one another.” Howard stares off into the distance, the same expression Steve gets sometimes. “Introduced me to Erskine and his formula. Seemed like a great idea—a highly capable weapon, but only when necessary. Other times, a defense. And someone who was good down to their marrow.”
Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
“And are you two kids sharing or do I have to tell your father?”
“It’s a long story,” Steve says.
UNID1: Carter. Grant Carter. Sorry to interrupt. I have an appointment. Well, I think I do, anyway… but if you’re busy—
“Literally knocking you off your feet?” Tony says above him, laughter in his eyes. “You’re going to give me an inflated ego.”
“Of course, sir.”
Nat smiles and gives him a curt nod before she heads down to the garage. Once in the elevator, she takes out her phone.
“That village you liberated with the Howling Commandos, the one in Burgundy. You brought back something they’d given you as a thank-you.”
“I‘m a little busy here,” Steve replies in a clipped tone. “Giant robot making portals, remember?”
“Jingles, mostly.” Tony shrugs. “Wordplay.”
GC: I was going to say handsome, but if you prefer—
“You’re killing me, Rogers,” Tony moans.
“You were right,” Steve says once the credits roll. “I enjoyed that.”
“Boots is, uh. Exploring his alligator side. Seems to be a glitch.”
When he remembers how to breathe properly again, Tony is going to talk Fury into an embarrassingly large bonus for Steve.
“You get kind of numb to it when you’re in the spotlight your entire life. Then the outlandish claims start to seem funny.” He smiles, but it’s tight. “Especially when the true things they’ve printed are worse.”
“Why?”
Before the invention and widespread use of the printing press, people hired scribes to make copies of their work. Some scribes were excellent at their trade, others...were not. Bad handwriting and variations in spelling abound and when a manuscript is old enough and/or exposed to too much sun, it fades. In some fonts (like Times New Roman), there’s a notch on the long s similar to a lowercase f. Still, the notch is thin enough that a scribe and/or god of mischief who weren't careful enough might mistake it for a lowercase l.
“Where are you meeting women with shared interests? The historical society? Graduate programs in early 20th century America? Lindy Hop socials?”
Tony turns, relieved, and—and Steve is about six inches shorter. He blinks. Steve’s uniform is loose in his shoulders and arms, pulling oddly at the chest, and loose again in the waist, though not quite as much. Tony opens his mouth to ask again what the hell is going on or to tell Loki to quit staring if he wants to stay conscious and—
“Just! Fish in the ocean today! Maybe tomorrow? Hey! Pillows are
Tony watches Steve leave and folds his arms over the pillow. “JARVIS?”
He expects Steve to look offended and their dynamic on the helicarrier to tumble back into the open. Instead, Steve gives him a half smirk that Tony suspects is humoring him but ceding no ground.
There’s heat in the gaze Steve sweeps up Tony’s body and Tony has a moment to think
Six Feet Under
“Not an option. This one’s what you might call time-sensitive.”
“Hurry it up. I want to get out of here before the war’s over.”
“Didn’t seem like you’d be in Tony’s workshop. Not when he’s playing Black Sabbath that loudly anyway.”
There is a very long silence, then: “
Tony freezes. “Like what?”
[footsteps, door shutting softly]
Steve shrugs. “They're dynamic. Even the sketches have movement.”
Steve huffs a laugh, wincing a little as he does. “Tony, I need you to do something for me.”
[door opens]
“—which means you’re picking a fight to distract me,” Steve continues. “You need to sleep, Tony.”
But Tony can’t look away. There’s the long-running joke about Captain America not knowing how to dance, the whole “right partner” banter with Peggy Carter made famous after countless biographies, films, and TV specials in the years following Steve's disappearance. Most people were smart enough to know that meant foxtrot or lindy hop, that Steve didn’t know how to lead a partner around a room—and, well, Tony thinks most people don’t realize the skill of that or how extra careful Steve would have to be in a body still strange for its size and strength.
“Howard,” Tony replies.
It’s one of the tabloids, Steve notes. He reaches over to take it from Tony and studies the cover and headline.
Steve shuts his mouth. He nods. “All right.”
“JARVIS, please close up the game and shut down anything else that’s on down here.”
“This is a very bad day,” Steve moans. “How long do you think he was standing there?”
A few days after their first lesson, Steve hunts Tony down in his workshop and asks to practice before the next lesson. JARVIS turns on some music at Tony’s request and locks down the workshop at Steve’s.
Steve nods. “Thanks, I’ll be sure to drop by.” He glances around at the tents still waiting to be put up. “You know,” he begins and lets a little mischief into his smile, “I’d be happy to stick around if you need some volunteers. I’m not bad at moving heavy stuff.”
Tony pretends to think about it. “Both. Always both. Or all.”
There’s another silence. All Tony wanted was to escape and to rescue Yinsen, then mitigate his past sins with some justice when he emerged from the desert 1 for 2. Now all of this: he’s a superhero, in conversation with the first superhero who is back from the dead to crack open the box where Tony has stuffed all his childhood trauma and self-loathing. And yeah, okay, so it’s not the most secure box, but you never touch a box you don’t recognize—that’s how shit goes wrong in stories.
“Then answer my invite to do battle, Rogers.”
“No,” Steve says, and they both hear the
“Okay, no fair using your smoldering voice. And smoldering face. Look—fine—it’s a Stark Foundation benefit for this weekend. I’ve got a plus one.”
Steve knows the receptionist and security guards by name, says goodnight to each of them individually. The receptionist, a college-aged man, blushes at the attention. Steve pretends not to notice. He shakes hands with the security guards, making a joke that gets a laugh from the men who were unmoved when Tony walked in.
“So you’ve decided to run away to a small island run by a raccoon obsessed with real estate and no competitors?”
“Yeah. Now lie back, Rogers, and think of America.”
“SHIELD took them for analysis.”
“Thank you.”
After that, Steve spends more time with Tony, usually reading in an old wing-back chair he’d found somewhere in storage.
Steve laughs again, this one sounding closer to genuine. "I know what you mean."
“So,” Tony says. “I hear this is all your fault.”
“Oh come on, Clint,” Nat says, ignoring Tony. “Steve would never agree to an engagement without at least a vibranium ring.”
After he sees the final drawing appear, his phone pings.
“Probably. Thanks, Tony.”
“Tony,” Steve breathes.
Steve doesn’t look angry, just tired. He cups Tony’s cheek, kisses him once, close-lipped and soft.
“Is the security typically this tight?” Tony asks.
“I’m right.”
It helps that he’s right about the crowd. His colleagues, despite their social manners and skills being on the low end when there's not classified information to steal, know how to read a room and lean in. By the time it’s Tony turn, the crowd is noisy. He tosses his robe aside with a flourish and a spin, and the yelling is near deafening when they see his Captain America speedo.
“What?”
Well, perfect time to snoop, Tony decides and heads for the bathroom.
“You know,” Steve says into the silence. “I think I won’t ask.”
It’s just bad luck there are two cops on the next block.
fall along that binary?” Clint asks. “Want to take this one, Cap?”
“Bossy,” Steve murmurs.
“Churchill is his last name.”
“I built floors for everyone. Avengers Tower. All the letters but the A fell off anyway—is that a sign from the universe or what? I mean, aside from the portal to the literal universe opening up right above us. Anyway, you have one. A floor. Lack of foresight on my part because I already have several plans to lure you here every night.”
“Okay,” Steve says, rolling his shoulders. “What are we looking for?”
“You lucky bastard,” Tony tells Steve.
“Just the whole catching a wayward archivist on the run from a horde of evil henchmen. It’s impressive. I know I don’t always eat my three squares but I could have easily kicked you in the face on the way down.”
Steve's hand is warm on his cheek.
. “Feel like a walk, Cap? Need to stretch my legs.”
“Traitor,” Tony mutters.
Agent Carter has been in a memory care facility for some time, and we are unable to identify who H might be. Bucky is no doubt Lieutenant James Buchanan Barnes, Rogers’s childhood friend who was killed in action during a mission shortly before the date of this letter.
“Tony,” Steve sighs.
“Happens,” Tony tells him. “Smells great, whatever you’re making.”
“Romanov finally get tired of your island obsession?”
Tony laughs and spins around in his stool. He scans Steve head to toe. “Feeling better?”
One late summer day just as the light is beginning to turn golden, Tony goes looking for Steve. It’s the kind of afternoon that makes him want to go outside, watch the city fade into evening. Sometimes he takes a spin in the suit, but tonight, he wants to walk around, no destination in mind, with someone who has a sense of humor.
The return to the Tower is awkward, and that, Tony decides firmly, is like saying Bruce has a slight temper or Steve merely dislikes those advertisements that play when you walk by. Thor has begun to tell them about the Valkyries, presumably as a way to reassure Steve that Thor does not think Steve is any less capable of a fighter now.
“I had JARVIS make a databank of all your expressions so I could study them. No, not really, don’t give me that look. I just spent time with you, Steve.” Tony pauses. “You’re careful about what you give away, but for someone who’s trying to hide the same things…well, like recognizes like and all that.”
Implied sexual content in this chapter and going forward.
knew, he’s your best friend forever back and has no idea who I am—which, frankly, icing on the goddamn cake.” Tony frowns and pauses to finish the sandwich. “There’s no dressing that up in some kind of lesson about friendship or responsibility.”
“You’re injured.”
[knock on door.]
“But?”
They all agree, though Tony can tell it’s with a great deal of skepticism. He doesn’t care—as long as he gets to show Steve his day-of choice in front of the crowd… and if Steve reacts in a way that’s just not platonic, oops, oh well. Guess the tabloids will have to acknowledge them as a couple, then.
“Did you go to war because you thought it was your duty or did you go to war because you wanted your death to mean something? Lay down on a wire so the other guy makes it home, instead of dying slowly in a factory. Trade your life, with its dwindling time, for someone who could live longer if the war wasn’t a shadow over the world.”
“That’s... not a bad idea,” Tony says, impressed.
Because it is just a few hours. The device is close to ready. They’re taking a break while Tony runs some calculations through a computer.
Maybe, Steve supposes, that is the entire point of dancing.
Warnings for this chapter: brief discussion of pronouns.
Steve’s mouth thins, but he nods.
“What the hell,” he says.
“Ah, the American hero returns,” Tony greets. “Haven’t seen you much lately, Cap. Some new promising lead you’d like to share with the class?”
Each day, they get closer to rebuilding the accidental time machine, with a few alterations Steve insists on. Must not explode, must actually send Howard back to the point when he left. Tony bites back a comment about how picky Steve is, feeling the heat of it in his throat. He’s made his own rule for these next few days: do not flirt with Steve (more than usual) in front of Howard. Sex and sexuality were never mentioned by name in the Stark household, though Tony’s pretty sure a few of the parables his father shared over the years were sex talks in disguise, not advice on ethics, weapons technology, and technological advancements.
“You’ve read it wrong,” Thor is saying.
“Oh. Right.”
“He’ll be back,” Tony says.
Nat slings an arm around his shoulders and pulls him in. “That’s pretty self-absorbed,” she teases. “Even for Captain America.”
“Hmm,” Steve says, taking a long drink of coffee. “Howard never mentioned it?”
It’s a lovely, sweet kiss—perfectly polite, Steve’s palm supporting Tony’s neck and his other arm firm around Tony’s middle. Curious what a less-polite kiss might taste like, Tony presses up, licks along Steve’s bottom lip. Steve makes a surprised noise. He shifts his weight, and they’re both on their feet much too soon for Tony’s liking.
“Come on, you two, the Accords aren’t the problem,” Nat says loudly, her voice echoing through the tense silence as the two teams of Avengers face off. “Your idiot egos are keeping you apart; you two just need to bone.”
Tony stuffs his hands into his pockets and rocks back on his heels. “Yeah? And your smart mouth and stubborn streak were additional side effects?”
“I can think of places much better than your side for a prick,” Steve replies in that same mild tone.
another time x.
“Or had sex right there on the volleyball court,” Bruce suggests.
“Speaking of scared shitless.” There’s something brittle in Steve’s eyes, half buried under his usual Captain America battle face. “At least you knew where to find me.”
“Hold it,” Tony exclaims. “You’re not going anywhere until you reverse whatever you did!”
“Later,” Steve murmurs. “No blueprints in bed.”
Tony spins around, feeling Carter jerk in surprise. There’s a doorway that wasn’t there before. A woman with red hair stands on the threshold, arms at her sides, head cocked.
“You haven’t slept in 43 hours—”
being synonymous with
“Faith? In me? Must be your nightmare.”
“They’re closing up now. I’ll show you my work another time, if you come by earlier.” Steve leads him out, still smiling.
A week later, Steve logs into his island, feeling the day’s tension unspool from his shoulders as Isabelle greets him with an island update. When Villager Cap walks into his garden, Steve pauses.
“I didn’t think they’d print it,” Steve had said, still stunned and still not an apology.
“And you made yourself Freddie Jones. Not exactly subtle, is that? Trying to tell me something?”
TS: Anyway, enough with the bleak. What brings you to my humidity-controlled cave with no natural light?
“No. I love you. If they can’t see that…” Steve shrugs.
“Never during the day.”
“Anything.”
“Sure, Steve,” Tony says and watches him leave the workshop. “What the fuck,” he breathes once the coast is clear. “JARVIS?”
When spoken, Middle English sounds like a bit like a combination of French and German, and it's close enough to modern English you can understand it. If you've ever read a text in Middle English--like
“Promise?” Tony murmurs and Steve throws a pillow at him.
Steve knows he’s walking the razor-thin edge of survival, the one familiar thing in this century.
Hello all! Thank you so much for the comments & kudos! My apologies for not updating yesterday. It was one of those days where I had a plan and then reality was like, "hahahaha that's
Steve studies Tony’s face. “Okay. Well, the truth is, to Howard, I’m a successful experiment,” he says. “His legacy, and a narrative he could control because I had the decency to die heroically.”
The next day is the same. When he comes home, Tony won't look at him.
They land. Tony waits for the suit to disassemble around him, watching Steve. Steve watches back. He pulls off his gloves. Rolls out his shoulders and stretches his arms. Then his legs and his hips and—damn, Steve is flexible.
The gala seemed like a great idea, but that was before Tony considered just how good his tailor is and just how much of a thirst trap Steve Rogers is when he cleans up. Tony makes it through his usual duties on autopilot and then he’s excusing Steve from a conversation with a perfectly lovely—too lovely—young woman and hustling him into the limo and Steve is pinning him with that knowing look, god damn it, so Tony pushes him back into the seat and licks open Steve’s mouth until he’s panting and clutching at Tony and probably—hopefully—forgot whatever smart-ass comment he was winding up.
Steve is an anchor, Tony remembers. Steve is
“As a friend.”
Steve looks up, then turns his own stool, too. “New idea?”
Steve tucks Tony closer, kisses him just above his left eyebrow.
There’s a faint groan, then, “anyone get the plate of that truck?”
They’re on the next day’s front page, a photograph of Steve answering the question while Tony gazes over at him, chin propped up with one hand, and that private, not-press-ready grin on his face.
“Something like it,” Tony says carefully.
“You have met me, right? And this is doing wonders for my self-esteem.”
Tony returns to the pilot seat.
I was all set to post this last week and then I decided Nat ought to have her turn at being an A+ friend. Hopefully, it's worth the few extra days :)
TS: Huh. Aren’t you a rare bird. JARVIS is an AI I programmed, back when I did the technology thing.
Eventually, Tony excuses himself with the pretense of getting a pitcher of water for them and enlists Pepper’s help.
“Better,” Tony says. “Not worthy of a victory kiss yet.”
TS: Aunt Peggy had two children, a son and a daughter, and three grandchildren. I’ve met all of them. I’ve never met you.
“That’s what I said.”
Steve Rogers looks…well, uncomfortable, but also like he stepped directly out of one of those newsreels. Young, handsome. Not even a hint of frostbite.
--you've likely seen a long s. It's a letter we no longer use, and it looks like this: ſ. Instead, we (typically) use two s's for the same sound: aſignment/assignment, aſaſin/assassin, etc.
“You ass.”
“I bet JARVIS has the recording if you’d care to rev—”
“But I can’t.”
“You’re just ticked because I’m finally taller than you,” Steve snapped.
“You all right?”
GC: Have you had this job a while? Sorry, I’m always so curious about archival jobs. Spent a lot of time in libraries. And with history, too, I guess you could say.
“Well,” he says, because someone has to shut his brain up. “You look good for 86.”
Clint snorts. “And this is when you made your move. When Steve’s dealing with his past crashing back in—specifically, the past partially responsible for him becoming someone people finally notice.”
“Dinner, a movie? Sounds awfully normal.”
They make the front page of every major newspaper, and Tony and Steve take turns bringing coffee, takeout, and pastries to the StarkIndustries PR offices. Pepper hands out truly breathtaking bonuses once things die down and sets up a recurring donation to the Pride street fair’s annual fund.
“With pleasure, Captain Rogers.”
Tony watches Howard’s face go pale, how his eyes dart to Steve and then away, as if it hurts to look at him.
“Hm. Guess we’ll have to test it.”
He runs some tests, enlists JARVIS’s help piecing through what evidence he and Bruce gathered over the two very surreal weeks.
Clint grunts in reply, focused on edging towards what is absolutely not a to-scale cicada.
“The cliffs have to border on the west, all right? Better for recon,” he explains.
“Talk to me Cap,” he says through the comms instead of thinking about how Loki’s read him like a goddamn ancient scroll. “Steve.”
“Someone,” Tony says loudly over all of them, flipping the face plate up, “tell me what the hell is going on.”
There’s something purposefully hidden in Steve’s expression, though he returns the grin. “Well. There’s something else we have in common.”
“I’ve been trying not to think about it.”
“Like you’re somehow winning. If you get me.”
when he crashed.”
“Then may I suggest you relocate to somewhere safe until I am at full capacity?”
Sorry not sorry, he’d said, eyes on Tony’s. JARVIS was going too slow for his tastes. And there he was: the angry kid from Brooklyn finally kicking his way free from the ice.
(“Don’t want to drop you five years into the Cold War,” Tony had said absently with a quirked smile and Howard had glanced past him to where Steve was standing, arms folded, eyes closed in resignation. “Not that…you should remember I said that.”
“Love the energy,” Tony continues. “But would like to catapult my not-yet-dad back in time ASAP.”
“Of course I like you,” Steve replies, mildly. “Don’t have to be a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist to see that.”
“It’s just…something that happens,” Bruce says, making soothing gestures with his hands. “It’s how the game works. Sometimes the neighbors leave—for new adventures.”
“Racing games, shoot-‘em-ups. Occasional side-scroller,” Tony says to Steve’s quirked eyebrow. “Do you know what any of those mean?”
“Ah, that good old-fashioned Depression-era thriftiness.”
Howard’s surprise gives way to calculation. “Never saw myself as much of a family man.”
GC: I'm beginning to see the stubborn side.
Steve’s expression settles into his
, Steve’s adrenaline-drunk grin backlit above him.
Note to self: remove all cars to garage next time.
“I think you scare him,” Steve says quietly.
Steve blinks. “What?”
Steve sighs and rolls his eyes to the ceiling. “Your ass is also lovely, Tony. Happy?”
Carter leads him through residential streets and yards, doubling back on occasion. Sometimes, he stops Tony with a hand on Tony’s chest, and Carter goes very still, listening. Tony can’t ever figure out what he hears—if anything—but he nods as if satisfied every time before they continue. After nearly half an hour of this, Carter leads Tony through an iron gate and up a sprawling garden path to a small bungalow. Inside, it’s cool and Tony winces at the sweat chilling on his skin.
Tony is quiet for a few moments, then: “it bothers you, too, doesn’t it, that he has a high-ranking island on accident?”
“About time,” Howard replies. “Think I’ve had enough playing at intrusive in-law.”
“Is this really the time to discuss this?” Rhodes interjects and the resignation in his tone kicks the air from Steve’s lungs.
“Holy shit,” Tony mutters because
The newspapers all cover the tournament, the same picture of Steve and Tony meeting at the net circulating. Tony stands with his fingers hooked in the net, the volleyball under his arm. His grin is unmistakably flirtatious. Steve looks serenely back at him, affection in his expression, hands on hips and his body turned fully towards Tony.
“Tony,” Steve moans, pulling Tony back to this bed, this tangle of sheets, Steve a pulsar star under his hands. “God, I’ve loved you for so long—if I’d only told you everything—”
TS: What?
Bucky grinned. “There’s the Steve I know.”
Tony shrugs. “Taking a break.”
“A 'problem,'” Tony huffs. “You know you’re out of my league, right?”
A noise low and full of want curls in the back of Steve’s throat.
“Don’t get too far ahead of me. I don’t want to be walking along the street minding my own business and then be walloped by your cheekbones.” Tony looks accusingly at Steve’s amused smile. “I mean it, Rogers. We already had our meet-cute.”
“Let’s move it, old man,” Tony says. “Lots to do today. Wax poetic about the greatest generation on your own time.”
Their next mission is a week later. Clint is in a bad mood the whole time.
“I don’t know, Tony,” Steve says. “They’re awfully snug.”
“I figured it out. They agreed to let me model for the life drawing class after mine.”
Carter’s smile is soft around the edges this time and Jesus, he looks young. “Something like that.”
, actually.”
TS: [sigh] What?
TS: I said I don’t do it anymore, not that it isn’t useful.
Rhodes points at Sam. “Tony, I think we should listen to overgrown bird man.”
Tony’s mind crows, slinging an arm around Steve’s neck and letting his other go slack at his side. He hopes it looks as good as he thinks it does, two superheroes locking lips in the middle of a half-destroyed Times Square, a giant fuck-you to all the homophobes who think Steve’s one of theirs.
“Why am I not the Terminator in this scenario?” Steve wants to know as he follows Tony out of the room.
“Debatable,” Steve returns. “According to Nat, we’re both shit at it.”
Carter grips his shoulder. “Tony,” he says, a warning.
Steve looks over Tony’s shoulder, his hand on Tony’s back. He’s saying something too quiet for Howard to hear, but Howard can see the relaxed smile on Tony’s face, how his body leans in to Steve almost too slight to notice. And Howard has seen Steve make that same warm, open expression in Peggy’s direction enough times he could probably draw it from memory.
“Right,” Steve sighs.
Probably for the best.
JARVIS, begin recording.
“Making sure I’ve got the colors right,” she replies, capping the bottle. Her nails are matching red and gold.
“Nat asked if she’d be playing to win or playing to encourage donations,” Steve explains.
“Fuck,” Tony says when they break apart. “You did not learn to kiss like that in 1945.”
Steve leaves, resolving to try again in the morning.
Tony wonders how to begin, now that they’re on Topic 4: Your Friend Isn’t Actually Dead instead of where Tony had hoped to start (Topic 1: Everything Is Fine!) He scrambles to come up with something to diffuse Howard’s anger before it settles in for the long haul.
Steve swears he hears Tony’s shriek of rage from three floors away.
“It’s your workshop,” Steve replies as if that’s a good enough reason.
“I have to.”
Tony flashes him a grin. “Darling, you’re a saint for thinking so.”
“First stay in the Tower is free,” Tony replies. “Unless you touched the minibar.”
“You know, he accused me of ‘shacking up’ with Howard during the war.”
Steve is no different from who he was when he leapt onto that plane in ‘45/a year ago. It’s like he’s settled into himself. Still a smartass who doesn’t know when to back down, but there’s less of a need to prove himself. Howard supposes crashing a plane full of nuclear bombs and alien technology and then saving New York from an alien invasion after waking up 70 years later would feel like proof enough. For now, anyway. Still has his guard up around Howard, treating him with curious but careful warmth. It stings, but Howard swallows it. Why wouldn’t he be guarded, when it’s goodbye forever in a few hours?
“Never,” Steve confirms. “I’ve been a little busy.”
“Looks like the heat from the blast melted it. It’s stuck.” Tony prods gently around the wound. “We get any data on their weapons?”
“I did advise you not to hire him.”
Tony tosses his suit jacket over a chair and unpins his cufflinks. “Because, Steve,” Tony informs him in a serious tone, rolling up his sleeves. “You never turn off The Boss when he’s in the middle of a song.”
“You want something, Cap?”
“Decades,” Tony adds. “In fact.”
“Back up,” he hears himself say. “You’re
it reads.
Luckily, Pepper and Hill both agree to the idea because Tony rush-ordered his swimsuit.
and those helicarriers in the Potomac, Steve going down on one of them because he couldn’t compromise on brainwashed, beaten-to-hell James Buchanan Barnes and fuck if that kind of loyalty doesn’t sweep Tony’s feet out from under him.
“Are you asking me if knowing my good sides and aiming them at people was part of the coordinated efforts to fight HYDRA?”
His grip is firm and warm and Tony suddenly recalls a flicker of something else in childhood hero. Something he squashed because he wasn’t ready to look at it just yet. Now, it roars to life again, and Tony feels like he’s in the suit, but the balance has been knocked sideways.
“What is this?” Clint asks, jabbing a thumb at the corkboard.
Tony flips up the face plate. “Well, that’s a shame.”
“I think that’s called friendship, Tony.”
TS: Kinda. More like Rosey from The Jetsons.
Steve nods.
“I would have guessed you were more of a Jess guy.”
“Tell me what’s going on,” he urges. “What kind of trouble are you in?”
“Just Tony, no last name. Like. Uh, Churchill.”
Bucky winked at Steve as he finished the story. Jean taught Steve more than card games--a few years before the war, Jean took Steve and Bucky to an annual drag ball. Neither of them talked about it now, not even how Steve had gotten some liquid courage in him and kissed Bucky in a dark alley until they were both dizzy. It became too risky. Instead, it was a wink or a crooked smirk that kept off the silence, let Steve remember again the dark purple lipstick smudged in the hollow of his throat.
“You’ve been down here for four days. Thought I’d check in and...”
“Seem okay.”
Which is what makes it particularly irksome that perhaps the most complete representation of everything Tony’s trying to shake loose from his past now lives a floor below. Even worse, has an extremely fine ass. And that set-his-teeth-in obstinance that made him an American hero? Turns out, that’s how he does friendship, too.
Tony shrugs. “Probably.”
Tony knows Hill’s deep commitment to punctuation means this is not a question. He opens the attachment to find a file from earlier that year, detailing an intelligence-gathering mission before they’d located the scepter. There’s a new note under Crimes and Charges, the editing history showing it’s from Steve.
A look of surprise crosses Steve’s face before it’s wiped away. “Thanks,” he says.
“He left only a letter,” Thor howls, distraught. He shakes the Switch. “As if I did not build him his home!”
I discovered this is actually in 9 parts not 8 when I went to edit and upload what I thought were the last two chapters. So: surprise! today, there are three! This seems like a decent way to show 2020 the door and brace for 2021.
“Man after my own heart,” Tony laughs, pulling the tablet back. “There’s more of them, you know. All different songs. ‘I Love It,’ a few P!nk songs. Figured you’d rather skip the one to LMFAO’s ‘Sexy and I Know It.’”
In the first few months on tour, Steve woke up in a new hotel room every morning. There was a pocket moment between sleep and fully awake when Steve could wind back to that Brooklyn tenement. Just before his ma rose to scrape together a breakfast. Then the tour manager banged on his door and Steve slammed back into this body given to him, still unfamiliar. Guilt layered thick and gnawing in his chest.
“It’s simple. Small, clear goals. Nice to have something compact in a while.”
Tony snorts.
“They teach you that in art school?”
“Check the perimeter,” Tony repeats but Carter is already gone.
Besides, he needs time to solve his Steve problem. Tony definitely doesn’t want his dear-old-not-yet-dad haunting his workshop while Tony is trying to figure out how to topple dear-old-not-yet-dad’s friend from the 40s into his (Tony’s) bed and keep him (Steve) there a while.
“I don’t know, man, y’all do have some things you should maybe talk out,” Sam offers. “You know I’m a trained crisis mediator—”
The face painting isn’t busy just yet. Tony waltzes in and grins at the workers’ startled faces.
“Ask your superhusband,” Nat replies sweetly.
Steve is quiet a long moment. “You know that’s not true, Tony. That’s not why I was given this… the other body.”
“We can arrange for you to have monitored visits with Rogers and limited access to our data on your arrival if you think you can help us,” Fury is saying to Howard. “Oh, and Rogers? I think it’s best if we keep Mr. Stark under close observation for now. We don’t want him to find himself in a difficult situation.”
“You haven’t even heard my pitch yet,” Steve points out, getting to his feet but not loosening his hold.
“I'm all right, Steve,” he assures. “Seriously.”
TS: Yeah, well, the thing about technology is people like to use it to kill each other.
“Darling, haven’t you heard?” Tony murmurs. “I invented time travel today.”
There’s a beat of silence before Liz laughs, delighted. “I’d be an idiot to turn down that offer.” They hold out a hand. “Liz. I use they and she.”
“That is clear,” Steve replies smoothy. “Doesn’t change the truth.”
“You’re evicted. Go pack. Out.”
Tony turns back around. Howard sees his suspicious look and laughs.
Tony cuts sharply down one of the narrower DC alleys and breaks into a run. He hears a shout and people chasing him, but if he can get into the used and antiquarian bookstore that’s just within his sights, he can sneak out the back. Tony yanks the door open, bells clanging, and shoots past Reed at the counter with a wave. He winds through the bookshelves, deep satisfaction unfurling in him at the sounds of confusion and Reed’s sharp scolding behind him.
They stand in silence. Tony’s skin itches; he needs a flight in the suit. Something challenging. Anything to rip off the mantle of Howard Stark that threatens to wrap around his neck.
“Yep. Why?”
TS: I’ll ask you again. Answer me or I'll have JARVIS call security.
Clint eyes him suspiciously. “The kind that crackle when they explode?”
“My congratulations, friends, on becoming ‘official,’” Thor booms. “That is the correct term, yes?”
“Well,” Clint says, tipping his chair back on two legs. “I’m looking forward to watching heads explode when the world finds out you’re gay. Is it just dudes or—ow, hey! What the hell, Nat!”
“You seem surprised,” Daphne comments with a knowing look.
Steve grins and his hand is warm and callused when Tony takes it. There are a handful of people walking dogs and joggers pass through regularly, but the park is close enough to Stark Tower that most don’t give them a second glance. Tony admits to himself that Steve was right—it’s a beautiful day, and it feels refreshing to leave his workshop for a bit. They pause on a footbridge and look out over the water.
“So, what happens now?” Tony asked, turning to him.
“Nat?”
No response, but with his enhanced hearing, Tony noticed distant rustling.
Before he could answer, Natasha came back, that smug smirk still on her face. “Well, one thing’s for sure, he’s not a human.”
Tony tries to stifle his laughter, and Steve has his moment of realisation. “Wait… did Peggy tell you about that?”
They aren’t enough to say “I love you so much that it scares me.”
“Well, I don’t know how this place works, I only just got here.” Steve takes a sip of his drink, still as confused as ever.
. But I get to choose our meals for the next week.”
He’s shaken out of his thoughts as Tony moves his hand away. He can’t even mourn the loss of contact when Tony pushes him onto the bed. He pushes himself upright, resting on his elbows, just in time to see Tony rid himself of his pants and briefs.
Steve isn’t sure what to say next. “It’s okay” obviously won’t work. Hell, even he would punch himself for saying that. “We’ll get him back” just sounds like an empty promise.
It's almost imperceptible, but being so close, Tony saw the change, the way Steve's eyes shifted ever so slightly into his werewolf ones. He was so mesmerized by this change that he barely noticed Steve hooking his hands under his knees, lifting and spreading them into an obscene v. When he finally did, Steve had already pulled back, moving his hands to grip Tony's thighs. And finally,
“You mean you don’t know?” Steve removed his fingers, an incredulous look on his face. “Well, I can’t really blame you. Our kinds haven’t interacted for a very long time.”
“No,” Steve says softly, thumb moving across Tony’s cheek to wipe away the tears. “You have nothing to be sorry about.”
“But you work in different departments though,” Clint said through a mouthful of chips.
Steve shifted closer to him, and Tony watched as a spotless white wing came into contact with one of his own black ones. He noticed that besides the colour, the feathers were perfectly identical. Both of them were fundamentally the same.
Tony walked over and knocked. “Steve? Are you okay?’
He gasps out Tony’s name, but the other man doesn’t stop. Instead, Tony pulls Steve’s cock out of his pants and starts stroking. God, how Steve has missed this. And at least now, he knows how far Tony wants to take this.
Steve can’t help but smile a little at that. “It’s okay. I’m just glad you didn’t get rid of the phone.”
A flicker of fear passed over Steve's eyes. Werewolves were wary of a vampire's bite too, with too many stories of vampires losing control to their bloodlust and draining their victims dry. But that fear soon passed, and Steve replied with a certain "Okay".
And it didn’t just end there. As he waved, Steve had a slight flush to his face, clearly feeling awkward and self-conscious about having so many people look at him, which made him just as endearing as well. Not only that, but when he saw the golden retriever puppy that he was going to pose with, the smile that appeared on his face made him all the more adorable.
Okoye hesitates for a second, but ultimately replies to the call in Wakandan. She then turns to them. “Follow me.”
Seeing how much it has affected their relationship, Steve feels that they need to talk about it. But he knows that’s a conversation for another time. So for now, he says, “Well, at least you had the phone with you. Bruce couldn’t have called otherwise.”
“I love you,” Steve says it again, and watches as that expression takes over Tony’s face, as Tony clenches around him. Steve knows he’s right.
He thinks that sooner or later, he’s going to have a heart attack. That it will be what finally kills him.
There is a pause, before Tony says, “I’ve missed you too, Steve.”
Clint clinked his glass against Tony’s. “Drink up then.”  Clint was a human. He was also Natasha’s boyfriend. Tony had watched the whole thing unfold. Clint was the first human who was brave enough to talk to her outside of ordering drinks. She was surprised that she couldn’t persuade him with her words. At first, they thought he was some sort of wizard who was powerful enough to defend himself against her persuasion. Turns out, he was deaf. He couldn’t hear her voice, but he could read lips. It took a while for Natasha to come to terms with this inability to use her powers, but maybe that’s why she liked him all that more. Clint wasn’t as creeped out by all the supernaturals as most humans were, and in fact, he asked questions, genuinely curious. Tony never liked humans, but he did like Clint.
Steve hesitates, to which the doctor rests a hand on his shoulder, comforting him. “Don’t worry, you’ll see me around.”
“The others?” Steve asks, looking around.
Steve waits, giving Tony the time and space to find the words he needs. It’s been a long day for both of them, he doesn’t blame him for the inability to find the right things to say.
Tony’s eyes are wide open, surprised at Steve’s sudden outburst of words and emotion. Still, a smile soon appears on his face. “Aww, you’re making me blush. And really, you don’t have to thank me that much, I just did what I had to do. I’m sure you would have done the same- Whoa!”
"I'm a vampire, not a goddamn doll. You're not going to break me." Using the hand in Steve’s hair, Tony pulled him closer until they were staring eye-to-eye. “Fuck me like you mean it.”
Not that he minded; Tony really did like the drawings. They were well done and incredibly detailed, with the subjects ranging from the city skyline to a stray cat and its kittens. If he was being honest, it did feel a little stalker-y, and as a detective, he should have tracked down who this person was, but every time he tried, one of the others would just stop him, which only made him all the more suspicious.
Natasha nods, but it’s obvious that her attention is somewhere else.
Once again, Tony was amazed at and grateful for how nice Steve was, the angel’s good nature never fading. If it was anybody else, Tony was pretty sure that they wouldn’t have asked and would have just done it anyway. And if it was anybody else, Tony would have said no, because he hated the clean-up afterwards. But this wasn’t anybody else.
Steve gets back onto the bed, holding himself over Tony once again. He pulls Tony’s hand away, laces their fingers together. Steve kisses him on the lips, on the jaw, along his neck, slowly making his way down Tony’s body. It may have been years, but Steve remembers Tony’s body. All his sensitive places, places that leave the man a whimpering mess.
A few minutes later, when Tony finally recovered enough to walk back out, he spotted Steve back at his post, painting the faces of the children with a forced smile.
“I know, but I didn’t need one. The old suit still works perfectly fine.” Steve’s smile softens as he says, “Besides, it’s the last thing I have from you.”
It was a while before Steve finally spoke. “Tony…”
It’s a beautiful feeling, and Tony wishes he could freeze this moment, right here, right now, and live in it forever.
“Steve-” Tony’s voice broke into a groan when Steve’s hand reached up into his hair and
Steve knows that he will never stop blaming himself, but he nods anyway. He takes a seat next to Natasha, and the two of them talk and catch up, just like old times.
The angel moved slightly away, and for a second, Tony caught a glimpse of those blue eyes going dark with pure hunger before Steve’s lips were on his, capturing him in a crushing and filthy kiss. Tony felt the raw energy behind it, and kissed back with just as much fervour, desire raging like a wildfire within him.
When they pull apart, Natasha is smirking. “Are you crying?”
Tony was bored.
Right now, Thor was the one being photographed, standing tall and huge in front of one of the fire trucks. On each of his shoulders and in the crook of his arm was a small kitten, with all three and him looking just unbearably adorable.
“It’s fine,” Steve said, his smile becoming more pained by the second. “I was being dumb, and-”
Steve didn’t seem to mind though, only glancing at Tony with an amused smile on his face. Tony’s not sure what that’s for, but then caught his reflection on the glass door of the building and noticed his severe case of helmet hair. He went red, running his hands through his hair, but stopped. If the night was going according to plan, his hair would only end up more messed up anyway.
Tony rolled his eyes, swinging his legs up onto Steve’s lap. The blond visibly stiffened at the sudden contact, but Tony thought nothing of it, assuming it to be just out of surprise.
He talks about Peter, who has really matured a lot. He’s gotten into the university of his choice, and according to him, it was really because he wrote his application essay on his internship at Stark Industries, about how Tony was the best mentor he could have ever had. Even though he’s a lot busier, he still spends his free time with Morgan, who’s become a little sister to him.
“Thought we should get a little privacy,” Tony said, leaning against the edge of his desk. “Come here.”
Tony reached up to cup Steve’s face in his hands. “Talk to me.”
"As you wish." In one fluid motion, Steve pushed himself in all the way to the hilt, facing no resistance with Tony already wet and loose from the first round.
Here's where the E rating kicks in, because who doesn't love some reunion sex?
With a particularly hard thrust, Steve hit right up against Tony's prostate, the growing knot reaching deep inside him, stretching him further than he had ever been stretched. This sensation had Tony arching off the mattress, a choked gasp leaving his mouth.
Those blue eyes now looked at him with a deep hunger and desire. “Do you have…”
“So, you’ve been staring at me.” The man opened his mouth (a very attractive mouth, with what looked like super soft lips, Tony noted) to say something, but Tony cut him off. “I’ve been staring at you too. Seems like a mutual thing, so we should stop beating around the bush, yes?”
He looks much younger when he’s asleep, Tony notices. More peaceful too. He wonders if he looks like that when he’s asleep too.
“Beautiful,” Steve said, barely a whisper, and without warning, pushed three fingers into Tony.
Tony couldn’t help but get a little loud, tone slightly harsh, but only because he wanted Steve to never doubt their relationship ever again. “I’m not stuck with you; you’re stuck with me, and you better not regret that decision, because no way in hell am I ever letting you go.”
Steve squeezed his hand. There was a second, then Steve finally bit down on the back of Tony’s neck.
Tony could feel his brain shut down, conscious of only the moan that left his lips, echoing in the small elevator. Steve pulled back at the sound, his hand coming up to Tony’s chin, tilting his head back until they were staring eye to eye. Tony could only watch breathless as those baby blues darted down to his lips before travelling back up, the lust in them burning right into Tony’s soul. In all his hook-ups, he had always kept to one rule: no kissing. But this,
Tony sat upright at that, now looking down into Steve’s deep blue eyes. “What?”
"I told you they weren’t enough!" Thinking back, Tony realised that they barely ate anything the past few days, using the breaks between rounds to catch up on sleep. Even towards the end, when Steve's rut was winding down, the werewolf would only grab a glass of water and make a quick PB&J sandwich before returning to the bed for more sleep. Although he did enjoy good food, as a vampire, Tony didn’t actually need any to survive, so he hadn’t noticed Steve’s lack of intake until now. “We should get some food. What do you want to eat?”
Feeling too blissed out to move, Tony watched as Steve got off the bed and went to what he assumed to be the bathroom, coming back with a wet cloth. Tony let himself be cleaned up, watching as the blond’s eyebrows furrowed, making sure that every spot was cleaned up well. When he went back to wash up, Tony wondered if he should take the chance to leave, or if Steve would want him to go. Neither happened, and the angel returned to bed.
Tony nearly melted at the puppy dog eyes Steve was giving him, but he wasn’t just going to give up there. “We’re enemies,” he repeated. “We were never supposed to be together. We’re incompatible.”
“The two of us… we’re in dangerous lines of work, and I’m just afraid that… one day, something bad might happen to us,” Tony said, voice shaking. “Remember that big fire that sent all of you to the hospital after?”
“Yes, FRIDAY, I hear you.” If the AI was any more sentient, Tony is sure that she would have sighed in relief as well. He only has one question to ask, but he can barely form the words. “Is anyone… ”
It was as if every single nerve in his body was alight, the beating of his heart and the rushing of his blood loud in his head, noise that drowned out all other senses. Staring up at the ceiling, Tony took deep breaths to calm himself down, his hand on Steve's an anchoring point.
As he enters the bedroom, he hears a knock on the door. He doesn’t know who else would be up at this late hour, so he opens the door, only to find Tony standing on the other side of it.
Bringing the others back is not going to be an easy task and doing so will require a huge sacrifice. If he knows Fate, it will end up being either him or Steve making this sacrifice. If they’re both willing to do whatever it takes, which includes risking their lives, it is almost certain that one of them will die.
“You would be so proud of her, Tony,” Steve says. “She’s smart, funny, kind. Just like you. She’s gonna do amazing things in the future.”
Tony immediately shushed him. “Damn it Barton!” He peeked over his shoulder, making sure the man didn’t overhear. Luckily, his attention was on Natasha, who was taking his order.
“Hi Doc,” Steve says, looking into the eyes of one Dr Erskine. “It’s been a while.”
It was with those words that Tony finally managed to break through to Steve. The wolf stopped, its nose twitching, head tilted to the side as he stared at Tony.
She interrupts him. “You don’t have to explain yourself. I know that he means a lot to you.” She holds his hand in hers. “We had a great lifetime together, but every time you talked about him, I could see that you held so much regret. Now is the time to finally fix that.”
With every thrust, Tony just wanted more and more. He pulled Steve into another kiss, one hand back in his hair, the other gripping his muscular back, legs wrapped loosely around his waist. It was as if he couldn’t get Steve close enough, as if his whole life depended on being in as much contact with the man as possible. His body was starting to ache, but he didn’t care. All he could think about was how Steve’s thick cock was moving in and out of him, filling him up perfectly, hitting spots that he couldn’t reach himself, even with all the toys he had back home.
Steve didn’t look Tony in the eyes. “It’s a long story.”
“How long ago was that?”
“What the hell are you talking about? I’m not leaving until I can make sure you’re okay.”
Tony didn’t answer to that. It was true, but it was so incredibly discouraged that it might as well have been an official rule. He couldn’t even look Steve in the eye, mind running at a hundred miles an hour trying to process everything.
“Work stuff,” Tony said, hoping to change the subject. “You know, like colleagues.”
Numb when he finds out that Quill’s spaceship somehow managed to survive all the destruction on Titan.
There is Tony, right in front of him, looking healthy and energetic. His hair is a lot darker from the last time he saw him, less white and grey. The wrinkles from the years of torment and stress are mostly gone, big brown eyes still shining bright with life, appearing the same way he did when Steve first met him all those years ago in Germany.
, Tony tried to convince himself, but those blue eyes looking right at him made it incredibly difficult to turn away.
With a huff, Steve pulled away, sending Tony an indignant look before lying down, curling his body around Tony’s. Laughing, Tony continued to pet Steve, leaning back against the warm, furry body surrounding him. Enveloped by the warmth, and tired out by his anxiety, Tony started dozing off. His eyelids felt heavier and heavier, and he began to close his eyes, but not before he told Steve, “Don’t worry. I’m not going to leave you.”
Tony lets himself put an arm around Steve, his palm on Steve's back, feeling the very life-like approximation of solid muscles. "Fair enough. You did. So, what's next?"
"If you let him go, I'll convince him and his friends to leave you alone, for good. I'll stay with you for as long as you want me to. If they ever forget their promise, I'll be around to remind them of it," Steve offered. He wasn't sure if he'd picked the right approach, or if this would get him anywhere at all, but he'd keep pushing. He could always change strategies later.
Kamski quits CyberLife before the end of 2028. The reason for this is left vague in the press releases, and he doesn't give a single interview afterwards. Possibly related to whatever circumstances led to this, he never contacts Tony to ask for the thirium reactor plans. Tony certainly doesn't mind getting off the hook thanks to this, but he eventually decides to gives Kamski a call anyway, because he feels like there's unfinished business between them.
Being careful not to wake him, Tony runs a hand through Steve’s hair. It’s a lot softer than he remembers, darker too. He brushes his hand along Steve’s new beard. He never even knew the man could grow a beard, not to mention look so good with one. From this angle, he realizes how long Steve’s eyelashes are.
Maybe the relief and joy he felt when he saw Steve, when he was in Steve’s arms, was just a reprieve.
From behind him, Natasha said, “Too thirsty?” Tony flipped her off, only to hear her laughing.
He talks about Rhodey, who has been a guardian for his family, protecting Morgan in anyway he can. He teaches her about the Iron Man armour, about War Machine, but mainly the different armours that her father had worn over the years.
With his neck curved, exposed and bare, it must have awakened something in Steve, because the next thing Tony knew, Steve had released his strong grip on Tony’s thigh and bent forward, pressing his nose into the hollow of his neck and just
Being the worrywart that he was, Steve asked once again, ‘You’re really sure?”
It wasn't long before Tony felt it, the knot at the base of Steve's cock beginning to grow, catching at the rim of Tony's hole with every move in and out. He was close; both of them were.
Steve’s heart skips a beat at that, a little seed of hope starting to grow. Any animosity they had seems to be gone in this new place, and he begins to see the chance to fix things that Peggy mentioned.
He talks about Pepper, about how she’s started a charity in Tony’s name, aimed at helping those affected by the snap, specialising in counselling for those suffering from trauma. She still feels his death very deeply, but channels that grief into helping others, running the charity like the strong woman she is, all the while being a great mother to Morgan.
He looks at Steve. Hair, now longer than he remembers, in an absolute mess. A split lip, blood clotting into a single line. The Captain America suit, now dull and dirtied, torn in several places, sleeves rolled up to the forearms.
Tony’s in pain, physically and emotionally, but he’s alive, and for now, that is enough for Steve.
As much as Steve talked about how much Tony needed him, Steve needed Tony just as much. Centuries of not being able to talk to the person he cared for, especially after falling for him, had made the angel lonely, almost desperate for contact. Now that Steve finally had Tony in his arms, he wasn’t ready to let go. Tony knew that it was the same for himself too. After receiving so much attention and affection, his was hooked, knowing that it would be impossible to go back to his old life. They needed each other, and that was enough for Tony.
Steve was flushed, partly from the exertion, partly from the embarrassment at this uncontrollable part of his biology. With a reassuring hand, Tony reached up, pushing the hair away from Steve’s face. “You feeling better now?”
“I love you,” he says, whispered into the hollow of Tony’s neck.
Tony doesn’t respond, and for a horrible moment, Steve wonders if he’s said the wrong thing, afraid that he’s just ruined whatever frail connection they’ve just made.
“Had some details on the arson case a few days back that you guys needed. Also, I wanted to make sure you had your coffee for the day,” Steve said, placing a cup of coffee on the desk.
Again, there was no effect. Steve was so close that Tony could feel puffs of his warm breath.
A noise from the bathroom alerted him, and he turned to see that the previously opened door was now closed.
Steve was quiet, however, and Tony felt guilt, fear, and sadness radiating off of him. Immediately, Tony turned around in his arms, coming face-to-face with the other man. “What’s wrong?”
“I can’t give you an exact date, but I started having feelings for you about a hundred years after we first met. Maybe less than that. Nothing really changed until about a century ago, when my rut started getting more intense.” Steve moved to grip Tony’s hip. “I guess the wolf was finally tired of me pretending like I didn’t feel anything.”
Steve looked at him, the fondness back in his eyes again. “I know, but I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, so-”
And if these two lost souls, broken after having stayed strong for so long, can still find it in them to love another who is just as damaged as they are, then what is so undeserving about that?
Grinning, Steve moved back, kissing Tony like there was no tomorrow. Putting his hands on Tony’s waist, he lifted the smaller man up until he was sitting on the desk. This sent a wave of thrill down Tony’s spine, his own hands reaching up to ran through Steve’s hair, legs spreading further apart to pull him in closer.
Walking over, he sits down on the bed opposite the figure. He looks at the two cups and bottle of alcohol, and he smiles.
Like before, they repositioned themselves so that they were lying on their sides, again another awkward endeavour. This time, Tony’s back was pressed against Steve’s huge chest, the latter’s arms wrapped around the former. Enveloped in this warmth, Tony felt safe, secure, and beyond satisfied.
That was what things were like now between the two of them. The first couple of months after that night, things were extremely awkward, with neither of them even being able to say more than three words to each other. After that, with the help of the others, they eventually got over it, going back to being friends. But now, they’ve reached a point in their relationship where they do this playful flirting thing with each other, and as comfortable as Tony was with all of it, a small part of him couldn’t help but wish that the flirting would lead to something more.
“We’ve been together for six hundred years,” Tony said softly. “What’s another six thousand more?”
Does one really need words just to say how much you love?
Just as Tony toed off his shoes and socks, Steve grabbed Tony’s waist and lifted him up. Tony gasped at the sudden change in elevation, because by no means was he a small man. Sure, he was shorter than Steve, but he had been bulking up and gaining muscle mass over the past few decades. Yet, Steve picked him up like it was nothing.
Steve walks out, and with every step, he feels his heart beat speed up, feels his own breath beginning to catch in his throat. He gets closer and closer, until he is right behind the person, and he calls out.
After a few good minutes, he felt Steve trying to pull his head back. He pulled away, letting Steve’s cock slowly fall out of his mouth, letting go with an obscene pop. He slid his way back up against Steve’s body. “Why, too good for you?” he asked, voice already hoarse and throat already hurting.
“I shouldn’t hold you up any longer. The others are waiting.” The doctor points to the door closest to them. “Just go through there.”
“I made you bigger and stronger, sure. But the rest, that’s all you.” Dr Erskine points to him. “And if what the others told me is true, only someone like you would have done all those things.”
Just as he was about to fall asleep, one last thought forced him back wide awake again. A vampire and a werewolf becoming mates should have been impossible, but they made it work, and by the looks of things, they share a very strong bond too. If that was possible, what if... “Wait. I can’t actually get pregnant right?”
This is
When he pulls back, he can’t help but stare at the man below him. Hair a mess, strands sticking to the beads of sweat on his forehead. Lips red and puffed up from the all the kissing, especially with the friction from the beard. Eyes dark with lust and pure need.
, so he could barely control his voice, moaning into the pillow below him. What Steve was doing with his tongue set Tony’s blood on fire, warmer than he had ever been, even in hell itself. As if that wasn’t enough, Steve pushed his tongue past the ring of muscle, fucking him open slow and wet. Tony gasped at the intrusion, gripping hard onto the sheets, trying hard not to come from that sensation alone. He tried rutting backwards to get more friction, to get Steve to go deeper, but Tony was still pinned down by Steve’s large hands.
He turns, and for a second, Tony is floored by how bright the blue eyes directed at him are. He almost doesn’t hear Steve when he says, “I know you’re going to do whatever it takes to get them back. And you’re not going to stop until you do.”
It took almost a full minute, but when Tony finally realised what he was, a chill ran down his spine.
This was true. Perhaps it was because of the distance, the lure of the unknown, that Tony had overheard many of the younger demons in particular, those who were born after the pact, having whispered discussions over wanting to meet an angel. He had heard of those stories before, of angels and demons becoming friends, becoming more than friends. Mainly rumours and gossip, never knowing if any of them were true, or more importantly, if anything happened to them. He would be lying if he never thought about it, about what would happen if he ever met an angel, but he never once thought it would have ended like this.
It was a beautiful moment… until Steve's stomach grumbled loudly. Tony tried to ignore it, he really did, but he ended up breaking the kiss, chuckling at the flush on Steve's cheeks.
“Hi,” Bruce said back just as shyly, blushing.
Carefully, he pushed the door open. The room was dark, but the wreck was clear. A chill ran down his spine immediately, and before he could wonder why, his eyes fell on the source of the destruction.
Standing there, Steve can only smile at how well Peggy truly knows him, at how lucky he is to have her in his life.
A flash of heat travels through his body.
A minute later, and Tony finally does. “He died in my arms, Steve. He could feel it happening. He was scared. He didn’t want to die. He even said he was sorry. And I couldn’t do anything. I just watched him die.”
Not about deep or emotional stuff - they both know it’s not the right place or time for it yet - but they talk. About the team. About what’s happened the last two years. Tony even mentions Peter, and as painful as it, remembering that kid’s enthusiasm and passion drives Tony’s determination to get him back even further.
He knew Steve was close too, the blond’s movements becoming more irregular, the hand on his hip now gripping hard enough that there was sure to be bruises.
“Tony?” His heavy breathing could be heard through the door. “What are you still doing here?”
She’s right. There has been a name that keeps tickling the back of Steve’s mind, a person that Steve’s been constantly thinking about since he got here, even when he was overwhelmed by this new environment. But with Peggy here, it seems wrong to admit it.
“I can’t stop thinking about what I could have done to save him. To save any of the others. But we did all that we could. Thanos was too strong. We were never able to beat him.” He wraps his hand around Tony’s. “All we can do now is to stop blaming ourselves and find a way to win this war.”
Steve took a deep breath, now no longer hesitant. “What if I want to be with you?”
He talks about Happy, who has been there for Pepper and Morgan since the very beginning. He has been spoiling Morgan rotten, which Pepper always scolds him for, but can’t find it in her heart to stop him.
Steve can’t help but smile back.
“I’ve got you.” Steve said in a hushed tone, a sound that somehow relaxed Tony and made him worked up at the same time. He heard a bottle lid click open and a few seconds later, felt Steve’s finger back at his hole, now slick with lube that had Tony shivering. He could do nothing but let out a long moan as Steve pushed in one long finger, all the way up to the second knuckle. He moved his finger in and out slowly, letting Tony get used to the feeling.
“-room,” Tony breathes out, Steve so lost in the feeling that he only catches the end. “There’s lube in the bathroom.”
“You could say that.” Tony turns back to the sunset. “It is beautiful here. I feel calm, relaxed, well-rested. It’s starting to get a little boring, but I think things are gonna get better now that you’re here.”
Before they knew it, the elevator doors opened, and Tony was being pulled down the hallway, towards the apartment at the very end. After struggling with the keys for a few seconds, Steve managed to open the door, dragging Tony in after him. The door locked behind them, and this time, Tony was the one to push Steve against it, their lips colliding together once more. While Steve’s hands were firmly on Tony’s hips, fingers just brushing over his ass, Tony’s were busy undoing the button of Steve’s jeans. As he slid down the zipper, he did the same with his body, sliding down until he was on his knees, face right in front of his crotch.
"It's not selfish. I'm so sorry I couldn't help you more." Tony really had thought he could, and he'd failed. It was his worst regret. When he was gone, the dinosaurs would still be prisoners. He'd done nothing to change their life for the better.
"Tony, if you'd just—" Steve tried.
Rhodey sighed. "You know him. He wouldn't be reasonable about something like this."
Tony tensed at the touch, his head snapping up. "No. Don't. Just leave me alone, Obie. You have nothing to gain. I have nothing left to tell you."
His knees fold. He barely feels the impact when they hit the ground.
Tony glanced up at him, looking incredulous. "Uh, yeah, you missed something, like a few minutes of me completely freaking out. See, you seemed to be really enjoying it, and I'd just hit the good part myself, when you kind of twitched a couple of times and then zoned out completely. I think you stopped breathing, too. I couldn't wake you up. Shit," Tony shook his head. "I thought I'd broken you somehow."
Yet again, Steve found himself wondering if they should've waited longer and planned every detail more carefully, so that they'd be prepared for every conceivable contingency. There were so many points where this operation could go wrong.
"He's locked himself in his workshop. I can't get through to him," Rhodes said urgently, in place of a greeting. "It's not like it's the first time ever he's done that, and maybe I'm overreacting, but—"
The Steve-ape resembled Captain America just like the tiny-Tony resembled Iron Man. It had a costume that had been meticulously crafted to look like Steve’s, down to the cowl, the shield on its back and the star on its front, but because its proportions were so bizarre, Steve found it nightmarish rather than cute. The most off-putting part were the eyes. They were small and beady, glaring at him like they saw right into his soul and judged him unworthy. Unlike the Tony-creature, who seemed docile enough, this miniature Steve clearly had an attitude. It had grabbed the rungs of its cage with its creepy long-fingered hands, rattling them and growling, as Tony carried it across the room and set the cage next to tiny-Tony’s.
Steve pursed his lips, trying to decide what to say.
In the morning, as soon as he's finished emptying the hotel's breakfast buffet, Steve returns to the hospital. He's not sure what, exactly, he's going to say to Tony, if Tony is conscious and well enough to talk, but that doesn't even feel particularly important. More than anything, he just wants to see with his own eyes that Tony's recovering—the memory of finding him lifeless on the hillside still haunts him.
It didn't take too long until Stark started to stir, and soon, he was lucid enough to get on his feet and continue walking. Most other Resistance members treated him without a hint of compassion. Bucky found it hard to do the same. They'd kidnapped him, after all, and bound him and shot at him and knocked him out, which meant he probably had a nasty headache on top of the pain from his wound.
Tony didn't look entirely convinced, his face very serious. "If I'm ever in a position to do so, I'll fix this for you. Put you in whatever frame you want."
“No, he’s not,” Tony agreed. He reached to place a hand behind Steve’s neck and pulled him into a kiss that was slightly more restrained than the ones he remembered.
"We already have that!" Stark insisted.
James crossed his arms, flesh and metal, and averted his gaze, like he couldn't bear to face Tony. "How's that supposed to help?"
“And you tried to kill my best friend!” Steve shouted.
"You know me so well," Tony said sardonically. "You must be over the moon about this, right? You always thought it's such a romantic idea."
There was the sound of departing footsteps, and then an awkward silence, although Pepper and Rhodey were still in the room with Steve.
They needed more people, and they needed someone who was still on good terms with Stane.
It wasn't quite enough to get rid of all that pent-up frustration.
As lovely as it is to hear Steve say such things, it's too good to be true, and still far too easy to explain away. "You can't be sure that's not just your programming talking, telling you to protect me."
"Good catch, Rogers. We can take it from here," Fury told Steve, crouching next to Stane, holding out a pair of handcuffs. Behind him, Steve spotted Clint and Detective Coulson.
He must be pretty close to that hut by now. Surely, he'll be there by the end of the day.
"That good?" Tony asked when he let go. "I can tell it's not skin, definitely, but the texture's very nice."
"So do I. As I said, he's not usually like this. He's got friends he knows he can trust. The only reason I can think of why he'd keep things from us is that he wants to protect us from whatever's going on."
"Have you told Kamski about this yet?" Obie presses on.
Steve is all too aware of how vast the wilderness is. Even if Tony isn't very far, he won't be easy to find. It doesn't help that he was wearing a light-colored suit that will blend in with the terrain. At least the visibility has gotten better, with most of the mist dispersed from the valleys.
Everyone tensed up at the melodious ring of the doorbell echoing through the house from the front door. Visitors were common in the Wilson household, but never during dinner time—interrupting it was plain rude. Sam's father got up, the irritated look on his face possibly the least friendly Steve had ever seen him, and headed for the door.
Although he sounded even more annoyed than he had to begin with, the despair Steve had caught earlier took a new undertone of longing and sadness, so deep that it stole his breath away and brought tears to his eyes.
"I insist, Mr. Stark," Steve said, and put a hand on Tony's back to nudge him in the right direction.
The truth was, of course, that he was only human, and sometimes things were too much. Those times, he withdrew, locked the doors and didn't let anyone see. Sometimes he cried.
This was too real, too detailed, and too visceral to be a dream—but he knew he'd gone to sleep, and he was sure he hadn't woken up.
"I know, I know," Tony says, feeling like he's twenty-one again.
"What about the assassination attempts I'm trying to investigate?" Steve asked. "Do you know anything about them?"
He was done well before his scheduled appointment with Rhodey. He even had enough time to shower and grab a cup of coffee. He still felt like death warmed over, but that was a state of being he was well and thoroughly used to.
A very quick check of the tools that they had on the development server revealed it was still all command-line. How quaint.
"He could've asked me first," Steve spat out.
He wasn't sure whether he really meant that or not.
"Suit yourself. So. How much do you know about what happened when you were detained?" Fury asked.
So much would depend on him choosing his words and even his gestures correctly—and he'd never considered himself particularly good at that sort of thing.
It would've been simple to rush into these places as Captain America, grab some fishy-looking fellow by the shoulders, and shake him until he said something useful, but Steve would rather not go that route if he could avoid it. Instead, he decided to try a subtler approach. He swapped his costume for a regular suit and tie—something he rarely wore—and set out again. The first place on his list was a restaurant, and he hadn't eaten since breakfast. He might as well kill two birds with one stone.
"What do you mean?" Steve was frowning, looking puzzled rather than disappointed. Bucky was sure that would change when he heard the whole story.
"Exactly," Tony said sourly.
"You are very lucky—I did," Tapio says. "They will send a chopper. Less than half hour and it is here."
Steve tried not to think of it. That wasn't difficult, with Tony's cock in his mouth. He put all his focus on that. He couldn't claim it was pleasant; it was like trying to swallow food that should've been allowed to cool down a moment longer. He could tell Tony was loving it, though, which made it more than worth it, and there was that feeling of playing with fire, of excitement and danger at the back of his head. He didn't stop, but held on and sucked as if he could draw that heat right out of Tony.
"You're not like anyone I've ever been with," he said aloud, settling on the bed on his side next to Tony, leaning on one elbow. "I like that." He caressed Tony's smooth chest with the fingers of his free hand. He thought it almost looked as if Tony were glowing, a golden undertone to his skin. He didn't know if that was because of the artifact, or if Tony had always looked like this. It was beautiful, either way.
Tony looked exactly like he had in Stane's video, except that the blood on his face had now dried out; some of it had trailed into his moustache, staining it a rusty brown. A tear in his shirt revealed a glimpse of the power source embedded in his chest, its light dimmer than before, flickering. The expression of terror on his face was unmistakable, and from up close, Steve could hear his stilted breathing. He curled his fingers around Tony's wrist. The skin was cool under his fingers, Tony's pulse a rapid, irregular flutter.
The elevator announced its arrival in the sleazy voice of the local AI, and they stepped into it in a shocked silence.
"Do you want the honest answer?" Steve returned. Somehow, this dream felt wrong in a way deeper than just his dislike of the situation, worse than the previous one.
Tony sits up. He can't do anything about the mosquito bites, but hopefully, the cold and the hunger aren't insurmountable issues.
The way things had gone down between them, something very, very bad must've happened for Tony to contact him. All that he'd heard of Tony during the weeks he'd spent hiding in Wakanda had been from occasional news items and the few reports Natasha had sent from home.
“I’m fine, too,” Steve said stiffly. He was sore all over, but that was barely worth mentioning. “I can’t remember how I got here, though, after we…“ He trailed off, unable to complete the sentence. In spite of the running jokes about Steve and swearing, he had no gripes with strong language, but now, his mouth was refusing to form the words ‘fuck’ or even ‘sex’. He made a vague hand gesture instead.
Tony made an amused hum. "Yeah, that's one word for it."
Stane looked perfectly unfazed, not showing the slightest reaction to the name. "Who? Your little adventure must've left you confused."
Tony pushed Steve's shorts out of the way, wrapped one hand around the base of Steve's cock, and took the head of it lightly in his mouth. Steve gasped, pressing the back of his head against the wall behind him, every trace of guilt burning away from his mind. The heat against the sensitive skin was bordering on being too much; Steve imagined a lot of people wouldn't have enjoyed it. He did, though. He never said no to things being a little rough, especially after how the serum had changed him. Too cautious and too gentle tended to mean that he wouldn't get much out of it.
He could hear that he was being pursued, no doubt by Natalie, maybe by others as well. Casting a glance over his shoulder, he was relieved and surprised to see just her, some thirty meters behind him. He'd made some headway, and he was fairly sure his frame was faster, so he should be able to outrun her.
"How can we know Stark didn't go willingly?" asked the white-haired man from Bent-Root. "I've heard rumors that he's been struggling to fit in. Perhaps he wanted to take his chances with the Northerners, instead."
Steve had handed her over to the NYPD after they'd escaped the flames. The police were going to arrange some kind of witness protection for her, since it was possible the mob might come looking for her again. Considering how last night's confrontation had ended, though, Steve suspected the Kingpin would deem the whole thing more trouble than it was worth, and focus his resources on something else.
Tony shrugged. "It's not like it's particle physics."
A big, heavy hand landed on his shoulder, and as he turned his head to look behind him, he saw that it belonged to an equally massive mobster, half a head taller and nearly twice as wide as him. "Not so fast, buddy," the big man said.
"So, the question is, what do we want to do about it," Tony went on. The color was returning to his cheeks, and the look he gave Steve was openly flirty. "Because I've got some ideas, and I've gotten a certain impression from you, based on, you know," he waved a hand in the air between them, vaguely indicating the bond they shared, "but I don't want to jump to conclusions."
Not telling would, for all intents and purposes, make him an accomplice, but Maya's arguments had been sound. It seemed likely that Tony hadn't been in control of his actions, and that he had only caused the fires in self-defense and under extreme stress. Besides, Steve still had no concrete evidence to tie him to the fires, only eyewitness testimonies, and he'd never heard Tony's side of the events. If Tony was dead, blaming him for the incidents would serve no purpose but to sully his good name, when he wasn't around to defend himself.
"I'll stick to water for now, thanks," Steve said, and handed back the menu.
"Why did Stark want to talk to your boss?" Steve asked.
He reaches Tony and turns him over, and right away, he can tell he's too late.
Tony stood up, a disgruntled look on his face. "Fine! I'll deal with it! You," he barked, turning his eyes towards Steve. "I'm not finished with you, not even close. I'll be back before you know it."
"Yes. Yes, that's good," Steve told him. "I like that."
"Nothing at all," Steve confirmed. "He was badly wounded last night, though. I won't lie to you, it looked lethal to me, and I've seen plenty of bullet wounds in my day."
He'd managed to come in frames with a similar setup before, and dry climaxes like that could be really intense, if he did get there. It helped that Tony tended to be extremely enthusiastic.
Glancing back in the direction he came from, Steve spots something that he takes for a bird, at first: there's a small dark shape in the air. After a few seconds, he realizes it's moving strangely, too static to be anything living. Now that he's focused on the object, he notices the thin cord leading from it towards the ground. It's a kite, of all things.
"Would she do that?" Steve asked, horrified.
He found himself thinking of that time, an eternity ago, when he'd still been new to this cell, and he'd also been struggling to stay conscious. He'd fallen asleep and dreamed of Steve.
"No virtual realities today, I promise," Hammer said, and picked up his glass. "Everything is one-hundred-percent real here, and organic, too. Waiters, food, wine. To your good health." He raised the glass towards Tony.
"I wish I could," Tony said, tracing a line along Steve's collarbones with a fingertip. "I wish I could stay here, with you, for the rest of the day. Get some food. Have you for dessert. Pretend the outside world isn't there. I'd really like that. It's just not that simple."
Toweling himself off, he was still trying to decide if he could live with himself after asking Tony to stay because of ulterior motives when Tony solved that issue on his behalf.
"Yeah, no, I don't think we've met," he stammered.
In the end, the closest anyone came to that was the researcher who handed him the small, cooled transport container, gave him a curious look, and reminded him that the construct hadn't been tested on anything more complex than a cell culture. He told her he was well aware of that.
He glanced up at Bucky. "How long since he stopped breathing?"
The pieces slotted into place when he woke up the second time.
Tony's friends took turns meeting him in VR, but none of them came back with his decision on what his next frame would be. That was okay, Steve told himself. There was no rush. He could understand that Tony would be hesitant and unnerved by the whole thing, while being in VR without a frame clearly didn't trouble him too much. They weren't in a hurry anymore; Tony would be fine as he was, indefinitely. With Dr. Cho's cooperation, Rhodey had even been able to bring Jarvis in and set up extra firewalls to make sure Tony was protected from any attempts to wipe him.
"If anything, I'd say he was—I don't know, he almost seemed healthier?" Jan placed her hand pensively on her chin, then hurriedly added, "Not that he usually isn't healthy. I'm not sure how to describe it. I don't know, maybe it was just that you could see he'd spent a lot of time outdoors in the sun."
He comes home feeling better, on the emotional level. Physically, it's a different story. The time spent in the armor takes its toll. He probably needs to work on that part. If he's planning on extended stays in it, he'll need to make more accommodations to the demands of his body. He won't be getting any younger, that's for sure.
On one hand, he wanted to grab Tony in a hug and say that he felt the same way. On the other, he couldn't bring himself to believe it'd ever work out; it was far more likely to lead to disaster.
"Yeah, I know," Tony said somewhat distractedly, and got up from the table. He motioned towards the door, the distant, cool look on his face exactly the kind that gave Steve the creeps. "Class dismissed, everyone. Go home. If anyone needs a cab, just ask Jarvis."
He hadn't taken more than two sips out of his first cup. Even though they were in a cafe, the coffee was worse than what Tony's workshop had to offer. The place was on the 15th floor and it showed. It was cheap, dirty, and entirely self-service, with a wall full of dispensers for drinks and snacks. They were in this particular place only because it was in the same building as the Better You clinic, though almost two hundred floors lower.
"I don't know, seventy-ish?" Steve guessed. He wasn't used to estimating the ages of older frames, since you didn't see them very often.
Happy had closed his screen, and Pepper had dropped the news feeds, her eyes on Steve.
Again, the answer wasn't what he'd first thought. "There were certain suspicions of his involvement in the fire. One of the policemen recognized him as someone who's been mixed up in shady business before. I didn't catch a name. You should go ask them." The fireman finished by nodding towards the police patrol Steve hadn't yet had a chance to talk to.
"Eliminating Obie's current clone is going to be a lot more difficult when we no longer have anyone on the inside," Pepper said. "He knows I helped you escape. I can't go back."
But then, all of a sudden, the smile froze on Steve's lips, everything about him closing up, his expression growing dark, like storm clouds shrouding the sun.
The corridor beyond was empty and perfectly quiet.
"Steve!" Natalie yelled, emerging from the alleyway Steve had just exited. "If you'd just stop and listen for a moment! I'm not here to take you to Tony."
Stane's reluctance to contact SHIELD and admit to them that he'd failed to deal with Tony had been one of their main advantages. Now that he practically had a finger on the trigger, they'd lost that advantage—unless they changed their approach.
"You know how it feels to be guilty for death and suffering. I'm feeling that now. It never felt right, hiding among humans, but I always thought the others wouldn't even want to be rescued, because they wouldn't know what to do with their freedom. I have to help them, Tony. It's what Captain America would do," Steve says, the intensity of his voice and the fierce look on his face just like his namesake's. "I have to be there and stand by their side."
"It could still be relevant." Steve had no particular reason to think it would be, but just the fact that there was another fire while no one seemed to know where Tony had gone made him feel uneasy. It didn't take him long to make up his mind. "I'll go check it out, just in case."
The relief is overwhelming, and Steve has the strongest urge to press a kiss in Tony's hair, which he's obviously not going to do. Instead, he keeps his focus on Tapio. "Thank you. Thank you so much," he says, from the bottom of his heart. It feels entirely inadequate. "You've very likely saved his life."
alone in this, and you can't change that. I've done some things, Steve," he said, his voice openly anguished. "Some very bad things."
To counteract his growing frustration and distract himself from the looming dark cloud of grief, Steve did what he'd always done in these situations, and hit the gym. After an hour of going through everything the multipurpose machines had to offer, he found his new frame starting to flag. A wave of dizziness hit him when he got up, so bad that he ended up leaning on the nearest wall. A clawing emptiness in his gut reminded him that he hadn't actually eaten since he'd been transferred. A beginner's mistake. Any organic frame this size would be burning through calories at a ridiculous rate.
It had definitely been before that fateful night, then. Steve sighed, some of his excitement fading, and picked up the wallet to go through its contents. Like the receptionist had told him, there wasn't a single bill inside it. In fact, it was almost empty, except for a handful of business cards for Anthony E. Stark, with the Stark company logo, Tony's phone number and address.
There was something wet against his shoulder where Tony's face rested, and Steve didn't know whether it was tears or blood. "Steve," Tony repeated. He was trembling all over.
He sighs, frustrated. Having walls and a ceiling to protect him from the rain is nice, but he was hoping for more than that.
He could learn to like this a lot. If only it could last longer than one night.
"This conversation is strictly off the record and won't leave these walls," Fury told him, clearly sensing his uncertainty. "We're not working with SHIELD. You can speak your mind."
"Ultron will have already dispatched more drones," Pepper said urgently.
Once he finally reaches the door, he pushes it open with his shoulder, still holding on to Tony. The room inside is as empty as he left it; no hikers have shown up to shelter from the rain. The pleasantly warm temperature is welcome after the chill outside, even if it can't dispel the cold numbness deep in his gut.
"No. That's still out of the question. And for the record, I haven't changed my stance. This is different," Tony says firmly.
Steve tilted his head backwards, exposing his neck more, and Tony replaced his fingers with his lips, sucking at Steve's throat eagerly. Again, the actual sensation was less intense than it might've in some other frame, but Tony's enthusiasm more than made up for that.
"Stane can't have been awake when the battle took place, and I don't think Ultron would make an independent decision in something like this," Steve said. "He'd try to keep Tony alive until Stane can tell him what to do. Pepper, you know Stane the best. What do you think that'll be?"
Tony gave him a sharp smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Well, you can always choose to go back and stay in storage for another fifteen years. Try your luck with whatever SHIELD chooses to do with you afterwards. I'd say I'm the safer bet here. You do this for me, and you'll be free to go on with your life once the situation's sorted."
He doesn't expect to ever do it again, if they get back to civilization.
There was an ear-splitting bang and the line went dead.
"I'm a mentor, a colleague, and an old friend," Jarvis said, and for the first time, Steve heard some warmth in his voice.
When they pulled apart, Steve sat up straight, one hand still clasping Tony's. "If you feel up to it, I think we should go now. Toro's waiting for us."
"It's cold out here," Tony said, and brought his other hand between them. His eyes closed for a brief moment, a look of intense concentration on his face, and when he opened them again, flames sprung up on his palm, like a tiny campfire. "Let's go inside. I'll warm you up."
He climbed back onto the pier easily. Looking around, he saw two of the six thugs that were still on dry land break off from the group to run towards him. He hurried to pick up his shield and flung it at them, catching it again on the rebound. The first man collided into the second and they stumbled backwards, buying Steve enough time to crouch by the water and offer Maya his hand.
He was so overjoyed at the news, he couldn't even find it in himself to be angry at Tony and his friends for hiding the truth from Captain America.
It would've been nice to be able to convince himself that, like Pepper had suggested, there was some type of mind control afoot here, and Steve had been affected by it as well. That he'd done what he'd done under the influence of some magical mysterious artifact. He knew he hadn't, though. He'd been in full possession of his faculties. The only things that'd influenced him had been Tony's charm and his own loneliness. He'd made all his choices himself.
Steve has eaten half of the soup. He's tempted to finish it, but resists, so that he has some left to offer to Tony, in case he shows up. He doesn't have a watch, but he thinks he must have been waiting for several hours already. He's added more logs to the stove a few times, and his uniform is mostly dry by now.
He was considering turning around and heading back to the others when a noise from deeper within the ruins caught his ear: a low groan that could've been just from the strain on the fallen sheets and beams of metal. Moving cautiously, trying not to step on anything unsteady or scalding hot, he made his way closer.
"Of course, ma'am," Steve said.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Aside from an itchy knee," Tony said, and reached down to rub at his right knee. The leg of his trouser was completely burned away, and some of the smears on his bare skin looked suspiciously like blood, but there was no obvious injury there that Steve could see.
"I can tell that they're creative, for one thing. That's what's got me so unnerved. The first attack was entirely straightforward. They'd managed to implant a bomb in one of my limos," Tony said, walking as he spoke. He stopped to stare at the morning traffic outside of the transparent walls, hands clasped behind his back. "Exploded in mid-air, sent my remains and bits and pieces of car raining down on those poor bastards on the ground. Of course, I don't remember that myself. Totally demolished my backup node. Had to go for an external backup from the previous night."
"It's very much what I want," Tony said. He opened the buttons on Steve's pants, pulled them down to his knees, and crouched in front of him to nuzzle Steve's cock through his shorts.
It was difficult to admit that he might've let himself be misled so badly; it was both embarrassing and infuriating. Steve would've been ashamed of him.
"Standard tracking hardware, embedded in your backup node," she said.
"I'd no idea, either," Tony said, gaping at Steve. He was sure their shocked expressions were synchronized, too, in that moment. "I thought—ever since we met, ever since I started suspecting we must be matched, I always thought you wouldn't want that. I'd thought I wouldn't want that, either, until I met you. Then I realized I'd never wanted anything as badly, but I knew I shouldn't, so I tried to fight it."
Steve messaged him.
"What country?" Steve has to check, because he doesn't have a clue what language that was.
Tony made another desperate sound, his knees bending so his feet came to rest against the surface beneath him, scrabbling against the soft fabric.
"It wouldn't hurt to ask them, at least," Rhodey added.
"If you insist," Tony said, giving Steve's fingers a pat before he returned his hand to his lap. "Okay, so, it was four years after the Andes, when we had already seen our fair share of adventures, and had a proper team working for Marvels. We often hired some locals as well, since there's no substitute for their know-how. That trip, hiking through the Amazon rainforest, we had a guide called Juan, a cheerful fellow who swore he knew the best way to this temple we were looking for. He also brought a couple of his friends along. One of them, Cauac, seemed suspicious from the start. He didn't really talk to anyone, just scowled, and would often disappear for hours on end without warning, never explaining where he'd been afterwards. Not that he spoke any English—or so we thought.
There was nothing sinister about the warm feeling that took over Tony now, seeing that fond look on Steve's face, and hearing him allude to a future together. Even if they were still in the early days of this relationship, and Tony was well aware that things might change, it gave him hope.
Bucky and Seren scowled at each other, looking as if they were more likely to start a fight than work together.
"I'm pretty sure walking will be faster than trying to train horses who've never seen a rider," Steve commented. If it were up to him alone, he'd run the whole distance to wherever they needed to go, but he knew the others wouldn't be able to keep up with him.
As the freezing cold engulfed him, darkness creeping into his vision, he thought that maybe, with him gone, she would meet the person she was meant to be with, and live a long, happy life.
He managed to spit at Tony again, though he no longer had the strength to raise his head from the pillow and aim for Tony's face. The blood flecked Tony's white dress shirt instead. He shook his head and brought the knife to Steve's face.
The problem was, even three years after they'd first met, being in a room with Steve while not in the suit was every bit as intoxicating as it had been to begin with. It was one of the reasons people cited for why matched relationships tended to last longer than non-matched ones: those new relationship feelings of infatuation could persist for years. Possibly also the reason why unrequited crushes on matches could last forever—except that by now, Tony had finally managed to convince himself that whatever was between him and Steve, it couldn't be a regular match like most PINCS had.
“You were unconscious!” Steve reminded him.
"I met Tony Stark," Steve confessed.
Tony was here. Tony was okay. Except that "here" wasn't real, and Tony was currently a collection of code running in some machine. But that was temporary, Steve reminded himself. This was just an interlude; a necessary evil. Things would be better soon.
"Nah. Just thinking out loud," he replies quickly.
"No," Tony shook his head, leaning on the railing behind him as if he might fall over without it. "You tricked me. You—I can't—it was hard to imagine you sending someone after me, but that you'd—you slept with me just to solve your case?"
He runs and leaps over rocks, making his way around one small hill and up a larger one. From the top of it, he has a view directly over the valley with the large lake that he spotted on the previous morning. Even with the rain and the low visibility, there's no mistaking what else is there: the rectangular shape he saw earlier is a little log cabin. He can't see any movement around it or anywhere in the valley. Still, even a small, abandoned hut in the wilderness is much better than what he's had so far.
"That whole thing about saying if it's too much, that still stands, okay?" Tony said.
It occurred to him that he couldn't be sure this had worked until he met Steve again. He'd have to set something up. An experiment. He'd need to find out.
For a moment, Steve's mind struggled to sort out conflicting reactions. It was Tony's voice, and that meant pain, but the face looked wistful, not cruel, and the white hair and the aged features were not from his nightmarish memories.
The neighborhood was middle-class, that neutral halfway point between the seedy warehouse and Tony and Jan's luxurious homes. Even without the fire engines parked in front of the five-story apartment building and the ladders leaning against the wall, it wouldn't have been difficult to see which apartment was burning: thick smoke was rising from several open, or broken, windows.
Steve gets up as well, his movements more calm and controlled than Tony's. He looks disappointed. Deflated. Tony hates that he's caused that.
All of a sudden, his life had a purpose again.
"A beer," the bartender repeated. "And which kind of beer would that be?"
When Tony shifted to slide one hand between their bodies, Steve also slackened his hold enough to give them more room. He didn't get further than that before Tony's fingers closed around his cock, the heat of his touch taking Steve's breath away.
Steve didn't look away, either, but got rid of the tangle of pants and boots at his ankles as he watched Tony undress. People said that confidence was a big part of what made people look attractive, and that rang true where Tony was concerned. He looked great, and he knew it, making full use of it as he slowly peeled off his shirt and jeans, casting sultry glances at Steve. Where Steve's frame resembled a natural body in its mid-thirties, Tony looked perhaps a few years younger than his actual age of twenty-five. Of course, people as rich as him could choose to look whichever age they wanted to, sticking to clones grown to their favored vintage, but Steve thought there was still a difference. That spark of excitement in Tony's eyes wouldn't have been the same if he'd actually been a hundred years old.
"We can't go to the authorities as long as we can't trust them," Rhodey spoke up from where he stood, leaning against what Steve assumed was a dishwasher. "If we want Tony to be able to start undermining Hydra, the best way to do that is indirect, at least until he's been able to gather enough resources and support for something more overt."
"Too much?" Steve asked.
"That doesn't mean it has to be like that now," Steve said. "I'm offering you a chance to explain yourself."
"It's too soon, I'm not sure he can—" Pepper began.
Bucky sat up straight in his chair again, looking frustrated and amused at the same time. "Well, aren't you being all mysterious today. Okay. Later. I'll hold you to that."
Steve had been worried that after the things that had happened in VR with Stane, physical contact with Tony might feel wrong. It didn't. It was the opposite. It felt like the way things should be, the warmth of Tony's body against his a soothing, concrete reminder of better times. He'd missed this, over the days he'd spent alone in this future that was foreign to him. The touch of someone who knew him and might, in some way, understand him.
So far, Bucky had only seen the room around him: stone walls, simple furniture, no windows. It could've been anywhere. He'd never heard of a place called Crabb Castle.
There were two more places on the list Steve had gotten from the policemen. He'd been planning on visiting those tonight as well, but he ended up lingering at the Groggy Cod for longer than he'd intended to, in case Tony should return. Eventually, past eleven, after several drinks and all too many useless conversations, he finally decided to let it go for the day, and headed home.
With the sun low on the horizon, the track finally curved past a mailbox on a crooked post to end in front of a small, ramshackle cabin that couldn't have been more different from Tony's home in NYC. Though the building was decrepit, its location was picturesque: it sat close to the shore of a placid lake, surrounded by beech and aspen trees, with the fresh green of budding leaves dotting their branches.
Thinking about Rhodey just brings Tony's mind right back to Steve. If not for Steve and that whole mess with the Accords, Rhodey wouldn't be in that situation.
The FDNY had already been through the site last night, once they'd gotten the flames under control. They'd found no survivors. Three men had died, but although they'd been burned beyond easy recognition, the remains of their clothing had been enough to confirm that none of them had been Tony.
Steve stops to take in the rugged character of the landscape around him. It's beautiful, in its unspoiled way, a view that has probably stayed unchanged for thousands and thousands of years. His decades in the ice were a blink of the eye compared to this.
Iron Man's hands settled on Steve's shoulders again, and then his lips were pressing softly against the back of Steve's neck, right at his hairline. He felt Iron Man's breathing against his skin, intimate and perfectly human, now that the layer of metal that had always separated them was finally lifted aside.
"You get anything interesting out of it?" Tony asked, not looking any less dubious.
Pepper shook her head. "Tony wouldn't be a part of something like that. Not even if he were up to his neck in trouble. I know him well, and he's a good man, Captain. He'd never harm anyone without very good reason, and I can't imagine anything that could compel him to burn someone alive. No. He can't be behind that. Unless—" She fell silent again, pursing her lips, her expression turning from thoughtful to openly distressed.
"Yes, exactly," Steve says. "And not just where it comes to looks or skills. They modeled my mind after his, and used all the available historical data to train my behavioral patterns."
Oh, no, no, no—that is not okay.
He hadn't given the whole soulmate thing very much thought before all these conversations with Howard. Before he'd become Captain America, he'd thought he'd be lucky if he found anyone who'd even look at him twice. Now that he was suddenly receiving plenty of attention and Howard kept going on about soulmates, he'd actually considered the question, and come to the conclusion that the idea of some predetermined partner felt too much like arranged marriage to his liking. He didn't really want it to be true.
Like many people on the higher floors, her frame had a telecom implant. She'd be able to see and hear the news as it happened. Steve had no such additions to his frame, and currently, for reasons of security, he wasn't carrying any other network-capable technology either, just the earset that was tuned to their own ultra-secure channel. Happy didn't have implants, but did have a watch. He tapped at it, projecting a screen in front of him, the sound turned low.
That couldn't be right. If Bucky had made it against all odds, surely Steve must have survived, too!
"All right," she acknowledged, and passed the word to the ceratopsian in some saurian dialect or the other—Steve still struggled to tell them apart.
"Keep going," Steve added. "Touch me."
"How can you expect me to believe a word you're saying anymore?" Tony snarled. It was only fair of him. Steve had lied and deceived him just as many times as Maya had.
was still occasionally brought nourishment. Unfortunately, that wasn't on a consistent schedule—probably a deliberate trick to make things even less comfortable for the prisoners—so it didn't help with figuring out the passing hours and days. She'd tried to offer some of it to Tony, but the food was raw meat, which he wasn't quite desperate enough to try, and the water in a shallow bowl, which she couldn't get to him across the distance between the cells without spilling most of it.
Two more thugs exited a car with a woman in tow, one of them dragging her by the arm, the other lifting out a ball chained to her ankle. She wasn't struggling, but going by the glum look on her face, her disheveled dark hair and rumpled clothing, she probably had at some point. They brought her to the edge of the water, close to where Steve was hiding, setting the weight by her feet.
"Well, my shoulder doesn't feel quite right." Rhodey rolled his unarmored shoulder to demonstrate and grimaced. "I don't think it's serious either, just bruised, and there are plenty more of those under the armor."
"We'll see about that," Tony said. He shrugged off his suit jacket, unbuttoned his cuffs, and started rolling back his sleeves. "I'm sure you've got training, maybe even experience, but this isn't the first time I'm playing this game, either."
Marching through the disputed ground reminded Steve of his time in the War before he'd ended up on the island. At night when they set up camp, he struggled to shake the need to make it as hard to notice as they could.
Now that he could see Tony’s hand, it didn’t look too bad: only a little swollen at the wrist, as far as he could tell. Much better than Tony’s face, where a trickle of blood from a cut on his forehead had made its way down along the side of his nose. Steve hated seeing that, as much as he knew it wasn't serious. Besides, it had been less than an hour since Tony had crashed in the desert, so the full extent of his bruises would only start to show later.
It was as if a huge weight had fallen off Steve’s shoulders, the relief so profound he felt dizzy with it. “Oh, thank God,” he breathed out, running his hands through his hair.
Steve shrugged off the hand and stood up. "I guess a clone of my original body isn't on the table?"
Steve knew how well-endowed this frame was, but Tony had yet to find out. Steve grinned at him, and let him pull his pants and briefs down to his ankles.
"Okay, sure. Where do I start?" Tony sighed, looking away from Steve, his troubled expression just like that of his younger self, eighty-five years ago in Steve's living room. "I never stopped thinking about you. All those years. Wondering what I should've done differently, and if I could've somehow prevented you from getting killed and set up."
“He won’t be waking up in a while yet,” Bruce said softly.
Then again, why should he make an effort to be civil around Steve?
"How so?" Steve asked, trying to keep his voice neutral.
Steve takes a moment to process that, then asks, "You said you were dying. If you had focused on repairing him instead of saving yourself, what would've happened to you?"
"It's okay, Shellhead. I don't mind," Steve said, offering him a tired smile.
"Yes?" he calls out.
This hadn't exactly been Steve's plan, but he had to admit he was quite proud of himself. He ran his hand over the warm, sticky mess, some of the last droplets landing on his fingers. Tony shuddered, relaxing into the cushions as if he were trying to sink into them.
"I'd be surprised if you didn't. Now, I really need something to eat. Something spicy might be nice, to see how that works out with this frame."
Yinsen stares at it with a confused frown. He's a medical doctor; he won't have any idea of the functions of android biocomponents. "What's that?" he asks.
Did he mean that Tony was—no, surely, Jarvis couldn't be saying what Steve thought he was. Tony wasn't like Steve. Not Tony Stark. Besides, even if he were, that wouldn't change the fact that he was at the center of Steve's investigation.
"It took a long time, though. It's been over ten years. The first few after I escaped, I don't remember very clearly. I was alone on the streets, with a crude suit of armor and Jarvis. They're what kept me alive. I think I was ready to give up, for a while there," Tony went on, softly, his voice wavering.
Tony's breath was coming in shaky gasps, his chest heaving under Steve's caresses as he passed his nipples, this time purposefully not touching them. The look on his face when Steve glanced at him spoke clearly enough that even though he was every bit as tense as before, this was in a good way, his cheeks flushed, his mouth slightly open, his eyes closed.
Now that he's stopped for a moment, with nothing to do but wait, Steve can no longer escape all the emotions he's mostly kept in check since he realized that Tony has a fighting chance to make it out of here. He's beyond concerned—he's downright terrified that what he's done isn't enough, and Tony will die. After the despair and renewed hope he's gone through over the past few hours, the thought that he might still lose Tony is unbearable.
"Consulting," Miss Potts said. "Like his father before him. Most of his time goes to managing his company."
"Getting in might be all that we need," he told the others.
"You've been following the news, right?" Tony checks.
"I think that ship sailed a long time ago. Vanished past the horizon. Probably sank as well," Tony said, his voice harsh. The contradiction between that and what Steve thought Tony felt still remained, the regret lingering in the spaces between his words and in the shaky breath he drew afterwards.
Steve's mouth fell open in shock. He'd been surprised to see Rhodey, but somehow, this struck even deeper.
Pepper and Rhodey had leaped to the side to avoid being crushed by the doors, and Steve caught them glancing at him as if asking for instructions. He wasn't sure if they'd noticed Tony yet.
The second dose didn't feel any different from the first, going in, but maybe ten minutes after it, what had started as a barely noticeable headache, sometime between doses, had grown so painful, it was impossible ignore.
Pepper took a gulp of her coffee, the anxious look still lingering on her face when she answered, "If he's not responsible for them, then there's a good chance he's the target, and I'd bet he's trying to figure out who's after him and why."
He risked a glance at the quarantine room, where Steve was currently pulling off Tony’s tank top. Tony was gazing at him with such open lust that just seeing it made Bruce feel like a dirty voyeur.
"Sure thing," Steve says, with an easy smile.
Tony's starving, so he steers clear of any deep conversations and focuses on wolfing down a mountain of pancakes and drinking gallons of coffee. Steve sits at the table with him and gives him a summary of what he missed while he was away on his mission. He listens to it with half an ear. He knows that if there's something really important he needs to be aware of, Steve, Pepper or JARVIS will remind him of it later. Possibly all three of them.
"I'm ready," Tony said, gave Steve's fingers a squeeze, and let go of his hand.
He only left the room when there was someone else present that he could trust to keep Tony safe. Luckily, most of of the time he wasn't alone: Pepper, Rhodey and Happy spent a lot of time in Tony's room as well.
"Well, you've got your chance now." Tony smiled, and leaned in for a kiss. It was just a quick peck; another enticing touch of heat against Steve's lips. The suddenness of it was enough to leave him slightly dazed.
The door opens, and even in the low light, Steve can easily recognize Tapio's tall figure in the doorway. His eyes skim the room—scattered piles of clothes on the floor and all—until finally settling on where Steve and Tony are huddled in the corner. He stays silent for a while, taking in the sight. "Well, that is unexpected," he finally states, the tone of his voice staying neutral.
This was, somehow, a very important detail, though he couldn't tell why.
"I think that's a great idea," Steve said. "Besides, I think I know a few other people who'd like to help."
matter, because we know he was collaborating with our enemy. He'll stay in the dungeon until he's given us something useful, like he's promised. Now, you should go and take him a proper meal, and then, when he's recovered enough, he can get to work. And James?"
Waiting for the specialists to reach them, he tried to fervently think of something he could do to help. He knew that what was going on in VR and in Tony's brain wouldn't directly translate to physical harm; the reason his frame was failing was that it had been old and exhausted to start with, and all the stress piled up on it, possibly compounded by injuries from the earlier battle, was too much for him to handle.
"Uh-huh. My chroniclers may have embellished a few details, but most of it isn't too far from the truth," Stark explained, sounding entirely honest. "You read it, then?"
"You're so beautiful," Steve told him.
"Four hours, twenty-two minutes," Friday replied.
Whatever he'd thought might be going on between him and Tony, that must've all been in his head. They weren't soulmates.
"Believe me, I'm just as surprised as you are," Tony said, glancing past Steve. The look on his face grew more and more shocked as he took in the surroundings, his complexion going pale beneath the soot. "Where are we? What happened here? This looks like a war zone!"
"I believe we can trust them, Tony." Steve reached over the table to place his hand on top of Tony's. "And I hope you can trust me."
"I'm going to miss you," Steve said, tightening his arms around Tony.
Steve nudged Tony away gently with one hand and raised the other to Tony's cheek. It felt as warm as every other part of Tony he'd touched so far. "You're awfully hot," he said aloud.
Tony glanced at Steve and put an arm around his narrow waist. "No. I won't let that happen, no matter what. If it comes to that, you'll just have to disappear."
"Your wish is my command," Ultron declared sardonically, and one of the drones pointed its cannon-like arm towards the open doors of another elevator.
"Hi, Tony," Steve said, as casually as he could. "I just thought I'd let you know, Fury offered me a job in D.C., and I'm going to take him up on it. So, I'm grateful you asked me to come stay in the Tower, but I'll have to say no."
"You do the digging, and I'll tell you how to get more out of your own tech than you could ever imagine," Tony promises.
"Sure," Tony promised.
The first and oldest, of course, was booze. He didn't think he had a problem, not really, but Jarvis had started nagging at him, citing that the added cardiovascular risks from drinking didn't play well together with the added cardiovascular risks from the arc reactor still lodged in his sternum. He couldn't really argue against that. Then again, he also didn't care very much. If he ended up living a few years less than he otherwise would've, what did it matter?
He travels around several smaller hills, and stops to drink when he comes across a stream in a valley. The water is cold and tastes perfectly clean. It's too bad he doesn't have a bottle to carry some with him, but considering the number of lakes and rivers he saw from above, this is just a slight inconvenience.
Steve had reached for Mjölnir certain it would come to him, and Tony thought,
Also, inconveniently, turns out Steve’s Hydra-fighting, film-poster good looks are exactly what Tony would like to wake up to each morning. Wouldn’t be the first time Tony was hopelessly gone over someone out of his league, but he thinks Crush on National Icon might be his best/worst work yet.
“Yes, but—”
“Maybe,” he says. “But I think I might want to keep them to myself for now.” He shakes off an edge of melancholy shadowing the affection. “What kind of fella doesn’t appreciate flowers, after all.”
“I think his inheritance might have helped,” Steve says.
“You’re not going to ask me who Iceman and Maverick are?” Tony asks, ignoring Clint.
“No, I’m saving those for Rhodey. What? Don’t look at me like that—has to practice using his suit in non-combat situations somehow, right?”
“She would’ve liked you,” Tony adds.
“I thought that was obvious,” he murmurs.
“The walking, the sulking. Feel normal?”
“You can’t,” Steve confirms. “I have to wake up in this century. Help Tony lead the Avengers.”
“She beat my fishing tourney record,” Clint mutters.
Their first meeting had set his teeth on edge. Tony, adrenaline-drunk on showing up the man his father never shut up about, had jabbed at Steve for stating out loud what Tony had been worrying over, too. Tony wanted transparent, simple, straightforward—and here was Steve, complicating things. Making good points. Being distracting.
“You weren’t impressed with Clint’s fishing tourney trophies.”
Hello everyone! My apologies for disappearing for a while. I thought I had a better sense of this fic overall and then once I was working on this chapter and future ones... nope. Bumped into some gender feels, had to poke at those for a while, annnd here we are again.
“Well, if we’re going by popular opinion, then the whole world’s doomed,” Howard says. “Seemed to me, the decent thing to do was look the other way. Well, unless I was invited.”
He doesn’t answer. Tony peels off and circles back to Steve’s last position.
Steve nods. “You know, I knew folks in the 40s who walked their own paths. The decent thing to do was stay on yours if no one was botherin’ you.”
“Might as well,” Tony mutters, picking up his tablet and settling into a long night of reading.
Something roils in Steve’s eyes, irritation and—panic? Fear? That can’t be right. A kind of ferocity Tony doesn’t recognize.
Steve shoots him an amused look. “I assume you’re about to argue with me.”
“Good thing you were there to fall on the grenade.”
“It’s not,” Tony snaps.
Steve chuckles. “Well. Takes one to know one, doesn't it.”
The sight of Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, the Sentinel of Liberty, choking on his coffee and spitting half of it down his front is a memory Tony decides he will treasure forever.
, Tony’s inner monologue shrieks—off the platform and disappears through a door.
“What for?”
Clint perks up at that. “You’ve got a deal, Stark.”
“You know what spell he was using?” Nat asks.
,” Thor says. “He chooses for himself, no one else. It is never chosen for him.”
“Like hell I am.”
“Fuck,” Tony says and flips over, hauling Steve down for a kiss and flinging a leg over his hip. “How did I ever think you were a blushing virgin?”
—” Tony begins.
“Looks like it.”
“Well, this guy”—Tony jerks a thumb at Steve—“is long overdue for learning to dance. Decades. You might say he’s making up for lost time.”
“What is that, German?” he asks.
“Your USO contract from the 1940s?” Tony asks.
“Yes, thank you,” Steve replies. “Volume up.”
“Hmm,” is Steve’s reply. He joins Tony in the kitchen area and pours himself a cup of coffee. “Hope you didn’t go to any trouble.”
GC: No killing, no kidnapping. It's easier for me to disappear. I’m good at that.
“Three thousand!”
Steve lets Tony’s grumbling roll over him while they work, surprised at how comforting it is. Tony grills him on other foods. Steve answers dutifully, thinking it’s just a way to pass the time until Tony turns up with a cooler full of things Steve says he’s never tried.
“Tony—”
“Neither of us are normal, Steve,” Tony says and it’s a miracle he can string that sentence together when Steve’s palm is flat on his hip.
With a quick twist, he’s slipped into the space between Steve’s legs. He tracks several tiny Steve reactions: a quick, quiet intake of breath; his hands jerking forward before Steve clamps them to the underside of his stool; his gaze scanning the length of Tony’s body, lingering where Tony's leg and hip press against him.
“Is this all some intricate plot to trap me here with you?”
“Tony,” he says, as if he’s only prompting Tony to return from some daydream.
If the universe were at all fair, it would have delivered a Howard 30 years older and then Steve could have put on his best Disapproving Captain face and given him decaf coffee “on accident” until Tony figured out how to send him home.
“No,” Steve replies. “That won’t happen because you’re Doc Brown. Not Marty McFly.”
“All right,” Steve sighs. “Let’s get started on cleanup.”
A look of panic flashes across Steve’s face. “I…a little?”
TS: J, confirmation?
Steve barks out a startled laugh. “Were you?”
It matters that Steve kiss him or tell him to fuck off. That Steve takes the next step.
“You don’t have to do this.”
“Jesus, Steve. Just...let me get you out of here and we’ll get you to a doctor when—”
“Twenty bucks,” says the one not too stunned to speak.
Carter nods. “Understood. This way.”
TS: J?
“Hell, that’s not something I can take credit for, either. All I did was manage not to lose it. Steve,” Howard says sternly, seeing Steve open his mouth. “Leave it be. I know who I am.”
“Fair enough.”
The thing is, Tony doesn’t want to leave just yet. He can feel his muscles already beginning to settle into their pleasant post-battle ache. Howard seems decades away, rather than a few floors. Steve looks more relaxed than he has since Howard’s arrival, but there’s something still distant and far away. Before Tony can think too much—always a problem—he reaches. Fingertips press against the back of Steve’s neck, his thumbs brush gently along Steve’s cheeks. Steve’s inhale is sharp and he ducks his head, turning his face into Tony’s good hand, his lips pressing against the heel of Tony’s palm.
“Well, I’m a wild card. Always have been.”
Something changes in the air between them. Steve is sizing Tony up in a way Tony hasn’t seen since that time on the quinjet, Loki in the cargo bay behind them. He feels even less equipped to pass Steve’s test now, whatever it is.
Steve sits. Tony flips down the faceplate and runs a scan over Steve’s arm and shoulder. He places his hands where JARVIS indicates and raises power levels into the armor. He takes a deep breath.
TS: Or lure me to a secondary location and eliminate the problem.
“You’re thinking,” Tony says, the accusation a whisper over Steve’s lips. “That’s my job.”
“Doesn’t affect my mobility.” Tony rolls his arm to prove it. “I’m in the suit, Cap.”
Steve’s shield is enough of a signal for the agents to let them pass, even if they don’t immediately recognize Steve or Tony. Tony runs through the building’s schematic in his head, overlaying it with what he would guess is Howard’s instincts on escape routes.
“Him,” Steve replies. “Still Steve, still him. Just my body that’s done some rearranging.”
It’s almost routine, until Steve takes an energy beam blast across the back.
JARVIS, I need you to—
“I’ll leave you to it,” Steve says, still perfectly normal.
“Are you with me? In this decade?”
“Okay,” Tony repeats. He looks closer at the wound and sucks in a breath.
“Is it?” Steve asks mildly. “Are you finished?”
“Oh hey that’s weird.”
“Rhodes, Pepper, and Happy are good people. Worthy of you.”
Tony frowns and reluctantly gets to his feet. “We’re not done here.”
“You’ve always been a scoundrel in a fancy suit, Howard,” Steve shoots back, amused.
“You have any idea what that is?” Tony asked him, pouring a cup of coffee.
soft when you throw them, Rogers!”
“You love my ass.”
“No,” Steve agrees, trying and failing to hide a smile. “I expect we’re not.”
One bad day when Steve wants to start running and go until he drops from exhaustion, Tony shows up at his door.
“You’re a handful, Stark,” Steve continues, amused.
“Tony?” Carter says, bewildered.
“Comforting,” Tony says, tossing him a new volleyball. “Your serve, Cap. Be gentle.”
He’s followed. You don’t grow up being the heir to a disgustingly wealthy weapons business without learning that feeling of unease and being watched. Tony’s identified at least five so far. He wishes he had JARVIS in his ear, but if there are five already in the open, Tony knows there’s at least that waiting at the end of all possible escape routes. His best chance is to find a choke point, take them out one by one.
“Yep,” Tony says cheerfully. “It’s a pun.”
“Who died,” he says. Then, “are those today’s?”
“Has Banner fallen in with the rest of you island dwellers?”
except he’s not the Howard Stark
And if it means he has to stare at Tony Stark’s ass? Well, Steve thinks, his cross to bear.
“Yes, sir?”
Steve shrugs. “I’ve never been what you’d call a law-abiding citizen.”
“Spit it out, Steve.”
“Wish you’d gotten your chance at a normal life.”
Pepper hands him a few napkins and Steve nods his thanks. He blots at his shirt.
“Yes,” Thor agrees with a grin. “I believe it would be.”
“Captain Rogers, there’s been a lot of press coverage recently of you and Mr. Stark,” the reporter begins. “Previous interviews have focused on your working relationship. How would you describe your personal relationship with Mr. Stark?”
“No one saw how he treated you,” Steve fills in. “So no one saw
Steve nods. “Just after the Dodgers signed him. Did a special show for the team before they sent us to Europe. He couldn’t enlist because of his asthma—Branca, I mean. I…had some idea of what that was like.”
“I thought you were working on some new Stark Tech,” Steve says suspiciously.
“Don’t let him boss you around too much.”
Tony snorts. “For a soldier, you’re not very good at following orders or respecting superiors.”
“Now I know that,” Steve points out reasonably and presses his palms up the back of Tony’s thighs, gently urging him forward.
“Hmm. Why didn’t you say anything?”
Tony nods. He turns back to bandaging Steve’s back, lets his free hand resume it’s slow movements. Steve sighs quietly, the tension in his back uncoiling further. Tony spends more time than is strictly necessary making sure the gauze and tape lay smooth. He pats Steve’s arm.
Then imitate the action of the tiger;
It was the start of a friendship that didn't make much sense, but few things in Steve's life did. He sleeps through the night more often than not these days, the low hum of the Tower a comfort. On a good day, Steve can linger in that pre-War Brooklyn apartment again.
Eventually, he ends up on the roof of the Tower. He woke up in this city, held orders as his true north, and in what feels like yet another bit of pure luck, is the leader of a team again. Unlike his Howling Commandos, the Avengers will fight him if they don’t like an order and none of them hold him as above them. A leader, but not one whose word is law. Steve hadn’t realized what a relief that would be.
“Yeah. Yeah, Steve, I’m with you.” Tony reaches up to rest one hand over Steve’s. “You sure you want to do this?”
Steve nods once, but otherwise doesn’t move.
“Listen, Steve, you and I both know there are issues with thrill-seeking.”
Howard doesn’t fight when Tony takes the gun from him, nor when he hauls the man to his feet.
Steve lets this sink in. It didn’t occur to him that not talking about his relationships could feel like that.
Steve finally looks at Tony, with an
“What are you going to do, Sir Not Appearing in this Film?” Tony asks curiously.
Steve straightens, pulls back. Then, “me neither.”
“Two thousand!” someone shouts.
“Talk to me, Steve,” Tony says. “You’ll make the kids worry.”
Tony, frozen halfway off Steve’s lap, settles back down. “I don’t hear anything.”
He’d always been a good liar before this, but the USO tour was where he learned how to vanish away Steve Rogers, leaving just Captain America behind.
Bruce looks back down and Tony watches Villager Bruce pull out a slingshot and pop a balloon floating overhead. A present drops to the ground.
“Only if you read directly from the slides.”
“So,” Tony says and is surprised at how steady his voice is. “Just kept wearing the same size shirt, huh?”
There’s something funny twisting in Steve’s chest, affection and annoyance all at once.
“You ever going to stop being combative when I say something nice about you?”
Steve smiles back and can feel the uncertainty of his expression. He goes anyway, over to the drafting table in a far corner under a lamp. Tony had set this up for him when Steve started spending more time in the workshop. It gave Steve an easier place to work than the lumpy furniture scattered around like asteroids.
“You could make a killing selling anti-aging cream,” Tony continues because he’s already dug himself a hole. Why not make it the very best, slap Stark Industries branding on it. “You know, if the”—and here he pretends to throw a shield—“doesn’t work out.”
Steve slouches back in his chair and doesn’t look at him.
Tony focuses on calming breaths and reminding himself,
“Sure. You’d have waited three seconds instead of two before making your decision.” Howard grins at Steve, who shakes his head in amusement.
Steve’s answering smile is the rare shy one, and Tony feels a small thrill. Tony brushes some loose paint flakes off Steve’s jaw. Steve glances up and catches Tony’s gaze. Tony is suddenly very aware of his breath, the light sunburn already forming on Steve’s nose, how Steve’s eyes sweep down and back up.
I’ve lost track of it now, but I once read a compelling case for why cisgender people benefit from active reflection on gender identity. Even if the end result is, “yep, this gender identity still feels right,” it’s still that chance to accept what serves you and let go of that which does not. I'd like to see more of that self-reflection in general.
Howard goes. He turns to face them. Tony starts up the machine, bright white whirring into a circle behind Howard.
“Language, Captain,” Tony purrs.
“You do look a bit like him,” Rogers allows, quietly. “Not a lot. I didn’t know your mother, but I know that’s not Howard’s smile.”
“No. Tony, I’m sorry; I think we’ll have to fight our way out.”
TS: What the fuck.
Tony thinks. Steve is right; following the law is light on his list of abilities. The phrase on his shirt is well-known enough that trying to argue this is some kind of permission for people to break the law will make anyone look unhinged. Conservative news outlets have been trying to get Steve as a guest on their shows since he woke up. Steve has said no through Pepper to every one, and they have started to speculate StarkIndustries is persuading Steve—ha—to fall in line with Tony’s political alignments—double ha. This would probably triple the PR department’s workload, but…
“The rest of us?”
“So close,” Nat sighs, looking over at the headline. “And yet, still so stupid.”
“What? No.”
“You ever going to let that go?”
“Not that sort,” Loki replies and produces the scroll again to consult it.
wouldn’t, but that’s because
“Maybe. Did I offend your 1940s sensibilities?”
“I,” Steve tries. “Tony—”
“Pepper asked me to give you this,” Steve says. “I didn’t realize they’d think…well, you know.”
“Swiped it from me on the mission because she didn’t need to be sent in. You know Nat gets bored.”
“Thanks,” Steve replies dryly.
What—”
“Might be hard to leave the other guy behind,” Steve replies wryly. “Serum, Super Soldier, remember?”
TS: Margaret Carter have any aliases? Nicknames?
“Tony!” Steve greets.
, I can make this stupid game better if you just—”
to raid a secret SHIELD lab and then lose control of the shit they built.”
above. You said Thor was looking into this, too?”
He ducks when Steve whips a pillow at him.
“Gentlemen,” Fury interrupts. “Perhaps you should begin your work on getting Mr. Stark
“That’s your sulk face.”
Even when he knows this is it, that this is when death finally takes, Tony can’t regret much. Not seeing Morgan grow up, top of his list. Leaving Pepper and Steve, not far behind. But Tony’s not an idiot and Strange isn’t as clever or coy as he thinks he is. One chance in a million and you know what? Those are Tony’s kind of odds.
. Do more of that.”
“You’ve taught me a lot, Tony.”
“I thought Sam’s idea was ultimate fighting.”
“You get a new uniform, you need a better kit for underneath,” Steve replies. “Nat?”
“These we didn’t have in the 40s.” He pauses. “Well, not this kind.”
Steve’s lips press into a firm line.
“There’s something off about those Lightless Flame freaks,” Tony replies.
But when Tony had opened his eyes, Steve was there. He’d been so still, and Tony could almost see the fury in him, bright like the sun off his shield. When Steve had seen Tony was awake, he’d left the room without a word. He returned 10 minutes later, then sat back down, eyes focused somewhere else.
“It was. But there’s probably a rule prohibiting a super soldier participating. Or there soon would be.” Steve shrugs. “Wouldn’t exactly have been fair.”
Rogers."
“Aside from the part where one is here? Now?” Tony folds his arms, resolutely ignores the little voice telling him he’s pushing too hard, that Steve doesn’t deserve this suspicion. He can’t stop himself, not when—
“Nope,” Tony says, turning back to his task. “Probably paperwork. Less glamorous responsibility of being the fearless leader.”
Tony frowns. “That was one time and hey, you liked the idea of owning a restaurant.”
“It does not.”
“If I may employ a simile, it appears to have been like pulling out stitches.”
“God, you’d better.” Tony pauses. “Okay, wait. Putting aside you know
What was it Coulson said to Loki a lifetime ago? You lack conviction.
“Mm,” Tony agrees. “On the topic: let me help.”
“Hi,” Tony says. “We’re here for the beginner lessons?”
Liz shakes themselves. “Oh. Yes, this is our first day—we’re still setting up.” She pauses. “We open in a few hours, if you’d like to come back.”
“We didn’t—
“What happened to ‘world’s leading authority on waiting too long’?” Nat asks innocently.
“Trouble up ahead,” Steve says from behind him.
Tony snags a stool and pushes open the high window, tumbling through and
“Still a heartbreaker. This all come from Nat’s mystery store?”
“Mom taught me,” he replies. “She used to sneak out to dance halls before the war. And during.”
“Excellent. Romanov, upgrade of your choice next week. Rush order. Oh, and permission to break a few fingers of whoever’s dumb enough to try something with you.”
“So you pulled a few all-nighters.”
GC: I told you.
“So, just so I’m clear. We’re at: Loki accidentally changed Steve’s body to one assigned female at birth; Loki then proceeded to hit on Steve before escaping
“You are distracted; else you’d never have let that hit land.” Thor nods at Steve’s abdomen. “You protect yourself well there. I assume because it draws the eye in the field.”
“It is not my white whale.”
“Yep. Though, technically, Anthony Stark, I suppose, but never quite liked the formality of the full name.”
“Let him in,” Tony says, not looking away from the screens in front of him. He’s just put the final touches on the design and can get started on construction once he gets Steve’s okay.
Or maybe fling himself into the Potomac, but he’s calling that Plan Z.
“Fine,” Tony snaps. “Fine. I’m a fucking mess, Barton, with enough daddy issues I could run the country for a decade if I figured out how to convert them into clean energy, and yeah, maybe a younger version of my father crashing into the workshop and joking around with Steve hasn’t brought out my best behavior.”
“Sure,” Tony says, texting Pepper about making a sizeable donation to the center.
Tony makes a show of heaving a big sigh. “You drive a hard bargain—
. Well. No wonder he wasn't phased by a kick to the face.
“Where does
“I think you read up on the basics before you got here.” Steve’s tone is warm.
It really is a shame Clint hates the song so much since it’s such a popular one on their communal playlists.
“Why do you have this?” Tony asks. “How do you have this? It went missing when…it was
“Now is the time to live your best thirst trap life.”
YOU CAN BE MY WINGMAN ANYTIME: IRON MAN GIVES CAPTAIN AMERICA A LIFT HOME
Tony is aware he’s putting on clothes, that Steve is helping him with a gentle firmness that keeps his body moving forward while his brain spirals off somewhere else. He has enough presence of mind to think it’s a shame he’s distracted and can’t appreciate Steve’s hands on him, how Tony can tell which hand Steve uses to throw the shield just from the calluses on his fingers and palms.
“You, too, J.”
“You want to hold me down?”
Steve recognizes the cautious invitation and the way they're looking at him. “I’d love to,” he says.
"Son of a bitch," Tony breathes. "Steven
“Nice to meet you, Steve. Let’s get you a badge.”
Rogers’s expression has lost its coolness, but the assessment is sharper, more cautious.
“Grant, you can’t take on an army
The Tower is a mess. Structurally, it’ll be fine, but things like a Loki-shaped pit in the middle of the penthouse floor present some interior design challenges.
“No,” Steve says when he sees Tony getting to his feet. “You’re sitting this one out.”
“New-restaurant-to-try-idea or I-want-to-buy-a-restaurant idea?” Steve asks.
Steve flips open the tabloid to read the article.
“Excuse you. I don’t put out on the first date.”
Steve’s eyes narrow and he gives Tony a once over.
An interesting struggle plays out on Steve’s face before he concedes: “It is like art.”
“Every edition that covered the charity auction,” Bruce says. “Seems I missed quite the evening.”
Steve swallows, eyes fixed on the open doorway. “Tony, do you trust me?”
Steve glances up, startled.
Carter’s hands are on Tony’s face, tipping it up. “Can you see? How much did you breathe in?”
“Why don’t you let me take you somewhere nice to make it up to me?” the man continues.
“Business as usual until proven otherwise, Cap.”
“You know, it’s strange,” Steve muses as he looks over the diagrams. “If I’d been—what is it again?”
“It feels like that. If we do it this way.”
“I won't, I won't. Just tell me. Which famous artist does your favorite studies of the human form?”
Steve loops an arm around Tony and pulls him in. He kisses him slowly, thoroughly, until he feels Tony’s body shiver. Steve pulls back, bumps their noses together. “A
“Have you done this before?” Tony asks, because he’s trying to be better about boundaries and communication.
Fury tries to call Tony in three separate times. Steve knows this because after the third time, Fury calls Steve.
Steve tries to keep Howard’s attention on him and away from Tony. Away from the repulsors Tony has tucked in his back pocket. Steve is sure there must be a safety on them because Tony is usually responsible when there's risk to others, but he really can’t help checking there’s nothing wrong every so often. Besides, Steve had bossed Tony into an arm sling after they'd narrowly prevented a disastrous time paradox and if something does go wrong, Steve needs to be ready to help.
Tony notices they’re all looking at him. He rolls his eyes. “Oh, come on, don’t tell me I’m getting a collective Avengers shovel talk.”
Tony thinks, as he works next to Steve,
Steve’s brow furrows, like he’s picking apart the offer in his head. Tony realizes he probably is, that this might feel like another joke Steve lacks the context for.
TS: Bullshit. You show up here with a fake identity, trying to flirt your way into accessing records that need Head Archivist approval to view. I don’t think you get to decide what’s better if I don’t know.
“Maybe. You and me first.” Steve frowns, disappearing into his own head. “There are things you need to know. I should have told you after SHIELD fell, but I wanted to be sure.”
“I love,” Steve says, shoving the sandwich into Tony’s hands. “When you eat
Oh, Tony thinks and concentrates on breathing.
“What, and however many layers of skin with it?”
“What?”
“Find anything?”
TS: Is it?
“And what?”
“Okay?” Tony echoes.
“How d’you think Tony would feel about you comparing him to Loki?”
“Part of the fun.”
Tony lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. When he turns around, Howard is watching him.
Tony snorts. “Please. There are plenty of superior games I’d sneak onto the Switch before I let Tom Nook set up his island.”
Steve claps a hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry about it.”
Howard shakes his head. “Seeing that scrawny kid walk into the lab, boost himself into the casket? Christ, I thought he was a goner. Then again when the idiot convinced me to drop him behind German lines to singlehandedly rescue what was left of the 101st. Now I’m here, 70 years in the future, and find out Steve survived a plane crash and decades frozen. It’s a lot to ask of one man. Of any man.”
“Date. A very, very public date.” Tony smiles broadly, but there’s an edge of nerves to it. “Up to the task, soldier?”
. It’s not stated outright in the Rebirth files, but anyone who looks at them carefully enough would know. Without the serum, I probably wouldn’t have made it past 35. So.” Steve reaches across the counter, touches Tony’s chest where the arc reactor used to be. “A gift.”
“Better do it soon,” Steve advises, his eyes fixed on Howard. “I think he’s about to make a break for it.”
“What?” Steve replies, distracted.
Tony doesn’t always like to look too closely at who he was. Never did, to be honest. The past should drive you forward: fix what you got wrong, claw your way to a better tomorrow for everyone if you could manage it. If you can’t, you’ve at least left behind a few handholds for the next person to try. Futurist Tony Stark: eyes ahead, always.
Tony turns his back, hunching over his work. “Just give me a few hours’ peace, would you? I don’t need Captain America peering over my shoulder when he’s going to be tailing me all week.”
GC: You’re not what I expected, either.
“Jesus Christ,” Tony says over the comm. “Barton, are you mad because real life interrupted your little game?”
TS: Hush, you. No dice, Carter? Yeesh, do kids these days not watch the classics anymore?
“What?” Steve says, bewildered.
Tony pouts until Steve glances over. Winks at him. Tony preens a little under the attention, steadily ignores Howard’s evaluating look.
Tony’s laugh is startled, but genuine.
“Whatever you say, Tony.”
“Uh huh.”
On the screen, Steve’s Villager (Cap) surfaces from a dive underwater, holding a clump of seaweed.
“Going to get Steve alone if possible,” Tony adds. “Just so we’re clear.”
They dance until the music fades out and the risotto is ready to be eaten, everything else about who they are and what will still be there tomorrow fading away for just a song or two.
“You already had your wire play today, Steve,” Tony says, and it comes out sharper than he means to. “Two’s just greedy.”
“Oh. Yeah, there was some extra fabric lying around after the textiles classes ended, and a few of the students made it for me. The old robes are pretty scratchy, and since I’m not letting them pay me…” he shrugs. “It was nice of them.”
“Told you, should’ve made out in public,” Nat calls.
, Steve. Pepper is crafty. Who knows what she’s dragged you into unwittingly.” Tony gasps and points at him. “It’s happening right now! You’re distracting me with your aw-shucks-this-century-and-all-it’s-texting routine!”
“What?”
Tony cuts him off, not interested in hearing Steve’s defense of Fury. Not when he can see Steve’s shoulder has already started to swell. “Is that what I think it is?”
[long silence]
“Enough,” Steve answers, and Tony loses the thread of the conversation, tumbling into Steve and
“Spoken like a true politician.”
There’s plenty of weird shit to deal with after an alien invasion like “How Does One Dispose of Alien Remains Without Poisoning the Water” and “Wow Insurance Companies Are Really Not Equipped for This,” but Tony suspects that “Steve Rogers is Actually Very Funny” probably shouldn’t be as close to the top as it is. They’ve been spending a lot of time together recently. Steve offers to help with cleanup and Tony’s definitely not going to say no to someone who can carry a couch up flights of stairs by himself.
“A date?” Steve asks. “Or work friends?”
BR: The one with the Lightless Flame Foundation. Don’t tell me your personal assistant didn’t put it on your calendar.
Bruce grins sheepishly. “Would you believe me if I said I didn’t think it would be so popular?”
Tony freezes, debating the merits of sex right here—which, to be honest, sounds pretty stellar. But then he thinks of Steve in his bed, the ample space to roll around in. The ample space for athletic sex and really, why pass up that opportunity when the person you’re having sex with is Steve Rogers?
Steve makes his way around the outer edge of the room and into the stage wings, thinking he can cross once Tony’s finished with the most recent bid and hand off the note.
Thor is yelling, swinging his hammer through a number of Lokis that vanish.
Steve closes his book and sets it aside. He folds his arms. “Are we having this conversation?”
Carter’s not even breaking a sweat, Tony realizes.
Steve draws in a long breath and lets it out slowly. “I’ll get my five stars when I get them, Tony.”
He’d had plenty of turns with men before the war and during. But this world is still new and Tony is…surprising. He keeps finding the cracks in the walls Steve put up, slipping through like he’d always been welcome on the other side.
He has just enough time to see the stunned expression on Steve’s face before Tony is on him. Steve’s back thumps into a wall and his hands come up automatically to break Tony’s grip, then waver. This isn’t a fight. Steve knows it.
In the weeks after everyone returns to the tower, things are quiet. There’s a mission or two: an occasional big task that involves the team running through the city after something spitting destructive goo, gas, or, on the rare occasion, a solid. Sometimes, they have to talk to the press, which is always a mission in itself. (There is, Tony notes while watching the Stark Industries PR Team earn their yearly bonuses three times over, a few valid reasons the Avengers Initiative was nearly canceled. He’s just not sure if he should be comforted he’s not the only walking disaster.)
, because she’s always had excellent instincts—and then looks back to Tony when it’s clear she’s cleared out. There’s a flash of uncertainty and worry on his face Tony hasn’t seen since he first showed up at Steve’s sad apartment and dragged him out to haul around rubble.
“We have all night,” Steve assures. “We can—whatever, Tony—”
“What, no one ever tell you an army marches on its stomach?”
“So we’re just tossing aside all caution.”
“Nope,” Tony agrees. “Might be something you need to watch out for, by the way. National hero back from the dead who then saved New York.”
When Steve returns, all traces of Captain America gone, Tony shows him the latest Stark Tech proposal. The table is long enough to pull up two stools and they sit side-by-side, close enough the warmth of Steve’s presence blends with the late autumn sun spilling into the workshop. It’s a good afternoon; working with Steve—when they’re not arguing—brings Tony a sense of calm he can’t replicate alone or even with Bruce. Tony and Bruce can brainstorm and build, caught up in each other’s energy and ideas. Sometimes, it’s at the expense of taking a step back to critically assess their projects (see: Ultron, floating city, paperwork Steve has cleared only 43% of).
“Assigned female at birth.”
“Rich, coming from you,” Steve grumbles, squeezing his hug tighter.
Carter sets Tony on his feet, suddenly serious. “We have to get out of here.”
“Excuse me, sorry, we’re not open just—oh.”
“That’s not a no,” Tony observes.
“Are we going to use actual names in this conversation, or…?”
“Made a lot of inventions, my old man. Preferred creations that did what he said and didn’t ask questions. All things considered”—Tony waves his hands over himself—“failed experiment.”
“You don’t know how to change me back, do you,” Steve calls.
Steve shrugs. “It’s what I was built for.”
Carter takes his time looking up, as if he hasn’t been caught doing something he shouldn’t. “Done snooping around?”
“I’ll say,” Tony replies. “Is this a new thing with you Millennials? Reviving old slang?”
Tony turns. He studies the crack around the doorframe with interest, then Steve when the man manages to clear the doorway on his second attempt. He gives Tony a sheepish smile.
“Don’t get yourself killed,” Howard advises.
“It was an experiment,” Tony snaps defensively. “See what the big deal was. I had JARVIS scan it for brainwashing alien tech because you were all so sucked into it.”
Steve finds himself in his rooms, reaching for something to do before grinding to a halt: going for a run; a few bouts with a punching bag; sketching something; one of the thick books that lay around his room, half-finished. There’s a pit in his stomach, and all of this before him won’t satisfy the hunger to do what he always does: throw himself into or at something, let his brain switch over to tactical, smother the things that cannot be solved with a shield.
GC: Fair enough.
“Language,” he murmurs. “They’re broadcasting this live.”
“Suppose we could look through the old files,” Tony says. “Erskine’s notes aren’t complete, you know, but…might be something.”
Tony laughs. “You got yourself a deal.”
“What’s wrong with red? The suit’s red. Steve’s shield has red.”
printed on it in neat capitals and
“I can’t believe that guy grows up to be my asshole of a father,” Tony mutters as he cleans up.
“I’m a liability,” Steve interrupts sharply. “The fight is too close, and I can’t do anything with this arm the way it is now.”
Tony considers. “Probably not.”
—and the creep crashes into the flower box.
“Wait,” Clint says, turning his head to study the headline. “Is that quoting what I think it’s quoting?”
This first chapter is an author’s note/artist statement because I think it’s important for me to be transparent about what I’m trying to do, what I will never do in this fic, and provide some general warnings. If necessary, I’ll add new content warnings at the start of individual chapters. Everything is organized under headers below. This might make the fic less stressful and/or help clarify any questions or it might make you realize you don't want to read it--that's totally okay, whatever you choose!
“Whatever. My point is: you were supposed to find that and have your own little emotional response in private. Or with Nat or Wilson. You know, however you chose to process it, that’s what I’m getting at, okay, just—mmff,” Tony finishes, his mouth full of patriotic uniform. “Ack. Warn a guy, would you?”
Steve sighs heavily and pushes past Tony into the room. They’re the first ones to arrive. It’s a good-sized room. Wood floors. Two exits.
Steve gives a tight nod. “Meet at the jet in ten minutes. Suit up.”
He starts down the hall.
And there’s a very bright explosion.
Tony’s brain screeches to a halt at the implications in that sentence. He opens and shuts his mouth a few times, struggling for a response. Steve waits patiently, still amused, his hand warm on Tony’s hip.
“Pieces of it.”
Then Steve is gasping with laughter, beautifully alive, and Tony can only clutch Steve’s forearms as they both struggle to stay upright.
“Hey,” Tony waves a hand in front of his face. “Are you hit?”
Tony snorts a laugh. “Yeah, they mentioned you were funny.”
Steve is quiet for a long moment, then: “How about you come talk to me when you’re ready to start acting like the genius you claim to be?”
“Mm, flattery will get you everywhere.”
Thor crouches down next to him.
Steve snorts.
“Sorry, sorry,” Steve gasps between choked off laughter.
“Tony—”
Rogers blinks.
“Smooth bastard,” Tony mutters, his eyes slipping closed as Steve cups his cheek.
Tony hesitates. He steps forward and reaches into the box, pushing aside the new journals to reveal a much older sketchbook, cover flaking away.
Tony rubs his good hand over his face. “Old/new movie.”
“I thought I might find you up here,” Bruce greets.
Steve laughs, short and brittle. “You haven’t done anything like
Tony groans and drops his forehead to the tabletop. Steve’s fingers brush through his hair. It helps a little, he admits grudgingly and stays there while Clint and Nat speculate increasingly absurd headlines and Steve presses out the knots in Tony’s neck and shoulders.
“Howard. Never shut up about Steve.” Tony starts disassembling the corkboard and throwing the pieces away. “What was I supposed to think?”
“Fuck,” Tony says, dropping his hands.
“They just don’t teach kids bargaining like they used to. Well, you’re always welcome back down here.”
“Great. Meet me by the face painting tent then.”
Steve chokes and resolutely looks anywhere but at Fury or Howard. He hooks an arm around Tony’s neck and hauls him close.
“Ah, no,” Tony replies. “You didn’t change your Facebook status over to
“Seems better than explaining what really happened.”
“It’s fine.”
“The truth you mentioned before. About Howard. What is it?”
“That’s that raccoon,” Steve says slowly. “The one obsessed with real estate.”
“Got him in a fake 40s hospital room, too?” Steve cuts in.
I thought a lot about what to do with Steve's pronouns, and I have to thank Wreck and S for talking through what the various choices would mean with me. Because Steve's gender identity doesn't change with the spell, I kept them he/him.
“No. But I’ve seen you nearly take off a HYRDA agent’s arm when he spoiled the ending of
Steve tosses him an amused look. “You could have called, you know,” he replies, distracted as he works on the button and zipper of Tony’s jeans.
“Doorframe just jump right out at you?” Tony asks conversationally.
“Vibranium?” Tony asks. “Really?”
Two SHIELD Agents escort Howard to the door of the workshop, then wait outside. Howard walks in alone. He saunters over and clasps Steve’s shoulder warmly in greeting.
“Honey
“No! No, I would not care to, I have much better ideas for how to use my time, thank you.”
Tony turns and heads back downstairs to Howard and the time machine, a new project’s blueprints unfolding in his head.
“Well, we’ve handled worse.”
, Barton—”
Steve frowns. “What does that have to do with our relationship?”
“You busy?” he asks by way of greeting.
The door opens behind him.
There are chairs and easels ringing a platform in the center of the room. Steve is standing on this platform. Steve is also, Tony can’t help but notice, entirely naked. No artfully draped bolt of fabric. No well-placed bowl of fruit. Not even his shield.
playing it.”
GC: [quietly, wryly] Aunt Peggy.
Throughout the fic, I'll be using language like "assigned female at birth" and "lived experience as a woman."
Rogers has spent the silence studying him, Tony realizes, and came up with Maria Stark. Not Howard. His throat tightens.
Steve stiffens, his jaw tight. A breath hisses through his lips. “Shit, Tony.”
Tony scowls at the door a minute longer, then turns to face Steve. He’s taken the Captain America helmet off and runs a hand through his hair. The cut he favors these days makes him look more settled into the 21st century. Tougher. Tony spares a moment to remember the softness of the Cap who just woke up…irritating as he was most of the time. Steve looks back at Tony, his face open, but Tony knows him too well not to see the tension coiled in his body.
“I think my pun was cleverer than that,” Steve informs him with a quirked eyebrow before stripping off his shirt and the rest of his clothes. “Well?”
“At what date will you two demonstrate romantic affection in public?” Thor asks. “I wish to be present and lend my support to your union.”
“You’re wrong.”
The far door is a bedroom, a bed crispy made with military precision. Tony makes a note of that. Maybe he can rumple Carter up a bit, see what he'll let slip. Platonically rumple up. Just a friendly rumple. Friendly rumpling up?
Nat sits cross-legged several feet into the room, presumably where she slid to a stop. She’s looking up at Thor.
“Yeah,” Steve said, eyes snapping up to meet Tony’s. “You’re a lot to handle but I think I can manage.”)
“You weren’t.”
Carter smiles at him and not for the first time, Tony sees a flicker of something dangerous in Carter. He holds the file out to Tony, who snatches it away.
“There are trophies!”
Tony crumples up the page and whips it at Steve, who deflects it without looking up.
There is a terrible ringing silence and Steve wonders, briefly, if he’s been whacked by his own shield.
“Yes, sir?”
“You gonna give me a more compelling reason to put up with your shit?”
It’s another couple weeks before Tony can drop by Steve’s art class. Clint’s arrows turned out to be explosive, and it took a while for one corner of the workshop to stop smoldering.
“There’s nothing to discuss,” Steve says loudly. “Avengers—”
“Try not to let it weigh on you. It’s a result of the...aforementioned asshole father. Speaking of which.” Tony pauses, runs an evaluating look over Steve.
“What do you mean?” Steve replied, puzzled. “I’m who I’ve always been.”
“Sure.”
“It means your ass looks great, so stop sulking, and let me parade you around on my arm already,” Tony says, exasperated.
“Nuh-uh! Other people have to use it, Steve,” Tony says, backing away and shoving the marker into the hands of someone who just walked in the door. “It’s called sharing. You know about sharing, don’t you, Steve? Did a whole PSA on it as I remember.” Tony glances over at the woman he’s just handed the marker to. “This guy, am I right?”
Drag performers were popular entertainment in speakeasies in the 1920s and 1930s, and drag balls (many in Harlem) were huge events that drew LGBTQIA+ and straight audiences alike. More restrictive laws surrounding LGBTQIA+ folks were passed and went into effect in the 1940s due to WWII and gay men and women being considered psychologically unfit to serve in the military. What's interesting, though, is that the war relaxed social mores and the mass moving around of people meant queer folks who had never known someone else queer before enlistment were now finding other queer folks at the same military bases, forts, and/or camps. Pretty wild, huh? (Allan Bérubé's book
“Holding hands? You don’t mind?”
It’s not the first time Steve’s run from the police, but it’s certainly the first time his escape was never in question.
Emotional honesty, who knew.
“Steve,” Tony starts, so gently that Steve feels something like fear settle in his chest. “You can want things. You can hate things. You’re not—you don’t have to be everything to everyone. Especially at the expense of yourself.”
Eventually, they end up in Time’s Square. Tony tries to muffle his glee over getting to examine all the screens up close while Steve has the boring task of rearranging more large objects below. At the end of a few hours, they stand back to survey the area.
I knew from my old man’s outbursts that meant the friend didn’t come home from the war. I’m not proud of it, but I was a teenager, and one time when Aunt Peggy was in the other room, I popped the back off that frame and glanced at the back of the picture. Steve Rogers, Camp Lehigh, 1943.
“You like that idea,” Tony says, realizing.
Tony studies him. He doesn’t know what it is, but Carter has this pull on him. He’s a mystery Tony can see just the edge of some answers to, answers he wants to pull out into the open.
“Tell me I’m wrong.”
“And you didn’t,” Steve says, gesturing at the armor.
Tony thinks.
and King Henry's speech to his men:
“And other things, too?”
“Rude,” Tony mutters back. “You, very.”
“Dear heart,” Tony says quietly, weary suddenly, “not even you with your fine spangly ass could have knocked some sense into me then.”
Tony blinks. “Nothing in particular, just another prototype for a compact renewable energy source. Pepper.” He swallows. “Pepper and the board have been on me for months to get it finished.”
Tony remembers suddenly, the cracked doorframe at the Tower coming back to him. Steve's always a little clumsy when he's tired, like his muscle memory is still adjusting.
“A horde.”
“HYDRA.”
Steve’s mouth twitches, holding back a smile. “All right, so no heavy things. Then what?”
Bruce sits on the bench, wrapped up in a quilt. Nat presses against his side, chin tucked over Bruce’s shoulder. They’re both looking down at a Switch.
Tony decides and does.
,” he interrupts, seeing Steve open his mouth, “don’t you dare make a pun.”
“Aside from money?”
Rogers’s expression informs him it is not.
“Should you be wearing that?” Tony asks flatly, pulling down his sunglasses to stare at Steve’s shirt.
When Steve turns up, he’s welcomed into the tent and ushered to the other stool. They wave away his money when Steve tries to pay, and Steve shoots a suspicious look at Tony.
Nat had told Tony a lot of things he wasn’t sure he was supposed to know. Steve throwing himself into SHIELD operations with little care if he survived. How Thanos had punched Steve once, and the breathless terror when, for the first time in his life, he’d stayed down. Steve, the fight knocked out of him for weeks after they returned from Knowhere.
Steve’s expression is unreadable. “Why’d you keep them?”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. “Never got to see it like this.”
The hospital had been too quiet when he woke up. Then the ball game.
Steve snorts and chokes off what sounds suspiciously like a laugh. “I was worried you’d be killed.”
“You sure you wouldn’t drop me?”
“I believe there will be leftovers, yes.”
Tony leans his forehead against Steve’s back, shaking with repressed laughter. “Oh my God,” he gasps. “He’s worse than Nat.”
“I can’t believe this,” Tony is still muttering. “You know, if it’d been Romanov, there would have already been a paragraph speculating on when the wedding was—or if it’d already happened.”
“It’s true,” Thor’s voice interrupts. “It is quite important to acquire a trophy from C. J. Barton tells me it brings rank and glory to the island.”
“Hey yourself.”
Rogers’s face has shifted into a cool assessment. “I think I had enough of sales in 1944.”
Fury sighs. “Looks, Rogers, I understand this might be difficult for you—”
“Tony.”
With that, they break off into their separate tasks.
Steve is content to sit at the bar and watch Tony. He’s a natural on stage, his bright-eyed gaze, wide grin, and contagious enthusiasm. How he makes a person feel like they’re worth his time and attention, even in a crowd like this. Occasionally, his eyes find Steve in the back of the room and Tony’s gaze goes soft for just a moment. Just for Steve.
Tony rubs a hand over his eyes and down his face. “Barton, are you asking me if I’m making a sex bot that looks like Steve.”
“I don’t believe that.”
“Now?”
“We’re here now,” Steve says. “That’s enough.”
“Steve, you deserve a life that isn’t fighting for every last scrap. You don’t have to carry this alone anymore.” He stops, running a hand over his eyes. “Look, are you really going to make me give you the you-have-a-team-now speech?”
“Need help changing that tomorrow?”
Steve yanks the jagged-toothed shield tighter on his arm. He limps forward, and Tony thinks,
I'm anticipating there may be spoilers for the Loki series after chapter 2. I'll mark those chapters accordingly. (I began this fic almost two months ago, so this is a delightful coincidence.)
Tony swivels around in his chair. “You could have a life with Peggy,” he points out, ignoring how the thought makes his gut swim. “You don’t want that?”
BROCK RUMLOW: Time for the meeting, boss.
“Heard ‘em all when I was growing up.”
“What’s your problem?” Nat finally asks him as they give Steve some cover.
“I don’t have a Facebook.”
“Steve?”
“Ship sailed on that one before I was even defrosted, Tony,” Steve replies and, ignoring Tony’s indignant huff, hefts them both to their feet.
“Shield’s with my gear,” he says, catching Tony’s look as they run towards the rec room. “Don’t worry; I could always hit Bucky’s fast balls.”
Poor kid from Brooklyn, Tony remembers as they exit onto the city street. Then a bonds salesman. Then national hero.
Tony is quiet for a moment. “You don’t have to, you know.”
The sleep he gets after the Battle of New York is fitful, swirling with replays of the battle, the portal, and Captain America’s relieved face above him. Tony is up early the day after, making coffee in the communal kitchen and taking some comfort the team he’d fought aliens with is close by in the guest suites. He’s alone, but not. There’s a kind of peace to it.
“Sorry, what were you saying about worrying?”
“Don’t want me to fuck you in the armor?”
“You’re helping again,” Steve tells him.
“I could have,” Tony agrees, watching him. “I should’ve had you after the Battle of New York. Made that stiff back bend just a little.” He grins, a flash of his old self. “Perhaps over one of my workshop tables.”
“I’ll buy you a participation trophy for this mission, how about that,” Tony offers. “Congratulations. You did your job. Minimally.”
“Kinky,” Tony purrs.
“Might’ve thought more before signing up.”
“Steve. No more compliments, please. This old wind-up heart of mine can’t handle it.”
The first photograph turns up a few days after Steve calls the team meeting, splashed across the front of a tabloid that’s recently decided its sole beat is the Avengers.
“If I’d been assigned female at birth, they’d never have approved me for Project Rebirth.”
“How dare you, Agent Romanov,” Tony hisses, the suit’s modulation giving his voice a crackle on the end. “I am leading this team!”
“Who are they?” Tony croaks.
Steve considers. “Deal.”
Tony layers kisses down Steve’s spine. He digs his fingers into Steve’s sides, dragging down in that way that makes Steve press a moan into a pillow. Steve likes touch, Tony learned quickly. The data gathering has been a source of joy, watching how each shoulder touch means Steve leans closer. A palm pressed briefly to his back reassures him of your presence. He holds himself as still as he can in public, but when it’s just the two of them, Steve arches into every brush of Tony against him, stretching each moment of contact.
“More than I want to count.”
“VICTORY!” he shouts, holding it over his head.
He presses his hands down Tony’s sides and slips his fingers under the hem of Tony’s shirt. Tony surges forward, his body tight against Steve’s. Steve shifts backwards, nearly lifting Tony off his feet—too late he remembers,
Steve tosses Tony a few palm repulsors. “Remember not to accidentally kill your dear-old-not-yet-dad while he’s trying to escape from SHIELD’s New York facility and erase yourself from a photograph.”
whenever she sees him and Steve together. It’s brilliant.
Bucky studied him. “No. Something’s different. You’re too…” he paused, as if rolling the words around in his mouth. “Stiff. Boring. Trussed-up show pony.”
Tony lights up like Steve asked him to demonstrate his latest idea. “I know how to make it better.”
