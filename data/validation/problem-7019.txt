Nebula probably understands better than most, actually. She must, from the way she just figured out how the Arc Reactor worked and basically saved Tony’s life a few days ago. She… she knows. She certainly knows what it feels like.
hopeless, even then, Tony cannot stay still. It does against his very nature to still his hands and his racing thoughts, to accept defeat simply because he’s tired, because after so many years, it has been carved into him the idea that he can’t
A body, no ash, which means whatever killed this kid, it wasn’t Thanos. Merely what he left behind. And it’s been… It’s been
It should’ve been the first thing out of his mouth. And it damned nearly was. It almost was, when Tony got up and looked down at himself and his heart went
No. That's not good. Not if you don't actually kill him. Why? Because there's way too many problems still left unaddressed, problems Tony WILL have to face eventually. He won't die in that spaceship. I know he won't. So giving him too much time to reach that acceptance is too dangerous to consider. If they shove this acceptance down Tony's throat, everything I feared will become true. CW will be ignored. The many instances where Tony has been mistreated will be ignored. There will be no redemption. There will be a fight, a vengeance, and nothing more.
. He wants to believe the best of people, he really does, because admitting that people can be so cruel hurts deeply, no matter how many times it happens, but he can’t deny it that he has
“I’m fine, thank you, Your Highness.” Steve replies a lot less enthusiastically, his throat feeling a little raw and his eyes bloodshot from pressing his fingers into them until he could see white spots in his vision, trying not to let the goddamned
“Because I didn’t get to read them, before.” Clint justifies. “I mean— I’m not sorry I helped, but I kind of got into this mess without really knowing what it was all about.”
Nebula makes that sound again, the one who seems to be a curse, and retreats, exasperated. “Are you always this eager to maim yourself?”
“I didn’t know it was an Infinity Stone then.” Thor justifies. “Magic, even magic as powerful as the Aether had seemed, is not unheard of in Asgard. My father… My father had many things hidden across the universe, in an attempt to protect our people from getting close to it, or to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Chances are some of them won’t be discovered in thousands of years, if they ever are. I had no way of knowing the Aether was something more.”
He drops down heavily to the ground between the gun and the SUV, the armor shaping itself around him flawlessly to form a shield, a nearly impenetrable defense that covers him from head to toe, all the way to the wide sides. It covers the car nicely, and it’s
like a son to Jarvis. He does not like to be disrespectful, but Howard Stark was not always a good role model for a child, and Jarvis tried to fill more holes in Anthony’s education than any person in his position should have. For all intents and purposes, he was a butler, not a teacher. Not a parent. He had no authority over young Anthony Stark, but he loved him like a son anyway, just like his wife and Maria Stark had, and his loss hit him much harder that it should for a mere family acquaintance.
“Let her deal with her choices in her own way, Cap.” Clint tells him, gently, before averting his gaze. “We all made our choices. Now… Now he gotta deal with them.”
even, a tone of mulled resignation, almost amused defeat, her eyes understanding –, but Tony feels a razor blade slice through him anyway, guilt seeping in like lava slipping through the cracks, melting from the inside.
“Please be careful, Jarvis.” She tells him by the door, the same way Howard had done to her. “No one can know.”
Tony runs his hands over his face, roughly, fingers digging into his eyes so forcefully he can see white spots all over when he opens them, unhinged. “We don't have
“What good would it do?” Steve questions. “Bucky wasn’t himself, I thought he wouldn’t even remember, and HYDRA was still out there. It… It had been so long ago. Tony would get angry, he would want to get revenge. Why would I allow that to happen?”
“It was the only one I had.” He shrugs one shoulder, and offers no more explanation, because he has none to give.

“The composition of Vision’s physical form consisted in a structure made of Helen Cho’s artificially created neutral cells and a substantial amount of—"
Tony almost asks her what the hell Thor has anything to do with this, when he suddenly remembers that Thor was supposed to go after the guy who

Well, as we did with AoU, we are not pretending none of this happened. You can't really write an in-depth emotional arc for Tony without considering the people he holds dearest to him, can you? So let's talk about it! If this were an Avengers movie, Pepper and Rhodey would probably fade into the background and provide only some mild support and maybe an epic one-liner, not much else. But I've got time, and I've got a bone to pick, so let's make sure Rhodey and Pepper get their fair amount of analysis, as they should in Tony's POV.
Wong seems satisfied by Bruce’s assessment, and gives him a very slight raise of his chin, nodding. “This is the book necessary for anyone trying to become the next Sorcerer Supreme, or use the Time Stone for any purpose. It’s the most important book for the Kamar-Taj.”
“You must be hungry.” Shuri says, completely ignoring Bucky’s comment. “Come, we prepared a guest room for you. We can all meet at the dining room later, but you can get ready first.” She then gestures to the right with her hand, suggesting Bucky should go in front of her, and Bucky shoots Steve an inquiring look.
“I’ve read three versions of it so far.” Clint comments, keeping his tone very lighthearted, as if avoiding starting any sort of bad reaction; whether from Wanda, or from Steve. “It changes every time.”
“We will all feel his loss.” Wong admits, and it’s even more heartbreaking to hear how stiffly he holds himself through it, like he’s holding it all inside and not allowing himself to feel it.
Steve will not say he regrets it. He will not. Steve has been fighting HYDRA for over seventy years, he will not apologize for putting down Nazis and saving millions of being shot by giant floating machine-guns—
“Actually.” Bruce steps forward to Thor, a little frantic. “I think we might need your weapon too, Thor. If it’s the only thing here that is made of this… Uru metal, we need to take a look at what it is.”
Ross looks him up and down, as if considering if he should press the issue further, and Tony sits ramrod straight in his chair, spine stiff as metal, refusing to cower under the bastard’s calculating gaze. He has no reason to. Stress, pressure, and guilt - they are Tony’s old friends, and Thaddeus Ross’s judgment is not stinging enough to wound his thick skin, not punishing enough to bruise.
“I’m saying you could work something out.” Bucky insists, ignoring Steve’s comment. “You’re smart, Stevie. If anyone asks where I am, I’m sure you can find something to distract them.”
“I’m just glad to know he’s doing better.” He says, because he is. He really is. But just hearing it is not enough; he has to see it, to see Bucky, to give him a hug and tell him everything is going to be fine and
But sometimes, the line between vices and virtues is too thin, too easy to trespass, and ambition and grand goals sometimes makes us blind.
“Not our finest moment.” Tony agrees, with a small, sad grin; And maybe, too daringly, a quick glance to the side, to catch the others’ gaze.
“Shouldn’t I be the one asking that?” Tony asks back, moving his face away from her head so she can adjust her position and look up at him. “You were the one organizing entire teams of SHIELD agents down there.”
“Guys.” Rhodey calls from behind Rogers, very cautiously, and Tony would feel a little uncomfortable with how obvious it is that Rhodey was waiting for a chance to interrupt them without setting off any of them into a rage fit, but he’s keyed up enough that he can only feel grateful for Rhodey’s peaceful intervention. “Thor is waiting for us. C’mon.”
, as if she wasn’t capable of handling it herself? That shit has to stop too. You might a Super Soldier, but you’re not a god, alright?
people to feel, but never himself. Like he had no right. People had seen worse than he did, had lived worse than he did— why would he feel grief? Why would he… Why would he be
So it could be better if he just flew by himself first, in the armor, to DC. Rhodey could come with him, too. People know them, people know they can
After everything they have been through, everything Natasha has done to help them, Steve had been under the impression that she knew. That she knew, even if she couldn’t
“She destroyed it, but—" Bruce coughs, the words getting choked up in his throat, too big to be uttered, too painful. “He had the Time Stone. He turned back time and made it whole again.”
“I’m – I’m just a SHIELD Agent, Tony. I was never supposed to be an Avenger. You think I want this? I was caught on this by accident, I wasn’t even part of PEGASUS, I was supposed to be watching over Selvig while he searched on the Tesseract. Otherwise, I’d be with Coulson on his new division. I didn’t even get the chance to be debriefed before Thor’s hammer was found in New Mexico and I was moved to a new section. I wasn’t
“I have a thing.” Tony explains, which is no explanation at all, and motions to the table again. “Leave it here.”

That’s bad, isn’t it? Germany. Steve supposes their relationship whit the US is far more amicable now, because the War is so far behind them, but he can’t help but feel like it was not so long ago. Because it really hasn’t, much less for him. He remembers Bucky making a comment about it amidst the beautiful gardens of Wakanda, about how Steve had been just of the brink of starting another war between the two nations, and the idea chills him to the bone.

“Don’t forget I still have your suit!” She yells, cupping her hands around her mouth unnecessarily, smiling wide as she walks backwards. “Let me know when you want it back. I’ll give you some upgrades!” And the she waves enthusiastically, a wide smile on her lips, her eyes gleaming with the idea of giving him a little piece of her tech for him to try.
, as if the slightest hint of movement would startle Vision, would make him leave, and Steve needs this information the same way he needs air.
How panicked he felt inside, knowing he was so small still, despite all he’d been through, because the world had given him no time for rest; No time
Thor pauses, a grave, weighty thing, solemn and thoughtful, and though when he speaks his voice is full of care, there is no doubt that his words, carefully enunciated and selected, are
“He’s right, he wouldn’t.” Nebula intervenes, somber, but with dead certainty, and it helps to keep the slight wave of panic Tony can feel surging inside him. “Thanos looked for these Stones his entire life. Years wasted on this quest. And the Gauntlet makes him powerful – he wouldn’t give up power now that he believes he has it all.”
Tony had known that he was signing for a war he had no way of leaving. Tony came out as Iron Man as soon as he had the chance because he isn’t
“We’ll check underneath.” Natasha’s voice answers efficiently, although Nebula doesn’t say a word. Tony can’t see them to check if everything’s alright.
“We can’t answer distress calls anymore.” He says, in a hollow tone. It’s not a scream, it’s not even a demand. Maybe just a statement. Just a broken, reluctant statement, and nothing else.
“You’re not.” A voice interrupts, kind but undoubtedly firm, making itself known with no intentions of being ignored. Somewhat irritated, even. Fair, considering that Tony suddenly realizes he
“Daniel!” She shouts in the general direction of the door, getting up in a haste to examine the wires, the power cord, the screen, everything she can get her hands on, her heart beating so loudly in her chest she feels like it might escape. “Give me a hand here!”
, but now it is bursting out of him, the overflowing dam he has tried to hard to keep closed all this time… It’s just spilling over. It’s spilling over because he doesn’t know how to
All this time, all those months thinking about that question, and Steve doesn’t have an answer. He doesn’t have an answer and
“Yeah.” Pepper says, as gently as she can. “I know. And you also put yourself at risk, every single time.”
Tony is watching the doors of the workshop when Bruce says it, thoughts lost on what lies beyond the glass, the echoes of footsteps up the stairs and the cold chill of the wind that somehow worms its way into the corridors of the Compound; like the dust had, skimming along surfaces in a rush of freezing breath, that makes hairs on his arms stand on end in alert. The words seem to catch up with him late, a delay thick and heavy like fog in his brain, all tendrils of thought lost to another focus, far away.
It's a very slippery slope, that one. The secrets we tell, the secrets we keep. The secrets we know, and the secrets they don't. If Steve wants transparency, then I will give it to him; and he will have to pay the price for it, but unfortunately for him, that price is much higher than he would expect. But now we're laying all cards on the table. That is the sacrifice that must be made in name of regaining trust. Half of the job is learning the truth - the other half, learning how to live with it.

But then, Tony remembers Pepper, and he realizes Rhodey might have gone looking for her first, like he sometimes did, and—
, to be miserable, but sometimes, it is how he feels, earning for something he doesn’t have anymore not because it was taken from him—
“Boss.” FRIDAY says, curtly. “At this rate, the numbers will keep depleting. Until there is no one left.”
Nebula seems pleased that he agrees. But as they continue to descend, Tony can’t help but keep wondering, brows still pinched together in confusion, trying to imagine how their landing must’ve played out. He doesn’t remember a thing, besides the vague sensation of distant voices and numbed touches on his skin. Also like he experienced it all from inside a thick glass cage, a layer of white noise that scrambled his senses, and nothing actually absorbed into his mind. He’s not sure if he should feel lucky or not.
, and how this must feel for her now, knowing such a simple pleasure has been tarnished twice in her life, by loss and by separation, stealing all the flavor from her tongue.
“Loki comes in with the scepter, and that’s our first contact with the Mind Stone.” Barton provides, if a little coldly.
I won't blame you, if you do. To be honest, I don't think it'll ever be enough because the damage has already been done. Once bitten, twice shy.
“You guys came in the Quinjet.” Rhodey points out, raising an eyebrow. “Are supposed to just leave it here?”
, take it easy.” Rocket exclaims, and Tony raises his head in a snap fast enough to see how Rocket steps back and raises his hands,
Fuck, but it’s so complicated, to feel regret – but at the same time, not. He doesn’t regret fighting. But he regrets how it happened.
” Wanda counters. “It was wrong, and unless I get it under control, I will keep doing it. And somebody’s going to get hurt.
“That was—” Tony needs to take a step back, or else he’s gonna end up slapping the alien raccoon and he refuses to be goaded into this argument like a freaking child. “What are you saying, that I shouldn’t have warned them that what they’re doing is
“What options!?” Tony raises his shoulders in questioning, feeling defensive, like he always does, because he's had this argument with her so many times that he can already predict what she's going to say.
“I need FRIDAY.” Tony says mostly to himself, ignoring her grumbling, starting on a mental list to keep himself occupied, to have just the smallest comfort of pretending he has a plan to work this out. He ignores thoughts of the kid, he ignores everything else. “Where is the ship?”
“I once told Jane,” Thor points out, calmly. “That my understanding of the universe and yours is not that far apart. We might have a better grasp on how to use the forces of the universe in Asgard, but many of the things we use without a thought are the things you study every day.”
She keeps the circuit board he built, the one Howard so selfishly ignored because he was so distracted, so focused on everything else but his own
“It doesn’t. Yet.” The man finally looks him in the eye, and something about his gaze shifts when he does. Like a wall being put down, even if Jarvis can see many more still standing strong in his expression and body language. “But it will, if you end up finding something you don’t wanna find. So, help me here. What do you want to find, Mr. Jarvis?”
I can't believe this happened. I really had to cut the final chapter in half because the word count just went too crazy. 20k, and this is only half of it. This has officially spiraled out of my control. Send help.
“When you have a limited number of allies, organizing teams is more efficient.” Thor calmly arguments “It’s what we did, after we fled from Asgard.”
“Like what, you run his errands?” Bruce raises an eyebrow. “A hundred dollars for a coffee cup at three AM?”
“I’d say I’d put on the armor and follow you to the fight, but I know that wouldn’t fix anything. If not this fight, there will always be the next. And I can’t use the suit like you do. It was never my… my
“I don’t care.” Steve says, plainly. “He can scream whatever the hell he likes. As long as we can get in, find Bruce and understand what happened.”
curiosity in his voice, the unexpected willingness to talk and the shocking opening Steve is giving him, when T’Challa has only known him at his most guarded before today.
Steve doesn’t even have proof that this is truly what was going on, but once the idea formed in his head, he can’t remove it. He enters the workshop confidently, JARVIS easily allowing him in, and Tony doesn’t even turn around to greet him, still bent over an engine of sorts and very carefully ignoring Steve.
There are more. The entire A section was Avengers Business, and Peter’s armor had been one of many in Tony’s list; But there’s the personal line too, the one with Peter’s internship, his college aid, and so much more. Tony knows all their names by heart. Again, overbearing, maybe, but that’s why he had the protocol. So he won’t do it without thinking about it. He wrote it down, and that has to be enough until it’s necessary to use them,
“Well, not in these exact words,” Tony shrugs, “but he asked if he could also ask JARVIS to buy things for him and I said yes, and right after that he ordered enough purple paint and oreos that I would be concerned, if I cared. Luckily, I don’t.”
“If you really think that’s what happened, you’re so lucky you’re pretty, Rogers, because there’s clearly something wrong with your head.”
If you think Pepper's reservations are about Iron Man, you're only seeing half the picture. There's a pattern to her behavior, and that pattern is directly related to what Tony does or doesn't do. If you think Iron Man is the problem, you're watching Pepper react to Tony's actions without thinking about Tony's actions. About what they mean. You can't understand why Pepper does what she does with their relationship without looking at Tony too. His morals, his actions, his choices.
at him, and he had no idea what had happened next. It had been almost closing hours, Tony gathered by the almost empty café, but he and Steve seemed to be talking for
refuses to, or Austria, because the entire country is still far too guarded against them for it to be an option, but other than that, they have become so good at getting by undetected that no border is really a problem to them anymore.
“We don’t know if Pietro had anything other than his physical abilities, but Wanda’s powers were directly involved with the Mind Stone, even more than her brother’s.” Rogers points out.
The voice is surprisingly calm, almost uninterested. Jarvis ceases his typing, but he does not turn around, instead reaching for a gun he had already placed beside himself, keeping his finger on the trigger as a precaution.
13-K had been Tony’s and Harley’s compromise. Their emergency plan. Since Harley wouldn’t accept his own AI, despite Tony’s insistence – assuming, maybe correctly, that Tony
“I couldn’t sleep. Not like this.” Thor says, almost conversationally, and maybe it would have been convincing if he hadn’t stared at Tony unblinkingly as if he feared Tony would do something in the split second it would take him to open his eyes. When Tony does not react, still hunched over the table with shoulders raised like a wary animal, ready to spook, Thor’s body language mellows into something… softer, more open, surprisingly inviting for his rugged appearance and bulky frame. “I thought of finding Banner, but I’ve been informed he’s asleep. I think he spent the entire night going through the books, and he might still be out for a couple of hours.”
, and Tony almost has to avert his gaze, because if he stares at it too long, he’s going to lose it.
“The Stone didn’t kill her?” Rocket asks, confused, and with a strange twinge of surprise in his voice. “Just touching the Power Stone killed a bunch of people.”
tried to stop it. Tony has done so much, he has restlessly thought about this, about this threat, about this
Months go by like this. It’s how Steve starts to count the passage of time; One country, one measure. He loses himself to the different landscapes and city lines, changes in temperature and humidity of the air, the color of the sky, the accent of the people. Time converts itself into a different type of scale, one that it’s no longer based in
It was hell on earth. Steve had spent that entire night wanting to knock himself out cold, just so he could stop thinking, could stop his heart from hurting, and thanks to the serum it was completely useless. It all felt useless. So the step he took next was the one that defined everything; The one where he chose to stop looking back, reckless and unyielding, refusing to bend or be swayed, carrying his mission to the end even if it
“Take battle to Wakanda, and T’Challa tries to end them away from the rest of the world. Clever.” Tony murmurs to himself, thinking out loud.
Wherever trouble appears, Steve Rogers comes barging in, ready to fight and command and probably destroy a building or two, depends on who they’re fighting and for what end.
“Vision was more than just the Stone.” Bruce says, and by the way he says it, it’s not the first time he’s done this speech. “We thought maybe if we could remove it, Vision would still be well enough that he could live without it. And Wanda could destroy the Stone.”
“We are here to answer the distress call that was sent to us. We only want to understand what we’re dealing with, so we can help the people out there.” Ross –
Once again, something that is not quite fondness, but it’s also not just surprise, floods Tony in a warm rush of sensation. It’s – It’s mindboggling, honestly, even if it happens over and over again, to see Nebula
“I don’t know.” Steve admits, even though he feels like he’s gutting himself as he does, because at this point, he can’t help but being as brutally honest as he can. He can’t muster the strength to hide or lie. He’s completely bare. He’s
He’s not sure exactly how long. It feels like a couple of hours, but by the battered state of his body and the completely drained state of his mind, he can’t be sure. It starts off slow. At first, he thinks it’s just his body losing the adrenaline, his muscles going numb and him losing all feeling of his toes and fingers, his eyelids getting surprisingly heavy every time he tries to keep them open. He passes off as sleepiness, despite him knowing the numbness is not normal. But for safety’s sake, he tries to keep himself awake, observing the ever-shifting numbers on the panels of the Benatar, even when they start to make even less sense than they did before.
“I was horrible to him.” Natasha interrupts his thoughts, and she does it on purpose, by the way her eyes are locked on Steve’s face with an unyielding conviction, determined to say this out loud, determined for Steve to
“I’m sorry.” The words stumble out of Tony’s mouth, awkward and uncertain, but sincere – because he has no idea who this Gamora is, but he thinks she was probably someone to respect, if half the universe seems to be in a tirade to find her… or, he guesses,
“Romanoff!” Steve yells, and Tony is almost glad he does because it distracts from the blast of his repulsor accidentally going too far and hitting a trashcan, and he can blame it on Steve for startling him. Which he probably will have to do, as Clint is
“You don’t get to talk about my feelings, Barton.” Tony commands. “I screwed up with Ultron but I did what I could to fix it. And I never denied it that I screwed up. I fixed the Compound, we created Vision, I
Tony, against all odds, lets out a laugh, breathy and startled, sounding almost like a bark, and even if his heart squeezes with somber emotions, his eyes flicker with mirth.
Tony has seen chaos, the kind of chaos that happened when a frightened city runs in despair as alien attackers fall from the sky, but that’s – this is not the same. These people – they are beyond any semblance of rationality or solidarity, not caring about what happens to the others so long as they get out of the way; It…
Tony walks in with his head up high because they are going out there and saving people, and that is all that matters. He’s going to push down his worries and his hurt and he’ll do his job, he’ll save this world, no matter the cost, because this is not about
Pepper opens her mouth, ready to scream, her usually meticulous composure completely shattered by the wrecking of the past days, the poorly concealed, agonizing uncertainty, the fear of being alone, of losing anyone else, so raw it nearly reminds of a burn directly to the skin. Searing, stinging. Painful.
He exhales shakily, biting the inside of his cheek, and looks back at Nebula, unable to stop himself.
Tony has such a big influence on their team – He is the other half of what used to hold them together, and why had Steve never taken the time to make sure they were
Steve knows Scott won’t even mention Bucky, not if he can help it, because bringing the Winter Soldier issue to the table would be much worse for all parties involved. Steve doesn’t know Scott all that well, but he knows he is no idiot, and he’s probably aware of the fact that playing the ignorance card is the safest bet he has to get out of a very heavy sentence. He is the one with less understanding of the entire debacle involving Bucky, him and Clint both, and the probability of his sticking a foot up his mouth if he tries to use that information as a bargaining chip is way too high for him to risk it.
Tony thought he was in the bathroom. He even left a note. The door was closed, and he thought he heard water running –
Steve startles when he suddenly feels a hand on his shoulder, heavy and warm, and realizes he was so out of it he didn’t even notice Clint walking around the counter to stand by his side. He wonders, for a second, if Clint can see the rising
“And how does that make it right?” Wanda exclaims loudly. “We hurt each other and that’s fine? It’s not. We’re
and his serum-enhanced hearing is definitely working, someone does sneak up on him, and he startles so bad he almost breaks the keyboard.
She lets him go with a nod, steps around him and leaves, her low heels making muted sounds against the floor, slowly getting farther and farther away until Steve can’t hear her anymore. And it takes a long time. She leaves the rooftop and goes down the stairs, at least two levels down, and even so, Steve can’t bring himself to move.
, as if he could press away the pain that flares inside. “We’re trapped here. It’s over. He won. We’re done.”
“So.” Steve sighs, pulling back slowly and reclining on his chair, before giving a nervous chuckle, suddenly realizing how extremely overwhelming that felt. His hands are shaking. “You still up for this?” Steve asks coyly, looking at her from under his lashes, as if she couldn’t see right through his ridiculous attempt of sounding innocent.
coffee. “Unexpected, huh? Next thing you know, we’re having team dinners down at the new Indian place, real buddies.”
Steve wasn’t actively trying to stay alone with Wanda, but Clint stepped out for some extra groceries and the opportunity just presented itself. He has to admit he has a soft spot for her, but they don’t interact much, besides from the hours they spend training together at the Compound and that one, very painful conversation they had after the incident in Nigeria.
Tony can argue that this is a time-sensitive issue, Pepper will argue that if Tony goes out there like this, he’ll die.
But Steve doesn’t have to think about it, because the door has been opened. He can’t stop it now. Everything is coming back to him in a rush, a flare of white-hot anger, and he can’t find it in him to hold back.
Rogers damn nearly startles, stepping back just a fraction, as if he’s surprised by Tony’s reaction. He blinks, once, and almost immediately his whole body goes stiff as marble again, and his voice comes out strained when he says:
of it. He could say he didn’t know better because he sure didn’t have the best role models, but since when is he allowed to accept poor excuses for himself? He doesn’t, not ever. He simply has to live with the knowledge that he screwed up, more than once, but dammit,
. But they weren’t, they were right there in front of him, and he knew it. He told himself he wanted to grasp the new style of architecture, the arches and the columns, all the fine details; and he would draw them again and again, but they never felt right, simply because he hadn’t felt like they were
Tony snaps his head to the side in a reflex of suppressing his flinch – but not fast enough that Rhodey doesn’t catch it.
, in any shape or form. He almost slips off the step, and he grips the railing hard and suddenly, and even his fingers ache with the movement.
“We’ll divide them between us. Share the workload.” Rogers says, a little louder, and he turns back quickly just so he can grab some of the books Bruce has laid on top of the table, passing one to Natasha, one to Scott. “Can FRIDAY help us with the translation?”
“I have no way of getting there.” Pepper reminds him, harshly. “Every single road is blocked! I’ve been in this area for days, no one can leave. I can’t walk all the way back to the Compound.”
“Yeah.” Tony confesses, in a breathless grumble. “I didn’t notice until Johannesburg when she got you too, but… yeah.”
She makes an aborted gesture towards Tony, nearly swatting Pepper’s hands away, but the quick turn Pepper makes back and the “Tony, are you okay?” she exclaims is fast enough that it halts Nebula in her defensive movement, waiting patiently for Pepper’s next move.
“Tony.” Natasha clarifies. “You’re waiting for him to ask you to come back, aren’t you? You won’t come back, not if he doesn’t ask you to.”
But Clint, just like everyone else, is not in the same wave-length as Steve. He sighs, releasing tension from his shoulders, as if he knows that if he doesn’t back down, Steve won’t listen to him. “Lets get one thing straight: I
, something he doesn’t know if it’s a memory of just his imagination, an echo of a forgotten ghost, that still haunts him when he drops his guard.
Vision makes a sound that almost seems like surprise, like he wasn’t expecting this. “Yes, he is. But it is not the same as it was before, Captain, I can tell you that. His heart has recovered from the extraction of the Reactor and his sternum healed correctly. This reactor is a new version of it, not invasive as the previous one Mr. Stark used to wear, and it is based on a different kind of technology. It allows him to have the armor close at all times, in case of necessity. He says its… for precaution.”
“And what’s your excuse?”, he teases, but his joke falls short. His hurried, stumbling steps and his breathless voice give away every single bit of the vulnerability that aches inside him, and no matter what he does, he can’t pull it back.
He can’t be sure what the reason Howard Stark was killed for – but he can guess, and each guess is worse than the other, ranging from personal to public enemies of the man, to hidden figures he can only hope to glance at by the periphery of his eyes, by the details and footnotes of all the events in Howard Stark’s life. As quietly as he can he searches for answers, but everything he can do is limited to the fact he can’t rely on anyone but himself, and he is just one man; and Howard Stark’s reach was so grand he often seemed he was more than that, even if Jarvis does know better.
“Remember the Mind Stone?” Bruce prompts, gesturing to Tony. “What we found inside it? That was… crazy. That was not just a composition of a chemical component, it was an entire
would have been offended if Tony had worded it like he almost did. She is kind of high-strung, he reminds himself, not exactly the warm and fuzzy kind of person. So he stops, and tries again.
And Tony chokes, his rage subsiding into a shy flame, muffled by the deepest shame and sorrow he has ever felt.
Tony knows he is not nearly as wise as Thor is, for all the times Thor sounds like he’s too innocent, or too aloof, or too… something; There has always been a quiet, silent sort of intelligence to him, something that went unnoticed beneath the impressive image and power he had, but present anyway, and now, with his dual colored eyes, scars, and somber look – he uses that wisdom on his sleeve, much closer to reach, somehow gentler and harsher at the same time, a frightening power in and of itself.
Rocket is the one to offer her comfort this time. He doesn’t put a hand on her shoulder, but he steps closer, close enough that he can brush against her a little, silent companionship, and Nebula shifts her weight to her other leg so she can stay close, unknowingly or not.
for a second. They seem so caught off guard that it somehow to keep them still for a while. Thankfully, Tony doesn’t seem to have harmed anyone, or so he hopes; But he can’t be sure, and the size of the crowd doesn’t let him accurately account for everyone who should have been hit by the current.
“What isn’t wrong, Steve?” she asks, a bit exasperated, her eyes anguished, and lips pressed in a thin line. But the moment barely lasts a second; She sniffles and shifts her gaze away, clearing her throat, turning her entire face away from him. “Don’t worry. I just got a lot on my mind.”
?” Steve asks, rudely interrupting a conversation he simply happened to stumble upon, but the surprise burns so strong he couldn’t help it.
That sort of thing tends to put things in perspective. Time included. So time, time is something Tony understands, in some levels, but
Tony looks around for himself, trying to gather any details that could help him decipher this enigma – although he knows that he, of all people, will be the least likely to recognize a hospital, considering he avoids them like the plague, except for when he visits children at their wards.
Ms. Carter playfully smiles at him, trying to make him more at ease, and the crinkles around her eyes only make her seem more jovial in his eyes, and he cannot help but smile back. “Oh, stop that. You know you can call me Peggy.”
That seems to bring some relief to Rogers, who sighs softly and drops his shoulders, but the effect this information has on Tony is completely opposite.
additional data, replacing the projections of the Earth with close-ups of a clear sky on the left and a cloudy, dark, bleak shot of a huge swirling mist, so thick Tony could feel the phantom sensation of it in his fingers, could smell in his mind if he allowed himself to recall the scent.
Tony’s eyebrows raise in confusion. “What? The magic thing? Don’t ask me, Thor is the one who understood the talk. I only got like half of it.”
– but is always so unprepared for, rare as it is, to witness Rhodey’s limits being dangerously approached.
It is unusually fast— but that is not really surprising, is it? Everyone is probably pulling strings trying to speed up the process, calling in favors, making deals and making threats, all in favor of this one good show. This barbaric judgment. Steve can’t help but feel terrible, as if he’d somehow thrown Scott to the wolves, and now all he can do is stand back and watch as they tear him apart.
Natasha saw him as a threat. She might even believe he is innocent, Steve honestly isn’t sure, but she had never trusted Bucky would ever be
Steve doesn’t like to fight his friends. He particularly doesn’t like to fight Tony, because he likes Tony, he respects Tony a lot, and it
“Then they probably did something right.” Nebula comments, slightly more satisfied. “I thought you’d die for a moment.”
Nebula actually hasn’t said anything of substance to Pepper yet, but Nebula gives her a nod, in silent confirmation.
“Soul.” Nebula and Bruce reply at the same time; one, with rapid logic, the other, with gut-wrenching agony in her voice. Nebula seems embarrassed by her outburst, shying away from Bruce’s glance with a turn of her face, and in turn, Rocket looks at her by his side with an incredibly raw look of pain on his face.
the weight of Vision’s unhuman gaze on his face, his analytical, piercing eyes watching Steve’s every move, because he knows that those words struck Steve right in his weakest spot, right at the heart of all of Steve’s fears.
“Tony.” Rhodey calls, urgently, but no words follow up to his call. But in his tone, Tony hears a thousand things.
it that thing can stand a second snap.” Rocket reminds them. “Thor said it – it was nearly broken. What’s gonna happen if we try to use it and it explodes in our hands?”
God, this is not fair. He’s being unfair. No matter how much he wants to avoid this – this is just him being petty, and look at Bruce, his retreating posture, his averting gaze – he doesn’t deserve Tony’s bullshit.
, but they’re not just two. They’re three. Three monsters, of science and madness, trapped between hope and hopelessness, paving ways to hell with all the good intentions that have fallen short.
Like a flash, echoes of this conversation reverberate within the many corners of his memory, still feeling fresh and tender despite how old some of these memories are, how long they’ve been living inside him and repeating over and over like a broken record, an issue they can never get past, a pattern that is destined to be a stone in their way for as long as Tony fails to meet a middle ground between his instincts, and Pepper’s request.
because people are trying to hold them back, trying to push their own agendas into their hands and use them for selfish reasons.
Thor makes a disbelieving noise “I bet you a hundred dollars the Captain would really appreciate… your help.”
“See?” Tony points, even though it’s unnecessary, just so he has something to do with his hands. The image is a little distorted by the movement of the helmet, but it’s not completely useless – there’s clearly a figure in green perched on top of Thanos, who stands gigantic, threatening, even down in one knee, as Tony’s arms in the Mark L armor at the base of the frame grasp him by the wrist and pull the Gauntlet out of the bastard’s hand with all their strength. “Mantis is holding him down by manipulating his mind. It was the only thing that would get him to stop fighting long enough for us to get close.”
“Alright, drop it.” Steve interrupts, wildly uncomfortable, hoping they can’t notice it by his voice. “We’re not here to discuss the
it. He absolutely means it. His eyes have that careful and analytical gleam to them, that one that makes Steve feel so inferior, so naïve and helpless before a man much wiser than he is, despite the incredible differences in their experiences. Steve has never felt as wise as T’Challa seems to be. He has never felt this kind of ease and imposing tranquility that the king has. Must have. T’Challa is a man used to putting himself in the line of fire every time he makes a decision, for his choices rarely affect only himself, and this is the result of that necessity. This is the culmination of all his years as a leader, the leader he’s been told he should be ever since he was born.
Stone.” Rocket drawls sarcastically. “It packed one hell of a punch. It reacted to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the surge.”
If Tony had wanted any proof that Nebula wasn’t lying about still having people around, there was no crueler way to give it to him than this. But there it is – there’s his
Nebula’s expression falls, her hardened mask crumbling down, for the briefest of moments – and behind it, Tony finally sees
“He will be alright.” Princess Shuri smiles out of the corner of her mouth, trying to give him a little sense of security.
But she doesn’t. She stops, and her breath hitches, and whatever she remembers, it makes her eyes flash in a way they almost glaze over for a brief second, before her entire body closes up like a door being slammed shut, the rampage about to come pouring out of her halting suddenly before a wall. She shakes with the force it takes her to hold it back. Tony is so terribly aware that they are being
“Are you sure?” he asks, sounding every bit as preoccupied as he feels, but he doesn’t sound reprimanding. Which is a victory in his book— because Steve knows how cutting he can sound when he damn well wants to.
This is not good. They have a problem with their spaceship now? Damn it – they’re gonna need the Benatar. Once they’re done with this – and they will be, Tony will make sure they find a solution to this mess, even if it’s the last thing he’ll do – the Benatar is the only viable option they have to transport a large group of people across space while they look for Thanos. Thor has that… weird, glowy thing he does whenever he wants to travel, but they can’t rely on that. Tony now realizes his Reactor is Tesseract-based tech, but at the end of the day, he’s an
“I’m just trying to understand, Tony, I swear.” Bruce pleads, so fucking sincere and earnest, it hurts Tony’s heart. “I was going to leave it alone,  I swear – but then I find out you were hiding the phone, and I can’t imagine why you’d do that, since when Steve and the others got to the Compound, Rhodey accepted them with open arms. And now, the way you reacted… What happened, that Rhodey is fine with them, and you aren’t?”
But he actually agrees, this time. He agrees. Tony doesn’t want them separating, not before he can get his own head sorted out and find a way to process this without the complete, bottomless dread and fear clouding his judgment, feeding into the catastrophe steaming from his memories and leaking poison and panic into his logic.
They set the route to the general direction of the Earth, somewhere around the place Squidward's ship had taken impulse and flown away, because that’s as far as the signal of the armor can lead them to – And he thinks about how fucked up that is, that he is so far away that he has left his planet far enough that he doesn’t know how to get back to it. It’s terrifying, how far away from home he is, lost amidst stars that are too quiet, the endless, terrifying darkness, the very same Tony sometimes still dreams about when he tries to sleep.
to know. I tried to work with him, I tried to reason, obviously it didn’t work. And I don’t work with people like that - bad for team morale.”
just… disappeared. There has been no explanation, no rhyme or reason to the devastating loss that everyone had just been forced to experience.
there, eyes still open, mouth parted as if in a gasp, a trickle of dried blood staining his lips. He looks gray, like the entire world around him. He’s all twisted and sprawled, a ragged doll thrown out of the window, left on the floor to be forgotten by time.
Steve hasn’t been good at following orders in a very long time – and he thinks about telling her just that, but they have
“But she’s terrified, Cap.” Clint explains, before Steve has the chance to answer. He steps closer, lowering the tone of his voice even more, to be completely sure Wanda won’t hear his next words. “She doesn’t understand her powers and she has to do something about it. She’s been getting stronger. And I honestly can’t blame her for being scared, because I’d be scared shitless too.”
But no one is arguing. Natasha and Rogers are both adjusting the controls and grabbing the controls, pushing them slowly towards the ground, looking for a place to land that is not completely unstable. They can’t land on any of the roofs, because it seems like there has been an explosion, and the buildings surrounding the plane are all covered in black, sprays of ash and soot across their windows and fronts, a testament to just how strong the explosion caused by the plane must’ve been. One of the nearby buildings has almost an entire chunk of the front missing, probably from something that flew into it from the plane.
“There’s a few bases we need to cover.” Pepper adds, in a quick and efficient commentary, a swift addition that reminds Tony of the way she handles a boardroom. “Find civilians, organize them in teams, look for survivors in accident sites. Distribution of food. Gather a med team and create a basic rescue plan.”
He will think about Tony later. He had the suit. He had FRIDAY. He would be fine. Steve couldn’t stay, he had to protect Bucky, had to get him away from Tony, he’ll fix this later. He’ll find a way. But first, he has a mission, and he will complete it before anything else – he owes Bucky that.
, and the otherworldly feelings that come attached to it. Feelings that surpass his ability to describe them, feelings that still make him feel like his stomach is collapsing into itself when he thinks about it for far too long, his gut tight and overwhelmed, make him feel helpless and small and so, so lonely, and Rhodey’s presence seems like a beacon of light that reflects all the way from a distant past, from a mirror of a horror Tony never truly left behind, to guide him home.
“No, I get it.” Bruce reassures after a beat, even if his tone is still dripping in sadness. “Short-term, it makes more sense to prioritize rescue missions. I get it, I do. It’s just… I looked through some old papers.” He shivers. “And it doesn’t look good, Tony. It’s bad.”
and unfocused stare. “Heat signatures are not the most reliable way to calculate such a large mass—”
We still have to deal with one little issue concerning Natasha as well. I meant it when I said her friendship with Steve is very strange; Or rather, in comparison to some of Steve's other relationships, this one in particular seems to come from a place that is a little off. So let's talk about it some more. I'm certainly always very eager to dismantle the details of their relationships for fun.
to listen and be guided; The only exception being, of course, Sokovia, but even then, it was the Iron Legion who had had to deal with broken parts and the rain of stones and dirt thrown their way by an enraged and bitter crowd. How can they deal with this without scaring the civilians, without hurting them, when they’re so intent in hurting others?
It’s a feeling that is not quite anxiety, but it’s also not anticipation. It’s eager, but not comforting. Steve was never one for nervous ticks, but sometimes, he does feel the inexplicable urge to bounce his leg or twist his hands together, or keep
asking him, but that is all Tony can do right now. “This is U, and this is Dum-E.”, he introduces, patting them as he says their names, and they both make a whirring sound at being called, their mechanical pincers twitching and moving frantically, emulating the feeling of
Steve watches him leave, long after he disappears behind the buildings that obscure the horizon of the city, and he hears Wanda’s careful footsteps approaching him from behind a few moments later. He doesn’t turn, because he feels like she would feel intimidated if he did, as if he’d confront her about her feelings about this sudden visit, so she approaches calmly and stands beside him so they both can stare at the sky and breathe in deep, willing their hearts to slow down before heading back inside and facing the rest of their teammates.
Steve frowns, taken aback by heavy, insistent suggestion he can hear in Clint’s voice, but he doesn’t know what to do about it. He’s not quite sure what Clint is trying to say. He doesn’t want to ask, not really, but he
How could Tony trust them with this? Would Steve have even listened? He wants to believe he would’ve, but he doesn’t actually want to say it. He doesn’t want to be wrong. He doesn’t to be disappointed with himself, he doesn’t want to be disappointed anymore.
So many details that should be insignificant but aren’t anymore. A slowly building paranoia, an ugly feeling that he might one day snap his own neck for not being too careful while looking over his shoulder. It makes his skin crawl. He hasn’t felt like this since the war.
what he had. He misses the US and the small, but familiar life he had there, he misses the Compound, he misses—
He doesn’t have much time to appreciate it, no, because his mind and his highly alert and paranoid instincts won’t let him. He wraps Bucky’s arm around his shoulders and carries most of his weight all journey, extremely conscious of his presence, his weight, his breathing pattern. It’s ragged, painful, but its
“So that’s how it is.” Sam comments, more to himself than for all of them, but it oud enough for them to hear. He sounds defeated.
“Pepper.” Rogers calls back her attention, and all of them turn, Pepper’s head snapping to him sharply, no concession or surrender in her posture or her eyes. Rogers probably makes it worse, with his tone, low and sad, which he probably thinks that comes off as sympathetic, but for a woman like Pepper, it only sounds
And it comes with additional worldbuilding and plot support! Who doesn't love some multipurpose conflict?
Despite the slight acidity in Nebula’s tone, Pepper does not step back, and Tony knows Nebula registers this as something noteworthy, because her eyes, even if they are pitch-black and guarded, twitch with stunned curiosity.
Bruce lets out a harsh breath. “They were surprisingly accurate with their concerns, especially considering how long ago that thing must’ve been written. It seems like the reason why they use dark energy – which is the domain of the Reality Stone, you’re right,” he vaguely gestures at Tony, and then runs his hand through his greying hair, messing his curls in a nervous tick. “Is exactly because they

who has once chided Natasha for almost compromising their mission because of her own agenda, trusts her more than he trusts anyone else in his life.
“Not your fault.” Sam whispers, and Steve wonders how much of those words Sam is saying to himself. “Whatever happened to Barnes is
They start to descend, and he gives a quick look to both his of them, seeing Natasha adjusting her uniform and arming herself with her Bites and knives, as the Quinjet enters the autopilot for a safe landing and Sam quickly reaches for his Wings, the perfect replica princess Shuri had given him once his original had been taken by Ross.
“I saw you bit your lip so hard I almost thought you were gonna bleed all over my pillows.” An exaggeration, but these really

to me.” Pepper begs, holding his arms, going around so she can stand in front of him so he can’t ignore her again. “What you’re suggesting, it’s too dangerous. Please… You’re not okay. You can’t be serious.”
“Yes.” Steve says, and it is as heavy as every other lie he is ever told, every single one of them that still taste like poison in his tongue as he swallows the truth back down. “Thank you for telling me, Vision.”
– but the Civil War… that was a bad call. That’s all. People are allowed to make bad calls, even Tony. Doesn’t mean Steve doesn’t like him anymore. He needs Tony to know that.
Ok, here we go. It's finally time to dive in deep and tackle the first really uncomfortable subject we need to adress in this fic: The Sokovia Accords.
He created Ultron mindlessly, because he was scared of his nightmares about the Chitauri, and once he realized what he’d done, he helped them destroying it.
yet. It’s not that he doesn’t believe it, because he does, and it’s not like he doesn’t understand, because
Pepper has always been a force of nature, always been a tidal wave crashing into Tony’s life, and he’s so lucky she has given him any chance at all to love her back, to be hers, to let himself be vulnerable with. She has given him so much. And he knows it. He doesn’t take it for granted, at all. But he knows her, as she knows him, and they both know each other far too well to pretend this is about anything other than what it truly is. Just like Tony can’t stand the thought of not acting and not helping when he
Self-conscious, feeling the pinprick stinging of shame burning hot on his neck, Tony looks over Pepper to look for Nebula, only to see her gone and, after a quick sweep over the room with wide eyes, nowhere to be found.
” Natasha says, outraged, as if she is ready to attack; When her body freezes and her eyes go wide with realization, and she looks at Steve without actually seeing him, her mind trapped in a distant memory. “That’s why you don’t have it. Your shield. You left it there.”
He knows it is. He knew it would be, he always knew. He should’ve done something when he had the chance. He doesn’t know what, he can’t even think, he can only quiver and shake and wait until his body finally gives out. Until the pain in his chest becomes too much and his heart seizes painfully, beating too fast and too loud, too dangerous, too old, and it finally, finally finishes him off. Tony always knew it could happen. He always knew, even after so many procedures to lessen the odds, after so many years forcing himself to take care of his health to try and stop it – ever since the beginning, ever since Afghanistan, he knew there would be a day his heart wouldn’t take it. It was already scarred. It was already fated to failure.
Tony looks at him, and Rogers looks back, and Tony thinks he might actually have stopped breathing for a moment. His entire body goes stiff as stone, a sharp lightning of
I said wives, kids, and daddy issues, didn't I? Then let us discuss a character that encompasses all three, in so many layers of twisted feelings and bad characterization that we will have to literally save him from MCU's clutches, because the only way to make things right is to do so. It won't be easy, and it won't be pleasant. It'll be ugly, and raw, and freaking exhausting. And we're gonna do it anyway, because someone needs to, and it might as well be us.
“It’s still our best bet.” Tony insists, gently. “Why bet two billion chips when you could just bet one and take the same prize?”
Tony starts closing in slowly, feet first, lowering himself with a cautioned trajectory so he can look around while he moves.
“I wasn’t planning on getting stabbed.” Tony exasperatedly exclaims, not really answering the question.
“So are you.” Bruce points out, in a strange mixture of pure fact and nervous admittance. “Tony, we’ve got no time. We have to move.”
Maybe, if they can’t find a way to fix it – they are all going to lose. This time, with no coming back.

are similar – when two points are close enough in the branches of Yggdrasil, they can be crossed faster. Just like Jane could cross between Midgard and Svartalfheim.”
He starts to worry. Really worry. Her silence is not unusual, and the gentleness of her touch and the way she keeps close – none of it speaks of impending doom, and
“Yeah, about that…” Tony says, awkwardly, but then, he can’t follow through. What would he say? What could he possibly say?
She asks, anguished, unsure of what she should be feeling about this. It’s the first time in a very long while Howard has even acknowledged Anthony, it’s been so long since they’ve had a conversation about it, and Howard’s
Steve is a man who drives himself forward through sheer will and strength, by the raw, burning desire to right the wrongs and help those who have no one else. This kind of drive is not quiet, is not easy – it is hot and it is explosive, fueled by feelings that sometimes border too close on anger, by unconformity and insolence, the refusal to any sort of surrender in face of the enemy. How did they not see it? Did they not see it in the slouch in his posture, the weight on his shoulders, the weariness in his eyes? The beard on his face? Steve is using it to hide from the world as much as he is using it to hide from himself, because he looks at a mirror in the mornings and he feels
“Mr. Stark, how are things up there?” Carter replies, delightfully professional and not at all taken aback. If anything is wrong, it's the way she sounds breathless, as if she’d been running right before opening her mouth.
“I do.” Tony assures, but he’s quick to add, “But I’m sort of starving here. I skipped lunch, actually, so I could
“Follow me.” Wong says, curt and direct, and with less than a second for them to process his sudden change of heart, he gives a quick nod and turns around, walking into the Sanctum before making sure any of them is following.
A whole new different type of hollow; Not the kind he felt before when he first woke up, when all he could feel was that sour, vile sensation of abandonment, of a missed chance, of being left behind—
“Whatever, just make it quick!” Tony yells back, and in the last second, the helmet closes itself around his head, HUD blinking into existence immediately, and he throws his arms up and lets himself fall.
“Tony and I… We haven’t had the best relationship possible, T’Challa. I admit.” Steve confesses lowly. “But I haven’t given up on it. I

Rhodey and Bruce watch him quietly, their mouths twisting in uncertainty, and Tony can’t stand to be here and watch them agonize over it when the roar of emotions and adrenaline are wreaking havoc inside his bruised ribs, with the scorching fire of vengeance and the wallow of hurt crying in echoes inside his mind, when he should be

is what snaps him back to the memory, the sour taste of it blooming back in his tongue, the bitterness associated with it coming back all at once.

And then he hears it – coming down the hall, the familiar sound of low-heel boots approaching, in the exact cadence and weight he’s grown used to hear during these last few months, a tone he forced himself to know by heart, even if it was just to stop himself from rushing into action every time someone approached their hideouts.
? With the way he takes disappointment to the heart, wears it on his face with no qualms or attempts to ease the blow on those he inflicts it on, whether a friend or an enemy? With the way he— He has relied only on himself for almost his entire life, and he’s so damned afraid of repeating the agony that was caused by Bucky’s apparent death that doesn’t allow anyone to come as close to his heart as he should?
“No.” she says, and her voice betrays nothing, but Steve knows now; that with Natasha, no reaction is a reaction in itself. She’s guarded. She’s wounded, somehow. “I can’t stay. It’s not safe. I’m a Russian spy, first and foremost, and I will always be. My position is very fragile even with Tony backing me up. It’s not really the time to take risky chances like that.”
“Well, it clearly didn’t work out, did it?” Rhodey snaps, irritable – and Tony can see his nerves fraying at the edges by his posture, by the strong lines of his veins in his forearms, tight as he crosses them over his chest, a gesture that is so obviously an attempt to protect himself that it makes a hot, stinging desperation to
Tony pulls his hands away, turning to face Rogers with a baffled stare, but Rogers is staring straight ahead, and paying no mind to anyone else in the room.
There’s a click, and a rustle, and suddenly, a voice – male, hoarse, definitely not one of theirs – screams into the comms:
“No, no.” Thor insists, and they all politely ignore how gruff his voice sounds, far more than normal. “We should continue. We have the gauntlet, there’s no reason to waste any time.”
“You will – Okay, but – And what’s gonna happen to them, Tony? What are you going to do about Steve?”
“Some of them are from R&D and tech, too.” Agent Ross informs him. “Perhaps you’d know what’s the best priority for those guys, while we work on the field.”
“You can’t know that for sure.” Wong cryptically says, and Tony actually shivers as an unpleasant feeling of
“From the Raft, yes. I know.” Rhodey insists. “But in Leipzig. Did you help them escape and then they just
“I’d like to send her a message alone.” He says, solemn. “If you can get the comm to work, I’ll do it.”
Tony had never questioned Nebula’s resolve to hunt Thanos, nor her reasons – how could he, when the very essence of her inspires his trust in the weirdest of ways, and her demeanor is so transparent, so honest and determined that Tony feels like he has no choice but believe the words she says? Maybe Tony should know better, but he doesn’t, not really, does he? But he won’t deny it’s oddly comforting to know what’s on her mind, what is keeping her here, though murderous desire for revenge would have been more than enough for Tony, at this point. But it’s… nice, if he can call it that, to find in her rage some sort of echo of his own, to discover that their purpose is not that far off from one another, and maybe, just maybe, even if the others leave, these two can stay and they might be able to do some good together.
Ms. Carter turns her body in his direction, facing him, speaking in a very serious and considerate tone. “I am not an engineer, Mr. Jarvis. I am a federal agent. There isn’t much I can teach him.”

the bias in the reporters’ words, some very openly condemning Tony’s team or Steve’s team, calling Scott brave or a menace, pushing and pulling in different directions so intensely they can’t really tell what’s going on. He can’t trust any of those words. All he can do is wait for the final verdict, and wish with all his might that the outcome will be a good one.
Cap takes an oddly long time to answer, almost long enough for Tony to get antsy, but he eventually replies, “It’s going fine. I’m gonna talk to them, see if I can work this out.”

“Hey.” Tony calls softly, bringing his head closer to hers, because his heart aches when he sees her like this, and he can’t simply sit by and watch as her expression shifts into agony.

He has no idea what time it is. When the world is too dark, any ray of light that goes out feels like the entire sun – and when it’s too cold, it could be midday and it would still feel like the deepest hours of the night. The coldest nights in Tony’s life were the nights in Afghanistan, the desert empty and vast, bathed in darkness, the humid walls of the cave so chilly and the dirt and sand beneath his feet so solid and unforgiving it could almost pass off as concrete instead. Tony had been attached to a damned car battery and he had never felt so cold. The waterboarding had made everything even worse, because they left him soaking wet after, hair, skin, and clothes, and it’s a wonder Tony didn’t die of hypothermia even with the small fire they had to keep themselves warm.

Tony pulls the regeneration machine closer to the bed while Bruce gathers some antiseptic, needles, and the activation components to the table beside it, and he does; Suddenly, they are together in the same space again, and Tony makes the mistake of looking Bruce right in the eyes – and in them, the nervousness isn’t gone at all, and the proximity and the eye contact make Bruce bold again, gives him strength, and before Tony can find a distraction, he is cornered.
Howard tells her Tony has the ability to learn. Something about pattern recognition and automatic protocol input, big words and technical jargon he knows Maria couldn’t care less about. The technicalities are irrelevant to her. But the idea that Tony can learn like a normal child would is brilliant, exciting really, and Maria takes time to sit down in front of the computer and explore the possibilities of interaction Howard has set up for her, just like any other mother would, eager to see what her son has learned during the time they were apart.
“Honest mistake.” Tony tries to abate the aura of mistrust floating in the air by making his voice extra irreverent, placing a hand on Rhodey’s shoulder in a silent request for him to ease off a little. “Are you okay?”
So, actually, let me ask you a question. Do you mind if the chapters are this long, between 9-11k? That seems to be the pattern I'm falling into this time around. Let me know if you find it too much - or if you're a monster like myself, that reads 50k chapters and doesn't give a shit. This is a very long and very mentally exhausting story, so I want to make this experience comfortable for you. Let me know what you think.
If he weren’t so tense, Jarvis might have chuckled. “Well, that certainly eases all of my fears. Thank you for the reassurance.”
“Wanda.” He breathes, and it’ll never cease to be surprising the way he sounds so human when he says her name, and even more surprising and tender is the way he holds her hand and
, directly and clearly, eyes unblinking. He knows what he’s doing, and Tony’s trapped under his stare. Trapped under his stupid, ridiculous honesty. “Sorry for all that’s happened. If I refused to listen. We fucked up. But I really wanna make this right. And there’s no one I’d trust most to do this with than all of you.”
I really don’t see what she saw in that idiot, but it was either him or the tree, I suppose.” Nebula ponders, missing the
on him, on his will and motivation, and God knows that is shaky and a little unsure even at the best of days.
What does a hero fight for? Noble things, surely. Integrity. Dignity. Justice. It's not good publicity to be a hero with selfish reasons, is it?
“I don’t know.” Steve exhales shakily. “I so was focused in getting Bucky back, I never thought about what would happen after I did. It had never even occurred to me that Bucky and Tony might meet someday. I’ve been looking for him by myself, only with Sam’s help sometimes, and Tony wasn’t even at the Compound anymore… They were two parts of my life I never thought would meet.”
Tony feels more than hears Pepper’s sharp inhale, her hand tightening on his shoulder, pinching in a strong, almost painful manner.
Nebula stares at him, divided, her face distorted in a hesitant frown, and Tony can’t wait for her answer and so he leans forward, ignoring how hard it is to do so with his abdomen immobilized, gripping the rails on the side of the bed with such force that his fingers turn white.
To his utter surprise, Thor swings his axe behind his backs and sheaths it at a hidden holder beneath his cape, freeing his hands – and to Tony, that is absolutely insane, because he has never seen Thor go into a fight, into
. Tony has never fought alongside Carter or Ross, and even if he doesn’t doubt that they are skillful in what they do – whatever it is that they do – it’s… difficult to think that not only he will have to work again with the team that has long ago lost all the trust it had in its own, but also with these two people he has never exchanged more than a couple of words with. Not that he can’t do it, he can, he is
It’s not just this once, is it? It’s every time. Every time, every time something happens, the mere inkling of fear that it could be the last has Tony moving faster than Pepper’s hands can hold him, beyond all limits or regards, to protect other lives despite his own. And she will always worry. When he’s fighting, she’ll worry he won’t come home, and if he’s home, she’ll always worry when he’ll be fighting next. Even if he says he won’t. Can he really make that promise?
“Do you even feel cold?” Tony stupidly asks, mind going fuzzy, and his tongue suddenly feeling very, very loose. It’s never a good sign. Tony knows he gets very chatty when he’s about to lose consciousness. Rhodey has complained about it many, many times – no, no,
, about this Steve Rogers that’s mellow and shy, that’s vulnerable only when they’re alone, when they trade whispers and secrets and kisses in the dark–
AoU is a shitty movie. A real bad movie. But also - AoU is a goldmine, if you know what to look for.
Be honest with me for a second: how many people have you seen mention the dust as a major problem in the aftermath of the snap? I've seen people mention the accidents. The food rationing. The riots. The anarchy. But the dust? Not a single person. And that called my attention - because at first, I thought the dust was simply a matter of special effects to make it visually heartbreaking; but then, after they were totally gone, the dust is gone as well, right? Wrong. I went back and rewatched IW just for the sake of this detail, and guess what? The dust doesn't vanish. It seems like it does, because nearly everyone that gets killed by it has their ashes blown by the wind, for dramatic effect.
But… But he guesses that, the same way Steve feels like Bucky’s fall is his fault, Bucky must feel like all of those things are his fault. Steve won’t pretend to know anything about the intricate connections and specifications of the human mind, he is no scientist or scholar, but if there’s one thing he
“Stars are very dangerous things to live close to.” Tony arguments, emphasizing his argument with small taps at the top of the table with the side of his hand, like he’s slicing a cake or something – but the movement grounds him, forces attention on his words. “It’s not something you would do unless you need something very specific from that star. Ultraviolet travels fine for medium distances. Why would they be so
“After we gather some information about what’s happening out there first-hand, we bring samples and start working on a solution for this. Tell me what you need to make some tests, and I’ll pick it all up when I can so we can start this as soon as possible.”
He’s not exactly furious at Natasha, but it doesn’t stop him from feeling his blood boil hotter every second he passes without finding her. He knows, somewhere deep in mind, that this is not her fault. It is not a matter of fault. Things are just… Things are happening and it’s too much, it’s always too much, and he’s once again being proven how
under his breath, looking mussed and tired, barefoot and in old clothes, and it’s a jarring contrast to the last time Steve saw him, in a suit and expensive cologne and watch, untouchable by the world.
“It sounded like him.” Nebula whispers, out of nowhere, and the dead certainty in her voice makes Tony shudder. “Your robot. It
“No!” Bruce scrambles for a better wording. “Just a sample. Maybe some tests. But we need you to be here.”
“Angrier and meaner by the minute, thank you for asking.” Tony replies, a little more hysterically than he’d like to admit. “We have anyone in there?”
Tony the mere idea that this might put another mistake on that list, maybe even dethrone the entire mess of 2015, and isn’t that all of Tony’s nightmares transformed into reality – losing the respect and the alliance of one of the very few people that he still has from, in the middle of the biggest crisis they’ve ever faced?
before you are ready.” Clint says firmly. “This shit won’t last forever. Make sure to remember that. You’ll be back home soon enough.”
“Wow, say what you’re really thinking, Nat, don’t mind me.” Barton jabs, but Natasha only shrugs and turns back, though her eyes remain clouded, like her focus is far away.
, and he allows his head to fall back and rest against the cold cot under him, blinking away the tears that wallow in his eyes in a far too vulnerable discharge of adrenaline.
But it is… beautiful. Powerful. Tony can tell, just by looking at it. The handle is wood, pure wood, which is unexpected considering how heavy the head must be, but it’s long and sturdy, reliable. Tony kind of wants to run his hand across it, but he doesn’t. The wood is woven between what seems to be two halves of the head of the weapon, bringing them together, and the back and the blade are both made of some shiny, silver, absolutely impeccable material, with elegant ridges and lines, and just a faint marking of something designed across the metal, like Thor’s hammer used to have on its sides and around the edges.
, Rogers, Romanov, all of them, even Rhodey. Rhodey, the only face he has the slightest hope to accurately read amidst this chaos, whose features are clouded in concern, but not raging, angry concern – just concern, and Tony wishes he wasn’t so well acquainted with the expression to know the difference.
Her projection is almost as large as JARVIS was when displayed in open space, but on the screen, she looks tiny, a fragile little thing. If Tony didn’t know any better, he would say she’s shy. But no. She’s never been shy about anything, but she is hesitant. Brave, his baby girl, but still learning. Still young. “Ultron was different because it was meant to interfere in outside problems without inside initial order, but that’s why it was still on the board and not out there. Too many variables.”
“You have pretty good aim.” He comments, stopping only for a few seconds between one throw and the other, the shield ricocheting back to his hand in a perfect trajectory.
Sam wipes off the powdered sugar from his fingers, inclining forward in his chair so he can participate in the conversation. “Your hair is already longer than it ever was. How long has it been since you last cut it? Four months? Five?”
Tony is not sure how exactly those words sound when they leave his mouth, but from the look on Rogers’ face, it probably doesn’t sound like he thinks they did. Rogers’ neck goes back a little, his eyes going hard and his mouth twisting in what looks like a very painful grind of his teeth, so quick that Tony can’t even feel his defensive instincts kick in before Rogers’ expression goes a little slack again, covered in a muted sadness that Tony can see from the crease of his eyebrows, before he says:
normal. He’s defensive, and an over-sharer, and he’s wary, and insecure, and this conversation still brings a lump to his throat he cannot swallow or spit out no matter how hard he tries, and if he can’t dealt with it in any other way, he’ll
Rhodey. His dear Rhodey – all military righteousness and just a genuinely good heart, hurting for not being able to fulfill his duty, unable to
All this time, all of this, and Natasha has nothing that proves to her that Bucky is the person Steve says he is.
You don’t walk behind someone playing pool if they don’t know you’re there. Because if you do, you might get hit with a pool bat on the stomach when they wind up for a shot.
He gets up and looks down at himself again, trying to assess his own physical state, what sort of procedure he probably went through and how his recovery is going. He shouldn’t be walking, he knows that much, but since staying here is not an option, he will simply ignore that concern entirely. Other than that, his bandages seem to be in very nice condition, white and clean, and although there is pain, it’s not unbearable. It’s a surprise, considering how ugly the wound was. Far better than he was hoping to feel. They gave him the good stuff, it seems. He has no doubt one of the IV’s he just pulled off his arm contained morphine, even if just a small amount, by the gentle drowsiness enveloping his mind.
“What about the plan?” She asks, her voice neutral. It’s not much different from the tone she uses when they casually discuss work when they get home, as a mere recollection of the facts of the day, common curiosity and interest. No malice in it.
It was all that it came down to, isn’t it? Steve’s version, Tony’s version, they all had different ideas of what they should do to make things right after they made a mistake. Steve will no longer argue about the Accords, but he will argue about this, because
, the urges to push forward and scoot back battling inside him, his heart so scared, so foolish, so worried for what is about to happen.
“Why are you fighting me on this!?” Steve growls, pained and infuriated, having to physically fight the urge to grab his own hair and tug at it, like a maniac, trying to ease the terrible, awful sensation he’s feeling in his head, like a swarm of wasps buzzing non-stop in his brain, slowly driving him insane.
” The man makes an unnecessary pause, too pleased with himself. “are looking for anything related to Karpov. Who he works for, who he works with, where he’s hiding and most importantly: What did he make the Winter Soldier kill Howard Stark for.”
“Is there a ship we can use?” They ask, probably assessing, just as Tony has, that the ship is beyond salvation, even for him.
we put them both back in the same room. Imagine Tony, who will be more vulnerable than ever, face to face with a man who inspires so many conflicting emotions inside of him, after experiencing the most traumatic event of his life. It's going be a wild ride, folks. I can't wait to get started.
“Banner has seven PhD’s.” Thor smiles. “Such knowledge will surely be helpful when devising our strategy to defeat the enemy.”
“We’re gonna leave you with it and we’re gonna let the agents know you’re here, if you decide to leave, you call them, and you let them know. Or if you need anything, let them know.”
“You think I’m blind?” Sam scoffs. “You don’t eat. You’re looking like a freaking caveman or some shit like that, using a
Natasha swallows dry. “S’not like we can wait.” She grumbles, nodding to herself. “This is bigger than all of us.”
“Wait here.” He tells them before he even knows what he’s doing, pushing the counter away to gain momentum to make sure his legs are
It's very heartwarming and rewarding to see a team fight together again when they've just had a nostalgic, welcoming reunion, surely - but that is not the case here, is it? I feel like we need to talk a little bit about that.
He waves at her, politely, and doesn’t move besides that because he really doesn’t know what to do. As soon as she’s out of his sight, his hand drops awkwardly, a slow and unsure movement, until his arm is limp at his side, feeling suddenly twice as heavy. In fact, his
“Do we?” He asks, desolately, fearfully wishing his worst fears are just that – fears, and not actually what is happing. That he might be getting too ahead of himself, that it could be
“I am tired of running away.” She confesses, when she realizes Steve won’t say anything to rebuke her argument. “Because no matter how hard I try, I can’t escape myself. I have to deal with it. And the things I did.”
“Natasha. You know I’m right. The Accords were created to manipulate us into acting as weapons. The reason why we work is because we have no government telling us what to do. What would we do when someone ordered us to attack an innocent group of people, under false pretense? It would have happened.”
, to remind the world that it can be better and it can be improved and he’ll do all he can to make it happen.
“That’s weird.” Bruce comments, scratching his neck. “We have found almost every element out there – if not
“You really think this is about me. You really think, even now, that I’m doing this out of some secret evil plan.”
“Wait, Mr. Stark, hold on! Please!” Lang says loudly, getting up from his seat in a jolt. “I want brains too. I mean – I wanna help with whatever you need to find this guy and reverse this, too. I’d be happy to help with the agents, sure—"
Nebula brushes a hand on Rocket’s shoulder, a touch so soft it only barely ruffles the fur, and ushers him forward so they both step closer, entering their circle around the gauntlet, all of them staring at it warily.
“I don’t know.” Lang shakes his head robotically, his gaze lost. “Maybe? I don’t know. I honestly don’t know what to think.”
The reporter, a woman who looks almost as disheveled as they do, keeps talking over the moving images of three men leaving a courthouse in slow, steady steps, surrounded by a cacophony of screams and flashes and people, so maddening it’s almost impossible to watch. She goes on about what the Accords are and what kind of problems have arisen over their existence since they were first presented, including the attack in Vienna by Helmut Zemo and –
“You have used the power of the Mind Stone before.” Thor whispers, intensely. “You know how to access it. If you can find a way to recreate it, like you did with the Tesseract, and like the Sorcerers in the Sanctum do with the artifacts they use – we could go to battle with items capable of diverting the powers of the Stones—”
“I always had the team backing me up.” Steve says, but even to himself, it sounds like a hollow excuse.
A haze of smoke swirls above their heads, moving along the air of the turbines like a whip, and even with the protection of the armor and the aid of his scans, he can’t see more than a few feet beyond the opening of the ramp.
Tony can scarcely remember what she’s talking about, they’ve never been in a mission in Seoul – and then he remembers that he
Loki – shit, Loki probably didn’t survive, did he? Thor staring at his picture like he’s trying to drink in the sight of him, like he has to absorb every detail before the picture is taken away, as if that would take his brother away forever; That’s not… No one does that.
He knows it’s bad. He knows – he knows. He promised to tap out and he didn’t. He promised to stay away and he couldn’t. He knows. He’s sorry. He said that. And he can promise he’ll never do it again – but he can’t, because he’s doing it right now, every day –, he can promise it’ll be the last time – but he won’t, because he can’t know for sure. Every time she thinks it’ll be the last, and it never is. Every time, he says he’ll stop, but he never does.
Steve shakes his head nervously, closing his eyes for a second, trying to push away the voices of both Tony and Natasha who whisper in his ears, like devils perched on his shoulders.
“It’s not, and it doesn’t give me the right to act like you’re dangerous when we know you’re not.” Rhodey counters. “My bad.”

be arriving with Rhodey, and Tony will have to deal with them despite being totally unprepared for it.
“She can’t stand me fighting. She can’t.” Tony explains, looking down to the Gauntlet so he won’t have to look at Thor. “And she was right, when she said this was dangerous. We don’t even know if we’re gonna make it to Thanos, much less if we’re gonna get out alive from
“These are not just decorations.” Thor explains, looking up to them with dead certainty in his eyes, motioning to the ring with a small motion of his hand. “These are spells, like the ones on my hammer, and in Stormbreaker. Meant to harness energy from the very essence of the universe, and use it to produce power.”
“Thanos kidnaps children from the planets he destroys, and forces people to join his cause.” Nebula spits furiously. “He collects them, like
of it. It has been a pleasure diving into Steve's mind and learning more about it, making connections and plotting what I feel like is a pretty realistic character development for him, and hopefully you have felt the same.
“Remember when I said the rain could be contaminated?” Bruce reminds them, but even that conversation seems like it was forever ago, time stretching like unwound coil in a world that knows no light, hours blending together to a smudgy gray. “There’s all sorts of particles in the water now, the rain is going to bring them all back down and into the soil. I don’t know how it’s gonna affect the pH, but I have to assume that it
the feelings and things that make you feel ashamed – but since Bruce insists so much that Hulk is another person, isn’t a good strategy to treat him as ally, not as a beast to set loose when needed, while still fearing it?
“Schmidt found the Tesseract in Norway in 1942.” Rogers says, his arms crossed, his brow furrowed in concentration. “He and Zola used the power in it to make weapons to HYDRA.”
Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha, and Rogers, all of them are standing up and stiff in their places, and Tony almost panics before they notice him and Bruce on the doorway, immediately jumping to the worst possible conclusions, when he realizes they aren’t scared, they’re
They sit in silence, for a while. But no time in the world will be enough for Steve to steel himself for the conversation that sure is to follow.
“No.” Tony says out loud, without even meaning to, pacing around like a madman. “No, no. No. This can’t happen.”
“It’s gonna rain.” Bruce says, sort of to himself, but also loud enough for everyone to hear him, certainly loud enough for everyone to stop in their tracks and turn back to stare at him where he stopped, by the door, as if his feet didn’t have enough strength to move him any further. “We weren’t accounting for rain yet.”
And then, only when he’s leaning down, only when this angle allows him to look under the SUV directly in front of him, blocking the street—
You cannot imagine how hard it was to stop myself from making a "did you try turning it off and back on again" joke in there. I'm so sorry. I just had to say it.
“You shut up.” Steve says, and when Wilson and Sharon laugh, his ears go adorably pink. “Why don’t you go talk to Rhodes?”
“And?” He insists that Vision keeps going, his voice breathless, barely being able to produce a sound.
The worry in Bruce’s eyes is so clear and tangible, nearly like a physical touch, and Tony’s chest aches with how much emotion the proof of Bruce’s care for him can reach, how much he wishes he could accept it easily and let himself bask in the comfort of knowing that Bruce wants to
“Ebony Maw.” Nebula scoffs, and, if that’s any possible, her tone is even more bitter than it was before.
“I thought I was making the right call by waiting.” Steve says, but at this point is not even an explanation anymore. Nor it is an excuse, or a plea. It hurts a little, a light throb in his bruised heart, the ache after a long exhausting battle, but something
But he still feels like he’s been punched in the throat when he’s watching Tony and Rhodes argue playfully about what car Rhodes is going to borrow for his date tonight, and, all of a sudden, Rhodes
“No matter what his choice is going to be, he needs to choose. And he needs to do it alone.” She says, a bit regretful, as if she is not very happy about this either. “Your presence makes him feel obligated to act like you expect him to. Because he owes you, not because that’s how he really feels.”
“We have to consider it, Tony, if Thanos really got the Stone first, maybe Thor’s idea makes some sense. The Stone would be telling us about someone it had already met.” Bruce reminds him.
They laugh all the way to the park, they joke around while Tony grabs them a bite from the shawarma stand, they sit together by the tree and Tony even leans against his shield where Steve props it against the trunk, and both of them sort of lie down together, to avoid putting their asses on the floor and risk putting pressure on the tender bruises Bobbi was so kind to gift them with.
he wishes he could just run to Tony’s side like Rhodes and Natasha did, but the truth is that Steve can’t. He can’t.
, hard to get past him completely, all the time. But in theory, he’s an errand boy. He’s take immediate action in case of any trouble, and then he’d report to the UN and they’d make the final decision.”
The mention of Happy is like being doused in ice-cold water unexpectedly. He’s not even aware of what he said until after he said it, and when he hears the name come out of his own mouth, he’s suddenly reminded of why they’re even here in the first place.
Because honestly, Steve doesn’t feel the need to keep Scott so close by. He will give him means to contact them in case he needs to, of course, but the fact is that out of all of them, Scott is probably the one who has the most chance of getting back home. The only thing he’s done wrong so far was to fight beside them in Leipzig. He doesn’t have the threat of the Accords looming over his head because he’s not an Avenger, although Steve can’t be sure how long that will last either. So, if he so decides, he can probably go home – and Steve would be fine with it. He really would. He’s not really comfortable with the idea of making Scott follow them around because of a problem that’s not really his. He has a family back in the USA. This is not his fight. Steve appreciates the help he gave them in Germany, stalling Tony so he and Bucky could escape to Siberia, but besides that he has no real obligation to follow them around or obey Steve’s orders.
And she pats him on the shoulder, soft and gentle, a small reassurance being all she is able to give him now. Her hand lingers for a moment, hesitant, and they stare at each other for a split second before they both visibly crumble and pull closer for a hug, their breaths shaky and their bodies cold, and Steve remembers the only other time they hugged like this, right after Peggy’s funeral, and he suddenly wants to
“It won’t take long.” Nebula assures, also blatantly ignoring his deflection, all business and no-nonsense as she types in instructions on the command board, fast as lightning, giving him an odd feeling of déjà vu, of
“Yes.” FRIDAY agrees, back to her formal tone and efficient organizing. “According to footage of the War Machine armor, sixteen hours after they were already in Wakanda, preparing for battle with the aid of King T’Challa.”
Tony is still very much dedicated to his work as Iron Man and to the armor. More than Pepper would like. More than it’s healthy, probably. He didn’t… He didn’t really need the nanite compartment, biologically speaking. But he did it anyway. Because Tony needed to be
“May I see those artifacts?” Thor requests, sensibly, and Wong calmly removes what looks like a ring from his fingers, bigger than any other ring Tony has seen, to fit two fingers at once, with a weird, plain rectangular slate on top with no other jewel or adornment visible from what Tony can see.
“Of that I have no doubt. I would refuse to part ways with him if I had any other choice, but unfortunately, I do not. At least, with you, I am sure he will be safe.” Jarvis says, with absolute honesty. He has nothing to fear. Ms. Carter is someone he holds dear. She is someone he can trust. “Don’t worry. He is a quiet company. Dare I say, in due time, he might actually grow on you.”
, itches in Tony’s brain for some reason he can’t place, the nagging feeling of having something he needs to grasp that is just out of his reach.
Pepper squeezes his hand, a silent call, and when they trade looks, she discretely points at Bruce for him, just as perceptive, and Tony takes her sign as support, and turns back to the kitchen.
“What the hell are you waiting for?!” Tony yells, opening his hands and arms in an exasperated gesture, irritated beyond belief. “Why should we be standing here? We have to scare them off, that’s the only way they’ll quit! You want me to pepper spray them one by one?!”
As T’Challa affirmed, Clint’s surrender is announcement much quicker than Scott’s was. Maybe because they were ready for it, or maybe because they aren’t as surprised by the event as they were the first time around. Steve doesn’t really care about the reason why.
“I promise, I’m not trying to steal any of your Army backpay – Rhodey would never forgive me.” Tony slaps him in the back, as if trying to help with his throat, and it’s too late when he realizes his hand is shaking. “You’re here for snacks and to look pretty, Rogers.”
Maybe they should’ve talked more. Maybe Vision would have said something important then, to Tony. If Thor really is right and Tony should’ve been the one to somehow find what sort of clues Vision could’ve left behind. There’s no way of telling now.
“Did you buy him tickets to the games of his favorite team, in another state?” Clint asks, with raised eyebrows.
“Definitely.” Steve says, coy, and slowly, he looks Tony up and down, all of him, as if he’s drinking in the sight, and that look, in Steve’s blue, sharp eyes, make Tony tremble where he stands. “And this time, I might not let you leave either.”
He helps around, when he can. The armor is heavy, you know? Not that Tony is weak by any measure – but hey, if he can save himself the strain and let the super soldier do the heavy lifting, why not?
“There have been accidents, Boss. Many accidents.” FRIDAY immediately says, sounding profoundly sad. “I’ve detected over twenty-five thousand immediate casualties, in the state of New York alone. Main causes include: car crashes, heavy machinery malfunction or mishandle, destruction of buildings and plane crashes. I also have registers of three emergency alerts being sounded within areas declared as biohazardous and in seventeen institutions that handle dangerous or sensitive biological and chemical substances and materials, during the first hour after the final attack.”
“How is Rhodes?” he asks, and they all stop breathing for a moment, caught off guard by the vulnerability in Sam’s words. “Is he alright?”
“That’s stupid.” Tony says, voice emotionless, as if someone is speaking for him, manipulating his body without his permission. “Without a shield, you’re exposing yourself.”
The next morning, Tony finds Natasha eating some leftovers while watching TV, and Tony thinks it says a lot about him that he doesn’t startle or does anything that a
Steve has almost no regards for rules, despite what his Captain America persona might make people believe, because rules are restrictive, and Steve never liked to feel trapped. Even less now, after seventy years trapped inside an ice cage.
“That’s not the point.” Tony rebukes, as gently as possible. “I’m saying you don’t have to be afraid of making noise. Actually, I would
“Tony.” Bruce suddenly calls, abrupt and choked, almost like he shoves the words out before he can think better of it. “Can we talk?”
When Tony came to them in Siberia, he’d wanted to help. He said Steve was right – in his own way, always Tony’s way,
, believe nothing will go wrong and that T’Challa and Nat might be right, that the Accords might actually do some good now, after long months of revision and amendments. Even though Steve hates that they exist at all, how he regrets he wasn’t there to help them figure out a way to make this better—
At first, the idea makes Steve feel kind of bad, because it implies that Tony really was detaching himself from the others at first because of him; But then, Steve sees Tony and Clint trading jokes over breakfast and bonding over their love for action movies, he sees Tony coming up to the movie sessions more often with Bruce, he even sees Tony sharing ice cream with Thor once. Steve likes it.
“Strange… I don’t how if they told you, but—” Tony starts, awkwardly, but Wong swiftly interrupts him.
“Please tell me you didn’t go with your uniform, we don’t need no more wars between the States and Germany.”
Tony nods. There’s nothing he can say. He doesn’t even think he’d be able to speak if he had any words.
His hands shake a little with a phantom sensation of his shield vibrating on impact, and he itches beneath his skin in a way he can’t quite stop.
“Captain?” Shuri calls, and Steve startles, realizing he has been standing in front of his old suit for minutes now, just staring at it, trying hard not to think about the tears and the cuts and what exactly they meant.
“I know it didn’t always seem like it. I wasn’t always the best at saying what I meant, and getting used to it in the first years… It was tough.” Pepper says in a rush, breath harsh and winded. It sounds like it hurts her too. “But I did say things I didn’t mean, or I didn’t mean
“Add the gold-titanium alloy to the list, just in case.” Tony requests, a tiny spark of hope flaring inside him without his permission. “I’m gonna trust you on this one, baby girl.”
that’s why they’re awful, because you have to pry them open every time, it sucks the entire fuel of the ship if you’re not careful.” Rocket grumbles, dismayed.
“Heroes have not been turned into villains.” Vision says solemnly, wisely, like a leader trying to keep his followers from collapsing into despair. Steve can recognize the tone, the stance, the look; He is the one who is usually on the other side of this interaction, taking the front, trying to inspire hope even when all seems lost. He is not sure how he should react when he is the listener, not the preacher.
Tony halts mid-step, his eyes snapping up incredulously – but before Nebula can process his faltering as a sign to stop, he speeds up, half-pulling her along, his eyes darting to every new corner he turns to, his entire being thrumming with a nervous, electric energy – something that drives him forward with his legs tingly, breath shallow, single-minded purpose to reach the lounge and nothing else.
“You’re already doing far more than you should be doing, Tony.” Pepper says, and her tone does have some light reprehension to it, though it’s not meant to sting. It’s just deep, deep concern, so familiar it aches. “You should be in bed rest, because you got
They all seem to be lost in thought, when a quiet, awkward sound brings them all back to the present, all eyes turning to Wanda as she steps a little closer to Vision. She looks awkward, but determined, and she steals a glance at Vision beside her before she clears her throat gently and speaks:
. Steve’s hands dart up to grasp at the strands of his hair, so fast that the tug is harsh and painful, shooting sparks of pain all the way through his scalp and stinging hotly on his skin. He can hear Tony’s voice so clearly, echoing on the walls of the bunker, and he
Nebula’s siblings, and Tony is pretty sure he did not mistake the venom and disgust in her voice at the sight of them on FRIDAY’s camera feeds the first time around. She doesn’t like them. Maybe she hates them as much as she hates Thanos, but Tony can’t be sure. But – if he dares to assume, he doesn’t think Nebula could have had any kind feelings for her other siblings other than aversion, because those siblings are like
, he can’t deny that, in many ways, he has one – Rhodey and Pepper, no matter what their relationship is now, Tony always knew he could count on them. Happy too, he thinks with immeasurable grief. Even in his childhood, long before any of them had come into his life, despite how
Oh, God, Nat. Natasha. Natasha had been right. Of course, she had always been right. Screaming at Steve’s face that he couldn’t see past his bitterness, that he was mistrustful, that he had been a coward… Her point had been made, definitely. Steve has heard her, loud and clear. And even worse than that, he
Tony watches, frozen in his place, eyes wild and mouth forced shut like he’s trying to break his own jaw with the force which he presses his teeth together, lips tight, trying to hold back any pitiful sounds that might threaten to escape in a sobbing breath. His head pounds with a terribly familiar sensation of holding back tears when he looks closer, and realizes that even in the fast-paced rewind FRIDAY is making, he can make out the flowy movement of Strange’s sentient cape, and the gray, bulky blur he sees on the corner when the camera shifts is most definitely Drax.
Wanda… Wanda is a little more complicated. Vision is actually leaving back to the US along with Clint, because he has already been gone for far too long for it to be unnoticeable, so he needs to head back and make sure no one has noticed his absence. In the meanwhile, Wanda will go ahead and catch a flight to Zurich, using the all the fake id’s and cash they had given her. She’ll go alone, and Steve has to keep reminding himself that it’s not a bad idea, she knows what she’s doing, she’ll be
“Funny how you only mention the three of you.” Tony sneers, squinting as if he’s genuinely curious, but the expression is all mockery. “I’m not naming names, but since you take it upon yourself—"
T’Challa considers him for a moment, head tilted curiously and one of his eyebrows slightly arched, but not without giving off a feeling of elegance that Steve has no idea how T’Challa manages to exude at every single second of the day.
He feels frozen in place. He can’t look away from Natasha. He can’t look away from her the same way he couldn’t look away from the explosion in Lagos, when the dread and the horror made the ground beneath him disappear and all of his thoughts dissolve into smoke. The terror of realizing that he has just destroyed something, something he was trying to protect, and it is his
“I thought you guys were having a…” He flails, making a weird, exasperated expression, and Tony knows what he means, and decides to spare him the struggle.
Tony missed him, when he moved to the West Coast. He didn’t want to stop talking to Steve, it just happened. Steve had always been amazing. And gorgeous. And Tony liked him, a lot. Of course he missed him.

“With our resources and FRIDAY they should be able to work on something while you all are out there.” Pepper amends.
Huh. Weird. They make a face at Bruce, but Bruce only shakes his head, somehow embarrassed, and gestures a dismissal with his hand.
“I assure you all I have no intentions of causing you distress.” Vision assures them, after a moment. “I am not here as an enemy. I am here as a friend— if I may still be considered that by you.”
“Be safe, kiddo.” Clint tells Wanda before he leaves, with a kind smirk on his face. “I’ll make sure he gets home in one piece.”
“What?” Rhodey asks, frowning, when Tony doesn’t react. The posture slips a little, his shoulders slouch.
Rogers throws her a look so angry and annoyed it’s shocking how little she reacts. Natasha merely turns slight around, just enough that she can look Tony in the eyes over her shoulder, and, with surprising caution, she says:
“Alright. Okay. Let’s consider this, then.” Tony says, raising a hand in a placating gesture, hoping to convey to Thor that he’s at least willing to
And the guilt of thinking he has done something terrible to Steve. As if it’s his fault that Steve is here, a fugitive, as if he had no other choice. That’s not true. Steve

“No need to be jealous, man.” Sam murmurs behind his coffee cup, smiling. “I’m not going down that road, I know better than to mess with the Black Widow.”
“Yeah, that one.” Tony clears his throat. “Sarah must have been really proud. How is she, by the way?”
Oh, God, he’s gonna fry every single of those people. If he uses the full strength of a thunder strike, they won’t even know what hit them.
She shrugs. “Not like you’re going to do anything about it.” And then she grabs a cookie and hands it to Sam, who leans back in his chair and enjoys his stolen offering with a smug smirk on his face.

“Oh, I’m not worried.” Steve’s eyes shine again with that spark of mirth, and Tony, running on barely any sleep and a rush of endorphins that has

Next chapter, we discuss some more plot, and for our next candidates in the emotional turmoil series, we have Thor and Scott. And the very beginnings of the second long emotional discussion we need to have - out of three. The clock is ticking, friends. Let's pick up the pace.
“Mr. Stark! Hi! Can you please—” The voice says, agitated, and very loud, as if they’re afraid they might not be heard. Which, considering Nebula is threatening murder, is an acceptable reaction. “I’m not – I don’t know if you remember me – this is Scott? Scott Lang? Ant-Man?”
Suddenly, without prompting, the sound of a rapidly approaching repulsor blast makes them all turn to the door, and in no more than a second, the 1-R armor comes flying quickly towards them, making almost all of them jump back in alert, surprised.
“Yes, animals and plants too, I’ve heard about it. FRIDAY filled me in.” Tony interrupts, feeling a little breathless. “How did
He brings it home. Puts in the west wing study, the one which has been mostly empty for the last few years, forgotten when Maria’s plans to build a study for Anthony fell through. He makes sure no one will see him arrive. In a couple of hours, he rearranges the house’s electrical circuits, makes sure the whole thing is safe and absolutely impenetrable, and builds it back up around the centerpiece. The star of the show.
“I retracted it, but it moved awkwardly.” Tony confesses. “It froze when the blade went through it. It shouldn’t have done that. It was also trying to rearrange itself because it was losing particles too fast and I had to keep shifting it so it wouldn’t leave me exposed. It’s toast. If I try to put it on, the particles inside me might shift and—”
“Strange also had one.” Bruce informs them. “The thing he wore. His necklace, or whatever that was. It was a container for the Stone, the Time Stone.”
He knew. Clint knew it too, and he had insisted that Steve should take the bed, and he would have the couch, it would be fine for just one night. But Steve declined. He declined because he wouldn’t take away Clint’s comfort when he knew he wouldn’t sleep, his body too high strung with the anxiety he awakened during the day, his mind way too busy, his thoughts way too loud for him to be allowed the blissful quiet of unconsciousness, even for a few minutes. Like a soldier, like this character of the
“I know.” Bruce hums. “But maybe, if you’d tone it down a little, people wouldn’t notice it as much.”
Natasha finally glances at him, her stare sharp as her knives, practically dissecting him right where he stands. “That’s what you’re waiting for? For him to call and ask you for us to fight in his place?”
Foolishly, he thought someday everyone would come around and realize they were wrong. That Steve only wanted to do the right thing, and they would understand, and all this mess could be left behind, and they would all start over.
Rhodey’s hands find his arms, closing in around his biceps with all that military strength, secure and warm and protective, and his grip says everything Rhodey never had much ability to put into proper words.
, as unpracticed and tentative as it may be, only the look in her face giving away the game, because her voice is a flat and unamused as always, the perfect dry tone for her. “Maybe I should tell your stupid friends when they come back.”
Tony exhales exasperatedly and shakes his head, and leaves before he says something that will get him killed.
He turns around. Stupidly, because it allows his visitor to see his red face and eyes puffy with tears.
“Argh! Stark!” Clint yells too, dodging the trash quickly, and not even bothering to be subtle when he can literally look across the street and give Tony a disgruntled face.
That answer doesn’t reassure Bruce as Tony expected it would. In fact, it seems to make him more nervous.
“He took half of everything.” Tony mutters, hauntingly, needing desperately to put it all out before all the words got caught in his throat and choked him. “Plants, animals,
“Yeah, you never are.” Steve chuckles darkly, and the sound is like nails on a chalkboard in his own ears. “But that’s too bad, because we’re not delaying this anymore. I want you to tell me what’s going on.”
“I wish you luck on your wait, my friend.” T’Challa graciously offers. “And when the time comes, I also wish you strength to fight for what you need.”
“I wouldn’t force him into anything.” Steve grumbles, just because he can’t stay quiet about this, his voice as sharp as steel.
It’s been only a couple of days, and Tony already misses him something awful. He groans, and somehow Steve, with his stupid Tony-sense (something he surely learned from Rhodey), knows Tony is being whiny and mopey (Rhodey’s words, not his). He
Children of Thanos, he called them, as if they were precious, as if being under his charge was something to be proud of, something
“Since space and time are linked, Time is relative.” Bruce points out. “If an object – let’s say a planet – distorts Space in a certain way, it’s movement and it’s relationship with everything around it changes, and that includes its effect on Time. It’s how you get Time Dilation and all sorts of Time-related issues in physics. That’s why Einstein figured wormholes would be the way to figure out time-travel, because they’re so extreme that they way gravity acts around them is different than usual. The only other options are blackholes and certain kinds of stars, but none of them seem to act as a
Not that they actually study much, because twenty minutes in Tony starts joking in that weirdly endearing, flirty way he always does, and Steve, for once, is feeling so elated that he actually
Vision takes in all of their reactions, one by one, and although his face remains impassive, the gears in his head turn furiously as he does so, and Steve can’t even begin to imagine what sort of conclusion he is able to draw from that.
“Get over here, C-3PO.” He calls, beckoning her closer with a lazy gesture of his hand. “We have all the time in the world.”
Half-broken, ripped apart, crumbling in a rain of concrete, stone and iron, only the ruins of a world that Tony once so fiercely loved.
on it. People call him egotistic and reckless and unrestrained – but who the fuck is saying the same about Steve Rogers, about the rest of them, who are all so ready to do whatever Rogers tells them to without a second thought, when Rogers is just as bad, just as egotistic, just as arrogant, and they all are, but somehow, Tony is
Not like it matters right now, but Tony is curious. And to be very honest, Tony is kind of concerned for Nebula.
“If I can find the Sanctuary, I can find Thanos. I know the original coordinates, but the ship might not be there anymore. If I could go there—” Nebula slowly falls quiet, thinking.
Rogers has not touched him since Siberia. Tony doesn’t know why this is the thing he focus on, but it is.
So, Howard searches, but Peggy moves on. They create S.H.I.E.L.D. She fights for civil rights, she flourishes even when the whole world tries to hold her back, and God have mercy on those who try to stand in her way. She is a force to be reckoned with and she knows, somewhere deep inside, that Steve would be proud. It’s enough comfort for her.
They all pause uncomfortably, unsure of what to say, when Clint suddenly takes the initiative and clears his throat to reply, “Yeah, sure. Go ahead.”
“We do.” Rhodey replies, and the pure, so profound agony in his dark eyes feels like a physical blow into Tony’s chest, and he wants to reach out, wants to hug him, wants to help him, but it’s useless.
happen – but at this point, resistance is simply going to make things worse, not better. It’ll pay off to risk it, at least more than it will avoid it.
“It seems like you have been injured with a sharp object, like a spear, and it has hit your stomach and grazed your intestine – which caused internal bleeding and several other complications, including leakage of gastrointestinal fluids, which increases the chance of peritonitis. You apparently went through an aggressive surgery and should,
Natasha scoffs, throwing him a knowing look. “You like danger, Rogers. It keeps you on your toes. You wouldn’t have it any other way.”
He needs his workshop a little emptier. He needs his thoughts not to be so scattered, so filled with white noise, to focus only on the information on the board and nothing else.
skilled on talking to strangers, which really doesn’t help the situation at all, but even so, something inside him still holds a little twinge of an evil humor, and enjoys, half proudly, half mischievously, how Bruce struggles not to flush out of embarrassment as Lang stares wide-eyed at him.
, and he closes the door behind him although he still feels like he’s being watched despite them both being alone. None of the others have followed him. No one had said a word. Tony is here exposing himself to Pepper, because he has to, because he’ll hurt her and he’ll let her hurt him back, he’ll accept the trading of blows without complaint because he knows he deserves it, and he will not try to stop it.
Ultron says, and with the sound of a distant explosion, the audio suddenly cuts off, and the workshop is drowned in tense silence.
Steve needs to talk about it. Isn’t it ridiculous? Isn’t it just the most idiotic thing he’s ever done? Steve has avoided this for so long, his revelation, this
“I’m afraid not.” T’Challa sighs. “I might be a strong ally for the Sokovia Accords, Captain, but unfortunately, I have little say on the legal matters of Mr. Lang’s arrest. Besides the Accords Committee, Germany’s decision will be the key factor in the final verdict.”
It’s almost like a loss of a dream, too. But so many dreams were attached to the three of them, which one could Tony possibly be missing?
Gorgeous, of course he’s gorgeous, but more than that; He smelled like orange and vanilla, from the pastries, he said,
She swallows back her emotions, clenching her jaw and squaring her stance, nodding curtly at T’Challa, and the king considers her for a moment with a soft gaze before nodding back and turning on his heels, calmly making his way back inside. Sam and Steve immediately turn their heads to look at her once T’Challa has turned his back, but she simply grips her bag tighter and follows him, unwilling to give them an opening to ask about
Nebula throws him a look like she wants to strangle him, nevermind they have just gone three different plans just so they can avoid Tony dying too soon. “Why is your armor so lethal to your body? It’s supposed to be a part of you.”
by the idea that he might have lost the love of his life – Tony wishes he could say he knows how to do that.
He removes his hand slowly, the touch dragging across Tony’s arm with a shocking sensation of electricity, itching all the way down until the cold fingers leave completely from his skin, and Tony hates how self-aware of it he is, the path left tingling across his forearm like they’re sinking into him, the trail of his digits, lingering long after any contact has been made at all.
“It could be a trap.” Sam reasons, putting his gun away in his holster, as Natasha also relaxes and deactivates her Widow Bites.
"Stark." He says, and his voice has no emotion to it. No anger, no warmth, no nothing. If not for the use of his name, Tony would almost think Barton doesn’t recognize him.
“That’s fast, for a document that’s so extensive.” Natasha points out, seemingly innocent, but so obviously not.
, it’s so serious, didn’t you see? They can’t – this can’t happen again. It can’t, they have no time, they have
“We can debrief them on what happened inside the House in the last few days, see if anyone saw anything, maybe if the President made it or not.”
“But the message came from somewhere only the Time Stone could touch. The future.” Thor nods, affirming. “There might be six Infinity Stones, but much like the Aether affects space, and space affects time – the Stones must be connected by one…
Natasha considers him for a moment, silently, and then she places the knife on the table and reclines back, allowing herself to be unguarded in his presence. It feels good to see it. It feels better. It feels…
Someone screams his name and his body shakes back and forth limply, nearly painfully – and suddenly, all he can see is blue.
what exactly he is seeing when he stares at the two projections, side by side, and the one on the right just looks like a sick, destroyed sphere, in comparison to the image on the left.
“We can make it lock it onto you.” Nebula wonders aloud a second option. “We connect it to the ship, redirect the pulses from the turbines to your armor, and shock it into working again. The extra energy will lock it in place. It won’t move.”
“No.” Tony exhales harshly, struggling to keep himself in check. “We have other ways to produce food. And plants grow fast. Faster than us. But that doesn’t— It makes no
The mesh is programmed to work similar to the armor, molding itself into his anatomical form both inside and out, using the chips he implanted on himself as guidelines – but mostly was programmed with
to say it aloud, needing another person to hear it to make it true, to make sure he didn’t imagine it. “It’s something called a nanite compartment. I don’t understand much about the mechanics of it, but it seems like it stores an armor inside. It’s not really stuck in his chest like the one he had before, it’s detachable.”
Rhodes dashed out as soon as he could. Natasha, as quickly as she could, killed the turbines and jumped out of the seat, pausing only to try and shake Steve out of his stupor, without much success, he admits. But even for her, who has far more control than any of them over her emotions, is so rattled that not even her concern for Steve’s lack of response is enough to keep her away from the opportunity to see Tony again after years of no contact.
Howard is insane. He has to be. Why would he do such a thing? Doesn’t he know this is killing Maria slowly, quietly, and her heart can’t take much more of this?
After that, an introduction is just a mere formality, but Tony is a public speaker and a host through and through, and thinks it’s for the best if he reassures Lang that Nebula will
“I just—” Pepper starts, but then looks like decides against whatever she was going to say. “You said you helped Tony get back here?”
“What were you saying?” Maria changes the subject, but she’s still watching her husband’s face with a careful eye, just slightly wary. “When you came in?”
He thinks about it all the way to the cells. Sam grins at him mischievously when he spots him, and Steve is so glad to see them all, to see them mostly unharmed, even though seeing Wanda restrained makes his gut tighten with barely contained fury, indignant and disgusted, his hands aching with an animalistic desire to make Ross pay for such cruelty against a
“That’s not necessary.” Cap gently assures. “I was staying at SHIELD Headquarters. Nothing there is really mine. I have everything I need here.”
“Yes.” FRIDAY says. “If gathered footage is to be believed, and the vanishing of half the world population has occurred by
“He’s freaking out about Tony’s Reactor.” Natasha suddenly says, and her words echo through the walls the same way Steve can hear the glass shattering under his shield—
“When Strange gave him the Stone, he left.” Tony shrugs, uncomfortable. “Probably assumed I would bleed out.”

“Tragic.” Natasha says, with no inflection whatsoever. “Doesn’t Tony give you money? Guess we got the favorite one wrong.”
“Okay. You gave me your opinion as a teammate.” He says, ignoring her attempt at a taunt, still far too worried to allow their banter to deflect him from this. Steve is not running from this conversation. Not anymore. “And as a friend? Were we… You think we were dangerous? To each other?”
it in his voice. “Please, Ms. Carter. He has been in contact with only me for the last five years. I do not know how much he can actually perceive, if he understands time or loss, but we are only human. We are sentimental things. And I have to admit that I’m sentimental enough to not want to see the young Mr. Stark locked up in an attic with the rest of the furniture.”
Bucky is solid and warm in his arms. Steve can feel the way his body shakes when he chuckles, putting his arm around Steve’s back, holding him close. “You too.” He says in something like a sigh, happy. “Shuri told me you went on a mission while I was under. Good to see you’re still in one piece.”
“He wasn’t really my friend, he was…” Thor tries to explain, but his words get lost in the space between them all, dissolving into nothingness, with just a faraway look in his mismatched eyes as proof that something inside him is holding a grief he cannot properly explain with words.
“I have something for you. But there’s something you need to know first.” Howard stops just as they reach the front of the room, a room they never actually used in the mansion, just one more of the many empty spaces Maria never got to fill for Anthony as he’d grow up. She stares at the door pensively, until Howard blocks her way with his shoulder, trying to gather her attention once more. “Maria. No one can know about what’s in there. Not now, at least. Maybe in a couple of years, after it’s a little more refined.
fight with you so that argument might not hold up now. If I ever wanna put the suit on ever again, I’m gonna have to play by the rules now.”
So we do whatever the hell we must so we can prove them wrong. Not right.” Clint proclaims, unyielding. “And if we do something bad anyway, we gotta fix it. We take responsibility.”
it, diving down fast and determined, Rhodey following close behind, as they go deeper into the black cloud of smoke, like the world is closing in on them, and they zero into the hole on top of the plane, where a trail of fumes still blows from, focused on nothing else.
. Tony looks at these bodies and he sees the first fire of many, the first explosion in God knows how many more across the country, across the world, from crashes and accidents no one ever came to rescue because the rescue died, or fled, scared for their own safety and their own families. Maybe eventually they’ll feel confident enough that they won’t suddenly disappear too, maybe, as the days or maybe months go by, while they wait, terrified, for a second wave of the attack to come only to realize it won’t; Maybe
“There are ways.” Tony affirms. “We can fix this, we just need the numbers. If we get enough people maintaining the system like it used to be, water, power, we can work on cleaning the air before it shuts us down completely. Nature does it all the time, right? It’s not her first time. We’re just gonna give her a push. Our species survived the Ice Age, Bruce, we can do this. We have to.”
Not this time. Tony will try to stop it this time. He’ll rack his brain out, he’ll try, because that’s all he can do, with odds like these.
“What am I even supposed to do with him? We can’t just leave him here, with the rest of the furniture. It’s still… God, I do not like it, but it’s still important. To you.And to Howard, apparently.”
Clint fiddles with a toothpick that is within his reach, trying to keep his hands busy, but he just gives up after a few seconds and says “We were talking, and she was nervous, it took me a while to understand a word she was saying. She said something like how she had finally gotten to all of us and with Ultron and the Accords, she should’ve expected it…”
“I did.” Pepper sighs, and rubs her cheek against his skin for a minuscule moment. “Are you feeling better?”
He hasn’t forgotten that either. First and foremost, as a king, yes, but as soon as he put on the Black Panther suit and got involved, the Accords were pushed into his hands. Scott will probably have to sign them when he returns, even though he’s never seen them before. What does that tell them? Isn’t that proof enough? They won’t stop, not until every single enhanced person is under their control. That’s not safe. That’s not
But he keeps putting the pieces back together. Over and over again, even if they’re not as seamless, even if they’re not as shiny as they used to be. But he keeps doing it. Because he would rather have them, cuts in his hands, sleepless nights, and all that comes with it, than not having them at all.
This chapter also includes an extra treat: the introductions of a few characters I'm very eager to discuss a little more. Well, it'll be a treat for me. I wonder how you are going to feel about it when we get there. There sure will be some diverging opinions, I suspect. But since when am I known for avoiding delicate topics? They won't have entire arcs of their own, unfortunately - but see if that can stop me from including them and stirring the pot, just because I can. I said no stone unturned. I'm going to keep that promise.
All he knows is that he hears the words and he prays that they are true, because he has no other option if they prove themselves to be false.
