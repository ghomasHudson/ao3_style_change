"Oh, it's Ok Steve…" said Peggy as she straightens herself and smiled a little. "I tried to call you earlier but you didn't answer me…" She said making Steve sighs at that.
"Hello, little one, my name is Peggy, and this is Angie." The woman said with a smile, it made Peter smile and wave as her, the woman beside her was sniffing and wiping her face, which made Peter look at Aunt Peggy with worried look which made the woman smile at him and say something to the woman beside her which made her give a chocked laugh and come to hug Peter tightly.
"Ah, yes…" Steve murmured, a soft smile on his lips before he kissed Tony's temple, causing the Omega to hum. "Even grown-up, they are still our babies, aren't they?" Steve stated causing Tony to chuckle at that, knowing fully well, that if Peter or even Harley heard about being called babies, they would pout till the end of the time.
The group was clearly on a level above the men and women who had been holding them hostage. Their armors were of clear silver aside the steel, and each had a different intimidating level to them, true warriors, Steven couldn't help but think. The first one was a man with short blond hair that carried an interesting bow seemingly made of bones and adorned with countless runes, and Steven had to smile when everyone gasped when they smelled the scent of an Omega coming from him. Steven was sure that everyone was used to seeing Omegas being delicate things, meant to be seen and not heard, not warriors who bathe in blood and are strong enough to server heads from enemies and way less being able to stand on equal ground with other Alphas and Betas at a higher spot on whatever hierarchy the Vikings possessed if only those ignorant fools knew that Omegas can also be leaders of their own tribes when it came to his people.
Steve was angry, he was hurt, he was spiteful, and he hated everyone and everything that continue to trap him in this room. But the most important thing was; Steve was terrified, he was so terrified of everything that happened around him. He was terrified that everyone around him was right all along and Steve was the crazy one in all of this. And maybe Steve was the crazy one, because if he wasn't, then how was Peggy alive when Steve was the one who confirmed her death after seeing her body? If he wasn't crazy then where was Tony? The man hasn't been here not once, nor was there a search or news about a missing husband anywhere… was Steve really making this up? This life with Tony that thinking about it now seemed impossible and out of soap operas kind of things.
The only sound that could be heard in the room was gasps as both Tony and Steve tried to regain themselves, shivering now and then as the pleasure course through their bodies. Tony couldn't help but mewl softly when Steve turns around on his back and placing him on his chest, causing Tony to sigh contently and snuggle to his Alpha. Tony then started purring softly as he felt Steve's hand running throw his hair gently whispering how beautiful and brave Tony was and how he loved him more than anything in the world, that action made Tony flush happily and snuggle to his Alpha, even more, his purring increasing when he felt a warm blanket over him.
Two years since Tony start seeing a therapist; his mental state not being that great after having to deal with the strange town and their strange monster, and the people who came after him planning on killing him, starting from Ty and ending with Howard… half a year since Tony finally managed to get over the strangeness and madness he was forced to live through; finally deciding to open a new page and living his life like he always wanted to. A few months since Tony finally managed to categorize his feelings for the strange creature living in the lake, whom he hated but still grateful for his protection.
"Yes! I gave the military false gadgets and blame Stark, let me gooooo!" Hammer whined as he tried to pull away from Steve, only for the metal arm to pin him in his place like a fly stuck in a flytrap. "P-Ple-aseeeeeee! I won't do it again! Helpppp! I won't insult Stark again, stopppppp!" Tony could only wince at the sight in front of him, wondering if he should call Rogers and order him to back away and leave Hammer alone to lick his wounds. "I will give the police everything they wanted to know, I will confess to all my crimes, pleaseeeeee! kyahhhhhhh!" OK… that actually sounds tempting, maybe Tony should let Hammer be torture for a few more minutes before doing something.
"Well… Congratulation Mr. Stark, you are a father to a little girl!" His doctor said cheerfully as she turned to Bucky and Steve; the news of him having a girl caused tears to cloud Steve's eyes, and the Omega didn't have it in him to correct his doctor by telling her that Bucky wasn't the child's father like she thought, with how she went to congratulate the shocked Alpha.
So he made sure to work for it, he went to Jarvis one day, knowing the man had the connections to help him, he asked from the man to make him a fake ID, passport, and papers with the name of Anthony Carbonell, the man had been shocked at first, confused even, but one of the things Anthony loved about the man is that he doesn't ask any questions, he just nodded his head and told him to come for them next month, everyone in his family knew that Anthony would end up running away because of Howard, and everyone knew that the only reason he stayed this long was because of his mother, but his mother was finally getting over her depression, she was finally standing up for herself against Howard, she was finally getting her life on the track, and Anthony knew that it was time for him to get his life on the track.
Tony shook in his place, the horror of what he nearly did finally starting to seep into him, making Tony nearly lose his footing. The horrifying scene of Steve crying was still fresh on his mind, playing at the same time as Peter's scene when the small boy found them; tears clouded Tony's eyes as he tried to catch his breath, only now realizing the gravity of what he did.
Aunt Morticia asked with curiosity coloring her voice. "Extremely." Steve stated, causing the woman to sigh in longing. Not a few seconds later Gomez and Morticia started their daily flirting, getting a giggle from his mother. "Ma, I want to tell you something… I'm in love." Steve sighed, causing the woman to squeal. She was probably happy that he was finally in love, something he always complains about not having time for.
"You attacked the Omega? Is that all? Do I need to remind you about how you attacked my son?" Starkad snarled, his fury made panic and fear fall upon everyone, even Loki and Thor shifted in their places, tensing every second that passed, the king was a few seconds from killing with his bare hands; everyone knows not to touch the little prince because it meant death; no matter what people's opinion about the little pup was, and how some were angry that Starkad will ignore his duty of marrying a beautiful maiden and settling down and producing heirs, their king was content with taking care of a child born out of wedlock; it doesn't matter to the Alpha though, for touching his boy was the fastest way for someone to be thrown into the sea after being tortured nearly to death.
The snort of amusement behind him made Tony grit his teeth and glance at the lake, his breath hitch when his eyes fell on the raging lake; the waves were hitting the shore and it looked like there was a storm coming soon, but… but there was no wind. "Oh, that little rat did tell me about this. 'Barnes and Carter's word are a law if they say something happened than it did; if they deny it ever happened then it didn't. If someone disappears and they said they didn't exist, then they didn't.' it makes me wonder, will they forget about you ever existing in this house when you leave in the middle of the night?" Stane mocked and Tony's lips trembled, tears clouding his eyes at the harsh and cruel words, even with all the extra time he made Stane talk to gain time, Tony still didn't come up with a plan that will save him and his baby.
Steve didn't know where his legs were taking him, until he stood up in front of Shield HQ that made Steve swallow and growl to himself and start running toward Fury's office not caring about the people who tried to stop him along the way, when he reached the office he slammed the door open, making Fury look up from his paperwork to gaze at Steve who walked toward him like a predator slamming his hands on the desk. "Send me on a mission," Steve ordered making Fury gaze at him for a long time with a little pause, then he opened his drawer and get a file out.
“Why look who finally decided to come!” Rhodey let out a happy laugh when he saw Tony walking inside the house holding presents, Megan and Jimmy each holding a leg of his hostage giggling every time Tony took a step forward, dragging them with him, the sight before them, made everyone laugh, Carol though, just huffed and called Jimmy back, causing the small boy to pout and let go of Tony’s leg, the two years old waddling to his mother.
"Do you want me to bring you something? Food, water, aunt Peggy? I'm sure that you are tired from sleeping without moving an inch for two weeks, but maybe you should return to sleep, I mean it's probably good for you, but maybe not, I'm afraid of Mr. Hyde coming back, so maybe I will lock you in, what do you think?" Tony teased just to be a little shit, which caused Steven to laugh and shake his head, throwing Tony a warm look that made the Omega puff his chest in pride…
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, a little bit of sadness, fluff, and cuteness, time-skips, family bonding together, a little bit of violence, unexpected events, and the baby is here! And who knows what? All reviews are appreciated.
Rhodey called him as soon as he got the news crying about how he was happy for Tony, and how sad he was that Tony didn't tell him the happy news first, and how he wouldn't accept less than being the baby's Godfather. That made Tony laugh happily and the two friends talked happily about the baby and how Tony was doing, Rhodey promised him that he will come home soon for Christmas to see the baby, by the time he Rhodey will come, Tony will be seven months pregnant, so he was happy to get all the help he wants.
Tony's breath hitched when Steve moved; the star leaned down causing Tony's eyes to flutter. The kiss Steve pressed against his cheek was softer than a butterfly's touch and just as fleeting. It lights a spark in Tony's belly, one that demands him to turn his face and capture Steve's lips with his own; Steve pulled back, letting a soft laugh at the dumb look Tony was no doubt sporting.
' Bucky kept whispering, made Steve feel even worse than he already did, cursing his rotten luck for matching him to someone who was just like his father, using him and ending up discarding him when he was done…
"I…" Tony's voice cracked, his tears finally start fallen down at the realization that the love of his life was going to die, that Steve was going to die and leave him alone in this world; Steve and Peter were going to leave him alone. It wasn't even fair, it wasn't fair at all, Tony just got his mate and child back, he just got them back; it was so unfair, so unfair losing them not a few months later so unfair!
The pup seemed to realize something as he paled and turn around to look for something, or someone, Tony looked around the place to see that people were already packing to leave since the sun was going to set soon. "I… I lost him." The pup's lips start wobbling as he looked around the place; the small hitches breaths made Tony kneel and turn the pup toward him gently.
! Do not worry, I will be the one who will do all the torture, you just enjoy the show." Steve purred the smugness was dripping from Steve in waves, making Tony gulp and send a quick prayer to God, asking Him for mercy. "We are here!" Steve chirped happily, dumping Tony in what looked like a plush pillow that Tony was sure wasn't there a second ago.
Tony spent the whole day fighting them, the whole fucking day! He couldn't help but look at the clock in his suit every five seconds, and when the fight ended at 6 PM, Tony wanted nothing but to fly to where Peter and Steve were waiting for him, he wanted nothing but to find that fucking leader of this fucking group and throw him from the top of the Stark tower, watching with a dark glee as the fucker hit the ground and break into thousands of pieces!
"You have no right to keep my son away from me," Carter whispered after five minutes or so, her words causing Tony to shift uncomfortably and look away from the woman; words like these always hurt him, especially when he remembered whispering them in the dead of the night to whoever was listening to him as he plea. But Tony knew Carter, he knew from the many stories he gathered from his friends and Steve that the woman was not stable enough to be in the same room as Peter; knew that anger would get hold of her and that she may hurt his son. Peter finally managed to overcome his trauma of interacting with Omegas and start teaching Harley how to do it, Tony was not going to ruin his baby's process by forcing him to interact with his mother who nearly killed him when he was four.
"Oh, God…" Peggy breathed out as she tried to hold in her sobs which made Steven turn his gaze away, hating that he was the one who caused Peggy to cry, God, how many time was he the reason that his loved one always ended up crying and heartbroken? Tony, Peggy, Bucky, his friends… when will the list stop?
"Steven, I think that the two of us need to talk." Peggy said gently to Steven after she regains her balance and walked so she was standing near Steven, the man hearing her words, he nodded his head and pointed with his head to the mansion which made the woman hum and follow him, ignoring everyone chatting behind them.
"… but he doesn't love you." Peggy said harshly which made the Omega's mouth fall open with shock, looking at the woman with betrayal and heartbreak. "You may think that Steve actually loves you just because he gave you a chance to be a play toy, but allow me to enlighten you, Tony… those who lost their mates, never ever take another for the rest of their life, and if they do… they will make their mates' lives a living hell… you may hate me Tony, but this is for the best…" Peggy said which made Tony let out a growl at the woman slapping her hands away when the woman came to wipe his tears away.
"Only for you." Tony's breath hitched as he panted and scrabbled for a decent hold on Steve's shoulders, feeling himself slipping as he was claimed by his mate over and over again. Steve moaned into the hollow of Tony's throat, and Tony felt his mate let go then, the steady precision of his thrusts dissolving into a barely restrained pace. Steve doesn't draw all the way out of Tony anymore, instead rutting, in short, quick thrusts aimed to work his cock deep, deeper, and eventually his knot.
Fury couldn't help but throw one last glance at the small boy before he continued his way, many questions swimming inside his mind and the Alpha planned to find some answers to them. Starting with Nattalegg and ending with the mother of the small child… if the boy is who Fury thinks he is then maybe… just maybe…
Hearing his voice, the Alpha raised his head and a relieved expression took over his face, he waved to Steve shyly giving him a hesitant smile when the Omega stopped in front of him. "A-are you OK? You scared us when you fainted last night…" Bucky whispered, staring at Steve than at Tony who was standing behind him, and Steve ignored how Tony's eyes were still on him, clouded with worry and concern.
Steve doesn't know how much time passed; he was unaware of the time passing, with how happy and content and warm he was. The loud shrieking noise that greeted Steve after a while of calmness made him tense in his sleep, he wanted to wake up, wake up, wake up! But his body refuses to do what he orders it. "
It was a few seconds before the last pull of the Bifrost subdues, and when it did, Steve found himself grunting when his body gave on him and left him kneeling on the blood-drinched ground. Raising his head at the silence that deafened him, Steve's heart stopped in his chest when he saw that he was in the middle of the battlefield, and not any battlefield, but the Asgardian's battlefield.
Opening the closet door, Steve stilled when he saw a sheet-lining covering the walls, causing Steve to let out a confused '
2-Haltu á tungunni, Hydra konungur, áður en þú týnir því. -Hold your tongue, Hydra king, before you end up losing it.
"Y-you are Tony Stark…" The pup whispered as he looked at Tony hiding behind his father's legs from the embarrassment, which caused Tony to giggle at that and look at the father who had an amused look on his face.
Steven's words caused James to stop mid-yawn and turn to his mother, giving Steven a sleepy smile. "No." James shook his head, shuffling until he burrowed into Steven's side. "I see him a lot though, he is always in the forest near the kin's house; people do not like him because he does not have a dam… foolish people." James mumbled to himself, yawning a few more times before he dozes off, falling asleep shortly after that.
"He is alive…" She sobbed, and lean on Howard, Howard who was frozen, who was looking at the phone like he saw a ghost, Howard who had tears running down his face without him noticing… "Tony is alive…" She repeats once more…
The first one is a post-Civil War story with dark Tony, and Hydra Steve from another dimension, not team Captain America friendly, or team Iron Man friendly, the story is the most sensitive and dark fic I wrote, so please read the warnings before reading.
Whispering his thanks, he wore the pendant on his neck, smiling at it sadly before hiding it under his dress, the only reason he ever chooses the blue dress was that, it has a high collar that will hide his pendant from unwanted gazes, he looked at Margaret with a small smile and nodded his head as he headed to the door.
Standing up, he let out another sigh as he went toward the mirror in the far side of his room and sat on the chair facing it, taking a brush from the table and start brushing his long blond hair, absent-minded as he repeated the motion up and down, untangling his hair, he wanted to cut his hair short, just to spit on the king who always praises him for his beautiful hair, but he cannot do it, he cannot cut the last tie that ties him with his people, wherever they are now.
It all started after Tony woke up the next day with both Peter and Harley sleeping in his arms, holding him tightly as their sleepy mumble reaching his ears; causing Tony to purr unconsciously and nuzzled his babies until they woke up and get ready to face the day. Ever since that day with the broken glass incident, Tony can proudly say that Harley was finally opening up to him like the Omega always wished he would, making Tony overjoy at the thought of the pup finally accepting him and feeling safe around him to joke and laugh and play without fear of something bad happening.
Tony frown in bewilderment when his fingers brushed a small box; he took out the box slowly, wondering what it was, only for his heart to stutter when his sight settled on it, a flush taking over his face when he noted that the small box in his hand was a ring box. So many possibilities fleeted inside Tony’s head, but all of them pointed in one direction, one direction that turned Tony’s face into a crimson mess.
Bucky grinned, “That is quite the coincidence…” He inhaled and stood up from his seat, “I’ll be right back.” He made a call for Sergeant to get up and returned to his spot on the couch where he thought of everything he had just heard.
“Bucky? Is it okay if I get closer?” Rhodey’s face came into view with his eyebrows pushed together in concern, “Steve’s on his way down.”
Rhodey was to Tony as Bucky was to Steve, or that’s how he kept describing it. It seemed he wanted Bucky to be a member of their family, just as Steve and Tony did.
Steve shoved a kiss onto Tony’s lips, “Oh, you’re the best, you know that?” He kissed again and held this one out, stopping the other man from being able to reply, “Thank you, Tony, thank you for taking care of him. I love you so much. You’re so intelligent and kind and…” His words drifted off as he continued to pepper kisses on the scientist.
“I love you, Tony…” Steve finally left the lab and took the stairs to the Tower’s living area. As he pushed through the door, he was greeted by Peter’s bouncer rolling into his shin. Twice. He laughed and leaned down to give the bouncer a twirl across the floor, causing a flood of baby laughter to fill the air.
“Hey, hey, Petey, you’re okay,” cooed Steve. His attention was reluctantly brought away from Bucky when he realized that his child had gone from impatient squirming to crying, “I’m sorry, baby, it looks like Uncle Bucky’s still resting.”
Then, there was T’Challa -- as if he wasn’t graceful enough being the attractive, young king of Wakanda. Ororo had to get him pregnant so he could sit criss cross with his belly on his legs and look like an actual God at every opportunity. When they talked about pregnant people glowing, they were talking about T’Challa. He grinned like the cat who ate the canary, and every chance saw him basking in knowing how regal he looked.
“Bucky’s stable, Steve. Not awake yet. Believe me, I think you’d be the first to know--” Bruce took a long look at Steve’s face before eyeing his shoulder. He raised a hand, reaching out to let it hover by his arm.
He leaned down and scratched behind his ears. Peter patted his head when he was close enough, making the same sounds he would at other dogs. If his first word wasn’t “dog” or some variation of “Captain”, Steve would be surprised.
Trotting along came a decent-sized dog. Bucky recognized it was some kind of shepherd and tilted his head, mouth hanging open with no words. He looked to Steve, but Steve said nothing. Instead, Banner spoke, “His name’s Sergeant.”
“Oh, you’re up-” Tony walked back to where Bucky laid. He yanked along a rolling cart that was full of mechanical objects, armor, and tools. It looked like remnants of…
He exhaled, having not realized he was holding his breath, and started petting her. She wagged her tail and licked Peter’s face until his crying stopped. Bucky pitched his head forward and into the lab’s, and everything was okay.
Tony set the sketchbook to the side and stood up with the baby in his arms. He adjusted him, causing a little squawk to come out of Petey, and met Steve in the kitchen. It was a quiet lunch with Peter in Tony’s arms the entire time.
Sure, all the girls fancied the boy with the car, but the boy with the car only fancied the boy ‘riding shotgun’ on every adventure.
Tony could’ve said “Take this off of me” or “I don’t care” or “I want to die” or anything that he was thinking, but silence encaptured him. He stared at Peter with a numbness that he never thought would go away…
Tony thought it was a simple rule that would alleviate some heartache for his husband who had already been the one to storm into Bucky’s room. He thought to his own best friend, his James, and how much it hurt to see him in the hospital. The hours he lost waiting with him were only slightly higher than the hours he spent trying to drink away his guilt.
“Hold up, Buck, Petey looks like he’s getting ready to lay down,” Sam jogged into the living room, causing Bucky’s eyes to fly open, “Can you just keep him in here so we don’t keep jostling him awake?”
Wanda seemed to hear ‘Romani’ above everything else and corrected Steve, “Bucky can call himself whatever he wants, it’s you who can’t call us the ‘g’ word any more.” She reached up to poke Steve’s jaw, “But Bucky, I would love to talk to you about that at some point, Pietro and I were kidnapped by Hydra--” She boldly declared, “And our father is a mutant overlord so Steve helps us with the Jewish part of our heritage and we’d love to talk to fellow Romani.”
He pushed his fingers through Bucky’s hair. Each tangle was carefully undone. The vital sign monitor seemed to drown out other sounds as Steve’s own heart seemed to beat faster. He swallowed the saliva collecting in his mouth, blinking harshly as he stared at the bloodied bandages.
“Tony, are you off in your own little world over there?” Steve’s voice shook Tony from his daily ‘Feel sorry for himself’. A smile was plastered across his face while his eyes flicked between his sketchbook and the love of his life.
Bucky was exhausted. He felt as if he would never be able to open his eyes again, but he needed to know what was going on. He… he forced his eyelids to lift and squinted through blurred vision to witness Tony Stark ushering Steve from the room. His mouth opened, but the words in his mind never came out as the beeping of machines began to echo in his aching head.
“I can’t believe I--” Bucky continued, “Steve must be so upset, I’m… I just can’t do this, alright?!” He jerked into an upright position. The pain was nothing. It meant nothing to him. He grabbed his shoulder and pitched forward with every nerve in his body yelling at him, “Do you know how hard it is? It’s like I don’t even know my best friend any more! You all, you all are so close! There are children in this Tower, there is a child!”
Soon enough, their awkward kisses turned into more with their bodies pressed together, hands roaming, and what Bucky called ‘their first time’ where he was sprawled out beneath Steve and panting. He didn't recall doing much besides swaying together for hours, but those hours were one of his favorite memories.
Wildly, Tony flailed out a hand, reaching for him. His depth perception was off; Steve wasn't quite close enough to where Tony's hand was.
Stephen's picture frowns up at him. Tony runs into the hallway and, when he's far enough away that he's sure Steve can't hear him, stabs the answer button. He's running up the stairs, into his own room, shutting the door.
Steve's not even upset anymore, at the memory of his failure. He feels like he can't be upset about anything anymore. But he still thinks Tony should know. "I'm sorry about that," he says, once more, gesturing vaguely at the rest of the world. "I didn't-- I didn't believe in you." He'll do better next time. He will.
He dared to let his hand drift up Tony's spine, to the nape of his neck, the back of his skull -- and then Tony yelped, and Steve instantly let go.
And Jan... smiles. "I'm so happy for you," she says, and Steve breathes out in relief. "I suspected, the way you were fretting over him today. But that's so wonderful."
"No, that's all right," Steve said, because of course it was. "That's fine by me. Of course you don't have to do a single thing you don't want to."
once he figured out exactly how Steve liked it, and if Steve had realized that five minutes ago he would have just told him that was how he knew Tony was going to be good, because, God, didn't Tony already
But even if Tony really had been a legitimate suspect, even if he had actually merited a news story about his involvement in the murder, this wasn't how anyone who loved him should have run that story. Hell, this wasn't even how an impartial news network should have run that story. They should have gone to Tony first, while they were drafting the segment. They should have interviewed him, or at least his lawyers. They should have gotten his side of the story. They should have presented both sides. They should have reported all the facts, and let the truth speak for itself. That was your goddamn
Tony doubles over the kitchen sink and-- oh, how nice, it's blue hydrangeas, just like the very first time, except now they're coming out of him in clumps and handfuls, in whole blossoms just like the roses had.
Steve leans over and kisses the faceplate. He can hear Iron Man's breath shudder to a halt, and then start again.
But to his surprise, Tony nods. "I can do it," he says, and there are echoes of his usual determination in his tone. "You can go get ready." And then he falters. "Just-- could you keep talking? If you want?"
Every escalator from the fifth floor on up was wooden. Even with the seriousness of the mission, Steve still looked delighted to learn that some things hadn't changed. Tony supposed Steve hadn't been in here in a good forty years.
"I've got his number, if that's what you mean," Carol said. Her gaze was distant. "Henry and Tony and I, we're usually at the same meetings. Tony hasn't-- he hasn't been to one recently. And I've been... worried. And I know Tony's probably not someone you want to talk about now, if you're leaving because of him, but--"
"Well, I'm right here," Steve says, with a reassuring smile. He sets the towels at the foot of the bed and holds out the washcloth. "And I brought you this. Nice and cool. I thought maybe you'd feel better if you got to wipe your face off."
Angling his body toward Steve, Tony sat back and steepled his fingers together like he was about to give a scientific lecture, which Steve supposed, in a sense, that he was.
I like to make the ASRS cry." He grinned. "How do you even have enough blood left to blush, honey? I know you know what we did this morning and yet I can't even get you to say the word
"That's putting it mildly," Steve said. Mostly he'd been terrified that Sharon had somehow figured out he was secretly queer and that was why she'd offered; he'd known that hadn't made any sense, but, well, he'd been scared anyway. "It wasn't what I learned. And I wasn't brave enough back then, before the ice, to admit it to anyone other than myself -- I barely admitted it to myself -- but that was what I secretly wanted most of all. I wanted to be brave enough to do the thing that made you gay. The thing that was the most special. And then I woke up in the future and met you and, well, I wanted to do that with you. Because you were the most special to me. You still are." He smiled. "You don't have to. Of course you don't have to. If it wouldn't make you happy, I'd be fine without it. But it would really mean a lot to me if that were something you wanted, too."
At two hours, he did what he should have done an hour ago and pinged Tony's identicard. The commands took him three tries to type; his fingers trembled. It was still in the Stone building. It hadn't moved. In fact, it hadn't moved at all in about an hour and a half, to judge from the location history. It hadn't moved so much as an inch.
, and, while he wasn't entirely free from worry, he was beginning to feel a lot less skittish. Like he could start to contemplate what the next step would be. What he might, possibly, say to Tony.
None of this is going the way Steve had planned, but at the same time it's better than he could have dreamed.
"Well," Tony said. "Now you've met my favorite Avenger." He rewarded Steve with an unexpected smile. Warmth blossomed in Steve's chest. It was a much better warmth. His face was only a little hot, now.
Steve didn't say anything for a long time, and then he took a deep breath. "You know what the worst part of all of this was, for me?" He gestured around himself in illustration.
Tony's eyes were kind, and he ran his finger over Steve's lips. He wasn't angry, then. That was good. "It wasn't wrong," Tony said, quietly. "And it's very kind of you to think of my situation. I appreciate it."
Of course, they'd already established that Tony had no idea what people who really hated him would do to him, hadn't they? And for the most part it sounded like it had been, unfortunately, very close to that.
As if on cue, Radioactive Man began to crackle with energy, starting to glow. He was going to-- God, he looked like he was going to blow up--
"That'd be wonderful, thanks," Steve said. And then a possible complication occurred to him. "But what's going to happen when Tony realizes I'm not here anymore? I don't want him to worry."
Even worse, this time Mordo was clearly hedging his bets: the first blast of light was quickly followed up with a second, two bolts of green lightning streaking across the room in Tony's direction.
"It's a free country," Tony said, as casually as possible, taking an artful sip of his scotch to moisten his mouth. "Last I checked, it wasn't against the law to have a few drinks with a few friends."
"Shh, sweetheart," Tony whispers. "It's okay. I'm going to be okay. You'll see. It'll be good. I'll be right here with you. I promise."
He took a breath. He was going to try to explain this. "I know I don't talk all that much anymore about how things were different, in the forties. But it was different. And being queer was different. Not just how society looked at it. But what people did, that was different, too. Not what they did, exactly. But how they thought about it." It was going to sound weird. And maybe Tony wouldn't believe him. But it was the truth. "Back then, the... defining act... I guess you'd call it, of being queer -- it was going down on another man."
As Steve has most definitely learned from Vision, there's a trick to fighting intangible people: if they want to interact with the physical world, they can't stay intangible. It's a weakness they can't shore up. Even Vision, who can selectively phase out his individual body parts, has to keep that body part unphased if he wants to be able to touch something with it. Steve can safely assume that Ghost has that much in common with Vision. That means that, as long as Ghost is trying to grab that drive, Steve can make contact with his hands.
He didn't think Tony had ever taken care of him like this before. Other Avengers, sure -- you didn't get to be an Avenger without having picked up some basic and not-so-basic medical training -- but Steve had never really needed to be the recipient of it before. Usually it had been the case that he'd never been so badly off that the serum couldn't heal it immediately, or it had been bad enough that they'd needed to medevac him somewhere fast, and in that case it had never been Tony taking care of him.
Tony got it. One of Tony's fingers slid away from his balls, slid gently back and back, and it was dry but Steve knew he could take it, he'd taken a couple of his own fingers dry and it had been great, and this was
"It would be my absolute pleasure," Tony assured him, and he was utterly genuine. He tugged at the loosened waistband of Steve's unzipped pants, an obvious suggestion. "You want to get a little more comfortable?"
Ordinarily, Steve would probably pause at this point. He'd make sure Tony was absolutely fine. He'd start off slow. Gentle.
Tony was silent for a few seconds. He licked his lips. "Right after a second trip through my phobias, you woke me up," he said, and, wait, that wasn't how it had happened at all. "You pulled me out of DreamVision. I woke up and I was in Ty's penthouse and you were picking the electrodes off me. Very gentle. Very-- very kind. Ty wasn't there. You told me it was over. You told me you'd taken care of Ty. You told me I was safe now. You told me I was awake. And I was so
Tony leaned over and kissed his ear; a delightful shiver slid down Steve's spine and he said several things that weren't words, and then Tony's name. He was dimly aware that he was calling him perfect again. He didn't seem to be in control of his mouth. That was fine. Tony
Also, that thought was rapidly getting him hard, which was weird and all kinds of confusing and didn't really help when it came to figuring any of this out. But it wasn't like his dick was rational, and going through a box of someone else's toys had already been sort of furtively erotic, if he had to admit it to himself. He'd always liked really good leather, and, oh God,
It was Saturday morning; the usual team meeting had been canceled, so the briefing room was an empty place with just Steve and Jan in it. They hadn't had a lot of missions lately, which Steve had been thankful for, because the rest of his life had been quite busy enough. At least he had two good hands again. And he knew he shouldn't even be complaining, because, God, Tony had it so much worse than he did right now. Steve hadn't been able to bring himself to look at the morning papers before his meeting with Jan, in case the news had gotten worse.
"Hell of an accident, Winghead." Tony's voice was rough, and he rubbed his thumb over Steve's fingers again.
Tony's other hand went to Steve's back, rubbing calming circles over his shoulders. The noise he made was quiet, but it sounded somehow understanding. Like he knew. "It's okay. It's not a problem. I mean, I see what the problem is, but that's not a problem, okay?"
"Here, let me just get you free," Tony says, taking a step toward him. Without the filtering, he sounds a little more hoarse, a little more raw. Steve supposes the mask was a big help. His movement is a little odd, a little jerky, and Steve supposes that's still his suit keeping him upright.
, and I-- I know Iron Man's not a robot, of course I know he isn't, but I thought maybe there would be some similarities -- but the internet only told me about research grant proposals for robotics labs, and that wasn't what I wanted to know at all."
"I'll take that as a compliment," Tony said, and he kissed him, stroking him a little more firmly. Steve groaned against Tony's mouth as Tony licked into him, his kiss in time with the motion of his hand.
There's another aching, terrible silence, and it's only when Tony opens his mouth, in the half-second before he speaks, his pained gaze turned on Steve, that Steve realizes, with a pang of shame, it's not himself Tony is worried about. Not anymore.
"On me," Steve mouths silently, and he steps onto the floor. Behind him, Tony's footsteps are as silent as they can be -- which isn't very silent, because this isn't a stealth armor -- and the door creaks closed.
"A couple hours," Tony says, with an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry, I got distracted. Here, here, come on up."
His jaw was quivering now, his eyes were suspiciously reflective, and so Tony leaned over and nudged him as gently as anyone in a several-hundred-pound suit of armor could manage.
There's an amused gleam in Tony's eyes. "Yeah." He laughs. "It actually is. I just-- I don't know, I wanted a safeword that definitely wasn't going to come up in conversation. S'fun to say."
She looks at Tony once more, then back to Steve. She looks confused. Steve doesn't blame her. "IT, Captain. Data storage for special projects. Restricted access."
"Anyone else, anyone else at all," Steve said. "They would have said Strength." Tony was looking at him like that would never in a million years have occurred to him, and that was why Steve loved him. "And I thought at first that you'd say Strength too. But then you didn't. And I just--" He chuckled. "That was it. I was absolutely gone for you."
He also knew that most people probably would do some kind of formal negotiation at this point. Set out some ground rules. Establish a safeword. But that was going to require stopping, and Tony really didn't want to slow down now. They knew each other, he literally couldn't hurt Steve unless Steve let him do it, and they could just course-correct as they went along.
Then he heads next door, to his own room, and sheds his armor. Even as the models change, it's still a familiar ritual. This one, gleaming black and gold, even folds down into a backpack, almost like the old suitcase ones. His pulse pounds in his head. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.
The crowd began to whisper, intrigued, curious. Tiberius didn't stop them this time, letting the anticipation build. He had them eating out of the palm of his hand already.
And then he leans up and in, rocking onto his tiptoes, and presses a kiss to the cheek of Iron Man's faceplate. Like the rest of him, the metal is warm, smooth against his lips, and Steve pulls back a little, staring at his own reflection in the mirrored surface, distorted and golden.
The picture is all too easy to paint: Steve told Mr. Stark he was going to propose to Iron Man, and for some reason, God knows why, Mr. Stark turned right around and told Iron Man about it, and now Iron Man is here to call everything off. But it can't be. That can't be what's happening now.
"Captain," he said, hurriedly, his face a study in surprised innocence, "there's obviously been some mistake--"
But Tony just laughed, the air jolting from his lungs as Stone patted Tony's back hard. "Too long, Caesar."
Steve almost didn't want to know how anyone could be worse than Sunset Bain. Or any of the people Steve had thought of. "What happened?"
Steve is still staring, completely flummoxed, as his plan for the morning falls apart around him. This wasn't supposed to happen. Iron Man was supposed to be here. He can't think of a thing to say. He hopes he doesn't look as surprised as he feels. It doesn't help that Mr. Stark is so damned good-looking. It makes it hard to think straight around him.
Distraught and guilty, Steve just stares, and after several seconds he recovers enough to stumble through an apology. "Mr. Stark, I'm so sorry! Speaking for the team, sir, I sincerely regret that the Avengers in any way endangered you--"
. "Captain America," he muses. "The Sentinel of Liberty, subsumed by corporate greed. You're on Stark's payroll now too, huh? His new bodyguard, maybe? Just like Iron Man here." His head moves; he glances in Tony's direction, and then back at Steve. "Whatever happened to the American Dream? You've been bought out just like everyone else. And you're doing his dirty work, you and Iron Man. The immoral bidding of the military-industrial complex."
She was tired, she was so tired of trying to fix Howard's mistakes, tired of telling her bambino that no, Howard didn't hate him it wasn't the reason that he didn't come to his birthday, that she was sorry but his father was so busy with work that he couldn't attend his graduation from college, that she was sure that Howard didn't mean it when he paid Sunset because she was sure something was not right. She was tired of trying to come up with excuses to Howard's shitty ways of dealing with his family and friends, she was just so tired…
"In here!" Steven called out as he stood up, shaking his head and sending Nicolaus an amused look; Steven didn't even have to wait that long for the children to break through the tree line, laughing as they raced toward Steven and throw themselves in his arms. "You seem more energetic than you were this morn, why is that?" Steven asked, chuckling when James and Petrus started blabbering at the same time.
Steven grumbled to himself for the hundredth time that day, trying to stop himself from rolling his eyes so hard that they would end up falling out off his head, but he couldn't help it, especially when he was cornered by a few military personas who wanted to ask a favor of him but were too idiotic to be subtle about it.
"Babe, James will adore you, I admit the man can be a little scary, especially with the aura of assassin surrounding him, but that's another talk for another day, but the point is, James, will love you!" Tony rambled as he sat beside Steve, causing the Omega to relax at the closeness, smiling to himself as he always loved seeing how animated his Alpha got when he got worked up trying to explain something.
They reached an examination room, and Steve had to sigh sadly when Peter's sparkling eyes dulled, which caused the Omega to bring the pup in his embrace whispering encouraging words, promising that he will take the pup for an ice-cream after they were done, which made the pup hum a little but hide his face in Steve's neck taking comfort from the Omega. "Tony, what are you doing here? I have patients coming soon." The voice coming from behind Steve made the Omega turn his head to see a doctor with blond hair entering the room, looking at Tony with an unimpressed look, and that alone made a smile come over his face.
So many possibilities and so much time in his hands that he was finally free! Something moves through the trees, which made the brunette look up as the car moved; the branches were shaking, spilling yellowing leaves which made Tony smile, thinking that it was nothing but a squirrel…
"Oh no honey; it's not that, no. Harley is just… Harley is just tired baby, he needs rest he will be better when he wakes up soon, it is probably the pollen, you know how sick everyone gets in the spring." Tony explained wiping Peter's tears getting a nod from the boy who was still not looking convinced at all. "He is fine, as soon as Harley wakes up, he will probably come and join us for cupcakes, he loves the blueberry muffins so save a few for him OK?" Peter paused a little before nodding his head, going straight to the cake box demanding that Steve put it on the counter so that Peter will sort them for when Harley wakes up.
For a full year, the Starks and Peggy lived in the shadows... After Steve had awakened from the ice it seems like Howard had made Steve his successor and partner in SI which by default made him the CEO after his 'death', something that didn't help but made Steve felt like he stole that place from Howard's son. In his time as CEO Steve and Howard agreed on changing SI direction from a weapon making company into a company that's only business was in clean energy and other useful inventions… this change in heart, was because Howard had found his son's old journal, he read how his son wished that his father will get out of this war business, how Tony didn't want to be a 'Merchant of Death' how his son wanted to work with clean energy and create a useful designs that helped people instead of taking lives. That made Howard change the direction of his company to a road that will make his son proud of him… he hoped.
Dinner after that was a quiet affair; both Harley and Peter seemed to drain from crying to start any conversation, causing Tony to think of ways to cheer them up tomorrow. It was only when the boys went to sleep that Tony finally managed to relax a little and go to his room, wondering if Steve would manage to help him solve this problem.
"We don't think that you are lying, Tony." It was after Peggy answered him, that Tony knew he spoke all of his thought out loud; his teary eyes turn to Peggy who gave him a motherly smile, taking a tissue from the box near her, wiping the tears from Tony's face. "We know you are not lying, I don't know what kind of nightmare that got you so shaking, Tony, but you don't have to worry, me and Bucky will make everything right once more, we promise." Peggy smiled, her soft words causing Tony to let out a sob and hide his face in Peggy's embrace, being grateful that the older woman didn't point out how her blouse was getting damp with his tears.

"There is no need, Mrs. Carter, I can fix it, can I go and see it, please?" Tony asked trying to stop himself from jumping up and down in his chair, as he went through picture after a picture of the house he was going to buy, his own house, and remodel it like how he wanted, a beautiful gift for his baby for when they will come to the world, a place that they will love and adore, living a happy and healthy life in a place like that, without Stane or Howard's poisonous influence!
Steve called them after they finished lunch to ask about Peter, which the young pup took as a chance to chatter the Alpha's ear off about what he and Tony did in the lab, going about how he helped Tony with the engine, and that Mr. Stark wanted to talk with the Alpha about teaching Peter a little bit of engineering (The small pup begged him to give him lessons until the Omega accepts) it ended up with Tony talking with the Alpha about today's event, smiling a little when the Alpha promise to come for Peter at six PM… Tony wondered secretly if this is what it would have been like if he was mated and his baby survived, it end up with a sad smile as the Omega shook his head trying to banish these thoughts out of his head.
Finally gathering the courage needed; Tony opened his eyes, blinking them a few times before looking at the hand that caressed his cheek. Following the hand, Tony found the owner of the hand, and his breath hitched when his eyes fell on Steve; Steve, who was gazing at Tony with a soft look on his face, Steve who was awake.
"Thanks for the vote of confidence." Tony grumbled, but he understands what they are saying, a few months back before knowing that he was expecting, you will find him binging in his labs twelve hours straight without any break or someone to talk to, now, Tony nearly have everyone in the town looking after him, everyone treating him like their young family member. They fell silent, watching the rain fall outside and soak into the street, taking bits of their food now and then, sending each other gentle and happy looks, taking in the comfort of talking to each other comfortably after years.
Steve wheezed as he moved his hand toward one of the pockets his suit, just moving his hand hurt, he got the glasses out of his suit thankful that it didn't break in the fight, and maybe he should be thankful that the glasses were made from the same metal as his Shield, and was self-repair. "E…e-Edith…" Steve wheezed out, giving a weak cry when a wrong move made his broken rib press into his lung, though he continued his mission and wore the glasses activating it.
"Does it really matter?" Steven asked, a faraway look in his eyes before he let out a tired sigh, leaning on the tree behind him and shrugging his shoulder. "I think you already know, or suspect, either way, I ended up there, a slave for my enemy." Steven saw the twitch of anger the Alpha tried to suppress, and Steven could only look away from the man. "My mother is dead…" A harsh intake of breath, causing Steven to clench his hands into tight fists before crossing his arms over his chest; Steven wondered what the Alpha was thinking of when he heard this painful truth, especially when his mother was considered as a sister.
"She is beautiful…" Tony whispered, his finger gently caressing his daughter's cheek, causing the baby to scrunch her face before snuggling into Tony's chest, causing the Omega to let out a happy laugh, enchanted by his baby's action and a falling more in love. His husband seemed to have the same thought, for he didn't leave Tony's side, sitting on the hospital bed beside Tony as he held the Omega and the baby tightly, not letting go as he gazed at the baby with awe in his eyes.
Saturday morning you can see Tony pacing around his house, cleaning anything his hands fell on. He was nervous, that much was true, he woke up at dawn and couldn't return to sleep, so after showering and eating his breakfast, Tony start pacing around the place, a little nervous about the thought of Peter and his father coming to his house, and the only thing that he could think of to get himself together was going to his lab, but then he will lose himself in there and dirty his clothes, so the only thing Tony could do was clean the house, and he had to say his nervousness did lessen a little.
"Can I have the next day off? There is someone I am supposed to meet." Tony said turning his head to Peggy who gave a laugh and shook her head at him, muttering something suspicious that sounded like 'Idiot', Tony didn't care as his heart was pounding in his chest, at the chance of finally meeting Steve once again…
Or at least that's what Anton thought until James came sneaking into his workshop to see the Shield, even stayed outside of the shop all day, trying barging with Anton for a suitable price for the sheet of metal. Part of Anton wondered, what would the foolish queen offer him in exchange for returning the Shield to him? Steven's pup tried everything a pup his age thought of to get his hands on the Shield, even challenging Anton to a duel for it. What would the queen do or part with to get his hands on his Shield once more? Would he try barging with Anton? The queen has nothing other than his title and his status as a bringer than life; the queen has no sheep, no cows, no chickens, so he couldn't barter in exchange for the Shield. Not to forget that the queen has no silver or gold left in his name after Anton raided the Hydra castle, so he couldn't buy the Shield from him. Unless the queen made his people work several jobs at once to raise the money needed (Which Anton doubt Steven would, even if it meant losing the Shield) or use his status as Asgardian and connection with Loki and Thor (Which is also doubtful with how the prideful Steven was) the only way for Steven to get his Shield back is by stealing it (Again the Omega was too prideful and honorable to do something like this) or offer his body as a currency.
The whole day ended up with Tony reassuring Angie and his friends that he was fine, but Angie didn't have it, she actually called Chief Fury and told him about Ty which made the man give one of his scary looks before going to the bar Ty went to, in the end, everything went without a hitch or an angry man going after Tony thankfully, Angie ended up waving goodbye to them after giving them their takeout; Tony was just happy to ignore this crazy afternoon and go home, enjoying a movie with his friends…
So there was his baby toddling on the boxing ring, looking at Steve like a warrior ready for a battle which made Tony hold his squeals at how adorable his baby was, something that his mother and Angie don't feel ashamed at all to let their squeals out as they looked at the pup wishing for a camera to capture that adorable sight when the bell ringed signaling the round to start, Tony bite his lips and held his hands together praying, and he saw his baby rushing toward the Captain, only to get picked up from underneath his armpits, making everyone's eyes widen in disbelieve at that, and Tony was ready to march for the Captain and fight him for what he did, because how dare he!
Bucky finally ends up getting his life back under control, he finally gets rid of the last reminding of Hydra he has, by getting rid of that arm. He finally decided to move on with his life, by finally asking Sharon out, it was shocking news to everyone, but the two of them worked so well, they were so happy and lived full and happy lives with kids, they are now proud grandparents for a bunch of lively little devils as Tony liked to call them.
When it finally clicked into Pepper's head what Tony just told her, she squeals and hugged the Omega tightly making him let out a happy laugh. "Oh, I'm so happy for you Tony! Who is the lucky person? When is the wedding going to take place?" Pepper let go with a huge grin, only for the grin to fall at Tony's sad look. "There is no Alpha…" She got a nod from Tony, which made her let out a quiet 'Oh' and look at the Omega. "W-when is the appointment for the…" Pepper couldn't even finish her sentence, being a pregnant Omega without an Alpha or a mate was frown upon, but in the past ten years or so Omegas' right had been on the move, Omegas made process, they changed people's views on them, but even then, she didn't think that Tony will keep the baby, especially with Stane steering his father out there.
"Died? What type of nonsense are you saying, Tony? Morgan is alive! You are holding her right now!" Bucky stated, his brows were furrowed in confusion; Tony doesn't know what he was going to do hearing these words, he wanted to laugh so hard at Bucky and how he was still trying to play Tony for a fool, but Tony knew that if he started laughing, he wouldn't stop until he was a sobbing mess on the floor.
"Do you want to?" Tony shot back, sending Steve a harsh studying look, making Steve try hard to stop the grin that wants to break on his face.
The third is a Medieval Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamic story, with a dark Vikings Tony, and a take-no-shit from-anyone queen Steve (Yes, you read right) the story is kind of sensitive, so all the readers should read the warnings in the story.
"After their son's death, Peggy and Bucky trapped and banish Rogers to the lake because in their eyes he was responsible for their loss; they forbid everyone from talking about Rogers or mentioning his name to any other person. They treated Rogers as a substitute for their friend from the start and later convinced themselves that their best friend Stevie is also their son in some twisted way.
Tony laughed at that and he stood up, with the small pup in his arms, making the boy gasp and clutch the Alpha's shirt in his arms, grumbling a little when the Alpha nuzzled the boy's cheek with his nose, but secretly Peter was enjoying it because it made Peter all warm and fuzzy on the inside. "Why don't we brush our teeth? I will tell you everything you wanted to know while eating breakfast, I'm sure your Mom will have my head if we are late." Tony said with a cheeky grin, causing the pup to give a small laugh at that and lay his head on the Alpha's shoulder, refusing to let go in fear of him waking up and seeing that this was only a dream.
Though it did get better when Steve eventually arrived home, a day before the heat was scheduled to hit, which Tony though nearly dance of elation at the thought of Steve finally arriving home, Tony fidgeted as he stopped in front of Steve's old bedroom struggling to pick up the courage to enter and ask Steve the questioned that raged in his mind for days now…
"That was all Edith if you want to learn, just ask her." Steven said as he took his glasses off and cleaned her good, before returning her to her place and gaze around the destroyed conference hall with a grimace. "Sorry about that." Steven said which made Tony gaze around the room and then shrugs his shoulder, a pout taking over his face at that.
“Oh, I don’t think we mentioned it ‘cause everyone is always calling me Rhodey… My name is James too, Bucky. Tony, Steve, and I had a hoot about that.”
“I know you’re worried, but why don’t you go give Bruce a break from Petey for a bit? I promise nothing fun’s gonna happen while you’re gone.” He brought his goggles back down and turned to his workstation, bringing up his welding torch.
“Oh… no, I, I don’t think she was alerting for Steve. You were kinda freaking out a little on us? ‘Tasha came in and asked if you were hungry and you bolted up and started backing away from her,” Rhodey explained, reaching out to pet Captain as well, “I think we all have a bad habit of crowding when something’s wrong… so sorry about the mass confusion, everyone just couldn’t figure out if you were okay.”
The Avengers shared smiles and continued on as if Bucky’s episode never happened. They laughed and shared drinks while also getting the food out. For once, Bucky didn’t retreat to the couch. Instead, he sat at one of the counters while holding Sergeant’s leash as if his life depended on it. He watched everyone socialize instead of just listening to it from afar, and still, he didn’t feel too chatty, but that didn’t stop everyone from trying to talk to him.
“Maybe at some point the two of us or all of us could take Peter to the park, just get some fresh air? Even go to the bunker up north? Being cooped up in the tower isn’t good for anyone,” Sam shook his head.
Bucky smirked, “You… you really remind me of my mom, she had loose lips too. Everything to her ‘built character’ and she’d tell everyone anything--” He laughed, but quickly corrected his words when he realized how little sense they made,  “I mean, just with you coming over and being like ‘We were kidnapped by Hydra’ and…” He trailed off with a smile across his face.
Steve never knew when to quit -- maybe that was what attracted Bucky most! Throughout every injury and illness the poor boy seemed to contract, nothing got him down. He learned to draw through trembling hands, took on the meanest guys in town, and when the war came, he fought tooth and nail to be a part of it. It was anything he could do then even more when he decided that wasn’t enough.
The words caused his heart to ache. “You’re my best friend, Steve.” He swallowed the saliva collecting in his mouth, “My one and only.”
“Maybe,” insisted Steve, “Tony said he wouldn’t mind and said if we did have another one, James is a contender for a name.” He wrapped his arm around Bucky and squeezed.
“Honey, darling, dear,” Tony threw his goggles atop waves of black hair and made eye contact with the love of his life before laying on, “I need you out of my face. I need to stop feeling your breath on my neck while I work.”
“I don’t know anything about him? Are you dense or stupid? Maybe Hydra did more damage to your brain than we thought if you think, for even one second, that you know shit about Steve,” He clicked his tongue and finally released the side of the bed to take a step back, “No, no, you don’t know shit. Do you know how perfect our lives are right now? And you wanna ruin it for what, huh?”
Steve snorted, “Tony? What’s wrong with Tony?” His eyebrow perked up as he opened his eyes to glance at Bucky.
Their eyes met. It was rare on Bruce’s part, but eye contact was something Steve never failed at. His hand never touched the other man. Instead, it dropped to stroke the baby’s face as he squirmed to be freed.
And even with all the anger and sadness, Bucky couldn’t… just take it out on Steve. He exhaled all that emotion and simply said, “I’m tired. Real tired.” He shook his head and leaned back into the bed.
“You’re fine, we know you’re not hurting him … look at that little face!!” He laughed to which Peter giggled as well, “He just gets a little scared when Captain barks, it’s not your fault …”
Rhodey came over to sit across from Bucky, “Geez, I can’t even tell you how bad the back pain is today… fuck. Sam is calling me an old man over there, but I needed to sit down.” He shook his head.
Steve stood straight up, tucking Peter’s head into his chest. He stepped closer and murmured, “Bucky, what did you do?” He exhaled and still couldn’t raise his eyes high enough to look at James’ face. Eventually, his eyes lingered on the injured shoulder. He swallowed the saliva collecting in his mouth, beginning to shake his head from side-to-side as he got closer, “Why?”
“I’m gonna go start making some lunch for us, give me a holler if you need anything,” Steve was already off the bed, adding the sketchbook into his pile when Tony reached out.
“Bucky, you wouldn’t believe all the things they have words for nowadays… there’s more than two genders, did you know that?” He explained with excitement, “Oh--” Steve leaned in, “Also, don’t use the ‘g’ word any more, they call you guys ‘Romani’ now.”
“Steve… I missed you too,” It was his turn to close his eyes, to sink deeper into the warmth, “How did we end up here? How did you end up with… Stark’s kid?” He let out an audible gag to emphasize his displeasure.
“Was that yummy, baby? Was that a good lunch?” He cooed, swinging from right to left as he patted Peter’s back, “Why don’t we go check on your uncle Bucky, huh? I bet he oughta be awake by now, and I know he’ll love to see you.”
Steve sighed but didn’t object. He ran his hand across Tony’s back before creeping towards the entrance of the lab. His eyes never left Tony’s work, and the man could feel it so he added, “I love you, Steve! Goodbye!”
“Only if the model says so--” Steve pushed up and came over to kiss Tony’s face, “You’re so handsome, why would I ever wanna stop drawing you? Do you wanna see?”
Steve returned to the medical floor and welcomed himself into Bucky’s room, “Buck, hey. I know you’re tired, but I had to come when I heard you woke up.” He made his way over to the bed with a smile across his face. It faltered when he saw the look at his friend’s face, “What’s wrong, Buck? Are you okay?” He pushed his hair out of his face.
Steve laughed, “That’s not what I meant… I don’t know, he’s …” His words trailed off as he continued his sketch, tilting his head from side to side.
Thor put one of his giant hands over the mouth of the little scientist, “Tell Banner that you want beer and song and cheer!! Who wouldn’t want that for their birthday?”
Steve snorted, “That would be right, wouldn’t it?” He lifted Peter from his jumper and held him against his chest, “Should I assume we don’t have any updates?”
“Save it, buddy, you know, why don’t you just save it? You realize, you realize that you’re only here because my husband - my dear, sweet, overly forgiving husband - still has this…” A sharp inhale was taken, “Thing for you. This thing that I can’t explain. This thing that when I look in his eyes, I think he’d throw away everything for… you, and if it was up to me? I would’ve sold you down the river to SHIELD, to, to anyone who would’ve taken your sorry ass.”
“Are you all still harassing him?” Tony asked as he swung into the kitchen, “Hey, Buck! I know your birthday isn’t for a few days, and we were gonna keep this as a surprise, but after that little episode--” He whistled and from behind him emerged Sam with a black leash wrapped around his arm.
“Polyamorous… like, taking on multiple wives? My mother would have killed my father if he ‘double-dipped’.” Thor explained.
Bucky turned his head but after hearing Steve try to encourage words from his son, he asked, “Why doesn’t Peter talk yet?” He raised an eyebrow, “I always hear you two and Tony talk about it…” He pursed his lips.
“If that ain’t one thing that’s always been the same…” Steve shook his head, “Oh, Bucky, we’ll have to sit down and talk all about it ‘cause don’t get me wrong, people are getting better with certain things, helping others… but--”
But he wasn’t an uncle or a friend. Definitely not a hero and hardly a source of familial love. The kids always had Clint, and Steve always had Tony, and the Avengers had each other.
“You’re… Bucky, you’re my best friend too. You always have been, you know that… you know that, right?” Steve shifted and pulled Bucky’s face towards him, “I love you… I love you so fucking much, Buck, you get that, right?”
Despite neither of them believing Tony actually said that, “James Stark” was born just a couple years later.
“He’s a service dog, just like Captain, you’ve been through a lot,” Rhodey added, “Plus, you spend more time with Captain than any of us, we figured you could use a friend, might help, huh?” He reached out to pat Bucky’s shoulder.
Coulson and Fury came to share in the “Congratulations” and Coulson seemed reluctant to pass Peter on to any of his other uncles, aunts, and unofficial family members. Reed and Strange showed their faces too, but any conversation went in one ear and out the other.
“Your days as the big spoon are long gone, buddy,” He squeezed his friend close, “I can’t tell ya how much I missed ya-” For that moment, his accent slipped in as he squeezed his eyes shut.
Sam, who had caught the ass-end of the conversation, wrapped an arm around Steve and Rhodey, “Hey, old men… listen, I’m sure you’ve heard it a million times from all of us, but if you need anything? We’re here for you. I know we went back and forth a bit, Buck, but yeah.”
It was only to watch him. He felt all of their eyes prying, and their readiness to pounce made his heart beat faster. He pinned his metallic hand to his side, as if it would betray him and injure the child if he didn't keep it under control. All he could hear was his heart over the child babbling.
Steve added, “Autism is kinda a new thing for the two of us.” He explained to Rhodey, “Back in the day, they equated it to schizophrenia, and I think I remember hearing ‘autism’ go around right before we got frozen, but a lot of people thought it was made-up…” He shrugged.
After being kicked out, Steve had no choice but to return to another floor of the Avengers Tower. He chose the recreational floor and found it quiet. It made sense for the early afternoon as this was normally when training, missions, and naptime for whoever was watching the baby that day. Trying to nap with Peter would have been an uphill battle for the super soldier so after he laid his son down, he began pacing through the living room without purpose.
It was gone. His hand disappeared, and he lost his footing, falling backwards. Pain stung through his shoulder before spreading through the rest of his body, blood matting his side as he fell into the darkness.
Bucky Barnes survived. All he ever did was live another day. And each day he survived led him to this moment right now. In the Avengers Tower, he was given a bedroom. He didn’t have anything to put in it, but his best friend gave him a bed, a desk, a few photos, and plenty of drawings to pin up on the wall. It painfully lacked the personality he once had and felt like a reflection of Steve Rogers, rather than a room that belonged to Bucky Barnes.
Peter squirmed against his father. When not freed to play with the puppy or see his uncle, crying was the next, natural response. It started with whimpers and sniffles but ended with hiccups and whining.
Tony sucked in a deep breath, “Well, kiddo, let’s see--” He spread his legs out and set the baby down in-between them, dropping the sketchbook in front of them. His nose was already scrunched up as he started pulling the sheets apart.
Bucky gawked at the pair, amazed to hear that they had an ‘Asgardian’ wedding planned later this year… whatever that meant… maybe he should ask… but first, “I don’t need to be sang to and I don’t drink… anymore...”
Tony was the first of his friends to give birth. He would also be the first to argue that it was the worst thing he ever experienced and cut off anyone who tried to name a time that was worse. The feelings that came afterwards solidified his belief in how he felt an instant disgust over the newborn.
Rhodey put a hand on the ground and slowly dropped to his knees, pain shooting up his spine and causing a gasp to escape him, “Steve? Yeah, yeah, he’s fine, Bucky, why would you think he’s not?”
“Who am I? Who the fuck am I?” Tony suddenly slammed the metal he was examining down on the cart and grabbed the side of the medical bed instead, “I’m Captain America’s fucking husband, I gave birth to his child, do you think when I chopped off my tits and pumped myself full of testosterone the minute I got a doctor that wasn’t petrified of my fucking father that I thought, that I thought I’d ever let another man put a baby inside of me? I’m the one who’s been here. I’m the one who’s fixing the fucking mess you made to make him happy-”
“You know, he really reminds me of you,” Steve stared intently at his husband and child as he tried to get every freckle drawn in his sketchbook.
Steve would argue on his behalf (of course he did). He would remind his family that Bucky was a part of it, but the Winter Soldier knew better. He stared at his metallic arm and flexed his fingers as he listened to the chaos behind him: Rhodey’s “You’re getting so big!!”s atop Steve’s echoes of “Do you wanna say ‘dada’? ‘Dada’, ‘wawa’, come on, Petey--” and Tony reminding them, “He’s gonna be helping me in the lab before he starts talking, bet me on it.”
Thor swung around with a bright flash in his eyes, as if he couldn’t wait to talk about it, “Of course!! Our wedding is this winter on Asgard, you’re coming aren’t you?! Have you ever been off-world?”
Peter stared at his face, tugging at the long strands of hair that fell down on either side, and Bucky forced a smile. He didn’t mind the tugging and didn’t want anyone to think otherwise. He could feel them in his space, even if he couldn’t see them.
Thor knocked shoulders with the scrawnier man, “I love Bruce for who he is. Hulk and I are just friends. Very rambunctious friends who can’t seem to get out of each other’s way, but just friends.”
Wanda snickered, “I like the sound of that. I’ll tell you all about it too. Our father has an island of mutants.” Her attention was pulled away by Pietro hollering something in German. Bucky recognized it but he spoke too quickly for him to process what was said.
Steve lifted an eyebrow, “Sure, love, let me know what you think.” He smiled as he handed over the sketchbook before disappearing from the room.
“Look at this, Petey, daddy really knows how to draw, doesn’t he?” He cooed, eyes drawn into every detail that was included. When he arrived at the sketches of him while he was pregnant, he exhaled, “If I was gonna have a baby as cute as you, I’d do it again…”
“But it’s what year and people still think gay people shouldn’t be allowed to get married--” Rhodey pointed in Bucky’s direction, “People still think women belong in the kitchen.”
And it wasn’t mere attraction, either. Bucky was pretty sure he loved him and could spend the rest of his life with him. Regardless of the implications or struggles, even if it meant never having children or being able to publicly express their love... not that Steve would ever settle for that injustice.
“Oh, god, no,” Rhodey shot out, “I get you two aren’t familiar with it, but it’s considered a developmental disorder or, like, a learning disability. It means little Petey might have trouble socializing and learning how to communicate with others, which is why we don’t think he talks yet.”
The Hulk and Bruce Banner seemed to be one, finally agreeing on one thing, and it was enjoying being parents. The fucking Hulk enjoyed the concept of pregnancy more than Tony Stark, and it disgusted him.
Rhodey came in like he owned the place, kissing Tony on the lips before stealing a kiss from Steve too. No one stared or pointed weapons when he whisked Peter into the air and rocked from side-to-side with him. Instead, they laughed and reminded Bucky that he didn’t belong here.
The comms Steve is wearing are still deactivated; he, like an idiot, never turned them back on. He definitely can't turn them on right now. Tony can't tell him what to do privately. He's on his own for this one.
He remembered the way Tony had hugged Tiberius when they'd met, the way he'd held him like he'd never wanted to let him go. The way he'd stared at Tiberius like Tiberius was the only other person in the room. If Tiberius had been a woman, Steve thought, ruefully, he'd have seen it in an instant. This was how Tony behaved with people he wanted. Hell, with people he'd slept with. The two of them must have been lovers before. Steve was certain of that now. But Steve hadn't seen it then, because he'd been so sure that Tony was straight. And he'd been so very wrong. He was an idiot. He'd thought he'd known everything about Tony, all of his secrets, but Tony had never told him this. Tony had never trusted him with this.
"Your opinion on my love life notwithstanding, you're still an Avenger." Tony bit his lip. His hand came up again to rub at that same spot on his chest. Steve wondered what was wrong. He supposed it wasn't his business. "This will always be your home. No matter what you think about Ty. And even if you weren't an Avenger, your friendship still-- it still means a lot to me. You're always welcome here."
Steve was faster than Tony, because Steve was always faster than Tony, and Tony was carrying a fair amount of additional weight. So Steve was back on his feet, shield in hand, standing between Tony and Mordo while Tony pushed himself up. Tony was grateful for the protection. He wasn't actually sure how well vibranium was going to hold up against magic, but it was a nice gesture.
It was also a statement that Steve couldn't respond to without making himself sound like a goddamn bully. Steve suspected that this was the way this entire conversation was going to go. But at least it was only going to hurt his pride. It wasn't anything compared to what Tiberius was doing to Tony.
Tony was smiling while kissing him; the edges of his lips quivered. It was a beautiful sight. He switched from one side to the other, making sure nothing was neglected, leaning a little bit more of his weight on Steve as he did so, which also felt amazing. He could really get used to being with someone who was nearly his size -- hell, someone who was currently borrowing his clothes. There was an odd kind of joy in it, being so close to someone who was so alike. He'd never known it would be like this, either; it was a secret that had been here waiting for him all his life, until he was ready for it. He liked that.
Steve was no stranger to the media, over the years, but he was surprised at how much everyone seemed to be cheering them on. Every time Tony picked him up and flew with him in battle, there were a dozen blurry shots in the papers the next day, headlined with captions like LOVE IS STILL IN THE AIR FOR OUR SUPERHERO DUO. Steve had cut out and saved one of the pictures, a post-battle shot where they were walking toward the Quinjet, Tony's gauntleted arm wrapped possessively around his waist. He stuck it in his wallet.
Steve interrupted her. "We're both fine. Absolutely fine." Far better than fine, honestly. Not that he was about to tell Jan that. "I know I didn't report in. I'm sorry." What exactly was he going to say? "It was just that Tony was-- he was--"
He is immensely gratified when Steve immediately slides two big, hot fingers deep inside him, and he groans and clenches down around them. Steve's not fucking around. Thank God. Tony arches back toward Steve, as much as he can with Steve's other hand still planted on his back, desperate and needy. He wants this. He wants everything, right now.
Tiberius was bending over the woman, walking around her, talking as he was finishing the setup. "What you're looking at is the future of entertainment. With DreamVision, you don't watch movies anymore -- you're starring in them!" He beamed. "All the fancy gadgets here will connect you to your ViaStone cable box, which will also deliver a very small injection of nanites. Cutting-edge technology. Don't worry, they're perfectly safe. This is only a prototype. The final delivery mechanism will be much more user-friendly." He turned, using his body to shield from the audience what definitely had to be an IV after all. "You'll feel a small pinch, miss."
And, Tony being who he is, he can actually offer a counterargument. He always can, when Steve gets down about something.
, and that thought nearly undid him. Tony moaned again, a little louder, and then he went boneless in Steve's arms, shuddering against him, giving up every scrap of control, utterly trusting, all walls down. Steve knew then that he could have done anything he wanted, anything at all, and Tony would have let him. The realization was heady and terrifying all at once. This, this was how Tony had gotten hurt so many times.
Tiberius spread his hands wide. "He's newsworthy. He happens to be newsworthy. What do you want me to do, not report the news?"
He wanted to encourage Tony, so he reached down, intending to pet his hair, but when his hand was nearly close enough, Tony shivered in a way that didn't look good, practically flinching away. Okay, not that. He set his hand on Tony's shoulder instead, squeezed ever so slightly in praise, and Tony
Steve didn't let him finish. "Yes. Whatever you're thinking of, the answer is yes. It's the thing I want the most. Absolutely the most out of everything."
This was not a question Steve could ever answer honestly if he wanted to continue to be Tony's friend, and he definitely wasn't about to try to bluff his way through it while standing in his living room at three in the morning, holding a shivering Tony in his arms. This was too much. But he couldn't bring himself to lie, either.
"Oh," Tony says, brightly, "I'd have lied if it hadn't meant that. I'd have said something else was an octothorp. It wasn't like Ghost was going to know either. But yeah, no, it is. Pound sign."
Steve knew perfectly well that it was called Dungeons & Dragons; he just enjoyed the look on Tony's face every time he said it backwards.
Tony takes another step back as Steve hits the floor, and right now Steve's just glad Tony's staying out of the way. He's got this.
." Tony laughed, startled, and Steve continued. "He's gay -- or bi, maybe. He's something, anyway. They don't really use words like that. It was written in 1914, it said in the dedication. It's hard to say what Clive would have called himself now. But, anyway. He's gay, but... platonically. Because he thinks that's more noble. He's got some issues. He thinks men shouldn't be together, physically. He thinks it's wrong. He doesn't -- how'd you say it? -- he doesn't do any of that gay stuff. At all." That wasn't exactly the word Tony had used last night. But Steve knew Tony would get it.
He scratches lightly at Tony's scalp with his nails just to watch Tony shudder again. "You're doing so well," Steve tells him, and Tony, hungrily responsive to even the slightest bit of praise when he's like this, lights right up. Steve will never get tired of watching him smile. "It's supposed to feel good. Just like that. There you go."
It was convenient of him to split it all up by gender, Steve supposed. It put Tiberius in a category of his own.
"So," Jan said, briskly, as she hit a few keys on the closest terminal to bring up the current team roster. They were running larger than they often had; there were eleven names on the list. "Combat training. So I was thinking--"
"Shh," Steve breathed. "Shh, no, it's okay. I promise. Nothing to be sorry for. It's all okay." His voice cracked. "I'm just-- I'm just glad you're all right. That's what's important, okay? We'll figure everything else out later. I'm here to take you home. You're coming home with me, okay?"
Tony's hand is still in his hair. "But none of that is here, is it? No," he says, softly. "Here you're safe. Here you don't have to make those calls. Here you just have to do what I say. Just breathe. Just hold still and take my cock. Just like that."
"Now I know what to get you for your birthday, is all," Tony said, and he was never going to get tired of the joy on Steve's face when he wanted to give him things, even if it was immediately followed by Steve's
"All right," Steve said. "We'll table that for later, then." He'd try to solve one problem at a time. "Do you want something to eat or drink? If you want food I haven't got much here that doesn't come in a can, sorry, but someone somewhere will definitely deliver."
"Two for you," he said, sliding two pieces of cheese pizza onto Jan's plate. "And two for me," he continued, opening up the pepperoni. He glanced over speculatively at Steve. "And only one of each for Cap, because we all know he'll be too polite to take more until everyone else has had enough."
And he's still here, isn't he? Steve repeats this to himself. He's not abandoning Tony. He just needs a few seconds without the distraction, so he can listen as intently as possible. Then he'll switch it back on, after he takes Ghost down.
Steve thinks the two of them probably did it deliberately, Tony and Gregory, tried to sound different, the way they tried to look different. Steve's seen Tony in non-public situations quite enough to know that the camp isn't his natural voice, either. But even when he's not putting anything on, his voice is still different. Gentler.
Tony gets his hands splayed out behind him on the table to try to balance himself as he tips backwards, because Steve is still pressed against him, bending forward with him, following him down, mouthing urgently at Tony's collarbone, kissing his way down Tony's chest. His mouth is hot and hungry, and he's working at the buckle on Tony's belt with one frantic hand, and that's good, that's great, he's moving right along--
It's a paradox -- or perhaps irony -- that a man as relentlessly, effusively tactile as Tony spends so much time in a suit of armor, touching nothing except metal. Steve knows where all the emergency release catches in the armor are, and he peels it away piece by piece, setting each plate gently on the floor, because he knows by now exactly how to arrange it all where Tony will be expecting it.
That was good. That was really good. But, even so, Steve didn't know how much longer he could be here, like this, knowing that he was so close to everything he couldn't have. Knowing that the man Tony really wanted was one room away and that Tony would be going back to him.
Tony looked like he was never going to stop smiling. "I know we already established I wasn't dreaming," he murmured, "but now I'm starting to wonder again." His voice cracked. "I just-- you're here and you want this and you
"Oh, hey," Iron Man says, and the filtered voice sounds pleased and surprised at the same time. "You're still here."
Okay. He can figure this out. Octothorp. What does Tony mean by it? It's the safeword they've used when Tony needs to get out of bondage immediately. When he doesn't want to be touched by anything constricting. But no one's currently touching Tony. Steve's definitely not touching Tony.
He doesn't know much, but the scant details he does know -- disabling, life-threatening accident -- sure sound like they would lead to nights and nights of miserable dreams. Steve understands more than a little about that himself.
The mystery item was heavy for its size, probably solid stainless steel, and cool in his palm. The shape of it was familiar when he closed his hand around it, bulbous on one end, then narrow, spreading out into a flat flanged base, perpendicular to the rest of the object. Plug, definitely. Well, that was disappointing. A real pity. Tony wasn't going to be able to tell much about the owner from that.
If you are foolish enough to accept the oathbreaker to join your hunting party, then you need all the protection you need." Steven stated, forcing Anton to lean down before strapping the talisman under his tunic, causing Anton to blink his eyes in confusion.
"I see; so basically Stevie turned you and some of your friends into defenseless creatures because you refused the idea of Steve courting Tony, right?" Serpentine stated, causing Bucky to let out a sad beep and nod his cotton stuffed head, the action made Serpentine coo, almost stabbing Bucky from how cute he was in this form, but she resigned herself, she can't stab anyone/thing now, not when a new interesting mission showed up. "OK, I will help you this time, just this once, only if you told me about Tony a little bit more." Serpentine stated, getting more raging squeaks from Bucky; Serpentine couldn't help but give a smug smile at the angry Bucky let out at the mentioned Tony's name, this was going to be interesting.
"Steven… she is not the same person from your universe…" Peggy said in a quiet voice that was only meant for Steven's ears, and the blond man blinked then hummed at that, still not taking his eyes off of the woman, taking her in with narrow eyes, raising his eyebrow when he saw a wedding ring on her finger.
At hearing the word 'Tired' Peter seemed to get quiet and his eyes seemed to widen in shock like he couldn't believe what he was hearing; for Peter tired meant only one thing and that was 'Sick'. "Is it… is it the Chickenpox? Our teacher said that it's Chickenpox season, and two kids from the second grad were already sent home because they were sick." Peter's eyes were wide, they even filled with tears at the thought of Harley being sick with chickenpox; thinking about it now, maybe it wasn't one of Tony's brightest ideas, telling his son about Harley being 'Tired'.
"Yeah, it doesn't matter, water under the bridge and all that jazz, all forgiven, OK?" Tony waved his hand, wondering why Steven was looking at him with this strange look, that was making Tony's skin tingle, and he doesn't even know if it was a bad tingle or a good tingle.
"Your little sister, I am sure Peter and you would be grateful that she has a room of her own very soon," Tony stated, laughing when Harley scrunched his nose in confusion before skipping to go and check on the big giraffe and lambs plush with interest painting his eyes.
"I thought I made it clear that you are not welcomed into my property," Tony stated, holding into his daughter tightly, his action making his daughter become as quiet as a mouse as she took in the strange man and woman in front of her. Part of Tony was still displeased that Peggy and Bucky showed themselves after all these months, wondering what they wanted now of all times, another part of Tony, the part he buried deep, gave a sad pang as his eyes fell on the two people he considered a family.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, anxiety, near mental break down, maybe a little bit of fluff? And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"I am looking for the rest of my people; do you know where they are housed?" Steven asked which made the Alpha blink at that and nodded his head.
"Love, you will do amazing, I just know that; it's just like taking care of Peter, and you did amazing with our boy." Steve hummed, kissing Tony's forehead a few times, smiling happily when the Omega seemed to relax in his arms. "I am going to talk with Harley; I will get his story and tell him about the adoption. What we did right now is not conventional so Harley will probably need to return back to the clinic before we complete the adoption process." That got a sigh and a nod from Tony who still had a frown on his face, hiding his face in Steve's chest muttering something that even Steve didn't hear.
"Nah, it's OK. Now I'm free of the stone's control I want to go out and explore Midgard. I can say that the twenty-first century is one of the most interested ones I witness and I want to see all it offers, so take your time." Steve waved the prince off, gaining a small smile from the huge blond.
When he was finally calm down enough, and the poor doll destroyed; Tony turned to the Avengers who were gazing at him with something akin to fear in their eyes, even Clint who was squirming like a fly on a spider web was quiet. "Where is he?" Tony asked through gritted teeth, his eyes going from one person to another, daring them not to answer him or they will face their doom like the poor toy, whose remains were all over the place.
"So… what it's like spending the first night in here?" Natasha asked after serving Tony most of the food, which made Clint whine only to get his head slapped by Natasha, who glared at her husband, that action made Tony let out a laugh before he turned to his food, letting out a happy moan after the first bite, Angie was really a queen in the kitchen, her food was the best Tony has eaten in his life.
"Steve?" Tony whispered against his husband's temple, breathing Steve in; Steve's scent intertwined with Tony's, making the Omega float a little. In his arms, Steve shivered; Tony nuzzles him, holds him steady, and anchored him in turn hoping that his mate was feeling as happy and content as Tony was. "You really are the love of my life." Tony whispered softly like he was sharing a secret with Steve that no one will know.
"Calm down a little! I am sure we can reach an agreement! Hey! Don't shake me, I will bite!" The raccoon hissed and growling only to let out a whimper when Steve looked at him harshly… it seemed that Steve's reputation of being the harshest and cruelest star there was precede him… a reputation Steve gained after being abandoned by his people.
It was only a few moments later that Tony saw Bucky, the older man holding his tool kit ready to go through the crowd only to drop it in shock when he saw the state Tony was in. "Good lord, kid, what the fuck happened?" Bucky rushed to check him over, and it was then that Tony lost it and start sobbing uncontrollably, which caused the man to shush him gently, pulling him in his arms running his hand on Tony's back until the teen finally calmed down.
Ever since Tony snapped out of his feral state after making sure that Steve and Peter were OK; the Alpha was distant, he was dazed and unfocused most of the time, and he was never there anymore. Peter was noticing Tony’s absence, he was noticing and was probably blaming himself because of Tony’s recent behavior, that behavior which was gritting on Steve’s nerves, because where was his Alpha?
Tony looked at his phone biting his lips as he gazed at the number on the screen, it had been a few hours since Peter and Steve left to their apartment, leaving Tony to overthink everything that happened today, and he couldn't stop his mind from wondering at the 'What if's that refused to leave him alone. Tony sigh his gaze returning to his phone swallowing a little as he gathered his courage, and sent the text he wanted.
And then he runs… not caring about wearing only a pajama pants, he run, nor caring that he left his team but not really his team worried, he run, hoping that horrible image will vanish from his mind, he runs, begging the God to stop torturing him, he runs, hoping to feel normal by the end of his quest, he runs, not caring that it starts storming and the rain was falling on him, that it so cold that it could have been needles.
As much as Tony wanted to play it off and tell Pepper that it was her imagination (The camera feed didn't show them anything, just Pepper tripping and falling down) Tony knew that this was unfair to his friends, especially when the two of them just wanted to help him; besides, it wasn't like Tony couldn't run toward the lake, so far, the monster living deep down tolerated him and his girl, he was sure that it would take care of the ghost… unless it was the monster and it was planning on kicking him out of the house.
Everyone was staring at him with wide eyes and dropped jaws, and Tony doesn't know if he should laugh at their experiences or grumble at the lack of any statement, even a sassy one; where is Steve when you need him? Knowing Steve he will probably suggest something like
"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!" Tony couldn't help but chant under his breath, he was one second away from fainting; this was bad, so, so bad, nightmares bad, worse than his parents turning to zombies bad! Tony wondered if he can turn around and run away, but as luck will have it, Steve will probably catch him even before Tony shift a muscle.
But looking at this modern and cozy house that emits love and family, it made Bucky wonder… what will have happened if he asked Steve to be his mate? If he just suck it up and pretend that everything was perfect, he knows that he finds Steve attractive, so sleeping with him would be no problem, and he probably wouldn't have met Stark, the two of them will probably live here too, raising the pup that Steve had without the Omega struggling to raise him all alone… but he knows Steve, he knows that Steve will hate himself if he felt that Bucky was with him out of obligation not out of love, he knows that the Omega will leave preferring for his heart to break than force Bucky to live in their sham of a mating, he knows that Steve was gentle and amazing and loving and that he deserves more than what Bucky or even Stark was able to give.
"How old do you think I am son of Odin?" Steven asked which made Thor look panic for a second, shuffling around like he was struggling to discover the answer to the question. "Don't overwork yourself, I'm 2500 years old." Steven can observe how Thor's eyes grow in disbelieve, confusion painting his eyes, perhaps wondering how such a youthful star like him doesn't glow. "In my world, I'm still considered young; young enough to burn like your Sol." Thor looked down at the ground, knitting his eyebrows before peeking at Steven once more.
"Well, Harley only starts getting better after Peter and him made friends; if you only could see them, the two of them are attached at the hips." Betty gave a chuckle as she crosses her arms her face becoming soft as she remembered. "Oh, Harley seemed to warm up to Steve too; after Peter introduced him to Harley, it seemed that your husband became attached to the boy, same as Harley, the boy only talk with Steve and Peter, sometimes me if I was lucky." Betty shook her head turning to the source of screaming to see Bucky chasing the kids, causing them to shriek and laugh as they tried to get away from him.
"Then what am I supposed to do Steve? Tell me what am I supposed to do when every time I pass this room I remember nothing but the pain that… that baby caused me! What am I supposed to do?" Tony begged the Alpha, hoping that Steve knows what to do, that the Alpha will give him directions, that Steve will tell him how to make this pain in his chest stop!
"You will forgive me… just like that?" Steven asked with wonder in his voice, which caused Tony to blink his eyes a few times and shrug, what was he supposed to do? Hate the guy for being an asshole? If that was true, then Tony would hate half the people living on earth.
"No Kung Fu, until after breakfast!" Steve called as he shook his head at the two that started mock fighting and laughing, his heart pounded in happiness in his chest, as he turned around and headed to the kitchen, hearing the happy squeals and laughter as his boy rolled around the floor with his father.
The next day, all of their friends showed up; every one of them, from his friends to Steve's they all were in their house crowding the place with their presence, Tony can say he has met many interesting people that day, from the Odinsons brothers who took one look at him before clapping Steve on the back, though the one named Loki, just looked at Steve like the man commit suicide. To the Wilsons, which made both Tony and Sam's eyes widen when they noticed each other, they tried to hide their discomfort from everyone else, but as always Steve noticed, and gave Tony a reassuring smile, causing him to relax. To Steve's manager Fury, who was scary as fuck with the glare he sends everyone within a meter from his sight, Tony made sure to smile and wave to the man.
Fury narrowed his eyes at the sight in front of him; the Alpha doesn't know if he should laugh at the scandal that took place in front of him or croon at the triumph he was feeling when he was proven right and that the Stone clan did hide something. Fury was not usually this expressive with his feelings, but the Alpha and the Stone clan had a long history of disagreeing on many things, and one of them was the king's bonding within one of their clan.
"We are here." Tony said, pointing to an empty space in the parking lot, which Steve went to gladly and parked the car, everyone starts heading toward the clinic when Steve secured the car, Peter chattering with Tony as he skipped beside the Omega, which made the young man chuckled at that and nods his head to show the pup that he is interested. "Hello, Darcy." Tony called as he entered the clinic, waving happily to the receptionist, which made the woman squeal happily as she called his name.
Half an hour past with the three of them bickering and Natasha threatening Tony with death if he starts working without her being there to help, it was Clint who gave the olive branch by saying they will start the work once they brought in the mattress which should only take half an hour top if they went fast, which shut Natasha up.
"Does that… does that mean I have to go back to the clinic?" Harley asked, curling on himself as he tried to make himself smaller than he already was, he was probably afraid of going back to the clinic and being forced to get adopted by someone else, or maybe he was even thinking about his punishment for running away.
"Please…" Steve remembers pleading with a shaky voice. "Please Buck… if you want to kill me just do it… please don't torture me anymore…" Steve sobbed beside Bucky's grave…
Whispers and near shouts were heard all around the village, causing Steven to furrow his brows as he gazed at the crowd that formed near the village square, no doubt surrounding the king and his party. Tilting his head, Steven tried to listen carefully to what the people around him were saying, a frown made itself known on his face when he heard the snipped conversation and shock exclamation… what happened?
The footsteps got louder and louder, walking on the barren land below; the person who dared to walk on this forbidden land, gazed around the place, pale blue skin and cyborg body parts reflecting the deem light, informing whoever was waiting for her that she was there.
He doesn't know when did the name 'Little star' turned into 'My star' but the first time Anton called him by that, he remembered shining so brightly that Anton smiled happily like he knew! Like he knew that the star understands him and was listening to him, it made him so happy, and he couldn't imagine living in a world without Anton in… it was then that he knew…
"I understood," Steve said, making Howard sniff at that and lean on the wall behind him. "I promised you, Howard, I promise you on my mother's honor, I will protect them both to my dying day." That made Howard sighs and nods his head and straightens himself.
"Magna, Jamti, look what we have here!" The king said with a burst of booming laughter as he went toward his… whatever they were… and greeted them, getting smirks in return from the two, Steven doesn't know how long he stood in his place holding his son, but it was more bearable then talking with the king, especially when his friends stood beside him and refused to let him go, Margaret even clutched the sleeve of his tunic, which made Steven give the woman a reassuring smile.
"You already met Grandma Sarah." Harley nodded when he heard Sarah's name, clutching Tony's hand tightly when they reached Howard who was gazing at the boy with furrowed brows. "Well, this is my Dad, your Grandpa, Dad, this is Harley." Tony smiled as he introduced the two of them, his smile widening when Howard kneeled and shook Harley's hand.
"What are you doing, Tony?" a curious voice behind him asked, making Tony blink and turn his sight to Steve, who was sitting on the sofa with Peter who was sleeping on his lap. It had been a few months since the star told him about the reincarnation process and him being one of the few souls who had the honor of going through it, a few months since Steve finally warmed up to Tony that the two of them can be called friends, maybe best friends thanks to Peter who always seemed to break the ice between them and caused them to become closer, few months since Steve accept being called by the short version of his name, and not by Steven, even when Peggy and sometimes Bruce call him by his full name.
That's how Tony ended up at Angie's diner, thinking his life through and pouting like five years old who was scold by their mother. It wasn't that Tony wasn't grateful for everyone for being considering really, but isn't that an overkill? I meant, he was only in the town for four months, but everyone in the town does nothing but make sure that Tony rest or worse give him free stuff even when he wanted to pay for them, sometimes it's just too much; Rhodey on the other hand, was happy with this high life, even Pepper seemed to agree with him, which was not cool.
Steve was down the stairs, nearly flying into the living room, “Bucky, are you okay?” He dropped to his knees beside Rhodey with no hesitation, reaching out to grab the man’s face, “What happened?”
Bucky stared into the love of his life’s blue eyes with his mouth agape, “I’m okay, Steve. I… I don’t know what happened, but I’m okay.” He looked between Steve and Rhodey, nodding, “Can you take Peter from me?” He held him out for whoever wanted to grab him and slowly stood up when he was in Rhodey’s arms.
Bucky swallowed back and leaned forward, groaning when his back cracked about four times. He reached down and wrapped his organic arm around the toddler before yanking him into his lap. It took less than three minutes before the Avengers brought their kitchen party into the living room.
“He’s just… kinda an asshole. And privileged as they come, you know?” He shifted in his grip and looked up at Steve.
Forgiving himself wouldn’t be an option, but killing himself wasn’t either. He couldn’t leave Steve to mourn him and carry on telling his tale as if he was some sort of hero. No, he had to prove that everything Steve said about him wasn’t lies. He had to live…
Steve wanted him to be his best friend like he always was. He wanted him to be an uncle to his child and an integral part of his family. Tony wanted him to be in his family’s life. He wanted him to be an Avenger and stand beside Steve as a symbol of good.
And just like that, Bucky melted. He let his body relax entirely in Steve’s embrace with a deep sigh, “When did you get so massive? Where’s that little kid from Brooklyn who would swim in my coat?”
Bucky swallowed back again and found it too easy to get lost in those beautiful, blue eyes. He exhaled before suddenly pushing up against him.
Eventually, Steve swiped the newborn away, “Don’t you all think this is a little much?” He chuckled and found his way to Tony’s bed. He didn’t try to hand Peter over, instead resting the child on his chest, “I’ll get the crowd out of here-- I’m sure the both of you want to rest.”
Everything was different now. He lived in the Avengers’ Tower, trapped watching some rich guy kiss up on his best friend. Everyone watched him like a hawk as if he’d snap any day now, he could barely hold the baby without someone's gun pressed against his head. It wasn’t like that for Tony’s best friend, Rhodey.
Rhodey laughed, “You sound so much like Tony. Pepper and I do the arguing and Tony rallies behind us.” He snickered, “Steve’s told me so much about Peggy, and I gotta say, I’m sorry for your loss, guys… you know, we talk about it a lot, but being displaced by time like that? My heart is in it with you two.”
It took days… and weeks… and months after that. It took sleeping for two day intervals. It took talking to Bruce as if he was his therapist. It took puppy-dogging T’Challa when he returned to America with a baby named Azari. It took having to look Peter in the eyes and actually take care of him instead of leaving it to Steve. It took Strange telling him “I’m not that kind of doctor”, and most of all, it took time.
Wanda laughed and propped up across from Bucky, “He’s kinda obnoxious, isn’t he?” but she was quick to leave too, and it was now that Bucky realized one thing …
He looked at it as if it would turn against him any day now. What if it hurt Peter? What if it hurt Steve? What if it hurt any of the Avengers that were trying their damnedest to make him feel as if he had a place on their team?
“Basically!” popped Steve, who played into the joke, “I can play CandyCrush on the treadmill every morning so he gets sex every night - that’s just how it goes, Buck.”
Bucky was right. He hated being right. Why couldn’t his paranoia be all in his head? No, not only did Steve have to go get married, but he had to get married to some asshole. He should’ve known Stark was no good, and he scrunched up his nose when he heard the door open.
Rhodey laughed, “It’s complicated, it’s not cut and paste and not every autistic person is the same… it’s a spectrum, and you two knew Tony’s dad, Howard, he wanted Tony to be ‘normal’--” He did air quotes with his fingers, “So, Tony was forced to learn to cope and hide a lot of his quirks, but everyone loves it because one of his fixations is all the tech.”
He leaned back into the cushion and exhaled heavily with his new dog jumping onto the couch beside him and laying down. He put a hand on his head and closed his eyes.
Tony's gaze softened, and he practically melted into Steve's embrace, with an amazed smile. "Yeah? You do?"
Tony's sobs seemed to have slowed. Thank God. "You know," Tony said, and he almost sounded like himself again, "I wasn't actually expecting you to have an answer for that."
And Tony just... shrugged. "Ty and I are different people, though," he said. "I mean, you're right, I probably wouldn't, but I also have no interest in owning a media empire. He faces different ethical challenges than I do."
"Honestly?" Tony asked, and there was a flicker of some complicated emotion in his eyes, as if he was worried Steve would judge him for wanting it. "On top of me."
Steve steps in, breathing out as the door locks behind him. Tony's not going to let anyone interrupt them. A different man setting up this scene might have arranged it so there would be interruptions, the potential for public humiliation, but that's not what Tony wants, and that's not what Steve needs. So here they are, just the two of them, safe and secure.
They'd headed back to the mansion after lunch, and the first person they'd told was Jan. She'd been thrilled for them, and also not really all that surprised. Since she was one of the few Avengers who knew Tiberius personally, she'd gotten the entire story. Including the part where Tony had been dating Tiberius. And she'd been shocked by the truth about Tiberius, just like Steve had been, but mostly she'd been happy. For them.
"If you have come to look for Steve, then don't, he is dead; now, I want you out of my house or else…" Tony hissed, already ordering Jarvis mentally to deploy one of the suits, if that Loki character wasn't leave his house in the next few seconds, Tony was going to throw him from the top of his tower and watch him become a splat on the sidewalk.
"Am… fine… just nightmares…" Steve murmured in a muffled voice, trying to calm himself as his lover's hand ran through his hair, calming a part of Steve that he didn't know needed this. Slowly, it took only a few more minutes before Steve finally calmed down, the vision of the dark future going to the back of his mind as he focused his sense on his lover…
"Yes, father." Nebula said, trying to stop a shiver from racking her body as the man sitting on the throne shifted, like he was ready to attack, that more than ever made her say the next world carefully. "The reports say that he is probably alive, only his physical body was abandoned, but his astral one is out there somewhere." Nebula nearly let out a loud sigh of relief when she saw her father relax in his seat at the words she uttered.
"How do you do it?" Tony asked that night as he looked at his room's ceiling, his baby was snuggling in his arms snorting contently as he suckled on his thumb, Tony didn't really know if the Alpha was asleep, but he really did want the Alpha to tell him what to do, how he could do it? Talk with his therapist, and then ignoring how it felt draining after he returns home, how can he just… not care about it?
"Margaret." He nodded to the brown-haired woman, acknowledging her, which made the woman smile happily and walk to him taking the brush from his hand, and run it gently on his hair, humming under her breath. "How is James?" His heart flutter at that name, a happy smile taking over his face, mirrored by his companion, as she stopped her brushing and starts braiding his hair like how he loved doing, instead of the normal fashion of holding it high in a bun.
"Oh, don't worry nothing happened just a feud between us that lasted eleven years and me ending it with a punch, besides, that good for nothing Alpha had it coming." Steve said as he went to the kitchen planning on sitting the table for dinner, a smile on his face as he felt Peter tugging his pants pleading with him to tell him how he knew Mr. Stark, which made the Omega give a small smile hoping the sadness in his eyes wasn't showing, but one thought that struck him made him chuckle happily…
"I'm certain this is nonsense. Even a star of your statue and wisdom can still burn brilliantly, for stars grow wiser and stronger with age." Thor offered, his bewildered and uncertain words made a fleeting smile to grace Steven's lips, how naïve of the son of Odin to seek to comfort him, thinking that he was older than he was, if only he knew that not age had taken Steven's shine, but loving a mortal that was standing on the same room as him.
"Sucks to hear that, what grade are you, Peter? After all, a smarty like you is sure in the eleventh's grad." Tony said which got a giggle from Peter as he shook his head at that, causing Tony to hum happily as he finished cooking the chicken and put it in a bowl and checked on the pasta.
"Because Peggy and Angie already adopted you, I'm more of the uncle who was forced to babysit you." Steve said making another turn smiling a little when he heard Natasha giggle at that. "Aren't you supposed to be with Clint, right now?" Steve asked, making Natasha snort at that. If there was one thing that everyone agrees on, is that Natasha having a small (Huge) crush on Clint, the adrenalin-addict Omega… it was the only reason that she didn't kill him right away when he tried to flirt with her… like she nearly did to any other idiot who flirted with her.
Steve heard and felt Thanos thrash in pain, letting out a pained gasps as he tried to throw Steve away from him, but Steve held tightly to Thanos refusing to let him go. When Steve felt Thanos trying to reach for the power of the Infinity Stones, Steve reached out to the Space Stone, pulling the power to strengthen his core but also making it more unstable, more explosive… the first warning pulse Steve felt, made the star close his eyes and tighten his arms around Thanos' mid-section, growling as he finally managed to expose his core enough for it to burn everything in its way.
The king should know that because of him not coming to answer Steven's plea, because of him taking the information about Johann and disappearing for six years, two of Steven's children died because of him being a sleazy oathbreaker with that Beta of his, and because of that Steven will blame him till the end of all lives and until Ragnarok is here. "I never found your letter." The king answered in a sure voice and Steven wanted to scream at the lie the king dared to feed him in his face. "The Beta you were talking about, we found him in one of the ports a day and a half journey away from the Hydra king's palace. The Beta claimed that he managed to escape and in his escape, he stole those scrolls… there was no child with him…" Steven's lips trembled at these words he heard, his breath hitched and he moved against his will until he was holding into the furs of the king's shirt, gazing in the king's eyes searching for his lies… only to find no lie upon gazing at the Alpha for a long time.
The next hour was draining for both Steve and Peter because Steve was forced to see the hospital perform a lot of tests on the pup, and he wondered if they were too much for his baby, he remembers having to hold Peter tightly when they had to draw blood from the boy, and he won't fault the small boy if he develops a phobia from the needles, he especially had to calm his child down when they start drawing blood from his feet, because they couldn't access his blood from his arms and hands, Peter nearly went hysterical when he saw Tony, which ended up with Steve screaming at the Alpha to get out, ignoring the pained and hurt look, as he tried to calm the sobbing boy down… it was always the hardest part, someone other than Steve being with them, and it probably hurt Peter too, considering that he doesn't want anyone to see him like this…
So after checking if he was injured and discovering that he has survived by a miracle, and the only thing he got was a small concussion and a sprained wrist, Tony nearly hooted in triumph (His luck didn't leave him after all, it just held back for this occasion!) in the end, Tony checked on his suit once more before standing up and leaving it behind, he was tired from dragging that thing with him since last night, so he decided to leave it and check the crater out.
Steve's lips twitch up at this and shook his head with a sigh as he saw the pup running down the aisle and took candies from the shelves to put them in their car, though he didn't realize that Steve was returning the candies. "Only when my best friend comes to visit, I start to think that he only visits to make my pup hype on candies." Steve explained which got a thoughtful hum from the Omega.
Steve smiled as he saw that the phone was his, it seems like Natasha had finally fixed the phone. "Why don't you look at that…?" Steve teased the woman making her roll her eyes, but smile at the same time; she went to give Angie and Peggy a hug before leaving the room. "Where is the pup?" Steve asked Jarvis who was waiting near one of the windows in the private room.
"Yeah, well, I'm not Bucky, I don't know how you did it in the dark ages, but things are different now." Tony stated, pulling his hands away from Steve. "With how crazy you are, I wonder how the serum worked with you being messed up in the head." Tony muttered to himself, testing how his legs were able to hold him as he starts walking trying to find a way out.
"Y-yes… t-thank you, Sir…." Steve's voice cracked as he gave the newspaper back to the man, turning away and start wheeling himself as far away as he can while ignoring the man behind him that seemed to want him to stop. Steve doesn't know how long he wheeled himself around Brooklyn, he was dazed half of the time and when Steve finally snapped out of it, he saw himself in Central Park which ended with Steve giving a confused noise as he looked around, wondering how an hour and a half went without him noticing.
"What is it, baby? What are you seeing?" Tony mumbled, turning to gaze at the lake, his grip on his daughter tightened as he saw that no one was there, which made Tony's tense muscle relax and turn to his Morgan who was pouting a storm. "See, sweetheart, no one." Tony hummed as he kissed his baby on her forehead, his lips twitching into a huge smile at the pout that dominated his baby's face. "What do you think about going to Angie? I am sure she would give you a tasty treat if we went now." Tony smiled, trying to shake the unease he starts feeling the second he turned his back to the lake.
"What is your price?" The witch asked not even taking a second to think things through; truly, she was nothing but a pitiful child, a child that wouldn't survive being beside Thanos more than a day before she was killed, and by then not even her magic was going to help her. Nebula had to sigh through her nose, hating herself more than ever for what she was doing.
"It's so pretty if I didn't know better I will think that da Vinci draws it!" Tony said as he looked at the stick figures with an amused smile on his face. "We are going to hang it in our bedroom as soon as we get back home, what do you think?" Tony asked which made the pup squeal in happiness and hug Tony tightly which made the Omega let a happy hum and breath in the pup's scent calming himself down.
"Thank you…" Tony end up saying which made Bucky nod his head and head to the door. "J, make sure to use my bank account to pay all of Steve's debts, especially the hospital ones, and get me an appointment with Anna, she is the best Oncologist in America, also call Jarvis and tell him we are booking a private wing in his hospital…" Bucky only pause a little to hear some of Tony's orders, but hearing them made the Alpha let out a sigh of relief, there was hope for Steve and his pup, maybe it was wrong of him to go behind Steve's back to talk with Tony, maybe he shouldn't even have told the Alpha and just helped Steve on his own after all the Omega wanted to stay as far away from his Alpha, maybe him meddling will end up breaking everyone hearts, but maybe…
"Please, don't scream you will wake the baby if you do," Steven said as he raised his head from his sketchbook, giving Tony what he hoped to be a comforting smile… something that would have worked if the person sitting in front of him wasn't a ghost who died thirty years ago (A friendly ghost at that, but still a ghost) Tony bit his lower lip as he took in the ghost beside him; the ghost looking more firm than he was yesterday if that was even possible. "Hi, my name is Steve Rogers, what's yours?" The teen in front of him asked and Tony swallowed as he blinked his eyes, not knowing what to do.
Tony always hated the days he had to go to his therapy, they weren't many now as they were before, reduced to two times a week instead of three, but still, it was draining, it left Tony hollowed, and it made him cry every night when he was sure that Peter nor Steve will hear him, because he was always so, so tired, when he was forced to remember every detail that Dr. Ross made him remember, it was like a rotten wound that wasn't given the chance to heal (Never given and never would) always getting picked on over and over until there was nothing but a bleeding mess.
"How did you… what change your mind?" Tony end up asking looking at the Alpha that smiled at him and then pointed at the room that had children running and laughing inside of, Tony turned his attention inside and he smiled as he saw his baby, sitting on one of the round table chairs and was drawing something, his little tongue sticking out as he was trying to focus.
"But he hurt Mama!" His baby screamed, big tears rolling from his eyes, making Tony sob at that… he hurt his baby… his baby who was trying to defend him, his baby who pushed Stane away from him, his baby who was too noble trying to act like Captain America and nearly getting killed.
The scene seemed to have attracted the attention of everyone, and everyone shifted away with such discomfort, some Omegas gazed between Steven and the group of men before they ran away, leaving Steven alone, but the Omega only scowled and turned around continuing his path not in the mood for the pointless fight that will take place if he stayed. "What? Running away already? We just wanted to talk to you about what your mate did!" Screaming and snarling could be heard as they called after Steven, which the blond man ignored, and that got him a growl from the men behind him who seemed to have followed him.
"Yours what?" Tony was sure he shrieked these words as he gazed at the woman with wide eyes. "You are an Addams too?" Tony was defiantly shrieking, he was so sure he was going to have a heart attack; it wasn't enough that he has one crazy Addams in his hands, the universe decided to send him another. "Oh hell to the no, no! One Addams is enough I don't need another! Shoo! Whoever you are crazy Steve's cousin whom I'm sure is the witch he talks with pride about, shoo!" Tony shooed the woman, hoping that she will leave him alone, and he was 3000% sure that the woman is that 'Wednesday' that Steve always goes on and on about, he was even sure that she cursed him with bad luck just now.
Clint, on the other hand, wanted to learn about what his counterpart in Steve's universe was up to, it made Steve smile a little as he remembered Clint who was managing the orphanage in his farm. Steve always laugh when Clint flutter around his bed asking questions after questions like if he mated with someone, or if he had kids, or if he was still the best archer in the whole world, it made Steve grateful that Clint was this cheerful in every universe.
It started like any normal day, Steven going on his morning run around the mansion after calling goodbye to Peggy who was still glaring at Rogers, enjoying the nature he saw and thanking Tony for the mansion being far away from the bustling city, it wasn't the Avengers compound, but it was better, homer in a way. It all started when Steven returned from his morning run, intending to go and cook some breakfast, wondering who was awaken at this time other than Rogers and Peggy, humming to himself as he went to the kitchen.
Frigga turned to him, her gaze searching and full of curiosity, it felt like hours, but the truth it was only a few moments long. Frigga smiled then, her eyes sparkling and wonder was shining in them, it seemed like whatever she was looking for she found at this moment. "I know you will, after all, the Ancient One, gave you his blessings." Frigga said these words with pride and love shining brightly.
The Viking Chief's expression went from peaceful to thunderous in an instant, it made Steve wake up and glance around, he was too far in his fear and terror that he didn't catch the sentences exchanged between them, the man stepped forward, towering over Johann and causing the king to cower in fear. "The Omegas' from my people were violated, their husbands stripped apart, their children burned alive while their pets roasted on spikes to feed your murderers' bellies, and you are telling me." he stepped even closer, furious dark brown eyes pining Johann in place and making him shiver "They were murdered just because… you thought… I did not exist, and therefore, you found yourself in the right to allow innocent people to die?" Johann stuttered his response, which made the Iron King's expression darken even more
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of angst, Tony finally apologizing, and Fury is here! All reviews are appreciated...
These words cause Peggy to growl and step toward the pair of glasses that were lying on the bench, scowling at it with deadly eyes, "And why not? Steven is out there. If we don't act now, he could be harmed or worse! Isn't your primary protocol to care for him?" Peggy snapped at the A.I. standing over the still glasses, if it was any other time, Tony would have thought the whole ordeal was extremely ridiculous, with his aunt giving a pair of glasses her 'I'm disappointed with you!' stare.
The question was enough to make Steve choke, and Tony wasn’t even sure if he meant to say that. Sure, Peter wasn’t as difficult to deal with as some other babies were, but what were the chances of having two mild-mannered children?
He tried to soothe Peter, and the fit eventually lasted long enough that he pulled a chair over. Not once did he consider leaving Bucky’s side to set the baby down for a nap upstairs. Instead, he lulled his son to sleep to the sound of the monitors.
Steve forced his way right into the conversation, “There is nothing wrong, Thor, with dating two people as long as both are aware. They have a word for that, you know? Polyamorous, aren’t most gods polyamorous?” He narrowed his eyes and Thor squinted.
He shifted Peter onto one of his hips and headed to the medical floor in the tower, heading right into Bucky’s room like a man whose husband hadn’t told him not to.
Steve’s eyes went wide with his lips twitching in a pout. Deep down, he knew it must have been hard to work with his chest pressed up against his back, but hearing it was different…
Bucky found it hard to focus on exactly what Rhodey was saying and shook his head, “I’m not gonna hurt Peter. I wouldn’t do that, Steve’s my best friend, this is basically the whole world to me--” But Rhodey put a hand up and shushed him.
But before Bucky could retaliate, Tony threw both his hands into the air. He went for the door with his own voice rising above the other man’s shouts, “You can wait for a new damn arm, you hear me?! I’m going to spend time with my husband and child! Mine, mine, mine.” And he slammed the door on his way out.
Tony soaked in the physical affection that he received. He moved his hands along his sides, back, and eventually landed them right on his ass as their kisses deepened. A whine slipped from his throat when it finally came to an end.
Bucky didn’t know whether to smile or not. He looked down at his plate that he had been picking at for the better part of an hour.
Steve spoke when Bucky didn’t, “I know how much you love dogs, Buck, and everyone thought it’d be a good idea. We want to help you adjust a little better…” He wrapped an arm around his friend.
Half-toddling and half-crawling came baby Peter into the living room. He grabbed one of his Uncle Bucky’s boots and used it to stand up. He looked up at him with big, ol’ eyes and smacked his knee when he wasn’t immediately picked up.
Bucky wanted to laugh. He should laugh… Steve saying that combination of words was hilarious, but he scoffed, “You know you deserve better, right?”
“Steven Grant -- you are unbelievable! No, don’t even, nope. Get out of here! You are gone! Out, out, out!”
“Yeah, Buck, we’re here for you, we all are, just like we were with Steve…” Rhodey held Sam’s hand and nodded with a smile.
Steve pawned Peter off on Sam and nodded, “Sounds like fun!” He stood from his seat and swung around the table to kiss Bucky on the cheek, “Oh, did I mention we have dibs on James for the next baby?”
Hell, they came as a pair ever since they met on the streets when they were hardly taller than the fire hydrant that acted like a water cooler in an office building -- the place all the children circled and socialized.
A laugh erupted from Tony, “What if we did those inappropriate things right now?” He tried to pull the super soldier back as he climbed off his lap, “Come on, I’m down for inappropriate--” He cooed, “Let him sleep, come back to me. Caa~aap-”
It was one wire after another with his teeth gnawing into metal plating. His eyes were squeezed shut with tears staining his cheeks. Time was beginning to escape him as he failed to remember the last time he cried. It felt like so long ago and even longer as his body was engulfed by flames. He felt his heart trying to escape his rib cage as his body temperature rose. It was a fight to not pass out from pain, but even with trembling hands, Bucky Barnes persisted.
It was after lunch while Steve shuffled to clean up and Tony was lulling Peter to sleep that the scientist spit out, “What if we had another one?”
Now, Tony was sitting in bed, nearing the end of his dreadful decision, and wishing he could have a drink right about now. Actually, the harder part of all of this might not have actually been dysphoria. Maybe, he was just so grumpy that he had to quit drinking …
Their relationship grew as they did with awkward kisses, hand holding, and even the occasional movie date where Bucky would yawn and stretch his arm over his best friend. It escalated further when the Barnes’ family was able to afford a car that Bucky learned to drive in a matter of weeks. This opened an entire world up for the two young men.
“Functioning labels are bull, let me tell you, and I’m really passionate about this, ‘cause it’s all about how well you fool people without autism into believing you don’t have it and what you can contribute to them or if you’re rich. Rich people, back in the day, didn’t get called ‘autistic’ ‘cause that was a poor person’s ‘disease’,” The disdain was clear in his voice.
Steve had presumed if they agreed to have kids, they would simply adopt, and when finding out Tony never bothered getting his uterus removed since he was so content after his top surgery, he left it completely up to him if that was something he was comfortable with. Even when Tony begged for someone to have an opinion on the situation, no one would tell Tony what he should do. Not even Rhodey or Pepper would take a side on whether he should have kids at all, let alone if he should get pregnant.
Peter wasn’t as… cute… as he thought he was going to be, and it seemed as if all he knew how to do was cry and look for a tit to suck on. A feeling of regret swept him up, as if he never should have tried to start a family. What kind of parent didn’t want to hold their own child?
Finding out Steve was alive was enough to shake him from decades of brainwashing, and he thought they could make up for all of his time with Hydra, but it wasn’t “Bucky Barnes and Steve Rogers” any more.
Then came the barking of Steve’s service dog, Captain, and Bucky snapped to attention. He had learned of “post-traumatic stress disorder”, something many soldiers had. That’s where Captain came in, to soothe Steve, to alert if Steve was having an episode -- the Labrador had to be his second best friend.
