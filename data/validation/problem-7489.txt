Steve elbowed Tony in the ribs and the genius had to pretend that didn’t hurt at all.
After an ungodly amount of time spent working, Tony was greeted by a hand falling heavily on his shoulder that caused him to jump slightly, quickly turning to put a face to the hand. Steve. He should have known.
Steve grabbed Tony’s arm. “I’ll go. You…just get somewhere safe, Tony. We’ll handle the rest. You’re not—“
Steve rolled his eyes and helped Tony down from the table, laughing silently. “I know. And you, sir, do not eat enough.”
Steve tried to look at Tony without moving his head too much. Tony sighed loudly. “A rock band. I’ve been in a rock band for like a year.” The truth was out. Might as well go all the way with it.
Steve did. Happily.
Tony gave his garage a once over and a helpless look to Steve. “If I protest you’re going to find a way to convince me won’t you?”
Bruce was the first to speak, hand halfheartedly trying to cover up the large amount of formulas and tech design that had ended up all over the table, some of it in what Tony only realized halfway through was permanent marker. “Hey, Steve”, Bruce said. “Something up?”
The younger man smiled and pulled down a pair of sunglasses that Steve could almost swear materialized from nowhere. “Come on, Steve. Viva la fresh air. Did I use that right?” He took another long drag of his coffee. “Not that it matters, the sentiment is what counts.”
“Well how else am I supposed to take all of this?”
Tony placed a hand on the center of his chest. “Aww, honey, how sweet of you.”
“I see you’ve come prepared then.”
Thor just nodded, pointing at the t-shirt he was wearing. “I hear it has become customary for us to provide as much aid as possible post-battle. I agree with the sentiment although I do not much care for this garment. It is far too tight and I feel almost naked without my cape.”
Steve shook his head. “Nonsense. I’d never be able to afford it.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “And everyone thought I was going to be the one who was a bad influence on you. Don’t make bets with them.”
The picture itself was of Tony adding a final touch to that adjustment he’d made on Steve’s suit awhile ago. He had no idea he’d been smiling so much, but he often found himself smiling just thinking about Steve so he did not need to question if that had been added in or not.
Steve looked down at himself.
“Do you think I’m going to fuck this up?”
He pulled away from the kiss eventually and rested his forehead against Steve’s. “What have you been up to today?”
“No. You wouldn’t. You and Tony are both too stupid to figure it out.”
“That’s why you love me the most, Steve.”
Pepper and Rhodey both grinned, relief almost palpable in the air. Pepper whacked Tony on the shoulder. “You’re alive and you haven’t called. We’ve been worried sick and Obadiah’s been sending out search teams to try and find you and you’ve been alive this whole time, Tony! Why didn’t you come home?”
“No.”
Steve was giving Tony a perplexed look. "What's Vegas?"
“In all seriousness, you ever notice how dark and drab it is in here sometimes? You guys need to lighten up and who better to help than an adorable robot who has an even more adorable creator? It’s really a win all around if you ask me.”
And now things were just weird. After a few minutes of awkward silence, both of them just picking at their food, Steve stood up. “I have to finish my art project. See you later.” He was out the door before Tony could say anything.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Or anything. Game nights. Movie nights. Post battle clean-ups.”
“What?”
“It’s your call,
Steve smiled. “Good. One day you’ll realize how much you underestimate yourself too. Like I said, I’m stubborn and I won’t back down.” He kissed Tony’s forehead, his nose, his lips.
Steve paused outside the door. “Is there anyone else in the room or lurking about that I should worry about?”
The genius puffed up a bit, gathering any bravado he had left when he stared right back at Steve. “
Finally someone interrupted. “Oh my god. Get a room already.”
Bucky moved on to each finger, one at a time the way Tony instructed.
“It’s because I’m irresistable right?”
Tony felt his heart hammering in his chest and his mouth was suddenly very dry but he nodded.
The soldier took a seat next to the genius and everyone grew silent. It took the both of them to notice it but when they did they were greeted with snickers.
The sound of relative silence was almost too much when he’d become accustomed to the sounds of footsteps patrolling, a random scream here and there, and the drip drip drip of the leak in his ceiling. That drip had driven him crazy at the time but now he sort of missed it in what was definitely some twisted version of Stockholm syndrome.
Tony smirked. “Leave this to the professionals, Cap.” His faceplate shut and he aimed a repulsor beam at the point where both pieces met and cut them in half.
“Lead the way, Steve. This is your outing.”
What felt like only moments had turned out to be an hour because people were standing up and applauding before he knew it. Tony was bowing for the crowd and they were eating it up. Tony was turning to walk off stage and…
“Great. Be here at seven in the morning on Christmas Day. I’m sure Peter will wake me up at five. I won’t tell him you’re coming. It can be a surprise.”
Steve hummed indifferently, still focusing intently on his hair.
“Nice try, boss, but I’m not sure anyone else could be your bodyguard.”
He eventually pulled away from Tony’s neck and gently pushed him back down onto the bed. Tony looked up at Steve and felt his mouth go dry when Steve fell to his knees, his hands caressing Tony’s thighs, fingers trailing teasingly over his balls, his hard cock and then back to his thighs. When he replaced his hands with his mouth, Tony’s head fell back and he whimpered, arching his back slightly as he waited for Steve to stop messing around.
Tony took a steadying breath. “You had my parents killed--- my father. Did he know?”
Tony lunged for Steve’s mouth, kissing him hungrily as Steve blindly made his way toward the bedroom, his hands holding on firmly to Tony’s ass. Tony took that opportunity to grind into Steve while the taller man struggled to make it to the bed. He gently broke the kiss and deposited Tony onto the bed as he removed his own shirt. Tony was immediately back up, his hands tugging down Steve’s pants, shoving them to the ground while he latched on to one of Steve’s nipples, his tongue sliding over the bud before he gently nipped and sucked. Tongue laving over it again to soothe and pain.
“There’s more of them coming, Steve!” Bucky shouted, his own gun firing off from behind a pillar, the metal plates of his arm shifting and glinting in the dull lighting that the warehouse provided.
Steve shot him between the eyes, breath heaving as his heart roared away in his chest.
Natasha and Clint were sifting through areas of metal and wood again. Both of them were exhausted and the redhead had dislocated a shoulder that medical had set back into place almost immediately. She was only helping at her own insistence because the moment Steve tried to suggest she take it easy for the rest of the day is when she implied the threat of bodily harm for even thinking such a thing. At least she did agree to work on an area that would involve less use of her shoulder.
Steve smiled. He knew he wouldn’t use it. He always maintained radio silence on missions like these, and it had been months since the last sighting. Enough time for him to slowly ease back into a life he was becoming comfortable with. He couldn’t though. Bucky was out there and Steve needed to see him. He needed to talk to him, to get him to remember. He wanted his best friend back and he vowed to go through hell or high water to bring him back one day.
When Steve popped up at his side he jumped and dropped the soldering iron in his hand, burning it in the process. He cursed angrily and glared at Steve.
That definitely got Tony’s attention. “Lead the way then, oh darling husband of mine.”
He studied the flyer. “It starts in half an hour.”
“You eat a lot, Steve.”
Tony let out a breath. At least he wasn’t having to pretend anymore. “Well you were trying to have me killed. I think that’s my business. Wouldn’t you agree?”
The brunet just looked at Steve for a solid three seconds before brushing past him and walking away. Okay? He wasn’t sure what he was supposed to do now. Tony turned to look at him and jerked his head in the direction he was heading so Steve followed him. Neither of them said one word the entire way and he was surprised to be walking into a small practice room.
His ears were burning and he felt his face flush. “That’s---.”
Luckily Tony didn’t say anything. He waited for Steve to continue.
Clint nodded his head. “We appreciate that you put this meal in front of us. You didn’t have to. You don’t have to do a lot of things, but you do them anyway because it matters to you.”
Steve rolled his eyes and poked Tony with his elbow again, this time much lighter than the previous tap. Maybe he had recognized his own strength.
She smiled and rubbed her hand over his forearm. “I’ll let you make it up to me later.”
He waited quietly until the knock came again, this time a little more rapidly.
Tony gave him an innocent look. “What? I guess that leaves me with one wish yeah?”
Steve was drawn back to the present, fists still pummeling the punching bag in front of him, when he heard a throat clear. He was breathing deeply and looked down at his hands. He hadn’t even bothered to tape them up and now they were torn and bleeding.
“Thanks,” Tony responded softly causing Steve to look back up at him. “I wasn’t sure how this would go, but I thought I’d take my chances.” He breathed a sigh of relief. “So I’m glad. That you liked it.”
“That’s because you’re not looking closely enough, brother Steve. I can assure you that Tony Stark is just as taken with you as you are with him.”
“I’m fine. You’re not. It’s understandable. It’d be a tragedy to lose something this good.”
After opening to the first page, Mister Steve dramatically cleared his throat and began.
Bucky was officially the love of his life.
Peter’s hand shot up quickly and Mister Steve called on him.
Tony held out an arm. “Steve, this is also Pepper Potts, my uh...well she is the person who micromanages my life and she’s a miracle worker and next to her is Happy. He’s my bodyguard slash driver. Everyone, this is Steve.”
“I think Tony has enough on his plate already,” Natasha commented as she shoved a wheelbarrow full of twisted metal toward a dumpster.
“You’re fired.”
Steve grinned at Dum Dum and gulped down as much beer as he possibly could as quick as he could. When he was finished he followed after the rest of the group, excited for his own reasons that none of them really knew anything about.
When Tony opened his eyes, his brain took several moments to comprehend where he was. He tried to move just a little and groaned because everything hurt. Ah yes. Hospital. Just his luck.
“Steve! Steve, I built you something!”
“You’re welcome, kiddo,” Tony said.
Steve and Tony had taken a couple of breaks to eat some more crackers and refill on their water supply. Thank the stars there was at least enough snow for them to melt. Tony wasn’t particularly excited to be drinking it, but it was better than becoming dehydrated. After they were finished though, they crawled back under their blankets and came together one more time. Steve held onto Tony as if he was the most precious thing in his world.
Steve was cut off by a frantic voice. “Tony? Tony, are you there?”
“Uh, no. I’m a sure thing. I have been from the beginning.”
Steve laughed and kissed Tony once more. “My pleasure.”
"Why would you? We can't seem to get rid of the previous hack. This is about you and Rogers."
Steve blushed a little. “Thanks, Tony. You didn’t have to.”
“Who?”
*****
“I’ll keep that in mind.”
“...YES!”
Steve smiled and watched as they both left the room, the bots high voice floating back with. “I loveeee the Cap-TAIN!”
Steve found himself frowning at that. “Tony’s not that bad, Clint.”
Tony huffed. “I don’t have to do anything. This is a stupid Christmas tradition and I don’t like it when a piece of foliage dictates whether or not I should kiss someone.”
Steve spoke before Tony could respond. “So, you want us to help you…how exactly? It seems like you know what you need to do.”
“Look here, Sassmaster Genie.” He pointed at Steve. “While you have a very good point, I am going to risk it.”
It wasn’t until Steve cornered him in the lab one day to ask him if he was still even interested in him anymore. He’d looked so uncertain and insecure and Tony didn’t know what to do with that. He hadn’t seen that look on Steve’s face before and he didn’t want to see it again. So he answered by throwing himself against Steve and kissing him as if his life depended on it.
He patted Steve on the shoulder. “I gotta go. Talk to you later, Rogers.”
“What, dad?”
Bucky whispered, eyes where Natasha and Clint had disappeared. “We going to blow this place sky high this time?”
“I don’t plan on doing anything to hurt you.”
The brunet nodded and the others made their way into the limo so Tony could get a little privacy with Steve.
The redhead was now tuning in, now that Tony’s voice had taken on a different level of seriousness.
“I don’t know,” Tony admitted. “I’m still trying to work that out, but the point is that I’m the one who should get to decide what’s better for me…even if…even if I end up deciding that it’s better for me if we don’t kill Obie.”
“Don’t forget to come to bed, Tony!”
At least Steve still appreciated Tony’s bizarre sense of humor.
“Yeah? He apparently missed a board meeting last time.”
Obie laughed, gurgling on a buildup of spit and just a little bit of blood, “Congratulations, boy! Finally acting like a capable man. Tell me, what are you going to do next?”
Tony laughed delightedly and patted Rhodey’s back, pulling away about a foot. “Empty threats, pooh-bear. You were never very good at them.”
Steve whispered curses against Tony’s lips before throwing his head back. Tony smiled and lined his own cock up with Steve’s, a sensation that had the both of them shuddering. Tony grabbed one of Steve’s hands and had the soldier wrap it around both of their cocks, helping him by starting with small strokes. Steve finally got the rhythm and Tony pulled his hand away, moving his hips slowly while Steve jerked the both of them off, loving the way the blond moaned when their dicks slid back and forth against each other.
Another bullet. Another grunt. Tony tried to breathe. And then Obie was looming over Tony, crouching down next to him and sliding the barrel of the gun over Tony’s face. “You should work on breathing, Tony. This is going to get you killed before I get a chance to do it myself.”
“I am still working on decrypting their coding to get into their private files. I will alert you the moment I know something.”
Steve smiled softly as he held Tony’s injured hand in his, careful while he placed the ice pack on it. “Then I want to help you.”
“So I hear you need a little bit of help with all this clean-up. Where would you like me to start?”
The genius stopped mumbling but continued to pace, albeit a little slower. “I know that,’ he answered, just a smidge indignant.
“Yeah. I hear you there, Tony. Loud and clear. Just give me some time. I’ll be back and then we can talk more about...us. Yeah?”
Tony gave Steve a dark look. “I am helping. By staying out of the way.”
Bruce cleared his throat. “I am thankful for the chances we are given. I never thought I’d be capable of doing good things with the Other Guy, but I can change my outlook on life and I have you guys here with me. Not many people would be willing to take a risk with me.”
Steve shut Tony up with a kiss. A kiss that was naughty and rather promising of things to come. Unless Steve was a huge tease. God he really hoped not.
Steve frowned. “To an extent yes. He’s told me some. I tend to ignore the things he doesn’t tell me for himself.”
“Who said you have to go back to sleep for me to do that?”
Well this was not good. Steve frowned. “What makes you think he’d want to go with us?”
Wednesday had Tony stuck in meetings all day, and the team had to go out without Iron Man. The billionaire was not impressed and had tried to whine to Pepper that he really needed to leave, but she fixed him with a “so-help-me-god-you-better-stick-around-if-you-know-what’s-good-for-you” look so he might have cowed slightly with a loud sigh and a pout. This was not fair at all.
As far as first kisses go, it was a little more on the desperate side than the romantic side, but it was everything Steve wanted at that moment.
By the end, his mood had improved a great deal and he remembered why he dedicated so much time to what he did. Yeah he hated that he was 17 and lacked any sort of social life whatsoever, but he put his talents to good use and people loved him. When he made his way back into the wings, Pepper gave him a hug like she always did after another completed concerto. He had to go to his post-show mingling thing and talk to some higher ups because this was all part of getting from point A to point B in terms of deciding where he’d take his next performance and when. He was itching to get to his cell phone though and he could not manage to escape because everyone wanted to congratulate him on another spectacular composition. He’d started to give up hope when he finally spotted an opening and made a mad dash (as fast as one could escape without making it obvious he was, in fact, trying to escape) to get outside. He pulled his phone from his pocket.
Tony scoffed, his face contorting. “Now just one damn second, Steve! Where is this even coming from? Everyone should have been able to guess that this whole rock band thing was just a thing, a phase. I have no intention of actually sticking with it. I have to grow up at some point!”
“Someone’s here, dad!”
Steve looked at his best friend with a small amount of confusion and then over to Natasha who was seated next to Bucky on the couch, cuddled up to him.
Tony pushed his sunglasses to the top of his head and looked at his friend, putting on a smile. “Possibly right after graduation. It depends on whether or not I have anything going on.”
“Well yeah. I mean not him exactly. I tripped over his bottle and he ended up being inside of it.”
That didn’t seem to make Steve feel better. “But you weren’t alone. And you were out because I wanted you to stop your work and go.”
Tony glared. When did Steve become unflappable and immune to his flirting? Then he smiled.
Steve tilted his head. “I can’t really predict the future, Tony, but if we do end up in a relationship, I don’t have any plans of it ending anytime soon, if ever.”
“Could you really expect anything different from big bird?” Tony quipped.
Tony stood up with enough force to knock the chair backwards. His lips were pressed into a thin line. “And my mother, did she know too? How about Edwin Jarvis?”
“I’m okay with that,” Steve responded huskily.
Tony patted the robot dog but smiled. “I’m glad.”
The genius laughed, amusement etched on every plane of his face, before swooping down and grabbing the bot. Tony spoke to Nuts-N-Bolts as he exited the room. “That’s enough. We have to leave. I don’t want troll to be a part of your everyday vernacular and the Captain there is a bad influence already.”
Tony began laughing and Steve wanted to glare, but he couldn’t stop his shoulders shaking from laughter himself and tossed Tony’s clothes at him. He stood up to grab his suit and lightly smacked Tony upside the back of his head when he received a wolf whistle from the genius. Once the both of them were dressed, they worked together to drag Tony’s suit out into the snow and toward the quinjet.
“Steve, whatever it was they did to him is going to leave him broken until the day he dies. That’s nothing you can fix.”
Steve was silent for a long time, and when he did speak again it was quietly. “I thought I’d lost you, Tony. It was like losing everyone in my life all over again.”
“Then yes.”
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve said earnestly, flashing a smile that was just as earnest as his words.
Nuts-N-Bolts chirped and waggled his brow happily.
“Steve. Steve is the Captain, call him Cap.”  He waved his hand at Steve, gesturing him closer. “Take a seat, old timer. Don’t want you to hurt your back or anything.”
“Mister Stark is well while Miss Potts is making her way out of the building as we speak.”
“You need to keep your hands to yourself until we’ve at least eaten, Tony,” Steve chided.
“Does this cloud your otherwise normal judgment of him?”
“I expect you to join me, soldier.”
“For what?”
He tugged on his dad’s hand while Tony was in the middle of a discussion with Steve.
Natasha walked away without another word, leaving the two of them alone. Steve noted Tony fidgeting the longer Steve watched him in silence.
“But—“
Steve stepped out of the car and looked at Tony over the roof with a shit eating grin. “The best girl.”
Tony rolled his eyes playfully and made his way to the onstage piano just as he was being announced. People were clapping. He pasted the patented Stark Charm smile on his face before taking a bow with a flourish and sitting on the bench. He started with his opener and knew right away it would be yet another successful performance.
Steve moved to give the three space, rooting himself by the window, close enough to hear but not to intrude upon their moment.
“Ow.” He hoped this wasn’t becoming his word of the day. He shot his own glare at the genie. “Right. I’m hallucinating a bit too hard it seems.”
The driver grunted and pulled away from the curb. Steve had his hands on his knees, one leg bouncing nervously. The cabbie might have been cranky, but he definitely took Steve’s “as fast as you can” to heart because he was pushing his way in and out of traffic and his hand was practically glued to the horn. If Steve were to tell someone he wasn’t scared he’d be lying. This guy was intense. On the plus side, he did make it to the performance hall with five minutes to spare before the show even started.
He side-eyed Clint. “Sorry. A little preoccupied with…” he gestured the papers in front of him. “Homework.”
Steve frowned. “I don’t--I mean why would he think that?”
Steve’s ears turned red immediately. Tony had a moment of silent victory. He still had it.
Tony was making his way toward the elevator once more and Steve followed.
“Master Tony, Mister Steve Rogers is here to see you.”
Tony smirked. "Oh yes. You can see that I'm already troubled by your idle threats. Your parents will be more than thrilled when my dad's lawyers come knocking on your door."
It occurred to Tony that Steve didn’t know anything about him other than the fact that he loves to perform. And he didn’t even realize Tony was…
They eventually became distracted with food and Clint’s stories about joining the circus. They were 87% sure he was lying about going off to do that after graduation, but it was hard to tell with him. He had also tried to convince everyone earlier in the year that he was an assassin with a secret government agency and that his weapon of choice was a bow and arrow. He was most likely going to end up in a Hollywood movie with the way he managed to make up such entertaining stories. Well an 87% chance they were made up.
“No problem.” He started putting his tools away and ran his good hand through his hair, which is when Steve noticed Tony had done all that with one hand, the other still held in a sling against his chest. Steve was just that much more impressed.
“This is the hottest thing ever, Steve,” Tony said loud enough for only the soldier to hear. “All I can think about right now is how badly I want to swallow your dick and choke on it. Do you think you’d be able to be still and keep quiet if I were to do that?”
“What did you tell them?”
Fake. Everything Obie was was fake, no matter how well he played his role.
Tony winced, eyes filling with tears he refused to shed. He focused his eyes on the wall across from him. “And I wasn’t?”
Steve tossed a balled up paper towel at Clint’s head before turning his attention back to Tony with a smile, leaning forward in his chair. “So are you going to eat it?”
Tony needed something to do with his hands and began sliding them up and down Steve’s biceps. Steve took that as his cue and leaned into the genius, cupping his face with his hands, and pressed a kiss to his lips. The tension left both of them, their kiss started to heat up.
Tony shrugged a little, smiling. “I know right?”
The genius took a deep breath only to realize even his thoughts were taking him to a place that induced panic, and all while he was kissing Steve Rogers. He opted to nod instead and buried his face in Steve’s neck while he collected himself.
Tony searched the entire island. He found palm fronds. He found a hammock. He found coconuts. He found...nothing useful.
“Go away, hallucigenie. I have work to do.”
“You’re five. You’re a kid, squirt.” He ruffled his son’s hair and chuckled when Peter gave an exasperated sigh like the one he often heard from Tony when talking to someone especially stupid and ran his hand through his hair to fix it.
As slowly as he could he pushed himself into a sitting position, pulling his legs up just enough to allow him to bury his head between his knees and allowing his eyes to gradually adjust to the brightness. When he was finally able to clear his vision he looked up, squinting heavily, taking in his surroundings. He only hoped that what he was looking at was a beach and not a mirage of one. If he was hallucinating it was one hell of a hallucination. The slight breeze he was finally feeling from the sea, the sounds of birds, the sight of pieces of a plane that crashed into the water. Yep. This had to be real. He was definitely having memories of something going wrong during his flight and realizing they were quickly going down. He frowned as he realized what that meant, but he was mostly curious about how he ended up on this island and what the fate of the rest the crew had been. When he had his bearings a little better, he stood with the intention of walking towards the beach to get a closer look at anything possibly salvageable, maybe a radio and some food.
“Who ya texting there, Steve?”
“Is it? You never say anything like that to Clint. Or Thor. Or even Bruce and you say some pretty awkward things to him.”
“When were you going to mention that?”
Tony looked tired. And a little lost on top of everything else and it broke Steve’s heart.
“So will you eventually drop out of The Avengers because of it?”
Tony never once showed up to help with the clean-up.
“I…” he swallowed and looked down. “I sort of thought you were going to hate me and not forgive me and did I mention hate me but then I realized that I wasn’t being fair to you because wow this happened to you and I’m not being a real adult about this and stop me now and say something.”
“Thirded—is that a word? Stark owes us big once we rescue that idiot. More arrows, better arrows.”
“Don’t call me that,” Tony said with slight distaste. It felt wrong.
The drummer shook her head. “Pizza and a movie like always?”
Tony grabbed the box of tissues from the nightstand to wipe up his mess as Steve removed his condom and tied it before throwing it into the waste basket. Once finished he pulled Tony against him and wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist.
Tony shrugged. “You’re prettier than the rest of them.”
Tony balled his hands into fists at his sides, eyes coming up only to narrow at Steve. “Because I asked you to! Because I paid you to.”
Then he found himself being cornered by Natasha.
Tony gaped. “You knew about that?”
Steve hummed softly. “Are we now?”
Tony jerked a little, as if stung. “Of course I—look. I knew what I was doing, I had safety precautions in place I just didn’t expect—Nuts-N-Bolts told you where I was! Everyone—everything is fine.
They were playing Mario Kart and Tony was winning.
Pepper, on the other hand, told Tony he was under no circumstances allowed to leave until he made a point to talk to Steve. Tony whined, but only a little, and Pepper lightly patted the side of his face. “Be nice. You don’t want to lose any of your friends before college.” She tilted her head slightly to indicate Steve when she said “any of your friends.”
He hauled Tony over to the couch in his workshop and propped him up, turning his head so the genius could see Steve on the floor, struggling and bleeding, trying to move. This had turned into a nightmare. Obadiah smirked at his handiwork on Steve before turning his attention back to Tony. “What a sight. It’s tearing you up isn’t it? You can’t do anything other than watch this.”
Steve just blinked. “Right. That’s Natasha’s area. We should probably all sit down and go over everything sometime soon.”
“I’m positive. I think one of the guitars can switch to bass for one night. You have a serious life matter to take care of. Call me later. Well maybe not later. Hopefully you’ll be busy making up in ways I won’t want to hear about.”
“I’m fine, Barton,” Natasha bit out. “Nothing to get weepy over.”
Steve let his eyes trail to the servers, still working, still infected. He raised his gun at Schmidt, just as the other man came charging at him, gun thrown aside and a hand around Steve’s throat before he could pull the trigger. Schmidt growled in his face. “I will savor this moment.”
Tony glared at Steve. “Not my fault? You can’t tell me that you’re not pissed about that, Cap!”
“Is my dad right?”
“You’re dating Tony.”
Steve found Tony working in the car garage covered in grease and dirt.
*****
More importantly, they really seemed to click. All three of them.
“A friend or an ‘I want more than just your friendship’ friend?”
Steve groaned and let his head hit the table. “No. The last time I went to a movie with the two of you I had to act like I didn’t know you at all. Or do you not remember how loudly you guys were making out?”
“Bucky, that’s not--”
“So what do you need? I’ll do anything you ask.”
When he was yanked into a hard kiss, Tony decided he would definitely be telling Steve just how much he loved him more often from now on.
Nuts-N-Bolts merely chirped, and began fussing at Steve’s shoelaces. Steve got more comfortable on the floor, Nuts-N-Bolts as his entertainment until Tony finally reappeared.
“Well yeah. It’s one of the most famous cities in the world. Everyone knows it.”
Tony just shot Steve a rather unimpressed look but he was actually pretty hungry so he vowed to make an attempt. Steve had kicked Bucky and Natasha out of the apartment for the night so he and Tony could have it to themselves. Tony was turning 18 and Steve wanted to make sure he gave Tony a memorable birthday. Bucky had told Steve that he better be screwing Tony into the mattress if he was going to have to leave the fortress for the night. Steve declined to comment on that.
“Till the end of the line, Stevie. Like hell I’m hiding away with these sonuvabitches shooting at your back. I’ll get up high and take ‘em out from there.”
“‘m never drinking again,” he slurred to no one. The truth was, he didn’t drink often at all. A man his size should be able to hold his liquor, but such was not the case. His friends had told him that as a man who was born on the 4th of July, it was his patriotic duty to drink twice as much for twice the celebration. Steve did love patriotic duty. He didn’t love the hangover he knew he was going to wake up with in the morning.
Tony laughed. “You and everyone else, buddy. I’m not really in the business of making them anymore though, remember?”
Steve nodded sharply and turned to head out. “Make sure you have your coms ready and you’re suited up properly. We leave now.”
Steve would have to pay them a visit pretty soon, a fact that he jotted down into his agenda, all thoughts of Tony pushed to the back of his head as he focused instead on whether or not he’d given his man Lorenzo one too many chances to prove himself working down on the docks. Either way it went, after Steve’s visit, Lorenzo wouldn’t be making anymore mistakes in the future, that was for sure.
“Next time, I’m taking pictures,” he says gruffly, his own mind in a haze of desire and arousal.
Tony just sighed. This was getting tiring. “Yup.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I told you it was something stupid. We both overreacted to something, said things we shouldn’t have said. I fucked it up even worse by accidentally telling his father about him being in a band in the first place.”
Tony slumped down further and mumbled to himself. “Geez, I leave behind one interrogation for another.” Then louder, “It was a small energy blaster. Don’t worry about the specifics, they require far too much technological jargon for either of you to possibly understand fully.” Tony rubbed at his temple, pulling it away only to scowl at the blood coating his fingers, blood he promptly wiped onto his makeshift sling. “Would it be at all possible to get a Tylenol, or a glass of Scotch, preferably both? I’m pretty sure my arm is broken and I maybe might have or had a concussion at some point. Either way, my head is pounding.”
“Steve, Bucky is looking for you. Tony, we’re heading out and Happy is waiting outside in the car.”
Fury looked over at Steve and then the rest of the team.
“Jesus, Steve. You look like something the cat dragged in.”
“Steve, if we’re going to think about pursuing a relationship, I need to know if you’re in it for the long haul. Peter loves you and I don’t know if I can watch you walk away and break his heart.”
“JARVIS, what just happened?”
Steve and Tony eyed each other, both unwilling to back down, until a throat cleared, breaking them from whatever that little display had been.
"So did you hear about Rogers?"
Pepper’s breathing was controlled but heavy as she hugged Tony, her eyes puffy and cheeks splotchy with color. She pushed him back after a few moments; her hands on Tony’s shoulders as she took in his face in silence before nodding and smiling, satisfied with what she saw.
Steve resisted the urge to let his head fall heavily into his hands and instead settled on rolling his eyes, sure that he’d never met another human being that left him feeling exasperated more often than not. “Some other time, Stark,” he said shortly, shifting in his seat for the fifth time in under a minute.
Steve was, for better use of words, tired. His diligence, making sure everyone in his family was taken care of, left him wanting. For what, he wasn’t sure, but he couldn’t trust anyone else enough to do his job, not like Erskine had trusted Steve. No, this was Steve’s burden to carry now and he always had been known for being set in his ways, too stubborn to change tracks when the way he did things had always turned out favorable results.
Howard never wanted me because I was who I am, and you were disappointed to meet a man who seemingly brought shame to the Stark name. I wasn’t perfect enough and I was too abrasive on the other end.
He felt his shoulders slump and looked down at his hands. “I’m fine.”
Steve lifted the sweater and watched it unfold, showing off the face of Iron Man with a reindeer nose and antlers and Tony wasn’t sure if laughter was an appropriate response but he took a chance and went with it.
The rest of the team came running at an almost alarming speed at the noise, and Steve watched as the bots screen turned from the pleasant green it always had been to an angry shade of red that blinked in and out.
He ended up purchasing hot dogs from a vendor for himself and Steve and they went to a spot not so far from the pond, taking a seat in the grass. Tony almost collapsed on the ground he was so tired but Steve didn’t even seem winded. What an asshole.
Steve sat back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. Clint snorted.
“I’d make sure they had the security they need and offer them a different place in the company. Or help them find work somewhere else. I don’t know. I wouldn’t leave them stranded like that.”
Steve rubbed a finger over his eye. “Look, you know that we think you’re just as important to the team as the rest of us right?”
“I don’t want to lose you.” Tony sounded small, scared. He looked as miserable as Steve felt.
Bruce began scribbling furiously at the pages. “What about here?” He gestured at another stack of papers. “If I change that then it would alter—“
Tony gave Steve a small grin. “Yeah. Same here.” He looked away and noticed everyone’s expectant gazes on his again. Was he really going to have to do this?
Tony blinked at his son a few times, mouth opening and then closing as if he was about to say something but stopped himself and then cleared his throat. “Uh…”
“Security breach,” Tony quipped, “How’d you get in here?”
Tony cleared his throat. “You said you were confused by me. That I was giving you mixed signals and you had no idea what to do with it. You also said that you’d like to see me more. I showed up because you wanted me to, Steve. Not out of guilt. I thought maybe if I showed up and helped that you’d get the message.”
There it was. Tony deflated.
“Show off,” Steve muttered despite the smile never leaving his face.
“Now your wrist.”
Tony grinned, pulling his sunglasses down slightly to peer at his friend. “You know me. I like to make an entrance, Rhodey.” He plopped down in the small space that was left next to Steve, making himself comfortable. “Besides, I had a thing and was on the phone with some ingrate who shouldn’t even be working for MIT.”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., take us up.”
Finally he pulled away he kissed Tony’s forehead. “You’re the one who was injured and yet you’re the one doing the comforting.”
Clint’s eyes widened rather comically. “Please don’t tell me that’s Tony. Holy shit.”
Steve stood up, looked at Bruce. “Get him cleaned up,” and then he looked back at Tony. “You’re negotiating with killers, Tony. We like to keep our business efficient, and that includes popping a guy who will become trouble in the future. You need to figure out what your hang up is here and how far you’re willing to go to get what you want.” Steve turned then and walked away, stopping just at the threshold of the entranceway to the hall, turning his head until his eyes locked with Tony’s. “Some of us have no choice but to get our hands dirty. You’ll do well to remember that if we’re going to work together, Stark.”
Smooth, Rogers. Real smooth.
Steve grinned. “I’m counting on it, Stark.”
Natasha smiled evenly, stepping closer to the boy. "I think you might want to watch what you say. He might not be the runt you bullied just two years ago, but that doesn't mean I'm going to let you think it's okay to talk bad about him."
“This is Obie?”
Tony sighed and cringed. “Did you not hear the part where I said I have a crush on you? That changes everything.”
Steve scowled. “You’re definitely not welcome.”
“Rhodey is here, wants to help.” Clint’s voice came through a bit tinier as he spoke to Rhodey. “How did you find me anyway?”
“Not too long ago.” He looked at Bucky. “You think he’ll survive?”
“Weapons.”
“So that’s a yes? I can’t tell.”
The first place Tony found himself when he ventured outside his room was an admittedly dark and creepy hallway that did not at all remind him of the time he stayed up for 36 hours straight after watching 'The Grudge' and then getting locked outside of his dorm room that suddenly seemed 20 degrees colder and darker. Not at all.
Steve shrugged and rolled his eyes once more while he waited. Fifteen minutes later though, Tony returned, and he looked ridiculous. He struck a pose and pivoted around on a foot. “How do I look?”
After several moments of them just holding on to each other, Steve pulled his head back and lifted Tony’s chin, pressing a kiss to the genius’ lips.
This time Steve joined Natasha in looking amused as they both shared a brief look. “Is that so? Care to tell me how you’re blaming me for whatever trouble it is that you seem to have found yourself in?”
Steve nudged Tony with his shoulder, a smile on his face. Tony grinned back, open and wide and sort of beautiful. Steve rolled his eyes toward the sky, how had this become his life.
Steve leaned his forehead down against Tony’s. “I don’t think you’re inept. I think you are brave and reckless and a genius who just so happens to also be an idiot. You’re one of mine, Tony. Of course I have to worry, of course you doing something as stupid as coming out here while still injured is something I’m going to have a problem with. I want to keep you safe. I have to.”
Steve could only spare a confused look before he answered to the call of another worker. He felt ridiculous being the only heavy-lifting Avenger there. They’d get the work finished even faster if Thor or Hulk or Tony...okay well Tony. If Tony showed up. Ever. And this was volunteer work. Steve understood that, but Tony’s suit caused nearly as much damage as the Hulk did and it irked the soldier that Tony didn’t seem to care about the clean-up at all.
“I mean uh--,” he was floundering and blushing heavily.
“Yeah.” He let out a breath. “Yeah. I just…” He took a seat on the bed and then patted the spot next to him hoping Steve would sit as well. He did.
“I have to tell you something. It’s important.”
Tony glanced around realizing that Steve was talking rather loudly at this point and that lots of people were looking. “Right. Clench up, Cap.”
“It’s a reminder. When I was born I had a heart defect. One that required major surgery. It kept me stuck in the house a lot, and that’s when I started playing the piano.” He rest his hand over Steve’s and pressed it closer to his heart. “I could have died. I should have died. I didn’t though and that grounded me at a much younger age than it probably should have.”
“You’re so tight, Tony. Is this okay?”
“Wait, you’re only seventeen aren’t you?”
“Tony, do you want to help me put on the lights?”
“So then you’re cool with me stealing your thunder for just awhile?”
When it was time for them to make their way to the stage, Steve looked over at his best friend and gave him a smile along with a salute which Bucky returned. At some point in their lives this had become their method for letting the other know he had his back. Bucky seemed to calm down visibly and smiled. Steve trusted Bucky more than anyone else and he knew Bucky felt the same way. So when it was time for them to walk onstage, Steve gave Bucky a pat on the back as he walked by to pick up his bass guitar. The lights came up, people were screaming and Dum Dum started them off. Steve spotted Natasha not too far from the stage so he spared Bucky a quick glance to see if he’d noticed. He had. He winked at her before he started singing which earned him an eyeroll and the tiniest of smiles. Steve was happy for his friend and happy that Bucky might possibly stop dragging him along on horrendous double dates if their relationship became serious.
“Uh, no. It’s time for you to help me”.
Another awkward silence.
“So uh…” Tony started.
“Are you sure?”
Steve chuckled. “That won’t be a problem.”
“Liar.”
Steve furrowed his brows. “And what makes you so sure about all of this?”
He definitely didn’t recognize the number these messages were coming from.
Tony picked up a handful of tinsel and tossed it at Steve’s face in retaliation. He wasn’t angry or even that embarrassed, and maybe part of it had to do with the fact that he was getting that smile from Steve. Maybe next time he’d wear his suit for a moment like that, just in case.
“You should get some rest, Tony. We can’t have you falling asleep during dinner tomorrow.” Bruce leveled Tony with a look that clearly said the genius would not be getting out of attending the meal by any means.
Steve shot up in his seat, wide awake, with wide eyes. The bed was empty. Steve stood up and started frantically looking around the room, in the bathroom, in the closet, with no luck and a sense of rising panic that got caught in his throat until every breath he took seemed to be too much and too fast.
Natasha and Clint made their way silently into the shadows, leaving the others to wait for the all clear.
Steve laughed at that. He had no other reaction. He was relieved because the guy whose name he still had yet to learn wasn’t angry with him. “I’m really sorry though. I hate it when people watch me without me knowing it. You play really well though. That was uh...amazing.”
Tony smiled and took the drink.
“They’re not very good. Not yet. My dad said they’ll be good one of these days if I keep trying, but what if they’re not?”
Steve stood, leaving behind the metal debris for a moment, wiping his hands on his pants. “That’d be great. Yeah. I’ve been trying to pry them apart. Apparently it won’t even give in to my super soldier strength.”
“Because you have a stronger stomach than I do?”
The elevator began its descent. “So, uh, who’s talking to me?”
“Stark,” Steve said, voice softer than intended.
“Well at least I’ll know my plan has worked.”
Steve just shook his head and looked away, chuckling. “No. There’s nothing you’re missing at all.”
“But you look good enough to eat.”
Steve grinned, his lips millimeters from Tony’s. “Shut up, Stark,” he all but whispered before taking control of the situation. Tony was a bit surprised when he felt Steve’s hand move so quickly he didn’t even register that Steve had popped the button on his pants before his hands were wrapped around his cock.
“I bet he’s still alive.”
Steve shook his head in disbelief as the bot ran into the leg of the table, paused, and then zoomed around the room and in between Steve’s legs making a long drawn out ‘weeeeeeeeeeee’ as it went.
“But we managed to survive without too many complaints on the big day.”
“So how bad is it?”
And I will never abandon you.
Steve woke up slowly, blinking the sleepy from his eyes to find Tony already awake and staring at him. He smiled. “It’s still creepy when you do that.”
“That’s a long time to be having sex. Which, by the way, is how I intend to spend the rest of this weekend.”
“I’m doomed,” Tony stated dramatically. “Why did I agree to this?”
“Yeah. Yeah, I’ll,” he scratched his head. “I’ll need to figure out how to.”
Because you went to art school was Tony’s first thought. “Some of us are just born with innate abilities to be really awesome.”
Steve gave him a smirk. “I know where to look for the right people.”
It was almost time for the Howling Commandos to go out onstage and perform again. Instead of mentally preparing himself for the roaring crowd he was lost in his own head. He wanted more than anything to fix whatever had happened, but he was honestly scared. This was new to Steve. He was certain he’d been 100% straight before he met Tony, but being with Tony for even the short of amount of time they had been together had felt so natural he wasn’t sure he could really match that again.
“Are you still working on that drawing?”
“Tony. There’s a lot of information here. I’m not sure how bad things are, but Obie is involved in something big.”
“Would you please sit down already, Stark?”
He felt so much guilt over all of this that he didn’t even think he deserved to try and offer up any sort of explanation to Steve. He didn’t even know what he’d try to say to him.
“You’re a wreck,” Tony mutters against Steve’s lips. “You’re doing so good though. I bet you’re ready to come, aren’t you?”
“Tony…” Steve said calmly.
“I know.” He turned Steve so he could see just the edge of the dancing crowd and pressed up against him from behind. “Look at them, Steve,” Tony started, turning the vibe back onto its lowest setting. “All those warm bodies, sliding against each other.” His hand cupped Steve’s ass, palm pressing against the base of the vibrating plug while his other hand wrapped around Steve’s waist before landing on his crotch.
Tony’s eyes swiveled up to stare at Steve, brows furrowed. “It’s not…” he sighed, stood up and folded his arms across his chest. “Thank you.”
Both bots lowered their claws and made a sad, pathetic sound. Steve just blinked for a moment and then slowly approached them.
He had some papers drawn up by his lawyers and eventually became the sole parent to Peter, having his mother waive all rights to her child since she stated she didn’t want him to begin with. It puzzled Tony how she could even feel that way but he wanted to avoid complications and potentially emotionally scarring his child in the future. He had doubted himself as a parent initially because he didn’t want to turn into his father, but he’d managed to prove he was amazing at taking care of Peter. Not once in the five years since he had Peter did his birth mother even try to contact them.
“Let me see it, Stark!”
“I’m Steve. Tony gave me this address?”
“We come bearing news,” Clint said cheerily, walking in the door behind a less enthused Natasha. Steve watched as Nat tossed her fake Stark Industries badge on the table and folded herself down into a chair quietly. Clint followed her example and took a seat next to her. “A lot of it’s not good,” he added. “Well, none of it is, but there is quite a bit.”
When Steve turned to give his friend a disapproving look, Bucky was already gone, making a beeline for that red headed drummer. He checked the time on his cell phone, knowing he had to get an early start on his day tomorrow if he ever planned to finish his final art project for the semester. With a sigh, because he knew it would take some convincing to get his friend out of there, he slowly approached and placed a hand on his shoulder.
"How many cowardly bullies does it take to beat up some kid less than half their size? I have to tell you, the color yellow really does suit you well. Now why don't you run off and go do manly things that involve ass grabbing and vicious chest bumps?"
“I’ve never thought of myself as smarter than you. I don’t think I’ve met anyone quite like you, Steve Rogers.”
Tony was out of breath. “This is my company. My employees. You weren’t going to sideline me.”
“Hey, Tony?”
Tony jogged to the bathroom, determined to get in and out in a hurry. He hated to think Steve might up and disappear on him even though Steve was bound to him because of that whole master clause. He asked JARVIS to set the shower temperature for him while he removed his clothing.
“What Nat said. You guys are great. I’m also thankful for all this free food.”
Steve nodded. “Don’t laugh. Steve is a respectable name.”
She pulled the door open.
“You can’t do it, can you, Tony.” Obie breathed out, a pained wince finally marring his creased face. “You can’t pull the trigger.” He tsked, “Howard always said you were soft, my boy. Carried your heart on your sleeve for the whole world to see.”
The genius did not look overly thrilled. “Are we actually having a party or are you just trying to punish us for the way that last battle went?”
“I’m not seein’ a problem here. I like you too,” he admitted.
As the team (minus Tony naturally) sat down for their debriefing at S.H.I.E.L.D. after another surprise visit from Loki, Steve eyed Fury as the director paced back and forth before deciding to address the team. If anyone else thought this behavior was strange, no one said anything.
That was when the doctor walked in. “Ah, look who’s awake. How are we feeling?”
“Collateral damage. Accidents happen and sometimes they just so happen to take out everyone in a certain radius. Maria and Edwin were---disposable.”
Tony lifted his eyebrows with a sly grin on his face. “Wow me then.”
“All right, sassy genie. Don’t get your genie thong in a bunch.”
Tony laughed quietly and pressed his lips together, smiling. “Steve the genie?”
Yours,
Tony smiled, pulling away from Steve so he could pull Peter into his lap. “Yeah. I think so, kid.”
Steve opened his mouth to argue, before shutting it with a snap. Anything he said on the contrary would sound empty when the only reason they were helping Tony was because of what he promised them he could create. Steve felt guilt eating away at him but couldn’t afford to lose focus because of it. This was a job and Tony was the best one to help them get it done.
The blond didn’t question it, just took the seat at Tony’s side, watched and waited. He noticed the slight shake to Tony’s hand as he reached for the first file folder. The brunet stared at the folder briefly as if willing it to disappear from his grasp or not be filled to the brim with answers to questions he’d probably agonized over these past weeks.
Clint mimicked zipping his lips but the smirk stayed. Unfortunately Bruce, Natasha and Thor looked like they were just as eager as Clint was.
Steve mumbled something.
Steve followed a happy Peter inside and sat down a bag of what appeared to be a lot of presents. He took a seat next to Tony on the couch.
And then the mystery keyboard player began to sing and Steve froze.
Steve groaned tiredly into his palm, only looking up once he heard a knocking at his still closed office door.
When I was growing up, my dad talked about you a lot. And I mean all the time. The stories were always “Captain America was a real hero, an amazing human being, one of the best people I’ll have ever have had the good fortune of knowing.” That’s a pretty big deal when you’re five and a half and want nothing more than to meet someone so larger than life.
Steve spoke from behind him, quiet but determined. “Tony, we need to go. The building…” and Tony hadn’t noticed before but the structure did seem to shaking just the slightest bit, smoke still visible out of the windows. The fire was moving down from the top floors.
Tony smiled, small but sincere. “Superheroes huh? As long as I get to be the one with all the cool armor--- and flying! Flying is a must…maybe rollerblades. An entire suit of battle ready armor ready to swoop in and save the day with science and technology that would make the smartest men to ever live cry tears of envy.”
Steve glared, already moving toward the door. “It’s not the time, Barton,” he snapped. “Move it or be prepared to do drills from now until kingdom come.”
Steve looked toward the water. Tony saw something flicker across his face but he couldn’t put a name to it.
“People have said much worse to me. It’s not like I couldn’t just make time to come out and do something.”
“I know, but...forget it.”
Natasha just swatted at him. “No, I’m just saying that he’s a good guy, but he can be a little much sometimes.”
“Mmm,” Steve hummed. “That sounds like a wonderful plan.”
“It’s not like you to not double check and make sure the place is empty before you start something like this.”
He put a finger under the genius’ chin and lifted his face. “This isn’t as much your fault as you like to think. It’s Obie’s. He’s the one trying to have you killed. You have done nothing to deserve that. Even I know that and I’m just a genie.”
“Uh, no, because I have reason enough to trust them!”
Steve was still staring when a very British voice came as if from everywhere all at once. “The man you know as Johann Schmidt appears to be causing a disturbance on sublevel C in the main server room.”
*****
I can’t get angry with you for being disobedient because disobedience is what got me into the SSR program in the first place. I also made several reckless calls.
Natasha turned out to be a good ear when Steve was struggling to hold it together on the worst of his days. In the midst of her trying to reinvent herself after spilling all of SHIELD’s, and in turn HYDRA’s, deepest secrets onto the Internet, still found time to email Steve, text Steve, call him even. She wasn’t the only one though. They all reached out to him for different reasons, but did so in order to keep him grounded.
Steve rolled his eyes. “I just do. Do you always talk this much?”
Tony grinned and reached out to take Steve’s hand. “It’s not like a circuit board or anything, but I hope you’ll think it’s neat anyway.”
Steve nodded and began thrusting his hips slowly, Tony moaning and his own hips lifting to meet Steve’s thrusts. Steve took that as his cue to begin moving faster, his hips snapping forward then moving a hand to Tony’s cock and wrapping around it. He began to pump it in time with his own thrusts.
“Don’t worry about it, Pep. We’ll think of something. Just…” he let out a large breath. “Thanks. I’ll...think of something.”
Steve’s words were cut off by a loud groaning sound of metal twisting and glass shattering all around them. He pushed himself faster and yanked Tony forward, far enough away that the building imploding only covered them in a fine layer of ash.
Tony pushed the papers away until they were scattered. “He’s been trying to make me a part of a war I didn’t even know existed. God—these emails alone— and I did nothing.“
Tony grinned at Clint. “Because this is my tower, my rules.”
“There is a terrorist organization known as the Ten Rings. They’ve been receiving a lot of your weapons. It took a lot of digging, but I found hard copies, encrypted messages, drives that don’t have any connection with Stark Industries at all. You were scheduled for a demonstration next month in Afghanistan. You were going to show them the Jericho.”
Two months. It had taken two months of meetings with lawyers, meetings with government officials, meetings with the press--- meetings with what felt like everyone on Earth.
Two months later Tony was trying very hard to make sure he wasn’t pressuring Steve into anything. Steve had started removing Tony’s shirt before the genius could register what was happening. He was being manhandled and he had to stop Steve. He actually stopped Steve while Steve was peeling his clothes off of him, just to make sure Steve was ready for this.
Steve realized his error the second Tony’s face soured. “Of course I’m useful. I’m giving you guys the best material money can buy. You’ve had access to JARVIS, the most advanced piece of technology to date—so yeah. I guess you could say I’m useful, but not necessary.”
A mutter. “Great.” He cleared his throat and set the blowtorch down, replacing it with a hammer. “Let’s do this.”
Tony stared at him. “I don’t want him broken,” he said flatly.
The Avengers had honestly given him more in the ways of unconventional learning experiences and he utilized what he knew in his piano performances. He definitely knew how to work a crowd. He was already notorious for being somewhat mischievous and the only reason Howard let it slide was because the general public thought it made him more interesting. If Liberace and Elton John could do it, then so could he.
And I suppose what I’m really trying to say is...
Steve, for his part, could only watch the spectacle with what was mostly feigned annoyance to cover what was a sense of growing amusement and maybe a little awe. “That’s uh--something.” He raised one brow, a question on the tip of his tongue. “Where did he come from?”
Steve pulled away, and Tony tried to chase his lips.
“Allow me, Cap.”
“Yes and I’m glad. Tony has been horribly moody that he’s lucky I am even here with him tonight. He had a huge fight with his father after the fight he had with you and he’s been pretty angry ever since. It’s not so much at you. Well not anymore.” She sighed. “He misses you but he won’t say it to anyone. You have to read between the lines with Tony because he’s not capable of dealing with high emotional situations. He hasn’t called you because he’s angry at himself more than anything and believes he’s a monumental screw up. He’ll never stop believing that, but maybe you can prove otherwise to him.”
Pepper wrinkled her nose at Tony's current lack of manners while Steve continued to cheerfully enjoy the lo mein noodles from the last carton he grabbed.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You’re ridiculous.”
They had been in the middle of a Christmas Eve battle as luck would have it and Tony ended up being hurtled into the freezing waters of the Hudson River, his suit already losing power before that had happened. Steve had stared on helplessly, screaming Tony’s name as he ran toward the water but stopped when the Hulk made it in there first.
“You okay, babe?” His smile was innocent (well as innocent as Tony was capable of) and he took a sip of his ginger ale while the blond blushed.
Tony’s eyes were wide, frantic yet unmoving. This was his fault. He never should have wished for Steve to be there. He’d been stupid. Steve hadn’t been himself since he’d heard the news from Tony and he hadn’t been the same when he came back into the workshop. Now he was going to get Steve wounded, maybe even killed, and it would be on his shoulders.
“Yeah, that’s his name, don’t wear it out.”
Actions were all well and good and made a statement, but that moment proved just how much three little words can really change your life.
“He’d call me a punk probably.”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., dial the police. Right now.”
Bucky glanced at the red head. “Should I be worried here or…”
Steve nodded, had felt the same way on several occasions. “You’d be surprised how many people would. I find it’s best not to question it too much.”
When at the door, Steve couldn’t make out any words, just low murmuring followed by an extended period of silence. Tony made his way to the door about five minutes later, eyes red but steady. He walked passed Steve and out the door, making his way determinedly to the car.
“Because we’re stupid?”
“I don’t know what that means.”
Tony hurried to help Pepper to the door and handing her a thumb drive, “You have two now. Find a computer, it doesn’t matter where, and upload everything.”
Steve stood up and brushed off his pants. “You know, that actually took less time than I thought it would.”
Steve tilted his head thoughtfully, looking from Peter to Tony and then shrugged. “Well, if Peter thinks it’s a good idea, then maybe we should.”
Steve turned away and started making his way toward the door. “That’s a good start. Leave the rest to my team. We’ll keep you updated.”
Steve became a bit wary at the tone of Bruce’s voice. “Yeah?”
“The lack of faith you guys have in me is doing nothing for my ego.”
The genius snorted. “Sad excuses for helper bots.”
When they reached Tony’s temporary bedroom, Steve had to take a moment to figure out when an explosion might have occurred. There were tools everywhere. Each of them took turns spending time with Tony while he worked to make sure he wouldn’t get hurt, but everyone knew Tony preferred Steve’s presence.
Clint not so subtly jerked his head upward a few times, eyes fixed on a spot over Tony’s head.
Tony tilted his head. “No. I guess I don’t. Not my problem. People are paid to handle that.”
When he looked up at Steve, the soldier was blushing a little and Tony had to smile. “Wow. Uh...you’re going to be really disappointed when you see mine.”
A hand landed on his shoulder and he jumped, spinning around quickly.
“What do you think? How many bullets do you think your magical friend could take? Hmm?”
“I’ve had one my whole life. One of the perks of being a Stark.”
“What was it Aunt Peggy used to tell me? Barnes made his choice. You didn’t force him to go. He followed you because you were his best friend and he trusted you.”
Both Pepper and Rhodey snorted. “No offense, Tones, but our lives and jobs were compromised the moment we became friends.”
Steve watched as one of the superiors overlooking repairs in that area rushed up eager to shake Tony’s hand. Tony accepted and the man beamed.
The soldier wrapped his arms around Tony and breathed heavily. Tony could tell Steve was about to fall asleep.
I could probably throttle you for how hard you are on yourself, but I feel I owe it to you to say this once.
Steve had no idea how to respond to that. Luckily he didn’t have to as Bucky was showing them to their table. Double dates were already among Steve’s least favorite things. Double dates who were preparing to listen to a heavy metal band while drinking the night away were even further down on his list. How could this be a date? How do you get to know someone that way? Bucky had always told him he was too old-fashioned, but Steve thought there was some merit to doing things the old-fashioned way, and he was also a hopeless romantic. He wasn’t the type who was in it for a quick lay before moving on to the next girl.
Steve raced through the door, adrenaline numbing the pain from his injuries. “Tony, what—“
“You’re going to paint a target on your back, you know.”
“Then give him a reason to trust you first. So far all he knows is that you want weapons and armor from him. He just escaped from HYDRA. You know what they’re like.”
“Great,” he said with a smile, handing the phone back over.
“You’re strange.”
He pulled the goggles completely from his head and ran a hand through his hair. “I guess that could have gone worse.” And then he remembered he still had Cap to deal with. He supposed it was by some small miracle that Steve was nowhere to be found after that call.
“I’ve got eyes on Stane,” he whispered breathlessly into his comm, pulling out his gun and ducking behind the desk when a SWAT team went barreling past him. “He’s got a woman with him, strawberry blonde hair, fair skin. She’s Tony’s PA. I’m going after them, Barton, Wilson, get up high and make sure no one is exiting the building that shouldn’t be. The rest of you, continue to help keep everything contained.”
“Hey, Tony,” a voice that sounded a lot like Steve’s said quietly. When a face came into view it confirmed Tony’s notion that it was Steve talking to him. He looked sad. He looked tired. He looked worried. Tony didn’t like any of these looks on Steve because that meant Steve was upset about something.
“Oh, really? The biggest?”
Tony pushed passed Steve the second the lock clicked open, practically shoving Steve into the door in his effort to look around. He paused in the entranceway, eyes searching when they found Steve’s. “What is this place?”
“But you did. That’s what you have to focus on. I get it though. You have to remember the past and all that. Just don’t let yourself get stuck there, Steve. Okay?”
“No comments from the magical peanut gallery,” Tony grumbled.
The first thing he did was locate a small practice room with a piano in it so he could rehearse his pieces in private. He wasn’t worried at all about screwing them up because he’d played them for several hours on a daily basis and dreamed of the sheet music that night. It was a problem he had. His brain never turned off. He was always composing a new piece, making adjustments to ones he’d written previously, added a bit of flare to others. He was nothing if not persistent on improving the quality of his compositions and making sure there was always something new and enjoyable to entertain his audience.
“That almost renders me obsolete then, huh?”
Steve was already blushing when he stood up to grab his guitar. Tony was pleased to take note of this and filed all of Steve’s blushes away as one of the most adorable things Steve does.
A redhead appeared at the door and gave him a once over. “I approve.”
“You haven’t done much to raise me at all,” he said under his breath, but Howard had heard him anyway, clear as day.
“Hopefully not become a bitter, controlling man like you.” That slipped out and Tony hadn’t meant for it to.
Tony winced. “I’m really sorry about that. I didn’t think…”
Steve followed after him, not a word uttered between them until Steve was buckled in and preparing to back out of the driveway.
“Hey, Pete,” Steve said, crouching down. “Merry Christmas.”
“Steve’s been through a lot, Stark. He’s lost a lot of people. Don’t be another person he ends up losing.” Clint continued to play.
Steve hid a grin behind his hand.
Steve was silent for a moment. “You actually are my favorite, Tony.”
“Go back to sleep,” came the tired, half-asleep reply from Steve, whose eyes were still closed. He loosened his grip on Tony’s wrist long enough to slide his hand into the brunet’s, pulling it close to his chest. The genius frowned and bit his lip. He hadn’t exactly noticed how exhausted Steve had been, but he could see the dark circles under his eyes and realized he might have been a little unfair earlier when he’d been angry.
Steve chewed on the corner of his lip for a moment before sighing. “His name is Tony.”
“I am.” He smiled. “I am.”
“I’ve been saying your name for like two whole minutes. At first it was just about getting your attention and then it turned into seeing how long it would take if I just kept saying your name. I got impatient though so here we are now.”
The thing of it is though, sometimes...sometimes Tony hated having to go to such great lengths to prove himself to others. Steve often told him that he did not have to prove anything, but Tony ignored him on that because Steve was wrong. Tony would never get to stop trying to prove himself to others. He’d screwed up one too many times in life, hurt one too many people, cost one too many people their own lives, and now he was paying the price. Words would not win this battle against himself. Against everyone else. He had accepted that before he’d even taken up the mantle of Iron Man. He’d never once deluded himself into believing that someone would change their minds after their first meeting and decide that he wasn’t such a bad guy after all. Tony Stark himself did not believe it.
“Ridiculous,” the genie responded dryly.
Thirty minutes later Tony called.
“I guess I can see your point.” He cleared his throat and eyed the guitar still resting against the walls. “So you were going to dazzle me today, right?”
“And miss dinner? Bruce made us a whole meal. There’s also pie. Or cake. Some sort of celebratory dessert. Natasha’s here for a visit so since we have everyone here, team bonding. You love team bonding.”
Bucky shook his head. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea. No one really appreciated being sniped with paint pellets that one time.”
“I think we’re getting one right now.”
Natasha Romanoff stood with her arms crossed over her chest and was glaring at Justin Hammer and some slimeball friend of his she couldn't even remember the name of.
Bucky sat down on the bed and nudged Steve. “Sit up, old man,” he instructed and Steve snorted. “You need to learn to hold your liquor. Here.”
The AI was silent for a moment. “I am currently running his face through the entire Internet database. It would seem a match has popped up in S.H.I.E.L.D.’s records.”
“I didn’t realize Peggy had a cousin. She never mentioned you.”
“Cap, calm down. You were right.”
“I’m not comfortable. I’m cold and my back hurts because of these shabby sleeping conditions.”
I was the son Howard was burdened with. Being like you could have possibly made my lot in life a little easier if I could just get dear old dad to talk about me the way he always doted on you. I spent most of my young life competing with a ghost.
Tony tuned that out.
Steve shook his head and couldn’t restrain himself from smiling amusedly down at the bot who had taken to zooming around the room again, this time chirping ‘love, love, love you’ over and over in that high pitched voice.
Tony grinned. “Consider him a guinea pig then. If that makes you feel any better.”
“I have about 1,000 things I need you to do!”
“Steve. Fuck. Steve.” He shut his eyes again. “I’m about to come.”
“Peter will always be my priority.”
“Okay fine. Just remember that I’m putting off a lot of work I need to finish all for you.”
“Captain,” came a high chirping voice from the ground.
They both stared at each other for a bit longer than necessary, faces just inches apart when Peter let out a whoop and found himself surrounded by a large pile of books from Steve and Tony. That was among the many many gifts Peter had also received from Natasha and Pepper and Happy and Clint and Bruce and Thor.
“Steve, we’re heading out! Gonna go watch The Avengers play so Bucky can stop fretting over his new lady love.”
Tony knew he would always find a way to screw things up and this time he did it without being any wiser to what was going on.
“Believe it or not, I’m not good at making first impressions.”
“It’s fine. I apparently had to be approved by the one with the red hair Peter calls Tasha first.”
This time Steve turned and lurched forward, getting right up in the genius’ face. “If you don’t stop talking right now, so help me god, I will find a way to make you shut up.”
It didn’t matter. So what if Tony ignored him? So what if it kind of really bothered him just a bit? It was...disrespectful is all. That was it. It was a much more reasonable explanation than Bucky’s theory that Steve was just upset because Tony didn’t want to ‘play’ with him. No, that was ridiculous, they weren’t children on the playground, a fact he’d made sure to let Bucky know, just before he slammed the other man to the spar mat, pinning him until he cried uncle.
“I can’t take it without the artist signing it first.”
“Hey,” Bucky chimed in, pointing a finger at the genius with his good hand. “I can still throttle you with this hand, punk.”
Rhodey looked skeptical. “And now it is?”
He pulled his wallet from his back pocket and was about to order a ticket when a voice stopped him.
Nuts-N-Bolts paused his movements, eyes peering up at Steve. “You will not turn me off, Captain. You love me. You are still a jerk,” and gave a particularly hard nip at Steve’s left ankle.
“Maybe if you shut your trap for five seconds you’d have heard me say that I can only grant wishes to my master. You’re my master.”
He sort of thought he was doing them a favor by that point.
“No respect at all,” Tony grumbled, sliding down in his seat a little with his arms folded across his chest, bottom lip jutted out in a pout that was just a little too tempting for Steve to look at for too long.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Are you kidding me? All you ever had to do was ask.”
Steve snorted and started running as well. “How could I when you’re taking all the stupid with you?”
“I’m so sorry, Steve!” His voice was broken. “I’m sorry. I’m not...I don’t deserve you. I’m not good enough...I made a mistake and I don’t know why you aren’t disgusted with me.”
“I betrayed you.”
Tony’s eyes were wide as he stared at Steve, a smile edging its way through his moments of insecurity.
“By the way, you scared the shit out of me, Ninja Steve. To what do I owe the pleasure?”
“She said I was pretty good, which coming from her is practically the highest of compliments.”
-----
Steve cut Tony off before he could work himself up to a truly impressive ramble. “Thank you, Stark.”
Peter scrunched up his little nose. “Don’t call me kiddo. I’m not a kid.”
Clint picked up again. “It’s obvious he’s head over heels for you. I don’t know the last time we saw him this happy, if ever.”
“How big?”
Steve chuckled. “Tis the season.”
“So you’re basically saying that you’re mad I don’t join you guys for Scrabble night?”
That made Steve laugh. He loved Steve’s laugh.
Tony shrugged, grinning. “Well you didn’t die so that was a definite plus.” He reached for Steve’s hand.
Tony was a little clingy. He could admit it even if he didn’t like to. The truth was that he had a hard time making friends and he was terrified of losing the ones he had now. His social skills sometimes left something to be desired when he wasn’t putting on a show for the reporters and camera people.
“Tony…”
Steve laughed and kissed Tony again. He told Tony he was ready to take him out on a date. He was ready to try moving on. He’d visited Peggy on his trip. It hurt to reach that point and it stung to see that she got to live her life, but he was more overjoyed than anything because she was happy. That was all that really mattered to him.
Steve gave him one more long suck before pulling off of Tony’s cock with a pop. He looked up at Tony, licking his reddened lips and moved, climbing up on the bed. Tony scooted back to make room for him, Steve hovering over Tony’s body before leaning down to kiss him. Tony gripped Steve’s arms, his back arching again as he searched for any friction he could for his throbbing member.
The first piece he was using was not his, but one he’d heard in a preview at one of the few movies he’d been able to attend recently. It was going to be his show opener before he added in one of his original compositions. This was one he’d be performing for the first time in front of an audience and he felt the opener was enough of an attention grabber. Some people knew it, others didn’t. He had a fondness for it, which was the main reason he’d decided on it.
Tony sighed. “I don’t know. When I was in college, I wanted to create robots. I wanted to advance the technology of our time by leaps and bounds. I wanted to make dad proud but I didn’t want to become him.”
Steve acted like he really needed to think about this. “No. Sounds like a bit of a challenge. I feel like we’ll probably end up butting heads on a few things, but what’s the fun in a relationship if we can’t challenge each other?”
-----
“You mean like now?”
"Don't worry that adorable head over it right now. Do you eat?"
Coulson smiled. “Duly noted.”
Bucky had laid on the ground afterwards, chest heaving as he caught his breath, his eyes narrowed at Steve who’d barely broken a sweat, and kindly informed Steve that he needed to get over himself and stop letting Starks bratty attitude affect him as much as it was. He’d sat up then, punched Steve lightly in the calf and continued to explain all the ways in which Steve’s aggression skyrocketed to unhealthy levels any time he was annoyed and the others couldn’t handle the aggression fueled training sessions much longer.
And I guess that brings me to my point.
“Open your mind! Think four, five, ten dimensions. Don’t get stuck in that three dimension space that you call your head.”
Steve was only more confused now. “What?”
Tony’s eyes were closed and Steve wanted more than anything for Tony to look at him. He knew this was Tony’s way of apologizing for his part. Tony chose to express all of his feelings through songs because he was unable to do it without a little help. That’s just how Tony was.
Steve promptly shut his eyes. “Why are you screaming?” he whispered.
With a hum, he turned his head and started watching the club goers dancing on the floor. His eventual goal was to have Steve out there, dancing with him while the vibrator in Steve’s ass was on its highest setting. Until then he would just bring Steve close to the edge as many times as he could before Steve would become a panting, needy mess.
Steve sneered, but didn’t reply.
“Aye Aye, Captain.” The bot chirped and Steve’s nose wrinkled. “I...love..you?” Nuts-N-Bolts said, words drawn out as if he were trying to understand the phrase before repeating them a lot surer than before, tiny hand clamped onto Steve’s pant leg. “I love you!”
*****
Tony turned the last corner and made his way quickly to the door he knew Obie had Pepper behind, in his own goddamn office, “Jarvis, honey, go help the good Captain in clearing up that disturbance on sublevel C you reported.”
Tony was quiet. And very still. Steve looked up and realized Tony was staring at him, frozen and he felt his heart break a little.
“Of course, Steve. Just be safe, okay?”
So maybe he wasn’t proud of the way he ended up in the hospital. He’d probably never feel like he was good enough for Steve, but he’d at least try because Steve was worth the effort. He might even be inclined to work less. Maybe. At least he didn’t die though. He was given a chance to have what he wanted in the end, and that was worth it.
Steve looked up at Fury, eyebrows raised.
With that he turned, tossing the bottle over his shoulder as he did and walked away. Normally he’d probably be turned on by something like that but he was in his own version of hell at the moment.
Tony would have to be an idiot not to find that a little adorable. Or a lot of adorable. And the smile Steve gave him had him smiling back like a huge idiot.
The genie gave Tony a rather unimpressed look.
Moments later they were both in the kitchen and everyone was seated around the table. Tony eyed the food, hoping what was there was actually enough because Thor and Steve had huge appetites. Truth be told, he was pretty hungry himself, and why wasn’t anyone digging in?
“You’re alive and that’s what’s important. I’m just going to check a few vitals and make sure you have enough morphine. I’ll be out of your hair soon.”
‘C’mon, Steve. No time for teasing right now,” the genius whispered breathlessly. “I need you in me like five hours ago.”
Bucky, on the other hand, was already schmoozing up to his date who he couldn’t recall hearing the name of and this was exactly why Steve hated double dates. He absentmindedly pulled apart some straw paper in front of him. He was hoping a few drinks would calm his nerves enough that he’d find the courage to talk. In proper, coherent sentences even.
“What can I say?” he rasped out. “I take after my father.”
Tony chuckled and ran his fingers over the back of Steve’s sweat-slicked neck. “You’re really enjoying this, aren’t you?”
“It’s got nothing on the genie get-up.”
Steve wrinkled his nose in disgust and turned the page with a little more force than was particularly necessary. It was just, he wondered what it was like, to be as young as Tony and living smack dab in the middle of the media’s lime light.
Tony nodded.
“Peter, don’t let anyone puke in the bouncy castle.”
“For…getting your business together. Getting your life back. Hopefully no one will underestimate you again.”
It was rare for people to see Steve in his punk rock attire unless he was performing and tonight wasn’t any different. The venue they were performing in that night was featuring a Metal-Punk Mash Up of various local bands and they were one of the last ones to go on stage. There were five bands total set to play two songs each and the Howling Commandos were number four on the list. Steve played bass next to Morita who talked about how much he enjoyed shredding up his guitar. Bucky was their lead singer, Gabe the keyboardist, Dum Dum on drums, Falsworth on second guitar and Jacques on third guitar.
“Sharon Carter. Nice to meet you, Steve.”
“I don’t like to meet the expectations of others.”
Tony was cursing the coffee machine. The coffee machine appeared to be fighting back.
“You sure about that? I mean, if you want to talk about it, you can. Did you and Bucky get to ta-?”
“And you’re sure of this? Like you were sure of going out alone.”
Steve and Bruce shared a look, confusion evident on both their faces.
“Bucky, for God sake!” Natasha hit him on the back of the head and Steve took that as his cue to walk into the other room to make their order. Yeah he was glad that Bucky was happy, but a small part of him wondered if he’d get to have that too, especially with how much Tony travelled.
“You’re going to get your car towed, you know?”
Steve grinned. “I have no idea what he looks like.”
Tony wasn’t expecting that. “Uh...yeah? What’s this about?”
Bucky laughed. “Yeah well it’s not my fault you suck at finding good places to hide. You’re a big guy.”
Steve just frowned and stayed close to the door, looking like he was ready to bolt at any given moment.
“You’re thinking too loud, Tony.”
Steve grabbed the paper and allowed himself to relax back into his seat, if only for a moment. His eyes scanned the pages, and maybe the newspaper wasn’t the best idea to relax with when every other story had something or another to do with Obadiah Stane, Stark Industries, or more speculations as to the ‘unknown’ whereabouts of Anthony Edward Stark.
Steve opened his mouth to argue with Bucky because he had his own reasons for being hesitant, but then he realized he didn’t have a particularly well thought out rebuttal and yeah, maybe he was too busy being scared to let something like that happen. So he shut his mouth, sat back in his chair and then finally looked away from his friend a few moments later.
Tony was thankful for the fact that she hadn’t killed him in his sleep yet.
He didn’t wait for a response before sprinting for the door. He thought that if he could flag down a taxi he’d make it in time. He hoped he had enough money to get in. He had just gotten paid and he was sure it wouldn’t be cheap to go, but he’d sacrifice two paychecks if he could get Tony to speak to him again.
The artwork for this fic will come shortly!
Steve finds Tony's letter a few months later and has a reply of his own.
Tony sighed, not impressed with Bruce’s answer. “Can we go now? I’m hungry.”
“It’s…” Tony paused. “I love it but I do it for fun. It's just a hobby. I can live without doing these things, but I enjoy the distraction. I wouldn't want to end up being that guy who's just in a band.”
“I’m not going to last much longer, Tony.”
“Tony, oh god, I…” Steve was struggling to speak, moans breaking up his words. Tony could tell he was close and he kissed Steve gently, nibbling on his bottom lip while he continued moving his hips, increasing the friction until Steve reached climax, movements becoming jerky as he splashed against both of them. The look on Steve’s face, as he was coming undone, was one that Tony committed to memory. Seeing Steve topple over the edge so beautifully finally pulled Tony over and he came with a shout against Steve’s lips.
“Tony, now would be a good time to make a wish, don’t you think?”
“Sir, I would advise---”
“Yeah well don’t get all sappy on me now, Cap. We both have come drying in our pants at the moment. I think that kills the romance.”
“So are we...?”
“I’m fine!” Bucky gasped. “A few of Pierce’s guards. Got’em down, took Pierce out.” He groaned. “I think my fucking leg is broken though. No, wait. Yeah, definitely broken. Goddamit.”
“About my life before the genie bottle? Everything.”
The blond shut his eyes and counted to ten in his head  before giving up around 8 and speaking impatiently. “Stark.”
Steve swallowed and took a step closer to the genius. “So is this goodnight?”
“Nothing happened, Tony. I can tell because you’re still talking.”
Natasha gave him a small, knowing grin. “I’ll say.”
“That’s what I thought.”
“Thanks, Steve. Really. It’s...wow.”
“Oh. Ah, okay.”
After three days of running on fumes and junk food, Tony finally left the comfort of his workshop and went to the kitchen for some coffee. Clint was trying to teach Hulk how to successfully flip pancakes and failing if the crushed pans were anything to go by.
“It’s just that...you don’t really seem all that interested in doing things with the team outside of our battles.”
Tony grinned wickedly. “Why was he impressed or why was he bored? I mean, really, I’m sure he's impressed for the same reason anyone with eyes would be but he’s bored because he gets lonely. Bruce and I can’t give all of our time to him so I told him to go play.”
“Peter would be happy if you showed up. Like I said, if we’re going to do this, I want Peter to have as much time with you as I do.”
Steve’s eyes were back on Tony. He smiled. “Nothing at all, master.”
“Well, technically I still am. At least as far as Obadiah is concerned.” Tony glanced between his two friends, eyes wide and serious. “I don’t want to put you guys in danger. I thought about calling earlier, when I first escaped but it wasn’t a good idea.”
“Well if you don’t want that to happen then you need to rethink your choices in life and remember what’s important to you. You’re willing to throw all of that away by being in a band?”
Steve had moved his other hand to Tony’s hip, but he had to stop kissing Tony to bury his face in the genius’ neck, speaking hoarsely. “Tony, I’m close. God, I’m so close.” He reached his hand between their bodies and began jerking Tony off in earnest, covering the brunet’s cock with quick, shallow pumps that had Tony moaning louder and louder, Steve picking up the pace on Tony’s cock as well as the speed with which he continued to thrust into the genius.
“I’m not looking for a bomb. I’m looking for a reliable supply," Steve assured him. “Weapons. Plus armor for protection. I want to keep my team safe. I want to have the upper hand on HYDRA. They’ve been a problem for far too long and I want to take them out of the equation. As much as you don’t need the ego boost, your products are the best out there. Ten thousand times more reliable than the Hammer tech we somehow ended up with. Help me, help you.”
“It’s not important. Just drop it.”
“Seconded,” Thor called out, laughing right before Steve heard a loud smash make its way through the com, like a hammer on stone.
“Nothing,” Tony said, a little too quickly. He plastered a smile on his face. “It’s true. They’re here, the good Captain’s got one on as you can see. You’re welcome to try yours on as well.”
Steve responded with a devilish smile. “Only if you play your cards right.”
Now that his head was much clearer, though, he was able to notice things that he had missed the day before. He wouldn’t be able to make enough of a shelter but it’d be something. As long as he didn’t end up going all Castaway and naming an inanimate object to be his best friend then he’d be good. He was Tony Stark after all. He’d find a way to get off the island. He wasn’t a genius for nothing.
Steve sent a shot flying at something that looked important and very much electrical behind Schmidt’s head. The other man didn’t flinch, just smiled wider and laughed. “The virus is everywhere. Do you believe that shooting one server will hinder me?” He started pacing around the room. “Men like Stark. Obadiah. They are just as corrupt as we are, the only difference is they are praised for their death toll while we are shunned for ours, feared for the change we propose. They spin that fear into a guise of protection for the American people when they could harness that fear! Take it and grow! They hold the world in the palm of their hands and do nothing with it.” He sneered, “but not me.”
Steve followed quietly, trying to ignore the discomfort in his pants now. He wasn’t prepared for the limousine waiting when they made it outside.
“What?” Tony asked, not looking at Steve, instead staring down at Obie who wasn’t even attempting to hide the pain he was in any longer, gasping with each breath.
Tony grumbled. His son Peter was bouncing on his bed at the ungodly hour of six in the morning. He was laying on his stomach, half of his face smooshed into his pillow and one arm dangling off the side of the bed.
Finally they had relented after offering the team very strict instructions on what needed to be done for the billionaire.
Steve let out a breath and gently held Tony’s face between his hands as he returned the kiss. This was happening and Tony wanted it too. He tightened his grip and pulled the brunet’s face closer to him as the kiss intensified. The brush of Tony's knuckles against his stomach was all the warning he got before he felt Tony's dexterous fingers wrap around his dick. Steve jumped as Tony gave his dick one long slow pump, and slowly let out a shaky breath.
Bucky stared at between Steve and Zola with wide eyes, gaze lingering for a moment longer on the blood oozing from the hole in the other man’s head, dripping down his face and onto the floor.
Unfortunately, Steve couldn’t ask for help from the genius.
“You don’t like it?”
Tony pouted in a manly way, which Rhodey called him out on after several moments of silence.
“Mmhh.” A few minutes passed, in which time Steve tried to decide if he should snap Tony out of whatever place he’d fallen into or let it run its course, before Tony jerked his eyes back to Steve and began circling him, grabbing at the fabric in between recording voice notes.
They tell you that you should never meet your heroes because they are always going to let you down.
Steve hummed. “Go back to sleep, Tony.”
“You do make such a lovely picture right now,” Tony said when he pulled away from the kiss. “I’m tempted to have you be the one to fuck me when we get home while that vibrator rubs against your prostate continuously. How many times do you think you can come from that?”
The soldier exhaled and smiled. “No. Not at all. I was hoping it wouldn’t be.”
The genius merely fell back on his heel and gave Steve a look so full of disbelief that Steve felt just a little bit offended.
So that’s how Clint ended up being forced into giving archery lessons to a child prodigy who watched him with fascination. Tony had called him Robin Hood and said he wanted to try. Tony was nothing if not eager to learn, and Clint had to reassure him that it was okay if he wasn’t good at it. Tony had looked as though he wanted to cry and Clint reminded him that he was not able to build his own circuit board.
Bucky nodded and walked back toward the front, probably to find Natasha again.
“As you wish, sir.”
Tony’s eyes shot up.
He found himself standing in a hallway with two doors at the other end. One of the rooms was obviously for the owner of the place and the other door was barely ajar, but enough for Steve to hear a light melody playing and one that people were not apt to hear in a place like this. He wasn’t even sure how his ears were able to pick up on the tune after The Avengers had finished their concert, and maybe his mind was playing tricks on him, but curiosity got the better of Steve and he followed the sound.
Steve had never intended for this to be his life. It had all happened mostly by accident, as much as you can call being in the wrong place at the wrong time-- or perhaps that wasn’t quite right, being in the wrong place at the right time was a more astute observation-- an accident.
Tony grinned and walked over to Steve to pull him into a hug. “I should start making you go to these things since you know my actual identity now.”
“Is he on drugs then?”
“Well I look forward to seeing more of her in the future then,” Steve said with a mischievous grin.
“And I really don’t want to talk about it right now.”
Tony just stared at him.
His hand froze mid-shake. Sharon. Sharon Carter. He...
Steve regretted his words the moment they left his mouth and he grit his teeth.
It wasn’t the life Steve had ever meant to have, no, but in that moment, the ‘no’ on his tongue contorted until a stronger than expected ‘yes’ made its way out first. Maybe he’d been too naive, he’d definitely been too young, foolish really, and almost desperate to prove himself to anyone who would pay attention.
“Why don’t you find some blankets?”
“Sir, Colonel Rhodes is on the premises. Would you care to send a message telling him you will be up shortly?”
This is how it started though.
“What do you mean?” came the sleepy reply.
The wet warmth against him caught Tony by surprise and he rocked nearly off the edge. But just as he reigned himself back in Steve began to suck. Tony’s eyes clenched tighter as he felt it all coming to a close, it was like a rolling wave starting both in his toes and going up his spine. He tried to warn Steve but all he managed was getting a tight fist of Steve’s hair and then he was coming. He gasped out Steve’s name as his cock gave spurt after spurt. At some point he was pretty sure he passed out, and when he came to it was to Steve placing a kiss on his lips. Steve was smiling a little in triumph and Tony knew exactly how to wipe that smile off his face. He let a lazy smirk cross his face before reaching back down for Steve’s cock. He wrapped one hand around it and pumped up giving his wrist a twist, Steve’s smile faltered his mouth instead shaping a nice O. Tony let his other hand grasp Steve’s balls and cupped and rubbed them until Steve let out a choked off groan. Tony added a squeeze with the twist and soon Steve was barely holding back from thrusting into his hand.
The blond laughed lightly and pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “You’re never going to forgive me for this, are you?”
“Tony, you were supposed to be on a plane to Japan! I’ve got shareholders breathing down my neck because you missed this meeting, which I might remind you, is the one that was rescheduled because you were in the hospital for the first one.”
Unable to keep up with his train of thought had Tony smirking at the blond.
“So are you trying to tell me to go for it or to stop?” Steve arched an eyebrow.
The team looked varying degrees of shocked and thoroughly unimpressed.
Steve rolled his eyes. “How do I always get stuck with clean up duty when it involves vomit?”
Tony pounced on Steve, arms wrapping around his neck, body pressed against Steve’s as he kissed him roughly. It was downright filthy the way Tony was rocking his hips against Steve’s. Steve gave just as good as he got, he and Tony both knowing that if anyone saw them, they’d probably be escorted from the club. For some reason, that seemed to turn Steve on even more.
“No thanks. Knowing you I’ll wake up with sound effects every time I move the arm.”
“Pizza will be here in 20.” Natasha took a seat next to Bucky again and gave Steve an appraising look. “Just so you know, Tony can’t stop talking about you.”
“I’ll keep in touch.”
Steve couldn’t help but roll his eyes despite the small smile on his face.
Tony looked around the room a second time, eyes clearer as they swept over everything within their range. “You know, I can do better? I can upgrade this so that it’s safer.”
“No problem?” He was questioning that. “I’m not going to like what’s following this am I?”
Steve mentally steeled himself for the ride home, hoping that Bucky would get so distracted with his own story that he’d forget about Steve and how spectacularly he’d managed to embarrass himself in such a short amount of time.
“Well let me be the first one to tell you that you did an outstanding job protecting me. Really, guys. Bravo!”
Steve showed up on Tony’s doorstep, tugging nervously at the tie he’d chosen to wear. He wasn’t sure how to dress really, but he figured that since it was a first date he’d stick with a suit and tie. Peter answered the door before Steve could even knock.
Steve complied, slowly pressing the digit further in, other hand massaging Tony’s thigh as he did so. Once it was all the way in, he slowly began thrusting his finger in and out, listening for any sound of pain from Tony.
Of all people.
Steve had his arms crossed over his chest as he leaned against the wall, watching Tony and Bruce while Bruce checked up on him.
“I shouldn’t have either, but it happened and we’ll move on and eventually forget about it.”
“Well that’s hardly fair,” Clint grumbled.
“I’m not really telling you to do either, but I’ve known him longer than you and I’m telling you what there is to know about him. There are some things he’ll have to tell you on his own, but if you want my advice, I think he’s worth it.”
The noise stopped briefly, though Steve stayed alert, waiting-- and there it was again. He stood up from his chair and turned toward the entrance way.
Steve nearly stumbled as he began moving faster through the halls. He heard Bucky behind him, trying to keep pace. “How bad is it?”
Steve leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Tony’s lips. “Tony Stark, don’t you dare say anything like that again. You’re important to us. To me. You’re everything you think you’re not and I’m definitely no better than you. I can’t stop thinking about how I wasn’t able to save you. I almost lost you before I even had you. You are a hero, with or without the suit and I will always admire you and everything you’re able to do. You’re amazing and I just wish you could realize that.”
Tony groaned against Steve’s lips and he immediately began working the soldier’s pants open, hand finding its way down to Steve’s super soldier member. He chuckled after thinking of that and Steve nipped at his bottom lip, stroking up and down the genius’ shaft. He slid his thumb over the slit teasing out a drop of precum and rubbing it over the cock head. Tony nipped at Steve’s lip this time as he worked his hand down the soldier’s shaft, squeezing a little harder as he got closer to the base. His hand stuttered. Steve had managed to use his other hand to work his pants down further before it too joined the party, cupping at his balls, rolling them in his warm palm. Then his hand inched down, back behind the balls rubbing at the stretch of skin just before Tony’s hole. Tony clenched, his whole body shivering with pleasure then stuttering as it tried to both thrust up and back onto Steve’s hand.
While the soldier was busy gathering wood, Tony searched for tools. Any kind of tool. He could work with any kind of tool available. But it was going to be dark soon. And colder than it already was. He sniffled, aggravated that his nose was starting to run and tossed a useless, broken chair leg across the room. If it startled Steve at all, he definitely didn’t show it.
Steve just squeezed his hand.
He waited and watched.
Tony grinned. “Tis the season after all.”
"Stark."
“Cannot compute. I do not understand the language of jerk.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered, pressing their foreheads together. “Stop. It’s okay. Just breathe.”
That was when Steve walked in, donning the ugliest Christmas sweater Tony had ever seen in his life and wearing a smile that could light up a city. Tony liked it when Steve smiled. He liked it when Steve talked. And when he walked. And when he breathed. And when he laughed. And okay okay, he likes Steve. A lot. Big deal. Not the point.
“Rhodey’s here?” Tony’s head shot up. “He didn’t tell me he was dropping by. Tell him to get down here.”
“Please. I want to come. Take me out there.”
“Not tonight.” He rubbed at his forehead. “I haven’t slept much in a...week or so. I’ll pass.”
Steve stilled at the sink, the dishes forgotten as Tony’s thumb slid over the precum that was already leaking from his dick. He shut his eyes and swallowed, letting his head drop while Tony began to slowly stroke up and down his shaft. Tony sucked on Steve’s earlobe once more before smiling into his neck as he worked Steve’s cock harder. He nipped at Steve’s neck lightly before letting go of his cock and moving down further to give his balls a good squeeze.
On Peter’s eighth birthday, Tony and Steve had decided the park would be a good place to have it. Peter had made a lot of friends and the park would be a great place for them to run around so they wouldn’t tear up the house.
Steve sighed. “I don’t know. I wish I knew, but I don’t.”
“Do you just go around groping everyone you meet?”
Steve was well past impatient by the time Tony started muttering about introducing Nuts-N-Bolts to DUM-E and U and whether or not they’d experience new baby jealousy. Steve shut his eyes and rubbed his forehead. “Stark. Stop. Everything is going to be okay. I trust my team to do what needs to be done.”
It took another two weeks for Tony to respond, and Steve couldn’t understand why he actually missed being harassed by the man during those days.
Tony had been sitting on a stool in his kitchen, working on a few notes he needed to use for a presentation he was going to give at the next board meeting, on his StarkPad. He of course knew that he’d remember every small detail without needing to even look at the notes, but he knew the board members would be lost and ask a lot more stupid questions if they didn’t have notes to look at. He hated it when they asked questions. His one goal in life was to make board meetings end as quickly as possible.
She gave him a disbelieving smile. “I’m sure you did. I was hoping you’d possibly be enjoying the evening with me, but I suppose it would have been a bit strange if you had started dating your ex-girlfriend's cousin. Thanks though. If anything it was really nice to finally meet you.”
“I wouldn’t be Tony Stark if I didn’t show off just a little.”
“Thanks.” Tony gave one last look at his holo screen, at every weapon blueprint, everything he’d spent years creating, being deleted from existence. While he wanted nothing to do with weapons anymore, it was still disheartening to see hours of hard work falling down the drain. Hours of work he was having J.A.R.V.I.S. delete from every computer and every file located within Stark Industries computers. The part he was currently struggling with the most was knowing that he had to somehow get out there and destroy the weapons with his name, the ones that were passed on illegally and being used against their intended purpose.
Steve nodded, obliging despite the tent in his pants. Tony knew Steve was grateful, once again, for how dark it was as Steve trailed close behind him, hoping to divert any possible attention away from his awkward shuffle.
Somehow their texting relationship lasted through half the semester when school started again and Steve was honestly concerned as to whether or not Tony was actually planning a wedding. Based on what little he still knew about the guy, it didn’t seem too far off base that he’d plan a wedding to a guy he never met. He was oddly eccentric.
“Do you travel for piano performances? I didn’t know that.”
The blond gave a shrug. “It’s possible, but don’t hold your breath. I’d hate for you to have a brush with disappointment. Besides, maybe I’d want to play one day too.”
“Yes!” Peter called out with joy before opening the door. “Steve! Dad, Steve’s here!”
“Bucky, goddammit.” Steve started running. “Report. What’s happening out there?”
Tony sighed, sagging down into his seat, all traces of confidence gone as he looked down and ran his good hand through his already ruined hair. Steve watched him, saw just how shaken up the Stark heir actually was, the tremors in his hands and the bouncing of his leg almost going unnoticed, would have gone unnoticed if Steve didn’t have such a practiced eye. Steve set his face until he knew it was completely blank, he couldn’t afford to take pity on him, not until they were on the same page.
“No. No it’s not. Our dinner and movie nights are what I look forward to. I like having your full attention when we’re doing something together. I think what I’m trying to say is that I think you’re creating some amazing, really impressive things, but you’re sort of amazing just on your own. Do you understand? I love watching you at work, but I also love it when you take time away from your busy life to buy me some dinner and sit down to watch a current film with me. I know your time is booked, but that’s what I look forward to the most.”
“Someone at Stark Industries is selling my weapons to terrorist organizations. I saw enough while I was in Afghanistan, but I wasn’t able to do anything about it at that moment. Before the plane left I did some investigating slash hacking and…” he frowned. “My weapons have been killing more innocent people than anything. They’re using them against villages where these people have no choice but to give in or die. They’re being forced to leave their homes on foot. Leave everything behind. These terrorists...they’re tearing families apart. They’re killing the ones that dare to rebel. They have executed entire families just to get any sort of information they want. They’re using Stark weapons. They’re using my weapons to scare these villagers into cooperation.” His voice becomes quieter. “You know what these weapons are capable of.”
“You’re the one that asked me out on the date, Stark.”
Tony looked away then and nodded. “I went too far, didn’t I? I can scrap these.”
He’d seen Stark around from time to time, at different socialite events, places to get drunk and make business happen, but he’d never done much more than ignore a slight pass made by the younger man or walk right by him and his group of latchers-on as they cooed and awed over the brunet. It wasn’t until Tony had taken an interest in Bucky’s arm after a random meeting in a coffee shop of all places Bucky could have been, that Steve really had any incentive to say more than a cursory ‘hello’ or ‘if you’ll excuse me’.
Tony chewed his lip. “Is it working?”
“You will be the first to know,” Jarvis intoned.
He barely spoke above a whisper, but he knew Tony would be able to hear him.
Tony looked away, frowning deeply. “There’s nothing to say. Not about my life. It’s the usual. My dad still hates me, my mom doesn’t know what to do with me, and Jarvis is the one who is going to escort me to MIT because neither of my parents can find the time to remember that I exist, that I have a life outside of what my dad has planned for me. Is that what you were looking for?”
He had to stop and blink. And then blink again. He stared at his reflection in the mirror before slowly turning his head to look at Steve. “Did you do this?”
“Could you get any sappier, Cap?” That was supposed to be a joke, but the words got stuck in Tony’s throat and he looked away.
Steve had a great voice. He obviously wasn’t made to be the lead singer of a punk rock band, but he definitely had the voice for this. And Tony had to admit, his guitar playing skills were pretty damn good too. He had no idea how he’d managed to luck out finding Steve the way he had, seeing Steve come back again and then again just to interact with Tony. Tony decided right then and there that Steve was the best thing to ever happen to him, and even shut up that anxious voice in his head that kept telling him it was too soon to feel this way, it should take longer to fall for someone.
Steve gaped. “It wasn’t broken.”
“As you wish, sir.”
It only took Tony another second to get it together before running out the door behind him.
Steve didn’t stop Bucky this time as he surged forward and punched Zola hard enough that Steve could hear something crack—probably a tooth, Steve guessed. Bucky held tight to Zola’s shirt, fist still ready to strike.
Steve felt something heavy drop in his stomach at Tony’s words. “We’re not forcing you to go and we’re not forcing you to stay. Once this is all said in done, that’ll be your choice, but you should know that you haven’t hindered our ability to do our jobs in any way. You’ve been useful, Tony.”
Tony stopped walking and gave Steve a guarded look. “No.”
Tony was just as scared and unsure of himself because his feelings for Steve were just as strong. Yeah it was scary and it might not work out in the end, but then again it could be the only thing either of them wanted for the rest of their lives so it couldn’t be that bad to give it a try.
“That good huh? I’ve never done that to another man before.” He was now feeling a bit shy himself and wondered if he’d be leaving with a raging boner, but that thought is quickly forgotten when Tony feels Steve working open the fly of his pant. The pressure of calloused fingers wrapping around Tony’s dick and his hips buck upwards, a loud groan escaping his lips.
“Yeah all I’m hearing is this applies to me and only me and I carry the weight of the world and all responsibilities on my shoulders.”
“What am I supposed to say to him? Do you have any ideas then? Because I don’t think saying please forgive me for sleeping with the guy who was pretending to be you is a great way to start a conversation.”
Once they were changed and Tony was resting against Steve in bed, the blond yawned. “I love you, Tony. Everything will be okay eventually. Just don’t push me out again.”
Tony grinned. “Missionary position, Cap. You can say it.” He paused. “There’s a first time for everything, yeah?”
.” Tony made sure he said that with every ounce of spite he could.
“Did we order enough pizza?” Steve asked, staring at all the kids that showed up.
“You are officially an old man.”
“Toss me a sweater, Cap. I’m in.”
Steve grabbed Tony and pulled him down to the ground when a series of shots broke through the glass at the lobbies entry way.  Bullets showered over their heads before letting up. Steve rolled to his feet, pulled Tony up a second later.
Tony was going to kill the person responsible for making him go all the way to Russia. In the fucking winter. Unfortunately, he was currently trapped in a shabby cabin in the middle of nowhere with Captain “We Have A Duty” America. A shabby cabin with no electricity, no food, no running water and beds that were probably infested with something Tony didn’t want to imagine. There was also a fireplace. That was the only positive thing about the cabin. If they got a fire started, at least he risked a 50/50 chance of burning to death rather than freezing to death. And he made sure the good captain was able to hear all of his complaints loud and clear.
“Nothing.”
The bots voice came through again, the quality of its voice like an extension of its chirps. “I like big butts and I cannot lie.”
“....Steve?”
“I think Mr Punching Bag is currently winning but I don’t know. I’m not keeping score. You’re back.”
The genius smiled. “I can sense the beginning of a beautiful friendship,” he said somewhat jokingly.
While Tony sat in the back room staring at the piano and waiting he began composing a new piece in his mind. He wasn’t sure where it was coming from or what even brought it on, but he knew he would have to write it quickly so he could perform it at his next concerto. He loved to make sure he always added something new and different to the mix. He loved it even more when his father had no idea what Tony was going to do. He might not enjoy the yelling. He knew Howard knew they were great pieces, but Howard absolutely hated not knowing what Tony was going to do at all times. He liked surprises and new discoveries and Howard just wanted to make sure Tony continued to maintain the integrity of the Stark name.
Steve blushed but he was smiling. “Exactly what I see everytime I look at you.”
“Here’s my number. You should call me sometime.”
“You look better than I do and you were shot.”
“Fine fine,” Tony let out a stuttered breath. “Ineedyourhelp,” he mumbled quickly.
“Yeah,” Tony laughed quietly. “We are. We should fix that if you’re going to be so close by when we start college.”
Thor gave the billionaire a beaming smile. “MOST WONDERFUL! I HAVE HEARD MANY GREAT THINGS OF THIS MIDGARDIAN FEAST AND I AM EAGER TO PARTAKE IN THIS RITUAL SACRIFICE.”
“Likewise, Stark.”
“Tony’s pretty excited too,” Pepper chimed in. “Not that he’ll admit it, but you can see it in his eyes. Probably because you’ll be really close to each other, but what do I know?” She winked.
“Understood”, Steve stood up. “I’ll give you three some privacy.” He directed his attention to Tony. “I’ll meet you at the door,” before turning and walking away.
“You’ve never been the kind of person to run away from your problems. Why start now?”
“Is that something you want?”
“Oookay?”
Rhodey told Tony he was okay with this.
“Yeah! Which one? We haven’t done that in awhile.”
He had a genie to distract him in the meantime. A genie who seemed just as troubled as him, but Tony couldn’t begin to fathom what might be happening in Steve’s head.
He looked up at Steve, surprised to see how genuine his smile was. “Yeah. Of course.” He smiled. “Anytime, Cap.”
Clint smiled. “I bet you’ll hear from him again. Once all this is over?”
“Here’s the thing, Captain.” Rhodey leaned back against the wall with his arms folded over his chest. “I’ve been friends with Tony Stark for more than 20 years. I’ve seen him at his best. And I’ve seen him at his worst. I met him when he was just a kid who wandered into MIT. He was too young to drive when he started MIT. I’m sure you knew that. I was there when his parents were alive. I was there to watch his asshole of a father treat him like shit. I was there when his parents died. I was there when he took over the company, when he was partying, drinking, being a jerk, all of that. I was there when he was kidnapped and I was there when we found him. I watched Tony surpass his father in every conceivable way. I watched him become the person I knew he could be, and he’s a better person than I ever even imagined he could be. Tony’s been through a lot. He’s been hurt. A lot. He likes to think he’s got everything under control and that he isn’t freaking out, but I know him, Steve. I know he takes on responsibility like he’s carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and I know he blames himself for everything that goes wrong. He’s a brilliant man though and I’ll always be proud to call him my best friend. This should probably go without saying but, Captain, if you do anything to hurt him, anything at all, and believe me when I say I’ll be watching you, I will not hesitate to use whatever force possible to make you pay for it. Understood?”
Steve laughed softly. “Wow. It seems you have no use for a genie.”
“Very well, sir. If you would just follow the lights I will lead the way,” the voice said, followed by the ding of an elevator opening down the hall. Steve made his way toward it, only with the slightest bit of trepidation at following a disembodied voice to god only knew where. There wasn’t time to waste though if Red Skull really was in the building.
“I’m waiting patiently for Christmas.”
Now that he was home he should have been working on more of his sheet music, but he found himself pacing back and forth, tapping his fingers against the middle of his chest. It was a habit he’d had since as far back as he could remember. Howard often told him he needed to stop the habit in public but Tony honestly just found the action comforting and it kept him grounded. He wasn’t invincible and he learned that at an early age.
Steve looked away and sighed, rubbing at the back of his neck. “It’s...Tony do you--”
“I’m raising a tiny monster,” Tony muttered before looking back to Steve. “It was nice to meet you, but we better go before the bridezilla breathes fire on us for being late again.”
Tony climbed the footstool because he knew he wasn’t very tall so everyone could just shut up and keep their comments to themselves. He reached up to place the star on top but was disappointed to discover he was still not quite able to reach it. This was going to take some creativity.
Natasha rolled her eyes and grabbed a knife. “You know, Stark, we really do appreciate how much time you spend making sure we’re all safer when we go out there and the way you are constantly trying to improve it all.”
“Uh...no?”
Steve lifted his arms just barely and turned a complete circle in front of everyone before stopping with an expectant smile on his face. “Well?”
Tony shrugged again and wrapped his tiny arms around Steve’s neck. “Maybe that’s why my dad likes you more than everyone else. You make people feel good about themselves.”
Steve rolled his eyes upwards. “Of course he has. Keep me updated. If anything goes wrong—“
Tony opened his mouth to give Steve an answer but the blond had turned on his heel and left Tony standing there.
Tony smiled, leaning up to kiss Steve. “Oh, baby, I’m just getting started. Did I not mention we’d be testing your refractory period all night?”
“Goodbye, Peter. I’ll see you again next weekend. Goodbye, Tony. Good luck with the wedding stuff. Congratulations.”
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
Tony stood up, cracking his back and then yawning. “Steve, not that I’m trying to be the downer here, but why exactly are we doing this?”
Steve let go of the beam weighing him down with the trucks holding the larger bits of debris and then he shrugged as he wiped his hands off. “He’s just…” he waved his hands around a bit as he searched for a word. “Stubborn.”
“Well someone’s a grinch this year. Only coal in your stocking this year.”
Tony eyed Steve warily, very obviously changing the subject. “I’ve got something to give to you, but I’ll have to explain how it works first.”
Bruce laughed softly. “I was here first, Tony.” He kicked out a chair for Tony to sit in. “Can’t sleep?”
“Spoken like a true artist, Steve.” Tony let his eyes bounce up to Steve’s for only a moment and he smiled. “I guess I can let this one go. Or wait until you’re not around to protect it and then take it down to my workshop for updates.”
Tony huffed impatiently. “Why the hell not?”
“Yeah I’m calling bullshit on that one.”
“What is there to work out? I don’t know what’s going on in the first place and Tony won’t tell me. He says he doesn’t know either.”
“I was in a hurry.”
“It was nice, Steve. I’m not mad about any of that…it just…I guess it just hit me how much they’re willing to lay on the line for me is all.”
Tony was silent this time, contemplating as to whether or not he wanted to say the next thing to Steve. He was sure Steve knew, but Tony’d never talked about it with anyone.
“Lift your shot glasses high as a token of our appreciation to the gods of punk as they rain down their awesomeness upon us so that we may kick some serious fucking ass tonight!”
Steve opened his mouth, ready to ask what was wrong, when he was interrupted by a perpetually amused voice. “A little birdy told me there were some Kevlar vests being tested out down here. That true?”
Two days later Tony texted him again.
“You just nothing, Steve. Look.” Bucky rested his arms on the table, leaning forward a little more and Steve knew he meant business now. “Do you realize how many double dates I have taken you on? Because it has been a lot. No matter who I introduced you to, you were never able to show any sign of interest. Okay so at first I thought you were still just bummed about Peggy, which is completely understandable, but then it wasn’t about that anymore. You just managed to make yourself feel awkward because you think you can’t talk to girls without sounding dumb. And that’s--well that’s kind of true, but you’re sort of a love at first sight guy and if you aren’t interested from the beginning then it won’t be happening later. Steve, I haven’t seen you smile like this over another person since before Peggy. You weren’t this mushy about her and you were head over heels in love with her. So I’m telling you this right now, as a friend. Stop holding yourself back and make sure you hold on to a good thing before you manage to lose it completely. You actually do deserve that.”
Steve took Tony’s hand and looked down at the burn. “I’m not trying to make you feel like you can’t take care of yourself, but you’re my friend. We’re friends right? And you are in danger. And I’m a genie and I can grant wishes and you haven’t really used me at all and so all I can do is watch helplessly because that’s about all I can do right now.”
Steve sighed. “Yeah. Shut up.”
“Whoa. Okay. Steve, calm down. They’re more worried I’m going to turn into the heartless playboy I used to be. Or that my insecurities will get the better of me. I’m Tony Stark. I don’t have any insecurities.”
“Steve Rogers.”
Steve crouched down when he caught the words flashing against the red screen. “Alert. Danger,” Steve looked up at the rest of his team, eyes wide.
Natasha slid into the room a moment later, footsteps soft as she idled up to his side. They shared a glance, a nod of silent understanding after he jerked his head towards the door. She made her way to the entrance, gun held at her side as her hand settled around the door handle. They were both ready to take out whoever it was in an instant.
Project Rebirth had given Steve everything he’d wanted and needed to be the man he set out to be. It increased his longevity and health, and he knew he’d probably have to watch all of them die off too.
“Don’t you fuckin’ dare, Stark.”
Bucky shrugged. “So? Isn’t that part of getting started? You have plenty of time to get to know him, so don’t let that hold you back.”
Tony smiled. This was not something he was accustomed to doing.
“Wipe that smirk off your face, Steve the Genie, or you’re going to miss the sunset.”
“Peter, go back to bed,” his father mumbled into the pillow.
know," Justin challenged.
“I told them I’d make sure you and Steve decided to go on a date before we left and they didn’t think I’d be able to so they made a bet with me.”
Tony sighed. “JARVIS, tell Steve to come to the bedroom in 15 minutes.”
“I wasn’t lying when I said I was ready, Tony.”
Bucky snatched the iPod this time, determined not to be left out of this conversation. “Anthony Stark? Sounds vaguely familiar. Is that what you’ve been listening to?”
“I won’t make any bets with your child. Tonight.”
Tony smiled.
Steve smiled. “Yeah. And thanks, Peggy.”
Steve realized now he’d been stupid for not trying to call Tony. Whatever they had fought about was honestly nothing that should stop them from being friends (or maybe more if he still wanted it) in the grand scheme of things. People fight. They fight over worse things but they work it out. He’d been silly to think Tony could just get bored with him and move on to something else. Tony put so much passion into everything he did and Steve had missed what was already obvious.
Steve’s head shot up and he couldn’t even stop the smile that formed on his face. “Iron Man. Hey.”
Tony grinned. “My life just went all ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ on me.”
It took Steve a moment, but he returned the kiss fervently, clinging to the genius, pulling their bodies flush against each other, one hand moving to cradle the side of Tony’s head as his tongue sought entrance into his mouth, which Tony quickly obliged. He was never one to deny Steve anything he ever wanted, this especially so.
Natasha elbowed Clint.
The soldier smiled nervously. How do you tell a small child that his parents are dead? He was going to ask for them sooner or later. “Is that so?”
He had gone from genie clothing to a blue and white plaid shirt and a pair of chinos that no one his age in this world even wore anymore.
The days with Tony in their care flew by in what was mostly, surprisingly, silence. Steve had very little doubt that the reasoning for Tony’s sudden case of lock lip was their small disagreement the week prior. That was fine. Great even. It gave Steve time to catch up on his regular business, business he’d let fall slightly to the side since Tony’s appearance at his door.
Days passed before Steve heard a coherent sentence.
A nervous laugh. Oops.
“Tony, I’m really…”
“Great. I’m stranded on Gilligan’s Island,” he muttered under his breath. “At least there’s a hammock.”
The grin on Steve’s face was challenge enough for Tony to lurch forward, his lips crashing into Steve’s, his hand reaching up to hold the soldier’s head in place. Steve immediately started kissing back and Tony almost forgot how to breathe. He pressed his lips harder to Steve’s and the soldier was holding Tony’s face in his hands.
Thank you for reading. Comments are appreciated!
Steve turned on his heel and started looking around, planning another route. Tony couldn’t have gotten too far. “Fantastic, “ he muttered, running a hand down his face.
Steve squeezed at Tony’s thigh, near his knee. “Whatever you say, kid.”
The drive to the warehouse seemed to take longer than Steve expected it to, even though Steve was breaking every speeding law that had ever existed in his rush to get there. As he drove, he gave out orders for when they arrived. “Barton, Romanoff, you’re on perimeter. Shoot to kill only; we’re not wasting bullets on wounding them, we’re going to need you to clear the entrance when we arrive. Odinson and Wilson, hang back and take out any cowards running away, watch all exits and keep them clear. Bruce, hang back and prepare medical, only act if first engaged. Bucky and I will search the insides; join us if everything is all clear.” Steve took the next corner sharply. “If you see Tony, make sure not to shoot him.”
“Seems like things might get nasty pretty fast then?”
Steve looked up to meet Tony’s eye and suddenly everything made a lot more sense. “This is...your doing,” he stated.
Steve opened his eyes with a groan, not missing the amused smirk of his best friend standing over him.
Steve elbowed Tony just a little under the blankets, grinning. “Our first official date will not be at McDonald’s, Tony.”
For a long time I was pissed off at you because I was a Stark, just not the one you were looking for.
“This is not on you, Stark. This isn’t—“
Pepper squared her shoulders, sitting up tall and sure. “James is right, we aren’t leaving you….besides, we’ve handled you for this long, anything else seems like a walk in the park in comparison.”
“Wonderful.” Thor bent over and lifted two beams, carefully turning to avoid knocking anyone over. “I do enjoy a bit of hard work now and again.”
"Someone like who...?"
She gave him a smile. “It’s okay for you to call me Pepper, Steve.”
Steve removed the popcorn from Tony and set it down out of reach on the coffee table before gently shaking the brunet until he jerked awake, hands swinging uselessly in no certain direction. Tony blinked a few times, eyes hooded and confused. “Whaaa?”
"I think you know the answer to that. You're a smart one."
“Don’t you like to have nice things?”
“Tony Tony Tony,” Obie started, throwing an arm around the brunet’s shoulder and pulling him to the couch. “You should have called anyway.”
Steve sighed, could almost feel the tension floating back into the room. He crouched down until he could gesture for Sergeant Major Nuts-N-Bolts to come near, hoping to maybe draw in some of the manic cheer the bot exuded. He kept his eyes firmly on the bot while speaking to Tony. “It’s not easy to lighten up in this line of business. Hell, it’s hard enough learning to trust people, hard enough to earn their trust, that by the end of the day ‘lightening up’ just becomes something you write a note to self about and never follow through with.” Steve winced to himself, his words depressing to even himself. He reached his hand out and ran his index finger softly along the bots metal exterior. He looked up at Tony from under his lashes, ready to change the subject as fast as possible. “Did you build this guy with one hand?”
Happy drove them to the new bookstore. When they walked in Tony’s nose was assaulted by the smell of coffee. It smelled great. Much to Peter’s chagrin, Tony made them stop by the bookstore coffee shop first before moving on. He might actually like this place already.
"Who hasn't? It's all over the school now. He shouldn't be here. Not someone like him."
The genius gave Steve a curious look. “Is there something happening right now that I’m not aware of?”
Everyone in the room was silent, all eyes on Tony. The genius spoke, fidgeting in his spot. “What? Don’t look at me, pretend I’m not here. Why are we looking at me?”
Steve smiled down at Tony, who was practically bouncing with excitement. “Show me!”
“Interesting. I mean how you know some things but not others. Sometimes it’s like you’re seeing the world for the first time and other times you’re almost jaded.”
“’s a good plan.”
“Uh...okay? What does that mean?”
Tony groaned “Spit it out, Cap.”
Bruce, who was just as surprised to see him, smiled pleasantly. He began inspecting Tony’s injuries despite his earlier protests. “Glad to see you’re not quite as dead as it appeared, Tony. I was starting to miss you trying to convince me to come work with you.”
“Because there’s nothing to talk about.”
Loki scooted over enough to let the blond take a seat next to him and used the opportunity to steal half the fries from Thor’s plate.
The genius gave Steve a small smile. No matter how many times Steve said it, Tony always froze when it was his turn to say it back. At first he had dismissed it as him not being ready to say it, but the harsh reality was the fact that he had no idea how to say it. This shouldn’t bother him, except that it does because Steve hasn’t questioned him. Steve hasn’t demanded to know why Tony won’t say it back. Steve hasn’t threatened to leave Tony, which Tony saw as more of a miracle. Whatever he could not put into words though, he always made up for in his actions. Well, at least he hoped so. Whether it was an extra safety precaution Tony added to Steve’s Captain America suit or the fevered kisses they shared at night when they were in bed together, in Tony’s mind, he was always hoping that Steve was getting the message.
Steve glared and lightly tapped the bot with his foot out of annoyance. He regretted it almost instantly as Nuts-N-Bolts let out a loud pitched siren noise, loud enough that Steve had to hold his ears with his hands to block out even just a little bit of the screeching.
Steve shut his eyes and let out a breath. “Well I wish you’d stop. Half the time I don’t know if this is just knee jerk for you or if you mean what you say and just cover it up with laughs.”
When he was done speaking he noticed that Tony had gotten a vest on him, busy snapping it in place as Steve’s words trickled into silence. Tony’s eyes flickered up to meet Steve’s as he tugged the vest into its proper place. “You miss her.”
The next time Steve finds Tony, he's playing again after the Howling Commandos had finish their selections for the Mash Up. Steve’d placed his school bag in that back room before his group began playing and he can’t really say he hadn’t done it in the hopes of running into Tony again. It seemed his plan had worked nicely. He leaned against the door frame and smiled as Tony’s fingers ever so slowly moved over the piano keys just as beautifully as they had last time.
Tony nodded. “Me too.”
Tony nearly choked. “I was not intimidated!”
Tony reached up and touched the bruises forming along Steve’s neck. “I’m fine. We’re alive.”  He looked at Steve from under his lashes. “You’re one of mine too, you know. That bridge goes both ways.”
Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him closer until their chests were touching. “I missed you too, Tony. Even if you are an idiot.”
“Thanks, Tony. It means a lot that you’re helping.”
“It’s your own fault,” Steve replied evenly.
“Iron Man gig? What’s that?”
“It’s rude to pick favorites.”
He stared at Steve for a moment longer before looking at Pepper once more. “I think Obie is involved. I obviously don’t have the proof and I hate that I’m having to think this way, but I think he’s involved. For all I know he was involved in the plane crash too. It’s just a little too convenient that my plane went down after I told Obie my intentions for the company. I have to lay low for awhile. I’m sure I won’t be able to go unnoticed for too long, but I need your help. I need you to find anything you can. Anything at all, Pepper. Look through company spendings, emails, anything you can get your hands on. I hate putting this on you, but you’re one of the few people I think I can fully trust.”
Steve was an anomaly. He’d gotten a terrible first impression of Tony and had managed to do a complete one eighty because now he made sure to tell Tony he loved him everyday. When everyone else was getting annoyed with Tony’s rants, his constant restlessness, even his ability to get lost in what he was doing, Steve was still smiling at him. And for some reason, Tony stopped hating himself so much for small periods of time. Sure, they had their fights because not fighting with Tony was more difficult than pulling a horse out of quicksand.
The room was silent, so silent that Steve could pick up everyone’s bated breathing as they waited for Tony to react. Tony’s hands balled into fists, his face unreadable. “Of course,” he muttered. He cleared his throat a little, stretched out his neck. “Three months in a torture facility. I was never sure but…” Tony fidgeted in his chair before standing up so fast that his chair screeched across the floor. “Anything else?”
Steve Rogers, despite his stunning inability to successfully tell a believable lie, was always very good at bottling up his emotions and playing it cool when tension was bubbling just under the surface. Ever since his initial encounter with the Winter Soldier, he’d been finding ways to distract himself and let out some pent up energy. His team had been a big help in different ways.
Steve sighed. “The moment the memories came back is the moment I turned human. Again. I don’t understand it. Everything came back at once though and I didn’t realize I had been shot right away.”
Steve slammed his body back around the corner and pressed the com to his ear. “Bucky. I need you to meet me. Coordinates coming your way. The rest of you move in as soon as possible. Stark is still in the wind, find him.”
Steve just smiled, burying his face in Tony’s hair. “Promise?”
The blond took a seat and lifted his guitar from its case. He strummed for a moment to make sure nothing was out of tune. With an air of finality and possibly a little bit of nervousness, Steve cleared his throat and dove right in to the song.
The next Sunday Peter woke up Tony the same way. And the Sunday after that. And then again the Sunday after that. Tony learned to just start going to bed earlier on Saturday nights. He had become a slave to his son’s demands, but he couldn’t say he minded all that much. Steve was nice. He was funny. He was a smartass, which Tony loved. They had talked a few times and it was nice having the adult interaction without the pressure of a wedding that wasn’t even his or people asking where the hell their promised designs from Tony were. He even took learning that Tony was Tony Stark, famous billionaire, former playboy, in great stride.
Steve’s phone started blaring out it’s alarm and all hell broke loose.
“Obie. Why didn’t you tell me you were coming? I could have ordered a pizza.”
“Men like Obie—their hearts are black as their hands are red. They think the value of their person is determined by the amount of money in their banks and are incapable of forming connections with anyone or anything. He wasn’t just incapable of loving you, Stark. He’s incapable of loving anything that wasn’t power.”
Tony nodded and took a cracker. “Yeah yeah.” He put them away and stood with the canteen, puzzling over how to actually get the snow without falling under an avalanche. He looked at Steve and raised his eyebrows, but pulled the door open and piled some snow into the canteen as quickly as he could and then shut the door.
“You love it.”
Tony nodded, eyes on the house  until it was completely out of sight. “Clint was in on this too?”
*****
If Steve was a little red at this point no one said anything about it. “If you say so. Well, make room so I can sit down. I’m starving.”
Happy SteveTonyFest!
“I’m not going to make a wish, Tony! What kind of game are you playing?”
Steve dropped into the seat and slouched. “I’m ready. Bring it on.”
“Oh. Well okay, I guess we have to...talk about it?”
Steve chuckled softly.
“Come sit with us! We’re about to open presents!”
Tony had teased Steve for the flowers the blond had given him when he’d come to pick up Tony. Tony loved them but he really needed to work on his gratitude skills because they were severely lacking sometimes. That and Tony had never been given flowers before so he wasn’t sure how this situation was supposed to be handled.
That caught Steve off guard. “That’s family time.”
“Is now really the time for being suggestive?”
Tony’s voice was quiet, steely. “Funny. I thought you’d been trying to sell me on how I was a part of your team. Is that not the case anymore?”
“Happy drove us,” Pepper said, touching Tony’s hand lightly. “The message said not to bring any guests so he had to leave, but he really wanted to stay. We’ve all really missed you, Tony.”
“Don’t let it go to your head. I’m not sure your ego can't really take much more inflation.”
Tony’s head shot up, his gaze almost comical at first until he glared. “What the fuck do you think I told them? I don’t know the secret password to your little ongoing party. I didn’t know who ‘The Captain’ was until they let it slip. It took them a week to realize I was telling the truth, a week of fucking torture.” His voice was watery. “By then they decided that if they couldn’t use me for what they got me for, then they could at least try and get me to make them new weapons. Something to use against you the next time you all went toe to toe.”
Steve opened his mouth to start talking because maybe that’s what Tony was waiting for but Tony reached out to silence him by placing a hand over his mouth. Steve scowled which earned him a smirk from Tony. Steve scowled more.
Tony scoffed, tone confused. “No, what would I be mad about?”
Tony nodded. “So if I tell you I’m ready for bed...will you stay with me?”
“So this is what it looks like to see the great Tony Stark care about someone other than himself. What would it look like to see Tony Stark lose someone he cares about then?”
“Cap, whats up?” He moved his hand up and down as if to encompass all that Steve was. “I’ve never seen you look like this, so…uncomfortable since…well ever. Are you okay?”
Steve made a noise of protest and moved his head away, using a finger to tilt Tony’s head up. “That’s not why.” He cleared his throat. “Okay that’s not the only reason why.”
Peter jumped up and down with a smile. “Yes! Tasha and Pepper totally owe me sundaes now.”
“A few HYDRA goons, no sign of Schmidt. We didn’t engage, stayed in the shadows when we could. As far as we can tell, no one noticed our presence. They had a skeleton crew out there, making repairs rather than abandoning their location. The ratio of unaware civilians to HYDRA henchmen was unclear though. It could be that they are all aware of who they are working for or that none of them are.” Bucky looked thoughtful. “Next time we visit we’ll need to tear it down so that former operations can’t be picked back up.”
Steve jumped, looking all around him in confusion. “What the hell is that?”
“I didn’t sa--” and his mouth fell open.
Tony huffed and took a rather pointed seat near Bruce. “Aye aye, Captain.”
Steve opened his eyes once more and took the Advil and bottle water Bucky was holding out for him. “Thanks,” he grunted.
“Never better,” Steve replied evenly.
Tony had been watching Steve this entire time too and he was sure that was impacting his feelings as well.
“And look where that landed your father.”
“I’m surprised it hasn’t been already,” Sam said lowly, grunting a moment later. “These guys are either very incompetent or this is some sort of trap.”
“Tony?”
Steve was crouched down, trying to pull apart two metal pieces that had somehow twisted themselves together. He couldn’t lift one without dragging the other and they were settled at an angle that was too awkward for him to be able to carry both.”
Steve shook his head. “No, why is it here?”
“Tony,” Steve was barely whispering. “I am so sorry! I had no idea! I just...do you want me to talk to him? Tell him what’s going on? Tell him all the good things you do? Anything?”
If there was one thing Tony Stark knew for a fact, it was that he did not know how to express his feelings.
“Yeah yeah.” He elbowed Bucky in the stomach. “I’ve gotta go grab something from the back room. I’ll be back up in a few minutes.”
Tony smiled easily. “Mum’s the word.”
“Hello, master!” the genie boomed with a smile.
Bucky lifted Steve’s shot glass and shoved it into his hand. “This is no time for sarcasm, Rogers. Drink up before you anger the gods and one of us ends up falling off stage and embarrassing the rest of us.”
Not anymore though. For as long as Tony decided to keep his distance and didn’t ‘accidentally’ blow up something, Steve would give him space to get over what really equated to a temper tantrum because he hadn’t gotten his way. And he wouldn’t get his way, no matter how many quiet glares he received or how many rooms suddenly emptied upon his entrance, or how many conversations stopped dead the second Tony laid eyes on him. Steve’s will was stronger than Tony’s petulance, he was sure of it even if the longer it went on the more annoyed Steve got.
“Yeah sure,” Steve murmured. “I guess. I don’t know. Maybe not. It might just end up causing problems.”
“It’s because I’d want you there with me. I’d take care of all expenses if you could come along and don’t argue with me because it would not stop me from doing it anyway.”
No. Tony was pretty sure he wasn’t going to die, but as he’d thought before, only an act of gods or terrorism from less than friendly aliens would take him down. That was how he was supposed to go out, but the problem with that was the fact that Tony Stark, without the suit, was only human and yes, he was good with martial arts and making weapons to defend himself out of scraps, he wasn’t necessarily prepared to be blindsided.
Steve stopped. “Okay?”
Steve nodded and stared down at his hands. He rubbed the pad of his thumb between his eyebrows. “Barton and Romanoff are going undercover, scoping out any leads in relation to Stark Industries and Stane’s whereabouts. We’ll need to know as much as we can when it comes time to take him out. Bucky, Sam and Thor are going to be keeping a closer eye on HYDRA and pay a visit to the warehouse Tony was kept in, see if they can scavenge anything of import. In the mean time, we need to get a hold of some supplies for Stark to work with, have him make a list of what he needs and give him a space in your lab. I’ll check in in about a week. That should be more than enough time for Stark to at least have some sort of blueprints ready to show off. I’m going to need you to stay on him to make sure he’s doing what he’s supposed to be doing. I don’t need any chunk of my home blown up in an effort to escape.”
“And you’re okay with that?” Tony asked, a challenge in his voice as he made his way to stand in front of Steve again.
“I’m not discussing this right now.”
“You’re not Pepper.”
“You any good?”
“Who do you think stepped up to the plate and helped me out when my parents died? Who do you think mentored me and helped me settle into my new role as CEO? Who do you think was the only family I had left? I looked up to him. I trusted him. He gave me years of his life, which I can only hopefully assume was an act of kindness on his part, but I know it’s enough for me to have problems with killing the man.” He looked at Bruce. “I’m already responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, maybe millions, just because of the weapons I’ve made. Bruce, my weapons have been getting sold under the table to terrorist organizations, dictators, Russia...and people are dying. Innocent people are dying because my weapons are so goddamn fucking effective. I thought I was protecting the good guys, but who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? Who am I to decide that?”
Steve grinned and shrugged. “Who else are we going to take him to?”
Tony paused and looked down at the floor. And there it was. For all his genius, his passion, his smiles and his arrogant demeanor, Tony was hiding his fears and insecurities.
Tony gripped both Pepper’s shoulders. “I’ve got this. You’re brilliant, Miss Potts, truly magnificent, and one of the only people I would trust with a job like this. I need you to do this for me.”
Tony all but thrust the shirt into his outstretched hand, expression gleeful and triumphant. Steve took his time inspecting the fabric for himself before peeling off the shirt he was wearing and replacing it with the one Tony had apparently fabricated. Steve ran his hand down the material on his chest, rolling his shoulders back and forward. “This fits nicely. Comfortable, doesn’t seem to hinder any movements.” Steve fingered the fabric at his waist. “It feels good.”
“Were you not told to lay low for a few days?”
“Then don’t. Both are equally important to you.”
When the first movie ended, Steve began another though Tony ended up finishing his work about half way through. He lifted his goggles from his eyes and blinked a few times, gaze on the far wall before shaking his head and focusing on the two men sat before him. “Good as new. Well, new is a relative term. It shouldn’t have any more problems for awhile, but since it’s still basically a prototype, though a Stark prototype is basically a finished product years ahead of the game, I can’t say it won’t have problems in the future. We should do random tune ups from now on, to make sure everything stays in tip top shape.”
