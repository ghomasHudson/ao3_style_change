”Just love me.”
Despite his grousing, the alpha wasn’t in the worst mood tonight, and Steve chuckled at his silly – yet surprisingly sharp considering the medication – jokes as he took care of the wound. He was just so grateful to have Tony home again.
Steve did. He really did, and he whined in confirmation, his legs trembling from the stretch of Tony leaning against them. Pleased, Tony finally lifted his hand. Drawing a hungry breath, Steve reached for the hand before Tony could pull it too far away and sucked three of the fingers into his mouth.
Tony smiled, rolling the tip of his finger slowly inside, making Steve want to clench, to suck the finger deeper. He leaned against Tony’s shoulder, submitting to whatever Tony would give him.
Steve finishes changing him and glances out the window, not expecting to see anything of interest.
”Oh my fucking GOD”, Tony shouts, slamming both of his fists against the countertop. Steve looks at him impassively.
”Fuck – that’s mine, you’re mine”, he slurred, hardly seeing from the intensity of the pleasure building inside of him. Even Steve’s noises were becoming distant, his scent more vivid in Tony’s head than anything else. He did sense it when Steve’s hand suddenly found his, pulling it from his waist and lacing their fingers.
Steve jolts awake in the darkness. He’s naked, buried under the covers, and his skin is sticking to Tony’s, who’s pressed against him and just as naked as him. Hazily, Steve remembers falling asleep waiting for the knot to come down. It’s certainly gone now, leaving Steve uncomfortably wet between his legs as the fluids have begun to flow out of him in his sleep.
Although he’s already been pretty much there just taking it, resigning himself into not much else than a hole for Tony to fuck into, Steve still finds a drop of strength to let go of in his body as Tony grabs him by the waist and lowers both of their weights to the floor. Tony’s hips still twitch infrequently as he presses his forehead against Steve’s back, breathing raggedly.
Tony brushed his cheek against Steve’s head. ”That you would, sweet cheeks. But I’ll see what I can do.”
”I have to talk to you about something”, he starts. His voice is grave but not too worrying, and Tony just gives him a distracted hum as a cue to go on.
And Steve came, the word ”daddy” leaving his lips like religion, his cock pulsing in Tony’s hand,  spilling onto his fingers.
Tony’s sitting on the bed, scrolling his tablet, which he puts away at the sight of his provocatively dressed lover.
Steve shakes his head, the tears dropping to his lap and forming dark spots on the fabric of his suit. It takes a while before he’s able to continue.
The alpha stared at him for a bit before a smile came to hover on his lips.
Steve huffs.
”I love you.”
It went on for a while, until Tony finally pulled his finger out. Steve expected to be filled again with more, but Tony rolled the chair right to the desk and pushed Steve on top of it swiftly. Steve let out a surprised sound, falling onto his back, his eyes drinking in the sight of Tony standing in front of him, still fully clothed and in charge.
that you’re a genius.”
absurd.”
”Steve, honey, obviously I like it, my being an ass to you for the last week has nothing to do with that”, Tony assured him, reaching to push a strand from Steve’s face. ”We can talk about it better tonight, when I’m done here, okay?”
Can he? He knows he can’t, but the thought refuses to leave him, and usually when a thought persists like this, it means that Tony’s overlooked something. That there’s something he hasn’t considered, something critical that he’s missing. But this time, his rationale tells him, it’s just the grief refusing to let go.
The omega purred into his ear keenly as Tony caressed him, and gradually, Tony could feel strength returning to his limbs after sleep and blood beginning to flow towards his crotch as his body remembered its programming.
”I don’t know but I’m your alpha and I should’ve been there.” Tony sounds frustrated. ”I should’ve been there for Kieran too”, he adds quietly.
Bucky doesn’t catch the small wordless exchange between them.
Tony manages to keep himself in check, but when Steve stops with just the tip past his rim, he stops to pant like he’s in pain and gives Steve a desperate look. Steve swings his hips backwards a tiny bit more just to slip Tony’s cock almost out of him again. He notices Tony’s muscles straining from the way he’s struggling to keep still, a hint of sweat on his forehead.
”You can call me Steve”, Steve tells him before turning back to Tony. ”This shouldn’t take long. Do that thing you did the other day to him,” he says, referring to the way Tony had managed to soothe Kieran a couple of days ago by basically telling him a story in a ridiculously low voice. Tony raises his eyebrows and Steve gestures at him dismissively. ”Just try to calm him down. I’ll fetch him in a minute.”
”Fine”, Steve hears himself say. He’s almost proud; it’s probably the most sensible thing he’s said for weeks. Not very alluring, but he feels Tony’s hand land on his collarbones nevertheless.
”I’m sure it comes as a surprise”, he begun in a light note. ”But I don’t love you for your money. At the end of the day, I don’t even love you for the
”Yes, you have”, Tony says, and though it’s not a nice thing to hear, Steve is grateful that he doesn’t try to play it down. He’s also grateful when Tony wraps his arms around him tightly.
Tony’s pliantness did everything to light Steve up, and he bit Tony’s earlobe, getting a shaky moan from him in response. He wanted to hear more, and after he really set out to get noise out of the alpha, it didn’t take long for him to get Tony groaning continuously.
”What? No.” He almost laughs. ”I’m bonded.”
Steve huffed through his nose at him, but moved to spoon him, closing a hand over his.
The heat does not return. For a day Steve still sees blood every time he goes to the bathroom, but he’s recovering, his blood levels getting back to regular. A few days after the curse Steve can almost say that he’s feeling back to normal, whatever that is nowadays.
”I examined you while you were out”, he tells. ”You were bleeding heavily. Steve, I doubt you would’ve survived without the serum.”
by god don't let this soft prologue fool you. it's going to be pure pain.
Steve holds Emmett for a while longer, reassuring him, or perhaps himself, that he’s going to see him again soon. He gives Nat and Rhodey instructions and they listen dutifully, but Steve still feels awful when the doctor arrives and it’s time to give Emmett back to them.
leave you. I will come to you even if I have to travel across galaxies, through goddamn time if I need to. Just promise me you stop keeping things to yourself. I don’t want to have the strong half of you with the other half broken and hidden inside. I want all of you, the whole mess.”
”You’ll
”The Lord himself”, Clint had commented on his late arrival, not bothering to lift his eyes from his taco. There had been a little sway in Tony’s step, and Steve had wondered briefly if the others were able to notice it too.
Tony hummed brokenly, breathing tensely through his nose, the sudden fullness inside of him definitely more pain than pleasure at the moment. Steve gave him a look that said “how many times do we have to go through this”, but leaned down to kiss his shoulder apologetically, and didn’t move his hips. He lowered himself even closer, kissing Tony’s cheek, his neck, his throat softly. It took Tony’s mind off the displeasure effectively, his muscles beginning to relax. One of Steve’s hands was rubbing small circles onto his hip, and the expression on Tony’s face softened, and oh –
”You’re so good to me”, he whispered, suddenly overcome with emotion. Tony squeezed him tighter.
”Stay still”, Tony instructs him, slapping his ass. ”Be good now.”
“Y-yes”, Steve managed, and then Tony was sliding into him and he was wailing, clawing the desk underneath him.
”I am selfish”, he mutters. ”I don’t wanna lose you.”
Steve glances at him.
Steve can’t think about the twins – it hurts too much. They deserve so much better than him. He looks at Tony, his eyes turning cold.
Steve has no desire to risk anything like that happening. He has already lost Kieran. Still, the thought of not being able to be with his only remaining child for days and care for him makes him anxious.
“Do you have any idea how hard you’re making me?” His lower half slides against Steve in demonstration, and Steve lets out a muffled sound around the gag at the sensation of Tony’s cock pushing against his own. Tony grins wildly at him and takes his shirt off, then mouths Steve’s ear, continuing to grind against him slowly.
he throws the glass to the wall and it shatters, the fine crystal raining all over the floor. He turns and pulls the dresser to the floor, roaring in rage, kicks it, stamps it, because he’s the one who’s hurt –
”She – or he – would’ve smelled wrong to you. It would have affected our bond.”
A tight gasp escapes Tony as Steve’s hand cups his balls under the water, beginning to fondle them. He looks at Steve but the omega’s eyes stay closed, his face relaxed, and so Tony tries to concentrate on his task of foaming the shampoo. It makes him smile, the way Steve’s wet, long eyelashes stick to his skin, the way the soft light highlights his cheek bones. He looks safe, and it’s all Tony’s ever wanted, all he can ask for now. For Steve and Emmett to be safe.
Dum-E had left the coffee alone.
”What –” Tony pauses as he almost loses his balance. ”What time is it?”
The way he could make Steve beg mindlessly for his knot.
”I think we should consider breaking the bond.”
“Good”, he says matter-of-factly, clearly enjoying himself. But Steve knows that to Tony his own pleasure is always secondary, that what truly gets him off is the knowledge that he is making Steve feel good.
Steve stares at him. He’s not offended, but it just isn’t a day for laughter. ”It’s funny enough”, he says colourlessly. ”I’m fine with sleeping in your quarters.”
a big, empty bottle of liquor on the floor, accompanied by another that’s also almost halfway done. He doesn’t even remember opening the second one.
”Does it feel good, sweetheart?” Tony prompts him. The answer is quite clear on Steve’s face and Tony’s obviously just seeking to hear it.
”Yes, honey, I’m so close”, he moans, his chest heaving as blood breaks out into Steve’s mouth. Tony lets out a broken sound, and Steve is hit by the taste, a part of him wondering if it might be too far. But another part of him can only think like an animal, about Tony helpless under him as he rides his cock mercilessly.
Steve’s first instinct is to aggressively shake his head, but he doesn’t. He could if he really wanted to, but he prefers to not really have his own will exist in this world. Only Tony’s, and Tony can take pictures of him gagged and tied, wearing lingerie and a skirt, if he likes. In fact, Steve’s not entirely sure if he has allowed that or not, but he knows that Tony knows.
The situation seems to get through to Tony.
Steve blinked, looking up at Tony with devoted eyes. He leaned closer and sucked his balls into his mouth gently, felt them tighten against his tongue. Tony pet his hair, pumping himself.
the dresser is splintering and Tony searches blindly for something else to destroy, finds the door and punches it, makes a dent on it, punches it again, why can’t he forgive, uses his legs, someone’s shouting his name –
”I can bring you breakfast here if you’re not up for coming downstairs”, he tells Steve as he gets up and starts looking for clothes, noticing how his omega snuggles under the covers to keep warm without him.
”Days”, Tony continues, stroking Steve agonizingly slowly, ”of me inside of you. Knotting you.”
”Tony”, Steve begs, and Tony can’t hold off any longer. He sinks his teeth into Steve’s neck, making Steve wail.
”, he whispers, pushing his finger inside gently.
The next morning, Steve wakes up to Tony staring at him. He’s already fully clothed and looks like he’s been waiting for a while.
”Are you gonna blame me, or yourself?” Steve really doesn’t have the energy for this. He understands, he does, because he blames himself too. But this is not the way to deal with their loss.
Tony is on that spaceship. Alive.
It is the beginning of a string of findings that, no more than 29 hours later, ends up in Tony staring at his model in disbelief.
The empty feeling nowadays so familiar to him envelops Steve. It’s not really Tony he’s angry at, but himself.
He couldn’t pick up any sort of aftershave, not even anything as pedestrian as Old Spice or--thank all the stars--Axe. Just the fresh scent of...lemongrass? No, aloe vera, and the barest hint of spearmint behind it. Nothing overwhelming, just cool and clean, and somehow perfect for Steve. It was a very good blend for him, Tony mused, and pressed a soft kiss against the racing pulse in Steve’s neck, the tip of his tongue dipping out to teasingly lick, and was rewarded with Steve shuddering hard against him, those deliciously large hands convulsively locking onto his hips and pulling him even closer.
“ What is this, Tony?” Steve can’t fathom what is going on in Tony’s head, and he hates it. “Tell me you realize how backwards this is?”
He’d take another day to wonder what Tony was up to, though. Today? Today he just wanted to curl up in a ball and not

collaring’s effect on him and exploited it for all it was worth, and Pepper had always made it up to him because she was a fucking angel, but Steve...
“Nothing good, I take it.” Tony muttered glumly. Five minutes. Less than that, really. How had everything whiplashed so badly on him? And what had Steve
Steve kind of wanted to fuck him.
, he could feel it building now, each of Steve’s wild and forceful thrusts spiraling him higher and higher towards an ecstatic peak and then Steve snapped up into him at the same time as one of his fingers pressed into his perineum, massaging it and Tony whited-out, not registering the sensation of Steve’s teeth clamping down on his shoulder in order to muffle his own cries, or the wary Steve’s pounding rhythm stuttered then broke as he thrust into him once, twice, then stilled, his release pulsing into Tony in hot waves. Tony screamed silently into Steve’s hand as he came, voice locked, pushed past its limit, utterly lost in the throes of a shattering orgasm.
“Shut up, Tony.”
But what? He’d been out of the ice for almost eight months. He had a job, and a home, and even friendship.
The officer studied his license for a long moment, then pinned him with a disgusted glare. “Mr. Stark, what is
Tony’s always so guarded, so careful and strong during the day. He’s got his masks up so he can drag the future into the here and now. He’s running his company, trying to run the Avengers, the city, and the whole rest of the world if he can get away with it, but it’s the quieter moments Steve wants to continue to bask in, the moments when Tony’s still.
“I think I did a pretty good job of it.”
Tony loves him.
“Here, let me help you out, Steve.” Stark turned around and braced himself against the side of his car, posing to show off his admittedly nice rear as he spread his legs. It was indecent, and the man was a menace.
“I’ll come round at a better hour with Wong. In the meantime, goodnight and congratulations.”

and in the process destroyed her final rest. The
He should have stayed awake, he should have kept Steve with him, he should’ve--no.

For his part, Steve looks disgusted, and Tony isn’t sure if it’s because he’s crafted the anathema, or because he can’t seem to muster up the last shred of resolve he needs to

Steve grinned. “Every single shred.”
It’s a long moment before Tony is ready—who
Steve shrugged morosely. “Orthiel would just ensnare a host and batter them mentally until they succumbed and then he consumed them utterly, till it was just him in a human shell. And then he killed. He killed indiscriminately, but he didn’t torture or rape or steal. He appeared and people died, as if he was working his way through some sort of infernal hit list. It was bad enough on his own, but Hydra...Hydra found Orthiel’s coin, Tony. It was looted from the synagogue where it had been hidden, and Hydra gave it to the Winter Soldier.”
so close, trembling at the edge of something glorious. Tony reached down, stroked hair back from his damp forehead--he was so hot, flushed hot and sweaty and
“And yet, here I am. What does that tell you?” Maria tucks her finger under Tony’s chin, turning his head this way and that as she studies him with a proprietary gaze.
“I’m just saying.”
“Steve, that’s wedding materi--wait--
“I could take it slower for you, Officer Grant.”
This whole damn situation is surreal.
“I’m going to get back to it now, but I’m onto you Tony, so don’t think we’re not due up for a Chat later on.”
This is love, the stuff of legends and fairytales, the kind of love that inspires heroes and enduring works of art. Steve suddenly reverting to his pre-serum self shouldn’t be any sort of deterrent. What is going on?
It had taken him a while to remove the mental hurdle of “Howard’s Son”, but once he had, he’d been perpetually in awe of Tony Stark. He’d thought he’d seen genius in his own time, but Tony burned with it, and the contradicting bits and pieces of his personality made him a fascinating enigma that Steve wasn’t quite sure what to do with.
Tony’s fury was a cold one, each word clipped and clear and ripping into him like razor blades. Most people thought Tony’s temper ran hot, but that was a carefully constructed mask Steve had learned, part and parcel of the Tony Stark package he’d been shoveling down the world’s throat for years. Furthermore, Tony had the armor, and when explosions or repulsor blasts followed your bouts of anger, people assumed a hot temper.
What was Tony to say? He was knee-deep in his second Ph.D. and still learning how to manage a division at the time. He wasn’t CEO. Hell, he wasn’t even Vice President of the Research Division, and he’d been camped out there since 1988. Suddenly his parents were gone, he was floundering, and he had this massive company to run years earlier than intended. It was all just...too much. He’d done what he’d always done when he was between a rock and a hard place—let Obie handle it.
“On your left.”
“What the hell, is this a third elbow??” Tony reared back slightly. He’d realized that Steve was big, but he’d apparently failed to give enough thought to just what that massive ridge in Steve’s pants was all about. Fuck. Steve was definitely the largest Tony had ever encountered. Easily.
Obie had insisted on it because it was just one more way to keep Tony in line and under his thumb, and he had voluntarily worn one for Pepper, as a way of smoothing the way for her whenever his presence was required at Stark Industries. She had enough to deal with by just being a woman in a male-dominated field, CEO or no.
Steve’s tongue traced the inner whorl of his ear and chucked at Tony’s soft gasp. “Oh, I would, Stark, I would, I really want to fuck you right through the hood of this insanely expensive mid-life crisis and to the ground, but I would break you in half if I tried it right now. We don’t have the time or space or near enough lube for me to get you ready, so this is
Poor guy. He looks really excited about the whole early morning combat thing, but nope. No demons or ghouls here. Just Clint, and a goat, and the last shreds of Tony's mental fortitude.
Steve tried to gauge a new angle, but Natasha shifted with his line of sight, obviously intent on screwing up his throw.
the soft tugging and light pressure sending sparks of desire through his body and straight to his cock, which bobbed eagerly under Tony’s hands. There was no way Tony could have missed that, plastered against his front as he was, and sure enough, Tony’s hands stilled and a curious noise escaped his throat.
No, that was the second mistake. The
Hey. Hello there, long-forgotten authority kink. How’s tricks these days?
Steve let his eyes drift close as Tony found his rhythm, bucking his hips up to meet the rocking grind and tight slide as Tony got both hands involved in toying with his nipples. Steve had never known they could be so deliciously sensitive--when Tony brushed his fingers across the straining nubs, pleasure, sharp and brilliant, shot down his spine. When Tony rolled them between his fingers, lightly squeezing and pulling at them, the pleasure turned slow and liquid, pooling through his lower body.
“This is why you’re not getting sucked, you know.”
He needs his anvil.
Steve had abandoned the teasing caresses in order to clamp his hand directly over Tony’s mouth and muffle the sharp cries and moans that had been pouring forth as that other wicked hand stroked him through every blissful moment until he was left over-sensitized and half-dazed.
Steve jerked away from Tony when he pressed another finger in, the sensation too much too fast, and rocked his hips this way and that to assist with the stretching as Tony murmured an apology and went back down to two fingers. It took a few more false starts, but Tony finally got a third finger in and Steve gripped the ridges of the Saleen’s hood as he worked through the discomfort, hoping he didn’t do any lasting damage to the car.
and the knowledge stewed in his guts and that sick and sour feeling would not go away.
Tony knows he should be concerned that he can’t decide which order that’s going in, but he’s more fixated on the fact that Steve is lowering his head to Tony’s waist, letting his tongue trace up the ridge of his abdomen to dip into the muscles of his six-pack.
“Oh come on. No one’s telling you to start making wedding plans or anything. It’s just one date. Have yourself a good time, get a nice dinner out of it, maybe get laid. I guarantee he’ll put out if you’re into that sort of thing.”
He can’t bring himself to believe there’ll be no complications. It’s magic. Something weird always happens.
And eating his fucking coach.
What the fuck?
Being fair, he’s not so much
Steve’s fingers trail over his hair, brush down his cheek, and then curled lightly around his throat, his voice gentle and poisonous as he takes advantage of the tangle of tension and fixation and emotion between them and uses it to far more debilitating effect than even the anathema could be capable of.
This was the part Steve normally dreaded--when pleasure turned to ache because he couldn’t handle the abrasive feeling of too rough hands on his most sensitive parts. So many times they’d ended up together, seeking a mutual release, and it so rarely worked for him. Oh, it was easy enough to get him started, get him riled up and ready to go off, but then he got stuck on this horrid plateau of sensation that was too much, but too good to ignore, and he got hung up in the interplay between it all. His head got muddled, the pleasure turned sour, and his climax drifted further and further away.
“Ty was fine Steve. We bumped into each other when I took my partners out to dinner. We just caught up. Nothing to get worked up about.”
Steve wound a hand into Tony’s hair and
“Fuck me, you’re a menace!” Tony gasped out, his impassioned voice just shy of too-loud in the hush of the alleyway.
“Oh, you know how it is, end of the quarter madness. How’s the family?”
It felt a little like drowning and a lot like flying, and he
“Say it again.”
In the end, the board hadn’t wanted to pursue expansion into an active subsidiary; why compete with the likes of Medtronic, Boston Scientific, or Brainlab when they had all but cornered their share of the advanced tech and defense markets? It might have been a good move back when Howard was still living, but Howard had focused more on intellicrops than pharmaceuticals, and at its heart, Stark Industries was a weapons company. They dealt in tech
That dirty, rotten...Steve flipped Tony over so that he was pinned beneath him, earning him a whimper as he rocked his erection against Tony’s sorely abused hole. He was going to have to be a bit gentler this time. “Send Clint a message please, JARVIS. Brooklyn takes Yankee, 4-2.”
Tony forgets himself, repulsed by the visceral reminder that Steve isn’t human, isn’t
Tony hadn’t been expecting it at all, and had shot off like a rocket, going up in a brilliant flare of light and heat and intense sensation that had sizzled along seemingly every nerve in his body and then rushed outward in hot, powerful spurts that seemed to go on and on.
“What the--” Tony starts to lift his hand away, but Steve latches on to his arm with startling speed.
“Man, I said ‘on your left’ for a reason, Cap. There’s nothing but hell waiting for you on the right. Good luck with that, I guess. I’ll be right back. Promised Natasha I’d give her a call.” Sam dropped what was probably meant to be a comforting pat on his hand as he stood up and nodded at the room’s other occupant before beating a hasty retreat.
Tony met him thrust for thrust, automatically curving his arms over his shoulders as Steve continued to move inside of him and grew almost impossibly harder, and it was too much and not enough and Tony quivered and writhed beneath him, completely at his mercy.
Natasha jabbed a finger at him. “That’s an agreement. I’m taking that as tacit permission to get you a life.”
Steve glances up at Tony to offer up a bit of comfort because, well, Tony looks like he really needs it, but when he opens his mouth to speak all that comes out is a startlingly loud bleat.
“Password.”
What was it Dugan had said? You can’t go home again?
[[Hey! I--]]
Tony was going to speak again, but broke off in a happy grunt as Steve manhandled him into a more comfortable position so that he could get at the plug again. Steve tossed the wide plug aside while Tony rooted around underneath the pillows until he produced a black and gold bottle of lube--waterproof and extra-slick because

He can’t look away.
“I’ve got you, Steve.” Tony helps him up, marveling at how light Steve is. Gone are the muscles and bulky proportions. Steve’s still the same height, but his features look more delicate and he’s slender now. Not painfully skinny, exactly, but there’s a whipcord quality to his physique, and his long arms and broad shoulders reveal hidden definition as he moves. This Steve is definitely built for agility over strength, and Tony realises with a start that this is what Steve looks like in good health without the serum. Built like a figure skater but probably still willing to try and rip a tank apart with his bare hands.
lost her temper by the time the Steve got hold of the amulet, and she’d screeched and called him a ‘stubborn old goat’ before throwing a golden bolt of magic at him when he refused to give it up. Amora missed him, however, and hit the amulet instead, and there had been an awful cracking sound and then the amulet had begun to hiss and throb with mystical energy and Tony had shouted Steve’s name and there was the familiar whine of rapidly approaching repulsors, and then a flare of energy, and…
Tony’s hand twitches in his, and Steve grasps it tighter. Tony might not be ready to run off and leave him as a goat to stave off the discussion that Steve has just decided they’re having, but why take any chances?

But Natasha, Clint, and Steve? They’re vulnerable.
Steve waited exactly a month and a half out of respect, both to Pepper’s request and Tony’s own heartache, but oh, he had plans. He’d learned his lessons about waiting too long and not seizing what opportunities he could as they arose, and he wasn’t going to be making the same mistake twice. Tony was fair game, as far as he was concerned. Tony, however...Tony didn’t go for it. Oh, Tony was interested--he flirted back and had made his own flying passes at Steve, but Steve was couldn’t even get to first base with the man. Hell, he couldn’t even get the game going at all. Steve cajoled and plotted and even outright propositioned Tony once, but all he got was wry grins, meaningless flirtations, and clever run-arounds.
“You would’ve done it already,” Steve assures him, knocks the anathema aside, and Tony watches it skitter across the floor harmlessly. He hears a faint noise like a woman screaming but can’t pay it any mind, too focused on Steve. Steve always has had a way of commanding his attention like little else.

Steve glares at Tony, feeling his gaze go hard and stubborn. “I can be tactician if nothing else, Tony. At the very least, take me with you--I don’t have to be on the ground to be of use.”
Tony was methodical about it too--he let Steve watch, sometimes, let Steve direct him, but left to his own devices, Tony had a pattern. He always started at the head of his dick, always used the flat of his thumb to slowly circle it, dragging precome across the slit and then down and around in longer and longer winding strokes, always went top to bottom, in a spiral until he was twisting his hand down and around until he reached the base, squeezing once, and then sliding his hand back up to the tip and repeating it all again.

They just might resort to the Guard anyway, because, instead of scrambling, Tony has blocked the exit and is staunch in his refusal to let Steve off the jet. It’s familiar, arguing with Tony like this--they bicker a lot in these situations--but they’ve never gone round while holding hands. It’s almost ridiculous. The only thing more ridiculous than arguing while holding hands would be Tony trying to tell him he’s the weakest link and needs to sit things out, but oh, wait,
Bucky sits to the edge of Steve’s bed and lets him gather himself.
When Tony lifts his face, he looks thoughtful. ”Huh. Well, that was interesting.”
”Is this one of those ’my poor, little alpha’ hugs”, Tony asked, the slight slurring in his speech taking the edge off of his attempt to sound irritated. He had taken another painkiller for the night and it seemed like it was kicking in.
Tony watches him with an expectant expression, his shirt still on and his hard cock looking desperate. Steve gives him a sly smile as he climbs on top of him, bringing his lips to Tony’s for a hungry kiss. He doesn’t let it go on for long, even though Tony tries to keep pushing his tongue into his mouth – he nudges Tony’s face to the side, attacking his earlobe gently with his teeth, and feels Tony’s cock jump against his own. He hums out a laugh, loosening Tony’s tie and starting to button his shirt open as his mouth torments his ear.
Despite the lewd talk, Tony doesn’t even consider teasing Steve. They’ve both missed each other too much and it’s not the occasion with how unsure things are. So Tony just lubes himself up generously and starts pushing in carefully, monitoring Steve’s expression for any signs of pain.
With a growl, he quickens his pace, making Steve moan loudly. Mine, Tony’s mind provides, and there’s an instant response, a sense of full submission through the bond from Steve. It takes hold of Tony’s entire core, and he can feel how it’s demanding his knot to pop. With the way Steve’s whining and clenching around him, this isn’t going to last long.
”Jesus Christ”, Tony mutters, his voice hardly audible. ”Fuck.”
Steve continues to hush their poor, confused baby, while absently thinking that Tony’s being out of character. Tony has never been exactly a patient person, and he could fall into being irrational sometimes, but never like this. Even at his worst moments, he has a reason for his behaviour, at least in his own head. He knows his rationale for the things he does and says – unlike Steve himself has at times. But Steve very much doubts Tony has any reason for his behaviour now besides not knowing how else to act.
”Try to sleep, honey”, Steve mumbles sleepily, his thumb rubbing Tony’s shoulder lightly. Tony knows Steve’s only half awake, and just as he expects, the finger stops moving against his skin soon, Steve’s breathing turning heavier again.
”Mine”, Tony repeated, a groan following. ”Mine, fuck, Steve – my gorgeous omega”, he went on almost desperately, watching how Steve panted hard. ”You’ll be so beautiful.”
”Then shouldn’t we wait? I’m just glad that I can be with you, Steve. The details don’t matter.”
”Good”, Tony praises him again, pleased. ”Turn around.”
The doctor sighs. ”Well, no one can force you. But I have to emphasize that that would be a very dangerous decision. Omegas have died of mourning heats, and that’s why they are usually suppressed medically if possible. Since that unfortunately isn’t an option for you because of the serum, all I can do is to give you my best advice on how to get through this as safely as you can.”
”Please”, Steve begs. ”Please don’t go, Tony.”
He’s surprised when Steve sits up and looks at him.
Tony settled onto his side, and for a start Steve just spooned him. He kissed Tony’s nape and brought his hand down to caress his stomach.
Tony shakes his head lightly, his lips curving.
. Tony wouldn’t, right? He is a saint, after all. Still, Steve has no intention to risk it, so he closes his eyes and thinks of nothing, of anything, until Tony’s voice calls him back to reality.
Steve gives him a defeated look, then complies, leaning his back against Tony again. Tony pulls him even closer so that the back of Steve’s head comes to rest against Tony’s shoulder. Steve’s eyes flick up to meet his, and Tony kisses his forehead.
Well, his permission wasn’t really asked for. Steve never does. But if the all-mighty Captain-lady and Thor hadn’t left too, Tony would have been on that ship to go with Steve or died trying.
”Kiss me, big boy.”
Tony’s hips pushed slightly back against him and Steve sighed at the contact.
Tony wraps his arms around him and presses his lips against Steve’s cheek.
”Relax, I’m joking”, Tony stops him, chuckling. ”No, you’re not, mon petit chou.”
Steve tries to lift his weight to his hands but fails. Shivering, he realises that his skin feels cold. Something is definitely wrong.
”Sweetheart”, he says, his fingers finding their way up to Steve’s throat, sliding along its sensitive skin softly. ”It’s lovely.”
”I’m sorry”, Steve whispers. He really is. Tony’s been nothing but patient and loving towards him through all of this, and Steve has rewarded him by taking his misery out on him for weeks. He’s been so blind, so irresponsible.
”You don’t know how much –” Tony begins after they part.
Tony leaves and Steve keeps concentrating on his breathing, fighting to steady it. He wipes his face with his hand, his shoulders still shaking. He’s come back to his senses enough that he can hear everything happening in the kitchen, the fridge being opened and the microwave starting. Tony is chatting softly to Kieran to calm him, and it calms Steve too, through his bond with Kieran but also just listening to Tony’s voice.
Protect. Take care of.
”I love you”, he says droopily, looking up into Tony’s eyes.
”You washed it. Just didn’t rinse it, but it’s rinsed now”, he corrects gently. Tony hugs him, feeling tired.
Tony leans down, reaching around his hips for his belt, and Steve assists him, both of their hands working hastily on it. As soon as they get it open, Tony pulls the trousers down along with the boxers underneath and works all of it completely off as fast as possible. Steve breathes thinly, not daring to look behind him. He just lies still, bare and ready for the taking.
He does, he knows. Steve doesn’t know how he’d live with himself if he’d do something like that, but his mind is simply so over-charged that it’s just going over every worst-case scenario. He looks at the contract again.
Caught by the suddenness of it, Steve found himself having to concentrate on not climaxing himself just because of how sweet Tony’s euphoric moans sounded. He didn’t want to finish inside of Tony, because with Tony’s tired state the clean up would most likely just be an unnecessary hassle.
Tony kisses him and it’s all grief, but they have each other to share it with. Steve presses his body close, pulling Tony against him like he’s afraid he’ll evaporate, and Tony touches him everywhere, his fingers working as a tool for the mental map he’s drawing inside of his head. A map of Steve, of every nook in his body, that works as proof that Steve’s still here.
Steve only hummed in response. It was true that the wound still had an odor, but it wasn’t as bad as Tony made it sound like. More importantly, it was getting more faint day by day, which was one of the small things that Steve paid more meticulous attention to than he allowed Tony to be aware of. The alpha was annoyed by the inability his wound caused him, and Steve wanted to let him not have to think about it all the time. But
”Wait”. Tony turned to face him. ”What did I say last night?”
A tear dropped to Tony’s chest from Steve’s face and he lifted his hand to wipe his eyes.
”No. But I could
”What about the Avengers?” Bucky asks after a moment of silence.
”God”, Tony pants as Steve looks at him.
”No”, Steve says for some reason, feeling stupid as soon as the word leaves his lips. He has no idea how Tony knows, but he hadn’t wanted to go all of this through in the same breath. He guesses he’ll have to. ”Sort of.”
Steve blinks at him. Why on earth would Tony try to stop him from doing
Bucky huffs amusedly.
The Steve who had always been able to tell right from wrong so easily.
Sure, he still hasn’t had his heat after giving birth, but he has just lost a child and doesn’t know if his alpha is alive or not. He can not imagine how his body could suddenly pull a stunt like this under all the grief and stress he is. His mind works fast as he tries to think of what’s gonna happen next.
Steve gets the message and leaves silently. The caveman in Tony congratulates him on being able to control his omega for once in his life. Tony sits to the floor with his whiskey and cries in a way he hasn’t since he was a child.
Tony had sipped his coffee again. He had been wanting to ask since he’d come back, but he hadn’t been sure if he could bear listening to the answer. Yet he had felt like he had to know.
Tony opened his eyes and looked at Steve.
”What are you doing, silly?”
For an answer, Steve mumbles his name out instantly, just to feel it on his tongue. He likes using Tony’s name.
Tony runs a hand across his face, sighs, and leaves the room. Steve notices Bucky giving him a look of some sort of worried disapproval but chooses to ignore it, and so they sit in silence until Tony returns, Kieran strapped into a carrier and Emmett in a basket. Even though Steve and Tony have combined their efforts to make the situation as tense and uncomfortable as possible, a smile spreads on Bucky’s face. Steve loves his friend in that moment.
Tony sets a slow pace of thrusts and Steve’s body moves like on its own, catching onto it quickly and beginning to move along seamlessly.
”Mine”, he groans, and Steve answers with an ecstatic noise, wrapping his legs around Tony.
He kissed the underside of Tony’s jaw, tasting a hint of sweat on his skin. It only made him more desperate.
”Yeah, I know. Asgardian magic apparently. But for a while it looked like it was going to be okay, since Thor could stay with me and he wasn’t affected by my heat, so it would be easy for him to respect our bond and give me privacy when… needed.”
Steve’s almost forgotten the phone call from earlier. It had been about his heat, or more accurately the lack of it. He’s over a month late.
It’s silent for a while, until Kieran has emptied his plate and deems himself eligible to talk again.
He pushes himself back up, further from Tony, who looks at him worriedly. His eyes are wet too.
”Next, the doctor told me that I would need an alpha to be with me. I said no, but he made clear that my life was in danger, and I still had Emmy, so…” Steve takes a breath. ”So we – well, Nat, really – drew up a contract for an alpha that stated that they wouldn’t be allowed to touch me unless it would become absolutely necessary. Bruce was supposed to be the judge of that medically. They would just bring their scent and get paid.”
Steve can’t help the stupid blush that creeps up his neck. What is he supposed to say to that?
Steve gathers himself rapidly, struggling to look like he’s not in the verge of a breakdown. ”Yeah, you too, Buck. Thanks for coming.”
”Mm-mh, baby. Need to feel you clench around my cock while I fuck you so good you can only think of how much you want me to come inside you.”
There’s no reaction, but at the door, Tony stops. Steve stills hopefully.
Tony looks truly taken, and he swallows before he leans closer to kiss Steve.
His expression turned into a question, his eyes going from the jar to Steve.
Nat reaches for his hand suddenly, and Steve glances at her. Her eyes are locked into the distance, to the stars and planets and asteroids they keep passing. A tear is rolling down her cheek.
Steve creeps further under the comforter. He’s not cold, but he feels a need to hide. Warily, he steals glances at Thor, who looks perfectly content drinking his beer and watching The Survivors Australia. Steve does his best to relax himself, but he can feel his body getting disturbingly excited again. Thank god – or Nat, he assumes – the sheets have at least been changed while he’s been out.
Steve takes a step closer, squinting his eyes. Indeed, an another man has followed the first one, and he does very much seem to be none other than Bruce Banner, who’s been missing since Ultron.
Tony shuffled into bed and Steve followed, discreetly helping Tony a little to get under the covers.
remember as he waddles towards the door of the workshop, trying to think, is Steve leaning against the door and probably looking at him disappointedly. He can’t remember exactly, but Steve had come home and found him drunk, of that much Tony’s sure of.
Still, it’s hard to step inside with only the three of them. Returning home without Kieran makes his death feel more real, permanent. Trying to suppress his sorrow, Steve sits down to go through the mail as Tony disappears to the workshop. At some point, he finds himself just staring, Emmett’s babbling distant in the background.
”Nothing’s wrong with him. Moomoo just likes daddy a lot.” His foot brushes Steve’s ankle under the table.
”Let me go”, he whispers powerlessly. ”Please. Let me go.”
”Do you want me to touch your cock?” Tony asks leisurely before pulling out almost entirely and then sinking back slowly, so good and deep that Steve just whimpers pathetically, his walls clinging onto Tony’s cock. He doesn’t want Tony to be focused on anything else than massaging him senseless with his cock, and thus he mumbles a breathless ”no”.
Steve glances at Tony standing behind him. Even completely naked, he looks powerful, in control, and Steve’s mouth waters as he glances at Tony’s cock hanging between his legs and imagines it inside of him. He wants to speak, to plead; not for Tony to stop, but to give him more, be it pain or pleasure. Just to give him anything that he is willing to give.
”You don’t know that.”
”Did good, beautiful.”
Then Tony stops, slowing down as he leans down to press a kiss onto Steve’s hair before pulling his fingers out entirely.
”Alpha”, he croaked, the first actual word he’d managed this morning. Tony framed his face with a hand, rubbing his cheekbone with a thumb, and Steve leaned into the touch with a content sigh.
But Tony’s not here, and Steve doesn’t know what he’s going to do.
”Let’s – let’s get you inside”, Steve says eventually, but it’s only the sight of Emmett that gets Tony finally moving. Steve helps him, and Nat offers Emmett to Tony, but Steve takes him instead. Tony is hardly strong enough to stand on his own legs.
Steve nods. In all honesty, he’s not sure. He’d wanted to please Tony. For Tony, he’d look like a whore even if he wouldn’t be that into it, but it has turned out that he is. This isn’t really the first time – even though it hasn’t included lingerie before – and surely not the last either.
”Mine”, Tony repeats, softer now, and tears are falling down Steve’s cheeks. Tony wraps his arms around his shoulders.
”Sweet thing, daddy’s little toy, daddy’s little toyboy”, Tony said softly, grabbing Steve’s cock again and pumping it with vigour. ”Come for daddy, sweetheart.”
Tony inhales, trembling with lust as Steve smudges his lips with slick. Something changes in the alpha - he closes his eyes, his breath turning short and tight. The feeling the bond channels to him makes Steve shiver – it’s not quite a threat, but it still feels like a warning. Steve keeps moving his finger on Tony’s lips, slowly and lightly, hardly daring to breathe. Every cell in his body is telling him to stop, to not tease an alpha this way, but it’s just a biological reaction and he doesn’t care because he’s hypnotised. Besides, he knows he can trust Tony.
“Deal.”
”, he echoes, snuggling his face against Steve’s neck.
Tony pets his hair. ”Don’t worry”, he tells him. ”A couple of – ah – hours and I’ll be all yours.”
”Is this what you want?”
”Better, now. I’ll tell you everything after you’ve got some rest.”
”Relax. Let’s just say that that could’ve turned very nasty.”
Steve doesn’t have to think for his answer, and there’s relief in that. That’s a big part of why he likes this, submitting himself in this way and becoming an object for Tony to do however he likes with. There are deeper reasons beyond it, ones that could say an awful lot about Steve, but he doesn’t need to think about them now. It’s good this way, simple.
”I guess so”, he admits. ”But things aren’t the same they were two months ago. Right now I’m mostly keen on protecting what we still have.”
Steve snorts, Tony’s transparent flirting making him feel brave.
”Don’t… don’t touch the bond. Don’t use it.”
It’s pure torture trying not to respond to his movements. Steve tries to take a calming breath, but Tony’s scent is all around him, never-mind the tongue in his ear, and it’s no use. Steve squirms, breathing heavily, and the ball in his mouth is on the way, drool escaping from the corners of his mouth.
Their life becomes delightfully mundane. They hold a small dinner party for Tony’s birthday, inviting their closest friends. Many are missing, due to the Accords or otherwise, but the rest come and Tony beams with pride as he gladly allows the twins to steal the spotlight from him.
“You’re not old, you’re just hangover”, Steve answered softly, but after a few strokes through Tony’s hair he withdrew his hand. But it was enough for Tony to be reminded of how horny hangovers made him, and he reached blindly behind his back in order to catch Steve’s hand. He managed to find it and pulled the arm over himself.
“Good. I love watching you, you know. You didn’t even notice the mirror, but I did, Tony. I put you right in front of it. God, you’re so fucking gorgeous when you’re close-- and I can tell you are Tony, look how desperate you are for me.”
"It used to be a borderline slum in some areas, full of poor working class stiffs, artists and writers, and misfits. They turned the St. George into student housing, and all the bar, clubs, and private rooms are gone or turned into pretentious storefronts. God only knows where all the housing went."
Well, hello there inopportune erection.
in the serum? You don’t see this shit outside of pornos, babe, and I’m really, really, glad to be part of this endeavor right now. You’re going to let me on that right now,
He should be more concerned about that.
Even in private, there was a fine curl of humiliation that wound through him and set him off balance whenever he wore one. Tiberius had insisted because he couldn’t stand to bypass the display of power, Obie had
Steve shifted his shield, gauging the angle of his throw so that it would take down the first guard, and knock over Rumlow without immediately killing him. He wanted a few words with the bastard. “You’re just pissy because you have to stay with the jet and can’t take him down yourself.”
Tony turned back around, walking towards the small desk where his laptop and tablet were, and Steve went back to wrecking the compromised restraint.
Steve grinned as he settled down at the bar, resting his hands on the distressed wood top. Now
still
Tony’s eyes are burning, his head pounds as the blood throbs against his temples, his diaphragm painfully straining as he struggles and writhes and the dead have come for their due at last.
Steve snapped his eyes open, looking up into Tony’s smirking face. He...he was dripping with precome again, just leaking, and his nerves were alight, thrumming with pleasure, and he hadn’t come yet, but...but
the influence of both Orthiel and the Winter Soldier. Nothing that had happened to him had been his choice, and even as he slipped further and further away from himself he still fought. Steve had gotten through to him on the helicarrier--he’d been sure of it. He just need more time. If Bucky could get help, Steve was sure, if he could get to him, he would be able to buoy his friend, to get him to surrender the coin, and even pull back from the Winter Soldier entirely some day. He could get Bucky
Tony had been right; one time wouldn’t be enough.
Steve rolled his hips, a fluid filthy maneuver that followed the twisting, slick wind of Tony’s hand up and down his erection, the sensation too good to ignore, demanding his attention as it began to build low and warm in his body, a too-familiar song and dance. Steve let out a whine that might have been frustration, might have been apprehension.
A do-gooding gang of rogues and scoundrel, perhaps, but a gang.
Steve shudders, every inch of him on edge and vibrating as he draws closer and closer to--to--he seizes up, back arching as he shatters and breaks. A low wail rips out of his throat as he comes harder than he ever has before, spending himself in long, forceful bursts that Tony swallows down and continues to coax out of him until he sags limply and is released with a soft ‘pop’.
Tony lays stunned on the ground for a long moment, face planted on a pebbled paver, his dazed senses struggling to get back up to spec. Urgency floods him when he gets his bearings, because that shockwave had come from the primary circle, and--
Tony walks into his foyer, the anathema lightweight and beautiful and burning a hole in his pocket, practically howling to be used, to be plunged into its intended victim’s heart.
Steve made himself comfortable on the hood of the car, turning to glance back at Tony.
about it--Tony was so tolerant, never pressuring Steve for more despite obviously wanting it, and some days Steve suspected it wasn’t so much as tolerance as determination to take whatever bit of Steve he could get his hands on and not rock the boat for fear of losing the little he had. It wasn’t fair to either of them, but Steve was equally unwilling to lose Tony, so they skirted around the elephant in the bedroom as much as best they could, and Tony settled and Steve...endured.
, and he’s content to let Steve have it. If it’s even Steve anymore. Tony’s tried to focus on his magical tattoo or whatever the hell it is, but nothing works. Steve’s not in there right now, and he can’t figure out if it’s temporary or if the goat brain is all that’s left and Steve is
Tony. I just...let him fall, and then abandoned him to the cold wilderness, and while I should have been looking, Hydra found him instead, and they tortured him, and they broke him, and they wiped away his memories and pressed a blackened denari into his hand and sent him forth to murder. Orthiel is the Winter Soldier, and the Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, and it’s
Oh, God.
“Nothing to--shit, Tony, do you know what I had to put up with?” Steve demanded, blood rushing to his face. “I decided to surprise you--” Steve gestured at himself “--and when I went out to pick up a few things earlier to welcome you home, guess what I got to see?”
Even in the low to non-existent light, Tony could tell the man was absolutely ripped. That poor shirt looked like it was staying buttoned solely by wishes and hope. A million jokes about Officer See-more Butts filled his mind but Tony pushed them aside, suddenly interested in how this played out.
Steve finally ground out, “is that you are utterly oblivious to anyone else’s feelings but your own, Tony. I’ve been dealing with the blow-up from your fun little dinner, and Pepper’s had to clean up the mess before it negatively affects your company, and the other Avengers have been harassed by random paparazzi looking for a comment or a juicy insight, and you can’t see past your own nose enough to understand
Waking up had been...unexpected. Dazed and confused and barely processing the fact that he
They’d consulted with sorcerers, various supernatural entities,
because he’d just had his car detailed and now he had All-American jizz all over that once-pristine finish and he was going to take it out of Steve’s ass, he hadn’t come yet and Steve had better hold on because he was
Steve huffed out a bitter chuckle, and looked back up at night sky, reveling in the mild breeze and crisp night air. He started up his bike again, resigned to ending yet another routine day by going home and crawling into a too-soft bed while he waited for his life to become meaningful again, when a sleek red car blurred by, its driver shooting past like they were immortal and didn’t have to worry about minor inconveniences like traffic laws or crashing and going out in a ball of fire and scattered car parts.
“They had all sorts of folk during my era, Tony, and Brooklyn Heights in particular was a hub for the LGBT community--is that still the term, or did that change?--anyway, it’s hardly a shocker. I’ve been informed that more than a few academics had their speculations about me.
It takes a herculean effort not to cave to the weight of all those looks, but he manages, shrugging nonchalantly as he hedges as best he can. “Steve’s one of the best men I know and a very close friend. Of course, I love him.”
“Superheroes and their appetites, Patty. You’d be surprised.”
This lesson, in the continuing trend of Tony's life, is learned the hard way.
“Back inside, Cap?”
“Charmer. Let me finish getting some proof my dad’s will was altered, then we rob this dirtbag blind, and then...talk? Kiss. Both?”
devastates his throat.
“Tony, I--”
“We’ll get you fixed up, Steve.”
It wasn’t like Tony was
Tony finally (sadly) abandoned the scalp massage and moved back to his torso, rubbing his hands across the hard planes of his abs and his pecs, scratching lightly through his chest hair. Steve shuddered suddenly, the vague pleasantness shifting and turning into something more urgent, heightened to an arc of sudden
Steve heaved a lofty sigh, and handed Natasha his binoculars. “Two guards in multicam, 8 o’clock, 13 feet. Semi-automatic rifles, guessing AR-556.”
to hear how fucked out you are, to know Tony Stark wrecked your hole .”
A shadow fell over him, and Steve drank in the sight of the fae prince. Out of favor Tony Stark might be, but he was still Winter Court, and royal, and he wore the stamp of it proudly. His goatee was perfectly trimmed, and his dark hair was artfully cut and spiked. Today he’d donned a different suit of armor, and it was just as impressive and foreboding as the Iron Man armor itself. The bespoke suit he wore was worn with devastating effect, pearl white over a navy blue dress shirt with a muted silver tie tucked neatly into the accompanying vest, with tasteful diamond and sapphire cufflinks and a large diamond tie pin. Every line of the suit was flawless, flattered him completely, with nary a wrinkle or stain in sight despite Tony having no doubt slouched and paced and fretted for…for...
Steve was lost to it, not even registering Tony’s words, not really, recognizing them more as that maddeningly enticing drone that played havoc with his hearing and sent pleasurable little tremors deep down into his head, down his spine, speaking lust into his every limb and calling it forth with touches and caresses that trapped him further and further under Tony’s spell until he was left reeling, rocking and tossed on a sea of desire that seemed to move with him, move in a counterpoint that carried him further and further away towards a brilliant end that--that--wait--wha--
Holy fuck, he didn’t know they
Dear God, the burning.
, and sighed resignedly. “Fuck Steve, this isn’t 2007, I can’t handle another public indecency charge, I--”
“Oh hell yeah, babe, just like that Brooklyn.” Tony’s voice grew rough as Steve’s hand clamped over his and sped up. It wasn’t a good idea normally--this was the point that things went wrong, when he sped past his own tolerances or got tripped up on his own hangups, but this time, this time Tony was perfectly attuned to him, it seemed, not quite working
He’d finally pushed past the limits of Steve’s patience, though, and the world (well, the rest of the team anyway, which had been bad enough) was gifted with the sight of Captain America hauling off and yanking one of his spare combat belts out of a storage compartment so that he could wrap it around the neck of Tony’s armor. Tony had been shocked immobile, utterly stunned as Steve fucking pulled rank as his Dom
“First of all, you could've left along with everyone else, and if nothing else, you should have ducked that kiss!! I meant it when I said he doesn’t get to touch you!”
He can’t draw him now, but there’ll be other nights, other moments, and he’ll indulge himself then. For now, though? Steve stares down at Tony, and whispers it again into the quiet. “I love you.”
Tony let out a broken sob and threw his head back, gasping for breath, and it was all too much for Steve and he rolled them over in order to get better leverage as he pumped himself in and out of Tony, lost to his own pleasure again. This one was even better than the shower, better than the one he’d had earlier because he was fully aware of this one and not gone off on a mental jaunt, and all he felt was good and relaxed and so damn wonderful. It had been so long, it had been so long and it was so good, so perfect, and he loved it, had never felt like so completely blissed-out and at peace in his life, and he wanted more, more,
No, he's just overreacting. Steve’s not permanently a goat or anything, Strange can fix it, they just need to wait for him. And until then, Steve is okay. Just distracted with...goat things. Goat things like climbing all over his furniture and eating anything that catches his eye and occupying that strange space between cute and really fucking weird. No need to panic.
No updates since then. It was already ten minutes after--if this ended with him being stood up, he was never trusting Nat again. Steve pocketed his phone and leaned against the streetlight so he wasn’t blocking the sidewalk flow, and took in the sights and sounds of his old neighborhood only to realize that there was nothing there that was familiar.
The sheer
Steve’s hips stuttered, his rhythm broken as he visualized Tony, rumpled and sprawled lazily in the driver’s seat, that utterly perverted mouth wide open as the filthiest sounds escaped Tony’s throat, one hand on the steering wheel and the other in his pants.
paper, metal, cardboard, wiring, clothes, plants, furniture, decor,
An incredulous silence settles over everyone as they stare at the most patriotic goat alive. A few of the NYPD officers actually switch their aim over to Steve, not sure who to trust anymore. The Wrecking Crew are all just as stunned, and the only sound heard above the background noise created by the park at large is Thunderball’s plaintive, “
Steve was actually left speechless for a moment. He'd seen it all--crying, pleading, anger, and in one particularly awful incident, physical illness.
“He’s got a point.” Natasha reached for one of her pistols. I’ll be sure to take that up with Rumlow as well, Hawkeye.”
Tony glanced back out of his rearview mirror and perked up in interest as he took in a rather magnificent ass clad in tan uniform pants so tight they must have been painted on, tucked into a pair of leather boots. God, what a view. Tony blinked in shock as the cop straightened up from the saddle box where he’d dug a flashlight out and strode over towards the car.
That’s
“What was that, Steve, honey? Harder? Faster?
Steve was in pain.
Tony grinned as he glanced back over and took in Steve’s situation, watching the way Steve shuddered and rocked as the intensity of the vibrations dropped down to an almost gentle hum. Steve sagged into the tangle of sheets and pillows, letting out a blissful sigh as warm pleasure rushed along his nerves.
Tony caught Steve by the hand and drew him over to the shower, pulling him along until he was in the middle of the different sprays, and the easy flow of warm water over and around his body--such a difference from Tony’s own painfully rough and scorching blasts--began to offset the worst of his aches.
It feels like forever before he finally works himself all the way down, and Tony lets out a sobbing gasp as Steve settles in his lap. Tony feels so good inside him, hot and hard, the stretch and heavy sensation of being filled so tightly making him tremble and pant as he adjusts in achingly intense stages.
Tony drew in a deep breath through his nose and relaxed his throat, and the long, incredulous, nigh orgasmic noise Steve produced made Tony regret not having his phone out. A sound like that needed to be preserved, and he would have fucking recorded it and set it as his text alert tone because
He’s been barricaded up here for hours, days, a week, perhaps; he’s lost all concept of time, and JARVIS doesn’t speak to him anymore. No help there. JARVIS is gone. Where’s JARVIS? JARVIS doesn’t speak to him anymore. No help there. JARVIS. No help. This should terrify him, should drive him wild with fury and fear and he’s floundering and the thoughts run loose and spiral and he needs help he needs—“JARVIS!
“I mean, that’s fair, though? Obie steals everything, the bastard. He stole my company, stole my designs, and stole most of my inheritance. I’m not surprised he stole your whatever and is auctioning it off.”
Wanda immediately freezes, hand still outstretched, as he leaps backs away from her while cradling his sigil protectively. There’s a flash of concern across the mental bond, and then a protective surge of emotion, and suddenly Steve is in front of Tony, making angry goat noises and brandishing his horns.
Steve is out of the dining chair and almost about to lunge across the table, ready to attack, ready to strike, trying to finally kill him.
Okay, the Globe could go fuck themselves.
Tony considered staying put for a mutinous second but knew it would go worse for him in the end. Besides, Steve had a point, didn’t he? And Pepper...he was going to catch hell from Pepper too. She always got a bit testy whenever Ty came into the picture, and any week that damned sex tape came crawling out of whatever hole they’d buried it in was a bad one. Steve would’ve been the one to bear the brunt of that inevitable explosion, because Pepper would’ve told him about the tape, and that conversation always went badly for anyone involved. As leader of the Avengers, Steve also would’ve been the one inundated with phone calls and emails about the headlines. The sex tape would have only compounded the whole mess exponentially, and Tony had no illusions about how all that had been going for Steve. It was going to be two weeks, maybe three, before everything died down and was replaced with a more interesting scandal, and if Steve didn’t snap and go off the deep end before it was all over, it would be a miracle.
And what, exactly, would anyone have to gain by tricking him into believing Steve was in his head?
“STEVE!”
He hates that scent.
“President of African Operations. We might feed you the Australia region, too. Oceania is always weird when it comes to structuring.”
” Steve arched into the sensation as Tony bit his collarbone and then licked up the side of his neck before nibbling at the patch of skin just below his ear, wreaking havoc on his nerves.. “Or do you want me to drop you?”
Goat.
Tony’s briefcase crashed to the floor with a loud clatter that he scarce paid heed to, because...because…
—confront it.
Steve tapped his earbud twice, disconnecting it from the comm channel.
It wasn’t his Commandos, but it was just as good in its own way, and he could actually admit to being grateful that Sitwell and Rumlow had so casually offered him that fateful Hail Hydra--as if they thought he was going to return it!--that sent him away from SHIELD and back to the Avengers, Natasha and Clint in tow.
Tony makes a kittenish noise in his sleep and tucks in tighter around Steve's frame before stilling again, his breathing deep and slow. Maybe he’ll draw Tony like this, long and lean in the moonlight, dark sheets pooling low over his waist and sleeping peace turning him uncharacteristically soft. He looks almost a decade younger like this, and he can’t help but marvel at the difference.
Steve had settled the collar around Tony’s neck as he spoke, pulling it snug and buckling it with quick, sure, movements. Tony shuddered, hating the way it settled heavily on his neck, with the studs lining the inside ensuring that he wouldn’t just adapt to its presence and forget it was there. No, he was going to be aware of every second of the time he had to wear it, constantly reminded of his mistakes.
“I should have known.”
Steve had to pause for a second to mentally regroup. Tony Stark was offering him sex, right here, right now, on a lark. He should say no, call in for a car, and have him shipped right off to the nearest station. On the other hand...what an opportunity it was. Steve had never asked for much in his life, and it would be fun to live a little, like his fellow officers insisted. He’d been
Tony was there in a flash, flicking the tube open with his free hand and using the glowing blue led light of his watch to provide some extra light as he sought out Steve’s hole. Once located, Tony didn’t waste time with theatrics or teasing and set about stretching Steve as much as he could. Steve was just as eager as Tony was, urging him onward as he managed to work in one finger, then another. He had to make this good for Steve.
Steve stares patiently back at him, but...he doesn’t hear him.
When Steve came back to himself, he was limp, boneless with pleasure, utterly satisfied and ears ringing--he’d been screaming, shouting Tony’s name, he’d--he’d come again, he was sticky and a mess, long ropes of come shot over Tony’s chest and across his own stomach, and hell, Steve wasn’t sure he even had it in him to feel
“Dammit, Stark!” Feeling a bit ridiculous at yelling at a car that was already whipping around the next turn, Steve shook his head ruefully as he walked back over to this bike, enjoying the hitch and ache that moved with him. He’d be fine in a few minutes. Steve settled and reached for his key, only to feel something pointy and rigid in his pocket.
issue with the morning gets flung in his face. Steve’s supposed to be in there, dammit, but all he can feel is an unsettling
He goes quite willingly.
Tony, Steve had discovered, loved to play in his hair. Whenever Tony happened upon him, it was almost inevitable that those restless fingers would find their way into his hair, tousling and stroking it absently. It was nice enough, but Steve preferred the moments when he would lean into the touch and press his scalp against Tony’s hand. Tony would instantly switch to massaging his scalp, and the soft pressure and gentle scritching of Tony’s blunt nails was soothing enough that he could actually forget about his general discomfort for a few minutes. It was never enough to entirely dull the tension and aches that nipped at his heels, but he
He doesn’t see how he could ever have planned for this.
He ignores the truth screaming at him, locked away in the darkest recesses of his mind, because Tony can’t—
into his neck and slices, opening up a cut deep enough to get a steady flow going.
, I’ll drag you off to jail and--” Steve’s threat broke off into a low, halting grunt as Tony pressed into him, and even stretched and turned on as he was, he had to make himself relax and not clench up around the sudden intrusion. Tony was solicitous, rubbing his back and staying as still as he could.
“Well, hello there Hydra.”
This was
JARVIS saved him. He remembers dashing for the elevator while a suit held Steve at bay. Steve no doubt ran down the stairs (rightfully suspecting JARVIS would simply trap him in an elevator) to cut him off in the foyer of the tower, and his faithful AI rocketed him to the penthouse and promptly removed all access—no...JARVIS is gone...
Steve snapped back into him then, a rough, low grunt punctuating his thrust, and Tony moaned loudly, still too far out into the midst of the storm rising within him to modulate his voice, and Steve’s hand slapped back over his mouth because even the tie was starting to not be enough as he continued to whisper every lewd intent and carnal wish into his ear, knowing that Tony’s over-active mind would bring each one to life with exceptional clarity and only add fuel to the fire.
Natasha sniffed disdainfully. “It could be.”
Natasha’s bleeding out from her bite wounds. Clint’s in slightly better shape, but he’s bitten and liable to keel over any moment. Hulk stands guard between them and the oncoming vampires, batting them away and smashing the more determined ones into the earth.
Leave that alone.
Steve Rogers, Captain America himself, is a goat.
being manhandled by Tony--and he gleefully gives in to an urge he’s always daydreamed of but long written off as impossible. He leaps up, looping his arms around Tony’s neck and wrapping his legs around Tony’s waist.
“Wait...are you kin to Howard Stark!?”
Tony wakes with a stomach roiling in rage and guilt and shame and
“Hello, Shellhead.”
For a moment, Tony thought Steve actually
them. Blood was thicker than whiskey, Tony had said once. He would have the Soldier’s head on a platter, if Mab herself didn’t beat him to it.
There was a muffled noise and a curse, and something that might have been an accusation of demonic influence from Tony, but Steve ignored it, enjoying the easy lull and the satisfaction of a good time while they waited for the suit.
“You won’t even look at me now, Tony?”
Steve started to reply, then froze after a phone buzzed.
“Why?
Tony, Thor had informed him, had manifested armor for him just to see him safe. Powerful armor. He wasn’t even
He didn’t want calming, he wanted relief, and Tony was a damned
Tony, say it.” It’s more plea than demand, really. Tony’s abandoned his lips and is trailing his tongue down the side of his neck, pressing kisses into his taut muscles, and Steve is squirming beneath him, his breath coming in rough pants as Tony using lips and tongues and teeth to besiege each and every one of his erogenous zones. Down, Tony goes, down from his neck to the narrow ridges of his collarbone, nipping and licking at Steve’s sensitive skin before continuing further down, scattering kisses and gentle nips and licks over his torso.
“Jan!”
He doesn’t dare eat.
He sure as hell hadn’t lied.
turn at any moment.
He allowed his gaze to travel lazily all the way down and back up the officer’s body before he tossed out the filthiest leer in his repertoire and followed it up with a roguish wink.
Steve snorted in fond remembrance. “Hell, everyone was. Your dad
Guilty, like he thought Steve blamed him.
Items in hand, Tony leaned into Steve, nuzzling against the side of the man’s neck for a moment just to luxuriate in the scent of cold air and the surprisingly clean scent of Steve. His skin was incredibly smooth, like he shaved especially close and Tony had to wonder just what kind of razor the man was using to get the effect.
Steve nods gratefully, and Tony pulls out the blankest face in his arsenal when Steve links their arms tighter as he walks him back to the mansion. Steve is half-naked and plastered to his side, and now Tony has to stop himself from springing wood as Steve’s body shifts and rubs against his while his pathetic heart goes pitter-patter like he’s a schoolboy with a crush. Which, to be fair, he was. This torch he carriest for Steve was lit a
cares for Steve, really, he does, but the nightmare is never-ending. Goats eat
Tony pulled his wallet out of an inner pocket in his jacket and opened it up, producing a string of condoms. The wallet went back in his pocket, and Tony reached for the other side and returned with a small tube of what Steve pretty quickly figured out had to be lube.
Tony stares in horror at the grotesque apparition placidly watching him from the opposite end of the table, blue eyes cold with malice and glinting with promised violence. It’s the gaze of a starving predator, and Tony can’t help but shudder, entirely at a loss for words and not quite sure if he should just run screaming from the room or blink so that it would disappear when he opened his eyes.
Not that there’s much levity to be found in Steve running around as a vampire in the first place.
Tony’s eyes squeeze shut, and when they open again, Tony’s staring at him like he hung the moon and scattered the stars in the sky. “I love you, Steve.”
Jesus. What were you thinking about?”
This can and
The days blur together, and he doesn’t remember if it’s Monday or Saturday or the next month already.
“Steve, no!
Tony made a smug noise in the back of his throat as he continued the kiss, angling his hips in order to grant Steve better access to the metallic head of the plug stretching him wide open.
Oh, for fuck’s sake.
and how was he supposed to make him understand? Bucky was
Fucking.
“He’s just playing around, Steve.”
The room is hot and thick with the smell of sex, and the air moving over his sweat-slick skin causes goosebumps to prickle on his arms as he shivers and squirms under Tony’s hold. Tony hums again and it’s too much for him to contain and he shouts, yanks his hand out of his mouth and lets it flop onto the bed so he can tangle it in the sheets as sharp bursts of pleasure rock through him. He wants more, he wants faster and harder and he wants Tony to be in him, pounding him through a quaking orgasm until he’s used up and limp and unable to so much as twitch.
it’s a moot point, really, and Steve simply lunges at the countertop and occasionally plants his front hooves on top of it to butt at Clint’s feet or legs, and sometimes just to make a weird screaming warble at him that almost sounds like a name, but also closely resembles a helpless creature being strangled.
before he’d left for business Sunday night, and then he’d been gone the whole week down in Texas for a NASA consult. That had been all business.
The Merchant of Death, they had called him once upon a time, and Tony supposes that his detractors had the right of it. Tony has
Holy shit, what the hell was this about?
Tony smirked up at him. “And let Nat get the upper hand?”
Plenty, because Tony still
,If ever there was a moment he could have vented out all his pain--emotional and physical--it was after he lost Bucky. He could have yelled, could have wept, could have smashed things, just...put a hole through the wall and had a raging fit. He could have done all that, unloaded decades of pain and a war’s worth of horror and trauma underneath the guise of lashing out over Bucky’s loss--but everyone expected him to be in control. Somewhere along the way, people had forgotten there was a simple man behind Captain America, and they expected him to constantly be some kind of paragon of virtue and strength. Everyone had their damn eyes on him, watching to see how he handled this personal disaster, waiting for the

who let out a gleeful chirp and tackled the smaller tsum, who was holding a micro sd card in its mouth. The microSD card slid across the floor, but the tsum didn’t seem to care at all, eagerly nuzzling against Steve’s tsum in return.
“Pat, that’s--that’s
... Steve wound the length of chain in his hand tighter and tighter, drawing Tony in closer, like he was an unruly pet. He could already feel his face starting to warm up as he flushed.
God, even the man’s ass was perfect, Tony mused, enjoying the sight of Steve blissed out and bent over the hood of the Saleen. Tony stroked a hand over the globes of Steve’s ass, marveling at the masterpiece before him. Firm, well sized, and the cutest little dimple right above his right cheek. After a few quiet minutes, Steve began to stir again, and Tony leaned over his back in order to press a kiss just below his earlobe.  “You came so prettily for me, Steve, so prettily. Do you think you can take me?”
“Just this one, thankfully. This is

“Harder Steve, like that, show me more.”
be a way to lengthen the duration, however?”
He didn’t mind at all.
“Steve, was that--?” Tony’s voice drags off into a wondering moan as Steve takes his marked hand and presses a kiss against it. It goes back and forth between them, the pulses of love and affection as Steve demands more and more of Tony and he answers unflinchingly, always eager to please.
"Captain America downed everything from bathtub gin to torpedo juice, and whatever the hell it was Howard and Gabe were brewing in the still behind the mess hall. And that’s to say nothing of the various alcohol stashes that we liberated from the Nazis.”
This is going to be one of
Steve registers sharp sensation on his palm, like a brand has been pressed to it, but it is almost immediately lost as pleasure, brilliant and wild, sets the bond ablaze, and all of it is just too much and the world goes dark as he collapses bonelessly on top of Tony.
“I have someone for you. He’s just your type. Brunette, feisty.”
“No, but you know damn well that I don’t like him around you--and for good fucking reason--and the next thing I know, you’re on the other side of the country with him and having dinner together, and he’s in your space and kissing you, and
“This is the best day ever.”
“It’s okay, Steve. It was an ugly couch anyway.”
The way Tony says his name is dazed and rough and thick with lust and yearning as Steve lowers himself down his erection, and he firmly commits to the intent to drag it out of Tony as often as possible.
“You came so hard you passed out, rich boy. It’s pretty damn flattering.”

Stane Industries?”
“No, that’s a goat, right now. Can you even understand him?”
Steve glared at Tony when he slyly began to hum the chorus to The Stars and Stripes Forever.
“It’s 3 am, Tony.”
It’s a moment too long.
There’s a horrified croaking noise that is either Tony lost for words or being possessed by a demon, and Steve squeezes Tony’s arm reassuringly. It has the opposite effect, though. Tony starts to lean into the contact, then jerks back the other way.
He can feel the grin tugging at his lips, and idly twirls a hand through Tony’s curling hair. Tony’s been wearing it straighter and more neatly trimmed now, but he used to have such curls. In his idle daydreams of things he once thought could never be, he’d wanted to just bury his hands in the unruly mass and bask in his presence. Some stupid silly thing, born more of a deep-laden desire to wrap himself around Tony.
“That is troubling indeed, but we are a learned and mighty lot. I do not doubt that between all of us, we might not uncover a way to right this mischief cast upon our bold Captain.” Thor rests a companionable hand on Jan’s shoulder, gesturing cheerfully with Mjolnir. One of these days Thor is going to knock out a light fixture. Tony just knows it.
Tony kicks it aside and makes a mental note to pick it up later.
Steve’s voice was still heavy with erotic menace, but there was also careful attention underneath it, and Tony knew that all he had to do was nod and Steve would call a halt to everything.
“How the hell do you figure I’d

A round of negative replies comes from the Avengers. What the hell good is it having a master of the mystic arts on tap if they’re never around when you need them?
He’s so tired, so hungry.
Tony wakes in a panic, scrabbling at his throat. The chill clench of Howard’s fingers sting as they dig further in, throttling him, his father’s nails filthy with blood and grave-dirt leaving a souvenir of half-moon indentations.

lovely fact registering in his expression, either. “Got it in one. You’ll be putting work in on this one, Tony. You’re going to cater to my every need, just the same way you catered to yours at that dinner and started all this mess. You’re going to fuck me again, and again, and then maybe--
“Alright, Winghead. We’re going to fix you, okay? Don’t worry. I won’t let anything happen to mess it up. You’re a great guy, and just...you’re the best, Steve. It’s going to be okay.”

Thus Maria, who brewed toxin, coaxed venom from snakes and spiders, and let death bloom in the fertile grounds of her garden. He spent his daylight hours mastering his father’s science, his evenings at his mother’s side learning the darker, quieter cruelties of his ancestral craft, and in the blending of the two discovered how to forge horrors.
“That’s better.” Tony stepped back from Steve and turned to reach for the bottle of shampoo he kept nearby. A quick three pumps, and then Tony was rubbing a handful of shampoo between his hands before ordering Steve to lean his head back. Steve obliged him, and Tony smeared the shampoo on his hair with broad strokes, coating all of his hair with the thick teakwood and tea tree oil shampoo that made his nostrils tingle with the crisply exotic scent.
“What the hell Steve, did you get turned into a goat or an octopus?”
Tony is, first and foremost, a smith, and his craft room reflects it.
mistake was trusting Tony’s seemingly innocent offer to “try something new.”
“What a sight that would be, huh? Half of the silver spoons in New England crowding in the doorway to see what the ruckus was and discovering it’s you getting fucked senseless.”
This couldn’t be real life. Steve lifted his glasses to the top of head in order to look at Stark unimpeded. “Did you just offer me sex to not write you a ticket?”
Natasha slipped away with a quiet chuckle as he turned his earbud back on, and calculated his shot.
"Jan, it’s always good to see you, and thank you so much for all the help, Thor. I really appreciate it. Now, you’ll excuse us, Tony and I need to have a
Fuuuuuuuccckkk.
Keeping it classy, InTouch. Tony started to speak, but Steve flicked his hand and swept away the first holographic tabloid, only to be met with the same image but a different headline.
This is for Steve, and he can’t screw it up for him. He
Steve had then trotted his happy goat behind into the mansion and climbed up right on top of Tony's Chateau D’Ax sofa and proceeded to eat it, too.
“Oh, you don’t pick your order.” Steve looked between Milo and Tony incredulously. Milo is some kind of bartender wunderkind--he knows what the best order is for you just by looking. He gives you the drink, you drink it, love it, and say ‘thank you, sir, may I have another?’. Trust in the suspenders.”
Any fascination he had with the car quickly faded as Stark slid out in a negligently graceful move.
“It’s
You don’t have the
“Anthony.”
Wanda nods at Thor, who calls down a massive bolt of lightning from Mjolnir. The night air begins to stink of ozone and sharp heat while the hairs on Tony’s arm and the back of his neck prickle with static electricity. Tony has to blink and turn his gaze aside, the brilliant blue-white lightning near-blinding. The crackling and popping electricity forms into a ball of what Tony would swear must be plasma it’s so concentrated, and Thor hurls it straight at Wanda when she nods.
The reality is leagues better, anyway.
There was a sudden flare then drop of speed as Tony played with the dial in the middle of the remote, his usual warning that things were going to get intense, and Steve made a panicked noise, his eyes going wide as he was suddenly very afraid of what the toy was capable of.
“Was there something you wanted, Steve?”
, this time. Steve was ruthless, seemingly delighting in the fact that Tony had been knocked off balance and was rapidly losing more and more of his control.
worked alone. Steve has a way of...rallying people to his causes. Tony doubts Steve is going to return to the European wilds to frolic with the vampire neo-nazi Hydra agents—and quite honestly he expects that Steve quite gleefully murdered the whole lot of them before returning to the Tower—but Steve has stolen his mother’s bones to recreate Howard’s serum, and it doesn’t take a genius (even if he is one) to figure out his next move from there.
Tony’s finger edged back toward the dial, stroking it thoughtfully but doing nothing, obviously waiting for the perfect moment to strike.
Well.
Someone swears quietly in the background but quickly falls silent. The quickest way to set Steve off is to underestimate him, especially by insinuating he’s physically useless in a situation, and he can feel his back stiffening as his ire is raised. He’s not bulked up, but he’s got skills, and training, and experience on his side. He should be out there, and instead he has to deal with Tony trying to mollycoddle him, as if he isn’t capable of taking care of himself!
“Try half of that and then some, Capsicle.” Tony sighed contentedly.
“Brooklyn.” Steve’s native accent came through in all its glory, and Tony damn near died.
Steve removed his hand for a moment to reposition one of Tony’s legs and shift him back into a more manageable position, and Tony’s voice was loud and strained above the wet, sticky slapping together of their flesh and mingled frantic, gasping exertions.
That had been...Tony wasn’t even sure how long Steve had been at it, but it had been enough time to make a ruin of him.
Steve bucked up involuntarily, wanting, wanting, and impatient for the fall.
was, but that he also deliberately withheld that information from him? That spoke of a level of omniscience--and malice--that Steve just couldn’t believe Tony was capable of.
“Pat, Patty! Calm down. I haven’t done anything
Tony repeated the gesture, that same light scratch, and Steve’s breath caught.
Steve plows straight into Wrecker, knocking him off of his feet, and before the villain can stand up, a hammer smashes into Piledriver. Piledriver can sometimes hold against Mjolnir, but caught off guard? The point goes to Thor, and Piledriver goes flying backwards to land on top of Wrecker. Steve lets a surprisingly horrifying bleat and menaces the pair of them with his horns while the rest of the Avengers come running towards them.
Tony rams the fork he’d secreted away into his thigh, the tines breaking through his black slacks and through his skin in a dull burst of pain that rapidly sharpens as a fiery prickling radiates from the site of the injury.
“Ah.” Natasha let the silence settle for a moment, and Steve was grateful for the quiet memoriam, grateful that he’d at least gotten to see Arnie one last time before the cancer had stolen him away mere weeks after he’d gotten out the ice.
He just needed to work through this hurdle with Tony, and then? Then, when they were good, when Tony was in a better state? He would tell him about the assassination Hydra had arranged. And, maybe, maybe he didn’t have to say anything at all. When he finished investigating and had tracked Bucky down, maybe he would’ve discovered that it hadn’t been the Soldier who’d done the deed, in the end. Hydra had plenty of agents, and Howard had always had his share of enemies, and maybe, maybe Zola had been lying. Trying to throw them off balance long enough to launch that missile. Or just toying with him because he could.
Steve yanked furiously at his restraints. They were strong enough to handle his enhanced capabilities, but Steve hadn’t
Steve’s going to be slinging vampire venom like it was E-time at Club USA.
a car like this one before, all sleek curves and sharp edges and blatant power. He’d been secretly impressed with the way the car zipped along the sinuous beauty that was Mulholland, taking each turn tight and precise and graceful, arrogant in the execution and deservedly so. Stark hadn’t dipped below 70, often stayed above 90, uncaring and unafraid because he had gentled this magnificent beast of a car to his touch, and that assurance bled through everything.
Steve pushed open the door to the master bathroom, and stopped short, his undershirt falling to the floor as he grip loosened in shock.
Steve’s little burbles of delight deepen into rough, ecstatic screams as Tony hits that perfect bundle of nerves and hones in, striking it again and again and again, a slave to Steve’s demands. Steve’s orgasm seemed to slam into him like a trainwreck, and Tony wants to pause, wants to watch, but Steve hisses for more, hisses for him to keep going, keep
Tony leaned over him, pressing a light kiss to his jaw, to his neck, and then traced the curve of his ear with the tip of his tongue. Steve moaned, felt himself flush with want. God, he loved it when Tony played with his ears, with his neck, his skin so sensitive there...
“You make too much noise for you to be worried about cops,” Steve teased as he began to speed up his hand, chasing the rising sparks of pleasure and pooling warmth, growing impossibly harder when Tony made a frantic noise and his breath began to stutter. They were nearing a peak, and Steve’s balls began to draw up and tighten and oh, that was so much better, felt so wonderful, and God, this was going to be spectacular and
Credit where it was due, though: Howard Stark had been a weaponsmith without peer. That is, at least, until Tony had been born.
Tony had come back to himself weak-kneed and painfully aware of every inch of his body, from the tingling in his scalp to the cool air over his undoubtedly bruised neck, and his curled toes pressed against the seam of his dress socks as he struggled to keep his balance and not lose footing on the cold marble floor.
“Mr. Stark, you were going way too fast--”
Tony freezes under him, and Steve isn’t sure if it’s rejection or surprise or what, but Tony relaxes suddenly, lips parting beneath his, and
Tony’s eyes prickle with tears, and Steve leans forward and presses a kiss to the corner of his eyes, sweetly teases at Tony’s lips and nibbles lightly at them before pulling back.
if you think you could handle my kind of a good time, we’re gonna go find a bar. You’re going to feed me a greasy burger, with at least two patties, and a mound of fries.”
Tony doesn’t remember anything but howling for JARVIS, running for the elevator as a suit burst through the wall, gold and red fury reducing the kitchen to wreckage behind him.
Natasha was unfazed with the sarcasm, however, and slotted a slender battery pack into the Widow’s Bite on her left wrist before looking up at him with a slight quirk of her lips. “Vicki from Cryptography has a thing for baritones and loves karaoke. If you ask her out, she’d probably say yes.”
He'd never been so blatantly propositioned before. Part of him was secretly thrilled because he’d
“Can you not be a total killjoy and go on one single date? It’ll be worth your while…”
A tear falls from his eye, splattering onto Steve’s throat.
“Are you saying I’m

Tony had thought that would be the end of it, that he would be offering up an apology and a blowjob for leaving Steve back at the starting line, but an erotically sinister laugh had registered over the rushing blood in his head, and then Steve had lowered himself to the floor so that he was kneeling with Tony’s back pressed flat against his torso and his still-trembling legs were braced on either side of Steve’s rather massive lap.
Still, Steve had been edgy about Ty ever since, no matter that Ty had just been playing around and taken things too far, or that Tony wasn’t interested.
no us, Steve. You’ve got Sharon and I--”
Unfortunately, overexposure to such a strong sensation began to work against him, and his scalp was tingling more and more sharply, the cooling sensation just a bit too strong, and he began to edge towards uncomfortable from the astringent effects of the tea tree oil.
He hates magic so very, very much.
Tony stroked up one side and down the other with the back of his hand, trying to get a decent feel for Steve’s sizing. Not too long, Tony decided, only an inch or two above average, but the width…oh
Tony ignores Steve’s outraged roar and lunges across the room for the anathema, the handle sticking out from under the edge of the armchair.

driving a race car. He shifted to the next gear, increasing his speed, and reveled in the knowledge that he was going too fast but managing to handle it anyway. It felt a little flying, the way the trees around him blurred as he sped through, and the wind noise, barely covered up by the driving guitar and drums of Bush’s
Thor clears his throat awkwardly, and all of their attention shifts over to him. “I will away and track down Amora, that she might undo this most foul enchantment.”

Tony opened his mouth to say something, anything, but Steve placed a finger over his lips. “We’re fixing that, Tony,
Okay, even if the innuendo hadn’t been blatant, the blown kiss and eyebrow waggle was. Stark had to be drunk or high--no one was this deliberately suggestive during a traffic stop.

Tony’s thrusts turn more and more sharp, more frantic, and it’s just right, too much, not enough,
The surviving Carbonells never regained their status, but neither did their craft falter, passed on from generation to generation in secret and shadow, because all knowledge was worth having.
A twisting unease turns his stomach sour, and it’s everything Steve can do not to hunch in on himself.

“You feel so good in my hand, Stevie darling, so slick and hot and you’re so
It was over in a matter of moments, Steve’s mouth dropping open in a silent scream as he suddenly tumbled right over the edge, coming, and coming, and coming all over Tony’s spent cock, over his hands, over the front of Tony’s slacks when he jerked involuntarily.
He didn’t get to keep things, just memories. At least his perfect recall meant he’d have something to trot out on his lonelier nights.
Steve began tugging at his restraints, determined to get loose.
He’s utterly encompassed by the man, mentally, emotionally, and physically. He would almost feel self-conscious, but judging from the soft litany of his name on Tony’s lips, the stuttered praises and sweet endearments and the look of utter blissed out peace stealing across his face, he supposes that it must be the same for him, too.
He has a thousand things he wants to say to Tony, but that can be later. Right now, though, he focuses on Tony’s face. Tony hasn’t met his gaze once since their midnight confrontation, and God, who could blame him? Those blue eyes go warm, and Tony’s pupils dilate, and Steve can see him trying to mask it, to recall his composure, but there has always been intensity between them, and Tony has never been capable of indifference where he’s concerned.
Steve lets his wrists go, and the truth is there in the way Tony
There’s a loud indignant bleat, and Steve is dashing toward Wrecker himself.
Tony shifted in his seat, playing it off as a slouch and not the desperate attempt to avoid springing wood it actually was. So, yeah, that 1,500 horsepower had hit him harder than he thought, and with it came a sense of devil-may-care attitude and a heaping dose of raw mischief besides.

Tony’s face crumples in sorrow because he
Steve huffed out a cynical laugh as Natasha ducked underneath his arm to reach for a parachute, and adjusted his earpiece, slotting the tiny bud snugly in his ear canal.
Steve huffs out an ugly burst of laughter. He’s perfectly at home in his own skin and the only thing he had ever disliked about himself had been his weakness and propensity for sickness that kept him out of the military before Project Rebirth, but he had no illusions--he wasn’t beautiful, not like Tony is.
Wine had never been so thick, had never stained glass so vibrantly red along the sides.

for more--and then pressed a light kiss Steve’s lips.
Tony is methodically stripping him--his shirt is unbuttoned, his belt unbuckled, and now Tony’s slowly unzipping him. He wants this, but he wants that moment of exhilaration back, that feeling of all-encompassing love and adoration that had enveloped him. He wants to make love to Tony, with Tony, but more than that he wants the words. It’s one thing to know, it’s another thing entirely to hear it.
“You also probably didn’t think I dated men.”

Tony, naked and spread out on the bed, his eyes fluttering closed as he dropped one of those crafty fingers to his dick--Tony was so big, long and thick enough that he was easily able to backup everyone ounce of his swagger and dodge accusations of overcompensation--he would have slowly stroked himself until he was rock hard.
It would have tasted amazing. He can feel his mouth water, just thinking about it. But he knows better than to eat Nothing stays down, and it would have probably been spoiled by now anyway.

“Holy shit, Steve, help a guy out here.”
It was so hot outside. Or was it just him? Maybe it was just him. He was so hot; his skin was flushed and sweaty and his shirt was uncomfortable on his back and sweat beaded his brow and dripped onto the windshield as he thrust as much as Tony would allow him, his intentions utterly derailed once again by this infuriating

When Steve finally releases his bite Tony hunches in on himself, disgusted with his lack of resolve, his inability to halt his almost instinctual fall under Steve’s sway.

He let his eyes drift closed again.
He hears the truth screaming at him, locked away in the darkest recesses of his mind because Tony can’t—
Tony trailed one hand up the buttons of his uniform and grabbed onto his shirt to draw him flush against his body. “Well, hey there.”

Tony wrests his gaze away from the steak, takes in the neat square of salmon tartare topped with red caviar, the red bell pepper ring housing a thick mound of melted red windsor cheese atop a bed of crisp, red slaw.
Tony wet his lips as he stared up at Steve, a gleam in his eye and a smirk tugging at his mouth.
Steve meets him thrust for thrust, and Tony is screaming, can feel his throat burning raw with it, with his sobs as he loses more and more of himself with every piston of his hips.
a friend of sorts.
His unwanted dinner guest smirks, as if fully cognizant of what Tony has done to clear his senses. “Cheater.”
The expression on Stark’s face when he turned to look at him over his shoulder was just this side of hopeful, and honestly the whole situation was just so ridiculous now that Steve couldn’t help the tiny huff of laughter that escaped him. He
The scent of fresh tomato basil soup is gradually overpowered by the stench of decay and blood, by sharp arctic air and sodden grave-dirt.
It was all rapidly becoming too much for him--he’d been right at the edge from the gloriously torturous blow job, and any lost ground from the initial discomfort of being prepped had been overridden by the fact that Tony seemed to be operating under the delusion that fingering him to incoherency was the end game.
“I...we-

“Steve, the second you let go of me you’re turning into a
,” Tony snarled, ripping open one of the condom packets. The noise of the crinkling foil triggered an almost Pavlovian response in Steve, who groaned throatily in anticipation and licked his lips, eyes fluttering closed.
Steve moved backwards with him in order to give him more room, stopping when he was reclining against the veritable wall of pillows, no where else for him to go. Not that he especially wanted to, anyway, what with Tony’s delicious heat over him and sinful promise radiating from his gaze.
Steve tugged his head back. “One day, we’re going to sit down, you and I, and your issues, and we’re going to figure out why you can't see how goddamn wonderful you are.”
, Steve shifted his weight around so that Tony didn’t have to support himself with both hands, and he freed a hand from its death-grip on Steve’s thigh and began to pump his cock in time with Steve’s thrusts, and then Steve’s arm dropped from its hold across his abdomen in order for him to clap a hand over Tony’s and pump with him, and everything was beginning to muddle in his head again until it was just the feeling of Steve around and inside him, an inescapable haze of desire and helpless as he writhed under Steve’s control.
He had always been a sucker for pretty eyes and a bitchy attitude, and those deep blue eyes paired with the pouty frown were a direct challenge, and he was not a man to resist temptation. God, he could fuck that look right off the CHP’s poster boy.

about this as he is just leery of the whole situation. He’s never been the biggest fan of magic in the first place, and the mark on his hand has already proven itself to be erratic. Wanda’s powers are chaos incarnate; this could go very badly for Steve. Steve still hasn’t “woken up” entirely since the park, save for a few brief flashes of emotion, and he shares Wanda and Thor’s fear that any longer in this state will be the end of Steve. This is their best option; Strange is still out of touch, and Amora has continued to elude Thor’s searches.
“You won’t,” Steve whispers into his ear, Tony’s blood on his breath and poisoned honey on his lips, “you cant. You

Tony jolted convulsively against him, harder than he’d ever been in his life and horrified because they were still fully clothed, and he had damn near come in his pants. Holy shit, this wasn’t happening, he was Tony Fucking Stark ™, and

Oh, he’s never been ashamed of his body, never thought he was unattractive or ill-formed, and it’s nice to find out that even though he’s temporarily without the serum, the years of proper medical attention, rich food, and high quality of life that only comes from exposure to luxury (bless you, Tony) is enough that he he’s filled out some and is still quite healthy. But he’s not conventionally attractive. Not like Tony’s usual fare.
He has to untangle one of his hands from Tony’s hair and slap it over his mouth because he’s past all restraint and tolerance, his moans and groans are becoming louder and louder with every desperate gasp of air, and he isn’t going to risk waking the whole mansion, no matter how good Tony swears the soundproofing is.
No, Steve’s here.
“Let me blow you,” Tony demanded, gnawing on his bottom lip as he stared straight at Steve’s crotch. He

, and someone he trusted.
Steve leaned over the front of his motorcycle, idly rocking one leather-booted leg back and forth as he looked up into the night sky and wondered, yet again, what meaning his life had now. There’d been a time, once, when he never expected to make 20, and then, during the war, he’d never expected to see 25. Global scale warfare being what it was, and the Invaders being who they were, any moment might have been their last. He’d thought he’d actually seen the last of his time when he went down in the ocean, but Fate was a cruel and fickle mistress, and he’d been pulled out far into a future he’d never even considered, young and healthy and entirely alone.
Ridiculous. Tony was fiercely intelligent and deeply knowledgeable, but that only went so far. To assume Tony not only knew who the Winter Soldier
“I believe so, shield-brother.” Thor gestures grandly with a strip of bacon, “The Witch is powerful, and when combined with your own current abilities, we can provide some manner of safety for our cursed leader.”
, Tony growling at the stinging burn.
Tony shivered at that, full-bodied and hard, and Steve dropped a hand to his waist to still him.
Tony pulled back and shot a wickedly triumphant grin up at Steve, who was looking dazed and startled, and set back at his task with obscene enthusiasm, unleashing a decade’s worth of carnal prowess that Steve had no other option but to endure.
(He can’t breathe.)
Tony finally released his feet, and when Steve complied with his request to turn back over, he was fully erect and leaking thick trails trails of precome. Tony licked his lips, and Steve jolted with anticipation, knowing that whatever followed next was going to leave him utterly wrung out, and he couldn’t wait. What Tony had done to him,
Frowning, Steve reached into his pocket for it, and returned with a glossy business card. The front said Stark Industries. Steve flipped the card over, and in hasty black cursive was a message. “You know who I am.”  Below that, a phone number.
“Gonna have someone get curious, and boy what a show they’ll get.Think the cops will let us finish before they haul us off to jail?”
The lights were dimmed almost to the point of being entirely turned off, but that didn’t matter because almost twelve candles were spread across the room, the pockets of soft light amplified in the mirrors reflection so that the room fairly glowed. The candles were tall and olive green affairs that filled the entire bathroom with a surprisingly nice blend of eucalyptus, sandalwood, and vanilla that didn’t irritate his nostrils.
“I just think you should be happy.”
Wait, what?
There’s no way Steve’s going to come out of this on top, none at all. Wrecker has an enchanted crowbar that gives him and his cronies superpowers, and Steve’s a

had changed since then.
“Pepper and Rhodey kiss me all the time! You don’t mind that! Why is it Ty gets you so worked up, huh?”
Steve’s next thrust was rougher, and holy shit, he was really plowing into him now, each thrust like a punch that sent liquid heat through his trembling muscles and frissons of ecstasy along his nerves.
Tony grips the Anathema tighter, willing the tremble out of his hand.
Milo arched a brow at Tony’s jab before placing down two bar glasses on Steve’s napkin.

his own meal behind Tony’s back. Then, thanking him effusively for a lovely “date,” Ty had taken his own receipt, tucked it into Tony’s lapel, and playfully stolen a quick kiss before strolling off. It had just been a joke, like the playful smacks Tony gave Rhodey or Bruce, even Pepper, but Steve wouldn’t take it that way.
Besides, this was
It’s wonderful—no! Not wonderful, no, he isn’t supposed to be enjoying this, it’s awful and—and—Tony shudders and rocks against Steve, twisting uselessly against his restraining hands, mouth falling open in a soundless scream as he drowns under a heady whirl of sensation.
The tears came then, burning hot and bitter, but a shadow enveloped him and his head was drawn into deceptively strong arms, a gentle refuge that smelled of cool water and and crisp leaves, and the bergamont in the tea Peggy so jealously hoarded.
“Oh fuck, listen to you, darling, howling my name and begging for it, fucking hell, come on, Sergeant, come on, Steve, I want to feel you break around me, you’re so fucking hot like this, what the hell even are you
That...that...
Steve stares down at Tony, and the mischievously gleaming hint of deep blue beneath barely cracked eyelids. Jesus, that rotten ass pun!
“Oh please. Sharon and I have been split for a long time now, Tony. Pull the other one.”
Jan always did end up on the optimistic side of the scale. Tony’s a realist, though, and he knows how this goes for him. He’ll be lucky if he even has a friendship to salvage with Steve after this all dies down.

Was it a fluke?
The fact that he was effectively silenced only ramped him up more. He

“Cat got your tongue?” Steve’s voice was smug and thick with self-satisfaction as he leaned against the doorframe of Tony’s bedroom, just casually lounging there as if he wasn’t perfectly well aware that Tony’s brain was leaking out from between his ears.
Tony rolled down his window and blinked as those muscled legs filled his view. Where the hell did the highway patrol find this guy? Chippendales? There was some poor revue spot in Vegas missing their headliner.  A moment later and a face like a dream filled his vision. Blond hair, a face that looked like it was chiseled by one of the Italian masters, and a stern frown on lips that were too thick and lush to be good for anything except pouting. Or sucking dick.
and heaves last night’s dinner onto the floor.
Unfortunately, their relationship hadn’t quite recovered from the Mandarin incident, and even though he’d destroyed his suits, the Hydra/SHIELD debacle had wound up dumping a group of displaced Avengers in Tower residence and it drove the final nail home. Pepper loved Tony, but she couldn’t bear the thought of him constantly in danger as Iron Man, and she guessed--rightly--that Tony wouldn’t be able to leave the suits alone or resist joining in on the increasingly dangerous Hydra raids that were being staged by the assembled heroes living below their penthouse, and that was that.
“Uh, Gene Simmons, what is your major malfunction?”
The Time They Had To Deal With The Guy Who Could Control Roaches.
Tony had been so careful--still was, in some ways--and for all Tony loved his carnal indulgences, he’d been very solicitous. Tony also wasn’t stupid. The serum might have been Erskine’s masterwork, but Howard had originally helped with the technical aspects before later replicating it himself decades later. For all Tony claimed to have begged for scraps of Howard’s affection, he had made it clear that his father never once denied his son any iota of knowledge. Tony, he suspected, knew exactly what Steve was going through, but he hadn’t yet worked his way to laying it out in the open.
Steve tried to speak, made a noise that might have been please, might have been more, but was honestly just a horny garble of need as Tony continued his foot massage.
(He can’t breathe.)
It was a longshot, but the glimmer of hope remained within his mind, a frail desperate thing, really. How was he supposed to choose between Bucky and Tony? Steve closed his eyes, resting his head against Tony’s arc reactor.
all of that and had gloated about it. He’d rubbed that fact in with Obadiah--who’d ignored Ty entirely but taken it out on Tony’s hide--and later with Pepper, who cut her teeth daily on bigger and badder men than Tiberius Stone, and verbally flayed him alive. Ty had attempted the same with Steve, who had eventually snapped and laid him out with a beauty of a right hook in a private side-room confrontation at a charity dinner, before snapping at Tony that Ty didn’t get to touch him and dragging him off to an out-of-the-way closet like a caveman. It had been a
Tony handed both over, rolling his eyes as the patrol officer shone the light straight into the car and almost directly into his eyes.
When Steve finally broke off the kiss, Tony stared up at him dazedly, pupils blown with lust. “Fuck it, I’ll call the suit inste--”
“Dammit, Nat!”
Tony’s hands aren’t clean. He’s killed before, both on purpose and accidentally. This though...this isn’t weapons he designed in the wrong hands, or literally battling his way out of a cave for his survival. This isn’t fighting off an invading alien army or dealing with murderous Hydra agents. This is Tony, deliberately deciding to

“So old fashioned.”

Shit! Too close!
He darted the tip of his tongue out, wetting his lips, and watched Tony fixate on the tiny motion, eyes near black with intensity, felt Tony’s cock twitch sharply in his hands. Tony’s mouth fell open and Steve quickly swallowed down his guttural moan with a kiss, chasing the traces of aged scotch and spiced apple from one of the cider chasers Tony had stolen from him on a whim.
Maybe it’s the lack of serum? It hurts, to think that Tony could be so shallow, but he’d be lying if he didn’t admit that he’s no great prize like this.
There’s a soft mutter from Tony about how Steve had literally climbed him like a tree half an hour ago but
Steve had been hurt, could have been killed, and that was all Tony could see--a thousand what-ifs, and no consideration for what actually was. Steve was alive and mostly well--would be just fine once the serum did its trick-- but all Tony could see was the grim alternative. He was stuck on it.
Steve obliged Tony’s demand, and was rewarded by him yanking his head down by the dog tags and smashing their lips together in a heated kiss, wild and messy, full of tongue and playful nips at his lips. .
his nipple, the soft and moist heat almost too much to take as it sent constant bursts of pleasure radiating out from it and down through his body and straight through his erection like a livewire. Tony continued to mouth at the pert nub as he trailed his other hand up to flick and stroke over the other.
Natasha would know that he was interested in Tony, not that he’d managed to get anywhere worthwhile with the man, and of course she would throw him right into Tony’s path.
He tries to wriggle free, writhing in Steve’s grasp as he deepens the kiss, rebelling even as he kisses him back, greedily stealing bits of a moment he can’t keep as he fights a losing battle to keep his wits about him—he lost this battle a long time ago he thinks—and his lungs are burning and his pulse is racing and he feels like he’s falling, floating, slipping away,
was pissed about it.
Thankfully, Tony had stayed behind, citing conflicting obligations with Stark Industries, so it wasn’t like Tony was primed and ready to go fresh out the armor. He wouldn’t have to disappoint Tony this time.
Oh...oh no...
Steve groaned as the vibrations slowed down to something a bit more manageable, overwrought and drained and apprehensive as a curl of demanding need wound through him, his body beginning to yearn for more.
Poor Steve. He sounds nothing so much as just plain
“I promise you, I'm sober, officer. My consent for a full-body search is both enthusiastic and contingent upon you doing a thorough job of it.”
“I know that! Look, it wasn’t, I mean..okay...just...Buck and I never...we were too close. He was like my brother.”
Blood.
come!” Thor bursts into the room, Mjolnir raised for battle, and stumbles to a halt, a sleepily befuddled expression on his face. “There is no battle?”
“You're the GOAT, Steve.”
A fly buzzes in the background, the pitched drone of flight traversing the room with startling speed, first in the far corner, over towards the stagnant fountain water, then irritatingly close to the table. Tony shoos it away, breaks his gaze for a moment to make sure it’s gone.
How the hell did it get down there?
This blind date was a setup, and he honestly didn’t know why he expected any better from Natasha.
He needs to leave.
Tony gulped, a mixture of dread and anticipation crossing his face as Steve hovered just out the edges of Tony’s line of sight. It was not, Steve mused, entirely unlike what a horror movie victim probably felt seconds before the killer struck. Or, in this case, the horny, frustrated, super-soldier who was about to get a little of his own back.
Steve didn’t doubt it. “Look, Tony, this is serious. I can’t have this getting out. I’d be out on my ass.” If not worse. Retired or no, he was Captain America, and that came with a heavy burden of responsibility that he’d never be entirely free of. This one time was too dangerous in and of itself.

Thor is not without moments of gravitas, and he looks each of them straight on in the eye, as if he can impress upon them his intended lesson by sheer force of will. If anyone can pull it off, it’s Thor.
“Love is one of the most powerful goads in existence, a potent magic all its own, and nothing is more intense than what True Love manifests in its protection. Too late, and to their sorrow do those who would hinder it learn their fate.”
For a brief moment, Steve was reminded of Namor, and the ability he had to make someone like and hate him all in one go. Too often, he’d heard people go on about “that damn Namor”, unable to comprehend how they always ended up keeping him around and even enjoying his presence, but as soon as he was gone sanity returned and they could quite cheerfully strangle him.
“I know all too well how quickly things get out of control when rumor and hearsay get involved. I can be discreet.”
He’s got business to tend to. He’s rested, ready, and determined.
The result...the result they’d met in the Latverian wilds.
“So.Friday night.”
Steve could have told them otherwise.
Which meant that Steve couldn’t move at all now without either causing a disaster or ripping his pants apart, and there was no way he was near strong enough to do that. The poor sucker was entirely at Tony’s mercy, and that was just how he wanted it.
ended up claiming his mother instead. The instances where he was relatively fine were so incredibly outnumbered by the constant deluge of physical miseries that each one stood out as a particularly shiny jewel of a memory.
Steve snorted. “Captain America was trapped in the Rhineland, battle stressed, had never touched a man or woman in his life, and hadn’t figured out he had any kind of a chance with Peggy Carter. A

Oh dammit, that meant cock rings.
Oh for God’s sake...
Jan blithely steamrolls over Tony’s horrified outburst. “It’s so sweet to see you guys finally together, though! We thought you were going to dance around each other until the world ends!”
Steve hadn’t felt quite this miserable since the days of World War II, and all he wanted was a too long shower, and maybe a rub down with that BioFreeze Tony kept stashed before he crawled into bed. Steve felt a little guilty. Tony was always so keyed up after combat, but he was always in so much pain he had little to no energy to attempt anything, and more often than not after a mission--after he’d showered and crawled into bed and tried to will as much numbness up as he could--Tony would eventually slip away into the bathroom and take care of himself before returning to cuddle up against Steve and drift off to sleep. It wasn’t even like Tony

“Shh. It’ll happen if it happens, but don’t worry about it,” Tony murmured in his ear as he moved from his back to his left arm.
“Sooo...fancy meeting you here.”
He was covered in a rather alarming amount of bite marks and bruises, and he could feel a set of scratches burning warmly on his back that undoubtedly matched up with the (desperately in need of maintenance) nails of one Anthony Edward Stark. Steve had been well-fed and then well-fucked, and now, deep in the afterglow, he took a moment to mentally reflect on his triumph.
Tony threw his hands up in disgust, and turned away to gaze out the window at the Manhattan skyline. Steve said nothing, not really having any ready justifications. He was of a mind to just let Tony have a moment to chew through his feelings. Tony was a mess of emotions, but he liked to deal with them on his own terms instead of leaving himself raw and exposed to the world.
He’s not strong enough for that. Not yet.
Steve shuddered at the loaded phrasing and complied, kissing Tony for all he was worth.
The restraint on his left wrist began to give way and tear, and a curl of triumph wound through Steve. Just a little more, and then he was going to tackle Tony and make the jerk fuck him properly, and maybe twice because he was damn well
Or at least, Steve hadn’t figured it out if Tony
“To arms, comrades! We are besieged by forsaken spirits! The
Tony leaned into the kiss, moaning raggedly as he rutted against Steve’s thigh, holding his pants up with his free hand, thrilling in the last traces of aftershocks. Ever helpful, Steve dropped Tony’s tie and released him from the kiss, tucking Tony neatly back inside his pants and zipping them up. An idle thought crossed his mind about where the condom went, but Steve almost instantly decided he really didn’t want to know. Tony began to stoop down and search for Steve’s boot, return the favor, but Steve intercepted him with a hot and heavy kiss, as he pulled his uniform pants back up.
“I’m old enough to be her dad.”
if given even half a chance.
Steve tried to peer back at his lover, but the angle was all wrong, and Tony pressed his head back down into the pillows. “Relax, Steve. I’ll get my own, trust me, but I’m not quite done with you yet.”
Steve glared at the sky, even though the Quinjet was not visible. “Comms going dark.”
There’s no stopping the quaking moans and shudders as Steve drinks deeply, guzzling more and more of his blood, velvet curls of poisonous delight and liquid heat winding slowly through his veins from the mess of endorphins and venom playing havoc with his overwhelmed senses. Steve’s equally gone on it all, slurping and sucking and lapping at the wound he’s created, slaking his thirst with fixed determination.
“Now—” Steve’s hand trails up his cheek to grab a thick handful of his hair and yank his head down, “put your back into it, Avenger.”
He hasn’t had a decent lungful of air in what seems like
“You’re going to come as much as you want, and then you’re going to sleep…”
“I’ll call you with the details. Answer your phone, or I’ll give that old grandma who hangs out at the lobby coffee shop your phone number. She swears she was your number one fan back in the day. ”
His craft room, however?
to hear it, but he’s not sure it’s the same for him.
28 but really 94, and all the people he’d known and loved were dead, dying, or kidnapped by Hydra, the world was exactly the same in all the wrong ways, yet new enough to leave him reeling at the unfamiliarity of everything around him, and he just couldn’t seem to find neither the will nor the way to make a space for himself.
Tony let out a startled yelp as he was tackled by Steve, the controller to the vibrating plug clattering to the floor as they went down on the bed in a tangle of limbs. They rolled, and Steve moved quickly, slipping on a cuff before Tony could get his bearings straight. The second followed soon after, though it took some finagling to make it hold tight enough given that Steve had all but ripped it in half.
leaving his tsum outside in the rented sports car while he and Natalie mixed and mingled with the guests at Obadiah Stane’s private auction.
Tony is relieved and hates himself for it.
they had told Steve as much, and Steve had apparently drunk the Kool-Aid, because he seemed to see Ty as a threat to everything--to their relationship, to their friends, to Tony
Tony glared at him disbelievingly. “Captain America is full of shit.”
as Tony put just enough pressure on his prostate to send him spiraling over the edge into an orgasm.
“Black tourmaline. It removes negative energies and repels psychic and negative energy attacks. It’s useful for removing curses. That’s for Steve. Your circle is there.”
Steve pushed back and up into Tony, urging the man on as he rocked against him, enjoying the sharper-edged pleasure in the wake of his orgasm. The serum meant he could--and usually would--go off twice in a row, and the second one was always so intense. Great sex had already redeemed the day in his eyes, but the sudden chance to serve Tony back some of his own was the cherry on top. “Sure. Think you can do better than your driving and not come too fast?”
Fuck off, Howard.
fucked, and shit, Steve was barely even registering any of it because Tony hadn’t. Fucking. Stopped.
love in some part, no matter who was in the picture. There was history there that Steve would never touch, and Tony supposed it drove him up the wall.
When Tony finally came back to himself, Steve was idly running a hand through his hair and frowning at the mess all over Tony’s pants, which had been too close to ground zero to avoid the inevitable splash of Tony’s own release.
. Steve needs a bath, Clint has skills. They can get some soap, hose him down in the backyard, and call it a day.
A thousand times he’s done this; when he was stressed, when he was angry, when he fought with Howard and came out the worse for wear, when things just never seemed to go the way he wanted. Same as then, his mother shushes him and plays with the curls of his hair, let’s him have a moment to wallow and regroup before patting his cheek. Her signal that the moment was over.
Steve nuzzles the side of Tony’s cheek, reveling in the contrast of smooth skin and soft facial hair, basking in the woodsy tobacco and smoked vanilla scent of his aftershave. Tony always smells so nice. Tony hisses and kneads at where he’s gripping Steve’s thighs, tilts his neck so Steve can have better access.
[[I mean, I’m glad to see the backstabbing fucker go down, but I feel compelled to remind you both this is a recon mission, not a murder-Nazis-and-drag-Rumlow-off-into-the-vengeful-dark type of mission.]]
write me a ticket.” Stark agreed, his voice a mischievous pur. “But I’m rich, you wouldn’t even put a dent in my bank account. Or, I can pay for this some other way and you could really make sure I… learn my lesson?”
Steve didn't know if it was the car, the man, or the insanely lethal combination of both that did it for him, but whatever it was left him repressing a full body shudder as all his senses clicked over to ‘Oh. Hell. Yes.’
Tony barely has a chance to register horror before Steve’s fist smashes into his face.
Goats are lawless creatures, put forth on the earth with disaster in their hearts and ruin in their gaze.
“It’s got what, 90 rooms? I’ve got reason to be.”
This is...Steve’s the wimpiest looking goat he’s ever seen. Not quite malnourished, but…wow. Definitely not the goat he was yesterday.
Natasha snapped an ammo clip into her gun and holstered it before giving him truly spectacular side-eye.
Tony’s attention had turned to his thighs and on down to his legs, and Steve just let himself float off, groaning and rumbling and purring in the back of his throat as Tony worked over him, the massage gel counteracting the initial discomfort and then magnifying the pleasurable relief he felt by warming him from what felt like inside out.
“Steve, Stevie, what the fuck?” Tony’s expression was mystified. “I...holy shit I think I’m jealous, no I know I am, what the hell did they
“Steve…”
Steve’s third orgasm of the day sizzled up and down his spine before breaking over him, and Tony twisted and undulated as Steve pulsed deep inside him, tensing and straining and desperately pleading for Steve to finish him, and god, how could he refuse him? Tony had thrown himself so thoroughly into tending to Steve’s every whim,
It was all too much, the spray of the hot water, the slow teasing and the intense pleasure roiling through him, and Steve rutted against Tony’s hip as he urged him backwards until they hit the wall. Tony wrapped one arm around Steve’s neck and tugged him down into a filthy kiss while his other hand wrapped lightly around his erection.
“I’m just saying! What, do you want me to ignore that Cap looks like he weighs a buck twenty-five?!” Clint defends himself, looking indignantly around the cluster of Avengers.
“There was this guy Arnie back in the old neighborhood, though. Had some good times with him."
A throbbing, pulsing warmth goes through him as Tony eases up on his thighs enough that he can thrust up a little, a little more, and Steve lets himself sink down into the mound of pillows at his back, both of his hands now gripping massive handfuls of Tony’s sheets as he moans brokenly and begins to thrust upwards, fucking Tony’s mouth with abandon.
The resentment comes easily enough. Thor left him behind—he took Natasha and Clint, but not him—Bruce
“I should arrest you.”
little revelation he tucked away for later use.
for the amulet, but Clint had quickly filched it and started the most high-stakes game of keep-away Steve’s ever had the (mis)fortune of being involved in.
“Steve?” His voice comes out slow and wary, the ache in his stomach back and almost forcing him to double over, it’s so strong…
Steve very kindly did not point out that Sam was full of it and obviously merely dipping out on a potentially nasty confrontation. He didn’t even really blame him, to be fair.
“Our Captain should be most grievously injured, if not dead, yet he remains whole. And how? You disdain the mystic arts, Man of Iron, and should not have been able to intercede. But whilst you were unable to stave off Amora’s foul hex, you didst leap to our leader’s aid. Mystical energy is not created or destroyed. It transforms, transfers if needs must, and like has always called to like. With its shell destroyed, it sought the nearest conduit of like power.”
sounds fantastic.”
Not even a minute in, and he’d managed to insult the guy so bad he was about to pretend like he wasn’t even there for a date and just so happened to be in the area for coffee he hated.
Steve had the feeling he might actually be in trouble because he had a type, and gorgeous and feisty was it.
There was no staving this one off as every ounce of the pleasure buzzing in his veins, (along his nerves, deep in his muscles, all throughout his body,) was drawn towards his groin, rocketing towards the point of no return.
You’re going to fuck me properly until I’ve gotten this damn
“Will you at least get laid?”
set all this up?”
Sonuvabitch...
“Steve, what--why would you
Blessedly, Tony finally shifted angle enough that his next thrust landed firm against Steve’s prostate and there was no keeping back the over-wrought cry that ripped out of his throat as his body sang electric and he tried to jolt straight out of his own skin.
