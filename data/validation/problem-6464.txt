Steve watched Bruce as he got to work on examining Tony. Bruce put his ear up to where Tony’s heart would be, stretched out his limbs, and looked inside his mouth. So far, Bruce doesn’t notice anything wrong but he decided to one more test that’s usually for Omegas only to make sure he can diagnose Tony’s condition. Bruce puts his hand on Tony’s belly where his womb would be and presses down. As a response to this, Tony let out a whine and tried to curl up into a ball. Bruce put his ear to Tony’s womb and felt confident with his findings.
“This Omega is protected. Back the FUCK OFF!” snarled the golden Alpha as blood ran from his mouth. Tony looked up and saw that the darker Alpha had a large bite wound on his shoulder and was panting heavily. The golden Alpha appeared completely unharmed,
“Steve, I don’t want Howard to take me back.” Tony said while sobbing as he looked at Steve in the eyes.
But it wasn’t all arguments, especially once they were able to talk through their problems. There was also wedding planning to be done.
Not even 2 minutes later, Anthony and Pepper come through the door of the villa and Maria sees the two.
“What? You had a viewing party? You’ve got to be kidding, Mom! I’m going to die!” Anthony then shook off what his mother told him over the phone.
The pack found another not-so rundown hotel and that’s where they stayed for the night. Steve shifted out of his wolf form and changed into his pajamas and got under the covers. Tony jumped right onto the side of the bed that Steve wasn’t using and laid down. Before he turned off the lamp, Steve sat on the bed while still under the covers and rubbed Tony’s big belly. Steve was in heaven knowing that he felt his pups and he’ll be able to see them soon. He put his ear to Tony’s belly and could hear his pups moving around inside and planted a kiss on Tony's belly. Steve also looked at how big Tony’s nipples are getting which tells him that there will be plenty of milk for their pups to drink and couldn’t wait to see what they’ll look like in human form.
“Alright, here I go,” Tony whispers before stripping down and shifting into his wolf form. Tony, in his wolf form, was mainly brown with a white belly and white muzzle. After he shifted, everyone else gathered around him to sniff him. Now they recognized Tony as one of them.
“Hey, Stark!” said a voice from behind Anthony which was Harold “Happy” Hogan, one of the announcers for the Grand Prix Final.
Steve twirled the engagement ring around his finger with his thumb. Their first contact in two years. It seemed like a lifetime ago.
Tony then turned around to walk over to the desk to get a sip of the coffee that Steve brought for him. After having a drink, Tony sat the cup back down and Steve saw a few drops of the coffee dribble down his chin before Tony got a towel and wiped his mouth clean.
Shadows: It’s the last chapter! I can’t believe it! It’s been a wild ride and Emmie did a great job with this chapter. We’ll see y’all at the end!
“But Steve, I’m not going to sit around and pray that you’ll win the fight like a piece of cake. I want to go fight with you.”
Not long after, Steve can spot something coming into view from a distance. He sees 5 figures coming from the distance on horses. Steve signaled for his council to follow him as they move towards the figures coming their way.
Emmie: Here’s a new chapter to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of Endgame. We all need something to keep us happy after that movie.
Steve reached over to one of the dressers by the bed and pulled out a bottle of oil. He opened it and poured a little on his hands before rubbing it on his penis.
I apologize for nothing new as I got a job and it's been taking me away from writing since I like to have a lot of personal time to write so I can put out the best stuff I can write. Also writing down from the subtitles of each episode is hard so if there's an easier way of finding where to look and transcripts of each episode of Yuri on Ice, that would be really helpful.
Shadows: Well, this is the end. It’s been quite the journey. I’m really happy with how this turned out. It was a pleasure working with Emmie throughout this. I hope you all enjoyed this little story of ours. Drop us a comment and keep an eye out for any of our future works! I know I’ve got a few going! Thank you for reading!!!
Steven gets up and out of the pool and Anthony sees that he’s TOTALLY SO NOT NAKED right in front of him.
After wandering for 5-10 minutes, Tony was nearing a clearing in which there was an open area and near one of the sides of the Rocky Mountains. As Tony takes in the sight of the area, he hears a howl coming from the side of the Rockies nearby. He knew it couldn’t have been Rhodey, Pepper, or Happy so he turned around and looked up at the side of the Rockies.
Neither noticed it, but everyone else had left the room with smiles on their faces. This was joyous news, but they could all celebrate later. Right now was for Tony and Steve.
“Sounds like a wonderful idea.” Steve then wrote down the suggestion on the paper. “We have to think about what food to serve. Of course there will be raw meat and blood but what suggestions do you have for food and drinks to be served?”
“Hey everyone,” called a voice, as the kid from Queens that Tony had recruited lowered himself down from the ceiling. “I’m Spider-man, in case anyone forgot.”
“Dearest Anthony I chose you because when I smelled the scent of your blood last night, it smelled like sweet cinnamon and pine. It was like an intoxication that I couldn’t resist. When you are crowned queen, we will be ruling as equals.”
The citizens of the Hydra kingdom have stopped in certain spots and looking at pieces of paper that are posted in shop windows and in the paper that circulates in the kingdom. They are reading an announcement from the king that reads:
Pretty soon, Steve arrived in the lab with a cup of coffee for Tony as sort of a peacemaking gift while everyone worked around the clock to prepare for the fateful day.
As much as Tony wanted to keep his eyes closed, to just drift off and never wake up, something was calling to him. He blearily opened his eyes and saw a few blurry patches of brown, grey, and red reflecting off the snow. A deep howl cut through the air and it made Tony’s frozen ears twitch. He tried to focus as the figures got closer, but he found that he just couldn’t. Just trying to move was using too much energy. It was useless to try and answer. The figures were probably just hallucinations made up by his frost ridden mind.
“Ok, “Me, Tarzan, You, Bitch.”” says Happy as he read the first white card which IMMEDIATELY brings laughter among everyone. “Me, Tarzan, You, A bag of cats.” says Happy as he read the next white card which brings out a little laugh among them. “Me, Tarzan, You, A sad fat dragon with no friends.” says Happy as he read the last white card which brings out more laughter than the last card but not as much as the first card.
With Howard as head of the pack, he was the one to make the rules. He was the one to bring forth his prejudice against Omegas. He was the one who made Tony’s life a living hell for the first 20 odd years of his life. Tony tried his best to win his father’s approval but with the hatred of Omegas that Howard has, that wouldn’t be happening. Tony would be the last person that would get anything in the pack and the other members made his life miserable.
Tony hadn’t mentioned the ring again since he first noticed it, but Steve caught him continuing to glance at it. Whether that meant Tony was considering his feelings for Steve or working up the courage to ask for it back, Steve couldn’t tell. He knew Tony wasn’t totally relaxed around him yet, despite their earlier shenanigans in Shuri's lab, however Tony’s somewhat friendlier attitude toward him since discovering the ring gave him hope.
Tony did as instructed and gave his outfit over to Steve. The healer moved over to Tony’s left shoulder and made a small incision in the skin. Tony winced at the feeling of the healer cutting into his skin and held onto Steve’s hand. After letting the wound bleed for a little bit, the healer collects a decent amount of it into a small dish with a small brush.
“Don’t worry my dear, I’ll protect you in every way that I can. I love you so much and now that you are pregnant, there’s nothing more important than you and our future child.”
“Steve, I’m not sorry about leaving. I was worried about you and it turns out I was right and I’m happy I saved your life.”
“It is difficult to put into words,” Thor responded. “Simply that you have a certain…quality about you that makes you the perfect choice.”
“Pietro made fun of River about how he was landing his jump in pole vault and Wanda insulted the painting Rowan made of us all together,” Sparrow spoke.
His eyes felt heavy and watched Steve sit above him before leaning down to say against his ear in a whisper “You’ve made me very happy dear, I’ll see you when you wake up.” before he couldn’t keep them open any longer and felt his vision fade into darkness.
“Look, Anthony. I’m really sorry. Cassie uploaded it and it’s gone viral.” Scott told him over the phone while Hope is being upset with Cassie in the other room.
After the golden wolf said that, the Alpha who was harassing Tony walked off and they don’t see him anymore.
Tony, however, was feeling scared but also happy. He was...he was pregnant. He was going to be a mother.
“Steve, it’s urgent. We need to meet in the council chambers with you and Tony urgently.” Bucky spoke before they all left for said destination.
Howard lunges at Tony and grabs his arm. “Yes you are Anthony, you are coming back home and you will be married off to someone who will make you useful for once.”
Steve moved his hands to the straps of Anthony’s dress and started to pull them down slowly from his shoulders. He continued to pull it down to where it’s at Anthony’s waist. Steve then moves his lips to rest on Anthony’s neck. He breathes, nips, and licks it which makes Anthony let out a sweet and soft moan. Steve took note of what he just heard and chose to move the dress even lower which exposed Anthony’s ass. He then moved his hands to grab a hold of Anthony’s ass. As soon as Steve put his hands on Anthony’s ass, his mind went
“Sorry. I wanted to get some practice in.” Tony said as he’s heading off for the local ice rink run by the Lang/Van Dyne family.
“Stay still for this part.” said the healer as he dipped the brush into the blood and began to draw the symbols on Tony’s stomach. It only took a few minutes for the healer to draw the symbols on Tony’s stomach. The healer started to chant in the same strange language that Steve used when he healed his injuries a few months back. After a minute passed, the blood turned to a black color. The healer smiled at the result and looked up to Steve and Tony.
“Good day my cabinet, there is some important news that I have to tell you all. Dear Tony is pregnant and the kingdom must know of the delightful news.” Steve spoke as he looked at every member of the table. “There will need to be a notice posted to the public in the following weeks. Everyone must know the news. Plaster it all across the kingdom in papers and shop windows.”
“Sorry, we’re closed. You can come back tomorrow.” said Hope Van Dyne who was putting away some ice skates.
"What?" It had been a few weeks, and the Avengers and rogue Avengers had been working at cleanup in Wakanda. Steve thought that they had been making progress at getting back together, especially after their escapade from a few nights ago, but now Tony wanted the ring back?
But if Howard had his way that would never happen. In the middle of the night, Tony shifted into his wolf form and disappeared from the house in the blizzard coming down. With the heavy snow and winds, Tony tried his best to navigate the terrain but it was getting difficult. He was also starting to get hungry. But hunger wasn’t new to Tony. He’d know it his whole life, so he continued to trudge on.
Emmie: I hope you guys will enjoy this chapter that Shadow did. It’s really fun to work on this fic with him.
“I’m sorry, Tony, it’s just that it’s been so long since I’ve seen you, and this is way too reminiscent of me coming to visit you in the lab and-“ His words were cut off by another mouth against his. Tony was there kissing him. Steve returned it as much as he dared.
Emmie: BOY was this a difficult chapter to do. I had to do SO MUCH research for immersion therapy and at-home water birth. I hope it is accurate to how they’re actually done. Thanks and have a good read guys.
“With his fifth consecutive gold in the World Skating Championships, Steven Rogers has made history here tonight!” Happy said.
“You got something in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?” Tony asked, in a neutral tone that Steve couldn’t figure out. Nevertheless, Steve looked away as he felt his face heat up in embarrassment.
“Steve, I care about you and I was worried about you and couldn’t bear to wonder what might happen to you.”
Having jobs kept the pack busy and satisfied. But even though everyone was busy, Tony and Steve still noticed that there was something going on with their pups.
As soon as Tony ended Howard, everyone stared in shock and that gave Steve’s army renewed energy and the rest of King Howard’s army was slaughtered with ease.
Steve’s emotions were too strong for him to speak as he watched Tony slide the ring back on his finger. Tony stood up and brought Steve in for a kiss. The kisses became more fervent, and soon Tony’s mouth was all over Steve’s face and neck.
“So it will be that way.” Steve says as he turned around with his council as King Howard did the same.
“I was, but it turns out that being depressed gets pretty old after a while. I lost my love for skating and I wanted it back. I thought if I copied Steve like we did in the old days, it would help. Hope. I’ve been thinking...“
“Hi Sarah,” Steve said as he looked at the newborn in his arms. She had blue eyes and a small tuft of blond hair. “Oh.” Steve breathed out.
As they got closer, Steve could see that it’s King Howard and his men. It doesn’t take long for both groups to come face to face.
After a crushing defeat at the Grand Prix Final in Sochi, Italian skater Anthony Stark decides to go home and debate if he wants to continue skating in the future. After being recorded doing the Grand Prix Final routine of his idol, 5-time consecutive gold medal winner Irish skater Steven Rogers, Anthony's skills reached worldwide and even inspired his idol to come and be his coach for the next season.
When the time came for their daughters to be born, Steve was with Tony every step of the way. He encouraged Tony throughout his labor and did his best to keep him calm. He was glad for the serum, which allowed Tony to squeeze Steve’s hand as hard as he wanted while he pushed, without risking hurting him. At the end of it, one child was placed in Tony’s arms and one in Steve’s. Both of them were in awe of what Tony had just done. Whether it was the Asgardian magic or not, Steve didn’t know, but they weren’t identical. The baby Tony held had big brown eyes and already had a full head of dark brown hair. “Hey Morgan,” Tony said, tired but happy.
Tony shrugged. “Well, Peter was already a good kid when I met him. That’s a little different than raising a kid from a younger age.”
"You've kept that on for two years, even though there was almost no chance of us getting back together?"
“Roses, carnations, and baby’s breath. There should be black and red roses, Baby’s breath should be white, and we should have red, white, and black carnations.”
After they all clean up the dining room, the 4 wolves gather in the living room for some downtime after their meal. They seated themselves in chairs in a circle around a table and started playing a few card games like UNO & Cards Against Humanity.
The team had also tried getting in from the outside, maybe shatter a window or two and fly in. Only problem with that was that Steve's floor didn't have any external windows the same way everyone else's did, only panels so it wasn't a random floor with no windows. Tony had designed it deliberately that way as he didn't think the 1940's Man would appreciate such a skyline, but
to tell the team that he'd tried, that he initially told Steve 'no'. That wasn't exactly how it went though.
"Green." Steve assured, wandering what he planned to do with the flannel, he would ask but that wasn't his place, he answered questions, never asked outright.
"I... Thought that they were quite close, and that, while they have conflicting personalities, they should still be together." Steve said, feigning knowledge of the subject. Poorly, apparently as Tony burst out laughing, having to pull his knees up in a ball as he held his stomach and gasped for air.
"What's the matter, how is he...? Christ, Tony, are you okay?" Bruce implored, seeing Tony's jittery movements.
Bucky didn’t need anything more than that before he was pushing himself up out of the chair. He stumbled to one side because of how off balance he was without the weight of his arm. But he was able to fix it easily enough. He carefully wandered out of the elevator and in the direction Clint had gone, having to hold one arm out and use the wall to lean on slightly.
Tony sighed, "okay, but I have to come with you" he reasoned, earning a bright grin from Steve. He had been itching to get back to his own space, stock up on pencils and collect all his old sketches so he could organise them. And now give Tony the few he'd drawn of the iron man suit. It was a hard model, many intricate details, difficult shading and reflection; it provided a challenge for Steve, one he enjoyed taking on.
Deciding it was best to stay quiet, and not piss the guy off any more than he clearly already had, Bucky simply nodded. The smaller woman frowned at bucket man and then at Bucky, walking forwards until she was about an arm's-reach away. The guy's glare became harder, more threatening. It was obvious that there was something between them.
"Okay, this is gonna be worse, you might wanna hold onto something..." Steve cautioned, sounding very guilty indeed. Tony did just that, grabbing onto the first thing he could see: Steve. Luckily the man in question didn't comment and just got to work. The pad was lifted and then Steve's fingers were pinching the skin together. If that wasn't bad enough, he began to feel a burning sensation across what he could only assume was the wound.
"Once we're done here, im gonna take you to my floor, and get Bruce to take a look at you. JARVIS will be able to give initial readings but Bruce has a PhD, he understands humans better. Speaking of, how did you know how to disconnect JARVIS?" He asked conversationally, his heart warming at the sketch of him working, blow torch in hand and wielding mask on his head but not over his face, it was surprisingly accurate.
The man came to a halt by a sofa, raising an eyebrow skeptically. "Sure you do, where do you really live?" He demanded, getting a little less soft thinking that Tony was toying with him. In response, he held out the water and lifted his chin, challenging Tony to come and get it himself.
Stave shrugged a shoulder, placing another Peggy sketch in its designated place. "I figured he wasn't installed by magic, there had to be wires or something somewhere, kinda got lucky. Don't ask about the door." He requested quietly, blushing a little.
. We're going to go and find our resident doctor so he can check your arm, it has to be causing you pain,”
Bucky’s attention was immediately drawn back to Bruce, his eyes wider and more vulnerable than before. The man was leaning forward now, elbows on his knees. Bucky couldn’t help the flinch, briefly seeing Pierce’s body in front of him.
“I’m going to wash your arm now.” She eventually informed him, moving on the edge of the tub to get better access. It was quicker here, she wasn’t as careful because she could see his face and would be able to tell if he was hurt or scared. he moved where she wanted him and felt more relaxed and less like the assassin the cleaner he became.
Sam snorted, stealing the pastry out of the archers hand. "Who cares, the thunder God brought us food from France, still warm. Steve, you gotta try this." He laughed, setting another plate out and holding food out of Clint's reach.
Steve swallowed and looked back at Tony with worried eyes, this was gonna be the death of him, Steve was beautiful, even when he was run down, skinny and had bags under his eyes.
The rest of the place was like an average basement, albeit an oversized basement; minimal lighting, the smell of fuel and fumes, some tyre tracks littered the floor and the ceiling had the odd crack. But there was nothing obviously threatening that gave Bucky reason to be concerned.
“Your cat? You have a cat?” he asked, slightly bewildered and clearly tired. “We found you in an alley, there was no cat.” He told him, in case he needed the reminder.
"I've only been awake around half an hour." He spoke around a yawn, rubbing his eyes in a way that gave him a childlike cuteness. "You finish my sketch yet?" He asked, sounding a little bored, but his eyes betrayed the excitement he was clearly feeling so Steve didn't comment.
Natalia made it sound like he had a choice, which maybe he did but he wasn't about to decline the offer, that would be rude. Also, he might get the chance to apologise, he might bump into Steve and...
The journey back to the tower had been a long one, even by Tony's standards. Over Steve's shoulder, Clint appeared, slowing to a stop about 30 feet away. He waited until he heard Steve's cries subside before holding up keys and jerking his head toward the street. Clint kept a weary eye on the two of them while Tony struggled to pull Steve to his feet.
That had been the teams first cause for worry - when the most technologically stunted member of the team outsmarted the only fully functional artificial intelligence in existence. Naturally the team blamed Tony, even though this time it was technically his fault. The rule was:
“James…?” Natalia brought him out of his head and back to reality, “We also don’t stand in a bath. That’s what showers are for. Would you prefer a shower?” She asked kindly, giving him the options he was never allowed before. Cleaning wasn’t something to be enjoyed, cold water and scrubbing was all he was allowed.
Natalia approached slowly, a bottle of water and a boxed sandwich in her hands. Glancing behind her, Bucky could see that Clint had a wash kit, a towel and some clothes tucked under his arm. They both wore the same expression on their face, slightly confused, more concerned and looking a little accusatory towards Bucky.
“Uh huh, and roughly how long will that take? Because I don’t know how long we can keep this hidden from Steve.” That was the guy from before, the one who sat in weird places.
“I’m going to get the supplies, see if you can rouse him, I’m not about to do things without his consent.” Well, that was new, he’d never been offered consent before.
Tony leaned up, curling his hand around Steve's neck, beard brushing his jaw as he nibbled Steve's earlobe. "The wall even has foam cushioning on it behind the bed, I know how much you hate disturbing the neighbours..." He whispered, making Steve groan and rub his hips up against Tony's. Bucky was kind enough to go out for the night whenever Steve had someone round in the past, and visa versa. So since they moved into the tower, the two friends thought it would be okay to be as loud as they liked, until a very disgruntled, grumpy and tired looking Bucky barged in on Tony pounding Steve into the mattress (and the bed into the wall) complaining about the noise. Steve had never been more embarrassed, and they promptly switched rooms and added soundproofing. Tony had begun to suck on Steve's neck, bringing him back to the present and making him realise they were out in public.
Steve would have believed them more if he'd heard them talk more, in the space of nearly 5 hours, there had been very little communication. The only conversations happening between films or during breaks, and they were usually centred around the plot anyway. Either that or he had been too engrossed in his art to notice. Unfortunately for Steve it was probably the latter.
"Shouldn't be too much longer, ask again once the next films done." He suggested, managing to get a grateful smile from Tony.
"I'm sorry, sorry. I should have warned you. Can you just hold that to your head? Im gonna grab a first aid kit." Steve shuffled back and waited until he was sure Tony could support himself. He rushed off into some room and returned with a huge ass, desert camouflage rucksack.
The lack of air was gradually causing his brain to go cloudy, black dots dancing across his vision and making it hard to focus on Rhodey.
If there wasn't a small rodent burrowing into his skull then he could probably find out. However, he wasn't graced with such a luxury and he still hasn't been given anything to drink.
"They won't stop..." Steve's hushed, rough voice spoke once the bowl was nearly empty. Tony recoiled, even when soothed Steve's voice clearly hadn't been used for anything other than screaming in a long time. Tony couldn't hold it in any longer, the tears finally escaped their confines. He curled himself back into the comfort of the sofa, crinkling multiple sheets of paper. Tony had no idea what to do, he just knew he had to do it. For Steve, for the team, for himself, for Bucky, for Peggy, for Howard, for Erskine, for anyone who ever believed in Steve. He had to do it.
Bucky saw Stark stalk over to him, a knife in his trembling hand. The assassin raised his chin, allowing the smaller man room to press the shining blade against his jugular. He wasn't sure if Stark knew what he was doing...but if he did then Bucky was thankful to be alive.
Steve rolled onto his back but didn't open his eyes, still wanting to get back to sleep. While he was still tired, Steve felt well rested, similar to when he'd been pulled out of the Potomac; lighter and more alive. "What?" He groaned, rubbing his face.
"Im coming with you." She declared. Tony simply shook his head, stepping into the waiting elevator and pressing the button for the communal floor.
Steve could be dead, could have killed himself, and Tony gave him the ability to do so, he might as well have taken a blunt pen knife and dug out all of Steve's vital organs until the blonde stopped breathing.
“I’m using shower gel, James. It’s a modern soap, it lathers quicker, smells nicer too” Natalia told him. He hadn’t even asked but she seemed to sense his question regardless. He started to relax again after that, letting Natalia’s nimble fingers work at his muscles and wash away the tension. She moved most of the way down his back and even past the water line.
Turning his attention away from the two strangers and looking down at himself, he still had the jeans he’d stolen months back but his chest was bare, revealing all his ugly scars and malnourished body. He looked up at his flesh arm and then back down to his left shoulder, struggling to remember why his arm was off but there was still metal on him. However, his stump had been wrapped in huge bandages and then Bucky remembered what he’d done. The pain had been too much to bare so he’d torn his prosthetic right off.
"So, Mr Stark, want to tell me why you fell through my window?" Drat, he did know who Tony was. It didn't seem to make a difference though as the reason he fell (for the second time at least) was hovering above his chest. In the hopes it would help sober him up a little, Tony took the water bottle and downed the contents.
. As if it was that simple, counting the seconds as your lungs were deprived of oxygen. Steve would have been able to help him, Steve would have held him close so he was forced to take deeper breaths, as his general calm helped chisel away the panic.
Bucky glared up at him with malice and only just managed not to growl at him. Only he was allowed to call him Stevie, no one else.
"Hey, hey... I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by it, I swear I didn't. I wasn't joking either, we have found him. Kinda I mean we have rough location and we managed to get security cameras to follow him, and so far he hasn't hidden or noticed and we can go and get him. Bring him back to the tower just like you wanted. Only you don't seem very happy, and I can't help but think I've miss read the last month and a half we've been spending looking for him. Steve please, give me a little help here." Tony rambled. It was enough to to calm Steve from violent, soul shaking sobs to small sniffles.
"My apologies sir, Captain Rogers' heart rate and breathing appeared elevated, I was simply concerned for his well being." Jarvis responded, having the decency to sound apologetic. Tony simply glared up for a minute, clearly contemplating what to do next: open it in front of Steve or give it back? Luckily for Tony, he chose the latter, that was not a wrestling match he'd want to lose.
"No I don't believe it." Steve muttered, sounding less confident than before. "I doubt you'll recognise me but I was one of the soldiers who helped get you out of the cave. I know you aren't like those asshole reporters say you are." Oh. The cave. The dark, the dust. No water. Unless he was being dunked. No food. No more Ynsen. Oh god! Now he couldn't breath. Shit!
Bucky wasn’t sure how long he’d been out and what had changed in that time, but clearly Clint had done some reading if he was taking this approach. He still internally flinched when his hand was grasped, but found he was able to lightly squeeze it.
"Come for me Steve." Tony whispered, taking Steve in his mouth and hollowing his cheeks. Steve peaked and then thrust best he could into Tony's mouth, also pushing himself down onto Tony's fingers, spilling his load into the genius' waiting throat. When he's come down from his high, Tony pulled off, only he decided Steve was apparently not done. He began to relentlessly tug at Steve, swiftly adding another finger and thrusting into him.
Panting and sweaty, both men began to laugh, a sated laugh that summed up their relationship; beautiful and fun. Tony pulled back enough for Steve's shaky legs to fall to the bed before he reached up and undid the cuffs, simply collapsing in the puddle on Steve's chest. With his arms now free, Steve was able to do what he loved most: hold Tony. His strong arms trapped the billionaire against him as they came down from their mutual high.
Steve looked around, apparently confused as to where he was, now more awake. "I, yeah. I don't remember dreaming..." He said in such a way that made Tony's heart hurt, it suggested that Steve didn't remember a time where he didn't have nightmares.
"Seriously James, did you eat at all?" Natalia pressed, gently tipping his head back and using the shower attachment to wet his tangled hair. Her hands were strong but managed not to hurt him as she got the knots and clotted blood out, not pulling too hard and making sure to keep his face dry.
Her steps had been deliberate yet delicate, almost like a dancer's’ might be, every move was planned and perfected but it held grace and control. Her penetrating gaze never left the assassins form, analysing every inch, taking in all the bruising and scars (old and new), the dirt, the way his ribs stuck out like a cliff over a sunken stomach, even the matted clumps of filth in his tangled hair. His beard itched something fierce, he was in dire need of a shower, a shave and some clean clothes but he had no idea what the intentions were of the people before him.
"No, thank you." Tony said, sitting up and scratching his jaw. "Time for you to get some sleep though, Jarvis?" He called, turning to look at Steve with a pre-accusatory expression.
Eventually, he felt the water hit his upper back. Only it wasn’t hitting, it was simply falling over his good shoulder with very little pressure. This was so foreign to Bucky. All he could do was sit still while the pleasant water washed away the initial dirt, blood and sweat. It took a few minutes before he began to relax, but he soon tensed up again when the washcloth replaced the water against his back. He couldn’t tell what exactly, but the cloth had something wet on it, wet and slick.
That had been unexpected, this man’s behaviour was slightly unsettling to Bucky. Even so, he walked back over to the bed and sat down on it, facing the wall and Bruce on the outside. “I won’t answer anything when surrounded by people I don’t know.” He stated clearly, refusing to even blink as he stared at Bruce.
“You think Steve is just going to sit around and accept he can’t see his best friend from the dark ages?”
Steve looked at Tony, who was now beside him, his brows were furrowed as he tried to look into the shadows of the ally, the stacks of crates and grey clouded sky didn't make things any easier.
"Okay, you're right. If I didn't want help I wouldn't have responded. I mean you probably would have blown the doors down anyway but at least then I would have reason to be pissed that you were forcing me. Im not saying it's gonna be easy but I will get better. It took a while before I accepted there was something wrong, ever since the Potomac I've not been good Tony. I should have said something sooner. Im sorry." Steve clarified, it sounded almost rehearsed.Tony didn't know what to do, just sort of stood looking up with his hand in Steve's, frowning at himself.
At last, he was finally done. Five and a half hours of sketching, shading and blending. Still a rough version but he liked it that way, he could spend the best part of a day making it look as lifelike as a pencil drawing could be but he preferred the rough look. It created a more stylised and personal design, each artist had a different stroke and this was Steve's. Anyone could get a picture and make it black and white, especially in the 21st century but not everyone could create a not so perfect sketch of their friend.
“Actually, that one’s a bag of vitamins, minerals and electrolytes that you are really lacking right now. This one-” he held up a slightly smaller bag, “-Glucose. Energy. Of which you need more of. This one here….” He held up a large syringe, “Is the antibiotics. This goes in with the first.” He explained, and Bucky really appreciated being shown and told exactly what was happening.
Tony understood the reasons for the rule and, for the most part, followed it. That was until they finally made it back to the tower, Clint and Natasha leaving the two backseat passengers. The air in the car was thick and heavy, as though the 4x4 itself wanted to crumple into the ground in the same way Tony knew Steve did. Tony
She turned to give Clint a look that could kill, he simply nodded and stalked over to fetch the bucket, grumbling about women and power and being treated like a child or something.
on them he could only assume it wasn't publicly used. Two vans, five sports cars, two pick-up trucks, three vintage cars parked away from the others, and the rest were just average business cars.
Once they were in the apartment it was clear someone had been there recently, the place was impeccable and there was hardly any dust around, seeing Steve's face, Tony piped up as he continued to drag Steve in the right direction. "I have someone clean it every week, I never know when I plan to use it." He explained, pulling Steve into the described bedroom. Steve's heart jumped as the large four poster came into view, the headboard had multiple bars that allowed for many different positions, the posts at the foot were thick and Steve knew they would be perfect. By the looks of things, there was a sheer drape they could release to close them off from the world, Steve like the idea of that, private and secluded but doubly so.
"Oh great, thank you." Natalia said with meaning, taking the vials and syringes from him and setting them down on the nightstand. "Would you like these, James?” She asked carefully.
Bucky decided to do as he was told and quickly cleaned himself up. As he did, Natalia went to the cabinet and pulled something out that Bucky currently couldn’t see. Once he was done, he placed the cloth on the side of the tub and waited patiently for his next instruction.
"Why did you take it, you could'a asked." He said, quickly flicking through to check everything was there.
“It’s a large quantity of fluid going into you, so it will have to be done slowly to make sure your body absorbs it in the right way. You seem ready to pass out again so fingers crossed you’ll sleep through it and the medicine can do its job.” He told him gently, reaching for his arm and looking for good veins. When he had one found, he kept an eye on it as he cleaned his hands with antibacterial gel, collected the right tubes, tourniquet and the canula.
"Okay, how do you wanna do this?" Tony asked cautiously, frowning at the four tall stacks of sketches adorning the partially repaired coffee table. "You want to keep them all?" He guessed, his thoughts confirmed by Steve's subtle nod, Tony wasn't sure if that was wise but for now he wouldn't argue.
to tell me, understand?" Tony cautioned, stoking up and down the backs on Steve's thighs, thumbs brushing the plug and nudging it every time, making Steve twitch.
Now his mind was working double time trying to figure out a way to get him out and communicate more efficiently.
my first aid kit. You think you can make it to the bathroom?" He asked, not giving Tony any time to answer before kneeling and snaking an arm around his waist, hoisting him to his feet. "Come on, don't want blood on the carpet." Steve's tone was flippant but his face was more worried; Tony really hoped he didn't have to go to hospital.
He didn’t sound very threatening, though. More like a real uncle talking to a five-year-old about the jam stains on his shirt, but that was good. However much it irritated Tony, being underestimated right now was a blessing.
Steve’s eyes flitted to his own cock for the shortest part of a second, the sight tilting him almost over the edge, but there was an instant ‘tsk, tsk’ from Tony. “Simple instructions too much for you?”
Tony felt Andrew moving closer to him, and unexpectedly, the proximity gave him courage. His eyes narrowed. “What steps?”
They sparred. By the time Tony started truly tiring, the Great Wall of Stevens in front of him was still holding his ground with no obvious strain. The only difference seemed to be the heat in his eyes which was getting brighter and… Might not all be due to the thrill of a fight.
For the hundredth time, Steve thought about getting himself reassigned. And for the hundredth time he clenched his teeth, huffing the next breath out of his nose. He couldn’t. Being on the same team as Rumlow was such a lucky coincidence; he wouldn’t get another chance like this. And Anthony’s future depended on it.
“Well that is certainly something to be concerned about, yes.” He stood up to walk behind Tony to open his liquor cabinet. For a short while he just stared inside the fridge that was installed into the bar cupboard. “You’ve really stopped drinking then?” He took out a smoothie and made a face. “Admirable, of course.” His voice was polite, but there was no real admiration that Tony could detect. “But perhaps you could at least keep something you can offer your adult guests?”
in bed." Obie put his hands into his pockets and turned fully to face Tony, swaying lightly on the balls of his feet. “Can you say the same? That’s what I’d like to know.”
“No, Tony.” Obie put his hands on his hips and loomed over Tony with his feet planted apart. He stared. “This is bullshit and you know it.”
“He wants to go to the office again,” Lowell told Rumlow as soon as she got back to the apartment that morning.
Andrew’s eyes opened at the same time as his mouth did, and for some reason, it felt that the surprise in them was not only for the order but also for Andrew’s own reaction.
Steve was waiting on the terrace. He didn’t meet Tony halfway, just waited for him to peel himself out of the armor and come to him, still dripping cushion gel.
The pain in his head exploded, and he groaned.  The hangover felt alien and depressingly familiar at the same time. Almost routinely, he made it to the bathroom and threw up, feeling ashamed of his life choices as if this was really him, not his younger, stupider self who had still a lot to learn. It hadn’t been his choice this time, Tony told himself. It was this younger Tony who was to blame — and for a moment he felt lighter, until a voice in his head started scolding him for trying to fob off the responsibility.
When Rumlow left, Steve breathed easier. Any one of them in the same room with Anthony set Steve’s teeth on the edge, exaggerating all of his warring impulses that he had well stowed away otherwise. Now they were at least out of sight. Frankly, Steve had been desperate to just get Rumlow out of Anthony’s presence and was glad it wasn’t Lowell to replace him. (She’d put her foot down the first time Rumlow tried to lob his shift on to her.)
“That’s decided then." Pierce clapped Steve on the shoulder. "Good luck on your assignment, Stevens—and Garett, I expect you to pay appropriate attention to this matter and keep me informed. Have a good day.”
He started moving the finger inside but its walls were stiff and tight so he went slowly. Andrew seemed to like pain, but just in case, Tony took short breaks and just held his finger inside while caressing and pinching Andrew's flesh elsewhere. Continuously prodding at the hole relentlessly as if rubbing down a delicate machine, Tony hummed.
The model was good enough, and after several more tests to waste their time, Stark agreed. Now, they would just need to deal with two more things; all their friends trying to stop them and god Doom. Tony took a swig from his second flask while Banner and Stark were doing a last check on his armors.
He shook his head to dispel the image and pulled out another blank sheet to draw the magnetron for the wave generator. Somebody knocked at the door, but if they really needed to be in the room they would have access, so Tony tuned it out. After a while, the knock turned insistent and then died down. Good.
Tony blinked. The privacy screen? Did they really think he was such a moron? Even if he were actually twenty-one, he would have found it suspicious. It was the second time in under a week, for god’s sake! They were blatantly leaving him alone with Lowell who would try and “distract” him from the “danger.” Too bad, Tony was just not in the mood for molly-coddling or even sex. At his age, even in this mint-fresh body, physical gratification was not everything. Lowell was great, sometimes even fantastic, but playing along with them right now... pretending to have an intimate moment when they both clearly knew what this was… Tony had no intention of doing that. He almost felt sorry for the woman. Looking at her, she didn’t seem to be very keen on the whole idea either.
“Shhh.” Steve pulls him down, ignoring how the pool of his own come smears in between them. He envelops Tony in his arms and kisses his hair. “You can try again tomorrow.”
“Uncle Obie.” Tony flashed his press smile and shuffled a little aside so that he could easily grab his treasure off the floor if Obie tried something. “Come on, old man, would I try hiding anything from you?” He spread his arms in a wondering manner.
Smiling at the sun and his relative freedom, he spent the day wandering around the city, trying to reacquaint himself with all his favourite nooks and crannies in it. He had lunch in one of his favourite restaurants that would close in about ten years and stopped trying to suppress the silly grin that kept blossoming for no reason.
(I've also added the link to the wonderful winteriron story 'Seize Yesterday' by DannieU which was the main inspiration for writing this story. You can read it here: https://archiveofourown.org/works/5467712/chapters/12638345)
“You have performance problems while being watched, Stevens? That normal for you?” Tony said in a bored voice.
“Oh that is good to hear!” Anthony sounded appreciative on the surface, but Steve knew the tone very well and it meant that Tony hated every minute of this conversation.
Steve felt much better now that he had a plan. Maybe he could be a positive influence for the short time he was in Tony’s life, making this time a little bit easier on him when Steve knew how hard it had been on Tony, originally. Something twisted in his gut when he thought that maybe if the Steve who was still on ice and this Anthony got to meet one day, they might get off to a better start than Tony and Steve ever had because Anthony remembered a nice SHIELD agent that looked just a bit like Captain America. Someone who had been there... like a nice uncle maybe.
In a way, the whole Obie-shaped problem was a good distraction from his unhealthy obsession with Stevens and how he needed to talk to him about what had happened. So dealing with the fallout with Obie, who was undoubtedly thinking his screws were loose, felt pretty good in comparison.
Aha! The proposal he’d been waiting for! He trailed his gaze over it, then read it more thoroughly. Signed it. Next.
Tony’s other hand trailed over his face, proprietarily. Steve’s jaw went slack, causing Tony to chuckle. “Slut.”
“You just think about that, okay, son? Turning your life upside down? Refusing to design weapons —” he added as if as an afterthought, “— won’t change anything, and your father…” He paused as if getting his emotions under control. “Your father would’ve been proud if you continued his work.”
Jerkily Tony nodded. “I’m sorry, Obie, I’ll try.” He tried to remember whether he’d been so pliant in his youth, whether he was overdoing it, but couldn’t quite remember. He’d always been drunk or high and that had given him the courage to disagree with most of the things he had wanted to disagree with, but Stane had always somehow still commanded his attention and respect.
Anthony’s chin jerked up as he glanced at Steve. Maybe it was still too early for that message anyway.
Twenty minutes into the shift change Tony stood up, picked up his jacket and headed off, the (future Hydra) goon trailing after him. The impostor was behind the wheel. Of course.
Tony’s gaze slid off the pile and out the large wall-to-wall window. It was foolish how sure Tony felt about Stevens being different from Lowell. Because he wasn’t. He couldn’t be.
Steve just set the turn signal and unfortunately, the car did follow them. He was absolutely sure that it was nothing. He’d just needed an explanation for staring.
“You know you have to be in tip-top shape for this, Tony,” Stane admonished him while walking and poking around the room, looking at various gadgets and papers on all the available surfaces, even though they both knew that what he really wanted to see was lying on the floor behind Tony. Thank fuck Tony didn’t really need to draw up the schematics of the reactor these days; they were all in his head.
“Is this about the car crash?” He shook his head and opened his arms, walking closer. “My dear boy! I don’t really think it was because your father was drunk. He might have had a drink, but he was always very careful with your mother, you know that!”
“Fuck!” Andrew jerked his wrist out of Tony’s hold to grab onto the headboard again and push himself back onto Tony’s cock.
Steve walked over to where his plate sat on the kitchen table and brought it over. He sat down on the other end of the sofa across from Anthony, and dug in. He was trying not to pay any attention to what Anthony was doing, but still noticed when only a minute later the young man leaned back to enjoy his pasta.
Office work had never been something Tony revelled in, but he was good at most things he put some effort into, and he’d learned to be patient with tasks he disliked doing as the years went by, too. Nevertheless, the day one had to receive a future (or hell, who knew, maybe even present) Hydra leader was definitely rather stress-inducing.
“I realize that me being here is not an ideal solution for any of you. Some of you are worried that the ‘passing of a titan’ is going to affect our market influence and product quality. And subsequently, our performance in all sectors.” He paused and noted that most of the board members were watching him with genuine attentiveness, some were baffled, and a couple of old men seemed disapproving of him for even having opened his milk-fresh mouth, but it was going better than he'd expected. Tony purposefully didn’t look at Obie.
“Yes,” he rasped quietly as if ashamed, but also aroused; and as the word sounded in the quiet room, his body shuddered again in excitement.
It had been a mistake — supposing that physical activity would help him not to think. The exertion was not making any of his inner turmoil go away. Jumping backwards, he kicked the bag and it went swinging. Well, kickboxing was still boxing, right?
The conversation was in German, so Steve didn’t get everything but the general drift of things. The man offered Tony a seven-figure sum, but he wasn’t satisfied with getting in on that project; he wanted a piece of SI. Something that was clearly not on the table. Tony looped back to the project several times (“The future of telecommunications… much better reception... everyone will have a mobile phone, even your mother...”), but to no avail. In the end, the man pulled his chair closer, talking even more intensely at Tony, who was slowly backing his own chair up against a wall. When he had nowhere left to go and the man leant much too much into Tony’s space, Steve snapped forward and pulled him back by his collar.
The supposed bodyguard leaned down, looked Tony straight into the eye and said, “Surprise me. Stay here."
No, he wouldn’t. Because Stevens was not important. Not to Tony. He wasn’t supposed to be, but the pain of this knowledge was relentless. Being here was a coincidence as much as an opportunity though, because Steve’s marks were Rumlow and Pierce. Not Tony. He could have no stake in anything concerning Tony Stark.
Tony looked away and grit his teeth. Maybe he should just fuck someone similar, get it out of his system. It wouldn’t help. It hadn’t when Steve had been alive, it wouldn’t now, and staring at this gorgeous oaf in a tux wouldn’t change anything.
Underoos for help with the military ranks, and the rest gaggle of heroes for the beta (in no particular order): VTHX, ASchmidts and BuckyAboveEverything and AvengersNewB. <3 <3 <3
Anthony’s mouth fell open, the harsh admonishment lost somewhere between his brain and his tongue. Steve closed the door as fast as he could without slamming it.
The elevator ride was laden with tension and Stevens looked as if he was desperately trying to keep himself still.
Silently, Tony agreed. Even though the windows were tinted, he didn’t fancy playing sitting duck in a dark alley. He slipped lower between the seats and called himself every kind of name he remembered because who arms themselves with tasers? Tasers were a short range weapon. On-impact short even. What good would it do if he was being shot at in a dark alley?
The stupid nickname hit Steve right into his solar plexus with recognition, shock (he knows it’s me, he
“Shit, sorry.” He picked him off the mattress, and righting his head again, laid him out on his back. His legs were still indecently spread. Steve corrected it to just a small opening, inviting but not lewd; the hands went down to his sides. The placing of the limbs alone made Steve’s cock pulse where it was confined under his body. He took a deep breath removed his hands from the doll in favor of letting his eyes do the touching for a while.
Tony had every intention to burn all of the designs he could find in his home, office, and the R&D department. He grimaced regretfully. “I’m sorry, Obie, but I can’t.” He shook his head and made his shoulders slump in an even more pathetic manner. “I’ve tried, it’s just… There’s so much death, I just can’t be the reason for more. I...”
Instead, he stared at him, scrutinizing with narrow eyes. “Are you cold? Experiencing shivers or some such?”
Tony was getting hard, and he wasn’t even at the end of his stack of documents yet. Besides, it was Madden on the other side of the wall today. He couldn’t have Stevens no matter how tempted he was to give in to his urges right now.
“I grew up in the city, and they are the best.” Steve hoped that Anthony would not ask any further questions. “I wouldn’t eat clams from anywhere else either.”
God, Tony couldn’t wait to tie those strong, pale wrists to the headboard and fuck that deep cavity of silky warmth that talked so little and—
Their intense gazes locked onto each other, Tony executed a couple of more attacks, then deciding to take a chance, leaped back and turned to the ropes. “Get in the shower. We’re leaving.”
He padded to the kitchen and made himself a sandwich. He wasn’t feeling especially hungry, but he knew that he needed to eat in order to function. He had things to do, a world to save. He couldn’t just fall apart because there was somebody vaguely resembling Captain America working for SHIELD.
It was an admirable trait, to be able to let go like this. To trust like this. At this thought, Tony’s fingers slackened in awe. Why would Andrew trust Tony like that? It was unbelievable and amazing; it made Tony feel warm and mellow, wanting to drop everything and just cuddle in front of the TV.
Tony pulled his hand away from Steve’s face. “Close it.” Tony’s voice was husky and the command less punctuated than before. Nonetheless, Steve did as he was told.
“Did you think I forgot about this?” The tip of Tony’s shoe was raised against Steve’s balls. It wasn’t meant to be pleasurable and it sure didn’t feel that way, and still Steve’s head insisted that he didn’t want it removed. “Do you think you could come from this?” The sound of Tony’s voice was intrigued, curiosity laced with sadistic fascination. The angle of his foot changed so that the sole was pressing on Steve’s cock from the top. “A wet patch right there and a shoe print to go with it. And then we will have the rest of this nice evening out there, making sure everyone gets a chance to see.” The pressure increased again and Steve whimpered around Tony’s cock. “Aww, you would like that wouldn’t you? Let people know just what kind of big, dumb brute you are. The one who gets his face stuffed in a back room at the first opportunity, who only carries condoms because his CO suggested it. The one who gets himself in trouble just so I take him to task again.”
Pulling back the duvet, he did his best to ignore the small black form standing out starkly against the white of the second pillow. He laid down on his back off-center on the oversized bed and put his head to the side, looking at the doll. It couldn’t see him with its face smushed into the pillow. Not that it would be able to see at all.
Surprise, affront, and indecision warred on her face only for a second and soon he was fucking her against the wall.
Work. Tony added a line, drew the next one without calculating the length. He added a few more strokes, and bullheadedly went on to finish the design. Imagining what the detail would look from the other side, he pulled up a new sheet. He put a circle in the middle, added a vector—
had certainly realized that the satellite project kept taking up too much of Tony’s time and the other, currently more profitable ones kept being pushed back because of it. So Obie was not a fan, and Tony felt immensely satisfied with the amount of control he could see the old man exert over himself because of it. As far as Tony knew, he was still making all the polite excuses to the board and their partners, so Tony figured he had a little time before the man lost his temper.
“Yes, and I have no intention of disrupting them. Those contracts are going to be fulfilled as agreed, but I'm simply letting you know that what we have not yet signed on is not going to come to fruition." Strictly speaking, this was against his work ethic, to back out on  promises, but Tony was still not compromising on his refusal to bring more new weapons into this world. "I've got a great deal of ideas for communications technology, though," he said quickly as if trying to earn the older man’s approval, whose clean-shaven face and a head chock-full of light hair seemed to be an image that his brain still associated with someone who cared, as opposed to the old, bald man, the embodiment of betrayal.
He was probably asking because he was planning to disappear again. Steve wasn’t sure if Rumlow thought Steve was too dim to pick up on it or just didn’t care.
"Bed," he said shortly. He could allow for a little consideration now that they both knew what this was about.
Next, he built himself taser guns to hide under his sleeves. The actual repulsor gauntlets would take time, so that would have to wait. In his head, he started compiling lists of what he would need for building the deshifter to expose the Chitauri and also planning the necessary steps for launching a satellite with appropriate tech on board.
“You won’t be around Stark much anyway. Just let Lowell and Madden do their jobs, and you’ll look smarter.”
Steve blinked, and slowly the needlepoint focus of his perception widened to give way to the complete scene around him. The function security was there, demanding that he let the man go, and the guests were murmuring and staring, their altercation providing more entertainment than expected from that evening. Rumlow was standing close by, looking unsure if he should swoop in to tear Steve a new one or sweep in to help him get out of it. Before he came to any decision, Tony was on the scene.
Garret was gruff, but that wasn’t a problem for Steve. They hadn’t found anything connecting him to Hydra, which didn’t mean that he wasn’t part of it; it was equally likely he could simply be a tired SHIELD agent who didn’t know what was going on underneath the surface.
That night, Tony dreamed of that fucking disintegrator again. The only one that he had ever managed to get his hands on. Obsessively, he’d disassembled and assembled it that night after Steve had... He’d taken it apart and put it back together several times. Again, and again, and again. He’d wanted to see how it worked. To see how they could use it. Or that’s what he had told himself afterwards. He’d analyzed the parts and tested it as a whole on inanimate objects and organic matter, and took it apart again, just to make
“There’s a security issue, Mr. Stark,” Agent Madden said. “Please stay in the car. Agent Lowell will protect you.”
Steve hoped that Rumlow didn’t expect him to answer. He was working very hard to keep everything he might say from coming out.
Tony’s free hand came down to Steve’s throat, covering the front so that he could feel his own Adam's apple when swallowing. Tony needed to change his angle a bit for it, and the speed of his thrusts decreased while he pushed in as far as possible every time. Air was becoming scarce, and Steve was feeling lightheaded.
Steve had learned by now that power was the only thing that Rumlow really respected, and apparently, he didn’t think Tony had any. Well, even if Steve had never met Tony at this age, he knew what Tony was like. Steve was looking forward to Rumlow being steamrolled by a tiny, sarcastic genius that was about to take over the world. Not literally of course.
After putting the weights away, Steve wiped down the bench and looked around. He was the last one at the gym, as planned. Even so, he dawdled some more because it wasn’t time yet. He would be on camera in here and after he left the locker room again. Staying too long there might raise suspicions. These days that was where a significant part of his attention went, to not drawing attention. At least not too much.
Regardless of his apparent polite patience, Tony expected the CFO to visit him with the thumb screws relatively soon. The crucial bit, at this point, was stalling him until they could launch what Tony needed launching because otherwise, all his efforts would be in vain.
But he hadn’t fallen off the wagon when the Chitauri had come out in the open, nor when it turned out that they had already lost, nor even after Steve had... under that bridge… And not a sip after experiencing his first hangover in over a decade a few weeks ago, so he wasn’t going to do it now either.
“We’re going,” he barked at Andrew, grabbed his jacket, and stormed toward the staircase. “I left my car in the level two car park.”
This time, Obie accosted Tony in his lab at SI. The half-assembled arc reactor slipped through his numb fingers and under the workbench.
Rumlow grumbled in response, but Larry from building security reassured them that the room was safe, and that the transport elevator at the back of it was monitored from the very same room Steve was sitting in. So that was something useful he could do, Steve thought with a quiet satisfaction.
Steve was left alone in the hallway once more, but it was only for less than a couple of minutes before Anthony rushed out with Stane on his heels.
Steve thought about protesting, but in reality, he also liked being closer to Anthony while Rumlow was all the way across town, even if he could give Anthony that kind of safety only for a couple of hours.
It couldn’t be. It wasn’t. Pressing his palm to the wall, Tony leaned over and took another look at the improbably triangular back, the military crop of light blond hair. It was shorter than he’d ever seen it on Steve. But of course it was. It couldn’t be
Obie must have assured them that Tony would only play a minor, figurehead role in the company and that Obie would ensure that the status quo along with the company’s success would prevail. Tony had interpreted it as distrust of him personally back when he’d done this show and dance the first time; he’d assumed that people didn’t expect much from an irresponsible playboy. Now that he knew Stane' real agenda, Tony saw what was going on with entirely fresh eyes, and Obies's overly familiar dismissal of Tony's abilities felt far more sinister. Therefore, what Tony had to do was to make people feel that Tony Stark was worth paying attention to.
Pierce, who had followed the conversation with some attention, his freezing blue eyes snapping from Garett to Steve and back, said, “That’s fine; I think we were done anyway. The order comes from even way above my head this time. It’s not as if they explain every reason for their decisions to the infantry.”
“We’re boxed in here—” Stevens started, but Rumlow was already running out to the street, his own gun drawn.
The low demand out of Andrew’s mouth just egged Tony on and he was about to spill when he saw Andrew's right hand let go of the headboard and reach for his cock.
he continued in his head, still trying to look contrite. “I do get your point,” he added, placatingly.
Something in Tony crumpled. He gasped and, holding onto the wall, stumbled to the ensuite bathroom. He locked himself in and slid down the door onto cold, hard tiles.
Tony shook himself. He exited the car and passed the lobby floor straight into the car park with Madden on his heels.
No, he wasn’t thinking about that. Instead, he turned to the workstation and for a moment stopped to admire the Enterprise-D replica from Next Generation he’d bought so long ago and lost some time during the numerous moves from one workshop to another. God knows where it had ended up back then, but here it was, new and shiny. Tony smiled, trailed his fingers over its surface and moved on to his work, putting down all the strokes to design the payload for emitting the special pulse he needed on the new satellite. The annoying part was that he had to go back and fill in all the blanks that his engineers would need to understand the schematic. When he designed things for himself he always skipped steps.
“I will call them and get a separate room,” Rumlow said. He hated any new location, and securing it beforehand was always a fight with Anthony. “Stevens can get the books you need.”
He slowed his breathing, hummed his contentment and realized that Andrew was still taut and shivery under him.
The afternoon flowed like molasses, and Steve was very aware of Rumlow and Lowell coming and going at different times. He thought about going for a run or doing something else, but in the end, he never made it off the bed.
Steve needed to explain himself. Make sure he could continue with the assignment. He opened his mouth before he had any idea what to say.
Steve. Should he also help Steve? Would defrosting him early help him? Help the world? Would Steve want to be defrosted early to fight Hydra? Or would it be unfair to ask?
“I know a way you can show me you’re sorry,” Tony said with a vicious grin. He pulled off his T-shirt and part of Steve felt like he was dragged back to the surface again.
He woke up to a doorbell. His eyes blinked open, and bewildered, he picked himself up from the floor near the front door. He glanced at the clock: 10 p.m. Who the hell would visit at this time?
A heaving sob broke out of his chest and, hacking out another sob, Tony managed to take a quick breath, too quick,
CFO and CEO: victorious. So for the moment, Tony had to be satisfied with just taking a step back from Stane’s looming presence and looking away.
“If he is too tired, he’ll fall asleep,” Madden chipped in, “It is not as if he works with explosives or anything, right?”
Logically, Steve knew he was being ridiculous. He remembered how Tony was the one to initiate all of the encounters. And Tony wouldn’t have sex with people he disliked. He wouldn’t make his partner feel like crap— he wouldn’t…
Even as a small guy, he still had the presence to go with it. Tony had always known how to sell it. The familiarity of Anthony displaying such a big attitude made Steve feel as if he were sliced right open, but fortunately, his facial muscles had stopped reacting to his emotions some time ago.
Steve lets go of his neck, and Tony pushes himself up, his arms trembling. It takes him a minute to get back into the rhythm. Steve watches him, considering as if he has doubts that Tony can do it. He has done this three times already today. He can do it a fourth time.
And then Andrew said ‘please’ and there was no holding back any more: the pleasure exploded in his gut and balls and was channeled through his cock into the spasming hole. Milking him, milking and still moving on his cock, although erratically now. Chafing him and not that good any more, but Andrew was obviously still coming so Tony let him until the man collapsed under him, and for a short half a minute, Tony crashed on top.
“Okay” and hands interwined. Steve and Tony walks, they walk far until they encounter a tunnel. The grip they have on each other’s hands tighten, holding each other for a sense of comfort- so they won’t be alone, so they won’t be scared, because together? Nothing will beat them.
“I love you Tony. I believe that one day you’re irony of killing off your legacy will become a reality. You are so incredibly strong and brave. So smart and kind. You’re a pain in the ass but I love it.” Steve whispered in his ear.
They were expecting Howard or Stane. Or at least a spider. They weren’t expecting that. The boggart stopped turning, its back to Tony. Steve sucked in a breath. He recognized that back of the head.
It’s like the ocean- the ocean hair, the suit. It’s a recurring theme, it seems. “I, uh. I died too” Steve’s hands run through his blonde locks. “So it’s true? We’re really dead?” Tony’s voice caught in his throat as he speaks, obviously shocked. “I’m sorry” Steve says mournfully
Tony cracked his neck and pulled out his wand, then walked closer to the dog (the last student’s worst fear). It tilted its head to the side before taking a step closer. The monster jumped up and swirled around as it began to take form.
Okay, Steve definitely isn’t making sense, the stars, how can he have ‘stars in his eyes’ maybe it’s a metaphor? Or what about the whole star hair? Yeah, no. Tony’s not falling for that bullshit.
“You’re not my Tony, but you’re still like him. You know this isn’t right. I know deep inside you, you regret this. That you don’t want this.” Steve heard himself say, “I loved you. Tony I loved you. I’m so sorry. Don’t do this.”
The embrace lasted awhile, both Steve and Tony finding comfort in each other. “So what do we do now?” Tony breaks the silence. “We cross, we walk, we move on.” Steve points to the general direction of nothingness. “So what are you still doing here?” Tony questions “I was waiting”
“Never thought you’d be the kind to settle down.” Tony whispered as he gently straddled onto Steve’s lap, carefully placing his legs to not hurt the older man, “Always so busy  with work.”
Tonight was a night of celebration. Tonight called for rough yet agonizing slow rounds. Called for The Captain to slide in Tony’s still used and slick hole, to take him apart slowly. Bit by agonizing bit. A great way to start a new era. Their era.
Warm hands gently wrapped around his arm and began to guide him towards the doors of the classroom. Tony heard faint footsteps, probably his friends, following behind him. The group quietly walked through the hallways, surrounding Tony from curious eyes, until they got to the Ravenclaw common room.
“Who decided to make the after life a hard thing, I swear–“ Tony groans, his shoulders slumping. “Well I mean even in other myhts there’s the whome judgement thing you know, Tony?” Steve remarks, his brain thinking hard. “So what the hell are we supposed to do then? I hate this”
“So that’s why it spoke. It had to take a form of something but your fear was the words it said.” Pepper murmured as she pushed a stray hair behind her ear.
“Waiting? Waiting for what?” Tony wonders, it must be really important to Steve. “I was... I was waiting for you.” Steve shyly says under his breath, just loud enough for Tony to be able to hear. “Me?” Questions Tony further. “Yes you, genius.” Why would Steve wait for Tony?
The boggart slowly turned and Tony froze. He heard the students behind him gasp. The creature could’ve turned to anyone. But there in front of Tony was himself. He had everything, from the messy hair do, to the smirk Tony always had on his lips.
“Angel of Death.” The creature hissed, its voice sounding exactly like Tony’s, “Just like your father. A murderer.”
“Remember. It’s just a representation of the fear you have, it can’t hurt you.” The professor, Coulson, repeated to Tony.
The two quietly left the house, locking the doors behind them. Tony let a small power outage blanket their takeoff back to his tower, their tower now. As they flew, Tony felt himself grin as he thought back to the note that was left on the wall, while “it’s been a long long time” filled the room on repeat.
“I- yeah, you’re one with the stars and all.” Steve’s hands slowly comes off Tony’s hair. “Cut the bullshit, Rogers.”
Then he had also been invited back to the compound to check on the new recruits. Steve had tried to remind Rhodes that he didn’t need to approve training exercises, he wasn’t Captain America. Hell he wasn’t even Steve Rogers anymore.
Tony snapped out of whatever trance he had been in and looked around. Everyone was around him, eyes filled with concern. Carol handed Tony a cup of warm tea. Tony wrinkled his nose at it before taking a small sip.
Steve gritted his teeth and pushed himself into the room, his gun raised. He froze. A gasp. The gun clattered to the ground.
“Tony, you are so amazing. Why would you be afraid of yourself?” Bruce asked, “You don’t have to tell us of course.”
“I love you too- I can’t believe it took us years and finally death for me to say that. God. I’m such an idiot” Tony nearly laughs at himself.
“The spell is supposed to turn something scary into something to laugh at. You’re just fell over and died.” Thor whispered.
Tony’s breath was becoming more erratic, his chest beginning to feel like it was being crushed by a giant. The creature tilted his head to the side and its grin stretched.
“–I feel like I’ve loved you for so long, Tony. And I feel stupid at how long it took for me to talk about it, and above all I still did those things to you and I just can’t forgive myself for it.” Steve finishes.
“Well I don’t know, Tony.” Steve is still staring at him, why does he keep staring? “Why are you staring?” He did not mean to say that out loud. “It’s just- you’re beautiful, Tony. Look at the stars in you” Steve’s hands slowly move up to touch Tony’s star flecked hair. “Stars?”
Tony could vaguely hear Coulson’s voice telling him it wasn’t real. He could vaguely hear Steve trying to snap him out of his trance.
Tony turned to look at Steve with soft eyes. He could feel the tears trying to make their way out but with a couple blinks, they were gone.
“Look at you now, Rogers. I’d never thought I would see you like this.” Tony chuckled, tapping a long finger on his knee.
“Aye aye captain, lead the way.” Steve rolls his eyes fondly at Tony’s wording, both of them moving.
The man turns around at his question. Wait. He knows him, blue eyes, blonde wavey hair... Steve. “Tony?” Steve questions. “Steve. Oh god. Steve- what, what are you doing here?” then again steve looks weird, feels weird? There’s something about his presence that’s calm but at the same time also unsettling?
“I’ll see you later, Wing Head.” Tony whispered as he left the room, “I got some business to take care of.”
Tricking the kid was easy. Peter had been so desperate to have another father figure, so desperate to bring back a Tony Stark to their earth. So desperate to bring back Morgan’s father. If Tony cared, he might’ve even felt bad for tricking him into thinking he was actually good.
Steve froze and stared. Blue eyes, not a beautiful deep brown. Tony only tilted his head to the side and smirked, while slowly lifting a long leg and crossing it over the other.
“I’m not... afraid of myself per se. I’m afraid of who I will become. Of my legacy.” Tony whispered, his hands tightening around the warm cup.
The team, the Avengers were incredibly gullible. They all immediately took to him, as if trying to make up from their past mistakes of ignoring the other Tony. They trusted too hard, too fast. Mostly because he already knew who they were. They weren’t the same as his old team but they had similar traits. It also helped that they didn’t have a Black Widow.
“Look, Cap. It’s okay. We’re here now, we’re together, and we have an eternity right?” Tony brushes Steve’s cheeks. “So let’s walk, let’s talk. Let’s forgive, let’s forget, okay?”
Steve Rogers had died in the battle against Thanos. When he had gone back to be with Peggy he became Steve Edwards. Sam and Bucky still teased him endlessly for the name change but they understood. The ex soldier wanted privacy, and that meant becoming another man in the process.
Tony tilted his head to the side and narrowed his eyes thoughtfully, “I do want this Steve. I have all I could possibly want.”
“Stop apologizing for doing absolutely nothing” Tony is seriously starting to get sick of Steve’s guilty eyes.
Steve felt like he had been hit with a wave of ice cold water. He watched in silence as The Captain pulled out a gun, with a special nuzzle attached. In panic, Steve turned to look at Tony.
Tony blinks his eyes open, adjusting to the bright white nothing in the scope of his vision. He stands up after adjusting to the brightness of the vast white nothingness, his legs wobbly and his mind disoriented. And as he looks around to see nothing he grows more confused
“Thanks, I- you too” Tony isn’t even kidding. Steve’s eyes are so incredibly blue, his hair is one with the waves, his suit is the wave. Everything about Steve was the ocean.
“Did you know that electronics run in a little different frequency then from where we are from?” Tony tapped his watch, killing all electronics in the house, including Steve’s phone.
The team began to argue about what movie should they watch, while Natasha turned on the WiFi machine Tony had created the first year in Hogwarts since there was no WiFi in the stupid school.
Tony looks around to the pale white surroundings. Closing his eyes, slowly starting to see some of his memories past by. His mother teaching him piano, Jarvis fixing his tie, Anna making cookies for him to steal, Every single time Rhodey helped him get up, when Rhodey told him they were best friends. When Happy saved him from a group of thugs, his and pepper’s first meeting- and first kiss. He remembers the Avengers, Bruce and his constant presence, Natasha and her constant mothering, Clint as a constant annoyance, Thor and every-time he discovers something ‘new’. He remembers his kids, Peter and Harley.
There could also be the possibility of Stane showing up. His father’s right hand man was scary. Anyone who met him always left feeling uneasy and a little frightened. Even Natasha and Carol couldn’t stand to be in the same room with said man for an extended amount of time. Though they knew they could defend themselves, they still felt the little nervous fear crawl up their throats.
“Well I, uh. Okay. I’m here now” Assures Tony. “We can go”. At first, Steve seems to be silent- is he looking at Tony? “Let’s take a walk then” Steve finally breaks his stare.
Shadows: Who’s ready for smut time! That’s it. That’s the chapter. It’s all smut with only the tiniest bit of plot if you’re really paying attention. So, all aboard the smut train! Choo! Choo! The title is from the song
Back in the castle, Steve and Tony were in their bedroom thinking of plans for the baby but were celebrating first of all.
As the figures got closer he closed his eyes again. The last thing he felt was safety and warmth. That wasn’t such a bad way to go out.
“You got your degree, even though it took an extra year. So what are you going to do with it? I mean, if you want to keep skating I’ll support you, but-.”
“You can’t just hole up in your room forever. Come out and help with some cleaning before guests arrive.” Maria said outside of Anthony’s door.
Every chance Steve had, he would be cuddling Tony and trying to lick and sniff his belly. The fact that he was going to be a father brought him so much joy still. He wondered how his parents would feel if he told them that they would become grandparents. His mother Sarah always told him that there was an Omega out there for him and the time would be right when he would find that Omega for him to be his mate and have pups. His father Joseph was proud of his Alpha son even if he was small at first because he knew that his Steven would become something great and that no one should judge an Alpha, Beta, or Omega by their size.
Steve leaned forward and kissed Anthony lightly on the lips and he continued to thrust into Anthony but he decided to take it a more romantic turn to show his love for his future bride. He laid his right hand over Anthony’s and brought it to above his head, gently opened it with his fingers, and interlaced them together. They were in the most intimate moment they’ve ever had since meeting each other only 1 day ago. Steve then moved his lips from Anthony’s lips to his neck and pressed feather-like kisses over the vein. He then moved to look Anthony directly in the eyes. The thrusts became more erratic before Anthony came with a scream from the sensation he felt for the first time and Steve came with a grunt into Anthony’s hole before pulling out.
“I think you all look great,” said a quiet voice from the background. Oh God, it was Bruce. None of them had seen Bruce in years, not since the Ultron incident.
“I had this dream not that long ago that we had a kid named Morgan. Why ‘Morgan’, I’m not sure. I mean, Pep has an eccentric uncle named Morgan, but I dunno, I guess I just like the name?”
As soon as Steve shifted out of his wolf form and changed into pajamas, he looked at Tony who was still in his wolf form.
After a little longer of being at the cliff, Steve then turns the horse away and both of them head off into the forest again. They traveled for around 5 minutes before they came across a small creek that doesn’t appear to be moving very fast. Steve then got to a decent spot and got off of the horse and helped Anthony off as well. He then led Midnight over to a safe spot and tied her reins up securely.
Pepper brings up one more fish and Happy returns with one more item before Rhodey said “Time to head back to the cabin, found some good stuff today.” and then they all started picking up the fish and items that Happy found and make their way back to the cabin.
“Darling, I want to see you open your eyes.” Steve spoke softly which Anthony does and looks at the way Steve towers over him. He saw how Steve’s hands and cock were shiny with something.
Natasha had somehow gotten hold of a Quinjet, although she wouldn’t tell them how she obtained it. Steve sat in the back as they flew home. He knew he should be wholly focused on their mission, but he couldn’t help but think what Tony’s reception of them would be. He looked at the ring again and thought back to when Tony had first given it to him.
“Yeah, she does, don’t you, Morguna?” Tony said to their daughter. Steve had to chuckle. The baby was only minutes old, and Tony was already coming up with nicknames.
“Don’t hold back my darling. I want to hear everything from you.” Steve said in a sultry voice before going back to working his mouth around Anthony’s cock. He then goes forward and takes Tony deep inside his mouth. That’s when Anthony just melted completely. He just couldn’t believe the warmth of Steve’s mouth around his cock. Steve bobbed his head up and down, savoring the taste of Anthony’s cock. Steve uses his tongue to work around the wonderful member of his bride to be. He’s looking forward to making Anthony spill out his sweet white nectar. Steve pulled off of Anthony’s member with plans of bringing Anthony even more pleasure.
“Anthony?! Are you kidding me with this video, or what?” Happy said as he was watching the very video.
Steve is waiting at the top of a hill with his army, Bucky, Natasha, Peggy, Wanda, and Pietro. Staring off into the distance, waiting for King Howard and his army to show up.
On the cliffs, Tony could see a golden-colored wolf that looked majestic. Tony was drawn by how stunning the wolf was that he howled back as a response to the wolf. The golden wolf seemed to hear him and looked down at him and howled back but then he turned around and moved out of Tony’s view. Still staring at where the golden wolf was on the cliff, Tony pondered “Why didn’t that wolf come down? I wanted to get to know him.” before making his way back to Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy.
After resting in Kansas City for a little longer after finding out that Tony was pregnant, the pack continued their journey onward through Missouri. While they continued their journey, Steve decided that Tony would be resting in the truck while Happy drove for a period of time so he could rest before he’d resume walking with Steve.
Steve and Tony excused themselves to a private room where they stripped naked and immediately started passionately kissing. They moved over to the bed where Tony landed on his back with Steve on top of him.
“Oh…! You’re freaking amazing! That was a perfect copy of Steven! Honestly, I thought you’d be depressed and unwilling to skate again after your loss at the Grand Prix Final.”
“Don’t worry my dear, you will be a wonderful mother to our children. We must tell the kingdom at once ” Steve said as he kissed Tony on the lips before he helped Tony back into his dress. They then left the room of the healer fairly quickly.
“Well dear, we will have a traditional wedding ceremony and that night is when you’ll be turned. The next morning, you’ll be dressed in your royal garb and meet your new subjects. It will be a grand occasion and I want you to be ready for that. You and I will have people to help us dress for the occasion, you’ll walk down the aisle alone, and we’ll say the wedding verses that will bond you and me together for eternity.”
”I have nothing to prove to you.” Tony said as he swung his sword and sliced Howard’s neck, leading to him bleeding out.
“You did well tonight, but I think your step sequence could use a bit more finesse.” Steven said as he walked by with Harley.
It was at that moment when he was still trying to catch his breath that Steve’s phone went off, showing that Tony was calling him. He nearly dropped it in his haste to answer.
When they arrived in Ohio, Tony was now 6 months pregnant and heavy with his and Steve’s pups. Steve could see by looking at Tony that there was maybe more than 1 pup. He was filled with so much pride and joy seeing how heavy his mate is with their pups, only 3 more months and they would be born. Tony’s nipples were already starting to get bigger and hang lower, a sign that his body was preparing the milk for their pups to drink. As he was getting bigger, Tony’s found it harder to walk compared to before he was pregnant.
“Anthony, there’s something that I want to do for you but I want you to trust me but tell me to stop when you feel uncomfortable at any point. Do you trust me?”
“Darling, I want you to watch me work you open before we come together.” Anthony watched in nervousness but excitement as he watched Steve resume what he was doing.
A few hours later and now Tony, Pepper, Happy, and Rhodey were sitting at the table eating dinner when Rhodey decided to speak up. “So, I’ve been thinking about this. Tony, why were you out in the woods when we found you?”
Emmie: This is it everyone, the final chapter. Hope you all will love it. Song for this chapter is from H2O: Just Add Water:
Steve felt the tears well up as he nodded “Yes, yes absolutely I will, but are you sure this is what you want?”
Steve had been on the run for two years. He had gone through the whole debacle over the Accords and the fight with Tony in the bunker in his head many times, thinking of what he could have done differently. Tony had proposed just a few months before, and they were planning to get married by the end of the year. Technically, they never officially ended the engagement, although Steve figured that didn’t need to be said at this point. Even so, Steve never took his ring off for longer than a few minutes.
“So what do you have planned big boy?” Tony teased Steve with sliding his hand down towards his penis.
“Ah-ah!” The priest said jokingly, stopping them before they were able to do so, “Wait for me to say the words this time.” He paused and made them wait while the congregation laughed. “You may now kiss your husband.” At that, Steve wasted no time drawing Tony in.
“You thought you could become an internet sensation without telling me?” Pepper said on feeling shocked by the news of the video of Anthony going viral.
“Not that I’m not happy for you,” T’Challa added, “but perhaps you should save that for later? I can even provide you with your own bedroom.”
Steve then wrote down the last thing on their list for now and put the paper and pen away for now and then turned to look at his sweetheart sitting in his lap facing him.
Tony took the wedding ring for Steve. “Steve, this ring is a reminder of my promise to you. I vow to love and honor you from this moment forward.” He slid the ring on Steve’s finger. At that, they didn’t wait for the priest to invite them to do it, they drew close and kissed.
Today is the day, today is the day that King Howard and his army will attack the Hydra kingdom and try to take back Tony.
Steve moves his hands on to Anthony’s shoulder blades before kissing him fully on the lips. Anthony moved his hands up Steve’s arms and put them on his shoulders but Steve felt Anthony tensing up and pulled away and looked him in the eyes.
Tony, Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha, and Happy worked at Stark Industries. Tony was the founder of the company but didn’t feel like taking the position of CEO so he handed that to Pepper. Tony took the position of CTO where he would be developing basically all of the tech that Stark Industries would be selling to the public. Rhodey also worked in RnD alongside Tony. They worked great together and didn’t cause too many explosions. Although Pepper would disagree with that statement. Happy was in charge of security at Stark Industries and he did a great job of it. And finally, Natasha was in charge of legal and she was ruthless. Nobody wanted to mess with SI after she’d gotten done with them.
“Um… There’s something I really want you to see. I’ve been practicing this ever since the competitions ended. Will you watch?” Anthony said to Hope as he’s in his skates on the rink.
Steve and Bucky were happy with their jobs. Working for the new police force gave them a way to use their protective instincts. It also had the added benefit of them being able to take in HYDRA sympathizers who just wanted to cause trouble.
“Tony, something is going on with our babies. They’re not socializing as much with us before they started the school year and are acting strange. I’m very worried about them.” Steve said as he brushed his hand through his hair before taking a sip of his coffee.
Emmie: Sorry for the delay in this chapter update. When you write like 5 chapters in a row, it can wear you out. I hope this chapter was worth the wait.
It was 3:30 PM in the late afternoon and their kids would be coming home from school that day. Both Tony and Steve stood by the kitchen as they waited for their babies to walk in the door as normal. Pretty soon, all 9 kids walked in the door and sat their backpacks down at the dining table before plopping down on the living room couch.
And can you guys take a guess at what the beginning part of the next chapter will be? You'll just have to read until the end. Have fun!
Steve looked straight into Tony’s eyes and replied “I do. With all that I am. You gave me a home, a purpose, and most importantly, a second chance.”
Steve then swiftly stripped out of his clothes and worked his hands on Tony’s body. He dragged one of his hands down Tony’s chest before then taking a hold of his cock and started pumping him. Tony started breathing quickly from the pleasure Steve is giving him. It didn't take long before he came all over Steve’s chest and hand. He blushes from what just happened but Steve is quick to act.
"Save it," Tony interrupted. "Let's just get through this first and then we can-" Tony stopped as he noticed Steve's hand. "Is that my ring?"
“Midnight is all groomed and fed your majesty.” The servant spoke as he held the reins of the horse.
“”I won, didn’t I? So who really cares? Quit nagging me already.” Harley said as he walked with Steve over to their coach Nick Fury.
“Mrs. Stark! You’ll never guess who I have with me!” Pepper said as she stood next to Tony who had his luggage in hand.
“Stand your ground men, King Howard will not be an easy fight. He has one last chance to back down. If he refuses to stand down, fight and don’t hold back.” Steve spoke to his men.
“Pietro called River a stupid Omega and Wanda ruined Rowan’s painting that he made of us all by smearing black acrylic paint all over the canvas,” Sarah spoke as she looked at the twin boys who still seemed to be upset from what happened to them.
Steve nodded in response and gave Tony a kiss on the lips. “Goodbye my dear, you stay here where it’s safe.” he spoke before exiting the room with Bucky.
Being an only child in a well off pack should have been the best thing to ever happen to Tony. He should have been happy and well cared for. He should have never wanted for anything. He should have been safe.
Steve found himself on the day of their wedding in a side room off the lobby of the church. He was first in the entrance procession, and Tony was last, so he was waiting for the cue from Bucky that it was time to start. He did his best to keep calm as he looked at himself in the full-length mirror. He was in full dress uniform and had spent a lot of time the night before shining his shoes until he could see his reflection and polishing his medals until they gleamed. Steve clutched his Captain’s hat in his hands and didn’t know why he was so tense. He had faced world-ending threats, as well as being on the run from the government for years. But he and Tony had fought so hard to get here, he didn’t want anything screwing that up. At that moment, the door opened, interrupting his musings.
“Right,” Tony replied, all business. There was so much that needed to be said between them, but this wasn’t the time or the place. At the moment, they had a job to do. “Guess we’d better get inside and start planning.”
“Let me look at him Steve, I specialize in shifter medicine so I might know what’s wrong. Just set him on the ground,” spoke Bruce as he rolled up his sleeves and watched Steve set Tony on the floor of the room.
Before the Alpha got 5 feet away from Tony, there’s a growl coming from nearby. Tony and the Alpha look to where the growling is coming from and they see a golden wolf inching closer and closer to them.
As he got to the bottom of the escalators, Tony gasps when he comes across posters of him with some of them saying that his hometown was rooting for him.
“Ahh...Ahh..Steve! More please MORE!” Tony screamed out as he rolled his hips against Steve’s cock and moaned at the moment he felt it.
After Tony snuck away from the cabin, he headed to the nearby city of Denver in his wolf form to gather some supplies for the cabin and for the garage. With him, he had a satchel around his neck in wolf form to carry his stuff in while he looked around.
“Well luckily for you, I haven’t just been sitting around twiddling my thumbs,” Tony said as he hit a button and panel in the wall slid back, revealing a brand-new Captain America suit. “I assume it’ll fit, I didn’t exactly have your current measurements while designing it.”
Steve just laughed and shook his head, wishing he'd decided to draw the pout Tony was currently sporting. "No Tony. Not until it's done. You don't judge the winner of a race half way through." He explained, it was a crap example and he knew it but it seemed to work well enough.
Bucket man scoffed at this, turning and booting the bucket to the other end of a car park. At least that's what it looked like. The small woman simply ignored him and continued her speech.
The apartment block was small and homey in comparison to his tower in the central city, and it was less modern than his home in Malibu. That's why Tony had one, it was a hide out, a get away from the life of the billionaire. He sometimes took dates he particularly liked there, it was often a place he could go to escape from the press as well. He didn't have a lot there, not in his terms anyway. JARVIS wasn't installed there, he didn't have any bots, the one thing he did have was quiet. And alcohol, lots of alcohol. He was sure he had two bedrooms as well, one may or may not be filled with 'fun' toys when the need arose.
Tony chuckled, untucking his feet and resting them atop Steve's thighs. "Oh really?" He asked, a broad grin on his lips, lighting up his eyes, softening his entire face.
"Steve, was it something I said? I didn't mean to blurt it out like that, it was gonna have way more tact than that..." Tony proclaimed, reaching a hand forward to flatten Steve's hair, his fingers carting through the thick mass of gold. Instinctually, Steve leaned into the touch, craving it now more than ever.
Sorry for it being  day late, real life got in the way. As always any and all mistakes are my own (and I read through it tho time :D) enjoy :).
"Can you sit up at all?" He asked, in response, Tony lifted up onto one elbow, plenty enough to take tablets. Steve smiled his thanks and handed over two aspirin, as well as a fresh bottle of cooled water. He watched intently as Tony took the tablets, his hand hovering nearby just in case Tony spilt anything. Thankfully, he didn't, just a small dribble escaped his mouth. Luckily Steve was there just in time to catch it, rubbing his thumb near the corner of his mouth to dry it.
"I was curious, wanted to see if you were as good as the stories I heard." Tony explained, paying special attention to the pencil still in his fingers. "Could you maybe draw something for me? So I can see how much I really should have listened to dad?" He asked quietly, Steve would have thought he was joking only Tony was concentrating hard on the pencil, and his voice had been smaller than he'd ever heard it. "Okay." Steve agreed before his brain had chance to think about it and back out.
“I am, which means I don’t want to fight with him again on the same topic. He’s angry, Nat. You wanna argue with him before he’s had a chance to be rational then you go right ahead. But you’ll be wasting your time and I know you know that.” The voice started to sound irritated, Bucky didn’t like that it was so close to him.
A shrill ring made Tony jerk and scatter the latest piles of paper, thankfully they'd only recently started a new stack and there wasn't many sheets to get jumbled.
. Bucky could vaguely make out a motorbike in the reflection of the elevator doors across from him. He smiled to himself softly, it's exactly the kind Steve would ride,
"A good cry can do that, it releases endorphins or something, I don't know. Ask Bruce." Tony muttered, his hand pulling away, much to Steve's dismay. Instead, Tony took his hand instead, rubbing circles into the back of his hand. "If you want to, we can go and find him today. You don't even have to come with us if you don't want to." Tony suggested, looking down at their joined hands, focussing on the long fingers.
"Bucky, minus an arm. Although we have the arm as well. He's in a bad way Tony, we need to bring him back to the tower. Is there somewhere we can keep him..."
"Could you not have just used the one on your hand?" Natasha piped up glancing down at his arm, Tony's actions piquing her interest.
Tony could understand this kind of agony to a certain extent, he lost Pepper about a month after the invasion of New York. She 'couldn't handle it, she needed to put the company first, would always love him and hoped they could remain friends as they had been before.' Tony hadn't even seen it coming, he'd been to focused on the clean up, a giant shark infestation (which would have been fine if they hadn't developed ways of breathing out of water) and about a thousand other things. But then, in retrospect, that probably was a sign in itself.
"The captain slept approximately two and a half hours last night, sir." The AI dutifully responded. Tony made a noncommittal noise and rose to his feet, holding out his hand for the soldier. "Better than 1 hour I guess. C'mon cap, looks like you're on my floor tonight." Steve took Tony's hand, allowing himself to be hauled up, expecting Tony to let go once he was but happily surprised when he didn't.
"Im just gonna grab the water and tablets, do you think you need them now as well?" Steve asked, using a soft voice as he pulled the comforter up. Tony nodded weakly, slowly relaxing his grip and letting Steve go. He wasn't gone long, Tony had barely even takes two breaths before he was kneeling by the bedside once more.
Finally Tony's eyes completed his survey of the room and fell back to Steve. The man himself was hardly visible, he hadn't been eating or sleeping and his skin had a grey tint that made him look ghostly. His cheeks held less, but also more, definition. From what he could see, Tony was willing to bet Steve had lost a lot of muscle. His eyes were the worst, hollow. Yet full of anguish and shame and fear.
"Im gonna have to answer this, you good?" Tony checked, setting his unsorted stack to one side and rising to his feet. Steve looked up and appeared to be slightly guilty, or maybe worried, but nodded anyway, Tony didn't know what else he could do so he pressed green and vacated to the guest room.
Bucky’s head had fallen forwards contently, a slight pleased shiver running down his spine as Natalia worked. Was this what it felt like to bathe normally? He couldn’t remember having this before he enlisted.
A hand was placed gingerly on his shoulder, slowly curling around the back of his neck when it wasn't shrugged off.
"So, do I get to know the name of my hero?" He asked conversationally, trying to redeem himself with compliments. The guy above him snorted, apparently he disagreed with his title.
"Joy, I have to sit through that all over again..." He mumbled, throwing his arms up and stalking to the elevator, throwing the pencil in Steve's general direction, it looping twice in the air before falling seamlessly into Steve's waiting palm.
"You would be..." Natalia chuckled, bringing the shower head back up and washing the suds out. There was clearly a big history he was missing between himself and the Widow.
"You're right, they do. Only in mine, one of the two bedrooms has a headboard with re-enforced metal bars-" one corner of Tony's mouth quirked up seductively. "-it also has two posts at the foot of the bed which are also re-enforced..." Tony had taken a step closer, pressing his hand to Steve's heart, now racing as realisation dawned on him. "One cupboard has a wide range of handcuffs, straps and restraints that need their strength and durability testing-" Steve's breath hitched and Tony's voice dropped a few octaves. "The bedside table drawers are categorically filled with various toys and vibrators that have so far been unused." Tony's smile was now downright dirty and it was all Steve could do not to bend him over and fuck him to next Tuesday, right there out in the open.
"Nope, I just didn't wanna wake you. I could have done though as apparently you weren't even sleeping." He chided lightly, still grinning wide. Tony rolled so he was looking up at Steve, meaning Steve's arm slid onto Tony's chest, palm settling just below the arc reactor.
Half way into the second film and Steve had the foundations of his sketch. Tony's eyes were bright despite them being the most shaded area, his hair was that kind of messy that normal people styled, Tony's just grew that way.
Tony began to gather the sketches of scenery, or ones that didn't really look like much, and stuffed them in place, placing it on the table. He waited for Steve to finish before doing the others, pressing them flatter and tucking them away. When they were done, the two men relaxed back into the cushions, Tony watching Steve intently.
"I... Er... No, to both." Steve said, shaking his head and blinking a few times to clear the fog preventing coherent thought. That would have been a whole lot easier if Tony wasn't smirking like a smug bastard because he could tell Steve was lying. "I was watching the film..." He stated lamely.
"Do it," he pleaded, knowing he could never be what he was, a hero, a friend, a brother. "I deserve it," he added, pressing his neck forward into the knife edge.
The more Steve watched Tony the more he realised that drawing him may not have been as easy as he'd first thought. Especially with the way he was focussed on the film, it giving him an intellectual look that was so very slightly different from that of his everyday concentration; more relaxed. Unlike when he worked on his numerous projects; the times Steve had seen him work, Tony had looked tense and wound tight. The small crease between his brows often betrayed the blatant disinterest that occupied the rest of his face.
“Yeah, and you’re a brainwashed assassin.” He smiled in a no-nonsense way, shooing Clint out of the way and taking his place, setting the tray on the bedside table. “So, you have an infection and need antibiotics, you’re seve-“
"I want you on your back okay?" Tony asked, running the heel of his hand up Steve's sweaty spine. He nodded and took some deep breaths, letting Tony get to work releasing him before he rolled over. The toy was still inside but it was more comfortable than pleasurable, sure it was nice but he had grown used to the sensations from the plug earlier.
"Come on Steve, let's go. You need some decent sleep and I need you somewhere JARVIS can check on you." He borderline pleaded, standing and tugging the weak Captain to his feet.
"Right, yes... Sorry. Yes or no questions. I don't care about your opinion but I'm gonna ask anyway: I'm gonna fetch a laser component and an old repulsor, you'll wanna stand far away and to the side, it might get messy...that okay?" His tone didn't leave much room for comment but Tony heard two knocks nonetheless. Ignoring them completely, Tony pressed the button for his workshop, hoping no one would be waiting for him.
"Yeah, his floor is kinda shut down at the moment. No one allowed, not even him," Clint explained, his voice still icy cold but softer than it had been at their first meeting. "I like the nickname though," he added with a mischievous grin.
"Yeah, just... Maybe need a minute..." He slurred, bending his knees and stretching them out again, flinching at the crack of his joints. Tony nodded and took the ankle restraints back to their cupboard. He then disappeared to the bathroom and returned with the oil and a bowl of steaming water which he left on the bedside table.
Tony winced and hissed, the towel had partially dried to his hair, the wound re-opening slightly. "Owww." He complained, trying not to pull away.
"Yeah man, I'm good to go again." He shook himself a little, stretching his arms above his head and Steve didn't miss how he winced when his shoulder clicked. Shaking his head, Steve ducked under the elasticated barrier, reaching for his water bottle.
But of course a Stark could never be so lucky, he realised too late that Pepper was his one good thing. He'd fucked that up, what hopes did he have with a Super Soldier?
"Im glad you like it, now get over here and give me your mouth." He ordered with a teasing slap. Steve quickly turned and knelt before Tony, the movement causing more stimulation inside him.
"Let's go then, don't have any time to waste." He growled, pulling Tony into the block and letting him take the lead.
"My sketchbook, I can't find it! I had it yesterday! I put it on the table and it's not here!" He said, hands skimming over the cluttered contents of the table, lifting more boxes and books, still not finding his most private possession, it was almost like a diary, there were sketches of people in there he didn't want others finding out about.
Feeling a soft palm on his right shoulder, Bucky looked over to see Natalia holding out the bottle of water, pre-opened. He was unsure if he would be okay with it as he hadn't drunk for a few days but considering he had once been able to drink coffee he decided it would be okay.
The petite redhead turned and looked at him expectantly, gesturing to the deep bath. Frowning, Bucky went to step inside the slightly steaming water but Natalia placed her hand on his wrist, pulling him back with a slight shake of her head. What was she trying to tell him? What is it he needs to do?
“That was Bruce, he’s our resident medic, biologists and occasional angry giant green avenger.” She explained, only confusing Bucky more. “Basically, he’s the one who knows what strength antibiotics you need for the infection that’s making its way around your body. He also has the knowledge required to work out what nutrients you need to get you back to a functioning level of health. All of this, if you consent of course.”
"Ahh, fuck! Oh my god!" Steve cried, his body pulling taut on all the bindings. Tony laughed, obviously pleased a the results. He then began to move it, pulling in and pressing down, rubbing and circling, generally just toying. Steve squirmed around on the bed, the restraints clashing against the metal making a vague rattling sound. He soon became a mess of moans and whines, laboured breathing with a few 'please sir's and expletives thrown in.
"I nibbled...." Steve muttered resentfully, allowing Tony to pull him up out of bed. "Tony please, it's not an issue." He whined, doing his best to dig his heels in and making things harder. Tony halted the progress he'd made in pulling the captain by abruptly stopping and coming face-to-chin with Steve.
"Too late Mr Stark. I already recognised you-" oh shit yeah, he'd forgotten, "-you didn't really explain why you were hidin' though." He continued, hints of a Brooklyn accent creeping through.
"You actually drawn anything yet or have you been too awed by my good looks?" Tony asked, shocking Steve out of his thoughts and into the liquid chocolate pools that were Tony's eyes. His pupils bleeding into his iris, now just a thin ring surrounding an abyss of black.
"I know, I'm sorry. I'm almost done..." Steve said, squeezing a little more before returning the tube and slowly releasing his fingers. "It's a glue, it helps bind wounds together so it can start the healing process quicker. Much better than stitching, more sterile, and honestly, it's less painful." Steve patted Tony's hands against his waist but didn't force them off. Simply reached over for a bandage and a dressing, placing one down and then using the bandage to secure it. He pinned it in place and then pulled back. 'There, good as new...' He mumbled, smiling down softly. Tony smiled lazily up at him, eyes drooping a little. "We ought to get you to bed, I'll leave another bottle of water on the side and a couple of pills. Then I can take you back to where ever it is your really staying." Steve planned aloud, collecting the bits of rubbish and everything from his kit, placing it back in its place while still not forcing Tony to let go.
"That's just Clint, cap. He once broke his wrist and carried on fighting, the idiot doesn't know when to stop." She said fondly, earning a very childish 'blah blah blah, whatever' from Clint. He looked dead on his feet this time, worse than Steve did. It had helped to a certain extent however, the sparing had helped him get rid of the energy sparking in his muscles, exhausting him to the point where he could relax. The hunt for Bucky hadn't been successful so far.
She simply took her time to explain. Bucky decided that he could trust the instincts of the asset inside him, so far everything she said had been true and in no way hostile towards him.
"Test." Tony instructed. After the first couple of times where something ended up broken, they always tested it against Steve, he often ended up pulling very hard and coming free from the restraints, which really defeated the purpose. Steve took a deep breath, grasping the bar for leverage and began pulling. After 30 seconds he stopped: nothing bent or broken, perfect. Tony let out a triumphant little giggle before moving down to tie his ankles up, instructing him to do the same, it gained the same result and Tony literally clapped with joy.
“Fine. Whatever. There’s no good way to do this. Better sooner rather than later.” Nat decided, sounding frustrated.
Steve lavished Tony's head, licking along the underside, very lightly grazing his teeth over it and licking the slit often, being sure to catch anything Tony leaked. He took more in his mouth and hollowed his cheeks, sucking hard and grinning when Tony moaned loudly. Steve went deeper still, taking a deep breath before swallowing Tony down, his nose brushing the soft hair at the base. Tony whimpered, using his grip to pull Steve off as he didn't want to come just yet.
“Your point is? Just tell me, okay?” Tony softly urges. “I fine- just, I... I love you, okay?” Steve turns his face away, both of them stopped walking. “You... what?” “I know, you think it’s weird and-“ Tony leans in to Steve, giving him a kiss to the mouth “Shut up, Steve”
“I’ve been studying you, you know?” Tony informed him, reaching over and pulling out a lollipop from Steve’s front pocket.
He remembers Steve- Steve sketching in his worksop, Steve cooking breakfast, Steve’s bright blue eyes, Steve gleaming after his morning run, Steve being- Steve. Steve who’s with him now, Steve who’s next to him.
Tony blinked before stumbling to correct himself, “Not like that. I find it funny when what is assumed of me dies because I know it wont ever go away. Yes you all believe in me, but... its supposed to be irony. In a way.”
“No, Tony. I... I could’ve helped you, I could’ve been there for you. But you know what I did? I betrayed you, I left you, I let you die” Steve takes a deep breath here, his palms covering his mouth.
Steve frowned and opened his mouth but the front door opened before he could even let out a breath. The door was shut and footsteps followed, echoing in the house. A man walked by him, and Steve watched as Tony straightened and leaned forward, his lips captured by the other man’s lips in a fierce and searing kiss. They separated, Tony breathless and eyes blown, and the man turned. Steve felt his breath catch.
Tony hummed as he pulled the wrapper off, throwing it behind him, and placing the candy into his mouth. After a second he pulled it out and ran a pink tongue over it.
Tony mentally shook his head. If something was coming, they would be ready for it. The Boggart could’ve just been trying to make him paranoid. Scared. It worked but Tony knew that if something big was coming, they would be able to handle it. They were stronger together than they were apart.
“You’re just... you. You’re beautiful.” Tony is seriously starting to get tired- Steve is so stubborn.
“Okay. And?” Tony raises an eyebrow- is that supposed to be new? “I- I don’t know, I mean you’re a nice chap and all and I- never mind” Steve cuts himself in the middle of the sentence, Tony despises it when someone does that.
"You looking for this?" bucket man jeered, waving the what could be called scrap metal, arm in his general direction. "You pulled it off yourself. We have a specialist who's gonna’ take a look at it. You are gonna’ stay here and we will ask you questions, how's that sounding?" he continued, tone casual and light-hearted yet still sinister, managing to both irritate and unnerve Bucky.
"You woke up once in the middle but It didn't take long for you to get off to sleep again, think you might have been dreaming. You okay?" He checked, resisting the urge to stroke down his chest, friends didn't do that.
He could remember very little of young Bucky, with bright blue, shining eyes too big for his head, soft brown hair that was just too long and tickled his nose when it fell in front of his eyes, the brightest smile in Brooklyn, or so he'd been told by his mother. He had more memories of the soldier, Sergeant James Barnes; cap tilted to one side, lucky with the dame's, glimpses of a skinny best friend he couldn't protect from across the pond. Then dead Bucky, at least that's how he'd wanted to be lying in the freezing lab, syringes had never been his favourite. He was glad he couldn’t remember the fall just yet, but he knew it happened. He read as much in the museum exhibit, every so often he thought he heard the
The memory generated a wave of sadness that in turn created deep pools in his eyes that spilled over the lip of his eyelid and onto the sharp plains of his cheek, only to cling for life on his chin but being unable to hold the weight when two more droplets gathered there. Deep sobs took over the hyperventilation, his shoulders shaking from the sheer force of it, probably scaring Tony even more. His hand fisted in Tony's shirt, holding on as if it was the one thing keeping him together. The man before him shuffled closer and wrapped two strong arms around him, resting his chin on the blondes cranium.
“Yeah, I know. I was squatting in a derelict bar, or restaurant, not sure which. I had some files, they’re probably useful to you all. Oh, the red book too, Stark might have particular interest in that…” he turned back around, looking at Bruce again. “A cat adopted me, she’s white under the dirt. Called Alpine. I hope she’s still there…” he gave Bruce a small smile, hoping it made him seem less intimidating. “Place called… Pinocchio’s, I think it was called, had wood nailed on the windows, smelled a bit… smoky.”
They were driving back to the apartment when it happened. At first, Tony didn’t see the reason for it, but suddenly Agent Rumlow swore and took a sharp turn to the left.
“Fine, fine. Keep your secrets,” Stane relented in a soft voice. “Why are you still here this late? Have you forgotten about the meeting tomorrow?”
“Nice to meet you, Mr Stark.” She looked professional enough in her neat light bob and pantsuit, but there was something in her smile that Tony didn’t like.
Stevens shuddered in obvious excitement and foolishly, Tony suddenly felt that he missed the fierce blue gaze on him as if the locking of eyes was something he needed when having sex. As if he was about to make love to somebody he actually cared about.
Tony swallowed, and willed for the man to turn so he could see his face, but there was only a sliver of a profile. It must be a mistake: his young brain was playing tricks on him. Wouldn’t be the first time.
“Baby, listen. It’s our song.” Tony gasped and stood up, turning up the volume a little louder, “Come here.”
I believe you will be great one day. You will prove to those who doubted you or those who said you are your father, wrong. I know you. We all do. You can’t rely on what an abusive father, a creepy advisor, and a boggart tell you. We believe in you. I believe in you. That’s all that should matter.”
The Ravenclaw gripped his wand and opened his mouth to speak but found himself speechless. The boggart grinned and slowly began to walk up to the stunned wizard. Tony opened his mouth to speak again but the boggart talked first.
Tony curled himself tighter against Steve’s chest. He still felt so cold. Steve grabbed a throw blanket from the back of the couch they were sitting on. He quietly wrapped them both in the blanket as Rhodey pulled out his tablet from under the couch.
Two quiet hisses of air and almost silent thuds of bullets. The Captain carefully slid his weapon back in its holster.
Just as he reached to unlock the front door, there was an audible click. Then slowly the door swung open. A soft tune reached his ears, and Steve tensed before reaching underneath the bottom of his wheelchair to pull out a small handgun that he carried everywhere with him. He softly closed the door behind him, glancing around to examine anything that could’ve been taken. He stayed silent to listen for any kind of movement, since he could still not see a big part of the living room. He could only hear the soft music playing on his record player. Louis Armstrong, his mind supplied.
So Tony worked hard for over 14 months to get the world ready. He had been so busy with slowly gaining the world’s trust, all while making Stark Industries grow exponentially, that he hadn’t gone to visit the familiar face. His watch on his wrist let out a small chirp, making Tony’s smirk widened into a grin.
Tony let his white and blue suit slowly wrap around his body, making sure to leave his throat exposed. He groaned at the roaming hands, letting lust fill his senses, cloud his mind, stir his cock. It had been too long since this. Too long of not being able to dance with each other, to breathe another one’s scent so intimately. The night before had been fast and hard and so so rough.
The Captain slowly walked over to his husband, whose hips were slowly swaying. He gently wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist and pressed his back to the Captain’s front. With the other hand, he wrapped around the genius’s throat. The latter groaned and leaned his head back to expose his throat, letting the Captain leave a trail of kisses and bite marks. The song continued, with the two couples slowly swaying against each other.
The boggart screeched and trembled before falling over. As soon as he hit the ground, its body began to crack like cement. With a loud snap, the boggart crumbled like a fallen rock statue.
“Who the hell are you? Get out. I will call the Avengers.” Steve warned, already pulling out his phone.
“Riddikulus!” Tony yelled, his arm straight as an arrow, knuckles white from gripping his wand too hard.
At first, they both walk in silence, both of them thinking individually. “So um- Steve, how long will this take?” Stupid, stupid question, Tony. “I don’t know exactly, but the goddess did say something about it just taking a bit of us?” Steve answers, his mouth twisting.
Tony’s face twisted into a nasty scowl. His cold blue eyes danced with fury, “I was never yours to begin with.”
“Tony, my home wasn’t the Avengers. It wasn’t the tower, or the mansion, or SHIELD. It was... you. You gave me a home, just you- and that’s when- that’s how I realized I was in love with you.”
“Of course. Of course I would be narcissistic enough for my wort fear to be myself.” Tony grumbled, “Could’ve been dear old dad or even Stane. I could’ve handled that. But no. It had to be myself. Not surprised though.”
“The man of Iron, Anthony Stark. My my” a strange lady greets him appearing out of thin air, startling Tony. “Jesus fuck please do it more subtly I have a heart condition” Tony slowly moves his hand to rub his chest where his scar and reactor is supposed to be to find nothing but a blank spot.
“It’s not your fault” Tony responds to Steve’s apology. “I failed to save you- I couldn’t get to you in time, I’m sorry” Steve- Steve seems so sad, Tony just wants to hug Steve. “Hey cap, you tried your best, okay? It’s okay, we're together now” Tony embraces Steve softly, which was returned shortly by Steve, the two of them being each other’s anchor for just a bit.
When Tony stepped up to face the boggart, he smirked at his friends. They smiled at him reassuringly, Nat even grinned as they thought about who would pop up. They knew Howard had to be shown. Tony, while never truly showing his fear for his abusive father, had always acted nervous and skittish around him.
Steve heard shifting, the sound of clothes, or something similar anyway. He turned and ran in the direction, checking each ally only to be bombarded by more noise: foxes in bins, music from clubs, the harsh moans of someone being pounded against a wall, laughter, his own feet against the ground, someone calling his name...
Until he couldn't, he began to whimper as he came, trying to thrust into Tony's hand. A hand that was swiftly removed so Steve's first orgasm was ruined, thirsting into thin air for any kind of sensation. His erection twitched and the head shone with the little he did come but he was left frustrated and in Tony's 'bad books'.
"I haven't peeked, don't worry." He said blatantly, looking in the reflection of one of his monitors back at Steve. "I wanted to, believe me I did. Oh and Jarvis, next time I tell you to keep something quiet I expect you to do as I ask as that's what I programmed you to do." He spat, clearly more annoyed than usual at his AI.
Tony smiled, sitting up and throwing the duvet off his very warm, still jean clad legs. "Breakfast?-ish. Brunch. Pancakes?" He asked, bending his knees and stretching them out. He watched Steve shake his head and rest a hand over his stomach. The top that was once very tight fitting now had room to spare, Steve's ribs just making an appearance. Tony hoped that 4 times times the metabolism meant 4 times less work to re-build the muscle.
Tony gradually became more paranoid, Natasha threatening to castrate him slowly in his sleep didn't help that either. In fact, Clint and Sam had become very hostile towards Tony, not that he could blame them, Steve could be dead for all they knew and it would all be Tony's fault.
For Tony to nod without any further consideration. He even escorted him there, giving him a tight hug and a chaste kiss to his jaw before waving the wounded soldier off.
Bucky startled as a disembodied voice echoed through the basement. He clung to the chain at his wrist for no reason other than to have something to hold.
"Front." He decided, breathless. Tony plucked the blindfold up from his chest and raised up enough for Steve to turn to his belly, his breath hitching when his dripping erection pressed against the sheets. Tony then ran his thumbs into the large muscle at Steve's shoulders, loosening them and forcing him to relax. He had very skilled hands, Tony claimed never to have been taught anything but Steve didn't believe it. From that, Tony's hands migrated up Steve's left arm, squeezing the hand tightly before wrapping the cuff around the wrist, he then did the same to the right: rhythmic and ordered.
"I was feeling kind tonight but since you disobeyed early on I'm going to make tonight very difficult. I hope you like being edged Steve." He hissed, fitting his role perfectly. Steve nodded obediently, parting his legs wider in wait for what was to come. Tony chuckled and stroked his back softly, a gesture to show this was just an act and he would come out of it at any point if Steve needed it. Contact was lost and Steve heard the click of a bottle top, then came the feeling of one of Tony's fingers against his entrance. Steve relaxed instantly, letting out a small moan, it had been well over a month since he's been penetrated and God had he missed the feeling. Soon came a second finger and Steve groaned loudly, pushing himself back into Tony's fingers.
apartment?" He continued cryptically. Steve nodded again, this time slower and more thoughtful, his eyes narrowing as the cogs began to turn. "Well, the other day I realised that not only had I not been here in about 10 months, but also that you've never seen it at all." He smiled that proud little smile he got when JARVIS did something unexpected. Steve couldn't really understand why this was important, most of the apartments looked the same anyway. He voiced this as gained a dramatic sigh of frustration from his lover.
"Sorry spangles, but you've just boosted my ego by about 10. And the team will agree that it didn't particularly need a boost." He grinned lazily, shuffling around so his head was now resting on Steve's thigh, which was more than a little inconvenient considering he was actually going to draw during the next film.
He clung to the soft white t-shirt that was blocking his vision. Huh, when did that happen? Although he didn't really care, Steve was holding him tightly, rubbing his back and muttering apologies in his ear. Not that he had anything to apologise for but oh well, Tony needed the comfort right now. And yes he knew that was selfish but he was known to be self-centred. He did this, he allowed Steve to be on his own, he helped search for Bucky...
Tony took one small step towards Steve. He stayed vertical. So he tried again, also successful. Thinking the rest would be fine, Tony attempted his usual swagger on his short walk over to mystery man. Well he would have done if, after another two paces, he didn't trip up over his own feet and went headfirst into the side table with a very ungraceful 'oof'.
It was real! Steve was alive! And communicating with him! With Tony. When he hadn't with anyone else. Tony laughed joyously, a hysterical giggle two octaves too high.
"Thank you..." He whispered, not being capable to do anything louder. As Steve pulled the rucksack over his shoulder, his sleep shirt rose and Tony couldn't help himself. He could see where the muscles shape a 'V' pointing down to his groin, a small trail of darker hair leading from his belly button down into pyjama pants. Acting on impulse, Tony pressed a kiss to one hip.
"Given the weight loss and accelerated metabolism, I would say Captain Rogers hasn't eating anything, other than the tomato soup you provided yesterday, for approximately 14 days, sir." JARVIS' deep monotone was like a comfort blanket draped over Tony's shoulders now he knew Steve was under his watchful eye.
"Steve?" There was his name again, on Tony's lips. Steve had been so blind-sighted by Bucky that he had forgotten the man behind their recent success, the one who held him through the sobs that shook through him earlier that morning.
So, hello. I'm sorry, I don't really have an excuse, I'm just a bit rubbish. I hope you like it anyway.
Natalia tilted her head, crossing her arms and shifting her weight. “You get a choice to receive it now, or we wait until the infection likely gets worse and you get it when you’re unconscious.” She shrugged. “See we still want you alive, if not for your sake then for Steve’s”
Instinctively, Bucky reached under the back of Natalia's jacket and pulled out the knife he somehow knew was hidden there. He hadn't seen her put it there, and it hadn't been visible at all. This was learned, muscle memory. Unfortunately, his confusion about the knife meant Clint was able to swiftly kick it out of his hand, it clattered on the dark wooden flooring and under a cabinet out of sight.
"No your not, this is my fault, I'm going to be the one to fix it. You've all been on my case for God knows how long, I'm not about to let you claim the limelight." He argued, waiting calmly for the elevator doors to open before pushing The Widow out, it wasn't difficult as she was quite small and not expecting him to react in such a way. He grinned and waved a metal clad hand as the doors closed, preventing Tony from hearing her various, creative insults.
"What the fuck do you want, birdbrain?" He hissed, trying to keep his voice down. "I was doing really well with Steve, I got him to eat and shower an he even talk-"
"I have less of a refraction time remember?" He joked, forcing Steve onto his back and laying upon him. "I'm gonna restrain you now, if you need out just say. Ooh, how about a blindfold?" He chirped, pressing soft kisses to Steve's neck, who's eyes had lit up at the mention. Surprisingly, this was something they hadn't tried before, blindfolding was never suggested and now the idea of it made Steve's cock jump.
