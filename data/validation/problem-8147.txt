“Um… Mr. Stark. He actually hasn’t said anything.”
Steve wanted to say no. He wanted to keep what he drew private. Tony had absolutely no reason to see his drawing, and Steve had every reason not to let Tony see the damn thing. Tony may be acting like a giant flirt around him, but there was no clear indication that Tony would even be okay with how Steve perceived their relationship. And his sketch clearly showed what he thought about their relationship.
“But you never said anything.”
“No,” Steve fumed. The word came out as a low growl, rage threatening to tear the nearest person apart at the seams.
if you can. They've work really hard and I could not have done this without their help.
Sam slouched over. “It’s either that, the black market, or death by slow extermination. Your choice Steve, but I don’t see many other ways out of this.”
Look at Steve as a prime example, age of 16 and ready to come out, only to be scared off by radical conservative expectations and legalization. Ended up joining the service for a few years to help out the family back home. But when the stock market crashed and a wave of polio swept through his neighborhood, Steve was the first to quit the force to fight the good fight on the home front. He didn't make the money like he did in the force, in fact he didn't make any money at all. So he turned to bootleg, the lesser of evils, as a service to others and a way to provide for himself. In his defense, drugs, prostitutes, and firearms would make his late mother faint faster than bootleg ever would.
Steve heard the familiar cocking of a gun and his shoulders dropped. He really didn’t need to be dealing with this right now. "Buck," he said, not letting his eyes wander from Tony. "Put the gun away. We have a guest."
“Well, you’re not lacking any of that here,” Tony said with a sultry wink.
“Why?”
“What? No. No! Do not do that. Absolutely do not do that. Under no circumstance should you do that. Ever.”
Silently, Tony watched them drive off. When the car was a few klicks away, he got into the back of the van with Steve. Happy closed the doors on them with a somber nod, banged on the back door, and off they went.
Tony’s attention was immediately piqued. “Now see, this is exactly why I didn’t tell you I was Iron Man in the first place,” Tony said with a salty lit to his voice. “Being a mob boss is a dangerous line of work, and I refuse to drag you into this mess.”
“I’m not talking about just the bomb,” Sam said, giving him an exasperated eye roll. “I’m talking about everything else. Your deception, your secrets, if you had just helped Steve straight out or told him who you were, none of this would have happened.”
For the moment, Steve was using a combination of six boxes and a pallet as a makeshift seat and table. Actually, all the Brooklyn Boys used the empty crates as unofficial seats. During rum runs, the crates were removed from the room, leaving it bare until the boys returned with the empty crates to use, once again, for sitting spots until they were needed once again. Occasionally, they ended up short a crate if one of them ran into trouble or caused trouble on the way back.
“Listen Joe,” Steve snarled. “I’ve had a pretty bad night all things considering, and if you want to stay in one piece, you’re going to tell me who you are and who you work for.” He lightly pushed the blade passed the cloth for emphasis and felt a reassuring red warmth trickle down his fingers.
“Tony tried to tell me to forget about it. Like that will help any. If he tells, fuck, who am I kidding, of course he’s going to tell. Family comes first. Family always comes first.” He hung his head between his legs. “Can’t fucking deal with this right now, Sam. I can’t fucking do this anymore.”
“Sure there is,” she reassured him with an all knowing smile. Natasha pulled away, giving Steve a little space as she thought aloud about the specifics. “Knowing Barnes, he’ll want the shiniest meat-cycle I can find.” She began pacing back and forth, muttering in Russian under her breath. “Can you give me a few days to shop around before I report back?” she asked. “Little rusty when it comes to the local intel, but I should be able to find something.”
A strong hand squeezed Steve’s shoulder. “Hey,” said Sam, his voice low. “You okay?”
“And I said no,” chastised Tony, though there was a teasing smile in his voice.
“Tony," Steve said, trying to interrupt his line of thought.
“Do you still love him?” asked Tony.
Steve looked at the clock on the wall. “Little after one?”
“No! I wanna see!” Tony held it over his head like a child. Even a head shorter than Steve, Tony was somehow able to keep the newsprint out of reach.
Spider Baby
Steve was taken aback by Tony’s forwardness. He wasn’t opposed. Far from it. But saying those things out here in public, near other people? Steve tried to think of something to say. Something clean, but with clear boundaries aligned with public values and constitutions. But all that came out was, “Good. It looks good.”
Sam didn’t say anything. He just let go of Steve in shock. Giving into gravity, Steve sat down against the cold brick. Despair washing over him as Sam staggered back. “Shit,” was the only thing Sam could say, rubbing wrinkles into his forehead.
“Wait, he was?” asked Tony.
Tony leaned over the service counter. “Like what?”
The world froze for a second as Steve waited, neither of them moving. It felt like the ground would fall out from under him any minute. Steve’s body trembled, Did he say too much? Was he too forward?  God, why hadn’t he agreed to let Bucky set him up?
“Do you… want this?”
Tony snorted. Oh the wisdom that came with age. “I bet he never swears or poops either.”
Tony could barely believe his ears “Really? Even after all crazy stuff he said.”
Steve’s happiness level dropped. His sad puppy eyes Bucky always talked about were out for sure. “Don’t tell me that they haven’t done anything to congratulate you yet?”
Steve felt his stomach drop. How could people be so cruel? Taking advantage of a person’s position to get what they want. How could people do that? Tony was too swell a guy to be subject to that.
“What do you think we should do? Take him out behind the dumpster and beat him up?”
“Brussel sprouts are disgusting and you know it,” Tony shot back.
"Your neighbor," said Tony as he slowly pushed himself up and brushing the dirt of a large package. "Sharon's a sweet woman. Saw me knocking at your door and told me where to find you. But for an operation like this," he motioned to the crates of bootleg that just so happened to be sunning themselves in exactly the wrong place. "You really should get better security."
Stane didn’t answer. The enduring din of machines and metal over the phone line was about to make Tony sick. He didn’t want this. This was the last thing he wanted to deal with. As he began formulating a plan to drive down himself and destroy the shop once and for all, a loud silence took over the line.
His family would look on with concern at Steve stumbled under the weight, but Steve didn’t care. As long as it gave Tony a reason to look at him, Steve would happily carry every scrap of metal in the village to the forge and back.
And with that, we have run out of pre-written chapters. Sorry about the delay on the chapter. Having a birthday weekend made of suck.
“Everything and nothing.”
Steve let out a quiet laugh. “Don’t they understand the irony?”
“The sketch,” replied Tony as easily as if he were talking about the weather. “I was talking about the sketch. I was making one in the sand before those kids asked for my help.”
Steve slammed his lips against Tony’s. “My room,” he growled.  “Now.”
Natasha stopped pacing. She bent down to Steve’s level and tried to look him in the eye. “Everything okay Steve?” she asked, her voice gentle.  “Last time I saw you, New York hot dogs picked you right up.”
Ms. Pots smirked. “For a company this big, surprisingly only five.”
They stood in silence as Steve tried to catch his breath. Tony had stopped pulling in objection. “Job didn’t come through?”
“Yup” Tony said, swinging his legs back and forth in the air. “Honestly, I’m surprised he can cook. Uncle Obie says, only women need to know how to cook.
“Obviously. Who wouldn’t be hungry after not eating for five days,” Tony said, answering for the wolf. “But now that I know you like fast food sausages, what do you suggest I do? I can’t keep
Steve frowned. He didn’t like being treated like this. Steve wasn’t useless. He could take care of himself. He could clean his own damn hands if he really wanted to. But the longer Steve waited to voice his opposition, the more he thought about how nice it would be to feel Tony’s fingers caressing the back of Steve’s hand. How gentle those rough fingers would be against Steve’s damaged flesh. How intimate and quiet something like this could be.
Tony tried to shrug off puppy Steve’s attention.  “I’m telling you Steve, it’s really not a big deal. Besides, they’re busy with other stuff right now.”
The man shrugged, looking a little lost in the oversized coat (must belong to a neighbor). “Isn’t everyone? I got a telegram last week saying my skills could be of use up here. Don’t got nothing much better to do back home, so might as well take a chance.”
“Are you shitting me!?” Sam nudged Bucky in the side, hard. With a wince, Bucky gave Wilson a hard glare. The bruises for the beating were still a sickening yellow coloring his sides. “What?” he demanded, unhappy at the harsh irritation.
“Only when it’s necessary,” Pepper said in a curt tone.
Steve must have heard because he turned around and glared at the car as it squealed to life and shot off into the dark. “I’m going after him.”
“When you’re human again,” Tony promised. Steve’s ears perked up and Tony couldn’t help but smile as he saw hope reappear in the wolf’s eyes. “When you’re human, I’ll let you out and you can badger me as much as your heart desires.”
“Did he say anything else?” asked Tony, desperate for any other insight the were could provide. “Anything else that proves he’s remembering how to be human?”
“You Tony Stark?” asked a redhead woman as she climbed out of her jeep.
Tony gasped and covered his mouth. “I’ll be good. I promise.”
“It’s… um…” What was a delicate way to say it? “It’s ostentatious.”
“Company warehouses,” Natasha explained. She walked with a purpose deeper into the building, occasionally checking crates for labels or identification. “Places like Oscorp, Hammer Industries, Pym Technologies, and Stark Industries store parts here until they are needed. Think of it like a really big storage shed where you hide stuff you think you’re going to use later, but never really do. It’s a packrat’s dream house.”
“No.” Tony’s curt reply came out more abrasive than he would have liked. “This isn’t your fight Steve.”
Not only was his heart keeping time with the rapid rhythm of his arc reactor, but his mouth was unnaturally dry and his lips were in great need to be wetted by something other than water. Steve wasn't making it easy. His heart-melting smile, those gorgeous blue eyes, the flawless way banter flowed between them. Steve wasn’t making it any easier for Tony to deny his selfish desires.
Tony scoffed. “You doubt my intelligence.”
Steve let out a heavy sigh as he watched the two Tonys bicker. How was this his life? After everything he’d been through, how was it possible as heartwarming and ridiculous as this?
Steve pulled off Tony’s cock with a wet pop. “Too much?” asked Steve with an innocent smile.
And everyone abided by that rule. Except in the morning. And only because it was funny.
He flicked the safety off with a spine shuddering ‘click’ and dug the barrel deeper into Tony’s skin. Licking his lips, Rumlow’s eyes drifted down from the top of Tony’s head to the glowing device in his heart. “This looks important. Wonder what happens when I pull it out.”
Tony bit down on his lip. He did, but the thought of saying it aloud made his stomach flip like one of Morgan’s spring-loaded toys. “Or, and feel free to say no. Because, you know, this might be a bit much-”
Wait, what was it that Tony said? "What do you mean by 'while I still could'? Are you leaving town already?" asked Steve, feeling panic latch onto his lungs.
With his hands as shirt was as clean as he could get, Steve bent down and splashed a bit of water on his face. Steve let out a long sigh. Water ran off his face in large drops. He closed his eyes and allowed himself a moment to breathe.
“I should go.” Steve forced his legs to take him to the door and walk out.
“Almost got ‘em.”
“Take it up with Pepper.”
“What?” Sam looked downright offended.
Was it because Steve was useful to him? Providing him ideas and rum? Steve tried to shake the thought from his head, but it stayed with him like a bad itch.
Tony easily picked up on what Stane was implying. It wasn't that hard, all things considering. But just because he relied on Stane, it didn't make him into a 'yes man' to do Stane's bidding. “A weapon? Obie, we’ve been out of the Great War for more than ten years.”
“No, they don’t,” Tony said between labored breaths. No one needed to know about this. They were both out and proud in the public eye, but some things were better not shared with the world. Some things were better just between the two of them.
“I swear, I’m fine,” Tony insisted. He tried to step around the wolf, but Steve just hugged his side.
"Okay Tony, that's enough." Steve wasn't feeling jealous of Jane. He absolutely was not. He pulled Tony away from where the group was slowly gathering so they would have some semblance of privacy. "What the hell are you doing here?" he whispered.
Sam shrugged. "Sorry Cap. Nothing reliable in the woodworks as of yet. But I'll tell you what little rumor I hear. There's a name being passed around in the back alleys and dark corners of rooms. The Iron Family."
“And that’s bad, right?”
"Nothing unexpected on the perimeter," reported Bucky. " Couple vultures on the west side, but nothing knocking a few heads in didn't fix."
Steve’s mouth fell slack as he searched for the right words. “Tony’s not… That’s not…” Tony had just let out a waterfall of emotion and there was too much to unpack at once. Dammit Howard. How could you do this to your own son?
As the dust began to clear and his hearing returned, Steve heard the ominous sounds of heavy footsteps coming close to them. Through the smoke and dust, a familiarly shaped gray figure emerged. The gray helmet shone in the little moonlight filtering in from the windows as it slowly stomped toward them.
“Can anybody tell me who in their right mind invited Steve to the stake out?” demanded Tony. “Because I sure as hell didn’t invite him.”
Steve ran a hand through the blond of his hair. "Do you think it would be too much to call back the Black Widow."
“And then Happy tracks you down in a Brooklyn dump-”
“So,” said Tony, clearing his throat from the conversation he would rather not have. “I assume you have another reason to be here aside from questioning my sexuality.”
“I heard a rumor that you’re engaged to Mr. Hogan.” Tony’s ears perked. Why hadn’t he heard that rumor? More curiously, why did the rumor exist when he didn’t start it?
Tony spared a glance down at the half empty bottle and took a final swig. “Sorry to disappoint you, Steve. I’m not strong like you. Never was. Never will be. Maybe tomorrow I can pretend to be strong, but not today. I can’t do that today.”
Tony shrugged in ambivalence and turned his back on the conversation. “Doesn’t matter. I’m not going to see him after tonight.”
“I mean… if you’re not opposed to it,” Tony said with a smile. “But maybe after you’ve put on some clothes.”
“You’re right,” Steve admitted. “I did lie to you. But I lied for a good reason; to protect the ones I care most about. And I can’t help but think you did the same.”
“What can I say,” said Bucky, smug face beaming with pride. “Captain America is an influential man.”
Hot tears stung his eyes. “How could he do those horrible things?” asked Steve, trying to hold back as much as he could. “He was lying to me this entire time Sam. What else did he lie about? He never said it with words, but did he lie about liking me?” Steve let out a warm breath into his hands. “I don’t even want to imagine what else he lied about.”
"Then they'll pass right over us. No point in a big bad groups attacking small fry like us."
“Is that code for ‘I’m going to hid in my lab now. Please don’t bother me unless it’s with more coffee?’”
“Not the point Tones.”
“That’s it?”
A high-pitched snap bounced off the stone walls. “That. Sounded like bones breaking.”
He heard a disgruntled grunt from inside and felt the anxiety fall off his shoulders. With knowing fingers, he reached behind the helmet and popped off the grey mask.
“Nat! Do something!”
A few feet away from the desk was a cabinet filled with spirits as well as a small bar counter. Tony walked over to the cabinet and pulled out two bottles, both half full of alcohol. The one with a long neck was filled with a liquid so clear and pure it looked like water. The second bottle was fancier and clearly more expensive. A beautiful amber whiskey lapped the inside the textured glass like waves.
Unceremoniously, Tony stomped back over to Rumlow and ripped off the arm, throwing it as far as he could in the opposite direction. It landed with a less than satisfying clatter less than a few feet from them. “I’m not losing anyone else because of my stupidity,” Tony muttered, trying to reign in his emotions. “Not now. Never again. I’ve seen too many good people die because of me, and I’ll be damned if I add your name to the list.”
Steve let out a strained laugh. “Everything. Your job, my job, all these secrets and lies we’ve been telling each other. And, I think, it’d just be weird. Not a relationship with you. That’d be the most normal thing that’s happened to me all week.”
Rhodey didn’t look happy with that answer, but this wasn’t his choice. It was Tony’s. Just like it was Tony's choice to date Steve. “Well, if you do feel anything, let us know. Natasha is driving. Bruce is trying to sift through the data we salvaged. Bucky would help but he’s, well, Bucky. Clint might know what to do if the kid wakes up. He’s the only one with parenting experience.”
Sam looked around. “What?”
“Gonna be a long night if you have us running around in pairs,” grumbled Bucky.
Dammit! No! Those were not the type of thoughts he should be having. He had a company to run. A reputation to uphold. He could not out himself as a fag at this critical juncture. Admiring a man in a well-tailored suit was fine. Those thoughts in private were fine. But Tony was seconds away from pressing his lips against Steve's just so he could feel the soft, plump, solid weight against his as it reached out with a tantalizing shine and he wrapped himself around- Nope! Not gonna happen!
Young Tony peaked out from behind a rack of heavy coats. He walked toward the two men, hands behind his back as if preparing himself for the emotional backlash.
Tony’s ears perked up and his breath quickened. “What bird?”
“Sam-” There was no way in hell that Steve would tell Tony about his being the boss of the Brooklyn Boys.
Tony wasn’t surprised that the wolf left his dinner to rot, but it didn’t help his growing irritation from an already crap morning.
“Mr. Stark, if I could just have a moment of your time-”
“Good morning!” said Tony with enough chipper to give sparrows a run for their money.
Tony shrugged. “Yeah, I could have but I didn’t want to scare you off. Telling someone you’re a mafia boss isn’t exactly first date material.”
Rhodey winced. “Kid you is harsh, Tones.”
Tony smiled, silently remembering how gorgeous Steve's smile was and how good it made him feel just to hear the guy laugh. His muscles hidden underneath heavily worn clothes were drool worthy, and his stature was so very climbable. Steve’s accent. Steve’s voice. Guy could be a model or a radio personality if he wasn't so set on being on the other side of the paper. It all made his heart beat just a few seconds faster than normal.
“But…”
Steve smiled and it made Tony’s heart melt. “I know this is a little out of nowhere, but would you model for me? I feel like it’s been ages since I last picked up a pencil.”
“Oh, you know, no more than our usual rescue,” Tony said with a tight smile. “Aside from the stubbornness and the anger management issues, he’s been an angel.”
Natasha gave Tony a quick look over her full house. Tony gave her a smile and a quick wave. There was nothing to be worry about. Just Tony making awkward conversation with his crush and making an ass out of himself.
Steve licked his face. No tongue down his throat this time. Not that Tony would have minded. He wasn’t into that kind of kinky stuff, but the thought of Steve, human Steve, doing all sorts of things to him; licking the inside of his cheek, pressing his large human paws against his torso, Steve’s cold human nose nuzzling chest, his hips, his navel, and then his cock, it made something warm and feral curl in Tony’s stomach.
That caught Steve’s attention right away. His spine straightened in anticipation for a fight. He tried not to look or feel too defensive. War Machine was just the hired muscle. His opinion on queers wouldn’t impact the likelihood of a sale, would it? In the pit of his stomach, he knew it could and that idea scared Steve more than anything. Not everyone in New York felt the same ways as they did about people being gay, bi, or other. Steve had faced his fair share of doors slammed in his face because folks were afraid to catch somethin’ unnatural. But it being Tony who had set everything up, Steve couldn’t afford to mess this up and ruin Tony’s good name.
Steve tried really hard not to laugh, but a smile, a smile was an acceptable reaction to a six-year-old trying to use a new word. “Okay,” he said, finally giving in. “But I don’t think any of them are appropriate for kids, so I might have to change a few things.”
He could almost hear her rolling her eyes in contempt. “What desk?” she conceded.
“And, like, you know,” Tony said as he fiddled with an empty coffee mug. “You make really good coffee and I didn’t want you to stop.”
Tony smile disappeared. He didn’t expect that question, but he tried feign disinterest. “Is that the only thing that you guys talk about anymore?” he asked, hopping down from the table, trying to act nonchalant. “But because I’m in a good mood, I’ll answer your question. No, it’s not some doll. Why do you ask?”
With little thought of the consequences, Tony raced over to the billowing gas with Steve following close on his heels.
“Hear what?” Sam asked, voice not quite quiet enough to be a whisper.
Wanna make him pay for my alcohol after everything he’s put me through.
With the stress from life pushing down on him, it would have been natural for Steve to lash out and yell something about ‘not knowing what the fuck they were talking’ about before giving them a thorough facelift. But with Tony saying it in his joking sort of way, Steve blushed pink with embarrassment. "Yeah," said Steve, with a guilty smile as he rubbed a thumb against the back of his hand. "We're working on that."
“What if I help you?”
“Let’s get what we came for and get out of here,” he harshly whispered to his crew. Thor, Sam, and Bucky began packing up and putting lids back where they belonged, but they were too slow. He could see the shake in Sam’s hands as he clumsily dropped the wooden lid down with a defeating clatter. “Now!” hissed Steve.
Tony cocked his head to the side. “A better moment than this? And what do you mean by ‘lack of pictures’? Pictures of what?”
“What do you think?” asked Tony as he stepped out of the Macy’s changing room. He did a little twirl to show off his light-up shoes and blue shirt. An ironed-on copy of Captain America’s shield was sewn into the center of the t-shirt. Tony puffed his chest, trying to make the red, white, and blue symbol seem bigger than it already was.
Schmidt snorted, but he seemed troubled. “The War Monger said nothing about rats.”
Blood rush to Steve’s cheeks. “Tony,” Steve hissed, covering his boyfriend’s mouth. “Not now. Kid just went to sleep. What if he hears you?’
Tony sat up, careful to keep his emotions in check. “Let’s do it." Firm resolve in his voice. "Sooner we catch these guys; the less likely it’ll be that I have to shut down the company.”
Stane smiled. “You know Victor, he likes to gab as long as he can hold breath. I’ll stop by the lab next time I’m free and then we can talk.”
The man’s face lit up. “Oh. Really? You would do that?”
“Drink?” asked Tony, fetching a towel and a whiskey glass out from behind the bar.
Steve walked out of the kitchen with two steaming mugs in hand. He smiled the moment he caught Tony’s eye. “Brought you something to keep you going.”
“Killing me here Pep,” he sang as he unwrapped the fresh morsel.
The wolf didn’t answer, but he also didn’t look put off by Tony’s request.
“Wait, wait, slow down.” Sam grabbed Steve’s agitated body. He pressed down into Steve’s shoulders, centring him in the moment. Patiently, Sam waited for the shaking to subside before asking his question. As Steve slowly adjusted to breathing at regular intervals, Sam asked, in a low and comforting tone, “What happened up there?”
Even if Thor was a fob (fresh off the boat immigrant) he knew some American mannerisms. Enough to know that kissing another man like that was not appropriate. But, being boisterous and lovable Thor, he picked and choose what rules to follow. Partly because he was basically a big blond puppy dog that loved to love others in a very skinship sort of fashion. Mostly because people didn't expect him to know any better and just went along with the charade. And a little bit was because it pissed off Bucky. But Bucky's reaction made the grand gestures of familiarity all the more enjoyable, so who could blame them.
“Tony my boy, how have you been?” Obadiah Stane greeted him with his usual gravitas.
“Sorry,” said the man with the curly hair. “My friend likes to make an entrance.” He held out his hand. “Doctor Bruce Banner. I’m here to taste your stuff.”
Tony stared at the rag for a minute in complete silence. He opened and closed his mouth like a fish, trying to find his words again. “I’m going to kill him,” he finally said with disbelief. “I’m going to kill him, you’re going to help me hid the body, and nobody will be the wiser.”
Bucky gave Steve a foolish grin. "We got a stake in the freezer I can borrow?
Steve shrugged. “Someone’s gotta sacrifice for the team. It’s not like a capable body is just going to come a knocking and offer assistance.”
“Oh come on, Tony. Don’t act like that. Not everybody is lucky enough to have the Howling Commandos swoop in and rescue them from an ambush,” Jan said with a suggestive nudge.
Tony frowned as he mulled it over. He didn’t look happy. But when Tony finally looked up and locked eyes with Steve, his face was filled with determination. He wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist (they only went halfway around, he was so petite) and whispered into Steve’s ear. “Promise me you won’t let me go, okay?”
“Nothing big, just the usual,” Clint said dismissively. “We’re from Boston. Moved here for a change of scenery. You brought War Machine, Rescue, and Hawkeye from your top brass, and everyone else don’t know nothing.”
Like the gentlemen he was, Tony quickly made his escape from the tense room, closing the door softly behind him. Never let it be said that Tony would stay someplace he wasn’t wanted. He clopped down the three stories of wooden steps, silently scolding himself from even thinking that Steve would want him there in a time of need. From the stairs of the second floor, he noticed a familiar black car that some younger immigrant boys were gathered around. A few housewives were whispering speculation amongst themselves on the sidewalk as an inconspicuous shadow on the rooftop across the street darted out of sight.
He looked up. Golden fur dangled in front of his face as the werewolf stood over Tony like an alpha protecting his pups.
Steve's having a bad day.
“Oh for the love of god, shut up!” yelled Steve. Others objectors in the crowd quickly began to raise their voice. A rock flew through the air, pelting Schmidt in the head, and that was the end of that. Schmidt tried in vain to protect himself from the rain of rocks, trash, and insults thrown relentlessly at him from the crowd. He tried to continue on, but the animosity from the crowd was too strong.
"What do they say about our good neighbors?" asked Thor, his voice was boisterous as always, but the glow in his smile revealed the thick sarcasm behind his words.
Bruce shook his head. “The other guy was not happy with how I wanted to proceed with the interrogation. Ended up getting a little punch drunk,” admitted Bruce.
“Can I come in?”
Thanks to kuailong for being awesome!
Steve nodded as he mulled over Tony’s apology.  “You could have told me,” he muttered under his breath.
Bruce raised a questioning eyebrow. “You went out by yourself and a random guy just steps out to shoot you in the shoulder for no apparent reason? Must be some walk if you had to take it in the middle of the night. Do you realize how much of a bad idea that was? What if Clint hadn’t been there to save your stupid ass?”
Eventually, time ran out. The full moon was sinking into the west and the barest hints of daylight began to kiss the eastern sky. The Avengers would be waking up soon and Iron Man would be expected to join them for the morning meeting.
He went in clean. No splash. No mess. Any diver would be envious of his form. But his pride only lasted a second. Cold water enveloped him, stabbing his exposed skin like a thousand needles. It hurt. Tony gritted his teeth and fought through the bone freezing chill. He just had to be patient. It would all be over soon.
Jan laughed. “It’s not for me, silly. It’s for gambling. Someone’s got to remind these boys what a real woman is like.”
Bucky grinned revealing a row of sharp teeth as his brown hair turned long and white. “Yes, I do. It’s Steve. I know exactly what he’s capable of.”
“Here? Are you kidding me?" Tony scoffed. "There is no way they would have bad enough taste to live in a place like this. And even if they did, I would do everything in my power to make sure they didn’t take up residence here. No, we have the good sense to take up residence on Manhattan until they find work. Nothing too fancy, mind you, but anything better than this dump.”
“Let me do this, please? You’re the one that got injured, Steve. Let me be the one to clean you up.”
“But you’ll still wear the engagement ring, right?” asked Steve. “I want to see the guys lose their shit when they find out I proposed.”
Steve groaned. “Tony, we talked about this. Just because you’ve been through worse doesn’t excuse what you’re going through now.”
Steve felt his heart sink a little, and he silently he berated himself. He was not feeling jealous of a guy he just met, he told his sinful heart. He was not! It wasn't possible and it was most definitely not appropriate. “Your friends are back in Boston or here in Brooklyn?”
“Hey, Fluffy,” Tony said as he gently shook the fence. “You got visitors. A human and a werewolf. Thought a visit from your pack might jog your memory.”
don’t do anything. Peter and
Tony rolled his eyes, but he didn’t pull away. “Goddamnit, Rogers. Why are you so cheesy?”
But that band of hard light they had extracted from Tony's body, the feeling of his very existence being twisted and broken when gloved hands burrowed into the beam; that felt too real. Tony had felt fingers moving under his skin, making him and unmaking him in whatever way they pleased. The heat was unbearable. He could have burned alive if he wasn’t submerged in water.
“Hey!” He’s was about to yell at Joe Phil for giving him a fake card, but there’s no sign of Phil anywhere. Steve spun around in agitation, but sees neither hide nor hair of the guy.  This was bad. He ran a few paces in the direction Phil would have gone, desperately looking for some clue as to where he had taken Tony. It was unnerving how much the guy knew, and for Tony’s sake Steve had to stop the guy before he could do any more damage to Tony’s reputation.
The door closed behind her and Tony let out a heavy sigh. God, how could raising a five-year-old be so exhausting and yet so entertaining?
“Mu hum.” The kid opened his large, brown eyes and looked up at Steve with deep reverence. “And then you punched daddy in the face and I go to ride on your motorcycle all the way down to the beach. And then you took me out for ice cream. And then Disneyland. And then, and then, you said we could have a sleepover and stay up until midnight. And then we did. And it was great. And-”
“I don’t want to know what worse is,” Steve said, tightened the cloth around the entry hole. Tony’s face contorted in pain, and then fell into an easy smile. Oh the stories he could tell. He’d have to tell Steve all about them one day. Knowing Steve, his face would most likely drain to a chalk white and he would insist on hanging onto Tony for days on end. Tony was above those showy types of affection, but for Steve, he’d let the man indulge. That is, if there was anything left of their non-existent relationship after their ruined ‘date’.
“I was yelling,” Tony said with a weak shrug. “Dad yelled a lot when I was young. Kid probably thinks I look like him too. Don’t ask me how. I don’t remember what Howard looked like when I was that age, but kid can generalize stuff. Wouldn’t be surprised if he saw the family resemblance.”
Natasha, not bothering to hide her disinterest, was examining her nails. “What?”
Thanks go to kuailong for the beta.
“Oh. Okay. Thank for telling me,” he said, looking relieved. “But I’m not really interested in spending time with girls.”
“This is important,” said Rhodey. His eyes and voice said this discussion wasn’t over yet.
Tony’s pulse quickened. He tried to stay calm, but the tension in his voice betrayed his outer cool. “I don’t think you understand, so let me say it clearly: that the plans I gave you are nowhere close to being ready yet. I don’t care what adjustments R&D made, to core mechanics aren’t stable and that means nothing else added on could be usable.”
Ms. Potts rubbed her forehead with a free hand. “I can’t believe he didn’t tell you,” she said in a tired tone. “No, scratch that. I actually can.”
"And we will Steve," reassured Sam. "But we gotta do it quite like. Hands like those don't hesitate for little guys like us."
“What are you doing? Help me get ‘em in,” he snapped at Steve’s crew. They were just standing around watching as he and Happy did all the hard work. Wasn’t this their friend that was injured? Did
Warm. That feeling slowly sunk down into the darkness of his psyche. The person touching his was warm. They weren’t AIM’s cold, rubber fingers brandishing their claim across his skin. It wasn’t the dry, rough hands of a working man caked in desert sand. This person was warm, and familiar, and...
“Where are my manners,” Steve said, breaking the silence and offering a hand. “I’m Steve. Steve Rogers.”
“And I’m trying very hard not to be one anymore,” Steve said with a smile. He pressed a quick kiss to Tony’s lips and wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist. “Of course, that doesn’t mean I won’t bring this up once every once in a while.”
“Fuck, Steve,” he begged, each breath he took felt heavy in his chest as he tried not to come.
Iron Man scanned the new associates as they began to gather in the front around them. Many of them were worse for wear, but the majority looked like that would live with few or no scars. Their bandages were bloody and messy, but they were up and moving about. Rhodey and Clint had done a good enough patch job. Must have been a bad firefight if associates, not cold bodies, were first on the list. “Any clue who might have done this?”
“Tony.” The name came out as barely a whisper between Steve’s lips. “What in the hell is that?”
“I know,” Steve said with an embarrassed flush. “But I’d really like to hear a ‘yes’ from her too. You’re not the only one that gets a new addition to the family when I finally ask the question.”
“But Steve, I promise you this,” Tony said, taking Steve’s hands in his. “No matter what happens I will do everything in my power to make things right.”
Steve ran his fingers down past Tony’s lips and across his skin. He traced an invisible line down Tony’s body, through the sparse chest hair, down past his soft stomach, stopping only when Steve’s hand grazed Tony’s flaccid cock. Well-groomed pubic hair brushed against his fingers as Steve blindly made his way down to the root.
Tony just stared wide-eyed at Steve. “They’re not going to report me?” he said, feeling like someone had just knocked the air out of his doughy heart.
“Nothing,” said Tony as he hastily tried to push himself up a little higher. “I just need to find Steve.”
Steve looked like he didn’t believe him.
“No, I won’t,” said Steve. “I knew what I was getting into when I asked you out on our first date. It was after that battle with the Wrecking Crew, remember? You had your helmet on when I asked you out. When you said yes and flew off, I was sure you didn’t hear me correctly because you barely reacted.”
Out here in the dry west where the snow don’t fall and folks don’t gather round the fire to warm their cockles, Tony dragged himself out across the dusty desert dirt to the graveyard. A lone tree as thin as a rake stood tall amid wooden crosses.
Didn’t take much imagination to see it. Iron Man, holding a beaten and battered Tony over hot liquid iron. Lip bleeding and one eye blackened from interrogation, Steve could almost hear Tony begging for the pain to stop.
“And shooting at Steve would make this situation better?”
“Hey Tony!” yelled the boy. “He already drew a picture of you. You wanna see?”
With an angry cocky air, Tony turned to face Stane and looked him straight in the eyes. “Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to make weapons like dear old dad?” asked Tony, his voice dripping with contempt.
“I know this isn’t what you want to hear right now,” said Pepper, continuing to brush Tony’s hair. “But we found the leak.” Tony looked up at her. “Well, not who the leak is. But the paperwork I’ve been examining points to Dock 6, Warehouse 16. That seems to be where the missing arms go, well, missing.”
“Didn’t look like that to me,” smirked Clint.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You give yourself too much credit.”
When Steve opened his eyes, everything looked normal. No broken glass. No cracked ceiling. No damage. Just the Avengers hanging out in the living room and Tony sprawled out on the floor like a dead body.
Steve smiled. He wrapped his arms around Tony’s small body and picked him up. “Okay.”
But, for some reason, a small part of him wanted to share it. A small part of him wanted to hear what Tony thought. A small part of him wanted this more than anything in the world. With a sigh, Steve gave in. “Fine,” he conceded, pulling back to his section of the bench. “Just don’t make fun of me when you see it.”
“Yes sir!” The three voices agreed in unison.
“How are you doing Tony?” Steve’s face was covered with blood, grime, and worry. The puffs of air from Steve’s don’t seem as sexy as they were a few minutes ago.
Up on the catwalk, Clint laughed in disbelief. “Fuck you, it is.”
He was a sham. A complete and utter shame of a CEO. He should have stood firm in moving forward with his original plan, but now there was no way this would ever get done.
“Everyone, start looking!” barked Steve. “He’s got to be around here somewhere.”
Tony needed this. It didn’t matter how cold the water was. He needed to stretch. He needed to change. After all, this might be the last time he would be able to do it in open waters.
She looked up into his eyes, her piercing gaze dissecting his soul. They had moved so close during his rant. He could feel her shallow, even breath on his face. He could see the light peppering of freckles on her face. The flecks of color in her eyes. He wanted to reach out and touch. He wanted to tell her how beautiful she was. “You’re an idiot and this is a terrible idea,” she said.
Tony knew what would happen before he felt the shockwaves under his fingers. Iron Man went down like a tower of bricks. Tony and the suit clattered to the floor with enough noise that it would rouse all of Midtown. Tony desperately tried to get the suit back up and running, but the force of the impact was wreaking havoc on his controls.
A black pen popped into his right hand. “Already got a pen uncapped for you.”
Tony nodded. “It did,” he assured her, squeezing her hand. “For a little bit it did help.”
“Spoiler alert, Natasha. He’s not supposed to know that yet,” said Clint.
The implication slowly sunk into his bones like the cold of winter. Starvation, human trafficking, suicide brought on by hopelessness. The possibilities of what could happen hit a little too close to home.
“No. Why would you take offense to that?”
As he waited precious seconds for the elevator to open, Stane tried desperately with honey coated lines to make Tony reconsider. “Tony, let’s talk it out. You don’t want to make any rash decisions.”
Tony’s face scrunched up in scrutiny. Steve didn’t need to look to see theories and possibilities whizzing through Tony’s mind like ricocheting bullets. “I can ask the Iron Family to protect you-”
That’s when it hit him. ‘T. Stark’. Tony Stark. Good God, Mary, Joseph, and all the holy saints! Tony wasn’t just some run of the mill engineer. Tony was Tony ‘freakin’ Stark: son of the great Howard Stark and new head of Stark Industries, inventor extraordinaire, and one of the few companies trying to do some good in the wake of the crash.
“Yeah,” said Steve, his voice thick with emotions too complex to be limited to a single word. “A little bit.”
Sam placed both hands on Steve’s shoulders. He pushed Steve up and started ushering him away from the chairs. As Steve made his way toward the washroom, he heard Thor and Sam whisper amongst themselves.
Steve chuckled and it made Tony’s heart melt into a pile of goo. “You say that to all the pretty dolls?” he asks in an equally deep, quiet voice. He moved closer, eyes downcast, but not looking down at Tony.
Steve pressed the dome down with three fingers, but only left a light indent in the surface.
Go after him? Stay? Steve should be given his space. They both need a little bit of space after what happened. But at what cost? Losing Steve? Tony was already at his wit’s end not seeing that beautiful smile for the past two weeks. If he was going to lose Steve, he might as well go down kicking and screaming.
And now that he was sure that he was safe, he could take his time. Stretch his fins for however long he liked. Swim for however long he pleased. No more making do with tiny bathtubs or chlorinated pools. Tonight, Tony could enjoy the ocean like the merman he was.
“Better be,” Tony said with a coy wink. “Or else I’ve been committing identity fraud for the past thirty years or so. I could go to jail for that.”
“Hey,” Tony whispered as he tiptoed into the room. “Mini me finally go to sleep?”
Bucky whined and they must be having some sort of conversation because Steve decided to loaf on Tony’s back like a cat, his soft underbelly pressing into Tony’s vulnerable side. Steve’s face was one of deep satisfaction, but Tony could see the worry in Bucky’s eyes.
Tony offered a small smile. “It ain’t much,” admitted Tony, pushing his shoulders back. Steve felt a glow begin in his stomach as Tony slowly regained his confidence. “Working in the dirt, you can only do so much.” He pointed to a section near the center of the image.
Tony tried again, charging the right gauntlet so it glowed white. If the personal approach wasn’t working, he would have to try the professional approach. “If you know what’s good for you Captain, you will stand down right now,” declared Iron Man. “You and your people are clearly out gunned and outmatched. Give up now, and I will personally make sure the Iron Family treats this offense fairly.”
“Yes please!” Tony’s face lit up as he pulled up a seat. “Talk deli to me Pep. What local New York specials are we getting today?”
“You should have told me,” Steve said softly.
Tony’s mouth curved up into a cheeky smile. “Depends, what did you have in mind?” he asked, voice dry as sand.
Steve looked up from his drawing. “Did you say something Tony?”
Quickly betaed by kuailong, but any errors are mine. Let me know if you find any that bother you.
It took a moment for everything to sink in, but when it did, Steve was mortified. What in the world had he agreed to? There was no way in hell Tony would ever agree to do something this crazy and illegal in the stupid wee hours of the night. His eyes darted to Tony for some sort of repelled reaction, but Tony was strangely calm. He didn’t look the least bit bothered that he was asked to go on a rum run (maybe he didn’t realize what a rum run was) and he looked almost pleased at the prospect that Steve was taking him.
"You sure we can trust him Steve?" asked a voice from the catwalk that ran the length of the warehouse. Knowing Bucky, he was already laying down like a cat with the crosshairs of their only rifle focused in on Tony’s head.
“Yes boss,” chorused the fresh meat.
A bloodcurdling scream ripped through the air.
Steve chuckled. “Is that your way of asking if I’m gay or if I’m seeing anyone?”
“Me?” Tony asked meekly.
“Why did Uncle Obie mean when he said if Jarvis was a woman, he’d make a good wife?”
“Well, I’m alive and talking to you,” replied Steve in playful annoyance.
“I don’t care,” Tony said. He knocked Natasha’s hand away and stood up on his seat so he could look Steve straight in the eyes.  “I know I’m not a woman, but I’d take good care of you. Dad says the company will be mine someday and when it does, I can marry you. I’d be rich and you wouldn’t have to do anything except be my husband.”
She had that look on her face again. The one that looked like all the energy had been drained from her body, and not in the post sex type of way. “Tony-”
“You’re seeing things again, Jan,” said Tony because someone had to stay grounded in reality. “There’s no way he’d be looking for me.”
Tony squinted his eyes. The seven men were huddled together in a tight circle discussing something amongst themselves. They reminded Tony of the women at his uncle Howard’s extravagant parties. Ladies dressed to the nines who would religiously gather around the fireplace to discuss the latest gossip about who was having sex with who. Minus the expensive wine of course.
Turning on his side, Tony looked at the place where Steve had stood awestruck minutes, maybe hours before. “Shoulda seen his face, Pep,” he gushed quietly. “When he saw what I did, looked at me like I was the best damn thing in the world. And then when he figured it all out, god Pep. It crushed him, and it crushed me too.”
Well, Steve could figure out what to do from there.
“How does this guy not run out of oxygen?” Steve asked, nudging Bucky between the ribs.
Natasha and Bucky looked at each other in silent conversation. “I think,” Natasha said, taking her husband’s hand in quiet support, “we’ll manage. No matter what version of Steve’s there, we’ll manage.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Pep, thinking of quitting, doll face?”
Tony cocked his head to the side. He knelt down and placed two fingers along the man’s still wrist. “Surprisingly, still alive,” he said. Tony looked almost impressed.
“Sounds boring.”
He closed his eyes, ready to welcome death with open arms when he heard it.
Ms. Potts sighed as the girl rushed down the elevator. “She’s getting married in a month. Tony told me to fire her, but she needs to money to help pay for the wedding. She’s an idiot, but mostly harmless in the big picture,” she explained as if she was trying to convince herself that it was the right thing to do.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat. Something must be wrong with his ears, right? Tony looked over at Steve, expecting a ‘gotcha’ look on his face. Instead, clear blue eyes stared up back at him. There was a small smile on Steve’s face. Soft creases lined the area around Steve’s eyes in a pattern that someday might be crow’s feet. If this were a movie, there would be hearts in his eyes and the ocean life would be singing, “Kiss the Girl.” So no, definitely not a prank. God, how did Steve manage to make cheesy lines like that sound good?
They being Rhodey and Clint. After the successful raid with War Machine the week prior, he had sent the pair to prepare a storefront together. The same storefront that Iron Man was standing in front of.
“Tony,” Steve growled. “Don’t make me order you to stay in bed.”
Thor’s brow furrowed in concern. The grip on his hammer tightened. “I thought you were trying to stay out of trouble,” concern clear in his deep voice.
Steve shook his head. “Nope. But… un… I was thinking of getting Morgan a necklace. Something kid friendly, but valuable. Don’t want her to feel left out when I finally propose to her dad.”
“I take offense to that.”
“About what?” asked Tony.
“Let me do it,” he said, dabbing a spot right below Steve’s cheek bone “Don’t you guys have mirrors here?”
“How’s the wife?” asked Sam as Steve closed the door to the grocery store behind him.
Steve looked at the kid and smiled. “I don’t know. I think that’s adorable.”
Rhodey groaned. “I did
Bruce gave an assuring nod. “Then I guessing better get him prepped. It's going to be a long day."
“Rumlow, we’re leaving!”
Steve gets back to work.
“Just put it on my desk,” he said, trying his best to ignore her as he glared at the damn needle moving closer to his floor. “I don’t like being handed things.”
Angry surged into Steve’s blood. His vision zoomed in on the figure as he pulled back the safety on the gun. He lifted the pistol with both hands and began firing at the figure. It didn’t matter that each bullet pinged off the metal casing. Steve wanted him dead. He wanted to pierce the heart of the man who used Tony before beating his body into a bloody pulp.
As expected, Bucky insisted on having a rifle at his side, at the ready. Maybe it would turn heads if they walked down the wrong streets, but Bucky was stubborn like that and Steve was smart enough to know how to keep them out of the eye of scrutiny.
The window rolled down. "Pepper asked me to keep an eye on you."
“I love you,” said the man. “I will always love you.”
But not Tony Stark. Never Tony Stark.
It took a second for Steve to blink through the blood. When he did, a cold wave of anger ran down Steve’s spine. His cheeks ran hot, but his face remained cold as stone. Steve’s lips flattened into a straight line. He release the man and let the laughing maniac writhe across the floor like the worm he was. Steve wiped the blood off his face with the back of his hand. He looked back at Tony one last time.
Tony looked down at his dick and a wave of embarrassment washed over him. The white sheet was soaked with his precome. From the tip of his dick down past his crotch, white fabric clung to his cock, accentuating every single vein. Tony could see his dark red head twitching with anticipation, fighting the restraining hold of the sheet. Tony had been holding back for the past week, and now look at him. How could he have allowed things to get this bad?
“See? Easy.”
Clint snorted in amusement. “No. I’m here to submit a complaint that you get your ass kicked way too much. I don’t get paid enough to deal with this kind of shit.”
Finally, a light at the end of the ever darkening tunnel. “And you have no idea how grateful I am for that.”
Captain America was alive and he was freezing to death.
“It is a sound course of action,” agreed Thor. “It would be unwise to waste it.”
Everyone else was smiling in celebration. Bucky was busy admiring the scope of a beautiful rifle, testing out the balance and recoil with empty rounds. Meanwhile, Thor and Sam worked at popping open the lids like they were boxes of cracker jacks. Natasha, as was par for the course in her line of work, was nowhere to be seen.
Tony chuckled. He pulled Steve closer, burying his nose into the sweaty nook of Steve’s neck. “What were you thinking you idiot?” he asked, inhaling Steve’s scent. And dear god, he never thought the day would come where he could find such relief in just smelling a man’s musk.
“You sure this is the right place?” asked Bucky, skeptically eying the structure.
“Pep, I’m not going up to a civilian and saying ‘Nice to meet you. I’m Iron Man. Thanks for inspiring me to decimate my enemies. Wanna be friends?’ It just wouldn’t fly.”
They sat for what felt like hours, both in deep consideration about what should or could happen next. Neither of them noticed a slim shadow a slim shadow creep over them.
When Steve finally stepped back for some air, the man collapsed onto the floor like a rag doll. His body didn’t even twitch. But Steve wasn’t done yet. “Get up, scum,” Steve barked. He dug his foot into the bleeding man’s stomach. “Where’s the mouth you had earlier? Where’s that confidence? Where is your pride? Where is that sonofabitch that killed Bucky!?”
Steve looked up from his sketch book and smiled. He tried to say something, but his words were also a jumbled mess. “I…um… What I mean to say is… um….”
“You’re beautiful.”
“But right now we’re surrounded by ears eager for gossip. A lot of bad things could happen if the wrong person finds out that I like men. So, can we please not talk about this until after we’re on the road?”
“It’s complicated stuff, Tony. Steve Hawking wrote a whole thesis paper about how time travel is impossible.”
“Still not seeing what they big deal is, Jan,” said Tony, finding it hard to tear his eyes away from the group. “We’ve met before. So, what? Doesn’t make them a regular customer. They probably don’t even remember us. Don’t see why you’re making a big fuss about it.”
Steve smirked. “Pretty sure that belongs to the other guy.”
Steve poked his head out from behind their wall of wooden crates, looking for anyone making nightly rounds. “No,” he whispered. “But of all the places you could have picked, you pick the one that looks like it get the most foot traffic and the most likely place for people to notice stuff going missing.”
He needed to get out of the lab, and he needed to get out now. If what Pepper said was true, Tony didn’t even want to think about it. He could pratically hear the gunfire and pings of empty shells falling to the ground.
“Then take ‘em out,” ordered Steve. He was beginning to feel more like himself and less like a frantic, emotional civilian. “I want to know what the hell is going on and how many more of those things we’ll have to deal with to get out.”
Tony shrugged. “Well, you’re me, so how’s this, you’ll figure it out when you get older.”
Spider Baby
Steve hung up with a sigh. He hadn’t even brought up the kiss this time. What was going on? Was he not reading the signs right? Any time Steve tried to bring it up or took a step further than causal flirting, Tony abruptly ended the conversation. Those first days apart were especially fun.
Tony leaned forward with a playful smile. “I’ll hang you for mutiny too.”
“Don’t worry Ms. Potts I’m calling security right now.” The girl grabbed a nearby phone and began cycling the numbers.
to help with the grieving process.
“I told you, you can’t have it. Now, hand it over,” said Tony, holding back on the building frustration.
“Miss, is everything okay?”
“Please, Jan,” Tony begged. “I don’t want to get kicked out of the Red Cross for being gay. I can’t go back to making weapons with my uncle. I just can’t.”
It was a day like any other. Steve caught Tony rummaging around in the team’s coffee cupboard looking for his three o’clock pick me up. Steve didn’t think much of it at first, this stuff just kinda happened, but when Tony turned around and asked Steve, “What’s the one that tastes like blueberries?” Steve’s blood froze.
Natasha blinked a few times and then looked to the sky. See? Pointless.
Stane urged him into the elevator. “Sleep on it, for me?”
“What?” The rush of hot blood to his face was immediate.
“Yeah, I’ll say no to that surgery.”
“Meeting someone?” asked Tony.
“How would you go about fixing it?”
“I want an update. Something I can present to the board.”
“Nothing about you is mild-mannered.” Steve rolled his eyes, but his voice was light in a way that Tony could only assume-
The escort back was slow and quiet. Steve probably didn’t even know where they’re going. He certainly didn’t ask for an address. Not that Tony would give him one. He wanted to keep Steve as far away from the truth as possible. Both Stark Industries and the Iron Family. The named had slipped out one too many times, and he liked that Steve was clueless about who he was spending time with. It made their time together all the more special for Tony knowing that Steve was content spending time with him as a person and not wooing him for his money.
“A friend?” Rhodey sat back in his chair.
“Steve, don’t you-” Tony’s warning was immediately cut off as Steve’s lips stole the words from Tony’s mouth with a kiss. It started off gentle – a soft press on his lips. Then, it turned dirty. Steve’s teeth bit down on Tony’s bottom lip, sucking any words of discouragement into Steve’s needy mouth. Then came the tongue, hungry for Tony’s attention. Tony tried to pull away but no matter which way he went, Steve was there, ready to drown Tony with his talented lips. Not that Tony could say
Captain America let out another breath and his eyes fluttered closed.
Tony snapped out of his trance. Oh right. They had left the shop and had pulled into a back ally to change personas again. He’s breath, free of the helmet, was heavy and haggard against the roof of the limo. Most of his clothes had been discarded haphazardly through the open car door, leaving him with a dark set of dress pants and a red dress shirt with the top buttons open to the spring breeze. He tried to shake the cold panic from his system.
Tony tried to push himself up, but his arms flailed about like overcooked noodles. “Shit. What’s wrong with me? I should be able to do this.”
Tony’s mouth dropped in faked shock. “How did you…? When did you…? That’s super-secret information, young lady. You can’t go around telling people that Steve still goes on missions despite claiming retirement benefits.”
“Make sure Freak brings some rope or those handcuffs with him too,” he absentmindedly said into the radio. “It looks like we’ll be having some unexpected company over for dinner.”
“Yeah. Line starts behind me," he said.
Around the corner from where Tony and Steve separated, sat a fancy black limousine for two. A stout man with a black cap sat up front and barely moved as Tony approached the car.
“Iron Man,” a voice called to him over the radio. “What are your orders?”
Tony shrugged, a coy smile playing on his lips. “Absence makes the heart grow fonder.”
“First of all,” Tony said, because he had to set the record straight, “they’re not weights. They’re just empty boxes of oatmeal. Second, Steve stop smiling.”
The trio sat in silence, both Sam and Steve savouring the suddenly tasteless dog. Natasha rapped her well-kept nails on the cobblestone road. She made some faces at the sky before pushing herself up off the ground. Her posture was confident and her head nodded up and down with reassurance. “Okay,” she said.
“He’s still Steve, right? Maybe, maybe it’s just the wolf that doesn’t recognize you,” Tony said, trying to salvage the situation.
He’d seen it a dozen times before, but it didn’t make the emptiness in his chest hurt any less. Tony dragged himself over to the headstone and pressed his fingers to the beautifully carved name embedded in the rock. He traced his fingers along the swoop of the “S”, letting the edges press into the sensitive flesh.
Iron Family stunt aside, Hydra was to blame for all the recent fuss. Kept doing stupid things like makin hits on big name families, little name gangs, even went as low as to attack civilian spots. Steve figured something big must be going down in the ranks, seeing as some of their agents were attacking their own hideouts, but for the love of all that was good and holy, he couldn’t be bothered to figure out why.
“I’m not really dressed for it,” Tony said, looking down at his red Hawaiian shirt and baggy cargo shorts.
“Duly noted Mr. Stark. But it might take time to find housing that fits your requirements.”
“You fools!” screamed Schmidt over the deadly din. “It’s a diversion.”
“Could be worse,” said Tony, leaning back into Steve’s space. “Could be tax evasion.”
“Why can’t you listen to white jazz like other people your age? Like Jack Tegarden, Bix Biederbecke, or even the Original Dixieland Jazz Band?”
“Steve?” Rhodey raised a questioning eyebrow.
After what felt like ages, the dust began to settle. At the distant edge of the cloud, a shadowy figure rose up from the wreckage. It held its head in pain. “Ugh,” a voice crackled over the radio. “Buck?”
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve detected movement from behind a dark mahogany bar. A man in an intimidating dark gray suit stood up from the bar stool, his movements toward the group were slow but deliberate. Why hadn’t Steve noticed him before? The darkness of the room shouldn’t have prevented him from seeing such a large figure nursing a drink at a bar. He needed to get better at spotting people in the shadows. With quick breaths and sharp eyes, Steve tried to evaluate the strange form.
Tony had heard enough. “Obie, stop harassing my PA,” Tony warned through a bite of tomato and meat.
“Did my eyes deceive me, or is that the same wonder bread you were eying a few weeks ago?” asked Clint, making conversation.
“Mister Stark,” Bucky said, offering an equally firm handshake, “Thank you for looking after our pack leader. Hope he hasn’t been causing you too much trouble.”
Tony rolled his eyes and let out an exasperated huff. “You’re horrible, Steve Rogers. I can’t believe media still pegs you for a boy scout.”
Tony tapped his shoulder. “Hey, Steve?”
“Damnit." Bucky ran a frustrated hand through his hair. His eyes looked upward as he considered their opinions. "Well, I got a couple of contacts that I haven’t tried to sell our stuff to. I’ll shake ‘em down and let you know.”
“Oh.”
Steve sniffed, wiping invisible snot away from his nose. “They’re gonna come after us,” said Steve. “Once Tony tells Iron Man, they’ll come after us and kill us.” It wasn’t a guess. It was a statement. That’s how things worked with the mafia. Once a family secret leaked out, it didn’t stay leaked for long.  Those with unwanted information either ended up with an obituary in the morning paper, or on a list of people gone missing under strange and mysterious circumstances.
“I can see the charges now,” said Tony with a smile. “Stark and Rogers, fugitives of the law for using the wrong type of drinking glass.”
… Tony did say he was always up for a morning blowjob.
“But Steve,” he whispered, trying to appeal to Steve’s logic. “This is why I’m here. This is why I’m dressed up as Iron Man and not Tony Stark mild- mannered inventor.”
“Please don’t murder anyone,” Tony interrupted. “We have enough to deal with as is.”
Steve hummed, but he didn’t seem content with such a simple touch. He wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and pulled them close so their lips were only a hair’s breadth apart. Tony gasped as Steve’s ‘interest’ made itself known from down below. “If I’m so sweet, you better be prepared to pay for decent dental, Tony. Because once we’re married, things are only going to get sweeter.”
He’d heard enough. One hand reached under his jacket to the holster wrapped around his chest. Feeling the cold familiar metal in his hand, Iron Man pulled out the weapon and pointed the barrel at Barton. His heart and head were steady in the tense air. His body was apprehensive, but controlled. Unlike the nerves of the new associates. Their eyes were the size of saucers as they looked on. Each one clung to the others like helpless rats. Apparently, they were not used to seeing disciplinary action.
"What is the point then?” Sam asked with a taunting shrug. “Going in pairs so we don't get surprise mauled?"
“I’m… actually interested in something else,” he said, the nervous energy around him suddenly coming off in waves.
“Nothing,” she said, dismissing the topic as quickly as it had come up. They stood in amicable silence as they passed a few more floors before she asked, “So what business do you have with Mister Stark?”
War Machine gave them a quick murderous glare before retorting, “Tell your Captain to keep his mitts off our Engineer and there won’t be anything to discuss.”
"Black and white and read all over?” Tony joked, not bothering to look up from the magnifying glass.  “I don't know Pep, but I'll get back to you after I finish the wiring here."
Was Steve okay? Did Hydra gang up and beat the living crap out of him? Did they break any bones? How many times would Iron Man have to kill them before Steve’s broken pride was avenged?
“What about the guns?”
But as Steve slowly looked up to face his attackers, a determined glint in his eyes, Tony realized that Steve could hold his own against the random thugs. With a free leg, Steve kneaded the oncoming attacker in the groin. The guy crumpled to the ground with an earsplitting scream. Steve pulled his right arm hard, and forced the two guys on his arms to collide. The guy on the ground slowly got up, but Steve was more than ready. With solid, strong strikes he decked the guy in the face and lands another in his gut.
Morgan turned around and squealed. “Daddy!” She climbed over the couch and ran toward Tony with all the speed and grace of a baby antelope.
“What? I can’t take the initiative once in a while?” Honestly, Tony would rather have calm Bruce dealing with it (make a good impression) than strict Pepper. He didn’t want Steve at the wrong end of a barrel if things went belly side up for some reason.
It was a damn miracle that nobody got hurt bad in the scuffles. Couple of them still carried cuts, gun grazes, and bruises, but that was nothing compared to the througheral throttling Steve had given to a group of four that decided (on a whim funny enough) to come at him that morning. Steve’s crowd looked good all things considering, but if fingers were a bit more twitchy and eyes a bit more shifty than normal, Steve tried to pay it no mind. They had a job to do and he couldn’t allow personal feelings to get in the way.
“Get down idiot!”
The press of Bruce’s fingers felt good on Tony’s skin. He’d rather have Steve take his pulse, but Bruce was good too. Anything was good if it gave him a clean bill of health.
Tony lifted his head out of his arms just enough so their eyes could meet. “Promise?”
“Bathroom?” offered Tony from the other side of the room, suddenly very interested in the woodgrain walls.
Tony winced as the volley of bullets resumed. “And he brought company no less.”
A sly grin stretched across Tony’s face. He put a reassuring hand on Steve’s shoulder and whispered once more into his ear, “I won’t tell if you won’t.”
It was a nice day at the park. Birds chirped in the fresh spring air of the Lower Eastside. Children amused themselves with a game of kick the can. Schmidt screamed at people in a heavy German accent to join the FONG (Friends of New Germany) and preached about the God-like savior of Germany, known as Hitler. Well, aside from the verbal assault on American values, nice day in the park.
“Rescue, call in the Hulk. We got injured.” He stalked forward to the impact site, releasing unnecessary bits of the Iron Man armor and letting it fall where it may.
Steve didn’t answer his question. Instead, he stood up from the beach chair. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small blue box no bigger than a half dollar coin. Blue package clutched firmly in his hand, Steve knelt down on one knee.
And goddamn Tony’s heart melted like a pad of butter on a hot skillet.
“You were gone all afternoon yesterday!  I was about to send out a search party.”
"If our guys pay us our due, yeah, we got enough," reported Sam as he walked into the back room. "Double checked the number this morning and each bottle has a name on it. Don't worry Steve, none of the work will be going to waste."
Tony could not move fast enough. He sprinted over to the padlocked door, trying key after key until one finally fit. He threw open the gate and raced in. Damn the consequences.
There was no sign of any emotion on War Machine’s mask, at least none that Steve could see after a quick sweep of his posture. But there must have been something there because the suit leaned over and whispered in a disgruntled voice, “He’s not here.”
"Guess we're assuming someone's crouching in on turf," muttered Bucky as he worked through the words on the page. "Don't say nothin about no Nazi symbol."
“You little-” Tony growled as the kid ran behind Steve’s seat.
“He is?”
Quick thanks to my beta kuailong. They're in the process of moving, so we may or may not have a betaed chapter 8.  Chapter 9 is still in the works and Chapter 10 does't even exist yet. So if I have to miss a deadline or two, you kinda know why.
Steve winced. “I just don’t want to break it.”
I’ve had my fair share of bad dates, but this one is something else.
“What are we talking about?” asked Bruce as he walked into the lab.
Tony groaned. He flopped, back first, onto the bed. Tony covered his face with both hands as Steve’s fingers continued to roam up and down his sides. “Fine. I’m up. I can’t believe I’m putting up with this before my first cup of coffee.”
Rumlow’s face flushed beat red with anger. He raised his gloved hand, charging up the energy for a point blank blast. “Why you little-”
“Can it Banner,” snapped Tony. “Just get him in the van and start working your magic.”
Everyone else close to him, their opinions didn’t matter (Tony would like it if they did approve. He really would. That would be super swell. But, reality was you can’t come out without stepping on a few toes). But Obie...
It took Tony a few moments, but when he figured it out, it was like a series of lightbulbs went off in his brain. “Of course! Of course, it all makes so much sense. The circus fucked with your food. They put drugs in it so of course you wouldn’t trust anything I give you.”
“Consider me a concerned party,” the man replied. If he had a cane, odds are he would twirl it with a relaxed ease. “Who I am and who I’m affiliated with doesn’t matter. However, I will offer this piece of advice, free of charge.” His face darkened and his posture became taught. “Stay away from that man Steve Rogers. Nothing good will come associating with that type of person.”
“Natasha Romanov. We spoke on the phone,” Natasha said, giving Tony such a firm handshake that even a power-hungry stockbroker would fall on their knees for her.
Stane unrolled the paper. His face twisted in confusion. “What’s this?” Ah, he had found the mess of numbers and computations. Not even a fraction of crazy compared to the preliminary diagrams and layouts.
The edges of Tony’s eyes softened. “Here, let me show you where to start.”
“I want the place looking spotless by the end of the week!” he yelled. “I want rum runners ready with the local best before we open at the end of the month. We only got one shot at this, and if we don’t do well, I’ll do more than shoot bullets at your head. Am I clear?”
Words. Steve could remember them; make them into a nice coherent sentence. “Still in shock that this is all you, but it’s nice,” said Steve, trying his hardest not to ogle Tony as his eyes darted around to everything but. He could salvage this conversation if it was the last thing he did. “The workshop, It’s very you. Can’t say I’m a fan of your wallpaper though.”
“I mean, I know I’m not as young as those kids you see dancing at clubs, but I’m still a catch, right? I got a stable job, a roof over my head, friends, hobbies. Sure, I have my vices, but who doesn’t? All those kids swiping left because they have these ridiculous expectations. No bears, no old guys, no fatties, no drama, no queens, no fems, no baggage, no bisexuals or pans because you’re not a real gay unless you only like dick. Must be over six feet tall, must have at least a six-pack to even be in the running, do you see what I mean, Steve? It gets old fast.”
Tony’s hands were the last thing to change. His nails grew until the tips formed gentle points perfect for digging or catching prey. Red webbing, hidden tight in the valley of his fingers, turned soft. Tony ran his fingers through the current a few times allowing the webbing to relax and stretch back out like a fan.
Steve and Tony glared at Rhodey. “What!” they yelled.
Steve pushed back. “I’ll believe it when I see it, but for now all I see is blood.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve spotted Sam squatting on the steps. As soon as Sam noticed Steve storming out the building, he was on his feet. “Everything okay Steve?” he asked, worry etched across his face.
“Nooooooo, you’re lying,” the kid whined. “Jarvis got me stickers of Cap’s shield as a reward and everything.”
Steve gave an affirming nod and both Bucky and Sam, holding a bottle each, moved to the bar to prepare so Thor could pour the drinks. Steve stayed back to keep an eye on the operation. If the Iron Family insisted having extra eyes on the lookout for trouble, woe be it to the Brooklyn Boys if they didn’t follow suit.
Tony shrank back. He couldn’t believe it. Captain America was alive. Captain America was alive!
Grabbing her shoulders, Steve forced some distance between them. At first glance, nothing seemed wrong with her. Her hair was short now though, a call back to the previous decade of flapper fashion. However, Natasha was always good at hiding things. Maybe too much for her own good. “What are you doing up here anyway?” he asked, suspicious at the surprise visit.
“Hey.” The words came out as breathless gasp. Tony took a gulp of air and tried to sound more put together. Like his heart wasn’t keeping dangerous time with the rapid rotation of the arc reactor. “He going to be okay?”
A loud roar shook Tony’s bones. “WHERE IS HE!” bellowed an angry Rumlow.
Sam ducked out to fire off a few rounds. “My guess, Schmidt's got deep pockets now. Heard he got promoted to head of Hydra.”
“How can you say that?” asked Steve.
“Thanks Bucky.” The smile was short lived. In his head, Steve was already running options of where else they could go. If the rumor was something to believed, they might lose more than half their business to changes in the pecking order. He couldn’t afford that. He could barely afford to pay his crew their less than living wage. Something had to be done, but he was stumped on the what.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand. “I’ll be there for you every step of the way,” he said, pushing a stray hair out of Tony’s face. “Would that make you feel better?”
“Don’t know,” Tony murmured, marveling at the talented creator rather than the creation. “What happens if I say no?”
“Aw, don’t be jealous. Love you too babe,” Tony said. He gave Steve’s hand a quick squeeze before planning a kiss on his cheek.
"Trying to give you a present,” Tony said with a smile. “But I guess I'm not welcomed here since..." he gestured to the barrel trained toward his head.
So, Chapter 6 and & 7 will be on schedule. I'm going to try my best to keep my goals since I'm running into some motivation problems writing the story. Hope you're enjoying it so far! I'm working on the climax and it's getting harder to punch it out.
“And why would have you to do that?” asked Steve, goofy smile playing at his lips.
Tony sighed. “Come on, fluffy. First, my blind date goes horrible, then I sleep through my alarm, and then I step in some unicorn shit during my rounds. I’m not asking for much, so please, eat. I’m not sure how much more I can take.”
“Give it here. Let me pour you a drink.”
“Find something you like boss?”
Steve nodded and they parted ways. He sauntered over to a bench overlooking a sandbox and the kid’s playground, and flopped down with a sigh.
Steve nodded his approval. "Sam, with me. Winter Soldier, Thor, you have your assignments. Get to work."
“Wait, so you actually want our shit?” asked Bucky in disbelief.
“Concern yourself no more my friend," said Tony as he got in the car. "I came up with a plan while gallivanting across the rooftops, waiting for my knight in shining armor to save me."
“At this point, there is no other way,” he said, not bothering to hide sound of defeat in his voice.
“Why not?”
“Oh now you don’t,” Tony growled. He pushed himself up, ready for battle, only to feel the tug back down as Steve’s firm grip held onto his arm.
“Uh… because they’re your friends,” Steve offered because only a dead man would not see the obvious connection. But considering the hours that Tony kept during these last two weeks of hell, he might be a lot closer to passing out and sleeping like the dead then Steve would like to admit. What did Tony say he was on? Thirty-two hours and his fifth cup of coffee. Not the best recipe for sanity. “And why didn’t you tell me you were friends with the Iron Family?”
He reached out and took Steve’s hand in his. Tony pulled Steve’s hand down until his large fingers brushed the outside of the silver circle.
Steve laughed. He could get used to this, if given the chance. The gentle banter, the moments of silence where nothing needed to be said, for those few seconds, Steve felt everything could be perfect. With his handkerchief in hand, Tony brushed the soft material over his own darkened cheek. “You... um… you got something on your face Steve.”
“What is this place?” asked Bucky, scanning over the towers and pyramid of mismatched crates and boxes. Various shades of grey dust blanketed the large packages.
Embarrassment seized Steve’s heart. Who was he kidding? Steve didn’t belong here. A runt like Steve didn’t deserve to dance with someone like Tony.
Tony heads back to work.
Sam pressed two fingers to his temple and tried not to swear. “Steve, you can’t just sit here all night waiting for Bucky to recover. It’s not going to make the surgery go any faster. Look, there’s a bathroom and a sink down that way. Go wash up.”
“We all set to go soldier?” Thank god for distractions. Questions about his strategy were really not something he wanted to deal with right at that moment.
Pepper silently rolled her eyes in irritation. “Should be taken to the fifth floor and up the chain of command. I’ll check it before sending it off, but please remember next time. I can’t keep checking your work every time you make a mistake. I already have enough on my plate dealing with Mister Stark.”
The room was phenomenal. Multiple workstation for various types of projects were scattered about the open floor. Red metal chests stood by each station like tin soldiers, most likely filled with odds and ends that would assist in projects related to whatever station they stood guard over. With a quick look, Tony could guess exactly what stations were designated for what part of his work. A station for welding. A station for drafting. A station for wood and metal prototypes. A station for testing said prototypes. A very large station dedicated just to ammunition. (Obie was being in no way subtly about the potential weapons contract.) A station dedicated to automotive parts. And small icebox and kitchen equipped with late night necessities such as a coffee maker and blender. Tony couldn't wait to fuck it all up.
The armor. If only they had the armor. But it wasn’t ready. Heads were safe. But bodies… The idea was tangled up in his head, tangled in wires and logistics. He need more time, more space to work, but that was an impossibility now. The code dictated a return hit, within twenty four hours was more effective. Too soon. His men weren’t ready. The gifts were far from ready. The world was crashing down on his shoulders once again and he wasn’t fucking ready to deal with it yet.
Jan nodded. “Of course. I just got so excited thinking he might ask you out. I didn’t stop to consider what might happen if things went bad. I’m really sorry, Tony.”
“I know that look, Tony.”
Steve nodded. “Promise.”
“Steve?”
Bucky hissed as Natasha dabbed an antibacterial wipe across his shoulder. “Not bad. Couple of bruises, few scratches, nothing my healing factor can’t take care of in a few hours.”
The door to the lab slammed open and a very angry Pepper Pots stormed into the room. She shoved a bolded headline into Tony’s face.
“And yet he can't tell me who's on top giving orders,” retorted Bruce. “Said something about Zola being the messenger, but he’s confused as to who would send the message.”
Pepper wasn't impressed. "Don't be coy with me Tony. This is your work, isn't it?"
Steve let out a tired laugh. “Something like that.”
That made Tony pause. He wasn’t mad at Pepper for implying that Steve was a fool. Tony could be mad, but it made him think. He wanted to say something in response, but he couldn’t. He wanted to say “I hope so too,” but the worlds on the tip of his tongue refused to come out. Was he really that much of a fool? Would Steve be okay with Tony? All of Tony? Millionaire mob boss and all? Could Steve be okay with all that? Could he? Being around Tony, the real Tony all the time? Not to mention Tony was a man. There wasn’t anything remotely feminine about Tony’s physique. Steve wouldn’t be confused about that. Even if Tony shaved his goatee off, which would be akin to death for him, would Steve be willing to look past sex to give Tony the time of day?
Sam cracked open a long crate. Pushing the lid over so it fell to the ground with a clatter, he looked at the examined the contents inside and whistled. “What the hell is this?”
“Stay out here,” said the doctor.
“No! God, no. It’s just- I’m really busy and I don’t want you to feel obligated to stick around after everything that’s happened. You’ve been trapped in the Dollhouse for, what, a year? Go for a walk. Get some fresh air. I’ll be fine.”
Tony let out a long sigh and shoved his hands deep into his pockets. He turned his back to the dead and started the long, quiet trip back to civilization. But just as Tony was about to leave, he noticed a woman with vibrant red hair on the other side of the cemetery gate.
“What makes you think I don’t?” asked Tony. He had gotten used to this song and dance over the past few months. “I designed the stupid thing. Might as well say that everything with my company’s name tagged on the side is my fault.”
Underneath the helmet, Tony raised a questioning eyebrow. “And you are-”
In the distance, Steve heard a scream. He lifted his head out of the sink and looked around for the source of the sound. “What was that?” Steve asked.
Tony blushed. He kissed a tear off Steve’s face. “Universe is going to have to try a lot harder to kill me.”
Happy pulled the van around with Bruce perched in the back. Bruce took one look at Bucky and his eyes grew to the size of saucers. “Tony, I can’t-”
Steve didn’t stop. “Steve! Wait up!” Steve didn’t wait. He forced himself to walk as far away from the building as possible. And when the eyesore of a building was finally out of sight, blocked by other faceless structures, Steve let loose. Damn the consequences! Steve curdled his hand into a solid fist and punched at a nameless brick wall. The resounding crunch felt so satisfying. An army of cracks ran out from the place of impact. With a twist of his fist, red pebbles fell to the ground in a rain of red dust.
Tony rolling his eyes. How he managed to land a possessive and yet adorable fiancé, Tony would never be able to figure out. “Only for you and only because you’re so adorable,” Tony said, turning to catch a quick kiss over his shoulder. “But there’s still a lot of work to be done before we let people outside the Avengers know. Need to talk to Pepper about an official announcement before the media catches on and the stocks rocket. Have to get paperwork looked over by lawyers and approved by the board.”
‘I don’t want to,’ Tony said with a roll of his eyes.
Tony frowned. He didn’t like it. He didn’t like his role as a walking-talking target. He didn’t like how this plan put Steve at risk. And he especially didn’t like how easily Steve had slid into the role of a criminal mastermind. But, as much as it pained him, it was a good strategy and they were running out of time to get shit done.
Steve groaned. Raking his fingers through his dirty hair, he tried to come to terms with the situation. Logically, he could do this. He could take Tony on a rum run and everything would be okay. It was just one run. Steve knew the routes like the back of his hand. There was no way anybody would catch them.
Soon as the weight was off his hips, Tony scampered away from the body. “Jesus Barton,” he gasped, placing a hand proactively in front of the arc reactor. “Cutting it a little close.”
“We have all the newest toys, and some that haven’t reached the market," said Stane, opening a large mahogany door to an even larger room. "If you need anything, just ask.”
Natasha gave him a look. “Yes? Isn’t that what baby werewolves are called?”
Steve followed the trail of blood until he came face to face with a large door. On the wood, someone had posted a flimsy paper sign that read ‘Interrogation in progress.’
“How does a week of actually showing up to work on time sound?” she said with a cocky smile.
As the elevator doors slid shut, ending their conversation, Tony immediately regretted letting Obie talking him into delaying his executive decision. Tony closed his eyes and allowed his legs to give out from underneath him. There was something strangely relieving about sliding down the elevator wall and letting everything he couldn’t say flood out. He hung his head between his legs, breathing to the rhythm of the elevator pings.
“Yeah,” said Steve with an embarrassed laugh. “So… you still up for showing me the ropes? Tasting is fine, but I’d really like to learn the ins and outs of making donuts. They seem… really interesting.”
Tony laughed. “You don’t know bad, Steve. My room was almost a literal temple dedicated to you. The only reason it wasn’t was because there was a corner of my room dedicated to robotics because my dad wouldn’t let me keep all my tools and stuff in his lab. Said it cluttered the place up.
“Well tell your guy to contact me when he gets the chance. This stuff is really good. You know, for locally made.” Tony began wander around the apartment taking in his surroundings. “Now the Italians,” he began to ramble. “They know how to make a good wine, and the Germans have a great rep with beer. You should see my collection sometime. Honestly, I’m more of a scotch person than anything, but this is still pretty good.” Tony took another sip as he looked around the small room. “Something wrong with your heater?”
Bucky chuckled, but it did little to relieve the nervous tension in the air. “Yeah, that’s… That sounds like our Stevie all right.”
Precious seconds ticked by before his limbs began to respond. Steve could tell the singing nerves would slowly come back to life, but for the moment everything felt like a swarm of wasps were going to town on his body. Thank goodness everything was responding and nothing felt broken. Intense stinging on his hands meant a few small splints of wood were embedded into his exposed hands, but he would survive.
“Look at this,” said Iron Man, gesturing at the holes littered across the front entrance and surrounding wall. The grey dust of rock and wood was only just settling on the ground in a fine grain. “I make a name for myself in Boston by squashing the Ten Rings Gang into oblivion, and then I move here and this shit happens. Damn punks. Doesn’t anybody in this town have any respect for another man’s property?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony, who is Steve?” demanded Pepper.
The lookout, Rumlow, gave Schmidt an unimpressed shrugged. “Just got a couple a rats try’n ta sneak away with our dinner. Nothing we can’t handle boss.”
At first, nobody answered. Then, Tony heard the sharp sound of angry whispers. When the voices died down, a familiar blond woman rose up from behind the counter. Carol waved at Tony, and embarrassed smile on her face. Tony, scarlessly believing what he was seeing, waved back.
“Yeah, I see,” Steve casually replied, taking in rumpled sexy spectacle presented to him.
Pushing the door open with an easy flick of her wrist, Steve followed behind like a duck. Loud music from a gramophone burst out into the waiting area like a brick wall of sound. Instincts kicked in, and Steve covered his ears and closed his eyes as if that would make the atrocious din go away faster. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Ms. Potts efficiently rushing over to remove the needle from the record.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck. He had never taught anyone how to make donuts before. Then again, no one had ever asked. “I mean, I guess. I don’t see why not.”
Steve smiled on, unfazed by Rumlow’s toothy grin. Instead of running like a smart person, he fanned the flames by yelling, “Getting outsmarted by a paddy and a spic, Hitler must really be getting desperate.”
Ms. Potts pointed to Steve. Tony turned his attention, and Steve saw the instant Tony finally understood what was happening. He looked like a deer in headlights. Or maybe like a kid that got caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Either way, the jig was up. No more posing as a mild mannered engineer.
Steve tried to stay calm, but his short breaths betrayed his fear. War Machine had found them. He had found out, and now he was going to end them.
“Come on Steve,” Tony said, gently ushering Steve toward the car.
The impact of metal on flesh rattled Steve to the bone. Everything felt off and, for a few seconds, time slowed. A sharp taste of silver metal raced across his tongue as he fell to the ground. The heel of his hand met concrete, sending a debilitating pain up his arms, crippling his elbows.
“But what if he comes out while I’m away?”
Rumlow’s hand jerked back from the arc reactor as if it had been bitten by a snake. His body tensed up. His hand remained hovering in midair. Tony watched in stunned shock as the life drained from Runlow’s eyes. Slowly, he tipped over to the side and fell off Tony in a cloud of dust. The flesh around a black hole in Rumlow’s temple pulsed red with what little was left of Rumlow’s life force.
Stane chuckled at the idea. “If I remember what you were like as a little brat, I think my office might be too small for you. But don’t worry. It’s all taken care of.”
Wait, what?
Bruce forced out a frustrated breath, rubbing the skin under the pads of his glasses. “Tony, it would really help if I could see the guy.”
“Of the people?”
Tony’s mind immediately shifted to thoughts about what to do next. He needed to tell someone about this. Port authorities legally needed to know about the wreck, but they’d ask too many questions. He could tell the Avengers or SHIELD if he was desperate. Didn’t matter who found him. Just so long as someone other than Tony knew that Captain America’s remains had been found. His family and friends had a right to know what had happened. More importantly, Tony needed someone else to know for his own state of mind. Yes, he had to protect his secrets, but he couldn’t stand the thought of leaving an American hero like Captain America trapped in the ice. It just wasn’t right.
With heavy steps, Steve force his way past. Tony didn’t try to hold him back again, but he did beg. “Come on Steve. Let me in. I really need to know what we’re dealing with here.”
“Understood,” Stane said curtly. “I’ll see you when I get back.”
“It’s really not,” said Steve suddenly very conscious of how close together they were.
This man was Iron Man.
Like clockwork, the light above the warehouse entrance went out without a sound. No shattering of glass, meaning the lightbulb would be returned to its spot at the end of the heist. Couldn’t be doing stupid things to arouse suspicion this late in the game. In the emptiness, they heard the familiar metallic clicks of a lock pick as it worked the tumblers. It felt like the process took hours, but they were more than willing to move when the familiar opening click and squeak of the door gave them notice.  Natasha gave the signal, a normally ignorable pattern of rocks falling to the ground, signaling them to proceeded as planned. With no time to waste, the Brooklyn Boys moved fast out of the shadows and up against the cold brick side of Warehouse Sixteen.
“Love you Pep," Tony said, absorbing himself into the nooks and crannies of his new work space.
“Jan.”
“Tony, babe you need to rest. You’ve been through a lot today,” said Steve.
“It’s fine, honeybunch. Just a little bit of a scare,” Tony said. He felt a little breathless, but gave a weak smile and tried to play it off for laughs. From the look on Rhodey’s frown, he clearly wasn’t buying it.
Tony was, to say the least, livid. “And you decide to tell me this now!?”
“So, what do we do now?” asked Natasha, all business and no fuss, unlike her husband.
Looking into Steve’s blue eyes, it dawned on Tony that Steve was more worried about his friends than petty revenge. Schmidt had numbers, Steve’s guys didn’t. No sign of gunfire, but that didn’t mean things would stay that way. And while Tony was also worried about his family, he was confident they could take care of themselves. Besides, he had more pressing concerns.
“Which you always handle so nicely by the way.”
Steve bit down on his tongue and let Tony do his thing. He was happy sitting in silence, but Tony seemed unnerved by it. “If you really need an excuse,” he said as if Steve needed a reason to let another man tend to his wounds. “Just think of this as payment for the favor.”
He looked up at Pepper, eyes serious. “Did you know he’s an artist? He drew me a couple of times. It was really good. Shoulda’ seen him Pep. Looked at me like I was the moon and stars.” His eyes drifted up to the ceiling, lost in thought. “I don’t know much about art, but when I looked at the final product, there was so much warmth in what he made. Made me think that, for a second, he actually cared.”
An opening! Tony rushed the short distance to Rumlow and slammed the broken left gauntlet against the side of Rumlow’s head. The impact made a harsh cracking sound and rattled Tony down to his bones.
Hints of a smile tugged at the edges of his mouth. It didn’t make the doubt go, but it was something to have someone rooting for him. “You have a bet running in this?” he asked, a hint of humor in his voice.
“But I’m irresistible,” he said, gravitating toward her side.
Rhodey raised an eyebrow.
“And they’ll be back another day,” Tony tried to brush it all off. “Who else would they go to? Hammer? His quality is shit and they know it.”
The smile disappeared from Steve’s face. “Oh, sorry. I just thought you’d like some company. I didn’t mean to get in your way.”
Tony went in for another bite and this time, the wolf whined. Fucking whined. Ears down, head down, and the biggest fucking puppy eyes Tony had ever seen.
“I’m a grown ass man, Steve. I can do whatever the hell I want.”
Tony tried to scramble free, but a quick paw pulled him back into the werewolf’s warm embrace.
Tony groaned. “What happened?”
. Tumblr is for reblogs. Still learning how to use twitter, so for now it's random thoughts and hopefully writing updates.
“You really want to help me,” Tony said, losing patience with the entire miscommunication deal. “You get me an opportunity to talk to him, sort all this madness out.”
“So, no telling him too much about the future and touching or else the world implodes. Easy,” said Tony. Even a genius like him could remember something that simple. No touching. No talking about future tech. No filling him on how much their dad was an ass and he shouldn’t listen to a word he says. No words of encouragement. No bragging about his accomplishments and how Tony surpassed their father in every way.
to be a wife.”
Tony shrugged. “Okay. I guess I’ll see you at breakfast. I’ve got a date I need to prepare for. So, you know, if you don’t see me in the morning, assume my blind date got to me first.”
Tony frowned. Where had that come from? Tony had only talked about Steve in passing to Rhodes. Right? “War Machine, do you have something you’d care to share with the class?”
The late winter sun peeked over the horizon and into Steve’s room. It washed over his nose, then his eyes before Steve had enough. He let out a heavy sigh as he stretched out his sex sore muscles. The welcomed ache in his hips and back were much better than they were the night before. Shame he would be back to peak health in a few hours. Steve rolled over to the center of the bed so when he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was Tony. He smiled, drinking in every detail of Tony’s sleeping face as the world welcomed them to a new day.
Steve didn’t answer. He just stood there, bent over and gasping for air.
“Exactly,” replied Steve, holding his ground. He was the leader of the Brooklyn Boys. It would take more than a word or two to make him back down.
“Doesn’t Pepper usually deal with that sort of thing?”
It felt like hours had passed before either one of them broke the silence.
“Code names, cute,” Bruce replied, though his tone held no hint of patronized superiority. “This is War Machine.” He motioned to the unmoving statue of a man. “He’ll be providing support if things go sideways.”
“Go away,” Tony said into his arms. He squeezed his legs closer to his chest, trying to make himself smaller.
Magic did that sometimes. Especially magic that erased memory. But Steve could work through it. The spell only made him forget. Steve could remember. If he could remember things like his name or his friend’s faces, it couldn’t be that hard to remember this man, right?
Captain America didn’t answer. Death by drowning made it hard to respond.
Stane’s eyes stretched wide in shock. He took a few steps back to steady himself before replying in a disbelieving whisper, “What?”
“I should huh?” said Steve, smiling at the younger’s moxie.
Pepper was special. Pepper was a sensitive soul. Pepper shouldn’t have to deal with this kind of stuff. She would probably hold strong until she got home before collapsing on Happy and letting it all out. Tony hated to do that to her. He hated that he couldn’t be the one to help her out with those things. But if their short romantic endeavor proved anything, it’s that he was crap at being the comforting one in the relationship.
Follow me on my tumbler and see all the shit I reblog.
Tony shrugged. “Didn’t have a choice. It was either this, a car battery, or let my heart be shredded from the shrapnel.”
“Scanners are not detecting any extra lifeforms in the building,” said Vision.
“With what?” demanded Dr. Banner. “Can you tell the difference between a brachialis, a biceps brachii, or a brachioradialis? How about knowing which tools to use for foreign objects of various sizes, shapes, or mass? Know anything about that?”
“Tony!” Stane pushed his way through the downward stream of people. “What’s wrong with you, Tony?” Stane’s face was creased with concern. “You’re not acting like yourself.”
“Steve!” Tony screamed into the radio. No response. “You fucking idiot, your com’s not working.” He banged the receiver a few times praying it was just a loose wire in his system, but the prototype refused to connect.
“Look Steve. I don’t care. I really don’t. Maybe I don’t know how you contracted the sickness, and maybe there is no cure. I don’t care. It doesn’t really change who you are or who you have been after all these years. And if I was going to catch it, you or Wilson would have given it to me by now. But Steve, you can’t. You just can't. And not just because he’s a guy, no matter how screwed up I think that is. You gotta’ think about the family Steve. You gotta’ think of them. We’ve got territory to protect, people to feed. Maybe if he lived in the area, but he doesn’t. Besides, he looks like a normal guy. He wouldn’t understand either parts of you.”
Steve nodded, hand over his mouth as he tried to will the beat red flush away. “Yeah. Yeah. Just need a minute to… um…”
Tony chuckled. “I’d call it an obsession more than an ‘interest’ if I’m being perfectly honest.”
But eventually, they conceded. “Fine,” groaned Rhodey. “I’ll do it. But only if you can get Iron Man to agree.”
Eventually, the pain dissipated. He looked up. There, right where the ice was weakest was a large crack.
“Okay,” Tony said, more than a little shaken by how close his fingers had gotten to being someone’s dinner. “So you are hungry.”
Tony chuckled. “Yup, that sounds about right. I remember hating bedtime as a kid. Always tried asking for one more story no matter how much I was yawning. And for the record, I can totally fall asleep on my own at this age.”
“Shut up you two. This is a conversation only for adults,” Tony yelled back.
“Tony, it should be a big deal. Friends shouldn’t be taking advantage of others for their own benefit,” he said, moving over so he was close to Tony’s side.
In a fit of panic, Steve grabbed the gal’s arm. “I need to find Tony. It’s important.”
Shit. He didn’t have time for this. “None of your business, kraut,” Tony growled, wiping the wet spit off his chin.
of an engine shook Tony from his quiet rage.
“In pain? No,” answered Tony with a shy smile. “It’s all numb now. Nerve damage from the bomb and the surgery. Couldn’t be helped.”
“No! Neither. It just is,” Steve sputtered.  Tony obviously care for the place, but for Steve- “I’m guessing it’ll look nicer when it’s all complete, but for now it looks like a confused mess. Like some of that modern art stuff you would find at a rich person’s house.”
“You’ll be gone for all of five seconds. Trust me, whatever happens, Thor will take care of it.”
“No! I’m not. We’re just friends. Good friends. I’m just…,” Steve sputtered. Words, why couldn’t he form them at an important time like this. “It’s just a lot to take in.”
Steve tried to follow the doctor into the dimly lit room, but Dr. Banner raised a hand and pushed him away.
Tony groaned as he plopped down next to a table and buried his head in his arms. That’s it. He was ruined. Leave it to Barton and his big mouth to make a whole lot of nothing out of a little event. Not being het was fine in private (Tony and his lieutenants grew up in the 20s where freedoms of all kinds were welcome. Hell, Tony encouraged any show regardless of type or orientation as long as all parties were of sound age and consent). But in the cutthroat business world, it was hide or die. For the most part, Tony could care less what the media or other people thought of his "unconventional hobbies." But with Obie in the mix, that changed everything.
Steve wanted to ask Tony why he wasn’t scared, but all that came out was, “He dead?”
Bruce shrugged the feedback off like it was nothing. “Think of it as a reminder not to get injured so often. Don’t want the pain, don’t get hurt. Negative reinforcement. With all the time you spend on my examination bed, you’d think you would have learned that lesson by now.”
Steve’s brow furrowed. Who the hell would be out this time of night? With a practiced motion, he cued to his crew for quiet as he reached around to the small of his back. As rehearsed, his crew quietly scattered to their designated defensive positions. Hand settling on the thick metal handle, he crept over to the door. Sam was close behind, both hands clutching a handgun aimed at the floor but ready to shoot. Once his back was fleshed against the brick wall and his breath steady in anticipation, Steve gave his crew the sign and all parts flew into action like the well-oiled machine they were.
"Sometimes I hate being small fry," grumbled Bucky.
“And if I had it my way, that kid would be riding shotgun with me up in the fort.”
He saw a few nods of approval and Steve felt a little more at ease. Even the greatest tacticians needed a little reassurance that their “run and hide” plans were valid options. He felt like a coward setting everyone in pairs when he knew they were more than capable of taking care of themselves. But with valid threats on the cusp of an underground war, Steve wanted to take no chances. Pairing Bucky with Sam and Thor with Jane was the best he could do with their crappy situation. Thor had a bad habit of taking dangerous risks for, as he put it, “The glory of battle!” and Bucky was still recovering from the five-on-two-beating he took two days ago. He needed Sam and Jane paired up to keep tabs on his two loose cannons.
“I know that. Daddy tells me to think critically all the time,” said Tony. He picked up the fork and knife and gently tapped them against each other as if they were dolls. “Hey, Steve?” asked Tony as he waved the fork and knife back and forth in the air.
A sudden jump came from his pants as Tony’s cock eagerly agreed.
Steve’s shoulder slumped over in despair. He held his head in his hand with just enough support to keep his head above water. “I think he’s a part of the inner circle,” he mumbled in confession.
“No, like,” the words caught in his throat again. Steve tried to work around it, beat around the bush if possible. He didn’t want to admit it, didn’t want to say it. If he said it, then it would become true. And if it was true, then… Steve couldn’t stand to imagine what that could mean.
Tony sighed. “You know, under all that fur, I sometimes forget that you guys are just as smart and just as human as the rest of us.”
“Why not Obie?” Tony almost yelled in untampered rage. “Should I wait for more innocent people to die because of me? Or should I just start a gun racketeering business to get the job done faster. Maybe I’ll start an all-out war with the criminal underground just to get my point across.”
“-ony? What’s –ong? –ony? –ony!” Fingers touched the back of his hand. Tony flinched.
“More like he can’t make up his mind.”
“That’s… um… how do I say this? Steve’s a very aggressive werewolf. A very aggressive
Steve let out a frustrated sigh as soon as the others were out of earshot. "Think they'll come this way?" asked Steve. Theories and strategies were already forming in his head. With all the moving parts in his life, new competition was really not something he wanted in his life right now.
“He needs to know,” Sam insisted.  “He needs to know about how you feel about him and about the baggage you come with. Otherwise you two will get hung up over this whole gang business, and then you’ll spend the prime years of your life pining after him like an idiot.”
“That’s not true,” she assured him.
He pushed his way through the crowd of people, past the doors to the street, and just kept walking straight ahead. He didn’t know where he was going and he really didn’t care. Steve’s face was a furnace of emotions. There was a dark urge goading his fist to punch something. Didn’t matter what it was, but he wanted to punch something, and he wanted to punch it hard.
Steve feel his stomach drop down to the floor. "Holy shit," he gasped, staggering back.
“Will have my own, not yet. And it’s nothing, really. I’m just an engineer,” said Tony, looking away from Steve. Wait a minute, was he embarrassed?
Her eyes were on the flashing lights as they moved down toward the basement level. “Your things are already prepared and in the car.”
“I’ll be fine. I’m very mature for my age. Jarvis says so,” Tony said with a confident grin.
rippled out from the impact. The building shook and cloud of dust rained down, covering Tony and Steve in a blanket of brown and grey.
Steve pulled his arm out of Sam’s grasp. “Maybe not,” he muttered, “but I bet it’ll help me feel better.”
Seeing nothing besides a sea of white, brown, and black, Tony’s thoughts drifted to giving up. Maybe it was already too late. Maybe it was his fate to be alone for the rest of his life. To fail every single good person he encountered until there was nothing left of him except that of an old, grumpy, has been. Maybe Steve was meant to be far away from him. Far enough away that a shiny bullet would never find a home between the two hemispheres of Steve’s brain.
“I thought so, but he just looked so sad. I couldn’t just leave him alone,” Steve said, running a hand through the kid’s soft hair.
Two sets of footsteps thundered up behind him, and then skidded to a halt. “Holy shit,” Sam loudly swore in shock. “What happened?”
“Steve, no,” Sam warned. “I know what you’re thinking and the answer is no.”
Steve took another step back. The sound of Steve’s heavy breathing filled the small room. Steve’s ears caught the sharp click of Tony’s shoes as he approached them. He placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You all done?” Tony asked.
Now wasn’t the time to be angry at his short fallings. Now was the time for revenge. He only had a few seconds to act before things were irreversibly damaged, and he planned to make use of every single bloody second of it.
"We have a problem," murmured Thor, adjusting Bucky over his shoulder using his good arm.
“What the hell was that for?” Tony shrieked as the meat bounced harmlessly off the chain-link fence.
Steve let out a weak laugh. Tony seemed so small now. It would take no effort to push Tony out of the way and out of his life forever. With a low voice, he looked down his nose at the poor man. “Tony, if I were you, I would stay the hell out of my way.”
That would keep him down for a bit.
“Thor can keep watch. You need to get cleaned up before something gets infected.”
“Nooooo!”
Spider Baby
“Shut up,” snapped Steve. “We’re bringing down Hydra here and now, captain’s orders. Do you understand?”
“Screw him being my type. That’s not the point, Jan,” Tony hissed.
Tony spun around. He glared at the glacier like it was just another monster of the week Iron Man had to deal with. Then, he charged.
And Clint, well, Clint was drinking his coffee straight from the pot.
“No. Absolutely not,” he said like this was the most certain he had been about anything in his entire life. “This… you… It’s fine.”
Tony sighed and shook his head as he exited the enclosure.
Oh god. “You wouldn’t.”
“Get in, get out, be on alert, and kick some ass if necessary. Got it Cap.”
“Sure,” mumbled Steve, not caring what horrible things she could be plotting. “Take your time.” Natasha would be true to her word, that Steve could be sure of. But now that one problem was taken care of, all that was left was left for him to stew on was the recent turn of events in his private life.
"Don't know," admitted Sam. " But here's what I figure, this isn't some new group trying something big to make their mark. All that damage in one night, someone's gotta be rolling in green for all the manpower and munitions required for the job."
“Everything hurts,” Rhodey moaned with a strained smile. “And I can’t seem to move my legs.”
“What the fuck do you know about anything Sam?” Steve growled, thrashing about in the putrid stink. “Let me go this instant! I’m going to punch some fucking sense into his stupid fucking face. He can’t do this to us, Sam. He can’t do this to me!”
Tony scanned the open waters. No predators. No fish. Nothing out of the ordinary to cause him unease. But when he turned back to look at the ice, what he saw made it feel like time came to a standstill.
) They splashed in the water like children as the tropical sun beat down on their backs. They built a sandcastle along the beach almost three feet high and walked along the tide pool, checking out the local ocean residents as they swayed in the current. They did everything Tony could ever think of and accomplished nothing of importance. It was different and novel and wonderful.
“Steve!” he called after the shadowy figure as a set of elevator doors close around his silhouette. Tony walked faster. He needed to know. If he couldn’t salvage what they had, the least he could do was get a name or a face of the people that hurt Steve and do everything in his power to make sure it never happened again.
Okay, fine. Yes, Tony thought Captain flag was very attractive. A man in uniform with a kind smile and an adorable blush, how could Tony say no? But he wasn’t obviously gay. During their brief interaction, he hadn’t dropped any hints or shown any signs that he was into men. If Tony wanted to ask the Captain out on something akin to a date, he need to come up with a fool proof strategy to seduce his target. What would be the best way to capture his interest? A flirtatious smile? A subtle sexual innuendo? The possibilities were endless, but so were the risks.
“Steve, are you asking me to model for you? I’m flattered.”
“If you would, please. Anything helps.”
Three.
she could give in the circumstances.
“Trust me kid,” Tony muttered from under the covers. His voice low enough that only Steve’s super hearing could pick up. “You’ll have plenty of those, but you won’t get much sleep.”
Steve! What had happened to Steve? He looked around and saw Steve getting jumped by three guys. Two had his arms restrained and the third went for the body hits. Blood was running down over Steve’s eye, and he was already bent over in pain. Tony dug his fingers into the ground. He had to help Steve. Steve didn’t deserve to deal with this type of shit.
As he surged forward, Tony heard a pained groan from the ground. He debated ignoring it as he released a shoulder piece onto a blackened pile of rubble, but curiosity won out in the end. Tony cautiously walked over to the rubble. Looking down at the source, he felt a coldness descend over his heart.
Tony’s head whipped around. He bent down to get a clear view out the service window. Sure enough, American flag guy was staring right at Tony. Their eyes locked for just a second, but that was more than enough for Tony.
The kid could barely contain his disappointment. “Hurray! I mean, aw are you serious? Whatever will I do now?” he asked, cuddling up against Steve’s side.
“Of course I do,” said Steve. “I mean, I didn’t recognize him at first, but I know him.”
Steve shook his head in disbelief as the crowd began to disperse. “Nazi scum. Just because you have the right to way whatever you want doesn’t mean you should. We made it into America! Have a little respect.”
Stane pulled up a seat next to him. He ran a caring hand across Tony’s back. It was warm, and it felt so familiar. “Tony, I know you’ve got something cooking in that brain of yours, but you gotta tell me what’s going on. I can’t help you if you keep me out like this.”
Natasha didn’t say anything at first. She took a bite of her dog and chewed in silent solidarity. When she did speak, it was short and direct. “Give me the skinny. How can I help?”
“Bucky, I know you’re trying to help, but I really think you should go,” Tony said through the forest of fur.
Tony glowered.
Here's hoping you guys have a great two weeks!
Tony sprinted around the corner. Before Rumlow could release the energy, Tony shot that bastard in the back with just enough force to send the large man crumpling to his knees with a loud thump.
Stane laughed. “Always the joker, Tony. But we’re glad to have you back. Stark Industries hasn’t been the same since the crash. After your father-”
Jan’s mouth dropped in in disbelief. “Are you joking? How can you be so blind?” she squawked. “The guy you were eyeing up when you passed out donuts, the guy who couldn’t say more than three words to you without tripping over his own feet; the
Steve swept his pencil across the page with a confident smirk. “Maybe not, but I know for a fact that you’re too self-conscious for your own good.”
Tony took a sharp breath. “Really?” he asked, hardly believing his ears.
Steve smiled silently. Good old Jane Foster playing along with their antics. They were lucky such a pretty doll like her fit in so well with their little disaster of a family.
“I keep trying to tell you, he’s not Steve.” But it was too late. One were became two as the pure white wolf approached Steve.
“Yes Ms. Potts,” she said, cowering away from the desk. “I understand Ms. Potts. Thank you very much Ms. Potts.”
“Steve, let me help,” Tony wined, kicking the wooden crate Steve had so delicately told him to ‘sit and stay’ on. “Please?” Tony pushed out his bottom lip and quivered it for extra effect. They were on their last stop for the night and Steve had insisted they walk it instead of drive.
Tony let out a sigh of relief. Fell for it, hook, line, and sinker.
Nothing malicious, mind you. Tony’s morning drinks were still consumable and they all had caffeine in them. It’s just that sometimes Tony’s black coffee became a sakura late a la Sam Wilson, or a vodka shot with a side of coffee courtesy of one red headed spy. Clint tried to get Peter in on the joke just for fun, but the kid was too much of a good boy to willingly participate in their shenanigans. Steve, on the other hand, lasted about a week before he joined in.
As Steve made his way to the back of the quinjet, he tried to focus on finding the younger Tony and not dwell on Colonel Rhodes’ behavior. Rhodey was Tony’s friend. His oldest friend. It wasn’t surprising he’d be protective of Tony. Given Steve’s behavior over the Accords, his recent reconciliation with the Avengers, and the latest development in Steve and Tony’s relationship (them now dating), Steve expected a few extra shovel talks in the future. There were only a few people Tony trusted and despite being his boyfriend, Steve didn’t think he ranked up very high on that list anymore.
Steve looked up from his book and smiled. “You did? What did you make?” Steve asked as Morgan climbed up on the couch alongside him.
“Steve? Steve! It’s time to get up.”
“Oh, I already know that,” said Tony. “Aunt Peggy works with guns all the time and she’s really good with them.”
“Listen friend,” Steve said in a voice that was all but friendly. “I don’t know where you’re from, but in Brooklyn, loving someone for who they are or who they aren’t ain’t no thing. We may be a bit queerer compared to you folks in the Lower Eastside, but in Brooklyn if it ain’t your business, we don’t pay it no mind. If you or yours has problems with queers, or variants, or niggers, I best suggest you turn us down now before vicious words are the least of our problems.”
"I'm such an idiot! Why didn't I think of it earlier!"
“A little harder.”
Tony’s smile faltered. A cold panic welled up inside him.
Gives me an excuse to leave early.
“Daaad.”
“Wonderful.”
Steve tried not to let his frustration show. This was a very serious operation that needed to succeed. Now wasn’t the time to indulge in childish excitement over some inventor’s discarded toys. “Stop playing around,” ordered Steve. The guilt was beginning to claw its way into his gut and he didn’t have time to question the morality what they were doing. “If we can’t use it, put it back.”
A tired groan came from grey armor. “I was trying to protect you,” Rhodey conceded. “You haven’t been yourself since the fight with Steve and-”
Tony gave an approving nod and Steve got to work.
“Tony,” he said, voice strained and clearly tired of the whole shit storm. “We both agree that letting them get away with this is a bad idea. So let me help you.”
“Feds ain't gonna show,” Sam yelled back. “That car belongs to Hydra. And they've got the commissioner in their pocket.”
Steve quickly took away the plate and scrapped every trace of strawberry off the pancakes. “How about this, I’ll just take them off and eat them later. You know, something a
“And yet here I am; a successful entrepreneur with a thriving rehabilitation center airing my grievances out to one of the creatures I should be healing. What am I even doing here? I could be helping you. I could be helping so many magical creatures in need, and yet all I can think about is how miserable it is to be single.”
Steve was sitting on a stool across the dressing room door. A soft smile spread across his face as Tony strutted down an invisible runway. “I think it looks good on you,” he said. Because, of course, Steve loved everything the kid did.
Tony let out a tired sigh and rubbed his face. “That’s the thing Obie,” he said, pushing out of the chair and pacing across the room. His hands flew around his head in increasing frustration.
“Or a child of an immigrant,” the stranger said with a knowing look.
“HA HA.”
“Barton. Don’t you dare.”
“There you go. You already have a good example,” Steve said, flipping a pancake up into the air with a flick of his wrist.
, Tony thought,
Steve tried pulling again, but the exhaustion was catching up to him. Energy was leaking out of him like a broken faucet. He could do this. He had the willpower to do this. But he was just too tired to fight anymore. He was too tired to be strong anymore. Too tired of taking charge.  He was just too tired. He body went slack as he weakly tried to pull Tony to his side. His head lolled down as he stared at their hands.
“Tony,” Stane ruined the fun. As usual. “I hate to be a busy body, but we need something to show the board. We’re meeting with them this afternoon, remember? A prototype, a model, a sketching on a napkin. Anything you can give them.”
“Nothing,” responded Tony grateful for the distraction. “Just speculations about my romantic life.”
“As do I. Watch over him, friend. Should anything happen to Barnes, you shall be the first to know.”
“Okay, both of you need to shut up right now,” said Tony. This was quickly getting out of hand.
“Yeah, and look at all the good that did us,” Tony said with a snort, as he shoved his emotional baggage back down. He could always work through the trauma another day. “We can talk about reasons later. Right now, I want my weapons back and I want you to hit the track and get out of harm’s way.”
“Yeah,” Steve whispered. “Beautiful, fluffy, golden brown. I may not be the most well spoken person, but I know what I like.”
Tony smiled. “Yeah, he’s okay. We’re both okay.”
As an unassuming man with curly hair joined the group, it hit him. The Iron Family. The picture from the hit on Hydra. The helmet was the same shape as the picture in the paper. Steve was trying to try and strike a deal with the Iron Family. Tony had gotten him in contact with the Iron Family! Steve tried not to stagger back in shock. This was very serious levels of ‘not good.’ The Brooklyn Boys were trying to stay away from big names, keep out of the spotlight until things smoothed over in the underground. Instead, they were standing face to face with one of the newest, and seemingly, biggest name in the business. This was beyond the realm of ‘things not going according to plan.’
“Don’t look at me boss,” Clint called down from the catwalk as he shot an arrow down into the fray. “I sure as hell didn’t invite Wonder bread.”
That clearly caught Steve’s attention. “A little something extra?”
Steve shook his head. “No. I also think about the subject, too. If it’s a person, I think about why they look the way they do. Who they are, where they’ve been, what type of life they’ve lived and why they carry themselves in a certain way. Helps me give the drawing life and personality.”
Dr. Banner led them through the loading docks and down to a well-lit basement. He opened a heavy looking door and ushered the two gurneys in.
“Out at the moment I’m afraid,” Tony said, relieved that the question didn’t require him to think much. “I can make some more if you’re willing to wait a bit. I promise I’ll be worth it.”
“Yeah, no. You’re right. It’s fine. Everything’s fine,” Tony said, trying not to let the unwelcome surprise ruffle his feathers. He hadn’t planned on introducing Fluffy to other weres for at least a few weeks. Then again, if his failure with online dating was any indicator, life rarely gave him what he wanted.
Steve leaned down. His warm breath brushed the skin of Tony’s ear like a gentle, spring breeze. “Like this?” he asked again. His voice was soft, almost hesitant, as if  he was telling Tony a secret.
Then he heard it. The familiar cooing of a pigeon, but there was something. The pitch was a little higher than usual and pigeons weren’t known to be out at this time of night..
“Of all the dumb ways to die, I never expected it would be due to a paradox,” Bucky yelled over the din.
Steve slung one of Sam's arms over his shoulder to help him with the pain and give the guy a moment to catch his breath. “They ain’t messing around no more,” gasped Sam.
“I… What?” squeaked a scandalized Tony. “How in the world would
This wasn’t the man Steve went to war with. This wasn’t the man who fought by his side and fought against Steve’s every order. They hadn’t shared burgers at a dive bar or gotten trapped in Little Italy during a rainstorm. This wasn’t the same Tony that made fun of him for mixing up Star Wars and Star Trek and then proceeded to sit down with and educate Steve on the top twenty most influential science fiction movies to date. This wasn’t the man Steve had grown to love over the past few years. This wasn’t the man Steve wanted to marry. Not yet.
Natasha’s face softened. “I’m sorry,” she said quietly, placing a warm hand on top of his. He squeezed it for strength and she rubbed a comforting thumb across the back of his hand. “It’ll get better. You’ll see.”
Tony smiled behind the mask. “Nice shot Barton. Rescue is on body control, but looks like you two held down the fort just fine.”
Bruce crossed his arms. “Let me guess, you want protection?”
Bucky covered his head, holding Steve’s face to the ground as long as he could. Steve tried not to move, but survival instincts were screaming for him to get out of there as fast as he could.
But just as he was about to take another bite, Tony heard the fence shake. A gentle shake for once, and not the forceful rattle of someone trying to get out.
“Understood.”
“No thank you,” said Tony as he struggled to pull himself up on one of the bar stools. “Steve is going to make me pancakes.”
But it would never happen. At least, not as long as Tony worked for the army. It was impossible to pursue anything that went beyond a one-night stand. Or, at the very least, ill advised.
Bruce considered the request and then acknowledged it with a brusque nod. “Need to run it past the inner circle, but it shouldn’t be too much of an accommodation. For now, keep your heads low. We’ll be in touch.” Taking the two samples in hand, he headed toward a flight of stairs down to a basement and, most likely, a get-away-car.
Iron Man and Tony were one in the same. That meant that everything that Iron Man (mob boss and speakeasy owner) had done, Tony Stark (mild-mannered engineer) had also been okay with. Death, weapons of mass destruction, Tony was okay with all of that. He was okay with someone like Bucky getting hurt in the crossfires. Steve heart couldn’t understand something like that.
Tony puffed up his cheeks. “I told you, I’m not little. I’m six and a quarter years old.”
Natasha gave Tony an amused grin. Flattered, but compliments weren’t going to distract her from her goal. “How is he? I don’t see him,” she said, craning her neck around the rehabilitation center.
“Locations might be good,” voiced Pepper. All eyes turned to her. “I’ve been going through the papers; receipts, shipping documents, meeting notes, employee records, and I think I’m beginning to see a pattern.”
“But how long before you can send him back home?” asked Steve.
A violent shiver ran down the were’s body. Steve let out a sad howl and a layer of fur rolled off his body like the worst shed of the season.
“Don’t even start with me Barton. I know where you live,” Tony scolded playfully. He wasn’t in the mood for another talk about ‘the birds and the bees and other interesting things a duo could do’ anytime soon.
Steve shouldn’t have been scared of a man. But what he saw come out of the dust was something new and terrifying. War Machine was encased in a large mass of metal, making the man look broader and stronger than ever before. The large metal hands attached to the steel torso looked like they could crush a man without breaking a sweat. A captivating blue light emanated from the centre of War Machine’s chest, radiating raw energy.
Steve turned his gaze to Natasha, Wanda, and Vision. “And how about the rest of you?”
“Hey, it’s okay. It’s just me. You want to talk about it?” Steve asked as he knelt down.
“Still, it feels like I’m losing a competition against myself. Like I should bring him back just to ask him where to begin. Grab him by the lapels and say, ‘Do I take Steve out to a fancy restaurant or a tiny hole in the wall? Is he allergic to anything? Does he like long walks on the beach? Ten-foot bunnies? Tell me, other Tony. Tell me!””
Well, that was one way of looking at it. “I’ll… um… tell you when you’re older,” he said, trying to hide the flush creeping up his neck.
Steve isn’t eating.
Motherfucking bastards pointing long black muzzles at a saint. Lobbing grenades like rotten fruit at a stray dog. If it was the last thing he did, Tony would make them pay. He’d strangle them with his own calloused hands; paint the streets red with their blood. And if Pepper discovered a financial outlet, Stark Industries would ruin them and their good name for the rest of time. Whoever hurt Steve would wish for the sweet release of death.
It was just like Jan said, a few months ago the donut truck got ambushed as Tony, Carol, Jan, and Natasha made their way into central Europe. Their truck had gotten stuck in the mud when a small troop of German soldiers jumped out of the bushes and ambushed them. The enemy had gotten in a few good shots in when a mismatched group of Allied soldiers swooped in to save them.
“Because,” Tony said in a calm voice. “I remember waking up in my toy room sad that everything that’s happened in the last twenty-four hours was just a dream.”
But would he want to be? They had only spent a little time together, but it would be easy for Tony to imagine. Laughing over a meal. Steve sketching while Tony tinkered on his work in the lab. Maybe Tony could rent out a theater and they could watch movies together. Oh, who was he kidding, Tony could build them a movie theater and they could watch movies snuggled against each other on the couch. No other people. No other judgments. Maybe get some high quality wine imported from Italy. The kind with lots of zeroes on the price tag. That would be the life.
Iron Man stared down Clint with cold eyes as he pulled back on the trigger. He felt a satisfying chill run down his back as the associates looked away. The resulting shot was deafening as it echoed throughout the damaged building.
Thor readied his hammer, emitting a soft squeak from the well-worn leather.
Tony stopped. His hand hovered above the stove top. “Excuse me?”
“Gotta’ do something to keep me occupied,” Steve said as he followed Bucky back to base.
“Really?” asked Tony, leaning closer to the man he loved. “I was thinking something a little more sexually exciting.”
Sam let out a tired sigh. “That’s not an answer. ” His eyes drifted down to the cup in Steve’s side. “Did you drink any of that?”
“Good!”
“That’s okay,” Steve purred. He rolled his hips over Tony’s still sensitive cock, pulling one last erotic groan out of him. “They don’t need to know everything about my life.”
Steve’s cheeks burned as hot as their sex last night. “Let’s forget about that. How about I make you those pancakes like you asked?” he said, quickly ushering the kid away from his room and away from a very naked Tony.
“A what?” The door to the changing room opened with a bang.
The crowd erupted with energy. Steve squeezed his crossed arms in an attempt to hold his anger at bay. “Maybe we should,” muttered Steve. “Teach this Nazi lover a lesson once and for all.”
Bucky stared on in disbelief. “He… he doesn’t recognize me.”
The suit he wore was nice. A gently worn tweed jacket and trousers hugged his body and kept out the occasional nip of spring air (and considering the times, it looked in good condition). A miss-matched cap hid what looked like a mess of dark curls and a brilliant pair of brown eyes.
However, he needed to end it all now, for Steve’s sake as much as his own. Steve was an innocent in all this, and with Pepper finally making some headway in the paperwork department Tony couldn’t take any risks about Steve knowing too much or getting kidnaped and held for information. For the sake of the Iron Family and his company Tony had to focus on the mission and not his feelings.
Tony hummed as he read the blocky title at the top of the page. “’My family.’ Like the title, but why does Steve have a shield? Isn’t that Uncle Sam’s shield?”
"Honey, I'm home!"
Let's hope I got everything in for a coherent story. Thanks everyone for the kudos and the comments! Since I'm starting from scratch, I think I might switch to once a month update unless I can crank these chapters out faster. But, I'm coming up on the climax, so we'll see.
Tony couldn’t help but grin. The frozen weight on his shoulders melted off like water. Thank god everything worked out.
“No.”
Oh. That. Steve felt his heart sink into his stomach. “So, that’s all I am to you. A useful tool to do your dirty work.”
From deep beneath the covers, Tony groaned.
Right on cue, War Machine and Rescue ominously walked through the thick obstruction like it was nothing. Slowly, step by step, they encroached on enemy territory. Shot after shot, a member of Hydra fell to one of their blasts. But it wasn’t enough. Schmidt had enough man power that a small gaggle of street shit was able to take the Brooklyn Boys by surprise.
“Engaged and therefore of no interest to me," he said, brushing her off like a piece of lint on his suit. "Besides, Pepper has been at my side for years. She knows all my little quirks.”
He gave Tony’s cock a few more good sucks before releasing Tony’s member with a loud pop. White come glistened on his lips. “Good morning, beautiful,” Steve said with a satisfied smile. His cheeks were flushed red.
“Come on, Steve!” Tony said, trying to be as encouraging as possible while also fearing for the were’s safety. “You can do it.”
“No,” said Tony sarcastically. “It’s illegal for alcohol to be consumed in anything less than a whisky glass.”
“I should tell him what?” asked Steve, almost exhausted at the suggestion. “That I miss him?”
“Darn.” Tony mockingly snapped his fingers. “And here I was hoping you were secretly a Chris.”
Steve gave a forlorn look at the can, heavy in his hand, rotating it around with his thumb as if the answer was written on the simple label. His chest ached as he gave out a longing sigh. “He said there was a gal. Pepper. That’s what he called her.”
Their uniforms were tailored made to their body type, fighting style, and personality. A luxury reserved for those who went on top secret special op missions. From the collar of their jackets all the way down to their boots, these men’s uniforms were made out of a light, yet durable fabric that ranged from earthy brown to green all the way up to blue? Really? Red, white, and blue? On a military uniform? Whose bright idea was that? Sure the man’s blond hair was so eye catching that even Tony couldn’t ignore it, but that was no excuse for a ridiculous looking uniform. If you’re going to slap the American flag on an active military man, might as well have the guy carrying a giant target on his back saying ‘shoot me.’
“The Engineer does good work,” replied Iron Man with an affirmative nod.
Fair warning that there will be some period specific homophobic language due to the historical context, but I'm trying to keep it at a minimum. Please let me know if I need to tag anything else.
Shots rang out and a barrage of bullets rained down on him. Acting on instinct, Tony’s arms shot up to covered his head with the dusty red armor. The hard sound of machine gun fire combined with the high pitched pings of bullets ricocheting off his suit made it impossible for him to move forward.
“I… I don’t know if I’m strong enough.”
Steve didn’t give him the chance. He rushed at the goon hard and fast. Left hook to an eye. Upper cut to the jaw. Elbow to the gut. Heel dug into toes. Reopening wounds until the cement floor was a sea of red. With each hit from Steve’s fist, the goon looked less like a man and more like a worn punching bag.
“Not a dump, Pep. Poorly funded neighborhood.”
adult should do,” Steve said, making a point to glare at the adult onlookers.
Tony frown. “Okay,” he said with a dejected sigh. He looked down at his pancakes and his mood went from bad to worse. “What? Strawberries? I hate strawberries. They look weird and they have too many seeds.”
“Why not? He’s just a kid. You don’t even know him.”
“Now, let’s try this again.” Tony ground the heel of his boot into the man’s fingers. The man screamed, but Tony didn’t bat an eye. “Who sold you those weapons?”
When Steve found out Tony was Iron Man, the first emotion he felt was relief. Now, having had time to think about it, Steve’s feelings were more complex. Relief was still there but so was confusion, fear, anger, and sense of betrayal.
"Come on Sam. You gotta give me something to work with. I know the black community is crazy for gossip, and you're the best informant I got. You gotta give me something else to go on. A hunch? A guess?"
Tony snorted. It was true, but Natasha didn’t have to know that she was right. “So?”
Tony closed his eyes and clamped down on the urge to sigh dramatically. He really did. Tony loved Steve with all his heart. He’d put up with a lot of crazy stuff Steve did because he loved the man. But Steve didn’t need to know about that. His ego was already big enough.
It was for the best, right?
“But we have a run to do,” interrupted Jane.
He couldn’t find it. The receptionist gave him a strange look. Steve smiled his most innocent smile and proceeded to pat down and empty all the pockets on his body only to come up snake eyes.
Tony snapped out of his daydream. “Y-yeah. Looks okay,” Tony said, trying hard to focus on the dough and not on the growing hard on in his pants. The dough wasn’t perfect. A bit uneven around the edges, a little too dry because Steve had thrown extra flour on the table, but overall it wasn’t bad for a first try. Tony had done worse during service.
“It’s just a joke,” Bruce reminded Tony.
Bucky raised a questioning eyebrow. “We taking bets on this?” he asked, completely serious.
“Tomorrow,” said Steve as he pulled the blankets up to Tony’s chin, “we will find a way to send you back home. You’ll see. Adult you is really smart.”
“Steve, wait,” Tony reached into a small compartment in his armor and pulled out a small earpiece. “You should be able to talk to us through this. It’s a remote radio I’ve been working on. Fun size. Still having some problems transmitting and receiving, but it should be good in a pinch.” With gentle fingers, Tony placed the device in Steve’s palm and folded the large fingers around the temperamental tech. “Try not to get yourself killed, okay?”
“What?” Tony could have asked him what two plus two was and he still would have been too distracted to answer.
“I think there’s more important things going on right now, don’t you think?” insisted Steve, pulling a bit at Tony’s arm. Worried lines were etched deep in his face.
Suddenly, the door burst open. Steve jumped back as Morgan ran into the room. “Purple Princess Morgan reporting for duty! Ready to go Steve?”
Desperately, he scanned the room again. Maybe he had missed someone. Maybe Steve had taken a quick trip to the john and would come out at any second.
“So, just to be clear, don’t climb the fence and jump into the wolf enclosure.”
So when Tony finally found out about the prank, Steve was more than a little disappointed.
“So you still have your tongue huh?” said Iron Man with distain. “Rescue, bag ‘em up and take them to the lab. I want them ready for Hulk to question when I get back.”
“I was going to tell you the day of the drop,” Rhodey said, trying to defend himself. “But Rescue said unless it was life or death-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Two weeks after the rum run, Steve found himself in front of a recently refurbished store front.
“Then put Jarvis on what you can’t handle and let me run our companies. I can handle being a big boy for a few weeks.”
“I swear,” Tony whispered into Steve’s ear as he ran a comforting hand across Steve’s back. “I will make them pay for what they have done. I will make their blood dye the streets red. I’ll make their screams become the sound of nightmares children fear. You have my word, Steve. I will make all those who oppose you learn to fear the name Iron Man.”
“We are not giving him a Captain America doll.”
Tony was silent a few more minutes as he watched Steve turn out two more perfectly golden pancakes. “Steve, can a man be a wife?” Tony asked as Steve poured the last of the batter into the pan.
Bucky shouldered the rifle, eyes up and alert for anything suspicious.
Tony mouthed a quick “thank you” before taking off toward Steve’s voice.
“A run for it? I don’t think he’d be that-”
Steve paused. Lips parted and hesitant. "What?"
“Yeah, just a black eye, thank god.”
“I thought everything would be better,” said Tony. He tried his best to hold back his emotions (“To be a man,” like his father said) but the cracks in his defenses grew bigger and bigger with each second.
“You agree with this shit?” If Tony had full functionality of his arms, he would have thrown them up in exasperation. “That’s it. Barton is starting a mutiny. He’s going to get you all on his side and then, when I least expect it, you’ll assault me in my sleep and dump me on the side of the road with only a banjo to keep me company.”
But Steve was not like his Viking family. He was small, skinny, and could barely lift the lightest ax despite reaching full maturity. He sneezed himself silly in spring, burned his skin to a crisp in summer, was useless for harvests in fall, and toed the line of frostbite every winter. Steve Rogers was the weakest runt ever born in recent memory, but that wouldn’t have mattered if the blacksmith’s son would just give him the time of day.
Taking a deep breath, he approached the young woman at the reception desk. “Hi,” he said, swearing to anyone who heard that his voice did not squeak. “I’m looking for Tony,”
“Yeah,” Tony tried to play it off as casual conversation. Steve didn’t need to know that the friend he was speaking of was Iron Man of the Iron Family. See Pepper, aliases are useful. “One of my friends is opening a new business in a couple of weeks, and they asked me to look into some local providers to help them celebrate. You wouldn’t happen to know any, would you?” he heavily hinted.
“Well, I managed it, didn’t I?” Tony said with a confident smile. The same smile that made Steve lose control of himself the night before and come all over Tony’s face.
Tony, son of Howard Stark, was the most beautiful man in the village. His light brown hair was soft like long grass as it swayed in the wind. His dark eyes glowed like coals in the fire. His whit was sharp and his laugh was like sparks off a hot sword. He was lithe in build, but could hold his own against the meanest Vikings. He was strong enough to topple giants, smart enough to outwit the biggest brute, and brave enough to face down a boar with nothing more than his bare hands.
Bucky shrugged. “Suit yourself. Just be careful. You heard what Sam said last week”
“I’m not harassing,” Stane looked very offended. “I’m just asking about the future. Once she gets married, she’s not going to stick around much longer.”
“Sold, gift, call it whatever you like. I want to know who gave it to you.”
Steve’s brain slowly began to process the situation and realize how bad in an idea it was. "What? No. Sam, we can't have a civilian running around." There was absolutely no way Steve was going to let Tony get in harm’s way. Especially with Hydra out there and all up in arms.
Could you come by after ur date?
The mouse of a gal stood up instinctively, hiding behind a small clipboard of paperwork. “But Mr. Stane told me to keep an eye out for you.”
“He’s a little shy, so be nice,” Steve warned. He tapped the kid on the shoulder. “Hey. Say hi to everyone.”
“Well don’t get used to it,” Tony said, trying to act as if the request was something as boring as a milk run. “I’m only doing it this once”
Quick as he came in, Iron Man veered off and away from the main fight. He ran as hard as he could in a straight toward the center of the building. No time or energy for weaving in and out of aisles. He just had to trust that his family would pick off any unwanted tagalongs, and that Steve would be right behind him when he turned around.
The frustration and concern must have shown on his face because her eyes softened at the display of concern from her friends. “Don’t worry, boys,” she reassured them. Her voice was like warm, soft hands. “I’m a big girl. I know what I’m doing.”
Steve chuckled. “You know, whenever you say that, it makes me want to change that answer to a yes,” he growled, tracing the outline of Tony’s half hard cock through the thin sheet.
Shit. Was this the same War Machine that Sam had told him about weeks ago? How much had Tony told them? The Brooklyn Boys were too small to need an armed bodyguard on premise.  The hell was going on to require something like this?
“You’ll excuse me if I don’t believe you.” Steve looked up toward the light and then back at Tony like he was trying to decide the lesser of two evils. He bent down, and laid a hand on Tony’s uninjured shoulder. “I’m going to get us a cab. Wait here until I get back,” his voice was quiet, as if trying his best to reassure the both of them.
“The one and only,” Tony said, more than a little nervous to meet the pack in person.
"Yeah, I really did.” Tony’s voice was soft to Steve’s ears. No air of superiority. No malice or anger. Just Tony. Steve liked that. “But, you know, maybe you can pay me back by making me the first person you put in there."
“We have to stop,” Steve said between kisses.
At that moment, Steve looked perfect under the dim streetlamp. The contours of his face highlighted in golden light, a light dusting of color on his cheeks that could easily be mistaken for an affectionate blush. A small white cloud of warm breath in the cool, spring night that swirled carelessly in the air between them. In stupid bravery, Tony gravitated closer to Steve, in hopes of catching that cloud with his mouth. Steve’s breath hitched, but he didn’t move away. Tony saw the heaviness of each breath in the night air as each cloud grew larger and denser with each second. Tony’s own whitened breath merged with Steve’s, and wasn’t that just perfect.
The wolf turned around and saw Tony on the other side of the tall, metal fence. He howled and ran at the gate, crashing headfirst into the sturdy metal. Peter jumped back. He was young. Stuff like this was still new to him. Tony, on the other hand, had seen his fair share of feral creatures and knew his limits.
She looked up, and stared him down with her dark brown eyes. “I’m sorry, who?” she asked.
“Was a friend,” insisted Tony. “Nothing else. He wasn’t importan-”
“What about Bucky? What if something happens to him?” asked Steve.
Realization hit Steve like a steam train. Wait, hadn’t Natasha found work in California? Was something wrong?
“Considering you didn’t even notice me while you were eyeing that blond hunk in the breadline, I highly doubt that," he huffed.
“Chicken sandwich, hold the mayo,” she said, shoving a white wrapped package into Tony’s hands. “Eat.”
Steve let out a wistful sigh. “I couldn’t stop even if I wanted to. And, believe me, we both tried.”
The kid’s eyes snapped over to Tony. The joy drained from his face. “Daddy?”
“Come on, Steve. You gotta let me go.”
“No, I don’t want some kid’s book,” Tony said kicking under the blankets. “I want a war story.”
“Bucky!” Steve’s voice was filled with panicked desperation. The figure in the distance darted over to an unmoving body lying by a large cluster of fractured cement. “Hang on Bucky. Everything is going to be okay.”
All of a sudden, the kisses along Tony’s skin stopped. The grip on Tony’s cock loosened and the weight of Steve’s hand disappeared. Tony stifled a whimper. He didn’t want it to end now. He hadn’t come yet.
Steve leaned down and kissed Tony’s exposed forehead. “Really. You’ve been so busy lately. It feels like I barely see you anymore.”
“That’s okay,” said the kid as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. “I’m sure I’ll like anything you pick out.”
“Why do you guys always pick me to help with the kid?” Clint yelled from the front. “He won’t let anyone handle him besides Steve. Let him take care of the kid.”
Okay. That’s all Tony need to hear to confirm that this random kid was a younger version of him. Tony had forgotten how big a fan of Captain America he was back in the day. “Fascinating story kid, but how about we save it for another day.”
Oh dear god. “Everyone? You told everyone?”
“Doesn’t matter how many horses I shoe, how many weapons I create, or how many drinks I have, everything still hurts. I tried going to a brothel like some of the guys at the bar suggested, but when I looked around at what they had to offer, I just couldn’t. Did matter how beautiful the ladies were, I just couldn’t stop thinking about you.
Clint took pity on him. “Come on. Let’s get you to Bruce and patched up.”
“You know you can’t have it, right? It’s full of stuff that’s not good for you; chemicals, preserves, salt, grease. The only reason I’m eating it is because I’m okay with that kind of stuff in my body.”
The hope in Tony’s eyes faded. His smile disappeared. He looked down at his hands and tried to hide the disappointment on his face. “So, I was mistaken then. You and Bucky. You guys are… You’re seeing him.”
Steve tried to look for a trail of blood splatters, but everything was squeaky clean.  No sign of Phil and not a single sign what had happened to Tony or where Tony had gone. Running out of breath, Steve slowed down and tried to collect himself. He twisted the card once more in his hand, reassuring himself that he wasn’t going crazy, he really had been tricked.
Steve didn’t answer.
“Tony,” growled War Machine.
But at what cost? As much as Steve adored Tony, and still did despite their fight, Tony wasn’t family. And family always came first.
Tony’s stomach dropped. “You’ve got to be kidding me. Two of the brightest minds in the universe, and you don’t think we can’t figure out time travel in less than a year?”
In frustration, Tony threw down his pair of wire cutters and plopped down in an empty chair. Why didn’t Obie understand? Why didn’t anybody understand? Why couldn’t the world just put its revolutions and political uprisings on hold until he figured everything out!
“I thought you said you would find us a weapons cache. “
Iron Man batted away the gun like it was nothing before landing a punch right in the kisser. Steve went down like a ton of bricks, shocked that he hadn’t been knocked out by the intensity of the hit.
to an early morning make out session with a super soldier. Peak of human perfection indeed.
Thor and Sam looked at one another, a silent debate passing between them. “Our alliance lies with the Captain,” summarized Thor. “You have our trust until he says otherwise. But be warned, I will not hesitate to dismember you if you betray us.”
. And just as suddenly as it started, it all stopped.
... Why the fuck do you keep growing you little shit!
Steve had to get it down.
Tony groaned and hung his head frustration. Of all times to be a stubborn ass, now was not the time. “Steve-”
Once the door shut behind him, Tony turned to his daughter and gave her a stern look. “Okay Morgan, remember the plan? You need to look super cute during practice and I’ll whip us up an amazing dinner.”
“I like girls Steve!” he yelled, trying to convince himself more than Steve that it was true. “I always have, and I always will. So just do yourself a favor and forget everything that happened. Please.”
‘Ms. Potts’ gave the card a disinterested once over as if she was examining the finish on her nails. “What was your name again?”
Steve squinted his eyes. “Is that…”
“Aye, but her lack of presence still troubles me.”
“But he doesn’t deserve to disappear either,” said Tony. He was glad to be back. Absolutely thrilled that the others had thought he was important enough to bring back. But at the expense of someone else, especially a loved one? Tony didn’t feel he deserved that opportunity. “Do you miss him? The other me?”
“I assure you, he’s in the best of care,” the gentleman replied, voice and posture returning to a non-threatening default. “Our organization has no intention of doing him any harm. However, the one you should be concerned about is you. Your ‘association’ with that man could land the Brooklyn Boys in a whole heap of trouble you’re not even close to being ready for.”
“Because once you sent those people home, they may never come back!” Stane bellowed at the top of his lungs.
A high pitched ring pierced his ears as he slowly shook himself back into reality. Steve tried to stand, but his entire body trembled like a fall leaf. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the guys come over to help him up; mouths moving a mile a minute, faces covered in worry. Steve to shake out the empty screams in his head, but he wasn’t able to make out a word beyond the deafening white noise. He tried to ignore the pain, but it was no good. Steve’s body refused to move any faster than required.
“What is going on out there?” asked a voice, heavy with a natural German accent.
Tony’s face flushed red and like the coward he was, Tony immediately ducked behind the steel counter. “Holy shit, Jan,” Tony hissed. “Why did you tell me he was looking this way?”
Carol gave Tony a wink. “Thanks for the easy money.” Together she and Steve’s friend pulled down the awning and covered the windows of the truck.
Steve arms wrapped around the boy. “What are you… Are you talking about your older self?”
‘Maybe there’s another way,’ he thought, ambling over to the large plush couch in the corner of the workshop. He flopped down face first, allowing the makeshift bed to swallow him up in a warm embrace. The perfect mix of soft and firm reminded his fatigued brain of a certain angry someone.
“Tony! This is serious!”
Angry heat burned his cheeks as his eyes welled up with tears. Furry and sorrow clawed at his chest as he tried desperately to hold back the waterfall of emotions. “You weren’t there,” his voice cracked. “You weren’t there to hear those bastards drive off , and how stupidly happy those fuckers were when they thought I died, not giving a damn about who they had to shoot through to get to me.”
“What does it do now?”
“No!” Steve yelled, jumping at the force of his own voice. He pulled back, realizing that it was too much force and not enough explanation. He cleared his throat. “No, but I thought you were trying to keep your nose clean.” Ex-Russian spy, poking around in places where she shouldn’t, not always a good thing if the feds stopped by to pay a visit.
But a question hung in the air. Not an important one. They had talked a lot about the important ones over the years. This was something Tony had wanted to ask ever since Steve first requested Tony to model for him.
“Remember, we used to play fight in the park when we were pups. Mom would always yell at us for ruining our clothes, but we did it anyway. Remember that?” asked Bucky, desperation thick in his voice.
Tony rolled his eyes. As far as he was concerned, the discussion never happened and would never be brought up again. “What you got for me Brucie bear?”
“Don’t worry. You’re not the only one who could be doing more for this relationship,” Steve said with a reassuring smile. “I could try harder, too. Sometimes I think we’re too alike. We’re workaholics. We’re both prone to tunnel vision and with everything that’s been going on in politics, new heroes and villains popping out of the woodwork left and right; not to mention the calls for extra security and non-life-threatening emergencies, it’s hard to maintain a relationship.”
“Then prove  those muscles aren’t just for show. Put your back into it and knead that dough. Like this.” Tony said as he gently pushed Steve out of the way so he could demonstrate.
“Aw, Steve. You’re going to give me cavities with how sweet you are,” Tony say, wrapping his arms around the back of Steve’s neck.
Tony grinned. Oh, they definitely weren’t talking about food anymore. “I’m interested in teaching you. Maybe after a few lessons you can join the donut truck, become partners, maybe even something more? You know, if you’re interested. I hear the benefits are very good,” said Tony, turning the flirt up to eleven. Now that Tony knew Steve was interested and they had a little privacy,  Tony had to make up for his lack of game earlier. Steve was an impressive man in more ways than one. He deserved to be wooed off his ass.
Tony was ready to give up and just let the guy have at it until the cows comes home when a large mass streaked overhead, knocking Tony’s assaulter to the ground. Tony barely caught himself from falling at an odd angle with his injured arm. The lightning bolt of pain surging up his body sure didn’t make the catch worth the effort. Face twisted, his mouth dropped open in silent agony.
Bruce shrugged. “Don't matter to us. We're not going to get much out of him until he recovers.”
“Jan!”
Sam nodded in solidarity. He placed a comforting hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezed it gently. He didn’t say anything for a moment. Just let the silence speak for itself. When he did speak, it sounded like a light joke, but felt a whole lot heavier. “Guess that’s it for the guns, huh?”
The towel stilled. “About what?”
“Then we’ll be the first," Tony stated, as if just saying it made it happen.
“Well, I don't see anyone else lining up to take care of helpless little Tony. Looks like I'm the best you got.” Sam said, all sass and no give.
"Fine," grumbled Bucky. As much as Bucky bitched and moaned, Steve knew Bucky was always there to back him up with whatever was necessary.
Hours later, they lay in bed together, Steve’s chest plastered against Tony’s side. Both looking up at Tony’s hand as he held the ring above their heads so it could sparkle in the moonlight.
“Second,” Pepper concurred.
“Uh huh. I’m sure you make the best pancakes.”
Bucky swore under his breath as he grabbed the morning paper.
That bad, huh
“Keep telling yourself that,” Tony said with a disgusted smirk. “Who knows? Someday you might be a better liar than Loki.”
Steve let up on the pressure on the guy and took the card with his blade wielding hand. He blinked in confusion. This side was blank. He turned it over and that side was blank too. Quickly, he moved to try and get better lighting on the card. Maybe it’s in that really fancy ink that only shows up in certain light. He spun it, and again nothing.
feel a pang of jealousy as they walked in.
“Of course not, Tony. No one could even come close to replacing Howard," reassured Stane. "No, I brought you here to begin your own legacy. Perfect timing, if I do say so myself. Morale is low. The fall in stock hit us hard. Had to let go of a few thousand workers. But this is your chance to step out of your father’s shadow and make a name for yourself. To do something. To make something only Tony could do. Not Howard. Make a name for yourself. Make the 'S'in SI stand for Tony Stark not Howard Stark."
She gave Steve a wink and left in a flurry of red hair.
“I highly doubt he’ll figure that out,” Steve said as he slipped into a pair of briefs.
Steve pulled back the top of the box and revealed a simple gold band. “Anthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?”
“So what?” Natasha asked with a shrug of her shoulders. “You gonna to scold me for going above and beyond your expectations?”
“Uh huh, but it’s cloudy.”
Tony turned around and made a beeline for the door. He heard Steve whine, but he refused to look back. Injured or not, he wasn’t sure if he could say no to Puppy Eyed Steve a second time.
“Kids?” asked Steve.
“I think I’ve had enough fun for today, thank you very much,” Tony said as he leaned back into his chair. “Besides, I like watching you chase fish. It’s fun.”
“And your things?”
“If you don’t have any objections,” Steve murmured as his eyes fluttered shut. “I’ll just help myself.” He drifted forward into Tony’s space and Tony, not really able to think of a reason not to, leaned in to meet Steve halfway.
"Yeah, not your average Joe, that's for sure."
A loud crunch of shifting gravel from the outside.
Tony offered Steve a reassuring smile. “No big deal. I'll see you around Steve.” Tony patted Steve on the shoulder as he left. "Go play doctor. I can see myself out."
Steve glared at the man. “Tony, just let him have the doll.”
“Good point,” said Tony with a smile. Steve ducked down into a cabinet to pull out the bottle the gang had opened up last night. They always tasted a bottle of the product before they shipped it out. Didn't mean they always finished off what they opened.
Tony was the first to break the silence. “God, I hate it when he’s right.”
“That’s not… There’s just some things married couples do that you’re not old enough to understand.”
The loud noise was beginning to mute his hearing. “Why the hell would they follow a man like Schmidt?”
“If you had just waited in the car,” Runlow said, trying to defend himself. “We coulda –“
She stopped him mid-sentence. “What did you tell me back in Russia?” she asked, jabbing a finger into Steve’s face. “Whatever happens, we do it together. Same goes for you Steve. I may be trying to keep myself on the straight and narrow, but I’m not heartless. I know you have a hard time asking for stuff, but if you ever need me, you know I’ll back you up. I owe you, Steve. And you know how much I hate owing favours to people.
Yeah, but that wasn’t the same. … Was it?
“A friend.”
“Look,” she said, beginning to get impatient. Apparently Miss Brown Eyes didn’t get the message that when the boss tells you to piss off, you piss off. “I know you’re busy, but I promise this will only take a minute. I just need you to sign these papers and then I’ll get out of your hair.”
Not wanting to air out his dirty laundry in public like this, Steve glared at Sam.
“Morning Steve,” Tony muttered.
Steve crawled back up Tony’s chest and kissed him with blowjob-red lips. Tony groaned as Steve slipped some of Tony’s own seed into his mouth. A little bitter, but fuck it tasted good coming off of Steve’s tongue. Tony held Steve’s hips in place as he tried to rut against Steve’s thigh with his softening cock. Tony was still a bit tired, but it was the good kind. Steve had sucked all the stress and fatigue of his body out through his cock, leaving Tony a pliant mess on the sheets. “You taste like rainbows and sunshine,” Tony muttered as Steve broke the kiss.
“That’s okay,” said Tony, unperturbed the adult’s comments. “It’s what Aunt Peggy said too after she hit him on the head with a frying pan. She and Uncle Obie aren’t allowed in the house at the same time anymore.”
Follow me on my tumbler and see all the shit I reblog.
“We cannot be too careful with the threat of an enemy combatant,” reassured Thor. “Tis better to be cautious than find our comrade’s face in the morning paper.”
“No, should I?” He was beginning to get the feeling that he really should know what the hell was going on.
Steve smiled. He would like Tony to model for him. Tony would make a great model. If the callouses on his hand were anything to go by, Tony would probably have a few cuts and scars on his body. Those were always fun to draw. Steve would like drawing that.
Tony’s entire body jumped. “Fuck! Off. Off!”
Sam joined him on the curb, letting the white noise of cars on the street fill in the silence.
“Will he be okay?” Steve asked. His voice sounded weak. No wonder considering as his mind and body were still in shock.
“Yeah,” Tony said, not knowing what the fuck he was talking about but choosing to run with the idea. “Maybe it’s like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation. Steve recognizes you, but for some reason, the wolf persona doesn’t.”
“Well, now that you have a partner for the run, it does put us more at ease,” said Thor.
She looked at the card once more. “Daisy, please make a visitor’s pass for Mr. Steven Rogers.”
“Someone must be messing with the top brass. Alliances tend to shift with power changes,”considered Rhodey.
Steve’s smile came out as forced. He looked in Tony’s eyes, looking for something, but for the love of God, Tony couldn’t figure out what. Steve’s face changed to that of one with resolve and pressed his lips against Tony’s. It’s too short, too much pressure forced onto one area, but feeling Steve’s plump pink lips against his own made Tony melt upon contact. “For the record, I like girls too, but I also like you,” he whispered, face already flushed to the max as they broke apart. “Be back soon.”
