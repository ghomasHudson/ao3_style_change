Happy didn't hold back and gave him a big bear hug, after a few seconds he pulled him away hands still firmly on his shoulders "If anything happens, just insist that they call us, despite their hippie-dippy policy, okay?"
"Now it's done". as he started to clean his brushed his phone started to ring."Just on time...um sport could you get it?". He said as he looked down at his paint-covered hands.
"These are...nice?" Maria held up the onesie in her hand as she got a better look, it was good quality but plain, like something you buy for a baby shower where you don't know the gender of the baby, or you aren't close with the parents.
"So, this is what betrayal feels like?" he let out yet another yawn "oh, that's cool we always do stuff like that and...um almost midnight?"
"Yeah, but it's like 8 for me, I have an hour before bedtime".He wiggled around the closet trying to get comfortable.
"If you're too tired you can sleep for another hour or so" His pops suggested as he finished cooking breakfast.
He pointed at the drawing of Sam and Bucky, which were connected to each other by a red string. Indicating, that they were married, and their two drawings were connected to Steve's with blue strings, indicating friendship but Bucky's also had a green string, which meant family.
"So how about you, invite your husband to dance, we drink some more champagne and we eat some cake and then I can take you to our room and ride you like there's no tomorrow"
He handed his pops back his drink who was looking at as he had just started speaking French out of the blew
Peter said still holding the fuzzy toy close to his chest, once his dad was gone, he placed it on the bed next to the pillows and ran to get his glasses out of his backpack and hide them, one thing was spidey but explaining why he had his friend's glasses, he would get him more than a blank stare.
He grabbed the bottle of champagne and poured it into two glasses handing on to his new husband and raising the other in his hand.
He told himself, before getting off the bus and got in line with the rest of the campers. It didn't take long for one of the staff members to come up to him with his big yellow duffle bag at hand, and a phone that had a note stuck on it with Ben's name written on it.
It was funny at the start of the day he couldn't picture his pops and dad together, but now? it was clear as day, he could even imagine much more than the version of them in the ripped up photo, instead, he pictured the four of them, but not in an L.A, in his mind they were in Brooklyn, in the apartment, he and Peter would probably share a room and just like in the isolation cabin he would have to wake up peter twice. His dad would probably greet them both, by ruffling their hair and say something that would make them laugh while pops would make breakfast and give them a warm "Good morning".
"I know your pops' responds is always, that he'll tell you when you're older but even though, I would follow him to hell and back but that doesn't mean that I agree with everything, so, I say you give your old man, a taste of his own medicine, and be as stubborn as he is, and sure, he'll crack and no time."
Peter froze, he was entering full panic mode, was this game over? He glanced at the window, thinking that maybe he could roll out of the car like in the movies without getting hurt.
Peter let out a giggle as she did this, maybe Ben just wanted to scare him and his godfather was just bad at poker.
"How did they even do that, do one of them have super strength or something, who the hell even did it!"
his dad let out a dry chuckle at that."Thanks. That really was a lifetime ago I think you were nearly two months old at the time, we had just brought you home"
Steve said with a chuckle and instead of telling his son to let go he just wrapped one arm around Peter's waist and with his other free hand, he lifted the luggage and got up from the ground, and started walking towards the car.
Ben grabbed what was left of his previous winnings, and put them into the pile, as he did Peter took off his glasses, so he could clean them, but given what they were doing it gave the wrong impression.
Tony said with a nervous laughter as the realization that he had just eloped in a ship hit him like an iceberg
"Wow!, buddy, are you okay there, what happened?" His dad sounded worried when he was surprised hug tackled.
Peter, Johnny, and Miles were heading back to the cabin. Somehow Peter had convinced Johnny to give him a piggyback on the way back, while Miles was throwing the basketball, he had in his hands up onto the air and catching it.
"That one? a lifetime ago, I was afraid your grandma Maria might steal my baby, she refused to let go,"
Ben asked his brother as he lifted the scissors that they manage to sneak in. It was their last day at the isolation cabin, and this was their last chance to do this before they had to rejoin every other camper into the schedule, so they wouldn't have that much free time anymore. They were in the bathroom so the clean-up would be easy, and they would be close to a mirror, and Ben wouldn't have to do this blind.
"I was just looking through them to make sure nothing else was missing, don't ask it's a long story"
Peter remembered that guy from last years Stark Expo and he did not like him, Jhonny even said, he gave him and he quote "Creep vibes", and now he was sending stuff to his dad? he didn't like it but he is sure it was nothing, right?
Steve said shaking his head."Also, this is a two-way street because the day you and Sam have kids that's when I'll have my revenge "
He watched the woman's smile curl, he glared at them but for a second he saw the woman's eyes widen as if something had scared her. "Well congratulations,"Â  she said hastily before walking away fast as she could. he looked up at his aunt and she winked at him, okay, maybe she could be scary but he was glad the woman was gone.
"Come on, I saw this cool game, I want to try it out before we eat." He got out of the hug and ran towards the game, but he turned on his heels and faced his dad."I missed you like crazy too."
Ben was getting ready to pull it out, taking a hold of the big black straps. But his luck meter seemed to run out in that instance, as he watched his bag get buried right before his eyes, as five more bags were tossed on top of it,
Peter took what he wrote, then pinned it on the board under their parents picture it was a note that said:
"I mean think about it, pops, I was at a new place for 4 weeks, with new experience, and now, I'm coming back. And it's like I'm coming back as someone new, you know?"
Not even getting a chance to finish his question, Luke had already managed to get his bag out, without hesitation.
"Well when you have a spot open in your schedule, let me know, and we can discuss your plans for next summer, Mr.Stark"
"Don't worry, I got this...now...you said something about a note?". He tucked the phone between his shoulder and ear and rested his head on the wall.
Maybe the problem was that he didn't know him that well. All he really had of him, was an old picture and blurry memories, he never really gave a personality to the man in the photo.
"Nothing, your hair is just growing in weird, this is why I tell your pops not to cut it at home, this part looks like you cut it with a pair of old scissors while blindfolded.
"You know I met your parents before they got divorced, some people say that how their relationship ended wasn't surprised, that they were too different, but that's not what I saw, in a strange way they were absolutely perfect for each other, and to be honest I've never seen your Pops happy as he was with your dad, not to mention making those two Knuckleheads finally faced each other and actually talk sounds like a dream come true"
"...I mean there's no need for that, I'll hold on to him, and later I'll see how I can get it back to him". Before Steve could say anything else Peter salvation came in the form of a knock
He didn't cry that night, he sat there, Obie's hand on his shoulder, squeezing it a little too tight, as the doctor gave the news. He apologized as if he had anything to do with it.
After the campfire, everybody who was present for the poker game sneaked out of their cabins, and headed straight for the deck, for the big event. Everyone except for Luke and Danny, who had been caught outside their cabin by one of the counselors, when they tried to sneak off and were forced to stay behind so they wouldn't raise any suspicion.
but before he got to the bathroom he heard a loud thump, he turned around and noticed a table filled with papers, it kinda reminded him how the workshop would look like when his dad and uncle Bruce were working, there was one guy sitting there but he couldn't good look at him, do to the fact that he was trying to get his notes from under the table, he also noticed a pen on the ground not far from the where he was sitting, he figured it belonged to the messy guy, He picked it up and walked over to him.
He wanted to yell out in glee but before he knew it, he was already running into the car, with his dad holding him tight.
" This looks fine." He said to himself, he was in the middle of admiring his work, when his door flew open, and before he knew it he was being grabbed and placed over an unfamiliar shoulder.
"Uncle Bucky told me this would be a good idea to say hi to you ".He said in a shy smile, both his pops and uncles broke into uncontrollable laughter.
Ben knew he must have looked like a deer in headlight much like his dad had, he quickly took them off and cleaned them on his shirt.
Peter took a step back not wanting his pops to notice he had contacts lenses on, but this didn't stop Steve, that grabbed his wrist to keep him in place
"You both claim it was an accident, so how about you take off your helmets, apologize to each other, and shake hands?" The two boys were hesitant for a while. With Ben curling his fingers into Fist and Peter with his hands over his chest
Peter was pretty sure that's the only reason why his aunt had carried him to his room was that she wanted to make sure he didn't crash into anything else on his way there.
That made Ben laugh, he noticed that his dad much like Peter, his dad had the ability to make him do that without even trying.
"Yeah, like maybe we could build a pillow fort in the living room and watch some movies, you know could be fun."
"Ignoring the fact that you two are in cahoots, I should let you know that Nat might have found you a new place "
The nerves were getting to him again, he started playing with his hands, eventually bringing Â it close to his mouth, with the intention of biting off his nails. But was stopped by the sound of his father's voice.
"No...I mean...no, not like that".Peter bit the inside of his cheek, the way his dad was talking reminded the when he spilled the water on himself. "What I meant, Ben was that we knew what to do when the other was sad or what would make the other laugh, you know?"
"I had this since I was nine, and found it on my dad's desk and it's ripped...right down the middle".
He said with a shaky voice before running over to where he had left the metal container, with all his photos and started to look through them.
Peter was laying his face on the table, he felt very tired, he didn't even put on his eye contacts, The plan was to get up ten minutes after his pops left for his run, and would put them on then and get ready for the day, but he had slept in, which meant that plan went out the window, so right now he accepted that he was blind, he figured this wouldn't be a problem and he would just put them on when he brushed his teeth and maybe being tired would help him not be grossed out.
"I haven't gotten to the weird part, for one I know a lot about my biological parents, my dad never kept that secret from me...well except for their last names, but I know their first names, I also know that they were scientists and that my first last name came from an aunt I had, who according to my dad loved me more than the universe itself but who sadly passed away. I know it's messy, but I'm not done, another weird thing is that it wasn't always me and my pops, he used to be married to my other dad, but he left when I was really little, all I know about him is that he used to sing me these lullabies and play piano".
As Peter reached for his dumplings, his phone went off like crazy, he got it out and saw that Ben was texting him non-stop.
The picture was a little blurry, the first thing that caught his attention wasn't Peter's dad, it was the robotic arm wearing a Dunes hat. But once he looked past it, he could see a man in the background, it was hard to make out what he looked like because of the quality of the picture, and also the safety goggles he was wearing obscured his face, but you could still tell he had dark hair, and it looked like he was tinkering with something.
"Or maybe, you have a secret twin, or better yet, maybe he's you from a different universe, but a freak accident happened and he ended up in this universe?!" Miles responded with his own theories.
it'd be cool being the taller twin, Ben thought to himself, and if he was, he would never let Peter live it down.
Steve playfully nudged him."That's what you get when you made me watch all the movies and read all the books with you,"
Steve asked, studying his son's face before going back to his meal, Peter wished to know what he was thinking.
"I was supposed to be in a meeting today, but then I thought I own the place, so I can ditch if I want to."
He said feeling cocky and proud of himself that he managed to dodged it, but seconds later a much bigger balloon fell on him. "That freaking boy,is the most insane, Despicable two-faced person I have ever met in my life."
Out of habit, Peter pressed his finger on the middle of his forehead as if he was pushing back his glasses.
Peter had spent the better part of the day walking in circles inside of the cabin trying to explain why
"I promise not to call" His pops but one hand on his chest the lifted his other hand, making the oath to his son."Didn't know you were quite the spider-fan, buddy"
"I'm sorry too, but it's okay, after all, I turned your cabin into a sticky spider web, I think we're even."
"Listen, carefully kiddo, you did absolutely nothing wrong, your pops is just well... How do I put this... When it comes to these kinds of things, he can be a real... Knucklehead, especially when it comes to your other dad, but that ain't your fault"
They both grab their cards and looked at them and the second Ben laid eyes on them, he didn't care about keeping His poker face.
Peter was being vague, he didn't want to reveal too much about his dad, it's not that he didn't trust Ben, he just didn't like how people treated him differently when they found out that the "S" in his name, stood for Stark.
"Your dad told me about your odd behavior even before we met, you sleeping in the closet, Spidey,Â  and all that, it didn't help when you called me Natasha, Ben never calls me that only Nat or Tasha, and despite him getting anxious in cars he can sit still for a long time" She put her arm around him."You really can't, Spidey, You bite the inside of your cheek, your dad used to do that" She whispered into his hair. "On top of that you kept rubbing your eyes, that's when I noticed the contacts and you panic when you saw doctor Banner, You took a new photo every other minute, your hair cut, I could go on for days ".
"You be surprised what we got away with." The boy responded with a grin as he remembered the prank war that had send everything into motion.
" I can't believe we pull that off without anybody noticing, is it just me or are we left unsupervised a lot?"
Peter quickly put his phone away and sat down on the edge of the second story, his aunt soon taking a seat next to him.
Luke gave Ben a sympathetic shoulder pat as the rest of the campers started mocking him, as Peter started packing up his winnings.
As they made their way to meet his aunt Natasha they had stopped for coffee or better said coffee and a box of chocolate milk. Peter looked at his drink then up at his dad"Pops, can I have a sip of your coffee?"
Ben nodded once more, he walked past his dad to his desk, where the albums were, he also noticed a double photo frame, one side had an old photo of a man who kinda looked like his dad, with a small kid that looked to be around the age of eight, they were both wearing goggles, sitting on a motorcycle, on the other side was a picture of his dad and Peter, his brother also looked to be eight in the photo, they were sitting in a go-kart, there clothing and faces were stained by motor oil but unlike the other picture their smile seemed genuine and they were looking at each other instead of the camera.
"They were married three years, then divorce, he said it was because they were are away from each other, which I don't get if they don't like being apart why did they divorce? Grown-ups are weird".
-As his pops started to paint Peter was watching closely but after a while, he started rocking back and forward on his stool asking a million question.
He picked up his comic book, to show the other boy the damage it had suffered, the book, in this case, was a graphic novel adaptation of a new hope.
Ben would normally never tell anybody about this, especially a complete stranger, but there was something about Peter that made him trust him, despite everything that had happened, so he let his guard down.
"Peter I can assure you Whatever it is it's not as big as my news" Ben sounded out of breath and panicked.
he continued to flip through the pictures but he came to a sudden halt when he noticed something. It was the picture of a woman holding a baby, she was very pretty, well dressed with blonde hair, it was weird Ben had no idea who she was, everyone else so far he recognized from the chart he and Peter made, except for her "When was this taken?"
"A lot of people think he's a jerk, and make jokes that he doesn't have a heart, but that is not true not even a little bit."
Steve held him tighter, it felt as if he thought, that Peter would suddenly turn to dust if he let go of him. "There are still things I'm not ready to tell you but..."
He was still sitting on the floor when he got out of his phone, remembering that he promised his brother that he would text him when he arrived.
Ben said as he continued to dip his spoon into his melted ice cream, but Happy was looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
"The fact that you didn't grab your bag before it was thrown into this mess" The mystery boy then gestured to the ever-growing pile
"You know? you should really enjoy moments like this because I only got like one year of cuteness left".
Peter looked down at the floor and went back to his spot. He couldn't help but think about the isolation cabin.
"I know buddy, but as I told you, I can't tell you the whole story right now but I do get why you want to know more about him".
They said at the same time as they revealed their two half of the picture. That when they were brought together, they form an image of two young men, one with dark black hair another with light blond, the two of them were lovingly staring into each other's eyes as if they were the only two people in the whole world.
"What happened to your parents, That's exactly what happened to mine, my dad told me I had another dad, and that he had to leave when I was a baby, I don't remember much about him, all I have from him are a couple of sketches he left for me and...an old photo of him."
"Well, I only have the dad, and my Pops used to be in the army, but now he's an artist, he has a studio and everything it's really cool."
Johnny looked up to see what his friend was talking about, and when he laid eyes on their cabin he froze nearly dropping Peter.
"But in the meantime, Ben, do you want to hear about the time he almost got us banned from Coney Island because of his weak stomach?"
He left the fort and headed for the third room and came back shortly with an old-looking notebook and sat down next to him.
Ben asked, as he grabbed a spoon full of peanut butter, and spread it out on top of an Oreo before taking a bite of it.
On a red light, his dad turned to him with a curious smile on his face. "Well, it sounds like you had fun". He reached out to ruffle his son's short hair.
"Fine, you are no fun".Bucky sat down who he thought to be Ben and ruffled his hair with two hands, one of them being a robotic prosthetic that kinda reminded Peter of Dummy.
"Eww," he said while laughing as he read that last text, he put the phone aside and closed his eyes for a second.
"Get a good look at it, Benny, because this might be one of the last times you see our little studio"
He had never been to a batting cage but it looked intriguing. It was outside and kids were running away, the sounds of their laughter over the sound of the baseball hitting the metal and wooden bats, The cages were outdoors filled with families. Peter was a little nervous never had done this and there was a reason why he was never picked first in gym class.
"A lot of things, we were separated for a while, your dad was in the army, did I ever tell you that? and while he was a lot of bad stuff happened"
Somehow three little boys had managed to put their bunk beds and luggage on the roof. Including placing Peter's black spider plushie on the flagpole.
He whispered into Tony's ears, it always amazed how saying those three words to the other man felt like the easiest in the world and how his heart was filled with joy every time he uttered them.
Steve had kneeled down the instant he saw his child running towards him, he was waiting for him with open arms and when he was close enough he pulled him into his arms for a loving, long-awaited hug.
The rest of the evening felt a bit awkward, and Peter didn't really leave his uncle's side, as he built up the courage to continue with the mission. But The time came where his lifeline had to leave.
"It was Fun! at first, I wasn't sure if I would like it but in the end, I'm super happy I went". interestingly enough with his aunt, he didn't feel too nervous, like he did with his Pop's and uncle, in the beginning, it was easy to talk to her maybe because just like his uncle Sam, he knew that adults he trusted, trusted her so there was no reason to be shy plus her aunt had this energy about her that made it easy to let your walls down.
Wait did Ben really stare at random strangers for a really long time and make up stories about them? his twin was so wired.
"Also, when my dad is working on his drawings, I like to sit next to him, you should definitely do that, but be beware of the dad jokes...there are so many."
Just by looking at his pop's face, he could tell he was not expecting that."Um...I'm not sure...maybe bigfoot? but then again Mothman can fly, so it could be a tie"
"Also, if you don't get that much information from my Pops, you can always ask Bucky, they've known each other since they were our age, if anybody else knows what happened, it's him."
"If you say so, it was just one line and it was something like for the man who has everything or something like that, I don't remember the exact words but the note saidÂ  T.Stone"
"No, I have not forgotten that".Steve reassured him." After breakfast will head to the studio" He looked down at his food and took a long deep breath before looking back at Peter "And I will finish the story on how we met, that is if you're not too tired"
Miles asked, he was one of the other boys sharing the cabin with them, he was the youngest but still became quick friends with everybody, he also wasn't there to witness the duel between Peter and Ben.
Suddenly the atmosphere in the room changed Bucky's eyes widen not knowing what to say while Steve almost choked on his drink.
He panicked but was still determined to get it out. He doubled down and began to pull as hard as he could, but all his efforts ended with him falling on his butt, and to add insult to injury, yet another bag was thrown in, talk about being kicked when he was down.
Peter looked around trying to figure out which one of the buildings his pop's studio was located in, after all, Ben never talked about it but there was one thing he did notice.
Years later, and I still regret not making this an omegaverse, it would have saved so much trouble, but it's too late for that.
Peter didn't hold back as he told her entire story, from the fencing duel to them finally meeting their other parents
" it's such a cool name, did you just come up with just now, are really you're really going to help us?"
Peter stopped dead on his track when he saw three other doors in front of him, he looked between trying to remember the makeshift blueprints that Ben showed telling him which room was what. He reached for the middle and gave himself a mental high five when he saw he got it right.
"You sound so serious, but yeah apparently Howard introduce them. A few months later they got married, how about you?"
"Well I'm surprised that gum was the only food-related incident you had, considering all the snacks you took. I was worried that you made your cabin into a bear magnet."
"I do want to meet dad..." he looked up at Peter with a smile on his face and a determined look in his eyes
"Regular tired or car tired?" He took a minute to answer, as he rubbed the back of his neck."The second one I guess?"
"See, you know me kid, I'm more familiar with middle earth than this, but from you tell me, I think I'm the other way around."
"But still, the time difference can be a pain, the few first days of camp, I collapsed the second I saw my bed and it happened again yesterday, I took a long nap when I got here". He laid down on the tub.
"Um, that's okay I think they won't be coming back after last night, I made sure of it but I promise no more sleeping in the closet"
Peter said to his twin, which made Ben laughed in response, as he took Peter's camera into his hand.
Ben gave him a small glare that indicated he didn't care who started it, he just cared who ended it, he turned his back to the other kids in hopes that he would get the attention away from Peter.
Taking advantage that his opponent was distracted Peter went in and poked the other kid in the chest. The counselor then grabbed his hand, as he blew on his whistle, lifted his arm, proclaiming him The Undefeated champion, the light-haired chaperone asked for another volunteer but nobody stepped forward.
"Then cutting your hair was a complete waste of time, because it's not like I can go to summer camp with perfect eyesight then coming back needing glasses also having magically found a pair that is suited for my eyesight, is not very believable!".
He started exploring and watching other kids arrive, trying to figure out who had been here before and who was new, even making a game out of it in his head. But he got a little too invested in it. Almost missing how the staff members were taking luggage from the bus over to a giant pile in the middle of the campsite, once he noticed, he quickly ran towards it. Luckily, his big yellow duffle bag was easy to spot.
"Well, that's why one day I'm going to be referring to uncle Bucky as my first husband! He yelled that last part so Bucky could hear it clearly, which caused his godfather to laugh even louder. He kneeled down to meet Peter's eye level and gave him the biggest, brightest smile in the world, his uncle Sam radiated this kindness to him, that made him reciprocated that same gesture, he could see why his uncle would marry him and why his pops would consider him one of his best friends.
"Well for starters, I have two uncles and an aunt but they're not biologically related to my dad, in fact, I'm not related to anybody in my family."
"Grate".Steve picked up Peter and placed him on his shoulders. As they both said goodbye to them and continued on their way.
the three boys laugh and give each other a hug before, saying goodbye. Luke and Danny were on the first bus to new york while Peter would be on the second one.
Ben looked up at Jarvis, he looked and sounded annoyed while he said that last part, he glanced over at his dad, who looked like a kid who was seconds away from being grounded
You know if these boys to take a second to sit down and talk to each other they would have avoided this whole mess, huh I wonder where they get that from?
Johnny sat up and switch positions now sitting on the bed with his legs hanging on the edge."Are you sure your dad didn't clone you or something?"
He was nervous, and when he was nervous he would normally ramble off until his throat went sore, but right now he was silent, which couldn't be a good sign.
He offered, as he opened the wooden trunk, that was on the feet of his bed and pulled out a packet of Oreos.
Peter shrugged as he put a generous amount of syrup on his pancakes but didn't drown them as his pops asked.
That night the boys skipped dinner by faking a stomach ache. They put pillows under the blankets and broke into the kitchen and the arts and craft closet to get supplies for their master plan.
When Steve got home there was a calm before the storm, Peter had cried himself to sleep, which gave him time to disinfect all of the baby bottles, and got the second crib set up, so Peter wouldn't catch what Ben had. After he was done, setting everything up including calling Tony.
Ben was sitting next to the window, drawing random things on it using the fog, while Peter was sitting in his side of the cabin, reading on his desk one of the comics he had brought with him.
"Okay, everything's okay you know everything you need to know, he's your pops, he's going to like you no matter what...he likes you...you can do this."
Ben stood there, still flabbergasted. He made his way to Luke and Danny, who were the only ones left from the crowd that was witnessing the fencing duel. When he approached them, he was quiet for a bit, he looked at them and said in a soft voice.
" Now, I'm sure that there is a wonderful story behind it but I'm going to need you to tell me the nutshell version of it because I don't know how long your Uncle Buck is going to be able to distract your dad"
"We?" Ben perked up when he heard that but noticed that this time his dad was the one who had stayed silent. Despite that, he decided to push his luck before his dad had a chance to change the subject."...do you mean you and my pop's?"
Peter was rubbing his eyes almost the whole way there not being used to having his contact lenses, he was also reviewing the notes that Ben has given, him trying to memorize every detail. He couldn't decide whether the bus ride was taking too long or if it was going too fast.
"Now, you listen carefully, my dad cannot cook, I'm serious, if he offers to cook for you say no, he's just trying to be nice, but I repeat, do not let him cook, trust me I am doing you a favor... oh, and nicknames, he loves giving nicknames."
"Although if that was true the three of you could make a really cool Huey, Dewey, and Louie Halloween costume".
"If you tried it you wouldn't say that, I used to think it was super gross too but then my p-friend convince me." He corrected himself and ate his milkshake fry.
Peter started walking towards the other boy while Ben was trying to keep calm by telling himself that this can't be happening, yes, Peter was identical to him, yes, the stories were very similar but he didn't want to believe it, That his dad lied to him all of his life.
"That's a hard question to answer but I can tell you this, it wasn't because he didn't love you,you were his world you b-really where, trust me that day we both made the hardest decision of our lives, but a lot of different things happened and we thought it be better if we split up, Unfortunately, you got caught in the middle of all of this, and I'm sorry for that".
"Ben, would you mind helping me? I don't want to revisit the ground," he asked, rubbing the back of his neck.
Johnny pointed out, he was spread out on his top bunk with his lower body on the bed and his top half hanging from it.
Here the thing I accidentally deleted this chapter but at the bright side I could edit  and make less you know god awful and it adds more information about the boy's family three and how they were adopted  but I do plan on going into that in future chapters,  yes there is going to be new chapters I promise I'm just  turtle when it comes to this things,
"No, there was this blond lady, I think she was a nurse, but she didn't stick around either. But the reason I asked, was that I know that the mission is to confront our parents and figure out what happened, but what if we add, getting them back together to the list? Think about it, It's been over 10 years and they haven't married someone else, there has to be a reason for that."
"Even if it's about your pops" is dad hugged him tightly." Is that why you been quiet all day, you wanted to ask about him?".
Peter said with an excited tone holding his camera close to him, his dad always joked that despite having the option of choosing any camera he wanted, he chose the one that was older than him,
It was only after he sent those messages did he noticed the time, Peter was three hours ahead, he was probably having dinner right now, and with Pop's strict no-phone rule, would make it impossible for him to pick up. He felt so alone. He just laid in the bed watching the hours go by, at one point Jarvis knocked and asked if he needed anything. Ben only responded with a no thank you. it was still relatively early and he didn't want to be left alone with all these thoughts and feelings, that he couldn't even process, he got up and started walking around. After a while, he started thinking that this maybe wasn't his best idea, because he ended up getting lost.
"You have a point" Ben looked around the room, right now he happened to be sitting in the bathtub of Peter's bathroom for that very reason.
"I hope not...or maybe a little? we did goof around a lot and even played pranks on each other, a little less after we started dating, but we were never like in the movies we could spend an entire day just talking or even not talking, we didn't shout how much we were in love every five seconds but we had other ways of showing how much we cared"
and with that Peter ran off he said goodbye to the counselor and boarded the bus , as he took his seat , he did the math in his head, the camp was located in Washington , which meant that it would take the bus about 4 hours and 30 minutes, not counting stops to use the restrooms to reach Brooklyn, and counting the three hour time difference that means he would get there at 3 a.m., and that's where his pops would be greeting him.
It had been a rough morning, first the closet, followed by the spidey incident, but at very least his pops didn't know he had been on the phone with Ben all night, or at least late until he passed out on the phone. But the fun didn't stop there, shortly after they ate, he had a little incident including his glasses. He had thought that him not wearing his contacts during breakfast and putting them on later would be no issue, oh, but depth perception was not his friend, he ended up tripping over the furniture when his pops decided to move a chair by an inch, he also missed the bathroom door and ended up slamming into the wall .
"Or maybe it's like a prince and the pauper situation, where he's just someone who looks exactly like you, what? don't give me that face I like Disney"
"He kicked me out for being too annoying, so I decided to come over and bother you instead," He said finally letting go of the boy.
Miles said as he gave Peter a goodbye hug. The two boys had spent the rest of the camp hangin out with the friends they made, after a long explanation, and apology ,and going over their plan every chance they got.
"Thanks, Kid" Luckily Bruce wasn't looking straight at him he was still busy getting everything from the floor.
"Uncle Bucky!" He greeted him with a smile, but notice how he had the same look his pops had before running off, his gaze was even glued the same direction he went too, Peter was about to turn around to see what was going on when he suddenly heard his pop's voice yell.
Parents always try to do the best for their children but more often than not they would make mistakes.
"It's a little sweeter than butÂ  I'm used too but I think I prefer it like this, also you can tell it was just made by the smell and I really, really like that".
These boys are a bit over there heads but Peter is determined to find out more about his pops and continue the mission but a long day of surprises may make that difficult.
At first, Peter found himself glued to Steve's side, and just like in the car, only responding with two or three-word answers to all of Bucky's questions, but as the day went on something interesting happened. He found himself connecting more with his uncle than his pops.
Ben could make up an entire backstory for a stranger in the street, but when it came to his dad he couldn't figure anything out. His mind just landed on blanks, when he thought of him, he was always his other dad, his other dad who played piano, his other dad who had to leave, and who he desperately wanted to meet. And now that he was here, it was more like meeting an important celebrity instead of meeting his father. Peter had warned him about his dad's icy exterior, but assured him that it wasn't real. So Ben just had to get to know him better, but he wasn't sure where to start.
Peter's smile faded when Ben asked that, no matter how hard he tried, that memory would always stick with him. It was his birthday, and dad was taking too long to come to say goodnight, so he decided to get up and look for him. When he found him he was sitting on the piano, he never really played it or looked at it, and tonight was no exception. There was no music, just his dad looking at the keys, with the most heartbreaking look in his eyes. His dad had told him that he was fine, but even at a young age, Peter knew he was lying.
That morning, when Ben woke to the sight of multicolored string hanging from the bunk beds, and ceilings that resembled a spider web, he went back to sleep, thinking that he was still dreaming but it didn't take long for reality to sink in. He sat up from his bed, which made five rubber black spiders fall on his head. He screamed from the top of his lungs, which had the result of waking up the rest of the boys in the cabin.
"So dad and Pepper, huh? Are you sure this wasn't your plan to spend some time with me before I left? "
"Aww, it's nice to see such a loving dad".Â  A random woman spoke as she watched them, Peter noticed how she was looking at his pop's hand. "Single dad?".
"I know how to play, I'm pretty good at it, and judging by that giant pile next to you, I'm guessing you're good at it too."
"No, but then again I don't trust anyone, for example, are you really my mom or did Haward build you in a lab?"
Ben turned to his dad. Much like the city themselves, his pops and dad seemed like day and night. He tried picturing them together as the much bigger adults they were now, instead of the version of the teared-up picture. But as hard as he tried, everything his mind came up with was ridiculous. Like his pops in a limo or his dad going grocery shopping, it seemed almost funny. His eyes lingered on his dad for a bit more before giving up and going back to the window.
Ben looked up, it was true he was only playing with the already melted ice cream, he didn't really ask for it, Happy just gave it to him because that's what Peter would have wanted, he tried to eat some, as not to seem rude but he was too anxious to eat, let alone talk.
Ben nodded his head as he processed this new information."Okay, okay, new plan, all the counselors are going to be at the staff meeting today after breakfast, right?"
"Couldn't have said it better myself Benny, also are you okay?". Peter asked worried for his brother remembering the strings of texts he had gotten the other day.
Ben looked down at the ground trying not to give away how sad he really felt, he didn't even notice when the car door opened.
He could still feel that weird anger and sadness building up inside, especially as they looked through the photos but didn't feel like talking, he wasn't sure what he wanted but he just ignored it and kept going.
"It's not that crazy, okay, because if you think about it the probabilities of two people looking alike are high, I mean there are only so many faces in the world, some people are bound to look alike".
Peter tilted his head, confused by the question. He was in the middle of opening the jar, so he had to put it aside, he licked the peanut butter off his fingertips then cleaned his hand on his shirt, so he wouldn't get the picture dirty.
She crossed her arms and smiled at him." I'm going, to be honest with you, kid, you never stood a chance".
He said with confidence, the way he saw it just because this was humiliating, it didn't mean he couldn't do this without dignity.
" Ben, that story you told me, that's my story, I was adopted, I even had an aunt who loved me more than the universe!" he put his hand on his head and took a deep breath
" No, wait."Peter singled to Johnny and Miles, to stay hidden as he ran to stopped her from going in which earned him a look from the counselor.
As the busses arrived at the campsite, Ben was the first one out, practically leaping out, eager to join his peers and stretch his legs, something much-needed, after the long bus drive. He hated sitting still in a car for that long, but it was worth it. Ecstatic to be out of New York. While he loved his home, leaving it behind was something he rarely got to do, and on top of that, it was the first time he got to travel alone. Ben felt like he was starting an adventure. It reminded him of the biannually camping trips he and his pops took. The first one at the start of summer, then again, right before school started, although, they only left Brooklyn for those, regardless, it was one of his favorite traditions. However, this year, things were different. Recently, his Pops, or better said his pop's work, had become more popular, and by default, more in demand, therefore busier. And in between finishing his new pieces, getting ready for his upcoming gallery, and finding a better studio. His pop's plate was full. In short, no beginning of summer camping trip. While sad to see it go, things weren't all bad. His pops had managed to find this place last minute, something he was incredibly grateful for, and he still had the august trip to look forward to.
Ben responded playfully, still on the ground, and despite his embarrassment, he returned the smile. Gladly taking the other boy's offer to help him up.
Two young  men swore internal love to each other in a improvised wedding and  and even though their love was pure and true in there  wedding vows they made promise to each other that they did not know they wouldn't  be able to keep
"Dad...What?..nevermind?".Ben knew that he had to go through with the mission, he just didn't want all he was feeling to explode out of him like a volcano.
Peter said in an awkward voice before taking Johnny's hand, who was still shocked and ran in the opposite direction as fast as he could.
Peter stopped to give Johnny a quick look before waving his hands in front of the two. "Okay, first of all, my dad wouldn't clone me...okay he wouldn't clone me and not tell me about it."
"Here, just take my hand and if you still feel nervous you can just squeeze it, how does that sound ?"
He thought to himself. Everything was close, Far and blurry all at the same time that's when he realized one of his contacts must had fallen out.
He laughed at the reference. And got up from his spot, that's when he noticed a picture on the ground, they must have missed. He picked it up getting a good look at it, before giving it back. In the picture, a younger version of Peter was on a beach, alongside a woman, she had long ginger-hair and was wearing a huge pair of sunglasses, the woman was smiling, her focus was on Peter instead of the camera, next to her was a heavier man, with raven hair, who had his hand around the woman's waist and a big smile on his face.
He quickly took a bite of his own food of his burger. He heard the bell attached to the bell ring he turned around and noticed Bruce was leaving, he let out a sigh of relief thinking that the hardest part of the day was over.
"Not betting my glasses, but how about this, whoever loses has to jump into the lake later tonight?"
Steve seemed to be processing the information with a blank stare that only made Peter even more nervous than he already was.
"Not in the slightest, it kinda just happened, your dad had this habit of just doing what he wanted and most times it had interesting results".
"That's good to hear little bro, told you, dad is awesome " He yawned "In between the sentence." I think we can move to the second part of the mission we.." His voice became softer and sounded drowsy ."We... just need to focus".
It didn't take much for Ben to finally go to sleep, he wasn't sure if he made it to the end of the lullaby or not, all he knew was that he went to sleep with a smile on his face, knowing that that image of the four of them reunited as a family wasn't too far.
"We should keep it down, we wouldn't want to wake them up." She walked over to the TV with the intent of turning it off.
After a long discussion, whether they should inform a counselor about this or not and a series of pulley systems they finally managed to get everything down from the roof and into the cabin.
In short, he felt completely miserable. But he didn't say anything, he wasn't going to let itchy eyes and the fact that he was sleepy ruin his day with his pops and aunt.
"I..missed you too." Peter got a good look at his godfather, he had long hair that was tied up in a ponytail, stubble on his chin and if it wasn't for the incredibly warm smile and carrying eyes, he had the look of someone you would actually hire to actually kidnap and kill someone.
By the time they sat down to eat, he was now glued to Bucky's side talking about the first thing that would come into his head, as Bucky nodded and joined in when he actually knew what he was talking about.
"Come on", his pops cave in and closed the door to the apartment. They walked down the stairs and out of the building, as they approached the park Peter decided to pick up the conversation of the other night
After that. Both Peter and Ben confessed. But they didn't rat out any of their friends. They were forced to clean the cabin, and the next day they were escorted by the Camp's director and Maria, to a small cabin, it was isolated but it wasn't too far that it would be a safety hazard. Even though it was smaller, it had much more room seeing that the only piece of furniture were two twin beds, two desks on each side of the room, and curtains that were hanging on the windows. "Now, the two of you are going to be spending the next week in this cabin, learning how to act civilized, you will be checked on daily, and you will also have a separate table in the mess hall. And if we don't see improvements in your behavior, then we're going to call your parents, and the two of you will get sent home early. Do you boys understand?" The director said in a Stern voice
She said imitating the tone of voice Ben used while tilting her head and pointing at the young men with a bright smile on her face. She gently placed and on Ben's cheek.
but neither Peter nor Ben couldn't bring themselves to care about the whispering going on behind them, they were still locked in eye contact. Peter lifted his hand, and so did Ben, giving a wave to each other. It was like looking in the mirror, with very few minor differences. The first one being their outfits Peter was wearing a white suit with a green chest while Ben's was all white, Peter's hair was long and floppy, and Ben had short hair, almost a buzz cut, and finally, Peter's cheeks were slightly chubbier than Ben's, but not by much.
Steve had never been able to figure out why Phillips had changed his mind. The General had listened to his impassioned plea that day in the tent - about wanting to serve his country even though he'd never really been allowed to feel a part of it, and about needing to help others -Â  and he hadn't sent Steve home.
He maneuvered his bike around a thick crowd of people who were attempting to tear down a storefront, his eyes straining over their heads for a glimpse of the Behringer Music Hall where Tony and the children were meant to be practicing with Nigel. People swarmed around him like irritated hornets, knocking into his bike, grabbing onto him as he slowed down to keep from trampling them.
Tonyâs room was on the same floor as the room that Pepper used when she chose to stay the night. They shared the floor with the family. An odd choice, but Tony couldnât complain. It did make spying ever so much easier.
In which everyone just tries to survive. Except Bucky. He doesn't try that hard, but that's because he's got priorities.
A terrified sniffle drew his attention to the others. Natacha had her arms around Maria and Sara who had frightened tears on their faces, moving her body to block their view of the man being beaten; but nothing could block out the sounds.
"As wonderful as the Ardagger Priory is they are in fact not serving food at this hour and even if they were, I'm not in need of it." Tony wrenched the door back, perhaps harder than he had meant too. Beetle eyes glared, the butler's face turning a very unbecoming shade of violet.
âHow is James?â he asked, in order to distract her as Ian hopped down from the sled and hastily began unpacking their new supplies.
Ian slid off the sofa, looking for Tony in the spinning room. In a moment Tony would touch his shoulder and maybe smile at him.
âYouâd know, if the captain would allow you to return to school. A tutor is all well and good for a child, but for a young man itâs practically shameful.â
Tony felt his mouth tugging into a smile despite the uncomfortable mix of shock and anxiety still coursing through his veins.
Her words made no sense, so Steve ignored them, continuing to pull and strain in an attemptÂ to tearÂ at the bindingsÂ around hisÂ arms,Â wrenching hisÂ wrists and shoulders. The pain was excruciating, his body screaming warnings in a language his mind couldnât heed likeÂ an over plucked piano string.
It was a spacious garage neatly filled with various pieces of equipment: bicycles, what looked like parts to a boiler, an old clock that had apparently ticked its last. An unused automobile sat in the middle of the garage, gleaming black and beautiful and practically singing to him. Tony had looked around the garage at all the helpless equipment just waiting for tender hands such as his to soothe where they ailed and had, for the first time since laying hands on the captain's piano, felt a weight easing from him.
âVery.â Tony answered tightly. Vonkov had taken up teaching as a young man as a means of supporting himself. Heâd been snobbish and judgmental, Tony remembered, and not at all thrilled with having Tony as a pupil. Heâd not left his position on good terms, but it was more than Tony wanted to explain.
He folded his hands behind his back and planted his legs, looking down at her small form. She blinked up at him, her hands tightening into fists as they crumpled the hem of her skirt. She was clearly terrified of him and yet there she stood, barring his way like a tree planted firmly in the soil.
They held each other's gazes for a long moment - until Bucky thought he might shout into the silence just to break the spell - and then Stark looked away, almost shy, his eyes skating over Maria and Tacha.
The bottom fell out of Tonyâs stomach. Just like that? Booted out with just the clothes on their backs? No food, no money, no travel papers, and two sons left behind them?
Something nudged his leg and then he heard an anxious bleat. Steve had left the gate on the pen open he realized as he looked down intoÂ PatrocheâsÂ large black eyes. They were trained up on Steve as if he were waiting.
Natacha had buried her head into her knees, shaking it slowly. Tony had thought that the firelight looked pretty dancing against her red hair and mused with a heartache he kept all to himself thatÂ StefenÂ would have thought the moment worthy of a painting. Natacha, sitting with her knees curled up,Â PÃ©terÂ with his arm slung around her. Angular bodies caught in tandem in that vast valley between child and adult, finding their own kind of poetic symmetry together not explained by anything rational.
âItâs about damage control now. They have to send a clear message. A warning to others. But they have to step carefully,â he thought out loud. Beside him Pepper took a shaky breath.
âPlease. My children.â He forced the words out, wincing at how mangled and desperate they sounded. He did not like to beg, but heâd beg for them. Heâd do anything for them.
Bakhuizen was going because he was providing a band and a singer but there was no reason for Tony to expect to be attending, so early that evening after baths had been had and freshly ironed clothing was donned, when Maria asked him if heâd be going he had no reason to expect that the answer should be anything but ânot this time patatina, but Iâll be waiting up to hear all about it.â
âIt looks like there isnât, but we should get it for him anyway.â Tony answered distractedly, wondering if that magazine wasnât the famed Captain Adventure Bethany had talked about. âChildren need challenge captain. Heâll grow into the material.â
Grinning Bucky turned and knelt down to fetch his violin from its case beside his chair, happy that heâd thought to bring it to the lesson.
Tony murmured, his hands stroking gently at Stefenâs back. Stefen tightened his grip around his daughterâs waist in silent agreement.
If he was to be carted away by the police in a few hours he could think of few better ways to spend his last free moments than in scientific discovery with another sharp mind.
PÃ©ter had spent so many days cooped up in the house since heâd returned from his misadventure that Tony expected him to jump at the chance to spend a night or two at Harryâs. Truthfully, he didnât expect to see the boy again until Christmas demanded it, but he was surprised to find PÃ©ter sitting alone in the kitchen the very next morning, just a few hours past breakfast.
Tony managed to jostle Buckyâs back enough that he overshot the punch. He tried to turn on Stark, but then Stefen was there, grabbing him and the two grappled for a moment. Somehow or another Stefen managed to snag him by his shirt collar with enough wrenching force to catch him by surprise. Bucky found himself being hauled out into the hallway and then his back was hitting the opposite wall with a slam.
Natacha turned her face to hide her grin. Charlotte would never be her mother, but sometimes she was glad to have her as an ally.
"Don't bother sparing me. Just know that I don't want my burdens for you. I want you to be a child as long as you need to be, and when you're ready to find a woman who makes you happy and have children of your own. I want you to keep up with your experiments and your inventions and reach those stars you're always studying. But the Reich isn't going to let you. If they can, they'll kill you. Kill all of us.â
âAfter all this is done, we should vacation to the Swiss villa.â She reached across the table and to his hand folding her delicate fingers with his. He grasped back, careful not to hold on to tight. âI feel like I never see you Stefen, and the children would love the countryside. Itâll be good for us. Once the Reich are done with us.â
"Good." Relieved, Bucky threw an arm around his neck and pulled him close, a grateful smile tugging at his lips as he let their foreheads knock gently together.
Instead of crying like Sara (who had shrieked and climbed up Tony's body, practically perching on his head to avoid being submerged) Maria had wrinkled her little nose and jumped into the water full throttle, as if sheâd decided the best way to tackle her fear was to literally tackle it. To Mariaâs own surprise (not to mention Tonyâs) once in it she
He needed to use steel to reinforce the body of the boat so it would be able to support the weight of the engine. Metal in the body also meant more protection from bullets. But it was going to be too heavy, so heâd found a way to lighten it with an iron alloy.
âSheâs not so much a girl anymore Herr Stark.â The baroness confided in a mischievous whisper. âThe world rushes us from child to woman, and rarely leaves any time between for getting to know ourselves.â
"This is the last street," PÃ©ter announced with some relief as they reached the end of their route. It was a short little avenue with a couple of restaurants and a flower shop. A car honked somewhere up the road and they both jumped, Rogue's hand clutching his arm momentarily before the return of silence on the street. PÃ©ter slumped with relief when there was no further noise and no sound of an approaching car and Rogue giggled breathlessly.
âThese, Herr Stark, are my children. This, children, is your new tutor, Antony Stark.â He gestured gingerly at Tony. Tonyâs eyes tracked the movement. âThe children have a signal to call for them, as do the servants.â
It was a big risk traveling directly to Dachau from the Berghof, but Steve had no choice but to take it and try to mitigate the risks as much as possible by sticking to cabs until he could meet Scott in Munich.
âAre you sure Tony?âÂ PÃ©terÂ asked, sounding equally uncertain of poking the beast. It made Tony pause, his eyes flicking toward the younger children.
Bucky wrapped his fingers around the gun and yanked it free of blankets and hay and brought it up to take aim at the guy with the radio. The familiar sound of rapid fire exploded in his ears as his target jerked, a crater appearing in the side of his face before he toppled backward without so much as getting a shout out. Then it was pandemonium as the other men in the car shouted alarms and reached for their guns. Too late, because Bucky didnât hesitate as he advanced on the vehicle carefully aiming through the windshield at the panicking driver.
There was some time still before it would be ready but the children seemed happy enough snacking on the raw vegetables and fruits that Willamina had packed for them, and Stefen had surprised them all by cracking open the tin of small cakes Artur had been eyeing despite the fact that it would spoil their supper. Tony suspected that it had something to do with Maria's watery eyes and pouting lips, but far be it for him to suggest that Captain Rogers could succumb to the wiles of a girl no older than five.
They continued on but Steve let their voices fade. His mind, although fractured, obsessing over Schmidts rage. Something must have happened. Something severe enough to... to be afraid. What had he said?
He looked out the window, watching the street lamp lights and the way it made the rain slick stones on the building gleam like they were made of something else entirely. It reminded him of one of the books heâd sent Ian. A book about a kingdom in a lake.
Tony leaned his head back to blink slowly up at him. His nimble fingers had worked their way into Steveâs hair and were now holding his head steady. His eyes looked deeply into Steveâs, diving through the depths in search of what lay hidden inside, and a glimmer of that quicksilver smile appeared. Steve hadnât known how much he needed to see it again until it was being given to him.
If the thought of PÃ©ter putting himself in danger werenât so utterly horrifying Steve would have laughed. No, none of their motherâs or anyone elseâs please had stopped him and Bucky from doing what theyâd felt they had to do. Tony was right, as was so often the case, but for once Steve couldnât muster up any ire about it. He found himself promising Tony that heâd think about it and the smile Tony rewarded him with was so brilliant that Steve knew there was no going back. He would have to find a way to handle Schmidt.
"The day before the soldiers came to take Father away â Mama woke me early and took me out to the trees behind our cabin and made me show her that I still remembered what sheâd taught us. She told me sheâd dreamed Pietro and I were lost and needed to find home. She told me that for the Rom all children belong to the people, and that the first man I said those words to would welcome me into his family. But Pietro and I aren't going back to the familia."
Buckyâs eyebrows crawled up his face. Might be? Ha. How many blue-eyed escapees over six feet tall were roaming through the area anyway?
âWe need to rotate the guard.â Steve snapped in a tone he knew none of them would argue with, effectively closing the conversation. Heâd had had enough. If he listened to any more of that heâd have to account for more than the death of the FÃ¼hrer.
Peppers hands flew to her mouth in shock and Harold wrapped a consoling arm around her, face gone a bit pale. Next to Tony Willamina took a sharp breath.
There had been a crowd of protesters waiting at the harbor that day. The family car hadnât even made it into the shipyard. Shouts had rang out as the mob had pressed in close, pounding on the windows and hood of their motor car with fury, and then shots. In a split second Tonyâs entire world had upended. There had been a spray of blood, and his mother had screamed so loudly next to his ear that heâd thought it might rupture.
Of course afterwards, all the children could talk about was the puppets they were building back home and the prospect of putting on a show of their own. Steve had never smiled so much.
âQuite right. When the dragon was as big as the house itself it said to the boy âYou took mercy on me. You saved me and fed me when I was smaller and weaker than even you; but I am big now, and I must go home.â But the boy was sad to lose his friend, and did not know where the dragonâs home was to take him there. âClimb on my back and Iâll fly you over thereâ the dragon said.
LuzzatoÂ must have convinced the rabbi they werenât spies because they were led inside and down a long hall along the sanctuary, towards the offices in the back of the building. Several of them had been cleared of furniture and lined with pallets to create temporary bed stays.
Tony could see the wheels turning in the boyâs mind as he considered his words. After a moment PÃ©ter nodded, the gleam of excitement returning to his eyes as he slapped his hands against his thighs enthusiastically.
They lay there what could have been hours, letting the world come back to rights, Tony waiting for Stefen to come back to himself. He did not mind. Heâd have laid there three times longer if need be.
The table was too still and too full of glum faces. Artur was not chattering the way he usually did. Ian was staring listlessly into his bowl of oats while James leaned against his side; neither boy seeming to notice nor to care about their close proximity. Natacha was silently trying to spoon the hot oats into Sara's mouth, but the little girl kept shaking her head stubbornly until her sister gave up - no energy to fight. Maria sat beside her silent and glassy eyed, holding her spoon but not making any effort at eating. Tony's heart twisted painfully in his chest, taking in their state.
Her eyes flew wildly to his, wondering how heâd known what sheâd been thinking. Of course she forgave him. He hadnât wanted them to live in shame. It had been the only practical decision to make. So why did it hurt? She didnât know but she also knew it couldnât be allowed to matter.
âAnd do you like to sing Maria?â Frauline Van Dyne asked and the girl nodded eagerly.Â  She opened her mouth to say something but fell silent as a shadow fell over her.
âFuck off. And donât call me Jaime.â Bucky reminded him for what felt like the hundredth time. Kirk just grinned at him like a professional shit eater; baby blues twinkling in the amber light as he tapped blunt fingers against the table impatiently. Since the fucker had called him Jaime Bucky was content to make him wait as he got out a cigarette and lit up.
He rounded the corner to his room. The house was new and the way it talked always soothed him. His father had always said you could tell a great deal about a house and its builder by the way it talked. Its creaks and moans and shudders.
âYou donât care about me!â James accused, crumbling into desperate sobs. He looked so small and pathetic sitting there in the snow with his bruises and his broken heart. Tony felt sorry for him, almost enough to forget why heâd tossed him there in the first place.
âA boy and a girl. Twins. My nephew, has a mouse and his sister has the family cat. He likes to play a game with the mouse- little Hans he calls it. Heâll set the family cat out and let little Hans try to out run him.â
The lantern lit streets casting light against the cobblestones, the stars above, the bubbling fountain at their backs, the happy chatter of the children only interrupted by the eager sound of wet slurping, the sweet cold slide of ice-cream on his tongue, the spice of cologne in his nose as Stefen leaned across him to wipe Arturâs sticky face.
Steve read the letter again, chuckling quietly as he reached the part where Stark allowed that it couldnât be an hundred percent accurate equation as he would have had to get much closer to her for better data, and with the amount of hostility she was exhibiting he'd deemed it unsafe.
"A little house in Geneva. I think I quite like the sound of that." And then she giggled, her whole face lighting up, the sadness clearing from her expression. It did nothing to calm him, his nerves spiking. Steve frowned slightly. He couldnât presume to know her mind but he knew he wouldnât be smiling over contracting himself in marriage of convenience, after so lackluster a courtship.
The light from Tony's lamp cast a dim glow over the mountains of covered furniture and Tony's gaze first went to the dark shape of the transmitter radio covered in white sheet (still safe where he'd left it) but then it was drawn to the cast iron bed that had been pushed against the wall under the window where a small shape was currently huddled in its center, clutching knees to her chest and rocking herself back and forth.
Was he buried?Â  Under, under... No, he was cold but there were walls. He was in a room, but the room was rocking. He was on a ship? He hadnât been on a ship since the war. Where was the enemy? Had he fallen asleep in the snow? He had to get up, before he froze. Before it buried him alive.Â  No, no, no. He had to get up.
With a start James realized that he no longer knew what day it was. He had stopped counting when he got sick, and when he started to get better, he hadnât remembered to start up again. Tony had suggested building the sled when he was well enough,Â andÂ James hadÂ been so excited to get out of bed again he hadnât thought about it.
"We don't want to be found!" Artur insisted. His cheeks had grown red, and his eyes welled with frustrated tears. "Go away, or I... I'll hit you with this."
She said soldier like the word was dirty and Natacha wondered at the difference between it and the German officers she spoke so highly of.
Heâd been expelled for misconduct but at that point they had just been looking for reasons to be rid of him. As usual, Tony had been leagues ahead of peers and teachers alike and met with near instant dislike for that very fact. Forced with prejudice at times to go at the snailâs pace of his peers heâd been a very bored and often times belligerent student.
"Satisfied?" He couldn't help grumbling and Natacha nodded primly, the ghost of a smile tugging at her lips.
Finished, Bucky slid down the rest of the incline, his boots crunching in the snow as he approached the majorâs fallen form, only to see that Henrick had already gone still, his eyes staring lifelessly upward at the clearÂ sky peeking through the canopy.
âWe should touch down by nightfall.â Steve parroted what Carol had told them earlier. He left out that was if they didnât run into enemy fighters along the way and attain damage or worse.
Natacha sent him a sharp look and PÃ©ter resisted the urge to roll his eyes, his stomach already sinking into the ground.
He shoved the curtains aside and slid open the windows leaning out into the downpour just enough grasp the swinging shutters and pulled them closed. He did the same to the second window on the other side of the room, noting the poor condition of the lock. An easy fix with the right tools, but for nowâ¦ Tony made do with a roll of twine fetched from his drawer. Shutters closed and the storm muted once more Tony returned to his task.
âI know youâre old enough to understand whatâs coming. I know you know that in war there are no guarantees.â He said, his voice hard but not distant, commanding but passionate enough to border on harsh. She didnât flinch but she could not help the way her hand shook when he took it and pried her palm open.
She shook the vision away. It wasnât real. Her grandmother was dead along with her mother. It didnât matter what theyâd thought or what theyâd wanted. They werenât here. They werenât the ones who could get hurt and they couldnât keep the family from harm. But Natacha could.
âOur father is not a deserter.â Natacha refuted coldly. Fearlessly she spoke to the officer, her tone so unwavering that had Tony not known any better he would have believed her himself. âHeâs the Lion of Austria. Heâd never run from his duty.â
âCan you identify them?â Bucky asked, reaching for his gun and getting up from his pallet on the floor, where heâd been decidedly not sleeping. Scott was peering through the binoculars but at this time of night Bucky doubted heâd be able to discern whether they were in danger until the gestapo were nearly upon them. He glanced back once, gratified to see that the others had armed themselves and were ready for a confrontation.
Tonyâs face went white, surprise making him unable to hide either his shock or the painful blow the words landed.
He picked on Hoff just because he was smaller, lower in the ranks, and PÃ©ter wasn't going to let him. If that meant getting beat up every time he opened his mouth, well at least he knew he was doing the right thing and not just saying it. Not like father.
âI told the children. They know to keep to the room and not be a bother. Stefen and I have plans to go to the post today.â Tony said.Â  Going to the post was code for meeting with Maria.Â GrigÂ and the others knew that he and Steve were trying to connect with their allies through the post but not who was helping them.Â GrigâsÂ brow furrowed even deeper.
The rest of the house wasn't quite so cheerful. Da was still upset from the fight he'd had with Uncle Bucky, and Tony was tense and worried even though he smiled at them and told them he was sure everything would be fine. He was lying for their sake, and Ian knew better but he pretended like he believed him anyway because his younger siblings needed it.
Bucky returned four hours after the sun had set. Tony had fed and bathed the children and put them to bed by the time that the old car rolled up the drive and Harold let Bucky through the back door. Steve was waiting with the twins in the kitchen with Virginia who had already packed their bags and had them waiting by the door. Sheâd tightly drawn the curtains on all the windows and closed the shutters, on the off chance that should either the police or one of the staff return unexpectedly they would not be able to see the iron tub propped up on the table or the way that Captain Rogers housekeeper was gently working dye through Wandaâs hair.
âMy brother says, that over there the Slavs force the men into hard labor and the women into prostitution if youâre German.â Julia shared on a whisper, and Hortense paled as if she feared there were a band of hulking Slavs right outside the kitchen window.
Steve narrowed his eyes at her. Their years of friendship had taught him that when Charlotte stated the obvious at him, it was always to make a point.
He did them because it took more than one pair of hands to manage a house for a group of their size, and at the very least he wanted to set a good example to the children about being self-sufficient and helpful when the situation called for it. That point probably got lost on them what with Tony and the humorless Mathilde waiting on them, but Tony considered it a win when Maria and Artur had skipped into the kitchen after dinner, noticed what he was about and immediately asked if they could help.
Bucky nodded wordlessly and moved into place, griping Stefenâs sweat slick skin after Tony tossed the covers back, and clamping his jaw tight like someone bracing for a blow as he watched Tony clean around the area he intended to stick the needle.
Tony tried to surreptitiously reach for the pistol tucked against his chest without drawing anyone's notice. He knew Clint would be doing the same.
âIf you insist. I suppose you could say I got him fired. Or rather his temper did.â Tony explained. âI was a mouthy pupil.â
Tony clenched his shaking hands in his lap and aborted a sigh. It was beginning to feel that heâd done nothing at all for hours but shake his head and sigh. The sting of his uselessness kept biting him, and the guilt of his fraudulence sat souring in his gut. Look at him, sitting there on a lush cousin, while the Kleinâs and god only knew how many others had their lives ripped out from under them. Why did he deserve to be spared and not Joshua? Tony was the child of a convert too. He might have been born in an Austrian territory but it wasnât their
And Steve had loved her with everything in him and gotten the life heâd never thought to have. He'd been glad that the old fear that he was incapable of loving a woman had proved to be false. He was capable, but Bucky was right.
Even in the dim lighting he saw when that white eye rolled toward him like a dart and stuck, and he flinched back. Tony stepped forward, pushing PÃ©ter behind him in an almost protective gesture.
He forced his eyes open again and Tony was still there. He shifted closer on the bed, pushing Steveâs hair out of his eyes, his own eyes large and red rimmed. He seemed thinner than when Steve had last seen him, and there was a new cut was healing on his chin.
âStark, what are you doing up here?â the butler demanded to know. He was clearly surprised to find Tony there on the stairwell. His eyes flickered past Tony to the door, and Tony saw the moment when suspicion dawned in his eyes.
Tony didnât try to come up with a reply for that. The conversation swept briskly along regardless, thanks to Stanislovâs smooth handling. Tony took a seat at the admiralâs urging and the others followed suit, reclaiming their own. Stanislov on his left, Hoch to his right and the admiral straight ahead. With Sub-Lieutenant Amsel guarding the door it struck Tonyâs notice that he was effectively caged.
She turned away with a swirl of skirts and quickly disappeared into the crush, leaving Tony grumbling at her back. Was he the adult here or was she? Sometimes Natacha was far too worldly for her own good; but he conceded her point and made an effort to slow down on the number of drinks he had. Anxious or not, it wasnât the night to lose control.
âStark was amazing. The only real word for it. He was a true pioneer. He wasnât a sailor but he knew his way around a ship like nobody Iâve ever encountered. He knew the guts of it. The first time I ever met him I was serving on the Neptune, one of the brand new dreadnoughts that Stark was pushing out. She was faster than any other ship on the water and her guns, Iâd never seen anything that powerful. It even had the Brits pissing themselves. But Stark was still working out the kinks. Thereâd been a bit of a blow out in the engine room and Stark himself came down, because he was like that with new projects. It was personal with him. He knew every inch of that ship by heart.â
Stefen's mouth tightened, a haunted expression fleeting through his eyes and Tony knew even if he wouldn't say it, what would make a pair sign a confession of guilt and swear to leave their home and their children behind them.
Peter was still having trouble reading his pops, but anybody could tell that whatever he felt all those years ago was still present, at least a hint of it. he bit the inside of his cheek before asking.
"He is...incredible, he's so sweet and kind, and stands up for others, and makes me breakfast every day, and he's...well at least I thought he was honest...Why do you think they lied to us?" the boy asked sounding disillusioned, as he let himself fall to the ground.
He clapped his hands and look down at the clipboard, where the boys had signed their names, to double-check that they didn't have the same last name, but it wasn't even close. Peter had signed as, Peter.S Parker, and Ben as Benjamin Reilly Rogers.
"...um yeah but...You know things change, hey! Do you think that happens in Hogwarts? Like one day they call you into the headmaster's office and they're like oops we sorted you went to the wrong house or do you think that there's like a bunch of students who are asking to be in a different house...haha that be funny"
"But I don't really ask my pop's about him, but I do have a picture," Ben said with a beaming smile.
then jumped into the car he could feel his heart racing, he was just a car and plane ride away, and if he waited for 11 years, he could wait a few more hours.
"You are a horrible influence on my son".Â  his pops sounded defeated as he patted Peter's back to signal him to sit down properly."Your food is going to get cold".
Peter did a summersault on his bed and landed on the ground on the other side and answer the phone ."Benny, you won't believe what just happen, it's huge"
"Also, when my dad goes down to the lab, go with him, he won't ask you to accompany him, but I always do, and we both love it. If you don't, he's going to think you're mad, but trust me is super cool, because he normally ditches his work and does cool experiments with me, also just because he looks like he's not paying attention to you he absolutely is, so be careful what you say when you think he's distracted, and last but definitely, not least there is uncle Rhodey, doesn't live with us or anything, but he visits us as much as he can, always shows up for my birthday, and he's known my dad since college, so he might also know something. So if he shows up, feel free to ask him, if you can't get anything out of my dad, also, Happy and I are forever stuck in a war of snarky comebacks, so don't make me look bad.
"I can imagine". Tony then kissed the back of Ben's head before answering."What did you want to ask?"
Peter took a deep breath of relief and stopped planning his big escape. He looked down at his hands being grateful that he and Ben had the same coping mechanism when it came to dealing with stress.
He put them on, they were Big thick frame glasses with no prescription on them, and they were almost identical to Peter's.
"Come on you little smart-ass just because the plane has your name on it doesn't mean it's going to wait for you."
"Ben, you need to unpack". Steve brought him back to reality as he made his way to Ben's room with the big yellow duffle bag.
"Okay that's crazy it can't be the same, can it?! plus your picture is probably a whole picture, mine is just this wrinkly old photo that is ripped"
Ben took that advice and let himself fall into the bed, he really was tired. He heard his phone buzz.
"Huh?" He said trying to play dumb."Nothing pops." He pulled away and took and took a step back and tried to swing.
âMy father got arrested so my motherâs sending me away.â Daniel offered up; despite the stony silence he was met with in return. He seemed to need to talk, just to hear his own voice. âItâs just for a little while though, until she can get my father out of prison and itâs safe for Jews in Germany again. Iâd rather have stayed with her. I donât know how sheâs going to handle the farm without me.â
âNo, no, none of that. You were there. All of your incessant nagging about keeping my arms up in a brawl came in handy. The lollipop guild even got a few licks in. You taught us how to fight and then you came for us. Job well done soldier.â
He pressed his back flat against the wall and waited. No cry went up. Determining after a few moments that felt like an eternity that he seemed to remain undetected, Tony began to creep around the side of the lodge feeling for the notches heâd carved into the wood just below the loft window.
"That's right. You joined the monastery when you were seventeen years old." Agent Neuman mused aloud, as if he'd just remembered it before turning back around to face Tony who met his bland smile with a fierce stare of his own.
"Stay outta where you don't belong, Stark. Stefen might have been dumb enough to leave you with a key but -"
Steve woke slowly, the fog for once mostly clear of his head. Heâd been having a dream. Natacha and PÃ©ter had been there, in the room with him. Natacha had peered behind the door and then cautiously slid in...and sheâd been followed by PÃ©ter. His heart stuttered in his chest and squeezed his eyes shut tighter. It had been such a good dream. Natacha had curled into his side and PÃ©ter... Heâd been alive. Heâd been alright.
âThe Kleinâs havenât done anything wrong. Itâs all a mistake, one Iâm sure your father will get sorted out.â
Tony whirled around, carried by a sudden surge of impotent rage. He had no idea what he would have done or said, what he could possibly have said, that wouldnât have ended with them coming to blows or pushed Hammer into some bitter form of retaliation that could involve police. Tony didnât need proof to know it was him whoâd reported on the twins, and he had no idea why Hammer hadnât attempted to get Tony arrested since â but Pepperâs fierce warning glare wasnât at all misplaced.
âI donât expect you to watch them after dinner as long as their studies are complete. Do you think you can handle all this, Herr Stark?â He paused, waiting for Tonyâs answer. When Tony nodded he took a breath and continued.
His thoughts spiraled as the minutes ticked on, never landing on anything, skipping from ache to ache as the dreams played on like visions in his head. All of it was too heavyâ¦ too impossibly possible. It hurt. But he still wanted each and every one.
"Filip - " Steve began but he faltered at the sharp shake of Coulson's head and the hard look in his eye.
âWhat did you just say?â He growled. It was only the sound of Arturâs pained yelp and indignant squeal that made him remember himself.
Steveâs gaze flew back to their table only to find Charlotte sitting with a table full of young admirers, including Bucky, laughing gaily at some joke that he was making.
Floating in Steveâs arms Ian closed his eyes. The next step was to push his head away until Ian was in front of him and was floating on his own. But Steve found himself lingering.
Had he really risked his life staying in Austria for fleeting affair with a man who would set him aside as soon as it was necessary to do so?
Tony didnât know what it was but it always seemed to be one step forward and two steps back with these children. Though he truthfully didnât know what heâd expected. Could he really be angry with the daughter of a Nazi officer for wanting to behave like a Nazi?
Ian pushed the thought away and the rising annoyance at James with a vengeance. With Tony here now there was someone there at the other end of his long thinks. He didn't mind being alone but it wasn't the same as being lonely. Being alone was simple enough to stop when you wanted, but Ian found he could be lonely in a room full of people and never knew how to make it stop.
âIâm rom. What everyone else thinks doesnât matter!â Steve snapped and Buckyâs temper began to fray. So now the bastard was rom?! After everything theyâd sacrificed, everything theyâd lost for the greater good, now he refused to change who he was?
Tony nodded opening his mouth to elaborate but Natacha smoothly interrupted before he could get a word out.
What sort of work was this? He wanted to ask the doctor, whose badge pronounced him the head of the ward. This was not the work of healers.
But it couldnât be helped, and now he had his own part to play. Heâd anticipated the arrival of his order from Fabelâs Metals the entire journey home. It was due for delivery days ago. Cameronâs father Joshua had agreed to come from the village to lay a new floor and assist Tony with making the space work ready. They would need to work quickly, because if Tony was going to do as heâd promised and build the captain a get-away vessel for his rescue mission he didnât have a lot of time.
Major Rogers called for a halt, not taking his eyes off the Corporal, his body still and ready. Becker looked between them. What was this?
âHello,â she answered, her voice so quiet he nearly missed it.Â  A pretty voice, bell like, for a pretty girl.
He was off to Krakow, heâd announced, to visit his sister Rochel and her girlâs. Though the pinched look around his mouth maybe said that he either wasnât looking forward to it or he wasn't telling the truth again. Maybe.
But Tony doubted Frau Klein could even hear herself think in this racket so tonight at least, the antics of young boys would go unpunished. He did swipe the mug of cider out of Ianâs hand on his way by, giving the lad a quelling look when he squawked like he would protest.
Tony had never seen him this unkempt by choice. Captain Rogers, and then Major Rogers after him, always carefully presented himself with military polish. But heâd been changed. Theyâd both been changed. And Tony wondered what heâd want to present to the world now, given the option.
"Oh, not until spring.â Bethany heaved a sigh, as if the long months between her and spring were the most insurmountable thing she could imagine.
There were plans to make, and old ones heâd let gather dust that were just waiting for him to execute them. The children must be safe. They came first before anything else.
âJames why donât you get some rest.â There was pity for him and his reduced state evident in her every movement as her gentle hand reached toward him. He shook it off.Â  Fuck her pity. He was still standing, wasn't he?! And who the hell was she? Her fucking pedigree didn't make up for the hell she had put herself in. If she thought she would remain untouched when Stevie went down, just because sheâd won some genetic lottery, she was gonna be real sorry real soon. Rachol had thought she was safe behind a marriage too and look where that had gotten her.
âIâm trying to protect our country,â Steve bit out through his clenched teeth and Bucky sneered into his cup.
âYesâ¦ you know how he and Harry are. PÃ©ter only has a few days left at home. Heâd want to see Harry as much as he can.â
And then they sang of fall. Of trees turning their colors and cold setting in. Of soldiers leaving home and lovers separated across great distances.
Susann and Ret lived in an old apartment building not far from her shop. The walls of number ten Alcot Ave had survived for over a century and though were cracked and crumbling in some places they stood firm, ready it seemed to stand a century more.
âMore than I can say of their father. Is the Captain always soâ¦ militant?â Tony hedged, half expecting to be told off for his impertinence, but heâd already gotten this far and he was unable to resist the urge to push further (one of his many personality flaws according to Father Niklas).
Not unless she feared what Captain Rogers would think of it, and Tony knew that was the real reason for her protest. He scowled darkly. The man couldnât be allowed to
It made it all the more enjoyable to watch him enjoy those things when they came. Steve would never forget the way Tony had looked walking off the train in that white suit, the ruby red vest catching every eye on the platform and the firm evenly muscled chest it clung to keeping them there. With his dark hair catching the afternoon sunlight and that unusual little beard of his perfectly framing his grinning mouth heâd looked exactly as he should be, a man of influence and ease. And far too handsome for his own good or Steveâs peace of mind as women craned their necks to see him and traded whispers with their friends behind their hands.
But they wouldnât, he reminded himself, forcing continued calm. Because they didnât suspect anything between them. Still, he couldnât help the prickle of shame he felt whenever the subject of Tony came up and Bucky would look at him that way. It wasnât disgust necessarily, and fear didnât quite cover it either. Just a sense of otherness. Like Buckyâd opened his eyes one day and discovered Steve was some other type of creature entirely.
âAnd you look it,â Tony quipped, crossing his arms and continuing, âbut you are falling down, bumping and bruising your limbs, and losing your way home with alarming regularity. All of which points to a serious aliment of the mind. If it continues, Iâm afraid it really would be better to keep you at home until we have you properly looked at.â
Bucky was getting tired of waking with a sore head. Blearily, he opened his eyes and flinched at the bright light bleeding through the thin curtains that covered the window. It was the only one in the tiny room at the inn, and he vaguely remembered having yanked them closed the night before. Though in truth it had already been early hours of the morning by the time heâd checked in.
Shit! He jerked back to avoid getting shot and glared over at her, communicating with his eyes that if she valued living, sheâd get the hell out of there while she still could. It was her choice. The team knew that their job was to engage the enemy as long as possible, by whatever means possible. The rest was up to Bucky and he didnât have time to babysit.
The sight of both boys stood with their heads bent together gave them all pause. This could either be very good or very bad. In the short months Tony had been with the Rogers family he had yet to see them visibly collaborate together. Hell with those two even begrudging cooperation was a struggle.
"He told me women are supposed to like older men." She replied and at the face Tony made she laughed. âHe probably thinks I fancy you.â
Steve had the fleeting thought that Ian tagging along meant he wouldn't be able to push himself as hard as he would like, and heâd been rather desperately looking forward to pushing himself until he sweat the thoughts right out of his head, but he let the it go, not willing to deny him when it was still sitting so fresh on his mind how easily a man could find his family torn from him.
When he sensed that Ian was tired, he looked back, noting the way the boy dragged and weaved slightly with every step and called for a halt. He put him on the sled under a blanket and made him drink down a ladle of hot soup.
He took a step forward but froze when Schmidt snapped, âYour place is where I tell you it is. Captain.â The Generalâs voice seemed to echo in the quiet little office.
âNow. Shall I tell you why I'm really here and why I've called a meeting with you? Yes, I think I shall. I'm here because I simply had to be the one to deliver the news. You and your family are to go on a tour.â
Stefenâs stillness and the careful way he lowered the folder down onto the table was enough to draw Tonyâs attention away from explosives, and Tony realized why he was making
That was what Steve was afraid of. He was operating blindly, only knowing that Kirkâs ship made a stop in Pola on the way to the Gibraltar strait. He did not know for what clients or how often. The strait being the only entry point from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic made Gibraltar crucial fighting ground for the allied powers. They had been quick to take control and enforce a naval blockade. It was a galling thing to know that the British were so close, but that very blockade may be the thing keeping the Enterprise from reaching Polaâs shores.
Hands cradle his hips and then Tony is inside him, time slipping like a rock over water. One minute Steve is reveling in the trails of heat Tonyâs mouth makes across his skin, and in the next all he knows is the sensation of being filled and pushed into the bed. He wanted more of it. He told Tony so. Told him every last filthy thing heâd ever thought about him, about what he wanted to do to Tony and what Tony should do to him. He told Tony things heâd hardly dared to think, let alone speak aloud.
âPositive. I took it straight from Schmidtâs desk myself.â He answered and Loki, looking up from where he was pouring an amber colored liquor into a collection of small tumblers sat upon the coffee table, made a small considering noise.
Tony held Maria tight to his chest, breathing heavily. Steve recognized that look in his eyes. It was panic so strong it shocked the system. The look a soldier got sometimes, the first time he shot a man dead or saw a comrade killed. It was a look that said Tony was going nowhere short of Steve dragging him, and that wasnât good. They had to move. Steve took a slow step toward him, trying to disentangle Artur and James along the way as he gently called the manâs name. âTony?â
âBut I promised you the end of the line.â Bucky snorted. âChrist, if Iâd know you were gonna be dragging me around trying to find it.â
Thankfully heâd paused to yank off his shoes and socks before he plowed into the water, but the dark blue of his trousers had gone black in the water and Tony prayed his stitching would hold.
"It's not up for debate Chavo." Tony felt a brief flash of gratefulness when Bucky backed him up. PÃ©ter however wasn't having it.
If it were anyone else Steve would have called his tone pleading. To think that Tony Stark would be sitting in his music room, head turned and neck bared, begging Steve not to die was unfathomable. It was â¦ impossible. Unlessâ¦. Steveâs heart began to thud heavily in his chest and he took a step forward, feeling like he'd been socked in the jaw.
âThere hasnât been an occasion,â Steve bit out, a tad too sharply, and instantly he felt shame because he knew that wasnât entirely true. Janâs arch brow called him a liar and seemed to wordlessly point out the truth of their surroundings. This was an occasion and heâd not even thought to ask Charlotte for a waltz.
âI made a mistake sending you to be a teacher.â The monk said with a dark kind of glower, but he reached inside his dark cloak and pulled out a small lumpy envelop. PÃ©ter could just make out a single word scrawled on the front starting with a loopy T, before Nik had smacked the envelope against Tonyâs chest.
Tony winced at the hopefulness in the childâs voice. It was a heart condition. He didnât know much about heart conditions but he was almost certain you didnât just grow out of them.
âPlants are good for that, unfortunately thereÂ arenâtÂ a lot of those to go around right now.â Tony answered and James pouted, turning to glare at the window where the sun shone warmly, but it was still winter white outside.Â How long did winter last up here?
Their language had been coded but rife with tension as they argued in heated whispers about the risks of some unnamed venture. Even though heâd not been able to discern exactly what they were up to it had been the way they stood that had made Ludy certain they were a bad sort, up to no good.
He whispered the words; barely aware his lips were moving. Feidor had made a joke...yesterday-three nights ago? Steve had laughed.
He didn't know why he felt so compelled to eat when they brought him things. Maybe it was because when he'd been sick as a child, his mother would sit beside him, spooning him food from her own bowl. Somehow it was more of the same; when Tony sat beside his bed and fed him soup, or Natacha came with cake and coffee, he could almost hear his mother's coins tinkling, smell the lavender she liked to wash with as she told him it was time to eat now.
âPÃ©terâs old enough to know how to handle himself Stefen,â Bucky said, clapping Steve on the back as he moved to join James and Ian. âAnd quit being so bossy James. We need Ian âcause I need one of you to tell me what weâre doing here and the other to show me.â
âThank you, Virginia.â Steve snapped back into action, gesturing to Harold to begin loading the supplies into the car. âHarold the car. Bucky, did you get the papers?â
His laugh was a little more strained this time. Thankfully at that moment the royal party was announced. All five of their foreign guests descended the grand staircase in a glittering procession. Even from where Steve was standing in the crowd Norwayâs Crown Prince was unmistakable. Perhaps heâd ask for a pencil and sketch them for Maria, there had to be paper someone could fetch. Tony had written about Mariaâs never ending questions about the prince and his wife.
Tony didnât shrink back but Steve could see his thoughts moving behind his mind, that quicksilver brilliant mind of his that was always going and
âHeâs been showing it off for hours,â Natacha kneeling in the dirt with Mariaâs head on her lap murmured in agreement and bolstered James nodded.
Natacha dropped her spoon on her plate with a loud clatter and glared so ferociously it nearly drowned out the roar of indignation, all of the children clambering in a combination of shock, confused anger, and hesitant delight over the prospect of a new adventure.
"But the poster... I thought they were gypsies." Like you seemed to scream in the silence but said once before, Tony did not tempt fate by saying the words aloud a second time. Stefen huffed a disparaging breath.
Schmidtâs colorless eyes followed Steve and the other test subjects as they made their way down the stone steps and into the yard where a table was set up. The head doctor and three other officers Steve didn't recognize were sitting behind the table amongst a mountain of paperwork. Schmidt stood off to the side with a line of SS men, watching on. Steve and the other subjects were made to walk in a wide circle around the courtyard. That was it. Just walk and then run when the whistle blew and then walk again. Walk, run, walk, run, walk again, Steve just followed the shaved head of the man in front of him step after step, letting the minutes bleed into hours. He didn't know how long he walked in the dusty snow because he wasn't tired, and nothing hurt. At least it didnât hurt any more than burn that had taken up permanent residence in his bones. That coupled with the disjointed and hazy nature of his thoughts almost made the exercise pleasant.
âW-what?â Ian gaped, his head swiveling around back to the husband with shock, his heart beginning to thump hard again.
âHold your horses, Capâ he grunted and Stefen had the good graces to look a little chagrined as he released Tony's arm; the offending hand clenching into a fist at his side. The captain took a slight breath his eyes traveling over Tony's face. Tony was growing used to these states now that Stefen was home more often. The manic bursts of energy that powered him for days rivaled even Tonyâs creative benders but the move would inevitably pass, leaving him brittle and pale.
"Charlotte, if something were to happen to meâ¦ my children are not safe in Salzburg anymore.â Steve implored, tightening his grip on her hands in earnest. âThey've gotta be safe, Charlotte. I trust you. There isn't anyone else I'd ask for help in this." She was looking worried now. Chewing her bottom lip. He scooted closer, adrenaline pushing him forward and he noticed that she leaned away. His intensity must be palpable.
Herr Stark stared at him. PÃ©ter had never felt more like one of Arturâs beetles, Tonyâs eyes pinning him in place. Swallowing back the lump logged in his throat PÃ©ter didnât back down. He stood straight, head lifted proudly the way heâd seen his father do so many times and stood his ground.
âI was excited because it was just us boysâ¦ only not Artur, because he was still a baby like Sara and he has trouble breathing sometimes.â
âI bet that was enjoyable.â Steve replied, dry as toast â but there was this damn sparkle in his eye, like he and Stark were sharing a private joke.
He could get a good look around, see if he could find any trace of Stevie the gestapo might have missed. Heâd parked the car a little down the road, ready if anything went south.
A bright light shone from the top, powering the rest of the city. A bright light for everyone. So he was a bit of a romantic. Sue him.
PÃ©terâs expression sobered, his top teeth worrying his bottom lip as he considered what Tony himself was still considering.
As Bakhuizen took the violin from her and once more began to fill the air with the sound of strings, not for the first time Tony wondered how a father alone was supposed to help a girl flower into womanhood and not feel completely out of his depth. He did not envy Stefen that task.
"Growing up is funny that way." Tony acknowledged with a knowing hum, crossing over to help Ian tie his kerchief.
So that was it then. The last hope for Germany rested on the Abwehr, and the church was full of spies. Now heâd seen everything. And to think theyâd been watching Steve all this time. God damn but he'd known Stark was a snake!
âOh Captain, youâre still here? Weâd almost forgotten. Youâd better get a move on. The children and I canât start our mission with the guest of honor loitering around!â
âWe donât know Herr, Stark,â came the prompt and expected reply. Natacha staring blankly somewhere past Tonyâs head jumped when he loudly snapped the lesson book shut.
âThat isnât funny. â Stefen warned darkly, rising from his seat. His heart was slamming in his chest though every inch of him was battle ready. âYouâre drunk.â
âBut why all these slow dreary ballads?â He asked with an exaggerated expression of distaste and Maria giggled.
âAre you ready to go?â Stefen asked, appearing at Tonyâs side with Arturâs book and a small wrapped parcel in hand and Tony wondered briefly at it. Another gift for the children perhaps, though it was too small to be a doll for Maria.
His son looked at him, his expression black, his gaze holding Steve's for the first time that evening.
âI like ara candids!â Artur broke in excitedly only casting his father a wary glance out of the corner of his eye. Steve swallowed more soup.
He ran directly into Vreni as he left the boys room and had barely finished apologizing for that when Cameron came darting out of nowhere with arms full of linens and nearly crashed right into him.
âIt was most certainly a pleasure to meet you captain. Keep in touch. My husband would be most glad.â
Steve eyed the droplets, waiting for them to spill. His stomach cramped at the vivid memory of swollen bodies.
It helped that PÃ©ter was away at school. Once they learned that he was a âscholarly sortâ and would likely be in Switzerland all through university, most of the women who felt they just had to talk to him about how eager their daughters were to embrace motherhood backed off; but there was no halting those who wanted to congratulate him on Natachaâs beauty and strength of character, and to ask whether or not she had her heart set on anyone. As if they believed at twelve years old her head was only filled with thoughts of how quickly she could hold a baby in her arms, and that any of them cared in the first place what her heart wanted.
âCaptain Rogers!â He greeted with a wide grin and the smile that Stefen returned was warm and sincere.
. No one knew how long the war would rage or how far it would reach, but for damn sure it would reach British shores. Stefen had to know that, but he was too focused on the choice heâd already made. Tony couldnât let that go unchallenged.
âIâm the heir to a fortune Stefen, where would I have learned to spank a fish?â he said at one point, poking at the belly of the thing with his face screwed up in an expression of horror. âI said scale the fish and you know it. Youâre just being difficult,â the captain replied dryly, and Tony had to suppress a grin.
It was infuriating that no matter what he did that Steve could not conquer the fear that gripped his mind whenever he thought for a second that he was back there. He might have cracked as easily as bread and woken the entire room with his whimpering if not for Tony. It was equally frustrating that Steveâs body was so contradictory and useless. When he wanted to be loving it betrayed him, but when he was shivering in the dark losing himself to terror like the coward he truly was, fixating on the scent of Tonyâs hair and the pleasure-pain of holding him close was all that kept Steve tethered to sanity.
âWhy donât you try.â Â He heard PÃ©ter ask and Tony glanced up, more than willing to see what Stefen (or even Bakhuizen) could do with a rifle. There was gossip and there was seeing it for yourself after all.
âTony?â Stefen questioned gently, a note of worry in his tone and Tony opened his eyes once more, pleading.
âHey Ginger, wait a moment.â She heard Bucky call after her and halted, turning to see him leaning against her fatherâs automobile. He was regarding her with a strange intensity, something grim and dark behind his eyes that made her think wildly that he must know. He must have guessed somehow what she was thinking about doing to Tony.
Why not? People looked at Bucky and saw difference and a reason for suspicion. They looked at Steve and saw their ideals. Even though he and Bucky shared the same blood (same people) fate had given Steve his very own disguise in the face of a gadjo.
Steve watched intently, PÃ©ter had a point. Whatever ignorance he had of his people was entirely Steve's fault.
âAnd why is that?â Tony asked with a grin and Sara glared furiously at her siblings as she clutched to him.
That seemed to snap Bucky out of it, his gaze locking on Tony and the others and doing a rapid count before he turned and leaped back into the driverâs seat of the truck. Tony ran around to the passengerâs side as the others piled into the open back.
Tony was happy to see PÃ©ter so involved in the lesson, truly challenged in a way that he couldnât be when they had his younger siblings to consider.
He could recite it from heart, knew the story better than his drills and his ditties. His fingers trailed over the damaged pages and he sighed again, his heart sitting heavy in his chest. He couldn't help it, the stupid tears just leaked out of him no matter what he did. He didnât want to be around the others he decided.
âThey are calling the ambassador who was shot a hero and patriot. They are asking how long the people should suffer the menace of the Jews. They wonder if there are no brave Germanâs left, who will avenge him.â Olasz commented dryly, as if he did not see what was happening below them or the horrible potential.
Dvorak didnât move orÂ speak,Â and Steve stood on shaking legs, waiting, pleading silently with the other man not to pull the trigger. Henrickâs unsteady breaths plumed in the cold winter air between them for a long drawn out moment, but it was Steve who spoke first.
Czechoslovakia was lost but If he could get confirmation that they intended to move on Poland next, it might urge his contacts in British parliament to move.
He sometimes looked at his da and thought there might be something like that hanging round his neck. The thing that turned him into the Captain and not âdaâ. It felt like his da had always had it, whatever it was, and if that where the case then maybeâ¦maybe Ian had it too.
âMostly paperwork I confess.â He replied as Khalmmer rose to refill his glass. âIâll have another one, while youâre up.â
The door swung open, light flooding in from outside and pouring over their faces. Stefen stood there in the doorway, tense and ready with pistol cocked, drawn by the commotion.
Those things didnât happen to them, couldnât happen to them because they were on the right side. Herr Stark wasnât, but he could be fired, he could go away. She could make him go away but it would all be for nothing if Father was himself disloyal.
âI wonât let you hurt him again.â Tony warned, eyes cold and fists clenched. Bucky imagined how easy it would be to snap his fool neck.
Stefenâs team was fast and relentless, but Tony and PÃ©ter had built a damnably good wall to combat the deluge of snowballs. They should have been the winners, but Buckyâs team was full of sneaks and dirty fighters who employed dishonorable tactics. Natacha convinced Sara to aid their team by going around and stuffing snow down everyoneâs boots, giggling all the way as they scrambled to avoid her. And as things dissolved into chaos Natacha and her teammates pelted the little girlâs helpless targets mercilessly with snow.
Tony barked a laugh, enjoying the quiet accompaniment of Stefenâs chuckles. Tipping his head up toward the sky he breathed in deeply, taking in a lungful of sweet air as he sorted through the strong and sudden urges he felt.
Ian buried himself further into the sofa and growled. He didnât like the poem. The image of the dead bird weighing down the sailor, imagining the constant overpowering stench.
âGet out of here, go on.â Tony barked stepping threateningly toward him and Clinton danced away, his familiar chuckle rumbling with an unfamiliar deepness as he disappeared into the dark.
"But I think he ratted us out, cause we were about an hour from the border when a patrol stopped the train and demanded to see everybody's papers. We had to jump from the luggage car."
And the war is finally here! We will be following Steve and Tony through the war to the conclusion of their tale but it won't take another thirteen years in Azkaban, I promise.
The man in the cap gave him a scrutinizing stare before shrugging and turning his attention back to his paper. The woman on the other hand looked stunned, her eyes flicking over his uniform in disbelief as if she had to check to be sure her eyes weren't playing tricks on her. But she wasn't brave enough to challenge him on it further and for once he was grateful.Â  At that moment the whistle for the next train filled the cafe, the windows beginning to rattle as the train approached the station. The cafe filled with motion as most of its cliental, including the man in the cap, hastened to wrap up their lunches and head toward the station down the street. Deiter watched him go, trying to determine why the sense of familiarity still nagged him as the man disappeared into the crowd.
Steveâs eyes flew up toward the ceiling even as Bucky was asking her, face clouded with confusion, âSo he
The duchess was, from what Steve could tell, as tall as her husband was. She wore a simple silver gown with one long, thick, blood red ribbon running around her waist and down her back. Her jet black hair coiled neatly behind her head. Really, though, it was her eyes that really caught him. Sharp and bright, they could pin a man from across the room.
âYou canât decline the FÃ¼hrer! Are you mad?â Charlotte shot back just as hot, her hand convulsing on his chest. Steve removed the appendage and woodenly shut the door theyâd left open.Â  He was aware on some level that she was still speaking, and they were purposeful words, important words. They moved around him as he moved around her. Rolled off him like water until she snatched his arm and forced him to look at her face contorted in fear. He couldnât take that â not now. Not on top of everything.
âWhat the hell do you know about it Buck?â Stefen exploded, slamming his sketchbook down on the table. Buckyâs heart leaped in his chest but he braced himself, glad for the fight if only because he knew Stefen and would always prefer to see him come up swinging. It was a good thing. Far better than the alternative.
âA cardinal would never open his own door.â Tony pointed out solemnly and the other manâs brow twitched in irritation. Wordlessly he came around and yanked open the passenger side door.
The small alpine town of Siegsdorf was about an hours drive from Salzburg.Â  He took the same old familiar route heâd taken so many times during the early days â just after the Great War had ended. It was driving through these mountains that had made him so certain he wanted to build his home in the country in the first place.
Bucky gave a heaving sigh as soon as he and Steve had left the bar. Beside him Steve reached into his jacket, fishing out the pack of cigarettes he kept there by habit and handing them over to Bucky. Steve rarely indulged but he knew that Bucky went through his smokes like they were motherâs milk. Bucky nodded silently in gratitude and pulled out two, sticking one into his mouth and jerking his head toward the ally.Â  Steve followed him wordlessly and Bucky found a cleaner looking section of wall to lean on as he lit up, the silence hanging heavy between them.
She could hear his teeth grinding, and the intense way that he stared at her set her on edge. Collecting her letter Charlotte stood, turning so that he was no longer at her back.
âYes, Iâd heard your father sent you away. I wasnât surprised. Sadly, despite such a promising sire, Antony was one of my worst pupils. Lazy, arrogant, and convinced he was far superior than he was.â Vonkov explained in a snide tone for the delight of their rapt audience and Steve clenched his fist, wanting to sock the man in his teeth. Tony for his part kept his expression polite as the man continued.
"I'm sorry.â Her voice sounded weak even to her own ears and she hated it. Hated it even more when he said, "I know I can count on you to take care of your brothers and sisters.â
"Do you know what we used to call him?" Major DvoÅÃ¡k asked his comrade, tilting his head as he eyed Rogers training report. His lips twisted in a sneer. He spared their 2nd Lieutenant a glance as the man limped into the office, caring a change of uniform on one arm. He'd told him to take better care of his feet but you couldnât tell junior officers anything these days.
Tony hadnât told Stefen what heâd seen. He might have, had things carried on and Stefen not come to his senses about sending PÃ©ter away, but as it stood Tony saw no reason to cause an undo uproar that would only upset the household and damage the tender understanding Stefen and the boy had reached. Then again, he thought snidely, maybe Tony was just all too good at keeping secrets and there was nothing altruistic about it.
