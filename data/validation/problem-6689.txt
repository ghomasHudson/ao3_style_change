"I can't keep myself locked in a bathroom for that long," she whispered back. "And Steve is the one in trouble."
“Buh-ee,” Jamie said, turning to look at Bucky when he let out a huff through his nose. Tony’s eyes opened a bit more, then looked over at Bucky. “Buh-ee, bye?” Both Meg and Steve took a step away from Tony and Bucky.
"I left the key to your apartment in mine, so bear with me." Mary used a different key to open her door, holding it open for Steve once again, and dropped off her jacket on a highbacked chair by the door. Steve stopped in the entryway and looked around. These apartments were much bigger than he had ever seen, even the apartment that Bucky and his family lived in. The living room was very large, two couches there, and the largest TV he had ever seen. The dining room was separate from the kitchen, and the kitchen even had an island in the middle, giving more counter space than he thought his favorite local diner used to have.
Peter nodded a little and Steve stood up, keeping Peter in his arms. Steve rubbed his back, heading for the elevator doors that Jarvis was opening for them. "I know things seem really scary right now, but, I'm going to do my best to make things better."
"Come with me, and shut your mouth," Tony muttered. Steve eyed Tony but got Rachel inside. "I have half a mind to let her at you once inside. That's worse than anything I could ever do to you. You're not even supposed to be here, I know for a fact that you got the restraining order."
"Oh, the misery, the exquisite tragedy, the Susan Haywood of it all. I actually know who she is," Steve whispered that part before continuing. "I can just picture you there, sitting alone at your table in your white dress and lavender flower."
"We'll leave at Oh-Five-Hundred," she told him as he moved towards the door. Steve sighed as he left to track down Tony.
“I don’t think I want to advertise that just yet.” Steve picked up the doublet and looked it over. “How am I going to carry Jamie with this? How are you going to carry Jamie in that?”
Until she heard the shouting from behind, footsteps running. She turned and her eyes widened as the same time she resigned herself to this being her luck. There was a very awake, very determined, and startled, looking Steve Rogers running across the lobby. Mary had told them that the 1940's room wasn't going to work, and it seemed she had been right as a small mass of Agents ran after him. The last thing he remembered was fighting Hydra, and SHIELD was still the SSR, and it was also 65 years ago.
“Hey Petey, let’s get one with Jamie, yeah?” Tony suggested. Peter stared at him for few seconds, eyes blank. “It’ll be fun, and you can show off how you taught her to stand.” That seemed to be the ticket to get peter to, almost grudgingly, accept. Neither of the men had missed how Jamie always turned to look at Peter when he was talking, even if it wasn’t to her. She liked to be near him, or at least have him in sight when she knew that he was around. She was also starting to associate that wherever Peter was, usually Wade was there, too.
"You only use last names in a professional manner, or if they've made you mad." Tony was picking up on Steve's mannerisms quickly.
Steve grabbed Tony's hands, stilling him, making him look up into his face. "What happened?" Steve asked, and it was enough to almost make him break down right there in the lab.
"You don't sound too excited about him going on a vacation." Steve said as he kissed along Tony's jaw. "Are you upset that you aren't going to be the first one to take him there?" Steve hadn't been to Disney World yet, either, he knew it could be different with a parent and their child.
"Defense?" Tony raised his eyebrows in shock. "I don't know what you did before you came here, unleashing death and destruction, but-"
"Why does Jarvis still called her Parker?" Steve mumbled, turning to try and bury his head into Tony's hair.
As much as Tony still wanted to be angry with him, he just missed Steve. He told himself that it was stupid, to miss him more on this day more than any other, but it seemed to be human instinct. This time last year he was alone as well, so what did it matter that he was alone again, on another Valentine's Day?
The two sat in, not a companionable silence, but it wasn't awkward, until the teachers blew their whistles. All the kids ran back over, the end of recess, and got ready to muddle through the rest of classes. As they marched back inside, Tony stood up from the bench. He gave a little side glance over to Steve, silent for a second.
"Well, that's a hot spot." If Tony could have shrugged int he suit, he would have. "Sounds like someone stepped in and did you job for you, huh?"
“Don’t joke about that.” Tony pointed a finger in Steve’s face, making his eyes go crossed a little. “I think they could be more dangerous than Dr Doom if they put their mind to it.” Steve creased his brows. “Okay, should have picked a better villain. But, my point is, when we come back, your bestie is going to be a babysitting pro, or a broken man.” Now Steve was raising his eyebrows. “These are our kids we’re talking about.”
"This is her floor, and I assume Coulson's, with a room for Peter of course" Bruce said with a wave around the kitchen. "Her parents are staying in a guest room on this floor as well, but I would assume that if Peter gets his way, they'll have their own floor. Probably end up living here half the year, or something."
"I did not come out with notecards this time, so I'm afraid we're all in for another ride." He smiled, the few laughs rippling through the crowd. "Anyway, it seems like there are a couple of things that I need to address, and I think the cards would only distract from the frantic yelling that you'll all do anyway. Am I right?" And on cue, they all started to yell his name, hands and pens in the air.
Tony didn't move, he watched her drop to her knees in front of him, and bring her hands up to his head. He was defiant in his gaze, watching her eyes light up with red again, throwing them both into his head of horrors. Neither of them were expecting what happened though.
"Don't think we didn't notice you not answering the question," Mary retaliated. "He was on the phone with Clint this morning, so I know that you figured something out if he's coming back to the Tower. He's bringing his dog by the way, so try not to let Peter see it. He'll want one."
“It really is you,” she breathed, sitting up a little more. “I had seen the news, but I wasn’t sure….” Steve gave her a soft smile before walking over, the two wrapping their arms around each other. “Oh, Steve, it’s really you.”
"Pretend you're not seeing anything," Tony said automatically. "Really, I'm just lacking the energy to kick you out of the kitchen." And he kind of didn't want to be left alone just yet. When the drink was done he had planned on checking on Peter while he grabbed some pain killers.
"Right, I'll take the call in the guest room." Tony pressed the journal into Steve's hands. "Read it, I’ll be back."
"Because dating is loose and free," Mary said matter-of-factly. "You know, like I do, that dating someone can end easily. More easily than a marriage can." Tony snorted softly. "Usually marriage means that someones serious about something."
I'm also thinking in the future (near future), if people are interested, in making gift fics, because that's fun. More into that later.
"Your fellow warrior had the unique experience of becoming acquainted with the entity that fueled the invasion on this realm." Loki's voice was calm, and it was getting on Tony's nerves.
"I'm starting to think that I shouldn't leave the Tower anymore." Tony walked over to grab the tablet, noticing that Steve left the camera footage up for him. "Or maybe I just shouldn't leave you alone- Hey." He looked down and sat that Jamie had wheeled herself over to follow Tony, bumping into his leg. "Hey munchkin! Was I not giving you enough attention? Did Papa ignore you today?”
“Did you tell him?” Tony asked as he picked the song back up, and Steve nodded. “I wish he wasn’t so perceptive sometimes. At least he knows, and maybe he won’t worry so much about it.” Steve glanced over at him. “I don’t need to look up to know what kind of look that you’re giving me.”
“How bad was it to give you nightmares like this?” Mary asked softly, and Tony squeezed his eyes shut. “Are they worse?”
Looking around the apartment again Steve noticed toys, blankets, and some stray clothes lying around. He saw picture frames on the wall, and on table surfaces, almost all of them containing a small boy.
Time was running out. If that's what would happen, and it would keep both Mary and Peter safe, then that's what had to happen. He made a promise, and he was going to keep it. He wouldn't let this be Peter's legacy, he wouldn't let danger keep coming after him. "Just do it!" He shouted back down. Stane launched another missile and the roof shook, making him dangle, to where he could see Mary now.
"The active cells are triggering the dormant ones," Tony said, pulling up another screen to the side of the results, in formulaic form this time. "Add a few more corn kernals to the hot oil, and just wait for the heat to distribute. It's like, steroids for a Super Soldier. I wouldn't have been able to calculate for that." Bruce looked at Tony then, catching his eyes, knowing where his thoughts were headed.
“I should be reassuring you,” Steve whispered to him. Tony’s lips twitched slightly in a smile. He squeezed Tony’s hand a little, then just held onto him. Jamie was sniffling, her hiccups going away, and she fell asleep against Tony’s side. Steve hoped that a lot of Tony’s worries could stop now, that he’d actually be able to sleep, to return to some semblance of normal.
"Take it slow, that couldn't have been pleasant to the head," Steve told him. Tony's pupils were shrinking and growing back and forth as he tried to gain his bearing.
"Sir?" Tony opened his eyes at Jarvis's voice. He saw that the computer screens were lit up with test results. When had Tony taken the blood sample? He glanced at his arm and saw that there was a little gauze square with a little spot of blood on it. Huh.
"There is nothing except this," he looked at her. If he didn't, if he didn't try to stop this, to change his name, his legacy, Peter's legacy. "There's no art opening. There is no benefit, there is nothing to sign."
There is a slight description of an anxiety attack below, and I wrote it while starting to experience my own. I really relate to my characters. :)
"Oh don't worry, I'll figure that out," Tony grinned. "Steve, my boys made me a pilot! A scoundrel even! I'm so proud!"
Steve took a deep breath, watching the sun set from the roof of the apartment building, sitting in Mary's borrowed lawn chair. He assured her that he still remembered what watching the fireworks was like, sitting in a lawn chair at the highest point you could find. Bucky would go scout out a place for them, usually not too far away, and if his Ma could get the night off, she would follow them. She always requested the Fourth off, wanted to spend the whole day with her son on his birthday, but that didn't happen too much. Steve never minded so much, Bucky was there, and his Ma always made a little cake for them to share before she left for work. He knew that she had to work, and that the night of the Fourth was always the busiest for the hospitals, for the Nurses and Doctors.
"But, why wait for so long to start using it?" Tony sat down on one of the lab stools. "They're not shy about using it while unstable, so why wait if they stole this nearly two decades ago?" His tablet beeps and he grabs it without thinking. Jarvis has broken through.
The first fireworks started to go up and Steve's attention was brought back to the present. He let a smile cross his face as others joined in, a symphony of color in the sky. He was glad that Mary had suggested that he bring up a radio at the same time, as well. The pops and bangs of the fireworks could have easily dragged him into war-time memories. He was determined to enjoy his birthday.
"You're ruining my image, Tony." Tony grinned when he saw Steve biting his lip to keep from laughing.
Tony's eyes almost widened in disbelief, but he really shouldn't have been surprised. They were used to making weapons, to make their fortunes on others deaths and power. "I'm being responsible!" He looked between the two people again. He was trying to turn his life around, trying to make the world a better place for his son, trying to be a better person for his son. "That's a new direction for me," he paused for a second, "for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf, being for the way that,..." He could see that they weren't buying it, just looking at him. He sighed and threw the rest of his pizza down, then grabbed the box. "This is great."
Tony took a deep breath before turning on his foot, sliding down onto the bed. Mary kept a hold on his wrist, but her hand slid down to rest over his. “Bruce and I figured out a new element. Amazingly it was Howard that did the ground work, hiding an element in the design of the Stark Expo. I saw it the opening night of the Expo. It took a day or so to get made, but we got it worked out, and I couldn’t be feeling better.” He pulled the collar of his shirt down to show her that the black lines had disappeared.
The book was leather bound, well-worn, but not thin. He reached a hand out and slowly slid it towards him. When he opened the cover he saw familiar hand-writing. "How did you get a hold of this?" Tony growled out. His father's journal, another one.
"I always thought that taste was evolving, and that people were supposed to move on from the Eighties," Meg fired back sweetly. Tony raised an eyebrow at her.
What the hell had Steve added to his playlist now? Tony frowned at the song and shook his head, not in the mood to respond just yet. Maybe after his shower.
“Well, it was weird, so I went with something a little more normal, low-key.” Steve stretched his arm around along the bench seat of the car, going around Tony’s shoulders as he drove. “I’ve been thinking about taking you to this place for a while, but it’s one of those places that I don’t want ruined by a call-out, or just a date disaster in general.”
"I just used what was available to me!" Steve said through his laughs, grinning. "If it helps, I didn't remember this until after you made your guess."
"That's enough!" Steve kind of felt like a scolding parent. Steve was already done with this shit. He jumped down and looked at Thor, Stark lowering his weapons. "Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here-"
An hour later Steve was waiting outside in the driveway again, sans shovel, and looked up as he heard the jets of Iron Man boots approaching the small house. Meg hadn't been kidding when she said it was small, it was almost the size of the Queens apartment, which just wasn't going to work.
“Peter doesn’t seem so hostile towards Jamie anymore,” Pepper barreled on, knowing this was how you got Tony Stark to speak. “And I know I didn’t miss it, but you’re saying Papa to Peter.”
"I think I have an idea of why Peter wants to stay home, though," Mary said, a hint of mischief in her voice. Tony hummed, acting all put upon, but he wasn't as bothered as he wanted them to think. The only thing he wasn't happy about was being in 'the neighbor's' apartment, where his son was apparently staying.
"Tony's doing his best to keep him calm, and telling him everything he knows," Steve answered truthfully. "His grandparents are here as well, so that may help. I can tell that Tony doesn't like being away from Peter, though, even if it is just in the hallway."
"Trust me, I know." Steve was looking out towards the windows. "He'll talk to me when there's a mission to report on, but I can't get anything else out of him. I know Bucky's still in there-"
Tony took a breath, arm in his sling, suit on, sitting next to Rhodey on the cargo plane. They were getting closer to California, and he knew that the news would be reporting his return soon, about half an hour after the plane landed. "Rhodey," he tried again. The other man looked over at him, and Tony stared straight forward, getting his courage up. "I need you to do me a favor, after we get back."
Tony hadn't been handling things well after The Battle of New York, and she thought that maybe something was getting better between him and Steve. Steve said that Tony had talked to him, but he wouldn't say about what. Mary was glad that Steve was so loyal, protecting him, but in some ways Tony's behavior hadn't changed at all. He was still only sleeping when he passed out from sleep deprivation, staying in the workshop while Peter was in school or asleep, and only eating if she or Steve brought him something. The two men had gotten closer, and she thought she caught them kissing once. Perhaps it wasn't enough, yet. She cared about Tony, she had since Peter was just a baby. He was the father to their son, and one of her best friends.
"You could call him." Tony looked up and over at Bruce, expression not amused by the suggestion. "It's a valid suggestion."
Tony waited, watching the way he walked off, and when Steve didn't come back in, Tony headed in another direction. The lights behind him started to dim down as Tony approached the bar. He leaned down, grabbed a crystal decanter and set it on the counter. Empty glasses were sitting off to the side, upside down from being washed, ready to be used, and he knew that there was ice in the mini-fridge that his knees were touching.
"I could always get Coulson over there," Natasha said quietly in his ear, comm unit on. She always knew what he was thinking about.
"You were right," Steve said as he stood back up, and Mary looked over at him. "His Dad had promised dessert." Mary chuckled and nodded and the two headed over to her apartment. "Does he regularly do that? Promise dessert?"
Mary and Coulson knew the moment that Tony and Peter arrived at the restaurant, and Mary was very glad that she had picked a very casual restaurant, where you seat yourself. A small plastic Captain America shield went flying over their head, landing on the floor, and there was an adult sounding 'Whoop!' from behind. Peter ran over, grinning, picking up his shield, his plain ballcap from earlier replaced with a blue ball cap with the shields symbol embroidered on it. He was also sporting a new Captain America t-shirt underneath his new Captain America hoodie.
“Shit, Steve,” Tony breathed out, his hands resting on Steve’s shoulders, digging his fingers into his skin. He moved his head to the side, baring his neck a little more for Steve, moaning when Steve moved his mouth, sucking harder. “I would love to take credit,” he sucked in a breath when Steve bit down a little, “for the things your mouth can do, but fuck.” Steve chuckled a little against his neck.
Steve was buckling in and Tony turned to check on the kids, making sure that Peter and Wade had properly buckled themselves in. He went to reach for his own seat belt as he turned around, then frowned when something caught his attention in the side mirror. A horrid yellow suit, and something pointed at their car. “Steve!” Tony shouted, turning to lunge for the backseat. “AIM!” The back of the SUV lifted up as a sonic blast hit the back tires, throwing Tony back and out his seat, colliding with the windshield. He groaned when the airbags were triggered, the one in the passenger side exploding to life against his back and pushing his head up into the already cracked glass. His glasses cracked and shifted further up, a piece of lens scraping along his forehead for a second before he moved. He felt himself tugged out, collapsing against the seat as the bags deflated.
"Not really?" Steve wrinkled his nose a little. "There was always something to do, another mission, another task, no real break. That's war. But here, it's not as urgent sometimes. Then there was this past summer, and it all ramped up, and then... nothing."
"He gives up the cube, he's all yours." He stared down Thor. "Until then," the face plate closed again, Iron Man looking at him now, "stay out of the way." Tony started to turn, scanning for Loki. Up on the ridge, still. "Tourist," Tony muttered under his breath.
For a surprise, I'll give you a sentence that I wrote in my fanfic notebook from the planning of this story:
"Now I'm tempted," Tony sing-songed. Steve spooned some rice onto the three plates, and Tony followed up with the chicken curry. Peter was coming out of his room as Steve put the first plate in the microwave, and Tony hugged the little boy, kissing the top of his head.
Tony landed and Steve tilted his head a little before the suit opened from behind and Tony stepped out. Steve smiled and wrapped his arms around him, kissing him. "Don't let go of me, or I'm going back inside of the suit," Tony said as he snuggled into Steve's chest. He had his own wool coat on, but Tony was never a fan of winter. "It's too damned cold here."
"He gets clingy," Tony practically whispered, sitting on the edge of Mary's bed as he held Peter. "I didn't think that he would want to sleep alone tonight, I probably should have warned you."
"You weren't actually thinking about doing that, were you?" Rachel asked, handing William a glass of punch.
"Yes, of course," Tony answered immediately. There was a blue glow in front of him and he opened his eyes.
“I don’t wanna hear anything about beauty products from you,” Bucky grumbled to him. “She’s easier to ask about this stuff than Tony is, and I know that Tony buys all the stuff that you use in the shower, so I can’t ask you. And I’m certainly not about to ask the other Avengers who would rather stab me with the body wash than help me buy it.”
Tony's eyes widened when she moved, his other arm coming up to wrap around little Peter, freezing up. He saw that Peter already had brown eyes, dark hair peeking out from beneath the little cap on his head. Mary's hand leaned over, putting the bottle in Tony's hand, helping him adjust his arms to feed Peter, then moving him to the loveseat. Peter's hand rested on Tony's finger and Tony felt a shiver run down his spine; followed by warmth.
The responses from the last chapter were astounding! Thank you guys, I'm Sooooo happy that you all liked it. I was actually incredibly nervous about that last chapter. That won't be the last we see of a chapter like that, but now my confidence is boosted for that. Yay! I know I say it all the time, but that's cause it's true; You guys are awesome!
"Steve's a big boy, he can take care of himself," she told him. "He's had over a year to start to get used to things. And he would be a very good ally to have with Peter. You already know that Mary trusts him."
“But the pancakes are divine, Mary,” Steve said, turning big blue eyes in her direction. “I look forward to these at every birthday.”
"Tony showed me Howard's office," Steve said after a moment, thinking about how he had wanted to start the conversation. Bruce raised an eyebrow faintly. "He, uh, he told me about how Howard kept looking for me, and that he had, funded your research?"
Okay, here is some promised good times, inside the chapter, somewhere. :) Don't worry, I'll make up for all the pain I put the boys through! I can't make the same promises for the pain that I put you wonderful readers through..... Sorry? <3
Tony was fidgety. The bad feeling that kept him up at night was only increasing, which made no sense. He had finally cracked the last file, and found a list of coordinates. Jarvis was running them and sending them on to Steve and Natasha. He hadn't heard from Steve in over a day though, and while that wasn't unlike him, he had told Tony that he would call.
He didn’t very often drive south enough to go through Greenwich Village, preferring to take one of the earlier bridges when he drove to Queens to visit Mary and Peter when they lived over there. When he knew what he was looking for, finding the townhouse that Doctor Stephen Strange lived in wasn’t all that hard. Tony was aware, had been told, that Strange made sure that no one really looked at it unless he wanted them too, said it was some kind of glamour, or something, that he cast about the building. Tony didn’t know what he did, but he would find a scientific explanation one day.
Pepper tilted her head a little, looking at Tony. “You’re naming them after gemstones?” He nodded a little, never taking his eyes off of the moving eggs. “I think it’s sweet,” she told him with a smile. “Tell me the others.”
"So were the grandparents," Coulson told him. "We caught them as they were trying to escape, or rather the Winter Soldier caught them. We can only assume they were going to take the twins to another base. We have them in custody right now."
“I was gone, I have no control over him, or her,” Steve started saying as he walked, Bucky falling in step besides him. “I wasn’t even in the country, I have no knowledge of destruction that did or did not happen.”
"Give me a second," she said while holding up a finger. She took a breath and nodded. "I can hear the lingering, 'but'."
"Ugh, Steven," Tony groaned out, pressing his face into his pillow that Steve's head was starting to steal. "That was almost six months ago. You are allowed to splurge and get a haircut more than once a year. You could even lighten your hair too, just a little, right at the top. It would be completely natural looking." He tilted his head so their faces were a couple inches apart. "You know I'm stalling until you feel more comfortable, right?"
“I can’t really blame her,” Tony commented, setting his tablet down on the bedside table. “The treatments aren’t making much of a difference, so she probably wants to make sure that everything will be in line, when the, uh, inevitable happens.”
Tony nodded at Bruce. "That's just the prototype." Tony looked back over at Steve. "I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now."
He took a breath and looked back at Tony. “Doesn’t help that everyone knows we’re together now, almost like projecting our weaknesses.” Steve crossed his arms over his chest. “I’m sorry for putting Peter in possible danger,” he said quietly.
Something had been bothering Tony for the past few days, and Steve was trying to get a couple of free days so that he could come back to the Tower to check up on him in person. It had been over a month since they had last seen each other in person, and Steve missed him something terrible.
“Betrayed!” Wade wailed, his voice carrying through the stairwell, Steve trying to hide his wince. “You’ll take the little one, but you won’t take one of
Peter fell asleep in Tony's arms later that night, and Tony didn't care. He'd hold his son forever. He and Mary had managed to change Peter into his pajamas without Tony having to let go of him, and now Mary was sitting on the couch in her own night clothes, a mug of tea in her hands.
"Really?" Steve noticed that the Doctor had a wry smile on his face. "They want me in a submerged pressurized metal container?"
"-and I asked if it would help, and if it would be okay, if maybe Peter spent the night here." Tony finished, like Rhodey hadn't said anything. "And you Pooh Bear, don't have to be back to base until tomorrow night."
Tony put his hands up, taking a couple steps back. "You know what, I'm out. This is something I no longer want a part of. Today is a long awaited day off, and I plan on spending lots of time with my son" He turned, heading for the exit. "I'm no longer involved in whatever you two will talk about, but Loki," he turned his head to look at the man in question, "you try any shit again, and you won't have to worry being innocent or not."
I promise, I'm being nicer to them now! I'm starting to take things and make them right, wrap up some loose ends for the boys. I'm making them happy again! You'll see! There's gonna be some feels in this chapter, specially towards the end. Just remember, happy good times are coming soon! :D
“Projected completion is eighteen days, Sir,” Jarvis told him and Tony sighed. Eight months was a long time frame, and Jarvis could only move so fast if they were looking for a facial match, and that was in the US alone.
Steve nudged Tony's shoulder towards the exit, Jamie's head laying down on his own shoulder now. "I don't know what's going on anymore," Tony moaned a bit, rubbing his face when they were out in the hallway. "Jarvis?"
"Because, I'd like to come over, and talk about this without someone from the company there." Mary looked at the paper, then back up at him, but he was looking forward at the elevator doors as they moved down to the first floor. "So, uh, what is his name?"
"Sorry to interrupt, but the cafeteria's open, and I promised Peter pancakes," Coulson said, causing Peter to move a little. He still hadn't fallen asleep.
“Of course, Sir,” the AI responded form the phone. Tony set the phone down on a bench along the path, then set Jamie down to sit next to the phone.
Tony jerked, but both he and Loki blinked when nothing happened. Loki's narrowed his eyes at him, then tried again, trying to take control of Tony. "Your heart-"
Also, I did not expect for some many people to like this story, I'm so flattered, and honored! I hope I can keep up the expectations.
“Of course,” she nodded. “I’ll tell you everything, but I’m just not sure where she is at all. Not too long Emil died, but before I knew I was pregnant, she went to Europe. Wanted to travel like she did in college, I don’t know.” Tony glanced at Steve. “She’d send the occasional post card, a phone call when she was able, too.”
"He probably did it to her, and got accidentally smacked when it scared the crap out of her," Steve replied. Tony could see the faint outline of Steve washing up, washing his hair first. "So now he does it to us, because he and Peter probably think it's freaking hilarious."
"He obviously listens to you, and I'm starting to get creeped out," Tony told her quickly. Bucky hadn't moved a muscle since the last time he spoke. "He obviously looking your way, probably waiting for a command."
"It would be my pleasure, Mrs Parker." The AI's reply had Steve tilting his head a little. When Mary opened the door to Peter's room Steve could see that it was dark, but there were lights that seemed to be moving across the floor. When he leaned in a little he saw that they were actually moving across the ceiling. Mary pat peter's back and he crawled into bed, letting his Mama tuck him in with his stuffed animal.
"Who's going to watch them during the meeting?" Tony would often tell Peter some of the safer, non-explicit, details about their Avenger call-outs, but it didn't mean he'd ever take him to a meeting. He didn't want to scar the boy.
Footsteps coming down the hall brought Tony's from his thoughts and he saw the three SHIELD Agents coming towards him. Barton was looking better than he had seen him during the battle, but he looked more troubled. Vaguely Tony remembered that Barton had been the one to shoot Mary in her leg. Steve directed Romanoff and Barton to Mary's door. Romanoff gave the archer a look, both having a conversation in seconds, before he went in the room alone.
"You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight." Tony raised an eyebrow. "Can I at least get a reaction from you?"
Tony looked at Steve as he spoke, a little taken aback if he were honest with himself, and he saw the fire in Steve's eyes, but it was a good thing. But then he saw something else, and it really hit Tony then, Steve was still young, like really young. He had gone into the war barely over Twenty, and that was all he had known after that. Steve was still stuck in a Twenty-Six year old body, never really having grown up, had fun, done everything he should have been doing in his Twenties.
Tony closed his eyes and let their hands move with the Steve's breathing, focusing on it. It took a few minutes, but Tony felt like he could breathe again. His head felt a little foggy, but it was starting to clear up. There was no more blue, but he was still feeling pain. When he opened his eyes again he could see Steve clearly, watching him, concern all over his face. Tony was indeed down in his workshop, he could see that now. He saw his hand on Steve's chest, felt the warmth of Steve's hand on top of his, and he tried to jerk it back. Steve kept a grip on Tony's hand, not letting him move.
"Yup," he nodded, then looked past Steve for a second. "They didn't want to wake you up, so I said I'd do it when I got up here."
Steve snorted and rolled off Tony and brought his legs underneath him, seated right in front of the,
"They played you as a puppet," Steve said gently. "Pulled all your strings. And she's right, you can't take all that blame. They tortured you, Buck. For Seventy years, they tortured you, and tried to make you forget, and for fuck's sake, they froze you." Bucky looked at him, watching Steve lose his calm exterior but keeping his voice down. "But, they underestimated you. They did big time. You didn't forget, not really, you never really lost who you were. If you had, you wouldn't be standing here in front of me, wouldn't be in this Tower. They had to keep trying to make you forget, because you just wouldn't submit, not all the way."
"Sounds too Dominatrix," Tony said, reaching for the tablet that was on the bedside stand. "Jarvis prefers Lady as a proper title. I made him too stuffily British."
Tony threw himself into the reconstruction of the Tower. All of his Gems, (Pepper said was easier to refer to them as a group sometimes, instead of by every name), missed Vee, and they were worried about Tony, but they were unable to pull him out of his head. He didn’t ignore them, not by a long shot. They were his family, they were like his kids, but it was obvious that when Vee went back with Steve, it had affected Tony.
Tony raised an eyebrow when he looked at Wade’s face. “Is that a bruise on your cheek, Wade?” He missed Mary shaking her head at him as Steve turned around to walk closer.
While Tony was in the shower, he wondered what he could do with Peter. It gave him the time he needed to calm down, enough so that hopefully Peter wouldn't be able to see that something was wrong. The last thing he wanted to do was scare Peter in any way, in case he was still angry.
Steve hadn't heard a word of what Fury was saying, he was looking at Stark. Tony wasn't looking at anyone, staring at the floor, at his hands, that even after everything, were still moving. The man was done, but he wasn't out yet. Steve wished he knew what had come over him back in the lab, why he had what he did to Tony. Steve knew that Tony always put Peter first, that he would always protect that boy.
"You think I'm not?" Tony moved towards him. Bruce hunched back over the scepter, focusing on his research. Tony had gotten the Gamma calculation running already. Forget the week that Bruce had said he would need, Tony got the search running, and it would be done within the next couple hours. "Why did Fury call us in, and why now? Why not before?" Before Mary got hurt. "What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables."
Steve's fingers slid up into his hair, tightening, gripping to make sure that he didn't lose Tony. His other hand tightened in Tony's shirt against his back, the fabric sliding against Tony's skin. He could even feel the slight bristle of short hair from Steve's cheeks from where he hadn't shaved yet brushing against Tony's cheek. The coarseness bring a tiny raw burn on the beard free skin.
“We can bribe her with ice cream,” Tony said as he started to life the girl up and into his arms. She let out a whine, one that Steve says Tony taught her, and he kissed the top of her head.
"Your work with the tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies," Thor said looking at Fury. "It is a signal to all the realms that earth is ready for a high form of war."
Tony ran up two flights of stairs before he thought he saw sunlight. "Oh, this is gonna hurt my eyes. Hang on." Reaching down he pulled a piece of fabric up and out to be a cover over the baby's eyes, but not lay over her face. "Listen, usually I'd say, make your displeasure known, wail away if the sun hurts, but that would be really counter-intuitive to escape." An explosion rocked the floor under Tony's feet, and he instantly curled his body over hers. "He's close, that's for sure." Tony checked to make sure the leather journal and vials were still tucked in some folds of the fabric, before reaching out for the door.
“No, I imagine you don’t. I don’t think the Colonel was in a very good mood when I dropped off his son with him.” Steve was up, pushing the chair back with how fast he moved. “There was a chance that this plan wouldn’t actually work, I was prepared for that. Don’t worry, Captain, we’ll meet again.”
Tony felt like someone had punched him in the gut again, all the air rushing out of his lungs. How could he have forgotten? His body didn't want to follow what his brain was screaming, saying that he need to get more air into his body. Voices were saying something, but it was all fuzzy, like he was underwater. He slipped from seat, but suddenly Natasha was in front of him, hands on his cheeks, and her mouth was moving, but he couldn't make out her words.
"As long as they can get a stable version of the serum to work on human DNA," Bruce interjected. "They barely had something stable with the animals."
"Some people just aren't meant to be parents," Tony said, and he saw the frown deepen on Steve's face, his blue eyes becoming cloudier. This was really bothering the man. "It's why I was very careful, well, until I met Mary. Probably a good thing I don't drink as often anymore."
"The only thing you really fight for is yourself," Steve growled. "You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on the wire and let the other guy crawl over you. Let someone else handle the dirty work, let someone else take care of your child."
"You keep a picture of your kid at your desk, Tony," Bruce said, looking at him over his glasses. "You've got it bad, you've got fatherhood."
Steve watched him for a couple minutes. "Are you hiding your nerves? I thought people were still supposed to be nervous at their weddings." Coulson looked at Steve. "This is why I refuse to play poker with you, you know that right?"
“Peter? Wade?” He called out as he pulled himself up, swallowing when his stomach roiled. Definitely a concussion.
"What is going on Tony?" Pepper's voice assaulted Steve's ears almost immediately. "I can't control the press as it is, but who is this clown? Did he not sign an NDA?"
Steve nodded, pressing a finger to his ear put the ear piece into sleep mode. His eyes ticked up suddenly when he noticed that there was a sliver of light coming from the hallway, past the door. That had been closed just a few seconds ago. He straightened, his whole body on alert, only to be slammed back against the wall, a metal hand at his neck.
"I know, and I have to meet Thor sometime. It's not every day that you find out that there is an actual personification of the Gods of your religion." Tony raised both eyebrows at her. "Steve told me not to talk to you about religion. Unless it had something to do with Supernatural."
Fury grumbled and cut the line, but a few seconds later there was the ping of a new message. Tony grabbed his tablet and brought up the information, scanning through it. "Petey, continue your homework, I gotta grab something from the workshop."
"Oo, appealing to my superior future knowledge," Tony pointed his mug at Steve in lieu of a finger. "You're sly, Rogers, well played." He laughed when Steve seemed to preen a little. "Here's the deal, I'm going to get working on setting up the details for Peter's party, and if I get started now then I'll be back with plenty of time before dinner."
spy. His secrets have secrets. It's bugging him too, isn't it?" He looked over at Bruce, who wanted nothing more than to not be involved in this awkward conversation.
Tony’s eyes were fluttering and Steve reached out to pull him closer, freezing when Tony gasped, almost keening in pain. “Tony?” He turned his head when the room became a little quieter, Bruce leaving the room with Jamie. He could still hear her soft cries in the hallway and he teared up a little as he looked back at Tony.
"-to know there was someone there? You said that he wasn't Hydra." That was Meg. He inched in slowly.
"Because no one else went through what I did," Tony bit out. "I can't close my eyes for five minutes without being gripped by fear, and I would never want someone to know even an inkling of what I went through, because that would wreck their lives." He closed his eyes tightly, seeing the spark of white flash with the darkness, putting too much pressure on his eyelids. "No one else was there! I can't-"
Steve watched Tony, watched his smile that seemed just a little bit brighter, and watched him interacting with Peter in his arms. He wouldn't deny that he was a bit worried about the reaction from everyone, but Peter in particular, about him and Tony dating. Tony hadn't wanted to say anything unless they were serious, and Steve didn't want to make things awkward. But when Tony had easily said that they were dating, Steve felt a little lighter inside, warmer, happier.
Steve glanced back one last time as he closed the oven, telling himself that he was not looking at Tony's butt, his well shaped, perfect size for his hands, ass. Nope.
“And your boots, and belt,” Tony told him, grabbing the accessories. Steve gave Jamie a little tickle as he straightened the hood on her head, then started pulling his boots on as Tony helped Peter. “The belt is the most important part, remember?” Tony reached down and pulled a bag out from under the bed. He motioned for Steve to stand up and stand by Peter as he reached into the bag. “Because, the belt holds all the most important things. My belts,” he motioned to the various belts and holsters still on the bed, “hold my blasters and tools, of course. But, for Jedi’s, the belt is the best place for-“
Mary shook her head. "He did travel to Afghanistan several years ago," Mary whispered back quickly. "Something did happen over there." She wasn't sure how much to tell him, it was Tony's experience to tell. Steve just nodded, he could work with that.
Peter and Wade shared a look, then grinned, and suddenly they were moving their arms, jumping on Steve. His eyes widened as the boys launched their surprise attack, but within seconds they were gone, running towards the pool room, giggling. Steve had floaties around his wrists and ankles, and there was a small inner-tube around his neck.
"You gonna admire the wrapping paper all day, or open it?" Steve heard Tony say, closing the wooden door behind him. The blonde blinked a little, then pulled the paper off, Peter reaching up to take it to throw away, and Steve found himself looking at dark stained, thin wooden box. He opened it and saw a black pen inside, sleek and modern looking.
Tony was looking at his tablet as they rode back to the Tower from the airport. Pepper had given him strict instructions that he needed to get back to his actual job with SI now that vacation was over. So he picked the first thing that looked like it wouldn’t give him a headache. Peter was eagerly looking out the window, watching as they got closer, and Jamie was content in her car seat, still feeling sleepy from the afternoon flight. Tony nudged Steve’s arms and leaned over to show him the tablet.
“Look Jamie! It’s Papa!” Peter hold onto Jamie’s hands as he pulled her into his lap, turning her around.
“I don’t think you can blame the lessons on this one,” Meg said, leaning back against the counter. “He jumped over the couch, rolled across the floor-“
"No, you're not," Tony said and Peter looked up at him. "But you don't need all of it like you used, too." Peter's features scrunched up in a mix of anger and confusion. "You're growing up so fast, and I'm gonna sound like the sappy Dad here, but it's true. You're really smart, and you're able to do a lot without my help, or Mama's help, anymore. Do you like when we hover over your homework?"
"You are my brave little boy," Mary whispered to him. "My very brave boy, just like Captain America."
“Yup, reminded, now what the hell was that!” Tony growled out a little as he flew lower to see where the metal ball had disappeared too. It hadn’t landed on the ground, there were no screaming bystanders, no smoke, or horns honking outside of regular traffic, and no metal ball. There was another impact above him, and another vibration, and when he looked out he saw another ball, but this was bigger. Tony shot out of the way as it fell past him, barely missing hitting him dead on.
Steve's head shot up, looking over at Tony, his eyes were open, wide, and pupils blown, the arc reactor springing to life, glowing brightly, and Steve grinned.
"What can you tell us about the attack?" A male voice asked. "And what about those that fought with you?"
"He's takes on much more than he should," Bruce said quietly, starting to clean up the dishes, setting most of them in the dishwasher.
“You think I don’t have help?” Mary said, looking at him with a smile in her eyes. She was amused by this. “Having Phil around to help? Having Steve in the same building to help? When we were in California, my parents were there all the time to help me. No parent is perfect, but what makes a parent worthy of their title, worthy of the love of their child, is that they try, really try.” She rested a hand on Tony’s cheek. “It’s okay that you freaked out, that you still do, and that you thought that you might not be able to take over the primary role right away. What counts is that you didn’t give up, though. You tackled it head first, just like you do with everything when it comes to Peter, and you aren’t stopping.”
Tony’s faceplate dropped and Jarvis brought up something on the HUD, Steve’s voice washing out a bit. “Sir, I’ve detected an impact on the window surface of the eighty-third floor.” Tony frowned, watching the security footage pop up. He could just catch something hit the window, then bounce off, like someone had thrown a rock. Jarvis sped up the footage to play live and they saw something hit again.
"Ah, no, that's alright, but thank you." Steve took a seat at the same stool he had sat at for breakfast. "I was wondering if I could talk to you? About Tony?" The kettle started to whistle and Bruce turned the heat off, pouring the water into the cup, letting the tea steep. He walked over and took a seat across from Steve.
"We did it, we won." He looked at Tony, a little smiled. Tony let out a breath, looking visibly relieved. Then Steve punched his armored arm and Tony looked at him with wide, surprised eyes. "Don't tell me to take care of him again!"
"We can buy you the time," Steve said, and Tony nodded, agreeing. They'd give them all the time in the world.
"Nope," Mary said shaking her head, merging into bridge traffic. "At the moment, no one else knows that you're back."
The phone started to play a song suddenly, and Meg's hands shot up and over her head, hands out in a surrender gesture. "I didn't do it! I also didn't play that song." She leaned back in, looking at the phone. "Although, admittedly, The White Stripes is a pretty good band."
Unbeta'd as usual, Marvel owns more than me, and the songs are property of their respective artists/movies.
They had gotten Steve? Tony blinked, and realized that his eyes weren't open. Steve was over him, holding onto his arms, keeping him from falling off the bed, not restraining him. Tony tried to pull away quickly, almost slipping off the bed again, his head headed straight for the corner of the bedside table, and Steve pulled him back up into his chest. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's body, and he froze.
"Nothing horrible is going to happen," Tony assured her, not looking up from his phone. "Everything's been cleared with Wade's Mom, all lights are green. It'll be amazing." Mary raised an eyebrow at him. "I can feel your judging, it's very judgey. Distracting even."
"Well, I've got the Expo coming up," Tony said with a little one armed shrug. "It's not going to be ready by the time I wanted it to be, but that's alright. It's still going to take a lot of effort. And I've got this new project, where I am going to be involved in almost every detail."
Tony flopped on the bed of Steve's room and hummed happily. "You did alright, Stevie." He propped himself up on his elbows to watch Steve hang their coats up. "First time booking an adult hotel, and you picked a very nice room." They had managed to make it to the hotel before the storm got too bad, and the city had put out a travel advisory. Tony's suit was in the back of the SUV that Steve had rented, and Tony was glad that he had been experimenting with lighter alloys.
Meg was closing the front door with her foot when Tony opened the door to her bedroom. "What are you doing?"
"Sir, the time is currently Seven am," Jarvis said several hours later, jolting Tony from his reading for a pancake recipe. "I believe that if you are to make breakfast before young Master Peter awakens, you should head up now to prepare."
“Oh, I gave Howard quite the dressing down when we found out. There might not have been much he could have done, but I don’t believe that he tried hard enough. The poor dears were broken hearted.” Peggy gently rubbed Vee’s head. “I was so happy when Vee took to little Tony, giving her a reason to wait for you.”
"You know it was not me inside of your mind." Loki leaned back against the wall, watching Tony now. "Was not my voice that you heard. But, you did what I could not, you fought."
Steve had been right, he always felt better after spending some one-on-one time with Peter. This was his little boy, his son, one person calming army. He had to keep a little bit of optimism that the next call they got would be good news about Rachel. Or news about who was behind the attack.
Updates to me? Well, I am no longer homeless, Yaaaaay! I've moved to an apartment, and I live with my mom as her caretaker, and working part-time. I work at a pizza place and I love it, and I even got part-time Manager in less than a year. So it makes me a bit  busy, but I also didn't want to start the next chapter of this series until I knew what I was doing, and could make it just as good as the rest that everyone loves. I'm still super grateful to everyone who's read this series, and left a review/comment! Seriously, you all still blew me away with all the stats that I see, with all your kind words! I do this all for you guys!! Thank you!!
"No promises!" Tony said with a sweet smile that had Mary rolling her eyes. "Have a good day at work sweetheart!" He waved as Mary stepped into the elevator, answering her phone.
"It's big now," Peter replied sleepily. The boy was exhausted, but now he couldn't fall back asleep.
Tony wanted to call them, wanted to hear their voices, but he had purposely not turned the service back on, knowing that he would be bombarded. He had nearly cried when Rhodey had handed him back his phone back in Afghanistan. They had found it in the sand, not far from where Tony had been injured, and Tony had been afraid that he had lost some of his favorite pictures of Peter, the ones that he didn't have Jarvis save, just in case.
“They’re still in classes, and spending the night with Mary,” Tony said with a grin. “It’s just going to be the three of us tonight. I say let’s go out for lunch and ice cream.”
"Thank you, Coulson," she smiled at him, kissing his cheek. They both stopped, blinking a bit at the action. "For a lot, last night, and today." She hurried through, sure that her cheeks were blushing a little. Coulson nodded a little, and pat her arm, ruffling Peter's hair a little, and slid out of the limo.
"I know we always said that when this moment came, we'd figure it out together, and that hopefully it would be because Peter was graduating High School or College, and that it would be because I couldn't hold myself back from spoiling him with presents." Tony let out a little sigh. "I messed up, as per usual. But I'm working on, kind of fixing it. This is gonna suck, and it's gonna be hard, and I'm going to be apologizing to Peter for years to come..." He trailed off. "There is no but to that. The upside is hard to find in this one." Tony reached up to push a piece of hair off of forehead.
Steve's mouth opened a little. He remembered. The Asgardian brothers had called someone down, to go through Tony and Loki's memories, and he had seen both of them. He had never spoken to Tony about them, because they had even put a chill of dread down Steve's spine. He had seen what the scepter had done to Tony before he was forced to fight him, and he had seen, through Tony's eyes, what it was like going through the wormhole. Worst, he had heard the voice. He thought that he had it bad with the Red Skull's voice being stuck in his head, this one somehow almost sounded like death.
"I want to study every line, every curve, every divot of your body," Steve whispered against his ear. Tony swallowed roughly and felt his whole body move from the heat behind those words.
“You bet,” Steve said with a smile. “It’s a holiday after all.” Peter grinned and pulled out a chair, wanting Steve to sit there. He then pulled a chair away from the table for Mary, and she leaned over to kiss his head as she slid into the spot. “Looks like you know where everyone is supposed to sit,” Steve said with a chuckle.
Tony just listened to Steve’s voice rumble through his chest, listened to his heart beat, just for a few moments. “I don’t have too,” Tony said then, causing Steve to look down at him. “To keep dealing with all the bullshit. I could step away completely from Stark Industries, without having to sell it, and do nothing for the rest of my days. I could focus completely on Peter, Jamie, and you, and not have to give up anything of my lifestyle. I could ‘downgrade’, and still be happy.”
"Great, won't need anything though," Tony said. "Because it's been over five years, I think I know how-"
“I’ll allow it,” Coulson said with a nod. Sam and Rhodey walked over to the other side to grab some water, and Steve and Bucky went over towards Tony. He tossed them both some towels to wipe their sweat.
"So, I don't care if Peter wants to stay home for the weekend, but I don't know what your plans are," Mary changed the subject, and Tony swore he heard the little laugh she was trying to keep silent.
"I wasn't asking you." Barton reached out with his other hand, grabbing her arm and used his forward momentum to slide her backwards, sliding his foot behind hers to force her down to the ground. The other Agent with them moved Loki and Dr Selvig forward, towards the trucks. Flipping from her back to her hands, Mary jumped up, then shouted when Barton let off a single shot, a bullet slicing through her calf.
"And get the angry, pregnant lady out of here and into her new house?" Tony leaned back as Steve's hand flailed out to try and smack his arm.
Jamie was trying to take the spoon from Steve’s hand as she saw the applesauce. He relented and held the container as close to her as possible where she could still reach it. “Her dexterity with utensils is get a lot better,” Tony said as he observed her mostly succeeding in feeding herself.
"I'm sure it'd be like candy land for him," Steve said. "He's still at the hospital with Peter, but he should be back soon. He called a little bit ago and said that Rachel's looking really good. They were going to stay with her for a bit to let Coulson and Mary get a little time to get out of the hospital."
"Get me in a suit and I'll be fine." Tony used Steve to push himself up carefully. They both turned to look outside, finally taking stock of what was actually going on. "Can't afford to have me sit this one out, Cap," Tony said carefully as they watched the invasion outside.
Pepper was supposed to come over to bring him the paperwork to sign for the Stark Expo, and his latest idea, so it could be delivered to the Board for approval. He could not look, or feel, like this when she got here. She'd rat him out to Mary, and she'd be over here to check on him, and if he was contagious he didn't want Peter to get sick because Mary had caught whatever he did. Tony was sure that wasn't what was happening, that would be too simple.
"I'm sure she'll be much happier once she has her children in her sights," William predicted as the doors opened to his and Rachel's floor. "Good luck, Tony."
"Tony," Mary's voice came through, and Jarvis unmuted the other lines, the two voices falling silent now. "We've got problems."
"Bucky?" Steve called quietly, standing a bit straighter as he stepped inside the apartment. The talking stopped as he headed for the living room. There was shuffling, then a grunt, and he saw that Meg had her hands on Bucky's hands, keeping him on the couch. He looked like he wanted nothing more than to run away, all with a glower on his face.
He had a certain one-eyed director to find now. After several minutes, he saw Maria Hill walked away down a hallway and he decided to follow her; where there was a Hill, there was usually a Fury.
"This is a truly horrendous tie for cameras, Tony," Pepper said a little fondly. Tony shot her a grin.
"I was actually wondering if something was wrong with this vehicle," Steve admitted. "It's very quiet."
It's here! The end! What a ride, for them and for all of us!  I'm ready to get out of the year 2012 though, that's for sure!
Pulling back the covers, Tony gently pulled Peter off of him, laying him down in the middle of the bed. Tony took off his jacket, and shoes, then slid in the bed beside him, pulling the comforter over them, and Peter instantly cuddled back up to Tony, his little hand now over the arc reactor, snuggling against Tony's chest. Tony kissed the top of Peter's head, and wrapped an arm around him. He had no intentions of going anywhere, of leaving Peter ever again.
"A month??" Tony exclaimed. "And in the meantime that just gives them another month to keep working on their experiments, possibly torturing people with their unstable science!"
"We'll be talking later," she told him quietly. "Go with him, help him out and we'll get what he'll need for the night." She pat his cheek and pulled away. "You'll have to go out tomorrow to get more stuff, preferably in the morning before Peter gets back."
"Because I needed you," Loki said simply and Tony ground his jaw a little. "I would have used you for one purpose or another, but Barton had told me enough to deduce that the quickest way to get your attention would be through your son. I would not had hurt the boy-"
Pepper was suddenly pressing a finger to her ear. "Tony! Tony, are you okay?" She was talking to Tony, he was still alive then. Mary was rubbing Peter's back as they talked. "Obidiah, he's gone insane! He built a suit, and-"
"You're not going to go inside?" Steve didn't believe that Tony was just going to walk away without checking on her. Tony didn't stop though, heading back down the hall, disappearing through a doorway. Steve was about to follow before the British voice stopped him, this time intoning from the ceiling.
“Happy Birthday, Cap,” Rhodey said in greeting, and Steve smiled as he wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders.
“I love you, too,” Tony murmured back, squeezing his hand. There was a moment of silence and then Tony let out a little groan. Steve turned his head slightly to look over at him. “That was such a domestic moment. I have to get you that house now, don’t I? And a ring. We’re all but married at this point.” Steve couldn’t help but smirk a little at his rambling, looking back down at his phone, still holding Tony’s hand. “We dated, then we had second kid, then we moved in with each other. I don’t even know what kind of order that is. And how you put up with me and my crazy rambling, I’ll never understand.”
“Doctor,” Steve greeted, crossing his arms in front of his chest a little. “We weren’t exactly expecting you to show up this soon, not today at least.” He heard Tony trying to hold back a snort, then the sound of Tony’s glasses hitting a side table as he pulled them off.
“The good movies,” Peter said confidently. “Annnnnnd, characters that can be found here, so he can get a picture with them.”
Tony knew what Steve was feeling. He would dream about the cave if he got too hot. Jarvis would drop the temperature of his bedrooms to nearly freezing when that would happen, just for a few hours, until Tony could regulate. Tony knew what he had to do.
Tony hugged him back, smiling. "That's a Peter hug! This is one of the best hugs in the universe." Peter reached over Tony's arms, his own arms out, looking at Steve expectantly. "You are being offered something here, Cap, something that no amount of my considerable fortune will ever be able to buy." Steve chuckled and leaned in close to let Peter wrap his arms around his neck in a hug, hugging him back even though Tony didn't want to let the boy go. Steve tugged gently on Peter, and Tony stumbled a little. He turned his head to look at Steve, putting on an exaggerated look of shock.
"You want the man who won't come within three feet of a baby, to babysit?" She asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Yeah," Peter nodded, taking a biscuit from the plate that Tony put in front of him. "Daddy took Wade and me to the park, then he let us get ice cream."
"How can adding songs be erratic?" Tony asked, but grabbed his tablet to pull up the playlist. He scrolled down to the new songs, watching another song being added as it refreshed. "Ew, he added his own theme song? And Coldplay? Who introduced him to them?? You were right, Jarvis, this is a travesty."
Reaching where he thought the suit had gone done he saw a crater dipping behind some crushed cars. Steve vaulted over one of the cars and slid down the side of the crater, then gasped when ice cold water splashed up his legs. He reached up to grab the edge and his hand slid down, and when he turned his head back he saw ice instead of dirt and concrete.
“Here’s the beauty!” Tony picked up Jamie, raising up to make her giggle and kissing her cheeks, before cradling her in his arm. With his free hand he plucked at her red cape, lifting it up, then pulling some red fabric out. After a little maneuvering, Jamie was settled against his chest. “There are some built in straps in her outfit that go over the shoulders, and tie around our waists. No need to keep switching the Mobi wrap out, because this once, she comes with her own carrying system.”
“Oh good, at least you’re setting a good example- Where did your other sock go??” Steve blinked, unsure of how she was able to get the other sock off without him noticing. “This has to be a super power.”
Making sure that the nightlight was on, Tony left the room, leaving the door open a crack with the hallway nightlight on. Tony ruffled his hair and headed back for the living room, Bruce still in his chair, but this time with his own tablet out while Tony's was waiting for him on the coffee table, Peter's sketchbook next to it. He sat down on the edge of the couch and leaned forward to glance at the sketchbook page. Peter had been very carefully working on the page for about an hour, drawing slowly, with deliberate movements. Last time he had asked his son about a sketch, he had clammed up until the drawing was done, moving his body to cover it every time Tony tried to look at it. So now he just let Peter work on his art without interruption, knowing he would ask for help or opinions when he wanted it.
"Yeah, but I shouldn't have let it get that bad, I should have been there, watching for the signs, talking to you anyway." He let out a little sigh. "Okay, but, I'm here now. Not going anywhere, not even down to the workshop. Can I start off, though? Jamie adores you, and I know that's not saying much for someone so young, but it kind of is. She seeks you out, I've noticed this."
"It's not just a dance, though," Mary said, not unkindly. "You're you, Tony, everybody knows who you are, and how you are with women."
"Fuck." Tony dropped his forehead against Steve's shoulder, panting too hard now. "Clothes aren't even off, yet." His voice sounded rough, wrecked, when it had no right too, not yet anyway.
"Almost Petey," Tony told him, keeping the tears out of his voice. Peter was perceptive. "Mr Steve is probably gonna be closer to come get you out, okay? So when he's there, you listen to what he says. I'm stopping the bad guys, so no one will hurt you, or Mama, again. Okay?"
“We know what happened,” Steve said with a nod, agreeing with him. “There’s nothing else that Wade can tell us. I’ll check on them tomorrow.” Tony put a hand on Steve’s arm, giving him a small smile.
“You’re never going to let that go, are you?” Steve asked dryly, but Tony could see the hints of a smile in his expression. “Here I thought that I was living in a new century, not back on stage.”
"Peter won't be back until dinner time tomorrow, and I've got no alcohol in the penthouse." Tony held up the glass again before taking another drink. "It would just be a shame to let this leftover champagne go to waste."
"It's all ill-timed don't you think?" Tony turned his head to look at her. "Just after, whatever the hell we all went through, and I'm not exactly the most stable person in the world. There's a reason that I've been single for so long."
Tony choked on the air, unable to draw in breath, the voice sending a chill straight to his bones. There was a metallic glint from the roof across the street and when he looked up a pain blossomed in his chest. He gasped and felt himself falling forward this time, the pain radiating throughout his entire body. The streets of New York disappeared, an arm wrapped around his shoulder and under his arms. Tony felt his head being pushed and he started to trash.
"I don't have the same mental problems as you," Tony rasped out. He was still able to breathe as Loki held him, but it wasn't exactly easy. "No voices talking to me."
“Yeah,” Steve said with a little laugh. “It had to be this one.” He kept one around Jamie, his other snaking out to wrap around Tony’s waist. He saw Peter carefully hurry by, carrying a plate over to Bruce, and then run back to get more. Wade was right behind him, handing a plate to Sam, and doing the same. Steve leaned his head back a little, pressing a kiss to Tony’s neck. “I like this one, I’m going to keep him.” Tony wrinkled his nose, like he did every time he tried not to smile too widely. “Hopefully for a good long time.”
"The US Government kidnapped you?" Julie gasped in mock outrage and Tony couldn't help but laugh. "Trust me, Tony, you're not the only one that's been thinking about what happens, after."
"Steve should be home, maybe the three of you could have a guys night while you watch the opening?" Mary closed the folder. She put her thumb to a lower drawer of her desk, pressing the digit to the fingerprint scanner. The drawer popped open and she slid the folder to the bottom, then pulled out her badge and standard issue weapon.
It connected, but the man barely budged. He turned around, looked right at Tony, and Tony was already moving backwards. The man brought his arm up, and Tony dodged. He brought his other arm up and Tony moved to the other side, losing his footing. An electrified whip came down on the ground and Tony spread his legs, feeling heat uncomfortably close to body parts he really rather liked.
"Nope," Mary shook her head. "He's Mama's work friend, so not a stranger." Steve was glad to hear that this boy knew not to trust strangers, at least not without an adult around.
"You're not alone, Tony," Mary said from behind him, following him down the hall. Tony turned his head to look at her, then stopped where the hall opened up into the floor, looking at Steve. He could still feel it, still see their bodies, lifeless on that rock. How cold Steve was, watching the light die in his eyes, watching him die. "You don't have to do this alone."
The closer he got to the Tower, the more anxious Steve got. Mary was awake. It was enough to have him speeding through the streets on New York, and skidding into the private garage of the Tower, leaving tire marks on the cement. Steve jumped off of his back and jogged over to the elevator, pressing his hand to the scanner, and nearly falling in when the doors finally opened.
"I'd hope so," Tony scoffed a little. "This isn't some shoddily run spy organization." Steve huffed out a little laugh. "Yeah, this room is open all the time, so feel free to come here when you feel like working out. I can assume you've already found the gym?" Steve's cheeks suddenly turned a little red, and Tony's raised an eyebrow. "You broke the punching bags, didn't you?" His cheeks turned a deeper shade of red and Tony couldn't help but laugh. "Okay, don't get your panties in a twist, I was kind of expecting that. Jarvis is already making some different material that should stand up a little longer to your super strength."
Mary laughed and kissed his cheeks. "Hey there, baby. Did you have fun?" Tony walked over, wearing a matching hat, and t-shirt under his leather jacket, taking a seat across from Mary. There was a chocolate milk at the seat that was across from Coulson, and he assumed that was meant for Peter.
And then he went missing. The new Jarvis, the AI, had tried to hide the news from Vee for as long as he could. Until Pepper came over, eyes red with tears. Vee felt a horrible feeling of déjà vu, of waiting for Steve to come back. She feared that Tony never would, and she would spend more time inside of her pokeball again. This time she would fade away. Pepper never forced her back into her ball, and she always hid when Stane came over.
"Cause tomorrow is Daddy's birthday," Peter announced. Tony was studiously avoiding their eye contact.
“Good evening, Sir, Captain Rogers, Young Master Peter, Young Lady Jamie, and Miss Potts,” Jarvis said in the house, and Tony smiled. “It is a pleasure to welcome you back, for however short your visit may be.”
"Stark, I need you out there," Fury's voice came out through the speakers. "Some out of control experiments have broken free from a lab."
“They’re doing their best to make me feel old,” Tony whispered back, his voice clearing of the sleep it was laced with. “I’m already feeling the aches in my arm, and my hip thanks to Wade.”
"Can you count with me, Tony?" Tony frowned at the voice. "Can you count backwards from fifty with me?"
Tony slumped into the chair by his computer station, taking a few deep breaths, closing his eyes. He was starting to feel like this more often, and there had to be something happening, and now he needed to find out. What if it was genetic? What if it could have been passed down to Peter? He had to be prepared, to get on top-
And he was still there to help him a week later. The next Friday Tony finally felt like he was able to take a breath without the familiar stirrings of a cough. It was still there of course, but his lungs were looking much better, and he was able to leave the bed. Which seemed to be just in time.
"This is the third time I've done it, you'd think you'd be used to it," Wade argued, really not doing a great job at keeping the smile off of his face. Steve rubbed his face with his hands.
Unbeta'd, and Marvel owns more of this than I do. Also, all music/movies/tv shows belongs to those that wrote/performed/produced/etc them. I use them for humor and good times.
Steve's eyes had widened a little and Clint was maybe starting to look a little pale. "The animals from before were their first try?" The archer asked.
Tony turned around and ran, but a hand was already on his shoulder, turning him around and pressing his back to the wall. There was no defending himself from the assassin this time, not with the child in the middle. Cold blue eyes stared at Tony, but something seemed different about them this time. The black mask was still in place, but it didn't muffle his words when he spoke. "Did you make the Serum?" Tony didn't answer and the hand on his shoulder tightened. "Did you make it for them?"
"Wade, what are you doing in my room?" Tony asked with a soft sigh, turning his head to look at the older boy.
"He does, but when those two get worked up, Wade forgets, and Peter trusts Wade blindly, and really they're just having fun, and I can't really blame them-" Tony stopped and looked at Steve when Steve's bigger hand was place over his mouth, stopping his rambling.
Steve couldn't help but open one of his eyes part-way to look over at them. Tony was looking at Peter like there was nothing else in the world, but Steve could see that Tony's emotions were close to the surface. Now he couldn't stop thinking about Tony, about how he had grown up. He was an only child, but didn't he had many friends he could hang out with? Like Peter and Wade, or Steve and Bucky. Had Tony always lived alone? He certainly lived alone here in New York, Steve knew that much, but what about when he had been living in California?
“Howard,” Peggy hissed, sounding angry. “You had those balls locked up? For how long? Did you even try to open them?”
"We are," Bruce spoke up, and Tony smirked a little. This is why he and Bruce were best Science Bros. "The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature no. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile."
“Neither of the kids were in the video, and I’m sorry, did you see those moves?” Tony leaned back in his seat. “And the fact that Han Solo held his own with just a light saber-“
“Oh my girl, my precious girl,” Steve cried softly. Vee let out soft mewls in response. “I’m here, I’m here,” he repeated. “I’m back, I’m not going anywhere.”
Tony winced a little. There weren't as many reporters and paparazzi around the house when they did a drive by, before ducking into the underground parking, but they were still circling the house. "Yeah, those people will be going away soon. I hope. But if they manage to get near you at the house, then don't talk to them."
Tony nodded, slipping his phone into his pocket. "I'll be downstairs for a little bit. Jarvis can help you with anything you need." Tony started to walk away and Steve blinked.
"Well, since Pepper is gone, I have to be." The Airman smiled and headed upstairs to his own room, Tony following behind not long after.
"Keep this up, and you boys might have a future in fashion." Tony stood up, buttoning the first button his jacket. "I think we all look good enough to go visit the bride now, what do you think?"
I tried to be nice them all this chapter too, but I'm fluffing out man. Need to save for one more big fluff-travaganza. :D
“Ah-uh,” Steve hummed, smiling at him, moving Tony onto his back. “This is me treating you, remember?” He leaned down, kissing the corner of Tony’s mouth, then moved down to his jaw, trailing kisses across his skin. Steve moved, knees straddling Tony’s hips, and his hands pressed against Tony’s chest. He felt the hitch of Tony’s breath when he nipped the skin of his neck.
Peter, his son, his little boy. Tony sat up suddenly, moving to his feet. Where was- he heard the ringtone of his phone and snatched it up off the floor. The picture loaded almost instantly, and he let out a breath. Peter was asleep in his bed, face peaceful, on his side, hair a mess of loose curls.
"Your Mama is a smart woman," Coulson commented. His phone went off, and he ruffled Peter's hair as he transferred him to the couch next to Steve, grabbing his phone from the coffee table. He walked towards the kitchen, and Steve wondered if it was Mary, or SHIELD business.
All the pieces of the suit started to move, making sure that nothing scraped, everything locked together, worked how it needed to be. "Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics." The screen started to minimize itself, and Tony knew that soon the armor station would reappear. Nope.
“Who, me? Dramatic?” Steve rolled his eyes a little. “Says the man going to see his best friend, and try not to lecture him about teaching the boys to apparently do acrobatics.”
There was a knock on the door and Mary walked in after a second. Both Peter and Steve looked up, smiling at her. "Hi Mama."
"It's pressure sensitive," he explained. "I had Jarvis take readings when you were wailing on a punching bag last month, so I have some readings on how much force you can exert. When you go to pull the shield, and you reach a certain amount of force, the magnet automatically lets go." Tony held out the harness to Steve. "I would test it out on the jet on the jet on the way to your mission so you can get used to it. Technically anyone could pull it off, but not with a casual grab."
"Of course, Pete," Steve agreed easily. "And you and Daddy can pick out something for us to watch when I get back." He reached over for the tablet that was on the coffee table, Jarvis having paused the show they were watching before, not wanting the little boy to see any of the scarier elements after a bad dream. Peter eagerly took the tablet, turning and getting comfy on top of Tony. As Steve headed for the kitchen, he paused to look at the two of them on his couch. Peter had his back to Tony's chest, Tony's arms wrapped around the boy as little hands were gliding on the screen to find something to watch. Peter tucked his head under Tony's chin as Tony brought his knees up to properly cuddle the almost seven-year-old.
Bruce smiled at Tony, watching him go on about Peter. Tony stopped and looked at the other scientist. "What?"
"And what are you going to do?" Steve looked at him. He was probably feeling about as uncomfortable as Bucky was, even though this was something that he wanted to happen.
"And the uniform you wore a few days ago wasn't?" Tony smirked at him. "Cause if not, then I'm thinking I need to drop the red from my suit. Did you hear that J? We should have gone with that all gold design you showed me all those years ago."
The ride down was short, and they stopped at the main floor of the Penthouse, and Bucky stepped out first to lead the way. He stopped before they entered the large living room, and he made a sweeping motion with his arm. Steve stepped in, then stopped and tilted his head as a smile came over his features.
"They have a very distinct smell. And I love them." Tony looked smug as he crossed his arms over his chest. "Is that seriously all it takes?"
"Might as well put that fortune to use," Rachel fired back. Slowly, slowly to was starting to like him.
"I'm assigning you and Barton to making sure the guests make their way to their seats," Tony told Natasha. She shot him a glare, but Tony didn't seem to notice. "We're keeping this wedding low-key, and I think putting myself or Steve up at the front will draw attention from those that did not receive invitations. Also, you're like a bodyguard and beautiful greeter all in one." Tony flashed her a smile and she rolled her eyes a little.
"Come on, you're gonna go see your family, see my family. Get up." Tony was ready to do a fireman's carry if he had too.
"Mom!" Wade smiled and hurried in when he saw his mom in the bed. He quickly climbed up and let the woman pull him into a hug. Tony walked in and pushed the door closed before taking a seat in one of the plush chairs by the bed.
"SHIELD has that covered," Fury said, and now it was Tony's turn to frown. "You have your own problems to deal with."
"She's a curious one," Tony said with a smile as Steve adjusted her position. "I'll hold her while you get dressed, maybe take a quick shower. Mary is rustling up all the stuff you'll need, at least for tonight." Steve took a deep breath and nodded before they stepped onto his floor.
Tony bristled a little. "Of the people in this room, which one is, A, wearing a spangly outfit, and B, not of use?" Tony could give as good as he got.
Tony really didn’t mind. He had the two boys practically buried into his side and stomach on the couch, and he smiled when he smelled the pancakes before he saw them. Steve walked out to them with a tray in his hands. There were empty plates stacked up, with another plate loaded with blueberry pancakes, syrup, butter, and silverware. Steve was walking a little slower than usual, and Tony could see why when he looked down. Jamie was walking behind him, handing onto his pant legs as they walked so she could keep her balance.
"I should have guessed, though," she pressed, closing her eyes briefly. "I've never given it to him before, I have my own nut allergy. I should have gotten him tested for that when he was-"
"When you offer it up like that, how can a fella say no?" Steve snorted softly and moved his arm so that Tony could rearrange. He laid out along the seats, resting his head on Steve's thigh, then leaning it against his side. His eyes closed and he smiled softly when Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair a few times. "I missed you," he whispered, knowing that Steve would hear him.
"Talk to me, Tony," Steve breathed out, pressing his forehead to Tony's. He felt a tear against the thumb that he had on Tony's cheek.
"You need to stop surprising me with these visits, I'm going to expect them every couple weeks." Tony was hoping that Jarvis was taking pictures of this moment, Steve really did look good with a baby in his arms.
“Yeah, he has that, but so do I.” Steve pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s lips. “I’m not with him for his money, and I have no interest in taking over his business.” He kissed him again, lips lingering for a second longer. “He’s pretty good looking, too, but he’s got this personality that I’m drawn too. Oh, and he’s got this kid, he’s pretty damn adorable.” Tony let out a huff of air through his nose. “You know, actually, now that I think about it, I think it’s the kid. Yeah,” Steve nodded, looking off into the distance. “Sorry, I’m only with you because I like Peter better.”
Tony let go of Steve, turning on Loki, brought his hand back and launched a well place punch to Loki's jaw, sliding his arm in right past Thor. Loki let out a huff, stopping giggling, and just smirked a bit. "I believe that answers your questions, does it not?" Tony wound back, and punched Loki one more time.
"It's only until he's 18," Julie told him with a little smile. "Because we both know that you wouldn't be able to adopt him."
"I thought it was very smart of you to not play with us," Coulson commented. "I would start off slow if you wanted to get into poker, work on your poker face. I can teach Peter and Wade how to play Poker." Coulson's lips twitched up when Steve gave him a very unamused look. "I did skip breakfast though," he added and Steve raised an eyebrow. "I probably would have thrown it all up by now. I'm sure there will be very little food left after the reception."
"Four?" Tony asked, eyebrows up in curiosity. "Show 'em to me." A list appeared next to the playlist, and each song had initials next to them as to who assigned the song. M.R. were next to the seven most recent songs.
Mary laughed at his enthusiasm. "Why don't you go on inside and wash up, and change out of your play clothes. When you come back out, I'll have a bowl all ready for you, okay?" Peter was already off, running back to their apartment before Mary was even done talking.
"Adulting is hard." Which is apparently enough to make snort while taking a drink, but nothing coming out of his nose. Tony counts it as a win that he laughs after he's done coughing though. "We need to work on your humor receptors, because that wasn't that funny."
"You little-" Tony laughed, trying to grab onto his son before he ran over to join Wade in their dance around Steve. "I think it was a tie!"
"Just don't make me hunt you down again, and pull an emotional confession from you." Tony made a face and she chuckled.
“Alright. You’d better get over to and tell Mary that I said you could both have a corner piece, before she gives them awa-wah!” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve as the boys rushed past him, nearly knocking him over. “Okay, we know that bribery works especially well on the boys.” Steve chuckled a little. He lifted Jamie up so she could give a sloppy kiss to Tony. “Mmmmm, yes, now I feel much better!”
Tony gasped, coughing, falling to his knees, when he was pulled back out of the water just as quickly as he had been shoved under. His arms were shaking, trying to keep him up. A shadow passed over Tony and he looked up, falling backwards onto his back when he saw one of the Leviathans passing overhead. He saw the Chitauri mothership and suddenly he couldn't breathe again. He was weightless, the dark abyss of space around him, the portal back to Earth gone.
“No, of course not,” Tony agreed, slipping the vest on, but not doing up the buckles yet. He walked over to Steve and put his hands on Steve’s chest, running his hands up and down slowly over the white t-shirt. “The red cape with cover your butt for onlookers. I get the private view.” Steve’s cheeks pinked a little and Tony grinned. “You’ll be the only one not dressed up you know. Even Peter got a costume.”
Tony blinked a little, wondering if that was what it was like when he started to ramble. Peter seemed to be picking up more and more from him. “Uh, yeah,” he nodded a little. “He’s going with the ‘Papa’ term.” Tony was a little hesitant to tell him that, not sure how Peter would take it. It seemed that he was warming up to Jamie, slowly but surely, and Steve had obviously heard something when Peter was-
“Only time will tell. Do tell Margrit, and Sergeant Barnes that I said hello.” The call disconnected and Steve had to fight not to slam his fist down on the device. He looked back up at the screens and saw Hilda putting Wade in the backseat of a car, then actually making eye contact with the camera.
Rhodey had thought that he could leave the simple snack task to Tony, the brunette diving in after he easily decimated three pieces of pizza. But after an hour and a half, and Jarvis announced that Peter was showing signs of starting to wake up, he looked over and saw that Tony's hands were coated in peanut butter, a few raisins stuck to his fingers. There were about 6 completed pieces of celery snacks, though.
The fabric inside the container moved, and as Tony moved closer there was a cold knot forming in his chest. A soft whimper caught his attention first, and when Tony was made to look inside, he saw a baby, with blonde hair and blue eyes, staring back up at him. Inside he slammed against the control of his body.
Loki glanced up at him, the cuts and injuries he had endured, mostly from the Hulk, looking red, but starting to heal. "I wondered when you would come." Tony grit his jaw a little, but didn't move. "Did you feel him as well?" Tingles raced up Tony's spine at his words. "I had not expected the reaction when you were affected by the spear."
“It practically is,” Tony said as he stepped in and shut the door. “The living room has a fireplace and plenty of seating, and there’s a dining room there, and even a little bar and kitchen area. And then down there is the main bedroom with an attached bathroom, and right next to it is the second bedroom, and another bathroom. Plenty of room for us and the kids, with an awesome view of the park, if I do say so myself.”
"I was a little jealous," Steve admitted and Tony frowned. "Peter talks about you all the time, and I thought that I would never have that, never had a kid of my own talking about me like that to someone."
"You don't Touch my son," Tony hissed at him. "You're lucky I don't kill you now-" Tony was cut off by Loki's loud snort.
"Do all babies throw up like that?" Peter asked quietly. Tony took the towel back from Steve, wiping up his shirt as well as he could.
"The strange man shot Daddy," Peter said instantly. Tony shot him a look before Steve was looking for the wound. He hissed in pain when Steve's hand brushed over his arm.
"You liiiiiike him," she sing-songed. Steve's eyes widened a little, and Meg started to cackle quietly. "You really like him! And that's why he's messing with your music." She reached into her pocket pulling out her own phone. "Alright, I'm gonna need details, let's do this. I can be an awesome wingman."
