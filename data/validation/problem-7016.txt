Pepper figured out that Tony was insecure because she had freaky weird sixth sense and might actually be some kind of Jedi Goddess. Tony wasn’t sure, but he wouldn’t be surprised if that turned out to be a thing.
Steve thankfully did, although he couldn’t help but to gape at first, “You don’t have to.” Tony hurriedly said, worried that he was moving too fast for Steve, “I just… I’d like you to, but I understand if you’d rather wait, it’s not mandatory or anything, so if you don’t want to it’s cool I totally understand..”
“Well I’m working on making a web fluid.” Peter said relaxing further, “And I’m not allowed on the ceiling, Mamma’s blood pressure gets too high if I do so,” He easily dodged the pillow Tony threw at him and grinned.
Loki certainly packed a punch though and Steve was having to use all of the edge the serum had given him until a blast of some horrendous music came out of nowhere with a snarky voice over the Coms saying “Agent Sociopath, did you miss me?” And then a flash of blinding light burst in the sky, knocking Loki on his ass and then the Iron Man was landing on the ground.
Tony’s whole body went rigid beneath Steve’s hands and he gave a pitiful choking cry, coughing up clotted blood and sucked in an eerie sounding rattling breath, and a for a moment time seemed to freeze as he stared at Steve managing to force out one last apology before his eyes rolled shut and his body became limp.
Everyone ran over to where he was standing, a flank of gold and red armour could be seen at his feet peaking out from the debris.
“I think you should ask your Mamma that question, little Man.” He said and set Zach down onto the floor, “Now, shall we go and choose pizza toppings before Peter chooses for us?”
“It’s a euphemism for genitalia.” Natasha explained, curlers in her hair, a face pack on her face, and her toes separated as she painted them.
“Breathe Steve, remember to breathe.” Sam encouraged wincing when Tony screeched Steve’s name on a fresh contraction.
“But you’re Spiderman.” Lydia gushed, “We’ve seen you on the internet, you totally have to wear your costume to the party.”
“Remarkably well.” Tony said looking as proud as he felt, “They’ve both insulted me, tormented me, and are plotting my death, so its business as usual really.”
Steve nodded and stretched. He didn’t feel like sleeping, he wasn’t in the mood to draw as he was too restless. “What can I do to help?” He asked AI.
“Tony?” Steve tried to reach out for the Billionaire, but Tony pulled back with a yelp, as if he were afraid of being hurt. He clenched his hands into fists and closed his eyes tight, whispering to himself as he sucked in harsh breath after harsh breath. It was only thanks to the serum having enhanced his hearing that Steve heard Tony speak at all, and what he heard confused him.
“Left you with a hicky and enough money for the cab fair?” Tony drawled, “Yeah, story of that bastards life.” He rolled his shoulders, “I may not remember you that well, but I don’t recall you being psychotic back then.”
His arm had been amputated at just below the shoulder, the damage had been exacerbated by the car accident and the surgeon had decided it wasn’t worth trying to save it.
By the time the Doctors were done with him, Natasha and Clint were sporting stitches and a couple of support bandages each. Tony should have been wearing a sling to rest his shoulder but it would rub the burn on his neck so the Doctor just told him to rest the arm as much as he could and to try not to move it about too much.
“And so handsome, is their a better word than Handsome? I’d say beautiful but that seems to girly. But he is beautiful, those clear blue eyes, azure, that’s what they are, azure. I like that word, Jay, make a not of that will ya?”
“Shut it feather-head.” Tony said with a roll of his eyes as Steve protested about being a virgin before this.
He sighed and bit his lip, “How do I tell him Pep?” He asked her, “Why should he have to suffer because of me and my bodies weakness?”
“Please, sweetheart. We just need your Mamma to do something for us and then we’ll let you go.” She said, “Please just calm down and I promise all of this will be over soon.”
Tony couldn't tear himself away from Peter's bedside for more than the five minutes it took for him to the toilets and wash his hands. He was terrified that if he left him then Peter would die and Tony wouldn't be there to at least be holding him hand and telling him that he loved him.
“You’ll tell them yourself, you hear me Tony, you’ll tell them yourself. Come on baby, don’t do this, fight, you are Iron Man remember, you can fight this!”
“Shut up you little fool!” Norman snapped grabbing his Son’s arm and pulling him to sit down but it was already too late, everyone had heard Harry admit to hitting MJ.
Then came a whole battery of tests, bloods, heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, MRI, CAT, and practically every other test ever invented. Tony had felt like a pin cushion by the time they had done poking, prodding, and scanning him.
“And what of your W.S.C.?” Tony asked. He watched as Natasha and Fury exchanged an uncomfortable look between them, “You don’t know.” He said and pinched the bridge of his nose, “Project Insight can’t go ahead, Nick. Not with Hydra in the works. Not without full public support.”
“And where would that be?” Reynolds fired back, “These children are enhanced. Where could they possibly go that they won’t be treated as different to others, how many foster homes to do think will be willing to take them considering the media attention it would automatically attract, and there is no way such a home could remain anonymous, the boys would be recognized and then someone would tip off the press and there would be two dozen journalists camping on the front step.”
“I miss Mamma.” Zach said with an unhappy pout. He was sat in front of the TV watching Doctor Who. He had a panda plushie in his fist, something Tony had given him when he was a month old and he had slept with the Panda by his side ever since. The fact he was cuddling said panda now showed how much he was missing Tony, something that tugged on Happy’s heart strings, he hated seeing the Pup upset for any reason.
Panicked, Tony immediately called his Doctor, bundling Zach off to bed with a dose of calpol, orange juice, and cold water for him to sip and fretted over the reading on the thermometer.
At the compound the Avengers gathered, leaving the defenders and Fantastic Four in the city to protect the shelters. The X-Men deployed throughout America to back up the military as they awaited Thanos.
Tony shot the reporter a wink, “Wait and see.” He said, “And that’s all we’ve got time for, I need to get to the airport and get home, my pups are waiting for me.”
“And you thought that I was making do.” Steve finished making Tony wince, it sounded even worse when spoken outloud, an insult to Steve’s integrity, and Tony did expect Steve to storm out of the bedroom in insulted disgust, but to his amazement Steve did not do that, instead let his shirt fall from his hands crossed the room to take Tony into his arms and kiss him very gently.
Grinning, Tony pointed at his bedside table where he kept condoms and lube. Pausing briefly to kiss him again, Steve moved to grab the lube and a condom, giving Tony the chance to admire his sculpted backside and to cheekily give the cheeks a slap.
At least if Zach went to Pre-school he stood a chance of making friends before he went to mainstream school, especially if he went to same one as those friends.
Pietro would probably argue but it would be easy enough to convince him that she was right, she had done so before and she could do it again, and once they were in America they could take their revenge on Stark, strip his family from him like he’d taken their parents and then, when he was broken and begging, only then would they kill him.
“Wrestling?” Thor asked as he attempted to draw a bilgesnipe so Zach would know what they looked like.
“And you.” Norman snarled into his ear, “Don’t think I’ll fall on my sword to protect you and Stern. If I go down you are coming with me.”
“The similarities were found are like that of the super soldier serum.” The Doctor said, “It is not identical but very similar, it seems to effect your immune system and strengthen your healing, but does not give you greater strength as it has the Captain, maybe because it isn’t identical to the super soldier serum.”
Clearly every instinct that Bucky had was telling him to run while he still had the chance. It was taking everything he had to fight the impulse and force himself not to do so. He looked from Tony to Steve, to the wriggling crying baby, to the unhappy man behind Tony, to the Cops, and then back to Tony who was gazing at him imploring him to do as he asked. His heart was pounding, and his mouth was dry, he wanted to run, to get himself out of there while he had the chance, but he knew intellectually that it would be a mistake, so he slowly but surely reached out and took the offered hand.
From Hungary he was on foot. He had a little money on him and was able to purchase some food, which he consumed on the go. He didn’t dare use public transport. It was always too crowded and there was too much surveillance.
One thing he was not, was grown up enough to not enjoy blowing things up when given the opportunity.
“Why don’t you tell them?” Tony shouted at Rogers, “Tell them how you and Romanoff hid my parents murder, how you’ve lied to my face for fucking years!”
Tony and Bruce took batteries of bloods, urine, faeces, hair, and skin samples to test, looking at everything that could be looked at while scanning Peter multiple times and having him do certain things for them so they could measure his heartrate at rest and during activity, his breathing, and how quick his recovery time was.
This is rather odd, writing to myself, and I’m sure it is very odd to you two, reading a letter that an older version of yourself wrote for you.
“Well its total shit that you are being kept out.” MJ said, “I’ve started a petition which I will send to the school board.”
“Nothing wrong,” Steve reassured him, or attempted to, but Tony was shaking his head and staring at him in shock,
“No, this isn’t possible.” Steve whispered, “Peggy would have seen it, someone would have seen it and stopped you.”
Tony managed a small smile, “I am, and who might you be, and what Unit you with?” He asked gesturing to the tags.
Natasha however had her narrowed eyes focused on Tony, “What did you say about Hydra?” she asked recognizing the name.
“That sucks.” Peter sighed following Tony as he headed over to the sofa and sat down shooting back onto his feet when something brushed against the back of his legs.
Zach grinned, he’d heard his Mamma use that code a few times and now it had come in handy, “Take me back to Mamma, Jarvis.” He ordered the AI.
Tony had created for Zach his very own Tardis. It didn’t work, of course, but the outside was Tardis Blue, it had a light on top that light up, the Police Box sign on the double doors, and the inside had the Tardis console with various levers and buttons that made noises and flashed lights. Zach could go inside and pretend he was flying his own Tardis, and since it was on wheels, it could be easily pushed too and from his bedroom.
Jolting awake Tony became away of Steve leaning over him, his hands on his shoulders and a worried expression on his face.
“And human experiments would still be going on.” Tony said, “While ill-advised, what you have done is expose horrific acts of criminal behaviour.”
“You’re welcome.” Steve said as Pepper took the flowers to put them in water and Natasha and Bruce urged the two on their way so they didn’t miss the movie they were going to see before they went to dinner.
“Certainly, this is the Hartwell Fertility clinic. Mr Stark need’s to come in for an additional blood test and scan of his ovaries to ensure that his treatment is not causing any negative effects on his body.”
“Why didn’t you save me?” Were always his final words as Tony took him into his arms only to have the body crumble to ash and blow away into the wind.
Everyone looked at each other not really knowing how to comment on that. After a beat Bruce cleared his throat and spoke up, “Jarvis, could you explain the Ultron project?”
Zach was rarely ill, something that Tony was deeply grateful for. He’d gotten all of Zach’s shots, even thought he hated seeing his Pup crying as the needles went into his skin, and he’d taken extra precautions changing Zach’s nappies after the Polio immunisation, having a booster jab for himself.
Wanda shrugged, “The same as I did for the rest of you, I made him see his worst fear.” She replied, “His was seeing you all dead, being the last one standing,” A cruel smirk twisted her lips, “You blamed him, in the vision I mean. You told him he should have done more and then died in his arms.”
“Hi Zach, did you have fun in school today?” Peter asked squashing himself into the middle seat with MJ sitting on his right and Ned claiming the front seat.
“Mamma I think there’s some Enema things here!” Zach called as he peered into a rock pool, “They’re all wiggly like worms.”
Steve wrinkled his nose, “No, I don’t want that. But I want to do something, to get my opinions out there; if these assholes can say stuff like this, then I have the right answer them back.”
“Um okay, no.” Steve said both bemused and relieved that Tony was already planning for the future, “You need to rest and recover your strength.”
Honestly was it too much to ask to be allowed to sleep in the sun for several hours until he burned to a pleasant golden crisp?
“It is stiff competition in such a place but the denizens are pretty chilled once you get to know them!” Tony made a pained noise and buried his face in his hands,
This was not Rhodey’s only request for romantic advice as Tony dragged him into the lab and put said lab on blackout mode going into a babble about his dating Steve and if it was the right thing to do and if he was getting in over his head, “I’m so much older than him, Rhodey, and I’m so fucked up, I’ve never done this before, the actual dating thing, what if I mess it up, what if he hates me, what if he decides I’m not worth it and moves out of the tower and then goes to the other end of the country or decides to move to Canada and I never see him again, the team will hate me, the Kids will hate me, I can’t let him move to Canada Rhodey, he has to stay here with us!”
Bruce nodded and Natasha gave small incline of her head, one of the decorate curls from her bouffant bouncing over her ear.
“So long as Tony is alright, nothing else matters.” Steve said, taking a seat on Tony’s right side and took hold of his hand, “That is the only thing that matters now.
“The judge probably won’t grant it, not full immunity, but he may get a soft ball sentence in a low security prison.” He said to the industrialist, “And his testimony will crucify you.”
“Come Camp Crystal Lake, you’ll have a wonderful time, you can swim, climb the trees, and get disembowelled by Jason Vorhees or his deranged mother!”
“But would you have moved so fast, or used the Mind Stone had you not been frightened by what you saw?” Steve asked, “Would Bruce have turned into Hulk and gone on a rampage through Johannesburg had Wanda not forced the Hulk out and frightened him?” This was the best argument to make as Tony had been fierce in his defence for Bruce’s actions and his innocence in regards to Johannesburg.
Once again Tony took charge with an overly large smile on his face and loud greeting for the first socialite he came across, breaking the ice and getting some of the attention off the others so they had a chance to get their bearings before they were set upon.
“Well, I used to be too weak to get out of bed sometimes, a lot of the time in fact.” Steve said, “More than once my Mother had to help me out to the privy, or hold a bowl under me while I was sick, needed to pee, or worse. It didn’t make a difference to me that she was a nurse and did this sort of thing anyway, I always felt humiliated by it, even more so if she couldn’t get a bowl to me in time and there was a mess to clean up.”
One would have thought that the two adults would be bored out of their skulls following a kid around an amusement park, but actually Steve and Tony had a good time, alternating taking Zach on the rides he was big enough to go on and accompanying Peter onto the bigger rides, while one of them stayed with Zach.
“You didn’t see that coming?” A smug accented voice asked him and a blonde twenty something smirked at him before disappearing, a second later Clint was on the ground bleeding from a shot to his side.
“Hey there was a movie set in a campsite where a killer was going around cutting people’s faces off.” Peter offered up, “I watched it with MJ and Ned.”
The huge bulging muscles that body builders now sported were never really present in Steve’s time either, or if they were it was only professional athletes who had them, normal people couldn’t afford gyms and there was no such thing as home workout equipment, any muscles built was from doing manual labour on the docks or other physical jobs, and with food being so scarce they all made do with what ever cuts of meat they could get, lean, fatty, tender, or chewy, you ate because if you didn’t you starved.
“I will be.” Pepper said, “And so will you. I don’t know if Steve and boys have told you, but we are already making the necessary modifications to the tower and your lab, we will have everything ready for when you are released from the hospital.”
“Absolutely,” Steve said, “Dealing with the press is not my favourite occupation, but I have done so on several occasions and Tony, my Tony, helped teach me how to deal with them, how to avoid saying the wrong thing and not letting them lead me on or twist my words.”
While he could have left the job of speaking to Peter and drawing out what was bothering him to Tony, Steve didn’t want to leave the difficult aspects parenting to Tony, he wanted to share the responsibility himself.
He pushed open the door to the bathroom and walked inside going to the sinks and turned on the water, pushing the plug into the basin he waited until it was half full and then turned off the faucet. He sunk his hands into the water and began to rub at the blood on his skin, scrubbing it away, turning the water a murky red as it gradually left his skin.
Once they were in Fury’s office however, and the door was shut, Fury switched on a small device that looked like an IPlayer.
Steve did so and a spoon from the draw which he set on the counter besides the mugs, “Sorry.” He said rubbing the back of his head with a sheepish expression, “I’ve run out of tea and Jarvis said you had some and wouldn’t mind sharing.”
Fortunately they were going into a hospital, face masks and surgical gowns were not something people paid attention to and both the surgical masks and gowns were already in stock in SI as they were used in some of the research departments.
“So I can write on his casts.” Clint replied bouncing on the balls of his feet looking gleeful at the prospect of writing lewd jokes and filthy images all over Tony’s casts.
“I cannot guess the inner workings of Sirs mind, but I believe he simply did not wish to worry anyone unnecessarily.” Jarvis said, “This project was a last resort, only to be activated if his death was imminent or his injuries were to be considered life changing.” The red faced head tilted to the side and Jarvis regarded the team, “I am to assume that Sir’s condition is severe?”
“Now, even if I could develop some kind of space weapon, we couldn’t even launch it into space without having permission from the UN. Part of the treaties regarding space expressly forbade any kind of weaponry being put in orbit or tested in space, something that all countries with space programs have to adhere to.”
It was very late evening before anyone wanted to eat any Christmas cake or yule log and even then they only had small slices having also enjoyed the chocolates that were being handed around and were content to spend the rest of the night lounging around and enjoying each-others company.
“Yeah, Sam, don’t call him that.” Tony said, leaning over the back of the sofa, “He’s more a Yoga Matt!” he yelped as Matt’s hand came up the back of his head with an impressive slap that had Rhodey laughed while Tony made a show of being wounded until the room service arrived, then he was all smiles and like a kid in a sweet shop waiting to get his hands on the goodies.
All of the team crowded into the lab to watch as Peter and Zach blew up the volcano they had built. It was an impressive eruption, the side of the volcano blew out in a pyroclastic explosion creating a crater in the side of Mt Stark which oozed out the lava they had filled it with, splattering against the protective glass shield the volcano was sat behind. The material that had been blown out crashed down into the water they had surrounding the volcano creating a tsunami which then decimated the miniature town they had built opposite the volcano. Simulating the eruption of Krakatoa.
Steve carried Peter out to the care and got into the back with him, Peter’s head resting in his lap and his hands covering Peter’s ears as Tony drove back to the tower, ordering Jarvis to let Bruce know they were coming home and to have the lab ready with a bed and equipment for Peter.
Tony snorted and shook his head, “There is no fixing it, I’ve already tried, I’ve been through every element known to man, there is nothing.”
Taste they approached with the same caution, taking care not to overwhelm Peter’s taste buds and only giving him plain foods at first then gradually increasing flavours and textures.
Pepper would be acting as their guardian along with Happy when they got back to New York until Tony’s release from the hospital, Clint, Sam, and Bruce would also be heading back to New York with them, while Natasha and Thor stayed in Prague with Steve and Tony, splitting the team up wasn’t something they really wanted to do but they couldn’t be away from their base indefinitely. With one of their own down, villains would undoubtedly take advantage of the situation especially in the Avengers absence, once they knew at least some of the team was back in America they might think twice before they started causing havoc, already the Wrecking Crew had kicked off but the Fantastic Four had dealt with them easily enough, dropping them back off at the prison they’d broken out of days earlier.
“Good, because if you do hurt Tony then there won’t be enough left your body for anyone to find.” Rhodey warned him, leaning forward to whisper into his ear, “And I have enough resources to ensure that they won’t even bother looking.”
Tony flinched, “He doesn’t know.” He whispered hoping for a second that Pepper wouldn’t hear that. But only for a second.
Fury shook his head, “The situation changed too fast. I’ve had this plan ready to go for years in case I needed to lay low, I just wasn’t expecting to be taking bullets last night.”
But if what Steve was saying was true, then maybe these nightmares weren’t really nightmares at all, maybe they were something else.
“Clearly I was wrong.” Steve said, shrugging his massive shoulders, “Shall I go run us a bath?” He tickled Lily’s stomach making her squeal and kick her legs, “Do you want a bubble bath madam, with lots of bubbles?”
Tony shook his head and looked down at his lap, “I don’t know what to say,” he admitted, “I thought you hated me, thought you didn’t want anything to do with me, and now you’re telling me that you like me?”
Pulled out of sleep Tony's eyes widened and he shot up from his seat, over turning it and waking Steve in the process, "Peter, oh baby, oh my God!" Tony cried peppering Peter's sweaty face in kisses while Steve shouted for help and hurried back to them.
“It doesn’t matter.” Pietro snapped lifting her up, “We have to go, now!” He sped off with Wanda leaving Tony in a spreading pool of blood.
He fell to the ground dropping the scalpel and clutching at his destroyed shoulder and limp limb, screaming in agony and blood poured from the wound.
“Get him on a drip, cross match for bloods and put a call in for Orthopaedics.” The doctor ordered the nurses and junior doctors, “Do we have an ID for him?”
Just over seven hours into Tony’s surgery and Sam reported that Pepper, Happy, and the boys were in Germany and would be in Prague in three hours or so, they were just waiting for the plane to be refuelled before they flew on.
If something did develop between the two of them, then Pepper would not be surprised. But she suspected that it would take a while before they stopped dancing around each-other and realized that what they were feeling was being reciprocated.
Thor and Sam landed in the ruins and swiftly began to join in the frantic digging, “Tony!” Steve bellowed, “Peter!”
“It’s doubtful that their injuries would be consistent with a car crash if they were assassinated.” He explained the Steve, “So in all likelihood the Doctor who performed the autopsies was either Hydra or was paid off by them to falsify the records.”
“This is the base they are using.” She said, “We believe it is under the command of a high up Hydra operative by the name of Strucker.”
That was a fair point, Norman was smart when it came to playing the stock market but on practical things like that he was useless and as for innovation, he had less imagination than a by the book physics teacher.
“No I’m not.” Steve said, “I am far from perfect. Everyone is. Everyone makes mistakes, you, me, everyone. But what matters is that we try to make amends for them, that we try and do better so that we don’t repeat the mistakes we’ve made.”
“Hey, everything taken care of?” Clint asked, keeping his voice low, Sam and Matt were sprawled out on the sofa with Peter snuggled between them in an impossibly small ball, while Tony, Steve, and Lily were in the bedroom.
Steve was dressed in a light blue/grey suit, with a royal blue shirt, a grey tie that had a patten in blue over it, and a grey pocket handkerchief. He’d also been given a rolex to wear and a Saint Michael tie pin in gold.
“Tony what..,” Steve broke off as Tony brought his hands up to cover his ears, keeping his eyes closed tight, desperately his fingers curled into his hair, tugging at it hard enough to hurt his scalp.
“I’m sorry.” He whispered trying to bury his face into Steve’s chest, tried to bury his shame, the shame of being an infertile Omega, a useless mate to his Alpha.
Steve may not like killing, but he had done so before, he’d been to war, they weren’t firing blanks back then, they shot to kill and he’d taken many lives during that time as had every other soldier. The twins however had crossed the line in their attack on Tony. Steve would not and could not let it pass, the pair would die when he faced them, there would be no holding back, no pulling punches, no trying to subdue instead of kill, he would end the pair for this.
The hardest part of Tony’s rehab for Steve had been to not do things for Tony himself, he had to bite his tongue and restrain himself from offering to help all the time or to lift Tony from one place to another. He could do it easily, but that wasn’t the point, neither would it be beneficial to Tony, who needed to be able to do these things himself.
Clint was shifting around, his knees bouncing and fingers tapping with restless energy, Bruce was worrying at his bottom lip and there was a frown on his face as he stared out of the window.
“And what would my other hand be doing in this scenario?” Steve purred, a lewd smirk playing on his lips.
Steve bit his lip and Tony sighed heavily, “It’s to be expected of course. He was bound to get curious sooner or later.” He tapped his fingers on the countertop, “I was hoping it would be later, a lot later. So I might have had a chance to figure out what the hell I’m going to tell him.”
“You know, I’m cancelling it, I’m not in the mood.” He said pushing away from the work station and patting Dumm-E as he went.
Tony spluttered with a laugh, “Business tech, that’s giving Hammer too much credit, he wasn’t that smart, Cap.”
Whenever he was struggling to get her to settle Tony would call Steve for a video chat, it gave Steve a chance to see Morgan and it helped keep Tony sane after several hours of howling. They tried to do Video calls daily or at least every other day, and the team managed to get back to the base a handful of times, Laura even brought the children to see Clint, she was still furious with him but wouldn’t deny her children the chance to see their Father.
“I never told you to kidnap Stark’s brat and slice him open!” Norman snarled, “What in the hell possessed you to do that?”
Bucky chose to stay at the hotel with Vision, Matt, and Sam while Steve, Rhodey, and Tony went to the UN, taking Lily with them.
Steve’s eyes burned with the need to cry; but, at his feet Zach was starting to whimper and let out the first choked sounds of what was bound to become a crying fit. Steve blinked back the tears and pulled himself together, this was no time for him to break down and start sobbing; he had two children depending on him right now, children he’d been entrusted with and he would be damned before he’d let them down.
The fantastic four readily agreed to ally with Tony and Steve in the event of an invasion, as did the Defenders. Though, Dare Devil was reluctant to make himself known to them, but then he was reluctant to make himself known to anyone. Steve had told Tony the Devil’s identity, Matt Murdock, who was coming to the Gala, as one of the most prestigious lawyers in New York, he very supportive of LGBTQA.
Tony stared at him like he’d grown a second head, Clint snorted, Natasha rolled her eyes and headed for the kitchen, and Sam cleared his throat, “I think you may be under-estimating just how crazy this is going to get, Cap.”
Tony’s eyes widened, Steve stared in shock, the mask falling from his limp hand, the man continued to squirm, “Who the hell is Bucky?” He demanded.
Tony lifted his dark eyes meeting the concerned and painfully loving blue of Steve’s, “Its going to be okay sweetheart.”
“Everything is going to be fine Tony. You’re going to get better.” Steve said, forcing himself to say it even if he didn’t fully believe it. “You are going to rest for a while and then you are going to come back to us, back to me and the boys because we need you baby, we need you and we love you.”
“She would have still been working for Shield then, wouldn’t she?” Pepper asked, “She didn’t retire until, what was it 93?”
Beta Women and Omega’s now had equal rights with Alphas and Beta Men, or at least a lot more rights than they had in the forties. Gay marriage was legal, Alphas could marry other Alphas or Beta Men, Omegas could marry other Omegas and Beta Women.
Peter expected to feel the pain of the impact against the wall and then the impact of hitting the floor, the first came but the second did not.
Finally Tony’s present came. He brought it up from the lab, insisting that Zach keep his eyes shut as he wheeled it in, the team snorting and rolling their eyes when they saw what it was.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Tony sneered. He turned to Steve, who had remained at his side, vigilant and ready to tackle Rogers should he try to be violent again, but content to let Tony vent without interrupting him. “Take me home?” he asked. Nodding, Steve wrapped an arm about Tony’s shoulders, pulling him close and guiding him to the doors,
“I’m sorry I scared you.” Tony said his voice becoming hoarse, “But if that missile had blown in the city then all of us would have been killed, and a lot of others too. But that doesn’t matter now, we’re safe, it’s all over. Are you two okay, Happy, are they okay?”
Peter gulped and balled his hands into fists making himself hide his fear, “You know who I am.” He said scowling at the Doctor, “You know who my Mother is, so you must know what he is going to do to you if you hurt me.”
It wasn’t a name that Steve had been expecting but he couldn’t say that he disliked it either, “That works for both a boy and a girl.” He said consideringly.
“Sure.” Tony said swiping the screen and typing in his pin number, he loaded up Netflix and set Dr Who playing.
The teacher opened her mouth to reply but was saved from doing so as a Nurse called out for Tony and Steve.
He looked now to his friend with new respect for Tony’s strength of will, that fighting spirit that had kept him going. Many would have given up, would have just let themselves die, but he hadn’t, he’d fought on and found a way to escape the Ten Rings, to survive Stane, to have Zach and adopt Peter, he’d created a new element in his basement, fought Hammer and Vanko, now fought of an alien invasion and survived being blown up by a mad mans AI legacy!
“I hate you and I am going to web all the coffee machines to the ceiling!” Had been Peter’s response, not at all pleased by the fact that Zach was loudly singing, “Petey’s got a girlfriend!”
Tony pressed a kiss onto Zach’s cheek, making sure that he had his favourite bear cuddled up against him before turning down the lights and heading for the door.
“I guess I could do a video link from here.” He said, “Give them the details they want, that way they will be pacified and they will know that I’m not at deaths door or brain damaged.”
The attack started with Bruce crash landing in the Sanctum as Wong and Stephen were about to step out for some lunch. He told them of Thanos and Strange immediately went to alert Tony, finding him in Central Park with Steve and Lily.
“Supposing I agree to this.” Tony said, “Supposing I don’t stand in the courts way, I don’t contest the decision or appeal against Curien getting immunity or witness protection, might I be granted a favour?”
Tony was in the air firing down on Thanos as Steve hurled his Shield at him, tackling the Titan in tandem. Beating the shield into Thanos’ face and head, Steve kept the Titan blind for Vision’s attack, ducking down as Vision used the mind stone, lashing out at Thanos and beating back for a few moments, then Thanos closed his fists and Vision was hurled across the battle field, slamming into Strange who had been dealing with several Chitauri and Hyena/Wargs.
“Well a couple of years had gone by hadn’t it? She and Rory had been dating for quite so time before they got married. Mamma and Steve will do the same, they won’t get married right away.”
Tony couldn’t speak, all he could do was gape at Steve as he chuckled fondly and stroked his thumb over Tony’s cheek.
“Well I do have an island we can go to.” Tony said wincing and touching his swollen face. The face plate might have protected him from serious injury but didn’t stop bruises from forming when he smashed his face against it. After a moment of silence he looked up to see the team staring at him, “What?” He asked.
“Oh!” Steve was slightly taken aback by that; although he didn’t know why, Tony was an Omega; he had heats, it was only natural that he’d be going into one.
“There’s a supply closet.” Tony said urging Steve on, “If we’re quiet and you keep your back against the door then no one can come in and….” Steve cut him off with a hand over his mouth.
Shaking his head Rhodey made his way over to the suit, he ran his hands up the silver frame, “She’s a beauty.”
“Oh yes, it’s time.” May said, “We need towels, something to cut the cord, and something to wrap the baby in.”
“Fuck you, and yes we survived.” Tony retorted, “And why are you here, shouldn’t you be off doing some semi-covert military stuff that I am not supposed to know anything about?”
That brought a grin to Peter’s face as he imagined himself as a superhero. What would he call himself he wondered, Extra-sensory Man, Hyperaware Man. Super-High-Five?
“Now, drink your tea before it gets cold.” Bruce said, “And tonight, you can help me make a korma from scratch.”
Tony perked up at that, he knew that Steve was too afraid of accidently hurting Zach to train him, if Zach was to received training it would be best if it came from a professional with experience in teaching children. Learning a form of martial arts may well help his confidence, it would also teach him self-discipline and defence.
Steve was sure Stane would have been the type to abandon Tony after this kind of injury, to write him off as damaged goods and leave him to fend for himself, while Tony was just stubborn enough to get himself together and thrive on his own just to spite Stane, it wasn’t fair that he would have had to go through all this alone and Steve was thankful that things had played out in such a way that the Omega had a strong support system around him.
“Right now, helping.” Clint replied, although there wasn’t much he and Natasha could do, the fires were burning too much for them to get close, all they could do was watch the others and keep and eye out for more drones as their teammates worked to get through the rubble, even Hulk, once he’d come forth did so, smashing his way through the debris like a plough, his sheer bulk forcing it back.
The man snarled and lashed out, he kicked Steve in the face and his hands suddenly became vices on Tony’s gauntlets, the metal groaning under the strain which added pressure to Tony’s already wounded arm, his grip on the man loosened which he used to his advantage dropping down and using his body weight to drag Tony down with him then hurled Tony hard against the piler, the brickwork cracking and the suit caving in on one side.
He wasn’t the only one suffering the media’s unwanted attentions; Peter’s school had Paps outside the gates trying to get information from him, some even daring to try and bribe the teachers and other parents.
“Yeah, but what would be the fun in that?” Tony asked, smiling as he watched film Steve bundle his film self away to their bedroom before they were recorded making porn. “I still think we’d have gotten better ratings if you’d let us include some sexy fun times.”
In the light of the kitchen the pairs injuries were far more visible. Steve had a nasty gnash from his hairline down to his eyebrow, his nose was swollen and bloody, both eyebrows split, as were his cheeks, and his lips were swollen and caked in dried blood. When he took of his shirt bruising on his ribs, abdomen and back were clear to see from where Bucky had pummelled him.
“Then don’t challenge me.” Norman said. He sighed at seeing his son’s unhappy expression, “We’ll deal with the brat and his bitch Mother. First lets get the lawsuit dropped, then we can look into getting justice for you.”
Like Steve he was dressed in Sam’s sweat pants and a T-Shirt, however, he had to fold over the waist band and roll the legs up to keep from tripping over them, and the T-Shirt looked rather like a mini dress on him it was so long.
Now it was Tony’s turn to blush, as those brilliant blue eyes stared at him like he was a wonder, like he wasn’t the flawed and damaged Omega he knew he was. They were still gazing into each-other’s eyes when Sam returned with his laptop in one hand and a tool kit in the other. Tony and Steve sprang apart when he set them on the table, both of them flushing at having been caught in an intimate if innocent moment.
“Maybe we sent you back to school too soon.” Steve said rubbing Peter’s back, “We should have given you more time to adjust.”
The majority of what Shield had on the Winter soldier was as Natasha and Clint had said, stories of a ghost, no real tangible evidence, just a vast amount of unsolved murders going back seventy years.
“Because you do not seem yourself.” Steve said, reaching around Tony and taking his hands from the suits wires so he could turn him around, “You haven’t been yourself since we began speaking about Mothers.” He kissed Tony’s forehead and hooked a finger under his chin so they were looking at each-other, “Won’t you tell me what’s wrong?”
“Your mission is accomplished?” he asked eyeing the deep gnash in the metal arm. “Stark and Rogers?”
Rhodey opened his mouth but couldn’t find anything to say, “I don’t suppose we could ask her?” Matt asked, and Tony shook his head,
It was still a bit of a shock, hearing that Irish female voice instead of the familiar British Male voice of Tony’s AI, why he hadn’t repaired the program Roger’s didn’t know. Tony always seemed to emotionally attached to his mechanical inventions, like those robots in his lab, and those malfunctioning kitchen appliances, treating them like they were people instead of just the lumps of wires and metal that they were made of.
The pillow only muffled the sound, it didn’t block it completely as Peter had hoped, he could still hear the noise it was only more distorted with the pillow over his head.
“Okay, stop before you give yourself an embolism, kid.” He said, and looked at Deadpool, “And you, out!”
“Get lost Squidward!” Tony yelled to Ebony Maw, “You’re not welcome on this planet, leave now and we don’t break you into little pieces.”
“In about twenty to twenty five years you can be Fire-Cracker.” Tony said refusing to melt when Zach pouted at him.
“I know.” Tony said. He wasn’t keen on the press finding out he was paralysed, he was still struggling to accept it himself, but he knew that Pepper was right, the media would discover this sooner or later and it would be better if it was on Tony’s terms rather than theirs.
Chuckling Steve patted Jarvis’s shoulder and headed back into the hospital room, joining Tony at the head of the bed and kissing his temple as he settled in to help the boys with their school work.
“We’ll have to show you the lab, it’s been retrofitted so it’s wheelchair friendly.” Peter said enjoying his second piece of cake,
Sleeping the beach was not the best idea. Tony couldn’t get comfortable, the lilo he had borrowed from Clint was no help, Steve’s body was as hard as a rock and while that was very pleasant to have sex with, it made for a very bad mattress, and to add insult to injury, Steve dropped off right away and continued to sleep easily despite Tony’s wriggling around.
“JARVIS.” Is Tony Stark’s A.I. who runs this tower and assists in the piloting of the Iron Man armour.” The Host explained to the camera.
Again silence filled the room as every one took in the information and began to draw the only conclusion they could. At three months old very few people would have had access to Tony, and only one person would have had the skill to develop a formula similar to super soldier serum.
There were people in plexi glass cages, people with limbs cut off and exchanged for animal limbs, people with scales and claws growing out of their bodies, people who weren’t even alive anymore, their bodies, or what was left of them were hooked up to life support machines while their flesh, their bones, their organs were harvested for use elsewhere.
The sky was on fire, the atmosphere of the planet was in flames; the ground was scorched black and crumbled under foot sending plumes of smoky dust into the chocking fume filled air.
Tony would snort and roll his eyes at the spectacle, and uploaded images of a pyjama clad Zach standing on Steve’s chest to the internet with the caption, Cap’s Arch Nemesis?
Tony tipped the porter with a wad of notes that added up to a nice round grand, then went and threw himself down onto the plush sofa, putting his feet up on the coffee table and turned on the TV.
“Now Frosty has got friends!” Zach cheered happily as more pictures were taken, and Gingerbread and Espresso came out onto the balcony at last to see what all the fuss was about. Curiously they dipped their paws into the snow and shook them when they discovered that the white stuff was cold and wet, Espresso quickly lost interest and hurried back inside to find a warm place to curl up in which Gingerbread continued to explore for a while, burrowing into the snow face first as if he were a plough, until he too grew tired of being cold and wet and went back into the penthouse.
“So will you be coming back to school?” Ned asked, “Norman has taken Harry out and is keeping him at home.”
“Hey Bucky, you in there?” Stark called, “I don’t want to hurry you if you’re taking a bath or whatever, but… well I really need to pee and Lily really needs a nappy change, so… yeah,”
“Maybe I will!” Steve said and suddenly dipped Tony, making the smaller man yelp in surprise and then giggle, as he held Steve tighter to support himself,
The only food that Tony had suitable for the baby was a banana, which he mashed down with a fork and some milk that he heated in the microwave.
“Then you know why I have to be with him.” Tony said looking at the pair, Bruce sighed and ran a hand through his hair.
“The worlds mightiest heroes.” Nick Fury said, observing them from his office. “Dear God give me strength.”
Peter shivered and swallowed hard forcing himself to speak without a tremor in his voice, “I won’t tell you anything.”
Besides, if tonight’s visit to Osborn’s factory paid off then he could hand over the information he’d gathered and come clean to his parents while also proving he was capable of being a superhero.
They had been confused by the new, different Captain Steve Rogers who’d appeared on the TV with the Mechanic that Hydra had always been interested in. They heard words they didn’t understand about dimensions and multiverses, and figured that some crazy science thing had happened to bring this Steve here.
While I do not think Stark has been abusive to these boys, he has been negligent in his responsibility to them, and I think that negligence needs to be investigated and if necessary the children should be removed to a more stable environment.” Stern declared,
Tony shook his head, his expression grim, “Not if he were president himself.” He said in a tight voice. He looked at Steve with fear in his eyes, “When Hitler first rose to power, which was the first country he invaded and took over with the Nazi party?”
“I think we should head back to the villa.” Bruce said, “Tony could do with a lay down, and I don’t know about the rest of you, but I think I’ve had my fill of this part of the island today.”
It was sad at times not being able e to share any of this with a mate, Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy were great, but it wasn’t the same, he couldn’t have them spoon him as he’d seen Alpha’s in movies do with their Omega’s, have them rub cocoa butter into his growing bump, spend hours kissing and caressing it as the Pup moved.
“Blenny.” Bruce said, “These are Blenny. You are lucky to see them, they, like the sea scorpion can change their colour so they can camouflage.”
“I tried to set it.” Steve said immediately feeling guilty about having put Tony at risk of further pain.
Tony exhaled through his nose. Steve was right, no one could survive a fall like that. It didn’t matter that Barnes had landed on snow, it wouldn’t have cushioned him enough to prevent severe damage being done, his head would split it open like a boiled egg, his neck, back, every bone would have shattered. Thor might walk away from something like that as he was a God, but Tony doubted anyone else would, except maybe Hulk, a normal human would have no chance, hell, even a super soldier would… Tony froze as he recalled something.
It was only Steve’s quick reflexes that had him catching Zach about the waist that prevented him from running outside in just his pyjamas!
For a moment Steve contemplated going into the building and introducing himself to Stark, but he thought better of it right away. What would he say to the Omega? “I knew your Father seventy years ago, want to catch a game some time so I don’t have to be alone all the time?” Steve scoffed at himself and began the slow trudge back to his apartment which Shield had gotten for him. He needed to do something, needed to find something for himself, a job maybe, so at least he wouldn’t be stuck in four walls totally alone.
“Steve is requesting entry to the lab,” Friday asked, and yet another thing. Steve asked to be let in the lab, where Rogers had always demanded, like he had a right to be there.
Well no, okay, not a complete shit show, Tony’s program worked, Natasha, Fury, and Maria were all able to infiltrate the HQ using Veils which disguised them from Hydra and everyone else, Sharon didn’t have to hide her identity, neither did Agent Bobby Morse or the other operatives Fury had on base and they carefully switched off the security cameras to the hellicarriers giving Tony and Sam the opportunity to fly themselves and Steve past the guards and into the ships.
“I meant about Bucky.” Steve said and Tony looked up to meet Steve’s knowing eyes, “It wasn’t easy in the beginning for me my Bucky, getting him back was hard work.”
A dead silence followed this revelation, the journalists, the moderator, all of them stared at their image of Tony not wanting to be the first to speak since none of them knew what to say.
Natasha had gone back to DC for a few days and had apparently only just returned, bringing Sam and Clint with her.
“I just want to look at some of the Kevlar that Mamma makes.” Peter said to Jarvis, his cheeks flushing. He’d never been a good liar, not even to an AI. “I won’t damage anything he’s working on or mess anything up I swear.”
One month after the battle of New York, Avengers Tower, as Tony had taken to calling it, leaving just the A from the STARK left up on the side of the building, was open for business and for everyone to move in.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about the nightmares.” Tony said quietly as he lay over Steve’s chest, the echo of Steve’s steady heartbeat next to his ear,
“I know.” Peter whispered sniffling and wiping his nose on Tony’s shirt as he nodded his head, making Tony cringe, why did Kids have to be so filthy?
Matt, Sam, and Peter all gave Clint looks of varying sympathy at this and his own experience with being mind raped. Bucky grunted, looking up from the floor, which he was pacing like a caged tiger.
Slowly he recounted Thanos’ invasion in his world. How his forces had completely overwhelmed them, how one by one everyone had fallen, including the Avengers.
Zach giggled, “Dangly bits.” He said bouncing in his stool and looked eagerly at Steve who was cooking breakfast, the all important blueberry pancakes.
“She’s a grown woman and she can read minds, how could she not have known? There is no way that she didn’t pick up thoughts from at least one person there that would have tipped off that she was not working for Shield. There is no way she could have been in such close proximity to Strucker and not had at least some idea of what was really happening. No one is that stupid or naïve.”
The tour proved to be just as boring as Peter had thought it would be, the tech and everything way behind anything his Mamma had, the only thing different were the lab animals that Tony didn't have. This was wear disaster struck as the spiders that had been exposed to gamma radiation had gotten free of their tank while the class were present. Amid the screaming and panicking Peter got pushed over as frightened kids ran for the nearest exit, he was just scrambling back to his feet when he felt something on his ankle, without even thinking about it he tried to shake it off only to yelp in pain as something sharp sank into his flesh.
“Keep looking!” Steve bellowed diving back down into the water. Clint, also panting let out a choked sob before he dived again to continue searching the sea.
“Always Sir.” Jarvis replied, Steve was also wearing a com and could hear him too, as could the others.
“These bastard things better work.” He grumbled, “Especially since I’ve to pick out my wedding suit and start fittings.” That was going to be fun, ten pounds heavier and bloated, no doubt there would be the usual amount of fat shaming stories circling the internet.
When they stopped to get drinks and take a break, Clint picked up rocks and took aim at the coconuts managing to knock several loose which he put in his backpack for them to break open later.
“Right.” Tony agreed. “The academic kids can be encouraged and will flourish, and the less academically gifted can be tutored easier with less crowding in the classrooms, and they can be taught other skills.” He shrugged, “A kid might struggle with reading and writing but be brilliant with his hands and become an incredible engineer or architect.”
“I can’t blame them for being angry at me, can I?” he recalled his Tony saying, when some dickhead had decided to get mouthy when they had been out getting a burger. The jackass had been half pissed and stunk of beer and sweat, ignored the servers pleas for him to just leave the establishment, having refused him service since he didn’t have enough money on him to pay, and he’d started spitting out abuse, to which both Tony and Steve had told him to shut up, had risen to escort him off the premise before he stopped being a loud mouth and turned to violence, and upon seeing Tony Stark he had let loose a stream of abuse about Tony being a Mass Murderer, how he responsible for all the destruction that had happened, how Iron Man was just another way for him to cause devastation and that he didn’t deserve the title of Hero.
With it all going so well, Peter had decided to make Friday Night his regular patrol night. Of course this meant sneaking out of his bedroom and climbing down the side of the tower, but after the first couple of times he stopped being scared of doing so.
Keep his hand firm on the bullet hole in Tony’s back, Steve leant down so he could see Tony’s face that was half hidden between his shoulder and the floor. Even in the poor light Steve could see how pale Tony was, he could see a darkening around his eyes and mostly alarmingly the blood that was spilling out of Tony’s mouth as he took shallow breaths with painful effort.
Steve ran to window looking out at the retreating sight of Thor and Zach as they flew away. As the pair faded into the distance Steve’s legs gave out on him and fell to his knees breaking down into a flood of tears.
Tony squinted, “Extremis.” He said, “Yeah, I remember jotting that down, I can’t recall fuck all else after we got to the bedroom, but I do remember that.”
“Maybe.” Steve considered, and rolled his eyes as Sam called out that he was starving to death from the living area,
Peter nodded, “He slapped her face. I mean, not intentionally I don’t think, but when he turned back to her his hands were up and he caught her.” He looked imploringly at his parents, “I couldn’t stand it, I just had to do something, I couldn’t just sit there and let him and Flash hurt my friends.”
“Enough!” Natasha barked. “We don’t have time for this. Go and get your shit and get on the jet. We have to get the hell out of here before the Police come calling, and believe me, they will come calling.” When Steve looked ready to protest she employed a different tactic, “We can go and fine Barnes,” She said, in a softer tone,  “Take him somewhere safe.”
Thanos fell to his knees with a wounded cry, clutching at his stump, from behind him Thor charged, wielding Strom bringer and sliced off Thanos’ head.
“Me? Oh yeah I’m great.” Steve said and winced at how false that sounded, he wasn’t even surprised when Peter gave him a suspicious look.
Sadly the tree only remained upright for about half and hour; then Espresso and Gingerbread leaped into what they saw as their newest toy and soon had it over on the floor and were attacking the decorations and kicking the baubles around the floor.
Trevor glanced at Natasha who just smiled menacingly, he was not helped by the arrival of Clint either, who was wiping blood off his hands as he came in. Gulping Trevor began to explain how he had a problem with substances, (Yeah, no shit.) And how he’d ended up doing things on the streets for his fix.
Zach flinched as a door slammed open and he turned and looked to see Killian storming into the lab, his skin aglow and his eyes aflame. Zach gulped and tried to scoot as far away as he could get from the man, but the bands holding him to the gurney wouldn’t allow him to move more than an inch, he was pinned in place and could do nothing but cringe as Killian loomed over him.
“We’d have penny sweets when we could afford them and read comics, pretend we were gangsters on the run from the law, or soldiers guarding our base. Our mothers would be at their wits end with us coming home filthy, our shoes scuffed, and trousers torn.
They remained like that for a few moments before breaking apart to breathe, they stared at each other in stunned silence. Inevitably it was Tony who broke the silence with a question,
She could invade minds at will, not just reading them, but also manipulating them, making people see and feel their worst fears in vivid detail.
“Would you mind?” Steve asked, knowing that if she didn’t get her way, Lily would start crying in displeasure. Fortunately Tony took her happily, rising from his seat to bounce her, making the baby laugh in delight.
“Not completely no.” Tony admitted, “I’d need my lab to do that, but I should be able to get it functioning enough to contact Jarvis and offer a fair fight to Hydra.”
“Alright,” he said with a nod of his head, “Start the ball rolling, set the wheels in motion, and other words to that effect.” He grinned, “And what do you think about it, Lily-Bee?”
“Well, this isn’t how I wanted to spend my time in Miami.” Clint said, “I was hoping to sun bathe, maybe surf a few waves, check out a club or two…”
“Sub level two.” The man croaked. Steve let him fall to the ground and continued his decent, not bothering to look at the other floors. Natasha and the others could deal with them.
“What?” Tony gaped at his treacherous seven year old who beamed up at him with a far too innocent expression while Steve and Peter laughed at his expense. “Okay did you get replaced by a pod person while I was sleeping?” Tony demanded narrowing his eyes as he looked Zach over, “You are supposed to be on my side, you are supposed to say that Mamma is the most wonderful, sexy, super genius on the planet.”
His next posts on Facebook gave some basic details in how he coped waking up in the twenty-first century, how he was adapting and learning to live in the modern world.
“No, Christ you really haven’t a clue even though they are right in front of you.” Curien chuckled, “Talk about hiding in plain sight.” He grunted as Steve gave his shin a squeeze, “Alright, quite it you damn ape!”
The hole was right into Tony’s body, it was small probably only a fingers width but deep, so deep. He already knew it went all the way through and that there would be a wound ten times as large on the other side where the bullet had come out.
“Mind if I bring my suit in, I don’t like to leave it out in the open.” Tony said heading back over to the armour which had stopped sparking and was standing awkwardly, one side caved in, one boot and one gauntlet mangled.
“I don’t know, several weeks. Since Ultron I guess.” A mirthless smirk twisted Tony’s lips, “Maybe karma is catching up with me, my guilty conscience is haunting me.”
Steve opened his mouth to protest but he didn’t get a chance to speak as Deadpool leapt up from the couch with a loud cry of delight, “Captain hotpants and Iron Buns, God you two look delicious, it makes me want to smear ice cream all over you and lick it off!”
“I know we can’t. That you can’t. Because that’s who you are.” Pepper said, looking both nostalgic and thoughtful, “That was my mistake, I think. I thought that if I gave you a good enough reason to do it, that you could walk away from Iron Man. When I should have known all along, that Iron Man is a part of you. A part that I should have accepted and learned to love too.”
“Yeah, big man in a suit of armour, take that off and what are you?” Steve sneered at him, looming over him.
“You’re disowned.” Tony said, shouldering his way past Wade to go to the bedroom and put some clothes on,
Okay, maybe he was, but only a tiny bit, and if his jaw was protesting from him grinding his teeth then it was his business and his alone!
Tony shrugged, “I’ve had nightmares since New York, hell, some of them since Afghanistan. Fucking P.T.S.D.”
The shit really hit the fan after that, while Tony hadn’t meant to get involved with the fighting, he ended up having to do so anyway and had to make a made dash to catch Sam whose wings had been damaged and was free falling to the ground, sadly the third ship got into the air and worse still, Steve was on board fighting the Winter soldier.
He sat at the kitchen counter, watching as Steve carefully fed the little girl tiny pieces of banana and little drops of milk from a tea spoon.
Whimpering he tried again, tasting blood at the back of his throat as his body shuddered, the wetness was deeper now and spreading out, Tony could feel it under his chest, under his arms and on his face. He was in a pool of his own blood, was bleeding to death.
“I hope he is.” Tony said, “He’ll be better off away from his Father’s influence in the long run I think.”
These People would cluck their tongues at Peter, look at him with pity or scorn depending on their view towards children’s welfare.
“Yeah, why don’t you go and get Tony settled into your bed Cap?” Natasha drawled, emphasising Your Bed and bringing colour to Steve’s cheeks, “You can stare into each others eyes while I call Fury and get him to deal with Maximoff.”
“You can do as I was going to in Bern. Take that short cut straight on down and end it all. Or you can stay up here with me and burn.” Tightening his jaw Killian suddenly wrenched the glowing railing off the catwalk and tossed it down onto the burning factory floor below. “Just one step Tony and it all ends.” He said gesturing out to the billionaire.
“Incorrigible.” Steve said, sliding his fingers underneath Tony and inserting the first digit. Tony stiffened, biting down on his bottom lip. “Alright?” Steve asked,
“But continued to work with Hydra maintaining an alliance.” Tony said with a snort of disgust, “Honour among thieves. Or in this case genocidal maniacs.” Natasha hummed in agreement to the statement.
Natasha had tried to make a run for it, but an arrow struck her in the back of the knee bringing her to the ground, she tried to get to her feet but a blindingly swift attack from an almost blur of limbs knocked her gun from her hand, and disabled her bites. In a few second she was pinned against the wall by her throat and looking into Daredevils face.
Tony let out a breathy sob, tears rolling down his cheeks. It would be so easy to do as the voice said, to step out and end it all.
“Nat is hoping you choose her, she’d rather wear a Tux than a bridesmaid dress.” Clint called out, “Yo Stark, who is giving you away?”
“I want more Plum Tartine.” Winter piped up, making Bucky roll his eyes, of course, plum tartine was the priority. As he sat there Bucky became increasingly aware of his need to piss. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d been to the bathroom though it was definitely a while ago with how much his bladder was aching.
“That’s quite alright,” Steve said, understandingly, he looked over his shoulder, “They do not deserve you,”
Firstly Zach was in bed with Tony and Steve, and Peter. The two boys had snuggled in the middle while Tony and Steve lay either side of them. Thankfully the bed was King size, or they wouldn’t have fit. Steve’s broad shoulders took up a lot of space and Peter was a wriggler, his gangly limbs flopping each and every way as he slept.
This might also have something to do with Zach adopting him as a playmate, including him in his make believe games which also had the benefit of his becoming a frequent baby sitter, affording Tony and Steve some “Adult time.”
“Can I see Peter?” Ned asked worrying his bottom lip. “I’m not trying to get out of being grounded, but I’ve gotta see Peter and say sorry, I gotta know he’s okay.”
Tony awoke sore and aching from head to foot, his arm was throbbing and he couldn’t move his fingers much, they and his arm were mottled and ugly purple with bruising and were swollen. His throat was sore too, it ached when he swallowed and had it not been for the need to empty his bladder he’d have just curled back up and gone to sleep.
“Get back!” The Doctor snarled, “I’m warning you…” The scalpel dug into Peter’s throat drawing a little blood, “I will kill…”
It wasn’t until his legs gave out beneath him and he began his descent to the ground that his body registered the pain.
The asset shifted his gaze, looked at the photos of his targets. Stark, a dark haired Omega, threat level six according to Hydra, they had considered bringing him in and using him several times, but the Omega had proven too volatile after he’d escaped captivity at the hands of some terrorists, so now he was just to be eliminated on sight.
Curien shook his head, “I don’t think they are Hydra, I don’t know, maybe they have connection but Osborn never said anything about Hydra, and I never met anyone who was obviously working for them.”
“We don’t know if their calls are being monitored, we need to be careful, we can’t let Hydra find out where we are, at least not yet.” Steve slumped, he was no engineer, he didn’t know how to help Tony repair the armour and there really wasn’t much else for him to do right now.
It would be easy to blame the inevitable failure of this relationship on Steve Rogers, but really the blame will be on Tony Stark. He is in a position of power over Steve Rogers and whether knowingly or not, he is taking advantage of the Captain while he is still very vulnerable.
Steve’s nose wrinkled, “No, I’m not really a fan of the whole junior thing, I’d rather he had his own name.”
“Late.” MJ said, “Now, I’m gonna go and run into the park, give me a five minute head start and then follow me.”
Vision lowered down to the ground and solidified, while Rhodey remained on guard. “Where is everyone?” Rhodey asked, looking around, “Rogers, Romanoff, Maximoff?”
Bruce cleared his throat and stammered as he tried to answer the question, while wondering how it was possible that such adorable chocolate brown eyes seemed to pin him in place more than an academic board of assessors ever had.
“Right, thank you Doctor.” Tony said relieved it wasn’t anything more serious but also dreading keeping Zach from scratching once the itching started, time to file his sons nails right down so he wouldn’t hurt himself, and dig out some mitts for him to wear at night so he couldn’t scratch in his sleep.
Finally it was Clint and Natasha’s turn. Clint spoke of growing up in the circus, of his own abusive up bringing, how he’d found his way into the military and become a sniper, how Shield had recruited him and eventually how he’d met Natasha.
Most importantly, he could not afford to rush into anything for Lily’s sakes. What she needed was a stable home environment. That was what he had to focus on, not sexual desires. As intense as they maybe. Yes, it would be fabulous if something developed between himself and Tony, but if it did not then he would content himself with friendship and be the best friend he could possibly be.
Tony moaned and leaned into Steve’s massive body. He felt dwarfed by the sheer bulk of the other man. His hands were not wide enough to span the expanse of his muscles and the power coiled inside them was intoxicating. Tony knew that Steve could snap him in half without even breaking a sweat. He’d probably only need one hand to crush Tony’s throat and yet he was so gentle as he cradled him, his fingers tender almost revering.
As the Doctor continued to speak, saying something about motor function, bowel and bladder control, rehabilitation. Tony tried desperately to make his toes move. He poured all of his energy into making just one stupid toe wiggle, to jump, to do anything, but no, his toes might as well have been cut off for all the use they were, his legs too, laying limp and unresponsive.
“Fine,” He snapped, “Take him, but tell them only that he is ill, say nothing of the serum Maria, or I swear I will make you regret it.”
Steve had never asked a Father or a Guardian’s permission to court anyone before and was rather nervous when he finally came to asking Rhodey, who was rather taken aback by the request since Guardian Alpha’s no longer existed except in the cases of children and Pup’s being fostered.
“Jesus Tony.” Steve whispered. “Why would you do this to yourself, why wouldn’t you tell me you were doing this?”
“No, the Penguins and Polar Bears might get hurt!” Tony protested and laughed at the look of genuine confused astonishment that Vision gave him, “Arctic is not a great choice, human beings a freezing conditions don’t go well together, not even super humans.” Vision hummed in agreement at this and frowned,
“Come on kid, where are you?” Tony muttered scanning through the schematics. He could see plenty of heat signatures that were running through the place, a great gathering of others, some lower and some higher than the usual bio reading, they were not moving so Tony figured they were animals/hybrids.
“I still say we should go with an all America buffet.” Tony said, “I mean who doesn’t like burgers, hot dogs, and pizza?”
“It’ll be okay.” He said, “We can get through this, together.” This brought a smile back to Steve’s face and he interlocked his fingers with Tony’s.
“Brats.” Tony groused, shooting U a glare as the Bot began to Lord it over the other two since he still had full freedom. “It’d be easier rearing a pack of rabid rottweilers!”
Steve was determined to wait to court Tony until he had spoken to Rhodey, he was worried that the Colonel might not come to the tower for several weeks, being on active duty, but his fears were unnecessary as Rhodey showed up three days after their return from DC with forty eight hours leave to check on Tony, which granted Steve the opportunity to ask Rhodey’s permission to court the Omega Billionaire.
So Lily-Bee was just another adorable nickname to the list. He had his own for her too, Princess, and Little Star.
“We’ve got a Chicken burger over here for the munchkin.” Tony said, “And the single cheese burger.” He and Zach were sat besides the window doing maths together. With Zach out of school for the time being Tony didn’t want to neglect his education so he was educating his Son himself, today he’d been learning times tables and arithmetic, subtraction, and division.
Steve rose to his feet immediately alert to something being wrong with Tony. “You are aware that Sir’s relationship with his parents was strained at best?”
“I don’t know how to talk to people.” Steve mumbled, “The world has changed so much, everything I knew and was accepted in my youth is wrong now and I don’t know how to deal with that. I keep worrying that I’ll say or do the wrong thing and people will get upset or angry.
He had been sneakily adding to Steve’s wardrobe over the past months, adding shirts, jeans, slacks, even a couple of suits, which fitted like a glove. Apparently Jarvis was capable of taking body measurements so Tony had been able to get the clothing tailored to fit.
“Stay still.” Bruce admonished him, “You have a severe concussion and smoke inhalation, you are not leaving that bed for at least twenty-four hours, probably longer.”
Natasha and Bruce watched as he marched away, shoulders back and head raised as if he were going heading to war.
“You could have kept your hands out of Steve’s pants though.” Pepper said watching as film Tony slipped his hand down the front of Steve’s jeans, causing the soldier to turn scarlet and yelp in a very unmanly pitch.
Tony and Steve exchanged amused glances and the Captain went to have his own shower before joining the family on the bed for Dr Who and cookies.
“What, you to good to just use a phone and order now?” Rhodey called after him with laughter in his voice and Tony headed for the stairs, going back up into the main part of the house, nearly colliding with Happy who was handling a decidedly cranky Zach.
Before doing so, Steve searched the cupboards for some biscuits and set them on the table, helping himself to a white chocolate and cranberry cookie while Tony poured the water into the mugs and added generous helpings of honey before bringing them over to the table.
Tony screamed and screamed until his voice broke and he couldn’t make another sound. By which time silent sobs were shaking his body and he was blinded by the tears that were raining down his cheeks. He felt Steve wrapping him in a warm embrace and couldn’t resist burying himself into Steve’s broad chest and clinging to him like a life line.
Peter fired his web slinger at the ceiling and climbed up the webbing, spreading himself out above the door and stayed very still.
“You say that this weapon will only be used for Extra terrestrial threats. This Thanos and his army,” The German Representative asked, “What about the damage to Civilian property, to people, such a weapon will cause massive destruction, will it not?”
At that point the lift pinged and Steve, dressed in an Armani tux, stepped out and Tony’s mouth went drier than the Sahara in a heat wave. Dear God, he put James fucking Bond to shame in that suit. All broad shoulders and firm muscles and chiselled jaw line… Tony was going to die of blue balls, he knew it, there would be a headline tomorrow, Billionaire dies from blue balled related heart attack after seeing Captain sexy as hell in a tux.
“No,” Steve said, “This worlds Captain America is very much heterosexual and very clear on that subject and his feelings upon it.” He did not come right out and say that Rogers was homophobic, but anyone reading between the lines could guess at what he was hinting.
He worried about leaving fingerprints on the polished surfaces, of his trainers scuffing the marble lobby, felt horribly under dressed in his simple jeans, t-shirt, and plaid over shirt, (Which had Tony rolling his eyes at) Tony Stark did not do plaid, or khaki pants, or any of Steve’s (Old man and Kansas farm boy style)
The questions of Tony’s abilities as a parent infuriated Steve and had it not been for the whole team calming him down, Steve would likely have stormed the offices of the papers printing the trash and given their editors the dressing down of their lives.
“I like it better for a girl though.” Tony said, “I mean I know it can be a boys name but I prefer it for a girls name.”
Tony coughed and spat into the toilet bowl. He hated this, the side effects of the hormones he was taking. The symptoms of early pregnancy were common symptoms, and he was suffering all of them. Sore breasts, metallic taste in his mouth, nausea, vomiting, bloating, water retention, weight gain, and mood swings.
It was funny, being shot didn’t hurt right away. The first thing Tony felt as the nightmare images began to flicker away from his mind was a feeling like he’d been gut punched. All the air seemed to have been forced out of his body and he couldn’t manage to draw any back in.
Tony had endured many meals in such places for business reasons, he always found that the Alpha’s and the Beta men spoke and laughed too loud, as if they were trying to prove their strength by being the loudest in the room, the Omega’s and Beta women were always sat stiffly besides their partner, smiling with false smiles that had too many teeth, their posture would never slump in the chair, they would never sit back to relax it was always sat stiffly bolt upright or at an angle so no flesh rolls could be caused by a slouch.
“To get Spider-baby signed up to the super-sexy-super powered club.” Deadpool replied, “Why else? Did you think I just stopped by to check out your ass?” he paused and looked into space speaking as if to an audience, “Of course I stopped by to do that too, but you should never give away all your secrets at once.”
“Jasper Sitwell, there was several inconsistencies regarding him, and Brock Rumlow.” Fury added, “There are more of course, but these seem to be the main contenders.”
“Absolutely.” The Black Widow said her smile promising broken limbs if Tony tried to leave the bed before Bruce was back with the wheelchair.
“We’ll see Mamma later honey.” Steve said hating himself as he further distressed Zach by turning and carrying him out of the hospital room, resulting in Zach screaming like he was being murdered.
He closed the storage bin and took a deep breath, jumping when Dumm-E beeped at him, “Its bedtime buddy.” He said to the bot giving him a pat, “You and your brothers go and get some rest, I’m heading for some rest myself.”
"Of course." Tony said, "Everyone will be in to see you. Screw hospital rules, you need your family around you and they all need to see you."
Biting his bottom lip Peter scanned the room looking for somewhere to hide. All of the cages were clear and there was no space in them to hide anyway, the air vents were too small, he’d never fit into them and there were no drains that he could see, which left one place.
“Right.” Tony said letting her usher him out of the shop, “Pep, what would I do without you?” He asked her?
Tony gave Natasha and Clint a floor to share and Sam moved into the guest room on Steve’s floor. Tony said that he’d get them individual floors given time, but no one was upset about the arrangement, especially since the floors, while being shared, were three times the size of a normal apartment and far more luxurious than any of them could afford.
“Maybe we can work something out.” He said looking up at the others and found himself smiling at the hope that bloomed on Steve’s face. “I’ll get my lawyers on it, let the overpaid bastards work for their money for once.”
“Of course.” Steve said resigned to the madness of Avengers Tower, his eyes narrowed as he noticed something on the range, “Why is my shield there?”
Well, the worst had happened for Steve. He had lost everyone but Lily, had nothing and no one left. Had it not been for this realities Tony being as Kind and generous as his own had been, then he didn’t know what he would have done. He also did not want to rock the boat, so to speak. He had no idea what Tony felt, if he had any feelings towards men at all in fact. Yes, he was supportive of LGBTQA, but that didn’t mean he was bi-sexual, only that he was supportive, and even if he was Bi, that did not mean that he would fancy Steve, he may not be this Tony’s type, and he didn’t want to make things awkward between them.
“We’ve got an idea.” Tony told him excitedly, “To defeat the mother fucker and keep the civilian populations out of the line of fire.”
Zach, always Peter’s shadow, stuck to Peter’s side as he and Harley explored the new Workshop. It didn’t take long before the three of them were testing out the Mark II, denting food cans and mink cartons, the only thing Grace protested against was when they fired at the walls so they could see the potatoes explode.
Natasha opened her mouth to speak but webbing slapped over her lips silencing her, then more wrapped about her wrists forming cuffs to restrain her.
Tony screamed and sobbed as Steve wrenched the shield back up, but he couldn’t stop the soldier from slamming it back down, shattering his femurs and pulling it back up with a spray of blood then bringing it back down again, severing Tony’s legs from the rest of his body.
“Oh.” Tony said, “I thought you were going to ask if you could drive the Ferrari to school or something.”
“Right.” Happy agreed with a smile, “Well, what wasn’t know up until recently, was that they hadn’t been destroyed back in the forties but had gone into hiding. You Mamma and the Avengers have been working to expose them and destroy them for good. But it seems that Hydra have decided to strike first.”
Steve growled as the heady scent filled his nostrils and caught Tony about the waist, flipping them over so the Omega was beneath him. Tony whined and wrapped his thighs about Steve’s waist bucking his hips and grinding his sex against Steve’s. The Alpha caught the Omega’s wrists and pinned them behind his head, holding Tony down and growled in warning as Tony nipped playfully at his wrist. With his free hand he lifted Tony’s pelvis and positioned himself at the gushing entrance to Tony’s body, thrusting inside him in a single fluid motion that had Tony keening and arching beneath him, the inner muscles of Tony’s body clamping down on his cock and spasming as he beneath move in and out.
After four hours Tony awoke again and this time got onto his hands and knees giving Steve plaintive mewls and doe eyes glances over his shoulder until the Alpha mounted him and fucked him into the soiled bedding, then lay over him as Tony shivered and squirmed on his knot, he stroked Tony’s hair and kissed his skin, his tongue tracing over the bonding gland he longed to sink his teeth into but resisted, and rested, waiting for the next wave.
“I am.” Peter said earnestly, “For all of the trouble I’ve caused, and I promise this will never happen again.”
“But he has been in love with a Stark, and is now dwelling with another Stark. No good can come of that.”
He spun around and turned his attention upon the scientist, “You have the test subjects ready?” He asked.
Zach nodded and burrowed down under his cover with his eyes screwed tightly shut as if he was willing himself to fall asleep as fast as possible. Tony kissed his head and wished him good night, turning off the light as he left the room, going back to the common room to wait for Zach to fall asleep before everyone got the Christmas gifts and put them under the tree for the following morning. Peter joined in; he was too old to believe in Santa so he could help out the adults getting ready for Christmas day.
“I can.” Tony replied raising his chin defiantly, “I am Tony fucking Stark. I am Iron Man. I am a billionaire genius, and if I want to sue every bastard who owns a tabloid, works for a tabloid, or puts comments on social media, then I damn well will!”
Steve considered it, “Yeah, go on.” He said, “Thor cut off anyone who tries to escape, Sam, pick up any strays, and Bruce,” He looked at the Doctor, “Wait in the jet and guard those Sam and Thor bring back, we won’t call you in unless necessary.”
Tony pressed a kiss to Zach’s head and held him tighter. “He’s gone, Stellina, he can never hurt either of again.”
“Where’s Mamma?” Peter asked in a hushed voice, “And does his location have anything to do with why we’re not allowed to go outside and why there are two hundred reporters camped out in front of the Tower?” (He’d been out on the landing pad and seen the reporters down there.)
“His spine may have been injured,” Bruce continued to explain to Thor, “The slightest jolt could compound the injury, we can’t risk it, so we do this as carefully as possible.”
“You’d like to sign up with the team we’re assembling?” Steve asked Spiderman who nodded enthusiastically,
“I have no idea what you are talking about. Human experimentation? Animal yes, and I know Animal Rights activists hate me for it, but I would never….”
Tony half sat up and watched Steve with hooded eyes, “We should totally roll play more often.” He said making Steve grin, “Maybe I can be a super-villain who you have to capture and give a full search. A very. Thorough. Search.”
Sound wasn’t the only thing that was amplified, Peter found that his skin was extra sensitive. He could feel each individual fibre of the sheets over him, the scratchy material of the hospital gown. His sense of smell was sickening too. He could smell so much, too much.
“Don’t wanna go back in chair, or cold box.” He shook his head violently, “Don’t wanna hurt no more.” Tony’s forehead creased in sympathy for him,
“Damnit,” Norman grumbled, reaching up to turn on the lights, revealing the silenced gun he was holding, “Now then…”
“Yep, the evil Witches spell gets broken when you rescue me and Peter and Zach turn back into kids and stop being animals.”
Steve might not know Tony that well yet, but from what he’d seen of him so far he knew Tony’s genius far exceeded Howard’s, one could say that Tony had the benefit of better technology to work with, but that was only half the story as he invented technology so he could create, where Howard had relied on others to build so he could develop from there.
“You killed her parents!” This was said in desperate, almost petulant tone. As if Rogers was scraping at the very bottom of the barrel for some way to win this argument.
“We hit the ground running.” Natasha said, “Kill anything that moves. Wanda, you take the perimeter, clear a path into the base, Sam, Rhodey, take out any air support they might have, Friday, find any weapons systems and disable them. Clint, get to whatever high ground to can and cover our asses, Vision, you faze into the building, find Tony, disable or kill any Hydra asshole near him, Steve, you and me will handle the ground teams and get into that base.”
“No, but you are a super soldier whom Shield are interested in having working for us on one of our strike teams.” Fury said, “As far as anyone is concerned you are here so Agent Romanoff and I can sweet talk you into joining. In actuality I wanted you here to be added protection for Stark and to see for yourself what we’re up against so that when the shit does hit the fan you won’t be going in blind.”
Spideyman. Spiderling. Peter was going to have a lot of nicknames and be called by them a whole lot.
Peter’s eyes widened and he sat up, staring at Tony, “Really? We’d live here?” He gazed around at the huge mansion which was twice the size of Tony’s own mansion.
The guy made another gagging noise as Peter moved him to the edge of the bed and suddenly a wave of black vomit that stank to high heaven poured out of the poor man’s mouth, splattering over Peter’s outfit. The guy fell froward off the bed and began to violently convulse, more and more of the black fluid oozing out of his mouth as he writhed on the floor.
“Not doing that, knob head!” MJ yelled knocking the phone from Flash’s hand, she looked worriedly to Ned, unsure of what to do as neither of them had ever seen Peter like this before.
Stunned and confused Tony looked up from where he landed and saw to his horror and amazement Zach stepping out of the armour his skin ablaze with amber and fists aflame.
“Autopsy, but I’m not….” Peter didn’t finish his sentence, instead he let out a scream as the scalpel sank deep down into his flesh, all the way to the bone and was drawn down his chest.
Their mouths dropped open, their eyes bugged out, and they gaped at the larger, older version of Captain America.
“Ask if he wants to go.” Steve said getting to his feet and going to get his shorts and a T-Shirt and trainers. “We’ll take a run through central park, and maybe going and hit a fast food joint on the way back, bring Tony back a burger or something.”
Pausing mid rant, Tony stuck his head out of the shower to see Steve in the bathroom. He paused and wondered if he should check the water temperature since it seemed that he heat had just shot up.
Vaguely Steve was aware of Peter besides him, the pre-teen taking his hand, interlocking their fingers as he too stared at the screen in disbelief.
Picking the tree up and replacing the decorations soon became a regular activity, as did removing a squirming and protesting kitten from within the branches.
"He finally fucking did it!" had been Natasha's yell throughout the penthouse when Tony and Steve had called them, the team were still up, waiting for New Year to arrive in New York.
“And leave me with his corpse all over my desk I shouldn’t wonder.” Fury said as he came in with Hill following behind him. He looked at them both, “You are the only ones here?”
Rogers had been trying to get in touch with Tony for weeks. Ever since that first press conference where that other “Him” had gone and declared himself homosexual, Rogers had been coming under a hell of a lot of fire from the Press and the LGBTQA.
When they had been ten Sokovia had been in the grips of a civil war that had torn the country apart. A bomb which had been bearing Stark's name had dropped onto their house killing their parents. The twins had been burried in the rubble for two days staring at the name Stark and developing a natural hatred for the name and the man it reprisented.
“I know, I know its going to be alright.” Pepper said “I know you’ll get through this, I just hate seeing you hurt.” She squeezed him tighter and let out a couple more sobs before she got control of herself and stood up, wiping her face. Tony kept hold of one of her hands and squeezed it smiling at her.
Showing that he had a sense of humour and didn’t mind playing the fool, earned him points with the press and would also with the public. People liked to see those they looked up to laughing at themselves and showing that they were human and normal.
Curien glared and looked back to Tony, “Osborn isn’t working alone, this wasn’t even his idea, not originally, he was approached by others who wanted to use his resources.”
“Looking good Cap.” Natasha said, “I’ll give this for Stark, he has excellent taste in both clothing and Alphas.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, at least making the effort not to laugh. Besides him Peter yawned and blinked owlishly looking adorably disoriented. Tony’s head popped up from the side of the bed and he glared at Zach.
“You are very welcome to stay in the tower with us.” Tony said, “You have a place with us and maybe you can find your Path here. In fact you are all welcome.” He said, addressing, Darcy, Jane, and Eric Selvig.
Bruce was filmed doing yoga, tai chi, and body weight exercises, and some light jogging on the treadmills.
“Jarvis, you better have a damn good excuse for this.” Tony growled as he staggered to the suit and climbed in quickly taking control.
“I know.” Tony said shooting Peter a concerned look, but there was also a hint of anger there. “So what happens now?” He asked, “Your office said a weeks suspension?”
Steve snickered and kissed his cheek, “You certainly do. But how about we have a little warning next time, okay?”
“I’m getting there.” Tony said, “Its still making my arms hurt but I’ve been assured that as I gain strength in my arms and shoulders the pain will pass.”
He thought the caption (Cap got your tongue?) would do quite nicely, even if both Pepper and Rhodey would kill him for it.
“DEADPOOL!” Tony shrieked, “He’s a raving lunatic, a deranged, demented, psychopath, who dresses like a garish sex doll, never stops talking, and has a habit of skewering people!”
“I’ll be fine,” Tony said without turning around, held out a hand to Bucky, offering it to him in friendship, “Please?”
“And we have a the medlab fully stocked with everything that might be needed, antacids, anti nausea tablets, painkillers, stomach pumps, epinephrine, sticking plasters, anti-septic, tourniquets, stored blood, stitches?”
Rhodey, Pepper, and Happy were Tony’s next visitors, Pepper and Happy were uncertain and tense having had no experience of dealing with a permanently disabling injury, Rhodey on the other hand had dealt with plenty of them, he’d seen many airmen suffer similar injuries, or amputations and had learned how to deal with it and relax.
Be anything less than fully clothed outside of their private quarters. (Emphasis on this to Thor and Tony) as Thor forgets that humans are rather “Prudish” on some things in comparison to Asgardians. Tony just likes shocking people.
“I do.” Steve said raising his chin in his usual, I am Captain America and I am not taking any of your bullshit manner. “You are going to say something like, “I don’t have to do this,” or, “You should walk away Steve, I’ll only be a burden to you.”
“I didn’t know he’d do that.” Maya cried, she shook her head, “I needed the money to fund the research.” She looked accusingly at Tony, “Stane said Stark Industries would help but he…”
The cold air in the lab made the infant whimper, he began to wriggle and his face creased as began to cry in distress.
The asset watched as the man made a phone call and got himself an alcoholic drink, he didn’t offer the asset anything, no one ever did. All he got was water and some dense chewy bar of very sweet and sticky oats. He didn’t remember what food tasted like, if he had ever known.
Steve snorted and shook his head, while Sam murmured that in some language that word vomit might have made sense.
“Unlikely.” Natasha relied, “He has a good head start, he’s probably already been enveloped back into the arms of Hydra. If we had known of him the day he ran then maybe we could have traced him, but after so long….”
“Well, we defeated them at Shield and threw a large cog in their works, but I doubt that was the only cell of Hydra.” Tony said, “We’ll probably have to fight them again and again for a while.”
“Screw it!” Steve clucked his tongue at the boys language but moments later he heard a rustling sound, “Here, breathe into this.” The boy was saying, “A kid at school has attacks like this and she gets paper bags to breathe into.”
“Uh huh, before or after you’ve already launched?” The Omega drawled, “You know, I think George Orwell had something to say about this kind of thing coming to pass, and if I recall, it wasn’t complimentary.”
Wiping his cheeks Peter stood back so Steve could say goodbye, but first he gently pried Zach away from his chest, “Do you want to say goodnight to your Mamma?” Steve asked the little boy.
They all got an early night, knowing that Zach would be up early, his excitement would have him up practically at dawn and then there would settling him until after he’d seen what Santa had bought during the night.
“What happened?” Rogers asked, as horrified as the young man, Sam, Steve thought his name was, at the mention of Steve’s earths destruction.
Wanda would watch impassively as her victims smashed their heads into the walls until they were split open. Or clawing their own eyes out of the sockets so they couldn't see the images she had placed into their minds anymore, one even bit open his own wrists before swallowing his tongue.
“Isn’t that a little mean?” Steve asked as he zipped up their tent flap and crawled into the sleeping space where Tony was stripping down to…..nothing?
“It’s your powers isn’t it, you are worried about them making you too different, that even though your friends have accepted you, you are worried that their acceptance might only be temporary, that they might condemn you for being a freak or something.”
“No.” Steve chocked out as tears began to spill down his cheeks, “You don’t be sorry, you don’t need to be sorry. You’re going to be fine, you’re getting out of here and we’ll take you to a hospital and it’ll be fine.” He tightened his grip on Tony’s hand as if he could prevent death from taking Tony away simply by gripping onto him.
“Christ he’s just a kid.” The Paramedic’s partner said feeling for a pulse, “He’s alive but his pulse is weak, we need to get him to a hospital now.”
“No, you are just going to do something that gives me a heart attack.” Tony said, “Now go on, get out of here, you’ve got homework to do, and I don’t mean inventing manmade spider silk.” Tony had urged Peter on out of the lab so he could clean up and get back to work.
Both Pepper and Rhodey had been furious when they had been told of Howard’s actions and what had been done to Tony. Had Howard been alive then they would have both torn him limb from limb, skinned him, and boiled anything that remained in oil. They had tried to comfort Tony, tried to make him see that this changed nothing, that they loved him regardless but Tony would have none of it, turning his back on them and refusing to speak.
The press parted so Tony and Steve could head for the car, several more photos and news coverage was taken of them as was their getting into the car.
“Indeed.” Jarvis agreed, “It may be prudent for you to practise the movements with the braces outside of the suit before adding them to the interior.”
Tony was broken out of his staring when this new Steve looked up at him, his face creased with worry, “She’s hungry, I don’t have any food for her,”
Closing his eyes Tony sighed heavily, “I like to think that we’d have met anyway, with or without Loki and his bat shit crazy.”
Peter grinned and ruffled Zach’s curls, everything was so simple for him, “Because they’re dorks!” He said, “But they’ll figure it out sooner or later I’m sure.”
“Now Harry.” Osborn barked at his son, then glared at the Detective, “I want my lawyer,” He spat, “And I will be taking your badge for this insult.”
Steve lowered Tony down onto his feet and the three wavered uncertainly for a moment until the driver of the car got out and shouted for them to get down as she aimed a hand gun and fired at the Hydra agents following them, when the clip was spent she shouted at them to get in the car, ducking back into the driving seat.
“You can’t hide in here all day.” MJ sighed sounding disgusted, well, who could blame her, the boys toilets stank to high heaven, she didn’t even want to think about what the did in them to make them stink so much.
“Nothing wrong?” Tony whispered, he pointed to the ceiling, “You just risked your life jumping off there, you could have broken your neck and all because you wanted to show off.”
“I wonder what other stuff I can do though.” Peter mused. “Super senses, and super strength, what else…”
Tony burst out laughing at Steve’s double entendre. Rogers never engaged in flirtatious banter like this, nor stood so close to him and gazed at him with relaxed ease. Rogers was always stiff when he was around Tony (No pun intended) where everything with this Steve was different to how it was with Rogers, easier and far more relaxed. It was wonderfully refreshing.
“Oh baby, no.” Tony said, grinning brightly, “Brucey-bear’s is my Science boyfriend, we only have professional and scientific schmoozing, it is completely different to the unadulterated, wild, and super crazy feelings I have for you.”
“Congratulations Mr Stark it’s an Omega Boy.” The Doctor said wrapping him in a towel and handing him to Tony who was sobbing too much to speak, Pepper was no better and Happy was struggling to hold back tears too, even Rhodey looked misty eyed as they beheld the red and wrinkled newborn in Tony’s arms.
Pepper sighed and trailed a hand through Tony’s hair. She wouldn’t mention the slight tremors that were running through Tony’s body, nor the tears that were seeping into her blouse. Tony rarely if ever let anyone see him cry, he preferred to hide it from view, having been well taught by Howard that crying was something that only babies did, not Men, not Stark Men.
Zach sniffed, “Did I do something wrong?” He asked timidly and Steve’s heart shattered at the question.
Tony was inundated with demands for interviews, photoshoots, soundbites, TV segments, everything. But all he wanted was to focus on getting things ready for the Pup and working on his suits.
“Peter.” Tony called out but the teen wasn’t listening as he began to climb the wall and up onto the ceiling, looking down at the others upside down.
He also impressed everyone by scorching the ground by his feet and making a fireball appear in his palm which he snuffed out as he closed his fist.
“We’re fine,” Steve called back, knowing that Tony wouldn’t want anyone to see him like this. He held his breath, praying that she would leave, after a few seconds he looked back to Tony who was staring at him in shock.
"Because he doesn't want brain defective retards roaming around our home." Peter shot back with speed that would have made Natasha proud. He gave Flash a grin that he'd seen his Mamma use on the Paps, "That's why he only allows MJ and Ned to come by, no peasants."
“Gimme a sec for to regain use of my limbs and I’ll return the favour.” However Steve shook his head,
“Dear God,” Sam whispered, looking sickened. He wasn’t the only one. Looking around, the rest of the Avengers looking as horrified by Steve’s tale as Sam did. Even Tony, who had already heard the story.
“Then we wait.” Natasha pulled back onto the plastic chairs and sat down, stretching out her feet in front of her, “And be ready to move out the second there is news.”
Peter was snuggled up against Tony, his head buried into the crook of Tony’s neck and one of his arms flung up and over Tony’s head!
Wanda was partially tempted to go to Prague, to forget the idea of going to America and to just go to Prague and take her revenge on Stark.
Aside from that embarrassment, Peter was left feeling exhilarated and powerful. It had been childs play to stop the muggings and the drunks, none of them had known how to fight, not properly, they’d thrown wide arched punches at his head which he would have been able to dodge even if he didn’t have fast reflexes. With the training he’d been getting from Steve and Natasha, Peter was able to flip them onto their backs and secure them to the nearest solid object without even breaking a sweat.
Tony had died trying to shield civilians from a falling building, that Thanos’ forces had destroyed. With his armour badly compromised from battle, it didn’t stand up to the force of the falling rubble and Tony was crushed beneath the debris.
Eventually the two decided to stick together and began to attack the finger food on the trays that the servers were carrying while sipping at the champagne.
Before any of them could react Wanda was lashing out with her powers but before she could strike Vision was between her and the team, the Mind Stone glowing in his head, absorbing her power.
He cried out as he hit the road and forced himself to roll over, struggling to his hands and knees. Clasping his bleeding stomach with his good hand he forced himself to his feet and staggered to the pavement, something whizzed past him then another thing, and another. Norman was shouting and swearing again obviously trying to finish him off, but was thankfully a bad shot.
“Fair enough, but you might get some backlash for it. I don’t know how things were in your world, but in this one, not all views are positive on LGBTQA.” Tony said, “And you practically accused your “Little brother” of being homophobic.”
Zach was upset, he didn’t understand why Peter had gotten so mad and didn’t like that he’d be separated from his brother for a week. When it was time for Peter to go back to his room after dinner, Zach began to throw a tantrum, crying and demanding that Peter stay with and play with him.
Steve sighed, “Well I suppose it depends on the situation and the parents. Grounding a kid is a common method of punishment, usually it involves them not being allowed to go out with their friends for a period of time, and not leaving home except to go to school or to necessary appointments like to a Doctors or something.” Steve explained, “In Peter’s case at the moment he’s not going out with his friends anyway because of his senses still being so high, but we still need to discipline him for his actions. Not letting him have full internet access and having him stay in his room for a week except for meals will achieve this.” Steve didn’t want to go into all the details of how parents disciplined their children, how in his day it was considered perfectly acceptable for a child to be caned or beaten with a belt, even teachers caned children back then and no one thought anything of it. Spanking a child’s backside had been acceptable for a long time too and some considered a light tap on the backside to be an acceptable form of punishment, while others used such things as a Naughty Step or Naughty Corner where the child went for time out.
Poor Zach, he had no idea what was happening or why it was happening, with his brother in hospital hurt things were bad enough, but being told he wasn’t allowed to go to school because he was different was too cruel.
“I love you.” Steve corrected, reaching out to cup Tony’s chin and lift his face so they were making eye contact again, “I love you Tony, I want to be with you, I want to court you or date you, or whatever the term is,”
“Go to hell!” Rogers spat. He rubbed his jaw again and headed for the exit, seething over Tony once again getting the last word.
Banner offered a small smile, “Oh I wouldn’t have come on board if I couldn’t handle a few pointy things.”
Chuckling lightly Steve settled down and spooned around Tony, as he closed his eyes he imagined himself holding a pregnant Tony in his arms and let the images guide him into sleep.
“Can we go camping on the beach?” Peter asked, “And make a camp fire on he beach and make s’mores?” He’d heard several of the kids at school talk about doing that and going camping with their family and was keen to try it himself. “It’s a teacher training day on Friday, so we can fly out Thursday night and spend Friday, Saturday, and Sunday on the Island and come back Sunday evening.”
“Okay, breathe!” Rhodey said taking Tony by the shoulders and shaking him a little to get his attention, “First off, why would Steve move to Canada? Secondly, you are not fucked up, thirdly, he won’t hate you, he already adores you so you don’t need to worry about that, and you are not that much older than he is.”
Tony tried to make up for this by focusing a lot of attention on his bump himself, talking to the Pup in English, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Greek, Dari, and Farsi. The eight languages he was fluent in, he also threw in sentences from the languages he could get by in, Russian, Portuguese, Mandarin, and Japanese. He’d play music to the Pup too, classical seemed to settle the pup when Tony wanted to sleep and was being kicked in the kidneys, pop made him or her wriggle like crazy as if he or she were dancing to the beat, and heavy metal or rock had strong thumps against belly even outlines of tiny hands appearing.
“Do you have reason to think that?” Steve asked her, placing a hand on Tony’s tense shoulder. He knew his lover was blaming himself even thought it wasn’t his fault in the least.
Fury and Maria took Wanda into custody and she was extradited back to Sokovia to face trial for terrorism, as a base line human she was now not a threat to anyone as the Scarlet Witch and no longer had the protection of the Avengers or Tony’s formidable legal team to save her from prosecution.
“We need to get him out of the bathroom.” Bruce said, “Steve can you lift him?” Mutely Steve did just that, helping Tony up and supporting his weight as May grabbed a towel to wrap about him to preserve Tony’s modesty.
“Hmm, that doesn’t look okay.” Fury said having turned back from the window, “The rash on your neck, your sudden decision to start giving away your stuff, up dating your will, all leads me to conclude that you are a very sick man.”
Tony was wearing his colours, his symbol, and they were in public, and would be spending the night on the beach with two children.
Once the tents were erected and the airbeds and sleeping bags were put inside, Steve sent the boys to collect firewood while he and Tony moved the cooler into the entrance of their tent along with the packaged food and the water containers.
“Both actually.” Tony admitted, “At first I was kidding but now I think about it, why not?” He asked her, “We put Undergrads through College, why not educate kids ourselves at earlier ages?”
Tony whimpered and clutched his chest looking stricken and Phil and Pepper, “What did I do to deserve such abuse?”
“This is not your business. Why don’t you go back to your world, huh?” A twisted sort of humour stretched over Roger’s face, “You say that your world was destroyed, well how do we know that is the truth? We only have your word for it. Maybe you’re on the run, maybe you kidnapped that baby from her real parents and sang your sob story at Stark to get his sympathy, or, maybe he’s in on it” Roger’s looked to Tony, sneering at him, “What’s in it for you Stark? Was the fact I saw through you bullshit too much take so you had to go and find yourself a lesser version of me to make your boy toy?”
Kovarian took a single step back and lifted the carry cot higher, “If I drop her, her skull will shatter on the ground,” He said, grinning at Vision, “She will die before she is even an hour old, is that what you want?”
“We’ll get him the best legal team and Doctors.” Tony assured him, “He won’t be left for the wolves I promise.”
Zach giggled as he hid behind Dumm-E, the bot beeped menacingly and waived his fire extinguisher in warning at Butterfingers and U, Butterfingers was wielding a mop angrily and U was tossing random items of fruit and veg. From above them Clint could be heard cackling and every so often he would hang out of the vents throw wet toilet tissue down onto the bots and Zach.
“Cool.” Peter agreed happily following Steve, keen to get to burning some of his pent up energy and hopefully deal with some of his anxiety, and to get to the reward of junk food after.
The rest of the team did the same, laying out blankets to sit on and getting out the food for the picnic. For a while they all enjoyed eating and sitting in the shade while the sun was at it’s peak, then, after they’d digested Clint stripped off his shirt and shorts, revealing his swimming trunks and ran at the edge of the cliff with a deafening yell, leaping over the side to dive down into the sea below.
“Is this even going to be made public knowledge?” Tony asked, “Are the people Shield are proposing to protect going to have a say in this?” He knew the answer without Fury saying anything and scoffed, “No wonder Hydra found such a cosy home here.”
Six hours were what it took for Tony to get Bucky released into his and Steve’s custody. Matt had been on the phone with the authorities while flying over with Sam and Vision, and made the case for Bucky to be extradited to America as soon as Tony’s business with the UN was complete. After a lot of legal debating and persuading he managed to get Bucky freed from the Police cell, and into the Avengers Custody by midnight, with all of them standing responsible should Bucky attempt to flee.
They had only a couple of working channels on the box TV they had, and no books to read, so late at night, going to bed was their only option, even if it meant laying in the dark for hours on end bored and restless but not sure of what else they could do.
Laying in her bed, Wanda’s eyes snapped open and red energy dissipated around her. This had been the most intricate nightmare yet.
“My pleasure.” And Steve did proceed to just that, making sure Tony was far beyond words for the rest of the night and most of the following morning.
Tony rolled his eyes at Zach’s pouting and puppy dog eyes, cursing the fact he was pushover for his kids pleading and nodded his head. But was rewarded with a huge hug and several kisses from Zach so it was well worth it.
Steve stared at Natasha, half amazed she had read him so clearly and annoyed that she had been able to do so.
“And this is of all the team.” Zach said proudly as he displayed a picture of Iron Man, a huge green thing that was Hulk, a red, white, and blue thing that was Captain America, a shiny gold and red thing with a hammer that looked more like a mallet that was Thor, a black blob with red flowing down its back that was Natasha, and a purple thing with a bow that was Clint.
“But I could have walked away after Vanko.” Tony said, “I should have seen it as a warning for what was to come, the danger my family were in.”
“I’d appreciate that.” Tony said with a smile, he then looked to Pepper who was fighting tears, “Pep…”
Silently he rose and made his way to the nearest bathroom, ignoring the looks that followed him from Thor and Bruce, the slightly awed, slightly frightened looks from other people waiting in the waiting room for news of loved ones.
A growl rattled in Steve’s chest, and he moved to add his own bulk to the protective shield Tony was creating for Lily, and by doing so, protected Tony too.
“So there is something there.” Steve said frowning at the image, “Can you show me the camp again?” Tony brought the image back up and Steve pointed to one of the sheds, “That was the way down to the labs.” He said his finger just shy of touching the holograph, “There was a lift that went straight down, the whole Shield base was under the camp.”
“Like this.” Peter said demonstrating how it was done for Thor, “You hold them near the flames, let the heat get to them and then when they are crisp all the way around they are done.” He handed Thor a perfectly toasted marshmallow which the god happily put between biscuits and chocolate munching appreciatively.
He knew he had made the right choice when he saw Tony beam at the surrounds, relaxing completely as he sat at their table and began to look over the menu.
Tony immediately held out his hands for Lily making a soppy expression, “Aww baby, what’s the matter eh? What’s wrong, did the stupid canary bird not make you smile?”
“Let me speak to your Dad first and then I’ll give you an answer.” Tony said, “And don’t stay up beyond midnight, you might not be going into school but that doesn’t give you a free pass to be up all hours.”
Tony smiled and let out a sigh of relief, “Good job big guy.” He said, squeezing Bucky’s hand a little, “Okay, just keep your other hand where they can see it and don’t struggle.” He advised as the Police came closer. “It’s fine fellers, the Sergeant is cooperating, but he is very nervous and distressed, so please don’t do anything to make this worse.” Tony said to the Police, “I’m going with him to whatever station you decide to take us too and I am calling my lawyers.”
Clint had gone back to his family, no one knew where Bruce was, Thor had gone back to Asgard, and Tony had gone back to New York.
“Really? Who names their kid Eugene, no wonder he ended up with such a shitty nickname, not like my Petey-pie!”
“Bastard.” Steve growled snapping off the TV before he did break it. Damn Ross and his condescending bullshit, the bastard had better hope he didn’t run into Steve anytime soon or he'd be suffering his own “Fall” and Steve would be hard pressed to ever let him get back up.
Steve straightened up, his eyes remained on Morgan and were swimming with sadness even as he tried to remain stoic. “A life on the run is no life for a baby.” He said, his voice shaking, Tony met his gaze, his own eyes shining with tears. “I can’t do that to her.” Steve whispered, “I won’t do that to her, she needs a home, stability, and I… I can’t give her that.”
Tony jumped and whirled around, glaring at Steve, “Don’t do that.” He snapped, putting his phone away.
“Why are you here?” Steve asked, helping Tony to extract Deadpool from his side and took Lily back from Spiderman.
Steve chuckled and watched as Tony argued with Zack about the necessity for variety in the diet and how Blueberry pancakes or any pancakes were not healthy to eat every single day. Zack it seemed was quite the picky eater, as children often were. He despised practically anything green except for sugar snap peas and leeks. He did like most fruits though, only having an aversion to kiwis because he found the hairy skin scary, and cherries because he was allergic.
It was only Natasha who met them and took them to Fury’s office, Clint was on a ten day leave and she wouldn’t say where he was, only that he was dealing with some personal stuff.
“Maybe.” Tony said a wry smile curving his lips, “I might have been taking Zach and Pete for an early morning walk. Or perhaps we’d have been going to the park and while they played I would take a seat on a bench and you’d be there sketching or something.”
Steve looked surprised at the difference there and smiled, “Anthony Edward Stark, that I am in love with you for who you are, just as I was for who Anthony Gregory Stark was, and while I will always miss him and mourn his loss, I would not trade you for him nor wish that it was he in your place.”
“I know, but… it’s so real, so real.” Tony whispered, “The dreams, I keep having them, even when I’m awake and… everyone hates me, blames me, wants me to die.” He looked up at Steve large haunted eyes, “I’m so tired, so tired it hurts, but if I go to sleep then…then the dreams come and it makes everything worse.”
“Could he though, I mean could he?” Ned gazed at Peter with huge eyes looking like a puppy begging for treats.
His handler put away the device he’d been speaking into and gave him a grim smile, “Looks like plans have changed.” He said and the asset briefly wondered if he’d be put back on ice. He hoped not, he hated that. It always hurt before the unconsciousness took him, he was aware of his fingers and toes aching, his lungs burning, the sharp sting of the cold over the flesh and the sense of panic that came with being trapped. He wouldn’t fight it though, he knew better than to fight his handlers. He no longer fought the chair, no matter how much he hated it, how sick the thought of being in it made him feel, he forced himself to comply, because he had learned, as every kicked dog learns, that it was better to do as he was told, he was hurt less if he didn’t fight back.
At that point, Tony wholeheartedly agrees, if only to wipe the downtrodden look off Steve’s face. After pressing a kiss to Steve’s forehead, he books a nice restaurant and tries not to let the sinking feeling in his stomach get the best of him.
“Thanks Bucky, that means a lot.” Steve is grinning ear to ear, smile brimming with happiness and relief. He seemed to know that dinner hadn’t been going well, too.
Steve hauls himself up, a recreation of every battle he’s ever fought. But this time, he gives a little. He’s just so, so tired. “I’m here to return the stone.”
Silence. Steve’s eyes widen as he remembers what’s been flashing across every major news outlet for days, what caused that. “I’m- I’m so sorry,” he stammers, “I didn’t mean to pry-”
to save the world from them, from the Red Skull, from Hydra. Turns out he never could do things right.
By the time the fire truck arrived, one very singed Tony Stark came out to meet them. He was chattering nervously, as per usual.
His teeth ache as he clenches them, and his eyes burn hot. In a split second, he makes a decision. Being level-headed is overrated, anyway.
A dark-haired firefighter poked his head out of the window, stared suspiciously at Tony, and then patted Steve on the back. The door slammed shut and the wheels screeched as the truck pulled away. Tony made eye contact with Steve one last time.
“Sorry about that. It’s just so beautiful. And-and it represents so much, and it’s going to help so many people.” Tony’s breath catches. “I just-I can’t,” Steve stumbles. He takes a deep breath. “I just love you
But then Steve continues, “Taking you to meet him is like meeting my parents, since my actual parents are-, they’re, um..”
“Bucky. He was abducted after trying to stop a shipment of your weapons. Turned into a weapon and a murderer against his will,” Steve says, eyes stinging. “Howard Stark, murdered in a ‘car crash’,” he continues. “Countless innocents killed by you, millions more murdered in your name. By Hydra.” His words puncture the quiet so abruptly even Steve himself flinches a little. He plows on, descending further with each uttered phrase.
Steve swirls his hot chocolate in the silence, whipped cream melting at the top. When he looks up, his blue eyes are so sad that Tony flinches minisculely. “Aren’t we all,” he says.
But now, he stands alone. And Steve thinks he might be hallucinating. Or having a panic attack. Or both.
“Welcome.” The Red Skull continues his monologue, but Steve can’t process the words. Can’t even process the sight before his eyes. Because he’d
Steve does as instructed, gingerly fishing the stone from its case. Then he dutifully leans over the edge, prepared to throw-
Silence. Not even a flicker of recognition lights up the Skull’s blank stare. In the soul-sucking hush, Steve’s shock mutates into fury. Anger that has been sitting for a century with nowhere to go. Well, it’s all racing out now, thrumming through his body, and Steve feels the most alive he’s felt in years.
The world is loud. People are constantly bustling about, too busy to look beyond their own noses. It’s easy enough for Natasha to slip through the cracks, footfalls ever so soft.
Tony blinked rapidly. “Uh, yeah. All good.” He scratched his neck. “Really good. Always good.” Oh god, what was even coming out of his mouth? It hadn’t been this bad even with Pepper.
