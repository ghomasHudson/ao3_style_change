“Thanks, Tony,” Steve says quietly. Tony wants to take his name from Steve, wants to tell Steve that he doesn’t get to have it like that anymore, soft and insecure, like a friend.
"Jesus, Rogers," Tony says under his breath. That’s not what he means to say, precisely, but it’s definitely what he feels. Because of course Steve was out there in the middle of the worst war in recent human memory, the same war that turned Howard into an impatient, bitter old man, and Captain America was sitting there, learning about constellations with the other Howlies.
ALSO! i wanna take a quick poll. i started this fic as gen and it's stayed.......fairly non-shippy up to this point. anyone have any strong feelings about that one way or another?
Overall, Tony’s content, enough that it feels dangerous, and he can feel a faint thrum of adrenaline in his fingertips at the implications even though that’s downright antithetical to the whole tranquility thing.
Usually, that is. Usually Tony considers Rhodey’s input invaluable. But this time Rhodey pokes around at the hologram for almost ten minutes before he says anything.
“The Avengers started as a group of people who came together, individually, to help,” Tony says, for lack of anything more enlightening.
By the time he’s done down in the gym, it’s fairly late, which means it’s past midnight in New York anyway, he couldn’t call even if he wanted to now.
“Can’t be me. I’d say ‘he trusts me about as far as he can throw me,’ but he can throw me pretty damn far.”
Steve looks up, and Tony steps closer. He knocks twice on the countertop, right next to Steve’s hand. Steve looks devastatingly young and heartbroken like this, when they haven’t turned on all the kitchen lights, when neither of them know what to do or how to fix it.
“So much for being adults,” Wanda says dryly. When Tony looks over, she’s sitting up straight, one hand in her lap, the other delicately on the table. Both serious and joking, maybe. Vision speaks up before anyone else can comment on it.
“Believe it or not,” he says, “Tony is fairly invested in his own continued existence these days. Hasn’t always been the case, but I think he really was doing what he thought was best.”
He catches Nat’s eye then, and she’s sitting next to Bucky, their bodies angled toward one another, and she smiles at him, not soft or sympathetic, but
Bucky just watches him in response. After another couple minutes of discomfort and Steve trying not to squirm, Bucky looks up at something above Steve’s head. The nurse, if he had to guess.
“Why did you leave me here alone?” he gasped out. There were still a few seconds to fill, so he asked, “Why didn't you wait just one more second? You didn't even say goodbye.”
He reveled in the muted sounds he was extracting from his partner, but they weren't quite the ones he wanted. Some minor, searching adjustments in the angle of his movements finally elicited a violent response – Tony's entire body spasmed and his voice choked off, then came back in a guttural, primal moan, desperate and pleading. A devilish grin spread across Rogers' face and he repeated his trajectory, earning a second round of
“No, no. Actually, I'd rather surprise him.” He lifted the messenger bag in his hand up into view, tipping his head toward it. “Thought he could use a break.”
Steve was staring at him with those sharp blue eyes, and there was about ten good feet of space between them, but Tony could see they were a little too wide in what he easily recognized as underlying panic. Steve's uniform was looking a little worse for wear, but it did nothing to detract from his well-toned muscles, especially standing at stiff, military attention as he was now. Tony felt his own breathing matching the rapid pace of his love's heaving chest, and his eyes latched onto the tic in that chiseled jaw – funny that he could still see it through that truly impressive beard.
He was cut off with a firm hand in his hair, dragging him down into a hard kiss that left him breathless. When Steve relinquished his grip, trailing a gentle hand down to cup his cheek, Tony blinked down at him dazedly.
Alone, finally, with the man he'd been dying to see for so long he could hardly remember a time before, Tony felt all the things he'd been wanting to say bubble up in his throat and flood across his tongue, ready to issue forth.
Steve pushed open the office door and crossed the room at a crisp pace, the sound of his footsteps bringing his paramour's head up from its resting place on his arms; he noted the tie was still wrapped securely in place, even though Tony could have dislodged it with relative ease. The blonde circled around the desk, eyes raking over every inch of the body splayed over the tabletop, taking in the image with unmasked desire. He saw no evidence that his seed had run down tanned legs, the thought of it still buried within Tony enough to spark a fire in the pit of his stomach, increased twofold when he saw that the restrained man was already hard for him.
He hesitated, wanting anything but to admit it aloud, took a breath to stall. But eventually, he sighed out, “I know.”
“Then again, how long do you think you could keep quiet? Don't want someone to come check on you, find you like this, do you?” he asked, tone intentionally baiting, and was rewarded with a challenging look. It only lasted a moment, though, as he pulled his cock out at a deliberately slow pace, dragging a groan from his captive with it. “See?” he needled, stopping just short of removing himself completely.
As he yanked Tony's pants off and lifted him onto the tabletop, he heard a muffled noise that sounded vaguely reminiscent of his name. He looked up to find a question in his genius' eyes and he answered it with a wicked smirk, bending over to lick and nip at the man's thighs, following the line of his boxers. He earned a loud groan for his efforts, hips bucking up toward him, and he gripped Tony's thigh with one hand, the other swiftly covering the tie over his mouth.
Bucky was there next to Cap and the latter's blue eyes slid worriedly toward him, a silent askance if Barnes would be fine on his own (Tony knew that look, remembered it from hundreds of their own silent exchanges), but the metal-armed man just rolled his eyes and clapped his friend on the shoulder, trailing off to sidle up next to Natasha. It was good that he left, because Tony didn't know if he could keep it together in front of the ex-assassin; he'd long since accepted that the Winter Soldier hadn't been in control of his faculties when he'd killed Tony's parents, but that didn't mean the anger wasn't still there, that the billionaire could just move on and be okay with him. He didn't need the added burden of censoring the already difficult things that needed to be said.
The flash of worry at being discovered shouldn't have been as arousing as it was, but Steve couldn't deny the pulse of
Steve took Tony on his hands and knees on the bed, then again bent over the edge of it. Tony dug his nails into Steve's back as he was held up against the wall and ravished. They headed into the bathroom for a shower and, while they waited for the water to heat up, Steve had Tony over the sink, bruising fingers grasping his chin, field voice instructing him to watch in the mirror. In the shower, the hot deluge was offset by the cold wall when Steve pushed him against it and shoved into him. Subsequently clean, muscles tired and loose from the heated water, they returned to bed and made a moot point of it, and Steve gave up his previously frenzied pace in favor of slow, languid rolls of his hips, Tony coming apart beneath him under the lazy, soulful attentions.
“Beautiful,” he muttered as he tucked himself back into his pants and fastened them, careful to tuck in his shirt and remake the image he'd presented when he came in (couldn't have anyone getting suspicious).
“No, don't trouble yourself. I'll be back to retrieve him not long after you're gone. I'm hoping he'll be ready by the time I come back, but no one should bother him in the meantime.”
“I'll be with you as soon as I can.” Those words were meant for a far lighter conversation, just the slightest bit too cheery to fit the mood. Tony ignored it.
Somehow, his muddled brain had decided this was the best place to be, standing before the object of his destruction. He decided “masochist” wasn't a strong enough word and he shoved his hands into his pockets, furrowed his brow as he stared into those grey eyes. Maybe it was something he saw (or didn't see) there, maybe he'd just finally cracked, but a melancholy little smile spread across his face.
The captain growled lustfully, well aware his genius was purposely goading him, but hearing his name in that voice was too enthralling and his increasing roughness only encouraged its use, which in turn spurred him on. It was a vicious cycle that wasn't broken until Tony was pressed back against him, body taut, head back on the blonde's shoulder, crying out his passion just as loudly as Rogers had promised, too caught up in sensation to form words anymore.
Tony cried out in surprise – and want – fingers flying down to lock around the super soldier's wrists. Rogers grinned and held him there for a moment, grinding his hips up into him, drinking in the needy sounds he earned with the motions. He was buried deeper this way than he had been during their tryst on the desk, and that, plus the still-sensitive nerves inside his paramour, was enough to draw out absolutely obscene sounds. The tech genius must've realized this, as one hand rapidly moved to cover his mouth, head snapping up to undoubtedly look at the open door across the room.
“You brought him lunch? How sweet,” the secretary cooed, a fawning look in her eyes; she often admitted how she adored their relationship. “And, might I say, you look quite handsome in a tie.”
“I will,” Steve insisted, sounding so sure and stubborn, with just a hint of mischief, and it was so perfectly, perfectly
Stark leaned with feigned comfort against the tall bar tucked against the wall, near his desk so it was easily accessible – he'd brought them to his own quarters, to his office because that's where business was done, in an office, and this was business, right? – and crossed his free arm over his chest, using it to prop the one holding his drink. He purposely used said beverage to gesture toward Steve.
“Hi,” Clint murmured against Phil's lips, eyes half-lidded, smile somehow arrogant and genuinely happy all at once.
“Do what?” Tony bit out, slamming his again-empty tumbler onto the workbench. “Drink myself into a stupor? Have this conversation, like a pathetic crazy person? Fuck you! If you cared, you'd be here!”
“I care about you, Tony. I don't want you to do this to yourself.” Well, wasn't that just the joke of the fucking millennium!
Then, he turned and left, ignoring the sounds of protest from behind him. On his way out, he stopped by the secretary's desk, flashing a winning smile.
Without faltering in his vicious cadence, he plastered himself across his lover's spine, pitching his voice to be heard over the sound of skin-on-skin and the billionaire's muffled screams of passion. “I told you I would do this,” he growled into his ear, his own breath a little ragged with unleashed animalism. “I said I would bend you over and take you the way you've been begging me to for months now. The deal to remove the tie was just a test to see if you could stay quiet through it or if you needed to remain gagged.” He slid one hand up to firmly grasp Tony's jaw and asked, “Is this what you wanted?”
... before?” He sighed in exasperation when his paramour just blinked at him cluelessly. “Jesus! Were you- Together! Were you guys
” followed by a loud chorus of noes.) as some sort of basis for their suitability for each role, and bets were taken, votes were cast, and everything dissolved into amiable chaos.
“Of course, Steve, anything for you two!” His oblivious co-conspirator winked at him and set her fingers flying across the keyboard in front of her. “Looks like there's nothing important for the next few days, so it's really no problem at all.”
The resentment and animosity were still there, twisted into a ferocity that left him straining to get his hands on Steve for an entirely different reason than his initial intentions, and he snarled into the kiss, struggles useless in the face of super soldier strength. So, he focused his attention on what he could do, delving into his paramour's mouth (noting the brush of the new facial hair), arching into the body pressed to his. He felt the hardness pressing into his hip and ground his answering erection against Steve's thigh, getting the smallest of sounds for his effort. That triggered something in his hazy mind and he was determined to have more. Tony fought his way to alter the angle of their kiss so he could suck Cap's lower lip into his mouth, smoothing it over with his tongue –
When they parted, the billionaire couldn't help himself. “I mean, that's just downright impressive!”
Those couple of words were all it took to open the floodgates, to shatter the flimsy hold he'd had on all the things he'd kept bottled up.
The super soldier held his lover tightly against him, both of them panting, until he began to soften inside him. It took quite a while, a multitude of factors – this being the second round, the serum in his veins, the vulgarity and anticipation of both couplings, just to name a few – guaranteeing a prolonged, heavy release. As he waited, he languidly kissed and nipped at Tony's neck and collarbone, earning a few soft gasps and shivers, but he was careful not to get too enthusiastic.
After a long minute – but, damn, did it feel like a decade – Clint blurted, “Oh, fuck this!” and crossed the room in a few swift strides, locking his hands in the lapels of Coulson's suit jacket, dragging him in for a passionate kiss. The room at large stared, most in absolute shock, until they parted.
Diving into his work helped. So did alcohol. Often, he didn't rejoin the real world for days. Even less often did he enjoy what he found waiting for him.
“Morning,” Steve rumbled, and the happiness in his voice was the most beautiful thing Tony had ever heard.
Clever fingers obeyed immediately, sliding down to grasp their owner's erection and start pumping, and the blonde soaked in that image for a while. However, he didn't let it last too long.
He struggled a little as his love pushed him back enough to gaze up into his face and say, “It's not
from Tony. Having found what he was looking for, he focused on that pattern, driving hard against his lover's prostate, slamming into him with abandon. He had enough time to soak in the vision of his partner cumming, cock untouched, back arched, shout muffled by his tie, but then the muscles around his own erection were locking down and, in a few more wild thrusts, he buried himself as deep as he could physically go and released inside that wonderful body.
Standing in a loose group across the broad expanse of concrete, clearly having just arrived, stood Team Cap. Both sides froze, muscles strained with doubt and the effort to make no wrong moves, and eyes swept opposing lines, gauging. Some members on both sides were hidden simply from the way they'd naturally been grouped up to this moment, and one of them just had to be the single person in all the world that Tony was dying to see.
Tony blushed a little harder and said, “I love you, too.” He stared up into sky blue eyes for a long moment, then couldn't take the intensity anymore, however pleasant, and gave Steve a joking push. “Get dressed. Go on! You're the one that insisted we have to be social.”
Tony's legs were locked in place, fear a gripping presence in his chest, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end and his stomach doing vicious rolls. He accepted the words and affections of his returned teammates, but he honestly had no idea who had come to him or what was said, or how he'd responded in turn. His eyes were searching for that one face, that one form, the only one that truly mattered right now, the one that had been haunting him for the last two years.
thirst, and he drained the glass. He didn't spare a single thought before refilling it with another double, earning a sigh from behind him.
As Steve surged to his feet, Tony snapped out another vicious punch, but his counterpart had always been incredibly, almost inhumanly, fast. One strong hand closed around his wrist, the other encircling its partner, and he was slammed backward into the bar, felt the sharp edge of the countertop bite into his shoulder blades, heard glass ring dangerously. He was gearing up to struggle, to slip eel-like out of the tight grasp of his opponent (it was his only chance of staying in the fight), but Steve must've known that, knew it from all the times they'd trained together. That broad, muscular form pressed him soundly against the bar, held his wrists firmly at his sides, and pressed a thigh between Tony's to prevent him from dropping downward. The billionaire had been expecting that, honestly, knew better than to think he could outmaneuver the brilliant strategic mind of Steve Rogers, but what took him by surprise was the vicious method with which the blonde attacked him.
,” Tony moaned, closing his eyes as desire and a little fear played across his face. He remained passive, if not directly helpful, as the captain redressed them both.
“Ohhh, was he surprised?” the woman squealed softly, clearly noting the satisfied shine to his eyes, though she thankfully associated it with all-too-pure reasons (i.e. the lunch he'd supposedly brought).
“Don't worry, everyone's gone, I made sure of it. No one around to hear you but me,” the blonde said, reaching up to pull his hand away from his mouth. He rolled his hips upward as he added, “And I'm going to make you scream.”
After his trip to Staten Island and brief affair with Steve's old WWII statue, Tony had decided that regardless of how things had turned out between the two of them, he needed to fix his mistakes for the good of all the other heroes of the world, both those he loved and those he'd yet to meet. True to Stark form, he'd gone in with guns blazing, demanding a rewrite of the Accords to better benefit both sides, something to allow heroes their freedom and still give civilians a peace of mind. He'd ignored the name-calling (really, he'd been called a lot worse than “turncoat” and “double-crosser”), laughed at the threats, and called on the most brilliant minds he knew to help him formulate a new draft. He was so committed to making this work, he'd even contacted Reed Richards and,
It had happened when he received a letter, written in a neat penmanship he'd recognize anywhere. He didn't know what he was expecting – knew what he was hoping, though, however irrational it might be – and was (unsurprisingly) disappointed with what he found. There was no promise of coming home, no admission of guilt or yearning, just an apology that things hadn't turned out better and an oath to help when trouble reared its ugly head.
Rogers took a deep breath to clear his head, though he held tightly to the warmth that flooded his chest, and shifted the messenger bag at his side, one hand coming up to fiddle nervously with his tie. He pressed the door shut behind him and engaged the lock, not wanting their time together to be interrupted. Then, he carefully sidled off to one side, placing himself in the far edges of Tony's peripheral vision; he knew the billionaire was too engrossed to really pay much attention, but he also didn't want to chance ruining the surprise.
Rogers nodded absently, well familiar with his paramour's tendency to fall into the black hole that was his work. Sometimes that was dangerously close to being literal.
He'd thought of calling anyway, considered tracking the singular number programmed into the phone that accompanied the letter (yeah, it was definitely going to be a burner phone, but that wouldn't stop him, he was too brilliant for that). Instead, he'd tossed it in a drawer in his desk and pretended it didn't exist. But he'd already locked away too much for his mind to keep at bay, and the truth started slipping free.
That sparked a very lively debate, everyone having a very clear opinion on the matter that they very vehemently shared, using the couple's beards (“
There was another moment of awkward silence, this one a little more focused on the relationship bombshell that had just been dropped on them, and then people were moving forward, talking, clasping hands, hugging, and the spell was broken.
And he did. Tony orgasmed near-instantly, covering his hand and shooting up onto his shirt, voice choked off for a long moment as the severity of it ripped through him, then coming back in a long, low groan. Steve gritted his teeth and held on with every ounce of willpower he had, fucking the billionaire steadily through his release, waiting until he was coherent again. The moment the sounds he made became sufficiently desperate, hypersensitivity feeding them, Rogers slammed inside with abandon, finishing buried as far inside as he could manage. His actions pushed his paramour back over the edge, making him cum a second time; this one produced very little semen, but it was just as violent as the previous one.
The tears spilled over, rolling hotly down Tony's face. “Why did you have to die like that? I can't do this without you!”
“Very,” the blonde agreed, innocence personified. “Listen, could you do me a big favor? Make sure no one bothers him for the rest of the day – whatever it takes. He's a little preoccupied right now and I'm afraid I've taken up quite a bit of his time.”
the day before, and mumbled, “We're still working things out, I intend to work things out all day today, we shouldn't give them false hope just yet- Hmm.” He smiled into the kiss that Steve maneuvered him into.
Steve smirked and tucked his fingers under his lover's chin, tipping his head up so he could look into those beautiful brown eyes. “Don't spill a drop,” the blonde said, reaching to brush a finger over the tech genius' abused hole, delighting in the quiver he elicited, “and I'll take you home and fuck you again.” He pressed his finger shallowly inside, dipping it in and out in tandem with, “And again. And again. And again.” He kissed him fiercely to prove his intent. “I'm going to fill you up with my cum until your body can't hold it all in.”
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS replied dutifully, voice far too gentle than a fucking AI had any right to be. “Same as before, isolating only Captain Rogers' part?”
They crashed together, hands grasping hungrily, mouths coming together and breaking apart to seek other flesh, panting and moaning into the air, into each other. Stark gasped as Steve suddenly lifted him from the ground, quickly tucked his legs around that perfectly tapered waist, and never ceased in his ministrations. He felt them moving, knew they were headed somewhere, but he didn't have it in him to give a good goddamn until he was abruptly dropped, blinking owlishly as he bounced on his mattress. He wasn't sure how Steve had known where the bedroom was – in all likelihood, he hadn't, he'd just made an educated guess – but it didn't really matter because Steve was on him in the span of a single breath, hands tugging at his clothes, and Tony tugged back, each of them exposing skin in fits and starts. Steve dragged Tony's pants and boxers off in one rough pull, Tony was dragging Steve's uniform shirt up over his head, articles were thrown in whatever direction, something tore, and neither of them cared. They kissed and bit and caressed whatever flesh came into view, sitting up, laying back, parting and pressing back together, and then they were finally naked.
As they left, the archer called over his shoulder, “Sorry, guys, I promise I'll catch up with the rest of you, but I've got some pressing business in need of my immediate attention. Specifically, this man. Naked. In my bed.” His laughter as Phil shot him a fond, reproachful look rang in the air well after they'd disappeared into the main building.
The silence rushed in on him, the lack of voices and incidental sounds that typically accompanied so many bodies, and Tony glanced over to find all eyes were pinned to him and Steve. Panic sparked in his chest, adrenaline flooding his veins, and he fought down the urge to escape their attention; many would probably be surprised to learn that it was a very common notion for him, the discomfort of being a crowd's primary focus, despite (or maybe because of) living in the spotlight his entire life. Luckily, the gathering was more than willing to follow Natasha's lead as she headed into the main building – and of course she knew where she was going, that wasn't the least bit surprising, she'd probably obtained copies of the floorplans the day he'd submitted them and memorized them in moments. As they left, he caught the meaningful looks Pepper and Rhodey shot him (
Stark didn't trust his voice to remain steady, wasn't sure what to say anyway, so he settled for nodding. He watched his paramour close the space between them slowly, as if afraid he was going to spook Tony, and accepted the tender kiss he received.
“Thank you all for coming. If you’re done socializing then we can get the show on the road.” It was always satisfying when a room hushed to hear Tony speak. The constant flash of cameras made it almost impossible to see, so he focused on a point in the middle of the crowd.
He had been headed for the kitchen to get breakfast, but instead he caught an eyeful of Tony’s beautiful rear end as the man bent over to root through the refrigerator -- the sudden change in blood flow had nearly given him vertigo. It was all Steve could do to grab an apple -- that he didn’t want -- as an excuse for entering the kitchen, before hightailing it back to his room as quickly and normally as he could.
Steve was hard enough to pound nails into concrete and knew he was going to watch one of Tony’s videos regardless of the little voice in his head screaming that it was wrong.
He burst out laughing. Maybe it was the sleep deprivation, maybe it was the fact that it had been just him and the bots (who didn’t really surprise him anymore) for weeks, maybe it was Maybelline, but that was hilarious. That little smirk was back. It looked wonderful on him, almost coy, and Tony was mentally patting himself on the back for a job well done because here was the personality he was looking for.
“Not on your life,” There was no way she would be wasting a single minute of her free time by bringing up Steve Rogers’ fuck ups.
He hadn’t expected to see Natasha Romanoff unpacking foam lined travel cases of electronics in the living room. Normally Steve would have warned him if someone needed a place to stay for a few days, so Tony wasn’t sure how to take this -- not that Natasha couldn’t visit, but she generally didn’t stop by at 11 pm with half a Bestbuy worth of computer equipment…
They started a new round. BUCK-E focused on a woman in the back with rectangular glasses and a sharp jaw. They both start combing through social media and databases. JARVIS said this was an easier game than normal, due to the fact that most everyone in the room was a reporter, which narrowed down the search parameters right from the start.
BUCK-E pressed a finger between Tony’s cheeks. Gently rubbing at the puckered ring of muscle and letting his dry finger catch against the skin. When he was bored of teasing, BUCK-E brought his hand around to run it through the pooling lubricant on his stomach making sure to get an even coating.
“Are you feeling unwell?” BUCK-E hovered over him, inspecting him for who knows what. It was ridiculously endearing.
“The question that we need to ask about the future is: can robots understand and appreciate the arts?”
The angle of the video was off to the side, like the camera was on a shelf, which gave a wonderful view of where Tony was tied spread eagle to a bed with velcro cuffs. Tony was somewhere between twenty-five and thirty in this one, and from what Steve understood still well into his party boy phaze that lasted from sixteen to Afghanistan.
“Steve, I’d like to introduce you to BUCK-E,” he announced, waving a hand at him to leave no room for doubt, while also breaking their silent staring contest. He loved his husband, but Tony was pretty sure he knew who was going to win that one, and it was the guy who didn’t need to blink.
It was then that Tony actually registered the conversation, as he was measuring out the coffee grounds for the machine. He dumped them in and started it up as fast as he could (he had his priorities, all right?) before running back to the living room.
“Come on. Up and at ‘em. I don't know about you but I could go for a cup of coffee and something greasy. I’m thinking pizza? Jarvis, could you handle that for us?” Tony was thinking it was time for a nap too, if the jittery feeling under his skin was any indication – which he knew it was. He was a connoisseur of the flavors of sleep deprivation.
His hips bucked involuntarily up into Tony’s body as his orgasm flowed through him like a current. Buck-E could feel the lubricant leaking out around his cock, thankfully less than the first time due to a quick adjustment. He and Tony had agreed that it was an excessive amount to ejaculate after every orgasm, and he would rather not need to refill his stores after every time he had sex (something he was hoping to partake in often, which made the mess seem even more bothersome).
She hummed a nonanswer while unrolling a white sheet and hung it on a tri stand. The camera she pulled out next made it clear that she was setting up a backdrop.
“As you all know green energy is a cause I hold close to my heart,” That had been one hell of a press conference. It had been like a pack of Mentos in a bottle of Coke when he announced, effective immediately, Stark Industries would no longer be producing weapons. He’d been harangued with questions, had his mental state questioned, and lauded as a humanitarian, all in the same breath. In the year since the announcement, it had calmed down significantly, at least on an outward front.
Strong arms wrapped around him and held tight, not trying to quiet his sounds but allowing him to let it out without judgement (he didn't know to judge yet) and comforting him with a hand rubbing circles into his back.
Very few people were able to disappear that completely and the ones who could were not people you’d like for house guests. They were generally jaded and as likely to slit your throat as hold a door open for you.
“BUCK-E is a close friend, and he needs a place to stay while he figures himself out,” Tony tried to push the attention away from questions that didn’t have answers. He should have been more prepared with a background before now. It was surprisingly short sighted of him. But to be perfectly honest, he had been rather distracted.
“It was one of his more sincere attempts at mending fences. Would you like me to play it back for you, sir?”
“Okay. That’s okay. How about we go to the lab and I'll grab your charger and we can lay on my bed? Is that all right?”
"Oh sweetie, we all sat around wishing we were keeping you company. You never asked though, how were we supposed to know you wanted that if you didn't ask?" Tony brought their foreheads together.
Not to be presumptuous but as the only Omega on the team he assumed he would be the pack Omega. Tony hadn't asked him but Steve thought it was implied with how everyone treated him. Natasha made these little Russian cakes that she only shared with him. Clint would flop down on the floor in front of him and set Steve's feet on his belly and rub little circles into his ankles while they watched TV. Every time Bruce made a cup of tea he would make a second one just for Steve. Thor wasn’t on planet very often, but when he returned from Asgard he would always bring Steve a bauble of some sort. And then there was Tony, the pack Alpha was always touching Steve in some little way, gently scenting him and comforting at the same time. It wasn't what a pack Omega would have gotten in the 40s but it was what he'd been expecting for one in this day and age.
“No, B U C K dash E. He’s my newest AI,” Tony was gratified to see the look of surprise flit across Steve's face. He patted the android’s shoulder as he waited for Steve to find some words.
was totally and completely unacceptable. Not going to happen. No matter how good it would feel to tell Steve right where to shove it.
The way Tony swiveled his hips on BUCK-E’s cock had the android throwing his head back at the unexpected sensation. He had not expected the feeling of being inside Tony to be so intense, his orgasm crept up on him with an electric crackle across all of his nerves.
“He did not. I triangulated his location based on the cell towers that were in the area. He is at a military installation just outside of Washington DC.”
“WHAT!” Steve actually shot up out of his chair. It crashed somewhere behind him off screen. “Tony! What does that mean?” he asked, gripping the screen.
While he could have suppressed the smile that crept onto his face, BUCK-E didn’t see any reason to -- Tony seemed to derive enjoyment from seeing BUCK-E enjoy things. He understood that sentiment entirely.
BUCK-E was beginning to think that perhaps he had miscalculated, Tony was implying he was displeased to have been left out of the conversation instead of BUCK-E’s assumption that he didn’t want to talk about his husband, “I was not trying specifically to exclude you. He makes you upset and unhappy, I did not want that.”
“Put him through.” He waved his hand through the air with a sigh. He needed more coffee, and he probably (definitely) didn't need it but he wanted a slice of cold pizza – he’d already had three slices but who was counting? Jarvis probably... and judging too, if Tony knew him at all.
Tony looked up when he heard a crash, but it was just DUM-E. He was trying to teach BUCK-E how to play ball. The android was listening intently to every sound from the bot, following along better than any human ever could. It was adorable and Tony hid his smile behind the stack of papers.
Instead he lubed it up -- perhaps too well with how much of the slick was pooling in his hand -- and with a steadying breath, he pressed it against his hole. It took some convincing to make himself relax enough that he could push it past his rim. Just as he had begun to worry that he was doing it wrong, the silicon toy slipped all the way in, easy as anything.
“Tony says that I can change my mind about sex whenever I want. If I decided I no longer want to have sex with you later...”
“Well, that’s good, I wasn't sure if I was being too subtle. He’s a sexbot, fully functional in every way of course.” And Tony maybe had a nasty smile on his face but he wanted to make sure his hit landed just right.
"I spoke with Rogers last night." He hoped that the subject didn't cause Tony any distress, but when Pepper had spoken of his husband the other day it hadn't had the same reaction as actually speaking to the man.
"You thought what?" Tony asked while running one hand through Steve's hair. It was so relaxing and distracting he couldn't remember why he hadn't wanted to finish his sentence.
BUCK-E hadn’t considered that was what the fingering was leading up to, but he realized he should have -- it was generally what came next according to the Internet. He thought he would enjoy sinking his cock into Tony’s wet heat. Video evidence showed that it could be a very enjoyable act for all parties involved.
"I thought I was the pack Omega. I thought everyone would be there. I wanted- I even left my door open," Steve wished a portal would open up right here so he could just jump through it and escape this conversation.
Sorry it's been so long since I've updated. I did warn that this might happen so I claim no responsibility. pretend it's still Wednesday and I actually posted this on time.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
“New designation: BUCK-E accepted.” BUCK-E seemed rather stiff – he was supposed to be able to mimic humans, but apparently even with the ability, he didn't have the inclination. The only thing for it was time, so with that in mind, Tony stretched his arms to the ceiling and was rewarded with a half dozen cracks from up and down his spine, a sure sign he had been working for far too long. It was always that way on the final leg of a project, and this one was no different. He’d been excited to finally meet BUCK-E after weeks of sleepless nights.
He was beginning to feel a bit antsy himself. The incremental slide as Tony’s heat slowly engulfed his cock felt amazing. BUCK-E didn’t let that get the better of him though, keeping Tony’s hips carefully in check until they were flush against BUCK-E’s pelvis.
To keep himself from obsessively watching the clock, Tony had resorted to going through the backlog of approvals and requests that Pepper had left him to sign. Which was such a shame, because if he did this again next week she would realize there was a pattern and continue to give him a mountain of paperwork and expect it all to be worked through on Saturday.
He waited with bated breath while his newest creation booted up. It was only a few minutes before he finished his preboot diagnosis and then eyelids were fluttering like they should and Tony was caught in a piercing gaze that made his stomach do a little flip of excitement.
“Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.”
Steve decided suddenly that his hand wasn't going to be enough this time. He made his way to the bedroom to find the little box that had arrived in discrete packaging that he hadn’t had the nerve to actually use yet -- although he had charged and washed it just as it instructed. He’d even held it in his hand while it vibrated and he imagined what it might feel like inside of him.
“Oh fuck,” Tony gasped out. He had one hand on BUCK-E’s pectoral for balance as he continued rocking his hips in little circles, never raising up enough for BUCK-E’s slowly softening cock to slip out.
He'd just gone through his first heat in the Avengers tower, His second heat in the future, and not a single Avenger came to help him through it. At first he'd thought they were waiting for Tony to come and have him first, as the Pack Alpha it was only right. But that never happened.
“Of course, sir. I am after all a highly sophisticated Artificial Intelligence. Ordering pizza is well within my purview.” Honestly the sass on that bot, Tony had no idea where he got that from. None at all. Nope.
With a nervous anticipation skittering across his skin like goosebumps, Steve followed the cord from its spot between his cheeks until he found the remote, his cock twitching with every inadvertent tug at his rim when he pulled at the cord. He turned it on and almost cried out at the sensation. It felt like his entire body was shaking from the vibration in that little toy, it hadn't felt so intense when he held it in his hand.
“And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.”
Tony whimpered but didn't try to convince him otherwise. When he removed his fingers to add more lubricant Tony mistakenly thought BUCK-E had changed his mind without a reason.
The vibrator inside of Tony cut off -- an audible lack of sound -- and the man dropped like a puppet with its strings cut. Sheve worked his cock through his own orgasm and to the other side, where his muscles started jumping and twitching to get away from the sensation.
“I give you my word, you are not going to hurt me. This is probably the most open I have ever been, and while I wouldn’t mind giving fisting a try, I am in no mindset for that right now. Please BUCK-E, I. Am. Ready.” Tony emphasized his words with kisses.
With just a minor detour they settled into bed. BUCK-E, with his head cradled in his charger, a faint blue glow haloed his head as his eyes fluttered shut, and Tony stretched so he was touching as much of BUCK-E’s body with as much of his own as possible. He watched the tiny eye twitches he could just make out that signified BUCK-E’s REM cycle had set in just like it should, before setting his head on BUCK-E’s chest to listen to his gentle breathing. It wasn't really ‘breathing’ per se, it was actually BUCK-E taking in cool air and forcing the heat out the same way. The more active he was, the more heat his inner mechanisms would produce, thus the heavier BUCK-E would breathe.
That wasn't right; shouldn't Tony be talking about how Steve wasn't enough of an Omega for that sort of thing? Instead he was talking about privacy?
Katherine Farrell was an investigative journalist employed by the Daily Bugle. Once he had a name, BUCK-E paused their game. Why was Katherine Farrell here? Every article he found by the woman showed her to be a crime reporter, focused on finding answers before the police even had a chance. This was definitely not her usual scene.
“I could keep track of him for you, to be sure he doesn't do anything dangerous?” It would certainly ease BUCK-E’s mind to know that Rogers had not come to harm, knowing it would distress Tony.
Groaning and trying to roll onto his back, Tony froze when a hand caught his shoulder, preventing him from completing his turn. When he opened his eyes, he found the hand belonged to BUCK-E and he had been stopped at the very edge of the couch, just before he would have tumbled over onto the unforgiving hardwood.
By the time Steve did call, Dum-E had almost completely cleaned up the spanners that he’d knocked onto the floor. He wouldn’t let BUCK-E help pick them up, but magnanimously allowed him to reorganize them by size.
The Tony on his phone put up a token struggle, not really trying to escape but more like he was enjoying the feeling of being restrained. Out of nowhere Tony bucked and of course Steve knew it was because of the wireless bullet inside him but the first time he watched it he’d been confused and completely captivated. Miles of beautifully tan skin writhed on the bed, trying ineffectively to get some kind of friction when there was none to be had.
the videos he couldn’t stop watching -- and it was starting to make things uncomfortable for him around the Tower...
BUCK-E couldn't argue that it was a very pleasant morning activity, but now that it was over, he was once again thinking of Rogers and whether he would behave. The best person to ask would be Tony, being married to the man surely gave him an insight that BUCK-E -- who had only interacted with the man for a matter of minutes -- did not have.
Tony left a line of kisses across his chest, grazing a nipple on his way up to BUCK-E’s mouth. BUCK-E was beginning to get more comfortable with kisses, but he still would rather have his hands all over Tony.
“I want to stay as close to the edge as I can without going over. Out on the edge you see all kinds of things you can't see from the center.”
Ethics was so difficult, it seems to be very subjective. The entire concept was frustrating but he would trust JARVIS' judgement on the matter.
“I often tell my students not to be misled by the name 'artificial intelligence' - there is nothing artificial about it. AI is made by humans, intended to behave by humans, and, ultimately, to impact humans' lives and human society.”
Hence, admitting defeat. As much as she hated the idea of Rogers gloating because he finally knew something she didn't, Natasha had to know.
He had already realized that every moment didn't need to be saved in full detail, a detailed .txt file could be used to remember some moments, and there was no point in compressing audio of complete silence to save for later. That still left so many moments that he would want to save every aspect of, like this one where he and Tony shared a closeness and passion.
“Thanks for the save.” He wriggled up the couch into a more upright position that just so happened to be leaning against BUCK-E’s side. He was pulled in even closer with a hand still on his shoulder, which meant there was an arm wrapped around his chest holding him quite snugly. It was everything he had been craving – warmth and touch and that indescribable feeling of closeness.
“Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect.”
“What do you think it means, Steve? I’m lonely and my husband is I don’t even know how many hundreds of miles away? It means he’s fully fucking functional!” He was starting to shout, but then again he was just raising his voice in reaction to Steve raising his. Somewhere in the back of his head, Tony was thinking about how terrible it was that he was having a shouting match with his husband in front of a brand-new, very impressionable AI, but he was too far gone to actually take that step back and de-escalate the situation right now.
“Another. One more, I'm ready.” Tony seemed sure, but BUCK-E did not think he was ready to be stretched even further. His inner muscles were still tight around BUCK-E’s fingers. He spread them apart to test the give and Tony threw his head back - arching into the digits. “Yes, oh fuck yes!”
“That was one time, and I was totally justified because you were missing and nobody had bothered to tell me! The only reason I even knew was because of our standing phone date,” Tony still had nightmares about that, that they never found his husband, that no one bothered to ever even tell Tony what happened and he was left wondering forever.
Instead of the click of audio he was expecting, the TV flickered on and there was Steve on video chat. Jarvis was such an ass sometimes. He glared at the camera hidden in the corner of the ceiling to let the bot know what he thought of the current misbehavior happening today.
It wasn't any louder but it was definitely firmer. Jarvis disconnected the call, disregarding Steve and whatever he was shouting now. Like a puppet with its strings cut, Tony fell back onto the couch. Before he could hit the back though, he was pulled up against the warm body next to him. He tried to stop the tears that were gathering, but the harder he tried the more his eyes welled up until he was hiccoughing into BUCK-E’s shoulder.
you would stay. But where the fuck are you, Steve? Huh? I sure as shit don't have any clue.” Completely without his permission, his eyes started to water, and he could feel his whole body shaking with rage. Here was holier-than-thou Rogers rearing his ugly head, because butter wouldn't melt in his mouth and he had never done a thing wrong in his whole damn life, trying to tell
“It is your husband, sir. Would you like me to inform him you are busy? Perhaps, that he should try it another time?” Jarvis wasn’t being serious, but it was very tempting to do just that. ‘Sorry I have other things going on, maybe later’. It was just a bit too petty for him. Well, not
There’s a long pause where Tony rests his face against Vision’s shoulder and pretends it’s as soft as a human’s. He doesn’t know if he should be reassuring Wanda or not. For one thing, that’s not something they do. For another, he has no idea if it actually was her fault, consciously or unconsciously.
“Yeah,” Tony says, proud when his voice comes out clear, if a little breathless. “I’m just gonna—hang out here for a hot second if you don’t mind.”
Apparently Clint introduced him to the show and Bucky was hooked right away. He’s fascinated with the way societal rules have been turned inside out since WWII, and the strange way the starring women navigate their insane amounts of wealth. Or, at least, that’s the way he tells the story. Tony secretly thinks Bucky might have the entire personality of a wine mom.
He breezes into the room, a little too fast maybe, and uses the momentum to propel himself toward the coffee maker. Scott’s sitting at the island with a StarkPad, a kid on the screen who must be his daughter, Vision’s standing in front of the stove, apparently cooking, and Clint’s sitting at the dining table on a wooden chair, propped up on at least five different cushions and wrapped in bandages (and Tony feels a stab of guilt at that, having wiped his own slate clean of injuries without actually healing), facing the kitchen and looking riled up.
Tony wakes up in the morning feeling well-rested and clear, though it still takes him a couple minutes to realize he just woke up, which means he was asleep. His senses come alive instantly, processing and sorting information: he’s warm with his back tucked up against the cushions on the back of the couch, his shoulder wedged between the couch and Steve’s torso; he’s mostly on top of Steve, using him as a pillow. Steve’s laying on the couch on his back, one of the throw pillows folded up under his head. Tony’s pretty sure one of his arms is pinned underneath Tony, but the other is wrapped around his waist, caught between Tony’s shoulder blade and the couch back. Either Steve or FRIDAY must’ve turned the TV off at some point. He guesses it must be late morning from how bright it is. There are hushed sounds coming from behind them somewhere—the kitchen, if Tony’s right. He focuses, trying to figure out who it is by sound. There’s the sound of ceramics sliding across the countertop (something Bruce does when he’s sleepy and uncoordinated), a distinctive plop, plop, plop of plate, mug, and drumming fingers (Thor, for sure, no one else makes that much noise simply existing unless they’re actively pouting), and the whisper of socked feet across the hardwood floor, the inhale-exhale of perfectly even breathing (Natasha, cautiously quiet out of habit).
plays in the background. He doesn’t even realize he’s stayed up all night (again) until the sky starts to lighten. He blinks at the picture window and glances over at Bucky, who’s completely conked out with his head tipped back at an awkward angle against the couch arm, one foot planted on the couch, one dangling over the side, and who may or may not be drooling.
Tony pauses, briefly, inches from Steve’s face. He just stops and looks, because this can’t be right, what kind of reality is this? Steve just looks back, smiling like he does when he’s overwhelmed, when they’ve won a battle and he doesn’t quite trust the victory yet.
“Why now?” Tony throws one hand in the air for emphasis Steve can’t see anyway. (It still makes Tony feel better though.) “Why couldn’t we ‘have a conversation’ when there was still something left for us to salvage! What makes you care now!”
He surveys the contents of the fridge for another five seconds and takes one lingering look at the people gathered before he starts scooping out ingredients.
And then they’re gone and Tony scans the room for a way out because he may be a fool but he knows his hard limits when he hits them. He catches Clint’s eye by mistake, because of course Clint gets to see this. And see he does, in the sharp way he does in the field, sharply and thoroughly. Tony holds his gaze for all of four seconds and shakes his head twice slowly,
Press duty will no longer be handled by any one person; ideally they can work out a rotation, but the main issue is that they’ll be on teams or in pairs.
Oh, God, Tony realizes. Steve probably did rehearse this, has been worrying about this, enough to bring it up right after they’ve had some semblance of sex for the first time, like it’s something intimate, something too close to the surface.
“Shut up,” Natasha says, putting on a bored tone even though everyone here knows her better than that. “We talked about this, boys. If you’re going to jump out of a plane, use the buddy system. Let someone know.”
“I’m not afraid of you,” Tony says vehemently, and he promptly wants to smack himself for even hinting at the emotional wound he’s carrying. He hates, despises feeling so volatile, so unsteady. Steve’s hands have frozen against Tony’s ribs and the silence rings around them. Steve finishes quickly then.
Rhodey gets his arms around her first but then they’re both going down and Steve has to dive to grab onto both of them. He slows their descent to the floor, but that’s where they end up anyway. Steve’s hip protests loudly and Rhodey grunts. Bucky stays where he is.
He finally reaches up, touches his hands to Tony’s jaw. He’s burning up, and he gasps in a breath at the contact, and sobs it out. His eyes look like they’re struggling to open past the impulse to scrunch them closed.
Tony shrugs, motioning to Bucky, who’s finally close enough to have caught sight of the prosthetic waiting on the table for him. He lets Bucky approach the table and intercepts DUM-E before he can follow, quietly poking the bot's support struts and smiling to himself, comforted more than he'd like to admit as DUM-E forgets their guest in lieu of trying to predict Tony's next “attack." Of course, true randomness doesn't exist (or, at the very least, it doesn't stem from the human mind), but it's close enough to thoroughly stump the robot.
“Yeah, I believe that,” Tony says, purposely flippant. “I really almost did die,” Peter makes a low, distressed sound that Tony does his best to ignore, “actually, I kind of did die but only just a little bit, and then I got better.”
thank u all for the incredible comments. i think i only really replied to things this time if there were direct questions, and even then i might've missed some. i'm a goddamn mess of a person, i swear to god. i'm so busy all the time these days. pls tell me if something in this chapter doesn't make sense and i'll fix it
“I was thinking maybe we could—one of the training rooms, we could revamp it, make it a simulation room.”
The doctor is swift about it. Tony nods and holds the cotton to the thin trickle of blood on his arm and exhales when he’s told to, and soon enough he’s free and in his own clothes again. It takes him a moment in the hallway to reorient himself in the compound. He basically picks a direction and starts walking. After turning a couple corners, he knows roughly where he is.
He’s not even sure he’s tired right now, in the physical sense. He does register that he’s emotionally exhausted. It would be nice, he thinks, to lay in the dark, in the calm, even if he weren’t to fall asleep for a few hours.
They hadn’t talked about what, specifically, was troubling Howard. That wasn’t how they worked and, thinking back, it was more than likely classified anyway. Nevertheless, the tone of the scene is fond and well worn, a conversation he turns back to in times of confusion and unease. So many of Tony’s childhood memories concerning Howard are bitter, angry, and feature a half-empty tumbler of scotch.
Steve bumped into him again, but didn’t move away, didn’t stutter through an apology. His index finger arched to brush the back of Tony’s wrist. Tony stared at it, too afraid to look up at Steve himself.
“Haven’t made any yet,” Clint says. He’s watching Tony go, popping Froot Loops into his mouth one at a time.
The tablet lies where Sam left it, and Tony watches it for a few minutes until the screen turns dark to signal its being locked. There are tablets all over the compound and they’re basically universal, fingerprint-locked things. Anybody can use any tablet—there’s generally a couple scattered through every room, in addition to the ones people have claimed as their own—but the information is private to each person. Still, it never hurts to watch the things until they’re asleep, even if FRIDAY’s generally keeping an eye out too. Eventually he does get up, takes the stairs at a slow trudge, and slides into bed with Steve, settling with his hip against Steve’s.
“I’m trying to—I don’t know,” Steve admits, and he sounds genuinely frustrated. Tony blinks his eyes shut, and he doesn’t turn to Steve, but he stops pretending to focus on the work in front of him. “Explain, communicate. It’s—” He huffs, seeming at a loss for words. Tony recognizes it in a way he wouldn’t have months ago: a show of trust. Steve’s letting his perfect leader facade crack, displaying that he’s having a hard time and doesn’t know what to say.
But whatever. When has his anxiety ever given a shit about who he is? It’s a little insulting, if you ask him.
The space of the lab is, admittedly, a bit of a mess right now. Parts of projects are lying around from before the fight in Chicago, from before he ran away to Malibu. He keeps meaning to ask FRIDAY what he was doing with the bundle of wires on the center-South table, because he knows she’ll know, but he just hasn’t quite gotten to it yet. Soon, though, now that his armor is combat-ready again, and now that Bucky will have an arm, and now that Extremis is at least on its way to finding an even keel.
“All that shit you’ve been doing for the team since it started—all that extra weight I thought was your burden to bear,” Steve says. “We need a system that doesn’t break your back by design.”
“Minutes,” Tony said. “And then…team night. We can resume our regularly scheduled broadcast.” He was maybe a little ridiculously proud of himself for that sentence. Long, not literal. He thought he might’ve freaked the team out, but this overload, or something, was something Tony knew like the back of his hand. His bounce-back time was pretty remarkable. It was all just a trick of being careful so he didn’t trigger it again.
“Huh,” Tony says. He takes his hands up to his ribcage and pats out a drumbeat there. Nothing. He can feel it, he realizes. It just doesn’t hurt. “Wowza.”
“I helped vet some of the shrink options,” he says neutrally. “And being benched fucking sucks, yeah, but it probably saved my life a few times in my early days at SHIELD. When it’s coming from a doctor, they’re usually right.”
It turns out to be horrendously awkward, is what it is. And that’s not entirely true either because it’s Natasha who comes back first. She shows up on his front step three months after Siberia and it’s all of those things. Tony gets angry and his skin feels askew. All at once he wants to slam the door in her face and sweep her up in a hug.
“Mr. Stark,” Vision says, pulling his gaze back. Tony gasps as another spasm ripples through his torso.
“What—uh, should I be worried?” he asks. Steve stirs underneath him. “What’re you doing with those pics, o mighty Black Widow?”
“Yeah, well, the senior members mostly weren’t. Nat did press every now and then, of course, but. We haven’t been the best at communication and being actual teammates outside of combat.”
Sam comes in first and does an actual double-take at all the food. Looking startled, his eyes go from the food to Tony to Steve to Thor and all the way back to the food.
“This isn’t a therapy session and I’m not looking to turn it into one. The results of that were a lot of pointing fingers and blame and vindication, and I think we’ve come to find that that’s not how this team survives.”
Tony takes about half an hour to text back, and when he does it’s to offer up root beer floats for the menu. Steve admits he’s never had one before, and Tony sends back a simple
He starts putting together Bucky's arm that night. Some time during the evening he’d gotten a reply from T’Challa that contained scans of Barnes’s torso, the mess of biological tissue and mechanical parts and wiring at Bucky’s shoulder, and attached had also been an edited version of the designs he’d sent, notated by someone named Shuri. And it’s fantastic, incredible, makes his eyes go wide and steals his breath it’s so good. He doesn’t have any idea who Shuri is but his new life goal is to meet them and possibly worship the ground they walk on.
He’s not asleep by the end of his little meditative practice. Really, he thinks the only thing he’s accomplished is that he’s emotional and lonely in addition to painfully, steadily awake. Generally, it sucks. He wants—God, he doesn’t even know what (who) he wants at this point. He wishes Rhodey hadn’t left. If Jarvis were here (either one of them) he’d say something dry and sarcastic and illuminating and Tony would feel, if not better, more grounded and ready for the reality waiting for him. Hell, he even kind of wants to talk to Howard. (He doesn't think he could look Mom in the eyes and explain to her how he got himself into this mess. Howard, though, Howard would fix it for him even if he was berating his son the entire time.)
summary of scene involving gore: the alien is in fact wearing a human as a second skin. wanda's restraining it when tony enters, but tony jumps on it and holds it still as wanda looks inside its head. upon finding "no one home" tony decides that the human being is in fact effectively dead. he tells wanda to leave (she does) and kills the alien after a brief struggle.
Instead, he implements those new parameters and takes his suit down to the gym to teach FRIDAY more of his fighting style. She’s seen videos before and studied the way he moves from afar, but he’s never had her record the movements while he’s in the armor. Maybe in the next couple weeks he’ll go out and fight some minor crime, just so she gets a better feel for it. Or just the next time he’s called out, there’s no rush really.
Three floors to go, Tony turns, rather abruptly, one hand on Steve’s hip, and another on his face, pressing him into the wall and kissing him soundly. FRIDAY chimes half a second before the doors slide open, and Tony pulls away, waltzing out into the small crowd of his teammates, grinning like the cat that got the canary, hands in his pockets.
Slowly, the need to fill the silence falls away. Each time he feels the need, he looks out of the corner of his eye and sees Steve there, sleepy looking and holding very still, and he holds his tongue. Instead he hears the road singing under the tires, Steve’s breathing and, under that, his heartbeat. The roads wind, the trees become more dense, and the darkness settles around them.
he can hear the echoes of Howard’s strung-out explanation, distorted through time. It had been the middle of the night, and Tony, already a budding insomniac at the tender age of eight, had wandered down to find his dad in the garage.
Tony’s not entirely comfortable with Steve knowing him so well—and when did that happen, anyway? But also who cares because that’s not the point of the conversation.
“Well you sure as hell didn’t fight very hard to stay, now, did you?” Tony spits. His hands are balled into fists, he realizes.
“They don’t expect any complications,” Natasha says. Another scream comes from the hallway, but it’s short, bitten-off. Natasha grimaces, hunches over a little.
of us did to ensure the Avengers still existed, for everyone else here to even have the choice to be on the team or not.”
And Bucky makes a good Chewbacca, but Tony doesn’t quite want to say that out loud. He’s pretty sure they’re both thinking it anyway. He thinks
The thing is, he knows he’s right. He’s so sure that these changes need to be made, that something’s got to give here before they get a repeat of their so-called “war.” What he needs today is for people to be willing and ready to hear it. And that’s the crux of the issue: he has no control over what happens next beyond how he carries himself in the room. It’s the least fun kind of guessing game.
“Tony,” Steve says, stepping forward with his hands out, palms up like a beggar. “It’s not a problem, I mean it—what do you need to feel safe at the compound? I’ll make it happen.”
It was a hand on his shoulder that broke Tony free from the feedback loop in his head. He fell away from the sensation and smacked the back of his neck on what must’ve been Vision’s rock hard shoulder.
“Good to be back, I think,” he says. “Listen, uh. I need you to start surveilling me. And it doesn’t need to be covert, let’s leave that at the door. Complete bumper lock. Put a red flag on anything noticeably different about me and send it all to my phone.”
Tony nods. He knows it’s not that simple, that it’s borderline dangerous to listen to Steve’s oversimplified version of things, but fuck it all to hell, he wants the comfort. He wants to soak it up and believe it like everyone else. Just for a day, an hour. He’s tired.
Most everyone—besides Steve, Natasha, and Clint—look down at the tablets in front of them, and Tony assumes FRIDAY’s brought up the relevant information. Bruce even slips on his reading glasses. Bucky looks up after scanning the list, arms crossed over his chest in a way Tony thinks is supposed to be nonchalant.
He went through the files when the fiasco was over, though. There had been descriptions, mostly of young people who had fought for their country and then been cast aside upon their return, signing away their bodies for a second chance. Steve remembers thinking he understood, and then he remembers realizing for the first time just what he’d been gambling when he decided to let Erskine and Howard experiment on him.
Tony’s throat itches like his gears aren’t meshing. There’s a hollow grinding somewhere deep inside, deeper than his weak heart and ruined ribs. Psychosomatic, he knows, so he keeps drinking coffee, cup after cup. It doesn’t stop the itch but it keeps his hands busy, keeps him from taking the Audi to the nearest liquor store, so he keeps drinking.
“Oh, my God,” Tony says, mostly to cover up the overly fond smile trying to take over his face. “Am I really that boring? Because I know for a fact it’s not the material this time.”
Two weeks later, Natasha convinces him to start woking on the pardons for the rogue Avengers. Tony screams, and a few tears might even spill down his face, and Natasha just stands there and takes it. That part's pretty terrible.
“Iron Man,” Steve coughs and, oh yeah, Tony forgot to turn off his comm transmission. Steve can hear him singing. Steve’s squinting up at him now, and the building’s not even done falling on them.
“This is a new lab, Tony,” he says. “I haven’t Hulked out in here once yet, or spilled spaghetti on an experiment. I really shouldn’t get in the habit of bringing coffee in here,” he says, dragging the mug closer anyway.
“Technically, I suppose. That depends on how you look at it.” Tony rolls his eyes at the superior smile on Vision’s face. Who gave this guy so much confidence in the first place? He sure as hell doesn’t get it from Tony.
“What’s that noise?” Tony says. He cocks his head to the side—and when the hell did he become a dog—and, yeah, definitely from downstairs. Steve stays quiet for a few seconds and copies the head movement. He raises an eyebrow at Tony.
So, Tony starts out in one corner of the house, in a smallish living room—he doesn’t know what to call it, a sun room maybe?—and knocks out parts of the wall to install receivers and sensor panels. Most of the cameras are already in place; he thinks he’ll just have to add more in the larger rooms.
Eventually, he decides he’s not going to implode or crumple. His eyes are closed, but he knows Steve’s not asleep yet, though enough time has probably passed.
“Oh, please,” Steve says, and he’s definitely pouting when he bats at Tony’s hand. “Like you could make the shot any better.”
It’s 11:19 when Pepper finally walks in, but Tony’s head is absolutely buzzing and he doesn’t turn to face her until she puts a hand on his shoulder even though he’s definitely aware of her presence.
Steve likes to believe he’s a man of faith. Not in God necessarily, though that’s how he was raised. His faith is in people—and in his team more than most. He believes in them, trusts them with his life, but he’ll admit he was nearing the end of his rope before Thor came back, Brood Queen scuttling along at his side.
Tony thinks of Bruce’s new lab, of the room he’s kept for Bruce at the compound even though the man himself was long gone.
Steve agrees easily, possibly recalling that Tony was awake before even him this morning. Tony rides the elevator another two floors up, goes down the hall, into his room, and falls face-first onto the bed. It’s slightly musty, but Tony supposes he hasn’t actually slept on the thing in weeks now. Sure, he’s sat on it a couple of times, but he hasn’t so much as lifted the covers since the last time he fled compound. He wiggles underneath them now, flinging off his shoes and ditching his jeans in the process.
And—there it is, Tony thinks as he heaves in a breath, two, three. The emotional response his body wasn’t having in his own room.
“The point of this,” Steve says gently, “is not to make anyone feel unsafe. If there are concerns, we are happy to help. We’ll find solutions for everyone.”
“I wanna do it right this time,” he tells her anyway. “For the first time, I—I feel like I have time, Pep. Maybe enough.”
Exactly one month after the pardons have been issued (because of course he goes through with it), the world almost ends again. This is when the rest of the (no longer technically rogue) Avengers show up and they kick ass and take names and it’s glorious up until they’ve actually won and then it’s just…horrendously awkward.
“Not anymore, you don’t,” Steve says, and he’s laughing like the asshole he is. And when Tony turns back to look at him, Steve has an eyebrow raised in challenge or question. Tony huffs, keeps it light.
“I dunno,” he says. “Definitely more procedure outline. Ranking, or...chain of command? Not to derail your plan here, ’cause this is all very—considerate. But the functional problems that fucked us over with the Accords could’ve just as easily been fixed with solid command, I guess.”
“I’m saying,” he says, exhales, “that there’s letting her help clean up what was partly her mess and instantly instating her as an Avenger.”
“Mercy,” Tony explains. “How long he was trapped there, how many times he should’ve died because of that eagle—I dunno if there’s any coming back from that. Mentally, emotionally, whatever. Even if his body healed overnight.”
He hears Natasha before he sees her. She doesn’t bother being quiet, so he hears the front door open and shut. Part of his brain tries telling him that he should be worried about that, but then she calls out.
The next voice he gets is…Scott? Definitely Scott. He laughs, then speaks, sounding light. Tony catches the stray word, but gets distracted when he hears Vision. Vision’s tone doesn’t vary too much still, staying steady and calm but with varying degrees of gravity to it. There’s not much there now. There’s a fourth voice, unfamiliar to Tony, but tinny, it might just be a TV.
He lays there for a few minutes, just listening and relishing in the warmth Steve’s giving off, surprised Steve hasn’t woken up yet. He stays where he is even when he hears someone—Natasha—approaching, cranes his neck and smiles at her when her head pops over the back of the couch. She smiles back, raises her phone and snaps a picture. He’s very, very certain in the knowledge that it’s not the first photo she’s gotten this morning.
“We weren’t, though,” he points out, suddenly adamant she understand that, believe it. “Not until—Chicago? Or. Maybe the Accords signing? No, definitely Chicago. But never while you and I—not even after, for a long time, I swear, I wouldn’t—”
along with Clint, the only difference being that Clint came slinking back not even twelve hours later to lick his metaphorical wounds. He’s spent every waking moment since on the phone with Laura going through the most rigorous “negotiations” Tony’s ever heard of.
Tony keeps his eyes forward still as they slip inside and start skirting their way around the room, Steve on the inside, closer to everyone, and Tony on the outside, walking by the wall. Instead of the flustered silence he expected to sense from Steve’s direction, he gets distinctly eye rolling vibes.
Natasha’s mouth goes tight, and Bruce has his eyebrows raised like he’s waiting for an answer. It stings, though Tony had half-expected it. Bruce doesn’t like being told what to do, doesn’t like being controlled. The man falls asleep if anyone else talks too long about feelings. Before Tony can think of a point reasonable enough to sway Bruce, Sam snorts.
It really doesn’t take long for them to get to the hospital, but Steve gets more and more uncomfortable and nauseous the entire way there. Despite the monster of a breakfast they both ate, Steve ends up dry-heaving twice after that first bout, because apparently his metabolism really is just that much of a nightmare.
The desperation lifts after a prolonged moment, just enough for Steve to make a joke about Tony’s brand name process of seduction, and then he snickers at his own cleverness. Tony comes up for air long enough to get out a comeback about Steve’s complete lack of innocence (“Really, Steven, you’re supposed to be America’s sweetheart. You’d be disowned if they saw that come-hither look.”) and the tension dissolves.
“It happened a lot more when I was a teenager,” Tony said to the stainless steel face of the fridge door. He drew a deep breath and felt like an idiot. He’d been clinging to Steve just hours ago, thoughtlessly trusting, vulnerable as can be. This was nothing. (But this isn’t necessary, his mind whispered, he could stop any time, this is like giving Steve extra ammunition on a silver platter and he would regret it. He derailed that train of thought before it could go any further because he knew, he
“Well, when you put it like that.” He beacons Steve with a nod of his head toward the elevator. “Your pick this time, old man.”
“Alright then, Cap,” Tony repeats, because he can’t really fathom coming up with something new to say at the moment, “what’s the game plan?”
“Oh, the pleasure’s all mine,” Rachel Lee assures him. Her eyes are piercing, first on Tony, then on Sam, and back again. “And how are you boys tonight?”
“When Prometheus stole fire and smuggled it to the humans,” Steve continues and—oh, Tony remembers this story now, “and Zeus found out, he sent him to be punished for all eternity. Aquila was the eagle that tortured him all day, and let him heal every night, just to do the same thing the next day.”
He settles onto the couch, back against the armrest, legs sprawled out as far as they can reach. The lights are down to ambient levels, making everything warm and soft.
“I don’t think they’re getting continuous orders,” Tony says. “Simple AI. They got their orders and were deployed, if I had to guess. But if they could figure out where the new bots keep coming from, I would be thrilled.”
Tony scoffs to himself, considers the ramp well and truly covered, and swoops around to land near Clint, who smiles cheekily at him, raises his bow, and fires at something over Tony’s shoulder without breaking eye contact.
This is all—too much. It’s too much. The silence that stretches this time is awkward, and Tony feels like it’s his turn to say something, but what? What does Steve want from him here? For him to say
and Tony simply can’t fathom the thought of him being in trouble and not helping), but in the end, he can’t do it. They all deserve to live because they’re people and because they’re his teammates, and it stings too much to try and boil it down to a few variables. It’s cowardly, is what it is, but he also thinks it may be the right way to handle this. The priority here is whoever’s closest and in the most need of help. That is, unless someone happens to be key in finishing the mission and saving the world (or at least a good chunk of it). Then, depending on just how big of chunk of the world they’re talking here, they key teammate could even take priority over civilians.
“Not directly,” Tony says, “but I’d bet you any three of my armors that this is his bullshit to clean up.”
“Sergeant Barnes will be down momentarily,” FRIDAY informs him after a few more seconds. Tony nods to her and opens up three different holo-screens. One’s filled with Peter’s weekly hero-ing report, transcribed by FRIDAY from Happy’s voicemail; the next shows the projected diagnostic report from Extremis (he’ll have to do another sweep later to get actual numbers from the nanites, but he’s pretty sure he definitely shouldn’t be taking that heart medication anymore); the third screen shows Pepper’s SI business trip schedule, just in case Tony decides he really does need to run away again.
Nat takes a sip of her coffee, looking happy and relaxed in her mismatched flannel pajamas; the bottoms are Clint’s, the shirt is Bruce’s, which doesn’t necessarily mean anything even though Tony wants to read into it. Natasha stole a few pieces of Bruce’s clothing while he was away. She steals everyone’s clothes, but it’s still heartwarming to see whenever she lets her guard down, sheds a piece of her armor.
“Hey, my sweet little cherubs,” Clint says, “we’ve got some strays at the northwest corner of the street. One of you wanna wrangle ‘em back in?”
Steve just laughs, a soft chuckle that’s so genuine it makes Tony’s chest ache. The corners of his eyes scrunch up and his shoulders loosen, and Tony smiles back automatically.
are watching this. No, Steve, don’t laugh, this is scientific sacrilege. That’s not how that works!”
Mayhaps, Tony concedes. He remembers Steve’s face pressed against the pillow, his eyes reflecting light in the apple orchard, and the pain in his voice there. He genuinely doesn’t think so.
“Me too,” he says. And then, because it’s true but mostly because it’ll make Scott squirm, he says, “And, y’know, your old man’s one of the bravest weirdos I know, and a valuable asset to the Avengers, yadda, yadda, but I’m afraid there are just too many people wearing red these days, and I’ve gotta do something about it.”
Steve would think it’s nothing less than a miracle if he hadn’t known Tony personally for years. The thought makes his chest ache.
Despite how he keeps running from Steve, how he keeps pushing him away, he can’t imagine life without him. He thinks he might understand Steve’s panicked cross-country trip a little better, thinking of it like that.
Eventually, Tony takes a deep breath and reasons with himself. Steve has been doing so much better, he’s got the right idea lately even if his execution doesn’t exactly match up, or that’s the perception Tony thinks he has when he’s not in the middle of losing his shit.
“God, yes,” Rhodey groans. “It was awful. And I think we need to reimagine the coolant system because it started overheating again, and maybe that’s a nice feature in the middle of winter when I’m stranded outside, but mostly it’s just going to give me some wicked burns.”
Bruce’s conflicted feelings about the entire thing are confusing both of them, and Tony doesn’t think Bruce’s point-of-view is entirely uncommon.
“I know,” Rhodey says quietly, “but we knew. We knew there was something.” And then he gets even quieter, more to himself than even to Pepper, “There’s always something. At least—”
“Thanks, Peter,” Steve says, interrupting graciously. “And thank you for coming all the way up for the meeting, I really appreciate it.”
He lightly bangs his mug against the table in a mime of a judge’s gavel again, and wheels back a few inches to signal their freedom. With varying degrees of haste, the others follow his lead and start a low hum of chatter, collecting their things. Natasha nods when she catches his eye, and Tony lowers his chin in response.
Honestly, Tony’s of the opinion that thirty percent is rather high, but FRIDAY had thought that even forty percent (where they’d set it previously) was too low. He doesn’t know, really, there aren’t social norms that dictate how high a chance of success you should have before your AI has permission to drag around your corpse as a posable doll (at least, not the kind of social norms you can google).
“Fixed his spleen with the portable Cradle,” she says to Steve, voice hushed but not secretive. Wanda’s asleep now, but Vision and Sam are listening attentively, the others all quiet and in varying degrees of pretending to give them privacy. “The rest of the internal damage was fixed the old fashioned way. No collapsed lungs, which is a miracle considering the mess of his ribs. Too early to tell how long he’ll be out of commission.”
Tony remembers how fast Sam was to start reading the Accords when they first came back, thinks of the easy back and forth between them that had next to nothing to do with Tony’s usual charm or effort. He thinks Sam’s probably right. Anyone else he might not believe, but it’s Wilson and, despite everything, a part of Tony’s glad Steve had a friend when he was on the run, because God knows Nat would’ve been in and out, coming and going, and she was here at the compound for that last bit before everyone else came back too.
“I really think you’d be more comfortable out in the waiting room, and we can come get you when Captain Rogers is moved to a room.”
smirking?—that stills something in Tony. It makes him intrigued, genuinely curious and eager enough to see how Steve wants to play this out. When Steve reaches the chair Tony’s sitting in, he braces one hand on the arm, reaches with the other to cradle the back of Tony’s head, and leans in. Tony puts the tablet down to rest both of his hands on Steve’s chest, the swell of his pecs, a question in the movements:
“Had worse,” Steve mumbles, scrubbing at his face with the back of his hand. Clint sighs and rolls his eyes.
“Hey, Friday, hit Cap’s phone with that blackmail material, will ya?” Tony says. He doesn't know what he wants from this exchange, but he knows he’s going to have to change their track fast before they get any further. Then, as Sam comes back with a bottle for him and one for Steve, “Sam’s too.”
“Well,” he drawls, “I see Altair, which I know—visual magnitude of .77 and 16.7 lightyears from our sun—but no, I guess. What’s Aquila?”
“We get enough of this shit as it is,” Sam says, pointing at the screen the same way Howard used to point at the girls Tony brought home as a teenager.
Of everyone, though, Bucky's probably the one person at the compound who expects the least of Tony. Actually, due to his guilt complex, Bucky might be the one person on the face of the Earth who expects the least from Tony. At least, this is what Tony uses to reassure himself as he stands over the nearly fully assembled arm on the bench in front of him, looking over it just one more time for anything he can reasonably use to kill a few more minutes.
Steve’s lips are soft, and it’s not exactly one continuous kiss, but they bleed into each other enough that Tony can’t keep count. He tastes like pepperoni and onions and it should probably be gross but instead Tony finds it downright delightful—real, his brain screams at him, this has to be real. And he grins into Steve’s mouth, the air spasming in his lungs, not quite a laugh, and Steve huffs underneath him even though he can’t know what’s so funny, and then Tony’s kissing him again, and the kisses aren’t numbered, but they retreat and surge like a goddamn tide. Tony’s hand wandering into Steve’s hair, Steve’s blunt fingernails at his hairline, the tension is his neck when he lifts his head to get closer, to chase Tony.
Pepper’s eyes go impossibly sad, and Tony hates himself just a little bit. Their food arrives, then, deposited in front of them by a boy with his jeans cuffed. They both smile and thank him. The interruption stretches into a silence, and something in his head screams at him to let it go, to chat, ask more about London, anything else.
“Well then.” Steve heaves a great sigh. They’re sitting on the ground now, underneath their tree. Tony moved down a little while ago when he needed a moment to think through his response, and Steve followed. Now, Steve’s on the ground, leaning up against the trunk with his legs bent and Tony’s beside him, sitting on a small rock criss-cross so their knees touch. “Do you have an avenue in mind that would let us deal with the Wanda thing without singling her out?”
“FRIDAY?” Tony whistles like he’s calling a dog. (The image is stuck with him now.) “Girlie, no sleepin’  on the job.”
“I’m sure you’re just tired,” Steve reassured him. “JARVIS will let you back in after you’ve eaten and slept a little. Right, JARVIS?”
“Neither is this conversation,” Tony says. “Look, Rogers—I’m tired, you’re tired. Let’s, I dunno. Rest.”
“He’s not here,” Sam says, glancing at Steve, probably to make sure he’s not going to bolt or punch someone (Tony) in the face. Tony thinks it would be a nice gesture if he thought Sam was looking to protect his teammate from physical harm, but Tony’s pretty sure Sam just doesn’t want Steve to get in trouble right away.
Tony crawls in beside him, but doesn’t lay down, even as he runs fingers through Steve’s hair lightly.
Tony grins, wide and free, and wonders if Scott would accept an offer of the services of the best child psychologist on the West Coast or if he’d be insulted.
“Wait,” Tony tries to say, but his mouth is full of coffee, so it mostly comes out as grunt that means ‘I have something to say!’ And then, when he’s swallowed the coffee in his mouth, “Who’s Shuri?”
“But in that case,” Steve shrugs and it’s awkward with him lying on his side, but when he meets Tony’s gaze with such determination it’s more Cap than Steve, and Tony’s chest bites down on a wad of feeling. “We’ll fix it.”
Of Thor, who doesn’t run on the 24-hour day Earth happens to have, and who Tony’s never been particularly good friends with, but who Tony fell into the habit of sitting quietly with in the dead hours of the night shortly before Ultron destabilized everything. The faint surprise of finally seeing the older, quieter parts of the prince, who has lived through death and destruction and love in equal measures, the depths of which Tony doesn’t know how to comprehend. The settled feeling in his chest when he realized that, whether he could understand or not, Thor had still chosen them, the Avengers, as his brothers-in-arms.
“Well I would hate to get into an argument over semantics,” Tony says, smiling with his mouth and crinkling the corners of his eyes, “especially in this room. But I think I’m gonna have to call you out on this one, Tom—”
“You’re right,” Steve says, and Tony has to look away, down at the ground. “I thought—I really thought she was just, pulling a me.” He chuckles low in his chest, bitter. Tony closes his eyes at the sound, banishes the memory of Steve’s face in Siberia, enraged, resigned. It’s the expression he’d match with this laugh and he hates it, even though he knows it’s not directed at him.
“Happy birthday, man!” Sam says, smiling a smile small enough that it’s not out of place in the shabby safe house.
If he knew he’d be meeting Tony halfway, or at least trying. (Which is, maybe, not entirely fair, given that Bruce is here and talking and that’s more effort than he wastes on most human beings.)
Tony ducks his head and grins to himself as he steals the carafe to pour his first cup, putting it back just as fast to catch more of the brewing coffee. Clint Barton’s even worse with feelings than Tony, but he’ll take care of his own almost ruthlessly. He was absolutely shocked to find out what a mother hen the man was when the team first started, and even more surprised to find that Tony qualified as part of Clint’s
“Dark-Hoodie Jesus!” Tony greets because, really, standing there with his pinned hoodie sleeve, the long hair, and open expression, no other words will even come to mind. He tilts his head after the nicknames leaves his mouth, considering. “Huh. You really need a haircut—but! That’s definitely not why I asked for your presence in my humble abode.”
He expected to have to do at least a little searching, but the scuffle is immediately audible when he reaches 57th, and he finds a small drove of robots—all automated according to FRIDAY, none being piloted—outside of Carnegie Hall. A quick sweep of the area shows most civilians running for the hills, and the group of eighteen robots don’t seem to be spreading out or causing more than structural harm so far, though they are weaponized.
“We’re right here, Tony,” he says, raising his voice and angling his head so that the words have to be loud enough to reach Tony. And then Steve moves around to help pull Clint to his feet because he seems to be struggling. He’ll have someone check Clint over on the ’jet, he decides, and wraps Clint’s arm around his own shoulders to lead him out of the alley. The EMTs are strapping Tony down behind them, and they’ll need to follow an Avenger to know where to go to get Tony on board. Steve doesn’t want them taking any more time than they have to.
“What?” Steve’s probably blinking on the other end of the connection. Tony can almost hear him straightening up over a little jolt of genuine surprise.
“What kind of ideas?” Vision asks, demeanor polite but curiosity bubbling underneath, because Vision is the best, and definitely Tony’s favorite.
He grins to himself and reaches for the bottle of Dr. Pepper by the leg of the coffee table. It only takes a couple of minutes for Sam to text him again.
“Betcha ten bucks he’s just as frustrated as us about it,” Steve dares. They’re standing there still, facing the door and not each other.
Marcel’s is a small vegan cafe, though a fairly pricey one. This time of day it’s not quite crowded, and occupied by people dressed in business suits or the most expensive hobo clothes Tony’s seen in months. Tony himself is wearing a suit, simple and charcoal grey, and the HUD glasses. There are potted plants everywhere, and a hardwood floor so shiny it’s reflective. It smells like every kind of coffee imaginable and American Spirit cigarettes and some very potent essential oil perfume and car exhaust and weed. And holy hell, there’s so much, every person a walking storybook, all being thrown into his face at the same time. He finds himself contemplating the three separate (and clashing) rings on a man’s left ring finger before he even considers how he noticed them through the cacophony of other things, but—yes, when he looks at the armchair by the dessert display, there’s the man, there’s his finger with all three rings. He wonders what they mean.
People nod and start shuffling around. Steve breathes, and Natasha brushes their shoulders together as she walks by. Right, Steve thinks. Job’s not done.
“Look, Tones,” he said and, hey, he must’ve gotten that from Rhodey. It was enough of a shock that it freed Tony’s brain up the smallest bit. He took a breath. “There ya go. Whatever it is you’re seeing—”
Eventually, the building stops falling. Steve’s breaths are still too harsh, and he looks terrified to move. Tony would be too, scared of shifting a rock on top of them and setting off an avalanche, but the suit doesn’t let him.
“That only really went away when SHIELD fell,” he says. “We were just so high on the newfound freedom and afraid of authority we didn’t implement our own structures in its place.”
“Yeah,” Pete says, and it’s slower this time, like he actually is breathing, but he still sounds…not entirely reassured.
A low rumble overtakes the kitchen, and a nostalgia kicks up in Tony’s chest. He checks the news on his tablet and moves on to his second and third cups of coffee. Fox News is displeased, but it’s mostly nitpicking at this point. Tony seriously doubts anyone’s going to break down their door and haul them off to the RAFT over a few insurance claims. The rest of the major news networks are tentatively positive about the returning Avengers, and Tony honestly feels like he should be doing a touchdown dance.
“That’s the spirit,” Tony says, clapping him on the shoulder. The kid squirms, and it’s sort of like the way Bruce shifts his weight when he has something to add, so he cocks his head and stays quiet. Sure enough, it’s only a few seconds before Spider-Man opens his mouth again.
“I don’t care!” she wails. Tony knows she’s not a kid, not really, but she’s also so much younger than him, doused in so much heavy grief. Tony remembers what he was like at her age, volatile and burning with it. He just wasn’t ever so dangerous. “You were supposed to be our teammate! You left!”
And it’s obviously not that he can’t talk, because of course he can. And he can still communicate with language. He hums to himself while he works and he both receives and sends emails and texts. He simply doesn’t feel the overwhelming need to talk, to fill the silence, so he doesn’t.
He’s still camped out on the bathroom floor. His phone is propped up on the lip of the tub, and he’s been talking to FRIDAY for almost four hours. Tony’s still nauseous despite having already emptied his stomach entirely, which is just ridiculous. This whole thing is a joke. He’s Tony Stark.
“What,” Wanda says, sharp and about as defensive as Tony feared, “so if someone risks their life in the middle of a battle, if they put themselves on the line to save our asses, later we can just go—‘oh, sorry, not a good fit, I’m afraid, better luck next time? Hope all the people who just saw your powers don’t harass you too much?’”
“How can we be out of eggs?” Bruce asks from his spot on one end of the couch (they’ve expanded to fit most of the kitchen and living room, from the dining table to the kitchen counter to the recliner). “We get mass deliveries every week. We have enough eggs to feed a small army.”
“See?” Tony says. “That’s not nearly as nice. Nothing to soften the blow. Not even a little white lie.”
“It’s easy to be mad at you,” Bruce admits, and drags himself up to a sitting position, leaning back against the headboard.
Tony hadn’t slept a whole bunch the night before. A couple hours, but then he was awake again, a little restless, and so he’d slipped out of bed hours before Steve, snagging a coffee and heading for the workshop. Bucky’s arm is more or less done and ready for him (unless any other problems arise) and Tony’s doing suit redesigns, making sure everyone’s got a reinforced, stabilizing collar, with thick, reinforced Kevlar. The trick is making sure it doesn’t hinder mobility or visuals too much. A balancing act, the way he’s doing it now. He feels, distinctly, that there’s a better way to approach the problem. Maybe someone else will have a better idea. Maybe he’ll bring it up later, depending on who’s at dinner. Maybe he’ll email Shuri, see if she has any viable suggestions.
“I know,” Steve says. “And I’m not—being rash about this. I really do know. It has to be different or this is never going to work.”
“I should have a working prototype in…two weeks at most.” Then, more to himself than the company present, “Bloody hell, I’ve been sleeping on the job, wow.” And back to Bucky again, “Whatever, you’re lucky SI’s recently taken such an interest in prosthetic technology. Shouldn’t even take me that long to get started.”
“No!” Steve roars down the phone. Tony squeezes his eyes shut for an instant and Steve takes it as permission to go on. “I’m trying here. You could at least let me try.”
“Personally,” Natasha says, “nothing. In terms of the frankly ridiculous job of superhero work? Every right.”
then turns the complete opposite direction and walks the perimeter of the room a couple dozen yards until he finds an exit.
The message itself isn’t even strange, but he’s been sitting here in his living room in the chair that’s bordering on overstuffed but still looks sleek and fashionable, and he’s been staring at his phone for five minutes.
Tony pretends to be busy getting out a pair of pajamas and lingers at his dresser, trying to guess how long it’ll take for Vision to float out the door.
“Oh, don’t give me those eyes, Cap,” Tony said. “I’m trying to be—whatever, reassuring, here. If you start crying your fairy godmother’s gonna show up and give me the disappointed look and I am too tired for this nonsense, Rogers, cut me some slack.”
“Holy shit!” Tony says, just as a lucky shot gets him in the ankle, knocking the flight stabilizers out of whack and sending him careening for a sickening moment before he rights himself. Focus, he thinks.
They slate the team meeting for that weekend because Tony thinks it’s important for Spider-Man to be there, too, even if he’s not an official Avenger (yet). Happy's set to pick the kid up Friday after school, and the meeting they’re planning is casual, a round table discussion literally around their dinner table, and Tony hopes that having Steve already on his side will be enough to sway the worst of the defensiveness he anticipates from some of them.
“No, by all means,” Clint says. “Take a hit from the bots, or I think you might get a jawful of vibranium.”
The thing about that is that they’re still effectively pinned under God-knows-how-many-tons of concrete and glass and steel beams. They can’t move, even as their enemy picks their way slowly towards them. Tony looks down at Steve, at the fear he can see on the other man’s face.
“What’s his condition?” Steve asks, because he has to, because it’s Clint, his friend and teammate, one of the only ones of them to have a family depending on him.
“Right.” And yeah, now that Tony looks, he can see the thing’s muscles bunching and rippling as it tries to buck its way out of Wanda’s hold.
“Well,” Tony says. “Maybe if SHIELD gave a fuck about people or had gotten him help of literally any kind when he came out of the ice.”
(Steve does, is the crazy thing. He holds perfectly still and watches while Tony moves decidedly into his bubble and squint-stares at both of his eyes in turn.)
“No,” Tony had said, “I’m going to lock myself in my lab and disappear for days at a time, but sometimes that’s what I have to do, that’s just how I am and—”
Rhodey says and, yeah, Tony really should’ve seen that one coming. “Aw, man. You always did go for the assholes.”
But, of course, he catches sight of himself in the mirror. His scars are gone. It’s unsettling, alien. It doesn’t look like his, it’s not him.
But this is—contentment. He doesn’t think you’re supposed to chase contentment. Isn’t it a bit antithetical? He’s warm, and Steve might as well be transparent for all the truth Tony can read on his face now. Steve’s smile is gentling again, and the silence is stretching. It’s so good, he doesn’t know what to do with it.
but if he were any less science-oriented in his worldview, he might say his earlier anxiety attack was a gut instinct because things had been going too well and he just knew something had to give.
Unfortunately, by the time evening is solidifying into nighttime, Tony’s staring at the completed prototype for Bucky’s new arm.
“Seems a little double-standard-y,” Scott says. He doesn’t look peeved, really, just curious in the tilt of his head. “I mean—none of you were held to some list of criteria to see if you made the cut.”
“I know,” he says, and of course he does, of course it’s obvious. Steve knows that even, it was just too hard earlier, everything was going too fast and Steve wasn’t thinking. But, then again, what’s new?
This isn’t a fix of any kind between him and Bruce, but it loosens something in Tony’s chest when Bruce’s knee bumps into his own leg as he swivels closer to get a better look. It’s evidence that Bruce is willing to talk to him, to give him a chance.
it wasn’t true.) “My mind runs a hundred miles a minute and it takes in enough data from the world to actually do that, but when I get tired and the processing power’s a little off, the data just keeps pouring in sometimes and—”
Tony’s opening his mouth to say more—probably to explain the ambulance and where they’re going—when they turn out of the park and onto a real street, and Steve’s entire face screws up. He swallows two, three times, and then one of the paramedics is pulling Tony away and she and another maneuver Steve onto his side in time for him to not choke on his own puke.
“That’s what I came out here for was some peace and quiet,” he says, but his heart really isn’t in it. “I just didn’t wanna be rude and kick you out right away.”
on the bright side, i'm starting work on my senior project, so. if any of you would ever be interested in some of my original fiction, that'll be a thing that exists in a few months. so that's pretty exciting
“What I really wanna know,” Tony says, folding back onto the ground with a grace he’s never possessed until a couple days ago, “is who the hell was videotaping my pseudo-death when we were actively evacuating the area, what the hell.”
“Vision, Maximoff,” Steve says, “after you’ve gotten all the intel you can, start sweeping buildings, top to bottom. Sam, Tony, and Clint will give you the locations of any civilians they see.”
Me neither, Steve thinks fiercely, as fiercely as he can even as his body drifts farther and farther askew. Distantly, determinedly, he reminds himself: As long as Tony’s alive, we’ll figure it out.
They’re sitting pressed up against each other on the couch by this point and it’s all comfort and safety and a heavy tiredness and Tony’s so grateful that Rhodey’s still here, even at the price of his functioning legs, and he hates himself for thinking so. He can’t help but compare the feeling to sitting next to Steve on the couch back at the compound. They were pressed together similarly, but that had felt revolutionary, somehow, reckless and inevitable and like finally coming home.
“On my mark, I want you to release it,” Tony says. Wanda looks at him like he’s lost his mind. “I’ll hold it while you get a look. ’Kay?”
“You shouldn’t be able to hear that,” Steve says slowly, and Tony feels an irrational spike of irritation—
When you kill me, I’m pretty sure it won't be an accident, Tony doesn't say. At least Dum-E brought me my heart when I was dying instead of breaking it with the worst metaphor ever.
“He seems like a good one,” Steve says. He looks tired, head listless against the headrest, eyes half-lidded but definitely open—he’s smiling too, an exhausted and secret curve to his lips.
They’re both breathing hard when they roll to a stop, and Tony makes sure he’s braced to shield her from falling debris, even as he flips the faceplate up.
. If he could just get one person to understand maybe they’d talk sense into the others, because they clearly don’t even speak the same language anymore.
“Quiche," Tony says, pointing at him with the hand not holding his mug. “Can you make quiche? Do we have stuff here for quiche? I can make french toast.”
“My pleasure,” JARVIS says and, oh, right, they’re in the middle of the original Star Trek. Tony makes a happy humming sound next to him. They settle like that for almost half an hour before Tony speaks again, heavy and warm against Steve’s shoulder.
This is, of course, the moment Steve jumps out of the Quinjet without a parachute or a warning. The sun has officially set, but the CPD has set up floodlights along a couple of streets already, and Steve’s shield glints as he tumbles down to the earth.
“I keep thinking,” Bruce says, and that’s a sentence that never ends well for Tony, so he sighs and, to hide the way his shoulders slump, he rides the movement and sits on the edge of the bed, by Bruce’s hip, his elbows on his knees and his eyes on the ground. “If I’d been here when the Accords were proposed—and I just keep goin’ in circles, Tony. I don’t know what I would’ve done.”
He shoots off a message to T’Challa and gets to mass producing arrow shafts and some of the more basic arrowheads for Clint, some new cartridges for the Widow’s Bites, and, when he’s done with that and still has no helpful responses, a software update for Redwing. He doesn’t look up until FRIDAY turns the music down and announces Rhodey’s arrival.
“Stark?” Clint’s saying, taking a distinctive step forward. Tony swallows, swallows, swallows, and turns around so he’s gripping the rail behind him. He meets Clint’s eyes and just lets him see because where the fuck is he going to go? Tony’s more or less trapped, and thank the gods Clint’s in the mood to use that near-superhuman eyesight of his tonight, he’s so glad he doesn’t have to scrape for the words. Clint looks at him, and Tony knows Clint knows. He breathes, swallows again.
Natasha makes her excuses and heads farther into medical to see a man about Clint’s stitches. It doesn’t sound serious so Tony doesn’t ask. Sam falls into step with Tony.
“Healing factor,” Tony says, instead of any of that other stuff. “Heightened senses, it seems like. I’m not exactly sure what else. It’s a modified strain, and even before, there seemed to be some leeway with what effects would manifest in which subjects.”
Sam stays quiet for so long that Tony turns to face him fully, something in him refusing to be intimidated by a measured silence.
Tony catches Clint’s eye as he pops a bite into his mouth and grins the most shit-eating grin he can conjure. There’s no sick churning in his stomach for accepting this food. It’s from Vision, who…might give him food poisoning on accident, but wouldn’t hurt him on purpose, Tony’s pretty sure.
“Do you want some music?” Steve asks, already reaching for the radio. Tony reaches out and catches his wrist. Steve blinks at the road, but puts his hand back on the steering wheel when Tony lets go.
"Not really.” Steve puts his hand out and trails his hand across the leaves of a nearby branch as they pass. “Ever since we officially became a team, it’s been you dealing with insurance claims and holding press conferences and answering phone calls from D.C. at all hours of the night. And I thought…”
The elevator car vibrated slightly around them, just the hum of machinery. Nothing, really. It had maybe been too long since Tony last slept, and he was on edge. Too many deadlines, too much pressure, too much everything. He felt raw and exposed, like an eyeball without a lid. The ding as they reached the common floor was grating, and Tony sucked in a slightly desperate breath before he had to step into the living room.
Vision’s dumping the eggs, yolks, whites, bits of shell and all, down the disposal, Tony himself sets the coffee to start percolating and blinks owlishly in the bright lights of the kitchen. He can smell things too: the antiseptic from Clint’s injuries, something’s getting close to spoiling in the fridge, the container of dill that wasn’t closed properly, Scott’s morning breath—God, from all the way over here? That’s just not fair.
tell them and he’s actually trying to give Tony a heart attack. Clint laughs, even as he clings to Tony’s side, and Tony could drop him right now, it would be so easy.
“Hey, Rogers!” Tony reaches out and catches Steve’s arm. It’s not enough force to stop a super-soldier, but thankfully Steve stops anyway.
The advice had followed him. By the time he met Rhodey, Tony was firmly in the habit of shoving his anxiety down and using the residual jitters to move, to work, to
“The company I work for is, in fact, in the city,” Happy says, but his eyes are laughing. “Maybe if you came downstate more…”
that he can’t say anything for a few seconds. The words are designed to hurt, and it would be satisfying, making Steve feel just a modicum of the terrible injury Tony himself had been left to fester in, but they’ve made progress and it wouldn’t be right. Tony reminds himself fiercely that it would feel good for only a fraction of a second, and only build the momentum of the verbal battle.
“As we’ve established: everything, but mostly I’m referring to that thing you said about me fighting Steve so hard because I was into him. Though, to be entirely fair, I. Well, one, I would’ve fought him anyway because I have something of a personal moral code these days, it’s kind of this whole thing—”
“We couldn’t find Richards,” Natasha says as she sets the ‘jet down. “Bruce and Vision are trying to figure out where their commands are coming from.”
There are at least 25 bots in the clearing around him by now, and he’s not entirely sure where they’re coming from.
“I’m too old to be sitting on the floor this long,” Tony says, and he groans theatrically has he stands up and holds out a hand for Rhodey to take.
There’s something approaching guilt that pulls in the pit of his stomach. A twinge that reignites the spark of ever-present anger, refreshingly aimed at Steve more than himself.
“What?” Tony says as he flops back down on the bed, finally undressed the rest of the way. He settles on his side, elbow propping his head up, and reaches a hand out to touch Steve’s side, just because he can. He nods toward the trash can. “Can’t make the shot?”
“A natural leader,” Tony echoes. “And I was a natural businessman, or I at least knew the terrain. And, sure—I mean, we definitely didn’t handle the team ideally by any stretch of the imagination. We should’ve at least divvied up duties clearer, or communicated our roles in some kind of way.”
“What is it,” Steve whispers. He’s frozen a couple feet away from Tony, afraid of somehow making it worse (though he’s not sure that’s possible). Then, louder, “FRIDAY! What happened?”
When Tony’s parents died, he got Obadiah Stane. The man who hired the Ten Rings to take him out years later, and then tried to do it himself when that didn’t work. Steve doesn’t know what their relationship was like before, if it was ever actually good, but he has a hard time believing that hiring a terrorist organization in Afghanistan would’ve been Stane’s first attempt at removing Tony. Tony wouldn’t have met Pepper yet at that point. Rhodey would’ve been there in some capacity because he and Tony went to school together, but Steve knows that Rhodes was already on the military path, and he knows what it’s like to be left behind for that.
Think, Tony tells himself. If Bruce is here and Tony himself is in a hospital—or in medical at the compound, now that he’s looking—then something exciting definitely happened.
“We’ve got a job to do,” Tony says, trying his best not to slur his words. He looks straight into Steve’s eyes, though he doesn’t dare lift the faceplate. “Together.”
Just as vague, just as unspecific, as Steve always seems in his rallying speeches. Blind hope and drive, the need to dive in.
So he lays there for hours uninterrupted, longer than most of his nights spent actually sleeping in adulthood, and he just can’t. Fall. Asleep. Even though he hasn’t slept in days, since the virus was introduced to his biology along with alien venom that definitely should’ve killed him and, oh, God, what if it’s some kind of interaction between the virus and the venom, something that’s killing him, but slowly? Or—worse—what if it’s just working him towards a psychotic break?
He thanks her and shuts the line down again, focusing on dodging. While they’re not terribly smart, they do seem to be linked, making their coordination a little uncanny.
. He does it again and can hear Steve’s breaths puffing against the receiver on the other end. Steve knows how the phones work, but sometimes he gets distracted and holds it a little too close to his mouth, like a radio. Tony really wishes he didn’t know such random shit about Steve.
“Hello?” he says into the receiver after he’s flipped it open and, really now, he’s lucky he didn’t break it in half by accident. He’s out of breath, he realizes distantly, which is frankly ridiculous.
Tony stares, waits for the catch, the rest of the speech. There are so many holes in this plan of action he doesn’t even know where to start. First of all, it’s more like a plan of inaction, and Tony doesn’t do well with inaction, and neither does Steve he’s pretty sure. Plus, this is really the sort of thing that needs a contingency or twelve. Personal feelings aside, they’re Avengers, and this is literally their job, to be prepared for the worst possible outcomes.
Tony putters for a minute or two, trying to get people bored enough to be calm. It works, mostly; more than a couple pairs of eyes glaze over. Bruce is looking ready to check out of the conversation entirely when Tony decides to move on.
“The Brood virus and Extremis,” he says. “They’re—fighting. One of them might come out on top, or a combination of both of them. Or neither. It’s a lot of strain on his body, Tony’s heart hasn’t been strong for a while.”
“I really thought—” Steve breaks himself off, looks Tony directly in the eye like he’s an opponent to face down, like something to fight, but when he speaks, it’s to say, “I was terrified. I was scared you weren’t going to wake up at all, or that we’d be too late getting you here, or that there’d be nothing we could do for you.”
“I see you somehow managed to keep this a secret. Such a good boy,” he complimented, fishing a bottle of water from the messenger bag he'd left behind earlier. He moved back around to the front of the workbench and smiled, cooing, “You must be thirsty, love.”
He walked around to the front of the desk, just as pleased with this view as he had been from behind. He leaned forward and coaxed the dark-haired man's head up with a hand under his chin. He studied those hazy, half-lidded eyes a while, then leaned down and kissed his counterpart's forehead.
,” Tony snarked at him and he could practically hear the man's eyes rolling, making him chuckle. “I'm going to have bruises everywhere by tomorrow, you know.”
His smile grew wicked as realization widened his lover's eyes; yes, it was going to take all night and the billionaire would be absolutely exhausted well before the end, but Rogers had super soldier stamina and Tony had been begging for his full efforts for months. No sense in disappointing him by stopping before the end.
The billionaire felt his orgasm building rapidly, tried to find some way to stave it off, but his paramour was driving ruthlessly against his prostate and he was practically sobbing the man's name. He felt the wave surging up, saw it towering over his head, ready to crash down, and then Steve said, voice gravelly with lust but no less commanding for it, “Tony. Look at me.”
“No, I know that, I've- Look, I know he wasn't in his right mind when he killed my parents, okay? I'm... working on that.” If anything, that seemed to confuse Steve even further.
“Oh! Captain Rogers, hello!” greeted the kind older woman behind the desk, flashing a warm, motherly smile. It was fairly comical, since Steve had her beat by almost 40 years.
He uncapped the water and hooked one finger past the line of the makeshift gag, pulling it down. He let the billionaire take a few unobstructed breaths, then tipped the bottle to his lips. Despite the wordless complaints he received, he only gave his partner small sips at a time, not wanting to overwhelm his system. After letting him work through half the bottle, Rogers capped it and set it aside, strolling behind the desk once more.
They laid there for a while, Steve still buried deep inside Tony, lying half on top of him, both of them panting and shivering with aftershocks, pressing tired kisses into the nearest patches of skin. Then the kisses became more heated, turned into nibbles, hands came up to roam over flesh, cocks filled, and passion overtook them again.
straight to his cock and the captain stripped the silk boxers from his partner, tossing them carelessly aside, simultaneously adjusting Tony's hips where he wanted them. With deft hands, he undid his own pants, expression turning perfectly sinful as he saw realization wash over his captive.
, I know I fucked up, I see that now, I've known it for a while, actually, and I'm so goddamn sorry. I wish I could take it all back, I wish I hadn't said all that stuff, I shouldn't have attacked you at the air-”
Steve let out a soft breath of relief, probably thought it couldn't be heard through the phone, but yay, StarkTech. Take that!
“I missed you so much,” he heard, words rumbling through Steve's chest and buzzing in his ear, fingers combing through his hair.
before the whole frozen-for-seventy-years thing? Because, you know, it's been two years and you've been with him the whole time, and I've been here, and, well, I wouldn't blame you, things just happen, old romances rekindle. I just don't want to get in the way and I can't do
The super soldier's eyes fastened on the dark-haired man's Adam's apple as it bobbed with a nervous swallow and he accepted Tony's nod with a twitch of his lips, leaning down to nibble at the delicate skin around the mass of cartilage. Without another word, he canted his hips forward, pressing back in at a glacial pace, knowing full well that his counterpart was feeling the tantalizing friction in every nerve ending. He adored the way his lover withheld his voice, muscles tight and trembling with effort. Steve lavished his throat and collarbone with thorough attentions, contradicting the urgency of his mouth with languid rolls of his hips, designing the perfect method to unravel the billionaire's self-control.
He rolled his eyes fondly at her little joke and gave her a wave, trailing toward the exit, content that Tony would be safe until his return. Not that he was going far... just in case...
“Maybe,” he murmured into it, “I'll stay just like this, buried inside of you, until you're squirming and begging for me to move. Maybe I'll take off the gag just to hear that pretty voice.”
Phil Coulson, the latter of the pair interjected, “Allow me to show you the way,” and, yeah, there was definitely going to have to be a conversation about why the hell Phil knew the layout of the new compound despite having never stepped foot into it until today. Oh, and also about
“I mean it,” Tony maintained, but the momentary spark of not-so-bad was gone, and it came out sounding dismal. He swallowed heavily and requested once more, “Come home to me.”
The blonde dove in for a kiss, resuming his exuberant rhythm, then trailed away from Tony's lips to lick and nip at the sensitive flesh of his throat. The billionaire obliged his unspoken need, adding Steve's name to his verbalizations, each utterance earning him a sharp bite or deep kiss or particularly enthusiastic thrust. One of the latter made contact with his prostate, stars exploding across his vision, and he shouted his pleasure and knew he was doomed. Sure enough, Steve aimed for that spot again, and it became a cycle: Tony said Steve's name, Steve angled for the sensitive bundle of nerves as a reward, making Tony shout his name, encouraging Steve to do it again, round and round.
“Some,” the billionaire admitted, only half-listening to the conversation, mostly distracted by beautiful musculature and the deep-seated ache stirred up by his recent movements, reminding him exactly what that walking epitome of human perfection had done to him; he was going to have trouble sitting comfortably today and that suited him just fine. “The rest is in your room down the hall. I wasn't sure you'd want this anymore, so I made you your own room, just in case.”
He'd fucked up, and he knew it now, but he really had thought he'd been doing the right thing then. He'd been so afraid, so scared of losing all the people he'd come to love – and wasn't
He raised an eyebrow in bewilderment as Steve turned to stare at him, something warm and a little sad tinging his expression. He wondered if his mouth had gotten him into trouble again – it often did, especially when he wasn't paying attention to what he was saying, and he really hadn't been a moment ago.
Tony knew that was the end of the conversation, so he said as sincerely as he'd ever said anything in his life, “I love you, too, Steve. I miss you.”
Lips and tongue and teeth assaulted Tony's mouth, and he found himself responding in kind, all his frustration poured into the kiss-turned-battle.
There was a brief instant of silence, then raucous laughter shook the room, Tony catching the look of disbelieving shock on Steve's face, certain he was wearing one to match.
“You're a dick,” Tony replied, wounded and strained. There was silence, so he added, “Everyone thinks Captain America's so damn nice, but you're a dick.”
“That's what Bucky said, too,” Steve laughed, getting another whine in response. His voice was suddenly soft and sincere as he said, “It's always been you, Tony. It's always and only been you.”
He buried his cock deep, then propped himself up onto his hands, face openly displaying self-satisfaction. He was thrilled with the petulant look that was aimed at him when Tony finally opened his eyes, grin unrepentant as he said, “Sorry. You lose.”
Hawkeye tipped his head back and to the side to level his gaze on Tony, saying, “I assume I've got a room here, yeah? I'm going to be making use of it now.”
Steve abruptly flipped Tony over, snatching him backward so that his arms were stretched in front of him, held crossed at the wrists by the straps securing them, chest pressed to the tabletop, spread out so far that he was barely standing on the balls of his feet, ass exquisitely presented. Without missing a moment, the captain plunged back inside of him, hips snapping a rhythm so harsh the workbench shuddered despite being bolted solidly to the floor.
Tony woke in a mild panic, convinced that yesterday had been an illusion – he'd had many similar, if less detailed, dreams of his reunion with Steve, and woken up to a cold bed and a heavy heart – but was lulled instantly by the warm body he was snuggled up to, inhaling the scent of soap and leather and
“Shhh,” he soothed sweetly, “I'm here. Why don't we sit you down, hm?” He settled himself into his paramour's chair, strong arms carefully guiding the billionaire down onto his lap.
Phil had admitted to giving the coordinates of the new compound to the ex-outlaws, following up with a thinly-veiled comment about hoping there were enough rooms for everyone (surely in retaliation for being pestered), and Tony was still proud of himself for managing to sound flippant as he smoothly answered that there were. He wouldn't admit it, not even to himself most times, but he'd designed the new property with the assumption that his team would one day be whole again, even assigning private spaces to Pepper, Rhodey, and Peter Parker (who came to visit often enough that he deserved his own room). To most everyone else, it seemed like the typical Stark over-extravagance, a slew of empty rooms that would probably remain unused, except, perhaps, if collaborating heroes needed a temporary place to board until whatever crisis was over.

As much fun as it was to tease Tony, to make him worry, Steve would be none too happy if someone actually did see him that way. He was not only concerned with how it would affect his lover (professionally and emotionally), but he was an admittedly jealous man; the only person allowed to see that exquisite display was himself. He liked to believe he wasn't prone to violence outside of work, but he would certainly make an exception in this case.
Tony clenched his jaw so tightly, it was a wonder he didn't crack his teeth. He squeezed his eyes shut, tried to somehow not hear the words, even as he longed to drown in them.
Tony's heart seized in his chest at the despair that washed over Steve. He had to make it stop, had to wipe that horrible expression off his face, had to quell the tears that were shining in blue eyes, so he grabbed Steve and held him, kissed him fiercely.
“No, really,” the latter insisted, but the amusement was slowly giving way to contented warmth, “it's very nice. I didn't know you could grow a beard.”
It was delicate work, but Steve had always performed well under pressure. The physical blueprints and tools Tony was using for this project were laid out to his right, between him and the hidden-in-plain-sight man, but his gaze was glued to the projections before him. The super soldier took advantage of that intense focus, surreptitiously swiping items one by one and laying them out in a disguised pattern that led to his end of the table. It took time and careful planning, but he was finally satisfied with his work. He then knelt next to his messenger bag and fished out the contents, working quickly beneath the desk to lay the final piece of his trap. Finally, all he had to do was wait.
“You're a stupid, self-sacrificing, horrible boyfriend. Why do you have to be such a good fucking person? Why can't you let me hate you?”
Unable to keep the blush from his face, the blonde ducked his head and scrubbed a hand across the back of his neck, feeling his dress shirt stretch tightly across his chest. He knew how it looked, knew without looking the expression of appreciation directed his way, and he hurried off.
Two years! Yes, it had been two years! Two years full of pain, and fear, and misery, and loneliness, and fear, and doubts, and fear, and anger, and
The captain took some deep breaths, somewhat winded from the effort of their actions and the headiness of his orgasm, laying himself across Tony's back to rest. He pressed lazy kisses to the nape of the billionaire's neck, listening to him pant, feeling him shudder with aftershocks. He floated in the blissful glow for a few moments, then gently disengaged, fighting down the arousal that stirred when the tech genius let out a soft whine as he pulled out. He took a step back and admired his work, his paramour splayed out for him to see, semen dripping from his waning hard-on, a tiny bit slipping from his abused ass; it was enough to make the super soldier a little dizzy.
“I'm so sorry,” he rushed out, voice threatening to break on the words. He swallowed and soldiered on. “I'm so sorry for
Steve rolled his eyes fondly and closed the space that separated them, folding one hand around the back of Tony's neck, drawing him in close.
” for a while now. “Deal?” He punctuated the word with a teasing, shallow thrust, impressed when all it elicited was an intake of breath; Tony was not a quiet man by any measure of the word, most certainly not when it came to carnal pleasures.
“Shh,” he warned softly, voice gravelly with desire, feeding on the confused-yet-lustful expression on Tony's face. He felt a devilish grin curl his lips, adding, “You don't want someone to hear us, do you?”
” came the dramatic response and a hand flapped in his general direction. “Down at that end of the desk, feel free to move whatever's in your way, except any tech – don't touch it! It might explode.”
He was just beginning to think he might run (whether toward or away from Steve, he didn't know), desperately trying to keep his emotions and thoughts locked down until he could process them in private, when a small hand on his bicep made him jump. He whipped his head down to find Pepper at his arm, holding it protectively, looking up at him with eyes that promised she would do whatever he needed, even if that meant going toe-to-toe with Captain America, and he loved her so much in that moment. A larger hand landed on his opposite shoulder and Rhodey was there, expression carefully neutral as he considered Steve across the space; it was doubly impressive to Tony, being that the pilot was a huge Cap fan and all, and hadn't had the time to properly
“You thought I wouldn't want to be with you?” Steve asked him quietly, and Tony felt an embarrassed blush creep across his cheeks.
As his wounded pride – he had marked Steve up just as beautifully, even if those marks would fade fairly quickly with the Serum-heightened healing factor, and now his work was going unadmired – was deciding whether to burn the offending articles or just shred them, Peter (and when the hell had he arrived?) piped up from over his bowl of cereal.
He loved a stubborn man, a man with the heart of a lion and the bullheadedness of... well, a bull. A stubborn lion-bull that he'd almost had convinced to see his side of things, but then he'd opened his big mouth – he never knew when to shut up, never saw himself digging his own grave until he looked up and realized how far away the sky was – and had babbled one moment too long, shot himself in the foot without evening knowing he held a gun, and everything shattered. The man he loved denounced the injustice of it all, refused to agree to the terms, and had gone so far as to walk away, several friends and other heroes flocking after him.

Steve brought his head up from where it had been worrying a dark hickey into Tony's collarbone, staring down at him with his piercing gaze, and the tech genius gazed back, anticipation fluttering through every nerve ending. All he said was, “Steve,” and the blonde's eyes sparked with something (or a hundred somethings) unidentifiable and he thrust inside.
Also, just in case it wasn't clear - I didn't know how to make it clear without dragging it on too long - the "deadly green gaze" belongs to one Ms. Pepper Potts. I love Pepper portrayed as a good friend to Tony and she's definitely always been the one person who could get him to do anything. I just imagined the Team getting frustrated with being unable to get Tony moving, so they called in the big guns, i.e. Pepper. And she marched in (in her usual fashion), gave him that no-nonsense do-what-I-say-because-I'm-always-right, and lovingly threatened him.
Tony moaned, whimpered, and growled as Steve covered him with that Serum-perfected body, tucked perfectly into the hollow between the billionaire's legs, those wonderful hands rasping across his skin, playing with his nipples, pumping his cock. He bucked and arched into the touches, his own fingers scraping blunt nails down that broad back, leaving red lines and shudders and groans in their wake. He kissed Steve at every chance, devouring him desperately, licking away the blood that kept welling up from the wound he'd left, cruelly satisfied with every taste of copper. He felt his paramour lift his thigh, grip certain to leave imprints, and then there was a pressure against his ass.
Steve held him tight, surged up into the kisses, gently rolled him onto his back, swapping their positions so that he was the one propped on an elbow when they parted, looking down at Tony with pure adoration. The tech genius grinned at him, reached up for another quick peck, then felt doubt dim the smile.
“Let me make it up to you,” Steve needled, pouring on the persuasion with that devilish boy-next-door charm.
He opened his eyes – when had he closed them? – as Steve slowed to a halt and found sky blue, pupils blown, drinking in his image with a thirst he couldn't understand. He knew he'd been talking, wondered what he'd said that could bring such a sorrowful, desperate look through all the rage that had been there before.
He hadn't realized the room had gone hushed, too focused on the man across from him, neither of them having moved an inch since their staring contest had begun, but it hit him all at once when Natasha's voice quietly suggested, “Why don't we all give them some time alone?”
It would hit him at random times, times that made no sense, when he least expected it – in the shower, drinking the day's first cup of coffee, in the middle of a meeting. Most of the time, it seemed arbitrary, but he started to pick up on the hidden pattern: a song they used to dance to, playing in the background; a shirt, wadded up and dropped next to the laundry basket; a statement someone made that paralleled the strong morals of his missing paramour. Sometimes it was a dull ache in his chest, a lump in his throat, maybe tears in his eyes; sometimes it would drop him to his knees, as powerful as any physical blow, and he'd feel himself falling apart, scrambled to pick up the pieces, to hold himself together.
Rogers was a patient man, something that a certain brilliant mind claimed was a very annoying quality, yet it had always served him well and did so again. As he knelt on the floor, tucked up under the workbench, pretending to be installing whatever wires an IT guy “
Grey eyes stared sightlessly, unfocused, looking through him – maybe into him? He didn't like it. His own eyes narrowed, the same challenging glare he'd often used to get a rise, but it wasn't working now. Of course it wasn't, but some stupid little part of him wanted desperately for those grey eyes to turn blue, like the sky, like his dreams, to change to the color they ought to be, to focus on him. He didn't care if they turned angry or sad – hell, he'd even take hurt, if it meant those eyes were looking at him; he could make hurt go away. He wanted those brows to draw down, those perfect lips to issue forth whatever words they wanted, if only to hear the rich timbre of that voice that plagued him in wakefulness now as it had been plaguing him in dreams for months.
“It’s still true,” Tony says, and he shrugs, telling himself not to tense up. “I got used to relying on you. I don’t know if it would’ve been simpler or more complicated with you here for everything, but I wish you’d been there anyway.”
“Good,” Steve says, and he sounds about as relieved as Tony feels. “Let’s do this quick and clean, Avengers.”
“Bruce Banner,” Bruce says, and Steve opens his eyes to realize he’d closed them tight. Bruce is stepping forward, offering a hand to Bucky warily.
“Better tell Maximoff to start getting warmed up,” Tony says, and makes himself smile back. “She might get to take a few free shots at me.”
“Tony,” Steve had said, a hand on Tony’s jaw and a smile on his face, big a dopey. God, he never thought he could be so happy in this new century, never thought he could look at another person and think,
And yet, Tony tells himself. And yet here they are. That shouldn’t fix everything but it should mean something. It has to mean something.
And then the Quinjet’s there, and Tony relaxes that much more. This is good, they’ve all got each other’s backs. This is so far from the biggest thing they’ve faced together. Hell, there was a time when they were dealing with lunatics in Central Park almost on a weekly basis.
Tony’d been afraid he’d have to extrapolate on that since it’s admittedly pretty vague, but Steve’s smile softens into something like a sincere expression and Tony counts it as a win.
Not in so many words, Steve thinks. He remembers the blackening puncture wound on Tony’s hip, though, remembers asking himself what else that could be. He’d been blindly hoping by not asking for confirmation. A lie of omission he told himself, but he wasn’t clueless. He’d described the injury to the medical team on the Quinjet, just hadn’t put a name to it.
“If that’s an option, then fine,” Natasha says. “If it’s a question of vomiting and dry heaving, you might be better off with something to give up. Just saying.”
He waits a good ten seconds to hang up, and then flips the phone closed. Maybe they didn’t fix anything, or even really talk about anything, but they did talk. The hopelessness from earlier has lifted if not disintegrated, and Steve puts the phone back in his pocket, as awkwardly as it fits.
“I’m starting to get that learning to listen to you is more than learning to listen,” Steve says, and he looks a little stupidly proud of himself.
“Yeah,” Tony says, and it’s only a half-lie. “There are things that can be done, of course. I’m not a squishy-parts doctor, much less a psychologist, but there’s—therapy, and maybe even the BARF tech if we’re careful about it. And I’ve got a couple ideas floating around for the arm already—”
He takes the scissors, touches one of the short blades to the base of his thumb, and slides it across to make a shallow cut. Blood beads quickly, and Tony pushes his hand forward just in time to catch the blood in the sink. He ignores the impulse to put pressure on it, and puts it under the tap instead, rinses it out. Before his eyes, the water turns pink as it washes away and he can see the skin start to knit itself back together. Strangely enough, it itches. Tony wrinkles his nose; the sting of the cut is quickly obliterated by the weirdly alien feeling of his body healing itself. But God does it itch. He pulls his hand out of the stream of the sink and makes two smaller cuts, each crossing the first, healed cut. And holy shit, it’s really no wonder how Captain America got to be such a reckless goddamn idiot when the physical consequences to his actions just disappear like that.
“If you honestly think I didn’t have a problem with that,” Steve says, shoulders rigid, arms uncrossed now as he stands up straight in the doorway, “then having a building dropped on your head must’ve given you brain damage after all.”
There’s really nowhere left to sit by the time he and Steve get everything distributed, so they sit cross-legged in front of the coffee table, and it’s surprising to Tony how little it physically hurts (as in: not at all). His joints don't ache when he folds himself down onto the floor, and maybe it’s not the most comfortable place, but it’s so incredibly easy.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” She said with that little smile that totally acknowledged that, yes, she would be going to give Pepper a good time as soon as she was done here. Good, Pepper could use someone to help her unwind every now and then.
BUCK-E was still debating the likelihood of whether Rogers was actually sincere, when Tony woke up for the day. When the man smiled up at him, it made BUCK-E put all of those thoughts into a .save file to come back to another time, Tony deserved his full attention.
“That's the spirit.” He turned to look at his new companion and saw him wipe the smallest smirk off his face. Good, it meant there was a personality lurking somewhere in those servos, just waiting to come out. He was (only very minorly) getting nervous that he had messed up somewhere in the code and had ended up with a glorified Alexa, “Come on, Pinocchio, wasn't joking about needing caffeine, and I'm sure a real boy like you will enjoy trying everything out.”
"That would have made waiting until you were asleep to call him completely pointless. He apologized to me for his behavior.”
What worried her even more was how quickly he found the bug that she had planted. Not 15 minutes after she had left before he had it. The last thing it recorded was the man saying "I’m told it's rude to surveil people without their consent, Agent Romanoff." before abruptly cutting off.
It was tempting to just turn the vibratior on and hold it to his cock but that wasn’t what he wanted.
“Bucky?” Steve tried very hard not to make a face at the odd name – trying to be polite no doubt, because he had no reason to suspect that BUCK-E was anything but a man sitting on their couch – but Tony could see the way his eyebrow wanted to twitch upward.
“Are the two of you really having sex?” And there was that blush, Tony knew from experience that it went all the way down to his nipples.
That didn’t assuage any of her fears. It just meant that Steve thought he could handle whatever this man was capable of dishing out -- statistically unlikely with Steve’s track record of getting in over his head.
It turned out his precaution was for nothing because even at two in the morning, woken from a dead sleep, Rogers had been calm and remorseful.
He could almost hear the processors working while BUCK-E tried to figure out what to do. If he was searching the Internet he was sure to be overwhelmed by the options, new AIs always seemed to be. In truth, there wasn't much he could have done besides exactly what he already was.
Tony rocked back into his hands, silently asking for more. BUCK-E gave another squeeze, massaging the muscles with his fingers. He was enjoying how the man squirmed on top of him when he kneaded just right.
This new rule felt much like Tony's rule about not surveilling people unless given explicit permission to do so, nebulous and without any real reason. If no one knew he did it, what did it matter if he gave himself access to this woman's phone? What did it matter if he knew if Steve Rogers was not getting shot at this moment? It hurt no one for him to avail himself of this information that was so poorly guarded.
By the time BUCK-E added a third finger, Tony was mostly working himself back onto BUCK-E’s hand. The finger slid in as smoothly as BUCK-E could have hoped for, but it did throw the man off his rhythm, making his hips stutter with the extra pressure. It may also have had something to do with the way BUCK-E crooked his fingers to dig into the man’s prostate just so.
"Steve?" Tony called out to him, but like hell he was going to show them just how affected he was. He'd already foolishly assumed that the Avengers had become a pack. It would only be icing on the cake if everyone else realized his mistake too. He didn't need their pity!
"Do you realize it's 3 a.m. or do you just not care? Do you hate me?" Steve had that this-had-better-be-good pissy voice going but she was too on edge to care. He had made this her problem and he could damn well deal with it. Steve was usually up half the night when he was away from his nice warm bed at home anyway. There was every chance he hadn’t even been asleep.
He smiled into BUCK-E's shoulder. It was such a good idea to watch the Princess Bride yesterday. Just the best idea he’s ever had really.
BUCK-E wondered how many times Steve Rogers had been shot, and if that was one of the reasons Tony was so upset that he was gone. If Tony were in any situation where he might be shot, BUCK-E thought he would be upset as well.
"We've all been trying to court you as our pack Omega. I was starting to think you didn't want to be, no matter how happy you always looked to have the attention."
“Did you know he's sleeping with your husband?” Natasha only suspected -- based on Tony's body language and the way 'Bucky' seemed to take his cues from Tony. It was perhaps a bit of a stretch but her gut was rarely wrong.
BUCK-E took hold of Tony’s hip with one hand and his cock with the other to help guide himself into position. He was thankful for the hand on Tony’s hip when the man predictably tried to sink down immediately, BUCK-E was beginning to understand that Tony had no self-restraint to speak of.
Steve nodded vigorously. His legs felt like jelly and after a very frustrating completely unsatisfying heat he would very much like Tony to make it up to him.
“You are Tony’s husband so I assume the two of you have sex, at least when considering Tony’s sex drive. You wouldn’t be as compatible if your own wasn’t similar, so I imagine you would like to have sex with him often when the opertunity presents itself. I also would like to have sex with Tony often, and it doesn’t seem fair to make him choose between the two of us.”
Sorry for the long break, I worked 130 hours in the last 2 weeks. Anyway here is what everyone has been waiting for!
He had been going for realistic and aesthetically pleasing, so the android was tall and broad with long, silky, brown hair that was perfect for tugging and a jawline meant for nipping at with the perfect amount of stubble to leave beard burn wherever it went. When the automaton opened his eyes, they would be an intense grey. It had taken a while to work out the eyes but they would contract and expand just like an organic pair would to stimulus, not to mention emotion, if Tony did his job right, which he had, because he was Tony fucking Stark. Jarvis was as much a person as a bodiless AI could be, so he was confident in his abilities.
"I had my heat and nobody bothered to show up!" That was too loud, he was shouting at his alpha. No wonder everyone stayed away, what kind of Omega did that?
Sorry for not paying on a schedule. I truly don't know why I thought I'd be able to do such a thing... Here's the next chapter❤️
“Mr. Barnes, if you could please stand in front of the sheet? I’ll take a picture and finish off your new ID,” She gestured to BUCK-E and Tony had to wonder exactly what Steve had told her about the android.
Tony started begging but it was soft and the audio quality was poor so there were only a few words Steve could make out -- please, more, and need to come were the most used phrases. The reason it was so captivating was because Tony had turned to look almost directly at the camera, begging the person just off screen with his eyes and his words and his cries of ecstasy to let him orgasm.
“So Nat, you’re sure doing this favor for Steve has nothing to do with another redhead we both know? I suppose it’s just a coincidence that she just happened to take the next two days off very suddenly…” Tony had seen looks passed between the two of them and while Natasha was fantastic at deflection, he could read Pepper like a book. Sure, he had thought her good mood before was just because the press conference had gone well and he had behaved through dinner with the execs -- not a single comment about how they were relics who couldn't see the next big thing if it were a glowing beacon of clean energy right in front of them -- but now he understood it was because she would be getting a visit from their favorite super spy.
Once the toy was no longer blocking his ability to think, Steve wound the cord until he could see the remote and turn the damn thing off.
I've been working 12 to 14 hour shifts since Friday, I almost forgot it was time to post! I made it with an hour to spare. Hope everyone liked this chapter. Till next time ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
to be cryptic but he sure succeeded. Tony almost laughed when he saw Nat's mask crack a bit as she furrowed her brow at that nonanswer.
Technically Tony wasn’t even supposed to know her real name but then again he was Tony Stark and far too nosy for his own good. That had been interesting, finding out that his new secretary was actually investigating his company for treason and selling weapons to terrorist cells was a hell of a wakeup call. Between the two of them, they had found a few leaks, but Tony and Natasha both agreed that there was something missing in the picture that neither of them could find.
Steve didn’t want to just guess what Tony was feeling in that video, he wanted to experience it. He had to
For a few long minutes Tony and Steve just stared at each other through the monitor. Tony wasn’t sure what to say and Steve had that constipated look on his face he got whenever he was psyching himself up to have an uncomfortable conversation.
He had expected the man to be angry that he was made to wait for BUCK-E, instead of being immediately gratified.
“I was just- I mean- I,” And just like that Tony knew exactly what Steve was going to ask about. His husband wasn’t a prude per say,  he was never afraid to try something new, but the man could not talk about sex without stuttering through it and blushing like a school girl. Tony just had to be patient and eventually Steve would break. “Is he- Are you really?”
Tony made gasps and moans beneath him to show his enthusiasm, and each sound spurred BUCK-E on. He could feel the building of electrical pressure as he surged towards another orgasm but he wanted Tony to come too.
"It is not nothing. You're crying and you're shaking all over. What can I do? What do you need?" That right there was what had confused Steve so badly; Tony was treating him like his Omega. Everything from the soothing voice to the gentle hand rubbing his back and the protective scent he was giving off. Steve wasn't imagining all these things right in front of him.
“So, who is he really?” Natasha asked him in russian, which would have normally given them a modicum of privacy given the rarity of polyglots but Tony knew that wouldn’t stop BUCK-E, who didn’t bat even one Polybutylene Terephthalate eyelash at the language shift.
“I am doing well. Thank you for asking.” The android stood, leaving the rest of the spanners on a workbench to be dealt with later in favor of being a part of the conversation.
The lights were on when they got back from the dinner that was hosted after the press conference. It wasn’t formal or anything, but it still took hours and Tony was beyond tired from all the socializing. Whatever this was, he hoped it was quick.
When Jarvis told him that Rogers was trying to call him, BUCK-E had been more than content to ignore the call for the moment. He was disinclined to listen to a single word the man had to say. He hadn’t wanted to hear about how he was a threat to Tony, or that he was less sentient than a human, just because he wasn’t a biological organism.
Even as Steve thought that, he was locking the door to his suite in the Tower and putting himself into ‘Incognito mode’ on his phone and Jarvis’s systems -- he wasn’t such a luddite that he couldn’t figure out what that was, or what it was generally used for, no matter what Clint or Tony thought.
Trying to compromise, BUCK-E grabbed hold of one of Tony’s legs and pulled the man into his lap. The new position made it much easier to touch. Tony had so many sensitive areas that it was hard to choose where to focus, but the hitch of breath he got when he ran his hands down the man's back to squeeze his buttocks was very captivating.
“Touch yourself. I want to watch as the pleasure overwhelms you.” BUCK-E would rather have done it himself but he couldn’t spare a hand with how he was holding Tony up by his hips.
The room was starting to really stink now that he was in his right mind. Shame and sadness and old sweat mingling into a stench that drove him to take a shower.
Tony wouldn’t admit it out loud, but his heart had gone all warm and gooey. This was why he loved Steve, for these thoughtful moments with his AI where he recognised that they were still learning and tried to help them -- even when his face still looked like it might catch fire any second. Of course he could be thoughtless, as he had proved with BUCK-E last week, but there were also moments like this.
Tony was momentarily nervous about what Steve would say before he remembered Steve wasn't here. If he were, he would have been able to voice his opinion while BUCK-E was still just an idea. Well actually if Steve had been here, then BUCK-E wouldn't have been an idea at all. So, it was really all on Steve.
It had taken weeks, which was good because it distracted him from all the emotions he was trying so desperately to avoid, and now he was standing in front of what was, without a doubt, the most advanced AI he had created to date. As the forerunner in artificial intelligence, that was really saying something.
He morosely set off for the kitchen, the shirt he'd slid on felt tacky against his damp skin but it didn't really matter because he'd never felt less sexy in his life. What was a little more gross on top of that? He was apparently so unappealing that the heat scent of Omega wasn't enough to lure anyone in. In fact someone had even gone so far as to shut the door to his apartment that he'd left open, just to make sure everyone knew he was going into heat. Steve's eyes burned with unshed tears so he picked up the pace.
“New designation: Pinocc–” Tony whirled around to eyeball him and saw what he thought might be a spark of mischief in BUCK-E’s eyes.
Slowly, he let Tony sink down. Not that the man didn’t try and speed things up, but BUCK-E had a good hold and Tony didn’t have any extra leverage.
She was tempted to let the silence weigh on him, but her patience was frayed -- she was well past playing the long game and there was a chance that Steve might just go right back to sleep if she waited much longer. “Barnes. Who else? I can't find a single thing on him before he started following your husband around like a lost puppy. He's like a ghost, Steve.”
“There are extenuating circumstances that I just don't want to get into with you at 3 a.m., Natasha. Leave it alone, please.”
“Well, you definitely shouldn’t have done that. Classified, yada yada, top secret Bla bla bla. At least he’s not likely to get shot before he comes home. This time…”
If something was wrong with Steve then this scene would have looked much different but he wasn’t sure why else she would be here. There were plenty of safer safe houses than his if she were in trouble.
"I am unharmed. Rogers is 231.6 miles from here and cannot harm me. I have not left this bed all night."
He didn't know what he was going to say next, only that it was going to hurt, but before Tony could open his mouth he was cut off by gentle fingers brushing against his clenched fist.
BUCK-E focused on specifically not furrowing his brow, mindful of the 37 cameras still constantly taking photos and 12 other cameras recording the entire press briefing.
Tony hadn’t even realized he’d fallen asleep, but he was sure that it had been hours because he didn't have that annoying persistent pounding behind his eyes any more. He would have slept even longer if he hadn't been so rudely awoken by the sound of a ringing phone circa 1980. It was, without a doubt, some form of retribution on Jarvis’s part for making him call in his pizza order earlier. Tony swore Jarvis was the pettiest person he knew.
At the moment, BUCK-E was staring out into the crowd of vultures and flashing cameras, at least outwardly seemingly cool and collected -- if that was true or not Tony would have to wait to find out. There were a few shouted questions as to who the new face was but Tony ignored them all. They would be taking questions from three different pre-approved journalists who had all been instructed to keep their questions on topic -- any off topic questions would be ignored, no second chances given.
“Am I not allowed to create new designations for people?” Tony was forever creating new designations for people, BUCK-E did not realize he was not also allowed to do that as well.
Tony tensed up, not expecting BUCK-E to have found her real name. He didn’t see Natasha tense or give any kind of tell -- she was too good for that -- but he knew that she had to be on guard now.
The little sounds that Tony made as he felt the electric crackle of his own orgasm run through him like a live wire and couldn't help but thrust into the warm wet heat. The feel of little puffing breaths against his cheek as Tony came back to himself, the way they clutched at each other, and the warmth that was passed between them. BUCK-E didn't want to lose a single byte.
Mostly because of the completely inappropriate erection he sported every time Tony was so much as brought up in conversation. Not to mention the guilt eating him alive every time he watched one of the videos. He kept promising himself that this was the last time, that he wouldn't do it again -- but given a few days he was guiltily searching it up again with a hand around his cock.
Instead of following Tony’s instruction and pushing another finger in, BUCK-E took the proper time to relax the muscles with his fingers. BUCK-E ignored the frustrated whine Tony let out even as he rocked back on the fingers inside him.
BUCK-E admired the way Tony’s face contorted as he rode out the climax. The android didn’t think he would ever get tired of watching that. He saved the moment in his long-term cloud storage in the Starknetwork, which was filling up faster than anticipated but Tony had promised that a private remote server was close to being complete. Then he wouldn’t have to worry about which memories he saved in their entirety.
“I don't know what that means. Jarvis? How would you categorize Rogers' apology?” Jarvis was much better at judging these things than he was -- BUCK-E still had a lot to learn about people and their motivations.
He would have to stretch Tony out much more than he currently was though. It was a lot to try and fit into a very small opening.
“Designation Sleepyhead accepted.” A flat voice replied in a smooth tenor. Okay, so they had to work on intonation but he had been spot on with the voice synthetization, no hint of tin or crackle anywhere to be found.
“I've heard of it, but I find it doesn't actually help to dance around an issue until everyone's uncomfortable. Why are you so chill about this? Not to be rude Steve, but you don't seem like the open relationship type.” Natasha had in fact seen -- on multiple occasions -- how incredibly possessive Steve could be of his husband. Many a bar fight had been started over Tony Stark's supposed ‘honor’, a not insignificant number of which she had helped him finish -- which led her right back to that getting in over his head thing that Steve was so great at.
“What? Tony you can't name your AI that. It sounds like he’s a male stripper. It is the masculine equivalent of Candy.”
It would have been perfect if not for the obnoxious ringing that was still going on, “All right J, who is it?”
When BUCK-E looked to Tony for reassurance he nodded his approval. Natasha did good work. The fact that Steve had set this up settled that little nagging worry in Tony’s head that Steve might not actually want to try and make nice with BUCK-E like he said he would.
Tony made a grunting sort of sound and tried to fight the unyielding grip. “You’re killing me. BUCK-E please, I can’t take any more teasing.”
It was satisfying to watch Tony clutch at the sheets and swear up a storm as he tried to come to grips with the sudden change in position and stimulation. BUCK-E would watch Tony like this for hours if he could. If Tony would allow it, he would be content for neither of them to ever leave this room again. They would stay here happy and blissfully naked together. It was enough though, to have this moment and know that there would be more moments like it.
Kneeling on the bed, Steve settled into a good position so he could still watch. In one hand he held the bright red -- Ironman red -- vibrator attached to a long cord with a remote at the other end, the bullet was only the length of his thumb and about as wide so he wouldn’t need to worry about stretching himself. In the other hand he held the new bottle of lube he had bought at the same time.
“Okay.” They were quiet for a moment, besides the sounds of Tony’s quiet sniffling as he tried desperately to get a hold of himself, “How long is a little longer? I will need to charge in one hour and twenty five minutes.”
Stilted conversations with loved ones were a Stark family tradition, but Tony hated the silence, it ate at him -- that was probably one of the reasons he rambled as much as he did, always trying to fill the silence with his own words, lest there be even a breath of air left for awkwardness to fill.
It was true that Steve had been warned about the dangers of the internet, and how there were things that he might not want to see. Somehow, everyone neglected to mention the things that he might want to see too much.
“Coward!” Rhodey calls after him, still holding Tony’s favorite mug even though he’s been complaining constantly about how much sugar Tony uses, like they haven’t known each other for a couple decades, like Tony’s coffee hasn’t always been like that.
“Hey, don’t you guys look a little familiar?” Tony asks, because—huh. They do, in a weird way. Not their metal faces, of course, but the style of their robes, the way the joints move…
It goes like this: Tony gets to Malibu, turns FRIDAY on, and starts working on Barnes’ new arm. He videoconferences with T’Challa about fMRI scans and neurological pathways and temporal lobes, and then with Helen Cho about all the same things, just to be safe. It makes him miss Bruce terribly.
And it’s not exactly a magical solution—or any solution at all, really—but Tony feels a little better anyway. Sure, he still hasn’t slept, and Steve doesn’t have any apparent way to fix that, but someone at least knows now, and it doesn’t seem like anyone’s going to lose their shit over it, and Steve at least doesn’t think it’s anything major or dangerous yet. Tony grins back.
“I—feel good,” Tony says, meeting her eyes again and wondering why that sentence makes him feel so guilty. “Extremis is nothing short of lovely.”
“It’s not so much density,” Bruce says thoughtfully. “Actually, based on some of the research, the space between my—the Hulks atoms gets bigger too when I’m—him. They’re just held together with gamma-addled bonds.”
“I’m sorry about that, by the way,” Sam says sincerely, meeting Scott’s eyes head-on. “It was beyond stupid, and I shouldn’t’ve done it. Which is why I’m not complaining about the therapy thing.”
Tony thinks, so suddenly and fiercely he wouldn’t be surprised if Steve responded out loud. He doesn’t, of course. Tony has to breathe deeply through his nose as he rounds the next corner.
It’s oddly reminiscent of them working on the Accords, but…better. More familiar. They’re coordinating through text instead of email, and without the entire team of lawyers working as a buffer zone between their short fuses. Tony thinks of how far they’ve come, the growth they’re exhibiting just by being able to do this and he swivels on his stool so Bruce doesn’t catch him smiling to himself like an idiot.
“An eagle,” Steve says, still laughing at Tony, but he points again, showing which side is supposed to have the head and where the eagle’s tail is.
“You sponsor us,” Steve continues, “and deal with legalities and design things to keep us safe. And I—give the odd speech, and designate roles in a battle. The only way I know to keep you safe is by doing that. If you’re just gonna—go in hot anyway, no backup, unknown enemies—” Steve shrugs, and this time it’s clear his shoulders are slumping under some weight. “I’ve got nothing. I don’t know what to do.”
“I'll be okay,” he said softly, voice pitched for only their ears. He projected his most sincere look in each of their directions as they examined his face for any trace of a lie, then those hands fell away and they trailed off to make niceties with the others gathered nearby. Tony turned his gaze to Steve once more, this time level and determined.
“Mmm,” he answered, burying his face further against the flesh before him, smiling at the way his love laughed at that.
thinking about that right now, he couldn't think about it – he would be okay. Regardless of the rest of humanity, he had these two people he could count on, always and forever.
– and betrayal, and he saw himself losing the last thing he had in this world. He fought, nourished by his inner turmoil, but he was so blinded by it that strategy fell by the wayside and he just lashed out.
,” he tucked his chin against his shoulder and watched Tony slowly following along the intended path. It was a circuit, the tech genius drifting out to what he needed and then back to his projections, ever expanding his loop as he found need of a new piece for his incomprehensible puzzle. The captain had been very precise in the arrangement of the items he'd swiped, fully aware of the order in which they would be used – after all, how many times had he seen it in practice? – setting the last and most important at the far end of the desk; the screwdriver, the one tool Tony was never seen without, the thing that signified the end of hypotheticals and the beginning of creation, probably his most prized possession (not that he'd admit it). When his paramour reached for that final piece, Steve sprang.
Turns out, he'd fallen into old habits and once again forgotten to see how his actions might affect those around him.
with everything that had been happening, and I-” Steve shook his head and sighed. “There's a lot of moments when I could've done the right thing and I didn't. Oh, God, when I hurt you, I thought-!”
His eyes trailed down to those arms, the ones that would wrap him so tightly against that sculpted body and drain away his fears and worries; those hands that could rend apart the strongest materials, gentled as they glided over his skin, cupped his face, held his hand; those legs that were always steady, strong enough to carry him when he'd been wounded or drunk or just needed some sleep and was too exhausted to walk on his own. He wondered if he'd ever know that comfort again.
“Tony,” Steve reprimanded, drawing his name out slightly, but the tech genius could hear the grin in his voice and knew it was all a front, contenting himself with chasing after the doze that was tickling at the back of his mind. “Tony, it's time to get up. We should probably let everyone know we worked things out.”
His friends, the few he still had, worried and fussed over him, offering condolences and empty promises that things would get better. They did their best to be sure he was fed, showered, and rested; he wasn't overly cooperative, so they failed more often than not. Today, they must've reached their breaking point, unleashing their secret weapon, and he'd been dragged from his cave, locked out of it, and told with deadly green gaze and in no uncertain terms that he was to go get some fresh air. He knew better than to challenge the command, knew he was expected to stay away for at least a couple hours, so he'd turned and just started walking, letting his feet guide him where they would.
“There's clean clothes in the closet, underwear in the bureau,” Tony offered idly, loathing the idea of his paramour pulling those dirty rags back on. He took a moment to enjoy the view as Steve headed across the room, eyes drinking in every inch of skin.
Thus, they all entered the sprawling space via the hangar, unsure of any timeframe in which to expect their long-removed companions, tension radiating at the prospect of the uncertainties ahead.
“What about Bucky?” he asked softly, hating to ruin the upward tic they'd found. The way Steve's face became worried and pinched made him think he wasn't going to like the answer.
Then, Steve said, “Is there someplace we can talk privately?” He must've seen the challenge in the billionaire's eyes because he added, “I don't want to be interrupted,” and gestured to the hangar.
He glared daggers at Steve as the man bowed his head, hysterical giggles wracking through him, and he flopped over onto his back when Tony hit his shoulder in half-hearted anger. The billionaire sat up and pinned him with the most deadly look he could muster, which only succeeded in earning him an upgrade to full-on guffawing, leaving him gawking in disbelief. He was just taking a breath to start berating him when Steve snagged him and pulled him down for a kiss, chuckling a little against his lips, then maneuvered him into an embrace similar to how they'd been curled up before.
The billionaire lifted his head from its resting place to meet the blonde's eyes, heart hammering in his chest, and he melted at the way his paramour was gazing at him. He leaned in to kiss him for the millionth time, making a mental note to do so at every possible chance for the foreseeable future, fully intending to make up for the two-years-worth of missed opportunities. They fell asleep like that, curled in each other's arms, kisses tapering off into nuzzles and then into dreams.
Steve chuckled at that, all smooth and honeyed, and it soothed the ragged edges of Tony's upset, even as it tore him apart much deeper inside. This wasn't right. They should be talking about sandy beaches and the benefits of having no suntan lines, arguing that work could be put off
Then, the bastard was pulling away, getting up, and he whined his disapproval, wrapping himself around the blonde like an octopus. There was something to be said for super soldier strength, though, because his added weight barely slowed Steve down, and he found himself clinging tighter for the sole purpose of not falling and hurting himself. He pouted as the man looked down at him, all too pleased with himself for making it to his feet despite Tony's best attempt, offering no assistance to keep the tech genius from busting his ass. With a resigned huff, Tony slowly disengaged and stood there, glaring up at him petulantly. Steve just grinned and gave him another kiss, then started searching for his scattered garments.
"I was waiting on you. I was waiting for our Pack Alpha to ask me," and he got so disappointed every time he got his hopes up, thinking Tony looked like he was finally going to ask but he never did.
“Of course I wouldn't, I'm already on enough watch lists without getting you into trouble too. Why wouldn’t you just tell me?”
"Okay, we’re going to circle back to your clandestine phone call in a minute. He apologized? Was it a good one or was it one of his half-assed ‘I'm sorry it has to be like this’ apologies?”
Tony still had pushback, even now, from his board and his CFO -- no matter that SI was doing better than ever. Between the personal devices that blew Apple out of the water and then blasted it to shitty little planned-obsolescent pieces and the green energy that would change the way the world thought of power usage, the company was at the forefront of two different industries. Apparently they weren't 'where the money is', even though Stark Industries made enough to pay every single employee a living wage with full benefits and a bonus every year. There was just no pleasing the older board members though -- Obadiah led the pack of malcontents, no matter how often Tony tried to explain to his godfather that green energy was the way of the future.
