He coughed again and cleared his throat before he finally started to talk. “You’re… you’re American.” It sounded more like a statement than a question, which was what he had intended it to be, but the Adonis seemed more surprised by the fact that Tony did in fact speak English and what he said than how he said it, so it didn’t bother him too much.
be ten years from now?”
Okay, I am going to be honest with you guys, this was very hard to write because it was basically the same as last chapter, only a slower and basically went through the same scenario over and over again, but I think I finally got it well enough.
Hammer also shoved his way up to Ty’s side, trying for a similar smirk like Ty’s and Killian’s, but didn’t quite make it, which ironically helped calm Tony’s nerves. But before he could speak, Ty cut him off, leaning in closer and pressing Tony up against a locker.”
Clint sighed and took Lucky out of the bag again, hugging him to his chest and stroking the fur. “And here I thought we’d have some freedom and get some time to whatever we wanted for the summer, but instead we get sent to the most dorky, stupid looking camp ever.” He rolled his eyes and smiled mockingly at her. “Lucky us.”
“I’m gonna go explore a bit closer at this ship. If it turns out we
“Man Rogers, you can’t keep giving me this much sap, you’ll give me cavities.” Not his best line, but it was the best he could deliver considering the circumstances.
“Oh yeah, I’m fine- I-I mean I was fine. A-and I never got to thank you for helping me with those jerks. They’re always on my back for something or other, so thanks for, you know, helping me out.” Tony smiled and bumped him with his shoulder.
And sure, he probably didn’t help any of this with his own attitude and acting like an asshole and like he had ego bigger than the sun and like he thought the universe revolved around him, plus rub his genius in people’s faces, but what was he supposed to do? There was no way he could change what people thought of him anyway and he couldn’t make those rumors go away, so if everyone was going to see him as an asshole and a slut, he might as well act the part. Because who cares? High school is nothing, he’d be gone in a few years, go to MIT and never look back at Shield high ever again, move on to become a great engineer and just put everything behind him.
“I know my degree doesn’t count for much. There’s limited jobs for people with an Art’s Degree and I don’t have much as it is. I have absolutely nothing to offer you that is up to the standards that you are used to, but if you let me, I’ll do everything I can make sure to treat you to everything I can, especially after everything I’ve put you through with my tours and work in the army. Not to mention how your asshole father has treated you throughout your life. You deserve to be treated like a king and I’ll dedicate my life to make sure you get everything you deserve.”
“Shit, I have to go. I’m already late to meet up with a friend.” She dug into her bag and placed a few bills on the counter and drank the remaining latte in the mug before grabbing he croissant. She smiled at him and winked. “See you around, Rogers.” Then she turned around and left the room shop.
“Okay, let’s switch it up a little. I’ll call and order some Chinese food and you pick out the worst, most laughable movie you can find on Netflix. I’m in the mood for a bad movie night and to laugh at terrible effects and bad acting.” And Tony immediately lit up and lunged for the remote.
Natasha looked up from her nails; eyebrow raised in slight curiosity and put down her nail polish. “Well, this oughta be good.” Thor and Hulk also looked away from the TV and Clint stopped mid-throw with the dart still in his hand.
"Hi babe. Good to see you home again." Steve smiled and nuzzled his face against Tony's. He drew in Tony's scent through his nose and suddenly felt at peace again. He was home, Tony was here holding him and all was well in the world.
Finally.
“Surprise me. You know what I like, doll.” Tony mock-grimaced and batted at his hand with one arm while covering his hair with the other arm.
Bucky came in around lunch, just like he always did. He claimed he liked to have some coffee while he studied but he usually ended up talking more with Steve or Sam, the other part-time worker at this shop, whom he’d really hit it off with, than doing any actual school work. This day he had his laptop under his arm and his book bag slung over his shoulder, practically dead on his feet as he sat down by the counter and rested his head on his arms.
“What ever happened to ‘is this some kind of elaborate prank?’” Clint shrugged with a wide grin and gestured wildly with his hands.
“I don’t know, but I’ve never seen anything like this before, it’s probably some kind of secret lab or something. I still say we’ve been kidnapped, the guys might come here and cut off a finger or ear to send to our parents.” Steve rolled his eyes and looked at him, mostly annoyed but Natasha could see if he wasn’t quite as convinced as he probably wanted to be.
Steve smiled widely up at him. “Tony Stark, you are the love of my life, my best friend and I want to be your partner in everything. So I ask you, will you marry me?”
Jarvis chuckled and sat down on the bed beside him, patting his shoulder. "I'm sure it won't be that bad, Tony. It might not seem very fun right now, but I believe that you will find this summer very rewarding. It is often by doing things outside of our comfort zone and try new things that we learn the most about ourselves. And who knows, maybe you'll make some friends over the summer?"
Bucky rolled his eyes harder and opened his laptop and grabbed one of his books from his bag. “Oh yeah, how could I forget?
“In your dreams, Barton! You gotta work hard to look as good as me.” That was only slightly a joke, since Tony knew that he wasn’t a knockout, with his pimples that always refused to go away entirely and the fact that his muscles still refused to appear. But he had very nice, thick hair and while it often refused to look like anything other than the worst of untamable bedheads, big eyes- and yes he had big bulky glasses over them, but still- and nothing on his face looked bad or ugly. But Clint did have better hair with a nice shade of sandy blonde and with an actual hairstyle and puberty had clearly started to take effect on him. He had started to fill out with muscles, he was an inch or so taller than Tony and rarely had pimples.
“You okay?” Bruce looked up and saw Natasha stand beside him, hand on her hip and head slightly tilted, her mouth very slightly quirked. He smiled weakly and sat up a bit straighter.
Steve’s eyes were overfilled with tears at this point and Tony pressed a kiss on his nose, leaning in close to his ear. “Now, let’s go home. We’ll pick up pizza on the way home.” He slowly started to pull away, but Steve grabbed his hand before he got too far away.
Still, it didn’t stop him from trying. That was just how Tony was. Never stop, never quit and never give up, no matter what the odds.
“If it is, it’s the most convincing green screen or CGI effects I have ever seen. Pictures from satellites don’t look this convincing.” Thor leaned against one of the chairs’ backrests and stared out the window.
Bruce sighed and leaned his head back against the metal and ran a hand through his curly brown hair. As if it wasn’t hard enough to breathe in this enclosed space with so small windows and everything, the pressure of coming to a decision under such a short amount of time didn’t make it any easier to breathe.
Her lip quirked slightly and she pulled up her legs on the bed so she could sit cross-legged. "Because Phil wants us to become more social and hang out with more people than just each other. We've been over this already."
“H-How did you know which button to push?” Clint shrugged and shook his head, his expression still looking very high on the adrenaline from the encounter.
Steve frowned, put his hands on his hips and tilted his head slightly to the side. “But that could take
“Hopefully it will help improve your behavior for the next Fall.” His father had said before sending him up to his room to pack. His mother had tried to talk to him and calm him down a little, which had only worked a little. She had tried to tell him that it might be good for him to make some friends and get away from his father for a while.
Then he got an idea and a smile spread over his face. “Well if you wanna get warm, we could always go and get a coffee.” That got Tony’s attention and he perked up a little. “We’re not too far away from the closest coffeehouse. We could go and stay there until it stops raining. At least we would be warm there.”
“Thank God, it finally happened!” Sam groaned from his seat, and Steve probably would have felt bad for kinda forgetting he was still there, but he was way too wrapped up in ‘Toni Stark wants to go on a date with me!’ to real care in the moment. “I can’t believe she practically had to make you ask her out, you’re such a wussy Rogers.”
“Why? There’s not
“You couldn’t afford me, Toni. Even with your dad’s billions of dollars.” She then grabbed the dress, still hanging on the hanger, and handed it over to her. “Now get dressed, you’ll need to get going soon.”
"Um, not that this isn't a very valid conversation to have at the moment, but could we
Clint groaned and threw down the last t-shirt and a pair of jeans into his bag and zipped it before moving on the next one, dumping a stack of comic books, his headphones and his beloved teddy Golden Retriever Lucky into it. Natasha had never once seen him sleep without Lucky since they were both adopted by Phil and he was not ashamed to admit that he loved that dog and needed it for comfort at nights. Not that Natasha was one to judge, since she still had nightmares about her past some nights and would find comfort in sleeping with her old ballerina shoes or with her jackknife close by.
“No, it’s no good. It looks like whoever brought us here didn’t want us to go exploring in any other rooms.”
“Well fine then,
He’d heard it all, ever since fifth grade the rumors had been running wild and they had gotten more and more hurtful and terrible with every year.
“Tony!”
Tony, while still working as a car mechanic, started to plan out starting a company of his own along with a few friends, since his father had more or less disowned him for dating Steve and rejecting Stark Industries and its legacy. It wasn’t much at the moment, just an idea, but Tony really had his goals set on working with technology and especially with green energy.
She was pushed down on a chair and Janet immediately got to work. Though she didn’t do much aside from putting some rouge on her cheeks, highlighted her eyebrows and put some red lipstick on her lips and mascara on her eyelashes she still took her sweet time to get it done. She also grabbed a brush and started to brush through her hair and curling it lightly.
“Well, if you’re so hurt I guess I’ll just have to eat all alone then.” But before he could pull out his own chair, Steve was there and pulled it out for him, making Tony stop and look at him with raised eyebrow. “Really?”
When Natasha opened her eyes again she didn't see the forest anymore. Or the road they had been standing on before. In fact, nothing she saw was close to where they been before. She carefully got her fingers out of her ears and started to move around to see how it looked.
Tony tried to grin while fighting against every urge to scream or cry to throw a tantrum over this. "Okay, fine. Sounds like it'll be a blast." Not.
going to do that, no way in hell! I love him and I am not going to dump the love of my life just because you disapprove,
He’d done it. He’d asked Toni Stark out on a date, and she’d said
Tony smiled teasingly and bumped his shoulder against Steve’s arm. “Well, I guess that’s a good start.”
“What are you doing?” He looked over his shoulder at her for one second before looking back at the computer screen, frantically tapping at the keyboard.
And despite everything, there was a very tiny, insecure part of Steve that felt relieved at Tony’s words because it was still confounded him why he had settled for someone like him. Despite how many times Tony had told him that he loved him and he was happy to be his and didn’t care how much money they had or how small their apartment was. He was happy and didn’t need anything else but Steve and the rest was irrelevant.
“You are not a nice person.” Steve chuckled and sat down beside him on the bed. He pressed a kiss to his temple and put an arm around his shoulders, pulling him close despite how Tony tried to pull away. Not very successfully, seeing how Steve was a super solider and was much stronger than an average man.
Tony raised his eyebrow, amused and smirked. “My favorite dish for dinner, homemade and everything, dessert, cuddles and kisses and now more? Why Mr. Rogers, if I didn’t know better I’d say you were trying to seduce me.”
“Aw, come on Foster, can’t you just come out with me tonight? It’s summer, we could celebrate that school’s finally out, together.” Jane rolled her eyes at before smacking his arm when he tried to put it around her, glaring daggers at him. Thor would not like to be on the receiving end of that particular look.
He was greeted with a candlelight room and the smell of carbonara filled his nostrils, Tony’s favorite dish. The table was set, candles were light, a bottle of wine along with wine glasses were placed on the table, along with a big bowl of salad and some garlic bread. Fresh out of the oven too, if the smell was any indication.
Steve continued with a soft smile, but he also looked… well, kinda emotional. He let go of Tony’s face and took his hands, holding them tightly. “Tony, you know I mean it, right? I adore you, Tony. I love everything about you and don’t ever want us to be apart for this long ever again.”
“So tell me, Blondie, do you spend your vacations saving people from drowning or am I just lucky?” Steve smirked back and put his hands in his sides.
Tony shook his head with a small laugh before letting himself relax and rest against Steve’s body, pressing his lips to his neck. He suddenly felt drained of all energy after all the emotion that he’d gone through just now and was now more than okay with Steve carrying him out of the airport and to the car so they could go home.
“Hey, put me down Rogers! Put me down right now!” Steve smirked.
“Well, yeah, maybe a little. I can’t deny that maybe this could be dangerous or whatever, but still it’s a fucking space adventure! Who in their right mind would say no to that?” Tony nodded and placed his hands on his hips.
So she changed into a clean shirt and a hoodie, grabbed her bag with her wallet and headed towards the Starbucks, the fresh autumn air cool against her face and making her wake up a little. It was still September and relatively warm but it was slowly becoming autumn and the air was becoming cooler, the leaves were going from green to yellow and orange and it was raining more and more now.
rang and declared the class, and whole day, was
Speaking of Bruce, he had gotten back up from the machine’s side and was now looking over at the other machine in the room. “What do you think this is?” Thor got up from where he was sitting and they made their way over to the machine, Tony and Bruce running their fingers over the dome.
I hope you’ll like it!
Tony caught their looks and tried to look pleadingly at them, though the effect was slightly ruined by him hanging upside down. “Help? Please?” Natasha just smirked at him and shook her head, her red curls bouncing against her cheeks. Clint laughed at him.
Steve just ignored him and went back to his drawing when he heard the bell above the door chime as the door opened so he straightened up to greet the customer and-
“Nope. Nope, no, I know what you’re doing, Rogers. It’s not gonna work this time.” He tilted his head up, with his nose in the air. Steve just smiled innocently; pulling the socks off his feet before moving up to unbutton Tony’s pants and pull them down his legs.
Janet made a happy sound and when Toni looked back she saw her standing with a nice, red sleeveless dress that reached to the knees. It was simple yet nice and elegant enough to wear for a nice night out but not too outrageous or revealing or eye-catching as a lot of her other party clothes.
“How many times have
And of course it was Brock Rumlow, because who else would it be? That guy was out to get him, Clint swore up and down that he was. And now he was laughing along with a few buddies, as Clint was still half-lying on the floor.
"What?! But mom, you know I don't like outside stuff! I wouldn't have any fun being there, you have realize that!" Dad rolled his eyes with a loud and disapproving scoff, turning away from them and folding his arms over his chest. Mom sat down beside him and gently stroke his hair out of his face.
Aldrich shoved his way up to Ty’s side and sneered down at Tony, almost as predatory as Ty did. “Hey, Stone, if you’re gonna have some fun with him, you have to share!” He leaned down to be on eye level with Tony. “You’d like that wouldn’t you, you little whore? You’d just love to have a strong man’s hands all over you, wouldn’t you?”
“Oh yeah, haha, very funny Rumlow! You’re such a fucking riot I might piss myself laughing so hard!” Rumlow just laughed some more before walking up to Clint, smirking and folded his arms over his chest.
“Oh fuck off, Steve! I have work to do, let me go!” Steve hummed and pursed his lips, pretending to think about it before smirking mischievously.
Tony, to his credit, tried to resist and move his face away from Steve’s mouth or push at his shoulders to get some space between them. But it didn’t take too long for him to give in and start to kiss him back and eventually raise his hands to grab Steve’s shirt to pull it off, which was Steve was than happy to let him do. But when Tony’s hands found their way to his belt buckle, Steve covered his hands with his own.
“Steve, this is ridiculous! I have to work on the armor, I don’t have time your-“ Steve shook his head and threw his boyfriend further up over his shoulder, prompting a yelp out of him.
Bucky cleared his throat and Steve thought he could hear him blow his nose. "My mom already called and asked the camp directors. They said if you don't show up on the first day of the whole thing, you couldn't come at all. I don't know, some stupid policy or something. So she could only ask for a refund and that was that. Sorry pal, you'll have to go alone."
Aldrich came up to him and- while he wasn’t as popular or as bad as Ty- he was way more suave and manipulative than Hammer. He was a bit cooler than Ty, not quick to anger and could almost make Tony play into a lot of schemes. Thankfully Tony knew better now and refused to listen to anything he said, but he was still a very smooth talker.
you and
Tony was close to tears and caught between a rock and a hard place. He needed to get away, soon, or who knows what he would do. Normally he would yell back and tell Ty exactly where to shove it, but he’d been caught off guard and now didn’t know how he would get away from this, since he was cornered by three guys, two of which were taller and bigger than him, so-
It always surprised a lot of people that he had a very fiery temper and could loose it when he was pushed to far, and he’d been working hard at controlling said temper so he wouldn’t completely loose it someone. Not that he could actually take any of these guys in a fight, but he was stronger than he looked, despite being a bit short and not particularly muscle-y.
can actually pay
They both laughed at their corny flirting and bizarre the whole thing had been, then the guy reached a hand for Tony to shake with a more comfortable smile.
He swallowed thickly and let his finger hover over the green button, then the red one and then back to green.
Again, this was something that really concerned Steve. Sure, he knew that Tony had nothing but the best intentions when he stayed in his workshop three days without breaks. He might deflect and act like it was all because he didn’t want anyone’s blood on his hands, but Steve knew better. The whole team knew better. Tony still, either out of habit or stubborn pride, worked really hard to cover up his feelings and hide the fact that he cared very much for his friends and wanted them to stay alive. And if he could make sure it happened by making them better armor, weaponry and whatever else they might need in battle, he would do it. Nevermind that he worked himself into the ground while doing it, ‘cause his own health wasn’t as important as his friends, despite said friends trying to tell him otherwise.
“Make sure he gets at least eight hours, Cap. He promised to spar with me tomorrow.” Tony froze in Steve's grip and gulped audibly, either having forgotten about that promise and was now reminded or was just nervous about sparring match on its own. Which was fair when you were going up against the Black Widow.
He raised an eyebrow at Tony, probably looking really suspicious. But Tony just smiled and shrugged. “It’s a surprise! I don’t want you to ruin it. Just humor me, will you?”
Steve shook his head slowly. While she was very, very good friends with Bruce, it had been very clear that they were just friends.And while she flirted with him from time to time, it was very clear she was playing and joking with him more often than not and he had his interest elsewhere. She and Reed had been going at each other for months and she kept calling him 'a stuck up son-of a-bitch with his head shoved way too far up his own ass' and he called her 'a spoiled, pampered Daddy's girl with enough ego for it to be visible from Space', so they clearly didn't like each other.
and I’m a year younger than you!” He then held back a shriek when Steve wrapped an arm around his neck and rubbed his knuckles against his head.
“Eating alone today, are we Rogers?”
She rested her head on Toni’s shoulder and Toni smiled softly, leaning her head against Janet’s and they sat like that for a while. “Thanks Jan. It really means a lot that you’re saying this.” Janet reached out, took her hand squeezed it.
Steve smirked and shrugged lightly. “I’m here, aren’t I? I’d say it worked out just great for me. Especially since I have you now.” He placed his arm around Tony’s shoulders and hugged him close, letting Tony rest his head in the crook of his neck.
century than him, they could sit and talk about books, movies, pop culture, history, politics and other subjects that helped Steve learn more about this new world.
As the bell signaling the end of class chimed, Thor collected his math books before hurrying out of the classroom so he might have a chance to speak with his lovely Jane before next class. They did not share many classes and he very much wanted to speak with her as much as he could.
Still, he smiled gratefully at her and took the bottle from her, taking a few deep sips of cool and clear water. And it did help a lot to clear his head a little and also cool him down a little. He handed it back to her with a soft smile. “Thank you, Natasha.” Her frown turned into a very small smile and she patted his shoulder before he went over to Clint and started to talk to him.
It’s not really easy to care much for your birthday when it’s on the Fourth of July. Especially after becoming Captain America and people had learned that his birthday was, in fact, on Independence Day and it became almost as big a spectacle as the celebration of the country.
Tony smiled teasingly at him with a raised eyebrow. “Oh yeah? Like what?”
“Yeah, you probably like that, cuz you know no one will ever love you. Just like your parents didn’t love you or your brother. Your dad probably loved you about as much loved the smell his own shit and would’ve loved to kill you too if you didn’t run away.”
Steve’s eyebrows drew together, suddenly feeling that old, familiar urge to punch something- or in this case
over and over again. Bruce looked from the screens, to the levers and buttons and then out the window at the big asteroid. He sat down in one of the chairs in front of one of the screens and started tapping. The others came running up and Natasha clutched the back of Bruce’s seat tightly.
And a light blinked to the right of the control panel and on a small podium of sorts a small screen had appeared and a strange display of colors and different shapes was floating across the screen.
And, both the worst and most exciting thing, he was now flirting with her almost as much as she flirted with him. She tried to show it didn't mean much that she was flirting, since she playfully flirted with pretty much everyone on campus, even some girls and boys that she really didn't like, but she couldn’t quite shake the feeling that his flirting with her was genuine. That he was interested in her.
“Yes, we fucking get it!” Natasha snarled at the computer before turning back to Bruce and his typing. Steve had placed his hand on Tony’s shoulder and was shaking him wildly.
After taking a quick shower and changing her back into her regular clothes, she got out of the locker room and started towards her next class. And along the way, it was always the same. Guys stared at her like she was either a goddess or a monster of some sort and girls ran away from her or glared at her, spelling out their hatred or fear for her very clearly.
Everyone whipped around the look at the big window beside them and a big, fiery red asteroid was heading towards them at an alarming rate. Tony and Bruce ran towards the controls and looked over the controls.
Tony Stark, who Steve loved with all his heart.
Clint smirked and leaned over the gap between them to hear Tony better. “Oh yeah, I sure didn’t beg my dad to go this this lame camp.” He stretched out his hand for Tony to take. “Clint Barton by the way. We go to the same school.” Tony smiled and took his hand, shaking it.
Toni took the dress, pulled it on and let Janet help her with the zipper in the back before pulling on her heels and putting on the necklace and earrings before also looking into her jewelry box and grabbed a big silver ring that she slid on her finger. If Steve did get handsy or try to do things without her consent, she’d like to at least be able to split his lip as well as stab him with her heels. Just in case.
"Toni! Um… How long have you been standing there?" He looked very nervous and a bit distressed. Toni rested her elbows on the counter and rested most of her weight on it, looking Steve straight in the eyes.
It was a lie. His parents did have a trip planed for the summer, that much he knew, but it wasn’t to Paris and they hadn’t forced him to come along. In fact, they hadn’t even told him to his face and he had heard it when they were talking to each other in his dad’s office without knowing he was outside listening to them.
She took a deep breath, walked up to the counter and said, loud and clear. "Maybe you should ask her about that?"
Sam looked over his shoulder and saw her, paled a little and turned back to Steve with apprehensive eyes. "Steve…"
“Yes. Yes I am. Do you have a problem with that, Rogers?” Steve sighed and shook his head, partly amused and partly annoyed. While he loved Tony very much and would do just about everything for him, he did
“Welcome home, sweetheart.” Tony felt himself melt in Steve’s arms and the stress that was still there in his body immediately fade away, and all that was left was his undying love for his boyfriend.
"I know it might not seem like your cup of tea, honey. But you spend so much time working in your workshop whenever you're not in school and it's just not healthy. You need to get outside, get some sun and fresh air and I really think a camp away from the city and away from everything going on here could do you some good."
Toni is both intrigued by Steve being different from every other guy she's met and flirted with and terrified at the same time, and after having landed a date with she promptly freaks out and needs Janet to rein her in.
“Making it home to you.” He placed a kiss on Tony’s forehead. “I meant what I said before, you know. I’m here to stay, Tony, for as long as you’ll have me. You have to know that I adore you and I want to spend forever with you. I’m done leaving you behind for these missions, I promise. From today, I’m done. It’ll be just you and me from now on, if you’ll have me.”
But he knew who Stark was and though he had never actually talked to him, he had a very strong dislike for the guy. He was loud and obnoxious and inappropriate and a total asshole to everyone, making jokes out of everything and got in everyone’s faces about being a genius and seemed to think the world revolved around him.
It was the most beautiful ring Tony had ever seen.
Also, it didn’t help that the girls kept throwing Russian stereotypes at her, despite not having lived in Russia since she was five years old.
Speaking of Clint, he was sitting behind her, his sandy blonde hair a tousled mess and dressed in a purple t-shirt and loose, dark blue jeans. And beside him was a big and buff guy, shoulder long blonde hair and dressed in a t-shirt, red hoodie. In the backseat was another big and blonde guy, dressed in a flannel shirt, brown leather jacket and khaki pants, looking really uncomfortable and had his arms folded over his chest. And next to him was Tony Stark, who Bruce definitely recognized. He was dressed in tight jeans, a red, yellow and black jacket and a black tank top. He had also styled his hair like he always did and had a pair of sunglasses over his face.
“I do. But
Tony had always been told he needed to work on his patience, but considering he'd had been waiting for 10 months for this day to come, dragging it out like this felt really unnecessary, not to mention unbearable. And maybe it was the caffeine or his own inability to stay still for more than a few seconds at a time or a combination of the two, but he was practically vibrating in place and had to fight against himself so he wouldn’t start jumping around or run back and forth between here and the gate or something else that would make him like stupid.
“Not too many other scientists will get a chance to see these parts of the galaxy that we will get to see!”
“Yeah, well he’s still an asshole. I mean, what the hell have I ever done to him? I never even talked to him before today for fucks sake, so why does he glare at me like I killed his puppy?” Thor nodded and folded his arms over his broad chest.
my language, I am
Steve usually doesn’t respond with anything after that; only tightens his grip on Tony and lets himself cry into his boyfriend’s shoulder. But he always thinks the same time.
Steve laughed softly and squeezed Tony’s wrists, blinking away the remaining tears from his eyes. “No, no, they do. I guess I’ve just been busy thinking about other stuff to bother with things like shaving.”
"I'm counting on it, Rogers. Otherwise I'll hunt you down and drag you out with me." And then, before she could stop herself or overthink it, she pressed a kiss to his cheek before she pulled away, grabbed her bag and got up from her seat.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to- I never wanted to-“ Steve shushed him again and pressed a kiss to Tony’s temple.
Natasha rolled her eyes at them and placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder to pull him back from actually hurting Tony, while keeping her eyes locked on her brother and Thor. “We’re just saying that there’s a bigger decision here than just how we’re going to spend our summer here. I mean out of everyone here, who even has a driving license?” Tony raised his hand, along with Thor and Steve sort of raised his hand.
“Well then, let me talk a little clearer, maybe they’ll pick this up: you are a fucking freak that even the circus didn’t want, so what makes you think we want you here? You and your freaky sister were put in the system as orphan kids, and why do think that is? Because your parents didn’t love you, they probably didn’t even like you! So why don’t you crawl back to the circus or whatever, find some place that actually want you there, if you actually find something.” Clint’s fingers itched and he wanted so badly to punch him in the face, and he almost did, when another voice cut through the crowd.
“There’s no signal here, guys. I can’t call for another taxi or a tow truck.” Tony looked up from where he was working with the engine and smirked at her.
Natasha glared a little at his tone and how he talked about Tony, but chose not to comment and just nodded and dug her nails into her arms, almost cutting through her shirt and she bit her lip. “Yeah, I can’t help but wonder about that too. Like, it could be war or it could be a trick or it could be literally anything. And while I’m not exactly jumping at the thought of what might be on that camp and the things and people there, it’d probably be light-years safer than here.” Steve nodded and looked down at the floor.
“Ooh, you drew anything good, Rogers?” Steve flew up from his seat and went to take it back, when Rumlow quickly passed it to Schmidt, who also started to look through it, his smirk widening as he flicked from page to page.
Our Heroes all find out they're going to summer camp for the whole summer and surprised to find that they're all going with a bunch of people from their class that they've barely talked to before. And suddenly, their taxi breaks down miles away from the city and they're left all alone with no means to get help or go back home.
“Oh, so here’s the kindergarten, huh?” Everybody turned to look as Natasha came walking through the corridor, the crowd parting for her like Moses parted the Red Sea. She had her eyes locked on Rumlow and marched up to him, getting right up in his face. “Well, aren’t you going to pick on me now?”
Steve’s face softened and he smiled back, rubbing the back of his neck bashfully. “Uh thanks.” He reached out his hand to her to shake. “Steve Rogers, by the way.”
tell us what the
“Hey. I’m Bucky, and this lug’s best friend.” Bucky? What kind of a name was that? But Tony didn’t really want to ask and just nodded with a weak smile. Bucky was standing on his knees but was now standing up. “You okay now?”
“My phone died at work and I left my charger here so I couldn’t recharge it. But I’ve learned my lesson, next time I go grocery shopping alone I’ll either bring my phone fully charged to we’ll go through the list together before I leave. Just so I know you’re not fucking with me.”
Or would be until this day was over and he become be a senior next Fall.
Toni Stark was a lot of things but wasn't such a callous and horrible bitch that she could hurt someone she had grown to care about that much in such a horrible way. It’d be like kicking a puppy with a ball in their mouth that wanted to play fetch. It was not only mean, it was cruel beyond belief and totally unjustified. She couldn’t possibly do it.
Pierce did move back a little, but he was still far too close for Thor’s liking. He rolled his eyes and leaned against the lockers, looking rather annoyed now. “Seriously Foster, what do you see in that guy? He’s a total freak, I mean have you heard how he talks?” Jane smacked him again, this time in the face and threatened him with a fist.
“Hi sweetheart. You done everything that needed to be done?” Tony nodded and took a sip off his coffee. They’d always made a point to split the chores evenly, depending on time, income and other factors. And despite how Tony had never needed to lift a finger as far as chores went when he was a kid and had to be taught how to clean and do the dishes once he and Steve had moved in together after they’d moved to Boston for college, he’d always made sure to pull his own weight. Especially since he had a slightly higher income than Steve at the moment.
“No Steve, you can’t punch him. He’s a squishy human, your punches crush steel, it’s out of the question.”
But Steve just cut him off and his voice rose in volume slightly. "I've got no business being anywhere near someone like Toni. She's destined to meet and marry some other genius or a lawyer or a doctor or some other successful businessman out there. She can literally have her pick with anyone!"
“Ass.” He muttered under his breath and Steve chuckled, pressing a quick kiss to Tony’s cheek.
. C’mon Steve, my handwriting’s not
“Ooh, I’m flattered.”
And so Toni had done what she always did with attractive people; flirted shamelessly with them and she also stared equally as shamelessly at his muscles, face and ass. He, however, hadn't reacted in the way she was too used to. He was blushing like crazy, stumbling over his own feet and tongue while talking to her, like it was the first time a girl was flirting with him.
Because, as she just realized for herself, she
“So, are you a student too?” He eventually said and turned to look at her. She had taken out her phone and started play around with it, before looking up and smiling at him.
The kids find themselves on a strange spaceship, flying just above Planet Earth and meet the mysterious Watcher. He offers them a choice, to go on a mission through the galaxy or get sent back to summer camp. What will they choose?
The waiting had already been unbearable ever since Steve had left for 10 months; he had to make it worse by being late? And it wouldn’t be so bad if he was only a few minutes late, like ten minutes or so, and that was including the time it took to get off the plane, get through the arrival terminal and getting his bags. But he was almost thirty-seven minutes late by now and Tony was really getting antsier by the minute.
Thor had never been to America before moving here from Norway with his father, mother and brother, due to his father needing to work in America for a few years. And so far he couldn’t say he was too impressed by its residents.
He pushed himself up and leaned his back against the chair and tried to gather up his remaining energy and get into the kitchen to get something to eat, when suddenly someone covered his eyes and a voice said, "Guess who?"
“Dork.” Steve smirked, leaned down to kiss him on the cheek and then sat down in his own chair on the opposite side from Tony and gestured to the plates with food.
Tony stared in awe over the set table, the food and wine, the lit candles and was at a loss for words. “Y-you… you made dinner? This is only dinner for two, what about the others?” Steve shrugged and turned Tony around so they were looking each other in the eyes.
“Ugh, emotions are so draining, why do we even have them?” Steve just chuckled and shook his head, wrapping his arm around Tony’s shoulders.
- rise in his chest, ‘cause he started to get an idea of where this was going and he didn’t like one bit. But he made sure to keep his face reassuring and gentle, despite how hard it was getting to keep it like that. He squeezed his husband’s hand, being very careful not use his super-human strength to accidentally crush the bones in Tony’s smaller, frailer hand.
Steve had more or less gotten used to this and he was very touched to have a boyfriend who cared about him and wanted him to have good presents for his birthday. And after they got married it meant so much more that his husband loved him so much, and did consider letting up on the rule a little and maybe raise it to 500$, just for Tony.
AC/DC was blasting from the speakers at a volume so high that Steve, with his enhanced hearing, winced viciously and almost covered his ears. Almost a year of dating and he still hadn’t gotten used to how loud Tony played his music. Or his music.
"And yet you felt the need to decide for me who is good enough for me? Like that choice isn't up to me? Bruce Banner is a genius and going to change the world some day. Reed Richards is a genius and will be rich and famous one day. Justin Hammer is from a rich and somewhat powerful family. Do you see me hanging around them and trying to get dates out of them?"
Yeah, like that was going to happen.
“Say no more, Toni, I’m on it like stripes on a wasp!” She jumped off the bed and ran towards the closet, ripping the doors open. Toni had a whole lot of clothes- probably more than she actually wore but hey, you never know- and it took a while before Janet started to talk again as she looked through her many dresses, jeans and nice shirts.
Still, Steve took his responsibility to take care of Tony very seriously, and after almost 24 hours of working non-stop it was high time for him to get some sleep. So Steve headed down the stairs towards the workshop, punched in his access code with ease and walked in.
But at the same time, to go to space and see those new planets… to see new and strange places and creatures that no one on Earth had even dreamed about seeing or existed. He couldn’t deny that the scientist in him wasn’t thinking about it and wanted to see and do it all. Plus, he’d always told himself since his mom died that she would be up here among the stars, despite how he knew that it just couldn’t be true. So in a way, he felt closer to her up here than he’d ever been on Earth since her death.
“Later, Buck.”
And yeah, I also wanted to give you a look into Toni's head and see how she is and works. Also, it's the first story where I include Janet Van Dyne. I really like the idea of her and Tony being best friends in stories (mostly because of Avengers Academy, RIP you beautifully weird and amazing game) and I wanted Toni to have a best girl friend who wasn’t Pepper, so I decided to include her. But don't worry; she and Rhodey are still also best friends.
“It’s all subconscious.” Natasha had said once, rolling her eyes as Tony once again evaded their concern for him and disappeared down into his workshop with a refilled coffee cup. “He’s been working hard to get approval from other people all his life, he probably thinks he still needs to do it.” She shook her head and sighed tiredly. “идиот.” Her voice was tired and frustrated, but also had very soft hints of fondness in there.
out, you know. Like, he was the one who asked ‘do you wanna go out’ and not me.”
“At an animal shelter here in the city. He had been there for almost a year now, and he was just such a sweetheart that I knew I had to bring him home, that he’d be perfect for you.” Wait, what? Steve’s head snapped at him.
Which stung, like it always did when they didn’t want to spend time with him. But Ty and these asshats didn’t need to know that.
“Thanks babe. You’re the best.” He then walked over to the counter and started to unpack the groceries. “By the way, can you pay the bills today? I don’t get paid until tomorrow.” Tony smirked and picked up his laptop again.
“He’s just a little nauseous, I think. He’ll be okay.” Thor nodded and then started to look over the big control panel. It was covered with buttons, displays, levers and all kinds of blinking lights and big screen by the center chairs, almost like one from a small computer.
If only Tony could be more like Veronica in this moment.
Loki grinned and leaned back against the wall, still clutching the stuffed toy and making it wave its paw at him. “I am going to do what I have always wanted to do; spend some time far away for you and do whatever I feel like doing, without you here to drag me to play with sports or competitions or whatever you want to do. See, that is the beauty of it all. Since you have no friends and have forced me to whatever you want to do with you, and you will spend your summer away from me, I will finally be able to do whatever I want to.”
“Eat. You look like you need the energy.” Bucky muttered his thanks into his arms before sitting up and took a long sip of his coffee and groaning almost erotically in the mug. Steve snorted and rolled his eyes at his best friend before going back to his sketching.
“An excellent course of action my friends! You have saved all of our lives with this move, friend Clint. And friend Tony, your steering was quite impressive as well!” Tony and Clint both stumbled from the force from the slaps on their backs and blushed a little from the compliments, but Natasha just grumbled as she brushed her now very tousled hair out of her face and straightened out her clothes.
“7pm, Rogers. Don’t be late.” Then she waved goodbye at Sam and left the Starbucks without another word.
“Cut off a finger, seriously? This isn’t a hostage movie, Stark, can you please just
“Well, maybe you phone just has a bad reception.” He wiped his hands on his pants before taking out his own phone with a confident smirk. “My phone is the best of the best and has found reception everywhere.” Natasha glared at him and Steve looked at with annoyed eyes before rolling his eyes at him.
Steve suddenly seemed to deflate a little and moved to turn away from her. He looked kinda like a dog with its tail between its legs, and Toni suddenly realized how long she had been standing there with out giving him an answer, so she lunged forward and grabbed his wrist and pulled him back to her before she could stop and overthink the whole thing again. She tried to smile as sweetly as she could and she felt she had a few tears forming in her eyes and fall down her cheeks.
Tony Stark is a poser and a fake genius
“Yeah, exactly like that.” Then his smile turned even more mischievous. “Speaking of coffee…” Then he ripped himself out of Steve’s hold on him and ran out into the rain and down the path towards the coffeehouse. The rain and wind was pretty loud, so it was probably only because Steve’s super hearing that he heard Tony yelling, “Last one there pays!”
He felt a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Hey, are you sick?” He cracked one eye open and saw Steve stand over him, looking very concerned. He tried to smile, but it looked a bit more like a grimace and took another deep breath.
“So… what will we do now? Shall we try to discuss what our next course of action should be? How we shall vote?” Clint stared at him with wide eyes, as if the idea of what they should do was really freaking obvious.
Bruce was sitting with a book of his own, but he had taken to watch Tony and Clint throw their little rock-dart game, and while Clint was still better at hitting bulls-eye than Tony, Tony was still pretty good and did hit a few every once in a while too, until he eventually decided he’d had enough and sat down close to Bruce while Clint was rubbing his obvious victory in his face.
Steve raised an eyebrow back at his friend. “Are you kidding me right now? Do you know who she is? Antonia Elizabeth Stark, daughter of Howard Stark? Billionaire, genius and CEO of one of the most successful Tech conglomerates in the world? And she is clearly gonna take over that one day and revolutionize the world one day with her own genius.” He looked Sam right in the eyes and suddenly felt like a dog left out in the rain.
“Indeed, Captain. You have been known to bend the rules when we engage in Midgardian games. Perhaps we should change the purpose of the games to see who can cheat the best.” Thor said somewhere to his left, sounding pretty amused.
But right now Tony wasn’t smiling, not even a little. His expression was a little hard to read, Steve couldn’t quite pin down what Tony was feeling at the moment, aside from a hint of fear and shame, which made Steve worry about what had happened tonight. Steve and Tony had planned for the both of them to be there, but due to Fury dropping a mission on him and Natasha a few days prior; Steve had found himself busy with writing a mission report he needed to have finished by tomorrow. And Steve had been more than happy to avoid another night at a PR event, and once he finished had found himself on the couch, relaxing and watching TV until Tony came home. But now he was worrying about what had happened that made Tony look like that.
Toni Stark was a whirlwind, an adorable spitfire and she had taken his heart hostage from the first day he'd seen her.
"It's just a summer camp, Steve. You'll survive." She got up from the bed and headed for the door. But before she walked out, she turned to look at him with a soft, reassuring smile. "You know Steve, I have a good feeling about this summer. I think this camp will be good for you. Call it a hunch, but I think you'll really like this summer."
And now, the following day, he was just going through his back one last time to make sure he hadn’t forgotten or missed anything, before finally deciding he was done and going down the stairs and into the kitchen, where his dad was sitting with a bottle of beer and looking down at a newspaper.
No, she'd have to go through with it. Hey, maybe Steve would realize that she wasn't who he thought she was and wouldn't ask for any second dates? Just because she cared about him didn't mean that he would care about her once he saw her true colors. Might spare him the effort and heartache to cut it off before it could grow into something that would hurt them both.
“I saw him at a thrift store the other day. He came out of there with two bags of hoodies like that.” Bruce didn’t say anything in response. He knew he didn’t have a lot of clothes and wore a lot of the same stuff every day and that he looked really unkempt, with his shaggy hair and slightly big and dirty clothes and the tattered bag he had slung over his shoulder. But living with only one parent, who didn’t make a lot of money, was kinda testing on your bank account.
She rolled her eyes, clearly annoyed but pushed the bottle towards them. “Relax, it’s just water. I always bring water with me just in case. And you look like you need something to drink right now.” Bruce immediately felt a bit embarrassed for his reaction, but there were a lot of rumors floating around about Natasha and that bottle she always carried around.
Now, he had made some acquaintances with a few other young students, such as Bruce Banner, and had even managed to obtain a lovely girlfriend in Jane Foster and made friends with her friends. But the negative attitude that was simmering in this city was almost enough to choke him at times. And while Loki had been fortunate enough to find a click that more or less suited him- a strange little group of mixed individuals- Thor had a bit more of a tough time finding a good place among his peers, before finally joined the football team. But he still could not help but feel that- as nice as some of the people were at this school- they were laughing at him behind his back or made jokes at his expense.
“Yeah but we have to try something, right? Or else we might be trapped here for who knows how long.” He moved to sit down in one of the middle chairs. “Let’s just have a look-“ But just as he sat down, and before he could touch or look at anything, the lights went off and everything started to beep and blink as an electric buzzing went off. Tony flew up from his chair, only a second after Thor and everyone quickly moved away from the panel as everything seemed to boot up.
"Y-You… you mean it?" Steve croaked out, sounding about his disbelieving as Toni was about her own line of thinking at the moment, but he sounded so sweet and so incredibly hopeful that she couldn't do anything else but grab his hand tighter and smile wider at him.
Clint snorted and ruffled Tony hair, making the slighter shorter guy squawk in outrage. “Your hair ain’t that good-lookin’ Stark. If you have to style it before going out, then you’re clearly not a naturally handsome guy, like me.” He smirked and rested his arm on Tony’s head and leaning on him slightly before Tony pushed him off, looking mighty annoyed.
Toni stared at her for a second, unsure how to respond, before smiling back and hugging her. “Thanks Janet, I will.” And so she took the purse and her jacket and got out of the apartment, only stopping once she got out on the street.
And with that, Rumlow finally let him go and Schmidt dropped the sketchbook on the table and they left. Steve stared after them and panted heavily and angrily at their backs as they left and rubbed his aching arms. He wanted to run after them and give them a piece of his mind, but he also really wanted to get through today without causing a fight. He didn’t want to come home to his mother and say he got into
Blinking away the tears that were forming in his eyes, Tony swallowed down a soft sob and buried his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and tried to cover it up with a laugh. “You are such a sap, Rogers. Why have I put up with your and your sap for all these years?”
Natasha started to look over the walls, running her fingers over the smooth, cool metal to try and find anything that could tell them how to get out of there, and the others weren’t slow to follow suit and try find a button or hatch or a door that could get them out of there. But before anyone found anything, one end of the box opened itself like a slide door, making all of them jump back and stare at the opening.
Tony had grabbed Steve’s hand and ran in under the closest gazebo to shelter them from the rain and then started to shake the rain out of his hair and clothes. Steve just watching him fondly and shook his head amusedly because Tony both acted and looked like a cat right then and there. Which was fairly accurate really, considering Tony hated water, whether it was in the pool back at the tower or it was falling from the sky.
She smirked and leaned in close. “I’m counting on it, Rogers. Otherwise I’ll hunt you down and drag you out with me.” Then she leaned in closer and kissed Steve on the cheek, squeezed his hand before letting go and getting out of her seat, grabbing her bag.
And God, if it wasn’t everything Tony had ever wanted.
Tony had always liked him. Despite being from a rather financially limited family, having very little aside from his art degree and a rather mediocre job and not really being that eye-catching until he got big and muscle-y, Tony had always looked to him as a hero and the reason he was still alive today. Especially during their sophomore year when Tony had come to his house in tears, a big bruise on his face and admitted that he’d had thoughts of killing himself and that Howard had hit him and his mother did nothing. That year had been extremely tough to get through and Steve’s mom had been adamant about calling the police and Tony getting professional help, which Tony had been equally adamant about not getting it because ‘dad would never allow it or pay for it.’ So Steve had done absolutely everything he could and made sure Tony always felt loved and sat with him for hours on end whenever he needed to talk or just wanted to be held while he cried. It had been tough, but they’d gotten through it. And once they had and Tony felt better, he’d taken Steve out on date under the stars and gave a long speech about how grateful he was for all the help and how much he loved him for all that he had done for him. And Steve had just said that he was worth it.
Okay, yes, she needed to break up the tension with a little humor, but all this emotional talk was getting a little much for her, she needed to make him laugh a little. And she did manage to startle a laugh out of him and he looked a little more relaxed now. Then he swallowed loudly and licked his lips, covering her hands with the hand she wasn't holding.
His friends, to their credit, tried their best to help him when he had these days. Natasha and Bruce had been very vocal about him talking to a doctor and maybe getting some anti-depressants or other medication or help to deal with these thoughts better, and Clint and Thor tried their best to pull him out of his funks by trying to include him in fun games or activities, like playing video games, watch movies or try to play games with the whole team. And while Steve appreciated their attempts and intentions, he usually just wanted to be left alone one days like these, and sometime the team just didn’t seem or want to understand.
Bucky stared at him over his laptop and mouthed,
Tony sighed and relaxed almost instantly and he leaned back against Steve’s chest, resting his forehead against Steve’s neck. “Mm, hello there soldier.” Steve didn’t say anything, just held him and pressed a kiss to his temple. Tony chuckled a little, gently pulled a little so he could turn around to face his boyfriend, and looked up at him with a smile.
“Well, better than hanging around you and constantly having to save your butt all the time. I am not your bodyguard, Clint.” She got off the bed and started to go through her bags one final time. “Besides, anything is better than staying in the city for the whole summer.”
“Ah, don’t feel too bad about this situation, brother. I am sure you can find adventures on the camp too. Perhaps you will be able to catch a wild boar, or win the grand battles of Capture The Flag.” He laughed and then left, leaving Thor only barely holding his anger back and slamming the door shut behind him.
“Do you believe it’s reckless to choose to go on this adventure? While I admit the idea is very enticing and I do wish to go on this mission, perhaps we are a bit hasty?” Clint’s smile weakened too and he shrugged before folding his arms over his chest.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ve heard that before. But I’m almost done with the repulsor on this boot, and after that I only have-“ Steve rolled his eyes again, a fond smirk forming over his lips and looked at his boyfriend, head tilted slightly to the left and resting his hands on his hips. He chuckles.
“Gee, I don’t know, maybe that you always seem to have planned something for my birthday. Like that time you planned that picnic in DC, somehow with great view but away from all the people so we could be alone without fans coming up all the time? Or when you got me free passes for the Museum of Modern Art for a whole year, while also having hired the place for the night and arranged a dinner date? Or when you proposed to me? Are you seriously telling me you haven’t planned something for today, when I officially turn 100 years old?”
“Hi there, Blondie.” Steve swallowed, shook his head to clear his thoughts and licked his lips.
“Oh, just go already you big jerk! I don’t want you to reek of sweat when we sit down to watch movies and have dinner.” Steve just laughed and bowed exaggeratedly and playfully at Tony, a big smile spreading over his face.
like you Toni. I think I’ve liked you since that first day we met. And I’d really like to be more than your friend, to take you out on a date, and treat you right and make you feel special like you deserve and-“
your fault when something like this happens.”
“Well then, Tony, could I maybe treat you to some Gelato? As an apology for pushing you into the water.” Tony smirked at him and a small laugh escaped his lips.
"But I… really, really like you Toni. I think I've liked you since that first day we met. And I'd really like to be more than your friend, to take you out on a date, and treat you right and make you feel special like you deserve and-" His voice broke and just stood there, staring at her with wet eyes, still trying to blink them away.
“If I ever see him, can I punch him?”
“Well, I guess we’d better get comfortable here, we could be here for a while.” Thor looked at him, confused and head tilted to the side.
He opened his mouth to speak, but his father glared down at him; firm and practically daring him to speak back to him. "Anthony, this is not up for discussion. Your mother and I have made our decision, you will go to this camp for the summer. We have already booked in a vacation and after your stunt last summer; you can erase any ideas or hope that we'll ever let you stay alone in this house again. Jarvis is upstairs packing your bags right now and the taxi will come and pick you up tomorrow morning."
“I’m just trying to find a way out of here!” He moved onto looking over the big hairdryer, running his fingers over the cool metal and looking over the display and buttons on the sides. When he didn’t seem to find anything of too much interest or that could tell him where they were, he moved on the doors. The one behind the hair dryer was locked and no matter how much Tony yanked on the door handle or fiddled with the lock, it remained immovable, so he eventually moved on to the other doors.
He only grumbled and threw a pair of socks at him. “I know what you are attempting to do Loki, and it won’t work. I can’t say that I’m too happy with how all of this has transpired, but I am simply trying to make the best of it.” He grabbed a couple of jeans, a few t-shirts and a couple of hoodies before stuffing it all into his bag. “Also, I don’t seem to recall you having any better plans for the summer. What are you going to do with all your free time, exactly?”
Janet squeezed her tightly and stroked a hand over her hair.
They sat like that for a while, wrapped up in each other’s arms, just being together and loving each other’s company. Then, after a few minutes of silence…
“Will you
Steve smirked without looking up from the napkin he had started to sketch on to help pass the time before more costumers would come in and hopefully time would go a little faster. “Hey, Buck. Feeling lively today, are we?”
Janet cooed and crawled up to sit beside her, hugging her close again. “I know Tones. But I really don’t think he’s a bad guy. Based on everything you’ve said about him, based on what he said when he didn’t know you were there, I think he really likes you. You should at least give him a chance to surprise you before you decide he’s no good.”
Thor looked over at Bruce, who was still sitting by the hairdryer and looked over at Steve, coming up to him so they could speak to themselves. “Is he well? He looks ill.” Steve glanced over at Bruce, who thankfully didn’t look as pale anymore and had regained some color in his face.
Life could certainly be worse.
Of course Pierce had run off to tell the principal that he had threatened to injure him today, which he had called to tell his father about. And Odin of course had been furious at how Thor had threatened with violence and had yelled at him for so long about how it made the family look and how he needed to think before acting and control his anger and, bla bla bla. Thor had heard that talk many a time before.
Toni smiled sweetly at him, her big brown eyes bright and full of emotion. “I would love to, Steve. How about we meet up here, maybe around 7pm?” Steve was so overwhelmed by finally asking her out and her answer that he couldn’t do more than nod and say, “Sure, I’ll be there.”
As if it wasn’t enough being painted up as The All-American Hero who always fought for the underdog and sacrificed his life for his country, he also needed to be born on the freaking Independence Day.
“Aw man, no. Come on Cap, keep your foreplay in the bedroom, okay?” Tony’s head jerked up and he glared at the archer. But before he could say anything, Steve started walking again, turning a corner and their friends were suddenly of sight.
“Well, see, Dodger was already pretty cheap because he’d been there for so long and they really wanted someone to take him and give him a nice home. So, yeah, I spent the 100$ on getting him, but I figured you might have wanted a collar and a leash, a bowl and some toys and food and stuff. So, yeah, it cost a little bit more than 100$ to get him.”
And it was probably because his eyes were closed and his mind was elsewhere that it all came as such a surprise when he suddenly felt someone bump into him, pretty roughly too. It took him so by surprise that he ended up tripping over his own feet, stumbled over a long, taut rope that was keeping a boat tied to the dock and he fell into the water with a small yelp.
“Okay, so what we wanna do here is make you look nice but not too much so you scare him off before you actually go on the date. Since you never actually said anything about it being fancy, we’ll have to assume it’s somewhat casual. But you also want to make yourself look nice and presentable so you look like you’re taking this seriously. If you show up on a first date with a t-shirt, jeans and unwashed hair, you’ll look like you don’t care about it, which is never how you want to start a date.” She looked over a blue dress with a low neckline and a very high slit, shook her head and hung it back before going back to looking.
Steve’s smile widened and a few more tears fell down his cheek and Tony raised his hands to his face, gently wiping them away. “And two, how long have we been friends? Fifteen years? You have always been the best friend I could ever ask for, even before you asked me on a date, or said that you loved me. You’ve looked after me when I was in trouble; let me cry on your shoulder after fights with my dad or when another boyfriend or girlfriend turned out to be a bust. And you’ve always been there for me to rein me in when I get lost in work or school or when I’m just being stupid, when I’m being an asshole or when I just need to get my head out of my ass. You have always been there for me, even before I was a genius and dad tried to exploit it.”
He had been working at the time. It was Wednesday, which meant he had no classes, which in turn meant he had a shift at the Starbucks close by MIT, so off to work he went. And it had been a very calm day. Sure, there was always the morning rush, where students or early workers came running in to get their coffee and maybe some breakfast before rushing off to classes or work, but after that it been a very slow day. Which, hey, it was always nice every once in a while to have a little peace and quiet, but he usually liked for
century for a few years now, Steve could say with his hand on his heart that things were better here. There was so much better food, no need to boil everything and spare every little crumb you could find because of lack of money, though the habit to save food and not waste too much food still hadn’t really left him, and probably never would. God, he would never get over the wastefulness of this century. Polio being almost entirely gone and vaccines preventing it was fantastic, and of course the Internet. Nowadays information was so much easier to come by these days, much better than having to look everything up in books or newspapers.
“Toni, would you like to… go out… on a date... with me?” He said it. He finally got it out. Hallelujah, he finally said it. At least it was finally out in the open. He was sweating like a pig and his face was probably beet red at this point, but at least he’d finally said it.
Tony smirked at him from his seat, his cheek resting on his fist and with his elbow on the table. "Looks like we're really hungry, are we?" Steve smirked back and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and then wiped it on his uniform.
“Yeah, that was they called him at the shelter. But I figured I’d give you the chance to give him whatever name you wanted. Just ‘cause I like ya.” Steve smirked and then looked back at his puppy again. Just then, Sam threw the ball and it accidently ended up in Steve’s lap, so Dodger came flying at him and crashed his muzzle into his lap before grabbing the ball again and lifting his head up, panting heavily and then dropping the ball back in Steve’s lap. It was warm dripping droll with a dark spot forming on Steve’s pants. But he just laughed and scratched the dog behind the ear.
But despite her strong words and her own underlying fears about Steve's intentions, Toni just couldn't stay away from him, which she could only try to explain that with the fact that she was an incurably curious person and she wanted to get some answers on her questions about him. So she kept walking to that Starbucks, learned the days and times he worked and struck up conversations with him and even tried some harmless flirting. At first she dialed back enough so he wouldn't get too flustered or uncomfortable, but with time she let up more and more and he became more comfortable around her and even started to flirt back, which was a bit surreal.
So she found herself caught between a rock and a hard place; because she couldn't make herself get away from Steve but she was still terrified of being hurt by him or him leaving her when he got a glimpse under the surface and learned about all of her issues or got to see what kind of life she lived. It was one thing when assholes hurt her, because she knew they were swallow or gold diggers or wanted her body for a fuck, but if someone like Steve did it… If she let him in only for him to turn away from her and leave or even try to hurt her somehow…
But Steve had looked so damn hopeful when she said she wanted to give him a chance. And so happy when she'd said yes when he finally asked. If she went back in and cancelled or stood him up tonight, it might break his heart.
“You never do. The fact that you even had lunch today is a once-in-a-blue-moon thing.” Tony rolled his eyes at him, but his response died in his throat as they walked into the kitchen.
Steve groaned and fell back on his bed. The only reason he thought this camp would be bearable was because he would have Bucky with him, and now he wouldn't even have his best friend with him! How would he survive now?
idiot. And you’re the one in a relationship with me, have stayed with me since were fifteen and have said yes to marry me. So what does that say about you, mister?”
It had been one of the most amazing things Steve had seen.
Toni knew that this was a bad idea.
“What do you mean, Stark? You said it was a race and I won fair and square. What’s the problem?” Tony’s eyes narrowed even further and folded his arms over his chest, pouting in that way that Steve found so adorable.
“What is this, some kind of movie set?” Natasha laughed, the laugh equally as breathless and weak as her brother’s and placed a hand on his shoulder.
“But you’re a smart guy, Bruce.” Tony, narrowing his eyes at Steve when he saw what he was trying to do, placed his arm around Bruce’s shoulders and grinned at him.
After The Watcher vanished and the lights came back on again a tense silence fell over the room. Everyone looked at the buttons, waiting for someone to make the first move and be the first to vote. Which, of course, turned out to be Tony. He shoved himself between Clint and Steve and walked up to the buttons with a confidant grin on his face.
“Where are you going, friend Tony?” Thor called after him and Tony turned to look back at them over his shoulder.
Steve huffed a wet laugh and pressed his cheek against Tony’s head, his arms tightening around him so much that it kinda hurt and made it a little hard to breathe. But again, whatever, Tony could take it. He and Steve hadn’t seen each other for several months; he would take all the attention and love Steve had to give him.
.” Before turning on his heel made turned to leave, when Rumlow called after him.
Steve jerked forward and barked, “Hey! Don’t touch anything if you don’t know what it is!” Tony rolled his eyes but didn’t look away.
Then came the day of his 100
a freak! Go back to the woods and fjords, you fucking Viking freak!” Then he turned tail and hurried away. And as Thor looked after him he started to hear the words Viking freak being whispered around him and other students were either laughing at him or glaring angrily at him.
Steve slowly made his way over to the couch, but made sure to walk on the one squeaky floor board so he wouldn’t startle Tony, and sat down next to him on the couch, close enough for Tony to find comforting but also not too close so he wouldn’t make him uncomfortable.
“Risk of what? Getting groomed by some alien? Like that can’t happen on Earth.” Steve gritted his teeth and turned to Tony, visibly holding back himself back from stalking over to him.
So in the end, he was torn over what to answer Steve, so he just shrugged and nodded weakly. “Yeah, I guess. I mean, I know it’s dangerous and all, but…” He shrugged again and looked away from Natasha and Steve’s prying looks. “I don’t know.”
Tony looked away, looking very ashamed and guilty. “I just… I feel like I’ve cheated on you.” He whispered the words, so quietly that if Steve hadn’t had his enhanced hearing he probably wouldn’t have heard it. But he did, and he immediately kissed Tony again, on the forehead, then the nose and then his mouth.
“God, you
if you’d like.”
“If you think that’s good toots, you should see his paintings. Or, you know, when he’s actually trying. He’s much, much better when he’s actually putting effort into it.” Steve glared at him but the girl just smirked at him.
Hulk just grumbled. “You gonna keep playing, Goldilocks?” And then the sounds of the TV and the video game started again. Steve just shook his head and a small smile spread over his face or hearing her talk.
Oh yeah, because she totally needed Clint to survive the day like some kind of bodyguard. Sure, they looked out for each other, always had and always would. But more often than not,
Peaceful? Hah!
going out in the rain with only a blazer and t-shirt on, that is
Dad jerked his thumb towards the door. “Cab’ll be here ‘n a few min’uts. J’st go ‘n wait outs’de.” Bruce nodded and gave him a quick hug before going out.
Jane gently took him by the arm and led him away from the crowd and towards the classroom of his next class, but the damage had already been done. Thor knew that he’d had a hard time understanding the students around him, but now he knew it would be impossible to get on their level, as he was now being dubbed Viking freak by his peers.
“I told you, Pierce, I’m not interested. One, I have a boyfriend, so no. Two, even if I didn’t have a boyfriend, I wouldn’t go out with you if you were the last guy on planet Earth. So kindly get lost before I tell Darcy to whip out her taser. Again.”
A loud
Tony was always worth it.
“Oh man, that means it’s up to me. And I still haven’t decided.” Steve smiled gently and placed his hand on Bruce’s shoulder.
“It sure does look like that, doesn’t it? But this looks like you have different programs on it. Maybe it has more than one function?” Tony shrugged with a wry smirk.
“Then get your ass in gear, Barton!” Tony called after him from where he was, observing one of the big machines in the room and running his hands over the cool, white metal. Thor looked after him shrugged and then ran after him.
Tony shook his head and smiled fondly after his boyfriend and rolled his eyes at his ridiculousness. He chuckled a little and turned in the direction of the door, saying very softly, “I love you too.”
Tony smiled widely and raised his hands to Steve’s face, gently stroking the apples of his cheeks and tried to wipe away his tears- though that turned out to be rather futile as more tears just kept coming anyway- which made Steve’s smile widen back at him and put his own hands over Tony’s as he leaned into his touch, squeezing them tightly and pressing them to his face.
Natasha, who was somehow not as tired as him, made her way into the kitchen and got herself a sandwich and an apple before she walked out of the room and patted him on the shoulder as he passed him. "Get some rest Cap, and something to eat. You look like you need it." He groaned tiredly into the table and practically heard her smile as she left the room.
“Yeah, let’s listen to Ms. Bossy-Pants over there!” She glared over at him and Bruce could see that she really wanted to smack him but either restrained herself enough or was to distracted by what was going on around them to actually do it. But Steve bumped his knees against the seat in front of him to get his attention.
“I’m sure I can fix it. I’m really good with engines, it shouldn’t take too long.” Steve rolled his eyes but he also started to get of the car.
Still, he didn’t say anything and shifted even closer to his fiancé.
It almost looked like Steve was trying to convince himself that he was finally home and with his boyfriend again just as much as Tony was.
It had been a very big surprise when his father had told him, the second he had come home from school yesterday, that he would be sent to a summer camp instead of staying in the city, mostly because of how much money these things usually cost and they were not made of money. Especially after his mom had died and his father had been forced to pay for everything on his own. Bruce had tried to find part-time jobs to help pay the bills and save as much as he could for emergencies, but it was still not much.

Steve rolled his eyes and refilled the coffee machine with beans. “There’s nothing to ask, Sam. We’re just friends.” Sam rolled his eyes back and shook his head, muttering something about ‘
Tony stared up at him incredulously for almost a full minute before he narrowed his eyes at him. “Seriously? You go out of your way to turn me on just to slam the door in my face?” Steve just looked at him wide eyes and quickly got rid off his own pants and shoes.
Steve stood there, frozen behind the counter and stared after her.
Steve smiled down at him with such adoration and unquestionable love that it made Tony’s stomach drop and his heart stutter and he almost teared up again. He gently let go of Tony’s wrists and reached out one hand towards Tony’s face, gently stroking his knuckles over his cheek and wiping a tear away with his thumb.
blew Tony’s mind- they had started to really build a life together as adults and a couple. They had started to look at new apartments and managed to find a nice, homey apartment, a little closer to New York. It wasn’t much, the kitchen and living room was one big room, to the point where they didn’t even have room for a dining table and just ate their meals on the couch in front of the TV most of the time and the hallway was a bit too narrow for Tony’s liking. But it was still bigger and way cozier than their old place had been and it just felt much more like a home to both of them. And it didn’t matter how big it was, because it was theirs, their cozy little place that they could make into a home all on their own. The rest was completely irrelevant as far as Tony was concerned.
“He’s wonderful! Where did you find him?” Tony’s smile softened and kneeled down beside him on the floor, patting the dog on the head.
disapproving crap! And mark my words, if you try to meddle with me or our lives ever again, I swear I will make you regret it!”
Tony had been out for only a few hours at yet another PR Event, promoting Stark Industries and all the new directions he wanted to take or projects they had started up, which had meant that the rest of the Avengers had not been needed, which all of them saw as a relief. Clint hated any affair where he needed to wear a tux or a tie, whining about how they were restrictive and he couldn’t breathe. Bruce felt incredibly uncomfortable at social events like these and usually ended up in a corner somewhere, trying to make himself invisible. Thor didn’t necessarily dislike these events, he could easily entertain other guests with tales of Asgard or the many great battles he had been fighting in before ever coming to Earth, but he still didn’t always know how to act or speak with these people and had sometimes ended up unintentionally insulting or lightly injuring others in his attempts to convey engaging storytelling. Natasha was the only one who knew how to act at these things, on the same level as Tony did, but it was still clear that she did not like spending her time around stuck-up rich people.
“Nah, I think you’re done for the day.” Tony growled angrily and refused to stop kicking or squirming or writhing in Steve’s grip, though it proved to be a very fruitless struggle. To Steve it was like carrying a bag of laundry over his shoulder, except he had to tilt his head slightly to side every now and then to avoid Tony's attempts at kicking him in the face. Whether it would be intentional or not was hard to tell, it was always hard to tell with Tony.
“Perhaps it’s designed to keep our heads warm? It does not appear to have any articles for your hair.” Clint and Tony laughed and Thor’s smirk widened a little. Then he turned somber and looked up at the others.
“Well, apparently mom overheard it from the Van Dynes, who I assume heard it from Jan. So she told him and asked if he had heard about it, which he hadn’t. And he freaked out and called the second he heard about it. And well,” He shrugged and glanced over at Steve. “here we are.”
“Well, thank you for the tip, Shaggy. I’ll keep that in mind for the future.” She then turned back to Steve with a softer smile. “But seriously, for ‘not really trying’ this is good. Way too good to be ‘doodles’ in my own inartistic opinion.”
Tony had never been a particularly good swimmer. He had learned, obviously he had learned to swim, but he had never been too fond of swimming or water in general.  But once he managed to get his head above water, he’d felt that the cuff of his jeans was caught on something and he couldn’t yank it free. And because of how deep it was and the fact that it was his cuff that was stuck, he could barely keep his head above the water. As he tried to pull his leg free and keep himself afloat with his arms, waves kept splashing into his face, mouth and eyes, making him swallow or accidently inhale salt water, which made him cough and splutter and made it much harder to keep his head above the water or avoid new waves, never mind calling for help.
The guy though probably took Tony’s long silence as him not know English, because he suddenly looked a little wary and looked like he was trying hard to remember something, before speaking again, this time in Italian. “Uh…
Tony had already arrived at the hair dryer when Clint and Thor came up to him, and he was running his fingers over the metal and looked over the small display and the buttons on the side. He looked up briefly at the others before looking back at the display.
“Well, I’m out of protein bars. I don’t suppose anyone else had the idea of bringing along snacks for the trip, ‘cause I don’t think we’ll get dinner either.” No one did have anything else to eat and Clint shivered, rubbing his hands over his arms.
or some other crap like that that belonged somewhere back in the 1940's, and Steve had moved to intervene only for Toni to lay into him, how he had inferior grades compared to hers, how his inventions always malfunctioned or were bad copies of hers and how his father's company was on the verge of collapse while Stark Industries was thriving and making billions every year. And when he still refused to leave her alone and tried to put his hands on her, she had pulled off one of her very high and sharp heels and placed it against his throat, threatening to castrate him with it if he didn't leave yesterday.
Never let it be said that Tony Stark was a lazy person. Sure, he sometimes liked to laze around on his days off and spend as long as he could in bed with Steve and just watch TV on the couch with a pizza for lunch. He was also way more of a morning person than people usually took him for, despite all the jokes that his teammates might make at the breakfast table when Tony dragged himself into the kitchen, still half asleep and clutching his coffee mug like it was the Holy Grail. Which, if you asked Tony, it might as well be, considering he was way more protective of his coffee than he was of his own health. Something that really concerned Steve and he usually gave Tony part of his own breakfast, just to make sure Tony ate enough. And who was Tony to say no to his boyfriend’s pathetically big, sad puppy-dog eyes? You’d have better luck telling a group of starving orphans that lunch was cancelled for the day.
Tony took another breath, but he broke their eye contact, looking down his shoes again. Steve didn’t say anything about it, just squeezed Tony’s hand reassuringly. “H-he… he showed up at the event. I-I didn’t know he was gonna be there. And from what Pepper told me, it didn’t sound like he was invited. He might’ve been a plus one for someone, or he snuck in somehow, I don’t know…”
“Yeah? Well, I’m happy to be of service in any way I can, mister.” Bucky groaned somewhere behind Tony, either out annoyance or because of how corny the line was.
Tony was too surprised to react when Steve first grabbed him, but when his brain caught up with what was going around him, he started to kick and squirm and push his hands against Steve’s back to try and squirm out of his grip.
“If you have nothing of value to say Loki, I suggest you leave me to my packing.” Loki smirked and plumped down on the bed, picking up one of Thor’s stuffed animals and played a little with it.
It was just a summer camp. What was the worst thing that could really happen?
And so Steve accepted that his friends wanted to celebrate him, though made it clear he wanted to celebrate it in his own way, usually just with a couple of friends, some good food and beers, maybe a few movies. And since Tony always tried to get him super expensive gifts, he made a rule that if his friends wanted to give him gifts, it would have to cost under 100$. It had irked Tony something fierce but Steve was firm on this point, even after he and Tony got together and eventually married.
“Are you alright?” The voice sounded very worried- and very American- but Tony was still coughing up water, but when he finally felt like he could breathe and his eyes didn’t sting so much anymore, he blinked a few times and looked up at his savior and-
“What’s wrong, love?” He kept his voice soft and concerned, hoping it might help Tony ease up a little, but he still stiff and didn’t move from his spot by the elevator.
“Well, I guess I have my orders, General Stark. And trust me, I have no intentions of ever letting you go, ever again. I thought I made that clear when we were still in high school.”
Then of course was the time he had proposed to Steve, with a ring he had made with materials from his armor and Steve’s shield. The 100$ had gone to the food and drinks for celebration.
“Yeah, can’t a couple of guys just talk without it meaning anything?” Tony almost rolled his eyes. Seriously, if Justin weren’t hanging around Ty and Aldrich all the time, he would never see him as a threat or even a bully. He was nothing but a wannabe who was trying way too hard to be cool and suave but was failing on that front, even when he was hanging around them like a lost puppy.
“Why?” She rolled her eyes, grabbed his sleeve and yanked him back.
He smirked and leaned in closer, till he was inches away from his face and whispered into his ear. “You don’t belong here, Rogers. You should go back to Brooklyn and stay with your kind of people; poor and mediocre. You’re
that small, you little bastard!” Giggling like a mad man, Tony’s smirk turned into a wide smile as he tried to wriggle out of Steve’s tickling hands and his tight grip on him while also attempting to hold back his laughter.
Steve told himself mentally.
Having lived in the 21
“Nah, he’ll have to learn to share, just like everyone else. I’m not sharing him with anyone else and he knows it.” Tony smiled fondly at him, a small blush covering his cheeks. Steve just smirked. “And I’m sure Tony can learn to share too. He’s such a good boy.” Tony fond smile turned into a mock scowl and he smacked Steve on the shoulder, which just made Steve laugh.
ever been kidnapped?” Steve lost the glare, now looking more confused as he shook his head. Tony nodded and looked away from him. “Okay then.” Then he started to walk further into the room and looked over the walls and doors, fingering on the displays and buttons that were scattered across the room.
Bruce took a deep, shuddering breath, still looking very pale. “It looks like some sort of control room. Maybe we’re in some kind of… nuclear power plant or something?” Tony shrugged but also looked a bit more curious than the others.
Tony laughed both in surprise and delight, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist and his arms around Steve’s neck. He leans in as close as he can to Steve’s face, so close that their noses are touching, and whispers into his ear, “Well then, give away, soldier.”
And that wasn’t even touching the rumors that surrounded him.
“I am merely saying that I feel pity for you. To spend the whole summer far away from here, in some stuffy forest alone with no friends or Internet or anything else that you might enjoy. Poor Thor, no friends and no fun things to do for two and a half months.”
Clint groaned again and shoved his spare hearing aids into bag. "Fucking hell, why did we agree to this Nat? I hate camps, you hate camps so why are we going at all?"
“Nah, I like it. Dodger is perfect.”
Tony sighed as he pulled up in the school’s parking lot.
“Maybe it’s just some military training exercise or something? We should be safe here.” Bruce shook his head; his breathing getting quicker and already feeling the stress, panic and claustrophobia make him a mess of nerves and fear.
The kids slowly made their way towards the podium, all a bit warily, and took their spots around it. “What is that?” Clint asked, nudging Tony in the side, who just shrugged while never looking away from the screen. Natasha elbowed him in the side with a glare and shushed him before looking back at the screen, just as the voice started talking again.
Thor gritted his teeth and snatched the animal out of Loki’s hands and putting it back on his bed. “I do not force you to-“ Then he stopped as he remembered that he had, in fact, dragged Loki away to a lot of activities that he had wanted to do. Many football games, concerts and activities in Central Park, but not so many things that Loki had wanted to do.
Steve could barely talk around the puppy and the licking, but he managed to grab its squirming body and lifted it down on the floor before sitting down in front of it, petting and scratching behind ears and on the belly and everywhere else.
They weren’t friends exactly, but they did greet each other every now and then when they passed each other in the hallways. But other than that, Bruce was alone for the most part and usually spent all his time away from classes in the library to hide from bullies or jerks or assholes?
"Well, I guess I'll just have to guess, so… Is it Tony?" Tony laughed and removed his hands from Steve's face and he smiled down at him, wrappings his arms around Steve's chest from behind, resting his chin on his shoulder.
Toni nuzzled her face into Janet's neck and let out a low, shaky breath. "Thanks Jan. But I don't know if I'm ready for that yet. Or ever."
asked
“Quinoa is, in fact, a thing, honey. It’s this seed that is really good for you and it’s delicious in a salad or as a substitution for rice or pasta. And considering how much you want me to eat better I figured you would approve. Why didn’t you Google it, or call if you didn’t know what it was?” Steve groaned and put away the last few groceries.
Clint grinned and they high-fived each other. “I knew there was a reason I liked you Stark. You’ve got guts.” Tony smirked at him. Thor also grinned widely at them.
Janet rolled her eyes and smacked her on the shoulder. “Well
Toni laughed and shook her head fondly. God, she loved Janet so much. “No, no that’s fine.” She then bit her lip and looked down at her covers. “But, there is one thing you can do. See, whenever I go out, I attract guys who want me for my body and looks and I know how to look in order to get that. But… I haven’t been on a real, actual date in years…” Janet stared at her with wide, happy and excited eyes.
“Oh yeah? Well, look how the tables have turned now, Stark! Who’s the shrimp now?” They laughed and Tony kept trying to wriggle out of Steve’s grip and Steve kept tickling him or rub his knuckles against Tony’s skull.
He started to go over the pros and cons of each choice in his head again, when he heard Clint mutter under his breath, either talking to Tony and Thor or just talking to himself.
“Maybe not for you super soldier folk, but us mere mortals don’t have bodies like furnaces that keep us warm no matter where we are.” He grumbled and sat down on a bench. “I am
Steve jumped almost a foot in the air and turned around, his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open, making for a rather funny sight but she wasn't in the mood to laugh right now. She kept her face as straight as possible and hoped it would be enough to make him nervous.
But most of the room was empty, aside from one end that was taken up by a giant closed window and a big control panel, along with six chairs in front of it. There were actually a couple of windows here and there in the room, but they were all covered so when Natasha tried to look outside and to see where they were, she couldn’t see anything aside from metal.
coming with?" Steve had to fight really hard so he wouldn't yell into the phone, suddenly feeling nervous and scared. He and Bucky had more or less been goaded into going to camp together by their mothers and they had eventually caved, albeit under protest and had been prepared to find ways to tough through it together however they could. And now Bucky was calling and saying he wasn't going to go at all? What the hell!
“I’m Steve Rogers.”
“Just… just hold me, please?” Steve definitely didn’t need to be asked twice. He quickly wrapped both of his arms around his lithe frame and pulled him close, leaning his head against Tony’s and Tony rested his forehead in the crook of his neck.
“Yes, yes, sleep and food is important, I get it but I-“ He got cut off by a yawn that threatened to break his jaw, and his eyes drooped slightly. Still, Tony was nothing if not stubborn, so he turned to Steve and poked a finger at his chest. “That meant nothing.”
“Aw honey, it’s cute you think I’m giving you a choice.” Tony’s head snapped up, his eyebrows scrunched together and his focus suddenly entirely on Steve’s words and the tone in Steve’s voice but given only a second to figure out what it means for him before Steve grabbed him around the waist, threw him over his shoulder and heads for the door. “JARVIS, let’s close up shop for tonight.”
“What is this, Candid Camera?” Tony whispered to Clint, who snorted a little but the others quickly and harshly shushed at them and Natasha smacked Tony on the head, quite hard too. Tony yelped in pain and rubbed his head while throwing a dirty glare at her.
“Well, I can’t find any clues on this thing that can tells us what this is supposed to be. But yeah, it does look like a sitting area, but it’s the weirdest dinner table I have ever seen. And my mom has had some pretty crazy ideas of how to furnish a room.”
“Ask Cap. It’s his dog, ergo his decision.” Steve grinned at Tony and then down at his dog, which had turned his attention on Sam and was now licking his hands and face and wagging his tail so hard it now looked like he would fall over soon.
Steve shrugged with a grin. “Well, why not? It’s July, it’s not
“Well, I guess that’s how you did things in your house, did you? Did your daddy shove his arrow up your ass or did they teach you that at the circus?” Clint’s smirk turned into grimace and he took another deep breath.
actually want to go here, either? What was that about it being a ‘nice gesture from a nice parent?’” Steve glared at him but quickly went back to his sketchbook without saying anything else.
“Ugh, seriously what is your malfunction, are you retarded or something? I get it, you’re Norwegian and the language is too tough for you, but real humans don’t talk like that! You live in America now, speak like an American!” Jane’s face turned red with anger and started to stomp up to him, but Thor grabbed her arm and gently pulled her back.
to be more exciting than summer camp, right? But still… I can’t help but wonder what exactly this mission is about. That Watcher guy didn’t tell us anything about it other than that it’s secret and important, but that could mean anything!” He then shrugged weakly and looked over at Tony, who along with Clint and Thor was inspecting the big hair dryer machine. “Besides, I’m not exactly jumping at the thought of spending my summer this close to Tony Stark.”
"She and I are from entirely different worlds, she can have anything and anyone she wants! And I have nothing and I'll probably not have much in the future either. I have-" Steve cut himself, almost fighting back tears at this point. "I have nothing to offer her. What business do I have around someone like her?"
“I sure hope so, ‘cause if this is just meant for your hair it takes up a whole lot of space for very little meaningful purpose. I mean, I’m all for good-looking hair obviously, but this seems like very big machine for something that you easily fix with a jar of gel and a towel.”
“Yeah, great driving skills you got there, Stark.” She pulled the hair tie out of her hair and let her long red locks fall over her shoulders and back, rolling her eyes as she combed through her hair with her fingers. “Guys behind the wheel…”
“No. Just… please, stay with me Tony. Stay with me.” Tony always nodded into his neck and tightened his hold around his shoulders.
"Of course, I love to help my lovely husband when he needs it."
Tony grumbled and rubbed his eyes before stretching out his arms towards Steve like a child. “Carry me.” He whined, again, very much like a child.
Steve was completely speechless. What? Was this happening? Was she saying yes? Did she want to give him an actual shot at showing how much he liked her? He didn’t find the words, his brain had gone off-line and he couldn’t think of anything good to say.
Tony Stark is a fugly slut
He heard Clint snort somewhere around him. “Looks like you’ve got yourself a new best friend, Cap. Tony might actually have to fight him for your attention.” Steve couldn’t answer; he just laughed and scratched the puppy over the back.
Thor immediately felt the anger brew up and he grabbed the young man by his collar and pressed him up against a locker. “You dare insult the house of Odin? And you dare speak of my brother and people in such vulgar fashion?! I demand you apologize this instant, or I will make you the price!”
She took a deep breath and made her way towards the Starbucks.
Tony looked up from his neck and smiled coyly at him. “Oh, and uh, I may have broken the present rule just a teensy bit.”
“Yeah, you probably have work to do. It’s a real shame nobody asked for your opinion, though.” Tony’s only response was a frustrated grunt and an attempt to kick him in the groin but only got him in the stomach, which thanks to his abs was rock-hard and Steve hardly felt a thing.
Steve smirked and then crouched down a little, one arm around Tony’s shoulders, but when he tried to place his arm around the back of his knees, Tony stepped away and smiled.
Steve blushed a little at the sound and chuckled embarrassedly and Tony laughed at him. "I'll take that as a yes." He gave his husband another squeeze before he made his way towards the fridge. "Bruce made this Indian curry last night, it's to die for. We have plenty of leftovers though, 'cause Thor was called away for something last minute before dinner. You want some?"
Tony stared down at the tablet that forced into his hands the second he’d gotten home, grimacing at the commercial he had just been forced to watch, because what the hell was that? 'A summer of pleasure, amazing fun and playful raccoons', what the fuck kind of slogan was that? And did they think that poor guy running around in that stupid raccoon suit was supposed to make kids jump with joy and beg their parents to please let them go to that camp?
Steve had heard enough. He released Tony’s hand and placed his arms around Tony, pulling him close and held him tightly. Tony buried his face into Steve’s shirt, now sobbing uncontrollably and his arms wrapped around Steve’s stomach, clinging to him like a child and between his shuddering breaths he cried out ‘I’m sorry’ into Steve’s chest, over and over again.
Yes, he realized that this whole thing was not only dangerous and risky as hell, but he was also worried about how little they knew about this mission. No facts or anything, just a simple
Tony was so close to quaking in his boots. He couldn’t help it; Ty had always had that kind of grip over him. No matter how tough he was or tried to act, he could never really stand up to Ty. Hammer, sure! Killian, probably. But not Ty.
Nothing too big had happened so far on either end of their plans, but Tony was sure their big breaks would come soon. And besides, they were still young, not even twenty-five years old yet and had their whole lives ahead of them. They were in no hurry and were not hurting for money at the moment. They had a roof over their heads, food in their bellies and everything they needed until they got there. Not to mention they had each other and were engaged and that was much more than Tony ever could have hoped for when things were at their worst back when they were still in high school. Steve had helped him through some serious shit back then, either by just being a shoulder to lean on, to hold him and comfort him whenever he had drunk too much or had anxiety attacks or to offer him a place of refuge whenever Howard had been especially terrible or even violent with him.
Tony sighed and nuzzled his face into Steve’s shoulder, closing his eyes. “I love you.”
“Oh, what a relief. Now I won’t have to cry myself to sleep at night and worry about you leaving me.” Tony smacked him on the shoulder, prompting Steve to laugh, and then grabbed his arm and led him to the table.
“Tony…” Tony was blinking suddenly, rapidly and several times, and it clicked in Steve’s brain that Tony’s many deep breaths and sudden blinking was him trying his hardest to not start crying. Though it was a rather fruitless attempt, as his eyes looked a little shinier and his voice was shaking a little now.
“-No, I have no intention of- look, it’s none of your goddamn business anymore, you cut me off! And I am
“It’s the future.” He’d told Steve when he explained his vision to him. “Once Stark Solutions gets off the ground and I get the funding I need, believe you me, I will make sure that fossil fuel will be a thing of the past.” And Steve, of course, had been quick to show his full support and hugged and kissed him all while asking if there was anything he could do to help.
Steve just shushed him gently, keeping one arm tightly wrapped around Tony’s shoulders while the other one was stroking his back, doing his best to comfort his distraught husband. But inside, there was a raging battle between his anger and rational thinking. The soldier in him wanted to march right out into the city, find that sleazy scumbag of an ex-boyfriend and beat the shit out of him. It was nothing less than he deserved and nothing could convince Steve otherwise. But the more rational guy in him bashed the soldier part of him over the head and reminded him of his crying, hysterical husband who was begging for forgiveness into his chest, who really needed reassurance and comfort above karmic retribution.
His mother had always adored Tony, ever since she’d first met him when Steve had come running up to her after that first day of kindergarten with a big, happy grin on his face as he introduced his new friend Tony to her and asked if he could come home with him tomorrow. And so when he’d told her that he wanted to ask him to marry him, she’d been over the moon and very quick to give him her ring and tell him to make him happy and treat him well. Which was more a thing of courtesy than anything else, because the idea of hurting Tony in any way made Steve’s skin crawl and feel like he’d been punched in the stomach.
A small hatch opened itself on the podium, revealing six small devices, about an inch long and looking like small USB devices.
The Adonis smiled and then slowly got up on his feet, reaching out his hand for Tony to take and Tony gladly took it and let the Adonis help him stand up. Then he went back to looking kinda sheepish and a little guilty.
Bruce folded his arms over his chest and eyed them carefully. “Yeah, assuming they work. And even if they do, I’d still be calmer calling my dad on Earth and not from some other planet or the other side of the galaxy.” Clint tilted his head at him, eyebrow slightly raised.
He went upstairs to his room afterwards, where Jarvis was just closing his bags and placing them against the wall of his room. He looked up at Tony and smiled softly. "Young sir, I have just finished helping you pack your clothes. I figured I'd let you pack your other things for yourself." His smile turned pityingly. "I assume they have told you the news?"
“Have
“Well it looks like you can sit at this thing, so maybe it has something to do with food?” Bruce looked at Tony, who seemed to looking for any buttons or display like the hair dryer had had. When he didn’t find anything he just shrugged and straightened up again.
She sighed, got off the toilet and carefully got out of the cubicle and shook off the trash and water from her umbrella before drying it off and putting it back in her bag. The fact that the ‘throw-water-and-trash-at-Natasha’ thing had happened so many times over the past year that she had
“Ooh, we’re using surnames now, huh? Gosh Mr. Stark, you sure know how to make a fella feel special.” Steve barely holds back his laugh as he walks up the stairs, not in any hurry at all, and heads towards their bedroom, holding Tony in place over his shoulder with one arm around the back of his knees.
Until now, of course.
“Okay, so I’m not the only one who clearly doesn’t want to be here, eh?” Everyone looked up from what they’re doing, aside from Natasha who probably didn’t hear him, and looked at Clint, who just smirked lightly and rested his arm on top of the seat. “Oh come on, it’s clear no one here is jumping at the idea of going to camp. So who else has been forced to go to camp against their will?”
“I’m serious, Pierce, get lost or you get the taser!” Thor decided that he needed to interfere and moved up to his girlfriend’s side, putting his arm around her.
He was thinking of what to order, about whether he’d rather want pizza or Chinese food tonight, when suddenly his phone started ringing. He looked up and over to the coffee table where he’d placed the phone earlier and just stared at it dumbly for a few long seconds. Who could be calling him at this hour? Most of his friends were probably having dinner right about now too, so it couldn’t be them. Maybe his boss wanted him to cover a shift because of last second changes? Or maybe-
“I didn’t touch anything, I just sat down!” But before anyone could start asking more questions, the covers over the big window started to move and opened up, revealing-
Ty and his little lackeys were staring at her, wide eyes and terrified before slowly moving out the way and mutter apologies as she passed them with a cold glare, her green eyes probably drilling into their very souls. And Tony would probably also having terrified of her if he wasn’t so busy slipping away from Ty and run off down the hallway.
Steve looked down at his husband, then over at his dog, which was now playing with Sam, who had produced a small rubber ball from somewhere and was throwing it around the room for the puppy to chase after. He smiled fondly and kissed Tony on the forehead.
Steve smirked teasingly, but there was something hungry in his gaze, and his hands made their way from around Tony’s waist and down towards his butt, slowly and gently stroking his ass. “Why Mr. Stark, whatever gave you that idea?” But before Tony could respond, Steve had cupped his ass and hoisted him up in his arms, making Tony yelp in surprise, giving him a blinding smile. “I’m just giving my best guy the attention he deserves, that’s all.”
school for ‘assaulting’ other students. The excuse of PTSD only got her so far and couldn’t be used as an excuse for her whole life. It didn’t even really work anymore as it was. It had been more than ten years now and even school psychiatrists and psychologists told her that it shouldn’t bother her as much as it used to when she was younger. And no matter what Phil said, the school refused to cut her any more slack, so if she hurt any of the girls or even tried to fight back, she knew they would go crying to the principal and tell their own version of what happened. And he would believe them and refuse to even listen to her version and she would get kicked out. Again.
Tears were falling from Tony’s eyes by this point and he was just barely holding back his sobs and his smile was so big it physically hurt. He sniffed and tried to snark back at Steve but it didn’t come out quite as snarky as he had wanted and more like a sob.
At least Bruce still looked like he needed time to go from kid to adult with his body too.
like you’re taking this seriously?” Tony glared back at him, putting his hands on his hips.
“Nah man, you’re on your own. Quite frankly you’ve only got yourself to blame here.” Tony narrowed his eyes at their friends and glared at them as they passed them.
“It’s okay. It’s alright, you’re safe. You’re safe now, I’ve got you.”
Bruce sighed again and leaned his forehead against the window, his glasses slipping down his nose slightly.
had just happened? Had she flirted with him? Had
When they met back in kindergarten Tony had been very quiet, pensive and barely talked or made any moves without being asked to and barely even then. Heck, he hardly ever smiled or laughed in a way that didn’t feel forced or held back. Steve had been the one to ask or decide what games they should play for the most part and Tony just sort of went along with it. But with time and as Tony became more comfortable around him and the other kids, he’d slowly but surely started to come out of his shell and became happier, more confidant and started to make more jokes and decisions for himself. And as they made their way through school together Steve felt as though he was allowed to see Tony grow stronger, braver and eventually discover himself and realize what he wanted and who he wanted to be despite how his father wanted him to take over Stark Industries and be exactly like him.
Toni sighed and put her spoon down. "I know. That's what scares me, Jan. I know how to handle guys who want me for my body or my money, but if this guy actually is interested and maybe asks for my number or a date… what do I do?"
“What does this mean? Have we been transported to some sort of space center?” Tony snorted and shrugged his shoulders, never looking away from the window.
“Yeah, thanks for the tip.” Clint rolled his eyes again, only this time no one shushed him or tried to smack him.
. She rolled her eyes and leaned on her hip. “So I take it you’re not too eager to go on adventure either, huh?” Steve pinched his lips and shrugged lightly.
“Wow.” Steve said under his breath as she came up to the counter and sat down beside Bucky, putting her bag down by her feet and resting her arms on the counter.
The arms around his waist tightened even more and he felt Steve rest his head against Tony’s. “Because we’ve known each since grade school, been best friends since for-fucking-ever and have dated since high school? Or maybe because I’ve been there for you at every high and low point in your life and helped you through some real tough points? Or perhaps because of my insanely good looks and unbelievable charm and great humor?”
Holy fuck, she hadn't been on a real date in years and she had very good reasons for not wanting to date and stay away from commitment. With anyone. She couldn't do this; it would only end in tears! She should turn back and say that she just remembered that had a thing tonight and couldn't make it and just never bring up the idea of a date ever again. Maybe he would forget about and they could just stay as good friends and-
"Oh, Toni." Janet reached out and hugged her tightly and Toni was quick to hug back, burying her face in hair chestnut brown hair and fighting her hardest to keep the tears at bay. Janet was her only stable rock since coming to MIT, especially since Rhodey and Carol joined the Air Force and barely had time to see her anymore. And though she had made new friends since coming to Boston, she was so thankful for Janet, for agreeing to moving in together when both of them got accepted to schools in Boston, for being a mood lifter when she needed it and for having been there for her and with her since they were kids.
“Just admiring the view, Hot stuff. Nothing wrong with looking.” And Steve felt he should be offended. He’d said before that he didn’t like women only talking or showing interest in him because of his muscles, but with Toni, it suddenly felt okay. Maybe because she was admitting to it where most girls tried to act like they weren’t. Or maybe because she had complimented his art before shamelessly staring at him. He didn’t know, but he didn’t really care, which felt a little strange.
Adventure? Friends? At a fucking summer camp? Yeah right!
Steve suddenly felt a little unsure what to do next and moved to wipe the counter, despite it already being clean, aside from Bucky having spilled a few drops of coffee when he laughed before. But it was better than just standing awkwardly and stare at her like an idiot. But he could feel her eyes on him and he almost made a bit of a show of himself as he stretched and wiped the counter top in certain places instead of walking across the space.
out of trouble. At least she never mouthed off to people or got violent. At least not too badly.
Tony tried to smirk, but it looked less cocky and confident and more wide and joyous and tearful. “Steve, babe, two things: First, this is not me ‘settling’ for you. I have dated several people before you and no one has ever been as good to me as you. Even Pepper, bless her heart, had a rocky time with all of my broken parts and ugly history. Sure, maybe ten years from now I will be successful and rich and have a big house and ten cars or whatever, but no one in the world could ever be better to me than you.”
“So, what do you guys think this could be? The world’s most advanced hair dryer or something?” Clint snorted and fingered on the bowl-like thing, pushing it back and forth a little.
Rogers.”
“Well I was kinda hoping I could treat
tech, Rogers, but this has got to be sabotage here. This engine doesn’t look like it malfunctioned, it looks like it’s been tampered with.” The driver rolled her eyes and folded her arms over her chest.
Toni chuckled and shook her head, moving to sit cross-legged as she watched her best friend rummage through her closet with an amused quirk on her lips. “I’ll keep that in mind for the future, thanks.” She looked over the mirror and brushed her fingers through her hair. While she wasn’t too dirty or smelly, she should probably shower before she went out tonight. If nothing else to make a good impression on him, and because she had been working in the workshop and still had some engine grease and dirt on her face, hands and under her nails.
Or how Tony Stark, the only kid who was more slut-shamed than her, was a virgin, just like her. Poor guy was probably the most hated guy in school for no good reason other than he was born in a rich and powerful family.
Steve growled as he threw his shirt on the floor, getting ready for his shower. Just thinking of Howard Stark made his blood boil and made him want to punch something or someone. And if he could have his pick, he’d really wish to punch Howard in the face, hard enough to at least break his nose and maybe knock a few teeth out.
ran into them. That had to be some kind of record. But he knew better than to let any of his frustrations or anger show, because that was exactly what they wanted after all. So he plastered on his best ‘PR Smile’ as he had dubbed it and looked Ty right in the eyes.
Ever since Steve had come back from his last tour- and had proposed to him, which
She shook her head and smacked herself on the cheek with her purse.
ask guys out on genuine dates, this is a huge step forward for you!”
Tony Stark is an egocentric narcissist
Jan smiled so widely that her face almost split in two and her eyes sparkled. “Oh my gosh, Toni you asked him out! You! That is so amazing, I’m so proud of you!” She flung herself and Toni and wrapped her arms around her arms around her neck, squeezing tightly. “You
Tony’s mouth was open, eyes wide and started to fill with tears again, but he started to blink, hoping to kill them before they could fall and he chuckled. “Fuck you, Rogers. You’ve made me cry like five times in less than thirty minutes today, you fucking asshole. I should give you the ring right back for making me this emotional today, you know I hate feelings.”
“I’m trying to figure out if this computer can tell us what to do!” Tony glared at him from the middle chair, clutching something that looked like a big joystick.
Tony froze when he picked up the phone and read name on the display.
“I don’t know. But it looked to be connected to that steering thing, so I just… acted.” Tony snorted and Thor came up them, slapping them both hard on their backs, so hard that they almost fell to the ground again.
"What trickery is this?" Thor jerked up from where he sat and gaped around in the room, which made Clint jump a little and he also looked around, both shocked and a little scared.
“Oh come on, he’s a piece of shit anyway, can’t I just punch him? It’s nothing less than he deserves!”
Steve had promised that this would be the last time. “One last tour, Tony. One last tour and then I’m here to stay. I promise, just give me these last 10 months and then I’m all yours. I’ll leave the army forever and we’ll build a life and home together. I give you my word.”
“You mean boring stuff like eating and sleeping?” Tony turned to him and smiled teasingly.
“Nah buddy, I don’t think so. First of all, we’re miles away from the city, which means she’d have to go quite a while to actually get any reception. Second, I could see she didn’t want to deal with this situation at all, or us. I’ll bet you ten bucks that she just wanted to get away from us for a while. She’ll probably not be back for a while.”
“Hi, hi Bubba. Hi Bubba, are you a good boy? Yeah, you’re such a good boy.” The dog barked happily and started circle Steve, almost tripping over its own paws, but the tail was still wagging and it looked like it was smiling widely, the tongue still hanging out of the side of its mouth.
have it outside this sardine can, please?" Tony and Steve immediately started to move out of the car to allow Bruce to get out and the others weren't slow to follow. But the little box they were trapped in wasn’t much better. It was barely big enough to be qualified as a garage and it was only barely big enough to fit them all.

lets you forget it. "-We have decided to let you to a camp this summer! So you can meet other kids your age and have some fun!"
Thor was very easy to like. It seemed everyone on the team seemed to like Thor, almost impossible not to enjoy his company. There was just something in the way he talked and acted, with such a passion and genuine joy that it sometimes left Steve wondering if Thor was a God or a golden retriever that somehow had turned into a human. He was always enthusiastic about learning more about ‘Midgardian culture’ and took genuine interest in everything that he found, from video games to movies to Skype, so he could remain in contact with his ‘ Dearest Lady Jane’ while she was still working in New Mexico. And in all honesty, it felt good that there was someone else on the team who still had things to learn about this world, and not just Steve. It gave him someone to talk to about it and discuss new things with who understood.
is what made everything they’d both been through up until today worth it. All the fights they’d gotten into, all the trouble and low points they’d fought their way out of and all the war he had seen in his tours of combat, it had all been worth it, because at the end of the day, he had Tony there to brighten his day and fill his life with love. Everything that they had been through together had only made their bond stronger and all the storms that they'd weathered made Steve absolutely sure that there was nothing that they couldn't get through as long as they were together. Sure, it was probably not the last time they’d ever hear from Howard Stark or have other troubles come into their lives from nowhere, but Steve knew they would get through it, just like they always had before. Together.
She rolled her eyes. “I didn’t say that. But I am saying that, if we are in space and we choose to stay here, we can’t go back. This won’t be like going to camp, faking illness after a few weeks and being sent home. Besides, we don’t know exactly what we’re getting into here. For all we know we could be asked to join a war of life and death or maybe it’s a trick where we’ll be eaten by a monster if we choose to stay.”
When Janet was done and Toni got a chance to look in the mirror, she was actually kinda surprised by how she looked. Yeah, she was pretty, she already knew that, but even with very little makeup on her and her hair only lightly curled she suddenly looked more… naturally beautiful. Yeah okay, she had makeup on but not much to be super, in your face or even too noticeable, except for the bright red lipstick.
“Oops, sorry Cunt, I didn’t you there. Are you okay?” His voice was very obviously mocking him and his friends laughed even harder. Clint narrowed his eyes at the nickname and the mocking before getting back up on his feet, glaring at Rumlow.
“You know she would never touch your ass in a million years, right? She has hundreds of guys chasing her and that want to be her boyfriend, and you think you have a shot with her? Keep dreaming Rogers, you’re never gonna get with her.” Steve tried to rip himself out of Rumlow’s grip again and almost succeeded at making him loosen his grip, only for him to tightening it again in a split second.
It was Clint who eventually broke the silence.
Steve also grumbled a little as he glared over at Tony. “Yeah, maybe next time you could try to not to get our heads cracked open on the floor?” Tony sneered at her and folded his arms over chest.
Ty smirked at him. “Well, if you’d like me to help you feel better before you leave, you only need to ask.” He leaned in closer to his face, a predatory smirk spreading over whole face. “After all, we all know how much you like it.”
Because wasn't that the clincher? It had taken a few times of talking to her before the penny had finally dropped and he realized that she was a Howard Stark's only child and was not only rich, a genius and powerful but also the heiress to Stark Industries throne.
He heard the others also getting out of the car, chatting amongst themselves and he heard Tony talk a little with the lady about the car, though she did not sound the least bit grateful for his ‘help’. Though in her defense he did sound a bit like a know-it-all, and very few adults that Bruce had met actually liked being shown up by a kid.
“Really? What does he do?” Thor looked over at him, seemingly a bit surprised that he spoke again, and then smiled again.
Howard had blown a gasket over Tony falling for the ‘broke, lowly nobody from Brooklyn’ he had met in grade school and that had been the point where he really wanted to disown him, which he eventually did once Tony went to college, moved into a small apartment with Steve and made it very clear he wasn’t going to do whatever Howard wanted him to do with his life, i.e. take over Stark Industries and make weapons like him. Tony, however, had never let that bother him too much. He was young and in love and who was Howard to tell him to live his life anyway? Steve was the best thing that had ever happened to him and Tony would be the biggest moron on this side of the universe if he ever let him go. Jarvis had told him on the day he had graduated college, after Steve had hugged him and kissed him and told him how proud he was of him, that
Tony looked surprised, a little scared suddenly, but he nodded nevertheless. “More than anything.”
“At least now you’ll smell better.” She heard laughing from other girls, other mindless little cheerleaders that followed Sharon everywhere like lambs, before they left the room and slammed the door behind them.
“Yeah, what if something happens? You’re the adult!” She rolled her eyes and started to walk down the road the way they came from.
“Fuck off, Barton.” Then he got off Steve’s lap. “Okay, I’m gonna go get the gift, but first you have to close your eyes.” And, okay, that was a little weird. So, if he had to close his eyes Tony probably hadn’t wrapped it. And if he hadn’t wrapped it, what could he have planned this time?
He pressed another kiss to Steve’s throat. “I’ll be happy. I will always be happy with you.” And goddamn if that didn’t make Steve’s eyes water and he hugged Tony tighter and pressed a long, lingering kiss to his head.
I hope you’ll like it!
“You won’t have to many open spaces in space, you know. Your claustrophobia won’t like this cramped ship, right?” Bruce bit his lip and eyed the red button, but then Clint ran up and grabbed his shoulder.
Tony was nodding with happy tears running down his face, saying “Yes, yes, yes!” over and over again before running up to Steve and throwing himself around his neck again. Steve wrapped his arms tightly around Tony before lifting him off his feet again and spinning him around. He heard cheers and applause around them, but paid them no heed; the only thing going through his head at the moment was
Steve smiled and shrugged off his leather jacket, handing it to Tony. “Here, take this. I know it’s not exactly warm, but it might help a little.” Tony looked at him with narrowed eyes, then back at the rain and then back at Steve. He groaned and took the jacket, putting it on without looking away from Steve, his glare never wavering.
But before he fell asleep, he found himself chuckling slightly.
“I have a little surprise for you.”
And finally there was a small smile forming on Tony’s face and he rested his head on Steve’s shoulder, pressing a kiss to the crook of his neck. “I love you.”
birthday. Which of course would be a big deal no matter what he said or did, because becoming 100 years old and not be a frail, weak and wrinkly old man was quite a feat. And so he resigned himself to his fate that Tony would go out of his way to get him some kind of extravagant gift and maybe even discard the rule entirely in order to spoil him.
“Um, yeah, to class.” Blonsky smirked and shook his head before reaching out his hand towards Bruce, as if he was expecting him to give him something.
"So… then, would you-" Toni leaned in a little closer, waiting for him to just ask her already before her scared, lizard brain would catch up with her and make her run away from him before he could say it.
The only one who had any real reason to be at those galas or events would be Steve. As Tony’s husband, it only made sense that he would accompany him to these things, to support him and help promote good press for the company. And while Steve had made no secret to either Tony or Pepper that he hated dressing up and entertaining these kinds of people- reminded him way too much of time promoting war bonds with the USO- he would gladly put up with it to support his husband and to just see how happy Tony got when got to talk about his projects to the world. Steve had told Tony over and over that he hated his PR smile, but he loved it when Tony could just talk about his work, because that passion always managed to shine through and it was a joy to see, even if he was forced to suffer through stiff greetings and small talk with people he couldn’t bother remembering the names or after they left for the night and to wear those tight, uncomfortable suits. All to make Tony happy and to see that bright smile when he took the stage and talked about the things he really cared about.
He got up from the bed and gathered up his small toolbox and his smaller projects, shoving them into a small duffle bag. If he had to be stuck at that fucking camp, might as well bring some things he could work on while trying to hide from the 'playful raccoons' and the 'amazing fun' that they promised.
Yeah, Tony was okay. Maybe even a bit better than okay.
going to beg for forgiveness for shit I didn’t do-“ He cut himself off and Steve stopped in the doorway, just out of sight so he could verify who the caller was. Although he had a very strong feeling he already knew who it was.
Really, all of them had come to care quite a bit about the genius, as annoying and frustrating as he could be Tony had proven to be very easy to like, once you got past the mile high concrete walls and defenses the genius had built around himself and his heart. And once you got used to his more annoying quirks, like his rambling, his habit of getting too far into people’s personal space, or his habit of working too hard, too long and being too stubborn to accept that he might need a break every once in a while. Like to eat and sleep.
“What did you do?!” Bruce came running up to him and Tony raised his hands defensively while shaking his head furiously.
“You’re trash!” Sharon yelled and Natasha heard the water get turned off and then she heard the scraping of a plastic bag being dragged across the floor. She knew what was coming, because it always did. She reached for backpack, pulled out her umbrella and opened it just in time for a big pile of trash and water hit her from above, the smell of garbage, old food and used tampons and sanitary pads attacking her nostrils along with dirty sink water.
Steve smiled and his eyes softened, placing both hands on Tony’s shoulders and looked him straight in the eyes, his eyes are full of sincerity and love. “Tony, you shouldn’t think about Howard and what he’ll think. I have never cared about his opinion; I hate him just as much as he hates me. But I love you and I want you, and if that means I have to deal with him as my father-in-law and him being a dick about it, I’ll gladly deal with that.” He lifted one hand and stroke it over Tony’s cheek. “I love you enough to handle anything. I’ve seen war at this point, I doubt there’s anything Howard Stark can say or do to keep us apart or make me stop loving you.”
“What homework?” Ross narrowed his eyes at him and turned towards him, while still blocking his way. He was also much taller than him bigger with more muscle mass than him.
Tony was vaguely aware of gasps of shock and anticipation from the crowd of people around them but he was stuck staring at Steve with wide eyes and his jaw hanging open, his hands flying up to cover his wide open mouth. Steve took out a small, black box from his pocket, popped it open and revealed a ring. It was fairly modest ring, nothing too extravagant or fancy, just simple golden band and a small diamond at the center.
He was finally home.
“That’s probably the most polite way I’ve ever heard that phrase being said before, Thor. I think you and I are gonna get along great if we end up actually going on this mission.” Tony managed to say between his laughter and Clint nodded on the verge of choking on his laughter. Thor looked very pleased with the reaction he’d gotten from his little joke, but then looked away from them and smiled at Bruce as he came up to them.
at flirting or even
Steve smiled affectionately, placed his arm around Tony and rested his head against Tony’s. “And I love you too, sweetheart. And no Tiberius Stone can ever change that, I hope you realize that.” Tony huffed a very small laugh but nuzzled his face further into his shoulder and neck and wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, holding him tight.
Clint always loved watching Natasha do these things, ‘cause it looked so funny. Like, Natasha wasn’t that tall or muscular, maybe 5 foot 7 inches and 130 pounds, and Rumlow both taller and heavier than her. And yet he looked at her and looked absolutely terrified.
She looked at him with a soft smile and a few tears in her face. “What if I would like that? What if I like that ‘scrappy kid from Brooklyn?’ What if I want to be more than friends?” She took the hand she was still holding and clutched it in both hands. “What if I would like to give him a chance to sweep me off my feet?”
Tony wanted to say, but he couldn’t get the words out. His tongue was frozen in his mouth and he couldn’t get it to work for him.
“Indeed, a mighty beast worthy of the great Captain.” Thor rumbled from his spot by the couch, having taken a small break in the video game playing to take a look at the newest family member. Natasha didn’t say much, but she smiled wryly at the dog and Steve and Tony before she went back to her nails. Sam came up to them, knelt down beside the dog and started to pet him and scratch him behind the ears.
“What kind of weapons would be tested out in the woods this close to a road where cars drive?!” Tony glared at him and Bruce snapped out his own panic and stress and screamed loudly into his face, both to be heard and also to be stop the fighting.
“Traitors.” Natasha and Clint just laughed and Natasha called out to Steve
Steve blushed and nodded, a bit embarrassed. “Uh, yeah but that’s just… I mean, I wasn’t really-“ Bucky looked up from his laptop and leaned over her shoulder to get a look at the napkin. He smirked a little and leaned sat back properly in his seat.
Steve looked after her as she left the room and then back down at his bags and sighed heavily. Oh well, he was almost done now anyway so he might as well finish packing the stupid bags and prepare for being driven to that stupid camp in that stupid taxi that would come tomorrow. And sure, it might be a torturous summer but his mom was right about one thing.
“Whoa, watch out guys, it looks like Rogers is a little peeved.” Steve clenched his fists and looked very angry and like he was fighting very hard not to punch something. Or someone.
Steve was walking around the car in circles before he started to walk over to the side of the car, leaned back against it and sighed, either out of frustration or tiredness, and tilted his head towards the sun. Thor and Clint had started to throw rocks at certain targets, Thor getting both very impressed and annoyed that Clint kept beating him and Natasha was fiddling with her phone, before placing it to her ear, held it there for a few seconds before groaning and putting it down again.
“Why the fuck do you even care? You haven’t called me or tried to make any contact since I left for college! You know, when you disowned me! And even if you hadn’t, last I checked, I am an adult! So my life is none of your fucking business and you don’t get a say in anything I do anymore! So
He looked up at his mother, who was standing beside him with a wide and simpering smile on her face. That honestly made it worse, because it made him feel like she thought he was five years old again and not sixteen, and that he still loved to run around and play with his toys in the garden. His father also stood close by, but at least he wasn't even trying to look like he thought Tony would like it.
Tony smiled at him and leaned his head on Steve’s arm. “I’m starving. I didn’t have a big lunch today.” Steve shook his head disapprovingly and scowled at him.
“You’re here. You’re home. Oh my god, Steve, I’ve missed you so much!” Tony could barely speak through the tears and sobs, but he managed to rein them in enough to be at least somewhat understood while still crying. Though, given how Steve was shaking about as much as Tony was at the moment, he probably couldn’t talk much more than Tony at the moment.
“Nice moves, Barton!” Bruce leaned most of his weight on the control panel, looking with wide-open eyes and his glasses hanging from one ear.
“It was a steal, really.” Tony had shrugged when he showed the receipt when Steve had questioned him. “I don’t think they realized how much they could’ve charged for it all.”
“Nice moves, Stark!” Clint raised his hand for Tony to smack, which Tony quickly responded with a hard smack.
“Oh really, do tell Mr. Whiz Kid, how do you figure that?” Tony grimaced at the engine seemed to jerk something loose.
"That's only because you don't try, Steve. You don't reach out and try to make friends, you just sit there with your sketchbooks when you don't play football, which is strange considering how nice and friendly you are."
“Look, whatever is going on out there, I don’t think it’s smart to be out there while it’s happening! It’s probably smarter to stay in here until it’s over!” Clint just smirked over at her, even if it was very strained now with worry and fear.
“Hey, it’s cool. I’m alright, no harm done. And I would say it wasn’t so terrible, ‘cause now I’m talking to you, Handsome.”
Tony Stark is a know-it-all son of a bitch
Or how Johann Schmidt ran a small club in school he claimed to be about history, but was really about benefits and greatness of National Socialism and Nazism, which the school didn’t know about and if they did would probably get him kicked out in seconds.
Janet hugged her tightly and stroke her hair gently. “Aw, Toni… of course he will. You’re the best friend anyone could ask for, you’re smart, brave, loyal, generous and funny and any guy in the world would be fucking lucky to have you. And if Steve doesn’t see that then I say fuck him, that’s his loss. But you deserve the best guy Toni. You deserve to find the best guy ever who’ll treat you right and like the queen you are.”
to really, my mother really wanted me to get to know some new friends. But I was going to go with my best friend so I thought it’d be somewhat bearable. But then he called me yesterday and told me that he had caught the flu and couldn’t come, so I had to go alone.”
The first few days had been torture and had spent a lot of time in bed, on the couch watching TV or sleeping through his classes at MIT. But eventually he’d been forced to get off his ass and get his life back on track. He went to his classes, got his second PhD at MIT and started to work on getting a third one while also working his part-time job as a car mechanic. He hung out with his friends one occasion, as they graduated all college and started to live their own busy adult lives. He hung out with Rhodey and helped him pick out an engagement ring for Carol and eventually try to propose (she totally beat him to it!), he, Clint, Rhodey, Sam and Thor had their Guys’ Night once a week, either getting drinks at a bar or went bowling or whatever and he bonded with Natasha over having your boyfriend overseas while they were stuck at home not knowing what was happening to their significant other. Though Tony couldn’t help but feel jealous of her, since Bucky was still home had already left the army on account of his amputated arm from his last tour.
Steve smirked from where he was standing, arms folded and leaning against the car. “Your daddy’s tech not good enough anymore?” Tony glared at him and tried again a few times before giving up and turning back to the engine.
“You’re my sister, Toni. I’ll always be in your corner, just like you’ve been in mine.” She squeezed her hand again and then sat back up again. “So, where will you go?” Toni shrugged and grabbed a pillow and hugged it to her chest while also fiddling with the seams on the pillowcase.
Tony smiled and had to clear his throat so his sobs wouldn’t make his voice crack. He stroked one hand over Steve’s bearded cheek. “So what kind of idiot would I be to let go of the best thing that ever happened to me?”
“No, no of course it’s up to you who you want to date or be friends with Toni, I am absolutely not trying to take that away from you. It’s your choice and no one else’s, but…” He trailed off and sighed. “I just… didn’t think you’d ever think want to date someone… someone like me. I don’t have much, I mean I barely get by as it is, but…”
“Uh, yeah, I’m okay. I just… I don’t really like tight spaces is all, I needed to breathe a little.”
"Hey Jan, you busy? Um, well you see I… uh, I kinda have a date tonight. I might need a little advice."
So yeah, Steve had really fallen for her. But he couldn’t tell if Toni was feeling the same way, because she- as he had learned quickly- flirted with a lot of people. Sure, she could flirt with him for hours and give him cute nicknames or say suggestive things to him, but he had no idea if she did that to other guys.
He had dated other people before Steve, of course he had, but no one had ever been like Steve. Steve, who was loving, caring and kind and the sweetest and most amazing man on the planet. Steve, who was honest and sincere, utterly devoted to Tony and making sure he was happy, either by making him coffee every morning before he went to class or making sure he ate and slept somewhat regularly. Steve, who told Tony he loved him every single day and kissed him good morning and good night.
“Oh Jesus, Steve you really gotta work on your flirting.” The Adonis- or Steve- blushed even more and glared over at his friend, but Tony just smirked and took a step forward as well, shrugging off his wet, thin jacket, showing off his own well-defined arms and tan. And his smirk widened slightly when he saw how Steve’s gaze was suddenly drawn away from the best friend and was now directed at his body. Though the blush was still there.
and abs that she could
So apparently I lied before. I said this chapter was going to be the first date, but then this chapter became so long that I decided to keep it as its separate chapter and have the first date be the next one. Just so it wouldn’t be so freaking long!
“Nah, I just like walking into coffee shops and sit down by the counter just because.” Her smirk widened. “I’m kinda quirky like that.”
They’d probably stop by the pizza place on the way home, or they’d order for delivery when they got home. They’d pick a movie to watch while eating but eventually start to pay more attention to each other than the movie. Steve would pull him close and hold him throughout the whole night, even when they would need to go to bed. Tony would cling onto Steve too, making sure to himself that he was actually home and this wasn’t some kind of dream. He’d probably finger on the engagement ring on his finger to make sure that was real too, because it still felt like a dream.
“You should go to bed, honey. You’re tired and I won’t have you go back down into your workshop and work yourself into the ground again.”
“Well… I mean, I certainly didn’t ask to go here, but my dad probably just wanted me to go and have some friends aside from school or whatever. And we don’t have a lot of money so I didn’t really have the heart to say no, so… here I am.” Tony snorted and shook his head at him.
Not that they ever said anything to her face, even Sharon and her posse always made sure to have a door or a wall between them or that they were standing with enough distance between them so she couldn’t do anything about it other than ‘overhear it’. But she knew, she always knew. Clint could make all the Mean Girls jokes he wanted about her hair being big and full of secrets, but the truth was that she was good at figuring things out about people. She had good eyes and ears and so she learned all lot of things about people that they more than likely wouldn’t like to have revealed.
“Well, it sure ain’t Camp Delight, that’s for sure.” Clint laughed weakly at the comment, but suddenly looked a little pale.
Tony came running up to him a few seconds later, soaking wet with his normally well styled, coiffed hair hanging in wet strands in his face and the jacket Steve had lent him dripping with water. He glared half-heartedly at him and flicked some of the rainwater into Steve’s eyes.
“Feeling sappy today, are we Rogers? Well, I appreciate it.” He got onto his toes and pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “Thank you, honey. This was perfect, just what I needed.”
"Well, I wouldn't say that Tony. You are a very good boy, with wit and charm and humor. I'm sure you can make some friends at the camp. And who knows, maybe you'll have some adventures there too." Tony looked up just in time to see Jarvis wink mischievously before leaving the room. Tony stared after him before rolling his eyes and sitting up, leaning back against the headboard.
Thor tried to take a few deep breaths to calm his anger. It would do him no good to loose his composure and hit Loki; it would only make his father even angrier. Maybe he would even be forced to leave his phone in the house, or maybe take away his money or something equally terrible.
Clint grinned as the bell
? And
“Yeah…” Then he looked over at Bruce. “What do you think Bruce? You have to see how this could be really dangerous, right?” Bruce drew back a little when he was spoken too and immediately tried to make himself look smaller, just like he always did. He took a deep breath and tried to make sense of his thoughts.
So they had to dump him somewhere, and of course it had to be in a fucking summer camp for babies.
“Yeah and we could drown in a lake at summer camp, what’s your point?” Steve narrowed his eyes at Clint and took a step forward, straightening his back and towering over him.
He smiled and slowly retracted his hand as she let go of his, taking her latte and taking a sip from it. She hummed approvingly and when she lowered the cup she had a latte foam mustache on her upper lip. Steve snorted a little at the sight and she smirked at him before licking it away and taking a bite from her croissant.
Tony sniffed and nuzzled his face into Steve’s shirt, wiping tears and snot on the fabric and finding himself unable to care in the slightest. “I’m not letting you leave again. You’re not gonna go anywhere near that shit again, you’re gonna stay right here with me forever from now on, do you hear me? That’s not a suggestion, it’s an order Soldier.”
“Oi! Hands off the merchandise, you cretin! You’re messing it up!” But he kept smiling very widely and that mischievous spark in his eyes was still apparent so Steve wasn’t too concerned about Tony being too mad about his hair or the roughhousing. So he just smirked back and ruffled Tony’s hair more thoroughly for good measure, ignoring Tony’s outraged squawk.
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Ooh, a surprise? Aw babe, you didn’t have to.” Steve just smiled, gently let go of him, but he kept an arm around Tony’s waist, and started to lead him into the kitchen.
“Don’t mind if I do, babe.”
Steve scowled lightly at him, took a deep breath and closed his eyes before walking up to the podium. “Well, I can’t say that going on an adventure like this this isn’t enticing or anything, but I still think the risk is too big considering the unknown variables. So, I say no.” And he pressed the red button, which lit up and made a loud buzzing noise. He stepped back and Clint took his place, also he with a grin on his face.
happening. I’m waiting right here until the rain has stopped.”
And truth be told, Tony was the only person- except Natasha
“I’m happy with you too, Tony. And I always will be. And I’m so happy that you want to spend your life with me and that you still love me after all these years.” He gently pushed Tony away and brushed his hair out of his face, stroking his fingers over his cheek. “You’re the love of my life Tony. You always have been and you always will be. And no Howard Stark or other assholes will ever change that or make me go away. What we have is always going to be worth fighting for and I will never, ever, leave you or go away because some asshole says so or disapproves of us. Our bond is too strong to break over something like that.” He leaned forward, kissing his forehead, nose and cheek. “I promise.”
The voice was calm and collected, though there was a subtle undertone of fear in there too. He felt himself being pulled in one direction; one of the arms that held him let go of him while the other one held him steady. Tony started to relax and had stopped kicking and flailing, though he was still blinded and his eyes stung. And he jumped slightly when he felt his savior grab him in a rougher kind of bridal carry, but he barely had time to react before the guy heaved him up and onto the dock again.
“Well no, not that often. I guess you’re just special.”
Janet had come running out of class the second it was over and practically dragged Toni back to their apartment, sat her down on her bed and squeeing at her to tell her everything. And if Toni wasn't so used to Janet and her tendency to be a bit much at times, or her talking a mile a minute or sometimes acting like a child in a woman's body (not that she had any room to complain about any of those things) she probably wouldn't have been so comfortable just sitting back against the headboard of the bed and start telling her about how she had gone to Steve's Starbucks to get a coffee and walked away with a date.
He trailed off, biting his lip and closed his eyes, taking a few breaths through his nose, held them for a second before letting out through his mouth. Steve didn’t push him, just waited for Tony to pull himself together enough to continue. Eventually he opened his eyes again, but still refused to look at Steve.
Clint looked after him, then at the others, shrugged and smirked at them. “Yeah, I’m gonna go with him. And he’s right.” He eyed Natasha and Steve with a dry look on his face. “If you killjoys want to stand here and take the fun out of everything, then feel free to.” He then turned and hurried after Tony. “Hey Stark, wait for me! Don’t find anything fun without me!”
Tony sighed for the umpteenth time in the last fifteen minutes and looked down at his watch again. 17:48. A minute had passed since the last time he looked at it. He sighed again and took a sip of his coffee. It was his third cup of coffee and the barista had looked at him a little funny when he had come back for the third time for another one, but Tony just couldn’t bring himself to care. He’d been waiting for hours now and the coffee help his worry, if only a little.
