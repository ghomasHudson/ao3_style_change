Like a moth to the flame, Tony wrapped his fist around Steve’s thick cock and immediately began stroking him from root to tip, wetting his palm with Steve’s precome to help lubricate his touch.
“You might think it’s funny, but a hero who is openly bisexual? Or gay?” Tony started to say, but Steve shook his head and interrupted.
Steve pressed his thumbs into Tony’s ass to stretched his fingered hole wider still. After the recent concentrated baiting of a prostate orgasm he’d been denied, Tony still saw the world through a haze of impatience and lust, but none of it seemed to matter to Steve. Tony held his breath and watched the uncharacteristic, single-minded hunger in Steve’s eyes—not for Tony, as it almost always was, or for Steve’s own pleasure, but for Tony’s ass.
Steve night as well have accused him of high treason. “Proposing?” he coughed up as his uncomfortable surprise grew into nervous laughter. “Steve, you know as well as I do what it takes to be success in politics. I need a good wife, I need to grow up.”
“I’ll be right outside,” he promised the table, “just, calling, calling Tony—nobody eat my fries,” he remembered to warn them before running away as calmly as he could.
Tony could have written odes to the power and grace Steve exuded with every flip and twist. How a man that large made such a minimal splash baffled Tony, in part because he refused to look. He knew all too well how fast a body with Steve’s mass leaping from that height moved, and it physically hurt to watch in that crucial, final moment.
An arm slipped under and around Tony’s head, tenderly cradling his neck and cheek on Steve’s firm biceps as if in apology. Gently, Steve turned Tony’s head back so he could mouth at his lips, sucking and nipping at Tony’s bottom lip and his jawline with poorly restrained passion, as if Steve wanted to give Tony the chance to catch his breath, but he was unable to live a moment without the soft whimpers and moans that every bite and bruise from his lips inspired.
“Or else? That’s some weak shit,” Brock said with a slow shake of his head, but as he looked them all in the eye, one after another, his smug smile turned darker and more maliciously gleeful.
“Steve, you just—” Tony pinched his lips together, trying to find the words. “It won’t feel as good, so soon after an, uh. You’ll be sensitive, sore—”
“Just doing my job, Nick,” Steve said with a pleased grin. “This isn’t about my second raise, is it?”
Steve pressed a soft kiss over his chest, then pushed himself up on an elbow to meet Tony’s eyes again. “What if I want to suck your dick, Tony? Eat your ass out?” he asked, speaking slowly and clearly and without breaking eye contact. “What if I want to fuck you? Give you a reason to remember our date on Monday.”
“Park it in the ditch,” Tony suggested, pointing to a clear spot behind them. “Just tuck the back half in, and turn the wheel out.”
“I finished a while ago,” Steve said with a smile, albeit a little distracted. He glanced back over his shoulder in the direction of the sitting room, mulling over his question. “I saw some pictures, over the fireplace.”
Steve set his jaw in his rage, but did as he was told. “You’re not doing yourself any favors, you know,” he told Pierce in a icy whisper, “if you don’t tell me, I can’t help you. And trust me, he will come for you.”
A little collective of third-graders came charging around the corner and ran straight for their teacher, crowding around his legs and beaming with such excitement that they were fit to burst at the seams.
Steve still hadn’t replied to his earlier message, so once he’d scrolled through the paused video and taken a screencap in a position that he liked, he decided to keep the photo for later. It was Steve’s turn to stew. Tony was passing up a quick shower to take a bath instead, and if that meant that Steve’s replies would go unanswered for the next hour or so, then so be it.
A rumble rose from somewhere deep in the woods, and all around them, the towering evergreens trembled and shook as a out of the mist rose an immense and mighty dragon that was so big that Clint had to turn his head to see the full span of her leathery black wings. Not that he could really pay attention to anything but her gleaming red claws, all of which were easily taller than he was long.
Without thinking, Tony snatched up a wrench and threw it after his retreating friend, who had enough sense to duck even when giggling like a wayward child.
Tony mewled helplessly, when in one continuous motion, Steve pulled out, flipped Tony onto his belly, and fucked into him again. They weren’t the shallow rolls of Steve’s hips from before, but slow, full-length thrusts that bled the tension from Tony’s muscles and warmed his body with the promise of euphoria that Tony almost didn’t feel the smooth, blunt object pressing against the stretched rim of his ass where it strained to accommodate the girth of Steve’s thick cock.
stress out,” Tony muttered. “Steve, it’s already late. One night of sleep before the Challenge won’t cut it, come on, you know that. What do you have left to work on?”
When Steve’s hands skimmed over Tony’s hips and slipped into his briefs to cup gluttonous handfuls of his ass, Tony arched up into his touch. It took a moment to realize Steve had more in mind than self-indulgent groping. Without hesitation, Tony draped his arms across Steve’s shoulders to help Steve lift, pressing himself against Steve’s body until Steve could push the briefs down and out of the way.
Tony nodded slowly as he tried to understand what Steve meant. “Does that make you feel alone, Steve Rogers?” he wondered. “Would it help if I stayed with you?”
“What!” Arlene cried from her spot at Steve’s side. She looked up at Tony with the pain of betrayal clear in her eyes, and Steve found he couldn’t blame her. “Really, Mr. Tony?”
Before their lips could touch, Tony slipped away and glared at his charge. “You are more savage than I ever imagined, Steven G. Rogers. I wish you to leave my domicile at once. Your place of residence has been arranged four doors to the right. I trust you can find it without my assistance.”
Tony’s smile only drew wider as he listened to Steve share what he’d observed in California over the past week. “Are any of them ready for people to move into?”
This time, Steve smiled a little more easily. “Then, how about one more?” he asked in a lowered voice, and Tony squeezed his hand in excitement. “Tomorrow?”
The woman didn’t miss a beat. She politely asked him to hold, and returned a moment later to connect the call.
“It’s cheaper than therapy.” Steve started to say, but their burgers were brought out in time to interrupt him. “And food, of course.”
The Feds had arrived. Steve and Bucky exchanged looks and sat down - Bucky in his chair while Steve leaned back against desk - to watch the spectacle.
“It’s okay, Tony, security is on its way,” Steve rushed to assure him before Tony called the cops or something, but Tony was absolutely frozen.
“Interesting friends you got there,” Tony told Steve with a look that left Steve dying to know what those two had said. Before he could ask, however, Tony turned his attention to Bucky.
“A, no,” Steve replied, and finally he looked Tony’s way. Tony was still staring at him, unblinking with his lips slightly parted as if he had forgotten how to maintain his listening face. “A relationship.”
from the Savoy-Carignano family. For the crown prince, it was love at first sight, but h is reputation and intelligence preceded him. Even at sixteen the Marchesa knew to avoid a man who spilled rumors of infidelity in every city he visited. And to be the queen of a poor mining country seemed less enticing than a future as a duchess or dame in a more advanced country, such as England or Denmark.
“So it turned me into Betsy Ross,” Steve interjected as Tony tried to explain the detailed selection criteria. “What did the program do to do Rumlow? He’s stronger than I remember, and he’s accessing computers and machines and finding his way around this place.”
Before Tony could answer, Natasha had smacked Bucky on the back and hissed a warning under her breath. It was enough for them all to brace themselves when large chunks of concrete and stones were hurled at them from above. The stones had not been aimed at any in the party, but cracked into plank boards the small band of Scraps stood on, rattling the floor and their nerves.
Steve grinned up at him, reaching to pull him closer. Tony followed the tug of his hand easily, sliding into place against Steve’s body.
“There isn’t much to tell,” Steve said with a shrug. “I don’t have any parents. I was a ward of the state until I turned 18. I moved to New York for my education, and I’ve never wanted to leave.”
It only took Steve a minute to catch up with Tony in the kitchen, but Tony had already pulled out both pans, and he was in the process of tipping the bowl of frosting over the first when Steve saw him.
“So long as you know I’m marrying you for you,” he said quietly, in the end. “That’s a lot of pressure you put on yourself, Steve. You didn’t have to buy us a house, my answer would’ve been the same if you’d asked me empty-handed.”
“I can see that,” Jimmy admitted, “the only difference is at the end of the day you get to go home to Tony Stark and they don’t.”
Carter was standing behind her desk waiting for them when they walked in. “Rogers, any updates? We could use some good news.”
Steve’s heart ached to see his husband so pale. He reminded himself that it wasn’t unnatural to get sick; everyone caught a cold or the flu at some point. It was nothing to be so worried about. But all Steve could think about was how he’d never seen Tony’s lips so chapped and so nearly white.
“Shh! Listen to me: if I die tonight, I’ve left you instructions. They’re in my journal, it’s in the office on top of my laptop.”
“Is there anything on here that isn’t an animal?” Tony wondered, turning the menu over to see if he’d missed anything.
“We are in agreement,” Thor boomed, presumably speaking to Steve, or to Bucky. It wasn’t clear. “Dumping was unreasonable and unexpected. Stark must answer for his behavior.”
Barton scoffed and shook his head with a smirk. “It’s gotta be tough being you and having all the answers to the universe, Stark.”
Tony whispered something in the affirmative, nuzzling Steve’s hair affectionately before pressing a soft kiss to his forehead. Steve shifted against him, then settled with a content sigh, and in that moment, it occured to Tony that in some twisted way, this was maybe the first sincere interaction they had had since they met.
“Uhh, well. None of it feels real yet,” Steve said after a brief pause, quickly clearing his throat. “There’s been talk about a nomination since
On the rare occasion that they ate outside of the palace, Pepper usually arranged for them to have two hours of absolute privacy by vacating a part of the restaurant in advance. When Tony was informed that their upcoming date would be such an event - and that the planning had happened without his awareness - he didn’t know what to think. For one fleeting heartbeat Tony feared that his abduction had left Steve shaken and afraid of returning to the palace, but it was such an absurd concept. Steve had experienced years of guerrilla warfare and witnessed horrific crimes against humanity before he reached the age of majority. There was no threat to a man like Steve in Machtberg, and to think he would avoid a place out of fear was a laughable insult.
“Now who’s making decisions for whom!” Tony cried with mock outrage, and Steve gave him an unimpressed look. Tony mirrored it back at him, and tugged on Steve’s t-shirt. “Is that why you’re mysteriously overdressed for bed? Show me.”
“Hm?” Steve grunted, his brow creased an uncertain frown of sleepy confusion. Tony couldn’t tell if he was struggling with the question, or struggling with being pulled into a conversation on the cusp of sleep.
“If we go any farther East, we will fall off the edge of the earth and there will be no-one to tell,” Tony groused in reply, adjusting his seat on Clint’s bony back for the hundredth time. He had never ridden a donkey before, and he never wanted to again; apparently, he still had more to learn about the downsides of being born male.
Tony was waiting for him when the chopper finally landed outside of Lumine. His flight suit was still recognizable, covered in soot and mud as it was, and Steve flew to him of his own volition the second his feet touched solid ground. In an unusual public display of affection, Steve hauled his husband into his arms. The King was already a large man, but in his husband’s presence he seemed to grow larger than life, enveloping Tony in his arms and hiding him against his heart where he would be safe from all the dangers of the world, one hand gripping the back of Tony’s grimy uniform while he cradled the back of Tony’s head with the other.
Unlike Steve, Bucky seemed unbothered by the idea of mortality - he simply shrugged in acceptance and tossed the file onto the nearest counter. Steve chose to think that maybe Bucky had realized it on his own, because the alternative (imagining Bucky had no reason to agonize over his immortality, no friends or connections he dreaded leaving behind) wasn’t something he could stomach.
On the screen, Steve watched as Tony clapped his hands over his face in an instinctive reaction to a sudden, genuine fit of laughter.
The news anchor interrupted the footage to introduce an audio recording of the king’s address to the royal guard. They called it his final speech.
“Associate Bob Sitwell, we have an appointment with our esteemed Governor this morning,” Tony said before Steve said anything inappropriate. “Please take us to his office.”
“Steve Rogers, I have never known a strength as gentle as yours, or a heart so kind. I love you, Steve,” Tony told him, doing his best to give every word its due time even as he hurried to finish before Pepper was alerted. “When I dare visit the truth, I dread any future without you beside me. Others pale in comparison to you, your unwavering commitment and morality, and this—this hypothetical we can bring to life, I think it is possible. For ourselves and for our people, my love, let us try. Will you marry me?”
“You’ll probably find a better place if you’re not hurrying, too,” Tony said in agreement, “sometimes it’s worth waiting to find the right place. It’s your home, it should be the right one.”
“You’re—where are you going?” he whispered anxiously, wringing the quilt in a white-knuckle grip. “Tony, don’t leave me here.”
“You've got a conference call in thirty,” she reminded him as he accepted the latte she held out for him, knowing better than to waste time with pleasantries. “There is a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign. He says it is imperative that you—”
The elevator doors pinged open on the twelfth floor unnoticed. Santa himself could have entered the precinct to rub his existence in everybody’s noses and not a single detective would have seen him coming. Some detectives were occupied with interrogations and a handful of others divided their attention between their phones and taking notes, while most were on the move. It was nearly five o’clock, and they had places to go and paperwork to file before admins left for the day.
Steve considered his question as he pumped two slick fingers deep into Tony’s body, massaging his prostate and scissoring him open. Tony arched into the touch and keened with pleasure, beautiful and responsive as always.
Smiling and crying in his shock of gleeful excitement, Tony pulled back to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck, keeping him captive for kiss after breathless kiss until Steve had no doubt of his answer.
“With my moms, Your Highness,” Taobe whispered when Steve was closer to his height, keeping his voice low like he was imparting a secret that he couldn’t tell fast enough. “My dad—well, I don’t remember him, sir, but I never needed a dad because my ma’s done his job, too. But I was eight when you married King Anthony, Your Highness. I never knew… back then, I didn’t know that that happened, so I asked my ma and she, she was so happy she cried, and said she was like you, then, and a year after that, Mariana found us, and, and you didn’t know it,” he finished with uncomfortable, furtive looks at the tall men standing behind Steve, “but I don’t think ma and I would have Marimama without you. Sir. Your Highness, sir. And so I always told myself that if I ever met you that I had to thank you for… for making it something normal everyone knows about. For making my ma feel less alone.”
“Feel worse,” he groaned in reply, shuffling forward then and pushing on Steve’s chest to invite himself into Steve’s suite. “Need your help, Steve, back’s totally messed up.”
Carol took the bar seat next to him, but Steve didn’t look up from his drink. She sat where Tony had sat over a year ago when they had first met, when they had first gotten to know each other. It had all been so curious and exciting and simple, then.
“He opened the package and found them, yes,” Steve replied, and found some gratification in spying a glimpse of anger on Tony’s face.
From out of the pitch black phone shone a brilliant, blue light Steve recognized in a heartbeat. Instinctively, Steve rushed to cup his hands around the phone to shield it from curious eyes that would inevitably notice such a bright spark in the cozy, romantic restaurant.
Between the pain, his difficulty breathing, the chaos milling around him, and the crippling fear of what 006 could do to Steve, Tony spiraled. Had Steve been real? After four years, was Bond the man or the persona? One lived to serve, to kill, while the other craved love and connection. If he dared be selfish, too, Tony knew whom he would choose, and he’d be damned before he let Steve Rogers fade away without a fight.
“I don’t get paid enough for this,” Tony muttered to himself in the ten, fifteen seconds it took for the lock to
” he told her (and the rest of them) with a playful growl that finally had her tail wagging with full force. She rolled over in his arms until she could rest her chin on his shoulder and squirming closer until she decided it was a good enough place to sit and look across the couch at the other puppies.
Pistol whipping an operative with the license to kill was about the dumbest thing Tony had ever done, but Tony had never felt so angry in his life. He was bleeding, and he was so fucking tired of the lies. The world was already greying at the edges, what did he have to lose?
“So, this is all science?” Tony wondered, enjoying a languid stretch before rolling closer to rub himself against Steve’s body. “I like science.”
Tony rolled his eyes, and reached down to brush Steve’s hair into place instead. “There,” he decided, “better. You ready to face my family again, sunshine?”
The first touch of his tongue had Tony squirming and squeaking, but before he managed to shove Steve away from his newly-discovered treasure, Steve kissed his way up the column of Tony’s neck. With his wicked teeth and hungry lips, he soon turned Tony squirming, giggling protests into a slow, instinctive rocking of his hips, and soft, drawn-out moans of encouragement.
kissed,” he told her in a lowered voice, shy and excited and anxious all at once. “Yesterday. We were both half asleep, I didn’t think it was real… I hope it was? I can’t tell if he wants to take it slow, or if he doesn’t want anyone to know at work or what, but he was distant and weird today. We were digging through records and interviews on Wayne and he just… he would barely talk to me. How does it even work in Kansas? Do they still wait for marriage? I don’t think I can do that, but then it’s Steve.
“There isn’t a negotiation dad can’t win,” Clint explained, looking more sincere than boastful, then slanted a long-suffering look Tony’s way. “And you...”
“Let me, uh. Let’s get you out of that, yeah?” Tony murmured, trying not to freak out. Steve had to be in a bad way to willingly crawl into the wall-bed that nearly made him cry the day before.
Maybe Steve wasn’t immune to shock yet even after all he’d been through. Was it possible that he could have a natural, human life? Steve wrestled with these thoughts in the aftermath of the Battle of New York, when he saw his teammates move forward in their lives and leave him to his and he’d wondered what a life for him could be.
Tony's voice caught for a moment, and he glanced up at his anxious friend before recovering the strength to continue. “Your RMSP, Dr. Moses da Garça reports troubling findings in the potential genetic contribution of your most recent gamete deposit. Of particular concern to Dr. Moses da Garça are Lieutenant Robert B. Banner's hereditary predisposition for rageful and irrational reactivity. His concluding recommendations are to seek joint support from professional therapists who can provide medication, enroll in regular calming activities, and to avoid repetitive tasks. A list of service provides endorsed by Dr. Moses da Garça are enclosed for your convenience. Following a period of six months that demonstrate a consistent change in behavior, Dr. Moses da Garça will welcome Lieutenant Robert B. Banner to make a fourth attempt at his earliest convenience. Healthful wishes, Anastasia Wynmer.”
“Him,” Tony clarified, then with a wry grimace, he quietly said, “look, I don’t mean to sound ungrateful. I know it’s, it’s a privilege, having a family, especially one that wants to see you every once in a while, but we just function better apart. My dad has these traditional opinions of me taking over a business I don’t want to run, and mom lives to introduce me to debutants so she can finally have a daughter. I’d rather not be reminded of how I managed to disappoint them both.”
“Then we don’t go to Lumine,” he suggested, including himself in Steve’s plan as if there had never been another alternative. “The border to Bavaria is the closest. It’ll be confusing as hell, I don’t think there is a law in place for a king to be outside the kingdom under martial law since he’s the judge, jury, and executioner, but—”
Still, nothing went as planned. No eager hands or passionate kisses welcomed Tony; whether Steve had noticed his pale, chapped lips, stiff posture, or some other sign of Tony’s imminent death by exposure and hypothermia, he herded Tony to an enormous couch in the living room in front of a pleasant, crackling fire.
Then, something changed. The corner of the Captain’s lips curled up in a small expression of contentment, and Tony felt his priorities shift into place. Privately, Tony vowed never to disabuse this man of his trust in him.
Steve gathered Tony’s struggling arms in one big paw and held him down. Tony stared up at him, wide-eyed. He knew better than to fight Steve, but if he could only convince his master that he needed a second to recover, to adjust, maybe—
Steve skidded to a halt when he heard the elevator ping from a distance. Bucky was retreating to their apartment.
Tony took a moment to wash his face and brush his teeth before settling in on Steve’s enviable couch with his phone. He had emails to address, news to read, and he had almost finished drafting his out of office autoresponder when Steve shuffled out of the bedroom in nothing but his boxer briefs and a navy blue silk robe.
“No, you sit—no, it’s your first game,” he insisted and got up, though he still couldn’t really look away from the ice. “I’ll get it, what would you like?”
Tony could have said it with as much cheer or sarcasm as he liked, but Steve still understood what he meant. What he didn’t want to say. Tony wasn’t just alone, he was lonely.
Steve couldn’t believe his eyes. He had expected something more straightforward, like doing his homework problems together, not learning the whole class from the ground up. When Tony had found the time to even approach this kind of organization for
Steve sprayed his mouthful of beer across the counter and very nearly caught the bartender. Tony erupted in fits of wheezing laughter and only managed to stay on his stool with Bucky’s help. Steve thought he caught them fist-bumping on the sly, but it was hard to see anything past the rush of embarrassment over his awful mess—he dabbed furiously at the model lake he’d just single-handedly made out of beer, until the bartender who’d been clear of it all by mere inches took mercy on him and mopped it all up. With a warning to take it more slowly, Steve was served another pint.
Whether he did it consciously or not, Tony had started combing his fingers through Steve’s hair, and Steve leaned into the tender touch of his hand, even indulging a little by nuzzling against Tony’s firm chest.
Between Tony’s directions and the Q-branch scientists’ help fetching tools, the impromptu virtual dissection quickly became the only viable lead on Scorpius. In the end, Tony confessed he’d never seen a design like it, but his best guess was that the bombs were real and triggered using specific radio waves. Scorpius would only have to send the signal on a predetermined frequency to activate the bombs. If both (all twelve) bombs were queued up to the same frequency, they could be activated at the same time, but there was no way to know unless they looked at the detonators individually.
Tony blinked up at him. It wasn’t a question he had expected, and he eased his grip of Steve’s hair and started to absently stroke his hair and rub his scalp as he weighed his answer. Steve sighed softly and eased himself down on Tony, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder happily while he waited for Tony’s answer.
There stood Tony, his hair a matted whirlwind around his head and his clothes only slightly askew. He was still wearing what Steve had seen him in before he left for the bar. He smelled of alcohol and cigarette smoke.
“Wah wah, wah wah wah. Wah wah?” Steve replied in the tone of a question, intending to finish his line of thought when Tony pounced. Laughing, Steve collapsed backwards without resistance, making it all too easy for Tony to pin him down in the sand, chest to chest.
“I don’t like this divide and conquer plan they’ve got going, we should all be doing promotions together,” Steve said after his first sip. “Did you get to talk to any of them before they left?”
“Yes, children, what is it? I’m busy,” she said impatiently, holding a cream-covered spatula in one hand.
“I was cursed never to return,” Stephanie explained in a patient voice. “My curse will only be broken when a Chief of my kin becomes my bride. Are you here to bring me to her? Tell me, what is her name?”
“Besides, I own this place,” he said with a grin, as if that was the end-all, be-all argument. “And you’re gonna leave with the best damn nails you’ve ever had.”
Sharon eyed him dubiously. “It’s been three months. I think you’re going to give him a second date no matter what I say.”
Finally, Tony thought to shut the open door behind him. “What are you?” he asked, staying by the door where he could stay as far from the speaking animal as he could get.
“Sweetheart, listen to me,” Steve said in a loud but gentle voice. Tony whined but shut his mouth to listen. “Step away from your computer. Take a long, warm shower. I will see you in forty minutes.”
and threatened to smack Tony in the head with it, which finally seemed to kick him into gear. “That sounds like fun, yeah. Yeah, I’d like that. What time?”
Tony thought he heard Steve rasp something along the lines of, 'too much?', but before Tony could care to ask, Steve licked it off with the flat of his tongue. Tony couldn't have moved a muscle if he'd wanted to, but the way Steve couldn't stop touching him, couldn't stop staring at him made him feel inexplicably appreciated. This was something Steve had dreamed of doing, a fantasy he had never dared to think would come true, and making it a reality was all Tony had wanted to do. So when Steve could only grope his ass and expose Tony for his own pleasure, another fantasy successfully brought to life, Tony felt Steve’s gratitude and his adoration deep down to his bones.
“I’m sure that’s what Tony would say if he wasn’t ignoring me right now,” Steve observed casually. Without looking back, Tony mule kicked him under the sheets. Steve grunted under his breath and did his best not to sound too tickled by it.
“That’s what you need, is it?” he rumbled with a smug grin, squeezing and pulsing his muscles around Steve’s throbbing cock without so much as moving his hips.
Steve took Tony’s hand gently in his, but before leading the way to his place, he made sure to pay the driver and include the fare for driving Tony home. Tony had been around Steve long enough not to be surprised, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t touched. Not to mention he had no idea where Steve had been hiding his wallet in that skin-tight Superman suit. He wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
“You have to see it,” Stephen added for the audience, but then quickly changed the subject to avoid saying too much. “So, what’s coming up next for you? The holidays are around the corner, are you taking some time off for anything special?”
“Buck,” Steve said in a low, warning tone, and he eyed Bucky’s fresh pint and three empty glasses. How quickly had they downed their drinks? Tony was still smiling and cheerful, but there wasn’t a doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony wanted to make a good impression—hell, he’d gone out of his way to get Natasha a birthday present. The last thing Tony needed right now was Steve’s beer-happy friend prodding him with awkward, immature questions.
Without looking up from his drawing, Steve said, “If plaid flannel is all he owns, and she already agreed to the date, wouldn’t that mean she liked him in plaid flannel?”
“I think they’d gone straight to voicemail,” Steve replied, because that did make the most sense, after all. “There’s only a few people whose calls come through when we’re sleeping—we have friends all over the world, nobody can keep track of who is in what time zone, so our phones don't ring at night unless it’s our parents. And dad is… well,” Steve trailed off, then quickly changed tack. “Let’s put it this way: for the longest time, Tony wasn’t sure my dad even liked him. So I wake up and it’s dad calling at five in the morning—immediately I’m thinking the worst has happened, because why else would dad call before dawn? I’m asking if mom’s okay, if he’s okay, and at the same time I’m shaking Tony awake and telling him to get us the first tickets back to Boston when dad - in his typical calm, serious voice - just says, ‘I want to talk to Tony.’ So we switch phones: I finish booking the tickets while Tony tries to wake up enough to talk to my dad. And I don’t know what my dad said to him, they still won’t tell me,” Steve wryly observed, a quick interjection in his own story, “but at the time, all I could see was Tony starting to cry. So, of course, now I’m thinking that dad’s heard something about Tony’s mom and we should really be going to New York to see her, so I book the first tickets out to New York, just in case.”
“That, we’ve got,” the woman said with a relieved smile. “Will you be a secondary driver for the vehicle?”
“What? No!” Steve cried, then lowered his voice to hiss, “he can’t see me like this, Clint! What if—I am to be bound to the Chief, I will be a woman. If he sees me like this, he, he—he might say no. When I ask him, for the child,” Steve whispered, almost fearful in his tone. “His child.”
Steve was already working on undoing Tony’s shirt buttons when he pouted up at Tony with the worst hangdog expression. “Aw, shucks. What gave me away?”
Ironically, the reminder of how little money mattered to Steve always made Tony feel worse. If Steve didn’t care about the money even a little, Tony didn’t have a chance. Soon enough, Steve would get bored of him, and without the draw of money to keep his attention, Steve would leave him, too.
Unaware of any of Steve’s inner turmoil, Tony only blinked at Bucky in confusion. “Anything like what?”
“I,” Steve choked out, struggling to form words as if he’d just sprinted instead of driven from campus. “Manicure, please.”
It just happened that Tony was a genius. Whether he was an FDA Certified Grassfed Genius with a current Mensa membership card glued to the back of his license was beyond Steve, but he knew that Tony’s ‘most educated guess’ was better than what the average person hoped to achieve in a lifetime. And now, in less than 48 hours, he was back to break Steve’s heart by reminding him of whose affection he’d lost and why Steve admired him as deeply as he did.
Steve peeled one eye open and looked in Tony’s direction. God, if love was real, Steve knew it existed in those brown eyes looking back at him.
“You’re helping me do this, right?” Bucky called as Steve turned to leave the living room, not asking for his help as much as he was asking for support in this vulnerable moment of realizing how expensive it was to be a woman.
can look the part,” Thor insisted, clearly offended. “Therapists can be tall and sexy, with fire in their loins!”
“School’s fine,” Tony promised Steve in a rush, and it was so easy to lean into Steve’s tender hand, to reach for him and hide from choices he didn’t want to make in Steve’s strong arms. “School’s fine, Steve. Long night, that’s all,” he lied while Steve couldn’t see his face. “I don’t know how to iron a stupid shirt.”
and reached for his phone. He didn’t have time for this. He needed to finish his homework and go to sleep; tomorrow was their last full battalion practice for the weekend’s Ranger Challenge and he needed to be sharp. The CRB needed him to be sharp.
“Well, Seamus,” Tony told the dog and opened to a random page, “let me tell you about one of the most badass women in our country. So, six weeks after the Struck case hit a wall, the Supreme Court handed down its twin decisions in
“Estás jugando? I’m not talking to her because I want to,” Tony said in slow, clipped words. “I’m talking to her because
For one last time, a golden light shone from deep within Stephanie’s chest like a bright, white star, cascading over her skin and her clothes until it consumed her body entirely, even as Tony held her tightly to his heart. It all happened so fast that Tony was still lost in kissing Stephanie that he barely noticed her transforming, until she grew nearly a hundred pounds heavier in his arms. He pulled his head away from the kiss as he stumbled backward, struggling to stay upright with all 240 pounds of Steve clutched possessively in his arms.
“Visualizations for your presentation,” Steve explained, logging into his computer then stepping away from it so Tony could take the seat at his desk. “I was thinking it would be a good way to show them the different physical skills Dum-E has learned? Your robot can operate a freaking fire extinguisher, Tony,” Steve reminded him as he urged Tony to take the seat. “Do you realize how incredible that is?”
Steve nodded in the affirmative to Josh’s first question. “For those reasons I mentioned earlier, of how it brings us to these characters and stories where life feels hopeless and, we have these individuals who try to carve something out of their own aching circumstances. Especially against the backdrop of how we view the American experience and that American post-war zeitgeist, this is an important and compelling narrative of life we rarely talk about. It’s so easy to adhere to the spirit Eisenstaedt captured in the ‘V-J Day’ kiss, to imagine that the relief and exuberance was the lived experience for everyone everywhere in our country. But this was… there are projects you jump on because they are exciting, or they’re with great people, but we felt this was all of that in addition to a chance to highlight a part of US history that has been pushed aside. And Pollock’s story brings these elements to the fore through a compelling story characterized by people whose journeys we felt were somehow both familiar and unthinkable.”
The door to their office swung open to reveal Junior Officer Jane Foster. "Lieutenant Anthony E. Stark,” she said with a pained expression. "Chief Director Nicholas Fury requires your audience.”
“Steven Grant Rogers, if you think I’m leaving you alone before I get to see and kiss my grandbabies, you got another thing coming,” she reminded him with the snap of a threat that shook Steve right out of his gloomy thoughts with a burst of surprised laughter.
As soon as the warriors were out of sight, Clint turned to Tony with a frown. “So, what was it about my plan you didn’t like? I thought it was pretty good, myself.”
Four years ago, Steve would only ever sound cheerful and happy when Tony opened the door and came home. ‘Tony, is that you?’ would be an expression of excitement, a thrill to have his husband home from meetings or the workshop before sundown.
“You’ll feel better after your workout, I promise. The endorphins help,” Steve continued, reaching to hold Tony’s hands before he caved and indulged. “Napping helps, too. Why don’t you take your breakfast in bed and I’ll finish here?”
“I want to believe you, Steve,” Tony grumbled, attempting a humorous tone but failing spectacularly. He sounded pitiful at best. “I just find it hard to believe that you went out and bought yourself a ring, but you treat it like it’s a gift from a lover you lost to the war, who, any day now, will come knocking on our door and take you away from here to some far-away island and do god knows what to—”
“You heard me the first time, you jerk,” Steve rumbled to Tony’s giggling delight. “Don’t laugh! I’ll go get cleaned up tomorrow—”
Rhodes walked up to Tony’s sleeping form to wake him with a gentle touch. “Tony?” he said in a lowered voice, “hey, Tony, wake up.”
Their victories aligned with the holiday season, and fortunately, the seasonal excitement mellowed hard-working politicians with the joy of Christmas festivities. It was the first time since their honeymoon that Tony had the chance to devote Steve his full attention, and he didn’t waste a minute of it.
, it is directly from experience. And that could either mean I had sex, it was spectacular and worthy of commemorating, or it was an intentional run-through with a willing partner or partners for the purpose of writing into the book. You with me?” he asked at the end of a crazy rush of words that Steve only barely digested. Had he been jerking off to Tony’s actual sex life? Sure, it wasn’t so far fetched, and occasionally he might have even guessed it, but to have it
“What about the relationship you ruined, Tony?” Steve called after him before Tony got to the elevators. Tony slowed to a halt and turned to look at him, frowning in confusion.
After nearly five months together in Tony’s studio and that hell forsaken wall-bed, Steve could finally walk, stretch, and even shave his face with enough dexterity to go back to his own flat in Chelsea.
Wednesday morning, Steve’s alarm rang at 4:45 like it always did, and Tony whined into his pillow about it like he always did. Steve smiled fondly and rolled closer to Tony to press a soft kiss to his forehead.
“Tony, what a surprise! You’re on this floor, too?” he asked with a big smile that his face was too tired to support, and even he could feel how it collapsed into a lopsided grin.
Tony rolled his eyes, then reached back to pull one of Steve’s hands off his ass. “You asked me to please
Steve didn’t answer him, but his smile stretched into a grin and he climbed up into the bed without hesitation. Unlike the nights they had already spent together at his place, where Steve comfortably kept to his side of the bed, Steve shuffled to the middle without thinking. Tony lost no time meeting him halfway: he moved to the middle and threw an arm over Steve’s waist, nuzzling into Steve’s chest.
“It’s not my place either, Aunt Sarah,” Bucky said respectfully while glancing between his best friend and the woman who for all intents and purposes was his second mother.
Tony took a deep breath, held it for a count of four, then slowly let it out. When that didn’t work, he tried distracting himself by staring out the window in silence. The tension in the car and the familiar feeling of being watched told him Steve continued to glance his way, but Tony waited until he could quiet his own insecurities.
He paused for a beat, as if waiting for Sitwell to say a word and give him a reason to call armed personnel, but the moment passed in absolute silence.
“Mine,” Steve murmured against Tony’s lips as they eventually slipped apart. Tony hummed softly in reply, chasing Steve’s lips with one more quick, but eager, kiss.
“I’ve wanted to tell you for a few years, but I never knew how to do it without sounding like I was trying to pressure you into marriage.”
In his sleep, Tony’s lips curled up in a smile, and with the unhurried indulgence of a far-off dream, he rocked his hips and rubbed his soft cock against the covers of his bed. Steve watched on with a satisfied smirk as Tony's cock filled and hardened; quick work for someone so young. He knelt beside the bed, then coaxed Tony’s legs farther apart with a gentle, sweeping touch up Tony’s inner thigh. In his new position almost entirely on his belly, it was no effort on Steve’s part to bring both hands up to frame Tony’s firm, round ass, and knead them just hard enough to squeeze and separate for his inspection.
Steve hung his head, then scrubbed his hands over his face. It wasn’t difficult to see Steve was upset, but for the life of him, Tony couldn’t figure out why. Who would not be comforted to know someone could always monitor his coordinates and his health? Thanks to code tracers, ambulances and medical attention had never lost their way, and for those whose conditions could be predicted, aid often arrived well before the incident came to pass.
The light at the end of the tunnel was slowly making itself known. After Korea, there was only a brief conference in Geneva to meet with Macron, Michel, and Bettel between them and a return to Consone.
“People who would be given severance packages,” Steve continued through gritted teeth. “Tony, these might not even be the same investors that you deal with when the hand-off happens; they might even
“Here, sit,” Steve said before Tony had to respond to Bucky’s transparent jab. He shifted from one stool to the next, letting Tony take a seat between himself and Bucky. “Drink?”
The lamp of the lighthouse shone brightly from a distance, and Steve remembered sitting on a bench with Tony and bundled up together in a blanket from his car. The sea-facing side of the chapel was made out of glass, and from a distance Steve and Tony could watch one couple after another stand and commit to their love before an affable priest.
“Until last week, I thought the serum would keep me like this forever. That nothing would change for me, but I’d have to watch you and the team grow old. I never thought I’d be—that the serum wouldn’t take that from me. What you told me last week was a dream come true, and since that day, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about you”
The audience, who’d been laughing and making noises throughout the story, finally burst into cheerful laughter in the end, and even Jimmy couldn’t help but snicker at the rather anticlimactic end. Whether they could read between the lines or not wasn’t Steve’s problem.
“Honestly, I think it’s hit and miss. His parents know but I doubt he’s told his grandmother; he introduced me to her as his ‘friend’ last summer. And she really liked me,” Steve felt compelled to say. “Sharon’s from Connecticut. She belongs to his country club, and I’m sure someone in her family got here on the Mayflower.”
“In his defense, and I never say that lightly,” Tony replied, as objectively and calmly as he could. “Howard gets enough military funding to support other scientific advancements. I don’t really feel the balance is fair,” he added, “but even at a minimum he’s got a substantial backing for sustainable farming and communication technology.”
In the safety of his own home, Steve dared to roll his eyes. “Mom, we had a pretty crazy start. When things have calmed down, when we know where we stand, I’ll bring him for dinner.”
Tony. He respected him, lived in awe of him. And, yeah, if villains found a way to weaponize Tony’s smile, neither Steve nor his heart wouldn’t stand a chance. But no; it was too soon to call it love.)
“He needs to know,” Pepper said before Rhodey had to slur through a monologue of ‘what is right and true in the  Red, White, and Brew!’ “I mean, this is serious: you’re dating, and it’s—a week, wow, Steve, I mean, with this one it’s like dog years, you have to be committed—”
“What can I do?” Tony asked in a whisper, doing everything not to add to Steve’s problems. “You are welcome to stay, if you like. There’s a guest room; a warm bath? A shower?”
“It’s not you,” Clint told Steve when the door had closed behind the parents. “Ever since she found Dummy in the house that one time, she says it every time she leaves.”
At first, Steve only knew to nod in reply. He had expected this kind of reaction in the moment at Dr. Odinson’s office, when he first shared his practiced rationale for why he wanted to be with Tony. Now, in a more intimate and unstructured context, he wasn’t so sure what to do with Tony’s unexpected vulnerability.
The first week had been fine. Steve enjoyed the lingering freedom in the happy haze following their honeymoon. It was easy then to pretend they were still unburdened by responsibilities. But as Steve slowly faced all the ways his normalcy was taken from him, he grew more silent and withdrawn. He threw himself into his language studies, reading endlessly and working with tutors, all the while Tony watched from a distance as the smallest details ate away at his husband’s happiness. None of the things that irritated Steve were out of the ordinary for Tony, and that frustrated any attempt he made to predict and mitigate issues before Steve set his jaw and fell silent in his anger. One morning Tony learned that their laundry service folded Steve’s underwear into triangles, and another afternoon, he caught Steve going through both their desks to recover his art pens and pencils where the staff had mixed them in with everything else. The worst problem was the requirement to announce their intention to leave the palace grounds, then await an escort. The rule chafed at Tony, but it was all he had ever known. To Steve, it was downright insulting.
How Steve resisted shamelessly preening over his unexpected special delivery in front of all his envious colleagues was anybody’s guess. But since he had no better place to put the flowers during the work day, Steve left the full vase with reception and only took the card with him when he went on break to make the happy call.
As much as his frustration was warranted, and even appreciated, Steve cleared his throat, pushed the quilt aside, and stood up tall. He offered his hand to Howard first.
He didn’t need to be popular; he didn’t even need lots of friends! If he could only find Brock and show him that he
“I printed out examples of photographs other sugar babies used, and even got you your own photographer,” Natasha said with a self-satisfied smirk, gesturing across the bullpen to where one of their better forensic photographers was chatting up a junior detective.
Tony’s stomach dropped and he cringed with his whole body. If only the world would open up and swallow him whole so he wouldn’t have to continue the world’s most embarrassing conversation with the world’s most handsome man!
He tried to ask ‘who is it,’ but he couldn’t get his tongue to work yet, so without waiting for an answer, he tugged on the door until it opened.
Stealing Brock back was easier said than done. On more than one occasion, he’d knocked on Brock’s door with a bottle of champagne and two glasses, but Brock was never home. He made a point to start working out in the evening when he knew Brock was there, and while heads often turned when he turned up (especially for back and shoulders day), Brock never did more than steal glances of him from a distance.
Steve sucked in a sudden breath and went absolutely tense. He abandoned his position, needing to clutch the pillow he’d been biting into out of sheer ecstacy only seconds ago, but Tony pressed on, slowly rubbing a gentle palm over Steve’s lower back and whispering affectionate encouragement.
“I didn’t even know wood could shine like that,” he muttered as he helped himself to some coffee and marveled at the polished work bench in the kitchen. “Kinda think we need to rub some dirt over the house… hell, if mom sees this is possible, she’ll never be happy again.”
“I got Peter, Peter Parker, who plays Spider-Man in the film. I got him hooked on Hannibal,” Tony said, and immediately Steve doubled over and hid his face in his hands to muffle his whimpering laughter. Tony snickered to himself and rubbed soothing circles over Steve’s shoulders as he continued his story. “It’s cancelled now, but it’s one of the best shows I’ve ever seen on TV. I gave him my box set and every once in a while I’ll get these random texts from him where he’s clearly in the middle of an episode, like, ‘he’s put a person in that apple hasn’t he?’”
“He’s not coming, is he?” Bucky asked, and by the looks of his crew, they were wondering the same thing. “It’ll be difficult enough explaining why my best friend is wearing one of these clown suits, but he’s dead meat down there.”
“From Tony Stark’s shared stories, I understand your generation’s actors recorded many archival discs. Our actors serve a different function: they are extensions of our venerable Governor’s benevolent guidance. Actors travel with his messages, meeting with children in schools, reporting to community leaders, or otherwise make themselves available to answer questions and report changes to the public.”
Tony made a face as he considered Steve’s argument. “Makes sense,” he agreed in the end, somewhat defeated. “Fine, okay. So, it
There was a quick rapping on the door, which gave them just enough warning for Steve to stand up and for Tony to sit up in bed before Maria stepped into the bedroom. She had two big shopping bags in one hand.
Unlike his fantasies for power play and dominance while fucking Tony, Steve had never been shy about oral sex. He took to his task like fish to water, explicitly inviting Tony from day one to grab him by the hair, to be more assertive and vocal about what he needed. At nineteen and in his first relationship that hadn’t begun with a one-night stand, Tony had still been hesitant. After all, when you avoided versatiles and other bottoms like the plague, you learned to live with the consequences.
“You took me in when I had nowhere else to go, Tony. You didn’t even hesitate. You took care of me when I couldn’t do anything for myself. No amount of money could repay you for what you’ve done for me. Please? Unless there’s something else you’d rather have, let me do this. I want to do this.”
“I'm not going to suck his dick!” Tony hissed indignantly, then immediately held his breath to listen for any signs that Steve was eavesdropping on him.
“A crestfallen Tony Stark, maybe. It would be a nice change of pace,” Bruce explained, helping himself to a slice of banana—except Tony intercepted his greedy fingers with his fork, and pulled his plate closer to himself. “Hey!”
“It was, Mrs. Rogers,” Tony said as he put his feet down to stop the swing for Sarah. The screen door connecting the kitchen to the back porch swung shut behind her while she shuffled out with a little bundle and, more importantly, a tray with two lime green margaritas the size of Tony’s face.
As a courtesy to her betrothed, Stephanie considered the Chief’s suggestion. “Not by force,” Stephanie eventually decided. “I will ask; if they agree to make me with a daughter, then so be it.”
“Are, uh. Are you sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?” Tony asked, trying not to sound as uncomfortable by the whole situation as he felt. Steve had trusted him. If anyone knew what it felt like to be alone in a foreign country, it was Tony. But that didn’t mean he knew how to help.
“I know those categories,” Bucky said from his own desk, perking up with a broad grin. “Stark, are you planning a date?”
Had Tony never noticed how attractive his partner was in all their time together, or was he simply that adept at denial? Steve was kind and quick-witted and sharp enough to give Tony a run for his money. In Tony’s defense, who’d ever expect half of that said about some guy out of Bumfuck Nowhere, Kansas?
That quiet time together was the closest Steve ever got to meditation, and privately he wished they could find an arrangement that let them start most of their days together.
Stubborn as he was, Tony couldn’t bear to look away, he never wanted to look away even as his eyes rolled back in his head from the overwhelming pleasure. But Steve knew him enough to know that even if he looked calm, Tony wasn’t necessarily composed on the inside. He felt Tony’s orgasm building him into a frenzy in the way his loose, stretched rim pulsed like it wanted to draw his fingers in, in the tremble of Tony’s spread thighs, and in the tight arch of his foot and curl of his toes, until suddenly it overtook him like a crashing wave, something he clearly saw coming but still wasn’t prepared for.
“I don’,” Tony mumbled quietly, moaning with relief as he all but melted under Steve’s touch. “Don’ make face...”
“What if I stay?” he asked in a sudden revelation, watching Bucky with a manic desperation. “I stay, I don’t leave the safety of my room: you take everyone and help find Tony. Please, Buck, you—if I can’t go, please, you have to, he could be in danger, please.”
“Tony, something’s been on your mind for weeks, you’re scaring me here,” Steve confessed after enough time had passed without a reply. “Talk to me, please.”
to know more about Antonovich. But Tony was close to tears. He looked as miserable as Steve had feared he was on their first phone call. As urgent as his work was, Steve couldn’t leave Tony in such a state.
Steve chuckled to himself and pushed his full glass of water closer to Tony. How Steve knew he was thirsty was a mystery, but Tony accepted it gratefully and took a long drink.
“What’s wrong, Steve?” Tony asked, edging closer on the couch in case Steve was hurt. “You broke contact, are you unwell?”
“You hardly got to see the city,” Steve noted on their last evening in the city. They had enjoyed a long dinner and decided to take a stroll around the city. It was drizzling and the streets were fairly empty, but neither of them were in a hurry to get back to the hotel. They walked arm in arm, squeezed together under a big umbrella.
We're going into extra stoppage time! I kinda get the sense y'all knew that all along. Hope you're liking it so far - and the next chapter
“No, we’ve got back-up questions,” Karl assured him. “If you get this right, we’ll bring out two puppies and move on to the next question.”
“You are correct, Steve Rogers! I applaud your mind, you are already learning,” Tony said with a smile. “As you have said, only gold class adults are eligible for state sanctioned partnerships. Gold class adults can also enter managerial positions and leadership roles. They can be politicians, doctors, lawyers.”
“Well, one way or another that man is lying, and I don’t care what a liar pays for,” Sam raised his voice to say to both of them. Steve had never more been tempted to throw his friends into the fucking river. It wasn’t even a temptation, it was an
“With you? Yeah… yeah, someday,” he whispered with a nervous excitement that spoke volumes of how eager he was to share his
Tony didn’t look surprised or confused; he laughed instead, taking Steve’s take-away from him to go put it in the kitchen. “Of all the ways I thought you’d get me into your bed…”
“I just,” he tried to explain, though he failed to find words that could be both honest and respectful of Tony’s past. “I don’t get it.”
“But he is right,” a voice echoed through the mist, unmistakably feminine and powerful. Clint tossed his head and tried to twist to see where the voice had come from, but he could not see anything through the heavy clouds around them. “You are safe here, and here you will remain.”
“Is that the kind of thing fancy schools teach you?” Clint asked with a little grin, hanging up his hat on a hook before wandering through to the kitchen. Steve followed him, increasingly amused by Clint’s continued surprise at how clean everything was.
“My dear acquaintance Virginia Potts serves as the Editor of Archival Media in the Arnold Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. She recently discovered a set of cinematic discs from the 21st century, which she generously copied for me. I spent this entire weekend studying the cinematic re-enactment of the fabled hero Captain America!”
“Stop! Steve, this isn’t our fight!” Bucky shouted the words he’d done his best to avoid all these months. “You owe him nothing, Steve. You have responsibilities to your people,” he said, albeit sympathetically. “I know you care for him, but officially he’s nothing to you.”
Tony sat down on the coffee table in front of Steve and offered him an unopened box of Sno Balls. “You’ll feel better,” he promised.
Thankfully, Steve was patient. Patient enough to gently redirect Tony’s attempts to cuddle in close in his sleep, and carry on with nonsensical conversations while he fiddled with Tony’s cufflinks. Patient enough to unstrap the elegant watch from his wrist so it wouldn’t clock Steve in the nose in the middle of the night. He placed the watch and Tony’s phones on the bedside table where they would be within easy reach for him in the morning, then quickly tossed his own towel over a chair so he could crawl in under the covers with his husband.
Tony blinked wildly as he tried to pull himself together. He felt like he had missed an important step somewhere between Steve’s slow, indulgent build-up to work him open and the sudden consuming pleasure that reduced Tony to a dribbling, mewling mess. His body bowed on instinct, arching as far as Steve’s mass allowed as he begged with his body and his words for Steve to let him come. Instead, Steve lifted him by his hips until Tony was doubled over in plow position with his heavy cock hanging mere inches over his face, and his ass turned up for Steve and Steve alone.
and he didn’t have a costume of any kind. What was an acceptable costume anyway? Didn’t masquerades mean fancy dress like Louis XIV and Phantom of the Opera? And here was Steve, perfectly average bachelor with no eccentric flair who didn’t even have white bedsheets to cut up for a ghost costume.
Steve pressed his lips together and was silent for some time before something else came to him. “Sharon Carter,” he said urgently, “my, my friend’s niece. Was she—”
“Then, knock it off! Chief Director, you requested and trusted my assessment to bring the Captain into the fold for his experience and expertise apprehending the multi-MDK maniac. In light of our recent failures and unsanctioned loss of life, I urge you most desperately to consider Captain Steve Rogers’ advice.”
