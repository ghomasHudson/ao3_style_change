She pulls Peter by the arm, forcing him to sit down next to her while all these other people just keep looking at him with wide smiles on their faces.
He’s also perfectly sure that the Captain will never speak a word about the hour he spent crying against his shoulder when the realization hits once again that Mary is dead
, she repeatedly heard her own name, said by different persons who weren’t even there like Steve and X, but also Raido.
Yaël shakes her head. “Actually, Steve did. Told me you’ve hit a rough patch. For a long time they weren’t even sure you would come along.”
“I’ll be back for you, Spider-Man!” the Goblin then shouts out right before disappearing back into the air. The Falcon and War Machine race back after him, but Clint and Cap stay down watching them leave with a loud sigh escaping from their mouths. Peter drops himself on the ground and just lies down, looking into the sky through his mask and noticing that there are some scratches in his glasses. Great, he’ll need to get that fixed once more.
“Her brain’s scrambled and she don’t remember a thing,” he explains. Peter then nods in understanding. Sadly, that is one problem he can’t really help with. Then he decides to just… show her that he’s got issues, too, to show her that she’s not alone.
“Good morning, Værøy,” Yaël mumbled while stretching her back, looking at the waves that were splashing against the rocks. For a moment, she just stood there, looking at the sea. Somewhere far away, a group filled with pieces of shit was fighting each other.
True to his word, Tony did not say anything. But they both got a very enjoyable evening out of it, so it’s not really a wasted attempt.
“Okay… So, that’s mine. Thanks for the effort,” she sighed while quickly pulling out the card from his pocket.
“Uh, you can let me go now, Dad,” Peter mutters out. Tony doesn’t react. Not even when another pair of footsteps comes up behind him. Peter blinks a few times when he sees Steve enter, but where he would expect Steve to tell Tony to let him go, instead the super soldier comes up and pulls both Peter and Tony into his arms as well.
“Do you want me to come along?” Natasha suggests. Tony sighs but nods, though not moving at all.  He hates this day already, and it’s not even past noon, yet. With dread all over his body, Tony leaves every one of them behind, slowly making his way towards the hallway where he hopes Peter is ready with his bath. Then he shortly turns to Natasha.
“No,” Yaël grunted shortly while fighting back screams and tears as Vision was cleaning her wound. Then he calmly pulled the tube from her hand and started smearing the crème on her wound.
“Two of us?” he asks. Rhodey nods, looking smug for a moment. Nothing happens, and Peter just raises his eyebrow while he waits. Rhodey clears his throat, coughing into his hand. About ten seconds later, the doorbell rings.
“You know what, whatever… I’ll figure it out next year,” he mutters, wondering how he would even manage to pull all that off
Steve doesn’t know if Peter should know. He doesn’t want Tony to keep things hidden from him, but just knowing it…
A few hours later, Yaël was laying on her back on a filthy floor in a bar. A random dude used her belly as a pillow while they were thinking about weird ways to say their names. Not that Yaël would remember his name afterwards.
“It’s barely anything, you see?” he points out. “Besides, if that hadn’t happened, I’m sure I would be calling Tony Mr. Stark, still.”
Peter, who is holding his phone in his hands, and watching a video of himself in women’s clothes, dancing to Rihanna’s Umbrella with an actual umbrella in his hands. The video shared by Flash, with the only text written with it ‘Penis Parker shows his true self’.
“What’s going on, Steve?” Tony mutters out, rubbing his eyes while turning onto his back. Steve shifts, too, coming to lean on his elbow to sit up higher for a bit.
Bucky looks… better, in a way. Sure, they’re not close to even fixing the way his head works, but they’re starting to get somewhere now. Wanda helps a lot, he said. That’s all that really matters.
Peter hums in understanding, watching the buildings of Asgard bloom up on the screen. It’s not like the golden civilization he’s read all about it – there’s not
No further explanation, no more words said. The call is disconnected, and Peter can only hear some ringing in his ear. But, at the same time, he can’t move.
“Harry?!” Peter asks. Harry jumps off the board and holds out his hand towards Peter, giving him a wide grin.
Yaël groaned as she heard someone knock on her bedroomdoor. She turned to her other side, away from the door, and kept her eyes shut. But the person knocking on her door was persistent and kept trying to wake her up.
“Your savior is here!” Loki stated loudly while arrogantly raising his arms with a grin. Oh, the man sure had a feeling for extra drama, Yaël thought while crossing her arms and sarcastically rolling her eyes behind the prince’s back.
“A special stone, that had been spotted in this area a few era’s ago. I hoped you have heard of it, it’s called the Soul Stone.”
“Ah, ever so flustered. Don’t ever change,” she jokes. Then she finally turns towards Tony, noticing him for the first time. “And this is…?”
“I’m listening,” Tony finally assures him. And so Steve starts talking, telling him about the day he figured out his best friend Bucky was still alive. He told him about what happened with him; what HYDRA turned him into. He told him about Natasha’s story when she’d been shot by the Winter Soldier, and how he’d almost killed Nick Fury in Steve’s own apartment.
Of course, that’s old news, since everybody seems to know Peter once convinced Spider-Man to come to a party. A party he doesn’t really want to think back to.
“No way, each step it gets further from us is a step too much,” Tony counters. Peter can see Steve sigh and put his hand on the man’s shoulder to calm him down a bit.
Steve, too, came by a few times. Sometimes he stayed for the night, sometimes he didn’t. Sometimes he was happy and talked a lot and his life seemed to be fun, though sometimes he looked exhausted, emotionally melted by things Tony did or said. Now, Yaël tried to be neutral about that Tony-dude, for Steve, even though Stark didn’t like her somehow, but every time Steve came over to talk about him, Yaël felt more and more sorry for the billionaire. He seemed to have a hard time, not that Steve gave her any details, but it appeared Steve really tried to take care of Stark and that happened to be an incredible tough job.
“Yeah, really,” he said, not credible at all. Steve took another sip of his glass and stared at the wall. He was thinking about something, so Yaël decided to let him be for a moment.
They’re all at the dining table. For the rare occasion Tony cooked something. That could either mean it would be extremely delicious,
“Hi everybody,” Steve says, with Tony walking right behind him, one hand in his pocket and the other one biting into a green apple. Natasha’s all too aware of the two men staring right at Tony, checking out his walk. She rolls her eyes, trying to make clear she’s not a part of their stupid little quest of ‘wisdom’.
But then he disappears again, seemingly dissolving in a light blue smoke. Tony gapes at it with an open mouth, but then he clears his throat and blinks a few times. Surely, Steve will be back, he won’t just leave like that. Tony moves forward, reaching for another star. This time, he puts the little thing against his lips, suddenly feeling the need to give it comfort, to watch over it. He’s feeling very protective over this particular little star that he doesn’t really want to let go of it, either.
Peter’s aware that his phone is ringing in his pocket. He ignores it, ignores the beer being spilled over his clothes. Ignores the girl that slaps his but and winks at him when he faces her. When one girl comes up to him and almost starts kissing him, he takes a step back and holds up his hands. Without any explanation, he turns around. He doesn’t need to explain himself here. People shouldn’t just start kissing people because they want to.
“Don’t say that in here!” he hisses back, and Ned takes a look around before frowning back at Peter.
Steve looks a little pensive, clearly out of his debt here due to all the science they’re talking about. Peter knows that Steve has no idea what it’s all about. He gets points for trying to understand it, at least. Keeping up with Tony is just an unusual hard job that not everybody can do.
“FRIDAY, you won’t like it but I’m going to program new override codes. I’ll need to tweak you again a little bit.”
“Well, I figure both of us pretty much got it off our chests back then. You got anything more to add to it?” Peter asked while unwittingly ticking his legs, using them as drums.
“Uh, how are we going to get there?” Peter asks, realizing it’s a stupid question the moment it comes out of his mouth. Tony grins at him. Even more so when there’s a knock on the door. Immediately, he frowns.
Everybody does their part. The twins are back inside, sitting in front of the heater while a movie plays on the TV. Paul, Wanda and Vision join them on the couch, trying to watch along. Clint, too, seems to be interested in the movie.
Everybody groans and rolls their eyes. Who ever thought it would be a good idea to have the teams chosen by name-pulling?
“My name is Peter,” he tells her, allowing the woman to put the palm of her hand onto his cheek. Automatically, he leans into the touch. Tony knows how that feels. Silently, he puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder. “I’m his son.”
“Alright, Thor, let’s go,” Steve says, touching Thor’s arm to indicate that they’re ready to go. Thor quickly nods, pulling Steve along into a separate room. There, in the middle, there’s some sort of desk. It looks old, probably second-hand – it appears the Asgardians can’t really afford much more right now. On top of said desk, there’s a bunch of papers.
The Cat then takes something off her belt and throws it into the fire. Peter’s surprised when suddenly all the flames seem to be sucked into whatever device the girl has thrown in. There’s not even smoke, as it’s pulled along as well. Peter turns to look at the Cat, glad for just one short moment that she stole the Vulture’s stuff. It’s only for a few seconds, though, before he remembers that she shouldn’t have this stuff.
“Thank you, May,” he says. Then he walks to the door, not at all pleased that he’s going to leave his son behind but at least comforted by the idea that somebody capable is looking after him. Once he gets to the living room, he’s shocked by the explosion of people currently sitting there.
Three hours into their date, they decide to head out. Tony pays the bill, guiding Steve out of the restaurant. After another short trip, Tony parks his car again in an empty parking lot. Before he can open up the door to help Steve out, the super soldier is already standing outside.
“Alright, now give me everything about this world,” he mutters out. In front of his closed eyes, the overflow of information comes. He could have done this without the AI, but clearly Tony has his priorities straight.
Peter follows her finger but can’t really find anything that could distinguish the building from the others. Right when he’s about to ask what exactly the girl needs from there, she jumps over the edge of the building, falling down to the ground.
“Don’t be stupid, of course I didn’t,” Mr. Stark answers to Steve. “At least, not entirely. He’s going to be my new assistant.”
She lands right on the roof of the building she’d been inspecting. Giving Peter a thumb’s up, he’s waiting for her to continue.
“They called it putting Thor’s ‘manhood’ on her lap, but I figure it’s just mostly tradition since Thor can’t very much give blessing to his own wedding,” Tony mutters back. Steve frowns at the absurdity of it, but he figures it’s just something he wouldn’t understand. “I also think it’s a combination of exchanging weapons. Though Jane has no weapons to offer, and Mjölnir is not just something anybody can pick up.”
Huh, those are the same eyes he looks at when he’s standing in front of the mirror. How funny that is. Hey, didn’t his mother once sleep with this guy? How freaking weird is that? But then again, the dancing spiders around Mr. Stark’s head are weird as well.
“After a while, we didn’t hear from him again – nobody did. It was as if he’d disappeared completely from the world.”
“So they even pay you to be my friend, but they don’t pay me to buy shampoo? Great!” Yaël threw her hands in the air and rolled her eyes. Wade shrugged. “So, now I have a superhero friend? What, to teach me how to be responsible and shit?”
Yaël sighed and sat down again, there was clearly no use in trying to get out of this creepy hallway. “So tell me, how did you end up in here?” she asked as she had nothing else to do.
“Anybody already called Steve about this?” Pepper then asks. Bruce, who is already standing at the coffee machine to prepare some more, shakes his head.
Arriving in Chinatown at last, Miles walks back up out of the station. It would be far-fetched to say that New York smells fresh. It smells like sewers, most of the time. In some parts of the city, it just smells like crack all around. More often than not a random dude offers him whatever they’re high on and Miles so far has always refused – kindly, obviously. They should be happy he doesn’t get their asses arrested. Just one word to his Dad and they would all be charged for trying to sell drugs to a minor.
“Thank you, Dr. Cho,” Peter tells her truthfully. He’s glad he has somebody who could help him out with this, because all he just needs is proof.
“You look amazing,” Steve whispers at him. He puts his hand behind Tony’s head, turning it until they’re looking right at each other.
“I’m okay. Almost ready to come back home. Will you be at the tower when I get back?” Tony doesn’t really want to wait any longer to see him; but first he has to finish this thing for Steve. Of course, he can’t tell him that over the phone; he’s got no clue who might be listening in.
“What’s so special about a crashed ship?” Tony asks with a frown. He pulls away from Sharon to sit himself back down on the bed. Sharon takes place on the seat next to him and pulls up the files.
“We can binge-watch a series while I’m taking care of you. I have,“he started digging in his backpack again and pulled out some DVD’s, “Grey’s Anatomy, Supernatural or Rick and Morty!”
“She doesn’t- Tony! Why wouldn’t you tell her? I’m sure she’d understand,” Steve tried to argue. Tony just snorted bitterly before pulling out his phone, looking down at it to keep himself from looking at Steve, probably.
“Yes,” Raido and Yaël answered simultaneously, like it was extremely obvious. “It’s the beard,” Raido nodded. Yaël jockingly poked him in his side with her elbow.
“You know,” Korg raised his gun as the door slid open and checked the hallway before walking out of the control room “I just wonder, why would you feel the urge to, you know, make a statue of a man that didn’t even get through the first round. I know he wasn’t a match against you, but-uh-“
“So he’s being a bit extreme. We’ve faced extreme before, and we’ve always taken care of it. There’s no reason you can’t, now.”
“There’s demisexuals, which is what I am,” Petra says, pointing towards herself. “We do not feel any attraction until a strong emotional connection is built with our partner.”
“Hold your breath,” Tony instructs Steve, who has his eyes squeezed shut and turns his head against Tony’s shoulder to shield itself from the wind.
“Nah, I won’t be staying long, just headed for the workshop,” Peter returns. He takes off the mask and gives it another long look. It’s so weird in many ways.
“What’s it to you?” Peter grits out with difficulty. Flash grins even wider, lifting Peter up higher than before and preparing his fist. Great, Peter really didn’t miss this. He’d thought the guy had changed somehow. Clearly, he was wrong.
They arrive at the tower in record time. The moment they get to the floor, Tony’s team pull both Peter and MJ along into different rooms (Peter in his bedroom and MJ in the bathroom). Peter hasn’t seen Tony when he came in, but he figures the man is still in his own room, probably changing his clothes or something like that.
“Can I get a quick selfie before you head back there?” she asks. The crowd laughs, and Tony, too, can’t help but chuckle. As she points the camera at them, Tony turns to look at Steve, who looks back at him as well. Then, right when she takes the shot, the two give each other another quick peck on the lips.
Nonetheless, after that a lot happened. Tony got back in the suit, Pepper ended the relationship, Peter came into their lives.
“Oh my God, I can’t believe you’re making me have this conversation,” Steve had muttered, rolling his eyes and turning his head towards the window to avoid looking at her. “Look, I’m not… into men, alright? I’m just not… interested.”
They come across Michelle once. She just raises an eyebrow at him, gestures that she’s watching him, and then walks off again. Peter doesn’t let her get to him.
“AND NOW TO SHAKE THINGS UP, WE’RE NOT GOING FOR JUST TWO GUESTS. NO, THIS SUPERFAMILY IS NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF THEIR SUPER-SON, GIVE A WARM WELCOME FOR PETER STARK!”
"Steve, honey, can you check on Butterfingers and see what he's doing back there?" Tony asks. That's when Peter notices the noises from further away in the workshop. At the small bar, he can see movement from what seems like one of the bots, but what he's doing, he can't tell.
“Yeah, I was wondering if I could get a ride, maybe I can help out and all? Besides, I’ve always wanted to make a trip on Captain America’s motorcycle,” Peter jokes. The Captain sits up a little bit, but there’s a smirk on his face that gives Peter enough hope that he’ll accept his proposition.
“If we would get married, it’s just quick in city hall. Two signatures and that’s that,” Natasha says dryly before clearing her throat. Bucky then turns to look at her while nodding in agreement.
“I’ll, uh… I’m going to check if they’re alright,” Vision mutters out, leaving his spot on the table to head towards the direction Steve and Tony went to. They’ll explain to him what exactly the plan is, here. They only just need to wait, now.
How rude could a man be? Just hanging up on him like that? That’s just- Peter can’t even express how angry he’s suddenly feeling right now. Especially when he looks up to see the door leading back to the elevator open up, inviting Peter back inside.
“Please, your majesty. Tony will be fine,” Tony assures him. T’Challa laughs and then lets go to point towards a car.
“I love you, too, Tony,” Steve mutters out. The arms around his shoulders let go as Steve stumbles over his edge. He can’t help the small groan coming out of his mouth. He presses his head on Tony’s chest, feeling his heartbeat calming down under his ear.
“Nah, man, the bed is big enough for the two of us. Besides, we’ve had plenty of sleepovers when we were kids, after all!”
with that?!” Steve almost shouts. Tony, too, sits up before pulling the blanket back up to cover the two of them again.
Tony glares at his best friend, biting down the strong urge to punch him in the face. He ignores the sad looks he gets from the others, feeling only so close to kick everybody out.
By the time ‘somebody’ arrives, Peter has been on the couch for about half an hour. He’s not too surprised it’s Tony storming through the doors, insisting on seeing Peter.
What had she been thinking? She wasn’t normal, she would never be! Why did she hurt so many people? Yaël didn’t understand, her thoughts tumbled. As soon as she bought a few bottles, she started sprinting again, this time to her apartment. People looked at her, pointed at her, talked about, because she hurt their families, because she ruined their homes.
“Well, I preferred the red hair,” Tony says in honesty. Natasha looks back at him, unimpressed. Her once red curls now straightened out and bleached into a light platinum blonde. It’s been cut shorter again, and from afar, she would not be recognized. Probably, in combination with her identity mask, she can get away anywhere, despite being a wanted fugitive.
“It’s not that I’m not glad to see you, Gwen, but… this is all a little bit too strange,” Peter mutters out, looking back down at the suit. “I need to get to my Dad, have the guys find a way to get the suit off…”
“Alright, alright, I’ll put it down,” Reed says, making a gesture of surrender as he puts the thing down at last. Sue grins at winning once again. She leans to the side, putting her head on Reed’s shoulder and taking a bit of comfort close to him. A quick look at her finger, she once again catches a glimpse of her engagement ring. The wedding is supposed to be in a few weeks, and it’s mostly going to be a private matter. On Sue’s insistence, they’ve invited a few members of the Avengers, and normally everybody will be there.
“What day is it?” he asks, voice raspy. It’s mostly just breathy sounds, but somehow Peter understands him.
“If you can get the image of Charles biting you out of my head, sure,” Steve jokes. Then he gets back inside the room.
Steve rolled his eyes, attaching his helmet and securing the communicator into his ear afterwards. “That’s why I don’t ask,” he said.
“Are you sure you want to know the answer to this?” she then asks, suddenly completely serious. Peter just shrugs, realizing that she’s giving him the option to escape the answer. But even though he’s sure he doesn’t
But what’s he crying for? Is it the reminder that the thing that happened last night has only ever been done with Gwen before? The reminder that he’s a crappy friend, who can’t even put aside his own problems to make it up to the girl currently comforting him? Is it the fact that Harry is still stuck in the compound, not even closer on getting better from whatever has happened to him?
Yaël saw Loki sprint away to get some sort of crown from a man called Surtur. Well, it was clear that Yaël didn’t understand what the hell was going to happen and nobody had time to explain it to her. The only thing she did understand was that the Queen was walking towards them and she looked pissed off.
Peter thinks he's broken. When Steve and Tony feel out of their debt here, they ask Natasha for help, instead.
“What? Am I not fun enough for this mister Stark? Is he handsome by the way? Don’t look at me like that!” Steve glanced at her, his cheeks turned a bit reddish. When they arrived at the lift Steve pressed the button. This time there was no one sleeping between the doors, because the thing came immediately.
Steve doesn’t say anything in return. Instead, he puts his right hand on Tony’s back. Tony, in turn, puts his left hand on the back of Steve’s shoulder. They slowly sway along with the music, trying to get into it for a bit.
“Tony?” he asks. Tony shrugs and drops the glasses next to the bed, on the nightstand. Then he takes off his jacket and throws it onto the chair in the corner of the room.
“Holy shit, what an asshole!” Peter shouts out, uncaring if FRIDAY might hear it from inside. Mr. Stark can know, for all he cares! Peter just needed a breath, a bit of fresh air to clear his mind. All he gets is
“You, go back home. You’re taking the rest of the day off,” the man says, pointing towards Peter with his cellphone. Peter opens his mouth to protest, but Mr. Stark stops him. “I’ll arrange it with the school, you won’t lose any points over this. Just get back to your medication and take care of yourself for a bit.”
“Uh, I actually- I did make it, but it seems like I forgot it at work,” Peter starts to explain as he drops his bag on the ground again. “You see, I put it on my desk, but Mr. Stark’s robot set it aside and I forgot about it-“
“Thanks,” Peter breathes out, ending up in another coughing fit due to the sudden excitement. Then he looks up, eyes going wide.
“Right, is it okay for me to come by tomorrow? I could really use some sleep right now and I want to see how horrible you look in real life right now. I can’t stay too long, though…I need to do my shift of watching Tony.”
“My brain’s like a computer now. Just trying to make a connection,” he explains curtly. He squeezes his eyes shut while he tries to go through the last bit of effort. It’s almost like there’s a ‘ding’ going in his head when he succeeds.
“I don’t have a girlfriend, so no,” Clint throws back. “Steve, buddy, I know this sucks, but if you go back you put all of us in danger.”
Flash is lucky that his house is quite separated from the others, otherwise the police would have been here a lot earlier.
And Steve had blushed at that. “Uh, thanks,” he muttered. Once the chair was in front of Tony’s bed – Tony’s extremely
Suddenly, the smile left Wade’s face as he looked dead serious at the kid. “There is a spider in my pizza.”
Flash runs away from his post at the DJ-panel and runs up to Peter (or Spider-Man, more) and engulfs him in a strong hug. The stench of alcohol is strong on him.
“Shit,” he mutters out, rubbing his chest as usual. Carefully, he gets back on his feet. The three Avengers have already disappeared again. He needs another approach. Needs to avoid confronting Barnes and Natasha.
“You clearly didn’t help her enough, didn’t you?” Fury countered evenly.“And only the big guy upstairs knows what she will remember of that training of yours. But whatever, she doesn’t remember a thing, so here goes her second chance.”
He’d been planning on patrolling with Johnny, but eventually his friend had to bail for some international crisis, leaving the country with his teammates. Peter tries not to be too jealous about that.
one. MJ pulls away from him, and Peter gets on his feet to walk towards the window. Quickly, the others join him as well.
Ross responds. Then he hangs up the phone, and Tony hears nothing more than a beeping sound. Eventually, he lowers the phone and lets out another long sigh. Natasha squeezes his shoulder in response.
“Dude, that’s not cool. If we miss the movie because of you, you can be certain I’ll come back for you and web your hair into a new style, and it’ll be sticky,” Peter jokes. He’s not a bully, there’s no way he would actually do that. But Flash seems to understand the message enough. He takes another step back while still looking at Peter with what seems like fear and adoration at the same time.
It’s ten minutes into his break on the roof that he sees them; they come out of a fancy car that is parked in front of a pizzeria – the chances that they’d find someplace to park is even a wonder – dressed in clothing one would wear at a fancy party. Tony is coming out of the driver’s seat, hurrying towards the other side to open up the door for none other than Steve. He holds out his hand for the Captain to take, and then, like a gentleman, he helps his date out of the car.
“So you’re telling me that it’s my fault your friend doesn’t want to hang out with you?” Wow, that one hurt really bad. Was that what was going on? Did Peter just not want to be her friend? Did she annoy him or anything? Maybe she suffocated him by visiting him after pierced by the Green Goblin… . No, wait, maybe Tony was just trying to make her feel bad so she’d bugger off!
would his dad’s blood not work on him? It can only mean that his father isn’t really his father, right? Is that maybe why Mary teared out all those pages? Did those reveal his real father and didn’t she want her husband to ever know about that?
Nobody speaks. All they do is breathe heavily, touch each other’s bodies. Tony loses his pants after Steve lowered the kisses all the way down to his belly. When Steve takes off his, Tony isn’t sure. He’s not paying attention anymore.
“Alright, you just get that needle here,” she gestures right above the spot where an obvious blue vein is popping out already. “Don’t push the needle in too far, just… a few millimeters are enough.”
don’t like sex?” Peter asks after they’ve finished explaining. He turns towards Nat, searching for confirmation.
I've been slowing down on my writing lately. I really need to see Black Panther soon to get back into the hype, because we're getting dangerously close to the last chapter I've written (chapter 6!). But no worries, there's no way I'm dropping this story! :D
“But I want you to have that,” Peter returns, eyes stinging again. He tries really hard to keep himself from crying, feeling like he’s been doing that enough, lately. “I’ve talked it over with a friend and Aunt May yesterday during dinner. She’s okay with it.”
Peter almost drops the newspaper in surprise and horror at the same time. Why would she think that? Just because heroes work together doesn’t mean that said heroes are in a relationship, right?
“Don’t worry, you’ll get to go sight-seeing after we finish this. If I can make a suggestion; the Royal Gardens are a great place to start; especially around three in the afternoon.”
The Grandmaster probably had called him or something. Somehow, Yaël felt a bit sorry for Loki, being some kind of pleasure-slave. But on the other hand, Yaël knew Loki as being promiscuous, so he’d probably be able to handle this.
“Glad you noticed, Dad,” Peter jokes. “But now that I have your attention, there’s something I need to tell you guys.”
“Alright,” Bruce says. “We’ll call up a search party, but other than that I suggest we all just calm down for a bit, catch up on some sleep.”
The video starts trending, even outside of school. People who find it funny that a guy dressed in girl’s clothing is dancing, completely wet and drunk with a freaking umbrella in his hands, share the video the moment they’ve seen it, wanting the rest of the world to see it as well.
Yaël felt guilty, she shouldn’t be so harsh to him, of course this was all weird. She looked away, mentally cursing at herself. She should pick his side, always, right? Suddenly Steve grabbed her shoulder and pulled her against him, in a side-ways hug.
Wait a sec! Yaël turned her head back to the Hulk so quickly her neck hurt. Big green hands grabbing her leg and smashing her against the concrete flashed in her mind. She knew it had been an accident, at least that was what Cap had told her, but still, looking at the ginormous creature made Yaël swallow loudly.
“A kid who needs to follow the rules if he wants to take on the bad guys,” Ross counters. “You see, the only reason I’m here is because I was supposed to have a high-tech weapons-dealer in my custody. You see any high-tech weapons-dealer here?”
?” Iron Man says, and Peter’s mouth falls open from shock. How could Iron Man not know him by now? Then he hears a chuckle coming from Iron Man’s suit. “
“So, uh, with Felicia. You think I could try and make a move? She’s hot, you know,’ Johnny jokes. Peter shrugs in return, not really caring either way if Johnny would try and get into Felicia’s pants, as long as it doesn’t become awkward afterwards.
Everything is going remarkably well. Even after Tony pays for the dinner and they leave the restaurant to get back into the snowy landscape to head back to the hotel, the five of them can’t seem to stop their conversation.
“Steve, I’m Spider-Man! I’m Spider-Man!” Peter almost shouts. On the other side, he can hear Ned instructing him to go right, so he listens. “And I’m in pursuit. I can do this, but I can’t be too late!”
“Mr. Stark? Parker actually thinks he knows Iron Man?” Flash says from behind the classroom. All the other students start to laugh, but Mrs. Cooper – that’s the teacher’s name – doesn’t seem so amused.
“Cute little thing,” Tony points out. “Always knew you were one to adopt a dog rather than have any children.”
“Listen, it’s been fun to catch up, but I’ve got a plane to catch. Stark Industries-business, you know how it goes… I’ll see you another time, yeah?”
Tony turns around in surprise, not having heard Peter enter the room. He’s already in his sleeping wear, his hair messy and dark circles under his eyes. He looks tired, like he’s about ready for sleep.
Mary gets them to an elevator. Awkwardly they stand together, Tony’s hands clasp together in front of him while Mary leans against the wall.
“So,” Thor sighed. “King of Asgard.” With a little smile, he waved at his people behind him. Yaël was still getting used to his eyepatch. He managed to look even more like his father now.
“Well, that wasn’t what you two were saying yesterday before ending up in a lip-lock,” Tony suddenly interrupts. Everybody watches the man enter the penthouse again, his hands in his pockets and a wicked grin on his face. Steve’s not behind him, so Peter only figures he’s back in bed.
be Spider-Man. He already feels extremely guilty that he’s not protecting the streets due to his wound.
“Yeah, I’ve arranged the plane to take her to New Asgard. So far from what Jane has shown me they’ve built it up pretty nicely,” he explains. “Those Asgardians are incredible!”
“Yeah, apparently so. Though nobody wants to tell me where I’m from or how I got to be here. It’s so frustrating, I can’t remember anything, and everybody who knows just simply refuses to say anything!” Okay, maybe she just rambled a tiny bit, but luckily Peter just let it go instead of throwing her a stop-raging-glance.
“I don’t think we’ll ever completely understand your Dad, Peter. He might have convinced himself it’s okay to be
“Yes, you, in your thoughts, five times already in the two days we’ve been communicating like this,” he answered her a bit dryly, trying hard to hide his own grin. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re flirting with the five-decades-younger-version of me.”
“Kid, are you alright?” Cap suddenly asks. Peter opens his eyes again, not realizing that he’s closed them, and looks back towards the Super Soldier next to him. Peter holds up his hand to give him a thumb’s up.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks, looking confused. When it looks like James isn’t going to answer, he turns to Sam. Sam, who isn’t looking at Natasha at all, and who can’t see her warning glare.
“I guess we’ll never know now, shall we?” he asks. Then he pulls his hand back completely and reaches for his crutch, getting himself off the chair without any trouble. “Now how about I go search for that criminal of ours before Peter comes to rip me a new one?”
It’s taken a whole week for Aunt May to let him off the hook. That whole week, whenever he wasn’t at school or with Mr. Stark, Peter spent trying to help out in the apartment even more than before. He cleaned the floors, filtered his closet by throwing out the clothes he would never wear anymore, and did the dishes and laundry. In the morning, he sometimes even prepared some breakfast for Aunt May, that he would bring to her bed to surprise her.
“It’s not that abnormal, kid,” Nat then says. She walks up to the windows, looking down at the city underneath them. “When I was raised as the assassin that I was I… they taught me to use sex as a tool. Many of my peers liked it enough because they got at least a little bit of pleasure out of it.”
“He got knocked out during a fight, I couldn’t wake him up so I panicked,” he admits. Just two sighs coming up from the people with him. They’re clearly losing their patience. Tony doesn’t care.
Fury and Professor X then moved towards the door and before they left, Fury said: “Oh, and please prove to me that you’re a responsible, normal adult this time.”
He’s way beyond understanding at what must be his twelfth drink. The cup in his hand is just about a permanent accessory he’s carrying along, and the clothes he’s wearing more often than not goes flying into the crowd whenever another girl starts dancing with him. Now, only wearing his underwear and his shoes, Peter is once again dancing along on the beat.
But eventually, Christmas comes and goes, and so does the new year. With the new semester starting, Peter realizes that he’s going to have to start from scratch. So, he figures, he might as well just get a complete new slate.
Then he scratched his head and said: “Of course you did… Someone like you shouldn’t drink, Yaël. Maybe I have to warn Wade about that.”
Peter thinks bitterly to himself, but he doesn’t say it out loud. He doesn’t need another fight with her so soon after resolving the last one.
Natasha pulls away as if Tony’s skin is suddenly burning. With eyes open wide, she stares at him, her mouth fallen open. Just when she’s about to ask how he knows, Tony shakes his head.
“Eyes on the road, kid!” suddenly comes out as a warning, and Peter immediately turns his head back, seeing that a group of people is about to cross the road. Quickly, he hits the brakes, allowing them to pass.
“I like her,” Steve eventually says while they’re watching the Hobbits having fun in what looks like a tavern.
Eddie is shouting out things. Probably asking what’s going on. But Peter can’t hear it. And even if he could, he can’t explain it. Somewhere behind Peter, at the source of the sound, there’s Johnny with headphones on. He’s holding on to the device Peter told him to bring along, directing it at Eddie without any hesitation. He looks pissed in many ways.
Sometimes Mr. Stark asks him tricky questions, but so far Peter doesn’t seem to fall for them. When Peter is asked if he has a portfolio, the boy swallows before shrugging.
He keeps his mouth shut about their destination the entire ride, but it doesn’t take a genius to figure out they’re headed to Brooklyn. Steve, who seems about just as nervous as Tony is feeling, is practically jumping up and down his seat. What this guy’s fixation is with Brooklyn, Tony wonders if he’ll ever know.
“ pictures of her with the blue and the purple hair showed up. Momentums of when she went to the store, when she played cello and even when she got drunk in that bar with Wade a few weeks ago. “-
Michelle doesn’t look impressed at all. Peter doesn’t care; it’s not like he likes the messy-haired redhead. She’s mean, and constantly suspicious, and, and… he doesn’t know what else. Sure, she’s kind of pretty underneath that ‘i-don’t-care-bravado’ she has going on, but it’s mostly that attitude that puts Peter off.
days. Most of them filled with Tony roaming around the compound with Rhodey whenever Peter isn’t there. Sometimes they sparred, sometimes they played chess. There are few occasions Vision joined them, and the game would be a hopeless case since the android always won.
Cem stood in front of her one day, he made himself comfortable next to her and all she could do was cry. Once again he started braiding her hair, but this time he was whispering calming words in Sil.
There’s some mild distraction when working with Tony. Aside the constant questioning on who is going to get this suit and when they’re going to put everything together into one thing, the two get quite a lot of things ready until Tony even announces that it’s about it. He’s got nothing else planned to be added to it.
“Honey,” Tony says to get Steve’s attention. As the super soldier looks up, he smiles once he sees what Tony’s trying to do. He quickly leans forward, putting his head right next to Tony’s, his arms going around Tony’s waist.
Tony nods. “I was bitter for a long time,” he admits. “There’s a lot you took away from me, Mary. His first words, his first steps. His first day of school… those are all things I really wish I could have been a part of.”
Steve gets a small glare for that, but Tony doesn’t pull his hand away. Instead, he uses his fingers to squeeze Steve’s teasingly.
She hangs up the phone, and Peter drops it on his bed. As long as he’s wearing the mask with Karen inside, he has no need of carrying it along.
“Why are you helping me?” he asks in confusion. Wade just seems unsettled, worried, even, if Tony dares to call it so.
Ned lowers his bag slowly, approaching an empty desk in the classroom, and luckily picking a place which has a free spot behind him. Peter doesn’t speak, instead just sits down right behind him. Ned must think it weird, seeing as there’s so much place left in here, but Peter’s exactly where he wants to be.
“It’s just a replica!” Peter adds to it. Only, of course, that’s the moment where Tony decides to butt in, opening the door with his now empty cup of coffee in his one hand, and one of his new inventions in his other.
Steve and Yaël decided to walk around the big domain, enjoying some fresh air. It was quite cold outside, so they were both wearing their jackets and scarves. For a moment, they weren’t talking, just walking.
“Nah I don wanna right now,” Johnny explains, his language tainted by whatever he’s under the influence of. “Is always the same with one-night stands and Im tired.”
“Don’t tell me you have a ring hidden somewhere?” Tony asks, hating the panic in his voice. Steve chuckles nervously, but shakes his head.
“Bruce, Sam, Vision and James are in the waiting room,” Natasha confirms. “Wanda went back to her floor to wash up for a bit. She’ll be back in a while.”
The guard tilted her memory’s unconscious body outside. Yaël pulled on X’s hand so he’d follow her. They didn’t go through the hallways that led to the city, nor to the Royal Yard, no, they went to a dark corner that led to a lake. There, in the mud between the castle and the lake, the counselor watched how another guard had already shoveled a big hole out the dirt.
So Pepper tells him she wants to talk. And Tony avoids coming to the tower until the very last moment.
“Steve calm down for a bit,” Tony urges on. “In no way do I like this man, or agree in what he’s done. Even earlier he
At first Peter had wondered why Harry isn’t celebrating Christmas with MJ. He just grunted, saying something about ‘Too soon’ and ‘meet the parents’, and never mentioned it again afterwards. Peter doesn’t ask about it.
“I- uh,” he mumbles out. Then suddenly, he gets a slap on his shoulder. Turning around, he comes to face Ned, who is grinning excitedly.
“WHY DID YOU CLEAN THE TOILET WITH MY TOOTHBRUSH, WILSON?!” he growled from behind the door, his claws going downwards through the wood, blindly searching for Wade.
It’s Bucky who comes sitting next to him, followed by Natasha, Sam and Clint. After that, their row is filled. Behind them, Scott and Hope take place, along with T’Challa and Nakia, Okoye, Rhodey and May. Rhodey leans forward towards where Tony is sitting, tapping him on the shoulder and asking him something. Steve doesn’t listen to it. Instead, he turns towards Bucky.
Peter lowers his head as the image of a hand reaching out to his comes to mind. He takes a few deep breaths and leans forward, resting his hands on his knees. He can do this; it’s still Harry, somehow. He needs to find a way to get his friend back without hurting him too much.
“Get to the point, Stark,” Steve interrupted him when he realized that Tony was starting to ramble again.
“Something’s up between you two, isn’t there?” Hilde asked as she, once again, grabbed Yaël’s wheelchair.
Yaël totally didn’t like being called a piece of someone and every time some random guy she just danced with or had a drink with, said it, she got more and more annoyed.  So when someone laid his hand on her shoulder to pull her back to him, she snatched out of it and…accidentally used her powers. Being drunk made it way harder to control them.
The destruction in front of him is incredible. He can see Peter, his son, hanging in between two parts of the boat, trying to keep them together with his web, muscles straining under his suit.
“My mother used to make me this, back when I was sad or having a hard time,” Mr. Stark says, pointing towards the cup but not looking at Peter, instead keeping his head pointed towards the couch in front of him and sitting himself down on it. “It happened sometimes, that my dad got angry with me whenever I tried to show him something I made. My mother and Jarvis always stayed with me whenever that happened, of course.”
“Not this time,” Peter mutters, pointing his web-shooters in the Goblin’s direction and hitting him right in the face with his webs. A shout comes out of the Goblin’s mouth, and his stance on his glider seems compromised. The other heroes catch up on it, and everybody hurries back towards him almost at the same time.
Steve blushes after that, shuffling a bit in his seat. “It was when you’re mid-battle and can’t just take a toilet break, Tony.”
Harry’s been with models, actresses… Peter can’t really believe a guy like Harry would suddenly fall head over heels with a random high school girl, after all.
Tony has tasted love. Has known his mother telling him the three words. On some extremely rare occasions, even his father uttered them out, though that was mostly whenever Tony outdid himself in something scientific or whatever.
Steve nods. “It was, in fact. It was the first object he put a spell on, with his mother’s help. The family kept it as a loving memory. Sadly, Raido didn’t get that memo – you know, being a baby and all – and accidentally dropped it on the ground.”
Peter stays quiet the rest of the day. They make an agreement on when the others should come to study for that test, but other than that he just walks along and stays quiet. When school’s over, Peter waves them goodbye before walking away. Happy isn’t picking him up today, he’s going to get himself home this time.
“Yaël,” Steve said. She looked up and saw Cap giving her a dangerous stare. Great, he was going to play daddy Steve again? Yaël held her hands in the air and rolled her eyes. Sure, she reacted a bit sassy, but that she needed no protection from someone called Tony. That name didn’t sound horrifying at all and it belonged to the mystery-dad of her one friend and to the crush of her other one. So, the guy couldn’t be a complete monster, right?
“No! I’m not calming down! The only reason you’re not freaking out is because you were too busy with Otto’s wife to realize Peter had been knocked out to the point where he wouldn’t
The man is lying on his back, looking pretty much like he’s been thrown through a roof. Peter has no clue where he came from, but he’s sure Bruce can explain it after a while. He wants to hurry towards the man, but suddenly whatever orange light these men are producing, it’s stopping him from moving.
They take place on a chair, listening to the stories Peggy wants to tell Peter. There’s stuff about Steve, stuff about Daniel. And then there’s also (embarrassing) stuff about Tony when he was a kid. But Tony gives them that; he doesn’t want to ruin the good mood.
When she looked back at Raido, she saw him staring at Lopt with an untrusting shimmer in his eyes. “What is it?” she asked him, but she already knew the answer.
“There are some matters that I want to address to each of you,” Ross starts, taking his remote and starting up his speech. Nobody speaks, instead listening to the man. Once or twice, Sue has to kick Johnny in the leg whenever his attention starts to waver, but other than that there’s no trouble. And Ross speaks, about their accomplishments in the world, the way the people view them, what they’re called. Reed and Johnny smile proudly. Sue can only feel there’s something coming soon.
“It’s okay,” Tony said dryly, not at all sounding like he was okay with it. He probably just wanted to stop Steve’s rattling. A tense silence followed. Yaël couldn’t even look at the two men, she felt like she was an intruder in this conversation, even though it was about her.
“Dad! It’s me, Peter! Karen’s not connected to the suit anymore so I couldn’t call you, but I’m fine!” Peter turns to the girl, who is waiting patiently with her arms crossed and her legs tapping the ground. Her eyes are averted, stuck to the street next to them. “What happened after the fight? Did they clean up so fast? How did you not find me?”
Peter arrives only two minutes after Steve’s back. The way he walks in looks more like he hasn’t been gone for a few months, as if it was only yesterday that he’d been here. Of course, before he could speak Tony pulls him into his arms and almost squeezes so hard Peter can’t breathe.
“I believe that’s mine,” Hela turned back to Yaël and squeezed her throat a bit harder. “I demand you to put it back!” Yaël noticed Hela’s skin started to look like paper.
“Yes, I’m fine, m’am,” Peter responds nervously. “I’ve just… last time they tried to bring up the accords, things didn’t exactly go according to plan.”
Besides, it was easier to dislike Tony Stark for all the obvious reasons; he was self-centered, narcissist, egotistical, selfish… Huh, did he just use four synonyms to describe the guy?
“Tony,” Steve calls out for him. Of course, Tony can’t get no rest. He sighs, lowers his head and decides to just face the music.
“Come to think of it, letting those two handle the needles and stuff probably isn’t that great of an idea. I should better do that myself.” Tony stands up, getting to the medical supplies he has in the workshop. He’s already stocked up on whatever materials he needs for this, but to be honest he wouldn’t have thought he’d be alone when it finally came to it.
Nilla noticed that Yaël wasn’t paying attention, so she shuffled a bit closer. When Yaël looked up, she saw Nilla open her mouth in a very recognizable way. Yaël ducked and jumped away, towards the door as the flames surrounded her. Before she closed the door behind her, she heard her sister grumble and hiss. It was clear the woman wanted her dead. Yaël pulled out her card so the door got locked again. Then she noticed her lab coat’s sleeve was on fire around the shoulder.
,” as soon as the photograph showed up the screen, Yaël gasped and dropped the money she was holding ready to pay as soon as her sandwich was ready. There she was, on the screen, in front of a whole store, no wait, in front of the whole city. A fragment started playing. Someone had filmed her, clearly with a cellphone, seen by the terrible quality, floating down from some sort of… uh…spaceship. Beneath her, weird alien-looking creatures were attacking everything that crossed their paths. Yaël saw herself steering flames into buildings, freezing people, slowing people down by sending gigantic waves in which they tumbled away.
“Your peeps found anything yet?” he asks when he’s fully aware of the man standing next to him. Fury just breathes without saying anything, his hands behind his back and his eyepatch back in place. A couple of the New SHIELD-agents are filling up the place with their machines.
“Dude, not cool to mention her right now,” Flash says in a surprising sober, adult tone. Peter would have been confused at the way he’s defending him, but right now he doesn’t even care a bit. He clears his throat twice until it hurts before letting out a long, deep breath. It hurts in his chest.
Peter rolls to the ground to avoid another kick in the face. The impact on his shoulder is not pleasurable, but it beats the alternative. Then, seeing no other option, Peter pulls the mask off his head and throws it on the ground.
Tony, sitting in the back since he’s no longer really an Avenger, keeps his eyes on everybody in the room. He notices Rhodey, who is facing Ross completely, with his left elbow leaning on the table as he listels intently. He’s always been good at these type of things; briefings and debriefings. He can keep concentrated on all the boring stuff that is usually said. Right now, he seems in his element, despite the uneasiness that is easily read off him.
“Now, I wonder what makes you tick,” Peter mutters, turning back around to look at the desk. There he sees some sort of round device, with wires lying in the direction where the gauntlet had been. Huh, that must be the power source, right? Peter finds the lever again and opens up the gauntlet once more before taking the blueprints of the gauntlet that Mr. Stark left behind for him. What better way to find out how the thing ticks?
Peter smiles lightly before letting the first tear roll out of his eye. Tony panics; it wasn’t his intention to make the kid cry! He can’t comfort people, he’s horrible at it! Usually he just buys them presents and hopes that it distracts them from whatever happened.
“Shit!” Peter shouts, releasing everything when he realizes he won’t be in time at all. With a sharp movement, Peter tugs at the steering wheel, making the car turn with loud, screeching wheels. The figure that is Wolverine literally flies off the roof, landing onto the street, while the car seems to lose its contact with the ground.
Strange says before hanging up. Tony groans again, about ready to give up on this entire day. All he had planned for today was sex and nothing more…
But the girl – Yaël – just ignores him, instead getting up to get her own box. When she sits down on the couch, she gestures for Peter to follow her, which he does with his own dinner with him.
A suitcase is being thrown into the quinjet, quickly followed by another. Then, somebody steps on board.
“And I want the two of you to just listen to me,” Peter continues. “I just need honest answers, and I’ll tell you the exact same thing I told you in my universe.”
“Yes, we have,” he says. Then, suddenly, a smile appears on Loki’s face. Whether it’s genuine or not, Steve has no idea.
there. There are no scientists, no cleaning crew. Even though the quinjet is still outside, there’s no Avenger to be seen. All his senses tell him that this is not okay, and that there’s something wrong, but on the other hand; this is the Avengers he’s talking about. Surely, nothing happened.
“You should have learned, after what happened with Gwen,” he answers. Then he lets the Glider move forward again, taking Peter away from Stark Tower.
“Can you take it off? So I could have a look at it perhaps?” Tony asks. Peter shrugs, standing up from his bed and pressing on the same spot he always does to take it off.
“You can keep secrets, right?” he suddenly asks Helen Cho, who has by now pulled out eight shards. She looks up with raised eyebrows, and then nods quickly.
“C’mon, we’re wasting time here,” the guy says. Peter nods, quickly following him out. Without saying anything else, the man guides him out of the school and onto the parking lot, where he seems to make his way to what looks like a very expensive
“Yeah, fine, next time I’ll wait to die until you’re by my side, how’s that?” he jokes, rubbing his shoulder. Sharon punches him again.
Tony stirs next to Peter. The teenager jumps up, shifting in his seat until he’s leaning closer to Tony. His breath evens out again, but he seems agitated in his sleep.
“Oh, hi dads! Did you three have fun?” Peter asks, quickly reaching towards Annie and taking her over from Steve.
Tony turns around in confusion, seeing the pensive look on Mary’s face. He’s about to ask what she means when she continues.
Once Eddie’s pulled free, Peter webs him up against the wall, making sure that he’s not going to run off.
Steve pulls away after Tony starts pushing against his chest. Opening his eyes again, Tony finds Peter standing there, completely in his suit and ready for the battle. He looks eager, active… Alive…
Tony’s hands pull back, and suddenly he’s shifting. He forces himself to sit up again, taking a few seconds to catch his breath before he stands up. Meanwhile, Steve comes up as well, frowning at Tony.
Mr. Stark might behave like there’s nothing wrong right now, but Peter saw him yesterday. Even if it was the alcohol mostly talking for him, whatever he spoke about must be something that is bothering him to this day.
Eddie is still talking to Flash, probably painfully sober in comparison to the others. Peter takes a short step forward to get in between them, but almost falls over the moment he stands still.
“Spare me. I hate saying this, but I think you might have been the only one to agree with me about it all,” Tony admits. He pulls off his sunglasses and crosses his arms together to look at Fury, finding one serious, dark eye looking back at him. “Why
And everything froze again. Yaël turned her eyes and stopped walking since Raidowasn’t able to follow her anymore.
And in one hand, he realizes that he might regret this sooner or later, but right now… he can’t really have Tony interfering again. Whatever his reasons are not to want him pursuing this man, he’s severely underestimating Peter’s powers. How does everybody seem to keep on forgetting the Lizard or Electro?
“Hey, Peter, isn’t that your Dad with my brother?” Shuri suddenly asks, pointing to somewhere over Peter’s shoulder. When he looks behind him, he indeed sees Tony walk there in the crowd of people, accompanied by the King, Bruce and Rhodey. Just a group of guys, causing for a lot of jaws to drop once they’re noticed.
“What was that all about?” Peter grinned as soon as Jason was out of earshot. “Shut up, Peter!” Yaël grumbled.
“Okay, I’m going to need your help now,” comes from Mr. Stark after the few introductions have been done. Peter follows him into a hallway that he’s never been in before, and suddenly finds himself in what must be a workshop of some sort. It seems a bit more advanced than everything Peter has to work with at the Tower, and as he’s looking at everything, he suddenly finds himself extremely inspired.
There’s been so many blood tests, even arterial blood has been taken. Spit, urine, whatever else they could find. Peter had been unconscious the entire time, which seemed to be the biggest thing worrying Helen other than the major fever he seems to be having.
“Well… neither can I. So I suppose we’re stuck with each other, aren’t we?” Steve says, trying to joke about it, but the humor escapes both of them. The man puts his hands on Tony’s back and pulls him closer.
“I haven’t spoken to Peter for the past two weeks,” he suddenly says. Natasha’s eyes open up wide in surprise at the sudden revelation.
Peter sighs, deciding that he’s just going to be himself. There’s no big deal, it’s just to do homework, make sure MJ understands the subject for the test tomorrow. Nothing more needs come out of this, after all.
And then he realizes why the two have taken separate places. Is it possible that… Steve… is ashamed to be seen with a man? Peter knows it’s been an issue a few months back when they first went to visit Peggy in the home.
“Well, my first guess would have been that you’re showing symptoms of a spider bite. The muscle pain, the difficulty of breathing, sweating, headache and all the other stuff, it’s very normal after particular spider-bites.”
“I, uh, I don’t have a passport or anything,” Peter adds, uncertainly. Tony just snorts then, finally facing him with the dark brown eyes Peter has come to known as his own.
"Grab a gun and we'll put together a strategy!" he says. The rest of his team nods and hurries to take a weapon. Natasha just rolls her eyes but follows anyway. That's when Tony turns towards his own teammates. He hands Peter his gun before quickly explaining to him how it works.
“The seconds. They remind me of the bell tower where Gwen-“ Peter starts, but he doesn’t finish the sentence. It’s probably clear enough, anyway. “I heard it ticking all the time, and it became too much.”
Johnny’s not online, neither are Ned, Yaël and Harry. Wanda doesn’t have the app, and Peter’s not about to message Wade about how bored he is. With his luck, the idiot might actually appear at his window, trying to get in his pants again.
Yaël purposely hadn’t used any fire in the park, because she already had a cold from acting like a boiler for her home. She should thank the professor, but she didn’t know how. Maybe he’d just know how grateful she was, or maybe he’d be disappointed in her, just like Steve, for not thanking him. Right when Yaël felt a bit relaxed, she started panicking again. Yaël took a sponge and started cleaning the table as she heard a knock on the door. At that point, she really wished that the old, moldy building she lived in had some sort of intercom so she’d know when someone came to visit her and who it was.
After she pulled off the pants and other clothing, Yaël grabbed the fringe of her shirt. Oh, she was so not ready for this, but it was like ripping off a bandage, right? As quick as she could, she pulled her shirt over her head and threw it on the ground, biting in her fist not to scream out of pain. She leaned her forehead against the cold door, waiting until the stinging pain calmed a bit. This had been her worst idea ever.
“No, everything’s fine,” he answers. “Everything’s great, even,” he admits. Steve, in turn, curls up the corners of his lips as well before lifting up his hands from the water and throwing some drops towards Tony.
But despite the easiness he’s feeling right now, he knows the problem still lingers; Steve will still be in constant battle within his own mind, Tony will keep on taking it personally, and they will fight about it eventually.
“Whazzit tyou?” Mr. Stark’s slurred voice asks. Peter’s heart breaks a little, especially when he thinks back of yesterday, the way Mr. Stark assure Steve that he was fine.
“Hey, as a father I feel like it’s my job to make bad jokes,” Tony counters. Peter smiles, liking how easily Tony has adapted himself into the job of fatherhood. It hasn’t been that hard for Peter, either.
“Do you need me to? I wouldn’t mind, but there’s still someone who needs me at the compound,” Steve says. Peter doesn’t need to guess to know who he’s talking about. As far as he can make out, Mr. Stark isn’t doing so well at the moment.
He hears footsteps half a minute before there’s a knock on the door. By the sound of the heels, he figures it’s probably Sharon given how fast she’s walking. She’s called a little while earlier, but she couldn’t come back yet. Tony didn’t blame her for it; she was on a SHIELD-mission and she couldn’t compromise it. Though she came close to it, he thinks.
“I’m so sorry, Peter. I just get so confused all the time,” he admits. “People shouldn’t be taking care of their fathers like this.”
“I have given you an order, Spider-Man,” Captain America warns him. Peter drops his arms down, giving the two of them a long look before shaking his head.
after all. They may not be related by blood, but the guy’s basically Tony’s brother. Instead, Tony receives a grin from the soldier and a wink. A hidden way for them to wish each other luck – though it’s not
When he opens his eyes, he’s faced with shocked expressions from Natasha, Clint and Cho, who have all three of them taken a step back. Looking down at his own body, Tony sees that, indeed, he’s covered by the armor. He throws his friends a wide grin, proud of his creation.
Natasha doesn’t say anything, instead just keeping her gaze on him with a blunt look on her face. It’s like she’s studying him, waiting for him to say anything on his own accord.
May gives him a smile, looking relieved when she sees him awake. Peter, too, feels a whole lot of relief.
Peter bites his lip, realizing MJ is starting to walk up to him. “No, there isn’t,” he says weakly. When she’s standing right in front of him, she pulls up her polaroid and snaps a shot of him without warning him. After that, she starts laughing, taking a few steps back.
“HE DID THIS, HE’S CRAZY!” Of course, Wade totally didn’t do that, but these five drunk men felt certain he did just so they couldn’t take Yaël home.
Though Steve noticed a bitterness in her voice. He knew Pepper hadn’t reacted too well about the new suits, and the Iron Legion. She had even returned to Malibu for a few weeks after the repairs were done. The only reason she was in New York right now was because of a series of business-meetings she had to attend as CEO of Stark Industries.
“In his childhood, for years, Tony Stark has been taught about the legendary Captain America. The man had become his idol when he was little, and he aspired to be like him. And do you know what his father told him when he hit puberty?”
These are also posted on my tumblr. You can find them at this link: http://beingastark.tumblr.com/tagged/instaspidey
He arrives only right on time it seems. The moment he opens up the door, he finds Johnny standing right in front of the elevator, sporting his longish hair back wearing a black leather jacket. Something that looks rather expensive.
But still, Yaël kept freaking out. Like she had done many times towards him. A loud shriek next to her, didn’t really help. It made her jump and look to her right, pulling herself from Loki’s touch, ready to attack.
what it felt like for me? To hold my dead son’s body in my arms? To see him lying there on the ground with no life left in him? Losing my parents was hard, but the idea that my
Peter nods. “Listen, Eddie, you need to get out of here as fast as you can. There’s something extremely dangerous running around here, and I’m pretty sure it’s the reason why you’re here.”
“I know,” Steve returns, suddenly giving him a small grin. “At least that way I’m sure you’re not going to run off again.”
Besides, he looks extremely happy with MJ. And while the pair might not celebrate Christmas together, they have plans for New Year. Ned and Peter are joining them, after all. He might even try and ask if the others want to join as well.
Peter shrugs in return. “Not really”, he mutters. His brain has been doing worse on the matter of ‘going overdrive’. This right here is not
“I know, and I can’t come up with any excuse as to what I could possibly be doing here,” he admits. Harry takes a few steps forward and then puts a hand on Peter’s shoulder.
Okay, at least they’re not lethal, Peter thinks to himself. He looks up, trying to find the source of the arrow but not seeing Clint anywhere near. Of course, the guy is a master spy; he can hide himself just about everywhere.
Now, having hung up the phone after saying goodbye, Peter checks his movement. His ribs don’t hurt as much anymore, so he figures he’s about ready to head out at last. He walks up to his room, fishes the suit off the ground to put it back on and takes a deep breath.
“I got my eyes opened,” Tony says truthfully. He turns to smile at her, sadly. “I wish I could tell you everything but so much has happened.”
“How come you haven’t escaped yet?” Yaël didn’t even have the energy to scare up from the sudden, recognizable voice. She just tilted her head to look Loki in the eyes.
Right now, there’s no mission. Unless the mission is not getting your ass kicked by the other team. They’re playing some sort of dodgeball, though they’re free to use their powers and gadgets as they please. Who even comes up with these exercises needs to have their head checked, but Peter’s not going to complain. Dodgeball where he gets to use his powers is better than original dodgeball where he’s always getting himself hit as the first one to appear stupid.
Then the camera points at two figures. There are voices raised, almost louder than all the others. It’s not immediately clear what they’re talking about. When Peter squints, he can see himself still wearing that uniform from when he was dancing. His face turns red immediately, and Yaël snorts again.
“Ms. Thompson, I’m finished with the weeds. Would you like me to help you with something else?” she yelled. The Thompsons always left the backdoor open so Yaël wouldn’t have to walk in with her muddy shoes to talk to them. Mrs. Thompson brought Yaël some fresh, cold lemonade and after that, Yaël mowed the lawn.
“So, uh, you have a son now?” he asks. “And, uh, a new liver? Remind me again why you’re not at the hospital if the surgery was only five days ago?”
“Rogers, have you finally decided on the mascot of the team?” Fury asks all of the sudden. Tony glares at him, realizing well enough that the guy can’t see it.
She wipes away the tears from her cheek before clearing her throat. Then she gets on her feet with the vials of blood in her hands. Nearing the holder of Richard’s samples, she makes to exchange them with quiet movements. Tony just watches from where he’s seated, figuring that this makes the job done, then. He should be safe to head on home, now.
Once again, the crowd starts cheering, almost breaking Tony’s ears. He grins, taking a few steps back while he sees Steve awkwardly move forward, keeping a hand above his eyes to cancel out the light. He waves at the people awkwardly before Tony pushes him forward a bit. Nodding towards the public, Steve seems to understand what he means.
“Wait, models? That’s a story I need to hear,” Ned butts in. Harry blinks then, gives Ned a short look, and then starts grinning.
Steve then frowns again, looking even more confused than before. Lowering his water bottle, he shakes his head.
"Hey, Dad, what's this?" Peter asks, recognizing Tony's handwriting immediately. He takes the post-it and holds it up towards his father, who gives it a short look. Steve then takes it from Peter to inspect it as well.
Peter nods. It could do good to escape from all these people. He does consider the family, warning them about stepping out for a moment before actually going. Steve and May seem worried. Tony just nods and hugs him shortly.
Well, Yaël hadn’t seen the two men anymore and it was two days after that grumpy text she got from Fury. She hadn’t seen them in two weeks and she had the feeling that these two were busy and important men. She probably was no priority to them…
is the thing that Peter hears on the other side of the phone the moment Tony picks up. Relieved to hear his dad’s voice, Peter lets out a shaky laugh.
Tony smiles, slowly getting up. In turn, Steve gets on his feet as well, though still holding on to Tony with his strong arms.
Loki stopped, but Yaël noticed the tension in his shoulders immediately. She knew this had always been a very delicate subject to him. A shock went through the ship, people yelled commandos at each other.
“Th-thank you, sir,” Peter mutters, unsure whether he should call him Cap or Mr. Rogers. Surely, Steve would be too bold of him. After receiving a nod from the man, Peter hurries inside and drops down his skateboard and bag. Then he shrugs off his coat, which is barely wet since it stopped raining ten minutes into his trip.
“Do you really think Vision would fight back against Wanda? Anyway, where are you?” If he was around, she’d be able to pick him up and take him with her, if he wanted to.
“Tony, I know,” Steve starts, holding up his hands in surrender. “I know you were startled, but you’re out of control.”
Once at home, there had been another fight. Peter ran off, Uncle Ben followed him. Peter didn’t stop a theft in the shop he was at, and said thief ended up shooting his Uncle after he tried to stop him.
“I cannot explain everything in just five minutes!” Thor calls out, suddenly panicking again. His large hands reach up into his hair, and he starts pacing the room nervously. Steve watches him for a few seconds before clearing his throat.
“Pick my battles wisely? Did you guys get to choose in the invasion? Did you guys get too choose when Thanos arrived on Earth? I didn’t see you guys
The twitch in her eyes seems to have caught Norman’s attention, who starts to turn around to see what Mary’s looking at. There’s a short moment of panic before Mary almost shouts it out and reaches for Norman’s arm.
“Uh,” Peter starts, but then he closes his mouth. What’s he supposed to say here? That he ended up panicking because his mentor decided to install a clock? Stark’s just going to laugh in his face, that’s what’s going to happen! “I’ll just get back inside.”
“Tony, I didn’t come to just chat,” Steve interrupts him mid-speech. Tony closes his mouth and puts down the device in his hand. Then he lifts up the mask while leaning back in his seat.
“What does that make me?” Ben asks from a little further away. Tony startles upon hearing his voice roar out. Facing the fourth member of the Fantastic Four, he bows forward a bit.
“Steve?” Tony breathes out, his voice suddenly cracking. Peter barely even reacts to it. Instead, he takes the moment of distraction as the exact thing he needs right now. He looks back at the window, figuring it might hurt a little bit. But it’s worth it. He takes a deep breath, waits for everybody to walk out a they search for Steve.
“FRI, can you pass the message about the stolen things to Dr. Octavius, tell him the team is working on catching the thief?”
“I just, I found blood on the floor, and I followed it to the bathroom but the door was locked and Tony changed my overrides so I couldn’t get in. I had to break the door and Tony is on the floor and he’s unconscious and I can’t wake him up but he’s breathing and-“
“He left about an hour ago, I sent him to bed. He stayed up the entire night again, switching in looking after you and helping out Bruce. Natasha’s asleep on the couch. James is with Tony.”
“No, I didn’t. Look, Tony, it was an emergency. Her apartment exploded, she could’ve been dead! It took Wade hours to find her and if he didn’t she-”
“Can you ask Dr. Cho for more painkillers?” he asks, and Steve nods before leaving the room again. Peter doesn’t think he needs more against the pain, but when he tries to shuffle again in his bed, he quickly realizes that, yes, he needs more.
“Sometimes I think we’re just doomed to be constantly misunderstanding each other,” Tony then admits. “You do something, I don’t agree. I do something, you don’t agree. It’s been like this for a few months now… What are we doing here, Steve?”
Peter hesitates, but does as he’s told. Happy types in the address into the gps-system that has been installed in the car by Tony himself and then starts driving, continuously keeping his eyes locked on the road but still attempting to check out what is happening in the back.
Tony frowns, turning around to see the door opening. Charles probably saw it coming, probably heard whoever it was before they even made to open the door. But coming inside is Wade Wilson, dressed in his normal clothing. The hood of his sweatshirt is pulled up over his head, and his hands are hidden in his pockets.
Peter doesn’t respond. They get under a bower, illuminated by candles that don’t seem bothered about the snow. In the middle of the room there’s a stand, something made of rock and covered with gold and jewels. On the center of the circle, for some reason, lies a very familiar hammer.
Tony can see that he’s making Steve speechless, but he needs the guy to understand. Needs Steve to believe him, make sure Steve knows he’s not crazy.
“It’s fine, Cap,” he says. Then he tightens his grip on his backpack, and nods once more towards Steve the moment they’re standing in front of the door. “I’m glad you’re trying to help him, by the way. He may not realize it, but he needs you more than either of you think.”
She greets her co-workers, glad to see everybody again. Sure, the past year has been strange with her mostly disappearing to Norway or Wakanda or many other places. Now that all that crazy stuff is finally over, she finds it’s easy to get back to the normality in life.
It’s evening, only an hour after they’ve managed to get rid of Venom as Peter came to call it. It’s locked up, put safely away in Tony’s lab where they’ll deal with it in a bit. Right now, though, it seems like everybody just needs a moment to breathe. So after the Avengers have returned from Strange’s, and everybody’s up to date with everything, the group disbands for the evening. Rhodey, Barnes and Natasha are the first to get back down, wishing everybody goodnight before they head towards the elevator. Vision is next, immediately followed by Wanda. Clint and Sam take a moment longer to get rid of, but eventually, they, too, head downstairs.
So Yaël made up her mind, she’d look him in the face. She’d look him in the face and after that she’d make up her mind about him. Because she wasn’t like him, she was going to give him a second chance.
“Drunk asshole,” he mutters, turning his back towards Johnny and closing the door behind him. The guy’s going to have a hangover and probably some memory-loss, but it’s about what he deserves. Peter tries not to think too much about him before he gets to his own room and quickly pulls off his clothes but leaving on his underwear. He throws everything down on the ground, telling himself he’ll clean it up tomorrow. Then, with the lamp still on, he lies down on the bed and picks up the picture MJ took yesterday, giving it a quick look.
“You didn’t tell him?!” Yaël tried to look Steve in the eye, but he didn’t look at her, he only stared back at Tony.
But then his eyes fall onto a security-badge lying next to his pencils. There he can read the name ‘Lincoln Jones’ on it. The guy doesn’t notice it, though, eyes instead focused on the screen.
Peter feels his insides warm up at the confession; Steve cares about him! But in what way? As just a random friend way? Or… maybe more? Would it be too much hope for Peter to have the Captain see him as a son of his own? That he would not only gain one father, but two of them? That would be too lucky, now, would it?
“Clint is helping us out. I made him, I know he doesn’t really want you to leave but he never says no to me.” With another quick look at the windows they see the guards all running towards where Clint must be. Leaving the garden house unattended, the two prepare to get out again. “You, first you silence that phone of yours.”
Arriving at the Sanctum in record time, Tony doesn’t even need to knock on the door before it opens and a very annoyed Stephen Strange stands in front of him.
“Sure, come on!” The kid pulls Peter along towards the line. He gets a lot more cheers once the others see him as well. He’s pretty loved in here, and he wishes he could do more to help them. He needs to talk to Tony about it one day.
So Tony simply keeps quiet, nodding towards Peter’s house and forcing up a fake but hopefully convincing smile.
It’s followed by a knock on their door. Both Steve and Tony jump out of bed to put on at least a little bit of clothing.
Yaël got up and put the disc in the DVD-player and turned on the TV. She gave Peter a bowl of ice and a spoon.
“It’s that time, then?” Steve asks. Tony just nods, glad that he’s not beating around the bush. He’s told Cap multiple times about his fear of Pepper leaving him, though it had mostly been jokingly. Still, Steve knows when Tony’s being serious and when not; they’ve spent enough time together right now to understand each other on that matter.
Loki looked up at the bolder and grinned through his messy hair. “What a shame for the Grandmaster that he missed the opportunity to see more of your excellent fighting,” he smirked.
Luckily Yaël was still in a very low ranked cell. She had noticed the Grandmaster didn’t take those gladiators very seriously as the cells weren’t extremely secured. Of course, the things were water- and fireproof, but the locks weren’t that hard to open if you had the chance to potter with them a bit. Despite that the lock had a very complex pattern to crack.
“It was alright! Johnny and I got lost on the way to the main building, but a girl pointed us the way. After that, it was mostly just introduction and a welcome-barbecue,” Peter explains.
one and only Iron Man,” Wade’s voice suddenly says from behind them. The two turn around in a quick surprise, though Yaël seems to jump a bit more than Peter does. To be honest, in his time as Spider-Man, Peter has quite grown used to the guy popping in during the most random moments.
“But, come on, you have the body for it!” Yaël was kind of getting sick of hearing that, apparently, she didn’t look too bad. He never saw her with her clothes off (eh, right?), how could he know? But she sighed it away, no she couldn’t be grumpy about that, it was a compliment.
At eight, Happy arrives to take Peter back home and Tony heads to the gym to work a bit on his sparring with Rhodey. At midnight, surprisingly, Tony goes to bed, more tired than he’d imagined. The moment he lies down, he’s gone, lulled into a deep sleep, only to be awakened again five hours later when he hears the Quinjet land on the platform.
But, of course, he can’t catch a break. So he decides to head back. Steve followed him all the way back. So did Rhodey and Bruce. And, of course, nobody should forget Peter, who now has a Mantis tagging along the entire time to make sure that he’s still alright.
Getting to his chopper, he’s followed by a suspicious looking Thaddeus Ross, who is doing the exact opposite of laughing.
Following the directions the way he remembers them, he finds himself in front of a reinforced door. He knows what’s behind there, but he’s never been inside. Carefully, Peter holds up his hand to the doorknob and tries turning it around.
Mary nears Peter first. She leans forward and kisses his forehead, making him squirm a bit in his sleep. For a moment, Tony fears that they woke him up, but when he sleeps on peacefully his heart stills a bit.
My issue is that I wanted to post about 3 chapters a week, BUT then the Christmas-chapter will be posted WEEKS after christmas...
really suit you,” somebody jokes, and then everybody laughs again. While grunting, Flash starts to stand up again. He sounds a bit breathless, leaning against one of his palls as he turns back towards Peter.
Peter shakes his head. “I didn’t steal anybody!” he shouts back. “You and Gwen had already broken up! I’m not even
“Can you please ask FRIDAY to prepare the suit? I need to fly him out of here,” Steve says. Peter nods with an effort, but before he can open his mouth, FRIDAY already answers for him.
Yeah, that just stays uncomfortable no matter how many times Peter’s going to hear it. He starts taking a few steps back, realizing that this is the part where they started working it out themselves. He nods towards Gwen as well.
“I know, it’s just… Nobody really knows a lot about Spider-Man, and this Cat-person just really came out of nowhere and…” Peter scratches his hair, trying to ignore that weird feeling going through him at the idea of him together with the Cat. Shit, he doesn’t even know her damn name, while she’s been calling him Bee for the past few days.
“Son of a…” Peter mutters, seeing his vision blur and a hard sting going through his head. There are tears welling in his eyes, and he’s sure he’s bleeding in a few places.
“This supposed father of yours; will you tell him of your Super-hero alter ego?” she asks in curiosity. Peter huffs, regretting it immediately when she slaps him lightly on the shoulder to keep him still.
So, yeah, maybe Tony might have a little collection of his relationship with Steve stashed somewhere in his hard-drive. It’s actually quite lucky that the back-up is stored in his mind as well.
Even now, Peter doesn’t desire much else other than friendship when he thinks of her. And yet now, he’s not sure
! And I failed! I lost one of the most important person in my life. And you’re telling me that there’s a way for me to have him back, but you just won’t do it because the world might explode? IT’LL EXPLODE NONETHELESS!”
His hair is a mess. It’ll probably always be a mess. He gives it no attention, checking out his face instead. There
The ‘trainingroom’ had been a complete hell. The Chitauri had pushed her to use her powers and as soon as they noticed she didn’t know how these worked yet, they started pushing her buttons even more. First, they tried physical pain, knocking and kicking her until they had to bring her back to her room because she didn’t move anymore. After that, they tried mental torture. The Chitauri reconstructed Raido and Cem’s death somehow, she surely didn’t get how the technology worked, and made her watch it over and over again. But the more they tried getting to her, the more she started pushing back. With every hit they gave her, she escaped from the grip and stumped someone right in the face. Every time she saw the screens turn on, she closed her eyes and started singing loudly. Sometimes Loki walked in and watched it for a second, calmly, with his hands against his back, just to walk out again.
Around eight in the evening the day before they have to leave for New Asgard, it’s once again Tony’s turn to look after Peter. Today might have been
“Cap, honestly, stop hovering like this. I’m taking my pills, I’m following the sessions with Dr. Whatshername-“
“As you probably know, Peter, who is also your dear son, is my friend. He’s a swell kid, but I don’t see him all that often. Obviously, I kind of miss him, you know. He doesn’t have a lot of time since he started his internship here.”
It’s weird to hear her voice again. Tony leans forward a bit, trying to capture what he’s seeing in front of him, but reminding himself that she’s no longer there.
“No, I’ll get her!” he says before thinking of it. Immediately everybody on the couch makes a knowing sound, Harry and Ned throwing their fists in the air to accentuate it.
Now, to be honest, Tony can’t remember Otto that much. Sure, they went to the same school together, but let’s face it, Tony was never really sober most of the classes they’d shared. He remembers Otto saying something about clean energy, but that’s about it. He would have thought Otto would have let it go since Tony has Arc Reactor energy already taking care of that.
The person next to him shifts. Tony doesn’t yet open his eyes. He needs some more sleep before he faces the day. He has no idea what exactly happened since yesterday; why is he lying in bed next to Steve when yesterday Steve was still in New Asgard? He lets out a long breath, not wanting to deal with it just yet.
After making a quick stop in the tower to get some clothes for Peter, Tony personally drives him back to Queens.
“You can try as much as you want, this bird is not singing,” Tony says, pressing his lips tightly together. Steve looks up with a grin.
Tony counters. Peter glares at him. They both know there’s no Avengers to speak of. Come to think of it…
“The kid can’t take much more. Got depression and PTSD, barely got any money, and an Aunt that works day and night to provide for him.”
“Peter? Get back here!” Tony shouts behind him, sounding angry. Peter jumps in surprise, and so does MJ. They see Tony nearing them with his mask lowered. “Are you two crazy? You can’t be here!”
“I can’t help you if you don’t tell me, kid,” Mr. Stark adds. Peter blinks a few times, turning his head to the side in an attempt to avoid his gaze upon his own.
reason as to why Tony would keep his trap shut about it all. What change is it going to bring into Peter? He already
They call for another break after every hour. It’s the perfect occasion for a toilet visit, or to get another cup of coffee. Sharon once takes the moment to hurry towards Tony and ask him something Peter can’t hear. He doesn’t think it’s important since she hurries off again not five seconds afterwards.
And the craziest part about it? Flash doesn’t instantly start insulting him. Instead, Peter gets to hear a story of Flash’ adoration of Spider-Man, out of all the heroes. Of course, Peter’s only listening in little bits, his attention drawn to Felicia who has somehow also appeared at one point. He grins when he sees Johnny has lost the interest in the art-student, and instead he and Felicia are dancing together. Closely. He averts his eyes when she gives him a long look with those blue eyes of hers.
“So that’s why Thor and the Guardians already knew me, isn’t it?” Peter then asks. “They had all met me before during that fight?”
“Holy cow,” Peter mutters, taking in the multiple armors standing on display behind glass, lights shining on them.
There’s pictures of the crash site, a ship as big as Stark Tower itself, landed on an open field. There’s smoke everywhere, people being evacuated away from it, dressed in clothing that don’t seem from this century.
“Couldn’t even give him a hint, couldn’t you?” Tony mutters to himself. He, of course, recognizes the blonde haircut and is aware Natasha owns the face-mask. “Where’s Peter now?”
The boy seemed to startle. Almost seeming afraid, he looked back and Yaël saw his face turn red.People were looking up curiously and stare at the young boy. Poor soul, being stalked by Wade in such a public place.
At one point during the party, Peter took out his phone and texted Yaël once more, this time about where he currently is. It’s possible that he’s misspelled a few words, but he’s sure the girl can figure out what he means on her own.
Peter walks through the front door as if nothing ever happened. He shouldn’t be surprised that both Johnny and MJ are seated on the couch, both with controllers in their hands while racing each other in Johnny’s silly game. Peter smirks when he sees it, realizing they haven’t heard him enter.
MJ and Peter follow Tony back outside. After that, they wait for Happy to arrive and bring Ned and MJ back to their houses. Tony drives Harry and Peter back to the tower, where he allows a now-informed Bruce to look after his cuts and scrapes.
“And I wanted you to be better,” Tony responds. Then he shakes his head; better to break the bad news. “The big people aren’t happy. There are consequences, both for you and me.”
feelings from her side if they actually drunkenly slept together. In any way, Peter knows that he doesn’t particularly feel anything
But, when Peter is hugged so tightly that he would think he’d never be freed again, the only thing that crosses his mind is that
“Holy crap, I’m so sorry!” he starts, already reaching out for the other person to help him, only to see that it’s Ned.
alcohol! I’ll be the designated driver, I just want to see Clint and Sam getting shit-faced at last!” Tony grins towards Peter, winking at him. Peter, too, snorts. It
“I don’t know! I’ve been breaking my head about this but I just can’t get to a simple plan,” Peter confesses in annoyance. He kicks away a little stone from the ground, and when it lands in the water the ducks fly away in panic.
“Look,” she huffed “I don’t want to kill you...” She didn’t even know if the man understood English, but he nodded. And again a shock went through her body. She let out a scream, trying to fight the pain. “I-I can’t-“ she hissed through her teeth.
“Whatever, man, the kid can take care of his own. It seems like everybody seems to forget the lizard-incident, or that electric-dude.” Hawkeye shakes his head and puts his hands on his hips. “I’m going back to the tower. If you’re not there to make sure Stark takes his pills, somebody else has to babysit him.” Hawkeye waves as he starts walking away from them. As Peter watches him go, he notices Wade – in uniform – lounging in a tree and eating a burrito. Where did he even get one?
“Why would you venture there, lady Yaël? The women have a perfectly working bathroom, too, do they not?” Thor asked in confusion, raising his eyebrows.
to do with the business, but she’s damn good at it. With her reflexes, one would even say she’s been trained for it for years.
Happy asks. Peter pulls his phone away, suddenly remembering Tony telling him there’s a tracker on his suit. Crap, how could he have forgotten about that? Of course he would know where Peter is!
“Okay! Byebye, Space Girl!” Wade said while humming ‘Wannabe’ from the Spice Girls as he walked out. Space Girl…most kids just called her Yaël, a few polite ones even called her miss Yaël, but a few, those who were all about fun and games, called her
“Yeah,” he then says, suddenly sticking out his tongue. “Though I often wonder why.” Steve rolls his eyes, but can’t help the smirk on his face.
“No, it’s okay, Peter. Besides, everybody knows Superman is an alien,” Yaël assured him while throwing him a smile. She wasn’t here to make him feel bad. “You’re the first who actually says something about it, almost nobody knows this and the ones who do know, don’t look at me like I’m different. So, it’s okay this way, I still feel like one of you guys, but with a slightly different background-story.”
He goes to school, gets back to the tower – even answers some questions from Francis, who had been wondering where Peter went – and then starts on adding the final touches to the device in front of him. He’d been going on a good pace, too, until he got to the final part.
MJ gives him an intense look before nodding. She stands up, her knees cracking at the movement. Then she starts running towards the door that leads to the stairs for the rooftop. Before she gets to the handle, she turns back towards him.
“Miss, can you remove those walls please?” a way too familiar voice asked her. Apparently, Yaël had built a little stone cage around them in a reflex. With just a knock of her hand against the stones, the walls crumbled down.
“Yes, Odin’s first born, legally the one who had a right to claim the throne. Of course, she was awful so nobody wanted her as a queen. Thor went to face her, and Brunnhilde couldn’t defeat Hela’s huge wolf so I went back down. After that, I woke up here. Whatever happened in between, I have no idea. I’m actually even surprised I’m still here.”
The kid in the middle, a round, dark-skinned boy Peter recognizes from his school, is hunching forward, as if to prepare himself for a blow he’s about to get. He can’t have been in Midtown High for long, only recently transferred from – where-ever it was, Peter doesn’t really know. So far, he hasn’t had any luck in making friends due to his obvious geeky behavior.
“Hey, uh, I’m going to take a little walk for a bit, okay?” he calls out. Tony waves at him, nodding in understanding. Then Peter gets up from his desk and starts heading towards the door. He knows that, as soon as those two are together, they won’t really notice him being gone for at least a little while. These two are still too much into the honeymoon phase.
This time Yaël wasn’t standing in front of the king. No, she stood in a corner, next to X, looking at herself, pulling Lopt forward. So this is what it looked like, the real memory? The king was sitting on his red velvet throne with his counselor standing next to him. King Eerikki had long, bond back, black hair with a grey flock in it. For a man who physically looked like someone who would be in his late forties on earth, he still had a great, muscular body.
“What more do you have planned?” Steve asks, then. Tony just smirks, but doesn’t say anything. Leading them to a little alleyway with nothing really inside of it. Just when Steve opens his mouth to ask what’s going on, Tony opens up a side-door, nodding towards Steve as an indication that he should get inside.
mini-you walking around’ and one more ‘just freaking tell the kid, Tony. It’s not like he doesn’t already know’. Tony needs a second person to confirm this course of action, and calling Pepper is not a good idea.
Peter looks down, feeling heavy all the sudden. Then he sighs, lowering his hand and taking a step back from the door. Steve’s right; he’s behaving like a child again.
“But, it’s okay, I’ll manage! Sorry for bothering you, mister X.” Yaël wanted to stop whining to this man, but his last words, before hanging up, made her feel warmer than ever.
He doesn’t speak when the electricity turns itself on. When the doors open automatically, he simply takes a step forward and tries to brace himself for what he’s going to find.
Peter’s heart breaks when he sees this. How could the man make such a turn in behavior? Yesterday he looked completely fine, and now here he is, lying in bed after what looks like a possible suicide-attempt.
Yaël grinned widely and looked at the hole in the wall she had caused. A darker-skinned man and an athletic looking woman with furious red hair stared at her with big eyes from the hallway where the hole led to. Then the woman smirked.
“Shit, not only did I just practically threw that into your face, but I also just spoiled Superman’s origins for you!”
“Ned, I don’t want a girlfriend!” he hisses at him, heart beating fast. Why is he suddenly so nervous?
Tony shakes his head. Suddenly, Steve and Peter are gone. So are the stars. What’s going on? He tries to feel around but there’s something holding his hands. He tries to shuffle a bit; realizing he’s lying down in a bed? What is going on?
“Like every second in your life?” Pepper counters. Then she nods towards the elevator. “C’mon, Happy and Rhodey are waiting in the car.”
“Peter Parker, why are you bruised all over?” he asks, using his serious tone. Peter swallows nervously, standing up at last. Wearing only a t-shirt, he fails at trying to hide the bruises on his arms away.
“Sometimes I tend to forget that you know more about this than you should,” Tony admits. “But isn’t it supposed to be me who needs to be looking out for you?”
“Don’t worry, I’ll bring him around,” Peter assures him with a wink. Steve chuckles slightly, pulling Peter closer to him again into another hug. Looking over Steve’s shoulders, Peter can see that it’s dark already.
“Uh,” he mutters out. Liz pulls away the moment she’s done, and then she hops away with another smile. Unlike last time with Gwen, the girl doesn’t nervously continue the conversation a bit. “What just happened?”
“Please, I might have been high on drugs back then, but I know what I saw. And if you two are happy together, don’t… don’t hide it from me, alright?” Peter asks. Steve shuts his mouth, stares for a few seconds, but then nods.
Peter gets off the chair and hurries back to his desk to stop the alarm. Then he picks up his bag, takes out the little box with the pills, and takes his prescribed dose. Each time he takes the water to swallow them down, he wonders at the same time how many more days it’ll be until he can stop taking them. Given his recent ‘reaction’ a few weeks ago, he knows it won’t be soon.
“Oh, Peter! I was just going to say hello, see how you were doing? Johnny said you weren’t feeling too well?” she says. Peter takes in the bright blue eyes looking back at him. Just for a short second, he catches something weird about them. Like…
Tony isn’t sure what he’s feeling when he sees Steve put Peter into bed once again. Inside, his heart is melting in millions of ways because of the many emotions he’s having about this. His brain isn’t giving much input on how to react to it, neither.
Miles nods as he starts heading to the kitchen. He gets greeted by three more people, even hugged by one, before he’s where he needs to be. Standing there is Peter Parker, wearing a plaid shirt above a black t-shirt and his usual thick glasses. His brown hair is messy as always, his sneakers worn out. From what he learned from the Parkers, they aren’t that rich. Peter’s aunt May, who sometimes comes to work here as well, used to struggle a lot with money in the past. How Peter even managed to go to MIT is a mystery to Miles, but he figures he must have had a scholarship or something like that.
“Can’t you just, I don’t know, take a rain-check on this one? Let someone else lead the team,” Tony tries. It doesn’t work with Steve, who just rolls his eyes.
exactly MJ knows and what she doesn’t, he doesn’t want to risk her catching him wearing it. Then he checks his image in the mirror one more time before heading into the hallway. Things will be fine, nothing will happen.
Things have massively gone to shit, Tony thinks as he’s standing behind the glass that separates him and Rhodey, currently in the MRI machine. Vision is behind him, hovering, giving his apologies. But saying ‘sorry’ doesn’t help Tony here.
“I’m fine,” he assures her. He’s not fine, and she knows it. But, right now, fine is probably accurate enough in comparison to how he has been feeling the entire past week. It’s not as if half a day with Mantis will cure him immediately.
“I’m sorry, I haven’t met the kid,” Peter says. Francis nods in understanding before taking a look at his watch.
Peter can’t help but smile the entire evening. He’s greeted by the homeless. Greeted by young people who only just found themselves on the streets after being kicked out. So many more. He listens to all their stories, agrees to go on pictures – Ned is carrying around a polaroid that prints out the photos directly. By the time it’s about ten in the evening, he figures he needs a little time-out.
He tries to shake the memory off. Going for his workbench, he takes out the mask to turn it inside out. Then, having inherited his father’s brain, he gets to work.
“You’re old enough to figure this out. Keep it contained, okay? Dinner will be there in twenty minutes,” he says before walking off. After closing the door, Peter tries to swallow past a lump in his throat. What just happened?
They hang up. Tony blinks his eyes open immediately after. He groans as he tries to move a bit, reaching one hand up to rub his eyes.
“Maybe it was my fault, I left you, maybe it was my fault what happened afterwards…” Yaël didn’t know what he was talking about, but she shook her head and whispered.
About half an hour later, the door opens again to reveal a freshly showered Steve Rogers entering the room. The two on the couch don’t look up but only wave at him while they keep watching their tablet screens. Steve rolls his eyes when he sees them.
The other thing that’s changed is something Peter thinks only he is aware of. It’s what makes Aunt May’s small crush on Captain America a bit awkward as well, seeing as Peter is now absolutely and a hundred percent sure that Tony and Steve are in fact together.
Harry is slowly crawling upright again. The Avengers and the Fantastic Four are all surrounding him, but he doesn’t really seem to care about that. Peter catches him pressing a button on his wrist, and then he holds out his arms in a defensive stance.
“Oh, I remember, you complained about it the entire dance, saying you couldn’t believe I got you to dance on this very song,” Steve jokes. Tony snorts, but keeps on singing along.
Looking at them, Peter starts to wonder what Wanda’s or Vision’s logos would be. Or War Machine’s, or Falcon’s. They don’t have one of those yet, as much as Peter knows.
“Okay, whatever, circles aren’t that important. You draw whatever the fuck you want as long as it is a mix of geometric and sketched figures.”
“And what about next week? Am I still on the schedule with Stark?” Yaël didn’t really see why Steve would put him on her schedule, unless he wants them to become friends or something. Because fighting and cursing at each other while bathing in sweat would stabilize their friendship, right? Idiot.
“Hey, Captain Handsome!” somebody says from the side. Steve turns around from his breakfast, finding Darcy walking up to them with that usual smirk on her face. When she sits down next to him, a tad bit too close for Steve’s taste, she leans her head on her hand and blinks up at him.
, he tells himself. And to think he was just about to give Peter a present for what happened in DC. This whole thing… it just contradicts everything Tony had been thinking. Responsibility, my ass.
“What are you doing here?” Steve asks in confusion. Natasha rolls her eyes but hands him a couple of her gadgets. He recognizes them as… tazers? He’s not sure.
“I’m three eras’ and Raido is two era’s, just like my sister, Nilla,” Yaël told Lopt. Wait, wait, wait, what? Yaël’s own brain just exploded. She isn’t twenty-four years old, she is at least a thousand years older. Wait, no…Yaël suddenly remembered something. She once counted her true age in years with a professor, who was he again? She could swear he was one of the persons she saw in the dream when she got kind of surrounded after breaking the cage. The one whose hair was turning grey-ish. What was his name again? She couldn’t remember. Maybe she could remember her true age? Oh, yes she remembered that, surely… she’s around the two-thousand years old. Holy-
Steve gives the thing a short look before turning to Tony with an eyebrow raised. Then he shakes his head.
Peter almost literally jumps up out of his seat. Sure, his dad might have become the chief of the ‘protect-Peter-squad’, but he would allow at least this, right? Excited, Peter nods, grabbing his books and dropping them in his bag.
,” Yaël corrected her arrogantly, not wanting to please Hela by showing in how much pain she actually was.
Susan is sitting next to Reed. Despite her husband being distracted with whatever is shown on the screen of their laptop, their hands are still holding. Reed has just always been one to keep his eyes behind a screen. At first Sue minded, but after a while she learned to work with it. Now, she has her way to distract the man.
There had been no pleasure in letting the cops take in the rest of Steve’s team. That’s not what Tony wanted, after all. This, right here… this is the team completely fallen apart. He only wanted them to stay together.
Shit! Peter looks down at his hands, realizing that he doesn’t know if he could be able to lift up the damn building and get his family out.
Peter whistles. Where does this guy keep on getting his ideas? He feels the fabric, finding it soft and thick. Looking a bit closer, it reminds him a little bit of his suit.
“You don’t know what you’re saying anymore. Now, come here!” he demanded, but Yaël had never been that good at following orders. So she stubbornly sat down where she had been standing, which made Lopt frown even more. He sighed sarcastically as he walked towards her, plucked her from the ground, ignored her protest sprawling, which caused him to curse loudly after she kicked his nose, and put her back down next to the fire, at the exact point he had told her to go sit a few seconds ago.
Peter’s only asleep for ten minutes before the door opens again. With the Avengers coming and going in the past few days, it could be anyone, really. Though, much to his relief, Tony sees Steve walking inside carefully.
“You killed her,” he hissed at the Goblin, who somehow holds up his arms as if to prove he’s innocent.
Peter’s a little sad when they have to leave again after the fireworks, but seeing as it’s a school day tomorrow, they have to leave now. It’ll already be past midnight when they return home, and he needs to get at least a little bit of sleep.
“Yes, we are,” he says proudly. Then he frowns, looking back down at Tony. “You can get up now, you know?”
In his bedroom, he snatches his wallet, taking a look at the money he currently has. He can use his card to buy a phone, he figures. If he finds one on the way, he’ll even get another controller. Or maybe two. It’s not like he’s poor, after all.
By the time class is finished, Peter lets out a sigh and picks up his detention slip he got from Mrs. Cooper earlier. He says goodbye to Ned after they exchange numbers, and then he starts making his way to the detention hall, where he suddenly hears some commotion happening.
“Dad, stop panicking and get back in bed, you’re wearing yourself out!” Peter warns him. Tony stops squirming and starts taking quick but deep breaths. Peter then grabs for the phone, knowing it’s probably a bad idea to do this. He dials the number, and puts the phone on speaker.
Nonetheless, Peter loves to mess around with the other, less mature Avengers who don’t all act the age they’re supposed to be.
He looked at her severely, but as soon as he saw the tears running down her cheeks, his face softened. He put one hand behind her head and made her lean into him, while the other one was still sturdily supporting her back.
“Tony, yeah! Rhodey said you were here and I wanted to add some suggestions to the suit,” Steve says. “Hello, Pepper.”
“Him and Steve don’t just argue. The place is a freakin’ warzone when they’re at it. Peter always escapes down to Bruce’s level whenever he’s here and they’re at it again.” Tony pinches Rhodey in the arm, which makes the guy yelp in surprise and pain.
Then, there’s Timothy and Yann. They’re both twenty-something guys who do some sort of work in a cultural center. Peter doesn’t know too much about their personal lives, other than that they’re living together and sometimes sneak out to make out behind the building, though MJ once told Peter that Yann used to be a girl once. Peter figures there’s no reason not to believe her, though it doesn’t change anything in how he sees the guy. Yann is Yann, and his past is no business of Peter’s.
wants to get out, but he’s not really feeling like starting to explain that crap to them. They wouldn’t understand, either way.
“What happened to you?” Peter asks, surprised by how hurt his own voice can sound. Felicia just snorts before shaking her head.
Steve asks. Of course, it’s the most obvious answer, given Tony’s history with drinking and the beat his liver took in all those years. “
So all she could do was lay down and stare at the ceiling and think about how she had proved once more she wasn’t hero-material, back there in the arena.  Peter surely wouldn’t have been proud of her...
“It’s artsy,” Peter answered a bit doubtful. He looked so uncomfortable that Yaël automatically threw him a wide grin. She stood up to get her box of pizza and planted her butt on the couch again with her feet on the small table in front of her.
“What is it?” Peter asks, hurrying after her. They stop at a panel where a video image is shown of the Founder of SHIELD, Agent Peggy Carter, talking about how Captain America influenced her life. Peter isn’t listening to her, instead focusing all of his attention to his Aunt.
“Buzz off, cuddlebear,” Tony returns. Steve raises his hand to his face, awkwardly rubbing his nose. Once Rhodey’s back in his seat, the engineer continues. “Listen, Steve. We’re not bringing the kid-thing up
The next time they spoke, was at Oscorp’s. Peter had just found some stuff in his dad’s journals, and found himself at the organization in search for more. He got himself in Dr. Connor’s radar, and Gwen, who was touring the group of interns, gave him a chance to stay as long as he kept her out of trouble. After she found him snooping around where he shouldn’t go, she
Peter is sure he made it; even had Francis check it out because the guy wanted to. He had said that everything was correct, that complimented Peter on getting it right. But in which folder did Peter leave it?
“Aha, here you are!” Was she talking to her phone now? Whatever. Yaël pressed play and Aerials from System of a Down started to play. Now, she had no idea yet how she’d learn to play it, but listening to it already gave her a few ideas.
The parties come and go. Peter joins Johnny more often than not, always waking up with the biggest hangover he can even imagine and missing his first few classes of the day.
“What really happened is that Peter found his uncle’s killer again and lost it for a moment,” Tony says, having only gotten the footnotes from Peter’s stuttered words. Then he takes out the empty bottle of pills he found in Peter’s pants in his room earlier and puts it down on the table. “And I think this is the reason.”
“Ned! The guy with the wings is Liz’ dad!” Peter tells him quickly. Ned needs the short update if Peter wants his help.
Who would have thought that Wade would have saved his ass today? At least, along with Mr. Stark, that is.
Depending on who is guarding Mr. Stark, there’s reaction to said behavior. Widow usually just talks him down, giving him the hard facts and then playing in on his guilt. Where Peter wouldn’t have thought that would work, it does prove effective on the man.
Following her explanations, Peter finds the lever and does as she told him. Almost immediately, the gauntlet opens up, revealing the complicated structure underneath it. Peter shakes his head, wondering how he’ll ever figure this out.
“Felicia?” he asks, confused. The girl’s eyes are open wide, a surprised sound coming out of her mouth.
His phone starts ringing in his pocket. Peter quickly fishes it out, finding that his Dad is trying to reach him. Slowly, he gets on his feet, indicating to the others that he needs to take this call.
“Wow, you survived that?” Yaël jumped as someone suddenly sneaked towards her from behind. She rapidly turned around and saw what seemed to be a drunk woman in full armour holding some sort of gun, aiming at Yaël. Wherever she stranded, this didn’t seem to be a nice, kind place.
She gives him a wave, and Peter holds up his thumb, then pointing towards his bag to say he’s going to change.
“What? But I don’t have any powers or anything!” memory-Yaël yelled. X looked questioning at the real Yaël.
“It’s alright. You just make sure you survive, alright?” Peter returns. He squeezes his hand again. Tony smiles.
The staff at the hotel don’t seem to understand what’s going on. With the sudden addition of probably all the known superheroes in the world, some of the members try and get pictures with their idols while the others try their best at cleaning the more troublesome’s messes.
“Well, then, if your radar is so good, you spotted any other gay Avengers?” the girl asks mockingly, and the boy holds up his finger to think. Before Peter can hear what he’s going to say, Ned starts talking.
Pepper’s face shows up on the screen, and given the background, Tony knows that she’s back in Malibu. After she and Tony broke up, Tony let her live in the house – or is it a mansion? He doesn’t know – they’ve rebuilt after it’d been blown up. Peter can see Happy walking around there somewhere behind her, cursing about something.
“Eh, I guess, he’s kinda cool…Yaël, you won’t believe this but I swear it’s true. Tony Stark is my father.” Peter looked at her, seemingly expecting her to freak out. It was hard to explain, the name sounded familiar, but Yaël couldn’t remember why. So Yaël dug and dug into her memories, which weren’t a lot to dig through.
“Exactly,” Yaël nodded. “I figured that I’d better tackle my problems than just sit, think and whine about them.” Well, actually, Wanda told her to meet up with Peter instead of being grumpy about it, and that pushed Yaël to make some kind of life motto out of it.
“You and Steve were having an argument during a battle, you know, just a couple’s quarrel, nothing too serious. The bad guy didn’t like it and sent us somewhere. I… would like to get back now.”
“That’s because he respects you. And doesn’t want to marry you. If I get one more marriage proposal through text I think I might throw my phone out of the window,” Peter mutters.
“Dad’s on the phone, been for about thirty minutes or so. I’m not sure what it was about, though,” Peter says with a shrug, pointing to the balcony where, through the window, the two can see Tony walk around, moving his hands in the air as he’s talking about something.
“Sure, tell him,” Peter says. “Also, can you tell him I’ll go and see him tonight? And that I’m on patrol with Wanda and Vision?”
Steve smiles fondly at him while Peter’s already pulling out his cellphone to send the girl a message. They don’t text each other, instead sending messages online. He wonders what weird gadget she’ll bring him this time!
Around him, there are a few more kids, all of them looking equally bored. Peter doesn’t know them by name, only that they’ve been here more often than Peter has. Another sigh escapes his mouth as he flicks away another spit-ball that missed its target and ended up on his desk, instead.
Just as he’s about finished with putting together a few requirements he has for the new… suit… FRIDAY’s voice comes up again, causing for Tony to jump up.
It’s not really true, but all these questions are already piling up, and Tony has no idea what he’s supposed to do with them. He quickly waves at the boy before running out of the building. There, the moment he’s into the open air, he lets the suit surround him and takes flight. A couple of people notice him flying up, pointing at him. Tony doesn’t stick around to wave at them.
“Johnny!” Harry shouts, running towards him and reaching out for him before Tony lands right in front of him.
“Yeah, man,” he returns before leaning back against the wall. Miles lets out a shaky breath while he tries to figure out what he should do. “Just needed a few minutes.”
“Peter came by earlier, but his Aunt took him home about an hour ago,” Happy tells him. “He’s been here the entire time, didn’t want to leave.”
Steve, too, leans forward and kisses Peter on the head. It’s a thing all his parents seem to like to do lately, but Peter doesn’t complain. He rather likes it when they mess with his hair, or when they’re showing affection towards him. Peter just dives into Steve’s embrace, staying there until he hears his cue.
“So why are you walking around barefoot?” What did she have to say? Because she permanently needed to distract herself?
After Dr. Cho and her assistants manage to pull every bit of debris out of Tony’s leg and stitched him back up completely, he’s put into the medical room. Normally, he would escape and head back to the penthouse. This time, he just waits it out, too tired to even get up. He keeps the television up, follows on the entire mission behind the screen. And eventually it gets too much and he simply falls asleep through it all.
“Uh,” Tony gets out, squinting a bit, not knowing if he’s reading this right. “One,” he adds, uncertain. He’s pretty sure that can’t be correct, but it’s exactly what his sensors are seeing.
After stumbling in to the Avengers, Peter quickly hurried after Tony back into the workshop. From then on, Tony has been asking questions about what exactly just happened while he was gone. Peter notices immediately he seems to avoid the subject of what Peter said yesterday, and the teenager isn’t sure how to feel about that.
So Tony starts explaining Steve why he did what he did, and Steve keeps on asking him question after question. It’s obvious that the two of them haven’t really spoken in quite a long time. When they’ve taken enough distance, and he’s standing right next to Gwen, she bumps against him.
She still could hear Nilla’s screams echoing. Suddenly the light went green and the automatic door opened. Yaël looked surprised, did Stark just help her out? But Yaël just stepped outside and took her stuff back out of the corner. The automatic door locked itself behind her.
The bell rang sharply as soon as Yaël pushed its button. Oh, this was so weird. She felt like a kid going on a playdate without being invited. Who knows, maybe Peter felt too bad to hang with her.
“It’s Peter,” he breathes out. Then he points towards Thanos, who is being approached by a certain young teenager currently in a brand-new iron suit. So far, it doesn’t seem like the big guy knows he’s coming, but that luck won’t last. Every attempt at sneaking up on him has failed. Too many have lost their lives for it.
Meanwhile, a little further away, Tony and Steve are just about ready to leave Tony’s bedroom at last when FRIDAY shares the urgent news. Tony’s face turns white at the mention of it. Steve gives him one look before nodding, and after that, Iron Man flies away hurriedly, with Vision and War Machine right behind him.
Steve doesn’t respond, just nods. He gets on his feet, pecks Tony on the lips before doing the same to Peter’s cheek. After a quick promise that he’ll be back, he exits the room and closes the door behind him. May, then, too gets on his feet.
“No, it’s okay,” Charles grinned. “Now, I’m going to leave you two alone. I think you both have some catching up to do.” And with that, the professor disappeared. For a second, Peter stared to the spot the man just disappeared from.
The knock on the door brings an annoyed groan out of Tony. They’re both very much aware of their state of undress, so Steve quickly reaches towards the duvet to cover them both. Tony keeps his forehead against Steve’s shoulder.
At first, Yaël wondered why the girl didn’t hang out with Peter instead of her, but after a while, Yaël noticed that Peter didn’t have much time since he started with the internship. Not that she blamed him or anything, she was glad he finally got forward and took the chance to get to know his dad better, even though Stark still didn’t know. Well, it wasn’t totally Peter’s fault that Yaël didn’t see him a lot as he asked her to join his patrols every now and then. But Yaël couldn’t do that as she was no hero. She didn’t trust her skills and her control enough to help people with it, so Peter was better off saving the town without her.
“Stick to the little guy,” was all he said on the matter. When Peter brought it up again a little bit later, all Tony got to tell him was that he was underage, and didn’t want him to sign them until he was a legal adult. Peter decides not to go against it.
“Only for a little while, until we catch him,” Steve assures him. Tony takes the mask off his head and drops it down on the desk before standing up. Then he takes his cup of coffee and starts walking towards the window to have a good look outside. Spring is trying to show, but the last bit of winter is still making an effort to make itself known. It’s not yet weather for t-shirts or shorts, but at least the sun is shining again.
Tony doesn’t speak, instead just walks up at Rhodey and wraps him into a tight hug as a greeting. It’s strange, but at the same time extremely relieving to see the guy stand up on his own two legs again, without the help of his high-tech prosthesis.
After what must be minutes, they pull apart at last. Steve just stares down at Tony with this longing look in his eyes. Tony is simply out of breath, trying with all his might to find something to joke about but unable to get any word out.
Using some precaution now that he knows that the Cat has been observing him in the past, he makes sure that she doesn’t see him enter the tower, using the underground parking that brings him to the penthouse through the private elevator.
“Hey there. Everything okay?” he asks. Peter nods, nearing his dad’s desk and leaning against it as he holds his finger up to scroll through whatever Tony’s working on. It’s something about a crashed spaceship in Norway. Peter read about it, but SHIELD assured they were on it so he left it alone.
, Tony thinks to himself. They had been dealing with Ultron back when it happened, so they weren’t in New York. To imagine, had Tony not created such a mess, they might have been able to save her.
“It’s more an ode to all those who weren’t even worthy to get a ‘name’ before they died. That, and I want the Grandmaster to know that I made the thing that is too big to get removed in a few days, the thing that will force him to cancel coming arena fights, the thing that will shimmer in his eyes as soon as the sun touches it.“
“Call Steve,” he says, or he thinks he says it. He’s not too sure. He repeats the ‘call’ gesture once again, nodding towards Johnny. The boy nods, putting on the mask and walking to the side. Peter smiles despite himself, dropping back down on the ground and putting his hands on his stomach.
“Stay put, I’ll open it up,” he says. Peter nods, continuing his scrolling through his cellphone. Ned, too, doesn’t seem to pay too much attention. “Yeah, they’re on the couch. Just get in. Peter, your friends are here.”
Tony looks at it happening from the sidelines, watching the princess explain how she’s going to do it to the man Tony considers as a brother; the man who never deserved to end up paralyzed from the waist down.
After some time, one of the teens walked in. It was Surge, all by herself. Yaël knew that some of these kids had no parents anymore and others were abandoned for being mutants. There were kids whose parents didn’t even know about their mutation or the school and who thought they send their kid just to a regular boarding school, but of course, those didn’t get invited for the parent’s day. All the teens chose if they invited their parents themselves.
Steve shakes his head. Tony can feel it above his. “It’s never ridiculous,” Steve assures him, kissing him on the head slightly.
“So, am I making a good dad already?” Tony asks in a whisper. Steve lowers his head until his lips are on Tony’s neck. Tony gasps lightly, holding on to Steve’s back with his two hands.
“Peter, we need to talk about you being an Avenger…” Steve finally says without looking up. On Tony’s face, Peter can already see that it’s not going to be a pleasant conversation.
“I love you, Tony Stark. And I’m sure that you can figure this out. But working with Peter has always been… complementary. You always finish each other’s sentences.” Steve gives him a light kiss on the lips before pulling away.
He hesitates on doing it; what if she doesn’t want it? What if he’s read all the signs wrong? What if it’s another best friend that she likes? It could be Ned, for all he knows, right? Not that she’s ever shown any interest in the guy, either, of course.
“I- I,” he starts, but he can’t continue. What was he doing? Was he really about to kill this guy? A mere human who has no possible way to defend himself? Disgusted with his own, Peter lets go of him, taking a few steps back and trying to place that weird stinging in his chest. His heart is beating like crazy.
The little red light finally turned green and the glass door automatically slid open. Luckily all the employees had gone home already. Everything seemed to be made of glass, but Yaël wasn’t naive, she knew all of this was made of some sort of material that was unable to even crack. Just like the glass from the cage when she had been locked up. Yaël looked around while walking through a hallway, until she saw the familiar blonde hair behind of one of the ‘windows’.
He doesn’t seem to hear Peter at all, so lost in thought. Peter decides it’s best not to startle a super soldier, so keeping his distance, he silently clears his throat. Steve doesn’t hear him.
“We were worried! Strange was about to lose his grip on the portal before you came through! What took you so long?” Peter asks curiously. Tony pulls back at last, getting Steve’s help to get back on his feet.
“They look great! And it might be tight up there but look how swirly your skirt is! It looks like you’re a ballerina made out of satin!”
“No, he shouldn’t,” Tony returns. “If all the other files are right, at least.” He pulls up his tablet and goes through the multiple notes already. “FRI, can you go through this formula and test it on a random living subject?”
Since her illness, she started appreciating being alone and the silence more and more, because she knew what it felt like to feel, see and think about so many things at the same time it makes you feel your head is going to explode.
want to get to know him. I want to know who he is before I come sending him his ‘it’s a boy!’ card, you see?” Man, that was a lot of ‘know’ in one sentence!
I'm a day early, I'm aware. I'm just on a roll with writing these chapters, and I might even be starting to hope to finish the story before Infinity War comes out, as I'm currently writing chapter 21 of 26. Yes, indeed I wrote 26, since I have once again added another chapter to the repertoire (one of my chapters got way too long, so I had to split it in two!)
“About ten minutes ago or so. I immediately went to help May in the kitchen,” Steve explains. Right at that exact time, May comes in with another steaming pot.
“Who did you introduce yourself as?” Peter asks before Tony can even start with whatever he wants to talk about. Then Tony sees him slap his hand on his mouth, as if he’s embarrassed for slipping it out so carelessly.
Dum-E lets go of his shirt again before grabbing a napkin to dab on Peter’s forehead, even though he’s not sweating at all. Peter just lets him do it, knowing that mentioning it to the bot won’t make a difference at all.
a kid! You only turned eighteen three months ago, Peter!” Tony’s face is now completely red. Steve seems to have given up on trying to calm him down.
They are standing in one moment, and the other he’s lying on his back, on his bed, with the Cat leaning over him, putting her hands in all the right places. Peter throws his head back, feeling her tongue against his neck. He can’t remember ever being so turned on like this before in his life. Holy shit, this girl’s a Goddess…
“Ah-hah! I knew it wasn’t bad lighting,” Tony calls out. “Why didn’t you tell me you were re-designing the suit? I could have pimped it red and gold for you!”
Mary stays quiet, but Tony is all too aware of her eyes on him. She’s studying him, probably trying to get to know him again. It’s been a while since they’ve hung out for her as well.
“Oh, Peter! I’m so happy to hear this,” she calls out in excitement. Her face is pressed against his shoulder, and her arms are squeezing him really tightly. She’s actually quite strong for such a little lady, and Peter’s almost sure she can hold her own would she ever get into a fight – not that he hopes that will ever happen, of course!
“Before I’m going to crush the both of you, I need a little wardrobe change, though,” Tony quickly says. People laugh. LL points towards a screen that was obviously put there for that exact reason. “Don’t wait for me, just start the song!”
“Is there any history of depression in your family?” Mr. Stark suddenly asks. Peter thinks for a while, thinking back of what Mr. Stark just said a few minutes ago. Then he nods. Of course, the man wouldn’t know it’s
By the time Bruce has rejoined them again, Otto starts calling people together. The crowd comes to stand in front of where Otto’s standing. Looking at him curiously, everybody waits to see what he’s made, and even Tony wants to know how exactly the guy is going to include tritium in his self-sustaining energy.
Trying to call up Peter leads him to voicemail. The phone is turned off. He’ll try again later. Peter needs to know that he’s alright. Surely,
“You’ll see. I won’t spoil the surprise,” Tony says with a grin. Then he gives him a pat on the shoulder and leads him out of the little room. The suit disappears again into the column. The windows slide back close.
“Oh, but you don’t look different, I mean, it’s not like you look colder or anything.” Yaël didn’t even know what a Frost Giant was supposed to look like. Lopt doubted for a second before looking away. Within a small moment, his skin started turning blue, his eyes red. Memory- and regular-Yaël’s eyes both started growing bigger. Within the fraction of a second, there was a blue man standing in front of her. Memory-Yaël noticed that Lopt avoided looking at her. And as she gasped out of wonder, he immediately turned normal again.
needs to get out of here, but now he realizes he can’t just leave like that. He kind of broke up the guy’s marriage, at least even more than it already was. Kind of announced to the whole world that he’s in a relationship with Captain America, which he doesn’t even know if it’s true…
“Johnny, can’t you just go five seconds without trying to ask out girls?” Peter returns in laughter. Johnny looks appalled at that suggestion.
They’re at their peak. Tony can hear it in Steve’s sounds. The desperate noises he makes, telling Tony that he’s close, but also that he doesn’t want to end it so soon. But it has to. They can’t go on forever. So Steve doesn’t stop, keeps up the pace, bringing both of them over the edge at the same time.
Yaël heard a noise and was able to duck away as soon as she opened them and saw the products storming towards her. She dodged burning fists and watery feet swinging her way. It was working! These two powers were controlled well enough to handle them from her subconsciousness, while she was doing something else consciously. In this case, her spawns were able to attack her while she was able to dodge them. Of course they weren’t able to hit her even once, because Yaël was still steering them, just less actively.
“Ha-ha, very funny,” Tony counters while rolling his eyes. Peter sits up in his chair. Vision takes another portion and starts eating it again. Is it his third plate, now?
Tony turns back to Bruce, noticing only then that his own eyes are stinging. He wipes away a few tears and nods.
Another sigh, and then Peter walks back into the room, where he’s greeted with a few worried glances, but no more than that. He stays there for the remaining thirty minutes. The moment it’s over, he hurries out without giving as much as a warning. He knows it’s rude, but he doesn’t care.
“As long as I don’t hear the words from your mouth, I won’t accept it,” Steve tells him, stubbornly as always. He crosses his arms, but Tony can see that he’s close to breaking down. Good, let him feel it.
But it’s the slowly shrinking man they’re all looking at that deserves the most attention. While the skin is slowly turning from green to its usual tanned color, Peter realizes all too well who this man is. It’s been years since he last saw him, but it’s undeniably him.
“OF COURSE I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE!” Steve shouts in a sudden wave of anger. Tony startles, but doesn’t look up. “I CARE ABOUT PETER AS IF HE’S MY OWN SON!”
“Peter? I thought you wouldn’t call me anymore,” Steve admits. Natasha hisses at him that he needs to hang up now, but Steve waves her off. He hasn’t had a chance to talk to Peter in a long while, he needs to hear what’s going on.
“Holy shit,” she mumbled while rubbing her eyes. Who woke her- Oh, it surely was that freaking Wade again. He was the only one who called her ‘girlie’ and who would wake her up like this. Was he making a habit of waking her up? Yaël stamped towards the door and pulled it open aggressively.
complicated? Sur, Peter has limited knowledge on how the thing works, but given a bit of time he managed to find some sort of beginning to base himself on. Besides, the technology is
“I just wanted to go back to earth!” Yaël couldn’t stop the words from streaming out of her mouth until Loki finally stopped her rage talk.
“Tony!” Steve shouts, trying to get his attention. Tony takes a few shaky breaths, feeling his eyes sting. Eventually, he turns towards Steve, feeling just ready to reach inside his own chest and just rip his heart out. That would be less painless than what he’d just seen.
Johnny nods, and so do Sue and Reed. Ben just grunts. What a group, they are. A bunch of scientists who went up in space for research and a teenager that snuck in on the space craft because he didn’t want his sister to go without him. Ben is Reed’s best friend. Sue is Reed’s fiancé. Johnny is Sue’s brother. That doesn’t seem enough, most of the time. Whenever they’re
“Wanda, you got any idea where she’s hiding?” Peter asks in a whisper, knowing that she’ll hear him. She’s given him a com-link after they’ve decided to partner up, so they communicate on their own channel.
“Dad, it’s college! Nothing is going to happen to me!” Peter laughs, taking his Dad’s hands into his own. “I’ve survived high school, how bad can college be?”
“How about we clean this up for a bit, alright?” Steve agrees, and the two of them get working on it as fast as they can. Just when they’re about to finish, FRIDAY comes with the news that the pizza has arrived.
“Hah! I got you there, Parker,” she says, pulling out the picture that came out of it and waving it around a bit. Peter laughs, grabbing for her arm and pulling her closer to him. Where does this even come from? He’s surprised of himself, here.
They stay in silence for a while, just enjoying their closeness, the touch. The feeling of each other. But after a while, Tony takes a deep breath, lifting up his head and opening his mouth.
“You tell me; The kid found you lying in your own puke in the bathroom and called for an ambulance. Nobody knows what happened, but you. And FRIDAY, but she’s being vague and unhelpful as ever,” Happy says, shrugging at that last fact. Tony clears his throat, trying to ignore the uneasy feeling of the tube.
“Hi, Steve,” Peter returns. “Listen, Nat and I had about half an hour of walking to get here. If you two need to… do whatever you need to do, you’ve still got time.”
“Uhm, so I dreamt again and, eh, I kind of discovered I’m from another planet. But somehow I remember the languages I speak, but I simply can’t remember the planet itself. So, I was wondering if you knew the name of my planet.”
Peter doesn’t complain at all. He knows this should be any kid or teenager’s dream, so he’ll have to act like he’s never been here before in his life. Mr. Stark is standing outside, waiting for Peter to join him.
He’s not all that surprised when he sees the man opening up the door with the biggest but ugliest smile ever. “Parker and pizza, best combination ever!” the guy almost sings, practically dragging Peter inside. Peter tries not to look too panicked, instead standing his ground and taking a deep breath to remain calm. After spotting a small table to his right, Peter walks up to there to drop the boxes, then turning back around towards Creepy Stalker Guy.
Peter rolls his eyes. He has no intention getting into that car. They’ll only end up dead, one way or another. That, or worse; he could
Tony glares at him, but he keeps his comments to himself. He shouldn’t insult the guy, not when he’s only barely gotten Peter out of trouble.
Nothing much changes after everything. Peter goes back to school, continues working at the internship, and still hangs out weekly with his aunt.
with this stuff? “So far, Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow and Vision have signed, along with many foreign heroes.”
Tony clenches his fist a bit tighter, an angry growl escaping his mouth before he loosens his grip, taking a step back. Strange just readjusts his scrubs and leans down to get the chart from the ground.
“Jeesh, calm down, Peter,” Felicia mutters. They’re finally outside after that, and Peter takes a large gulp of fresh air. Or, as fresh as the air can be in such a large city as New York. “Besides, what else could you do? You don’t fight crime and disasters like the Avengers?”
Yaël shut her mouth. Did he really try to save her? She shook her head. “Why didn’t you come to visit me afterwards, if you cared that much about me?” she hissed. Yaël saw the anger and impatience grow in Loki’s eyes. Oh, she loved triggering him.
Helen nods. “I thought that, too. Maybe something in his brain is causing this.” Helen sighs. “I’ll have the nurses prepare the MRI and get some contrast fluid ready in case it’s necessary.” She walks off after that, giving May a sad look before leaving. The woman has her arms wrapped around herself, eyes downwards and looking like she’s at the verge of crying. Tony isn’t too surprised when Steve walks up to her and wraps her in his arms.
