Steve was still in his uniform, there were a few tears and some blood. Tony would  need to do repairs. He removes it from his body, placing it neatly in the closet where the children won’t see it. He takes a quick shower and changes into a fresh pair of boxers. Shutting off the light, he opens the door and makes his way to the bed. It takes a moment for his eyes to adjust and he notices there’s no room for him. He leans down and kisses Peter’s cheek to wake him up. He holds his finger over his mouth to shush him.
Her small manicured hand touches his face and a gold light flashes before his eyes. The pain in his nose is gone. Her hand moves down his arm erasing the bruises and then to his stomach removing the pain there. Peter starts crying again, “I want to go home.”
Middle of summer and the trees are full of leaves making it impossible to see the forest floor. Jarvis was zooming in when he found heat signatures but nothing as a big as a child had showed up. He started to worry that Peter wasn’t even in the woods. He hoped Steve was checking in and around the house. He had to keep a clear head, he couldn’t let the worries about his son cloud his mind. It was still early morning, the sky still had that hazed over look it gets before the sun fully rises. Peter had left before Steve woke and it would have been full dark. Full dark, in a large forest with all types of animals that would view a human child as easy prey.
Steve is leaning up against the wall, one knee up with his elbow resting on it, wearing boxers and a white t-shirt. He looks exhausted and like he would rather be someplace else. Tony watches him as he works on his second cup of coffee. Their children are completely occupied with opening gifts. Peter is carefully reading the names and making up piles. There’s a small one by Steve completely untouched. Peter has placed all of Tony’s gifts on the coffee table. Pepper takes the kids each year to the mall to pick something out to give to their parents and each other. It was a nice gesture and the kids liked going anywhere with Pepper.
Steve returns outside in fresh clothes carrying a new outfit for Beverly to wear. He hands them to Tony.
Tony makes himself another drink and then relaxes back into his seat. “Don’t make me repeat myself.”
He disconnects the call and opens some screens in privacy mode. Someone would need to be standing right behind him to see it. His heart sinks as he reads through pages and pages of lab reports. He carefully glances over at his children to make sure they’re still on the blanket playing before returning to reading. Each experiment had been orchestrated in a way that they thought could trigger the serum in her DNA. It was a cruel experiment to put a child through. Exposure to extreme temperatures and poisons. They had broken her arm to see how it would heal. Exposed her to diseases, brought her close to death and then brought her back.
“Her mother told her. They knew something was going to happen. Left her somewhere safe. Told her you would come get her. I’m not going to be the person that takes that away from her.”
Peter snatches it up ignoring the microfibers now stuck to it. He starts to suck on it. A light pink stain is now on Steve’s shirt.
Tony chuckles and smiles over at Steve, forgetting for a moment that they’re in the middle of a fight. Steve returns the smile and shakes his head. “We haven’t been to Asgard.”
“I want my candy,” he says reaching for the bag in Steve’s hands. Steve pulls it out of his reach and walks into the kitchen to put it on top of the fridge.
Tony finds the cookies Peter has left on the couch. He grabs them and crushes them in his hand before throwing them in the trash. Peter is crying and begging them not to throw them away. “You can’t get into cookies whenever you want.  You didn’t ask. They’re going in the trash. End of story.”
Tony looks up at him, his fingers still resting on the home-keys of his laptop keyboard. Steve lets out a sigh. “We need to talk, Tony.”
Tony leads him into the living-room and makes him sit on the couch. He grabs a bag of peas and a towel from the kitchen. Instructs him to hold it to the back of his head. May is coming inside. “Is he alright?”
“Pants. Shirts. I’m sure all the desperate housewives will appreciate if you show up in your undies but I won’t.”
A moment later he’s waking up on the couch with a very concerned Tony next to him offering a glass of water.
He wouldn’t have that comfort this time around. It was in a remote enough area he assumed it would be another set of safe houses. No chance to stay in a hotel with hot water and a bed. Tony had introduced him to phone sex and he found himself really enjoying it. They had tried it with video a few times but he preferred it without. Listening to Tony gasp and moan as he described what he was doing to his body always got him so aroused he felt dizzy. He tried to avoid touching himself to build up suspense, to achieve a stronger orgasm.
Tony laughs and asks Beverly if she wants her own bowl of cereal. He makes her one and sets up at the table away from her brother.
Peter turns back towards him, milkshake straw still in his mouth. He reaches out his hand and grabs Steve’s thigh. Steve returns to eating and Peter stares at something on the wall. Tony and Steve continue eating until something seems to spook Peter. He climbs up onto Steve’s lap, nearly causing him to drop his food. Steve sets his burger down and wipes his hands on his napkin.  He grabs Peter around his waist and pulls him back so he can see his face. Peter’s eyes are completely transfixed on something behind Steve, his mouth hanging open. Steve’s eyes narrow with concern before he looks over at Tony.
“I met her briefly. If I had to compare her to another Asgardian I’d say she is more like Lady Sif,—” Phil passes a piece of paper over, “—we debriefed her on the incident. She claimed the demon attacked her as she tried to lead Peter back home. She told Peter to run and pointed him in the way of the house. She’s quite young and was struggling to fight with the demon. She summoned the Bifröst to take the demon back to Asgard. She was quite upset when she heard of Peter’s near-drowning. We believe she genuinely meant no harm.”
“No. I get a weird feeling in that house. Let’s invite them over here in the morning. Tell them over some coffee and pastries.”
“Sure thing kid. Let’s get inside,” Tony starts to lead him inside but not before exchanging a look with Steve. Their conversation wasn’t over but it would have to wait for another time.
Tony stands up and goes up to the door. He knocks softly.  “I’m not good at apologies. You know that. I can’t fix it like I usually do with an apology beej. Steve? That was awful. I shouldn’t have said that. Done that. Are you okay? Just tell me you’re okay…” Tony trails off and lays his forehead against the door with a soft thud.
“Shit, kid, I’m sorry. Let me see,” Tony says reaches out for his arm. Peter steps back and grabs his pajama top.
“Not yet, Tony. We have a son Peter. He’s not much older than you,” Steve says turning his attention back to his daughter.
Peter cuddles into her and closes his eyes. Resting his head on her soft breasts and threading his small fingers through her hair. He wondered if this was what having a mother was like. He wishes he had more memories of his parents. Mary and Richard Parker. It was all bits and pieces. Steve and Tony have been his parents for three years now. It was strange living in their house at first. He assumed it would be like the other homes and he wouldn’t be there for long. Now it just felt so natural. He was happy having his two dads. He opens his eyes, “I want Aunt May to put me to bed.”
“I have to go,” Steve whispers against his lips and pulls away. “Peter can be dramatic but I don’t need that from you,” he teases.
The Quinjet lands on Tony’s helicopter pad nearby and he’s surprised when the call comes in from Clint and Natasha. He figured they would already be enroute to the location and he’d be riding with someone else. The two come inside to see Tony and the kids.
Peter cuddles up between his two dads on the sofa. Ben and May are cuddling on the loveseat. He starts to feel tired halfway through the movie. Tony nudges his shoulder and tells him to go to bed. He stares sleepily at Tony before closing his eyes and cuddling into Steve. Peter lets out a whine as Tony pulls him away from Steve and nudges him up off the couch. “Go on. Get to bed.”
Tony looks sad for a moment before he speaks. “Pep and I got into a fight. She’s taken Morgan and is staying with her mom for a bit.”
Steve sighs and grabs his pile of gifts as he’s standing up. He drops them unceremoniously onto the coffee table and sits next to Tony letting his head rest on his shoulder. His blue eyes closing as he rests his hands on Tony’s thigh.
Peter continues crying and yelling about Steve being gone and ignoring him. Steve looks down at Beverly and she seems to be calming down. She looks worn out and her eyes are red from crying. This was hard, it always was, coming back from a mission and trying to adjust. He was used to giving orders and having them followed without question. Family life didn’t work like that. He knew why Peter was upset and that yelling at him wasn’t going to get them anywhere.
Harder to not think about the comforts of home while sitting across from your husband in a sparsely furnished safe house eating MREs or meals ready to eat by a drafty fire. Everyone usually slept close together near the fire for warmth. There were plenty of nights he would sneak with Tony into another room. Where he would make love to his husband. Even if it was on a threadbare blanket over a dusty floor, it was special to them. The release it brought with it, made the mission bearable. They would quietly return to the main room after cleaning up, climbing into their sleeping bags and cuddling up for warmth.
Steve sits back into the couch letting his head fall against the cushion as he rubs his forehead. He listens to Peter’s muffled cries for a minute before sliding his arm in front of the kid’s chest and pulling him onto his lap. Peter hides his face against Steve’s neck and lets his father rub his back. It was challenging for Steve to follow through with discipline. He ended up with two crying children and it didn’t feel right. He couldn’t get over the idea that all the times he went easy on Peter lead to him wandering off and almost drowning. Both of his children needed a solid and consistent structure. There had to be consequences for actions.
Steve rinses all the dishes in the sink and loads up the dishwasher. He looks at the empty coffee pot and washes that next. After he tidies up the kitchen he sits on the table by Ben. “We should leave within the next hour.”
“Ok,” Peter says weakly through his tears and hiccups as he holds out his hand to her. After the pinky swear, it’s a few short minutes for May to get everything and clean. She does her best to bandage it with gauze and tape. “Candy now? I want a sucker.”
Steve felt like he was seeing into how detectives must feel after years of working on cases. There’s so much evil in the world. He would write his report and turn over the folders to SHIELD. Later though, because he wasn’t ready to look at it again.
“Yeah, I want to go there,” Peter says as Tony dresses him in shorts and a t-shirt. He doesn’t put up a fuss like he usually would if one of his parents tried to dress him. He was a big boy and didn’t need help like a baby. Peter jumps off the couch and quickly regrets it as he starts to feel dizzy. The medications were still making him feel strange. He reaches out and grabs Tony’s knee to steady himself.
“I know. Mommy told me before she left me. Tim isn’t my father. They had to leave but I’d be safe with my real father, Steve Rogers. He would pick me up from SHIELD. I waited a couple days but he did come. He doesn’t know that I know. You’re my dad too, right? You’re his husband. When can I see Mommy again?”
Peter’s synapses are firing away as he tries to wake his brain up and figure out what his father is upset about. “I—what?—I’m just trying to read.”
A long silence passes, the ticking of the clock feels unnaturally loud, driving at Tony’s already piercing headache.
Tony walks downstairs and joins his husband on the couch. Tony is taken aback when Steve pulls away as Tony is leaning in to kiss him.
Note: If you don’t want a reply, for any reason (sometimes I feel shy when I’m reading and not up to starting a conversation, for example), feel free to sign your comment with “whisper” and I will appreciate it but not respond!
“One night,” Jerry pauses and reaches out to hold Marie’s hand before continuing. “One night, the police cars were lined up down the street. Ambulances and fire trucks. All out here. He had murdered the wife and daughter before killing himself. The little boy was missing. They couldn’t find his body. A search team would put together to comb through the woods. They found him the next morning floating in the creek. We felt you had a right to know. It’s all in the newspaper if you search back that far.”
“Listen. It’s probably nothing but that sounds like a seizure to me. It’s not always spasms or convulsions.”
Tony stiffens as she hugs him, he reluctantly puts an arm around her when Steve gives him a disapproving look.
“I’m sorry. I’ll go back into time out,” Peter says as he glances up to gauge Steve’s reaction. He never got in trouble for it before.
Steve’s cheeks burn red as he looks down at the dark-haired man. He hopes it’s too dark for Tony to tell. Tony kisses Steve’s abs through his t-shirt, feeling his muscles involuntarily tighten in response. He continues kissing, pulling up Steve’s shirt making his way to his sensitive hip-bone. Steve jerks away and lets out a laugh. Tony lifts his head up and laughs innocently. “I remember you being ticklish.”
Peter and Beverly lie on their backs on the carpeted floor of the tiny basement living-room of his quad-level townhouse. Giggling as they pass a joint back and forth.
Peter waits patiently as they talk, listening to Tony’s side of the conversation. He’s finally handed the phone. He sits up and moves to the other side of the bed to talk to Steve. Overjoyed to hear his voice and know that he’s ok. He recounts what he can remember of his dream. Steve does what he can to calm him down. After a long chat, he crawls back over to Tony to give him the phone but finds him to be asleep. So he tells Steve bye, returns the phone to the nightstand, and turns off the light. He curls up in the middle of the bed and starts to fall back asleep.
“You know better, ” Steve says getting angry. “You are under no circumstances to go outside like that. Do you understand me?” He grabs Peter’s arm to get his attention and make him look at him. Peter nods at him but doesn’t say anything. Steve lets go of his arm and stands up, moving his hand to Peter’s back and leading him out of the room. He feels frustrated when he sees the hallway bathroom is occupied. So instead he takes Peter into their room and private bathroom. Tony is in the shower and the bathroom is full of steam. “Hey Tony!”
“A couple from out of town bought it a few years back and fixed it up to rent. People don’t stay in that house long. Before that it has been through countless owners. Many of them have packed up in the middle of the night and never returned. A week or so later another For Sale sign is up. Now they don’t have to disclose this unless you specifically ask but there was a murder in that house. The local folks know but the address never made it to the national news. Our daughter Katie, she’s grown and off at college right now. She used to play with their daughter. They had a son too, a few years younger.
“Good. Let’s get you to bed,” Tony says as he tries to get Peter to stand up. Peter hugs him tight and doesn’t allow himself to be moved. Tony laughs at him. “Baby! You are going to bed. We’re not doing this tonight.”
“It’s fine Steve,” Tony says sleepily as he gets out of the bed. He walks up to Steve and gives him a quick kiss. He reaches down to tousle Peter’s hair before heading into the bathroom and muttering something about not being able to fall back asleep.
Peter whips a shampoo bottle over at Steve’s legs. It misses and rolls across the bottom of the shower. Peter had been acting out severely since Beverly had come to live with them. They were working with a new psychologist they found in the area and trying to be more consistent in their discipline.
Steve hesitates and wonders if he comes out to this guy and corrects him that he and his husband are staying nearby. That awkward equation gay people run through their head. Is this person homophobic? How will they react?
She plants on her feet and lifts her head revealing a face with dark eyes and pale skin. “My son,” the ghoulish creature says. Her voice dry like the crackling of leaves on a fall day.
“Okay Jesus Crazy Legs! Stop with the rolling around and kicking. I can’t sleep you’re shaking the mattress,” Tony complains as Steve’s movement wake him up yet again just as he’s starting to doze off.
“I’ve set up the guest bed for you. I’ve left some towels out for you on the dresser. Is there anything else you need?” Steve asks, standing in the darkened living room in boxers and a t-shirt.
One of the late nights when Tony is meeting with Australia, his eyes start to water and his nose feels a little itchy, so he finds himself struggling to stay awake during the meeting. In addition his mind keeps wandering. Beverly seemed to be getting worse instead of better. She was miserable every day. He was struggling to find a nanny as some are not wanting to start in the middle of a kid being sick. There was also the process of screening them and filtering out the bad ones.
Steve is in a heightened sense of panic. His mind is racing and he’s overwhelmed, struggling to process new information but he can’t just lock himself in his room. He had his children to look after. Beverly starts squirming in his arms and asking to be let down. He waits until they walk up the path from the beach and are back on the lawn.
Around seven-thirty p.m. Steve goes down to the neighbors to retrieve Peter. The walk home is quiet as Peter worries over the punishment he’ll get for lying earlier.  It was different in the tower, his parents didn’t mind if he went down to the common floor without asking. Most of the time he was there if any of the Avengers happened to be in town. If someone was eating lunch or dinner, they would always make a plate for him. Steve and Tony were both busy all the time. It was hard for him to understand why Steve was upset with him now. He’s so deep in thought that  he stops paying attention to where he’s walking. He trips on a rock and falls hard onto the road skinning his knees. He starts crying and expects Steve to turn around and come back to him. To comfort him. “Get your ass up,” Steve says as he stops walking and stares back at his son. His voice hard like when he’s commanding his team and not a tone he ever takes with Peter.
Steve and Ben have wandered inside and are gathering around. Steve sits on the couch and pulls Peter to him. Gently pulling back the improvised ice pack and trying to get a look at the cut. It’s hard to get a good visual with the poor lighting and blood mixed with hair.
Tony raises his eyebrows looking over at Peter as he holds his phone against his chest. He looks up and down Peter’s suit before reaching out and touching the fabric.
Evening came after a long day of activities outside of the house. They go to a working farm in the neighborhood. Peter was excited to see the farm animals and play with the herding dogs. Touring the sugar shack was one of his favorite parts. It’s a building dedicated to making maple syrup.  The process usually starts in February or March. They tap the trees when it's frozen, and the sap starts flowing once everything thaws. The barrels of sap are taken to the sugar shack to be processed in the oven. Someone has to sleep in the loft and watch the oven all night. The oven is giant, over 5 feet tall and twice as long. Peter was excited to listen to the explanation but was disappointed he couldn’t see the process this time of year.
“Oh stop!” Marie says as she slaps her husband’s arm. “I’m sure they don’t believe in ghosts. That’s silly.”
Tony continues to worry as the minutes pass but he doesn’t voice any more of his concerns to Steve. Saying it aloud seemed to make it more real and he didn’t want to accept it. He zooms in on a few heat signatures but they’re all false leads.
Steve pulls Peter into his arms and to his chest, kissing the top of his head. “Go to sleep,” he repeats.
“No Daddy! We can’t leave yet! You said we could get ice cream while we’re downtown,” Peter complains as he walks circles around his parents.
Her sardonic laughter fills the room. She crosses her legs and fiddles with a pen on the table. “I’m not the one to ask. Maybe wake up Clint for that.”
Steve leads them to a vending machine outside a conference room. Beverly’s eyes light up as she sees the bright packages of the ice cream bars and ice cream cones.
Steve steps out from under the spray and slicks his hair back. He isn’t surprised when he looks down to find Peter opening the shower door and coming inside.
Steve picks Beverly up and carries her into the kitchen, setting her on the island while he digs through the freezer for a bag of peas. He wraps it in a towel and instruct her to hold her up to her eye.
Steve gets up and joins Peter at the door, looking outside. He puts his hand on his son’s shoulder. “You see him now?”
Steve kneels down and pulls her hand back so he can get a look at the swollen eye that was looking like it was going to bruise.
“Hey,” Peter says softly as he enters the living-room. He sees the outline of Tony’s shoulders over the couch. “I wasn’t expecting anyone to still be up.”
“He’s acting so weird this week. He’s having nightmares and acting out. He keeps telling us wild stories. He won’t sleep in his own bed. He wet his pants yesterday. And Sam, he was just sitting in it, in his room.”
“Peter please! Just let me clean it. It will only sting for a second. I promise,” May pleads softly while her eyes glare at Steve. He was scaring the kid and making things worse.
There was nothing that could have prepared him for what he saw on the other side. Nick Fury, all in black looking intimidating as all hell and standing just behind him is the long dead Tony Stark. Very much alive and looking healthy.
No, he couldn’t tell her even if it meant lying to her. He sits on the couch with her. She makes herself more comfortable and closes her eyes. Tony tells Jarvis to turn on television to local news, mute it and turn on subtitles.
Steve slinks down so he’s lying next to Tony. “Fine, we’ll cuddle. But no tickling or touching below the trousers.”
“It’s still going to be an adjustment for him,” Steve says as Tony passes him another paper to sign.
It was a strange want, he could physically feel it, deep in his body. He wanted to hold them close, to smell their hair, and kiss their cheeks. They were much too old for that now. He wipes at his wet eyes and wills himself to stop crying. He had a husband that recoiled at his touch and two children that were away from home. He hadn’t really slept in days, maybe that was what he needed. A decent night’s sleep and maybe just maybe he would wake up and things would be back in their places.
He makes the kids clean up the room and he goes to his room to change out of his three piece suit into something comfortable and casual. The weather was cooling off as it was late November. The kids were off for Thanksgiving break. After changing into sweatpants and a band t-shirt Tony walks down the hallway to check for more messes.
Tony wipes at his tears and focuses his eyes on the little bit of flesh peeking out between Steve’s shirt and boxers. Anything to keep his emotion in check because everything is starting to hurt. He had missed his children growing up. He hadn’t been there to help Peter with his powers. The kid was young and naive. He’d get himself into situations with no thought on how to get out. Tony thinks back to the Ferry incident. It’s oddly funny to him now, the anger he felt at the time long gone.
Steve goes into the living-room and sets down a glass of water. Tony peeks out from under his hand, “that’s not coffee babe.”
Tony crosses his arms and looks over at Steve. Biting his tongue and not saying a wiseass remark to his husband. Tony can see the pain behind Steve’s eye, he can see the thoughts running through his head. “Steve,” he says softly as he sits on the couch by him and wraps his arm around him. “Listen, we have to follow the rules for this. She’s a minor.”
“We believe it was attempting to possess you and Tony but it failed. It was definitely the cause of the blackouts you described.”
Peter’s eyes open slowly and his room comes into focus. It’s still night and moonlight is peeking in through the blinds. The orange fox nightlight is still illuminating his room. He tries to move his hand to scratch his nose but it won’t budge. That’s when he notices the hair cascading down next to him. His eyes dart up and there she is, the white dead fish eyes lady. He starts to panic and he’s yelling in his mind telling his body to move. His body won’t listen and her hand is moving closer to him. She touches his face gently in an almost affectionate manner. She turns and looks towards the hallway as if she hears something. With that she starts to float out of the room until her figure just dissipates.  Finally he can move again. He screams and cries, afraid to get off the bed, afraid to stay on the bed. He needs to get out of the room.
He knew he was being over protective but even Peter leaving the bed for the bathroom made him nervous. It would take time to rebuild that trust. He didn’t like Peter leaving his side and he knew eventually the time would come when he would have to. He and Tony would return to work and Peter would go back to daycare.
“There’s nothing stopping her from remembering some day. I need to know so I can help her through it.”
He disappears up the stairs and down the hall. His steps quick and silent as he slips into Peter’s room. His son is lying on his side, his arms wrapped around a bundle of the blanket. His messy curls splayed across his pillow, his pink mouth slightly open. Tony approaches the bed and leans down to place a kiss on his head. Once he’s satisfied that Peter is safe and sound, he makes his way to his daughter’s room.
Steve carries a sleeping Peter into the house. The long day of activities had worn the child out. He was tired by the time they got to the restaurant for dinner. Not wanting to eat much of his dinner or play with any of the things they packed for him. They were thankful when he fell asleep during the car ride back. Tony walks into Peter’s bedroom with them and  pulls back the covers so Steve can set him down. They make quick work of removing his clothes and putting on pajamas. Tony tucks him in tightly the way he likes and smiles over at Steve. “We’re good at this. Didn’t even wake him up.”
“They found her files. Nat did. I read through them. Just the first ten or so. Tony, it’s horrifying.”
Tony hurries over there and opens the door before Thor can tear it off the frame. He’s pulled into a forceful hug. “Tony’s fine, Point Blank. No need for titles.”
Peter walks up to them with pink package in his hand. He held it out to his sister and Tony grabs it from him.
He finds her with the blankets kicked off lying on her back. He brushes her blonde hair off her forehead and pulls up the covers around her. She whines and her brown eyes pop open looking up at him surprised. “Daddy!”
Steve rubs at his eyes. Okay, they were cracking the surface of something but he didn’t want to face any of it. He needed to scold Peter for calling Beverly stupid but his mind was racing with so many other thoughts.
“Thank you! I love dogs. My dads won’t let me have one. We live in the city and they don’t have time for one. Bailey is your dog’s name? That’s a nice name. What kind of dog is she? She looks like a wolf.”
Steve grabs a tissue and holds it under Peter’s nose and instructs him to try again. The kid was right and barely anything comes out. Steve sits down by him and presses his lips to his forehead.
“I’m just messing with you,” Tony says. “Thanks for watching them. It feels great to get more than 3 hours of sleep.”
Peter is sleepy, sweet, and excited about gift. Tony holds his hand as they walk into the great room.
Steve feels more worn out than he did after his run. He managed to bathe both children, stop them from fighting and prevent them from slipping and falling.  They were dressed for the day and gathered around the table eating cereal. Beverly is standing up on her knees in the chair eating her food. Steve had given up telling her to sit properly. He wanted to eat and read the paper. Peter was complaining about how he wasn’t allowed to sit at the table like that. Steve scolds him when he tries it so he stops after that. Tony is either pretending to be asleep or he’s sneaked past them and is in his workshop.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him as he squirts shaving cream into his hand. Peter holds out his hand and Tony gives him some so he can pretend like he’s shaving. Peter finds his toy razor on the vanity top. Tony starts to carefully shave his iconic goatee.
Tony retires to his bedroom and looks around the quiet room at the empty bed. It was too quiet in the room, he didn’t think he could sleep. He gets washed up and changed into pajamas before settling into bed. Surprisingly he’s able to fall asleep, less surprisingly he’s having an awful dream. Memories of Afghanistan playing out vividly through his mind. He wakes with a start, sitting up and reaching out instinctually for Steve. All he finds in the cold comforter, he grips it tightly in his hand and looks around the room starting his calming exercise.
“Why don’t you read the label, Tony?” Steve teases but there isn’t much behind the words like he’s going through the motions.
“Baby, what’s wrong?” Steve asks as he sits on the bed and tries to pull Peter into his arms. Peter tries to pull out of his arms and starts pounding his fists against Steve’s chest and face. “No! I want Tony!”
May has a big smile on her face as they carry in the glasses and set them on the coffee table. It’s followed by chips with salsa and queso dip. The theme tonight was Ninety’s movies and they were starting with The Linguine Incident. “Tony doesn’t drink, but thank you,” Steve says politely as he slides Tony’s drink away from him.
“What? She shows up out of nowhere. You drop everything to come down here. Nothing suspicious about that?”
Peter is struggling to keep his eyes open after lunch. The power has come back on but it’s still quite dark outside. The rain has stopped but the cloud cover is heavy, like it will start again at any moment. Steve is watching him concerned before turning to Tony. “How much sleep do you think he got last night?”
“I was talking to you and you just ignore me to play with Beverly. You never pay attention to me anymore.”
Peter climbs off her lap and reaches for her hand. Steve nods at her letting her know it’s ok. May walks him to this room and pulls the covers down so he can climb in. She tucks the covers around him tightly. “Night light,” he says sleepily to her already starting to doze off. She looks around the room until she finds it on the dresser. It was small and in the shape of a fox. It let out an orange glow when she turned it on. “I love you Aunt May.”
“Let me do it,” Sam says as he forces his way in and Tony is too shocked to protest. He sits back on his haunches and watches the scene in front of him play out. Sam alternating between compressions and rescue breathing. Not even flinching at the times Peter coughs water into his mouth.
Peter hesitates before admitting bashfully that he hadn’t. Steve grabs his shoulders and leads him back to his bedroom. Hefting his suitcase up onto the dresser and unzipping it. He opens the top drawer and starts to move Peter’s clothes into it. Peter stands off to the side with his arms crossed. Knowing if he tries to help Steve will only tell him he’s in the way. His father’s parenting style could be described as smothering and over-protective. It’s not always something that Peter minded. He never has to pack his own suitcase or in this case have to unpack it. Steve is always up for cuddling and never scolds Peter telling him he’s getting too old. It balances with Tony’s more hand-off approach to parenting. Together they average out to one normal parent.
There was a steep decline down to the water that has risen a couple feet with all the recent rain.  He makes it a few steps  down the muddy incline before his foot slips straight out from under him, slicing the back of his leg on a protruding tree root. Tumbling down until his body hits water, his head hits rock, and his vision goes black.
“I don’t think so,” Peter says abruptly ending their cuddle session and hopping out the bed. “Is Daddy awake?”
Driving down the road not far from the store, he thinks that he sees Tony walking. Steve pulls the car over and gets out. He convinces Tony to get back in the car with him. Steve drives off, chancing glances at his husband who is oddly quiet and staring down at the dash.
The children are loud and excited as they come into the room. Dropping their bags and shoes at the door, they rush towards Steve. He lets out a groan as one child jumps onto his chest, and the other onto his stomach. He tries holding them both in his arms as he sits up carefully adjusting them.
Thanks for reading. I wasn't sure if I would get the chapter out today. I had a very busy weekend but I wanted to keep with my schedule.
Peter looks at it confused before looking up at Steve nervously. He hadn’t done it but he couldn’t help feeling guilty with the way Steve was looking at him. It made him feel like he had misbehaved. He had too many memories while in state care of being blamed for things he didn’t do. Both of his parents were giving him stern disapproving looks. It left him feeling scared and worried.
Steve gives up on going through the paperwork. Nothing found on his daughter which isn’t surprising since the place they raided was overseas. He has this nervous energy running through him. He goes downstairs to take it out on a punching bag. At the end when his hands are starting to hurt, he starts to carefully unwrap the fabric from his knuckles. Tossing them back into the gym bag. He rests his hands on the sides of the metal table and stares down at nothing in particular. His mind still wasn’t clear.
Peter looks at Tony pleadingly hoping his dad will override Steve’s punishment. “Your father is right. You could have gotten hurt or bit by that dog.”
“None of us can leave.” She grabs a block and throws it up in the air before catching it. “Your father is so powerful. I’ve never seen energy like that. He holds this anger and it’s so easy to feed off of. I haven’t been able to touch things for years. He doesn’t even get the headaches like the others did.”
Suddenly Peter is sitting in his lap, reaching up to wipe a tear from his father’s eye. Reminding Steve of when his teen was a young boy and always wanted someone to be holding him. He was a really sweet kid even though he was developing quite an attitude in his teen years. Definitely taking after Tony in that area. Making it so Steve had to deal with two of them each day. Staying up late, not wanting to get up in the morning. He takes Peter’s hand and moves it down setting it in his lap. He wipes his own eyes before pulling his son into a hug. Rubbing his back he says, “you’re a good kid, you know that?”
Peter grabs some blocks and starts building. He instructs Tony and Steve on how to build their pieces. Causing his parents to snicker each time he gets overly bossy.  A couple hours pass and they have a decent castle going. Peter is starting to run out of pieces. He gets up and walks back over to the window. The sound of the rain pelting the roof drowns out the television and any other noise in the house. The wind is whipping the rain against the windows. Peter presses his face to the window, watching his breath fog up the glass. He glances over his shoulder to see if either of his parents are watching. If he’ll be scolded for mucking it up.  He wipes it away with his hand. His eyes focus on something outside. It takes him a minute to realize it’s a young boy about his age standing on the edge of the woods.
“I’m right here. You can ask away. Though I can’t remember shit and they aren’t helping,” Tony says moving closer to Steve.
“Tony?” Peter cries as he rushes to the kitchen, watching helplessly as Tony falls and smacks his head against the countertop.
“He’s not my father. I mean he helps me out and I stay here some breaks. May remarried. You know, to give her some space. She’s at a work conference this week. I’m not staying with her husband.”
Tony had been keeping a low profile. He hadn’t stormed into Stark Industries and taken the company back. He had pulled out a large amount of money from what Steve considered to be a questionable offshore account. Bought random things from hardware stores, busted up some walls. He repaired them of course. Assuring Steve that it wasn’t even noticeable.
It’s as if Peter was waiting for him by the door. Peter’s walking quickly towards him as soon as he gets home.
“We’re going to Pepper’s mother’s house for Thanksgiving. It will be fine. At your age your biggest concern should be if I remember to buy your favorite cereal or not.” Tony assures him. Peter had a tendency to worry about everything.
Tony startles awake as it feels like the whole house is shaking. His children are sitting up slowly and looking at him fearfully.
“We kept telling Peter it was his imagination. He was so upset and trying to tell us,” Steve says as he glances over to their son who is immersed in some nature program.
Tony kisses Peter’s temple again before instructing Peter to get up so they can go out to the kitchen. Peter reluctantly follows Tony out there figuring it’s better than being alone in his room. He slips his hand into Tony’s and stays a few steps behind him.
Tony offers his hand and helps Peter up. He turns the shower off and they get out. Tony wraps a towel around him before sending him into the bedroom.
“Yes and no. I went to Morgan’s last birthday party. Sometimes I see them a lot and other times months go by. Everyone’s busy. Tied up in their life.”
Steve Rogers wasn’t having a good day. Far from it actually. A few days earlier one of the guys from the group therapy session he ran at the VA, had commited suicide. He was young, twenty-five or twenty-six, married and had two small daughters. He had been in the Marines and was having trouble adjusting to being back home.
Tony tries to suck in a breath and realizes the cause of the headache, he’s completely congested. No, this couldn’t be, he couldn’t do this, he can’t be sick. He hasn’t been sick in years he didn’t take time off. Only if he became really injured on a mission. His body hurt all over and it felt like he hadn’t slept for days. Well actually worse than that because he had done that and felt better. Would it be so bad to have a drink? He knew had been slipping lately, turning to the bottle when the stress of two children on top of everything else became too much.
“So the question is, why is Peter so afraid for you to take his clothes off? Is this what he meant by you hurting him?”
“Why? I’m listening to you!” Peter pleads with him. He was still under the impression that Tony had brought him outside and wanted him to go into the woods. So he was confused now as Tony was yelling at him and trying to pull him inside. One of them wasn’t really his father and he had to go with the right one.
“I wouldn’t worry about it. Let a doctor check him out. I have to go. I have to be at the VA in an hour. You need to talk to Tony about this. ”
Beverly is careful to not make any noise as she opens the door and slips outside. She wanders down the hall and finds the door to the stairs but it’s too heavy for her to pull open. So she heads back in the other direction and finds the elevator.  She could just reach the buttons and she remembered her mother explaining that the ground floor would have a star next to the number.
Peter is really upset when Tony tries to explain that he’ll be going to a new school and they won’t be living in the NYC for the year. His mood only gets worse as Tony tries to explain to him that he will be a big brother. That Tony and Steve have adopted a little girl. He spends most of the plane ride being surly and crying. Mad at his parents for not asking him if he wanted a little sister. Tony is at his wit’s end when they get to the house. Tony finds the house empty as Happy helps him carry in suitcases. Happy gets the suitcases to their rooms before heading out.
“I’m sorry. I just can’t,” Steve mumbles to himself before leaving the room. He sits on the couch and continues laughing hysterically. He was no help to Tony or Peter in this state. Peter was fine there was no way Tony could actually hurt him. This was something the two would have to work out on their own. This world with Tony, albeit a confused Tony, was an interesting one.
Tony looks down his head hanging heavy with shame, his lips in a thin line. He couldn’t look at Steve and see that anger on his face again.
Tony jumps into the creek, the cool water soaking through his jeans as he pulls Peter from the water. Peter is slack in his arms.
“It was a bottle of wine. My boyfriend broke up with me and I just wanted to forget for a minute. You ignored me as soon as I got here.”
Tony tenses and his mind is racing as he tries to mask any emotion on his face. “No baby, he would never hurt you,” Tony assures him but the doubt is already planting it’s seed. For years he had put his trust in the wrong man. A person he thought had his best interests in mind. Obadiah’s betrayal cut him deeply, made him feel like he could never trust again. Then Steve became his husband and things were good. He opened up and trusted him. One of the few people he allowed into his inner circle.  Peter was the only thing pure and good in his life. That wasn’t true, Steve had a strong sense of what was right and always stood up for the little guy.  Steve was also pure and good. There was no way he was doing anything to hurt Peter. “Has Papa done anything to hurt you?”
Happy attempts to talk to Peter and it doesn’t go well. It just sends him into a full tantrum. Happy comes out back to the living-room watching Steve walk back and forth with his daughter in his arms. She’s crying as much as Peter is.
Steve can feel the frustration mounting and his mind is swirling with thoughts. He couldn’t get Tony’s face out of his head. The look he gave him when he confronted him about Peter that morning. Stuck in this tiny house as torrents of rain fall from the skies, he couldn’t get away from them. He couldn’t finish the conversation with Tony because there was no-one to watch Peter. They were supposed to talk during his nap but neither one brought it up. The power had came back on so Tony buried himself in work, putting on his headphones. Shutting Steve out seemed to be one of Tony’s favorite pastimes.
He kicks his feet up on the coffee table knocking the books to the side as he asks Jarvis to turn to television onto something interesting. He’s leaning his head back and closes his eyes when he senses a presence near him. His heart rate quickens and he’s reaching out to push the thing back when Peter lets out a yelp. Tony is taking in the scene and realizing he’s not in any danger. His hands are still around his son’s waist and he’s tipping him precariously off the couch. Tony immediately pulls him onto his lap.
“Going into someone’s yard like that. You don’t know them. What if the dog wasn’t good with kids and you got bit?”
Recently, Peter had become obsessed with the cliff. He’d beg Tony almost every night to tell him the story of how he found the property and built a house on it. Steve had heard the story so many times but part of him didn’t mind, he enjoyed seeing his son excited about it. He wished he’d just let them read him a book. Steve had been reading a book from his own childhood to Beverly. The Wind in The Willows, published in 1908, and he was very much enjoying recreating that world for her.
Tony hadn’t read any of the case files, he wasn’t ready for processing that information. They knew she would have problems when they adopted her. SHIELD had walked them through everything. It had been the same with Peter, but his behaviors were immediate. Beverly was normal and well adjusted though. He found himself waiting for the other shoe to drop. And when it hadn’t he started to forget that anything bad had happened to her.
He knew it was Tony’s coping mechanism. Saying shitty things like that. He didn’t mean it but Steve couldn’t push it from his mind. It hurt. He’d never get over the guilt of not double checking Peter’s bed. It was all he had to do and it would have taken seconds. And today, he was too busy screaming at his husband to notice another kid slip out the door.
“There’s some major meetings going on today,” Happy says as he checks his phone. “I need to get back actually. Sorry I can’t help more.”
“Why did I ever marry you? My mother told me not to and I should have listened,” Pepper says as she sets the last of her bags were packed and by the door. They usually had Christmas decorations up by then but the house remained in its usual state.
She opens a bag of pretzels and rejoins him at the table. Slowly chewing one before answering. “You have her now. She’s safe. Seemingly normal and unaffected by whatever happened. I think you should focus on that.”
“That was Tony,” Steve denies as they both start laughing. Peter pulls out of the headlock and pushes Steve away from him. Steve relaxes back into the couch and reaches out a hand to rub Peter’s brown curls.
Or they are planning on hitting the target in a couple hours. Trying to find something to occupy them and keep away. Steve is playing solitaire.
“Come on, buddy,” Tony says as he places a hand on his shoulder and leads him out into the living-room.
Steve sits up quickly as he hears the sliding door open and he turns towards it. A smile spreads across his face before he stands up and goes to his husband and pulls him into a tight hug.
Tony comes home to find Steve fast asleep on the couch and a mess in the kitchen most likely left by their children. The step stool is in front of the fridge, the cabinet above it wide open. The milk is sitting on the table with some of it spilled on the surface. He cleans up after the children and walks into the living-room to observe the mess. The two have taken out every single toy they own. No wonder Steve fell asleep in the middle of the day, two children had tripled the amount of work. Tony was dreading checking the state of the rest of the house.
“Bad news bears,” Peter says remembering something his father had said about the man and he knew it references some old movies his dad watched as a kid.
Tony steps back and both of them start laughing. In doubling the number of children in their life, they had doubled the amount of wild things being said.
Steve wipes some mashed potatoes off of Peter’s cheek. He was always a messy eater. He and Tony were baffled how he always managed to get food in his hair. “Since you’re in the middle of dinner I’m going to let you go inside and finish. But don’t think for a minute this is acceptable or that you’re not going to get in trouble. You lied to those people.”
Tony gets down on his knee so he’s at Peter’s level and wipes the tears out of his eyes. “Pete, we talked about this on the plane ride over. Papa and I adopted another child. You’re a big brother now, remember?”
His father had hit him for way less. Sometimes it felt like the punishments were purely because he existed and took up space. He remembers times so bad that he was praying to go back to boarding school. He couldn’t find the right balance, he never wanted his children to be afraid of him. But Peter was pushing his boundaries and even more so with Steve gone. He couldn’t just let it go he had to do something.
Steve laughs before capturing a nipple in his mouth. Tony’s breath hitches. “If you would have let me book the vacation. We’d have a big enough place we wouldn’t have to worry.”
Peter runs out of the room and Tony disappears into the bathroom to splash water on his face and find some cold medicine. He’d need something stronger to get through the day.
They disappeared as quickly as they appeared, leaving Steve and Tony in an awkward silence. Steve is asking the world of him and Tony is finding it harder and harder to deny him.
His father finally leaves his room and Peter is lying on his bed, face buried in his pillow, crying. Steve Rogers had spanked him. His parents had never physically disciplined him before. It was always yelling followed by time-outs when he was younger. Now that he was getting older he was typically sent to him room and sometimes grounded if what he had done was bad enough. It had all happened so fast he didn’t even know what Steve was trying to do when he grabbed him. Not until the pain erupted through his body when Steve’s hand made contact. His bottom was still stinging.
Peter pushes the blanket off onto the floor. Steve sighs and picks it up folding it  and placing it on the cushion next to him. He notices dirt and grass caked on Peter’s feet. “Were you outside when everyone was sleeping?”
Peter looks at her uncertain and doesn’t do anything to reply. The doctor slips the stethoscope earpieces into her ears before warming the chest piece with her hands. “Sorry it may be a little cold,” She warns before pulling up his shirt and placing it against a spot on his back.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers as he stands next to the tub. Tony turns towards him and wraps an arm around him pulling him close before kissing his cheek tasting the salty tears. Tony squeezes him a little tighter.
Sam lands nearby as Tony is performing CPR following instructions from JARVIS. Sam takes command as he gets there. After years of Pararescue missions in Afghanistan and he’s starting to feel like he’s back into the thick of it. As if he’s surrounded by other pararescuemen and not in the middle of the woods trying to save his best friend’s son. The first ten minutes after you pull someone from the water are essential and it has to be done right. The longer the person isn’t breathing the lower the chance of survival.
“It’s a fox demon. Sounds cute but they’re wicked things. We believe this thing to be closely related or an actual Kitsune. They can appear as human as they did with Peter. Usually with ill intent. They’ve been known to lead people astray and to their death. We believe it intended to kill Peter just as it had done with that family twenty years ago.”
He ought to call his Dad but he was already imagining that going poorly. Tony would tell Friday to track Henry down and send out a suit. And do what? A repulsor blast through the chest or be like a rich parent in those K-dramas his mom and sisters liked to watch, and pay Henry to disappear from Beverly’s life? He could call his Pops and where would that go? Would Steve call Bucky and Natasha and go pay the kid a visit? He pulls himself up from the floor and starts to clean up the room.
Tony walks over to the floor to ceiling windows and looks out across the city. Was he trying to find Steve out there Peter wonders.
“Dad,” he says louder this time as he walks into the room. Tony turns back towards him and holds out his arm. Peter walks up to him and lets himself be pulled to his side. Tony holding onto him just a little too tight, gives him a kiss on the cheek. The kiss feels wet from Tony’s tears.
“Not going to help?” Steve asks turning towards him. “Noticed you ran off when I was unloading groceries too.”
“Hey!” Tony yells causing Peter to jump and look over at him surprised. He crumples against Steve and hides his face against his chest. Steve rubs Peter’s back and looks at Tony worried.
“Peter’s ok?” he asks as he walks over to them. He kneels down and holds out his arms for his son. Peter goes to him and Steve scoops him up in his arms. “We need to get you in bed.”
They both turn when they realize they aren’t alone in the room. Natasha and Clint are standing just in the threshold of the door.
He slowly rocks in son in his arms until the crying abates. He kisses his hair taking in the mix of strawberry shampoo and that unique smell that is Peter.  Tony looks up to see Steve staring back at them.
“It’s great having you. Peter is excited for you to be here,” Steve says before drinking his coffee.
Peter pokes his head around the couch, his brown hair messy and pointing out in all directions. Steve walks over to the couch with  his mug, leaning down to kiss Peter’s forehead as he passes. He sets the coffee on the table and turns towards his son. “You want milk or juice?”
They watch a movie on the couch after the long day. Peter is cuddled between his parents. Midway through the movie,  Peter has his head resting in Tony’s lap and is asleep. Once it ends, Steve carefully picks up the sleeping child. They take him to his room and get him tucked into bed. They hope he sleeps through the night and stays in his bed. He looks so tiny sometimes, especially under the covers only his head peeking out.
Steve looks out the large windows of the sunroom towards the bedroom he and Tony are staying in. There were no curtains on the windows and he could see that they were still sound asleep. There was no chance of Tony overhearing.
The woman keeps moving around them as if she’s exploding with energy. She cackles sounding older than she looks. She stops suddenly and stands directly in front of them. “This is my domain and I allow you to live here, no?”
Peter knew Tony drinking wasn’t going to be good, but he didn’t know how to stand up to him. The will to listen to his father and do as he was told was too strong. He turns and head back to the bar cart. Grabbing the items Tony asked for, taking them outside into the glaring sun and setting them on the patio table.
Peter swallows a bite of toast. “I’d be surprised if she’s up and out of the house. She didn’t mention having plans.”
Steve sits forward in his chair and grabs his coffee from the table, taking a sip. “Yeah, not fully awake yet.”
Peter smiles guiltily and wraps his arms around Steve’s waist. Steve cards his fingers through Peter’s soft brown curls. “Dad and I are going to watch some tv. Are you going to join us?”
, which was created to improve communication between readers and authors. This author invites and appreciates feedback, including:
“Boo boo Bunny and then bed,” Tony counters because Bruce was dating someone who made cutesy crafts for the kids. It was nice actually because it distracted Peter when he was hurt. It was a washcloth folded and sewn into a shape of a bunny that was moistened and left in the freezer. Easier than dealing with a plastic bag filled with ice since both children liked taking the ice out and letting it melt on furniture.
Peter tries to help Tony into bed. It’s late in the night and Tony is fall-down drunk. He manages to convince him to put on pajamas and get into bed. Peter climbs on the bed and tucks him in. Tony pulls him close and kisses his cheek.
Steve lets her chin go and pick her up. She cries against Steve’s neck. “I’m sorry Steve. I didn’t mean to make you mad.”
Tony doesn’t think he just acts as he slides his hand under the rim of Steve’s boxers. Steve is already reacting as Tony fingers feel the coarse pubic hair before finding soft flesh. Steve’s body is responding to him, hardening up. Just as his hand is about to slip around the growing hardness, Steve pushes him away roughly.
The room is eventually cleared out of all the doctors and nurses. Peter is taken away for more tests before he’s returned to his bed. Steve and Tony comfort him and help him to relax. He’s crying for a while and wanting both his parents to hold him. Eventually sleep over takes him and he falls into a fitful rest. Steve and Tony find themselves unable to sleep, so they cuddled up with each other on the couch under a blanket, and watch movies all night.
Just wanted to point out that I didn't put a warning for major character death so Peter is still alive but not necessarily in the clear yet. I threw in one of my original characters from my non-fanfiction fiction work. She's the one that saves Peter from the creature.
Tony sits up and slides effortlessly onto Steve’s lap and rests his head in the crook of Steve’s neck. Steve’s arms wrap around him.
“Talk then? Wanna tell me how someone you set me up with, secretly had my child and sold her out to Hydra?”
He jerks his head up and looks straight at Steve. “Do you have Peter? Is he okay? Oh god. I just left him.”
“No baby.  If things go well it will be a couple weeks. It could be longer,” Steve explains. He tried to be as truthful as he he could with his kids. Age appropriate of course but Peter was smart and figured things out faster than they anticipated.
Tony rests his head on Steve’s shoulder and tries to regulate his breathing. “Tony, tell me what’s going on?”
Steve is suddenly on full alert, thinking back to the days before Tony got sober. There was no such thing as one drink with Tony. He was of course fun at the beginning of the night. Not so much as it wore on, when depending on his drink of choice Tony could turn mean or sad. Steve could only take so many insults before it started to hurt. He could only take so many before he would start yelling back at Tony. Awful fights would occur and lead to awkward apologetic mornings. On the other end there is sad Tony, his mood would dip so low it was impossible to pull him out of it. It would bleed into the subsequent days and ultimately lead to another drinking session.
“We’re on your side here. I’m already pulling some strings. You can understand how it looks?” Natasha adds.
Steve pulls up a calendar on his phone. It has been the furthest thing on his mind. Complete the mission. Get home, see Tony and the kids.  “It’s in two days.”
Beverly hugs him tightly and they tell each other goodnight. It’s quiet once she sits on the floor and opens her suitcase. She can’t sleep though, the cheap gas station coffee that got her through the drive working against her. Beverly pads softly downstairs into the kitchen, trying a few switches before she finds the right one. All the sounds feel amplified as she pulls a bottle of wine out of a paper bag. It clinks as she sets it on the granite countertop. The drawers are loud as she opens them looking for the wine key.
“I can’t just abandon Iron Man or the Avengers. You know that. It’s who I am,” Tony pleads with her.
There’s the sound of his daughter splashing in the water and the sound of her toys hitting the side of the tub. There’s the sound of  his children noisily slurping their popsicles. The sound of Peter occasionally turning the page in his book.
“Steve, you should talk to Tony and make sure you’re in a safe space when you view them. You don’t want to get stuck in the negative.”
“Give me a minute,” he says as he mutes his headset and removes it from his ear before placing it on the desk. He takes a deep breath and walks into the other room, finding two screaming children.
“I love you, too,” Steve says as he breaks the embrace to lead Tony to their bedroom. He hadn’t meant to say it back. He didn’t know if he meant it. If Tony really thought they were married he would be crushed if it wasn’t said back.
It was hard to keep up sometimes, their little minds moved so quickly. Peter was already onto something else.
Natasha says nothing and starts to dig through a cabinet for snacks. She throws a small bag of Doritos towards Steve. He catches it and then shakes it at her. “Not going to answer?”
Later that night, the three of them are sitting at the dining table having a very tense conversation. Peter is still in shock and remaining quiet.
Peter climbs onto his lap and Tony puts his arms around him. Steve rubs his shoulder and assures him it only be uncomfortable for a couple seconds. After being convinced by his parents he lets the doctor perform the test.
Tony looks through the door back into the house. Peter comes into the sunroom and looks up at his parents. “I can’t find my Iron Man,” he says referring to his plush toy. Tony can’t help but smirk at him as he pulls him into a hug.
Tony unwraps the gift, and opens the white box pulling out a leatherbound book. He slowly flips through the pages, it’s full of sketches Steve had done this year. Candid ones of him in his lab working, making breakfast, doing research. Tony feels a blush raising up on his face as he finds one of himself sprawled across the bed, a thin sheet covering his lower half.
Tony stays by the door for a minute trying to listen for any sounds. Steve is being completely quiet though and he seems to have no intention to come back out. He turns back towards the bed not sure what to do with himself. He didn’t like this uncertainty. He was always together and in control. He felt weak and confused and he hated it.
Tony sits up slowly his head aching all over. Light fills his eyes as he opens them. Peter is looking at him impatiently shifting his weight between his feet.
Tony returns to the room, handing one of the cups of coffee to Steve before kissing him on the lips. He sits heavily on the couch and brings the cup to his lips letting the warm liquid warm his throat as it slides down. He hears the sound of wrapping paper moving across the couch before a box hits the rug. Beverly is attached to his chest again, her little hand clasping the arc reactor.
I am extremely busy this month so it might be a bit before I start my next work. I have wedding planning to do. My fiancée and I are also having a new house built. In additional to that I’m in a community play. We’re also selling my fiancée’s condo.
Steve returns to the kitchen to help clean up. Peter starts to calm down as both his parents join him on the couch.
“She gets scared at night. They have her in a secure room for an Inhuman. It’s not a kids room. The walls are dark and plain. She told me she doesn’t want to stay there at night and I’m suppose to ignore that? She’s my kid.”
“Hit me again and see what happens,” Tony threatens as he straightens up and starts to lead Peter towards his room. He hurls the heavy suitcase from the floor onto the bed and opens it. Digging around from summer pajamas to put Peter into. He pulls them out and returns the suitcase to the floor. He turns towards Peter and jerks his shirt off more roughly than he’s intending.
“It was another crazy story. Tony and I got into a fight. I had to leave. I felt this intense anger come over me. I wanted to hurt them.”
“Let me put the lunch I packed for him in there. You’ll have to make him sit down to eat. He’ll keep playing if you let him. Make sure he eats at least half of it,” Steve says as he moves the food to their cooler. Ben zips it up and starts to head out the door. “He’s a runner. You’ll have to watch out for that. He wanders in stores. You really have to keep an eye on him. He will disappear on you.”
“Still carrying the old diaper bag? Aren’t your kids a little old?” Pepper’s brother teases him as they get through the threshold.
Steve could hardly say no even with the knowledge that the longer he left Tony alone the likeliness of having sex tonight was plummeting. He pulls back the covers and Peter scoots over to make room for him. Peter cuddles up to his legs and Steve starts to wish he brought his phone or a book with him. Hopefully Peter would fall asleep soon and he he could sneak out.
The door flies open and Tony is rushing towards him. The memories of Tony’s scolding post ferry incident are flooding Peter’s mind. Tony furiously advances backing Peter against the wall. Peter holds his hands up defensively as Tony grabs him roughly by the collar.
The car ride is quiet as Tony drives with Steve to the hardware store. Tony had asked May if they would mind watching Peter for a couple hours. He was planning on picking up a few things so he could put a little surveillance into the place. Peter’s stories had been wild and inconsistent. He went outside. He didn’t go outside. Steve took him outside. He didn’t know if it was Steve. He hadn’t fallen after jumping on the bed, the ghost from the closet knocked him into the bed frame. He wasn’t going to be able to build anything as sophisticated as he could if he had his workshop but he was confident it would be better than anything you could grab off the shelves.
“Are you feeling alright?” Steve asks concerned. When Tony doesn’t answer he continues. “I’m sorry about earlier. Really sorry for just leaving.”
Steve sighs and flags the waitress over. They were becoming regulars there and it was a waitress they knew pretty well. He explains about Tony’s change of plans and cashed out.
Tony didn’t really even want to see Steve. It was another reminder of how he couldn’t get someone to stay and love him. He could cancel, spend the day alone in his workshop bury himself in work. It wasn’t fair to Steve though. Their relationship had been great and he had been nothing but kind and supportive. Even offering to watch Morgan to give him and Pepper more alone time.
“No,” Peter says as the doctor pulls out a large cotton swab to swab the back of his throat to test for strep.
The Potts Family home is busy when they arrive. Beverly is pulling at her fluffy red and gold dress. Tony grabs her hand and tells her to stop fussing with it. Even though the temperature was on the cool side the sun was out making Peter feel too warm in the sweater Tony forced him to wear. He stops on the path up to the house to slip it up over his head. He hands it to his father. Tony stuffs it into the bag he brought with a change of clothes for the kids in case of any accidents. He looks disapprovingly at Peter’s white undershirt that is now covered in blue fuzz from the sweater.
Peter shuffles over and stops in front of the couch and looks nervously up at him. He lets out a shocked cry as he’s pulled across his father’s lap.
“They’re just very messy and accident prone,” Tony explains as he drops the bag by the door and greets Mrs. Potts handing her a hostess gift and a nice wine he brought.
Steve comes in the room with a laundry basket on his hip. He sits it on the table and it’s full of Peter’s freshly washed clothes. He starts to dig through it, “should we just leave him in pajamas? We’re not going anywhere.”
Peter moves onto Steve’s lap and kisses him too. He jumps off the couch and runs up to May and Ben. Kissing his aunt and uncle next. May giggles and pulls him into a tight hug. “We get goodnight kisses too Ben. Isn’t that sweet?  You two are raising such a good boy.”
Hey y'all. Not a new chapter just an update. I've posted the next story in this series. Please go check it out.
Tony lands and steps out of his IronMan suit. Jarvis detected a heat signature here. The size of a child. Peter is lying in the creek face down, his face submerged in the water. Tony’s vision blurs, his left arm throbs, his hands are trembling uncontrollably.  His thoughts wandered back to those parenting classes Steve insisted they attend.
Peter lifts his head up and stares at the little ghost boy. “What do you want to play,” he asks shakily.
Tony is sitting at the dining room table when they arrive home looking through some paperwork. “Why don’t you tell Daddy what you did?” Steve asks as he walks over to the table and sits down. Peter stops in front of Tony and waits for him to look up.
“She keeps tugging at her ears. Kids do that when their ears hurt. She might have an ear infection.”
One day in the grocery store Tony let go of his hand, left him with a cart full of groceries as he raced out the door. He stood by the cart and waited for him to return. Scared of the old ladies that would ask him to move the cart out of the way. He’d stare at them blankly and they’d move the cart and complain about people not watching their children. Eventually the store manager came over. All the groceries were put back and they brought him behind the counter. He had been so excited about being back there he started asking tons of questions. Forgetting for a second that Tony had left him. They finally got him to settle down and give them his phone number and name. The next thing he remembered was being excited to see Steve walking into the store. Steve, full of anger and worry, thanked the employees profusely. Picking up his young son and holding him close. Kissing his forehead and asking him if he’s alright. Muttering something about killing Tony when he gets home. They leave the store and walk back to the car. Peter asks about the groceries and Steve tells him not today.
The phone disconnects and Tony finds himself immediately missing their voices. Pepper must have been their surrogate and she must have remained active in Morgan’s life. He was glad for that. Happy for Pepper, but right now he wanted his children home with him and Steve.
She plucks a strawberry out of the tray and into her mouth seemingly unaffected by the conversation.  Steve lets out a sigh and runs his hand through his hair that was getting too long and needed to be cut.
Before Tony can go to Steve and ask if he’s okay, Peter is running up to him and wrapping his arms around him.
“Banner is staying at the house to wait for Peter. The rest of us are heading into the woods. I’ll head north. Black Widow head east. Hawkeye take west. Falcon will join you in the skies. Everyone head out.”
“But you’re so young,” Peter says as he stares at the little pink cats on the tea cup. They play as if they’re normal children and it almost stops feeling odd to Peter. He starts to feel like he’s over at a friend’s house.
“He doesn’t have a fever so I suspect he is just getting a cold. I don’t think it’s pneumonia. That’s what you need to be worried about after a near drowning incident. I’d recommend a lot of rest and fluids. He’s going to continue to be irritable and that’s completely normal considering. Just be patient with him.”
Peter whines and rests his head in Tony’s neck. Tony throws the jello back onto the tray and wraps both his arms around his son.
“No, Steve should—” Peter lets out a yelp as Tony swats at his bottom like he’s a small child. It of course didn’t hurt but it was unexpected.
“You remember Peter’s first day of kindergarten? He was so nervous to go and you were worried he would cry.”
“Really you’re going to sleep in a bed someone else sweated in? Probably had sex in. You going to lay down in Ben’s dried jizz?”
Beverly reaches across the table for a dish of m&ms. Tony grabs it before she can and puts a small amount of his plate for her. She eats her snacks and lets Tony play the game without interruptions.
Tony checks the shelf again before heading into Peter’s room. The little boy is curled up around his pillow, eyes squeezed shut unnaturally as if he’s pretending to be asleep. “Pete,” Tony says softly. Peter sits up suddenly and holds his arms out, Tony immediately sits on the bed and pulls him into his lap wrapping his arms around him tightly.
Peter presses himself against the tiled wall opposite Steve. Before he can yell at Peter again, Beverly opens the shower door and steps in still in her pajamas. So instead of scolding his son he’s heading over to her and pulling her nightgown up and off her body. He discards her clothes in the corner of the shower and goes to turn on the other shower head.
Peter screams more and slaps Tony’s face knocking his glasses off. Tony steps back and looks at Steve bewildered before he starts laughing. He retrieves his glasses and sets them in their case. “I think that’s a good sign? Awake. Alert. Angry.”
Marie greets Jerry as he walks back in the house. “Sue called. Told me she saw that boy wandering in her yard early yesterday morning. No shoes. In his pajamas.”
“Don’t feel a need to put on a shirt. I’ve missed this,” Tony says as he fingers play with Steve’s nipple.
Tony raises his eyebrow at Steve and wonders how he’ll answer. Did he not tell the girl that he’s her father?
“Oh wow,” Tony says shuffling the papers together and removing his glasses. “Sounds like you have a new friend.” Steve clears his throat and Tony glances up at him. “Your father and I didn’t know where you were,” Tony says as he takes more serious tone.
“JARVIS, call the pediatrician and see if we can get someone out on a house visit. Send them Peter’s hospital records.”
It wasn't Mary Parker but Peter was feeling confused and the word just popped in his head. He didn’t know why he said it aloud.
Steve’s phone rings and interrupts the calm moment. He slides it out of his pocket and sees Natasha’s name flash across the screen.
Steve walks over to Peter, and looks disappointedly between the apparent tea party and his son. “What are you doing in the basement? These aren’t our things. You shouldn’t be in them.”
Peter gets used to having a little sister but doesn't like it. Steve and Tony deal with the challenges of having two kids. Steve gets called on a mission and Tony has to take care of things on his own.
Tony notices the look on his face as he steps back. “I only had a glass. Peter was crying the whole flight. And then the car ride here. And then once we got inside.”
“Point being. Steve. He’s all over the place. I can’t keep everything he’s telling me straight. He didn’t destroy your painting but his pajamas were covered in paint. He didn’t go outside but his feet were covered in dirt and pine needles. He told me…he told me that…” Tony pauses not knowing if he can go there. It’s going to start a fight.
Tony starts to clean up the food as Steve carries Peter over to the couch. He sets him down gently on a cushion and wraps a blanket around him.
Tony has started setting up his latest project on the table. He carefully lays out his tools. He looks up as he hears Peter’s voice. “Probably just a kid walking home.”
A few months have passed and Peter was doing well with recovery. Luckily there was no brain damage and his health had returned to normal. Steve still took him to weekly appointments to see the psychiatrist. They had a follow-up appointment with a specialist at the local hospital that he was dreading. Any mention of doctors or hospitals put Peter into a panic. It took forever to calm him back down. Steve had discussed it with the psychiatrist and there was a plan in place.
Note: If you don’t want a reply, for any reason (sometimes I feel shy when I’m reading and not up to starting a conversation, for example), feel free to sign your comment with “whisper” and I will appreciate it but not respond!
Steve holds out his arms and pulls Peter into his lap as he gets closer. He wraps his arms around him. “I’m really sorry for kicking you Papa. I was scared.”
“Peter said a woman helped him in the woods. Was that another Kitsune?” Tony asks as he sets down one of the pages.
“You’re alright. Daddy and I aren’t mad at you. Find a movie to watch while we clean up,” Steve says as he hands him the remote.
The three of them head down the road to visit the neighbors. They all sit around the patio table eating snacks and drinking coffee and juice. Peter is playing with the dog while occasionally sneaking up to grab a snack cake. Steve is keeping an eye on him while trying to be attentive to the conversation. Jerry begins to tell them the story of the rental house.
They all head to a town nearby for the afternoon. Peter was excited for the lighthouse tour and wouldn’t stop talking about it as they walk up to it. He’s disappointed that there’s a line to wait in.
“Listen baby, look at me—” Steve says tilting Peter’s chin up with his hand. “—You’re not getting in trouble but you better stay out of my things. Understand?” Peter nods at him and seems to calm down a little. Steve sighs and goes to clean up the paint area. Were they doing this wrong? Giving into Peter’s tantrum? He couldn’t stand to watch him cry like that. He was half doing it right, ignoring Peter’s outburst until he calmed down but he wasn’t following through with a punishment.
“The newspaper would be nice. Probably could use more milk,” Steve says as he does a quick inventory of the fridge.
“Steve is pissed off. But not at you baby. Well he is but he’s still your dad. He’s still in your corner.”
“We don’t mind him staying for dinner. We’re actually in the middle of eating, ” Marie interjects as she gestures towards the table.
Steve walks back with Beverly from a nearby beach. She had been excited to see the ocean and play in the warm sand. She carries a bright yellow bucket full of sea shells and rocks she collected. Steve loads their things onto a table before turning on the water to the outdoor shower.  Beverly goes under the water to rinse all the sand and salt off. Steve helps her rinse her hair.
Steve crouches down and tells Peter to climb up on his shoulders, letting the kid have a better view. “What are you complaining about? Look at this view of the lake.”
Steve carries Peter to his room not wanting him to hear any more of it. He was starting to grow annoyed with May and Ben. They didn’t need to be saying things like that in front of Peter. It was going to put ideas in his head. His son was already having a hard time this week. Making up stories and having nightmares. He didn’t need to hear the adults discussing ghosts like they were real.
After the lighthouse tour they pick up sandwiches from a local shop and head to the waterfront park to eat. They roll out a picnic blanket to sit on. Tony was feeling decent earlier in the day but after lunch he started to develop a headache. Steve put his arm around, pulls him close and asks,
“Don’t raise your voice at me! You’re right as always Tony. I’m not doing this,” Pepper says grabbing her bags and heading into the elevator.
On the second day, Peter is getting better and his vitals are looking really well. The doctors decide to take him off oxygen and observe him for a few hours. It’s late in the evening so Tony and Steve are making their makeshift beds on the couches in the room. Peter had fallen asleep while they were playing a card game. With all the medications it was hard for him to stay awake for very long. Steve wakes up a few hours later with a start as the steady sounds of the machines change instead to frantic beeping. He shakes Tony awake before he’s fully aware of his surroundings or what is going on in the room. The two men watch helplessly as doctors and nurses rush into the room. Peter had stopped breathing and gone into respiratory arrest.
He has the kids ready to go out the door, he’s grabbing his keys off the hook when he hears Tony’s voice.
“He’s out there,” Peter says as he runs back up to the sliding door. He presses his finger against the glass. “Right there Dad.”
Peter sits on the bed before he notices the clothes Steve must have laid out for him and gets dressed. He find Tony standing in front of the sink, towel wrapped around his waist. He stands next to him watching him in the mirror. “I didn’t go outside but I told Papa I did.”
He had been absolutely terrified the day Peter had come to live with them. He wasn’t good with children. Not knowing what to do around them. Tony feared he would break like glass if he touched him. Steve was much more natural at it and seemed to dive in head-first. Kissing skinned knees and all those some comforts that kids need. Now it felt like Peter had always been in their lives. He was such a part of it. Tony wanted to be there for him .
Steve cuddles up to his side, resting his head on Tony’s chest. “I had a weird feeling earlier today. It felt like I lost a few minutes. I can’t sleep. My brain is trying to figure out what happened then.”
“He’ll be pissed when he sees your room. Play with my son and all this gets cleaned up before Daddy comes to check on you.”
So this place was bought and Tony tried to decorate it in the modern style he prefers but Steve convinced him to let him do it on his own. Well, mostly on his own, Tony did hire one of the premier mid-century modern experts from New York to style the place. Even though the place was uniquely Steve’s style everything in it reminded him of his husband.
Peter sets down his toy plastic razor and focuses on the bag of toiletries on the counter. After a few minutes he reluctantly says that he isn’t sure. Tony turns towards Peter, slipping his hands under his armpits and hoisting him up, placing him on the counter top. He returns to the sink and rinses off his own face and his razor. He dries his face and then stands directly in front of Peter so they’re making eye contact. He uses the towel to wipe the rest of the shaving cream off of Peter’s face. Peter snorts as shaving cream is inadvertently pushed up his nose. Tony hands him a tissue. “What happened in the woods?”
They finish their ice cream and Steve stands up and walks over to the sink. He grabs some paper towel and wets it. He walks back over to his daughter and starts to clean her face and hands. He laughs as he finds ice cream in her hair. He points it out to Tony before cleaning it up.
He sighs before standing up and heading back inside. He needed to start packing and have the conversation with Tony he had been dreading. They were supposed to be spending Thanksgiving together as a family.
“Sorry,” Peter says as he tries to pull Tony outside so they can see the view from the deck. Tony makes him stay inside so he can check out the lamp. He doesn’t put up a fuss because he knows Tony will actually follow through with his threat.
She kneels in front of him. “How’d you hit your head sweetie?” She asks him questions as she runs through some checks for a concussion.”Will you let me look at it?” He shakes his head and moves further into the couch. “Peter I really have to check.”
Tony returns to the table and lets Peter do things on his own. Peter returns from the bathroom and stands by the table picking at the food on his plate. Carefully taking a bite of each thing before placing it back circling through things in a round robin fashion.
Tony is kneeling by the tub playing with Beverly when Peter finishes cleaning up and returns to the room.
He looks down at Peter and the goosebumps forming on his arms.  He takes one of the towels from Beverly and wraps it around Peter the best he can one handed. Jarvis has said it was important to not let up on the pressure. He glances back at his daughter.
“I will,” Tony says as he helps him down from the vanity and walks back into the bedroom.  Peter goes to open the door as Tony drops his towel and pulls open a drawer to grab underwear. “Shut the door kid! The whole house doesn’t need to see my ass!”
Steve had called Tony earlier saying he really needed to talk with him. Tony was in back to back meetings with stakeholders. By the time he got twenty minutes to himself he was quickly eating lunch and dinner since he never got a chance to eat earlier. He wanted to call his husband but he also needed those twenty minutes to himself to save his sanity. Then the meetings kept dragging on and something came up in the Austrailian office causing an emergency meeting to start up. He was exhausted and wanted nothing more but to collapse into bed.
Peter takes off the shoe he hasn’t finished tying and throws it across the room in Steve’s direction. “You’re a liar! I hate you!”
Steve pulls him close feeling worried, he leans down and kisses the top of his head. There was no little boy standing outside. Peter pulls away from him and starts to open the door. He stops as lightening flashes enveloping the sky in light. Steve grabs the door handle, sliding it shut and locking it. A few seconds later, thunder booms so loudly it feels like the house shakes. Peter is instantly in Steve’s arms burying his face against his stomach.  “You’re okay,” Steve assures him as he rubs his back.
This was all Peter ever wanted, for Tony to be alive and fill that mentor role for him. It was the stuff of dreams and now that it was real it felt off. Nothing was right today, he should be in Tony’s arms letting his tears seep into his shirt. Telling him about everything that happened in the past few years, barely pausing to take a breath or let Tony get a word in. He should be excited and not whatever mess of emotions he was feeling.
“It’s there but it’s faint. Tony, you have to press harder. You might hurt him but the pressure has to be right. You might break a rib but broken ribs are better than brain damage—“  Sam stops himself before adding or death to his sentence.
Tony watches over his shoulder reading along with him until Peter notices and gets annoyed. He turns his body away from Tony and shields his book. Tony invades his space more laughing as he teases him. Peter stands up abruptly.
It had been years since Uncle Ben’s murder. A robbery gone wrong. They worried about Aunt May and who she had to spend her holidays with.
“Are you hungry, Tony? I can order something for lunch. Or I might have something quick I can make us,” Steve starts to ramble as he opens the fridge and digs around for something. “Would you like a sandwich?”
“No,” and she’s back to eating looking upset but she’s off the subject. He missed his chance to get information. They were things he didn’t want to hear or know about.
She runs across the deck to grab her discarded towel. She returns to Tony and holds it out to him. He takes it from her and wraps it around her fastening it like a dress. He pulls her onto her lap so she can continue showing him all her things from the beach.
That morning when Peter comes into the room to wake him up and let him know Beverly’s thrown up on the couch, he barely feels like he can get out of bed. While Peter is droning on about her ruining his tranquil morning disrupting his breakfast and favorite cartoon, Tony wonders where he has picked up such big words and feels a sense of pride.
Peter trudges over to the closet housing the washer and dryer. He grabs the accordion doors and pulls so hard they come off the track. He lets them fall to the floor and starts to load his clothes up in the washer. Muttering to himself as Tony watches sadly from across the room.
Peter wakes up to the sound of toys shuffling in his closet. He opens his eyes slowly and takes a moment to rub the sleep from them. He glances around the room and tries to orient himself. The problem with being the child of a billionaire is that his Dad owned so many properties and they traveled so often that it was easy to wake up in an unfamiliar place. It takes a moment, but he realizes he’s at the house in Malibu. He sees a little girl going through his things and instantly panics. Gone from his mind is the conversation with Tony on the plane about how he would be an older brother and meeting his younger sister today. The only thing he is thinking about is that house in upstate New York with the ghosts. Somehow they had followed him.
She nods at him, her face red and her cheeks wet with tears. Steve turns towards Tony fixing him with a look, ready to return to arguing when the kitchen timer goes off. Tony turns and goes to pull the pan out of the oven. He slams it a little too loudly on the stove top and starts to pull out plates. They clatter loudly as he sets them on the counter top. He huffs as he starts to make up three plates. Two big, and one small just like how he would make it for Peter.
“I know but I’m here now,” Tony says softly before kissing Steve again. “You need a break from this. How long were you holed up in the office going through it?”
Peter doesn’t need to told twice as he bounds up the stairs. Tony is leaning against the kitchen counter by the basement door.
Steve was expecting a slow easy morning to spend with his family. He’s surprised to wake up in an empty bed. He hears Tony yelling at Peter to get his homework together and into his backpack.
Peter does make a sour face unconsciously before hopping off the couch and heading into the kitchen to make a bowl of cereal. He sets the precariously filled bowl on the coffee table and leans over it as he shovels spoonfuls messily into his mouth.
“Not right now Peter!” his voice comes out louder and meaner than he meant to. The anger at Tony still surging through his veins. His voice becomes more menacing when he returns to talking to his husband. “There’s no fucking excuse for this. I can’t believe you put our child in danger like that.”
Tony has searched the whole apartment by the time Steve is making their plates. They sit at the coffee table, Steve hopes the tv will prevent too many questions.
“Steve?” Beverly calls from down the hall. Steve wipes his eyes, and his face becomes a mask with none of the previous emotions on it. A smile spreads across his face as he leans down and opens up his arms. Beverly runs towards him and he picks her up.
“I feel the same way,” Tony says spooning the rest of the food into Peter’s mouth. “You have a treat for dessert,” Tony says as he picks up a plastic container with foil top and reads the label. “Orange Jello.” Tony tears off the top and dips in the spoon. He tries a bit of the orange jello. “Well that was interesting.” He offer Steve a small spoonful.
Tony startles out of his light sleep as the bathroom door pulls open. He feels the bed dip down as Steve gets into it. He doesn’t lie down though and Tony can feel his eyes on his back. Steve’s hand rests on his shoulder. Tony hopes he’ll lean in and kiss his cheek, offering some sort of comfort. Instead Steve moves away and settles into the bed. Making sure he keeps to his own side.
Tony swats Peter’s thigh while using his other hand to hold him in place and keep pressure on the cut. Peter cries out and tries to move away. “I’d had enough of this. You can not hit your Papa and me.”
“I’m ready to go,” he announces as he runs into the living room. Aunt May and Uncle Ben already have their shoes on and Aunt May is packing some things into her large purse. He notices that Tony is missing and Steve does not have his shoes on yet.
She pulls him over to the toys and forces him to sit down. As soon as she lets go Peter immediately tries to stand up. She grabs him and pulls him down to the floor so hard that he becomes dizzy.
“You think I’m beating our fucking kid? Seriously? Where are the bruises Tony? What? I come home from a frustrating day at S.H.I.E.L.D and I take it out on him? I’m not a fucking monster.”
“He’d feel better if he would just sleep,” Steve says as he stares at Tony for a second before grabbing his StarkPad. He’d rather scroll through social media than continue their conversation from earlier.
Tony laughs and Steve starts to kiss down his stomach pulling down Tony’s boxers at the same time. Steve pauses and rests his head against his thigh, “dammit.”
Tony reaches out and pinches Steve’s butt causing him to turn around and slap Tony’s hand. He laughs and shakes his head before sitting on the coffee table. He’s about to tell Tony he’s an asshole just as Peter comes in the room. Peter climbs up onto Tony’s chest and sits on top of him. “Are you sick Daddy?”
The street lamp casts a dim light through the thin curtains into room illuminating Beverly’s figure on the bed as Peter enters the room. She’s sitting up, arms wrapped around her knees as she stares out the window.
After many popsicles and crying the kids were finally in bed. Peter had whined during dinner about his mouth hurting and having to eat soft food. He didn’t think it was fair that Beverly and Tony were eating a different meal from him. It was finally quiet but he couldn’t concentrate on these damn recipes. He picks up his phone and shoots off a message to Pepper asking what time they need to be there for dinner and if he should bring anything.
Peter is taken aback not expecting Steve to be that easy to crack. He follows him to the master bedroom. Steve closes the door before he begins speaking.
“Is this how my father felt? I’m dead and you just let our kids walk all over you. Were you just going to allow this?”
Peter sits up quickly, the joint falls from his hand and starts to burn a hole into his jeans. He curses and quickly throws it into a glass of water.
They watch his tantrum for a minute. Looking at each other deciding what to do. Tony leaves the room mumbling something about how he needs to call Pepper about a business deal before they head out. Leaving Steve to deal with it alone.
Steve goes to the kitchen to help Tony clean up the mess. He had assumed Ben has come to his senses but the two were outside loading up the car. A few minutes later they hear the sound of the engine turning over and see the glare of headlights through the curtains in the front room. Followed by the sound of the car peeling out of the driveway and down the road. “Why did you wake him up?” Steve asks as he put the last can away and shuts the cabinet.
Tony places her in the middle of the couch and brings the gift closer to her. He goes into the kitchen to grab a cup of coffee. Listening to Peter and Steve talking excitedly as Peter decides which one to open first.
Tony checks his phone waiting for Morgan to text back. He was so intrigued by her, there was no topic that would bore him. He found himself cringing with embarrassment as she shares the details of wearing mismatched socks the day she had to read her book report in front of class. His daughter had blamed Pepper for not properly matching her socks on laundry day.
Steve puts in his card and keys in the code. With a big smile on her face she grabs it from the machine. Tony gets an ice cream cone and Steve gets a toasted almond ice cream bar. They go into a sterile looking meeting room with its grey walls. Steve unwraps her ice cream for her before doing his. They chat as they eat their dessert.
“He’s been asking non-stop to see you,” Nick Fury says pointing back towards Tony. “Demanding a lot of other shit too and distracting my team.”
“You need help?” She shakes her head as she pulls off her wet clothes before wrapping a towel around her body.
Peter slides off the bed and follows Steve out of the room. Steve sets him up on the couch with cartoons and a cup of juice. He sits heavily on the couch and puts his feet up on the coffee table. He sits there thinking about whether he should go for a run for not. That was his intention when he got up this morning. It was part of his morning routine but the very thought of going today made his heart rate increase.
“He spent that afternoon screaming and crying before he crashed from all that sugar. He was fine when he woke up from the nap. We went to Mama Rhodes for Christmas dinner. Almost thought we would have to stay home with his earlier behavior,” Tony says as he continues reminiscing. He had no family left and neither did Steve. So their family tradition was to spend it with Tony’s best friend Rhodey and his family.
Steve stifles a laugh, if he started laughing it would definitely wake Tony up. He knew if husband was exhausted and would struggle to fall back asleep.
Peter reaches down and messes with Tony’s hair before trying to grab his sunglasses. He pulls them off and puts them on his face.
Tony stands up suddenly and starts to head out of the room. Everyone turns towards him and watches him leave. He returns a minute later with a thin felt covered box that he opens up the reveal two expensive looking pens.

A couple hours later, Steve is starting to wake up. His body knows it’s late morning and won’t let him sleep any longer even though they got to bed late.  He goes to the bathroom and then starts changing into joggers and a t-shirt. Peter sits up in bed watching him. “You getting out of bed?”
“Now listen. I’ll have to go to SHIELD for a couple days but after that I’m off for a bit. You’ll have as much of me as you want.”
“Yes Baby. It was supposed to be in another month or so. Daddy and I were going to get things ready but it’s been moved up.”
Steve reaches for his wallet in his back pocket and starts to pull out pictures. He finds one that is worn and yellowing. Black and white. A little girl. It looks almost identical to the picture in the folder.  “This is a picture of my mom,” Steve says turning it over showing where it says Sarah and the year 1900.
Tony looks up as Steve enters the sunroom and starts to set up his easel and canvas. Tony puts his pointer finger over his mouth indicating to Steve that he needs to be quiet. Steve mouths to him that he will be. Setting a bag on the table he takes out his paints and wooden palette. The house backed up to a forest and he was planning on painting it. It was early in the day and light was still good for painting. He squirts some paint on the palette and starts to mix some colors.
This was a hard chapter to plot out and write. I hope it flows properly. Phone calls are very awkward to write but I tried.
Tony becomes more sympathetic as he reads the upset look on Steve’s face. “Tony, who the hell would do this? Do you think—” he lowers his voice so only Tony can hear, “—May or Ben did it? Like as a joke?”
“I meant what I said before. Do you really want to open that box? She doesn’t remember. We could destroy this and it would be gone.”
Steve watches angrily in the rear-view mirror. He starts to bang his hands against the steering wheel.
Tony tunes Steve out as he slides the tray of food over. He scoops some vegetables on a fork and offers it to Peter. The child takes it reluctantly and slowly chews the food.  A few minutes pass as he sleepily eats his food.
Steve paced around the living-room of their Condo in DC. He had come down there a few days ago telling Tony he had business at the SHIELD headquarters. It was a property Tony bought not long after they got married. When it became apparent that Steve still needed to spend a week or two a month in town working at headquarters. Tony was less than impressed with the apartments they toured. After a small argument that Steve easily lost, Tony was on the phone with a real estate agent and setting up an appointment to tour luxury condos.
“You can call me Daddy if you want. I don’t know when you’ll see your mother again. SHIELD has that information.”
Peter shakes his head and rests his face against Tony’s chest, his small hand reaches up to poke at his lip. Tony frowns watching him before he gently pulls his hand back from his face.
“There’s a kid at the SHIELD facility. My kid. My DNA. That woman I dated before you. She was pregnant when we broke up. I swear I didn’t know. I would have stayed with her. Raised that kid even if it made me miserable being in a straight relationship.”
She nods at him, her blonde hair falling messily into her face. He pushes it back and wipes the tears from her eyes. He gets her distracted as he has her count things in the room. She’s calming down after a few minutes.
“Steve!” the little girl exclaims as he comes in the room. Beverly jumps up from a spot where she is playing with other girls to run up and run to him. She launches into his arms as he encases her in them. She looks up at Tony as he pulls out of the hug.
“I’ll take the kids to school and you finish getting ready,” he says after breaking the kiss. He goes in for a quick peck.
“Peter!” Steve calls out and his son’s head pokes over the couch. “Stop watching cartoons and get your things together.”
She flicks her rest and the all the drawers from the dresser float out before flipping over and spilling the contents on the floor. She returns the empty drawers to their place. She cocks her head to the side as she stares at him.
Peter pulls out of his grasp and starts running towards the woods. Tony gives chase and quickly catches up to him. “That’s enough Peter,” he growls at him. He starts to spank him. Steve has made his way outside, standing on the deck barefoot watching the two of them. “Who’s the shitty parent now, Tony?” he mocks his husband.
Peter clumsily knocks his cereal bowl over spilling milk across the table  as he tries to hit his sister.
“I love you,” Steve whispers before kissing him again knowing that Tony’s hard edges weren’t as sharp as he tried to portray them to be.
The conversation feels like it’s taking a too serious tone so Steve tries to think of how to change the subject. “Back to the chicken incident.” Steve continues talking about Tony’s cooking mishaps and they end up laughing through the rest of dinner.
Steve adjusts Beverly in his hold before grabbing Peter’s arm and stopping him from throwing another toy.
“I’m awake,” he mutters as he stumbles out of the car. His aunt and uncle come up to hug him. Tony and Steve are already heading inside to open up the house. The owner had left instructions for turning on the well pump and turning up the temperature on the hot water heater. They make quick work of getting all the bags inside and settled into their rooms. Peter’s room was definitely a kids room with two twin beds in it. The style was dated with honey wood and floral comforters.
Tears flood Peter’s eyes as he scoots off the couch. Steve is already returning his focus to his daughter who he is worried about after reading the reports.
“That isn’t good. I don’t want to alarm you. It could be nothing but you should take him to the doctor when you get back.”
Recently he had become obsessed with Goosebumps. Every week Steve would take the kids to the library for a few hours and Peter always came back with a few from that series. All things considered they were worried the books would be too scary and lead to nightmares. It had the opposite effect and seemed to be helping him get through the trauma from earlier in the year.
“Huh?” Tony asks as he looks up from his work. He was still trying to catch up on what he had missed earlier. No work had been completed on the flight over because of Peter’s behavior. Steve is lying on the couch reading something from the New York Times Bestseller list. Beverly repeats her question and waits expectantly for Tony to answer. He’s distracted and doesn’t really hear her question fully. Thinking she wants to go into her room to grab something.
“Sure. It won’t take May that long to get ready.  I just have to brush my teeth and put shoes on,” Ben says as he starts to bring up the booking information. They were to be at the harbor about forty minutes before their whale watching cruise was to go out. Lunch was part of the cruise and afterwards they were going to tour a few lighthouses nearby. He hoped Peter wouldn’t be too crabby by the end of it. They hadn’t decided if they’ll eat out or return to the house to cook. They discuss the plan for a bit before Steve excuses himself.
Steve wanted nothing more than to get home and away from the dark cloud of death. He carefully took off his suit upon returning home and hung it up in the closet. He glances over towards the window as he hears the sound of rain clattering against it. It was early Autumn, the leaves just changing, weather slightly cooler and so much rain.
“What? You don’t want me to touch you?” Tony asks teasing his finger tips against Steve’s hardening penis.
Steve smiles at Tony before heading out of the room to check on their son. He pulls the covers back and it shocked to find the bed empty. He whirls around and pulls open the closet. It’s empty so he head into the hall and looks around. Worry is starting to take over as he starts frantically searching the house. He does a quick sweep of the basement.
In the early hours of Christmas Eve, Tony makes love to his husband. Slow and gentle, trying to do what he can to pull him out of the dark place in his mind. Tony was a bottom by nature, and it wasn’t often they had sex like this. He liked to be the one on his back as Steve thrust into him. Afterward, they cuddle on the couch, before making their way to the bathroom to clean up.
MJ and Peter flit around the kitchen, preparing breakfast and filling thermoses with coffee. Pale morning sunlight is coming in the front windows.
It’s a simple suggestion but it works, she’s munching on her cookie dropping crumbs all over the expensive rug as she opens each gift Steve passes to her.

Peter looks at him hesitantly knowing from his last encounter that the boy wasn’t alive. He can hear someone digging through a box and more giggling. The ghost boy runs towards the noise. “Don’t be shy. You said you wanted to meet him.”
Tony is getting more and more upset. “I hate being away from her. Pepper will get full custody and I won’t be able to see my kids all week.”

The house is dark and quiet as Steve steps inside. It had been almost a month since he had been inside these walls. The familiar smells reach his nose and how much he’s missed his family really hits him. He is beyond exhausted and his shoulder is still throbbing. The mission went well. A few injuries here and there but they had gotten what they were after. Important intel and another Hydra base dismantled and burned to the ground. He sets down a heavy bundle with a thud onto the table before walking softly into his bedroom and thru to the bathroom.
Steve felt safe in Tony’s arms as they cuddled up on the couch after eating. The empty popcorn bowl and glasses of Coca-Cola sat on the coffee table. On the long months of the mission he had forgotten what real comfort felt like. Tony loved him and and in this moment that was all he needed.
“Steve, just—” Tony cuts his sentence short as he hears the sliding door open. He and Steve both turn towards the sound and watch Peter make his way outside.
The next morning, Steve pads down the hall and into the kitchen filling up his water bottle. He is dressed in joggers and a t-shirt, hoping to get in a run before the rest of the house wakes up. He hears light footsteps coming down the hallway and knows that it’s Peter even before he hears him whine out, “Papa”. He wants attention, he buries his face against Steve’s stomach just as his father turns around. Steve tightens the lid on the bottle before he reaches down to rub the back of his head.
Peter wakes up and can’t see a thing. His nightlight has gone out. No light coming in from under the door or through the curtains. His breathing quickens and he tries to cry out but no sound comes. Try as he might he can’t even move his finger. His eyes stare straight up at the ceiling. The nightlight turns back on suddenly spreading it’s orange glow across the ceiling.  He hears the closet open but can’t turn his head to look towards it. Slowly a woman in a white dress with black hair climbs out of the top of closet and across the ceiling. Her long hair hanging down through the air. Her skin is pale and she stops above his bed and twists her neck around so she can see him. Again he tries to scream but he’s unable. He wanted Papa, he would use his super strength to send her back where she came from. He wanted Dad and his Ironman suit to fight the creature. They wouldn’t come they didn’t know he was in distress. Tony’s AI wasn’t wired up to the house to alert his parents that he was getting scared.
Steve continuing laughing and thinks about how Tony is rubbing off too much on their son. He wasn’t even sure if the kid understood that we was being sarcastic. “You know that’s not a nice thing to say. It’s like an insult.”
Tony rests his head against Steve’s and takes a moment to think instead of responding with the first thought that pops into his head. All the sounds in the room are amplified. The beating of their hearts, the hum of the refrigerator, the second hand of the clock on the wall, the quiet lull of traffic from the street below.
Tony wanted to explain himself but he couldn’t find those memories. He didn’t know what to say to Peter. Every time he tried to form the words his head felt like a spike was going through it. Peter slams the lid of the washer down and trudges out of the room and down the hallway to what Tony assumes is the guest room Steve set up the other night.
Peter shrugs and avoids looking at his father. Tony squeezes his knee affectionately. “You can tell me anything. You know that? I won’t get mad.”
“I’ll hire someone to drive my car and the motorcycle back. I’ll get on the schedule today to fly out on my private jet. We’ll return to New York.”
“Papa said Mommy couldn’t come for Christmas but I really want to see her. I thought she would come.”
“What are you looking at, Pete?” Steve asks as he walks up to the desk. He immediately drops the glass of water he’s holding. He stands there in shock as his socks soak up the liquid.
Peter slips and falls down into the bubbles, Tony rushes over to him. Ignoring the pain in his lower back he hoists his son up and to his chest. Peter is pressing his hand over his lip.
Steve’s grip on his arm tightens so much that bruises will certainly form. He turns towards him with a look in his eyes so dark, so menacing that Peter almost feels his bladder let loose. That would be embarrassing, to pee his pants twice in a week. He gets control of it so only a small bit leaks out into his underwear. He tries to pull his arm out of Steve’s grasp. “I need to wake up Daddy.”
“I love you,” Steve whispers against his chest. He feels Tony lean down and kiss the top of his head, he can imagine the smirk on his face.
“You’re going down a path you can’t come back from,” Steve warns before moving to nibble on his neck. “Does this mean you want to be on top?”
“Peter! That’s enough,” Tony cuts in, clearly shaken.  Peter startles and doesn’t understand why Tony is scolding him.
What had Peter left the house in? Did he have shoes? Did he have warm enough clothes on? The temperatures dropped considerably at night enough where a jacket and long pants would be required. They didn’t check his room. Steve had started packing up last night, the plan was to head home in the morning. The story from the neighbors had been unsettling and they were ready to return to the city. Steve would have left Peter’s outfit for today out on the dresser. That wouldn’t have been warm enough either. Most likely it had been shorts and a tank-top. He turns on his mic and reaches out to Steve on the comm.
Tony is staring down into his coffee like it contains the meaning of life. A sad smile is still playing across his lips. The conversation lulls for a bit, Tony too lost in his own thoughts and Steve not knowing what to say.
Tony’s mouth drops open as he enters the main living area, finding that the suds are over three feet high.
“He’s darling,” May says as she pours two cups of coffee. She adds cream and sugar before walking back to their bedroom. Steve could relate with them wanting privacy. He had gotten used to Tony’s lifestyle and staying in luxurious hotels. He would usually spring for the Presidential  Suite. Steve had no idea why they would need two floors and floor-to-ceiling windows in a hotel room. They were bigger than this home they were staying in. They would usually have more than enough space for the two of them. This was feeling cramped to him. Strange for a man who grew up in a one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn but life had changed. He had changed.
The basement is full of things covered in dusty white sheets. He hears things moving around and then a box clatters to the floor.
Steve goes to check on Peter after he hears a loud noise from the room. Peter is throwing things off his dresser and out of his closet.
Tony was his good friend but he had messed that up. Drove him far away, spun a deep chasm between them. They came back together though, when it was needed the most. Time had passed and they started to have an almost functional friendship. One in which Tony was happily married and Steve knew there was no chance there. So every thought about how Tony would look naked in his bed, or the warmth of his skin as they pressed their bodies together, he pushed them down deep. He didn’t allow those thoughts to exist in his mind.
“It’s going to be raining all day. You have to find something to do inside,” Steve says as he hangs up the dishtowel and goes to sit on the couch.  Tony is pulling out his laptop getting ready to do some work. Peter runs over to the couch and climbs onto Steve’s legs.
Tony looks at him quickly goes back to what he is reading. Steve sighs and considers just getting in the shower instead of pushing it.
“Days. Since Coulson stopped by. I know I shouldn’t have lied about why I was going to DC. I wanted to check it out first. Not drag you into it before I was sure. But then I saw her and I knew she was my kid. I felt something. Tony I’m sorry. You have to understand.”
“There’s no room,” Peter says pointing to his sister. “We have to wake her up but she won’t be quiet.”
“Stop touching that right this instant!” Tony raises his voice as he scolds him realizes the Peter is playing with the catheter. Peter withdraws his hands and almost immediately notices the IV in his arm. Steve grabs his hand before he can try pulling that one out.
He realizes something is off when they get to the door. Steve breaks the cameras and the door opening sensor. “Daddy is—”
Peter reluctantly gets into the bed and rolls onto his side facing away from his father. Steve pulls the covers up and tucks him in. Peter moves away as Steve tries to kiss him. “Don’t want a kiss,” Peter says as he waves him off. Steve crosses his arms and sighs as he tries to ignore the feelings of hurt and anger surfacing from Peter’s dismissal. He felt anger at Tony for waking Peter up and taking him out of his room. He was supposed to check that he was there and that was it. Steve turns off the light and shuts the door leaving it cracked as he exits the room. “Goodnight,” he says and Peter doesn’t respond.
His worry grows as he hears them crying and calling for him. He carefully walks further into the room before he sees Peter running towards him.
Tony helps her stand up and they walk out to living-room. She climbs onto the couch and lies down. Tony goes into the kitchen and grabs her medicines from the fridge. He sits on the couch with her and measures out the dose in droppers.  She whines as Tony sits her up and brings the dropper of red Tylenol to her mouth. “Take this one first. I know it’s nasty but it’s the sweet amoxicillin next.”
Peter runs his hand through his damp hair. He was covered in sweat and exhausted. He wanted to talk to Tony, spend every waking moment with him. But right now he just wanted to shower and collapse into bed. Tony would be there tomorrow. Or not and this was all some strange fever dream.
It's getting difficult to write a story set in summer when the high has been around 4 celcius and it's snowing almost every morning. It was still warm weather when I started the story. I'm making it work somehow. The chapter kept getting longer and didn't want to end. I hope it isn't too long. Thanks for reading.
“I spoke to Pete this morning. He’s excited about an experiment. Honestly most of it went over my head but I tried to keep up. He said they got tons of snow in Boston the other night. He went around helping people stuck in the snow,” Steve says trying to stave off the silence.
Steve runs his hand through his hair as his heart starts to thud in his chest. He starts to pace back and forth on the deck. “What the fuck, Tony?”
Tony smiles looking at his messy face and heads back into the kitchen to grab a dishcloth. Peter bawks as Tony rubs at his face.
A few hours later, May and Ben along with Peter are returning from town. Disrupting the quiet peacefulness of the house as they come inside. “We gave him sugar. I’m sorry. Didn’t think it through. You load them up with sugar and then drop them back at home—” Ben explains as they walk in the door.
Peter’s breathing is labored and he clutches his chest trying to calm down. Tony sets the glass down and sits on the coffee table, wanting nothing more than to pull his son into his arms and hold him tight. He was worried about overwhelming Peter, he knew what it was like to be panicking and have someone try to touch you.
He notices Steve’s cell-phone charging on the nightstand and grabs it. He has only been back in this reality for a few days and SHIELD was doing everything to keep him away from technology. He was upset and needing to talk to someone. Not to Steve obviously. He had always relied heavily on Rhodey and Pepper so it would have to be one of them.
“There’s another kid we’re looking to get fostered. Child of a SHIELD agent. Someone left her in the daycare at SHIELD and never came back. Parents are dead. Steve opens the folder and is frozen with shock. There’s a little girl with blonde hair and brown eyes.
Tony is smiling really big at Steve, just drinking him in. Steve wasn’t used to Tony looking at him like that. He lets out a gasp as Tony’s arms wrapped tightly around him.
Her mother must have been mistaken, maybe she didn’t know Steve was married. That his husband didn’t want another child, especially not her. She could make that much out from the conversation. Gathering up her few belongings, Beverly sits down on the floor and pulls her sandals on. She struggles with the straps for a minute, it was a skill she hadn’t quite figure out yet. She stands up and flexes her foot they at least felt passable.
Tony finally gets the alarms working. At 3:30 a.m., he wakes up to his phone buzzing. He grabs it and projects the image onto the closet door. It is very clearly Peter unlocking the sliding door and heading outside. He turns towards Steve and shakes his shoulder until he wakes up.
Steve takes his glass and walks over to the couch, sitting on one of the plush grey cushions. Peter follows him and sits on the couch opposite him.
Marie drops her coffee cup and it spins precariously in the saucer before righting itself. Coffee has splashed on the table so Marie stands up and makes an excuse to go inside. Peter looks over at Steve, not understanding what he said wrong. He could tell that his words had upset Marie.
Steve pulls Tony into a tight hug and cries against his shoulder. “Good God, Tony, what are we going to do?”
He senses Steve standing close behind him as he picks up two of the plates and walks around him to set the table. Steve trails behind him.
Peter tries to ignore Tony moving outside of his peripheral vision. His heart was still beating fast. There was something really wrong and he was feeling overwhelmed. He stares down at the heavy book in his lap trying to read the terse text. Trying to block out the loud voices in the movie. He surprises himself, by concentrating long enough he can make it a few pages.
With a deep breath, he runs out of the room and collides hard into Steve who is on the way to Peter’s room to check on him. He presses his face against Steve’s stomach and starts crying hysterically. “Are you hurt?”
“I’m worried though. Peter looked at me so scared. He had fallen and I just assumed he was being sensitive about that. But the more I think about it I think he was afraid I was going to hurt him. Like I was going to spank him for falling. We don’t really know what happened in that house they pulled him out of. Maybe they hit him for things like that. What if he didn’t fall and I hurt him somehow? Because he really looked afraid of me. I can’t live with myself if that’s the case. He’s my little boy.”
“Where’s Henry?” Peter asks as he lets Beverly into his home. “I thought he was driving from Baltimore with you.”
“FRIDAY, dim the lights to 50%,” Steve says. “You know you have to give her a percent. Are you trying to blind me?”
Tony walks quickly down the hall and  knocks at the door to Peter’s room. Of course Steve would be the one to break their agreement.  Considering everything Peter had gone through his few short years in foster care they had decided against physical discipline.
“Again. I only pretend to,” she says glancing up at him before turning on the television. A foreign language fills the air but Natasha seems to understand it. Steve watches for a minute before tuning it out. His thoughts going back to his children. Beverly was more than safe in Tony’s care. No harm would come to her. Peter, his little worrywort, would be just fine.
Note: If you don’t want a reply, for any reason (sometimes I feel shy when I’m reading and not up to starting a conversation, for example), feel free to sign your comment with “whisper” and I will appreciate it but not respond!
Beverly stops in the middle of tugging her ear and stares up at the older woman before hiding her face in Tony’s neck. Tony looks back at Mrs Potts concerned.
“No listen. He tried to make chicken. And he thought it was like a steak. So he cooked it medium and tried to serve it. Whatever medium is for chicken. It was pink and I had to throw it out.”
Steve heads into the house and Tony sits at the patio table pulling up his phone to go through his emails. Board meeting in the morning, some function Thursday night. Pepper didn’t specify if Steve needed to be there too. It’s important for people to see you’re a family man. The playboy tendencies long in the past. He could use the adoption as a way to get out of it. There was a text from Pepper saying she was going to stop by in the evening. He wonders if she had already been in contact with Coulson and was already working on how they would introduce their next adopted child.
It was a strong contrast to when Peter came to their house. Peter was inconsolable most nights and they struggled with bedtimes. He was a frightful, cautious child who was continually uncomfortable living in a stranger’s house. All the problems had seemed endless and daunting. It was sometimes unbelieve to Steve how Peter seemed to adjust to normal childhood. He knew it was the cause of Peter being afraid when either of his parents left on a mission.
Tony goes down to his level and pulls him to his chest. “How—Did you fall off the bed? What were you doing?”
“Have to admit I’m slightly disappointed. I was gearing up for a huge fight with you. What happened to us? We used to barely be able to have a conversation.”
Peter does what he says and Tony wraps his arm around him pulling him close. He presses his face down into his son’s soft brown curls and inhales deeply. Peter giggles and tries to push his face away. “Why do you do that? Smell my hair?”
Peter sits heavily in the chair, letting the tears roll down his cheeks and not bothering to wipe them. Steve eventually gets up and heads into his office but not before warning to Peter that he isn’t to get up not even a second before the timer ends.
New information comes to light about Beverly and Steve struggles to deal with it. The family tries to have a decent Christmas together.
Steve starts to have a change of heart, he wasn’t angry with Tony just wanted to be firm so he didn’t misinterpret. He wasn’t going to allow Tony to pull him back in like that. He knew how it would end, Tony back with Pepper and Steve alone with his feelings. Much better to just nip it in the bud.
Peter just stands there letting the warm air rush in through the sliding door. It was early September and temperatures were still soaring into the nineties. The humid muggy air mixed weirdly with the cold air from inside.
The words scare Tony and all the awful possibilities cross through his mind. He had been hurt and betrayed by those closest to him before. He loved Steve and trusted him the best a person with major trust issues could.
Tony starts to blink rapidly, not wanting to cry in the moment. He had to hold it together. Steve is crying and Peter is shivering violently in his arms. “Where’s the fucking medevac? We need to get him into something dry,” Tony says angrily.
He walk over to the couch, sits down, and calls his children to join him. Peter is keeping close and already crawling onto his lap. Beverly stops playing and stares over at him. A worried look spreads across her face. She comes over and sits at his side.
Tony’s mind goes to a dark place and he imagines them with bludgeoned faces and dead eyed, morbidly tucked into their beds. He was too tired and late at night the bad thoughts always got to him. Made it impossible to sleep. Made him think his husband was capable of being so heinous.
I just looked at my snapshots in Scrivener for this chapter. I've been working on it since December 1st of last year. It's been so long. We're under shelter in place where I live and I thought being home all the time would help me write. It's taken a bit but I'm finding time. I'm excited for this story and want to get it out there. But I also want it just right. And some days writing seems like a chore and I would rather write when it feels enjoyable. So I'm doing what I can to get back to writing on a regular basis.
The doctor puts the swab back in the tube and looks at Peter. “We have one more test buddy and that’s it. Okay?”
“Pops told me something one day and it always sticks in my mind. He said that he’s never loved anyone as much as he loved Daddy. He could never open himself up to another person like that again. That it hurt too much when everything fell apart. I feel like that sometimes. Like I shouldn’t let people too close.”
Steve sets his sketchbook on the table unceremoniously and the pencil rolls off and across the table. The blond man lets out a heavy sigh.
Steve is already out of the room and heading outside. Shouting Peter’s name. He’s soon joined by Tony who’s holding a broken camera in his hand. It was what he had placed above the sliding door to alert him if Peter was sneaking out. “Peter trashed our phones. And this. I’ll put on my suit and fly over the forest to look for a heat signature.”
“The birth certificate should be ready in a few weeks. They’ll mail it out to you. Our legal team will file everything with the court.”
Tony sits at the dining table finishing up his project despite his headache.. He ignores the calls coming in from Steve on his phone. It had been hours and was past dinner time. He didn’t want to talk to him. It had taken almost that much time to get Peter to calm down again. He said he had a bad dream during his nap and then Steve had scared him when he starting yelling. In the past few minutes, Peter had been complaining he was hungry. Tony had given him a bag of chips. He was about to look through the fridge for something they could eat when Steve comes in the door with greasy burgers and milkshakes. “I got your favorite Pete. Strawberry. And chocolate for you, my love,” he says as he hands one to Tony. He leans down to kiss him and surprisingly the kiss is returned. “I broke some gym equipment. You’ll be seeing a charge soon.”
Steve knocks on the screen door as he stands on the porch. He can hear the dog barking from within the house and Peter appears at the door closely followed by Marie. It frustrated him that they were letting Peter answer the door. It was never a problem in the tower because no-one had made it that far through security to get up to the penthouse. Also there wasn’t a door just the private elevator. They did stay at the mansion sometimes. The one Tony grew up in but staff would be there days before they even showed up. Someone was always stationed at the gate. The point being in Tony and Steve’s line of work they dealt with dangerous people and anyone could be showing up at the door. The last person they wanted opening the door was their young child. Steve doesn’t comment on it as they invite him in the house.
That’s when Peter notices the dead eye lady in the corner. He jumps off the bed and she starts to walk towards him. Steve always left his door cracked in case he got scared. The door slams loudly as he’s just inches away from pulling it open. He looks back at the ghosts and his breath quickens. His parents would hear the door slamming and one of them would come to check on him.
Peter stands up and waits for the two other children to set everything up before sitting down again.
A few minutes later, Peter returns from the bathroom and stands in front of Tony staring into his face. Standing so close that Tony can feel his breath against his nose. Tony opens his eyes.
Peter is worn out from another day of sight-seeing and goes to bed early without much of a fuss. He had behaved pretty well the whole day. They only had the one incident in the morning where he had messed with Steve’s painting again. Instead of throwing a tantrum he sat nicely for his time-out. It was an especially hot day and the heat was holding strong after dark. May and Ben had brought the ingredients to make margaritas.
Tony grabs a sucker from the kitchen and is unwrapping it as he walks back to the couch. He shoves it into Peter’s mouth. It immediately drops out sticking to Steve’s white shirt. “Oh god, Tony? Why?”
“Jerry and Marie invited us over. Do you want to play with Bailey?” Steve says trying to negotiate with him. Peter nods his head. Steve wipes at his tears again. “Then stop crying. It’s only cookies.”
Sorry it's been a while for the update. I hope you enjoy the chapter. I've changed this to a four chapter story because there is more I want to cover.
Steve has a flurry of emotions running through his head as he carries her upstairs. It had been mere months since Peter’s near drowning. Tony’s words are running through his head. He hated the implication of them. His husband blamed him for Peter’s disappearance. Steve was the one watching him that morning. You’re not fucking watching her? You’ve lost another a kid? It wasn’t really what had said but Steve fills in the negativity in his head.
“It’s alright buddy,” Tony assures him as he rubs his arm. “We’ll try again. You have been gentle when you put something in someone’s mouth.”
“You brought our son back in one piece. Thank you,” Tony says to them from his spot on the couch. He was lying on his back looking exhausted.
Tony grabs his arm before he can run up the stairs. Peter looks up at him pleadingly, tears in his eyes.
“Let’s get you inside,” Steve says pulling him back and leading him inside. He fixes a glass of water for Tony and leaves him standing at the kitchen counter when he realizes Fury is still standing outside.
The computer takes a minute to load up, and a few more minutes for the internet browser to load. He types ‘who is Tony Stark married to?’ in the search bar. Marie is looking over his shoulder as the results load.
Peter sits on his bed feeling really bored, absentmindedly swinging his legs. He hated having to sit still in time-out. He wanted to read his book or play with his toys but if Steve caught him he would add more time to the punishment. It felt oddly quiet in the room he couldn’t hear the rest of them in the house. The sound of the closet door opening causes him to go completely still. It wasn’t really happening he tries to convince himself as he slowly watches it opening. It creaked loudly and his first thought is that Steve is going to hear, come into his room and scold him for playing in the closet.  More time added. The thought is fleeting when he sees the long black hair move out of the closet. It’s attached the white ghost body of the woman from the other night. Ghosts don’t come out during the day. Not when you’re awake. Peter must have fallen asleep. This couldn’t be happening.
Steve was calling home every night to talk with his family. The guilt over lying to Tony was getting to be too much. He wasn’t here for work at all and eventually he would have to tell him the truth. So Steve picks up his phone like he does every night at eight and presses the button to call his husband. Once the pleasantries are out of the way and he’s listened to Peter’s story about his day, he decides to come clean to Tony.
“I’m sorry. I don’t know why I yelled like that. I don’t want to fight. I can’t deal with this. From the second I realized he was missing I’ve had this heaviness in my stomach. I can’t relax.”
Tony walks over to where Beverly is at, sitting down and reaching his arm under the table. Beverly looks at him for a second watching his face. For it to be kind and welcoming? Tony isn’t sure but she does move closer, letting Tony pull her into his lap.
Peter is opening and closing his mouth like a goldfish gasping for breath. He’s too shocked to even begin to form words in response.
The next morning is slow moving as Tony sits on the couch to drink his coffee. Peter is curled up under a blanket talking Tony’s ear off. Tony is trying to listen but isn’t fully awake enough yet. Beverly is all energy, running back and forth across the room.
Steve blinks and lets the tears fall. Tony moves in and kisses him, offering comfort the best way he knows how. He then rests his hand on Steve’s shoulder before pulling back and looking into his eyes. He wanted to reassure him that everything would be okay but he didn’t want to make that promise.
Peter leans in and wipes his tears on Steve’s shoulder. That was probably the most he would get out of Peter in the interaction.
“Don’t tell me to chill. He was literally not breathing without assistance ten minutes ago. You’re going to get his heart rate up and his breathing ragged. Great idea.”
Peter hears loud footsteps coming down the stairs and he turns slowly to see Steve. “Tony! He’s down here!”
He wasn’t surprised, he knew he would be called out on a mission soon. He wanted more time to settle in with the kids and he thought they had another couple of weeks.  New intel came in and they had to move today or they would miss their opportunity.
Ron watches him expectantly waiting for more of an explanation on the little girl. Beverly is starting to slide down his hip so he adjusts her in his arms.
Steve has his bag on the table and is going through his checklist. Tony is pulling on a shirt before heading out of the bedroom.
Peter’s fingers are slipping back into his mouth rubbing against the sore spot. Tony is grabbing his wrist again. He lets it go and cards his fingers through Peter’s soft curls instead. It wasn’t a battle he was going to win.
“Sorry and I didn’t ask the neighbor’s permission. I just went into their yard to play with the dog. And Daddy says that isn’t ok but—” he trails off and looks up at Steve expectantly. Not noticing that he’s reverting back to that thing where he doesn’t differentiate his fathers.
The room is quiet besides the fan and Peter’s crying. Tony tries to tune it out and fall back asleep. Everytime he starts to drift off, Peter starts asking for Steve.
“You all buckled in? How about we watch your favorite movie when we get home? A big bowl of buttery popcorn. Maybe even a chocolate bar to go with it.”
He straddles Tony and presses him against the headboard as he kisses him. First on the mouth, then the cheek before he makes his way down his neck. He pulls Tony’s shirt back and kisses collarbone and then across his shoulder.
He had spoken to Steve earlier that day or had it been yesterday? It was all blending together as he stays up all hours still trying to work as Pepper takes over as much responsibility as she can. Steve had let him know that the mission was  delayed and they’ll still be another few weeks. He promises to find someone to help. Tony didn’t know how Steve thought he could do a better job finding a nanny when he’s thousands of miles away.
Peter jumps up as Steve call his name and considers going back to the chair to do his time out but it’s too late. He looks down guiltily avoiding his father’s gaze.
“It’s always the same thing. I should think of something else,” Tony says starting to second guess his gift.
A few days go by and soon all three of them are sick. Tony is struggling to take care of everyone. Steve is really worried when they talk on the phone again. He talks to Pepper but she’s too busy taking over his responsibilities to offer much assistant. She assures Steve that she’s set up food delivery and checked in on him a few times.
“I’m sorry for your loss,” Steve says softly. Although his thoughts about it were complicated. Mary and Richard had to die for him to have his son. It was a cruel reality. He could never say that he wished it hadn’t happened. He didn’t know what that said about him as a father. Did he really have Peter’s best interests in mind?
“We found something,” Natasha says, not being one for social niceties. Hello, how are you?  was a waste of conversation.
“Get up,” a voice says coldly. It’s no longer a voice that Peter recognizes. He looks up and doesn’t understand what is standing before him. It has a ghost white face with black lips and eyes darkened with kohl like a raccoon. An almost translucent dress hangs like a sheath on its body. The hair is long and grey and messy. Upon its head is a crown, made suspiciously out of bones. He hoped it wasn’t human bones but it reminded him of a spine. The wind is knocked from him as the creature starts to kick him.
Steve kisses down his neck, down his chest, his mouth pausing over a nipple hot breath teasing the sensitive skin. “I miss you,” Steve pleads with him showing a vulnerability he only lets a few people see. Both men look towards the kitchen suddenly as it sounds like something had slid off the counter and crashed onto the floor. They both look at each other uncertain. A few seconds later the same sound and then it repeats again. Until suddenly it sounds like a pile of things crashing into the ground. Steve pushes himself up and quickly grabs his shield from behind the dresser and looks back at Tony. “Stay in here, I’ll check it out.”

“Point being. He’s in a coma and she lies to everyone about being engaged to him. Why are you filling Tony’s head with this bullshit?”
Thor flips his long blond hair and Beverly reaches out to touch it. Tony grabs her hand stopping her. “You need to ask first,” he reprimands her.
The bowl of pasta had fallen to the floor, the glass breaking, red sauce spreading across the white tile.
Steve is so deep in thought, he doesn’t realize the tears spilling down his face and the breath he’s holding in. He doesn’t notice until Tony is kissing him and telling him everything will be alright. Tony presses his face against Steve’s. “I’ll think on it. Give me a night. You’ve sprung this on me. I can’t. I can’t make a decision like this in a couple hours. Having a little girl could be good for us. Good for Peter.”
“How long have you lived here? Did you know the family that lived in our house before?” Peter asks wanting to be a part of the conversation.
Steve gets up and goes to the kitchen, making both of them glasses of water. He hands one to Tony before sitting on the couch.
“That’s good. I haven’t changed your diaper recently. Didn’t put you in pull-ups overnight. Any accidents?”
She shakes her head before resting it against Tony’s chest. She keeps telling Tony what cards to play and asking loudly about the cards he has. It’s causing Tony to lose the game and other people at the table to laugh.
Beverly is throwing the cards all over the place as Peter tries to pick them up. He rushes over to them Before he can even make it to them she’s running towards the water. He shouts at her and she stops turning back towards him. She walks back over to the area and Steve scolds her telling her to help Peter clean up. In a matter of minutes, everything is packed back up and they are heading towards the house. He ends up having to carry Beverly as she starts to complain about how difficult the sand is to walk through. He’s expecting Peter to put up a fuss but he just holds Steve’s hand keeps looking down at the sandy beach.
Peter leans his back against the coffee table and his hand reaches out to smooth her sweater back down.
Peter sits heavily on the couch, he flings his mask onto the table. He puts his feet up onto the coffee table.
“You’re alright, baby girl,” he reassures her before kissing her cheek. “It happens to Daddy too. Feeling like the world is closing in on you?”
Peter pulls out of his arms and off his lap to sit next to him. He lets out a sigh and plays with the loose fabric of his pants. “Are you…what does this mean? For everything?”
Steve sits on the floor tentatively by them, careful not to get too close and spook Peter again. Peter pulls back from Tony and glances over at Steve. “It’s really Papa and not the creature?”
Tony is already standing up and putting on his watch, getting ready to transform into Iron Man if needed. “What? Stay behind?” Tony complains as he  tries to push past Steve and get to the kitchen first. He flips on the lights and they see all the cabinet doors open. Canned food has fallen off the shelves scattered on the counters and floor. Ben and May enter to room and take in the mess.
The house is decorated for Christmas but it isn’t feeling festive. Steve has to go through the files. There was a high chance he would come across ones about his daughter. He had no doubts that Hydra had done something to her. He had to keep his anger in check because if Julia and Tim weren’t dead he would have killed them himself. He didn’t know how someone could let their child be experimented on. He didn’t care that they had second thoughts and did the right thing.
Tony enjoyed hearing about her adventures in the woods surrounding their home. Morgan was incredibly imaginative and told him an elaborate story about a clearing she had found. From what she described, Tony assumed a shed had once stood there. Now it was just rotted boards and rusted nails. Rusted out yard equipment. Morgan told him about a girl who lived there and got to play all day. Being friends with wild foxes and deer. Without parents to make her go to school or do chores. Tony was fascinated by her story but worried about the dangers. He had warned her to not step on the boards or touch the rusty metal.
“Thanks,” Steve says offering his hand and looking at the whiteboard that listed out Peter’s doctor and nurse. “Stephanie, we appreciate it.”
Peter’s eyes shoot open and he sucks in a breath. He starts trying to push away Sam’s hands that are still doing compressions. Sam stops and looks at Tony. “He’s responsive but we have to get him to a hospital.”
Tony sets his tools down and walks over to the them. Peter stands up on the couch and pulls up Tony’s shirt exposing the arc reactor. Steve sits up straighter and teases his fingers over Tony’s stomach. “I feel better already,” Steve says as he flirts with him before leaning in and kissing his stomach. Tony laughs and pushes his face away.
“I’m a puppy,” Bev says before barking and rubbing her face against his leg as he comes back in the house.
“God dammit Peter. What did I just tell you?” Steve scolds his patience razor-thin from the stress of the mission. It was always an adjustment returning to domestic life.
Steve shuts the door and stares at his friend who has been dead for the past six years. They had a funeral. There was no coming back from that, he had died. So much of the world had mourned Iron Man.
Phil stands up, grabs his briefcase and walks over to the table. He sets two folders on the table as the other two men make cups of coffee. He makes a cup for himself before he opens the top folder.
“I’ve explained it to you and SHIELD will show you the files. She’s just a kid,” Steve says getting annoyed.
“I met the children who used to live there. Do you have a daughter named Katie? Ashley wanted me to tell her hello.”
They sit in silence on the couch, both staring at the empty bed. Steve’s hand is wrapped tightly in Tony’s. Steve rests his head on his husband’s shoulder. “Remember that first Christmas with him?”
Steve paced the modestly-sized great room nervous as he waited for Tony to show up. He would be here any minute and there would be a confrontation. He goes to the window and pulls back the drapes to peek out at the road. He startles as the door pulls open. Tony walks in and doesn’t acknowledge him and instead walks to the bathroom.
Peter couldn’t imagine having Steve as a father. He was fond of the man but he also didn’t feel like he knew him well. The man cared about him but also held him at an arm's length. The relationship felt more peer-to-peer than anything else. Steve seemed like he would be one of those strict, spare the rod, spoil the child types.
“I know I didn’t mean to yell at you,” Steve says coming back into the room. Beverly decides to tip her bowl over, giggling as she watches the mess.
Pepper gets to her before Tony does and smooths down her dress. “Sweetie, don’t show people your underwear.”
“But I want to!” Beverly cries hitting her tray with her hand knocking a few blueberries loose and they roll across the table onto the floor.
Peter wraps the blankets tighter around himself and moves closer to the edge of the couch. “No! You’re only doing that because I said something.”
“How you feeling, man? You want to come inside and visit for a minute?” Steve asks his hand still resting on Tony’s shoulder.
“That’s rich. I’m sure that’s it. I’m not seeing big fan-fare about his return from the dead. So who knows? You and who else? No-one I bet. So you take advantage. Are you sure it’s not because you like the feel of his lips around your cock?”
“Hey Steve, do you have a minute?” Peter asks as he comes into the room after cleaning up the dishes from dinner.
“Do you want Papa to kiss your boo-boo?” Steve blows on the skinned knee before placing soft kisses on both of his knees. Peter’s tears of panic turn to those of relief. He might have been too old for this level of coddling but he really needed it at that moment. Only moments ago he had been terrified that Steve was going to hurt him.
“Do you honestly think you weren’t married to Pepper? Really? Do you think you’re married to Steve? Are you two even gay?” Peter goes on walking out of the kitchen and around to the dining area.
Steve pats his shoulder even though he wants nothing more than to pull Tony into a hug. Even if it was some weird illusion, he wanted to at least have that. Some comfort to make this day bearable.
Peter sighs and does what he’s told. “So this is your husband, Steve? You didn’t tell us you’re married to the Tony Stark.”
“Tony, I’m sitting here with you now asking your opinion,” Steve says as he leans forward and wrings out his hands.“Her name’s Beverly Rose. Born September 30th, 2003. She’s a really sweat kid. She’s polite. I’ve spent a lot of time with her. She’d fit in with our family.”
Peter freezes at the sound of his father’s voice and slowly turns back towards him. His eyes meet Tony’s but they don’t seem to register anything. He then looks up towards his left before he takes the steps off the deck and into the soft wet grass.
May smiles down at him and leans in to kiss him. She was impressed with the way they were raising her nephew. She and Ben had been much too young when the accident happened. They were seniors in college not even engaged yet. They were doing internships on top of school full time. There was no way they could take care of a child. It was hard on Ben seeing him move from foster home to foster home. It had been painful when they found out the adoption was going through. The Starks had been nothing but wonderful to them though. Peter had even done a couple over-nights at their home. She was glad they accepted the invite and were getting a whole week to spend with their nephew. He was really thriving and happy. “I love you too kid,” she says softly as she leaves the room, closing the door softly.
Steve gets called out on a mission over the holidays. Tony is stuck with two sick kids and has some unexpected visitors.
Steve starts to walk towards the bed but the doctors yell at him to keep out of the way. Tony stands up and wraps his arm around him. They watch the scene play out in front of them as if it’s a movie. The dcotors and nurses are struggling to get Peter breathing again and another machine is starting to beep as he goes into cardiac arrest. Tony feels his knees going weak and feels like he’s going to fall when Steve grabs him and pulls him back up. They’re shocking his heart with the defibrillator pads. It’s hard from them to watch but they don’t turn away. It takes a few tries and Peter’s heart is beating again. An oxygen mask is being pulled over his face but he seems to be breathing again.
Peter is wiping at his cheek with the sleeve of his flannel. So child-like and innocent but the tone of his voice doesn’t reflect that. Tony misses the innocent teenager he once knew.
“Maybe we should? She’d been hospitalized for it. She would have had an easier time if she wasn’t worried about you two. You don’t know how your kids were when you had to leave. They were scared. Peter would—”
Peter is quiet for a minute before telling Tony he can come in. He rolls onto his side as Tony sits on the bed. Tony reaches down and wipes his tears away with the heel of his hand. He never really knew what to do when it came to comforting his child. Lord knew Howard was never one to offer comfort. Stark men are made of iron. Tony still held onto this fear of letting other people in. Even his own child, it seemed like everyone he loved would eventually be torn away from him.
“Another ability they have is possession and I believe that is what happened to the family. It could have been seeking revenge.  It ranges from petty like being disturbed during a nap to something like a cub being killed. Perhaps they were having issues with foxes being pests on the property and the man shot one. We think with your case that you may have disturbed their nest walking through the woods,” Phil says as he passes around various pages. Careful to hand them to Steve because he remembers Tony’s odd dislike of being handed things.
“Five. Almost six. I think it would be a good age for a sibling for Peter. They won’t be too far apart.”
“14 years ago I was drinking heavily and sleeping with whoever would have me. She was a pretty Shield agent. I didn’t know she was married or maybe I did.”
Peter wakes Steve up as he crawls into their bed as he’s trying to get under the covers. Steve lifts the covers up so Peter can slide under. He goes to encase Peter in his arms and pull him close. “No,” Peter whines. He just wants to lie on his back in-between his fathers. No snuggling.
Peter looks in-between the both of them. This wasn’t going how he planned. Tony being overly caring and concerned while Steve being standoffish and doesn’t want to engage.
Peter sighs and stomps back inside, pulling the door closed behind him. Locking it automatically, not even thinking about what he’s doing.  He lays across all three cushions of the couch and grabs the remote off the coffee table.
Peter reluctantly comes in the room still holding the offending toy. He quickly hides it behind his back when he sees Steve eyeing it. “You can not hit your sister, do you understand me?”
He looks down the hallway towards the bedroom. He doesn’t hear the shower running or Tony moving around.
And later as his babies grew into teenagers and things with Steve started to fall apart. The arguments, the shouting, the slamming of doors. The weary looks from his children as their parents tried to pretend everything was perfect. It hadn’t lasted and soon he was all alone. Not long before the house was filled with Pepper’s laughter and the rooms started to reflect her taste. Morgan was born and he was getting to experience having a baby for the first time. Staying up all hours of the night as the little colicky baby cried endlessly. His daughter getting her first tooth, taking her first step, saying her first word. It all happened in this room. It was back to being empty and another person was leaving him. Tony didn’t know if he had the strength to do it again. They always left. Everyone did. That was his life.
Tony can’t find Beverly in her room. The bed is unmade, obviously slept in but empty now. Whenever Peter had a stomach bug he would end up sleeping on the bathroom floor close to the toilet so Tony was fully expecting to find his daughter curled up with a blanket on the rug. The bathroom is empty so he pulls the shower curtain open. Empty besides the bottles of kid shampoo and body wash, and a basket of bright foam toys in a hanging basket affixed to the tiled wall.
