Sam lifted his hand from his chest and placed a kiss on the back of it.
“Aren’t you a cat person?”
Toni offered a brief smile.
“You’d go to him a few times a week, one of us can go if that would make you more comfortable. And yes, you’d still be one of us.” Charles had actually already reached out to her, sensing something about Wanda. The Avengers themselves didn’t know much about Wanda’s powers or how to help her with the parts she couldn’t control or handle.
“Go take a shower while we clean up and we can watch a movie afterwards.” Always with the team movie nights. She'd have to make sure Happy and Pepper come next time. They're always so busy but Toni was sure she could get them to come. “Vision’s currently reading but I’m sure we can grab him.” He leaned in and placed his mouth over hers. She lifted herself onto her tip toes and moved her hands to his hair to deepen the kiss. It was a lazy kiss, just to show affection. There was still passion, but not like their usual kisses. It was sweet and slow and she couldn’t help her moan.
Like you and me, teddy bears could walk and dance and love and cry. No one had ever seen a teddy bear walk, however, for they hid it very well. Teddies knew that once humans knew that they were alive, they would no longer love them, they would become something abnormal, something incomprehensible, and that would be unacceptable. That was because teddies lived on love, they fed on the love that others unconditionally gave them, their joyful burst of energy and their happiness all came from this. Once a teddy was no longer loved, it died and left behind a teddy carcass, under human eyes seemingly no different from any other teddies, but other teddies could feel that it was no longer there, a lifeless loveless body. For centuries and centuries, ever since the first teddy was stitched together from patches of cloth, that was the way it had always been. No one knew when teddy bears became alive, no one knew how, no one knew why. Teddies did not question it either, for them there was only one ultimate truth:
“Wait… you love me?”
“Oh my god you were! Did Bucky see? Poor baby, did you traumatise him?”
“Be nice to them, they belonged to a dear friend of mine.”
“Of course we do, all of us did. You broke Coulson’s heart by the way, he put it down to last week. Too bad he had no idea how chicken you are.”
“Tony, you don’t watch movies with Dummy. Literally what you do is telling JARVIS to turn on Netflix and abandoning the bots in front of the screen so that they can be kept busy while you work on your projects. The last time Dummy and Butterfingers and U wanted to watch the movie I sat and watched it with them. Which is probably why I can recognise them before everyone else.”
“Stark, you know better than avoiding time with your children. If you keep on working all the time, at this rate the kids are going to like Daddy Steve more than you.”
The next day, photos of Rhodeybear was everywhere on the front of newspapers. Journalists swarmed at the gate of the mansion, yelling for Obie, for Edward, for anyone they could see through the drawn curtains. Obie barged into the workshop that morning, face red with fury and foaming at the mouth, demanding an explanation from them. Ironteddy had never been more terrified. With shaking paws, they tried to explain what happened to Obie. Obie listened to them and paced around the workshop with quick stamping steps, brows drawn together and face scrunched in thought.
Ironteddy had expected to have to beg, to plea, to do horrible things for Thanos in exchange for his wish. Yet, nothing of the sort happened. Thanos just patted Ironteddy’s head with his giant purple hand, a hand so huge and savage, yet so warm and comforting, not unlike that of Mr Stark and Obie, a long long time ago. Ironteddy felt a warmth radiating from Thanos, not from love for Ironteddy, but for someone else, a love so fierce that even a normal teddy bear could feel, a love most unrequited, for the object of said love was already too far from reach.
Ironteddy was no longer a tough-looking toy. He was now a superhero.
Never would Steve think that he would have to fight Bucky for Tony. But, drastic time called for drastic measures. And so, one evening when they were in bed, with Tony working on his tablet, Steve reading a book with an arm around Tony’s waist and Bucky yet again snuggling along Tony’s right leg, as Bucky gave him a growl before snuggling closer to Tony, Steve glared at him and mouthed:
“But I still-“
“You knew?” Steve didn’t even swallow his bite but looked a little annoyed. He always did when Rhodey rubbed in his how long he and Toni have known each other and how close they are. Which, honestly, stupid. One, he wasn’t even straight. And two, Honey Bear just had fun messing with all the guys or girls she dated.
“Yes. Did them in myself.”
Maybe because Toni needed it too.
“Clint has almost been talking to me about ‘mind consent’. I can’t just enter someone’s mind or push my own thoughts and feelings into them. He had told me about Loki.” Toni flinched. Clint was still having a hard time about Loki, even all these years later. She was glad she had found him the best therapist to help him through it. “I cannot stop the vibes I get, but I don’t push them. While I have control over much of my powers, that I don’t have the best control in. It can get hard sometimes.”
“I’ve always wanted to try your cooking. If it taste as good as it smells, you might have to start doing it.” Natasha knew? Oh, who was she kidding – of course Natasha knew. Toni scowled at her but the Russian merely ignored her and grabbed a few bowls. “Is it ready?”
Okay, she was a bit of child herself.
That would have been a nightmare.
“I will tell the others. If you do not know that I did that, they don’t either.” Wanda paused, arms moving to hug herself. “It is only right that I do. Ultron was. . . partly my fault.” Taking a shaking breath, Toni let herself sit back onto her feet.
Toni smiled.
The big money question. Client or Steve should have one this. Wanda was looking very unhappy. Maybe she had been too blunt?
“You’ve been standing outside my door for five minutes.”
“I’ll call him as soon as I can. His school is only about an hour away from the Compound – less if we take the jet.” Stretching, she heard another bone pop. “Ugh, I’m getting too old to sit like that.” Wanda giggled and Toni smiled at being able to bring that out of her. “You going to be okay?” Wanda took a moment to think before smiling a little.
Mr Stark did not inherit the toy factory from his family; rather, he built it from the ground. Years ago, he was in the Army across the ocean fighting a seemingly endless war. He was shipped out when he was barely a man grown, like other boys his age, too old to be a child still yet too young to anticipate the horrors of war. Mr Stark, once dreamed of being an engineer, of making fast planes and big bombs, had to put his books and tools away and swung a rifle over his shoulder. War zone was no place for dreams. Mr Stark saw around him villages burning to the ground, heard his comrades' anguished cries as they bled on dark foreign soil. He felt fire on his skin and smelled rotten flesh as they marched through bloody battlefields. It was enough horror to traumatise a man over and over and Mr Stark was no exception. As the moon waxed and waned, as the clouds in the sky rolled with storm, as the screeching sound of bomber planes screamed down at him, Mr Stark fell into great despair.
But before that could happen, there was the Chitauri.
“But…”
“I’m in love with you too.”
They mostly found the situation hilarious, but Steve himself was at his wit’s end.
Steve climbed up on Tony’s other side, sat leaning against the headrest and let Tony rest his head on his shoulder, petting the soft strands of his hair and massaging his scalp until he moaned tiredly. As Tony slowly drifted into sleep, he caught Bucky’s eyes, but this time, he did not look smug or threatening, only quietly speculative, and when Steve reached out to him with his other hand, Bucky licked his fingers and let him play with his ears.
Rhodeybear hugged him and told him he would stay with him, but Ironteddy just shook his head. The Avengerteddies needed a heavy-hitter on the team, now that Hulkteddy and Thorteddy and Ironteddy were gone. They needed Rhodeybear with them. Besides, he could always come for a visit.
“Um, guys,” Bruce said after a couple of minutes of Avengers-looking-like-an-upset-school-principal and Fantastic-Four-looking-like-teenagers-caught-smoking, “what are we going to do about this thing?”
There were a lot of shooting on Sergeant’s side and screaming on Captain’s. Ironteddy tried to help, he raised an arm up, aiming the repulsor at Sergeant, but Captain only glared at him and raised an arm out to block his paw from Sergeant. Then, a bullet grazed Captain’s left ear and they remembered that there was an infamous assassin standing in front of them. Sergeant dashed forward and slammed into Ironteddy, knocking him aside and he fell into a fountain nearby. By the time he was out of the water, Sergeant had abandoned his gun and was trading blows with Captain, who was on the defensive and never once tried to attack. Their movements were so fast Ironteddy could not aim at Sergeant without avoiding Captain, and so he asked JARVIS to contact the other Avengerteddies, all the while keeping an eye on the dueling pair. In no time, they heard the hissing sound of the Quinjet engine and Sergeant, after a second’s thought, abandoned the fight and ran into the bushes. Captain was primed to run after him, but he was also somewhat tattered after the fight and Ironteddy held him back, silently begging him to leave it.
“STEVE.”
The next time he was aware of anything, Bucky was sitting in front of him, his right paw placed on his thigh, big soulful eyes looking straight into his soul. Steve ignored everyone else around him and slid down onto the floor, hugging Bucky and sobbing into his warm matted fur, feeling Bucky’s rumble travelling through his body into Steve’s chest, absorbing and sharing the agony of the one other being who also loved Tony that much, his brother who knew his pain inside and out.
One of the alien objects, which Bruce did not feel inclined to name before he knew more about their origins, started to shake quite violently. From Bruce’s vantage point, it looked nothing more than a pile of mechanical parts, with two caterpillar tracks on top of its cube-shaped rusty body. Which was quite peculiar and impractical, seeing that the tracks would make for a much better movement system. Then, with a whirr, the object suddenly flipped on itself and planted its tracks firmly onto the ground (… or, that was exactly what they were for). Then it was completely still. The other alien-thing was rice grain-like, all shiny and white with a black screen at the front and hovered about a foot from the ground.
Ironteddy thought, and so he followed them through the portal, walking away from Pepper’s worried pleas. Back at the Sanctum, they told him all about the Infinity Stones and Thanos and how he was going to destroy the world.
He asked Sam to come over to stay with Bucky (Sam poked his ribs and waggled his eyebrows a whole lot and told Steve that Bucky was a dog from hell, but agreed to come anyway since he secretly liked to cuddle with him, the menace) and whisked Tony off for a night in town, burgers and milkshakes as Tony gesticulated a lot between bites, excited by a new line of Starkphone, while Steve dopeyly smiled at him and fed him bits of fries between sentences. They went to a bar that played live jazz where Steve took advantage of the low lights and nosed at Tony’s hair while they slowly swayed to the music. By the time they got back to the Tower, both were sufficiently feeling frisky and Steve wasted no time to pin Tony against the bedroom door, eager to tear off his shirt to get to the warm skin underneath.
Months later, when he was finally home, Mr Stark finally realised what his life goal would be. He wanted to recreate the hope and joy that Captain had brought him, not just for himself but for all children, all the innocent ones who did not have live through the war. He wanted to create the most perfect toys, the most incredible puzzles, the most lovable teddies. And so, he opened his little toy store that eventually turned into a big toy factory, he married Mrs Stark, a beautiful girl with a gentle heart and careful hands and they slowly built their toy empire.
Steve to continue, and Tony just looked so good he had to give him another slap.
Obie sat and read as Ironteddy scrolled through the documents, making notes along the way in an attempt to explain to Obie what he meant to do. He then opened older documents containing older designs, of mechanical trains and automated machinery and sleek phones and an idea called ‘Bluetooth’. When Ironteddy finally tired himself out, he turned to look at Obie, not entirely sure what he was expecting. Mr Stark had seemed very proud at the beginning, he remembered, but he was not so proud afterwards and more upset than happy.
But then, five days into their paradise, they got a knock at the door. Phil was on the other side, looking apologetic while Bucky rushed in and threw himself at Tony desperately like Tony had been gone for ages. Steve tried very hard not to glare at Phil, who told him that he had some business in Switzerland and had surely left Bucky with Hill, but halfway through his flight SHIELD staff found Bucky hiding away in the engine room, and while they were relieved that he had not destroyed any of the cables or machines they made Phil promise to keep an eye on him. When they got to Geneva, Bucky whined and cried so much through the night no one in the entire hotel could sleep and he resumed attacking strangers, so Phil had to take him elsewhere, and seeing that his meeting was supposed to be in a few hours could Steve please take Bucky so that he could catch the fly out as soon as possible, thanks very much.
“Hey Cap, I did not educate you on the lore of Star Wars for you to go shoot my dream down like that. By the way guys, am I the only one who’s creeped out by how bizarrely correct the Pixar movie made them? I mean, they look exactly like the movie characters! This just further proves the Disney conspiracy that I’ve been saying all these years! I bet Disney has its own space team who goes to various alternative universes to steal ideas for their next franchise!”
“But why does he need to guard Tony from me?”
Rhodeybear promised when they hugged goodbye.
“I still cannot believe that you were the first one to recognize WALL-E!”, grumbled Tony, who were in the middle of reading the scans on the bots. The Fantastic Four, now that the portal had disappeared and the mystery of the aliens had been solved, already went back to their headquarters (Bruce bet that Richards was still sore on the fact that Steve knew something he didn’t). “I must have watched it with Dummy a hundred times already! Why does he have such an obsession on that movie anyhow?”
When they got married a year later, Clint took great joy in telling everyone the Bucky story and embarrassing the hell out of Steve (“Really, when you think about it, Steve was just jealous that his kid loves the step-dad more than him.”). But, while he hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck amidst everyone’s laughter and Clint’s recollection of the shenanigans that Bucky got into in order to ruin Steve’s dates (the majority of which were not even made up), even when he grumbled as Tony’s laughter vibrated through his jaws, he could feel Tony’s warm hand drawing soothing circles on his thigh, and next to the other, Bucky lazily gnawed at his fingers, his flank pressing at Steve’s leg like a furnace, Steve could not help but smiled.
And Bucky, who apparently remembered Tony, curled up like a docile Golden Retriever at Tony’s feet and pushed his head comfortably into his petting hand all the while Tony told Steve the story. That evening, when Steve came back to the living room after dinner to see Tony lounging on the sofa with Bucky half-draped on his belly, snuffling quietly with tail thumping slowly to Tony’s long stroke along his flank, he could not think of a more perfect picture. That, right there, was exactly what Steve had always wanted, a family in the making, someone he could share the rest of his life with, together with Bucky, a mesh of past and future.
The effect was immediate. The white hovering capsule cracked open, revealing an equally shiny white robot with bright blue eyes. The rusty bot beeped rapidly as if in joy, then two appendages with metal claw at the end protruded from its body, together with a pair of round eyes that were for real all cute and meek. The robots peered at Steve shyly (well, rusty was. Hourglass just looked vaguely judgmental), and then Steve raised out a hand towards them, as if trying to tame a wild animal, or wild robots from alternative universe.
“Pegs, he slammed at the window trying to get inside.”
Things happened in a flash. Peggy Carter died and Captain flew away for her funeral, sitting solemnly in the lap of Peggy’s niece, her dainty white hands holding onto him as he stared motionless at the wooden coffin. Then, a bomb blew up in Vienna and more people died. In the chaos that followed, it looked like Sergeant, Captain’s old pal, was the one to set the bomb up. News followed that the King of Wakanda, the only teddy cat-ruled nation in the world, was destroyed in the disaster, and that T’challa, his son, had taken up the Panther title and was on the hunt for Sergeant. Sergeant and Captain were on the run, they were caught; Sergeant’s assassin alter-ego was activated, the two of them escaped. Then Ironteddy found a tiny teddy named Spideybear who could shoot web like a spider and Hawkteddy found someone called Antteddy who could shrink to the size of an ant, and it all culminated at a German airport. Ironteddy asked Captain to stand down, once again. But it was all for nought, and a battle broke out. In the confusion that followed, they got away and Rhodeybear fell down and down.
And the thing he felt was an abyss of loneliness.
Ironteddy did not know how to feel about Mrs Stark.
Tony had somehow migrated back to beside Steve who had a hold on his hand and were rubbing his thumb along Tony’s hand in reassurance (Bruce usually did not make a habit of paying attention to his teammates’ PDA, but for some reasons he found it more calming to look at them than the bot-situation, which had a much higher chance of resorting in oil-shed and tattered cables). Tony’s face was a conflict of worry (for his bots, because as much as he liked to pretend otherwise Tony’s affection for his creations was genuine) and intrigue (because deep down he was still a scientist and was prone to curiosity, and this was the definition of an unpredictable scientific scenario). The whole team, too, were tensed and had subconsciously spread out to circle the bots.
“Traumatise him?? What about me? And stop laughing, it’s not funny!”
With the departure of Rhodeybear, there was only Ironteddy left.
In front of them, with a gun firm in his paws, was Sergeant.
It was very swell and all, but that also meant that Bucky tolerated no one else in his house and it became a huge problem when Steve resumed dating. The few people that Steve managed to go steady with since his return, Bucky hated them all. Sharon, a lovely lady working for MI6, whom Bucky barked at every single time she visited. Janet, whom Bucky tried to bite when she attempted to pet him. He chased Karen away in tears and left a set of bite mark on Andrew’s shin, which thankfully did not require stitching but had Steve worried over for weeks and pretty much killed any chance of him taking things to the next level. He had the best luck with Natasha, another special ops vet whom both had actually met back in Iraq. Bucky did not try to bite her shin when she came to the house, but still, he growled and scratched at the closed bedroom door through the nights she stayed over (which was no problem for Natasha, but they broke up anyway when she finally admitted to him that she had eyes for someone else, and two months after their break-up she started dating Clint and Laura).
Fortunately, Tony had a business meeting in France that he could not get out of. Coincidentally, Phil was looking for someone to come play good cop/bad cop with a group of newly-caught terrorists that were imprisoned in Paris at the time, and by pulling some strings (i.e looking all patriotic and determined in front of Phil while giving a prepared speech of why he would be excellent at the job), Steve was on a plane to Paris the next day. Bucky, who saw Steve packing his stuff the day before, looked at him suspiciously, but he was used to Steve being away on missions and did not kick up a fuss when Phil came to pick him up. Steve spent the flight over the Atlantic thinking of sketching Tony against a French backdrop and not at all reading the briefing paper he was given. He arrived in Paris at night and surprised Tony at his hotel room with a bouquet of flowers. It was cheesy as hell, but Tony was so suitably impressed that he dropped down onto his knees the moment the door was closed.
Bucky just looked monstrously smug when he once more resumed his post on Tony’s left side on the bed, grinning toothily at Steve over Tony’s shoulder, and Steve felt like crushing the phone in his hand, or whacking Bucky’s snout with rolled-up newspaper.
In a way, Steve not only felt jealous of Bucky, but of Tony as well. Before Tony, Steve was Bucky’s whole world. A comrade, a brother-in-arms from the past who supported him and followed him unconditionally, who stuck by him through the battlefield into danger zones, who adopted Steve as much as he adopted him, who tracked him down and found him among the rubble in the first place. A best friend who came home with him, who helped him getting used to America once again, who rediscovered the streets of New York with him and nuzzled into his arms on rough nights. Bucky had saved him in more ways than he could count and for years it was always Steve and Bucky, Bucky and Steve, ‘til the end of the line. People waltzed in and out of their lives, some for just a little while, some stayed for much longer, yet in the end they would always feel most comfortable around one another.
“Wait, so Tony and you were, uh, together together?”
Steve, who was saved by a column nearby that blocked the ceiling coming down above him, crawled out of the ruins among a billow of dust and smoke. It took them hours to locate everyone and pulled them out. There were no fatalities, but a lot were badly injured. Colonel Rhodes got a poker machine to his head and was unconscious, Natasha had a long gash on her arm and a bigger bruise on her temple. Bucky, whose prosthetic leg was dented, limped towards Steve, blood dripping from his flank and Tony’s chip wedged between his teeth.
They were an all right bunch, in general. Of that, Bruce did not complain, even though Richards could be kind of a dick and Johnny Storm was just annoying at times. But Sue Storm was nice and Grimm was a decent sort. And while they did conduct extremely unsafe experiments the likes of which not even Tony was willing to (soberly) consider on a daily basis, generally they were around to help clean up the mess (which should have been their responsibility in the first place, but anyway. Guess Cap’s goodliness was getting to him).
“You two were doing things, yes? Maybe he thought Tony was in danger? Did Tony look or sound pained? Oh wait, you know what, don’t answer that, I don’t need to know what you two are up to– No Angie, we don’t need to know, I know you think that Tony’s fit, that’s between us, Angie– Anyway, sorry about your night Steve. Hope you had a good time before that at least.”)
Obie lived in a mansion himself, although smaller than Mr and Mrs Stark’s, it was still massive. There was a Mr Newman who was like Mr Jarvis, just younger and harsher. There was no Mrs Obie, but unlike the Starks, Obie had a boy living with him who called him Uncle Obadiah. Ironteddy later learned that the boy’s parents had passed away and now he lived with Obie, his mother’s brother. The boy was called Edward and he was twelve. On the first day Ironteddy was brought there, Obie handed him and the bots to Edward and said,
As Tony droned on about Disney’s universe-jumping, much to the eye-rolling from Natasha and Bruce (and the fond look from Steve), WALL-E and EVE had managed to escape the team’s attention and had started to wander around Tony’s workshop where they had relocated them (simply because Tony knew more about what he was doing with robots than Bruce). Bruce tried to keep an eye on them, less because he deemed them dangerous (not really, if the Pixar movie was to be believed, but of course Bruce wondered how accurate it actually was as well) and more because Tony’s workshop was a constant hazard zone with too many things that could suddenly go boom or catch fire. So far the Pixar bots were doing all right, just curiously poking (WALL-E) and scanning (EVE) various objects on Tony’s benches. Once WALL-E seemed close to putting a torch into his torso compartment, but a glare from Bruce stopped him in his track.
Taking a deep breath, she made her way towards Wanda new room. It was close to Natasha’s and Clint’s, as they seemed to be the ones to really take Wanda under their wing. Her flats barely made a noise on the floor as she moved towards the West Wing, pile of paperwork close to her chest.
The smelling was taking up the kitchen and Toni smiled.
She heard the breath he let out and Clint’s fake vomiting.
“I volunteered for the group that bombed and killed my parents.”
Wanda looked down at the papers, moving backwards into her room but keeping the door opened. Toni hesitated for a moment before following, shutting the door behind her. She choose to stand while Wanda sat at her desk, flipping through the papers.
“Stane made sure he knew where all the weapons he sold went. He wanted to track who were top buyers. The Ten Rings sold to HYDRA who then, though their members in the Sokovia Government. . .”
“When? I don’t remember you getting to me in-“
She was as happy for him as he was for.
Well, shit. She lived with other people.
“Would I go live with him? Would I still be an Avenger?”
“That’s a crime and we need to fix it. Friday, place an order for the team’s usual and what Wanda wants. Come one, Wanda. We’re going to pick out a movie and have a fun little movie night.” Wanda said her order to Friday and followed Toni out into the hallway.
“Friday, why didn’t you worn me?” She hissed, panic rising in her chest.
With the sound of footsteps, Toni tensed and tried to think of reasons why she was doing this. Did she have good reasons? It was oblivious what she was doing. And even if she tried to hide it, the Wonder Twins were superspies for a reason.
“Natasha. . . she’s been talking to be about it.” There was a quiver to her voice. “There is a difference between those who make the gun and those who fire it. I am getting that now.” Wanda pulled back slightly, but still kept her hands lingering on Toni’s waist. “Those who fired it, they are-“
“Didn’t I already sign the Avengers Contract?” Toni let out a slightly laugh.
“Why would you give this to me?”
This was home.
“Weren’t you cleaning?” He shrugged.
“Yes. I believe everything will be okay.”
“You never asked, Boss.” Was that amusement in her voice? Rude. So fucking rude. Well, her A.I would be no help.
“So did you guys.” She pointed out, drawing back a bit to lay her hands on his shoulders. He kissed her on her nose and fuck; that was so cute. She could feel her face heat up and ducked her head down.
“It’s really not a big deal. Lots of people cook, you fucks-“
Smells like this were common in Stark Manor and reminded her of happier times. Listening to Mama play the piano, following Ana around as she cleaned the Manor and helping Jarvis chase whatever animal her father fancied that month.
But this paperwork was important and it had taken nearly two and a half months to get it all. To make sure it was right.
“I know.” Wanda mumbled, hands moving up to wrap around Toni’s shoulder. “I can feel it so strongly off of you. I’m almost drowning in it. You. . . thank you. For sharing this with me.” Toni wrapped her arms around Wanda’s waist and buried her nose in the younger woman’s neck.
“Is this dinner tonight?” Wanda leaned in close to the pot and inhaled. “It smells wonderful! Did you cook it, Toni?” Wide eyes blinked at Toni and Toni fought down a blush. She tried to think of something but Natasha came up behind her and holy shit.
Expect Pepper. No one was that brave.
This was safety.
“You look like you had a long day.” He drew her into a hug and laid his cheek on the top of her head. Always having to her remind her just how short she was. She huffed and poked his side.
Steve grinned down at them, placing a hand on one of the shoulders each. “We gonna be okay?” He spoke softly and Toni melted into him, letting him wrap his arm around her shoulder. She looked at Wanda; the younger woman’s answer was something Toni needed to hear.
No more secrets.
Toni thought about it before signing.
Shaking her head of the thoughts, Toni stood up and grabbed the large stack. All the tracking of a few missiles that had made their way to Sokovia. Steve thought, and Toni agreed, that this might help Wanda. Toni had her doubts – as she vividly remembers trashing her lab after Steve told her about her parents – but it was better to tell her than to keep it from her.
Until one day they came across a Russian corps. The commander of each side tried to convey their thoughts with broken syllables and frantic hand gestures while the privates just stared at the others’ sooty face, a exhausted but faintly hopeful look mirrored in their eyes. One of them must have spotted Sergeant, for the next day, after the Russians were gone, Sergeant had disappeared together with them. Mr Stark raved and raged, but they could not afford to accuse their allies of such a petty crime and there was nothing they could do. Saddened yet powerless, Mr Stark moved on with just Captain. The night they entered Berlin, their camp was attacked by a group of fanatics who could not accept the fact that their fatherland had lost. It was a terrible and vicious fight and while they ended up triumphant, Mr Stark lost Captain in the scuffle. He went up and down the streets looking for it, asking everyone he knew, yet no one had seen the teddy. And so, with a broken heart, Mr Stark marched through the rubble of Berlin feeling like a part of him was lost forever.
The fourth time, Rhodeybear was caught.
“Have you a soul to bargain?”
Tony, who was captured and tortured for months in Afghanistan (and only now did Steve know the full story, since Tony was so sensitive about the scars on his chest he never really spoke at length about how those came to be), met Bucky when Erskine and him were also kidnapped by the Ten Rings. Why they decided to keep Bucky alive no one knew, but suffice to say the three of them grew pretty close in their captivity. When one of the guards shot Bucky’s leg for fun, Tony was the one who made him a metal leg after they had sawed the inflamed leg off. Bucky was the one who sneaked out and ran to the nearby US camp with a letter for help and led them back to the cave where Tony and Erskine were kept. During the scuffle, Erskine took a bullet that was meant for Tony and asked him to bring Bucky back to Iraq on his last breath. Tony, who had grown fond of Bucky, reluctantly arranged for Bucky’s flight back to Steve. Tony, who got used to calling Bucky ‘James’ after his best friend during their time in the cave, was in correspondence with General Phillips who kept him updated on Bucky up until his retirement with Steve.
The second time, Rhodeybear brought back an old newspaper. Ironteddy could read news on the internet, but he had never seen a newspaper in real life before and they spent the night gorging on the smell of ink and the feeling of crisp paper in their paws.
“First off, Hawkeye, I’m shocked that you even know the word ‘bipedal’. Who has been teaching you all these adult words?” Clint promptly threw a wrench at Tony’s head. “And second, for once you’re maybe onto something. Why shouldn’t we get a universe for all the Disney cartoons out there? There may be a world with singing tea cups and evil octopus-ladies. Star Wars may even be real too, for all we know.”
And Steve really, really, really wanted to continue to follow Tony’s happy trail, but the responsible part of his brain told him that SHIELD would never call unless it was something urgent, also it was always a bad idea to miss a call from Natasha and he very much would like to avoid being castrated by her the next time they met.
He loved Captain.
Before Tony’s imminent arrival, Steve tried his best to make sure that Bucky would be on his best behaviour (or be as good as he possibly could, Steve stopped being so hopeful years ago). He got Bucky’s favourite treats and spoiled him with a long walk and a good hour of Frisbee at the park. He gave him extra pets and cuddles, and he even sat Bucky down for a talk (“Tony’s very important to me and I really like him a lot, so please be nice to him tomorrow, you understand me Buck?”, to which Bucky’s jaws gaped widely for a yawn and he went back to burying his nose into Steve’s shirt as he snoozed). The next morning, he put Bucky in the garden, hoping that giving Tony a tour of the house and letting his scent settle in first would help with calming Bucky down.
Captain was standing by himself as well, a couple feet away from Ironteddy. He also did not look at anyone and he kept worrying a piece of black fabric in his paws. His helmet was gone and his hair was in disarray. His face, usually so put-together, was scrunched in pain as he wept for Sergeant. There was a time in the past when Ironteddy would come over and try to comfort Captain. Yet he did no such thing now as he impassively watched from afar.
Then, on one of the nights he spent wandering and exploring in Mr Stark’s workshop, he found his own blueprint in a portfolio. And it was truly his blueprint, from the bold letters IRONTEDDY on top, to the smallest details of his mask and repulsors, they were all there. Signed at the bottom of the blueprint was Mr Stark’s signature.
When he opened the door to a dingy cell and saw Tony chained to the wall, face a giant blooming bruise and torso painted with long slashes, the rage roared back to life. It was only by cradling Tony close in his arms and inhaling the faint scent of his hair that the furious monster in him died down to an ember. He could feel his face wet with tears, either from pain or relief, and could feel Tony wiping a bloodstained hand on his cheek, soothing him with quiet whispers, as if he was the one captured and tormented. He did not let go of Tony’s hand when the medics finally came and took him out on a stretcher. He stayed still like stone outside of the operation theatre when Tony was in surgery, was not aware of doctors and nurses rushing around him or his friends who came and sat with him.
“Artificial intelligence”
Surprisingly enough, the truth did not quite impact the relationship between humans and teddies, as the teddies had long feared. Apparently, the fact that they could only be alive thanks to human’s love made them even more desirable, for it put them under the mercy of human and their whims. Humans always did love to feel superior. There were a few cases where people threw away their teddies, horrified that they were sentient, but those teddies were soon rescued and donated to orphanages, where they received even more love. Overall, people thought of them as pets, which was how teddies had always seen themselves anyway. Super smart teddies like Ironteddy was one in a billion, so there was no big ethical debates as to what owning a teddy meant.
The thing was, he could not even discuss it with Tony. Despite all that happened, Tony still adored Bucky. Sure, after Steve’s attack he was more wary of him, but since Bucky was always such an angel around him, he charted it down to a singular incident in which Bucky was meant to feel threatened anyway. Plus, prior to their meeting Steve had scared him a lot about how terrible Bucky was with other people, so for Bucky to regard him as family was just too good to be true. They also had an intense history together, one that left permanent scars on both of them but also brought them together and even Steve could not question it.
The Human Torch started to giggle to himself at the Iron Man-Captain America implication, like the twelve-year old he was. Bruce just sighed, wondering to himself about the strange things that kept on happening in his life, and made a motion for Steve to continue.
It was probably the promise, or the look of anguish and determination in Steve’s eyes, or the fact that he was badly injured and could barely walk, but Bucky relented. His growl turned into a whine and he nuzzled Steve’s knee, letting him pet his head and ears. He pushed his snout into Steve’s hand and dropped the bloody chip into it, asking for a promise that Steve repeated like his life depended on it.
It was all very sweet and Bruce started to think that today might turned out all right after all.
Bucky only answered with a happy bark.
Sometimes, though, Ironteddy was taken out of the toy room and into a car to go outside, when Stark Toys needed to show him off. Usually it would be Obie who came to fetch him, and while Ironteddy adored Obie, he also felt bad for leaving DUMMY behind. DUMMY’s chirps were too quiet for human ears to hear, but to Ironteddy they were louder than the loudest of drums, the sound of loneliness he once heard every night. And so, he decided to make DUMMY a friend too. Again he sneaked into the workshop and again he drew and hammered, and finally Butterfingers was created.
While Steve just stood there, looking flabbergasted, Tony knelt down in front of them to Bucky’s eye level (among other levels, but Steve really should get his head out of the gutter now, because Bucky. Wagged. His tail.)
“Seriously, what is with you guys? Just last week you were forcing me to watch that movie, again. I’d like to think that your memory is much more impressive than this. Come on, stop embarrassing daddy here–“
“You know, with the old crinkly looks of WALL-E and the perfect curves and blue eyes EVE are sporting…”
It happened in a blur.
It broke Steve’s heart to know how insecure Tony was still in their relationship, despite the fact that he should be the insecure one, next to someone as brilliant as Tony. He wasted no time in settling things straight with Tony, but it still took Tony days before he believed that Steve was telling the truth.
Steve had the feeling that Bucky was judging him the entire time before the incident and the fact that he brought Tony back to them meant that he passed some sort of test in Bucky’s head. Now, Bucky no longer growl or snarl at him when he got too close to Tony and he no longer acted like Steve was going to hurt Tony when he turned his back. Steve was no longer the ‘bad guy’ in Bucky’s book.
That was Richards’ eloquent response.
“What the fuck Widow? The bots are not our kids. My kids. What did I just say?”
Bucky, who was the number two on his list. He met Bucky in Iraq on his second tour when they were tasked with defusing landmines in a nearby village. Bucky, a bomb detection dog, and his handler Peggy flew in from Britain for the mission. Steve had a massive crush on Peggy at the time and took to trailing after her whenever he could spare the time, much to his team’s (and surely Bucky’s) amusement. After the mission, Peggy turned him down gently, telling him that she was already engaged and flew back to England, leaving behind Steve’s broken heart and Bucky, whose command was transferred to Erskine, a quiet army doctor who was surprisingly experienced in handling army dogs. As Steve tried to get over Peggy, he grew closer and closer to Bucky, who saw him as a familiar face around the camp and offered him the closure that he needed.
Then he stormed away into his workshop, muttering about the perfect teddy bear, leaving Ironteddy lying on its side on the table with an arm still reaching out, as if begging Mr Stark to come back.
On one such snowy days, Mr Jarvis came into the workshop while Ironteddy was trying his best to tighten a screw with a screwdriver. He froze when he saw Mr Jarvis came in, but Mr Jarvis just said, “I know”, and picked Ironteddy up and hugged him tight. Mr Jarvis, while always full of love, had never hugged him, it was a strangely nice feeling. Then Mr Jarvis brought him back to the toy room to the cheers of the robots, “I’ve been dusting and charging them in your absence,” and placed him among the shelves with the bots. Ironteddy did not quite know what was going on and was pretty annoyed, but as he was trying to climb down the shelf, he heard voices from the corridor, which scared him out of leaving. He sat still on the shelf with his bots, listening attentively to the cacophony of footsteps and voices on the other side of the door. He heard them moving towards the workshop and the sounds stayed in there for a long time. Then they emerged and moved down the corridor again, this time towards the toy room. Mr Jarvis opened the door, followed by a dozen people in black suit and white shirt, among whom was Obie. They looked around the room in a daze, their eyes gazing at shelves and shelves of inventions and toys with a mix of bewilderment and sadness. Then, snapped out from the trance, they moved around the room, picking up things and talking to each other in a murmur. Obie himself came towards Ironteddy and picked him up. He levelled him to his face and said to Ironteddy:
“Let’s not be too hasty now Tony. We do live in the future after all. I don’t have plans on having kids, but maybe someday Bruce can come up with something?”
“Stop it, Dummy, Butterfingers, U!”
Afghanistan was hot, but all Ironteddy could feel was the cold feeling in his chest.
“You know I am, Natasha, what is the situation?”
Mrs Stark brought Ironteddy to bed that night. She was an adult so she did not need to sleep with teddies, but that night she needed the comfort. She did not care whether Ironteddy became a success or not, she did not care how much money it would bring, she only saw the little creation as her perfect child, there was nothing else to improve on it and she loved it just the way it was.
“Oh my god Thor, did you really just compare me to Odin and Dummy to Loki?!”
Then, just when things started to get interesting, JARVIS piped in:
“Mr Jarvis”
Like, Tony might as well hung the moon and stars in Bucky’s eyes.
“See, that’s exactly why Steve would get custody of them one day. Then you’ll be sorry for not listening to me.”
Ironteddy had known about the Accords for a while. Oddly enough, the first legal restriction against teddy bears was one asking them for accountability. If the situation was any less serious than this, Ironteddy would probably find it very funny. Yet, people were killed, buildings were destroyed, countries were ruined and someone had to do something about it. Ironteddy remembered Obie’s words on the podium ages ago on the launch of Ironteddies, praising his toughness and also softness. Ironteddy remembered Mr Stark, how he used to tell him that he would never be enough.
Strangeteddy seemed to say as he leaned his head against Ironteddy’s, whose paw gripped at Strangeteddy’s shirt as the other was cradled in Strangeteddy’s paw.
JARVIS was gone.
“What are they doing?”
Tonight would be the night, Steve thought for sure.
Teddies needed love.
In her excitement, she brought Ironteddy to show Mr Stark and his business partner, Mr Stane. Mr Stane loved Ironteddy, he marveled on how handsome the teddy looked, how tough his posture seemed, yet at the same time still so adorable kids would definitely love it.
None of the team did, in fact.
She had been a child and too short so a step stool had been used to help her reach. Even when she reached eleven or twelve, they had to use it. And by fourteen, she was done growing and stayed at her height of 5’2”.
“We’ll clean up the kitchen while you go relax.” At least she didn’t have to worry about leftovers – Natasha and Rhodey grabbed the last of the Carbonara before Sam or Clint could. Both men pouted before fighting over washes their bowl first.
There was slightly amusement in Wanda’s tone, which helped the tension in Toni’s chest. Swallowing, she patted the papers in her hand.
Coming to Wanda’s room, Toni paused. What if this only made Wanda angrier? What if this didn’t help her at all? And only hurt her more? The younger woman had gone through so much in her life – even Toni herself could feel for her.
( She tried to ignore the slight guilty looks on their faces that told her they heard most of the talk. That only meant they would each come to her later and she’d have more ‘talks’ and ugh. )
“Why is everyone so gross and cute? Stop reminding the rest of us single pringles how happy you all are.” Clint gagged but got a kick from Natasha. He gave her a look of betrayal but she ignored him. Vision floated up from the floor, sitting himself by Wanda. Rhodey smiled as she leaned into him and he laid his head atop hers. “Ugh.” Clint’s head meet the floor just as Toni walked in. She took one look at Clint.
“Gross.”
Toni pulled back and scowled at Clint’s grinning face. He leaned against the wall and wiggled is brows at her while she stuck her tongue out at him.
“Please cook more.” Wanda said, hoping up on the counter like a heathen. Children, all of them. Even Natasha who smirked at her. “What is this dish called?”
At least she reached now.
Where Toni nearly ran into a solid chest of super solider. He didn’t even look sorry for basically eavesdropping.
Natasha and Client stood of to the side, Nat with her usual poker and Clint with a grin but worried expression. Sam looked thoughtful but proud. Rhodey nodded at her, a warm smile on his face. Vision himself looked thoughtful, but Steve.
But it still shot up her blood pressure and with someone messing up the coding, it sent it over the edge a bit. She needed to destress. And since her fellow Avengers were all in training and she couldn’t demand Steve cuddles, she had to go to her go-to before he came into her life.
There was a fuck up and now the new StarkPhone would be a month behind its release date. Her stress level had been high already due to the mad scientist that wanted to try and create zombies. It had taken them days to track them all down. Luckily, they were just the walking dead and not actually, you know, Hollywood zombies.
“Toni Stark cooks.” Clint announced, as if it needed to be. Toni turned her scowl to him and he lifted his hands up, palms out. “Hey, can’t blame a guy for being shocked. Never thought you went into a kitchen expect for coffee.” He grabbed the bowl Natasha handed him and took the first bite.
“I wanted to avenge everyone who was killed or injured by SI weapons that were sold by Stane.” Toni bent down, on her knees while looking up at Wanda. She was still in her chair, her make-up a little running from her crying. “I just want you to know, Wanda – I only sold to the US. And while the US would sell those ones, they sold them mostly to Japan and South Korea and they were ones for self-defense.”
“You gonna stay awake for the movie?” Rhodey teased, running a hand over Sam’s short hair. Sam snorted but leaned his head into the touch with a sigh.
While grinning at her.
Dark eyes widen and in the blink of an eye, the papers were taken from Toni’s hands. She flexed her hands, wondering how.
“That’s not what these are. They are. . .” Toni wiggled her nose, brows drawn together. There was no could way to put this. At all. And Wanda looked slightly alarmed. Fuck. “The paper trail about the missile that hit your home.”
Toni’s heart squeezed and she suddenly found herself with an armful of a crying Wanda. Dark hair floated up with red mist around and while it made Toni nervous, she felt nothing. Instead, she wrapped her arms around the young woman and rubbed her back.
“You already ‘pay in love’ for your arrows. Try again.” She waved her a bit. “Besides, I’m a busy woman you know. I won’t have the time usually.” Sam made a noise of distress which Clint echoed. No, not children – babies. She worked with babies.
She had make a quick stop at the store on the way back to the Compound to grab everything. Usually, though, just the act of shopping would calm her nervous enough for her to back to her workshop. But this time it seems not to be the case. Because after pulling into the Compound and unloading everything, her stress was still alive and poking at her. With a frustrated growl, she laid everything out and got to work.
“Lucky’s special.”
Wanda smiled brightly, teeth showing and all.
When they lived together in an apartment, they’d share a bed more than once. He’d fall asleep with her curled up to his chest and wake up with her foot in his face. He did miss those carefree days they had at MIT but he wouldn’t trade their lives now for anything in the world.
“I hope it brings you some peace knowing those responsible are dead.”
“I think so. I am. . . not as angry, anymore. I feel peaceful? Thank you telling me the truth.”
Charles would be the perfect fit to help her.
“I’m sorry, Wanda. The bomb was SI, but I should have kept a closer eye on Stane and my company in general.” White paper slipped through Wanda’s fingers as she gave a sniff. Her dark head turned, tears in her eyes.
“I, uh, have some things for you.”
The old memories helped as well. Thinking of the old family butler who was more of a father to her than Howard always did. He was stern but still let her know she was loved by him and Ana. He was quiet in his affections to her but she never doubted how much he loved her. How he put her bed most nights, how he encouraged her engineering and loved every gift she made for him.
“Nat! Don’t fucking do that! You nearly gave me a heart attack!”
Toni’s back popped and she let out a groan. Hunched over paperwork was the bane of her life; she’ll be honest and admit it was part of a reason she passed the CEO touch over to Pepper. There was only so much Toni herself could take of paperwork and the board without wanting to bang her head against a wall.
Rhodey sat in the corner of one of the couches in the living. Clint was laying on his stomach on the floor with Lucky’s head on the small of his back. Wanda leaned back against the beanbag chair – large enough for two - Toni had gotten for her and Natasha and draped over the chair.
“I think that would be nice. I would like to not accidently do something.” Toni gave her a grin, standing up.
“Hey, what smells amazing?” Clint’s voice was clear as day when he walked and stopped, just staring at her. He blinked a few times before his brows furrowed. “Are you-“
“These are real?”
“It does. And I am sorry too, for messing with your mind.” Blinking, Toni pulled back with her brows furrowed.
Natasha just smirked and looked at the pot.
She missed him something fierce and thanks everything she has that she spent those last few moments of his life with him. Showing him how much she loved him and how much he meant to her.
“Carbonara.” Rhodey’s amused voice echoed in the kitchen and Toni spun around. He walked over and placed a kiss on her cheek before grabbing his own bowl. “Baby girl, you haven’t cooked this since our twenties. I’ve missed it.”
Doing this was one of the ways she felt close to him, even after he passed.
Toni wasn’t sure how this talk would go, but she hoped for the best. She and Wanda needed to have this. Steve and Clint both wanted her on the team and Steve had – quite rudely – refused Toni’s retirement papers.
“Dead,” Toni mumbled. “They were killed when Natasha let lose HYDRA’s data dump.” Which she thanked every God she didn’t even believe in that they called her. JARVIS and she had just barely enough time to keep the real SHIELD agents from getting burned and caught in the crossfire.
“And so is Stane and The Ten Rings.”
The illusion would be broken when Howard came home but Toni tried to shift those memories away. While she had a few good memories with him, the bad outweighed the good. Even the good ones ended poorly if she thought about them to the end.
“In the base. When you grabbed. . .” Wanda’s eyes widened a little bit. “I gave you that vision. I pushed into your mind to take the stone. I-“ Wanda cut herself off, curing in on herself. “I regret doing that, I honestly do, Toni.”
Steve and Clint walked in close just as Sam busted in and turned his gaze to the food.
In fact, he had burned them.
“To help give you some closure. Steve thought that, well. . .” She was usually smoother than this, fuck. Toni was great at talking to people – didn’t like it much, but she was good at it. But this was different. So very different from business parties. “It’s always better to know the full story about anything. To help get some inner peace.” There was a bit of Bruce in her speech, but she’d blame that on missing him.
“If you want, I know someone.” Wanda looked up, slight confusion on her face. “He teaches a school of young gifted people. He’s a good friend and I think he could help you with that.” Wanda smiled brightly.
There were a few sniffs before Wanda peeked back up.
Steve began to stand up.
“Read a book in a corner then! I’m tired of watching this stuff. It’s boring. My eyes are bleeding right now. Steve let’s take a break,” Clint sighed. “Come on even Bucky is tired of watching this stuff.”
“Ah, but you did. Guess you weren’t strong enough to handle it. But my I loved watching you try to pull away, when you were nearly drugged out. But know this, I never slept with you while you weren’t aware. No, I loved knowing you were completely comprehending what was happening to you. Every drag, every pull, every scrape, every whimper, every moan of pleasure…ahh yes there were some good moments, right?”
“Stop,” Tony rasped, tight fists clutching at the material on Steve’s chest. “Sto…Steve. Steve.”
Steve mumbled softly, nosing into Tony’s neck. Tony looked down at Steve who had his head against his chest and arm thrown tightly over Tony’s waist even in sleep. Tony smiled at that level of unconscious protectiveness.
“He’s fine, but he’s a little shaken up. It would probably do him some good to see you right now though,” Natasha said. “I did promise him that I would send him to you and your kid takes promises seriously.”
“What-” Tony barely managed to get out, before a figure came walking toward them.
Tony swallowed a lump in his throat and turned his face down hoping he could force the tears back.
Certainly not Cali. But she desired mercy…or at least a chance to right her wrongs. She may not have dealt him a physical blow like the others, but she had done far worse.
The young girl frowned and seemed to think about it. “You have Miriam here right?”
“It would have been well within reason to do so,” Isak claimed.
“It’ll be earned back by my mastery of spaghetti skills!” Steve said doing a mock bow.
And crap had he…had he only served to strengthen what Howard told Captain America would do to Tony?
“I thought you had left,” Tony admitted then berated himself for not having a filter.
P.S. I will also be reading and responding to comments soon (blame my producer for that lol)
“I would be happy, if I was a hundred percent certain it was Ryder’s body that died. And even if he had truly died in that car crash I must be honest, I’m a little disappointed I wasn’t the one that put an end to him.”
Conversations went on around him as he looked around and chewed on his bottom lip. He was certain that Wanda had been talking to him, but at a certain point realized that he had grown disinterested and returned to speaking to Vision. He had made a quick apology and Wanda waved it away smiling.
“He doesn’t have to. He’s not happy. At first I thought it was because of me, then I started thinking that maybe it’s because of you,” Steve suggested. “I love Tony and I don’t think you do. I know Tony doesn’t deserve to focus his attention on someone who can’t decide if he loves him or not, after nearly a year of being together.”
She sniffled and looked to where Diana and Miles were playing. “Don’t stay silent. Don’t let whoever is making you cry continue because they don’t change. They only manipulate you to think that they are until one day they snap completely and your son becomes an orphan.”
“You don’t wet the bed. I’m sorry,” Marley said, her voice stuffy from her nose being pinched.
“No, thank you Rogers,” Ryder bit out. “I would still like to take my boyfriend out to dinner. Tony?”
“I know,” he grinned as he watched her hand out the wristbands to the kids. Some of the volunteers began to help the little girls put them on. Once everyone had a wristband, Natasha threw one to Bucky and Clint.
The word desperately clung to his lips, not ready to let go of its grasp quite yet. Steve told himself it was to not have Tony talk about something he may not be ready to discuss.
Julie looked concerned over potentially disappointing Natasha, so he looked down at her softly.
“That’s…that’s good ‘fraid you were…”
Peter sounded like he was winded from the whole statement and Steve couldn’t help but to laugh softly at Peter’s look of content.
Tony sighed again, mouth tensing in a line as Steve looked down at him. His lips tilted forward in a smile and Tony mirrored it. Before he knew it, Steve had picked him up and swung him around laughter ripping out of his chest.
Winston grabbed his body. Tony pushed it away from him. “I can bathe myself.”
She laughed at herself, while kicking back a doll that had found its way outside the front door. “Now I’m sorry. I don’t think I caught your name.”
“Yes, which you wouldn’t know, since you still pee in the bed.”
Steve wiped his mouth again. He stood on shaky legs, helped up by Clint’s outstretched hand. Steve took it gratefully and nearly had to lean on Clint for support. Clint did the same. The two left the restroom, ignoring the curious glances they got from the guy washing his hands.
Coming into Harley’s bedroom, he smiled wonderingly at the three kids he had grown to love over the course of the past years. They had all come during different stages of his life, but he had all grown to call them his. Even with Harley’s adoption being finalized and Peter still affectionately calling him Uncle Tony never failed to further establish that Tony did have a family.
He couldn’t.
“I just…I’m so tired,” Tony admitted. “I’m tired of having hope. I’m tired of thinking for once that I’ll have something good in my life and having it taken away. I have you both and Miles. I think I have the Avengers. I just…I keep waiting for the day it’s all taking away.”
, Tony wanted to tell him.
“I’m Spiderman. There’s nothing lame or boring about being Spiderman.”
“Of course you can.”
“I have no loyalty that is not bound out of debt,” Cali responded, licking her chapped lips. “Tony does not deserve what is happening to him and I only wish to soothe my guilt in being part of his pain. I can find the driver, I only need that the one who reads mind is accessible.”
Tony felt tears spring into his eyes and an abundance of joy fill his heart. At the back of his mind there was a fleeting thought of Ryder, but the joy pushed it aside. A sob broke through his chest and he hunched over himself. Karen quickly went to him and gave him a hug.
Helen looked at them and noticed their desperation. She sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose, hating how Tony had been taken apart like this. She looked back to her clipboard then back to him.
“Hey, don’t judge. I binge watch the season during the holidays. It’s amusing to me,” Tony said. “Plus your historical documentaries and all that isn’t great. Steve there are more things to watch than the Discovery and History channel, you know this.”
With one look at Steve, Bruce shook his head. “I need to go, before I do something I…actually may not regret.”
Steve recoiled at the thought of him simply reducing Tony to a thing of pleasure.
Tony, so caught up in his thoughts, simply acknowledged her intent with a head nod. Clint did the same and soon the three of them were all huddled up on the floor of Tony’s lab, backs against his desk. DUM-E whirled by them and Tony leaned his body forward, bring Natasha and Clint with him. DUM-E spun in a circle, beeping excitedly at Tony.
The questioned startled him, just as much as it startled Tony whose eyes quickly blinked open. Steve shook his head at how Tony tensed and his expression grew tight. He wanted to sooth those lines in his face and get rid of the tension settling between his eyebrows.
“Because I’m…you know why Pepper. He’s all American goodness and sweet apple pie and I’m Tony stark,” Tony mumbled against Rhodey’s chest. “I’ve lived my whole life knowing that I would never be good enough for someone like him. I wasn’t good enough for you.”
“How are you feeling about that kid,” Tony questioned brushing back a strand of hair that had fallen on Harley’s face.
“Would it help it, if you knew? If you knew the answer to whatever question you wanted me to answer,” Tony whispered, his own eyes having a thin sheen of water over them.
Steve closed his eyes. “Both.”
Bucky open his mouthed to say Tony shouldn’t have said any of those things to him. He was to blame. He didn’t deserve anyone’s forgiveness certainly not Tony’s. But he couldn’t…he couldn’t say these things because he desperately wanted them to be true. Steve had often told him it wasn’t his fault, but that was Steve. Steve who refused to see Bucky as anything, but the Bucky who fought beside him and grew up with him.
“Tony is being particularly courteous right now and he is not asking a lot out of you. He has had a long week and I believe you all have had a few long months. A good night’s sleep may do everyone good. So do as Tony suggested and you all can reconvene tomorrow evening,” Ryder said with such authority that Tony was brought back to those days in college, when Ryder would argue with his professors about a possible grade change.
Steve shook his head. “No, I’m not going on any mission. I’m leaving.”
“Sometimes one has to play with fire, so the others know not to touch it,” Fury explained.
I need someone to come watch Tony for a second. Don’t want him being alone right now, but the more he tells me about Ryder the more jumpy I’m getting. I don’t need him to see me like this right now. I may punch a fucking wall.
Steve looked behind him. “To a store. I need to have something made.”
Tony patted Peter on his back. “I’m glad to hear that. Well Steve and I are off to ride more rides and win more prizes from children.”
“That’s sweet,” Tony said talking to all of them, but only looking at Steve. “Is Miles alright?’
Tony cried onto the floor, body wracking with shivers. He couldn’t stop dry heaving. His arms curled around himself.
Tony froze as his fingers hovered over the frame of the bed for balance. Winston. Cali. He needed to get out of here before Ryder chose to relive their time. His legs shook and his head still felt full of cotton, but he pushed himself to the door just hoping that no one was there. His mouth trembled as he struggled over hurried breaths.
“Tony,” Steve softly said. “You don’t have to joke about this not with anyone, especially never with me.”
Ryder crawled onto of Tony’s body and settled his onto Tony’s chest just shy of his arc reactor, while placing his cock on Tony’s bottom lip.
Tony had gotten used to rough sex. He had just thought Ryder liked it like that and Tony would eventually get used to it.
“Get off!” Tony rasped struggling to breath. “My chest…’m can’t breathe.”
“Who are you…”
Natasha pressed the knife coolly into Steve’s unoccupied hand, who then pressed it against the corner of Isak’s mouth. Isak smirked, causing the knife to dig softly into the skin there and leave a trail of blood.
, Tony thought to himself
Once they arrived back at the tower, they immediately went to grab something to eat. While they were cautious that they needed to clean up, their stomachs were so hungry that they quickly washed their hands and grabbed whatever was available on the counter.
The heat that had burned in Steve simmered down to a chill. He didn’t want to turn around and have his fears confirmed. He looked to body behind Fury’s and his expression shut off, before he dropped Isak’s body and in two long strides came to the door.
Why…why did it feel like he wanted to leave, but he wanted him to stay?
“Hey, no talking to the competitor Jaime,” Harley announced, grabbing ahold of the kid in Jaime’s arms. “Or I’ll have to disqualify you for going against the rules.”
“Yeah, okay Peter keep telling me the little lies that you tell yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Then Steve had the plans of just watching over Tony, at least until he fell asleep if he wasn’t already doing so.
“Of course,” Peter encouraged excitedly. “And like this is going to be amazing. I’ve been waiting for today for like forever. I know it’s like an important day for you and Uncle Tony, but I’ve been waiting for like literal years so yeah I’m rambling now but-”
“Yeah, we were seeing how long it would be for you to spring Tony out of the hospital. We all gave you the maximum four weeks, until we stepped in and sprung him ourselves,” Bucky hinted teasingly. “But how’s he doing?”
The teasing tilt to his voice had Karen laughing and clutching his hands even tighter.
Peter steeled Ryder with a heavy gaze, not bringing notice to Harley walking behind him. “Is there a problem?” Harley implored looking at the tension resting heavy on Peter’s shoulders.
“We can talk in the morning and every day after that, if that’s what you want,” Steve said his heart thrumming in his ear. “Just close your eyes and go to sleep.”
Steve turned away not willing to let Natasha know how visibly affected by her words.
His heart thundered in his chest. His fingers trembled with the need to reach onto anything. But Bucky was right, now wasn’t the time. Not when Tony needed him.
“He really wanted them. I mean at least he doesn’t know we actually have them. That way they can be a little reward if he eats his vegetables,” Steve replied. “Hope that wasn’t wrong. I mean of course I can eat them. He won’t know that they were ever there.”
Bucky’s and Clint’s insistence that he give Tony his original gift brought Steve to grab Tony and ask that he meet him. So there he was.
“Good. Hold on just a minute,” Ryder stated, holding up his index finger. He motioned to a woman in blue scrubs. She came closer to him and gave him a friendly kiss on the cheek. “Did they get Carl up to CT yet?”
He hadn’t wanted to let Ryder knowing that he did get to him.
So Tony queued up some music and turned on his StarkPad. It was a few hours of silence and alone time that Tony certainly needed. Don’t get him wrong he loved talking to Rhodey and entertaining Miles, but he still needed a few hours to himself. He had practically been raised on being alone till he went off to college so sometimes that urge to be alone came up.
Karen rolled her eyes. “You don’t even know the half of it. After snack time, is when she starts using her best materials.”
“With all due respect sir this started with Tony’s refusal to listen to my concerns about the Accords,” Steve said leaning forward.
Bucky really prayed he didn’t drop this kid. Miles squirming to get away from him certainly hadn’t helped, but he was beginning to settle. He kept his eyes on Tony as though making sure he wouldn’t leave.
“Peter,” Tony started. “Is there something I need to know?”
“I loved him dearly. So it…”
Tony looked at the two and let warmth spread throughout him, once again taking the cold that had begun to settle in his bones.
“What just happened?”
Clint’s eyes widened and his mouth gaped open. “Wow.”
“So you’re okay?” Natasha questioned.
Natasha slammed the pantry door close as she went to the refrigerator to grab some tomatoes.
“You started this,” Thor said to Bruce. “Plus Sam already messed mine up. Let’s start from the beginning. Alright Tony come help us.”
Tony fist pumped in the air and excitedly got up. “Awesome, we can make fun of the old hags together as they tell again their reasons why I shouldn’t just fire them.”
“Oh, you were,” Steve replied with a large amount of enthusiasm. “I mean I’m sorry that the relationship didn’t end up how you wanted…”
“I didn’t say that,” Peter backtracked. “I said I was going to the movies with my decathlon group.”
Steve tilted Tony’s head so that he could face him. “Was Howard the main reason you two were you know distancing yourself, at least from Ryder’s part?”
The voice laughed then quieted. “Well dear let the time of the Starks’ control over our lives end fairly soon.”
Tony shook his head. “No, this is a dream. It’s always a dream. When I wake up, you’ll be gone and he’ll be there. He’s always there. It’s okay…Nat why are you sad? You’re never sad in my dreams.”
By then her eyes had grown a wet sheen to them. “We didn’t notice anything wrong. I mean I was his twin sister, surely he’d tell me. But he didn’t. He told me about how wonderful things were. And I believed him. I didn’t know that he being serious was him actually being depressed. I didn’t realize that him becoming reserved was evidence of her isolating him from all those that loved him.”
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
“Don’t worry about that. You stay wherever you are right now. I’ll meet you in an hour,” Cali commented, not allowing Steve to respond before she hung up. Cali went to where Tony had fallen asleep and pulled the covers up to his neck.
His hands began to tremble and he felt acid burn in his throat. Everything around him grew hazy. His mind started to go back to Siberia and…
Sharon raised an eyebrow. “No, I wasn’t. You’d have better be lucky it wasn’t anything of importance or I would have been highly offended,” she teased lightly. “What has you looking like a lost puppy?”
“No!” Tony shouted loudly, surprising himself with the strength behind that. “No,” he said trying to hide how his voice quivered. “But I could because he’s my boyfriend. Some things happen more slowly.”
Tony scowled. “I did nothing wrong. I’m just trying to get away from you crazy people. Look I don’t know what type of hold Ryder…”
“No touching! No more touching,” Tony screamed hands pushing away Natasha’s. His words caught on sobs, each cry a fragment of its own kind. His eyes went back and forth.
“No, I have to make up for it Bucky. I can’t…I have to be enough this time to protect him. It has to be me this time,” Steve told him sternly.
“Look at me, when I am talking to you,” Ryder demanded.
Tony backed up. “I need that video for insurance. Rhodey back me up.”
He had sent a text to Steve a little while ago making sure everyone had made it back safely and that the kids were all picked up. Steve had sent back his own text with a picture of everyone in the main room smiling.
Tony, however, was never one for silence. And there were things he wanted to get off of his chest, things that his therapist told him he should say aloud. Tony debated with himself and felt his heart pressing tightly against his chest.
Tony tilted his head as though considering it.
“It’s true,” Peter mumbled.
“So Washington D.C. 2009 didn’t happen?” Natasha teased, mouth tilted in a smirk.
“Yeah, what happened to your voice,” another kid, Kevin, questioned. “It sounds funny.”
She opened the door and warmly greeted him, “Hello, er det noe jeg kan hjelpe deg med?”
He’d like to think he would. Maybe even with the absence of the others he would eventually have been led to his decision to leave Ryder. He believed that there were always people in your life that could help guide you. Besides the woman that he met at the beach had already began to make him reflect on his relationship. So…he was leaving for himself. He was leaving because he knew he didn’t need Ryder’s touch that left bruises and scars. He didn’t need him. He supposed that he never had.
Tony panted loudly, tremors settling in his legs as Steve’s never-ending thrusts grew particularly relentless driving forward in that one spot, repeatedly. Steve licked into his mouth, open and breathy.
And hell, who even got turned on by pictures of someone clearly abused. Probably this fucker right here, all smiling and acting like he hadn’t been affected. Steve was really going to have to do a cursing cleanse, once he was done dealing with this man. He sent apologies to his ma, who was probably chastising him from above.
“You said you would get rid of it,” Pepper directed at Tony, her face suddenly dangerously close to Tony.
“That is true,” Tony commented. “I mean goodness you blew up my phone with compliments. You should know that flattery gets you nowhere.”
Tony had dressed Miles in a heavy coat, a knit cap, and a pair of glasses that he insisted he keep on. While there were preventive measures to make sure Miles stayed out the public eye, Tony certainly didn’t want someone to take a picture of Miles. Tony himself couldn’t exactly hide his signature goatee, but he hoped that a pair of glasses, a bulky coat, and a ball cap could help camouflage him. Steve…well Steve put on a cap and hoped the new addition of his beard still camouflaged his identity.
He didn’t want those concerned eyes that pleaded with Tony for him to just help.
This time Steve truly was angry, but not at Tony…at the fact that Tony felt he had to apologize for reacting. “No, you don’t get to do that.”
“Umm, to Tony?” he stated as a question.
“Hello?”
Steve turned around mulishly. “Fine, you can help me.”
“Well, everything has to be placed in its original order. All blocks must be separated by color. Each group has a limit of 1,950 Lego blocks,” Natasha instructed.
Tony breathed in and on his exhale exclaimed, “Steve I need to tell you something.”
Steve didn’t complain, but just let Tony let it all out.
“No,” Ryder growled lowly.
So why shouldn’t Tony enjoy this affection, at least for the little bit of time he would receive it.
“Wow, that’s actually pretty amazing,” Sam admitted. “You’ll have to tell him I said thanks. While I would love to be back, I think I need some time back with my family.”
Tony smiled and looked behind him as Steve walked away. Ryder immediately settled his hand on Tony’s lower back and steered him away. He wanted to say so many things and he wanted his hand to press so hard on Tony’s back that it left a bruise. He wanted to scrape his nails at the soft flesh of Tony’s hipbone and remind him that his body belonged to him and him alone…Steve had no right to go around making dinner for what was his.
“Bekah,” Steve said knowing full well he would revert back to calling her Mrs. Keener, even unconsciously. “How are you doing?”
While the two knew things were not quickly resolved, there was a hope feeling them. A hope that things could change.
It was not possible that the man who he had stood beside would ever…
The two stared in a rather uncomfortable silence not really knowing who should speak up. Clint didn’t know why he went into this without a plan. He had thought his talk with Natasha had prepared him for this, but it hadn’t.
“No, back in Siberia…hell this past year,” Tony tiredly announced.
Bruce wished that alone could have satisfied him.
When he woke up, the first thing he noticed was the hand in his clenching and unclenching. He rose from his lying position and noticed Tony was awake and looking at him.
“There’s never a reason I could ever stop loving you. Puke and all,” he said, adding a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Alright, let’s get you all cleaned up and then put you to bed.”
Bekah rolled her eyes and playfully swatted at Steve’s stomach. “Oh and we were doing so well.”
Natasha pressed firmer into Steve’s shoulder. “Steve, keep your head on your shoulders. He’s just trying to manipulate you into doing something that gets him free. You know that if we potentially harm him more than within reason, without a confession we have no choice but to let him go and we could potentially get into trouble. Save all of this energy for when we have a confession. Then I would gladly assist you in putting a dagger through his eyes.”
“Then you would have never suggested to bring in Tony, if you actually had cared,” Steve told him. “So no, he’s not coming. He’s staying as far away from this situation as he possibly can.”
“You what?” Ryder growled, admittedly shocked by this new information. His foot pressed harder against the gas. “What do you mean you told someone about the CMPNY?”
“Perhaps I should reenact our time right here right now let Steve know how pretty the sounds you make are, when you cry,” Ryder laughed. “Let him hear you cry and not be able to do anything about it.”
Natasha looked after Clint as he continued walking to the building. Steve had wanted to say something against this, but he knew it was true. Tony had always placed his lab time before team time anyways. What would be different from then to know? However, he had hopes that Tony wouldn’t go running to the lab as soon as he saw them.
“You can’t keep me here. Tony is going to come get me. He will always come and get me. He and I are forever. He’s mine. Mine, you hear me,” Ryder yelled, hands scratching at his skin. “You can’t keep us apart. You tried…but he’ll come back. He always does and if not I’ll get to him.”
But Steve wasn’t the better that Tony needed. He had proof that he wasn’t every time Tony raised his hands to his arc reactor, when he saw Steve. He had proof, when sometimes Tony’s smiled dimmed as he raised a hand to rest on his shoulder or made a sudden movement toward him. Tony had always been openly affectionate and gravitating toward touch. It’s almost poetic how the first time Steve actually wanted to reach out and touch, Tony pulled away.
“Now, me. I’m personally hoping you get the one that kills you,” Tony honestly replied. “And part of me hopes that you don’t ever take the pills and just remain in this sad state of never-ending pain.”
“It’s nothing short of some obsession. Ryder was obsessed with the destruction that Tony seemingly caused him and at some point he truly loved him. He felt betrayed that someone he loved would ruin his life, take away his opportunity of great scientific discovery. But for a few years he forgot. That obsession had dwindled down to just a fading interest, but then someone called him saying that Tony was alone after the Accords.”
“Miles is too young to see this horrible bad romcom. So we’re going to go,” Harley announced. “Alright kid let’s go find your Aunt Nat. How many seashells did you get?”
And maybe love is what compelled him to do what he did next.
Tony’s heart stopped then and there. Okay, it was time to call the medic. Then Miles’ next words quickly sent him to the grave.
“Happy told me.” Pepper held on tighter, whispering into his ear, “You doing alright?”
“And he was, my first kiss. At least the first guy I ever kissed. It happened during a party. He was drunk and he probably forgot that he had told me. It was less than ideal because his mouth tasted strong like alcohol and a mixture of everyone else he had been hooking up with,” Tony inserted. “But it didn’t matter to me because it felt perfect. I felt myself falling in love.”
“I bet the reason you stayed was of how good it felt not to be lonely. I know you had realized that everyone around you disappointed you one way or another, mine was just a little physical. But hey, on somedays it wasn’t as bad as Howard’s, right? You remember how he could get?”
Steve licked his lips. He clenched his jaw, all the while thinking about what Bucky had said. He knew there was merit in what Bucky was explaining to Steve. Steve just always figured he had to do things alone. Quite possibly that was the main reason for the things that led up to Siberia. If only he hadn’t thought he could shoulder everything with Bucky alone. Possibly if he had let Tony in and…
And he wanted to kill him.
He hated to admit it, but even now months later sometimes the feel of someone being this close was a little stifling. He was doing better, but sometimes it was hard to adjust. Steve was always understanding of him needing space, but damn it all if Tony just wanted to get through one night of sleep without waking up Steve and making him concerned.
“Did you want anything for lunch? I’m making something quick for when Miles wakes up from his nap, but…why are you looking at me like that?” Tony sighed softly. “Really again?”
He whispered softly, but his voice was too soft for Rhodey to register that he said something. So Rhodey opened his mouth to say something to break the silence.
“I’m impressed. You won a game built for five year olds,” Tony teased.
“It’ll be fine. No need to be nervous you’ve done grand openings before,” Rhodey said, removing his hands from Tony’s so that he could eat his remaining French fries.
written above it.
He sighed, closed his eyes and prayed for once that he didn’t screw this up.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Harley flopped back in the car seat and turned his head up.
Steve took Miles backpack and put it in the truck of the car, before helping Miles get situated in the backseat.
FRIDAY remained silent as though she had not heard his question.
Sam was always the one sitting at Tony’s desk, reading through the various books that Tony had scattered around his room. Sam noted with great fascination that Tony had a list of books that could rival his own back home. He had made it a mission back then to read as many as he could, so that when Tony came back they could have conversations about it, maybe grow in their own friendship.
“I am completely on board with that,” Steve said. Then he brought his glass and poured some sparkling cider in it.
Tony shook his head. “No, of course I don’t. I don’t know how many times I have to tell you. All of that meant nothing.”
“Ryder, I didn’t know…”
“I will,” Tony said feeling guilty.
“What are they arguing about?” Tony said hearing the other voices in the background.
Ryder’s head lolled to the side and he tried raising his hands to punch Steve. His movements were too haggard and slow and resulted in Steve pushing his body against the wall behind him. Ryder bit his lip in anger and chose that to compel him to charge forward pushing against Steve.
“Yeah,” Bucky said. “What’s that look for?”
Everyone’s face looked stricken at the implication and made no moves to talk. They hadn’t know things had gotten this bad. Pepper straightened her shoulders and nods her head twice. Pepper bit her lip.
“This is exactly why I didn’t tell you Rhodey. I knew you would react like this.”
Natasha nodded solemnly. “Well, it’s never too late to make amends. Who knows what the future might hold?”
Ryder straightened his shoulders and repeated, “Benedici il CMPNY.”
The words no longer sounded soft. The face of Steve altered into Ryder’s.
Before he was able to even think about making his way to the window, he could hear the excited chatter of Miles. The door opened and he let out a relieved sigh. Peter came in holding a flailing Miles, followed by Harley.
“Please, don’t even joke about that.”
Bucky’s eyes hesitantly searched Steve’s before clearing his throat. “May I see a packet…Miss?”
He made excuses to the girls, telling them he would be right back. He ignored Karen looking at him as he passed through the kitchen outside.
Harley and Peter are quick to make a place before sitting by Tony.
“I do trust all of you,” Tony said.
“Out of all the days,” Pepper rolled her eyes. “Okay, Tony clean up. Fingers better be sparkling. Go shower and be back down here in 30 minutes.”
The soft touch was so different in comparison to the last time Tony and Steve were physically close back in Siberia. Both of their minds were focused on this, but neither chose to speak up afraid of disrupting this silence.
He remembered a conversation. He thought he remembered barely even saying no to a proposal, before he was pushed aside into a hallway leading to a back alley of the hotel. He remembered hands reaching out toward him, forcefully guiding him away from the safety of watchful eyes.
Tony and the others had all come in the morning. They had come in with their buildings and set them aside. Natasha had explained how they needed to judge which one was the best in their eyes and the children had readily accepted the task.
“I should have come sooner. Have you been standing out here long? I know that any person who passes the receptionist literally can stay there forever. One day you’re being entertained with a full musical piece then the next second you can be getting instructions on how to meal prep.”
“Peter school comes first. We’ve already talked about this. May is allowing you to keep this side job in return that your school work doesn’t suffer. Look if you have anything you need to get handled let me know. Maybe you can take a break during weekdays and just focus on your education. Then like on a few weekends and a few days in the summer you can go back to your full slinging webs and sticking on buildings.”
“I can make animals,” Clint said. “I used to make them for my own kids.”
Steve began to feel the confidence settle in his shoulders. He had a long way to go, but he was certain that at the end of the day Tony felt the same or at least a little bit of what Steve was feeling. After all if his feelings weren’t even slightly returned, Tony would have somewhat kindly told Steve to leave his lab.
“Alright but-”
Tony brought his head up, looked at Ryder’s face.
“Well it was kind of personal so,” Steve said. “But just know that we talked.”
“See that you do. Right now, she’s been performing pieces from
He added desperation and heartbreak into his voice.
“It must have been if Tony never left,” Isak said, rolling his shoulders, once and then twice before settling.
“Yeah, they’re taken care of. So now that you can rest easy with that, let me take care of you, yeah?”
“Okay, well I’ve been hurt physically. I’m sure everyone knows that. Everyone on this team gets hurt physically. I’ve been hurt verbally. I’ve been hurt emotionally. I’ve been hurt to the point where I just feel fucking empty and purposeless. I’ve been hurt to the point where I just want to isolate myself and quickly disappear. I’ve been hurt to the point where I can’t move my body.”
“Steve,” Tony whispered confusedly.
Steve’s hand rested heavily on Tony’s back and provided a grounding strength. Steve leaned over Tony his tongue sweeping over Tony’s bottom lip. Tony gasped in surprise his mouth falling open at the movement. Steve took this response as a welcome to his advances. The kiss was soft, slow, and adventurous as if mapping out each other.
“Hey…no why are you saying that as though…Tony what’s going on? I need you to tell me where you are. Tony.”
“I can’t believe you actually were thinking of saying no to me. After all I have done for you, you ungrateful…” a sound of breaking class was heard.
Tony then turned angry eyes to him. “You don’t have to ask. I’m not some fucking fragile person to be careful of touching. Fuck, Ryder’s done a hell lot worse, I’m sure you could tell. I little hand holding isn’t going to kill me.”
Steve walked in and thought first of going to see Tony, but then thought otherwise. He went to his bathroom, which was only two doors down from his bedroom door, which was cracked open enough so that Steve could slide his body through it without even opening it further.
Steve looked on angrily, even knowing that he had no reason. He wasn’t the one to pull Tony out of these attacks whenever he stumbled upon Tony having one. He wasn’t the one who go to match his breaths with Tony. He wasn’t the one to hold Tony’s wrists and rub circles into the smooth skin there and bring Tony’s body closer to his as an excuse to calm him down, when actually he just wanted to be closer and that was the only time Tony allowed him to be.
“Tony, shut up.”
“TON-Y.”
Sure, they met at SHIELD Headquarters frequently, but Tony had been so busy lately that those became just quick meetings and running across one another in the corridor as he juggled between works for SHIELD, meetings at SI and time spent innovating/inventing. Tony usually stayed at his penthouse four nights a week, but when he did stay over on the weekend, Bucky would be with them every minute. The few rare dates they had, Bucky insisted on tagging along every time, climbing into the car and not budging until they gave up and took him along. At least Bucky behaved while they were out, but that also meant that they were very conscious about having an audience during their supposedly ‘alone’ time. Steve felt uncomfortable making out with Tony in the car with Bucky sitting at the back, staring at them with narrowed blue eyes. Tony used to snuggle into his side as they walked down the street, but since he had Bucky’s leash (Bucky refused to walk leashed to Steve) and Bucky had developed this habit of yanking his leash, Tony had a hard time keeping close to Steve.
He knew what he had to do.
And for a while, it seemed like things were getting there. Ironteddy was quite spooked after he realised his feelings and planned to pull away from Captain before it could get worse, but Captain, in all of his red-white-blue glory, was determined to stop that from happening. When Ironteddy tried to hole up in the workshop and lose track of time by fixing a bit of armour, Captain squirmed his way in with a sketch book and giant puppy eyes, asking to hang out. Eventually, Ironteddy just gave up and let Captain do as he please. Which meant a lot of team movie nights, days out on the basketball court and prank wars all over the tower. There were also quiet nights, when Captain talked Ironteddy into snuggling with him into a fluffy blanket and watching old black-and-white movies, or nights spent on the balcony just stargazing and chatting. It did nothing to quell Ironteddy’s feelings and he found himself loving Captain more and more each day. And it seemed to him like Captain was starting to feel something too, for every now and then he caught Captain looking at him intensely or feeling their paws brushing against one another as they walked side by side around the park at night. He did not want to think about it, but sometimes he could even feel a tiny ember of love warmth radiating from Captain, a small thing that grew with each day, basking him in a warm glow and making him want to burst into joy.
“It is so on!”
Obie looked at Mr Jarvis as if he was insane, but only mirthlessly chuckled and said, “Why not?”
Ironteddy still moved and designed after he was gone, so he figured Rhodeybear did love him still.
To humans, they appeared to be just like any normal toy. They sat still and did not breathe and could not move and were an inanimate object through and through. The idea that a toy created by man would be alive was just inconceivable, yet somehow was completely true, for the life of teddy bears defied all biological rules known to man. Teddies became alive the moment they received their first stuffing and grew aware of the surrounding world as they became more and more completed.
Ironteddy met Captain in Germany of all places.
“I’ve got a science question!” chimed in Clint, who had actually raised his hand like a primary schooler. “Does this mean there is an alternative universe for all Pixar-slash-Disney movies? Is there one with talking toys? Or bipedal mammals? Or airborne-balloon-house?”
How was it not even past noon yet, Bruce wondered.
Bucky, a notoriously territorial dog, hated everyone that was not Steve. He growled like a feral dog whenever he heard people walking by the house, he barked at everyone who entered his territory, he snapped his jaws at hands that try to pet him – not that it happened very often, since people usually scrammed when they saw him, a giant of a dog, with massive jaws and sturdy legs and eyes so sharp he honed in on others like a rabbit he would love to swallow bones and all. And no matter how much Steve tried to brush his hair, he still appeared half-feral.
He could still feel Spideybear gripping at his shoulders, his quick breath, his begging eyes. He could still see Strangeteddy’s blue eyes as it burned into his, silently asking for forgiveness, for love, for everything. Distantly, he remembered seeing the Guardians disappearing as well, yet it did not register to him what had happened. He just sat there where Spideybear used to be, his paws full of ash as he watched what remained of his beloved blow away.
(“What is Bucky doing back at my house???”
He would not trade this for anything in the world.
, Ironteddy thought.
Steve’s phone started ringing. Both of them ignored it, too engaged in the task of stripping one another.
“Oh my god!”, blurted Clint, who had come to the same conclusion apparently.
. And so he did, for his finger stopped and he frowned down at him.
Somehow, love crept in between them. Unlike the love he had for Captain that burned bright with passion, this was a quiet, gentle thing, like calm waves lapping at his legs when Pepper took him to Malibu for the first time. Ironteddy, no longer a stranger to the feeling, tried to shut it out as a habit and pretended it was not there, in fear that Strangeteddy would find out. He found out anyway, for on one of those endless nights he draped an arm over Ironteddy in a half-embrace as his cloak covered the both of them in a warm cocoon.
There they were in the middle of space, a million sparkling stars around yet not a single soul in sight. They had no idea where the ship was taking them or how far away their destination was, how long it would take to get there. There was no need for them to be in control of the ship, so they ended up having plenty of time to spare. Ironteddy and Spideybear spent hours looking through the alien technology like bright-eyed children, amazed by how alien it all was while Strangeteddy meditated quietly. Sometimes, Strangeteddy joined them as they explored the ship, somehow following their rabid discussions with no problem. When Spideybear finally knocked off and went to the living quarters to find a comfy pillow to sleep on, Ironteddy and Strangeteddy would sit in front of the giant glass screen and peered into the deep dark space, discussing everything that came to mind.
Before long, Bucky became a legend around SHIELD. Or, as Clint liked to call it, Steve’s cock-blocking beast. Apparently SHIELD agents had a lot of free time on their hands, because alongside the when-will-they-be-caught-banging-on-Fury’s-desk pool, now there was a when-will-Steve-give-up-on-Bucky and when-will-Tony-ultimately-leave-Steve-for-Bucky pools, which both attracted massive support (and money) from agents at all levels. Even Fury was in on the (terribly named) ‘Buny’ ship (“It’s only the matter of time, Rogers.”). Natasha, who had gotten over the household destruction fiasco, was now in charge of a countdown clock to the day Tony left Steve a “Dear Steve” letter and ran off with Bucky into the sunset.
“I think we managed to make Steve speechless, Jamie-buddy.”
Then, he made U, and that was when he was discovered.
“That’s not dappling, that’s changing the basic rules of reproduction!”
To be fair, Bucky pretty much gave them his blessing from day one.
Subtly, Thanos nodded, and Ironteddy felt a wave of relief. He leaned against the warm leather of Thanos’ shirt and let go.
Richards looked all flabbergasted.
“What was that Birdbrain?”
There were times when Bruce wondered whether living in the same state as the Fantastic Four was a good idea.
They arrived at an abandoned casino near Reno and went after the blinking signal from the chip. Bucky found it on a poker machine, caked with blood.
And it was not even nine yet.
“You sound so snippy for someone who knows his dog is safely home.”
That was, in fact, not quite true, for there were Mr Jarvis and Obie, who gave him enough love to sustain him and let him move his legs and wiggle his ears. Their love was enough for him to think and create and feel.
Tony’s bots then proceeded to poke and tap him as well, albeit a bit more enthusiastically than they were with EVE. Soon EVE joined the clan and the five of them huddled into a bot-circle which immediately let out a series of excited chirps and whirrs and whistles. Dummy, Butterfingers and U happily circled the new bots, poking and tapping at them and nudging their claws at WALL-E and EVE, who in turn petted them with their appendages.
Tony should have known that agreeing to that was a mistake. That night was a rare occasion of Ryder placing such affections on him in a way that didn’t cause his body to ache and clinch up in phantom pains.
“It’s yours just as much as it is mine,” he said and without a second glance to her, he was being led away to his floor with Ryder.
Tony had no good reason to answer him why. He shouldn’t have left him here and not visited. He could only imagine how this must have affected Miles.
Tony turned his face up to Ryder’s. His hands found themselves running over the stubble of Ryder’s cheek. Ryder leaned into the touch and placed a cool hand on Tony’s cheek.
This wasn’t the same Steve.
Cali nodded briefly. It was mere minutes that she left and returned again. Her face was marked with grief. “She chose not to speak to me,” Cali told them all, knowing why they were looking at her quick return with confusion.
“You alright?” Steve questioned, wrapping his arms around Tony.
“Never said that. Look I have to go. Have fun at Peter’s school,” she said waving goodbye to Tony then leaning down to kiss Miles’ on the cheek.
“Look honesty is the best policy. So
Karen’s brows furrowed. “Is that…goodness Tony is that why you think I’ve been wanting you to come back every week?”
Steve nodded. “Okay, we don’t have a location, but we do have a name and a face. We need to get in touch with Miriam, before Ryder gets to her. Need to see if she’ll be able to name any of the other faces.”
Peter went into the kitchen with Miles and Tony came over to sit on the couch Steve was sitting on. Steve watched as Tony stretched out on the couch and turned toward Steve.
He didn’t however mention to their therapist how many nights he found himself seeking comfort in that fort made of pillows and blankets as well.
Miriam smiled darkly. Choosing not to say anything, she opened her suitcase and in it revealed bottles of different alcoholic beverages. Tony immediately felt anger. He had been working on his sobriety for years and he would be damned if it would all go to waste by these two women. Miriam grabbed one bottle and closely inspected it.
Ryder shrugged his shoulders. “We all have our defense mechanisms and if yours is to believe in the false surety of safety offered by your family then who am I to deny you. Miriam be a dear and clean up Tony. He smells dreadful.”
Thanks again for all the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. Makes my heart happy.
See why this physically drained me?
“Okay, good. Well I have to go and Tony is asleep right now so would one of you mind watching over Miles at least until Tony wakes?”
When they finally sound the location, they hadn’t wasted anytime in going. The Avengers and SHIELD agents were there. They had entered the building, an underground space in the heart of a woody area some thousands of miles from the tower.
Steve didn’t look to sure. So instead he said, “Fine.”
Both Bucky and Steve stated at the same time.
“I was, but I wanted to come back early and surprise you. Surprise,” Ryder laughed.
He then used his free hand to play with the fraying end of Steve’s jacket. Steve tracked the movement and noticed sadly how Tony’s finger seemed to be shaking.
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
“Water,” Steve also said.
Bucky let his hands fall from Steve’s shoulder. “Why on earth would you think that we would let you and Tony deal with this alone?”
Tony looked back toward where Steve was helping guide children to their specific rides. He looked at Tony and flashed a warm smile at him. Tony gave one back.
Tony clicked his tongue against the back of his teeth.
“That sounds fine. Besides that means Miles and I can blast the music we like without heavy judgment from the peanut gallery. Isn’t that right bambino?”
Tony had ended his weekly visits, but still kept on sending gifts and checking in. But he couldn’t go there and see Miles and know that he couldn’t keep him. He definitely wasn’t fit enough to be a father and he shouldn’t get Miles’ or his hopes up that he ever would be able to adopt him. There would be some family who eventually came and saw Miles’ bright face and decide to want to bring him into their home. Tony clenched his jaw at the thought of someone taking his Miles…his bambino.
Sam didn’t even look up from where he was making biscuits. “Natasha what a wonderful surprise. Mind telling me why you are breaking into my home this early in the morning.”
Touch never seemed to wake Steve, at least not the soft barely there touches that Tony offered at night where he felt he just needed a reminder that Steve was here with him. Steve would wake immediately at the first gasp or startled cry, but in his sleep he would turn into touch and nuzzle the back of Tony’s hand as Tony caressed his cheek.
He also wondered why CMPNY sounded so familiar to him.
“And of your loyalty?” Bruce inserted calmly.
“Hi, you’ve reached the voicemail messaging system of Steve Roger to leave a message please wait for the tone,” the automated voice message
“You realize that no one will ever love you like I do, right?” he said completely ignoring Tony.
“I mean I am a celebrity figure Peter. It all comes with the territory,” said Tony ruffling Peter’s hair.
“Did they ask for forgiveness?”
Steve picked up the folder and opened it up, breathing harshly through his noise before turning one picture to Isak. Natasha took a sharp intake of breath and Bucky crack his knuckles.
“I couldn’t even depend on myself to bring him back home. I am the leader…I’m Tony’s…I’m his…I have to be the one to help him because I didn’t even do anything to bring him back. All I did was wait on the sideline, until Wanda and that guy were able to bring a location. And even then Natasha was the one who found him. I did nothing.”
Steve immediately stopped what he was doing and Bucky slowly turned around. “You’ve got to be kidding, right? It’s almost time. Tony should be coming here soon,” Steve muttered.
“Can I go with you?” Julie settled on.
Even though Jarvis had died of natural causes, he still left. His absence was the worst, Tony noted.
Miles rolled his eyes again.
But he trusted Thor and Bruce. “Just make sure he doesn’t…just doesn’t do what he usually does.”
Like what?
Karen continued her relentless attack and then chose to focus on tickling him. “Never. Admit you love me and I’m like quite literally the best adopted sister you could have ever wanted.”
“I can’t seeing as though Ryder never told me the specifics of the location. However, I know a driver who can. Unfortunately, he hasn’t been found since he lost favor with Ryder,” Cali said without further explanation.
Tony laughed bitterly and the noise pierced at Steve’s ears.
“I’m not afraid. I’m totally not afraid. I could ask her if I wanted to,” Peter childishly asserted.
“A person in love would never do something like that to someone they cared for. You can cut the crap Ryder. I have seen your hand and it has revealed everything.”
“Dinner?”
Steve frowned. “I don’t understand…you would be leaving Harley? Bekah you can’t honestly think that this is a great idea. The kid’s finally getting excited about you coming back home to him.”
“He did now?”
“Well you certainly do keep a girl waiting Captain. Now please do remember my safeword is marrow,” she whispered.
Ryder rolled his eyes. “Come on Tony. Don’t be like this. This was all just a lesson. I didn’t even let Winston touch you. I just needed to make you realize that you and I are forever. There is no Steve. Because at the end of the day, Steve will leave you.”
“Tony don’t…Tony don’t fall asleep okay. Keep talking to me, yeah?”
Ryder sighed dejectedly. “I knew how you were back in the day. Hell I probably had a hand in how you started sleeping with so many different people. That was my mistake, wasn’t it? Didn’t know it would get so bad.”
She took a second to look at Tony, before continuing.
He brought his body up and looked at Tony. Tony stared and Steve felt as though Tony knew exactly what questioned weighed heavy on his mind.
“You may have had time to deal with your parents being killed in an accident, but you haven’t had the time to rationalize that your parents were murdered by the guy you are currently playing host to.”
Tony remained silent, but let another memory wash over him. His mouth was telling the story before he even realized what he was saying.
“Well, it was nice seeing you all again. I will see you all in three weeks at the gala. Please send Tony my love, when he wakes.”
“It’s not your fault,” Tony whispered.
“I said the future not the present. Get some sleep Steve. And look over the document. If you need to talk more or confess your undying love for Tony come to me,” Natasha said hoping to light the feeling in the room.
Sighing he grabbed onto soap, and pressed it into his skin. In some places, the scented soap soothed an ache that had been long buried just enough for Steve to settle in his revenge. Still Steve wondered if it was enough. He wondered, if all that he had done today would make him content later.
Coming closer to Steve, even more than seemed possible, he softly said, “I do.”
Rhodey leaned forward, elbows pressing into the mattress of the bed. “Because I want to hear from you how you’re doing with everything going on, so that I can know how to help.”
Peter shook his head. “You have nothing to feel sorry for. Crap, I…that’s not what this is to make you feel. The only one who should be feeling any amount of sorry and blame is Ryder,” he hissed angrily.
“After you take your medicine okay.”
And Steve had accepted all of that fairly well. He figured it was better to accept this Bucky standing in front of him than pushing him away in favor of waiting for the guy that fell off the train.
“I didn’t get a kid. I offered to watch Miles until he recovered from pneumonia. It’s not like I adopted him or anything.”
Steve smiled at that. “Well that’s a good move forward.”
Tony had to assure him that Tony knew when to stop and with the insistence of adding a safeword just in case, the two had now grown more comfortable in initiating things like this.
He went into the restroom alone and closed the door behind him. He looked to the full bath tub and shivered. He had never done well with large bodies of water after Afghanistan and his hands shook. He decided to leave that be for a little, instead choosing to look around the bathroom. He was dissatisfied that there were no means of escaping at least through the window. However, there was a vent.
“Of course you do, but you’re falling asleep Miles,” Tony whispered. “And you, Harley, bed by ten. Bucky if he goes to sleep later I will know and I will find you.”
“Platypus. My goodness have I missed seeing your face,” Tony exclaimed pulling back from Rhodey. “How is my hallmark movie romance going?”
Steve and Tony had been a little concerned, after transferring Miles to this preparatory school for his third grade year. They had decided to do public school for his kindergarten through second grade year, but Miles had just been bored by the lesson plans there and needed just a little more of a challenge and that was saying a lot because that public school had an amazing reputation and teaching staff.
“Yes, you do. Otherwise, you would have put that knife, that the pretty little assassin gave you, straight through my heart,” Ryder announced. “Oh, didn’t think I knew about that, huh? I knew you wouldn’t have it in you. After all, you can’t kill the first person you ever loved. You and I both know how you’re still haunted by Obie’s death.”
Ned meanwhile stood start struck at Tony. “You…you know…” Ned let out a few discernible sounds and pressed his hand against his heart.
“Yeah, clearly someone who plans on putting pasta in a dry pan knows how to cook. You do know you need to add water, right?” Bucky muttered taking the pan and adding water to it. “Then you have to let it boil. And I remember you burning the broth, when we were kids. It was broth Steve.”
Ryder pressed forward on shaky hands.
Steve watched as Bucky followed Clint into the jail cell where Natasha was waiting for them. Steve fell to his knees as soon as the door was closed and rubbed the palms of his hands into his eyes cursing away the tensing pain filling in them.
When the ride was over, Steve curled an arm around Tony’s shoulder. Tony patted Steve’s back. “It’s alright Captain. I won’t tell anyone about you screaming like a newborn baby,
“And why do you keep calling me Rogers all of a sudden?” Steve said moving closer to Tony.
He ran it delicately over the skin there, wiping away the remnants of vomit and tears on his face. He used that same one to wipe at the mess on the floor. He grabbed a few wipes and cleaned the rest of it, before throwing both towel and wipes into the trashcan. Steve went into the restroom and grabbed another towel and wet it with warm water. Steve ran the cloth over Tony’s forehead and cheeks, hoping to get some warmth back into his face. Tony’s shaking slowly subsided, with the added pressure of Steve wiping his face and his other hand rubbing soothing patterns onto the blanket covering him.
“God, Barton, I am not mommy. According to WALL-E, I am totally the dad and Steve the mom. But that’s not the poi…”
DUMMY, with his rudimentary process power, could recognise and acknowledge Ironteddy as his creator. He was clumsy and naïve and more trouble than help as he bumped into various tidbits and cheerfully greeted every inanimate things he saw with funny chirps and beeps. Ironteddy had smuggled him from the workshop into the toy room as soon as he could, and since hardly anyone but Mr Jarvis came in there, there was minimal chance of DUMMY being found. DUMMY’s vocal tendency did help Ironteddy a lot too; the sound, while seemingly annoying, showed that DUMMY did care for him, even with his basic learning ability, and that to a teddy was no different from love. Ironteddy felt happy and warm next to him and they snuggled together in sleep, despite DUMMY’s pointy claws and cold metal case.
And so, Ironteddy made himself a teddy bear. It was hard work for a teddy bear, to make another teddy, for he never knew how to crochet or sew or thread. He wanted his friend to be perfect, so he spent days looking for the perfect material, the softest yarn and felt, the nicest buttons, the fluffiest microfibre. He had to hide it from Obie who would not want him to make teddies while he was supposed to make gadgets and weapons. It took him a long time, but finally his teddy bear was complete, a grey bulldozer of a bear with so many huggable pieces, who looked fierce and threatening yet still a ball of fluff underneath, not unlike Ironteddy himself. He named him Rhodeybear.
(Afterwards, the doctors made a big fuss when they found the three of them snuggling in bed. Bucky gave them a baleful look and bared his pointy teeth which effectively shut them up. Tony asked Steve whether he could borrow Bucky next time he had to stay in hospital and Steve growled at him, saying that Tony would not have to stay in a hospital again ever, not on his watch. Bucky leaned against him and thumped his tail, so he also agreed. Tony pouted, but he let the two of them cuddle him with a smile on his face, plus he had been trying to persuade Rhodes to get him the good coffee for a few days now, so it was not like he minded.)
, Ironteddy thought.
“Shhh, Hawkeye!”
But anyway, since no one looked like they wanted to close this portal anytime soon, Bruce now also found himself looking at it in resignation. To be fair, the portal was very well-behaved so far. The bright light emitting from the yawning gape of time and space, which was oddly calm and peaceful and not at all threatening, just kept on growing in intensity. Bruce even heard a very soft instrumental piece in the background, which bizarrely enough had a great calming effect on the Other Guy. Bruce himself though was shuddering a little from all the strange events.
On Earth, Captain suddenly woke up from a long nightmare. He turned around and laid his eyes on Sergeant who was lying next to him, sleeping soundly without a single clue.
). Spideybear had been loved his entire life and while the two of them shared a tiny apartment in Queens and May was away at work a lot, they had never wanted for anything. Spideybear had lived his entire life always filled to the brim with love and affection, and while Ironteddy knew that was a normal life for a teddy, the concept of it was so foreign to him he could not wrap his head around it at all.
Eventually, Nebula joined him. Ironteddy felt warmth surrounding either side of him, yet he could not bear to reciprocate. When she carried him back onto their ship, he could hardly feel a thing.
One was his new job at SHIELD. After three tours in the Middle East, a mission that went awry and being trapped in a collapsed building for a week while war raged on outside, Steve received a shiny new medal and an honourable discharge on the grounds of his PTSD. Steve, who had grown accustomed to the dust and sweat and gunpowder and being constantly on the move, would have gone stirred crazy back in his relatively peaceful childhood neighbourhood in Brooklyn, if it was not for Phil whom he met briefly during his tours but apparently was impressed enough to offer him a job pretty much the moment he set foot back on American soil. The new job was very different from his time in the Army, requiring way more stealth and a surprising amount of diplomatic negotiations, but it was enough to keep his mind and hands busy. The pay was generous enough to let him keep his childhood townhouse and the hours flexible enough for him to pursue other hobbies, like fixing up his old Harley, resuming his drawing and spending more time with Bucky.
They should have seen this coming. Tony was a highly classified celebrity who owned Stark Industries and had access to high-tech weaponry on a daily basis. Tony, whose brilliant mind meant the creation of a miniaturised arc reactor in a cave and a new element synthesised in his basement. Tony, who had connections with SHIELD and the Army. Tony, a world-class genius, was essentially still a man with no military training and none of the protection one of his calibre should have. Tony, the most prized bargaining chip of all.
One day, he woke up from a nap on the desk to Spideybear draping a blanket over him and reminding the bots to ‘let Dad sleep’. It made him feel warm with love for weeks.
Which led to Tony, the third on his list. Tony, who more or less rubbed him the wrong way the moment they met at a gala at which Steve was supposed to get some intel on Hammer Corps and their underground weapon dealings to the Middle East. Tony, with his suave manner and swift movements and beautiful brown eyes, made Steve both want to strangle him and kiss him senseless against the wall. Tony, who saw Steve sneaking into Hammer’s office but only winked at him and went off to distract Hammer for a good half hour while Steve got all the files he needed. Tony, who cornered Steve at the car park and only snickered when Steve threatened him, then leaned into his space and nonchalantly talked to Clint the other side of the comm through the hidden microphone on Steve’s lapel. Tony, who turned out to be the owner of Stark Industries as well as the tech supplier for SHIELD. Tony, who made Clint’s arrows and called Natasha by pet names and could out of the blue waltz into Fury’s office without fear of being shot in the head.
Clint’s face, however, just looked like Christmas was here early.
What did it matter, now that they were dead?
“Oh, kiddo”, Obie’s voice rumbled in his chest, vibrating Ironteddy’s entire body.
And it was just something about Obie’s voice, or his softened expression, his deep blue eyes and gentle warm hands that reminded Ironteddy of Mr Stark on the day he discovered his secrets, the day when Mr Stark loved him. Obie was also full of love for him, a fire rapidly warming up his every fibres, and somehow, Ironteddy felt a twinge in his chest. If teddy bears could cry, he would have cried right then, but he could not, so all he could do was raising his arms out towards Obie, like a child begging for a hug. Ironteddy could not speak, yet Obie seemed to understand him anyway and he pulled Ironteddy close to his chest, hugging him one-handedly while Ironteddy gripped at his shirt tightly in his feeble fabric paws, trembling all over even though teddies did not feel the cold.
If it were just any old teddy bears, they would have just accepted their sad reality and did their best to pass by their lonely days. But Ironteddy was a stubborn and smart teddy who refused to accept his fate. And he was nothing if not resourceful. He was created by the brightest of minds and that carried over in him, for there must be a time, so very distant in the past when Ironteddy was nothing more than a doodle on paper, when Mr Stark did feel some love for him. He was made to be a logical teddy, and so he asked himself, where should he get love from? Mr and Mrs Stark were of no help, Mr Jarvis and Obie were not enough to sustain him for long, there were no children or anyone else in the house and he was incapable of going outside by himself.
Steve plopped down on top of Tony and buried his head into the base of Tony’s neck, groaning to the increasingly loud barks from the outside. Tony only sighed and petted his hair regretfully.
Obie did not quite look proud or happy, yet he was not upset either. What was on his face was a completely different expression, one of shockingly bold hunger. When Obie realised that Ironteddy was watching him, the expression disappeared as if Ironteddy had imagined it. His face only expressed love and Ironteddy just wanted to snuggle close to him and not let go. He dared to lean his head against Obie’s chest, which must have surprised Obie for his face stretched out to something much more genuine and his hand came up to cradle Ironteddy’s head. That night, Obie brought Ironteddy back to his room. He placed Ironteddy on the sofa among a mountain of pillows and draped a giant throw over his legs. He kissed Ironteddy on his head, patted his head fondly and wished Ironteddy a good night. Ironteddy watched on as Obie got into the bed nearby and turned off the light. There were but a few metres between them, yet it felt like such a giant gulf. The moonlight from the window seemed to light up Obie’s white night shirt, turning him into a beacon that Ironteddy desperately wanted to reach. Yet, Ironteddy told himself not to be greedy, Obie’s love was already more than enough, for in truth, he was surrounded by a warm layer of love radiated from Obie which made him more at east and happy than he had ever been. And so, Ironteddy snuggled into a pillow, pulled his blanket up to his chin and hummed himself to sleep as Obie’s shining back slowly faded away from his eyes.
“Well, now that you talk about it,” Bruce started, mind already listing out what rules of biology to break (as if biology follows rules at all) and how he could go about to achieve that “there was this fascinating paper just last month…“
It was an unexpected thing.
“Huh.”
Things went so well, Steve was thinking of taking his vacation leave now and extending the France trip. Tony seemed amenable to the suggestion and talked about going south to Cannes, maybe Monaco, while Steve drew Tony’s face as it was illuminated under the Eiffel.
“You just don’t want Steve to make a move until after February so that you can win the bet!”
Bruce was struggling between scientific curiosity and the desire to bang his head against the lab bench. And he was so looking forward to trying out the new scintillator today too.
“Of course I love you, you idiot. Been in love with you for weeks now. Oh god, that was probably too soon wasn’t it…”
“Right…”
It was bound to happen, Ironteddy knew. In a city that never slept, there was meant to be someone mentally coherent enough to notice a teddy bear walking about the city, regardless of how late in the evening it was. And someone did, some random jetlagged tourists who took photos of a teddy bear hopping along the pavement underneath the dimming streetlights, who followed said teddy bear as he skipped all the way to the Stane mansion and watched him climb inside through an opened window.
Except for Mr Stark. For it finally dawned on him one very important realisation: Ironteddy was much smarter than him. Impossibly, a teddy bear made from yarn and microfibres were the brain behind Stark Industries now, not just the toys but also the very intricate technologies. The only thing Mr Stark had to offer was his human hands which he could use to craft the invention. If Ironteddy had such hands, Mr Stark himself would become obsolete. And while the teddy was happy to let Mr Stark take all the credits, Mr Stark himself knew deep down inside that he was no more than a worker for a teddy bear. That thought humiliated and enraged him. A teddy bear he once thought was not enough, and in truth was never as good as his old Captain, was now his superior. The one thing he had always treasured, his creativity and intellect, thwarted by a stuffed toy. And so, Mr Stark gradually grew to resent Ironteddy. He started to pick fights with him for no reasons, started to make silly errors and berate Ironteddy when the creation failed. Ironteddy could also feel his love quickly draining, replaced by cold ire and blazing fury. Yet, a teddy remembered and craved love, and so he told himself,
Years went by and the Starks had created so many wonderful toys. From the loveliest dolls and the most beautiful toy tea sets to complicated puzzle cubes and lively action figures, there was nothing that they had not thought of. Girls and boys near and far loved them, the toys were always a favourite at birthdays and Christmases, the factory was brightly lit day and night and the Starks were richer than they could imagine. Mr Stark had an expansive workshop where he could design all he wanted and Mrs Stark had rolls of beautiful fabrics and drawers full of buttons and lace and all the yarns she could desire. Yet, Mr Stark was still not satisfied, for he realised that of all the toys he had made over the years, none had given him the same kind of joy and hope that Captain used to bring. Thus, one day he decided to recreate Captain. He would make the most perfect teddy bear.
There was a loud whirring coming off the bots. One minute they were all still, next they had unplugged themselves from the station and were zooming across the room towards WALL-E and EVE.
During his third tour, Erskine and Bucky were transferred to another unit in Afghanistan for six months. Erskine never returned and Bucky came back with the mentality of a wild dog and a metal leg attached to the stump of his left foreleg. For weeks, he barked and growled and snapped at anyone who came near him and while he let Steve took care of him, he frequently woke Steve up in the middle of the night with long anguish howls and barks at stray light from passing vehicles. He was skittish around people and violent when others got too close, yet somehow he was still retained as a detection dog, a job he excelled at marvelously with Steve as his new handler. Steve, who was unhappy with Bucky still in war-zone, desperately asked for him to be retired. The lack of good detection dogs at the time meant that his words mostly fell on deaf ears, so when he was discharged, he took the opportunity to pull Bucky out with him, since no one else could handle him without fear of a vicious bite anyway.
Needless to say, Tony was the most frustrating and also the most magnificent thing about New York, ever-changing yet constant all the same, and Steve could not help but wanting to spend the rest of his life by his side.
Then Obie was carrying him off towards Mr Jarvis, telling him that he would be taking Ironteddy with him. Mr Jarvis only looked at him solemnly for a minute, then he sighed and nodded resignedly.
Seriously, shall he just relocate to South America now?
Eventually he came to a lush green planet. There was a wooden hut nestled in among trees and fields, and sat on its porch was the almighty Thanos.
“There seemed to be a miscalculation in our experiment…”
(then there was that time WALL-E and EVE heard JARVIS reprimanding Dummy for accidentally burning Tony’s coffeemaker and were strongly reminded of AUTO and thus tried to destroy JARVIS by uploading their conscience into the building’s main network. It would end up with them having a nice conversation with JARVIS and at the end of it were all pals again and later the team would laugh, but for a whole nerve-wrecking week everyone was on their toes primed for another Ultron event, which did no good to Bruce’s system at all.)
Just that, Bruce could really have less random, potentially dangerous portals in his life.
“Oh but it is, it’s the best. Oh dear, I’ve trained Bucky so well.”
Which was exactly when Clint added his two-cent.
“One more word, Barton, and I will block all the vents of this building and destroy your living habitat. But seriously though, how can you compare me to WALL-E? Such an outdated model! Even if I were a waste allocation machine I would have a much better design than him. For instance, those squeaking tracks of his can be replaced by something much more efficient, at least like that of EVE. Secondly...”
The moment the last bit of thread was snipped off, the teddy took its first breath.
In the aftermath of it, Nebula brought him back to Earth.
Richards, to his credit, did look a bit chagrined this time, although Bruce would bet his collection of Hulk merchandises (no, he did not purchase those himself, thank you very much. They were a teamed effort between Clint’s weird sense of humor and Tony’s I-don’t-give-a-fuck-and-besides-you-look-good-in-green attitude) that the guy was already formulating the next portal in his head.
Finally, his invention was completed. He put down the wrench and took a few steps back, admiring his creation. In a glance, it did not look like much more like a pile of scraps with bits of metal protruding out here and there. But, as Ironteddy flicked up a button at the back, the pile of metal shuddered and came to life. It spun and whistled softly and it moved its little claw up and down. Its viewfinder zoomed in and out and finally focused on Ironteddy.
By the time they had regrouped and transferred the injured to the hospital, Fury sent them a message saying that the kidnappers had made contact via a video and asked for a ransom. They wanted money and political favours, and more importantly they wanted SHIELD technology. As Fury and the Senate debated on the merits of rescuing Tony, JARVIS managed to track down the source of the video to a town in Nebraska. Steve sneaked away from the meeting and found himself a jet. As he walked up the ramp, a bark behind stopped him on his track. Bucky stood a few feet from him, his middle covered with thick bandage, his metal leg still dented, but his eyes were sharp and focus. He hobbled towards Steve, seemingly to come with him, but Steve stopped him with a hand on his head, which Bucky thankfully did not snap at, although he let out a low growl.
He still liked to plop down on Tony’s lap but accepted that sometimes Steve needed his close proximity instead, or Tony wanted to climb into Steve’s lap and cuddle him for a while. He still got antsy when Tony was out of sight for too long (but then again, so was Steve) and he still wanted to sleep in their room at night, but now he placed a paw on the bed first, as if to gauge their reaction. If it was a quiet sleepy night and Tony looked like he needed some extra cuddle, Steve would nod his head and Bucky would jump up right away. But if Steve felt like having some alone time with Tony, he would shake his head and grimaced, and Bucky, while looking unhappy, would go into the corridor and waited as Steve closed the door (he would still not do anything with Tony while Bucky was in the room, it was still super weird to know Bucky could hear them even from the outside). After they finished cleaning up, Steve would open the door and Bucky would come in to sleep in their room, albeit on a pile of blankets they left for him at the foot of the bed (because even Tony said no at Bucky snuggling into him while he was naked). Bucky no longer asked to tag along all of their dates, no longer felt worried and nervous when Tony had to leave the house without him. They still took him along sometimes, but when they did not and had a friend coming over to dogsit him, Bucky did not try to escape the house and hunt them down again.
“What are you still doing on the chair? Come up and complete my super soldier blanket.”
“For fuck’s sake, Steve is not going to pop out any…”
Sudden motion from the foreign objects brought everyone out of their peaceful trance and back on high alert. Natasha tapped her fingers on to the handle of her blades and Clint drew his bow. Tony raised a hand with the repulsor on ready while Thor and Steve held onto their weapons of choice. Bruce, who was still in human form, awkwardly stood behind the group, unconsciously trying not to ruin the beautiful hero/heroine spread.
Strangeteddy did not promise him the future. All they had was now.
“Guess it was a SHIELD thing after all”, Tony voiced his thoughts for him, albeit with a husky throaty voice that did nothing to stop his quest down south of his body.
Then one day, as they were out on one of their late walks, walking so close to one another their paws kept on brushing one another, Ironteddy finally decided to act on his feelings.
In the background Tony made a whimpering sound. Bruce imagined he could hear Steve’s other hand tightening on his shield.
One day, Mr Stark did not come home.
Of course, because she did train them very well, both Steve and Tony were in the car by the time her rant was over, albeit Tony was missing his shoes and Steve’s shirt was only half-buttoned. Bucky transformed back into a puppy when he saw the two of them and tried to squirm his way into Tony’s arms, ignoring Steve and looking at Tony with innocent baby blue eyes when Steve tried to scold him. Tony got Laura more curtains and a Ming dynasty set of china the next day, and thankfully Natasha only bruised Steve’s ribs the next time they sparred (he tried to get out of sparring with her but one sharp look from her was enough to turn his blood into ice). Sam apologised to all of them, but Steve also had to apologise to Sam, and now Sam no longer picked up his calls if it was close to the weekend.
The plan seemed to work so far. Bucky docilely walked between them on the stroll, quietly lied on the dog bed they kept in Tony’s living room and had a grand time playing fetch with the bots in the corridor. He did not even faze when Steve pulled Tony away into the bedroom and closed the door. From inside the room they could hear Bucky’s nails clicking on the wooden floor and the whirring sound of the bots as they chased after him.
Then, they came across a box of Tony’s old toys in the walk-in closet and decided to try something new. Steve never knew that BDSM would be a thing for him (saying it out loud was enough to make him flushed red), but the sight of Tony face down on the bed, his wrists cuffed to the headboard, knees propping his ass up as he wantonly cried out when Steve mouthed down his spine was way more arousing that he ever dreamed it to be. When Steve impulsively smacked Tony’s bottom when he wiggled too much, it shocked a pathetic cry out of Tony and made him rock upwards, more or less rubbing along Steve’s dick, which made him even harder if that was at all possible. Tony turned around and looked at him with dazed teary eyes, but he also squirmed excitedly and hoarsely told
Bucky ended up staying with them for the rest of the week. Tony got them a beach house down in Côte d'Azur and Bucky once again claimed his spot next to Tony on the bed. At least they had a few days to themselves, Steve thought miserably, but then Bucky growled at them when he unconsciously pushed Tony down onto the folded chair in a moment of passion and Steve once more vowed to resolve the Bucky problem before he died from frustration.
At the end of the inventing binge, they had made so many new inventions, not only just toys, but engines and equipment and everything. They made a great team, too. Ironteddy designed while Mr Stark used the tools to make the design come true, with Ironteddy helping out whenever he could. Mr Stark had looked at him with so much pride by the end Ironteddy did not know what to do with it. It was a strange feeling indeed.
The Soul Stone shone.
, he told himself.
Needless to say, oh-my-god-we-both-love-each-other sex was even more amazing than usual sex.)
The first night, Rhodeybear came back without a stitch out of place and a million stories to tell. He told Ironteddy about all the tall buildings he saw, the colourful lights, the giant billboards, the plastic bags floating on the streets, the stores with beautiful clothes inside, the drunk people singing and dancing with a teddy bear they thought they had hallucinated, the smells and sounds, all the most bizarre and disgusting and wondrous things about the city. Rhodeybear slept soundly that night to dreams of the next day while Ironteddy watched his best friend, thinking of a day when Rhodeybear would not return.
It was a boring life. Edward’s love was a fleeting thing, almost non-existing. Only the bots’ undying affection and Obie’s rare visits sustained him. Ironteddy yearned for Mr Stark’s workshop, yearned for pens and papers, yearned to write down all the thoughts in his head, yearned to create, to invent. So one day, Ironteddy started typing his thoughts down onto a document on Edward’s computer. Typing was pretty hard for a teddy bear, the keys were not designed for stumpy teddy paws and he made a lot of mistakes at the beginning. But soon enough, he could type pages and pages of calculations and designs and thoughts and ideas. No flowing literature for him, for he was not educated in the arts, but singular phrases, one word running into the other as they tried to keep up with his million thoughts. At the end of the day, he hid the file under so many inconspicuous folders no one could ever find it and climbed back up the shelves, just in time for the bedroom door to slam open as Edward rushed in with his bag slung over the shoulder and shirt damped from football practice.
“Well, you can’t say that he’s not a good guard dog.”
“Shut up Stark and blast those xenomorphs!”
Then one day, they heard Obie coming through the corridor and Mr Stark’s demeanour completely changed. He picked up Ironteddy and hastily put him under the table, telling him to keep still. Ironteddy nodded frantically, not wanting to show teddykind’s secret to yet another human. From underneath the table, Ironteddy could only hear Obie’s voice and his legs as he walked into the workshop. He heard they exchange greetings and heard Obie’s exclamation as he was shown the new inventions. He heard joy and pride from both of them and that made Ironteddy feel all warm inside, he was so happy, he did not even mind when Mr Stark claimed the new designs and inventions as his own. Obie left with overwhelming joy and arms full of new things while Mr Stark promised that he would have more for him on his next return. When Obie was gone, Mr Stark took Ironteddy out from under the table and told him that they had more work to do.
Which, sadly, threw Tony out of his zone and refocused him on the world of the living.
That was the only time she had loved him.
“What??”
Which brought a decisive look to the Captain’s eyes who proceeded to approach the alien robots/machine parts. Tony next to him was starting to protest and even Richards looked a bit wary, but the man looked like he knew what he was doing, so Bruce just kept a hand on Tony’s arm and watched Steve’s back cautiously.
