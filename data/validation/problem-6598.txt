“I will go where ever master wants me to” Tony answered smiling shyly. Steve couldn’t help the sound of his sudden intake of breath at Tony’s position.
“Good morning Master” Tony spoke barely above a whisper, ducking his head submissively. Steve paused, confusion mounting the longer the dark haired man stayed on the floor besides him.
“No offense sir, but you don’t even look like me. You are going to ask me questions about WWII as well, I take it," Steve looked the homeless person up and down. Well at least he had a job and he could get off the street soon.
“Take care of your boy Rogers, he needs you. Don’t worry about Clint he just needs some attention” Natasha smirked and she squeezed Rogers shoulder before heading to the elevator, “He should be careful what he asks for,” Natasha muttered darkly as the elevator doors closed.
“You will be hearing from me about this gross breach of protocol. I don’t care if you are a super soldier, do this again and your ass is mine Rogers!” Fury spat through the phone and connected the call with the nation of Wakanda. Steve let out a sigh of relief, maybe he could survive his heart attack after all.
Tony’s mouth was claimed by Steve’s dominating tongue and Steve’s scent caused his thoughts to grow hazy. Liquid fire bloomed in his core as Steve continued to conqueror his flesh. Tony simply held onto Steve as he drowned in his dom’s embrace, all previous commands were forgotten as he felt himself quickly approaching completion. Steve pressed Tony roughly against the side of the elevator, his mouth hotter than a brand against his. Tony forgot to breath as he felt himself being thrown over the cliff into oblivion as he came untouched with white blossoming behind closed eyes.
After waking up on ice, his world had remained a haze-unfocused even. Although he was able to perform his duties as Captain America, his personal life seemed to lack form and substance.
“Steve… you are kidding right? You called the national emergency line to cry about Tony? What the hell? Get it together!” Bucky barked at Steve.
This was his chance to finally confess his feelings to his omega. Sam kept telling him to ‘lock it down’ whatever that meant. Steve thought Unlocking it down would make more sense but he kept his opinion to his self.
Tony’s presence bathed everything around him in the light of warmth and perfection. Steve couldn’t think straight when Tony was near, words always falling through the cracks of his mind before they could reach his tongue.
“No one was offended Ton-sweetheart. You are very good, I just want to see your face. Can you come and sit up here with me?” Steve coaxed Tony. The sub sat for a moment before moving to peak over the table.
“Thanks for all of your help. I will remember my training,” Steve nodded at the commander. He waved as M’baku sauntered off, shaking the walls with the war chants of his people.
“Do not worry my brother. All things will work out in your favor. Just look at T’challa! He was drowning in denial and now- look! Finally got the girl,” M’baku grinned in between bites. He really like that lasagna.
T’challa was the best dressed fella in the northern hemisphere as far as Steve was concerned, and the elders of the Wakandan tribes approved his outfit too, which was a nice bonus.
Curious the Super-soldier took the letter and opened it, surprised that it was addresss to him. Steve squinted to make out the contents of the letter, chuckling because he recognized this horrible writing anywhere.
“No, I don’t think so…” Steve spoke softly, trying to sound hesitant and embarrassed. Steve barely suppressed a smirked when Sam and Bruce rolled their eyes at his antics.
“Tell me what the problem is soldier, I don’t have time to play messenger between you and your bestie. This phone is for national- no it's for WORLD emergencies!” Fury sounded…well, furious. Steve didn’t register the level of anger from the SHIELD leader as his world grew blurry.
“Follow me” Steve spoke over his shoulder before beckoning the dazed sub out of the elevator. Tony followed without hesitation.
“Is Natasha done with her Rut yet?” Steve blurted out and almost winced. He already knew the answer to that question, their argument still fresh in his mind.
Tony was good at teaching Steve, too. Helping him navigate the strange new world he had found himself in once they took him from the ice.
“Ah! I think I hurt my arm earlier” Steve faked, hoping Tony would lavish his arm with more attention.
Being raised an Alpha meant being taught control, well at least in Steve’s time. After being turned into a weapon of war, control was sewn into every fiber of his being. Precision was his specialty, and control came natural to him on the battlefield. But Tony was the sole source of his undoing, unmaking years of carefully learned discipline and restraint.
Steve fought the urge to block Bruce from Tony’s line of sight. Bruce knew he was bothering Steve which only made him smile wider. Steve rolled his eyes.
Tony had not approached Steve or said a word to him about it, and Steve was starting to get nervous. What if Tony had decided he was not the man for the job?
“You missed the meeting today. Everyone was concerned. So, I thought I would come by and make sure you are ok. Plus your lasagna is too good-oh! Praise be to Hanuman!” M’baku brought the whole pan of lasagna out of the fridge and placed it in the microwave.
The captain opened the door and immediately kneeled down to pet Dum-E on the head. He usually came to remind him of his milkshake appointment which Steve greatly appreciated.
After it let out a string of familiar beeps and clicks, Steve knew Dum-E was just fine. Steve placed the bot back on the ground and noticed that it had an envelope attached to it.
“I know, I am a genius. So what is the emergency? We are suiting up and ready to go, just give us the coordinates!” M’baku boomed from across the line.
“No, she’s still in the Red Room of Pain/Pleasure,” Sam said with a knowing look at Steve. Which Steve paid no mind to.
“Does this mean he’s not eating? Because I have been eyeing the last pancake for a while now” Clint teased licking his lips as his fork inched towards the lone pancake that had been saved for Tony. Natasha snatched Clint’s fork with a look before turning to Steve.
Tony’s scent spiked slightly, cutting through the space between them like a hot knife. Steve cracked the glass he had been washing for the past 30 minutes. That was the 5th glass this week.
“But Steve, this is mine,” Clint huffed. He clutched the mug that Tony had handed him earlier, after filling it with coffee. Why Tony felt the need to share their coffee and their mugs with other people was beyond Steve, but Steve was happy to correct his mate’s mistakes. Ecstatic even.
“Jarvis mentioned Tony had an episode last night, what did he mean by that?” Bruce interrupted Clint.
Steve’s ruts were becoming irregular and his instincts were eroding his control. Even now his Alpha instincts were a pounding drum vibrating every corner of his consciousness. He needed Tony to choose him so that he could have his sanity back.
“Rogers? I didn’t think you even knew how to use a phone. What’s wrong? Is it the Chitauri? Has Thanos made an appearance?” The concerned voice of Fury rang in his ear as it became harder to breathe. He could still hear the tinkling of Tony’s laugh from the other side of the room from where he lay slumped on the kitchen floor. True fear clenched in the super soldier’s gut.
“Sex what? What does being a beta have to do with anything?” Steve was stunned that after all his veiled threats, these grinning idiots hadn’t gotten the message that he wanted to be alone with his intended. How dare they talk about their sex lives when they were actively blocking his attempt at a sex life.
“And uh why don't YOU go away, Bruce?” Steve glared at the grinning scientist. Seeing the concern in his omega’s soft gaze he quickly coughed to cover his annoyance.
love you for other reasons, but yeah, mostly for your irony and the fact that all of the bathrooms have bidets.” Bruce smirked at Steve, which only caused Steve’s annoyance to reach new heights.
“Oh, me? I’m fine I just dropped something,” Steve sprang to his feet. ‘Yea nearly dropped my soul into the afterlife’ Steve thought shaking his head. Thankfully Tony saved him with his heavenly presence. Steve was so lucky to have him.
“Tell me that’s not the funniest thing you have ever heard Steve! I’ve been laughing for hours!” Tony wiped tears from his eyes, “The day that I see Brad Pitt try and school someone on WWII, Hollywood is too much!”
‘Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.' Steve quoted the Art of War to himself as the nearness of Tony threated to overwhelm his senses. He stared ahead, unseeing as his entire focus narrowed down to the mere centimeters that separated him and his mate. 15.5 to be exact.
Steve can’t quite pinpoint when things began to change between him and Tony, but what started off as misunderstandings and even eruptions of conflict, has over time become a close relationship. A relationship Steve was determined to make more intimate, and permanent. Steve always accomplished his goals.
“Just call him Tony Snark,” Sam’s voice cut through the fog in Steve’s mind. Everyone just stared at Sam while he chuckled at his own joke.
“You could say that, technically I am in New York right now. But there isn’t any enemy, well not an enemy of the Avengers. It's just Tony…” Steve trailed off as pain hit him in the chest again.
You have been enrolled in Sex Ed and will be getting a certification in all things Sexy sex educational…ly. The class will be taught by yours truly, I can assure you I am over qualified for the job and will be a wealth of knowledge. Class starts at 8:00AM PM tomorrow and I expect you ready and willing prepared. See you soon young padawan,
“Uh well, you see…last night I came to the kitchen to get a drink. I saw Tony had fallen asleep on the couch and he was crying out in his sleep. I went over to comfort him…I tried waking him up but it didn’t work…It must have been a very bad nightmare because I had to hold him through the rest of the night to get him to calm down…” Steve trailed off as he glanced down at Stark’s pliant form resting against his leg.
Tony holds his eyes, massaging the flesh he’s abused. Then his fingers curl around the back of Steve’s strings, pulling them back with his brow slightly raised at Steve, whose mouth falls open at the sensation of how the act is tightening the frontside of the underwear against his erection. Once he’s pulled it far enough Tony lets go of the fabric, and it hits against Steve’s skin, striking his balls painfully. Steve lets out a strained sound, unable to control how his ass rises up, offering itself.
They lay silently, basking in their closeness. Steve ends up massaging Tony’s prostate gently and Tony releases again inside of him at least twice, earning kisses to his forehead from the effort. By the time the knot finally subsides, Tony has turned completely into putty. Steve works him quickly ready again and then rides him slowly for almost two hours. They don’t talk much, just kiss and listen to each others breaths and moans. Neither of them cries anymore.
you, but you might lose your capability to conceive ever again. The other way – I can do that too, if you really are sure. But be aware that there’ll be a much higher chance of pregnancy than with a human, even with protection. Trust me, I’m speaking from experience.”
He quickly forgets the whole thing as the morning routine gets going; between making and drinking coffee Steve feeds, changes and dresses the twins. The babysitter insists on helping by making breakfast, and Steve doesn’t protest – it’s probably awkward for her to be at her workplace and just sit watching.
Without opening his eyes, Steve somewhat complied, lifting his hips shakily. Tony was pretty sure that the only reason Steve managed it at all was because it was familiar, because Tony had done this countless of times before. He did love it when he could tell that his cock was hitting Steve just right.
”How about shower?” he asks, praying that it won’t break this moment of peace they both need. Steve hums.
Tony follows him instantly, probably guessing the reaction his words have triggered. Steve registers him coming after him, but begins to just pull the drawers open frantically, looking for his razor. How doesn’t he even know where it is?
“Most uneventful, which I suppose I should be grateful for, but Hank was anxious that we might be beset by bandits. I find myself sorely disappointed on that case, not a highwayman in sight.” She sighs deeply, looking heartily disappointed. “No adventure at all. I like the countryside as much as anyone, but several hours in a carriage gets very tedious without something to break it up.” She looks very put out at the inconvenience of not being inconvenienced. Steve can’t help a small laugh at her expression.
“I invited him to see my sketches,” Steve says. That surely should not be taken the wrong way. Sam blinks.
“Quality stands the test of time, sir. Now, if you wouldn’t mind handing all your bags and valuables out of the carriage for me. I’d hate to shoot such a beautiful face.”
He stares at the words, willing the swoop of the upstrokes to change, but it remains, stubbornly, Sir Anthony’s handwriting.
Steve freezes, thinking of that empty door. Sir Anthony cannot know - can he? He left the shooting party early after all. He might.
“If Fury had actually shared his reasoning behind tha-,” Steve cuts himself off. This is no time to go over old arguments. He turns to stare at the painting above the fireplace, though that hardly helps his mood. The battlefield it shows is merely another reminder of what may be on the horizon. He glares at it. He will take it down tomorrow, he does not know why he has let it stay up so long. He tears his gaze away from it and back to the conversation. “That will serve as proof enough, I suppose it must.” He sighs. “Though one day he may need to let that go.” He turns to Sam, who is looking amused with the whole situation, glancing between Mrs Romanoff and Steve with the air of an avid spectator.
Finally footsteps come again and Steve looks down to see Mr Jarvis mounting the stairs towards him again.
. The Living Hero of the Hydra War. We used to hear about you, how many Hydra strongholds you had taken, every valiant victory, leading the way. We heard about the last fight too. How it was all nearly lost, how you still won through. I toasted in your name that night, we all did. You won the war for us. You let us go home.” Steve opens his mouth, but Sam won’t let him. “No. Just listen. You don’t understand how
It is taken as given that he is looking to marry and, while Steve has tried to deter them, it is difficult to comment without insulting someone. Sam, on the other hand, seems to be enjoying the attention, though he shows no partiality for anyone.
He can’t help but remember Sam’s words from their previous discussion. He searches Sir Anthony’s face for any sort of sign that he is less than genuine. He sees nothing, but there is still that shard of doubt in him now.
Sam had had a point. There is no way Steve can search every traveller and cart on the Brooklyn road.
“What other route?” the woman asks. “This is the only road and you know it. I’m not about to trek across the hills when there’s a perfectly good road here for us. It’s not like we have anything of value on us anyway. We’re not what he’s looking for.”
“That too, but that isn’t what I meant,” Penelope says. “I meant that he is the most incorrigible flirt.” Steve clears his throat.
In spite of Steve, they manage to get the house up and running and Steve finds himself the master of a comfortable home and in unexpected possession of several acres of land.
He feels like the world is removed from him, like a window stands between him and it. The letter sits in his hand and the words are still there, but the knowledge of it is far away from him.
, and he freezes instantly. He turns to see Rebecca Barnes standing in the hall, her hair coming loose as it has always done, her teeth worrying her lip. “Did he…” she starts. “Was it… Did he suffer, in the end?”
“I thought we talked about this, Tony. You need to be more discreet with these sorts of things. After what happened with Miss Potts-”
Neither of the men is wearing any sort of insignia on their uniforms. If this is a black site, some CIA hideout where they torture prisoners, or worse, then he’s pretty sure he’s screwed.
That was yesterday. So tonight Steve’s taking things into his own hands. He’s fully expecting to walk around a dusty, broken down old military base for the night. The biggest risk will probably be tetanus. Luckily his vaccines are up to date.
He remembers that same voice scolding him for stealing a cookie from the kitchen when he was a boy. Now he is taller than her, his head having to duck under the low door frame to get in. He feels caught off balance. Of all places in the world, this one should be familiar to him, but it still feels alien.
He takes advantage of the guards’ distraction to dive for cover under the nearest bench, beneath the flickering images of his own and Peggy’s faces. He wraps his arms over his head and curls into a ball. He doesn’t know if it will do any good, but it’s better than doing nothing.
Sir Anthony Stark is the traitor. He is leaking his own designs to Hydra, helping them prepare for a new war.
“One day, young man, you’ll be getting letters from your sweetheart and we’ll all giggle at you,” the little boy’s great grandmother says.
He has been there for two weeks, and feels as though he has spent most of those in the library, when the letter catches up with him, redirected in the neat hand of his landlady.
“It’s been a pleasure!” he says. Then, before Tony can say anything in response, he pulls back, plants his feet firmly on the step of the carriage and uses it to push himself into a spinning vault over the heads of the shocked travellers.
“That's what everyone does,” she gestures to the dancers. “The baronet, you’ll agree, is very accomplished at it.”
The blanket of the cloud below them glows golden and green, spreading out softly. It is as though the clouds themselves are lit up from the inside. Steve’s breath catches in his chest at the sight of it, the sea of light.
“That is not what I said,” Steve says quickly. His words had been awkward, yes, but he had not been that discourteous.
“Is this… are you a highwayman?” the driver asks, sounding incredulous. “I thought you guys were extinct.”
Before he goes, he grabs Tony’s hand and bows as he raises it to his lips, keeping his eyes on Tony’s the whole time.
“I think it’s a distinct possibility,” Mrs Romanoff says. “We can deliver this if you-” she reaches for the diagram.
Like sneaking out in the middle of the night, changing Liberty’s markings with the soot bucket and riding out to lie in wait.
“What’s that- ?” he starts, then his eyes widen and he looks at Steve, who shifts a little uncomfortably under his gaze. The salute Barton gives then is almost smart, and Steve thinks the man definitely served in the army for some time, although it's too slapdash for him to have been a dedicated soldier. Steve tries to smile at him.
“Sorry to cut this short,” Steve says, putting his pistol away. “I wish I could say it had been a pleasure.”
“Captain Rogers!” Ms Van Dyne’s voice comes from his right and he turns to her with a genuine smile. “As I perceive the rubber has finished, might I steal you away, for there is some business I wish to discuss with you.”
He handles every single one of them with care and consideration, talking to each one as though it is a favoured child, calling for Steve to come and see them. Steve watches as the horses are paraded out in the ring, and notes which seem splayfooted, and which might overreach themselves a little.
“How-” he starts, but then bites his tongue. He does not know the man well enough for such a personal question.
and a rumbling scraping sound as he pulls. Steve steps back in amazement as the whole bookshelf moves smoothly out and slides to the side. He stares in astonishment. Behind the bookcase there is no wall, but instead a darkened room. He grabs an oil lamp from the side and steps in.
And then the pair are gone, out into the night, leaving Steve’s mind swimming with more questions than he had had before.
“Based in truth,” Sir Anthony says, waving a finger at her. “There was a highwayman who operated in the area during the worst of the magic purges. The Dark Avenger, they called him, I've seen the warrant written for his arrest, signed by the king, but the part about him rescuing his lover and dying in the attempt is a fanciful embellishment, I’m afraid. As far as I know, he evaded capture until The Purge was ended and then probably lived out a long and unremarkable life. I sincerely doubt his ghost haunts the road.”
“You have been a thorn in our side for many years, Steve Rogers,” Zola says. On the screens around the centre - where Zola’s face still hangs, disembodied and pixellated - images flash of people Steve recognises, headlines he knows. They are cases he had investigated, crimes he had uncovered, CEOs he had brought down, people he had saved. There are articles from his blog as well. The contaminated drug he had stopped. The embezzlement he had uncovered. Steve stares. Zola is implying that all of those were connected? That someone organised them. That
The Wilson family is sad to see Sam go, and Steve cannot doubt their sincerity when they express regrets over his leaving as well. Their welcome has been a warm one and he is honoured that they have accepted him so generously. This is what he fought for, he reminds himself.
“Captain Rogers,” he says without turning around. Steve drags his eyes away from the way the damp shirt clings to the muscles of Sir Anthony’s back and down to the papers on the nearest work surface, weighed down by a handful of delicate looking gears. They appear to be designs for some sort of cannon, the like of which Steve has never seen before.
As the rubble settles, Steve sticks his head out cautiously, and through the clouds of dust that start to tickle and choke at his throat.
“Liberty is more than enough for my needs,” Steve says, patting her neck as though Sir Anthony’s words will hurt her feelings. “I need no carriage.” She knickers quietly and endures his petting good-naturedly.
He punches the screen before he realises what he’s doing. Pain explodes in his hand - glass shatters and connections spark.
“I’m glad to hear it,” Steve says with a nod. “I shall be on my way then. Thank you for your consideration in seeing me to the door.”
“You’re not scaring my guests with ghost stories again, are you, Jan?” Sir Anthony asks. He has a fond smile on his face and a drink in his hand.
“So soon?” Steve asks, unable to quite keep the disappointment out of his voice. The music has been wonderful, but they have had no chance to talk, and he wishes that they could.
He discusses events with Sam over breakfast, ensuring the servants are out of earshot first. Sam has no better ideas than him.
For anyone else, the noise and hubbub of the gathering would drown out the fainter sounds from the balcony, but Steve’s hearing is acute and he can still make out Mr Stane’s voice.
“I’m glad he has been so solicitous of your needs,” Mr Stane says and somehow the words are made oily as they leave his lips, dripping from his mouth.
The elevator stops and the doors slide open, revealing a room full of computers. Steve looks around at them. They look older than he is. He’s never seen anything like it outside of a historical drama. Dozens of old CRT monitors, all facing inwards, as though meant to be seen by one person. His friend Scott, who helps him with the website and with his less… legal research, has a set up with three screens, but this is way beyond that.
The food is simple and filling, if a little bland, and the company is good. Crowded into the small, smokey taproom, it reminds him of other places and other people. Steve half expects to feel Dum Dum’s hand slap him on the back or hear Morita arguing with the barkeep. He swallows down his resentment and listens to Sam describe the antics he got up to as a midshipman on a flying vessel.
“I had thought I would be guiding you in this,” Sir Anthony says with a delighted laugh. “But I’m not surprised that you should want a more difficult horse.”
“Perhaps I could have your honesty then, as you will not take mine,” and he turns to the picture he was painting. “I feel like the perspective is all wrong, and I have not done any justice to the gardens. What is your opinion on the matter?”
The ship is on course for Brooklyn. The war is over. He should feel relief. The airshipmen around him are all going home.
Sure, the sketch he’s doing of the Avengers, he’s been drawing Iron Man’s arm for about twenty minutes, but Bucky can’t see his sketchbook.
“Naturally,” Tony says, with a flash of a brittle grin. “I imagine it is difficult to find someone whose perfection matches your own.”
Steve knows he should invite the Barnes family to visit. It is abominable manners that he has not yet done so, but he can never bring himself to finish the invitation whenever he begins it. He has wasted reams of paper in such fashion.
He goes through the steps as best he can, one by one, all the while he knows he is stiff and wooden, like a tailor’s dummy, but Mrs Romanoff keeps up the conversation, asking him how he is enjoying the area, how he is settling in.
He reaches out to unfasten the flap of the bag and slowly lifts it, carefully splaying the bag open with a finger and thumb.
Steve’s never seen the suit this close before, well, not for more than a few seconds at a time. He’s drawn it, though. Doodles at the side of his notebook, the occasional bigger sketch. The lines of it are fascinating. The way it moves is… Steve’s attention is dragged away from Iron Man by new noises: voices shouting, the stomp of running boots. It’s muffled, but definitely there. More guards are on their way.
It is not only the housekeeper, but also Rick, the valet, Delilah the maid, and a handful of other servants, who all seem to have separate, but very important jobs that Steve has never really considered before.
Steve frowns. He would not have thought that coming up with a name would be the most difficult part of this.
“Mother always says that whoever he does marry in the end will want for nothing but a husband,” Penelope says before making her bid. The comment earns her a daring giggle from Mr Moore on her left.
“Glad to hear that my hospitality is not quite as terrible as Hydra’s,” Sir Anthony replies. “But do try to enjoy yourself. It is not good for my ego to have a handsome young captain out of sorts at one of my soirees.”
“I would ask you not to spread such scurrilous rumours,” Steve says firmly. “The baronet’s reputation-”
“Perhaps the same thing,” Sam suggests, spreading butter liberally onto his toast. “As you said, it is unlikely that the two are unconnected, but perhaps the connection is not what you think.”
It shows the fine and detailed diagram of an airship, unlike any airship Steve has seen before, more streamlined, and with an engine at the back that looks like something from a dream - or a nightmare. Steve stares at it. The writing, he does not need to question, it is undeniably Sir Anthony’s: tiny, precise script with measurements and explanations and equations that Steve can only half understand, covering it, describing every inch of the airship.
“Wrong there, Rogers. I am actually here to tell you about WWII. I am a Hollywood veteran, we have our own version of the events of WWII,” Brad smirked at the confused super soldier.
Tony’s bots came to visit him sometimes, which Tony complained about with jealousy. It always made Steve smile.
Steve hadn’t had a sub in literally decades…less alone a “Slave”. The young captain found himself shifting from panicked to terrified. What if he hurt Tony on accident? How would he be able to face his teammates if something bad happened?
“Hey Sam. Hey Bruce.” Steve said over his shoulder as Natasha and Clint slunk out of the room behind Tony. Steve’s instincts screamed to demand everyone leave so he could scent his omega in peace but he ignored them, for now.
So when he demanded that his teammates hand over all of Tony’s things, he didn’t understand why they were making a big deal out of it.
Steve continued to analyze the conversation he had with Tony as the week stretched on. It had been a few days since Steve had feigned ignorance of the sexual aspects of the secondary genders and Tony still had not followed up with him.
Bucky didn’t have a strong opinion, which did not  surprise Steve because the guy had been wearing the same outfit for the past 3 movies. Steve prayed that the Wakandan sense of style would rub off on the winter soldier.
“Everything is going to be just fine ok? Be a good boy for Steve” Nat spoke softly before placing an affectionate kiss on Tony’s forehead. Tony blushed and smiled at the sign of affection. Natasha quickly rose and turned to Steve.
“Steve? What is going on, what happened this time? Is it New York?” Bucky spoke over the loud sirens in the background.
So Steve ignored his teammates and continued to wash dishes to ignore the gravitational pull he felt towards his omega. Steve knew he had to be strategic in capturing his prize, and he could exercise patience. Barely.
“Master they haven’t asked permission to speak to me, what is it that you want me to do” Tony looked up to Steve briefly before quickly casting his eyes down again. Steve found himself at a loss for words.
Steve had always felt like he had taken a piece of ice with him when they brought him back, he would feel it lodged inside him at times, concrete and unshakable. Tony had slowly begun to melt the glacier, and sometimes Steve feared he would drown in what was left behind.
Time had stopped being meaningful after the serum, however for the first time in his life he felt lost, floating without direction. Steve was a soldier and had studied war even before the serum.
“Step one- get off your ass. Step two- walk said ass over to Tony. Step three- ask Tony out on a date-- USE YOUR WORDS! Step four- do not contact me again until steps 1-3 are accomplished, in order. This has been the 5th false alarm this week, Rogers!” Bucky growled with annoyance that went completely unnoticed by Steve.
“You have got to be kidding me! What is next, my clothes? Get ahold of yourself Rogers," Clint shoved the mug in Steve’s hand and stomped out of the room. Steve froze in shock. Clothes?
“Um… what? Wade, how did you even get in here,” Steve watched the strange character do a ballet routine around the room. “Do we even have a pool?”
Steve look up from the letter with a distinct feeling that he was missing some things. His Tony sure was a funny fella. Steve put the letter in his chest where he keeps all of the things he has gotten from Tony… well, gotten back for Tony in Clint’s case. He planned on giving it to him as a wedding gift. Steve knew he would love it.
“Tony buddy, you sure you don’t want to sit at the table? I may just do the unforgivable and finish all the coffee,” Bruce asked playfully glancing under the table but Tony remained silent.
“Of pleasure, then,” Steve said simply and let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. Tony was still paying attention to him and his friends hadn't ruined everything with their presence.
“It sounds like subdrop. We haven’t really seen Tony submit to…well anyone. We don’t know the last time he was with a Dom.” Natasha stated.
“You know, I thought Black Panther was supposed to get married to Storm,” Deadpool waltzed in the room wearing an inflatable flamingo pool toy, “At least that's what the comic books say. But since we are in an AU, I guess that works.”
The super soldier let out a big sigh and fixed the bow tie around his neck for the hundredth time. After a video conference with Bucky-which turned into a video conference with T’Challa and half of Wakanda- He had decided to wear a tuxedo and a bow tie.
The slave would give absolute submission to their “Master”, putting a lot of responsibility on the Master. Steve didn’t know if he should feel honored or terrified.
Steve almost fell to his knees as Tony’s words struck him like a blow. Steve gripped the kitchen counter for dear life. He couldn’t hear anything else Tony was saying over the rushing in his ears, even though he could see his mouth moving.
Tony also taught Steve how beautiful his eyes looked when the omega was smiling or laughing. How warm and heady Tony’s scent was and how plush and pink his lips were. Steve learned all the perfect things that made Tony, well… Tony. And Steve wanted to learn Tony for the rest of their lives.
“Steve what exactly is going on between you two?” Natasha raised an eyebrow as Steve continued to look down at Tony in confusion. “Tony’s behavior is extremely odd even for him”
While Steve was reluctant to admit it, his rocky relationship with Tony helped give him focus. When he began to give his interactions with Tony his full attention, and recognize his emotions were something more than his vocabulary could give meaning to, things began to change.
Ever since that time, Tony was under the impression that Steve needed the milkshakes for his fast metabolism. But it was truly that Steve just really liked them. Now almost every day, Tony made Steve a milkshake.
“Sorry about your situation. Here is something to hold you over until you can get back on your feet, Good luck with everything!” Steve patted Mr. Brad on his shoulder and ran after Tony. His omega was so fast, if he blinked he would lose track of him.
“Whelp me and Cap have a date, I actually have to teach him something completely different and hopefully more…stimulating. You will have to come back another time.” Tony dismissed the actor, walking past him and motioning for Steve to follow.
Steve nearly leaped out of the elevator and made a beeline for the kitchen. It was nearly empty except for his wonderful omega-to-be and a homeless man who looked lost. Tony had such a big heart to help those in need. When Jarvis was feeling cheeky, he would allow random people into the Tower that Tony had to politely escort out. Cute.
Steve was not prone to hyperbole, and he was by no means exaggerating about Tony’s Milkshakes. They were earth shattering. The perfect consistency of creamy and coolness, every milkshake had its unique blend of flavors that Tony made up on the spot.
‘Either tell Tony how you feel, or we will do it for you.’ Coulson snapped his hands at him which only made steve want to roll his eyes.
“What? T-Tony are you sure?” Steve responded suddenly hoarse as his throat felt thick with emotion. It was rare to use a name, especially your dom’s name, as a safeword. It signified a deep level of trust and even deeper level of affection. Steve stared at the sub in shock, all words evaporating on his tongue.
Steve didn’t like vague Jarvis, that never turned out good for him in the long run. Steve frowned as he peered into the empty biohazard box. Huh. Steve opened his mouth to ask where his milkshake was when he heard a loud slurping sound followed by the tinkling of Tony’s laugh that always made the room seem brighter.
As they had been speaking, Steve had tried to get closer, but the walls of the courtyard and the echo had made it impossible to get a fix on where the pair were. Their voices seemed to come from a different direction depending on where he stood.
“Of course you would not be so inconstant, Captain,” Penelope says, looking across to Steve through lowered eyelashes. “I cannot believe you would ever jilt someone you professed to care about.”
He wants to punch something, but there is nothing around to fight. Instead he balls his hands into fists.
It may be that thought which distracts him that night, or perhaps he has just grown too comfortable with the system he has developed. He should know better. Complacence is a surefire way to die. It goes wrong from the beginning.
But Steve is not facing Hydra this time. He is facing civilians. They may carry a couple of pistols, but it is unlikely he will get any significant opposition as long as he keeps away from military convoys.
“I’m not the one who keeps sleeping until noon. Perhaps you should bed down with the horses yourself.”
The place is dark, everyone seeming to be asleep, as he creeps up through the gardens towards it. He is in his Nomad costume, for lack of anything better to wear, because it is better to be seen as Nomad at a distance returning such things than seen as Steve Rogers. There are already enough questions.
Yeah, Steve is starting to think his mystery tip-off was on to something. It’s just a pity Steve might be dead before he gets a chance to tell anyone about it. He’d managed to hit Record on his phone before they grabbed him and took his stuff, but that only helps if he gets out of here. Preferably in one piece. His two new friends don’t seem like that is their preferred option.
“In my experience, that is not true,” Steve says, “I have met many wealthy men and there were few - if any - who would have given a humble soldier even a fraction of what you have given me.”
“Tony, my boy,” Mr Stane calls, his voice booming jovially. Sir Anthony’s softer look falls away and he straightens up again to turn and smile at Obadiah Stane. Steve takes a moment to neaten himself up again.
Steve pulls himself to his feet, still in the shadow of Iron Man’s imposing form, and takes a couple of deep, careful breaths. He can make this. He has to make it. He can hear the strain in Iron Man’s voice. He won’t be able to take the onslaught for much longer, and those Hydra guns are doing more damage than Steve had thought possible. If Steve can just cut them off, then he and Iron Man will have time to get out of here.
Steve had not brought his pistols. Had not considered them necessary for this task. He is regretting that now, while he wouldn’t shoot a man who is merely protecting his master’s property, he would like to at least have the subterfuge.
“Then of course, you must go,” Steve agrees. “I am sorry to have kept you playing. But time seems to have flown past.”
Colonel Danvers seizes the change in subject with enthusiasm as Colonel Rhodes protests Tony’s accusations. The cheer is a little forced, but it does the trick. The conversation becomes lively again as Colonel Danvers leaps into a tale. Steve is called upon several times to defend the army’s honour, but he is sorely outnumbered, even when Tony declares that he will take his side, to even the odds just a little.
The man provides some small cushion for Steve’s fall, but he himself is not so lucky and Steve hears the cry of pain and the crack of something breaking. Steve does not think it is a branch.
“I still say we should have found another route,” one of them says. “I’ve no interest in meeting a highwayman.”
The truth is that he hasn’t been able to sleep properly since he returned. His sleep is fitful, shattered by nightmares. He does not need much, these days, which is fortunate. But he would appreciate one night where he wasn’t awoken in the dark by the echoes of screams and the scent of death in his nostrils, choking him.
There’s something on the wall. A metal panel with what looks like a button and a keyhole. He cranes his neck to see what’s written underneath it.
this hero, you’re good and honest and sometimes it’s physically painful standing next to you because you’re just too much, but then you do something like this-”
“I don't know the people in question,” Steve says, “but you are yourself just returned from town. How was the journey?” His attempt to change the subject is transparent and clumsy. To someone like Ms Van Dyne, who has been a part of society for years, it must be painful to witness, but she goes along with it without batting an eyelid.
“It’s certainly his handwriting,” she says. “And his paper. But… if someone could have gained access to his plans, they could have gained access to anything else he has written as well.” She runs her finger along the feathery edge where the paper is torn. “This may have been part of a longer message that was torn away. We have no way of knowing. Your investigations have hardly been subtle.”
“Who else has access to his designs?” Steve says, he feels almost too ready to jump on any possibility that Sir Anthony is not the traitor. He hopes that his regard for the baronet is not clouding his mind. He must resolve to be objective in this matter.
Seven years ago, when got his friend Scott to help him set up two websites, Steve hadn’t been expecting either of them to take off. He had figured that the webcomic would maybe get a handful of views and a couple of comics. The blog had really been more for him. His friends were getting sick of listening to his commentary on social injustice and someone - Steve thinks it was Peggy - had suggested he take his opinions online.
“I’d prefer to send it on myself,” Steve says, pulling it back towards himself. He may believe that they are working for Fury, but that doesn’t mean he trusts them. Mrs Romanoff appears amused by him.
“Now that was rude,” Iron Man says, although his voice doesn’t sound right anymore. It sounds less machine and more man. He raises his hand and the blast of white light hits the final gunman in the chest, sending him flying back into the wall, where his head hits metal and he slides down to the ground. Iron man turns around and-
“My favourite kind of question,” Tony replies. He spreads his hands wide, a grin on his face. “Ask whatever you want, Captain Rogers. I am an open book to you.”
“I’d apologise,” Steve says. “But my ma always told me that an insincere apology was worse than saying nothing at all. And I feel like disappointing you is probably something to be proud of.”
“Your dedication to his safety is commendable,” Steve replies. “It must be difficult to sort out the innocent from those whose intentions are fuelled by self-interest.”
There are another two travellers that night and Steve hurries back under the cover of darkness, taking the secret passageway back up to the secret room.
Steve heads out that night on Liberty, her white blaze blackened with the soot, and takes one of his accustomed positions.
But it’s been a long week and Bucky has a date, so Steve is counting on him being more concerned with not messing that up than what Steve’s up to.
The omega purred into his ear keenly as Tony caressed him, and gradually, Tony could feel strength returning to his limbs after sleep and blood beginning to flow towards his crotch as his body remembered its programming.
The therapist leans back, writing something down. Steve’s gotten used to her doing that, and doesn’t usually mind it, but now he feels like he’s said something wrong.
”If I knew, I wouldn’t say”, Steve tells him in a final tone. It’s most definitely not for him to share.
But of course Tony’s not going to do that. He pushes his chair back, standing up, and Steve looks at him, realising the effect his words have had.
Steve walked to him. ”There’s no milk”, he stated. He could guess Tony’s fake argument right away when he heard him open his mouth. ”
“This is what I wanted to show you”, he says, turning his eyes back to Steve’s face. “You’re like art, honey.”
”But I don’t know if Tony’s gone or not”, he says, grimacing at the way his lower stomach spasms. His forehead is drenched in cold sweat, and he wipes it with his sleeve.
Tony always used that word. According to him, Steve was perfect, and it didn’t matter that Steve himself saw everything but perfection when he looked at himself. That was what Tony called him; time after time, year after year, again and again. Even after how Steve had once hurt him, after everything that they’d been through.
A couple of phone calls eventually lead Tony into a storage facility where a brown van stands abandoned. After studying the machine inside he quickly traces its controls to the front, and then it happens.
He’s sad, but doesn’t completely perceive the reason for it at the moment. Everything is a blur, there’s just the heat and the need to be knotted, and as soon as his breath steadies a little, he starts another round with the toy.
”You don’t know how much I love you”, he says, and it shatters Tony because his voice is desperate like he actually believes it.
”Anywhere. Just please don’t stop”, Steve answers, and Tony doesn’t think he’s seen Steve quite this open with his pain after that night they first had sex after their break up one and a half years ago.
I probably make it sound worse than it is, but I do find this to be the darkest moment in AMG, and we know that it hasn't exactly been fluff and sugar this far. That said, there's a lot of love and even sweetness mixed in there too. I feel quite nervous about this chapter, and I can only hope that the reason why I chose to write a chapter like this comes across clearly enough.
been over a month since the last time. Tony’s body is acutely aware of these facts even with all the grief he carries with him now. Perhaps even more because of it – it’s no small comfort to be able to concentrate on something else for a while. Booze and fucking had always been Tony’s weapons of choice for escaping himself, after all. But this is not that, at least not just that. It’s the realisation that Steve is still here to touch him so softly like this that makes the sorrow fade into the distance in this moment.
AC/DC: Hells Bells. Tony would seethe if he wasn’t preoccupied by his head aching like it was just hit with the fore-mentioned bells. FRIDAY knows very well that him passing out is a sign for her to turn off the music from the workshop, so she must’ve left it on on purpose, as a protest no doubt. Tony’s having serious questions about the programming of her empathy.
”So pretty”, Tony smiles at him frailly, laying his hand over the one Steve has circled around himself, coaxing his strokes, and that finally sends Steve over the edge, crying out as long, white streaks of come coat Tony’s stomach, chest, neck and even his chin. He vaguely registers Tony humming at him appreciatively, his hand still clinging to his as Steve lets go of his cock. He pulls Steve’s trembling body gently into an embrace, Steve following the motion pliantly.
”Don’t look so disappointed, sweetie”, Tony tells him briskly, his fingers admiring the leather of the whip, and Steve forces his face to go back to neutral. It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy whipping, it’s just that he needs Tony inside of him like yesterday.
Tony’s fingers pressed hard into Steve’s skin as he began to finally thrust without restraint, his mouth watering at the wet, slapping sounds it produced.
He sighs through his nose, trying to make it quiet to not bother Steve and Emmett. Well, mostly Steve. The omega has an uncanny habit of reacting to even the slightest metaphorical pea under Tony’s mattress by waking up to check on him. When Tony’s stressed, the limbo of them both continuously waking up makes their nights often abrupt and unrestful. During Ultron, Tony even tried sleeping on the sofa to not wake Steve up all the time, but it was even worse. Steve still woke up, the only difference being that he’d lie awake debating whether to come check on Tony or not, unable to fall asleep again. So, it’s better like this. Besides, Tony hates sleeping without Steve, and Steve seems to hate sleeping without him even more if possible.
Happy has put his camera on, and Kieran is there, on the screen. Alive. His wide eyes are staring a little past the camera at Happy. He’s got some of his tiny fingers shoved into his mouth, and when Tony calls out his name, he smiles around them.
The therapist also tells him that beating himself up about it isn’t productive. Steve understands that, sure, one didn’t have to have a psychology degree to get that, but it’s easier said than done.
It wasn’t a surprise, as Steve was very sensitive to marking even when not in heat; a couple of times, Tony had managed to make him come just from that alone. Still, most of Tony’s attention went to self-control in that moment as he didn’t want to draw blood but couldn’t make himself tore his teeth away either. For a while it was just Steve trembling against him as he snarled from between his teeth, trying to remind himself to breathe. It took a few breaths, but eventually Tony relaxed and let go, beginning to lick the mark he’d made.
”Relief”, Steve admits. ”A year is a long time to wait for another chance. A lot of things can change in a year.”
”I love you”, Tony has said before he even realises. He kisses Steve’s jaw, his throat. ”I love you. I love you. I love you.” He wipes the tear off of Steve’s face, smiling at him. ”I love you.”
After they’ve eaten, they lean against the railing, watching the city at night from the roof, listening to the busy yet somehow comfortable blend of noises. Tony presses his side closer to Steve as he points out a building.
He eventually did and Steve sank his cock deeper inside of him. After another brief moment, he experimentally thrusted a little, and that’s when a reminder growl escaped Tony.
Tony’s fingers fuck his mouth lazily, his finger pads pressing lightly against his tongue, molding his lower lip out of shape as they draw out and then back in again as Steve sucks them, blinking at his own reflection.
They hadn’t yet had sex after Tony’s return to home, and as it was, Tony’s words held some truth; Steve had missed his alpha very much. There wasn’t a reason why they couldn’t have sex as far as they’d be mindful of Tony’s arm either, but right now the older man seemed mostly sleepy despite his suggestion.
”Tony”, Steve chides his language lamely, a lopsided smile creeping onto his own face too. ”But, yeah, what your father said.”
”Steve”, Tony’s voice calls tightly, then, and Steve’s gaze meets his briefly before landing on the phone Tony’s showing to him.
”It was supposed to be a joke. My bad. I keep forgetting your, uh, situation.” He sounds slightly nervous and Steve gives him a reassuring smile. ”This is not AC/DC, to be clear, it’s Art Tatum actually. Never-mind.”
”A barren omega you can’t even knot?” Steve’s tone isn’t accusatory, but Tony still feels a sting in his chest. Once again, he wishes he could’ve been there for Steve.
Steve registers it when Tony goes out, but he doesn’t have time to think about it. Thanos is trying to jam the Stormbreaker into Thor’s chest and looking an alarmingly lot like he’s going to succeed, and Steve’s eyes catch Thor’s hammer. Desperately, he goes for it, his only thought being that Thor needs to have his hammer right now.
”What’s up, Kitty? What are you so worried about now, buddy?” he asks briskly, starting to bounce the baby in his arms. He grins at the way Steve and Peter are both struggling to find words.
As Tony lies back down, Steve stretches lazily, and Tony finds it endearing. Steve is always so fixed on the kids, their schedule and every little thing in their lives: from knowing every toy by the name to remembering whose parents are who. He has dental appointments pressed into memory, knows when it’s one of their friend’s birthday and what to get them, can tell from the colour which socks are whose – if the twins have the same pair, he’s usually still able to tell by the
”Tony – alpha – please”, Steve begs in between, and Tony’s body agrees with the urgency in his voice. He moves to open Steve’s trousers, pulling all of the layers off without much finesse, and then shrugs his own shirt off.
When Steve felt the digit draw a line down the crack of his ass, he struggled to keep still, his breath turning short. Tony watched him, eyes fixed to his, and when the finger prodded against Steve’s rim, Steve let out the breath he’d been holding with a whine.
”Steve told me about what you had discussed here. Guess you could say that I didn’t take it very well. We had an argument and I felt like I needed some time alone. Sort of a, uh, ”clear-my-head” type of solution.”
”Yeh, ’ir”, he struggles, drool dripping down his jaw despite his efforts. His eyes land on Tony’s cock again, and he can’t not look at it, the way it’s moving, the tip of it vanishing between his pecs and Tony’s hand and appearing again in a steady rhythm, making slick noises against his wet chest. Steve’s hips want to move in rhythm with it even if they have nothing to gain from it, and he can’t stop them from pushing into the air uselessly.
Mind you, Bad Medicine isn’t really an unfunny song, but FRIDAY’s ruined it for Tony now. Bon Jovi fades away and 80’s pop tunes blast out of the speakers, Tony recognising the song as Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance with Somebody. After a quick recap of the lyrics in his mind, Tony finds himself content with the choice. He starts moving – not exactly dancing, more like trotting around the workshop with his bottle along a choreography written by a toddler.
After they get to the medical bay, a lot of things happen. Tony’s put on an IV drip and his pupils, temperature and blood pressure are checked amongst other tests. He’s checked for injuries. Bruce and the two nurses they’ve got left bustle around Tony, and Steve stands in the side, following closely that they don’t overwhelm or hurt his alpha.
”You’re good, Steve. You’re perfect for me”, he whispers. A little sound escapes Steve. ”Does it hurt?”
Thor lets go of him and seems to contemplate his next move for a second before pulling Steve into a hug. Steve would be unable to resist even if he wanted to, but he doesn’t want to. He buries his face into Thor’s hoodie, his sobs getting more and more loud.
On Tuesday evening Steve comes to a breaking point. Feeling like he needs to talk or he’ll lose it he calls his therapist. It’s not an easy thing to press her name on the contact list, but he tells himself that he has to try his everything to manage, for Kieran and Emmett. For himself, too.
He loathed soy milk. He knew that everything was supposed to be about saving the climate now, including drinking coffee, but after being hungry and poor all of his childhood, giving up animal fats now that there was no shortage of them admittedly didn’t hold much appeal. He’d done his best to adjust, but his super soldier body also needed the protein to remain strong enough to save the world from other kinds of dangers.
Blood was rushing loudly in Tony’s ears, and he had to spend many long seconds to make sure he wasn’t going to pass out. God, he was going to slap Steve’s face off the minute he could move. At least he hadn’t slumped on top of Tony like a piece of shit after his orgasm.
”Mine”, Tony repeated, a groan following. ”Mine, fuck, Steve – my gorgeous omega”, he went on almost desperately, watching how Steve panted hard. ”You’ll be so beautiful.”
Personally Steve didn’t mind at all; he liked holding Tony close during the nights, the memory of watching his helpless, unresponsive mate in life support for two weeks that had felt like two years still fresh in his mind. Steve knew that Tony didn’t want to be babied and he tried his best not to do that, but it was hard when he still felt like bursting into tears multiple times a day just at the sight of Tony. The sight of him alive and home.
“Y-yes”, Steve managed, and then Tony was sliding into him and he was wailing, clawing the desk underneath him.
”Good.” Tony’s own voice sounds out of breath. His lips find Steve’s, and then Steve’s coming, crying out into the kiss, and Tony doesn’t pull back. Instead he breathes it in, soaking it inside of him, his eyes fixed on Steve’s face until he’s coming too. He bites Steve’s lower lip, his frantic moans muffling against it. For a few seconds, neither of them remembers the pain.
Tony smiles against Steve’s shoulder blade. His omega had had his first sexual experience with another person at the tender age of 27, so Tony guesses that it’s only logical that he should fall into a baby fever at that of 40.
Very unlike Tony, Steve thinks. Tony doesn’t really snore except when he’s been drinking, but he stresses in his sleep, his rolling and grunting making Steve often wake up worried.
Steve breathes out, tears threatening to spill from his eyes. ”Of course I love you”, he retorts, frustrated.
Nat’s brought some snacks and drinks, and she places them onto the nightstand. She also has a black plastic box that she sets to the floor discreetly, next to the bed. Steve eyes it with disdain, guessing it’s toys. He doesn’t want to ask.
Tony sighs. There is no correct answer to this; the truth is that while it obviously wouldn’t have made him exactly happy,
Not that Tony was capable of noticing, but his weight didn’t much bother Steve, whose breathing was blissfully heavy under him. For a long moment, they were both just lost in the completeness of the feeling, of Tony’s knot securing the seed inside.
Tony growls quietly around his bite, and Steve is hard-coded to show submission. He goes limp like a puppet cut from its strings, a surge of satisfaction filling his mind. Tony brings a hand up to pet his hair as he then lets go, licking the mark he’s left before kissing it. The mark won’t stay for long, a perk of the serum Steve has had to learn to live with, but the purpose, the mixing of their scents, is fulfilled nevertheless.
”I don’t know, Bucky”, he starts difficultly, setting his beer bottle down to the grass. ”I can’t imagine you’d want to hear about him.”
”Off, this”, he mumbles gently in between his kisses, pulling the helm of Steve’s shirt up. He wants to feel Steve’s skin against his own, everywhere, feel the body that
He looks into the mirror, noticing how the lack of sleep is starting to show on his face. Steve’s not sure if that can be blamed for how unwilling he is to look at himself. On a whim, he decides to finally shave his beard, even though his hands are unsteady due to the heat. He can’t explain why he does it; maybe it’s the heat, maybe it’s how it reminds him of everything. How they’d fought with Tony. How Kieran had learned to pull it.
When Tony turns to him, for a second he looks like Steve’s trusting him with his heart, beating raw and vulnerable in his hands, and in a way he is. Some omegas get very protective right after giving birth, and may growl even at their alphas when they try to get close to the newborn. Steve can feel the smallest hint of that, enough that he recognises the feeling, but at the same time he knows that Tony loves the babies just as much as him and that Tony’s hands are the safest his children could ever be in besides his own. He doesn’t only know it; he feels it through the bond, feels how much Tony loves them already.
”They matter to me”, Steve says, and Tony thinks he can hear offence in his words. But he can’t take it to heart right now.
”You don’t have to take part in it”, Tony offers, realising what a stupid thing it is to say the moment it leaves his lips.
It’s a hard thing to say, and even though Tony tries to hide it, the way he swallows reveals that it’s hard to hear, too.
Tony pulled out of him and Steve was whimpering, suddenly holding his orgasm in in desperation because he didn’t want to come like this, empty and untouched. But he didn’t have to mourn the loss for long, because Tony pushed him onto his stomach, gripping him by the waist and pulling him close. He gave Steve’s ass a loud slap, making Steve yelp, and then he was inside Steve again, pounding into him.
It’s easy to see Steve’s having a hard time keeping his promise of being honest about the pain, but finally, he relents.
”Should’ve seen me a couple of months ago”, Steve answers, trying to feign a light tone. Bucky’s eyes don’t let up for a second.
Great, Steve thinks. They’re not even in the room yet, and they’re already fighting. This is going to be just great.
But his recovery had, in fact, been nearly miraculously fast so far. After he’d woken up, he’d sometimes had trouble remembering words, but lately there had been almost no instances of that anymore. Walking had come back to him in a mere couple of days and he had only small problems even with fine motor skills. It was true that the alpha usually ended up nodding off on the sofa at some point of the day, but at least part of it was due to the painkillers.
”How could you have been with me?” Steve says tiredly. He’s sensing that this conversation is heading off sensible rails.
Rather hastily, Steve then pulled out, let Tony’s leg go and took his own aching cock into hand. With only a couple of tugs he pushed himself over the edge, spilling onto the alpha’s stomach and pressing his face to his neck as he groaned brokenly.
But it was so stupid, Steve thought, shaking his head as he rinsed his coffee mug. A week ago, while Tony had been suffering from a hangover, Steve had perhaps gotten a tad too excited in bed for Tony’s comfort. To Steve’s defense, Tony had been challenging him to do it the night before; to Tony’s defense, he’d been pissed as a newt of course when he’d done it. But it had been fine, Tony had said it had been “amazing” for the most part, that he’d just gotten a little worried about making a mess of the wrong kind when Steve had pounded into his hangover-weakened body. They’d laughed it off together, though, and they’d ordered food and Steve had carried Tony to bath, with the condition that he’d “call Tony ’daddy’ in front of the food delivery guy” if he’d drop him. Yeah, Tony had been kind of teasing him with the whole daddy thing that day.
Once again, Tony just hummed at him, smirking a bit. His free hand closed around Steve’s cock, pumping it slowly, and Steve let himself go again, let Tony continue taking care of him.
”I’m going to stop you here”, she continues. ”It’s okay if you’re angry, but let’s try keeping the taunting away.”
perfect, Steve. And not because of the serum, but because you are you. I’m not gonna lie – the serum has made you look as perfect outside as you are inside, but –”
”I lost my fucking child”, Tony snarls, banging his glass against the table loudly. Drinking really doesn’t seem like such a big deal anymore.
It’s true, but it’s not the whole truth, and Tony can sense that. He presses his lips to Steve’s lower back, kissing his way up his spine, and Steve shivers. He might have gone to a little too dark of a place for a second there, but he definitely doesn’t want to stop.
What can Steve say to that? Of course Tony is right. The knowledge doesn’t make it any easier to accept.
Tony doesn’t have a very exact sense of the time right now, but he’s fairly sure that Steve’s back early. FRIDAY would usually inform him of his arrival, but she hasn’t now and to be fair, Tony could’ve guessed as much. There’s no point in trying to somehow explain the sight Steve’s witnessing, so Tony just raises his bottle at him as a greeting, then shrugs like an asshole. Steve leans his shoulder against the door frame.
After a moment, Steve complies, giving a small but threatening rumble as a sign for Tony to keep going and the world in general to keep in mind that Tony is taken. Tony hums at him approvingly, his thrusts turning more demanding until Steve’s growling morphs back into whining.
Steve had been ready to say something else, but his brow knits at the humour in Tony’s voice. He turns to look at him.
”And – well, this might correlate with the genius bit – but I love your wit, and how funny you are. No one’s ever made me laugh like you do.” A kiss under Tony’s left eye.
Though it wears him out, Steve lets Tony have his distractive bullshit, because Tony’s right; Steve does know that Tony does this when he’s not comfortable with his emotions.
It takes a while before Tony answers. ”I shouldn’t have left at all. Didn’t really help you build your trust in me, this stunt, did it?” he explains, chagrined.
After Tony’s fallen asleep, Steve goes looking for Bruce. He finds all of them – Bruce, Nat, Rhodey, Thor, Rocket, Carol and Nebula – in a conference room planning for their next move. He asks Bruce outside.
Steve blinks, then brings his own hand behind Tony’s neck and pulls him into a kiss. Tony caresses his face, wrapping his arm around Steve. He can’t help it that the way he’s kind of keeping Steve in place, the way Steve relaxes in his hold, makes him remember what they’d left unfinished before.
Tony’s fingers are pressing into Steve’s leg forcefully and Steve’s eyes are shiny again and Tony can’t restrain himself. He pushes his cock past Steve’s rim carefully, locking his eyes with Steve who whines brokenly, quivering all over.
”No, Steve”, he says quickly. ”I’m trying to say that I really, really like you. A lot. Like to the point of it being a problem.”
”Don’t worry about it. It’s not like I have anything better to do until we find that son of a whore Thanos”, he says, fixing his eyes back to his program.
Tony hits him for a second time, for a third and fourth, slightly changing his angle every time, until Steve lets out a throaty noise.
Steve can’t say that he really does, the mere thought of standing on his own two legs seeming like an annoying concept at the moment.
He wasn’t going to bring the bond up, just take the aspirin and leave. But then Steve notices him and begins to say something. Tony instantly blocks it out, his mental barriers rising like a reflex, and words just pour out of him.
“Fuck”, he mutters, and Steve doesn’t miss the subtle grin that flashes across his face. He slides his cock against Steve’s hole and Steve hums unsteadily, clenching involuntarily in response. This is the part where Tony’ll make him beg if he has decided to do so.
”No. Don’t.” Steve’s hand comes up to pet Tony’s hair. ”Like I said, you would never hurt me. That’s the problem.”
He thinks of Tony, thinks of how unjust this is. He’s been so angry, but now everything that’s left is the bottomless grief. Not a cell in his body is ready to do what he’s going to have to do.
”Be my guest”, Tony tells her. Steve wants to imitate his voice mockingly, that’s how high the level of his annoyance is. ”Nice couch, by the way. Fendi?”
”I guess so”, he admits. ”But things aren’t the same they were two months ago. Right now I’m mostly keen on protecting what we still have.”
Oh. Steve isn’t able to hide the omega in him that gets his feelings slightly hurt quickly enough for Thor not to notice.
”See ya, soldier”, he says, giving Steve one final look before turning and vanishing through the circle with Strange and Bruce.
”That’s it. Good”, Tony praised Steve when he’d gotten the pillow placed. Carefully, he got up to his knees, Steve’s legs wrapping around him instantly.
After they were done with the wound and it was wrapped in fresh bandages, they made themselves ready for bed. With a toothbrush in his mouth, Steve watched with a mixture of amusement and slight concern how Tony fought his t-shirt off. He didn’t interfere, aware that the other man wanted to do independently as much as possible.
It feels pure despite the bittersweetness, and Tony thanks the universe for letting him keep this, letting him keep his heart even though it’s broken. He aches thinking about how much Steve has suffered and how his omega still has all of this tenderness left in him despite everything.
When Nat doesn’t answer right away, Steve lets his eyes fall closed again. Despite what he’s just said, he’s not sure where he’d be without Nat right now. Her presence is calming to him even now, and he can feel the possibility of sleep pressing his eyelids. With Tony, Bucky and Sam gone, she’s the only one left Steve truly feels he can depend on.
Tony switches the lock on his wrists to one hand and slaps his ass harshly. Steve whines more from surprise than pain.
”Usually an omega’s mind protects them from going into heat too soon after they’ve lost their alpha”, the doctor explains to him. ”But this happens sometimes. In some rare cases, heat can be a way for an omega’s body to react to the grief. It’s been interpreted as a way for the traumatized mind to try to get the lost mate back with the strong scent of heat. It’s sometimes called a mourning heat.”
It’s silent for a moment, Bucky leaving it up to Steve to decide whether he wants to continue or not.
Tony stares at her. He doesn’t know if he should be worried – even more worried than he already is – or angry. Steve has been sick? And now Tony’s been caught with his metaphorical pants down, not having a clue about what Pepper’s talking about.
”I guess it’s just my way to deal with this. Makes it easier not to think about him. About all of them.”
”Please”, Tony begs again. Loving the needy look on his face, Steve hums adoringly and leans down to plant kisses on Tony’s shoulder and collarbones. He admires the line of Tony’s jawbone, nudging his jaw up gently with the tip of his nose. It’s dim in the car, but Steve can see the slight grey mixed in his beard, his heart fluttering.
”I like spoiling you”, he tells Steve, making his voice as soothing as possible. But Steve’s smile is frail and Tony knows that there’s more.
”Christ, it smells”, Tony complained, sitting on the closed lid of the toilet as Steve began unwrapping the bandages.
They go over his situation as quickly as possible, considering Steve’s already at the point where he doesn’t dare to get up from the bed because of the way he’s leaking. The doctor is an omega himself, so he isn’t affected by the scent, but Steve still feels disturbed and self-conscious. He’s rather old-fashioned in matters like these; heats should be something private between him and his alpha. It’s one thing to talk about heats with a doctor clinically during a health check, and another to have one present while being well on the way into one. No matter how professional the doctor is, he is still a stranger. Steve didn’t much enjoy having Nat and Rhodey see him affected by the heat either, even though he knows they are just helping. If there’s any silver lining to this, it’s the fact that there aren’t any alphas around who could constantly smell him from god knows how far. There’s only one alpha his heats have ever belonged to.
”Steve.” Tony’s eyes are so pleading and Steve wants to just lose himself into them. He doesn’t let go of Tony’s eyes as he dips his fingers between his own wet thighs. ”Please, honey, I need – ah –”
”’A day late and a dollar short’”, he had continued to muse. ”’Better late than never.’ That’s a good one, too.”
”Yeah”, Steve agrees softly, pulling Tony back into his embrace with no immediate plans of getting up. ”Five more minutes.”
Someone’s hovering above him, but Steve doesn’t quite register who before a certain scent reaches him and occupies his mind completely.
”Stop it”, Steve snaps at Tony. ”You’re stressing Emmy out.” He turns to Emmett. ”It’s okay, honey. Shh. You don’t have to worry about it. No, you don’t have to worry about anything, sweetie.”
“It is indeed,” Sir Anthony admits. “I am sorry to have polluted it with my terrible boring facts.” He bows to her in supplication. “I beg your forgiveness.”
